>VERBOSE
CURSES is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).

>look

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>go north

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-
made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good
strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues
along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty-
looking red battery and a tourist map) here.

As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the
demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards.
Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you
going to get it back?

>go west

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

>go south

Airing Cupboard
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic
sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is
filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous
Sixties Revival period of last October.

>look under sheets
Not as many sheets as you thought - they were on top of a large black wireless,
now exposed to the light for the first time in months.

[Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>push wireless north
It moves easily on the casters.

>turn wireless on
You push the switch on the wireless, but nothing happens.

>go west

Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and
other miscellaneous garden implements.

A pair of yellow rubber gloves hangs from a hook on one wall.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her
regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

>wait

Execrable music begins to sound from the conservatory, and Aunt Jemima hums

The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM",
about which the least said the better.

The radio plays a synthesized version of Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture".

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

>go southeast

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

>go east

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft
insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that
was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before
winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are
dark.

In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door.

>examine insulation rolls
You uncover a shiny new battery. It must have been dropped by accident when the
loft insulation was being done.

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>take battery

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too,
what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous
ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi
Expedition of 1882!

Inside Cupboard
This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting
before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for
something...

A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is
propped up against the west wall.

Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.

You can also see a gas mask here.

Storage Room
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous
dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a
handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

A steel wrench gathers dust in the corner.

You begin moving, and then plummet, but friction gradually slows you down and
you land without too much of a thump...

Cellars (in the dumbwaiter)
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall
onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a
handle on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.

In one corner is a dust-covered robot mouse.

Cellars South
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about
ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but
nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle
through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and
excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of
suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is
still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm
stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

There's a little book on the tiny bedside table.

An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway.

>lie down
You get onto the camp bed.

>sleep
You sleep unexpectedly deeply, but just as you think you are starting to wake
up, you experience a sudden...

Premonition
It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the
distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems
faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no
way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire.
There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.

>go east
You pass uncomfortably straight through the hide wall.

The General's Tent
This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious
and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet
four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior
officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance
from a trestle table at the north end of the tent.

>go north

Shrine of the Bear
This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude
drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a
primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs.

On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind.

Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too walks in this
strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange
pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she
seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round
and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they
treat her with respect.

>take mascot
The Druid catches sight of your ghostly hand taking the mascot, and immediately
begins her occultations, cursing you and your ill-gotten gains. But she is
unable to make contact with you, and turns furiously to the tapestry, hissing
"lagach" to the Bear. At once a sudden swirl of wind seems to pull her into the
rough cloth, dissolving her to nothing.

>drop the mascot
Dropped.

There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.

>go southwest

Camp Fire
You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about
the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of
the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle.
It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light
already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it.

>go east

Near Dolmen
A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a
shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably
drawn to it, and your hand reaches out...

You awaken, shivering with dread.

You get off the camp bed.

umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

>go north

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>go north

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-
made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good
strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues
along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM",
about which the least said the better.

The radio plays a snare drum and strings transcription of the Stranglers'
"Golden Brown".

>examine calendar
The calendar is turned to June and a watercolour painting of some wild white
common daisies.

The radio plays a country-and-western arrangement of Bach's Toccata in D minor
for organ.

Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and
other miscellaneous garden implements.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her
regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

Execrable music drifts in from the conservatory.

Jemima hums along to a light orchestra transcription of that hoary old
favourite, "Oh Come All Ye Faithful".

>give box of chocolates to Jemima
Aunt Jemima pounces on the chocolates, wolfs down a strawberry cream and
persuades you to have a vile toffee cracknell. "Now," she says, "Your turn for a
daisy chain!"

You try to look pleased.

"Let's see, the others have had theirs... I have only a few colours left. What
would you like?"

Jemima hums along to a "lite-n-mellow" rendition of Michael Jackson's "Beat It".

[Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>Say, yellow

Jemima hums along to an easy-listening travesty of Hot Chocolate's "Happy

Jemima hums along to a snare drum and strings travesty of Abba's "Mama Mia".

>remove gas mask
You take off the gas mask.

Jemima hums along to a snare drum and strings travesty of "Nessun Dorma", as
sung simultaneously by Pavarotti, Carreras and Dolly Parton.

>say, yellow

Jemima hums along to a Hammond organ travesty of Steppenwolf's "Born to be
Wild".

Basic commands consist either of a verb on its own, or a verb with one or more
nouns. For instance, to see where you are type "look". Some verbs can also have
more elaborate forms; for instance you could also look at, inside or under
something. "Curses" understands about 1200 English words, so most reasonable
synonyms are allowed.

To pick something up, "take thing" and to drop it again, "drop thing". To see
what you have, type "take inventory" or just "inventory". You can move about
with commands such as "go west", or just "west" for short. (It is assumed that
you are blessed with an excellent sense of direction.)

Some commands can act on more than one thing. You can "drop all", which will
drop everything (except things you're wearing), for instance. Or if you found a
packing case with a number of things in, you could type such things as:

    remove everything but the blue key
    get all the coins except ten, twenty and fifty

(Containers may also be emptied or emptied into each other.)  If you are not
explicit enough, sometimes the game can infer what you mean, but at other times
it will ask for further details. It might have replied to the first line above
by saying

    (from the yellow packing case)

so that you know what has been assumed on your behalf. If there had been two
blue keys you might reasonably have meant, it would reply with something like

    Which do you mean, the blue doorkey or the Blue Moon Agency key?

You may either tell it which, or else give up and do something else instead. If
you don't mind which key, you can always say something such as:

    drop a key into the slot

and the game will make a sensible choice and tell you what it was.

"Curses" sometimes assumes commands which you implicitly make, but always tells
you what they are in brackets. For instance:

    >look up bach in book
    (first taking the Encyclopaedia of Composers)
    (putting the tuning fork in the rucksack to make room)
    "J. S. Bach (1685-1750) had a pet aardvark called Nigel...

"it" refers to the last thing manipulated, "him" and "her" to anyone obvious in
the room; "pronouns" will tell you what they currently mean, if in doubt.
"again" repeats the last command.

You can "save", "restore" or "restart" the game at any time, or indeed "quit" or
ask for your "score", which also tells the time. "fullscore" or "full" gives a
breakdown of the score. As an aide-memoire the command "objects" tells you where
you left things you once had, and "places" says where you have been. If you want
to check that your copy of the game file is intact (and not, for instance,
corrupted by some file-transfer process you used to get it), you can "verify"
it. These commands do not take up any game time, and nor does anything the game
didn't understand.

Some jaundiced players tire of long descriptions of places, and they can type
"short" (or "superbrief") to make the game only give short ones. Amnesiac
players, on the other hand, may like to use "long" (or "verbose") to give only
long ones. Either kind can go back to the usual state of affairs with "normal"
(or "brief"). There are also two kinds of inventory: "inventory wide" and
"inventory tall".

This Advanced story file employs special effects such as bold face names of
rooms and a more elaborate status line than usual. Also, less than altogether
relevant quotations pop up from time to time. If these effects do not seem to
work properly on your machine, or are just downright annoying, they can be
turned off with "plain" and on again with "pretty".

From time to time you will be told that your score has changed: this can be
turned off with "notify off", turned on again with "notify on" or made even more
common by "notify full" (which even tells you about scores accruing from visits
to places, unusual items discovered and the like).

Simple typing mistakes can sometimes be corrected just by typing "oops" followed
by the word you had intended to type, so for instance:

    drop fish in buket
    oops bucket

The game knows several useful abbreviations: i for inventory, ne for northeast
(and so on), l for look, g for again, o for oops, x for examine, z for wait
(short for "zzz" - sorry about that).

You can sometimes enter larger objects you find. You might well be able to get
in a tractor, for instance, though driving it around might be harder.

From time to time, you will wish to speak to other people. If you only have a
single word to say, you could use commands like

    answer yes
    say boo to goose

(Text in quotation marks is not allowed.)  The game will usually guess who you
want to talk to if you miss off the name. A better way to talk, which allows
more complicated remarks, is to use commands such as

    goose, boo
    wine waiter, give me the bill
    ask professor about turtles

though the waiter may have better things to do, and the professor might be quite
mad. Some documents may be consulted in this game. For this, try commands such
as

    look up chlorine
    consult periodic table about argon

You can give several commands in a row by use of "then" (or full stops, commas
or "and" in some contexts): so, for instance,

    e, s, get fish then inventory
    e.e.open door.s

There are, of course, many other commands for more specialised circumstances. A
final word of warning: cursing is strictly forbidden in this game.

After a moment she notices you're still here. "Come back later, it'll be done

>read about roger in history book
Roger (1846-1913), the elder of a pair of twins, was very Victorian indeed,
especially in his disapproval of his beautiful young wife's literary career. He
thought her romances so immoral that he refused to allow the family name to
appear on them. A prominent local vestryman, his own writing was confined to a
great many monographs on the problems of municipal drainage, but he died before
his grand National Sewerage Plan was complete.

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft
insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that
was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before
winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are
dark.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.

You can also see an old smudged battery here.

Austin yawns.

>go north

Inside Cupboard
This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting
before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for
something...

There is a big iron fireplace in the west wall.

Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.

>turn crank
With a horrid creaking noise, the crank winds open the skylight, flooding the
room with sunshine.

>go up

Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below.
There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down,
and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is
vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that
there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.

>go northwest

Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of
course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-
looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't
intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.

It is peculiarly cold here.

An iron, gothic-looking key catches your eye.

>take key
(the gothic-looking iron key)
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly
head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body
solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and
spluttering.

The ghost begins to speak:

   When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
   Must render up myself...

Can this possibly be the infamous Sir Joshua Meldrewe?

>give wishbone to ghost
(first taking the chicken wishbone)
(putting the guaranteed-unbreakable medicine bottle with a child-proof lock into

The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation
spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms
flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the
roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM",
about which the least said the better.

The radio plays a "lite-n-mellow" rendition of Grieg's piano concerto.

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew
House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house
rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows
by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the
gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and
excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of
suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is
still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm
stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

There's a little book on the tiny bedside table.

An old striped scarf hangs up behind the doorway.

>lie down
You get onto the camp bed.

>sleep
You sleep unexpectedly deeply, but just as you think you are starting to wake
up, you experience a sudden...

Premonition
It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the
distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems
faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no
way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire.
There is a terrible sense of something about to happen.

>go east
You pass uncomfortably straight through the hide wall.

The General's Tent
This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious
and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet
four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior
officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance
from a trestle table at the north end of the tent.

>go north

Shrine of the Bear
This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude
drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a
primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs.

On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind.

Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too walks in this
strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange
pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she
seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round
and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they
treat her with respect.

>take mascot
The Druid catches sight of your ghostly hand taking the mascot, and immediately
begins her occultations, cursing you and your ill-gotten gains. But she is
unable to make contact with you, and turns furiously to the tapestry, hissing
"lagach" to the Bear. At once a sudden swirl of wind seems to pull her into the
rough cloth, dissolving her to nothing.

Camp Fire
You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about
the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of
the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle.
It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light
already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it.

>go east

Near Dolmen
A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a
shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably
drawn to it, and your hand reaches out...

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

soon."  You groan inwardly but force a sickly smile. Should have eaten the
chocolates myself, you find yourself thinking.

Jemima hums along to a country-and-western travesty of the Beatles' "I Am The
Walrus".

Potting Room
This light room is full of pot plants, flowers, seeds, ornamental trowels and
other miscellaneous garden implements.

Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her
regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains.

Execrable music drifts in from the conservatory.

Jemima hums along to a Hammond organ transcription of Noel Coward's "Don't Put
Your Daughter On The Stage".

>go east

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

The wireless fills the air with Jemima's favourite station, "Mild-n-Breezy FM",
about which the least said the better.

The radio plays a Hammond organ arrangement of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to
Heaven".

>go east

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-
made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good
strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues
along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.

>go south

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>go south

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

>go southeast

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Dark Room
This is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather
years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in
case the children found them.

Mounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man.

You bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time.

A rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side.

Click!  A developing lamp comes on, emitting an eerie red light.

It is addressed to the house, and postmarked 1963, but has no message. Odd,
that.

No... wait. The eerie lamp-light is bringing out a message in invisible ink:

(the sepia photograph)
The photograph is one of the very early ones which looks as if it was taken in
the dark because the chemicals have gradually oxidised. The poor man in the
frame (Mr Roger Meldrew, Esquire) looks as if he was propped up by a big clamp
to hold him still for five minutes, and that's because he was.

>read about Roger in history book
Roger (1846-1913), the elder of a pair of twins, was very Victorian indeed,
especially in his disapproval of his beautiful young wife's literary career. He
thought her romances so immoral that he refused to allow the family name to
appear on them. A prominent local vestryman, his own writing was confined to a
great many monographs on the problems of municipal drainage, but he died before
his grand National Sewerage Plan was complete.

>go east

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft
insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that
was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before
winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are
dark.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.

You can also see an old smudged battery here.

>go north

Inside Cupboard
This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting
before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for
something...

There is a big iron fireplace in the west wall.

Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle.

>turn crank
With a horrid creaking noise, the crank winds open the skylight, flooding the
room with sunshine.

>go up

Roof
This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below.
There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down,
and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is
vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that
there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.

>go northwest

Battlements
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of
course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-
looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't
intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.

It is peculiarly cold here.

An iron, gothic-looking key catches your eye.

>take key
(the gothic-looking iron key)
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly
head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body
solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and
spluttering.

The ghost begins to speak:

                       My hour is almost come
   When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
   Must render up myself...

Can this possibly be the infamous Sir Joshua Meldrewe?

>give wishbone to ghost
(first taking the chicken wishbone)
(putting the photographer's flash into the canvas rucksack to make room)
The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation
spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms
flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the
roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family
legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted
on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is
featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A
narrow crawl leads up into the chimney.

This chimney must have been the one the gothic-looking iron key fell down, for
here it is.

Low down on one wall is a little hatch door, which if it were open would be
large enough to enter.

The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book.

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively

Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,

Aunt Jemima's Lair
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to
potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has
filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made
calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is
cluttered.

An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear
the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen
you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.

Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short

shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

Library Storage
Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted
books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank
and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.

A romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're
propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you
called a plumber to sort this one out.

>say, even
Try "help" for details of how to speak to people.

That's not a verb I recognise.

>Madame, even
Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in
concentration as the Grim Reaper, the Fool and then the Drowned Sailor show. She
blanches with alarm, then recovers and jabbers something about not taking the
cards too literally, the images being symbolic and so on. As rapidly as she
possibly can, she warns you to fear death by water and then hustles you out onto
the street.

Down by River
Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant
rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.

On one especially repellent mound is, of all things, a fine silk handkerchief.

On the far bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat. As much as you like to explore,
you can't see how to attract its attention.

>board boat

On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east.
At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps
a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to
windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I
gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way
once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a
real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't
like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

>man, time
You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes
as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the
boat again, and you find yourself:

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew
House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house
rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows
by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the
gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

Was any of that real? you wonder, as you relax in the sunshine. But then you
realise you are clutching a tarot card which certainly is.

>go northwest

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought
back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream,
to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green
privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A
signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

A magnificent view of the gardens would be yours, were it not for the branches

Lawn Ornaments (in the garden roller)
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass,

Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster
nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden
least visible from the house.

Prominent amongst these is a plaster statuette, a bust of a woman.

back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream,
to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green
privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A
signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

Clearing
A clearing at the edge of the garden, surrounded by walls and the privet hedges
of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an opening in the wall
makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small vegetable garden.

Vegetable Garden
A recently-turned vegetable garden, using up a shady corner of the garden. The
patch testifies more to good intentions than horticulture.

Only a runner-bean plant graces the vegetable garden.

>go down
From this corner, you can only go back to the clearing.

Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass,
between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east).
Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster
nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden
least visible from the house.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where
the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.
