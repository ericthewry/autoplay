Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass,
between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east).
Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster
nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden
least visible from the house.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where
the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.

>go west

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought
back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream,
to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green
privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A
signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

>go southeast

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew
House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house
rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows
by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the
gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

>enter door

Dark Passage
A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal
dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger.

A secret passage slants down to the east through a sandstone recess.

At the north end is a metal door, standing open.

>go east

Sandstone Passage
A flight of sandstone steps, cut in the 1920s when an Egyptological craze was
sweeping England, slants down from the coal-dust passage to the east.

>go east

The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile
Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum.
A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems
to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in
dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

A rather morbid gilded model coffin rests open here.

>go southeast

White Hallway
A low, white hallway adjoining the Octagon, converted from what was once the
scullery and the servants' pantry. A tight, dark staircase runs up and south;
and a diagonal bricked path runs out northeast to the gardens.

Mad Isaac's painting glares at you from the picture hook.

There's an old-fashioned elephant's foot umbrella stand beside the garden
doorway.

>go south

Halfway up the Stairs
This dark, steep staircase zigzagging through the house once gave the servants
access throughout. But those days are long gone and now all the doors are locked
up.

>go up

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and
excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of
suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is
still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm
stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

A tight door stands open in the northern wall, giving onto the servants'
staircase.

You can also see a tourist map here.

>go west

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>go south

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

>go souteast
You can't see any such thing.

>go southeast

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

>go south

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short
flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a
shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south,
and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at
the sign of Scorpio.

>go south

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room
of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't
bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the
whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to
go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the miniature, beautifully magnified and
amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the
north doorway into the Observatory.

>take miniature
(putting the book of Twenties poetry into the canvas rucksack to make room)
The south wall becomes blank again.

whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall is lit up by the projector.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the
north doorway into the Observatory.

>examine projector
It has an on/off switch on the side, and a slot for holding whatever is to be
projected. There is also a little dial on the back, perhaps for the focus.
The slide projector is currently switched on.

(will ignore further occurrences)
Star, the Maiden, the Castle, the Fool, the Ace of Cups, the Grim Reaper, the
Drowned Sailor or the postcard of the Champs-Elysees?

>the maiden
You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else.

>take maiden
(putting the long wrought iron key into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

>put card in slot
(the Maiden in the slide projector)
The south wall lights up with the picture on the Maiden, beautifully magnified
and amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

>go south
You walk confidently into the south wall...

Sea Shore
A rough rocky sea shore below barely-climbable cliffs, against which inviting
deep blue sea laps. It seems to be early morning, soon after dawn, from the look
of the sun on the water.

Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea
as she awaits her fate.

>examine andromeda
Avert your eyes. She is naked (unless you count a hairband), as was fashionable
for human sacrifices: the victim left overnight without food or shelter until
the dawn. It has to be said that she doesn't look all that keen to be rescued.

>andromeda, hello
Andromeda hisses something contemptuous at you in Greek. (Attic, not Demotic,
ironically enough, but then it's all Greek to you.)

>go south
The rocks are too dangerous. You'll have to scale the cliff.

>go up

Cliffs
On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous slither down
leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even more hazardous.
Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle lighthouse, but
there is no way in from here.

A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth.

>go east

Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village
not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats,
continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across
sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.

>go south

Wall of Thorns
The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and
suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area
perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.

The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive.

>take rod of fire
Taken.

>strike rod of fire
The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley
lines...

>point rod of fire at wall
(the wall of thorns)
Fire leaps out from the rod into the heart of the thorn wall, which screams out
as it burns, revealing a great hole through the wild flames. You catch a
tantalising glimpse of a great Temple, before the wall heals back. But it is
unable to recover entirely, and a charred gap is left to the south. You could
probably squeeze through it.

>take rod of luck
(putting the glowing golden orb into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

>strike rod of luck
The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley
lines...

>point it at me
You feel optimistic and lucky. Mind you, you feel that most times.

Wall of Thorns

suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area
perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.

A ragged gap in the wall has been burnt out to the south.

>go south

Sacred Earth
Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred earth into
the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such
hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that
sort of thing.

>[ Zeus, whose will has marked for man
  A single way where wisdom lies
  Ordained one eternal plan:
  Man must suffer to be wise.
  
  -- Aeschylus, "Agamemnon"]

go south
Zeus, chief of all the gods, appears and hurls a thunderbolt down just before
you begin to cross into the Temple. Astonishingly, you beat the luck of the gods
and slip into the temple just clear of the thunderbolt. "Damn, missed!" says a
sepulchral voice from without.

Temple of Zeus
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is
quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all
the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way
howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

Cloisters lead southeast and southwest, deeper into the temple.

You can see one copper coin here.

East Cloister
The east cloister of the Temple, which turns from northwest to southwest, is
bare but for a small niche.

Resting in the niche is an inscribed pumice stone, two feet tall.

>read letter
A faint typewritten letter, postmarked Cairo, October 1920, with a handwritten
note signed simply "Ellingsworth":

Hartley - Thought you might be able to date some of these queer pictograms and
determinitives, early New Kingdom?  Pottery unclear, work continues

Inner Sanctum
Here from the dark heart of the temple, cloisters fork northeast and northwest
while a flight of narrowing steps lead down and to the north.

The blind poet Homer half-slumbers here, clutching his syrinx (or Pan-pipes) to
himself.

>wake homer
Homer wakes up, with a start. "I suppose you want the syrinx," he grumbles,
"they always do. There are three questions you must answer wisely. The usual
deal."

(He seems to be under an enchantment and able to speak modern English, or at
least American.)

"First: who is the brother of Menelaus?"

>homer, Agamemnon
"Mph," he says (untranslatably). "But can ya see the future?  Who's gonna rule
Alexandria after the fall of the guy they're gonna call Alexander the Big?"

>Homer, Ptolemy
"What's your favorite color?"

>Homer, yellow
Homer reluctantly hands you the syrinx. "Now leave me alone, I got six books of
the Iliad left to compose."

Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village

Seized by divine inspiration, you launch into J. S. Bach's Passacaglia. Suddenly
the great god Apollo appears before you!  As he speaks the very rock
reverberates.

   "All wisdom is mine, mortal!
   Though you shall seek out your curse
   A thousand years and more. Now ask!"

Apollo, as he vanishes, laughs in that style more recently popularised by Third
World dictators and mad scientists. His priestess, the Oracle, steps out of the
shadows.

A dry cave opening from a crack to the northeast, becoming a fair-sized cavern,

The Oracle, the masked priestess of Apollo, stands here behind an obsidian
altar-stone, three cubits cubed: to her side is a bronze urn, mouthing perpetual
flame.

>put fig in urn
You have pleased the god Apollo - Loxias, god of words and counsel, as he was
once called!  Very wise.

>oracle, hello
The priestess, Pythian oracle of Loxias, seems hardly to hear or understand: but
goes into a trance, swaying to a sensuous rhythm: and chants, in English,

 "As Hephaestus, master of the metals
  uncovered the gilden sunrise of Helicon
  so, in a pace and nine paces
  when six arches have stood sixty years
  shall even a shade's remains be cast."

Apollo is what you might call an annoying git, were he not also an alarmingly
powerful deity.

Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass,
between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east).
Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster
nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden
least visible from the house.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where
the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.

You are engulfed in a cloud of spinning white lights, like insects. When the
swarm clears, you find yourself transported...

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

>go southeast

The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

>go south

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short
flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a
shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south,
and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at
the sign of Scorpio.

>go south

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room

whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to
go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the miniature, beautifully magnified and
amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the
north doorway into the Observatory.

Sacred Earth

the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such
hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that

  Man must suffer to be wise.

Zeus, chief of all the gods, appears and hurls a thunderbolt down just before
you begin to cross into the Temple. Astonishingly, you beat the luck of the gods
and slip into the temple just clear of the thunderbolt. "Damn, missed!" says a
sepulchral voice from without.

Temple of Zeus
The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is
quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all

howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.

Homer wakes up, with a start. "I suppose you want the syrinx," he grumbles,
"they always do. There are three questions you must answer wisely. The usual
deal."

(He seems to be under an enchantment and able to speak modern English, or at
least American.)

"First: who is the brother of Menelaus?"

Clifftop Walk
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village
not far east. These fields are occupied by herds of hardy mountain goats,
continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across
sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.

>go east
The goats obediently part to allow you to get by.

Outside Taverna
A long walk along the cliffs from the lighthouse leads naturally here, just
outside the Eraina Taverna, whose open doorway lies to the south.

Hanging from a low branch of a fig tree is, as you might expect, a fig.

Eraina Taverna
A plain but cheery taverna, fill of miserable and rather ashamed men who are
drinking retsina heavily. The day is dawning outside the north door, but they
strangely do not share your uplifted feeling at the sight.

Left untouched on one table is an Ekmek Special dessert.

Behind the bar, a depressed bartender polishes glasses.

Cliffs
On top of some exposed cliffs on the Mediterranean. A dangerous slither down
leads on one side to the shore, all other ways down being even more hazardous.
Atop the cliffs is the Pharos tower, a round stone pinnacle lighthouse, but
there is no way in from here.

A grassy walk leads east, and a narrow crack leads southwest into a cave mouth.

>go down

Sea Shore
A rough rocky sea shore below barely-climbable cliffs, against which inviting
deep blue sea laps. It seems to be early morning, soon after dawn, from the look
of the sun on the water.

Chained to the cliff face is the beautiful Andromeda, looking nobly out to sea
as she awaits her fate.

She smiles as if to say there's not much point watching her waist-line any more,
and hungrily wolfs down her favourite dessert. As a gesture of thanks, she takes
off her amber hairband and hands it you. Quickly she readopts her noble pose,
however, just in case anyone else is looking.

(first taking the Pan pipes)
(putting the Rod of Husbandry into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Seized by divine inspiration, you launch into J. S. Bach's Chromatic Fantasy and
Fugue. Suddenly the great god Apollo appears before you!  As he speaks the very
rock reverberates.

   "All wisdom is mine, mortal!
   Though you shall seek out your curse
   A thousand years and more. Now ask!"

Apollo, as he vanishes, laughs in that style more recently popularised by Third
World dictators and mad scientists. His priestess, the Oracle, steps out of the
shadows.

Cave Mouth
A dry cave opening from a crack to the northeast, becoming a fair-sized cavern,

The Oracle, the masked priestess of Apollo, stands here behind an obsidian
altar-stone, three cubits cubed: to her side is a bronze urn, mouthing perpetual
flame.

>place fig in urn
That's not a verb I recognise.

>put fig in urn
You have pleased the god Apollo - Loxias, god of words and counsel, as he was
once called!  Very wise.

>oracle, tell me about fig
The priestess, Pythian oracle of Loxias, seems hardly to hear or understand: but
goes into a trance, swaying to a sensuous rhythm: and chants, in English,

 "As Hephaestus, master of the metals
  uncovered the gilden sunrise of Helicon
  so, in a pace and nine paces
  when six arches have stood sixty years
  shall even a shade's remains be cast."

Apollo is what you might call an annoying git, were he not also an alarmingly
powerful deity.

You are engulfed in a cloud of spinning white lights, like insects. When the

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

>go south

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short
flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a
shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south,
and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at
the sign of Virgo.

Austin seems fascinated by the beam of light.

>go south

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room
of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't
bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the
whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to
go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the Maiden, beautifully magnified and
amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the
north doorway into the Observatory.

Ruined Castle Cafe
This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to the ruined
castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You
find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is
noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the
chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very
slight.

Over in one corner, you can see a little square window, behind which must be the
store of cups and glasses. Remembering this, you are distracted and unable to
enjoy the entertainment. Even the table is annoying. It must have one leg
shorter than the rest, or something, because it rattles now and then.

The table rattles again.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>look under table
Now don't panic, but there's a ticking bomb loosely taped to the underside of
the table you're sitting at!

The clock is ticking downwards, and is eight minutes short of the red zone. All
four wires are plugged into the timer.

>examine scarf
This is an old Biblioll College scarf, made by Dunn and Co. (naturally). It has
four stripes: royal blue, emerald, dark grey and scarlet.

The clock is ticking downwards, and is seven minutes short of the red zone. All
four wires are plugged into the timer.

>examine wires
You can't see any such thing.

>examine bomb
It contains a timer-detonator, a bundle of plastic explosives and many, many
wires. The most obvious ones are green, red, blue and black. They would pull out
of their loose sockets in the timer easily, so perhaps this bomb disposal
nonsense isn't as tricky as people make out.

The clock is ticking downwards, and is six minutes short of the red zone. All
four wires are plugged into the timer.

>pull blue wire
You pull out the blue wire. 
The clock is ticking downwards, and is five minutes short of the red zone. Only

The clock is ticking downwards, and is three minutes short of the red zone. The
green wire, blue wire and black wire are unplugged.

You pull out the red wire. All four wires are now disconnected.

The clock is ticking downwards, and is two minutes short of the red zone. None

Lighthouse
You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse.
Considerately enough, the builders have provided a spiral staircase down. The
cliffs below are familiar, but it's a little later in the day than your arrival
on the sea shore. There seems to be very little traffic at the moment, though a
smudge on the horizon might possibly be a quinquireme.

In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors,
its open end pointed out across the bay. The sun is rising and the sky is clear
blue over the Mediterranean: it's going to be a beautiful day.

You hear a sharp click!

The flash suddenly gives an enormous magnesium-flare flash, almost blinding in
its intensity. Your eyes take a little while to adjust. Consequently you can
only hear as the smudge on the horizon rises from the waves, becomes an enormous
Kraken sea monster and lunges for the stone tower. (Considering this is supposed
to be a Greek myth it feels surprisingly like a Japanese 1960s creature film.) 
The Kraken swipes at you, overreaches itself and falls over forward, impaling
itself extremely messily on the pharos. Your eyes just about recover by the time
the rest of your body is crushed by its weight.

Up on Mount Olympus, Zeus is still cross. "Take me to your Leda", you wittily
demand, but this does not seem to improve matters. Poseidon also looks rather
fed up, but luckily a sizeable faction of goddesses takes your side and arranges
to have you resurrected...

Family Tree
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought
back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream,
to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green
privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A
signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

[Your score has just gone up by fifty points.]

>go east

Lawn Ornaments
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass,
between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east).
Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster
nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden
least visible from the house.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where
the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.

>go east

Mosaic
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with
tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn
Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised
Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never
been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.

A hard wooden ball, palm-sized, rolls about across the mosaic.

>mosaic, lagach
A swirl of wind snakes out from the Roman mosaic and whisks you away to...

Crypt
A dismal crypt, disused, rainswept and strewn with leaves. Light streams in from
the square hole in the roof. There are no bones or urns on show.

The mural stands slightly to one side, revealing a passage leading downward.

>mural, lagach
A swirl of wind snakes out from the bronze mural and whisks you away to...

Bohemia
Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and stylish despite
the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel, caked with paint,
littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't help standing on
tiptoe here.

One whole wall is an Impressionist mural painting of a chateau in Aix-en-
Provence.

>mural, lagach
A swirl of wind snakes out from the Impressionist painting and whisks you away

Hall of Exhibits
A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled
doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are high, but there's
just enough light to see by.

A long painted still life graces one wall near a corner.

>still life, lagach
A swirl of wind snakes out from the still life and whisks you away to...

White Hallway
A low, white hallway adjoining the Octagon, converted from what was once the
scullery and the servants' pantry. A tight, dark staircase runs up and south;
and a diagonal bricked path runs out northeast to the gardens.

Mad Isaac's painting glares at you from the picture hook.

There's an old-fashioned elephant's foot umbrella stand beside the garden
doorway.

You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse.
Considerately enough, the builders have provided a spiral staircase down. The
cliffs below are familiar, but it's a little later in the day than your arrival

picking up again now that the Kraken has gone.

In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors,
its open end pointed out across the bay. The Mediterranean sparkles in the hot
afternoon sun.

You can see the Castle, some old gardeners' gloves, a canvas rucksack (in which

The rod charges with etherial power, drawn up from the earth through ley

>point rod at me
(the Rod of Returning at yourself)
You are engulfed in a cloud of spinning white lights, like insects. When the
swarm clears, you find yourself transported...

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.

leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short
flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a
shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south,
and hits the glass ball, which amplifies it into a powerful yellow searchlight
which slowly turns about the room.

>go south

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room
of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't
bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the
whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to
go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the Star, beautifully magnified and
amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the
north doorway into the Observatory.

Causeway
A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion
causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The
Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast)
is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.

Austin springs about contentedly.

Island of Pharos
The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one of
the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120
metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.

A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two
scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously
if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.

In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed-wreathed iron grating,
closed up tight.

Interestingly, a key which looks as if it would fit the grating can be seen
inside the passage beneath.

Austin strolls regally along with you.

Down below, a wave splashes against the sea front, briefly washing up under the

The Birdcage of the Muses

infighting scholars almost imprisoned as they turn out rival commentaries on the

Reading Corridor
A spacious, densely colonnaded corridor, its walls lined with inset shelves on

hardly aware of your presence.

Callimachus takes the tube and looks inside to see a scroll, which he pulls out
eagerly.

"Arrghhhieee!" he says (untranslatably), boiling over with rage. He then curses
repeatedly, but the only word you can make out is "Apollonius". He pushes you
out of his way and stomps off.

something. They seem well practised at this occupation.

A grizzled sailor sits at a harbourside table.

An inscribed six-sided die lies on the table in front of him.

The sailor hums a sea shanty.

>play dice with sailor
I only understood you as far as wanting to play the inscribed die.

>play dice
(first taking the inscribed die)
The sailor covers it with his hand. But he looks the type who's never averse to
a game.

The sailor hums a sea shanty.

>throw dice
You throw a "si", whatever that means.

The sailor grabs the die and throws a "ca", and grins.

The sailor grabs the die and throws a "zal", and sighs.

The sailor stares at the die thoughtfully.

Time passes.

The sailor grabs the die and throws a "si", and sighs.

>go east

Outside the Theatre
Tragically, the Theatre is closed tonight, but roads lead past the great stepped
bowl: north toward the Palace, south to the Museum and west to the harbour-
front.

>go south

Outside the Royal Museum
The main southwest-northeast road forks off with a road due north to the
Theatre. Despite the kaleidoscopic din you are impressed by the sober majesty of
the Museum of the Ptolemies, whose fine portico entrance, decked with reliefs,
is southeast.

The Morning Star leads an enormous procession for the festival of Dionysus,
which throngs with officials dressed as satyrs, actors and townswomen.

>go southwest

Crossroads
The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys-shaped Alexandria, greatest city of
the civilised world. The northwest-southeast road runs from the causeway to the
Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis gate, northeast to the
great public buildings of the city.

Yes, 2000 oxen dressed in gold, as many dogs, and the giraffes, the antelopes,
the gnus, parrots, elephants, wildebeest... ostriches pulling carts, a white
bear...

>go northwest

Causeway
A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion
causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The
Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast)
is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.

>go north

Island of Pharos
The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one of
the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120
metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.

A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy-two
scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously
if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.

In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed-wreathed iron grating,
closed up tight.

Down below, a wave splashes against the sea front, briefly washing up under the
grating.

>unlock grating with rusty key
You unlock the rusty iron grating.

Down below, a wave splashes against the sea front, briefly washing up under the
grating.

>open grating
You open the rusty iron grating.

Down below, a wave splashes against the sea front, briefly washing up under the
grating.

>go down

Jetty
Down on a dark stone jetty, where the waters of the Alexandrian harbour splash
insistently. Rough-hewn steps rise up the island through the grating.

A skiff (a small sail-boat) is moored up here.

Jetty
Down on a dark stone jetty, where the waters of the Alexandrian harbour splash
insistently. Rough-hewn steps rise up the island through the grating.

A skiff (a small sail-boat) is moored up here.

A wave suddenly splashes against your feet, up to the knees, and washes up the
steps toward the grating.

>take heart
(putting the purple sash into the canvas rucksack to make room)
Taken.

>board skiff
You get into the skiff.

>sail skiff
I only understood you as far as wanting to sail.

>sail
You set sail, and a light breeze propels your skiff...

Harbour Mouth (in the skiff)
As the skiff passes the jaws of the Royal Harbour, beneath the great Pharos
light, you have a final view of the receding civilisation of Alexandria: ahead
lies the vast, oil-calm Mediterranean and moonlight on the waters.

>sail
That seems to be happening whether you like it or not.

The sails billow, then slacken...

Drifting (in the skiff)
You drift in the wide, peaceful Lunar sea. Curious fish, their yellow-green eyes
gleaming beneath the silver ripples, brush past your wake: the night zephyr is
almost slack but still you drift. Minutes pass like hours in paradise.

>sail
That seems to be happening whether you like it or not.

Light brightens into day. The skiff drifts, drifts upon...

Garden Stream (in the skiff)
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew
House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house
rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows
by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the
gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

>exit
You get out of the skiff.

Dark Passage
A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal
dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger.

A secret passage slants down to the east through a sandstone recess.

At the north end is a metal door, standing open.

A flight of sandstone steps, cut in the 1920s when an Egyptological craze was
sweeping England, slants down from the coal-dust passage to the east.

The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile
Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum.
A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems
to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in
dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

A rather morbid gilded model coffin rests open here.

But you aren't holding it.
