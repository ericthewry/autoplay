Alison's Writing Room
A pleasantly furnished, if now mildewed, box room. There are engravings of
Alison's heroines: Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Browning, Emily Dickinson and
Queen Victoria, an unlikely quartet. The wallpaper is done out in a dice motif,
and a square outline of sixes surrounds a rather small door leading back north
into the attics.

The flag is spread out as a blanket on the comfortable bed.

On the comfortable bed is a flag of the British Merchant Navy.

Blue sky can be seen through south-facing windows, latticed with black lead and
shut tight.

There is a long vanity mirror beside the bed.

CURSES is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long descriptions of
locations (even if you've been there before).

>go south
You can't, since the windows is in the way.

>break window
The windows suddenly give way in a shower of flakes of paint, letting fresh
summer air into the room!

>go south

Tiny Balcony
A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's windows, offering fresh air, blue skies and
a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway in the
distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which
you haven't), so you had better go back north.

The balcony is only a foot or so beneath the window-sill, and only about four
feet square.

>look under window
You dislodge something shiny!

Black-latticed windows open on a beautiful summer's day.

There is a long vanity mirror beside the bed.

>go north

Dead End
The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too,
what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear.

A secret door stands open in the south wall!

A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light
floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)

>go north

East Annexe
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft
insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that
was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before
winter) lets a little natural light in and the dead end south is bright with
sunlight through a square open hatchway in the roof.

In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside.

You can also see an old smudged battery here.

>go west

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

>go northwest

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

>go north

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

>close trapdoor
You close the trapdoor, surprised to see that something shiny was obscured by
it.

In one corner is a jewellery box, which had previously been hidden by the open

There is a closed trapdoor in the middle of the floor.

Austin looks ineffable again.

Austin purrs and licks one of his paws.

>unlock box with gold key
You unlock the antique jewellery box.

Austin purrs and licks one of his paws.

>open box
You open the antique jewellery box, revealing a four-leafed clover.

Austin oozes away to the servant's bedroom.

Austin runs away to the furniture store.

>wave clover
Light pulses around the daisy chain, then leaps out to engulf the four-leafed
clover which melts into a featureless mahogany rod!

Old Winery
This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-
made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good
strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues
along a passage east.

You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is empty) here.

>go east

Storage Room
A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous
dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a
handle on.

Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter.

>enter dumbwaiter
You get into the dumbwaiter.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

In the dumbwaiter you can also see a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty).

>pull rope
You begin moving, and then plummet, but friction gradually slows you down and
you land without too much of a thump...

Cellars (in the dumbwaiter)
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall
onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a
handle on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.

There is a little closed window-vent low in the north wall.

The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here.

In the dumbwaiter you can also see a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty).

>pull rope
You heave yourself half-way up, and then need to stop for a rest.

Dark Shaft (in the dumbwaiter)
Halfway up, or else halfway down, and a dreary place it is too: nothing but a
dark corridor leading north.

Dark Passage
A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal
dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger.

A secret passage slants down to the east through a sandstone recess.

At the north end is a metal door, standing open.

>go east

Sandstone Passage
A flight of sandstone steps, cut in the 1920s when an Egyptological craze was
sweeping England, slants down from the coal-dust passage to the east.

The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile
Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum.
A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems
to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in
dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

A rather morbid, gilded model coffin rests here in peace.

Leaned against one of the eight corners is a ragged white parchment scroll.

A little charcoal sketch is framed on one wall.

>examine sketch
Behind the frame seems to be an artist's impression of the great Palace of
Alexandria as it might once have been.

>take sketch

>break frame

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and
excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of
suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is
still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm
stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

A tight door stands open in the northern wall, giving onto the servants'
staircase.

>read about 1420 in  map

At that exact grid reference is Meldreustrasse, a minor back street which houses
a museum of arcana.

Suddenly you remember!  You visited the place once, and the curator Doktor Stein
showed you round... and he hypnotised you into a swirl of unconsciousness...


Museum Foyer
The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant
sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and rain beats against
the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.

The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked
off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor.

A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

world outside and opens only onto the foyer, southwest.

>push ball south
You pass between the steel walls and a light passes over you. Suddenly barriers
spring out across the corridor, thumping into the beach ball which rapidly
begins to deflate.

There is a sharp hiss as you nimbly jump over the ball, and then a horrid clang
as the barriers come together behind you.

Hall of Exhibits
A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled
doorways east and west. The storm is dark, and the windows are high, but there's
just enough light to see by.

Resting on a little display table is a Tarot box.

Finally reacting to the alarm you set off, Doktor Stein appears and steps toward
you, clapping his hands sharply. And dozens of robed figures leap out of the
darkness - but these are no security guards. Their faces are painted hideously
and they betray no emotion as they pinion you tight...

"So, Meldrew. It is all as it was prophesied," says Stein in a perfectly
conversational tone as he forces your mouth open and makes you swallow a violet
pill.

"One of your apothecary ancestors made this drug!  Appropriate, no?"

You feel queasy, but this is perhaps the least of your problems as they drag you
off...

White Hallway
A low, white hallway adjoining the Octagon, converted from what was once the
scullery and the servants' pantry. A tight, dark staircase runs up and south;
and a diagonal bricked path runs out northeast to the gardens.

Mad Isaac's painting glares at you from the picture hook.

There's an old-fashioned elephant's foot umbrella stand beside the garden

Servant's Room
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and
excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of
suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is
still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm
stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.

A tight door stands open in the northern wall, giving onto the servants'
staircase.

Suddenly you remember!  You visited the place once, and the curator Doktor Stein

Museum Foyer
The Museum of Arcana is deserted after nightfall and only dimly lit by distant
sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night and rain beats against
the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats.

The revolving door to northeast, which leads out, seems to be solidly blocked
off. But a dim passage runs south, through a strange metal corridor.

A publicity poster is displayed for passers-by outside to see.

You pass between the steel walls and a light passes over you. Suddenly barriers

There is a sharp hiss as you nimbly jump over the ball, and then a horrid clang
as the barriers come together behind you.

Hall of Exhibits
A great square gloomy room, just south of the foyer. There are square lintelled

just enough light to see by.

Kicking and screaming, you are are dragged off to a grisly sacrifice...

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

swarm clears, you find yourself transported...

Attic
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively
tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem
fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But
the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

Old Furniture
Scruffy old furniture is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out,
umbrella stands, a badly scratched cupboard, a table with one leg missing... You
try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic
continues to the southeast.

You can see some wrapping paper with reindeer on here.

Over the East Wing
The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area.
The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway
leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south.

Disused Observatory
Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it
leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short
flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a
shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south.

Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

A beam of white light runs into the room from the slide projector to the south,
and hits the glass ball, which somehow bends it so that it strikes the mural at
the sign of Capricorn.

>go south

Souvenirs Room
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room
of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't
bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the
whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to
go is back up to the observatory.

You can see a ship in a bottle here.

The south wall displays the picture on the Fool, beautifully magnified and
amazingly life-like. Why, you'd hardly know there was a wall there at all.

A beam of white light points directly backward from the projector, through the
north doorway into the Observatory.

>examine projector
It has an on/off switch on the side, and a slot for holding whatever is to be
projected. There is also a little dial on the back, perhaps for the focus.
The slide projector is currently switched on.

Folly
This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east. Down below in
the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and
a hay wain is being pulled across the river.

Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The
freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The
latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe.

A bean pole, of the kind used to grow climbing plants, rests against the side of
the tower.

Unreal City

west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building.

>go east

Near Ring Road
A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so full of
black-suited pedestrians off to work at banks that you can't force your way any

street and down some steps below a Metropolitan sign.

Down by River
Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant
rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.

Moored close to the bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat.

>board boat

On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east.
At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps
a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to
windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I
gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way
once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a
real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't
like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

>man, time
You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes
as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the
boat again, and you find yourself:

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew
House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house
rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows
by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the
gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream,
to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green
privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A
signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

A big motorised garden roller is parked here.

Patio in Maze (in the garden roller)
This is an old stone patio in the heart of the garden maze. A missing flagstone
offers an intriguing dark prospect beneath.

Sticking out of some soft earth is a perfectly-carved marble rose.

You are hedged in and can only go back west.

Crypt
A dismal crypt, disused, rainswept and strewn with leaves. Light streams in from
the square hole in the roof. There are no bones or urns on show.

The south wall forms a giant bronze mural, which has stood the test of time.

>examine mural
The mural depicts an old bearded wise man following a star in the western sky.
He has his right arm around an attractive young woman and holds a bundle of
wands with his left hand. Around the border are astrological symbols of all
kinds, from Tarot suits to zodiacal constellations.

Shadowy Hallway

>push bell
Madame Sosostris breezes in once more. "You again," she says warily. "Let us see
how your fortunes have changed."

Madame Sosostris picks up the cards and deals them onto the table. She frowns in
concentration as the Star, the Maiden and then the Eight of Wands show. "You
have come!  At last, after all these centuries!  But there is little I can do to
ease your way, save to return the staff you left with me for safe keeping."  And
she shows you out. You feel rather bewildered.

Down by River
Down at the end of the street, the brown urban waters carry by unpleasant
rubbish, and rats scuttle up and over the mounds washed up around you.

Moored close to the bank is a glass-roofed tourist boat.

>board boat

On board the Phlebas
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east.
At the helm is a very strange man, at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps
a hollow cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to
windward.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I
gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way
once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a
real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't
like that... Hurry up, please, it's time."

>man, time
You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes
as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the
boat again, and you find yourself:

Garden Stream
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew
House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house
rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows
by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the
gardens, or else east along a path hugging the wall.

On the house wall is a coal bunker, whose door stands open.

Dark Passage
A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal
dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger.

A secret passage slants down to the east through a sandstone recess.

At the north end is a metal door, standing open.

>go east

Sandstone Passage
A flight of sandstone steps, cut in the 1920s when an Egyptological craze was
sweeping England, slants down from the coal-dust passage to the east.

The Octagon
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile
Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum.
A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems
to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High windows on the northern face let in
dim light.

There is a little window-vent high in the southwest wall.

A rather morbid gilded model coffin rests open here.

Jagged Passage
An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in

Sarcophagus
Well, perhaps "sarcophagus" is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of
moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You are stooped over
inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice
you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place.

Catacombs
A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls
around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely
familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing
to the north and a crawl west.

Something like... perhaps, air after a thunderstorm... but no, you still can't

of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently, according to his or
her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being science, there is only a
black metal one-metre cube with an unimpressive collection of gauges and dials.
An aluminium staircase leads up.

Particularly prominent are a large dial, like the volume control on an expensive
hi-fi amplifier, and a big electrician's switch. Both are labelled in small
print.

[Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine cube
That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine dial
Above the dial is a lower-case letter h with a slashed line through it. It is
currently turned to 1.055 or thereabouts. There is something worryingly
dangerous about its matter-of-factness.

>examine switch
The lower, on, position is labelled "Determinism". The upper, off, position is
labelled "Chance".
The big electrician's switch is currently switched on.

>examine panel
You can't see any such thing.

>turn off switch
Clunk-click!  Probably nothing very much has changed.

>save

Catacombs
A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls
around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely
familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing
to the north and a crawl west.

The odd smell seems to be ozone, and it drifts up from a previously concealed
aluminium staircase.

>go west

Contraption Room
The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically
complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice
running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end
of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which,
although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are
very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.

The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.

The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal.

Amid the glass wall is an iron panel divided into a three-by-five grid.

Behind the glass is a kind of see-saw of two leather baskets at opposite ends of
an oak pivot. In one corner of the roof, above the far end of the see-saw, is a
hole through which dim natural light emanates.

Projecting out of the back of the panel mechanism at the near end is a metal
hand, which grasps a cannonball in mid-air.

The lower basket contains a glowing golden orb.

>examine metal sheet
Someone rather good-looking (you can't help thinking) is reflected in the metal
surface.

>inventory

running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end

although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are
very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.

The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.

The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal.

Amid the glass wall is an iron panel divided into a three-by-five grid.

Behind the glass is a kind of see-saw of two leather baskets at opposite ends of
an oak pivot. In one corner of the roof, above the far end of the see-saw, is a
hole through which dim natural light emanates.

Projecting out of the back of the panel mechanism at the near end is a metal
hand, which grasps a cannonball in mid-air.

The lower basket contains a glowing golden orb.

>point rod of bronze at wall
(the metal wall)
At once, the bronze polishes up to the shine of a mirror.

>go north

Walking through the mirror is a wrench, but leaves you somewhere... almost
exactly the same...

up the hole in the corner.

Family Tree (in the garden roller)
You stand in the shade of a great plane tree, seedlings for which were brought
back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream,
to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green
privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A
signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.

Lawn Ornaments (in the garden roller)
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass,
between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east).
Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster
nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden
least visible from the house.

The lawn is lightly coated with broken plaster and dust, and in the spot where
the statuette once stood is a dark, ancient well.

Sitting on the grass, beside the well, is a glowing golden orb.
