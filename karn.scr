Console Room
The console room is the heart of operations of the TARDIS. Dominating the room
is a six-side console.  Located above the console is the scanner.  A corridor to
the east leads further into the TARDIS.  On the west side of the room are the
main doors.

Workshop
This is the room where you do much of your tinkering with electronic gadgetry. 
Many a Rutan invasion or Dalek plot has been foiled by an ingenius invention
you've thrown together at last minute in this room.  In fitting with your work
habits, it's usually a rather untidy place.  However, in your latest fit of
spring cleaning you've almost emptied the place out. There's a small cupboard on
the eastern wall, and on the north wall an open door connects the workshop to
the corridor outside.

Your workbench dominates the center of the room.

On the workbench is your toolkit (which is closed).

>get toolkit

>open toolkit
Opening the toolkit reveals your sonic screwdriver and a homing device.

>take screwdriver and device
sonic screwdriver: Taken.

>examine scanner
The scanner (which resembles an old television set) displays a picture of a
barren rocky landscape.

>examine console
The TARDIS console consists of a multitude of complex switches and buttons. 
These include a large red lever, a large green button marked "Engage", beneath
which is a slot.  Also, on the edge of the console there's what looks like a
tiny metal drawer.  The center of the console houses the time rotor.

The main doors quietly hum as they open.

Rocky Clearing
You step onto the inhospitable landscape of the planet Karn. Nightmare-like
memories flood back to you upon seeing this place again.  The cold air only
antagonize the shivers running down your spine.  You're standing on a relatively
flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain. Rocky outgrowths stand like
walls all around you.  A trail through the rock is visible to the east, while
another trail to the northwest leads farther up the mountain.

The TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.

Against the western rockface stands a massive boulder.

>go northwest

Mountain Trail
You are on a grim trail that winds itself upwards along the mountain to the
northeast.  A clearing lies to the southeast, and a stoney trail leads upwards
to the west.

>go northeast

Mountain Trail
The trail continues up the mountain to the east, and downwards to the southwest.

>go east

Mountain Trail
The trail continues up the mountain to the northeast, and downwards to the west.

To the south some steps are carved into the mountain.  They lead upwards out of

>go up

Ruins
You stand before a huge pile of stone rubble and charred debris.  You recognize
this spot to be the site of Solon's castle.  The castle appears to have been
completely destroyed.  You sense a slight psychic twinge in the air. This looks
like the work of the Sisterhood.

Some stone steps lead back down the mountain.

>search ruins
Searching through the rubble, you find a scalpel.

>go northeast

Mountain Trail
Things level off here somewhat.  There is a narrow cleft leading into the rock
to the northwest.  Two trails lead down the mountain to the southwest and the
east.

>go northwest

Narrow Cleft
You're in a dark cleft between towering walls of rock.  To the southeast lies a
trail, and there is light coming from the west.

>go west

Bottom of Cliff
You're at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you, merging with
the murky sky above.  A narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east.

You can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base
of the cliff.

>examine creature
You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for
Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a horrific
conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite unattractive. 
Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted as an
artificial brain-case.

>examine globe
It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When Morbius' brain
was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.

Only now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case!  You
search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain of Morbius. 
Looking inside the globe, you notice that the nerves which connected the
grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a laser cutter. 
Somebody has been here before you and stolen Morbius' brain!

>go east

Lakeside
You are standing before a large murky lake which stretches to the east as far as
the eye can see.  The lake water has a greenish tinge, and seems to glow
somewhat in the dim light.  A steep slope leads northwards, and a trail winds
its way through the rock to the west.

>go north

Ledge
The trail ends here at a rather small ledge which overlooks a precipitous drop
of about 30 feet.  Be careful not to lose your footing here.  Looking downwards,
you are surprised to see what looks like a flying saucer parked below you.  You
suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is in that saucer.  You can only
safely move back down the sloping trail to the south.

A signpost has been erected here.

On Top of the Saucer
You're standing on the top of a small flying saucer.  It's difficult to keep
your foothold here, as the saucer is constructed of smooth, shiny metal.  The
end of your scarf hangs down beside you from above.  The surface of the saucer
is unbroken and featureless except for what looks like a small hatch.

>open hatch with screwdriver
You point the sonic screwdriver at the hatch and turn it on, sending a sonic
burst into the hatch's locking mechanism.  After a few moments, you hear a
satisfying clunk and the hatch springs open, revealing a battery.

You lose your footing on the smooth surface of the saucer, and tumble down to
the ground below...

Plain
You're in a large area fairly clear of rocks and debris.  Unclimbable walls of
rock surround this area, but a path does lead between the rock to the northwest.
About thirty feet above you, a ledge is visible on the side of the mountain.  A
long, multi-coloured scarf dangles over the side of the ledge above, just beyond
your reach.

Rocky Clearing
You're standing on a relatively flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain.
Rocky outgrowths stand like walls all around you.  A trail through the rock is
visible to the east, while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the
mountain.

The TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.

Against the western rockface stands a massive boulder.

K9 trails in after you.

>K9 shoot boulder
That's not a verb I recognise.

>K9, shoot boulder
"Affirmative, Master."
K9's nose laser extends itself, and a shaft of green light erupts from its tip,
bathing the massive boulder in soft light.  Steam rises from its surface as it
shimmers and melts away, revealing a passageway carved into the rockface behind
it.  When K9 stops firing, all that is left of the massive boulder is a small
silvery stone.

"Warning.  Power levels low, Master."

Dark Passage
You're in a dim passage which leads into the rockface itself. Light streams in
from an opening to the east, while the passage continues to the south.

A firework lies on the dusty ground.

K9 is unable to follow you here, as the ground is too uneven.

Dark Passage
You're in a dark passage carved into the rock.  A tapestry is drawn across the
passage to the west.  Dim light comes from underneath it.  More light is visible
to the north.

You carefully draw the tapestry to one side, revealing a large chamber to the
west.

>go west

Temple of the Sisterhood of Karn
You stand in the middle of the Temple of the Sisterhood of Karn.  The light here
is very dim, with only a few candles providing light.  A throne sits on a raised
dias here.  On one wall you see a hinged metal shield, beneath which a large
golden chalice sits upon a small ledge.  There is a tapestry on the east wall,
and a closed wooden door on the south wall.  To the north, a passageway leads
out of the Temple.

You'd better watch your step here.  If the Sisterhood discover any trace of your
uninvited visit to their Sacred Temple, they won't be pleased.

From behind the closed wooden door, you hear the muffled sound of soft chanting.
 It seems the Sisters are performing one of their Sacred Ceremonies.

A Galactic servant, that's what you feel like at the moment.  You'd think that
the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for
discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were
instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their
gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn
and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's
gratitude for you.

However, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to
do as the Timelords request.  At least they gave you the coordinates for Karn,
but you did notice that they refused to give you return coordinates for
Gallifrey, saying you'd receive them once you'd procured the brain.  So much for
Gallifreyan hospitality...

Your thoughts are interrupted as you hear a familiar thud.  The TARDIS has
landed on Karn.

Workshop
This is the room where you do much of your tinkering with electronic gadgetry. 
Many a Rutan invasion or Dalek plot has been foiled by an ingenius invention
you've thrown together at last minute in this room.  In fitting with your work
habits, it's usually a rather untidy place.  However, in your latest fit of
spring cleaning you've almost emptied the place out. There's a small cupboard on
the eastern wall, and on the north wall an open door connects the workshop to
the corridor outside.

Your workbench dominates the center of the room.

You step onto the inhospitable landscape of the planet Karn. Nightmare-like

Bottom of Cliff
You're at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you, merging with
the murky sky above.  A narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east.

You can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base
of the cliff.

>examine creature
You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for
Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a horrific
conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite unattractive. 
Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted as an
artificial brain-case.

>examine globe
It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When Morbius' brain
was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.

Only now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case!  You
search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain of Morbius. 
Looking inside the globe, you notice that the nerves which connected the
grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a laser cutter. 
Somebody has been here before you and stolen Morbius' brain!

Lakeside
You are standing before a large murky lake which stretches to the east as far as
the eye can see.  The lake water has a greenish tinge, and seems to glow
somewhat in the dim light.  A steep slope leads northwards, and a trail winds
its way through the rock to the west.

>go north

Ledge
The trail ends here at a rather small ledge which overlooks a precipitous drop
of about 30 feet.  Be careful not to lose your footing here.  Looking downwards,
you are surprised to see what looks like a flying saucer parked below you.  You
suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is in that saucer.  You can only
safely move back down the sloping trail to the south.

A signpost has been erected here.

On Top of the Saucer
You're standing on the top of a small flying saucer.  It's difficult to keep
your foothold here, as the saucer is constructed of smooth, shiny metal.  The
end of your scarf hangs down beside you from above.  The surface of the saucer
is unbroken and featureless except for what looks like a small hatch.

>open hatch with screwdriver
You point the sonic screwdriver at the hatch and turn it on, sending a sonic
burst into the hatch's locking mechanism.  After a few moments, you hear a
satisfying clunk and the hatch springs open, revealing a battery.

>get battery
As you pick up the battery, you momentarily lose your footing on the surface of
the saucer and the battery flies out of your hand.  As it bounces down the sides
of the saucer, it pops open at one end spilling its acidic contents on the
ground below.

>put homing in hatch
You put the homing device into the hatch.

>close hatch
You slam the hatch shut.

[Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>go down

Plain
You're in a large area fairly clear of rocks and debris.  Unclimbable walls of
rock surround this area, but a path does lead between the rock to the northwest.
About thirty feet above you, a ledge is visible on the side of the mountain.  A
long, multi-coloured scarf dangles over the side of the ledge above, just beyond
your reach.

There is a flying saucer parked here.

The solitary form of a blackened tree stands beside the trail.

>examine tree
The withered tree looks as ancient as Karn itself.  It has seen better days,
however.  It's bark is black and twisted, and the sight of its dead branches
snaking upwards into the dark sky send a shiver down your spine.  One of the
branches looks low enough to climb.

Console Room
The console room is the heart of operations of the TARDIS. Dominating the room
is a six-side console.  Located above the console is the scanner.  A corridor to
the east leads further into the TARDIS.  On the west side of the room are the
main doors, which stand invitingly open.

You can see the TARDIS key, your yo-yo, a floppy felt hat and a tweed jacket
here.

Storage Room
This is the main storage room.  Well, technically it's supposed to be the main
storage room.  You seem to store things in the most unusual places, regarding an
actual storage room as cliche.  In fact, there's only one object stored in this
room at present.  Otherwise it's been empty for centuries.

K9 is here.

>examine K9
K9, your robot companion and trusted friend, is somewhat inert at the moment. 
On one side of him, a panel is open.

>put battery in panel
The battery pops into place.

>close panel
Click!  As you close the panel, you hear a multitude of whirring, clicking, and
buzzing sounds inside K9's body as he springs back to life.
"Thank you, Master.  Repairs complete!"

K9 zips off in the direction of the console room.

Rocky Clearing
You're standing on a relatively flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain.
Rocky outgrowths stand like walls all around you.  A trail through the rock is
visible to the east, while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the
mountain.

The TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.

Against the western rockface stands a massive boulder.

K9 zips in behind you.

>k(, shoot boulder
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>K9, shoot boulder
"Affirmative, Master."
K9's nose laser extends itself, and a shaft of green light erupts from its tip,
bathing the massive boulder in soft light.  Steam rises from its surface as it
shimmers and melts away, revealing a passageway carved into the rockface behind
it.  When K9 stops firing, all that is left of the massive boulder is a small
silvery stone.

"Warning.  Power levels low, Master."

Temple of the Sisterhood of Karn
You stand in the middle of the Temple of the Sisterhood of Karn.  The light here
is very dim, with only a few candles providing light.  A throne sits on a raised
dias here.  On one wall you see a hinged metal shield, beneath which a large
golden chalice sits upon a small ledge.  There is a tapestry on the east wall,
and a closed wooden door on the south wall.  To the north, a passageway leads
out of the Temple.

You'd better watch your step here.  If the Sisterhood discover any trace of your
uninvited visit to their Sacred Temple, they won't be pleased.

From behind the closed wooden door, you hear the muffled sound of soft chanting.
 It seems the Sisters are performing one of their Sacred Ceremonies.

>put link in chalice
The fluid link drops into the chalice with a splash.

>open shield
As you swing the shield open, you feel the heat from the Flame of Life on your
face.

>put stone in fire

clearing.  The stoney trail terminates here, leading back downwards to the west.

At the edge of the plateau sits an enormous boulder.

>push boulder
You push against the boulder with all your might and manage to roll it a few
centimeters towards the edge of the plateau, exposing a tiny space beneath it.

Storage Room
This room is very cramped, more like a large closet than a small room.  The
floor, walls and ceiling are constructed of a seamless metal.  You notice that
the gravity here is only local.  You appear to have arrived on some sort of
spaceship.  An open archway to the north leads out into a corridor.

There is a closed metal hatch in the floor here.


The TARDIS sits reassuringly nearby.

You can also see a metal table (on which are a battery-powered torch and an
electronic landmine) here.

this overwhelm your thoughts.  Not only do the Cybermen have the necessary
technology to provide a body for Morbius, Morbius has all the knowledge of the
Timelords.  This could make the Cybermen the most destructive force in the
universe!

But you can't stop to think right now.  Forunately, the Cybermen haven't noticed

"Affirmative, Master."
With a slight hum, K9's laser cannon slowly emerges from within his muzzle.  A
sharp beam of light erupts from the end of the cannon and bathes the door in
bright red light.  Suddenly the glass bubble above the door you starts flashing
and a you hear an alarm going off.  Hearing some movement behind you, you spin
around and see a Cyberman standing before you.  Before you can react, it grabs
you by the neck and squeezes...

K9's ears spin and whir...

"Cybermen: Hostile organisms originally from the planet Mondas.  Cybernetic
creatures which reproduce by conversion of humanoid lifeforms in a process
called cybernization, during which only the subject's brain remains intact,
although psychologically altered.  Cybermen were an unstoppable force in the
galaxy until the Earth-Cyber wars when it was discovered that their respirator
units could be disabled through contact with certain non-corrosive metals, hence
the invention of the Glitter Gun.  The Cybermen have since retreated to their
new homeworld of Telos, but still remain a dangerous threat to the galaxy."

Corridor
The corridor terminates here but leads back to the west.

K9 is here.

On the south wall is a seamless steel door.

Against one wall, you can see a disposal unit.

Sitting beneath the broken end of a pipe you can see a small cloth pouch (which
is open but empty).

>inventory
You are carrying:
  a gold card
  your toolkit (which is open)
    your sonic screwdriver
    a scalpel

>put gold card in unit
As you drop the gold card into the disposal unit, the machine springs to life,
producing an assortment of abrasive sounds as it digests its meal.  After a few
moments, the disposal unit grinds to a halt.

Some gleaming gold powder trickles out of the broken end of the pipe and into
the open pouch beneath.

Flight Deck
This appears to be the flight deck of the spacecraft.  The north wall consists
mostly of a large viewscreen before which sits a complex control panel.  A
rather uncomfortable-looking metal chair sits before the control panel.

A large door to the south has slid open, revealing the corridor outside.

On the metal chair is a black access card.

Strange Chamber
There's a distinctly eerie atmosphere to this small chamber.  On the far side of
the room you can see what looks like a raised dias, or platform.

A large cylindrical tank sits closed on the raised dias.  Through its
transparent sides you can see a what appears to be a large brain, immersed in a
sickly green fluid.  Beside the tank you can see some sort of apparatus.

A door to the east has slid open, revealing the corridor outside.

There's a small metal box attached to the wall here.  Above it a glass bubble
glows blue.

K9 trundles in.

A voice comes from somewhere within the tank.  "Is somebody there?"

>examine apparatus
The apparatus is not unlike the chest unit of a Cyberman.  It's basically a long
metal box with an intake vent on the top.  A thick cable leads from this
respirator to the tank beside it on the dias.

As you pour the gold powder into the respirator's vent, you hear a loud clunking
sound from within the unit.  Looking at the tank, you see the brain pulsating
and swaying madly as large air bubbles gurgle to the surface of the sickly green
fluid.  After a few moments, the brain stops pulsating and sinks lifelessly to
the bottom of the tank.

Console Room
The console room is the heart of operations of the TARDIS. Dominating the room
is a six-side console.  Located above the console is the scanner.  A corridor to
the east leads further into the TARDIS.  On the west side of the room are the
main doors, which stand invitingly open.

You can see a brown card, an incredibly long scarf, the TARDIS key, your yo-yo,
a floppy felt hat and a tweed jacket here.

disappear into the darkness.  You enter the TARDIS and close the main doors.  K9
