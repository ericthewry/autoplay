 A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the
 MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every
 citizen's head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your
 report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment
 soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover
 identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground
 struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up
 your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery
 half-existence of an underground operative, you've sabotaged, stolen,
 publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last
 mission means that a strategy to counter the government's ubiquitous
 tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

 For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner
 of the City.

 Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped,
 folded, spindled and mutilated - and it's enough to make you scream.

 Primrose Street ends here in a small circular cul-de-sac.  You're in a
 small green park to the north of this, bounded on its three other
 sides by high fences.  A few trees rise over well-manicured grass.
 There is a curfew sign at the park's entrance.

 The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over
 the low skyline.

 You can go south from here.

 A mounted sign which reads: PUBLIC SURVEILLANCE AREA.  ALL ACTIVITY

>examine me

 You're wearing basic clothing which is almost obsessively nondescript.
 You're average in nearly every physical respect - something which
 didn't win you many accolades growing up, but serves you well in your
 efforts to blend in with the conformist population through which you
 now move.

 You're wearing a backpack.
 You're carrying a multitool, a watch, and a phone.

>examine watch
>examine multitool

 A cheap digital, your watch reads 7:30 pm.


 Your pocket multitool.  Has various pliers and attachments and, in a
 pinch, can probably do 80 percent of what a full toolbox could.  One
 exception is that in order to remain legal, it doesn't have any
 cutting edges larger than your fingernail.  You are paranoid that one
 day you'll forget and try to get on an airplane with it and despite
 that fact that'll be the last you'll see of it, so you've etched a PO
 Box address and "BUSINESS REPLY MAIL" onto it.

 [The multitool is useful for prying or as a pliers.  To use it, try

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Valley of Steel</span>

 In a pervasive surveillance society, you'll dare to strike a blow for
 anonymity - but to stay free, you will need to take down the watchers.
 The creep of surveillance and control has continued unabated.  Every
 citizen is required to have a chip implant which can definitively
 identify them to anyone with a scanner.  You've spent years working
 with the underground as a hacker for hire, helping research and
 develop countermeasures to government surveillance.  You've managed to
 steal information which will help the design of a cryptographic attack
 against the Mitsui-Klein Encapsulation that every citizen carries in
 their skull, which (if it works) will render the chip inoperative.
 Your own MitKlein signature was captured during your mission, however.
 Although you did your best to wipe all records of your MitKlein
 signature from all the databases you could find, if you let your chip
 be scanned by any system it is likely that Homeland Security will be
 after you immediately.  Short term, you'll have to get off the street
 before curfew and figure out how to move around undetected - long
 term, you will have to bring the fight to Homeland Security itself.

 Visible in the distance above the surrounding buildings, the Reserve
 Bank Spacescraper is home to more than just the regional Reserve Bank.
 It is a two-hundred-level building containing all manner of businesses
 and government offices, as well as a hotel and several floors of
 extremely high-priced residential apartments.  Centrally located
 Downtown, it boasts its own Transit station and a food court in its
 lower levels.  Conventions and events are often held in its soaring
 Atrium, an open space within the building core which rises over fifty
 floors entirely indoors.  It is several miles away.

 empty house; sumac plants can be seen peeking over the top of the
 dilapidated fencing.  The fence has a plastic tarp strung behind it
 which prevents you from seeing much of the house.  To the west is a

 Today's front-page headline is: <span class="floydstyle i">Homeland Security convention to be</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">held this week at the Reserve Bank Spacescraper</span>.   "The best and
 the brightest of the various Homeland Security agencies will meet in
 the Reserve Bank Atrium this week to receive presentations on new
 security initiatives and to discuss the state of the art in security
 technology."

 The next headline reads: <span class="floydstyle i">Soldiers begin to experience</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">breakdowns.</span>
 The story itself continues: "The parents of several deployed American
 military personnel have raised concerns that their children appear to
 be losing touch with reality.  Government refutes these claims with
 statistics showing that 97.2 percent of deployed American service
 personnel are safely medicated." At the bottom, a small postscript
 reads <span class="floydstyle i">Would you like to know more?</span>  [<a href="http://bit.ly/16NZdXM">LINK</A>]

 Reading the story about the Homeland Security convention, the thought
 of all those Homeland Security drones in one place makes you grind
 your teeth.  Then, however, a vision of all those heavily-secured
 workers with dead MitKlein bottles replaces it, and you have some
 difficulty wiping the resulting smile from your face.  If only...

>read pamphlet

 It seems that the DHS believe the occupants of Apartment 1 are due to
 have a child any day now.  As such, the pamphlet is meant to inform
 them of their duty as a citizen to ensure their child has his or her
 Mitsui-Klein encapsulation properly implanted by their birth hospital.
 Along with two or three not-so-veiled hints as to the penalties for
 avoiding implantation, the pamplet also contains a very familiar
 boilerplate description of the MitKlein Bottle which you and all your
 fellow citizens carry within your skulls.  Inserted at birth, the
 MitKlein becomes embedded in the bone structure of the skull as the
 fontanelles close and harden.  It contains just enough electronics to
 act as a transponder which will identify its owner, securely, to any
 nearby chip scanner over a range of perhaps five meters or less.  The
 pamphlet cheerily explains that without such a chip, your child will
 be severely disadvantaged and unable to use basic modern services.

 The door is securely locked.

>open frosted window

 It's painted shut.

>open frosted window with multitool

 It's painted shut.

>examine window

 Which do you mean, the bedroom window or the bathroom window?

>bedroom

 A large clear two-pane window, it is locked with a latch mechanism at
 the join of the two panes.  Having the latch on the outside probably
 violates some building code somewhere.

>examine latch

 This is a fairly standard window latch.  It prevents the two
 windowpanes from sliding past one another.  The locking tab is secured
 with a cotter pin which, for some reason, is on the outside of the
 window.

 In the latch is a cotter pin.

 A generic compact fluorescent lamp, it is screwed to the table,
 presumably to prevent it falling over.

 The table lamp is currently switched off.

>unscrew lamp with multitool

 I only understood you as far as wanting to unscrew the table lamp.

>unscrew lamp

 It is fixed in place.

 This home only has the one bathroom, which means that the fact that
 it's not very clean is somewhat embarrassing.  Or at least, it would
 be if the owner had expected visitors. It contains a sink, mirror,
 toilet and shower.

 You can go south to Bedroom and west from here.

>examine window

 A very narrow window of frosted glass, it appears to be painted shut.

>examine mirror

 A mid-range but functional mirror mounted over the sink.  It has
 various illegible smudges around the edge which suggest that its owner
 uses it to write temporary notes to themself.  One corner has a small
 piece of graffiti done in black marker.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This kitchen is decorated in a style some four decades old, which is
 probably when it was last renovated.  It is fairly clean, likely
 reflecting the fact that the occupants don't cook for themselves much.
 The built-in sink takes up most of the available counter, with the
 microwave oven occupying almost all of the rest.  The refrigerator
 hulks along the opposite wall.

 You can go north to Home Office and east to Hall from here.

>put klein blaster in laptop

 That won't fit in the slot - it's the wrong shape.

>examine slot

 The chipslot is used for external storage.  Right now, its status LED
 is blinking, indicating that it has been set to autosave data, but no
 Memory chip is in the slot.

>examine microwave

 (the microwave oven)
 A microwave oven of perhaps a cubic foot capacity with a transparent
 door.  It is a relatively smart oven, able to determine the proper
 setting for whatever is placed in it using a plethora of sensors.
 There is a single button (marked "COOK") on the front. A side panel
 sports a lurid warning.  The door is ajar.

 The microwave oven is currently switched off.

>read warning

 The side panel is a small rounded rectangle of plastic with a narrow
 seam running around it.  A warning label on it reads NO USER
 SERVICEABLE PARTS INSIDE.  There is an icon of a small stick figure
 opening the panel and being electrocuted, irradiated and (as far as
 you can tell) stung by bees.

 You pry open the side panel with the pliers in your multitool,

 Opening the side panel reveals the safety limiter!

>examine safety limiter

 A small circuit board consisting of two connected chips which plugs
 into the microwave oven side panel.  One chip looks a bit like a
 standard receive chip, and the other a standard memory chip - although
 these are custom versions and can't be used as such. Examining its
 connectors and their labels, you deduce that when installed, this
 board monitors the sensors and radio frequencies inside the microwave
 oven and prevents it from operating if things like electronics are
 inside, it's empty, or the door is open.

 Valley of Steel is an interactive fiction game.  If you're new to
 intfic, you might wish to read an introductory article or two on the
 subject, such as "How to Play a Text Adventure" by Steven Granade on
 the Brass Lantern website at
 [<a href="http://brasslantern.org/beginners/playta1.html.">LINK</A>]
 In general, try using simple one or two-word (or two-phrase, really)
 commands to interact with objects in the game.  Here are a few simple
 command shortcuts to get you started.

 <span class="floydstyle i">L</span> - Look. Looks around at the general area.
 <span class="floydstyle i">X </span><span class="floydstyle something"></span> - eXamine <span class="floydstyle something">.  Describes a specific</span>
 <span class="floydstyle something">object in more detail.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle something"></span><span class="floydstyle i">N/S/E/W</span> - Move North, South, East or West, if possible.
 Interim directions also work, e.g. NE or SW.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TAKE </span><span class="floydstyle something"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">WEAR </span><span class="floydstyle something"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DROP </span><span class="floydstyle something"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN </span><span class="floydstyle something"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">PUT </span><span class="floydstyle something"> IN </span><span class="floydstyle something"></span> - attempts to insert the first
 object into the second (e.g. "PUT WALLET IN BAG".)
 <span class="floydstyle i">Z</span> - wait a turn.
 <span class="floydstyle i">G</span> - aGain: repeats the last command.

 You can also SAVE and RESTORE the game, or get HINTS (if you're
 desperate!)

 Not really a web so much as a series of maglev rings linked by guides,

 Magfield.

>wait for transit

 You see a small mouse scurry along the Transit Web and vanish back
 into the tunnels.

 Warning lights along the platform edge begin to blink rapidly.  A
 light grows in the tunnel.  With a deep moan and gust of wind, an
 express Transit Capsule blasts through Green Residential and vanishes
 into the darkness once more.

 A commuter walks by.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Platform</span>
 Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.
 Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages
 to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out
 at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated
 doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.
 The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor
 and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station
 name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into
 the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a
 Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Station</span>
 Green Commercial One's Transit station usually does most of its
 business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off
 to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well
 kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District
 organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green
 Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the
 Transit platform.

 A small circuit board consisting of two connected chips which plugs
 into the microwave oven side panel.  One chip looks a bit like a
 standard receive chip, and the other a standard memory chip - although
 these are custom versions and can't be used as such. Examining its
 connectors and their labels, you deduce that when installed, this
 board monitors the sensors and radio frequencies inside the microwave
 oven and prevents it from operating if things like electronics are
 inside, it's empty, or the door is open.

 A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the
 MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every
 citizen's head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your
 report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment
 soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover
 identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground
 struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up
 your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery
 half-existence of an underground operative, you've sabotaged, stolen,
 publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last
 mission means that a strategy to counter the government's ubiquitous
 tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

 For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner
 of the City.

 Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped,
 folded, spindled and mutilated - and it's enough to make you scream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Proletariat Bar</span>
 The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It's just far enough
 above a "dive" to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to
 cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the
 bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a
 jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here,
 communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place's name, a Public
 Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been
 framed above the bar.

 Thin music can be heard.

 You can see a Bartender and Roberto Velez here.

 This is a completely nondescript bank storefront which exists solely

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Station</span>
 Green Commercial One's Transit station usually does most of its
 business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off
 to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well
 kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District
 organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green
 Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the
 Transit platform.

 You can go south to Green Commercial Plaza North and down through the
 Green Commercial Station door (closed) to Green Commercial Platform
 from here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Platform</span>
 Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.
 Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages
 to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out
 at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated
 doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.
 The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor
 and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station
 name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into
 the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, now empty.

 You can see a Transit Map here.

 with official vehicles such as police cars, ambulances and the
 ubiquitous slightly shabby black flitters used by government agencies.
 The doors to Green Service Transit station are to the south.  Across
 the road to the east is Green Hospital's driveway.  The Hospital's
 main entrance is to the northeast.  The square continues to the north.
 To the northwest, across the road on the other side, is the front

 (the tissue generator)
 This is a medium-sized appliance found in most modern hospitals.  It
 is used to provide artificial tissue for grafting into or onto
 injuries.  In order to prevent rejection, the tissue generator must be
 given a complete scan of the patient's tissue, from which it will (by
 default) produce an exact duplicate of the scanned sample.  It has a
 button marked ACTIVATE. There is a slot on the front of the machine
 labeled INSERT CRYOPACK FOR SAMPLE where, presumably, the generated
 tissue is delivered; there is a smaller opening labeled FEED and there

 the distance)  I think I'll need to go there\x85that mission,
 though\x85(he
 stops talking suddenly and looks at you suspiciously.)"

 Ponyfriend looks up sharply, muttering "Did you hear that?" and checks
 his pager.

 With a brief flare of light from its boosters and a far-off rumble, a
 drop shuttle rises from the semiballistic pads atop the far-off
 Reserve Bank Spacescraper, vanishing into the sky.

>ask ponyfriend for paper

 You can't see any such thing.

 (Ponyfriend Chunky for the pager)
 Ponyfriend looks frightened and clutches the pager to his chest.  "No!
 You can't have it!  THEY gave it to me! How would I know They needed
 me if I gave it to you?"

 Ponyfriend wipes his pager's display with a dirty sleeve.

>examine pager

 It looks like a pretty old-school radio pager.  It also looks like it
 isn't working; the display is fogged over, there are no lights on it,
 and one of the two buttons on the front is missing. There is a small
 sliding panel on the back.

>give phone to ponyfriend

 (Ponyfriend Chunky)
 Ponyfriend clutches the cell phone and mumbles "This is so much
 better, now I can get my instructions directly rather than having to
 call them back!"  He stands there for a moment, then seems to come to
 a realization.  "In fact, they can call me!  I don't need this pager!"
 he says.

 Ponyfriend Chunky gives the pager to you.

 Ponyfriend avoids your eye.

 You open the pager, revealing a receive chip.

 Ponyfriend checks his cell phone, looking disappointed that no-one has

 up, muttering.

 Ponyfriend shakes his head violently and pushes the lost camera back
 to you.

 receive distant broadcasts, able to pull in signals from beyond a few
 meters.  There are leads on the chip for connecting data lines and a
 power source.

 A small group of people enter the store, look around, look at each
 other and file back out.

>examine shopper

 The shopper is a young woman wearing large headphones, loose clothes.
 She is bouncing her head in what is probably the rhythm of the song
 she is listening to, and seems to be paying very little attention to
 her surroundings.  Every once in a while she pulls an item from a rack
 and holds it up in front of a mirror before returning it to its place.
 She is wearing a large shoulder bag.

 The shopper is empty-handed.

 Garb-oh! is a trendy clothing shop.  Images of the shop's icon Greta
 Garbo abound, each dressed in the clothing item offered on the rack
 below it.  Jackets, scarves, bandannas, trousers, shirts and more are
 on inviting display.

 On the racks are a blue jacket, a white shirt, a green shirt, a blue
 pair of pants, and a brown pair of pants.

 The sales counter runs along the north side of the store.

 You can also see a Patrolman, Officer Prescott, the shopkeeper, and
 the shopper here.

 You can go east through the Garb-oh door (closed) to Green Commercial
 Plaza South from here.

 There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

 You hear a very quiet <span class="floydstyle em">beep</span> from somewhere you can't identify.

>examine brown pants

 Brown dungarees are never really in style, ergo they can't ever really
 be out of style either.

 There is an antitheft tag attached to the brown pair of pants.

>remove tag

 (the tag remover)
 You're not wearing that.

>remove tag from brown pants

 You can't see any such thing.

>get antitheft tag

 Which do you mean, the blue jacket's antitheft tag, the white shirt's
 antitheft tag, the green shirt's antitheft tag, the blue pair of
 pants's antitheft tag, the brown pair of pants's antitheft tag, or the
 red jacket's antitheft tag?

>get brown pants's antitheft tag

 You can't remove that bare-handed; you'll need to use the appropriate
 tool.

>get brown pants's antitheft tag with tag remover

 I only understood you as far as wanting to get the brown pair of
 pants's antitheft tag.

>remove brown pants's antitheft tag with tag remover

 You deftly remove the tag with the tag remover.

>examine tag

 (the brown pair of pants's antitheft tag)
 This is a small rubberized sealed plastic transponder, perhaps a
 centimeter thick and two by four centimeters square, with a complex
 security mechanism for attaching it to products. It is used for
 inventory control as well as theft prevention; it cannot be removed
 from a garment without the associated removal tool.

>remove blue pants's antitheft tag with tag remover

 You deftly remove the tag with the tag remover.

 The police finally search the shopper's shoulder bag, and shake their
 heads.  They lead her towards the door, one explaining that they'll
 need to take her statement at the station.  The shopkeeper asks
 snippily what they'll be doing to protect her stock; Officer Prescott
 rolls his eyes and says "Lady, we'll have our patrol stop in the plaza
 out front for a while in case this one has any accomplices, all
 right?"  They leave, and the shopkeeper watches them go with a
 somewhat irritatingly smug expression on her face.

>open tag

 Which do you mean, the blue jacket's antitheft tag, the white shirt's
 antitheft tag, the green shirt's antitheft tag, the blue pair of
 pants's antitheft tag, the brown pair of pants's antitheft tag, or the
 tag remover?

>go east

 I only understood you as far as wanting to open east.

>go east

 As you approach the autodoor, a cyclone light goes off, triggered by
 the antitheft tag you are carrying!  The attendant hurries over as a
 policeman rushes in.  The tag is swiftly found!

 A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the
 MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every
 citizen's head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your
 report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment
 soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover
 identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground
 struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up
 your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery
 half-existence of an underground operative, you've sabotaged, stolen,
 publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last
 mission means that a strategy to counter the government's ubiquitous
 tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

 For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner
 of the City.

 Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped,
 folded, spindled and mutilated - and it's enough to make you scream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Platform</span>
 Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.
 Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages
 to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out
 at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated
 doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.
 The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor
 and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station
 name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into
 the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a
 Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

 A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the
 MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every
 citizen's head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your
 report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment
 soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover
 identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground
 struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up
 your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery
 half-existence of an underground operative, you've sabotaged, stolen,
 publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last
 mission means that a strategy to counter the government's ubiquitous
 tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

 For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner
 of the City.

 Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped,
 folded, spindled and mutilated - and it's enough to make you scream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lift Lobby</span>
 The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank
 spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars
 of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the
 lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a
 large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly
 blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled
 by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.
 There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the
 street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of
 the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it,
 watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium,
 a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is
 visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from
 here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to
 the Food Court.

 You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the
 Atrium above.

 You can see a Powered Platform (on which is a spool) and the Security
 Guard here.

 You can go east to Food Court and up from here.

>examine platform

 This is a platform with motorized winches resting near the south wall.
 Judging from the equipment locked to it, it is used to clean the walls
 and windows of the Atrium.  A locked-down control winch control is at
 one end, and there is a safety railing around the edge.

 On the Powered Platform is a spool.

>stand on platform

 Before you can step up onto it, the security guard rushes over and
 shoves you away from the platform, glaring at you.

 Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.
 Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages
 to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out
 at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated
 doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.
 The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor
 and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station
 name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into
 the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a
 Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

 (the tissue generator)
 This is a medium-sized appliance found in most modern hospitals.  It
 is used to provide artificial tissue for grafting into or onto
 injuries.  In order to prevent rejection, the tissue generator must be
 given a complete scan of the patient's tissue, from which it will (by
 default) produce an exact duplicate of the scanned sample.  It has a
 button marked ACTIVATE. There is a slot on the front of the machine
 labeled INSERT CRYOPACK FOR SAMPLE where, presumably, the generated
 tissue is delivered; there is a smaller opening labeled FEED and there
 is a slot labeled READ where a tissue sampler can be inserted.
 There is a cryopack in the sample slot.  The feed slot contains biogen
 feedstock.

 The tissue generator is currently switched off.

 A rare moment of rest.  Your mission to steal specifications of the
 MitKlein Encapsulation - the ID transponder embedded in every
 citizen's head, even yours - was successful, and you transmitted your
 report to Central early this morning.   You expect a new assignment
 soon, even if it is only instructions to fall back into a cover
 identity, as you have been on the front lines of the underground
 struggle against Homeland Security nearly from the start.  Giving up
 your birth identity and life, moving instead into the flickery
 half-existence of an underground operative, you've sabotaged, stolen,
 publicized, verified and fought for years now.  Hopefully, this last
 mission means that a strategy to counter the government's ubiquitous
 tagging of citizens is being worked out at levels above your own head.

 For now, you have found yourself a small quiet park in a quiet corner
 of the City.

 Welcome to the future.  Every citizen has been scanned, chipped,
 folded, spindled and mutilated - and it's enough to make you scream.

>read it

 Today's front-page headline is: <span class="floydstyle i">Homeland Security convention to be</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">held this week at the Reserve Bank Spacescraper</span>.   "The best and
 the brightest of the various Homeland Security agencies will meet in
 the Reserve Bank Atrium this week to receive presentations on new
 security initiatives and to discuss the state of the art in security
 technology."

 The next headline reads: <span class="floydstyle i">Soldiers begin to experience</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">breakdowns.</span>
 The story itself continues: "The parents of several deployed American
 military personnel have raised concerns that their children appear to
 be losing touch with reality.  Government refutes these claims with
 statistics showing that 97.2 percent of deployed American service
 personnel are safely medicated." At the bottom, a small postscript
 reads <span class="floydstyle i">Would you like to know more?</span>  [<a href="http://bit.ly/16NZdXM">LINK</A>]

 Reading the story about the Homeland Security convention, the thought
 of all those Homeland Security drones in one place makes you grind
 your teeth.  Then, however, a vision of all those heavily-secured
 workers with dead MitKlein bottles replaces it, and you have some
 difficulty wiping the resulting smile from your face.  If only...

 [If you want to read the pamphlet (as opposed to just looking at it)

>read it

 It seems that the DHS believe the occupants of Apartment 1 are due to
 have a child any day now.  As such, the pamphlet is meant to inform
 them of their duty as a citizen to ensure their child has his or her
 Mitsui-Klein encapsulation properly implanted by their birth hospital.
 Along with two or three not-so-veiled hints as to the penalties for
 avoiding implantation, the pamplet also contains a very familiar
 boilerplate description of the MitKlein Bottle which you and all your
 fellow citizens carry within your skulls.  Inserted at birth, the
 MitKlein becomes embedded in the bone structure of the skull as the
 fontanelles close and harden.  It contains just enough electronics to
 act as a transponder which will identify its owner, securely, to any
 nearby chip scanner over a range of perhaps five meters or less.  The
 pamphlet cheerily explains that without such a chip, your child will
 be severely disadvantaged and unable to use basic modern services.

 west.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors, with
 each person turning their head to the right as they approach for the
 eye scanner to verify their identity before opening the portal long
 enough for them to slip through.  The floor and walls are both clean
 duramex nanotile, and the station name (Reserve Bank) is indicated on
 large plaques set into the walls.  At either end of the platform,
 closed gates guard against any entry into the slideway tunnels. A
 platform abuts a Transit web, where a Transit capsule can be seen

 several food stand franchises, some doing a brisk business.  Hundreds
 of people are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lift Lobby</span>
 The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank
 spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars
 of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the
 lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a
 large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly
 blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled
 by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.
 There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the
 street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of
 the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it,
 watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium,
 a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is
 visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from
 here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to
 the Food Court.

 You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the
 Atrium above.

 You can see a Powered Platform (on which is a spool) and the Security

 He's dressed in a standard security guard outfit.  It appears his job
 is keep people from fiddling with the ashtrays or perhaps the fake
 plants.

 The Security Guard is empty-handed.

>examine platform

 This is a platform with motorized winches resting near the south wall.
 Judging from the equipment locked to it, it is used to clean the walls
 and windows of the Atrium.  A locked-down control winch control is at
 one end, and there is a safety railing around the edge.

 On the Powered Platform is a spool.

>examine spool

 A metal spool of what appears to be very strong cable, with a winding
 mechanism at its center.  The mechanism is locked.  There is a
 carabiner at the end of the cable, but it's locked into the spool.  It
 is attached to the platform's winch frame with several locking clamps.

>examine control

 A simple control panel, used for winding or unwinding cables and thus
 raising or lowering the platform.  It seems to be shut off.  A keylock
 is set to "OFF."

 The winch control is currently switched on.

>switch winch control off

 You switch the winch control off.

>examine control

 A simple control panel, used for winding or unwinding cables and thus

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lift Lobby</span>
 The Lift Lobby controls underground access to the Reserve Bank
 spacescraper, beneath the towers of industry and capital made pillars
 of money and sin.  Hundreds of people rush to and fro through the
 lobby on their way into or out of the building.  To the north is a
 large bank of bouncelifts, their liftfields on and glowing faintly
 blue behind security gates.  Access to the bouncelifts is controlled
 by Lift Scanners, set above and to the right of each bouncelift entry.
 There is no ceiling; several meters up, the room opens out into the
 street level lobby above.  There is a railing around the perimeter of
 the floor above; several people are leaning against or over it,
 watching the flow of commuters below them and around you.  The Atrium,
 a wide open area extending at least halfway up the spacescraper, is
 visible above that. There is no way to reach the street lobby from
 here other than via the bouncelifts. A shallow ramp leads east down to
 the Food Court.

 You can hear the confused murmur of a large crowd coming from the
 Atrium above.

 You can see a Powered Platform (on which is a spool) and the Security
 Guard here.

 You can go east to Food Court and up from here.

>ask guard about roberto

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Food Court</span>
 The center of the Food Court beneath the Reserve Bank spacescraper is
 a busy place at all times of the day.  Around the periphery are
 several food stand franchises, some doing a brisk business.  Hundreds
 of people are here waiting in line at the food stands, sitting at the
 dozens of tables in the center, or just passing through from the
 Reserve Bank Station to the Lift Lobby up a ramp to the west or vice
 versa.  The floor is made of duramex tiles.

 You can see a trash can (closed) here.

 You can go north to Reserve Bank Bistro Paris, northeast to I Have No
 Mouth, northwest to Maintenance Area, south to Tacos Terriff,
 southeast to The Sheep Look Up, southwest to Apollo's, east to Station

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Station Corridor</span>
 The corridor widens as it terminates at the automatic doors to the
 Reserve Bank Station, which lies to the east.  There is a directory
 and guide sign on the wall.  Although traffic is overwhelmingly to the
 west, there are two doors reserved for traffic into the station,
 indicated by green lightbars overhead, whose access scanners are
 active.

 You can see a directory here.

 You can go east through the Reserve Bank Station door (closed) to

 The Eye Scanner probes your eye and deducts Transit fare from the
 account associated with your iris pattern.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reserve Bank Station</span>
 The Reserve Bank Transit Station. The platform opens out at the middle
 to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated doors to the
 west.  The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors, with
 each person turning their head to the right as they approach for the
 eye scanner to verify their identity before opening the portal long
 enough for them to slip through.  The floor and walls are both clean
 duramex nanotile, and the station name (Reserve Bank) is indicated on
 large plaques set into the walls.  At either end of the platform,
 closed gates guard against any entry into the slideway tunnels. A
 platform abuts a Transit web, now empty.

 You can see a Transit Map here.

 You can go west through the Reserve Bank Station door to Station
 Corridor from here.

 The automatic door slides closed.

>wait for transit

 A light grows in the tunnel.  With a deep thrumming and the whoosh of
 displaced air, the Transit Capsule slides smoothly into Reserve Bank
 Station and comes to a stop, hovering in the Web.  The doors slide
 open and a few commuters enter and exit the capsule.
 A few commuters get on and off the Transit capsule.

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Transit Capsule</span>
 A fifty-person maglev Transit capsule.  You're standing, holding on to
 a strap.  Through the windows you can see the Reserve Bank Station.

 There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

 A few commuters get on and off the Transit capsule.

>wait 5 minutes

 A few commuters get on and off the Transit capsule.

 The capsule doors slide shut.  The humming noice increases in volume,
 and the capsule slides out of the station, gathering speed as it goes,
 and slides into the tunnel.

 You hold onto your strap as the Capsule rapidly accelerates.

 With a deep thrumming and the whoosh of displaced air, the Transit
 Capsule slides smoothly into Green Commercial Platform and comes to a
 stop, hovering in the Web.  The doors slide open and a few commuters

 It is now 8:51 am.

 A few commuters get on and off the Transit capsule.

>go south

 You exit the Transit capsule.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Platform</span>
 Green Commercial One is one of the oldest stations on the Transit web.
 Although it has been refurbished several times, its age still manages
 to show through the layers of tile and paint.  The platform opens out
 at the middle to a lobby area which is dominated by a row of automated
 doors to the south, which lead to stairways up to the main station.
 The flow of commuters moves steadily through these doors.  The floor
 and walls are both extremely scuffed duramex nanotile, and the station
 name (Green Commercial One) is indicated on a large plaque set into
 the walls. The platform abuts the Transit web to the north, where a
 Transit capsule can be seen hovering.  The capsule doors are open.

 You can see a Transit Map here.

 You can go south through the Green Commercial Station door (closed) to

>go south

 (first opening the Green Commercial Station door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Station</span>
 Green Commercial One's Transit station usually does most of its
 business around the rush hours, as Green Residental commuters stop off
 to take care of errands.  The station is relatively small, but well
 kept up - the Green Commercial Business Improvement District
 organization sees to that.  Open doorways lead south to Green
 Commercial One proper, and a stairway leads down to the doors to the
 Transit platform.

 You can go south to Green Commercial Plaza North and down through the
 Green Commercial Station door to Green Commercial Platform from here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Plaza North</span>
 Green Commercial One is built around a plaza, and this is its northern
 end.  No vehicles are permitted within the public areas of Green
 Commercial One, so the entire area is pedestrian-only.  To the north
 are the doorways to the Green Commercial Station.  To the east is the
 NanoMart.  To the west is a storefront bank with an ATM.  The plaza
 continues to the south.

 The Reserve Bank Spacescraper is visible in the distance, rising over
 the low skyline.

 You can also see a trash can (in which is some rubbish) here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Proletariat Bar</span>
 The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It's just far enough
 above a "dive" to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to
 cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the
 bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a
 jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here,
 communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place's name, a Public
 Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been
 framed above the bar.

 Thin music can be heard.

 it.  I will have to let them dock my pay for months."

 A dark blue jacket, very bland cut, with black snap closures and side

 breast in gold thread.  It's probably a size too large for you.

 There is an antitheft tag attached to the blue jacket.

>cut tag

 Which do you mean, the brown pair of pants's antitheft tag, the blue

 (the blue jacket's antitheft tag)
 This is a small rubberized sealed plastic transponder, perhaps a

 from a garment without the associated removal tool.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Proletariat Bar</span>
 The Proletariat is a local bar (not a pub).  It's just far enough
 above a "dive" to be allowed zoning here, but steadfastedly refuses to
 cater to upscale tastes.  You like it.  Restrooms are to the east; the
 bar runs along the north side with a stolid bartender behind it and a
 jukebox sits against the back wall.  A few hardy drinkers sit here,
 communing with their spirits.  In a nod to the place's name, a Public
 Surveillance Notice covered with stickers and graffiti tags has been
 framed above the bar.

 Thin music can be heard.

 You can see Roberto Velez and a Bartender here.

 You can go northwest to Green Commercial Plaza North, southwest to

>give jacket to roberto

 (the blue jacket to Roberto Velez)
 Roberto stands up and eagerly examines the blue jacket.  "This would
 be a perfect replacement!" he says enthusiastically, showing you how
 closely it resembles his torn uniform jacket.  "Would you be willing
 to part with it? I cannot give you much, but I would happily pay you
 what I can; it will be less than what those dogs would take from my
 salary to replace this one!" He pats his pockets, then shakes his
 head.  "I need to go to the ATM."  With that, he stands up.

 Roberto Velez goes northwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Green Commercial Plaza North</span>
 Green Commercial One is built around a plaza, and this is its northern

 Commercial One, so the entire area is pedestrian-only.  To the north

 NanoMart.  To the west is a storefront bank with an ATM.  The plaza

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Metro Savings</span>
 This is a completely nondescript bank storefront which exists solely
 to house an ATM.  It's so nondescript, in fact, that it took you some
 actual effort to determine which bank owns it, probably to ensure that
 they can charge you access fees no matter what.  To the east is Green
 Commercial Plaza.

 Roberto approaches the ATM, intent on withdrawing funds to pay you for
 the blue jacket.
 He looks at the ATM's cracked palm reader, then at you.  "The ATM
 scanner, he is broken."  He shakes his head.

 This is a standard palm reader, which is used to verify the identity

 "KAPUT" in black marker.

>examine roberto

 (Roberto Velez)
 A medium-height man of middle age and dark but somewhat pasty-looking
 skin.  His hair, black and cut short, is just beginning to grey at the
 temples.  His hands are rough and callused.  He is wearing work shoes
 and dark blue trousers, slightly scuffed.  He is wearing a dark blue
 trade uniform jacket with a long narrow gash at the left shoulder and
 his name (Roberto Velez) on a tag clipped to the breast.

 Roberto Velez is empty-handed.

 A normal-looking Metro Policeman, Prescott is wearing light patrol
 gear with his holobadge displaying his name and rank across his left
 breast. Every once in a while, the comm unit attached to his belt
 murmurs to him through his earpiece. At the moment, he's sitting at a

>examine lost camera

 A cheap piece of integral electronics, made cheaper by the fact that
 any portable or phone has a perfectly good camera in it.  It has a
 built-in flash, and is typically linked to a cell phone or other
 handheld for displaying and storing photos.  This camera has been
 cracked open, revealing its internal electronics.  A capacitor (for

 A Tesla-Fujiwara light aircraft, the police model of this particular
 flitter is upengined in order to carry armor and equipment.  Seating
 four, this example has the full lighting array and riot pod of a crowd

 A police officer ambles out of Green Commercial Bistro Paris.  As he

 disables the locklarm.
 He then climbs into the flitter and shuts the door.  A few moments

 This is a branch of the popular lunch and coffee shop Bistro Paris.
 There are a few tables near the front.  A restroom is to the west.  On
 the north wall, opposite the counter, is a collection of Paris-themed
 prints.  In the center is a large holoportrait of the chain's owner,
 Zuzu, and a sign claiming that the Bistro Paris has restaurants here,
 in the Reserve Bank Spacescraper, and in London.  A server behind the
 counter is waiting on several customers.

 You can see Officer Prescott and a trash can (in which is some
 rubbish) here.

 You can go northeast to Green Commercial Plaza North, southeast to
 Green Commercial Plaza South, east to Green Commercial Plaza Center,
 and west to Bistro Paris Restroom from here.

 There is a Public Surveillance Notice here.

 The police officer finishes his coffee, tosses his trash in a bin and
 ambles out of the bistro.  You hear the sound of flitter turbines
 spooling up outside and then fading away.
