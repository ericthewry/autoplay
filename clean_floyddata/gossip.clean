 A cold wind brushes the edge of your consciousness, and your deadened
 senses blur the images and feelings trying to reach your brain.  Harsh
 moonlight lighting shattered glass... water rippling somewhere
 nearby... a dark shape in the shadows... the howling of a lone wolf...
 and blood.  Red, red blood.

 By the Lake
 The cold finally manages to break through the haze, and forces your
 mind back to consciousness.  All around you is baren ground, broken
 only by small, rolling hills.  At your feet, a small lake lies
 unnaturally still, a crystal mirror holding the image of the red moon
 above.  The path leading home lies to the east, while an unknown path
 leads into impenetrable mist northward.





>examine lake
 The surface of the lake is unnaturally still, but there is an odd
 sense of movement just underneath, and a soft rippling music barely
 reaches your ears.  Your reflection flickers weirdly, made brighter by
 the liquid moon trapped in the surface of crystal.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine moon
 She told you once the moon was God's eye.  It was just a fairytale, of
 course... but still, it's hauntingly fitting that tonight the moon is
 red.  Blood red.

>examine mist
 The mist lies just outside your awareness, and resists any attempts to
 interact with it.

>examine me
 You are sore and bloody, but your physical wounds are nothing compared
 to the torment your mind is going through.

>drink water
 You take the shimmering liquid in cupped hands and sip, and the cold
 cuts through you like a knife.

 The wind cries softly, but what makes it worse is that you hear her
 tears in the wind.

>listen
 So many voices tonight.  The wind, the earth, the water, the sky...
 they all have voices.  And her voice is in each of theirs.

>listen to wind
 The wind refuses to comfort you, its soft moan incessantly reminding
 you of things you cannot undo.

>undo
 By the Lake
 [Previous turn undone.]

>listen to her
 I'm not sure what "her" refers to.

>listen to earth
 You can't see any such thing.

>listen to the earth
 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lake
 The surface of the lake is unnaturally still, but there is an odd
 sense of movement just underneath, and a soft rippling music barely
 reaches your ears.  Your reflection flickers weirdly, made brighter by
 the liquid moon trapped in the surface of crystal.

 The wind whips madly through the hills and over the lake, chastising
 you.

>look into the lake
 You find nothing of interest.

>feel lake
 Your touch disturbs the placid surface, causing ripples to mar the
 image of the moon.

>examine me in lake
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine yourself.

>examine reflection
 Which do you mean, the moon's reflection or your reflection?

>your
 You can't see any such thing.

>your reflection
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine your reflection
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine my reflection
 Your faced is mirrored back to you with perfect clarity, and what you
 see frightens you.  It is not your face anymore; it is another's.  It
 is his face.

>think
 What a good idea.

 The wind dies down to a whisper, as if it has exhausted its anger and
 now offers you comfort.

>listen to lake
 A faint music reaches your ears, but the language of the water is not
 your own.

>look
 By the Lake
   All around you is baren ground, broken only by small, rolling hills.
 At your feet, a small lake lies unnaturally still, a crystal mirror
 holding the image of the red moon above.  The path leading home lies
 to the east, while an unknown path leads into impenetrable mist
 northward.





 The wind whispers again, but you shut your ears, refusing to be
 comforted.

>examine moon's reflection
>examine lake reflection
 A perfect image of the moon above you, thanks to the water the
 reflection possesses a startling quality of translucence that the real
 moon does not have.

 The wind whispers again, but you shut your ears, refusing to be
 comforted.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the pond.

>examine ground
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine hills
 Mounds of dirt is all they really are, but they have a presence that
 is both comforting and ominious.  With them you are not alone, but
 they remind you that they have been and always will be, while you will
 pass away.

 The wind whispers again, but you shut your ears, refusing to be
 comforted.

 A mist lies over the north path, concealing whatever lies beyond.

>listen to wind
 The wind refuses to comfort you, its soft moan incessantly reminding
 you of things you cannot undo.

 The wind whispers again, but you shut your ears, refusing to be
 comforted.

>listen to hills
 She used to tell you that everything has a voice, if you would only
 listen.  Tonight, it almost seems she was right, for you can feel
 something calling to you.  Whether it is a voice from the earth, or
 whether your sanity is beginning to fray is a different question.

>examine moon
 She told you once the moon was God's eye.  It was just a fairytale, of
 course... but still, it's hauntingly fitting that tonight the moon is
 red.  Blood red.

 The wind whispers again, but you shut your ears, refusing to be
 comforted.

>listen to moon
 The moon is the one thing that you hear nothing from.  No voice, no
 song... only silence.

>examine lake
 The surface of the lake is unnaturally still, but there is an odd
 sense of movement just underneath, and a soft rippling music barely
 reaches your ears.  Your reflection flickers weirdly, made brighter by
 the liquid moon trapped in the surface of crystal.

>listen to my reflection
 You listen, and with horror you realize that the water holds not only
 his face, but his voice as well.

>listen to his voice
 You can't see any such thing.

>listen to myself
 You can no longer seperate your voice from his.

>listen to voice

 What do you want to drink?

 cuts through you like a knife.

 The wind whispers again, but you shut your ears, refusing to be
 comforted.

>speak
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>listen to wind
 The wind's voice is silent, as if it no longer wishes to speak to you.

 The wind whispers again, but you shut your ears, refusing to be
 comforted.

 The mist lies just outside your awareness, and resists any attempts to

 A mist lies over the north path, concealing whatever lies beyond.

 You ignore the beckoning north path, and travel east to home and
 sanity.








 Cabin
 You come to consciousness in a dark, dusty room.  In the corner, the
 machine is still smoking, surrounded by shards of glass from the
 window above.  In the center of the room she lies...  Oh God.  You
 never meant to hurt her.  To the west lies a splintering wooden door,
 beside which is an old shovel.








>examine her
 Lovely Elizibeth.  Things weren't supposed to end this way - you two
 were to be happy together, after your success.  But now the most you
 can do for her is see that her remains rest in piece.

>examine shovel
 Strong wood and cold metal.

>examine shovel
 Strong wood and cold metal.

>take shovel
 As you take the shovel in hand, a tear finds its way down your face.
 The task before you will be hard to bear.

>examine glass
 Long, sharp slivers, broken from the window pane during the accident.

>examine machine
 The culmination of all your years of research lies broken in the
 corner.  After all those years of being mocked by your peers and being
 called a madman by your family...  She was the only one who believed
 in you.  And you were right; it worked.  But in the end, it took her
 from you.

>examine woman
 You can't see any such thing.

 You find nothing of interest.

>look
 Cabin
 This is the room you did the experiments in.  In the corner is that
 cursed machine, and above it the broken window.  You cannot bear to
 look at what lies in the center of the room on the floor, broken and
 dead.  To the west lies a splintering wooden door, beside which is an
 old shovel.







>hug her
 You can only do that to something animate.

>take machine
 That's hardly portable.

>examine door
 So many times she passed through that door... only once more, and this
 time she holds death's hand instead of yours.

>take her
 You wipe the blood from her face, and tenderly take her in your arms.

>examine her
 Lovely Elizibeth.  Things weren't supposed to end this way - you two
 were to be happy together, after your success.  But now the most you
 can do for her is see that her remains rest in piece.

 You can't go that way.

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>go west
 You can't, since the cabin door is in the way.

>go west

>open door
 You open the cabin door.

>go west

 Outside the Cabin
 Everything is just like it was before, and yet... there is a
 difference, as if the earth somehow knows that she no longer walks
 upon it, and the sun realizes it shines on her no more.  Only the tree
 she planted nearby retains its luster.



>examine tree
 You sense her presence around this tree, as if she left part of
 herself with it when she departed.

>listen to tree
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>drop her
 Dropped.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a shovel

>climb tree
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>bury her
 After one last kiss, you return her to the earth she loved so much.

 Your living room is sparesely furnished, with only a few pieces of
 furniture, and nothing resembling luxury.  She always said your house

 unnaturally still, a crystal mirror holding the image of the red moon

 You cannot resist the call of the misted path, and so travel north,
 leaving behind you that which is known and embracing the unknowable.

>sink permenantly into your inner torment
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>get glass
 The glass glitters dangerously in your hand, as if it wants to claim
 your very soul.

>cut yourself
 You draw the gleaming edge across your skin, bringing blood.  Red, red
 blood.

 You draw the gleaming edge across your skin, bringing blood.  Red, red

 You don't suspect the blood would go down too well.

>take shovel
 As you take the shovel in hand, a shudder runs through you.  She knows
 what you are going to do.

>hit me
 You already have that.
 (first taking the broken glass)
 You draw the gleaming edge across your skin, bringing blood.  Red, red
 blood.

>go west
 You can't, since the cabin door is in the way.

>examine her
 Blood swirls around her ashen face, and a smile seems to play at the
 corner of her cold lips.  As long as she is here, you know that she
 will haunt you.

>cut her
 Cutting that up would achieve little.

>examine machine
 It hulks in the corner like an evil beast, ready to strike.  It was
 the cause of this; it stole your face and took her from you...  And
 still it lives.  You can almost see eyes peering from the darkness
 where you know none are.  But something is different - it is broken
 and powerless now.

 All that remains of the window is a dark void.  Where light once

 Black, soulless metal.

 You open the cabin door.

>go west

 Outside the Cabin
 This used to be your Eden, but now all is baren desert.  Even the tree

 Glittering white sand stretches as far as the eye can see, the only
 mark upon it his footsteps.

 Footprints in the sand lead away from the cabin towards the lake.  His
 footprints.  Your footprints.

 You feel her presence around the tree, as if it swallowed her spirit
 when he took her life.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Deeply absorbed in your thoughts, remembering yesterday's party, you
 vaguely contemplate the coils ascending from your coffee cup.  You're
 still drowsy, but that's why you're drinking a coffee. You went to the
 office early this morning, although the cocktail party last night made
 it hard to get up... But you didn't waste your time, because you
 picked up valuable information there.

 Ah, here's the boss.  Sammy, coat and briefcase in hand, smiles at
 you. Christine follows him in, and you guess this is the normal
 routine.  It's not your habit to get up this early, but you know
 they're always the first people at the newspaper office. Sammy strides
 to his office to drop off his things; Christine comes over to say
 hello.

 "How are you doing ?"
 "Well, I drank a bit too much yesterday at a cocktail party, but it's
 not too bad. What about you ?"
 "Oh, I'm fine, thanks."

 She smiles timidly at you, then goes to her office. As Christine
 enters her office, Sammy exits his.

 "Sofia!  Good to see you in bright and early. I've got an assignment
 for you."

 You sigh, and gulp a bit of your coffee.  A regular day at work is
 beginning.

 Gossip
 An interactive report by Hugo Labrande
 Type "info" for the info menu.
 Release 1 / Serial number 090829 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11

 Editorial office of "Tittle-Tattle Kettle"
 "Tittle-Tattle Kettle, your teatime's long-brewed, boiling gossip!"
 You always thought this motto was a little bit silly, but it's quite
 original after all; it didn't stop this magazine to grow. In fact,
 sales are good, and the paper shows its difference from its rivals
 with a certain sense of ethics and reflexion - it still is a gossip
 magazine, but let's say that you take advantage of a higher status
 than your rivals. The editorial office is at the sixteenth floor of
 the building. Westwards, the window gives you a great view of the
 city; near it there's the coffee dispenser and metal tables.
 Eastwards, it's Sammy's office; your office is somewhere to the north,
 and if you want to leave there's an elevator at the south.

 Sammy is here.

>talk to sammy
 "We've got an article to write in the next issue about Kymberley
 Spicey, the starlet... An article written for women in particular, so
 we have to focus on shape and physique." Sammy lifts his hand in
 advance. "Shush, I know what you're gonna say, we talked about it,
 stop it."

 You smile: more than once you have had feverish discussions with
 Sammy, and sometimes about this topic. He keeps saying that, speaking
 of magazine sales, men don't want to know about defects of sexually
 arousing blonde babes, while women are more interested in them. You
 argue that trying to reach women this way contributes to making them
 feel guilty by childishly pointing at little imperfections and
 reffering to them as defects. He argues that it's a way to break the
 ideology of the perfect woman that every media wants to create and
 make you believe in. This could go on for hours - you both are equally
 stubborn - and nobody is gonna change their mind. You both decided to
 limit the frequency of such discussions. He's the boss, he decides,
 you execute; but meanwhile you prepare new arguments for the next of
 these delightful conversations...

>press enter
 "Anyway, we have to get a few photos of the lady in her everyday life,
 and speaking of this, I was told that she goes jogging every morning
 at nine o'clock."
 You look at the time and sigh in a tired way. "So, I've got a little
 more than an hour to go to her neighbourhood and take photos of her in
 her jogging clothes?"
 "Yep."
 "All right, I'm going there..."
 Sammy gives you the address of your target with a tiny smile: he knows
 you don't like to do it, but it's your job after all. Well, you don't
 have to do this every day, thankfully. A trip to the city, a few
 photos of a plastic sexy blonde, and this afternoon you'll be able to
 write your article about last night. You'll be on your way after
 getting your camera. The address is Meadows Heights, quite far from
 downtown, in a chic neighbourhood.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a red checked shirt (being worn)
   a coffee cup
   a mobile phone

>examine sammy
 Sammy Garland, editor, and also creator of TTK. Your boss is quite
 cool; he's a hairy little man, chubby as a teddy bear, but you respect
 him a lot. He's a really good editor, because he understands the
 business while giving it a bit of his convictions, which gave the
 magazine this image of a gossip magazine with a clear and commited
 opinion.

>examine shirt
 You're wearing a red checked shirt. Simple, but still, quite nice.

>examine coffee
 (the coffee cup)
 The coffee cup you just took from the coffee dispenser. Still hot.

>examine phone
 It's your mobile phone, the one you got a few months ago. It's a
 multifunction high-tech top-of-the-technology thing, with camera,
 video mode, dictaphone, music player, etc., etc. You aren't gonna use
 half of its functionnalities, but who does? It's a flip phone, so you
 have to open it to use it.

 You launch the game circumspectly. It's a game where you shoot on
 terrorists - it was in the phone when you bought it...

 The screen loads, you choose "New Game". Your mobile struggles to load
 3D models, and freezes. Great, now you have to switch it off and start
 it again... Pff...

 Editorial office of "Tittle-Tattle Kettle"
 "Tittle-Tattle Kettle, your teatime's long-brewed, boiling gossip!"
 You always thought this motto was a little bit silly, but it's quite
 original after all; it didn't stop this magazine to grow. In fact,
 sales are good, and the paper shows its difference from its rivals
 with a certain sense of ethics and reflexion - it still is a gossip
 magazine, but let's say that you take advantage of a higher status
 than your rivals. The editorial office is at the sixteenth floor of
 the building. Westwards, the window gives you a great view of the
 city; near it there's the coffee dispenser and metal tables.
 Eastwards, it's Sammy's office; your office is somewhere to the north,
 and if you want to leave there's an elevator at the south.

 Sammy is here.

>ask sammy about Kymberley
 "I told you, she jogs in Meadows Heights every morning. You know what
 she looks like, don't you?  Yet another thin blonde knock-out with
 huge breasts - every man's fantasy. Until the next one, of course. She
 hasn't been seen publicly much recently.  My sources told me she's put
 on a few kilos.  One published photo of her bulge, and we can sell
 every woman proof that their men's latest fantasy has a little extra
 fat." Sammy chuckles. "Another useless article - one that's been made
 a thousand times before, but it fills the magazine and makes everyone
 happy."

>ask sammy about rebecca
 "I really don't know."

>ask sammy about magazine
 "Sales are good, no problem..."

>ask sammy about me
 "As always, you're very well dressed!"

>say "I beg your pardon?"
 (to Sammy Garland)
 There is no reply.

>go north

 Your office
 You're one of the few journalists to have an office at the editorial
 office of "Tittle-Tattle Kettle"; the magazine hires copywriters and
 free-lance journalists, but you have your own office to write your
 articles. Nothing special about the room itself: all messed up, papers
 everywhere on the desk, your computer and a few chairs. It's your base
 camp, where you go to write your articles, to sort photos, to search
 information, in a nutshell: to do your job.

 You can see a camera here.

>examine camera
 Your professional camera. You became progressively expert in
 photographs, becoming quicker and more precise, and mastering every
 mode and switch for an optimal quality. Well, as optimal as possible,
 because the quality of a papparazzi photo isn't great, of course. You
 like having it with you, although photos became less important
 recently in your career since you're now focusing on collecting
 information.

>take camera
 Taken.

>shoot sammy

>take photo
 There's nothing worth photographing here.

>examine city
 By the window, at the sixteenth floor, you can see a great part of the
 city. The building's neighbourhood isn't exactly buzzing, contrary to
 downtown streets filled with noises and cars, but you can at times see
 some cars and taxis in front of the building. Far away, you can see
 the hills around the city, with celebrities' luxuous villas hidden
 behind the trees.

>drink coffee
 (the coffee cup)
 You drink your coffee and throw the cup in one of the bins around
 there.

 Sammy gazes at you.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a camera
   a red checked shirt (being worn)
   a mobile phone

>take off shirt
 You don't want to be naked here.

 Your flat
 This is your little flat with two rooms, downtown. Rather functional
 and bright, you really like it. In the sitting-room, there's a table,
 a few chairs, and a sofa: that's where you usually work. The kitchen
 is westwards, and your bedroom and the bathroom are eastwards.

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine sofa
 Your old sofa, brought from your parents' house. He can be used as a
 bed for guests, but since you've got a more comfortable king size bed
 your best friend doesn't sleep there anymore when she comes.

>look under it
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine table
 A wooden table made of teck, upon which you often work or eat. It
 comes from a scandinavian furniture seller, and is very solid.

>examine chairs
 These are wooden chair, on which you sit to work on the table.

>sit on chair
 You don't feel the need to rest.

>go west
 You have nothing to do in the kitchen for now.

>go east

 Your bedroom
 Your bedroom's furniture are essentially your king-size bed and your
 bedside table. In a corner of the room, near the window, there's a
 cupboard with your clothes. The bathroom is to the south, your
 sitting-room to the west.

>examine bed
 It's your king size bed, but nothing in particular to say about it.

>examine cupboard
 Your big wooden cupboard, containing all your wardrobe, which is
 enough to fill it.

>examine clothes
 You're wearing a red checked shirt. Simple, but still, quite nice.

>open cupboard
 Among the clothes you own, there are a few you'd like to wear today...

 Your bedroom
 Your bedroom's furniture are essentially your king-size bed and your
 bedside table. In a corner of the room, near the window, there's a
 cupboard with your clothes. The bathroom is to the south, your
 sitting-room to the west.

>examine me
 You're tall, red-headed, quite thin, and pretty, or so they say;
 you're a perfectly normal twenty-six-year old young woman. A reporter
 for the "Tittle-Tattle Kettle" for a few years now, you're known to be
 tenacious, frank and clear-headed. You'd agree with that.
 You're wearing a white blouse. Quite simple, but it fits you quite
 good, and it's low-cut in order to make you look very attractive.

>examine window
 You can see the street by the window. A few cars sometimes pass, but
 generally it's a quiet neighbourhood.

>go south
 You have nothing to do in the bathroom for now.

>go west

 Your flat
 This is your little flat with two rooms, downtown. Rather functional
 and bright, you really like it. In the sitting-room, there's a table,
 a few chairs, and a sofa: that's where you usually work. The kitchen
 is westwards, and your bedroom and the bathroom are eastwards.

 Meadows Heights
 Meadows Heights' neighbourhood is quite a fancy one; today it's sunny
 and not too hot yet. There's a beautiful and quiet park to the south:
 if your information are correct Kymberley Spicey is running there. You
 can go back to the north.

 Your professional camera. You became progressively expert in
 photographs, becoming quicker and more precise, and mastering every

 because the quality of a papparazzi photo isn't great, of course. You

 recently in your career since you're now focusing on collecting

 Meadows Park isn't a tropical forest, but still it's a quite big and

 As you enter the park, Kymberley Spicey, the one and only, runs in
 front of you! You try to take your camera, but too late. Darn, now
 you'll have to run after her.

 Sammy is here.


 Your office
 You're one of the few journalists to have an office at the editorial
 office of "Tittle-Tattle Kettle"; the magazine hires copywriters and
 free-lance journalists, but you have your own office to write your
 articles. Nothing special about the room itself: all messed up, papers
 everywhere on the desk, your computer and a few chairs. It's your base
 camp, where you go to write your articles, to sort photos, to search
 information, in a nutshell: to do your job.

 Sofia - can you send me these by e-mail?"
 "Right away, boss."

 at them and you erase the blurry or useless photos. You send the

 Oh yeah, you have to write your article about yesterday's cocktail
 party. You do it without thinking: the night wasn't so interesting,
 well in fact as interesting as usual... These kinds of articles you
 can write for each issue, to fill the pages... But anyway you do your
 best to write something good: you ask a lot of questions, write a lot
 of understatements, hypothesis... Even the slightest information can
 fill a paragraph, if you know how to do this job.

 Once it's finished, you switch your computer off and go home.

>look







 This is your life. Funny job, when you think about it. One one hand
 you can see it as a shameless intrusion into people's private lives.
 You hide to take photos, always get second-hand information, spread
 some more information, spread the rumor. In the public field, your job
 is really not well perceived.

 But on the other hand, in the private field, it's very differently
 perceived. The moral instinct of every man and woman is to criticize
 gossip columns, but their social, gregarious instinct reads them with
 much interest. You understood quite quickly this duality. The
 celebrities themselves are subjected to the same duality: they openly
 say that they are against this press, the paparazzis and their
 incursions in their private life; but when you dig a little deeper,
 you find out that a substantial part of the information you're dealing
 with is provided by the celebrities themselves, and a lot of rumors
 were invented and spread by these little perfect smiling people.
 Gossip magazines are, for them, a way to harm a rival, to make people
 talk about them, to appear kind and sympathetic and closer to the
 average person because they go to the grocer just like them. You
 sometimes wonder if the journalists themselves aren't the most lucid
 people in this world.

 But, had "Tittle-Tattle Kettle" been a simple, tasteless gossip
 magazine, you'd never have taken the job. But one of this magazine's
 assets is Sammy: he's the man who gave this so peculiar tone to the
 magazine, and finally who gave his magazine bigger prospects than
 being just another gutter magazine. You respect him for that, and so
 do many people. Of course, the magazine can't avoid writing dull
 articles whose sole purpose is to fill the pages of the next issue;
 but the magazine is keen to show that it's different, by precisely,
 and in a clear-headed way, analyzing information, and explaining what
 it really means. Tracking a shameless rumor to reveal its creator,
 analyzing a sentence said by a star to show the true intent, showing
 symbols and ideologies used in an advertising campaign... TTK's style
 is sharp and powerful, and appears more as a shepherd than as a sheep
 following the flock.

 You're okay with that. At the beginning you took the job to pay the
 bills, but you gradually perceived the magazine's appeal, and what you
 could do in your articles. You discovered the complexity of social
 interactions between celebrities, in this world so elitist and yet so
 childish. You improved your understanding of communication campaigns.
 You learnt to be clear-headed. And slowly, year after year, you became
 one of the most competent reporters at the magazine; you witnessed
 your popularity rising, and your articles being more and more noticed,
 quoted, your arguments used elsewhere, and your influence as a
 journalist growing. You really like feeling that. You think about
 keeping this job another few years, and then changing your operating
 field to a more respectable press, where you'd make yourself noticed
 by everyone.

 For now, you have to go to the editorial office: Sammy left you a
 message saying to meet him there.

 "What's going on, Sammy?"
 "Here you are!I just learned that a cocktail party is being organised
 tonight on Thunder Hill... a very select party, exclusively for
 celebrities..."
 "No journalists?"
 "Well, that's the moment where the magazine's reputation is useful.
 They called me a few minutes ago, and told me that only one journalist
 may come there: the one from TTK. You see, it seems that those people
 don't like gossip magazines, but they've got some things to say these
 days... Choosing our magazine appears as a lesser evil - I must say
 I'm glad..." he says with evident satisfaction.
 "Does that mean I'm going to this party?"
 "Precisely. Collect as much information as you can, I think that
 they've got things to say if they want a journalist at their party..."

 This is good news, but you don't really have an evening gown ready for
 tonight...
 Sammy looks at you with a questioning look. "I'll do it, boss" you
 tell him. You'll find an evening gown before tonight...

 Downtown shops
 You admit that you like to go shopping. For clothes, you've got your
 favorite address: a shop that often sells things you like. You often
 come here; some of the sales assistants ended up knowing your name. In
 fact there's Samantha behind the desk, and she smiles at you. You can
 exit to the south.

 Thunder Hill
 Thunder Hill is a hill not so far away from the town: you can see the
 city lights from where you are standing. The heights of the city are
 very popular among the celebrities because of their calm, the view
 they offer on the city and the great size of the parcels: just
 perfect, if you're famous, for your new villa and your huge swimming
 pool. Further up, to the north, is the aforementioned villa - you can
 already listen to the noises from the party. You can go back to the
 south.

 already listen to the noises from the party. You can go back to the
 south.

>go north

 Near the villa
 You finally come near the party. It's in a big villa, that looks
 pretty old, with a few storeys and a swimming pool; but the guests -
 there must be twenty of them - are in a veranda, behind the bay window
 that you can see northward. You can go back to the south.

>listen
 You can hear noises from the party, mainly chit-chat and clinking
 glass.

>examine pool
 It's a big swimming pool, dug in the ground; there could even be
 swimming competitions in it. Seriously, it must be really great to
 swim there, on top of a hill above the city... when you can afford it.

>swim
 There's not enough water to swim in.

>go north
 You knock on the villa's door. A waiter comes and opens you. "Are you
 coming for the party?"
 "Yes. I'm the journalist from "Tittle-Tattle Kettle""
 "Ah, here you are! Come in, please. I heard people asking whether the
 TTK journalist was there or not..."
 "Thanks."
 The waiter hands you a champagne stemware : "And ask me if you need
 anything!" He walks away, smiling. Very professionnal.
 Come to think of it, it could be useful: he's strolling along the
 party for hours, so he must have heard what people were talking
 about...

 At the party (near the entrance door)
 The party is still getting louder: there must be about twenty or
 thirty guests, divided in chatty little groups. Some of them aren't
 famous, and come from the little world turning around the stars:
 celebrities agents, ex girlfriends, photgraphers, publicists... To
 your left or west side, there's the buffet; in front of you, to the
 north, the room continues to a veranda leading to the villa's garden
 and the view of the city. You can go outside by the south door.

 You can see Paul Tyrone and Luciana Perotti here.

>examine tyrone
 Paul Tyrone is an actor, and his fame is rapidly increasing. Everyone
 noticed his first movie, an independant movie he directed which
 featured bizarre and sordid themes; he then carried on his career by
 acting in a lot of action movies or "psychological Hollywoodian
 movies". Twice divorced, with alcohol-related problems, one of his
 ex-wives had him arrested for domestic violence. He's an easy target
 of gossip magazines, as a pure product of the Hollywoodian celebrity
 factories who drowns in his problems - you could almost pity him...
 but not much.
 Ashley Wimby walks in, a few meters from you.

>examine wimby
 Ashley Wimby is one of those factory-made blondes who just achieved
 celebrity status but will disappear in a year's time. She looks like a
 twelve-year old girl, except for the breasts - and hers are fake.
 Nobody knows exactly what she's doing: she sings, she dances, she
 acts, she's in a reality show, she's both everywhere and nowhere,
 omnipresent and transparent. Like every member of her species, she's a
 gold mine for gossip magazines.

>examine perotti
 Luciana Perotti is a stunning woman. She is the quintessential Italian
 beauty who makes every man's head turn her way.  She's tall,
 dark-haired,  voluptuous, and admired by everyone. She appeared in a
 few movies, and in some of them, she was the only reason to go see
 them. She's also done a few perfume commercials and TV programs. She
 isn't very interested in parties, because she also has kids, but she
 stays accessible and interested in the mundane world.

>talk to perotti
 "All right. What about?"

>ask perotti about movies
 "Sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about."

>talk to perotti about party
 I only understood you as far as wanting to talk to Luciana Perotti.

>ask perotti about party
 "Sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about."

>ask perotti about kymberly
 "Sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about."
 Michelle Stapelsky walks in, a few meters from you.

>examine staplesky
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine michelle
 Michelle Stapelsky is an actress... or was. Nowadays, she hasn't
 appeared on screen for years, and just comes to ceremonies sometimes.
 She lives on the money she earned all these years, and she is
 regularly invited to parties thanks to her large network of friends.
 Nothing to write about her - however she's very interested in the
 lives of the other people, and always takes the oppotunity to give her
 opinion...
 Johnny Perkins walks in, a few meters from you.
 Michelle Stapelsky walks past you, heading west.

>examine perkins
 The dark, handsome Johnny Perkins is every woman's dream, who are in
 love with his so perfect face. Some people compare him to James Dean,
 but that's probably excessive; you think Johnny doesn't have as much
 talent as Dean. Silent and mysterious in front of the fans, he can be
 really talkative when you get to know him, and is quite keen on
 criticizing his rivals or revealing information to harm them - but you
 also know where to find information to harm him and destroy this

 Luciana Perotti walks past you, heading west.

>examine lashley
 Heather Lashley was a star from Holmby Hills, which was one of those
 Californian soap operas which were followed by everyone in the 1990's.
 Now, she appears on several TV series (she just left one of them at
 the end of the sixth year), and sometimes ads for wrinkle creams. She
 must be forty and she's still pretty, even though the gossip magazines
 sometimes put a "without make-up" photo of her on their front page...
 Paul Tyrone walks past you, heading west.

 famous faces among them. The bay window is in front of you, to the
 north, and the entrance door is to your right, or east side.

 You can see Paul Tyrone, Kylie Piranella, Luciana Perotti, Michelle
 Stapelsky and the waiter here.
 Michelle Stapelsky walks past you, heading east.

>examine kylie
 Kylie Piranella, a tall blonde with kilometer-long legs and breasts
 too perfect to be real. Ex-model, at least that's what she says, men
 do like her. The irony is, she had her biggest moment of fame last
 year, when her sex tape leaked onto the Internet; but that didn't
 embarass her - on the contrary, she relished the reputation of being a
 "hot" girl. She's an easy target for rumors; you wrote a few articles
 about her, speculating for example about who really put the sex tape
 on the Internet...
 Luciana Perotti walks past you, heading north.

>talk to waiter
 "Of course, miss. What do you want to know?"

>ask waiter about kylie
 There is no reply.
 Michelle Stapelsky walks in, a few meters from you.

 The veranda continues here, with other groups formed by guests talking
 under the glass roof. Some glass noises, a high-pitched laughter: a
 true cocktail. The bay window continues to the west, and you can go
 back to the entrance door to the south.

 You can see Rizo here.

>examine rizo
 Rizo is one of those very colourful people of the mundane world. You
 don't know his real name, and to be honest you don't care. He owns a
 popular night club where the celebrities like to go; they like him,
 and he warmly welcomes them. This eccentric man is famous for his pink
 clothes with feathers on them - his signature clothes. Apart from
 that, he appeared in some movies, and sang on a record now
 long-forgotten. To be frank, you don't really like his old useless
 jet-setter trying to remaining famous by making people or gossip
 magazines talk about him at any cost - you are very careful to ignore
 him.

>ask rizo about gossip
 "Ah, Rizo doesn't know about that!"

>go west

 At the party (near the bay window)
 Near the bay window, other groups formed by the guests are chatting.
 Some of them talk about the view, others are too absorbed in their
 conversations. Behind you, to the south, it's the buffet; the bay
 window continues to the right or east side.

 You can see Kylie Piranella and Heather Lashley here.

>ask lashley about tyrone
 "Paul sure isn't perfect, but I recently heard rumors about him... I
 heard he's been cheating on his wife... I don't know any more about
 it, but still... I didn't see him as a perfect husband, and he isn't
 the first one to do this, especially in this milieu... But still, when
 I think about his wife, I'm quite sad for her. But I'm the only one
 who it seems to bother..."

>ask tyrone about wife
 Tyrone frowns. "Listen, I don't know who told you that, but it's a
 bloody lie! Everyone talks about me while I'm not here, it's just
 great! Stop it, will you!"

 He seems angry... but maybe his reaction is too strong, isn't it?

>ask tyrone about wife
 Better avoid waking up his anger... Let's search for clues by talking
 with other people.

>ask waiter about gossip
 "I heard people talking with Eric Davidson, the producer. They were
 talking about his upcoming movie, which is coming on theaters in a few

 talking near it, divided in little groups, and you can spot a few
 famous faces among them. The bay window is in front of you, to the
 north, and the entrance door is to your right, or east side.

 You can see Luciana Perotti, Eric Davidson, Paul Tyrone and the waiter
 here.

>ask eric about movie
 Davidson smiles. "I'm glad you asked. I'm gonna reveal the release
 date of my next production, "Burning Matches", and it'll be an
 exclusive for your magazine." he says, winking. "It'll be June 11th in
 worldwide release. Here's the info!" He smiles with a patronizing
 smile. "Now do your job, dear, and take advantage of this exceptional
 information - go and write a nice big article..."

 Yeah, right, and be a nice girl? What an egomaniac...

>go east

 At the party (near the entrance door)
 The party is still getting louder: there must be about twenty or
 thirty guests, divided in chatty little groups. Some of them aren't
 famous, and come from the little world turning around the stars:
 celebrities agents, ex girlfriends, photgraphers, publicists... To
 your left or west side, there's the buffet; in front of you, to the
 north, the room continues to a veranda leading to the villa's garden
 and the view of the city. You can go outside by the south door.

 You can see Roger Cainley here.

>ask cainley about tyrone
 Cainley gets closer to you and speaks lower:
 "Listen, I heard this rumor too... Bah, Paul does what he wants, and
 it's true the flesh is weak, especially when you meet young women like
 that... I'm not sure about it, but it seems that his mistress is the
 young Piranella, over there... I wouldn't be surprised: this girl
 exhales luxury and must be very pretty without any clothes..."

 You naughty boy... Well, the rumor is becoming clearer and clearer...

 You're starting to have a nice little collection of rumors... Go on.

 "But, no! Come on, stop it! I'm not his mistress! I don't know who
 told you that, but he's wrong! It's not true, it's a lie!"

 Undoubtedly, little girls can't lie...

>ask tyrone about piranella
 "You know, she's less stupid than she looks... It's just part of her

 "Yes, I know Eric well. To tell you the truth, I like him, and I think
 it's reciprocal, but... I heard he's throwing a party at his place,
 and he didn't invite me... I don't know what to think about that -
 after all, he can invite whoever he wants! I think I'll forget to
 invite him too, later..."

 Luciana Perotti walks in, a few meters from you.

>ask davidson about stapelsky
 You ask quietly, tactfully if there's something wrong between Michelle
 and him. "With Michelle? Why?"
 "You're organising a party without inviting her, she's wondering
 why..."
 "Without inviting her? What is that supposed to mean? Of course she's
 invited! What are you doing, trying to make us fight with each other?
 You low-class journalist!"
 His face turns red. You don't say anything, let his anger calm down
 and say: "I didn't make up a single thing. She told me she didn't
 receive her invitation."
 "Oh! So it must have been lost in the postal services! I'm gonna bawl
 at them! It's not the first time it has happened to me, you know?"

 You smile and step away to avoid listening to a long and dull story...

 your left or west side, there's the buffet; in front of you, to the
 north, the room continues to a veranda leading to the villa's garden
 and the view of the city. You can go outside by the south door.

 You can see Rizo, Ashley Wimby, Paul Tyrone and Kylie Piranella here.
 Paul Tyrone walks past you, heading west.

>ask wimby about melanie
 "Yeah, I understand her disappearance. I mean, me too, sometimes, I
 find all this, the work, the photos, too much for my brain!"

 You could say something about her brain, but...

>ask kylie about melanie
 "In my opinion, if she disappeared, that's because she didn't wanted
 to be seen..."

 Wow, another mystery solved...

>ask wimby about melanie
 "Yeah, I understand her disappearance. I mean, me too, sometimes, I
 find all this, the work, the photos, too much for my brain!"

 You could say something about her brain, but...

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go north

 At the party (near the bay window)
 The veranda continues here, with other groups formed by guests talking
 under the glass roof. Some glass noises, a high-pitched laughter: a
 true cocktail. The bay window continues to the west, and you can go
 back to the entrance door to the south.

 You can see Luciana Perotti, Heather Lashley and Johnny Perkins here.
 Luciana Perotti walks past you, heading west.

>go west

 At the party (near the bay window)
 Near the bay window, other groups formed by the guests are chatting.
 Some of them talk about the view, others are too absorbed in their
 conversations. Behind you, to the south, it's the buffet; the bay
 window continues to the right or east side.

 You can see Luciana Perotti here.
 Luciana Perotti walks past you, heading south.
 Michelle Stapelsky walks in, a few meters from you.

>ask michelle about melanie
 "Who? I don't know her..."
 Heather Lashley walks in, a few meters from you.

>ask michelle about melanie
 "Who? I don't know her..."

>tell michelle about melanie
 "Who? I don't know her..."

>go south

 At the party (near the buffet)
 This way is the buffet, which is well garnished. The guests are
 talking near it, divided in little groups, and you can spot a few
 famous faces among them. The bay window is in front of you, to the
 north, and the entrance door is to your right, or east side.

 You can see Rizo, Kylie Piranella, Luciana Perotti, Paul Tyrone, Eric
 Davidson and the waiter here.
 Paul Tyrone walks past you, heading east.

>ask eric about melanie
 "I like this singer. Her songs are inspired and inspiring... And she's
 very photogenic. I'll see if I can't include her in a movie."
 Luciana Perotti walks past you, heading east.

>ask waiter about melanie
 "I don't know; maybe I should investigate."

>ask waiter about gossip
 Mmh... Sorry, but I don't know what to tell you for now.
 Ashley Wimby walks in, a few meters from you.

>ask wimby about melanie
 "Yeah, I understand her disappearance. I mean, me too, sometimes, I
 find all this, the work, the photos, too much for my brain!"

 You could say something about her brain, but...

>ask eric about wimby
 "She's very popular. I think I'll make her appear in one my movies..."
 Kylie Piranella walks past you, heading north.

>ask perotti about melanie
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east

 At the party (near the entrance door)
 The party is still getting louder: there must be about twenty or
 thirty guests, divided in chatty little groups. Some of them aren't
 famous, and come from the little world turning around the stars:
 celebrities agents, ex girlfriends, photgraphers, publicists... To
 your left or west side, there's the buffet; in front of you, to the
 north, the room continues to a veranda leading to the villa's garden
 and the view of the city. You can go outside by the south door.

 You can see Luciana Perotti, Paul Tyrone and Roger Cainley here.
 Eric Davidson walks in, a few meters from you.

>ask perotti about melanie
 "I wonder why Melanie hasn't been around for the last few months..."

>ask cainley about melanie
 "You're saying that she went to a party? Ah, marvelous! I hope she
 defeated every one of her problems..."
 "Problems?"
 "Yeah, well, I don't know what problems, but Eric told me about it
 some time ago... If someone saw her, she must feel better, right?"

>ask eric about melanie
 You ask Eric if he knows anything about Melanie. "Er, I must say
 somebody told me once about her drug problems... Apparently she's a
 real addict, at least that's what Perkins told me once. That would
 explain the coulours in her videoclips, don't you think?"

 Yeah, let's laugh about addiction! What a digusting sense of humor he
 has...

 That should be enough gossip for now. You think you can go home now.

 Near the villa
 You finally come near the party. It's in a big villa, that looks
 pretty old, with a few storeys and a swimming pool; but the guests -
 there must be twenty of them - are in a veranda, behind the bay window
 that you can see northward. You can go back to the south.

>go south

 Thunder Hill
 Thunder Hill is a hill not so far away from the town: you can see the
 city lights from where you are standing. The heights of the city are
 very popular among the celebrities because of their calm, the view
 they offer on the city and the great size of the parcels: just
 perfect, if you're famous, for your new villa and your huge swimming
 pool. Further up, to the north, is the aforementioned villa - you can
 already listen to the noises from the party. You can go back to the
 south.

 The night was long; you're going home to sleep.








 After a good nightlong sleep, you're ready for another day! You stand
 up and put a simple shirt on to go to the office.
 Your flat
 This is your little flat with two rooms, downtown. Rather functional
 and bright, you really like it. In the sitting-room, there's a table,
 a few chairs, and a sofa: that's where you usually work. The kitchen
 is westwards, and your bedroom and the bathroom are eastwards.

 You can see a camera here.

>examine me
 You're tall, red-headed, quite thin, and pretty, or so they say;
 you're a perfectly normal twenty-six-year old young woman. A reporter
 for the "Tittle-Tattle Kettle" for a few years now, you're known to be
 tenacious, frank and clear-headed. You'd agree with that.
 You're wearing a red checked shirt. Simple, but still, quite nice.

 In front of the paper's building
 In this building, to the north, there's the editorial office of
 "Tittle-Tattle Kettle", at the sixteenth floor, but you still can go
 somewhere else by heading to the south.

>go north

 Editorial office of "Tittle-Tattle Kettle"
 "Tittle-Tattle Kettle, your teatime's long-brewed, boiling gossip!"
 You always thought this motto was a little bit silly, but it's quite
 original after all; it didn't stop this magazine to grow. In fact,
 sales are good, and the paper shows its difference from its rivals
 with a certain sense of ethics and reflexion - it still is a gossip
 magazine, but let's say that you take advantage of a higher status
 than your rivals. The editorial office is at the sixteenth floor of
 the building. Westwards, the window gives you a great view of the
 city; near it there's the coffee dispenser and metal tables.
 Eastwards, it's Sammy's office; your office is somewhere to the north,
 and if you want to leave there's an elevator at the south.

 Sammy is here.

>talk to sammy
 "Hi boss!"
 "Here you are! Tell me about yesterday's party, was it interesting?"
 "Rather interesting, yeah..."
 "Come into my office and tell me the whole thing!"

 You step into Sammy's office and sit on a chair; he takes a notepad
 and sits in front of you.

 "Where should I start?" you say. Well, you start by telling him about
 the guests, and their mood and their gossip, and you tell Sammy
 everything you learned, while he takes notes. You remember a lot of
 things about the party, and don't forget any information. When you're
 done, Sammy leans on his chair, and thinks for a while. You wait
 expectantly.

 "Right. You know, a lot of different people have been telling me about
 Tyrone and the suspicions about his fidelity... Well, if you believe
 them, it seems he's supposed to go to his mistress, Piranella's house
 tonight. Do you confirm this info?"
 You nod.
 "I think it could be good to send you there, don't you?"

 You sigh. Tyrone is a problem man, he already has this reputation, and
 what good will it be to write an article about his adultery? Put some
 more weight upon his shoulders, distract the housewife for a few
 seconds, but it won't change anything, and you don't like to hound a
 man like this... On the other hand, you really don't like Piranella,
 and it all depends on the way you write the article; you can probably
 make it more harmful to her than to Tyrone... In either cases, you
 don't like your position, because the only purpose of such a report is
 to sling mud at someone.

 A few years ago, with an impulsive character, you'd have rebelled
 against Sammy, and maybe he would have fired you - it nearly happened,
 once... Now, you eat humble pie: you're paid to do things like that,
 whether you like it or not - if not, why did you choose this magazine?
 You do it anyway, but it's true you sometimes try to avoid doing it.

 "All right Sammy... I must say I don't like it, but..."
 "I know, but I have to send a reporter there, and it's part of your
 job at TTK, isn't it? Right, I'll give you the address. Try to learn
 more about both of them."
 "Right."
 You stand up from your chair.

 Sammy's office
 Sammy's office is amazingly neat for one of an editor who's always
 running everywhere. Actually, there's still huge heaps of papers, but
 you can imagine that they end up regularly in the archives or
 recycled. His desk isn't messy at all. His computer screen is swarmed
 by little notes: he's got so much to do... You can go back to the hall
 to the west.

>read notes
 Which do you mean, the papers or the computer?

>computer
 Sammy's computer screen is covered with adhesive notes: reminders,
 information, phone numbers... Being an editor must be quite
 exhausting.

 Sammy reads a text message, and enters a quick reply.

 Kylie Piranella's house
 Kylie Piranella lives in a pretty old house, and oddly it isn't the
 kind of house you expect for a blonde young woman with such a hot
 reputation. But, you heard a lot of rumors about the parties that were
 organised at her place, and about the fact that a lot of men came and
 went inside this house. Is it only true, or just part of the image
 that she's building of herself? You don't know that. Anyway, there's a
 garden with a swimming pool behind the house, behind high stonewalls.
 There's a large window on the east side of the house, first floor, and
 perhaps you'll be able to see it more precisely if you walk into the
 alley heading to the northwest. Northward, there's the entrance door;
 you can go back to the south.

 An alley, near Kylie Piranella's house
 It's a simple alley between Kylie Piranella's house and the next
 house. From here you can see the large window at the first floor of
 the house, and some crates below. You can go back by heading to the
 southwest.

 For now, everything is quiet: no sign of Tyrone.

>examine window
 It's not the right time to spy through the window, Tyrone isn't here
 yet and Piranella is alone inside her house, there's nothing
 interesting to see.

 Ah, here he is! You saw him walk past the alley, but he didn't see
 you. He heads to the door, and you hear him knock.

>get on crates
 You climb on the crates and look inside the house, knowing that anyway
 Kylie is at the door. Pretty well-furnished interior, but nothing
 more, so you get off the crates.

 You hear the door opening, and Kylie cheers: "At last, here you are!
 Come in!" And as soon as she closes the door, you can't hear a thing.

>examine window
 You climb on the crates and look inside the house, knowing that anyway
 Kylie is at the door. Pretty well-furnished interior, but nothing
 more, so you get off the crates.

 You hear footsteps: they probably are going upstairs. And now they're
 above you you can hear a manly low-pitched voice talking, must be
 Tyrone's. But it's a loud voice, too loud: Tyrone is screaming. And
 you hear a woman whining: they're probably arguing.

>examine window
 They must be just behind the window, you don't want them to see you.

 Suddenly, Kylie screams. A long, high-pitched scream, a scream of
 terror, of pain. You jump. What's happening? Is he beating her?
 Something serious is happening in this house!

>SAVE

>examine window
 You climb on the crates to see through the window. You can see a body
 on the floor; it must be Piranella. What happened? Damn, a furniture
 on the left blocks your sight, and you can't see Tyrone, if only he's
 here.

 All of a sudden, not a single noise. You lend an ear, only to hear
 hasted footsteps. You wonder if you should call the police, and you're
 already opening your mobile phone.

 An alley, near Kylie Piranella's house
 It's a simple alley between Kylie Piranella's house and the next
 house. From here you can see the large window at the first floor of
 the house, and some crates below. You can go back by heading to the
 southwest.

 You want to walk out of the alley, perhaps to go and fetch help. But
 suddenly, a window above you breaks. You jump and look: you see a hand
 throwing something that falls in the dumpster in front of you with a
 metal sound! You didn't see it well, but it looked like a knife, which
 would explain everything!

>examine dumpster
 These are the bins of the neighbourhood. The bins from any
 neighbourhood, even the most in vogue, always stink. Yuk.

>examine knife
 You can't see any such thing.

>look in dumpster
 You search the bins. Lifting a bag, you can see a knife. A bloddy
 knife. It's the one which was thrown through the window.

 What happened is pretty clear. A knife, screams. Piranella was
 murdered by Tyrone. Just a few moments ago. While you were here,
 waiting for a scoop.

 The scene becomes blurry all of a sudden. Shocked, you puke against
 the wall.

 It's the first time you've seen something like that. You can't stand
 it.

 You're going to call the police. But not now.

 You run away.

 [pausing to show unread error message]
 Dreams, coming again and again, always unwelcome, always unwanted...

 Whether sadness, misery, horror or confusion, They never fail to
 induce negativity; in that, at least, this dream is no different. You
 float in void, filled with a roiling black static that seems
 conscious. There is nothing to see but the static, nothing to feel but
 your own form, and nothing to hear but the ghostly call of a child. It
 sets your teeth on edge even in the waking world; you can't stand that
 eerie wail, wavering between laughter and tears.

 You never find this child. Even though the sound gets closer, until it
 is right next to you, all around you, inside your own head before you
 are awakened by the alarm clock.

 This time, though...

 A figure swims out of the darkness, backlit, so that you can only make
 out a childlike face of tragic innocence and flowing hair.

 "Who... are you?"

 There isn't an answer right away--instead, everything around you turns
 completely white. And somehow... puffy.

 Do you know WHY you have always hated the sound, Kristen? The child,
 invisible now, speaks, for the first time; androgynous, cultured. You
 can't respond. you wish you could. It just sparks something deep
 within you, something primal--something below reason, below
 rationality, below everything but fear. You don't like it when your
 brain keeps secrets from you.

 I've waited a long time... and still am. Your surroundings flicker
 between the endless white and writhing black, the two merging into
 some unwholesome gray. Kristen... your child is waiting.








 "Your child is waiting."

 "Hmm?"

 "I said, your child is waiting."

 "WHAT?" You blinked furiously, trying to get your brain into some
 sense of working order; these dreams usually leave you a scattered
 mess, and you can't recall ever speaking to someone while that way.

 "I said--" The voice seemed testy.

 "No--stop. I heard what you said, I just... could you give me a
 moment?"

 You looked around... same bedroom, same lame-ass apartment, same
 everything... Awake. Normal. Except, not. You'd managed to register
 your ringing phone, pick it up, and get through the opener to this
 conversation, while sleeping. Not very like you. And she said--

 You felt a chill. "...Excuse me? Did you say that I have a--"

 "Child, yes ma'am--waiting for you in Gainesville." Click.

 "I don't have a..." The retort died on your lips. The hum of a
 disconnected telephone answered back at you, daring you to question
 its integrity.

 Patently ridiculous. You don't have a child. You never did. How could
 that possibly be? There must be some mistake, some incredibly stupid
 bureaucratic snafu. You'd love nothing better than to explain this
 fact to whoever that was, but since she hung up before you could get
 the words out, that's not really an option.

 That dream...

 Was a dream. You dream every night, and you haven't had any come true
 yet. Gainesville? Where is Gainesville? Most bloody generic name for a
 town ever, and you don't even recall there being one here. You
 wouldn't even know where it is.

 Except... you do. The way suggested itself even as you tried to deny
 it, as though you had always known. You're still certain, completely,
 that you've never heard of the place before; even the part of your
 brain that showed you the way confirms this.

 In the end, you don't know what your motivation was: sleep
 deprivation, deep seated confusion, nerves... maybe your body was just
 tired of waiting for your brain to catch up and got you dressed and in
 the car before you realized. Soon you were driving, to where you
 weren't sure, your mind screaming MADNESS while your hands deftly
 twisted the steering wheel. This would bother you, give you serious
 pause, but you somehow feel at peace with it. All you've gotta do is
 remind yourself that you had nothing else planned today.








 Obituary
 An Interactive Fiction by Drew and Johnny
 Release 1 / Serial number 090829 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 You stand up and stretch, various parts of your body making worrisome
 popping noises as you exit the car, noting with a vague sense of
 triumph that it has once again failed to cause your violent death in
 some spectacular fashion or other. The cold night air is chill against
 your skin--fortunate, then, that you brought your coat.

 Outskirts of Gainesville
 You stand on the side of the packed dirt road leading to Gainesville.
 The road stretches far away behind you to the south and, eventually,
 turns off into a paved one that leads back to the central transit
 explosion that is modern American transportation. Your vision of the
 town is obscured by the trees; all you can tell is that the path
 leads, for now, to the north.

 Your next-to useless, banged-up car is decidedly parked here. The
 driver's side door is shut smugly in your face.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your trench coat (being worn)
     a handgun (with 8 rounds)
     your keyring

>examine me
 You top off at about 5'6"... not the tallest girl around at 24,
 granted, but you make up for it in personality and one hundred and
 thirty-five pounds of trained muscle. Your jeans and tanktop show all
 the right parts of your toned and curvy figure, the baggy trench coat
 you usually wear over them telling of your disinterest in such things.
 Straight black hair falls about your shoulders, pale skin crying out
 for a tan while your dark blue eyes look upon the world with cool
 scorn.

>examine car
 It's... your car. Hurray. The old thing is planted quite firmly on the
 ground at the side of the road here, and it doesn't look like it
 intends on moving any time soon. It's always playing little pranks on
 you like that. The engine has recently been making chuckling noises
 which you suspect are treasonous, and every time you--for whatever
 reason--try opening the hood, you're intrigued at how a maze of gears,
 belts, wires, circuitry and cables can be said to be "peering" up at
 you, with an unmistakable air of malevolence.

>open car
 You open the driver's door.

>get in car

 Your Shit Car
 You don't like it much, partly due to a suspicion of yours (reinforced
 each new day) that it doesn't like you back. It seems to only want to
 start when you don't want it to, for reasons mechanics never even try
 explaining to you on the grounds that if you understood your car was
 just a crabby old bitch and needed some Midol, you might stop paying
 them what you already know is too much money every three fucking
 months.

 The driver's side door is flopped lethargically open. Staring at you.

>examine car
 The floor of your car is, being the standard for virtually every car
 owner in the world, liberally strewn with trash; your mind briefly
 churns at the concept of seeing what secrets might actually be lurking
 right under your feet.

>search trash
 Oh sure, the miscellaneous collection of worthless crap might contain
 a million-dollar-winning bottle cap or any old Arc of the Covenant
 or--if you want to shoot for the moon--the explanation of So Far. But
 more likely you'll just find a used condom from 1998. And you'd quite
 frankly rather not go dragging any of that up again, thanks all the
 same.

 to test, but you're highly dubious as to their life-saving ability.

 Er, it's a seat. It's, um, made of some generic soulless fabric that

 it's something that people sit on while driving or being driven. What
 did you expect?

 more likely you'll just find a used condom from 1998. And you'd quite
 frankly rather not go dragging any of that up again, thanks all the
 same.

 Outskirts of Gainesville
 You stand on the side of the packed dirt road leading to Gainesville.
 The road stretches far away behind you to the south and, eventually,
 turns off into a paved one that leads back to the central transit
 explosion that is modern American transportation. Your vision of the
 town is obscured by the trees; all you can tell is that the path
 leads, for now, to the north.

 Your next-to useless, banged-up car is decidedly parked here. The
 driver's side door is hanging mockingly open at you.

>open trunk
 There's nothing useful in there.

 Your Shit Car
 You don't like it much, partly due to a suspicion of yours (reinforced
 each new day) that it doesn't like you back. It seems to only want to
 start when you don't want it to, for reasons mechanics never even try
 explaining to you on the grounds that if you understood your car was
 just a crabby old bitch and needed some Midol, you might stop paying
 them what you already know is too much money every three fucking
 months.

 The driver's side door is flopped lethargically open. Staring at you.

 (the driver's door)
 The door is unquestionably the most useful part of this entire
 vehicle, as it allows you a quick and speedy departure from it
 whenever it decides to attempt homicide.

 You can't see inside, since the glove compartment is closed.

 On a whim, you pull open the glove compartment and root around inside.
 Your fingers close on a loose match. Odd. It must have fallen out of

 it; it might come in handy later.

>examine radio
 One of the terribly unfair ironies that you've had to come to terms
 with over the years in regards to your car is that no matter what
 state it's in (either "virtual junk heap" or "literal junk heap") the
 radio is always in perfect working order. Unfortunately, 'round "these
 parts" pretty much all that's on the radio is the same thirteen
 Christian rock songs, "drive-time morning shows" hosted by idiots that
 got rejected from the Blue Collar comedy tour, and political
 commentators trying to claim that keeping gay marriage illegal makes
 AmeriKKKa that much more awesome and, somehow, free.

>turn on radio
 Ugh. No thanks. You're proud of the fact that you have never turned on
 the radio and you don't see how anything up to and including a freak
 meteorological event could change this.

 By contrast to the heater, the AC has *never* worked. You're always

 damage.

 Most of them aren't terribly large or tall, but many have long

 thin curtain that obscures most of what's ahead from view. No doubt
 when you start the walk into town there's gonna be some pine needles
 in your hair. Why can't these people be like the rest of America and
 be down with some clear-cutting?

 Dirt Road
 This part of the path is just as well flattened as the rest. The
 amount of trees nearby is almost overbearing. That's all there seems
 to be. You feel a slight pull urging you to walk just a little faster
 down the road to the north, even while your slowly-rallying common
 sense implores you to go back to your car towards the southeast.

>examine trees
 The trees lean over the path, branches curling down, giving an
 impression of a set of teeth waiting for the perfect moment to

>go north

 Dirt Road
 You can see what looks to be the town of Gainesville in the distance,
 to the northeast. You can't really tell; the trees that line your path
 also block your view. You can retreat from the town to the south.

>examine trees
 The trees loom over the path, branches pointing down at you. Quite
 honestly, they've ceased being creepy or foreboding, and have been
 downgraded to "bloody annoying." You're quickly getting sick of this
 little venture of yours.

>go northeast
 You emerge from the forest path, leads onto a paved walkway with grass
 on either side. You walk along it, the grass soon disappearing. You
 look around for a turn-off, a building, or just a person to ask for
 directions, yet after about five minutes of walking you see nothing.
 What the hell are you even doing here? the area appears completely
 deserted. This is ridiculous, probably some kind of prank.

 You stop short, for the first time realizing just how much sense that
 explanation makes. And you fell for it like a damned idiot. When (not
 if) you find the lousy son of a bitch who did this to you, you're
 gonna... Furious, you turn around --








 Lost in the Mists
 A thick, featureless mist has rolled in all around you. You can't see
 more than ten feet in any direction, and what you can see is utterly
 useless. No grass, no sidewalks, no trees, no buildings, no cars and
 no people. nothing. The entire ground is just a blank expanse of
 pavement, stretching out forever.

 You thump your shoe on the pavement and wait for the sound of an echo.
 Streamers of vapor dance with themselves as you move swiftly by,
 tangling and untangling as you try to find a way out. You blink your
 eyes, hard.

>examine pavement
 The smooth, gray pavement below you stretches out in every direction,
 seemingly for miles. You can't tell for certain though because of all
 this goddamn fog blocking your vision.

>look
 Lost in the Mists
 You are suddenly seized by a burst of uncontrollable, raging fear that
 leaves you helpless and whimpering, but is gone just as soon as it
 appeared; you are left shaking and dizzied. You pull your coat tighter
 against your body, shivering slightly. There's a strange shifting
 under your feet as of something soft and pliable moving beneath you,
 but it passes almost as swiftly as it began.

>xyzzy
 A sinister voice hisses "Wrong game, dumb bitch!"

>go north
 Lost in the Mists
 Heady tendrils of vapor flow inside your nostrils, filling your throat
 with a disgusting taste. You dart looks in every direction, looking
 for something different. A low, keening noise travels through the
 mists from a directionless source.

 You hear nothing unexpected.

 You don't feel the need to impress your superiority over your handgun
 via a demonstration of firearm skills; it seems suitably cowed by your
 presence already.

>look
 Lost in the Mists
 The only thing you can hear is your shoes, and even they sound
 dampened. A strange scent passes under your nose for a moment; sweet,
 yet also pungent. Massless shapes loom up and around you and then
 dissolve into nothingness. Your eyes penetrate the gloom, looking in
 all directions, but you can't make out anything useful--or anything at
 all.

>examine shapes

  Your shoes click dully on the pavement. The mist swirls around, just
 above your head. You dart looks in every direction, looking for

 You call out your own name, just to hear human speech. You strain your
 ears for some sound that might guide you, and think you hear the

 leaving you to wonder if you had just imagined it.  There's a strange
 shifting under your feet as of something soft and pliable moving
 beneath you, but it passes almost as swiftly as it began.

 The mist hangs unnaturally still over you. You peer forward, trying to
 make something out. You feel alone, with only the dulled sounds of
 your shoes thudding against the pavement for company. You start
 guiltily, unable to shake the ominous feel that something is watching
 you. Eddies of mist drift past you, pushing your hair in front of your
 eyes.

>go east
 Hmm. Is it just your imagination, or..? No, it's not. You can see
 blurry outlines of walls now, and... in the distance, some kind of
 house? You swish an arm in front of your face and things get
 clearer--this goddamn fog is definitely thinning now.

 Front of Ranch House
 You're standing just at the entrance to a horse ranch. The stables are
 to the northwest, and the house itself is to the north. You can't
 really make out very much of either from this far away, though.
 Overhead, you can see the sun setting, casting a fiery red glow over
 the scene. To the south lies a gate, firmly closed, preventing your
 egress; to either side of it lie high stone walls as far as you can
 see.

>examine sun
 The sky is mostly clear, although a considerable mass of white cloud
 cover can be seen dissipating off to the northwest. To your right, you
 can see the sun just starting its ascent into the sky, lending this
 odd tableau a rusty red hue. Just fantastic--now you'll be missing two
 days of work over... well. You're not quite sure what, exactly,
 anymore. But fuck it--this is more interesting, anyway.

>examine gate
 The gate is a thick, wrought iron construction, complete with rusted
 hinges and slatted bars. And it is closed. What the--how is that
 possible? Did you just happen to accidentally phase through solid
 matter?

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>open gate
 You give the gate a tug--no good, it's not moving. Not locked,
 exactly, more like... stuck.

>push gate
 It is fixed in place.

>kick gate
 You give the gate a solid womp with your palm--en guard, lest
 gait!--and feel the gate slap you back just as hard. Well at least
 that rules out holograms.

>examine house
 From this vantage point you can't make out very much, except that it's
 quite large. You can make out the porch well enough though; it's open
 to the elements with a couple of old rocking chairs swaying back and
 forth in the breeze.

>go north
 You trudge on towards the old house, hoping to find someone that can
 show you around this town... but the house isn't any closer. Frowning,
 you turn around to retrace your steps--and realize that that's no
 longer necessary. The gate is still only a couple of steps away. What
 the--?

>go northwest
 As much as you might like to, now isn't really a good time to go
 rustlin' up some grub. And anyways, they're not yours.

>examine porch
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gate
 Peering closer, you can see that a piece of the locking mechanism
 appears to have come loose; it's lying on the ground just past the
 gate. You could probably reach it through the bars.

>get piece
 You get on your knees and start reaching through the bars. Your
 fingers just land on the piece of rusted metal, but can't quite close
 over it. Slowly you push it forward, just a few more centimeters
 and--got it.

 "She's fixing the gate!"

 Your head whips around to see three men running towards you from the
 ranch house. You pull yourself to your feet and raise your hands,
 trying to explain yourself, but even to your own ears the words that
 come out sound like babble. The men ignore you, running closer--it's
 then that you notice that one of them, the eldest, is armed. All
 right, this is getting serious. Your hand flashes inside your coat for
 your own gun--

 "Not as clever as you thought you were. Are ya?"

 One of the younger men chortles this, just before the older one fires
 his shotgun. A load of buckshot blasts through your rib cage; however
 it lacks the force to create an exit wound.

 It's not at all like you thought it would be. All over, your body
 feels cold. But the wounds feel hot... you don't get that at all...

 As if from outside yourself, you see you slump to the ground, deep red
 blossoming from your chest cavity. You hear what sounds like a volcano
 inside your head, and look down at your body convulsing; blood flecked
 with mucus sprays from your mouth, staining your coat and shirt a deep
 crimson. Physically, you're not repulsed--you've seen worse things on
 TV--but the fact that that's you, this is your life draining away, is
 enough to send the you watching you die reeling away in a shock that
 feels as real as the pellets that ripped through your body not a half
 second ago.

 Before you can see anything else happen, the space before you seems to
 flatten out into one dimension; the ground, the sky, the gate, the
 house, your body lying in a pool of its own blood, the man that shot
 you wracking his slide and kicking out the shell on your face--all
 stretch out before you as if existing all on one plane. Even that
 slowly fades until all is gray... then black.








 The first sense to return is feeling: A hard surface, digging into
 your spine. It is uncomfortable. Though, not nearly as uncomfortable
 as having your lungs turned to pulp by a shotgun blast. All things are
 relative.

 You trail your fingers over your own skin, gingerly, expecting to
 wince from pain at any moment--but no. Nothing. There is no ragged,
 bloody hole in your chest. You are breathing normally. The second
 sense to come back is hearing, the first sound you hear being a dull
 thunk as your elbows accidentally smack into the walls on either side
 of you; the second being a muted "Sonofabitch." After that, the others
 come back in a rush... except for sight.

 Darkness
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>light match
 From your cursory examination of this prison, there don't seem to be
 any air holes. Though the light may be helpful, it would also
 significantly tap your current supply of oxygen. And you only have
 one. Besides, you don't need light. You're a ninja.

>scream
 Okay, it's safe to say you're pretty rattled now, so you let out a
 good yell. The sound reverberates extremely loudly and hurts your ears
 rather a lot, but doesn't appear to do anything else.

>examine walls

>touch walls

>inventory
 You do realize that you're trapped in a small box, right?

>feel
 (the surroundings)

 You run your palms all over the sides of wherever you are. It is
 clearly made from thick hard wood, you'd guess pine, and it's
 rectangular. You have just enough room to turn yourself around in
 here, and maybe four inches of space. Running your hands over the top
 of the box, you can feel metal studs holding the corners together...
 nails?

>kick box
 There may not be enough room to kick upwards, but there are other
 solutions. You concentrate your attack on the center of a board, where
 you know the wood will be weakest. You are calm. You will get out of
 this. You keep telling yourself this, to focus your mind and steady
 your nerves. You are aware, almost as an afterthought, that you
 frightened beyond measure; also if you listen to this you will lose
 control and be gone. Methodically, you batter away at the top of the
 box with your hands. The first hint of a give, the acknowledgment of
 weakness fills you with triumph. You bash at the lid repeatedly,
 refusing to give up until finally it starts to crack... and a fine
 dust begins to filter through. You wait for it to stop, but it never
 does. Not even when it covers your stomach and starts flowing towards
 your mouth--and still, no light. Oh GOD. It suddenly hits you, you
 know exactly where this is. This is, it's your--

 With a burst of furious determination, you smash your fist one last
 time into the coffin--because that's what the fuck it is-- and the
 board splinters, momentum moving it into the mound of raining dirt
 Pushing off of your back with your feet, using all your might, you
 rise against the crushing weight of the soil baring down on you. Your
 breath held, you push yourself to your feet--but it still isn't
 enough. Cursing your height in the back of your mind you claw
 desperately at the earth, shoveling handfuls off yourself as one word
 dominates your thoughts: UP. You tilt your head back, lungs burning,
 trying to spring off the wrecked boards. Your support sinks
 sickeningly further down into the ground but you are still able to
 make some sort of half-assed arching movement, just enough for your
 head to break the surface. You exhale and immediately inhale again,
 throwing your arms out in front of you, digging them into the soft
 earth as gravity pulls at that fucking trench coat and all the
 pointless useless shit in it. Your face twists itself into a rictus of
 determination as you rip your fingernails bloody, fighting against the
 weight of the earth tumbling you back into the open grave. The first
 few inches are the hardest ones to manage, but you do manage them, and
 then a few more, slowly but surely extricating yourself from the pit,
 just enough to allow you the leverage to push down and free your legs.
 You roll over onto your back, hands and feet scrabbling wildly,
 propelling your body away from the unstable boundaries of the hole
 even as it shifts and fills itself.

 Slowly, you sit up. It is only then you can be bothered to examine
 your surroundings.

 Graveyard (on the dirt)
 You are in a graveyard. You can tell, see, because of the graves. They
 lie before you, headstones and crosses in little white rows. The moon
 casts feeble illumination over the scene, throwing deep shadows in all
 directions. You can see, to the west, the spires of a church. Any
 other landmarks are enclosed by a high stone wall enclosing the entire
 plot of land.

 Large doors lead west into the church.

>examine headstones
 You can't really get a good look at any of the headstones from the
 position you're in; from here, they all seem blank.

>get up
 After taking a few minutes to just sit and get yourself under control
 you push yourself slowly, methodically, up to your feet. Giving your
 surroundings a perfunctory once-over you notice something you didn't
 before, or rather someone. A figure, who's gender you can't even
 determine, is standing in profile, the silhouette mostly hidden by a
 headstone. You creep forward, your footsteps making no sound on the
 dirt of the cemetery. As soon as you get into a position to observe,
 the figure turns around with unnatural smoothness to stare directly
 into your eyes.

 "Well." he says, and instantly the shock of recognition chills you.
 "Well, well, well." You know that voice. You know that face. It's
 Marcus. "Gone and died, have you?" He smirks. "Yeah, I did that once.
 I guess you could say I never really recovered."

>examine marcus
 You know this man. His voice, his almost aggressively bad posture, his
 faded overalls, the more careless than carefree tousle of his hair,
 the "I hate the band you like" t-shirt he wears over his skinny
 chest--these are all characteristic of the man who was one of your
 best friends. The way he looks at you now is new; not quite predatory,
 but there is an unmistakable air of contempt in how he addresses you.
 The eyes are not new, though, recessed inside his gaunt pale face. Nor
 is him tapping his arms on his hips new. Ah, yes, the arms--covered
 with small scars, running in a crisscrossed pattern over his veins.
 No, those are not new, at all.

>marcus, hello
 There is no reply.

>talk to marcus
 What do you want to say?
     1. "You're dead."
     2. "Hey... been a while."
     3. "What is this place?"

>3

 "Marcus," you say, urgently. "Do you know what is going on here?"

 Marcus grins at you. "Oh, do I ever. But--" he puts his finger to the
 side of his head, "--I'm not supposed to tell you. Not that I really
 want to anyway. Hey--I know, you've really been busy with the whole
 Night of the Living Dead thing, but did you ever take a moment to look
 at all these graves?"

>examine graves
 Possessed by a morbid fascination, you begin looking at the headstones
 commemorating the graves. It doesn't take you long before you realize
 that almost all of them are completely blank. There's Marcus' grave
 though, sure enough--and next to it--!

 Oh, God.

 "Rustle, Will--L. May 16th, 1983--D. September 8th, 1998. Cause of
 death: auto accident."

 You remember him, of course. You'll never forget the last time you
 kissed him: at the funeral, in his coffin. the material of his shirt,
 the stillness of his chest, the deathly pallor of his skin--dry, and
 cold as ice. Sometimes, you feel it so vividly in a dream that when
 you wake up, you think it's happening again.

 And right next to his grave... "Dreyfus, Michael. B. June 3rd,
 1983--D. June 3rd, 2004. Cause of death: auto accident."

 You remember what it was like getting the call that evening. The
 denial that flooded through you, followed by the dull emptiness of the
 space that opened up in you, and everyone who knew him. You remember
 his parents, your friends, huddled close around his casket. God, how
 horrible... You can't help but wonder--did he know? In those last few
 minutes, when he felt control slipping from him, did he realize that
 his time had come? Was he afraid? And what does he know now that we do
 not? Did he feel pain? Does it haunt him every day of his spiritual
 life, as the memory of his passing haunts those he left behind?

 You can't look anymore. God fucking dammit, what is this? Is this some
 sort of purgatory? Are you dead, now, and this is what it's like? Or
 is this just another dream? You're sick of it. Absolutely, utterly,
 sick to fucking death of dreams.

 Others call you the rock, the emotional center of their universe. How
 can that be possible when you can't even begin to reconcile with your
 own past? What makes you so special that the images, sensations, pain,
 and emotions all stay with you, even to this day? You'd think you'd
 work through it, get past it, but no. That would be normal. Expected.
 The right way for things to happen.


 Marcus gives you a cold look as the weight of all that's happened to
 you sinks in again. "Now do you understand?" he asks, quietly. "This
 town was made for you, Kristen." He glares at you, bitterly. "ALL for
 YOU."


 You are tired.

 So. Very. Tired.

>talk to marcus
 What do you want to say?
     1. "You're dead."
     2. "Hey... been a while."

>1
 "You... you're... this is..."

 You stammer, unable to get the words out. Marcus, however, saves you
 the trouble. "Dead? Yeah... like I said, never recovered. Oh, damn the
 government, damn them! It's all the fault of those Communist Nazi
 Satanist fundamentalist judges legislating from the bench. Or that
 damned liberal Jew media brainwashing me to vote for Buchanan. Or
 something. ON WEEEEEEEE!" Marcus throws out his arms in an exaggerated
 gesture of helplessness before leaning close for a moment and
 whispering "I always wanted to use the word ennui in a sentence. I
 mean--come on. It's SO cool."

>talk to marcus
 What do you want to say?
     1. "..."
     2. "Some things never change."

>2
 You let out a soft chuckle. "Well, I can tell the whole being dead
 thing is treating you well."

 Marcus grins at you. "Very well, indeed--the health plan, for
 instance, is *great*. I mean, I can shoot up, and not have to worry
 about overdosing!"

>talk to marcus
 What do you want to say?
     1. "Still doing that, eh?"
     2. "You're kidding. Right?"

>1
 There is an uneasy silence. "So... even death doesn't stop you from
 taking drugs?"

 Marcus shakes his head. "Nope. Why should it? All death means to me is
 ya don't have to worry about dyin' anymore. And what's so bad about
 that?"

>talk to marcus
 What do you want to say?
     1. "That's kind of sad."

>1
 "Marcus... I'll be honest... that's a pretty sad world view."

 Marcus nods. "I won't ask if you think I should stop because I already
 know the answer." He sighs. "I guess I've just never bothered to care
 before. I mean, what's the point? You don't do a lot when you're dead.
 Oh, sure, you can spy on all those nubile young ladies in the shower
 whenever you want but that just really gets old after a few years, you
 know? That was a joke, by the way. It never got old." You reach up to
 give Marcus a friendly cuff on the shoulder and then stop, uncertain
 of just what will happen. You feel a sudden chill and drop your hand
 back down.

 "Do you... think that you can?"

 "Well that's the question, in'nit?" Marcus weighs your question for a
 few moments. "I guess right now, I... just don't know. It's, well.
 It's not something I've seriously tried before." Marcus gives you a
 dry look. "There's always a first time for everything." You start to
 smile.

 And then, it happens.

 There is a rush of wind that almost knocks you down--Marcus, looking
 behind you, sees it first and his eyes become as wide as dinner
 plates. You whip around to find out what's happening--and come face to
 face with the likes of something you have never before witnessed in
 any of your worst nightmares.

 For a frightening few moments your brain refuses to let you see what's
 right in front of your eyes clearly, however, it comes into focus soon
 enough. The thing's green-and-yellow skin is stretched taught over a
 collection of moving parts that look like they've been slapped
 together by a God gone mad. You can see things--ranging from gray
 tumorous growths to unidentifiable red streaks that glisten
 wetly--sliding around underneath the skin. It stands on six legs,
 making it look like a giant squatting insect. Each leg terminates with
 a long, silvery, wicked-looking prong that glints in the moonlight
 with what must be poison. Acidic-looking drool falls from the
 creature's open mouth filled with teeth as sharp as needles. It
 exhales, forcing you to step back and cough--it's as if the vapor
 actively seeks to burn out your lungs. The creature looks ill at ease
 on the ground, seeming more accustomed to flying with the huge
 jet-black wings sticking straight out from it's sides, flapping slowly
 and powerfully. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this thing,
 however, is that there appear to be no eyes on its face, and yet it is
 most definitely staring straight at you.

 Marcus lets out a yell that is mixed parts anguish and frustration.
 "Of course! Of course, just as soon as I start thinking about it it
 fucking comes back! Do you see, Kristen? Do you see what I have to
 deal with!"

 Graveyard
 You are in a graveyard. You can tell, see, because of the graves. They
 lie before you, headstones and crosses in little white rows. The moon
 casts feeble illumination over the scene, throwing deep shadows in all
 directions. You can see, to the west, the spires of a church. Any
 other landmarks are enclosed by a high stone wall enclosing the entire
 plot of land.

 The nightmarish creature eyes you menacingly, flexing its wings.

 Marcus peers at you, waiting.

 Large doors lead west into the church.

 The creature stabs its spear-like legs into the ground, advancing on
 Marcus with a grim sense of purpose.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a handgun (with 8 rounds)
   your trench coat (being worn)
     a match
     your keyring

 The creature reaches Marcus and grasps him around the middle, clasping
 him to its underbelly as it rears back upright for the kill. Marcus
 kicks and beats at the creature until one of its stilettos sinks into
 his shoulder, at which point his struggles soon weaken, and then stop
 altogether. You watch, mesmerized, as Marcus's already deathly pale
 visage is drained of all animation, leaving it a lifeless husk which
 the creature then carelessly discards over the wall.

 Its head swivels around to face you.

>shoot creature
 You raise the gun, sight down the barrel, and squeeze off a shot. The
 bullet hits the thing's face dead-on and makes a dull thud noise
 before dropping to the ground; the creature's head is thrown
 unnaturally far back by the force of the bullet, but other than that
 it doesn't seem to mind.

 The creature slowly but surely advances towards you, and then stops.
 It takes you a moment to realize why: it's standing in front of the
 hole you climbed out of, the dirt still shifting uneasily. You can't
 see any sort of expression mass over its triangular face but it
 appears to be considering the best way to pass this obstacle.

 You raise the gun, sight down the barrel, and squeeze off a shot. The
 bullet hits the thing's face dead-on and makes a dull thud noise

 unnaturally far back by the force of the bullet, but other than that
 it doesn't seem to mind.

>go west
 You see your chance and take it. You chop at the creature with your
 arm with all your might to get it out of your fucking way, and send it
 overbalancing and toppling to the ground--and then you're off and
 running, as fast as you've ever run in your life. The creature manages
 to right itself relatively soon, of course, but by then you've got a
 decent head start. Quickly you reach the doors of the church and throw
 your weight against them, shuffling inside and spinning on your heel
 immediately upon entering. (Comparatively) bright light spills out
 into the moonlit gloom, but from this angle it makes the outside even
 more difficult to see. You look over the door, frantically trying to
 find a way to secure it.

 Church
 The large doors stand open to the east.

 These are doors that look as if they have been transported from the
 17th century. A time when people took pride in everything they worked,
 and when a set of doors could mean only two things: being very, very
 open, or being very, very closed. The handles of the door are the only
 metal part of the door apart from the hinges, and stick out noticeably
 from each door. They are not a part of the door proper, however, and
 so there is a large amount of space between the handle and the door it
 is attached to; when the doors are closed, these handles line up
 perfectly. Above the door frame is an inscription which reads:
 "Welcome, friend, to a place free from all sin, where a weary traveler
 may rest a while, to be safe from his or her demons."

>examine handles

 You can hear the rush of air the creature's wings make as it flies
 towards you, but you can't see a thing; the moonlight has all but
 disappeared, making the creature's jet black wings completely
 invisible.

>close doors
 Grasping the handles of the double doors with a death grip, you push
 the doors shut. The resulting boom reverberates throughout the entire
 pulpit, sending dust motes flying in all directions. You know that it
 won't be enough, though. These doors open inwards, and there is no
 latch. How the hell do you lock this thing...?! Looking frantically
 about, you notice a massive iron bolt propped up against the wall.

>get bolt
 You take the bolt from where it's leaning against the wall and ram it
 through the space in between the handles of the door. It's almost
 anticlimactic, really; no solid feeling of locking into place, no
 dramatically appropriate thunk. Then you take a step back and look at
 the door--at how the horizontal bolt goes through the vertical
 handles--and raise an eyebrow. Locked, the door now has a perfect
 metal cross sealing it shut.

>look
 Church
 To the east, the large doors stand shut.

 The creature bangs itself against the door; you hear it as a muted
 thud of all six of its deadly spears impacting with the thick wood.
 There's no way of telling, of course, but you don't imagine it can get
 through this way.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

 You tense, preparing for another blow against the double doors--and
 hear none. You pause for a few more seconds, waiting. Silence. After a
 few moments even the rhythmic flapping of wings fades. You hold your
 breath for another long moment, and then slowly let it out. You are
 alone now.

>wait
 Time passes.

>look
 Church
 Softly burning oil lamps attached to the walls by iron brackets cast a
 warm, pleasant illumination all around this monumental structure.
 Tilting your head upward, you cannot see the ceiling; just a dark
 space where the light of the fires cannot reach. The doors that lead
 out to the graveyard are to the east; in front of them is the pulpit
 complete with wooden lectern. In front of that, the pews sit in their
 solemn, respectful rows. There's an undeniable beauty to this place, a
 sort of old-age splendor that you're not used to seeing these days.
 The building has the look of a labor of love built by many strong
 hands with keen eyes and an intense attention to the minute but
 significant details which a religious structure requires. Offsetting
 that is a small, plain-looking wooden door in the south wall.

 To the east, the large doors stand shut.

 On the lectern is an a black, weighty tome.

>examine tome
 Very interesting, this book. The light seems to slide off of the
 cover, leaving it a small pool of inky blackness wherever it lies.
 Just looking at it gives you eyestrain; maybe it's just the light, or
 maybe there is no title printed on this book at all.

>read tome
 You flip the book open to a random page. The words shine from the
 paper, in a wide-spaced font that leaves little room on the page: "The
 secrets contained within the town of Gainesville are for you, and only
 you. The book from which you are now reading is intended to help give
 you a tool for you to use to conquer your demons. If the burden
 becomes too heavy, this volume gives you the power to dispel anything
 that dares to stand against you. How you choose to use this tool is

 Your eyes briefly slide over the rows upon rows of pews--this church
 looks like it could have seated hundreds of people. But it is now
 empty.

>pray
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go south
 As you step towards the exit, a hand shoots out of a pool of shadow
 cast by the lamplight beneath the door and seizes one of your
 shoulders in a vice-like grip. You start to whip around but the hand
 does that for you, bringing you face to pouchy, fat face with your
 father.

 "Well," he says, cold eyes boring into your face with an unmistakable
 air of malevolence. "Well... well well." He looks you up and down,
 taking in the disheveled state of your clothes; the dirt you've
 tracked all over the church floor. He just sighs. "You know, I miss
 the old days. They knew how to handle uppity women back then. I
 wouldn't have to deal with this kind of disrespect then, I'd just
 black your eye. But now I gotta tiptoe through the goddamn tulips else
 y'all start screaming 'He hit me! Raape! Domestic assaauult! Aaaaahh!'
 and I gotta dip into my retirement funds to get lawyers and blow
 through court dates and skip town and it's just such a stupid waste of
 time. Ah, time. We all have such a limited amount of time. Do you see
 what I am saying, Kristen?"

 "Get your FUCKING hands off me you *cretin*--"

 "Temper, temper, child," his face growls. His grip increases, your
 shoulder crying out in pain. You aim a sidehand chop at his arm; under
 normal circumstances you're quite certain it would have broken his
 wrist, but it doesn't seem to have fazed him. "This is a dangerous
 place. You can die, and there won't even be any carrion to come 'round
 to strip your bones. Not even the worms will love you. So watch your
 step, or you'll find yourself back in a 6-foot hole like your doped-up
 fag friend back there." He shakes his head. "Fine fucking company for
 my daughter to associate with. So that she can become... Just. Like.
 THEM." He spits with disgust. "We've tried. You know? We really did.
 But you just wouldn't have any of it. So off you go."

 Quick as a flash, his hand lets go of your shoulder to whip towards
 your face; you lean back to avoid the devastating punch you're sure is
 coming to break your nose, and his fist closes over your chin. His
 fingers are like iron; his horse-like face is brought an inch from
 yours as he hisses at you to open your mouth. You grit your teeth; he
 slaps you across the face. His strength wins out over your will; his
 other hand comes out and forces a pill down your throat. You gag with
 all your might, but it's no good. He releases you, backing up a few
 steps, wiping off his hands on his robes as if ridding himself of a
 particularly unseemly form of vermin. You always thought he'd make a
 great name for himself as a preacher, and damned if he doesn't look
 the part now. Amazing the things that run through your mind at times
 like these. As bad as you usually feel for putting him in the
 hospital, right now you can't think of anything other than how much
 you wish you'd finished the job.

 "That's better, Missy. This'll fix you right up. Now get out of here.
 You're a Cymbalta child now... Not mine."

 His words echo into the near distances, feeling as if they're
 traveling a thousand miles to drop into your head. Your father's face
 morphs into the face on the Christ statue, creating some sort of
 unwholesome amalgamation, lamps raining fire down upon you as the
 world turns away. Inside your mind, you hear the church bell... hell's
 bell... school bell? Oh, right. The bell to end first period, it rang
 right before everything really went to shit. Good times.

 The creature stabs its spear-like legs into the ground, advancing on

>shoot creature
 Oh hell yes you are shooting that goddamn thing. You raise the gun to
 your shoulder, don't bother sighting, and squeeze the trigger; the
 bullet leaves the barrel at approximately holy wow that's really fast
 speed and scores a solid hit directly on the creature. And then
 glances off, speeding away into the night.
 There's an almost Looney Tunes-esque moment where you look down at
 your gun, just to check and make sure that there isn't a flag sticking
 out of the end of the barrel reading "bang!" (with all of the insanity
 that's happened so far it honestly would not surprise you at all.) The
 creature does, however, turn around from its dogged pursuing of
 Marcus--and looks at you. You start to wonder if there was any point
 in climbing out of that grave, to begin with.

 The creature slowly but surely advances towards you, and then stops.
 It takes you a moment to realize why: it's standing in front of the
 hole you climbed out of, the dirt still shifting uneasily. You can't
 see any sort of expression mass over its triangular face but it
 appears to be considering the best way to pass this obstacle.

>talk to marcus
 What do you want to say?
     1. "Marcus, get into the church!"
     2. "Marcus, push him into the hole!"

>2

 Marcus hears you, and seems to understand. Looking paler and more
 terrified than he ever has in his life, he slowly, too slowly walks
 closer to the thing--and then he looks at you, and a sudden warm light
 of both understanding and resolve fills his eyes. He charges the thing
 like a football player and barrels straight into it broadside. The
 creature, blindsided, still makes no noise even as it lurches
 sideways, tries to retain its balance, and in the process puts all of
 its weight on exactly the wrong leg. The unstable hole breaks open;
 the creature comes very close to seriously injuring both you and
 Marcus as it flails desperately for balance. There is none to be had,
 however, as the hole keeps collapsing, sending the creature helplessly
 further down into what was just a few short minutes ago your own
 grave.

 Wordlessly, you and Marcus both get busy with the dirt; shoveling it
 in handfuls, filling the hole as best you can. You don't stop even
 after the ground is even, you don't stop until there is a mound of
 solid-packed dirt that's almost up to your knees. Then you just stand,
 exhausted, looking at each other as if not quite sure what to do next.
 Then, quietly, he looks into your eyes and utters the one word you've
 wanted to hear from him for so long: "thanks." You nod, silently,
 unable to speak, tears silently filling your eyes. Marcus gives you a
 slow salute, and then turns around, walking slowly away from you
 toward the church; soon he is lost in the darkness.

 Marcus nods, and heads for the church at a dead run. He has to pass
 you while doing that though, and when he does, the creature whips one
 of its legs out--impossibly fast, and skewers Marcus through the
 collarbone. Marcus is brought up short and gurgles on blood. He looks
 like he would very much like to scream right now only he can't because
 something is blocking his lungs. The creature sadistically shakes its
 leg up and down, shredding some of Marcus's internal organs before it
 gets tired and contemptuously flings Marcus over the wall. You blink.
 You didn't even see the creature look at him once.

 Dreams, coming again and again, always unwelcome, always unwanted...

 Whether sadness, misery, horror or confusion, They never fail to
 induce negativity; in that, at least, this dream is no different. You
 float in void, filled with a roiling black static that seems
 conscious. There is nothing to see but the static, nothing to feel but
 your own form, and nothing to hear but the ghostly call of a child. It
 sets your teeth on edge even in the waking world; you can't stand that
 eerie wail, wavering between laughter and tears.

 You never find this child. Even though the sound gets closer, until it
 is right next to you, all around you, inside your own head before you
 are awakened by the alarm clock.

 This time, though...

 A figure swims out of the darkness, backlit, so that you can only make
 out a childlike face of tragic innocence and flowing hair.

 "Who... are you?"

 There isn't an answer right away--instead, everything around you turns
 completely white. And somehow... puffy.

 Do you know WHY you have always hated the sound, Kristen? The child,
 invisible now, speaks, for the first time; androgynous, cultured. You
 can't respond. you wish you could. It just sparks something deep
 within you, something primal--something below reason, below
 rationality, below everything but fear. You don't like it when your
 brain keeps secrets from you.

 I've waited a long time... and still am. Your surroundings flicker
 between the endless white and writhing black, the two merging into
 some unwholesome gray. Kristen... your child is waiting.








 "Your child is waiting."

 "Hmm?"

 "I said, your child is waiting."

 "WHAT?" You blinked furiously, trying to get your brain into some
 sense of working order; these dreams usually leave you a scattered
 mess, and you can't recall ever speaking to someone while that way.

 "I said--" The voice seemed testy.

 "No--stop. I heard what you said, I just... could you give me a
 moment?"

 You looked around... same bedroom, same lame-ass apartment, same
 everything... Awake. Normal. Except, not. You'd managed to register
 your ringing phone, pick it up, and get through the opener to this
 conversation, while sleeping. Not very like you. And she said--

 You felt a chill. "...Excuse me? Did you say that I have a--"

 "Child, yes ma'am--waiting for you in Gainesville." Click.

 "I don't have a..." The retort died on your lips. The hum of a
 disconnected telephone answered back at you, daring you to question
 its integrity.

 Patently ridiculous. You don't have a child. You never did. How could
 that possibly be? There must be some mistake, some incredibly stupid
 bureaucratic snafu. You'd love nothing better than to explain this
 fact to whoever that was, but since she hung up before you could get
 the words out, that's not really an option.

 That dream...

 Was a dream. You dream every night, and you haven't had any come true
 yet. Gainesville? Where is Gainesville? Most bloody generic name for a
 town ever, and you don't even recall there being one here. You
 wouldn't even know where it is.

 Except... you do. The way suggested itself even as you tried to deny
 it, as though you had always known. You're still certain, completely,
 that you've never heard of the place before; even the part of your
 brain that showed you the way confirms this.

 In the end, you don't know what your motivation was: sleep
 deprivation, deep seated confusion, nerves... maybe your body was just
 tired of waiting for your brain to catch up and got you dressed and in
 the car before you realized. Soon you were driving, to where you
 weren't sure, your mind screaming MADNESS while your hands deftly
 twisted the steering wheel. This would bother you, give you serious
 pause, but you somehow feel at peace with it. All you've gotta do is
 remind yourself that you had nothing else planned today.








 Obituary
 An Interactive Fiction by Drew and Johnny
 Release 1 / Serial number 090829 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 You stand up and stretch, various parts of your body making worrisome
 popping noises as you exit the car, noting with a vague sense of
 triumph that it has once again failed to cause your violent death in
 some spectacular fashion or other. The cold night air is chill against
 your skin--fortunate, then, that you brought your coat.

 Outskirts of Gainesville
 You stand on the side of the packed dirt road leading to Gainesville.
 The road stretches far away behind you to the south and, eventually,
 turns off into a paved one that leads back to the central transit
 explosion that is modern American transportation. Your vision of the
 town is obscured by the trees; all you can tell is that the path
 leads, for now, to the north.

 Your next-to useless, banged-up car is decidedly parked here. The
 driver's side door is shut smugly in your face.

>get in car
 (first opening the driver's door)

 Your Shit Car
 You don't like it much, partly due to a suspicion of yours (reinforced
 each new day) that it doesn't like you back. It seems to only want to
 start when you don't want it to, for reasons mechanics never even try
 explaining to you on the grounds that if you understood your car was
 just a crabby old bitch and needed some Midol, you might stop paying
 them what you already know is too much money every three fucking
 months.

 The driver's side door is flopped lethargically open. Staring at you.

>drive
 Yes, indeed, this is ludicrous. You don't even know what you're here
 for, really--it's probably some crank call or something. Of course now
 you've wasted a whole day but eh, beats working. You start your car
 and the long drive home. When you get inside, past 3:00 in the
 morning, you don't feel like doing anything but sleeping. So you do,
 and are haunted by more dreams. Then you wake up, dash the sleep from
 your brain with Very Black Coffee, and head in to... your job.

 Ugh, your job. How you fucking hate your job. You hate it with more
 passion than you've ever hated anything. It's the most inuring,
 mind-numbing, idiot-oriented piece of trash that ever earned the title
 of shit. Every day you see the same people, sell the same things, hear
 the customers and your co-workers say the same old crap. Every single
 day you see a new, glittering example of idiocy to the millionth
 power, people so stupid that you wouldn't even hire them to scrub your
 God damn floors. Fun as that is, you also get to listen to the
 President's sentient head polyp abusing the airwaves with a three-hour
 diatribe of bullshit on his favorite topic: how he's right about
 everything and everyone who disagrees is wrong and stupid and evil and
 worthless and going down to a ring of fire lower than the one reserved
 for rich drug-abusing hypocrites.

 While you try to set the countertop radio on fire with your mind, in
 troupe the 16 year old girls giggling for their birth control. Out
 they go to the sleazeballs that brought them there, twice their age,
 waiting in a convertible that could--should--cost more than their
 yearly salary. You sell them their precious baby barriers, resisting
 the urge to jam the register key into your carotid and bleed all over
 their shiny, shiny shoes. In the midst of your reverie, you can't help
 but idly reflect that there is something horribly, cruelly ironic
 about all this. Not just a Conservative talk show host blathering on
 about the moral decay of America in the 21st century while gleefully
 assisting in it, not just Rush fat-fucker Limbaugh playing at a drug
 store. The entire road map of your life, all the experiences and the
 choices that have brought you to this place and this time, combine
 into something too much like a giant Carlin routine on the true
 meaning of irony.

 Thankfully the day ends and you return home, carotid intact. As you
 talk to a few of your more distant friends over Yahoo IM, you think
 about telling them about the little "adventure" you went on the day
 before; in the end, though, you decide not to. It's so embarrassing,
 what did you even do it for? There's better ways to change the pace
 than taking eight-hour drives across the state to God knows where.
 Best to forget about it, concentrate on what's real.

 After a few hours of Internet surfing--accompanied by a few shots of
 Captain Morgan's--you head off to bed. The place of ceaseless dreams.
