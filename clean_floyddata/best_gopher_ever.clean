 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Entrance</span>
 You are at the main entrance to the town of Fairview. A large gate
 leads out of town to the south, and a short path runs north to
 Primrose Street.

 A well-dressed owl paces back and forth, murmuring worriedly.
 "Greetings!" he says in a deep voice. "I am Alfred P. Owl, the mayor
 of Fairview. Oh, it's an awful situation. Throughout our town, the
 animals have problems, very serious problems. Please, please help us!"
 He clasps his wings imploringly. "Come back after you have helped at
 least five of our hapless residents."

 suitcase, and it's pretty small, so I'm just carefully retracing my
 steps." She sighs. "This is going to take a while."

 Outside Theater
 Here Willow Avenue passes between the Footlight Theater to the west

 A confused-looking hen stands in front of the theater. "Stop a moment!
 My name is Cornelia Hen. Please help me. I can't leave my post of
 course, but I absolutely have to have...it was a...well now, what was
 it?" She scratches her head.

 Cornelia says, "Oh, I remember! I need...I think...was it? No, it

>t
 "Hmm," says the hen, "maybe...was it...yes? No. No? No. Yes. No."

>map help
 There are three map sizes. To switch between them, type FULL, TRIM, or
 TINY.

 FULL is the normal size. If the map doesn't seem to fit in your
 display window, try TRIM, which is a little smaller. If that still
 doesn't fit, you can use TINY, which is much smaller but leaves out
 information like the connections between locations.

 The map also requires a fixed-width font. If it looks messed up, check
 the font settings of your interpreter program.

 Cornelia says, "Oh, I remember! I need...I think...was it? No, it

 Tobias Rat stands next to the table, weeping into a handkerchief.

 That can't be good!" She shuts it off. "Why they installed an oil

 can't find my mail bag, and if I don't find it then I can't deliver
 anything, and I will be in SO much trouble, and I'm going to get

 he says.

>give pencil
 Professor Ram puts the unsharpened pencil in the machine. He pushes a
 large black button. Sparks fly between the metal rods. A few seconds
 later, he reaches in and pulls out a sharpened pencil. "Here you go,"
 he says.

 Just then you hear a buzzer, and the metal rods stop vibrating. "Out
 of juice again," says the professor. "Don't worry, it should recharge
 soon."

 forgotten what the problem is! But I find, if I just keep talking to
 her long enough, she eventually remembers."
