 You were here was compiled and implemented by Joshua Houk from
 November 2014-January 2015 in Inform 7 for the 8th Annual New Year's

 (or rough equivalent) of all available interactive fiction releases in
 the year 2014 as listed in the Interactive Fiction Database
 ([<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/">LINK</A>]). For the zblorb release, these are randomized
 and compiled into a single parapgraph of room description.

 What time is it? Die große Wiese war ein Teppich aus saftigem Grün,
 umgeben von Flüssen und durchzogen von schmalen Bächen. You've lived
 in this town since you were born. The ring Yulia's grandmother gave
 her wasn't very pretty - an overworked silver band, rough black stone
 surrounded by an ill-thought combination of colored gems - but she
 wears it while Grandma Eva is in town.

 The street is so quiet, where are all the cars? "I want everything on
 the menu," Caroline says, giving you a challenging smile. Curtis turns
 off the loping diesel engine and spits in the dirt and stares toward
 the fence row to the south of his property. One morning, you're awoken
 by the slamming of the front door and a wave of overwhelming physical
 sickness.

 The room is full of all sorts of equipment which might make sense if

 You stand, a stiff column with arms clasped behind your back. A bread
 knife, a tea strainer, a breadbox, and a tea tin are scattered on the
 counter. As on every Friday, a few guys and gals from work meet at the
 local waterhouse, "Cullen's." There was once a man who lived in a hut

 You found this booth in a run-down shopping mall, tucked between the

 injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he
 ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. Oak chopped slowly pieces will

 For you, it might bring back pleasent memories of the time they tried

 As the chaos dies down, you hear a faint voice through the door. Paul!
 "Alex, it's me!"
 "Paul! Don't come in. The room is flooded and the water is electric!"
 "I leave you alone for one minute ... anyway, listen! 26.3 % of the
 people on this plane have turned into Sharkmen."
 "Only the biosex males?"
 "Okay, okay, into Sharkpeople. Anyway, listen: I'll try to be as
 inconspicuous  as possible, but they're looking for you. It's only a
 matter of time till they found out you're stuck in that unfortunate
 body."
 "Well, my original body is rotting in an endless chasm on Mercury,

 "One thing at a time. You know that multitasking is horrible for your
 stress level."
 "What is your plan?"
 "Your soul has wandered before, and I don't mean that krokodil you did
 with those Russian dealers. When you saved me, you jumped into -"
 "Enough exposition and recap! You're saying I should find a way to
 jump into Ellison?"
 But Paul doesn't answer, and there's the some commotion outside the
 door.
 "Get him!" says a deep, dark Sharkman voice.
 "Don't hurt me!"
 "Why not?"
 "Please, I'll tell you literally everything!"
 "Where is your husband?"
 "Okay, maybe I meant figurativ-ouch"
 It sickens you to your stomach as you hear something heavy slump
 against the door. A second later someone bangs on the door.
 "Open up! Sharkpolice!"
 "Sorry, sir, I'm a little girl with Typhoid fever and you don't want
 to come in here!"
 (You knew all this Victorian novels Paul made you read would be good
 for something at some point.)
 "Uh...okay" says the Sharkpoliceman, uncertainty in his voice. "Then,

 But now he's hunted by an insance duct cleaning robot? That's, um,

 <span class="floydstyle i">Airplane Bathroom</span> (on the toilet)
 This room is gigantic! From up here on the toilet you see a deadly
 ocean of electrified water, a huge sink (forever out of reach) and an
 Air Vent high up on the wall, almost reachable.

 The dead husk of the robot lies here, sparking occasionally.

 On the toilet you can see Marsha.

 You climb onto Marsha's side with some effort. Man, living the cage
 life on cheese and crackers has not prepared you for this. It's all
 Paul's fault, you muse, as you take aim at the opening of the air
 duct, he's far too nice to this rat. Then again, he is, or was, too
 you. You feel a pang of longing for the old home life, with your
 rampages on New Year's Day the only break in the blissful monotony.
 And then you jump.
 Small feet scramble on the smooth wall as gravity takes an
 unflatteringly strong hold on your rear end. You scratch and push and
 scowl, but finally you're in the air vent. You rest there for a minute
 and listen to your heartbeat, resting flat on the cool metal. You
 count 387 beats a minute and hope that's in the normal range.

 (first opening the grating)
 Looking back at the half crazed machine, and looking down into the

 You notice a small hatch.

 A small, metal hatch, and a keypad besides it. A sticker reads:

 *flop*
 The parachute opens and you beging slowly drifting towards the ground,
 while the robot becomes a smaller and smaller speck below. After some
 time, you land.
 But what now? The plane gets smaller and smaller, as it flies away
 high above you. You have no way to find out what they're doing to Paul
 and all your other friends, being just a small rat stranded somewhere
 in the middle of nowhere. Looks like there's nothing but wallow in
 self-pity for months now.

 You mope around for a few months, but then you regain your spirits.
 After a few weeks of adventure that will be turned into a midquel if I
 ever run out of ideas, you stumble upon a newspaper in a back alley
 somewhere on the east coast. It reads:

 <span class="floydstyle em">Chicago Shark-Times</span>
 RESISTANCE LEADERS PUT UNDER HOUSE ARREST
 The Mosshark announces at a press conference yesterday that two of the
 most influencal leaders of the resistance, Temporologist Dr. David
 Elbe and the man only known as Paul, were arrested yesterday at a
 Starbucks in New York. Both diabolical anarchists have been placed
 under house arrest in the latters former residence and it's assumed
 they'll be executed as soon as the law allows, so in 15 years or so.

 Oh no! You need to save Paul and that other guy! Man, it's gonna be a
 long and complicated journey until you even get to...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your House</span>
 You are sitting in the middle of your  neatly-trimmed front lawn,
 hoping that Paul didn't get that cat. Even though you've seen your
 house daily for years and years, you have the weird feeling of being
 here for the first time.

>examine house

 Uh oh! There is a cat flap. You slip through it, hoping for the best.

 The acid bath he took in the last game hasn't done much for his

 You kick the bedroom door and it crashes open. (It wasn't really
 locked). Paul jumps up from the bed with a shriek. He looks thinner,
 bestubbled, his hair dyed some time ago but the roots are showing. He
 blinks and then jumps into your arms. You hold him for some precious
 moments, emotions swirling in you that you are too manly to express.
 Video games have told you well.
 "You have your body back! You have to tell me all about it!"
 "No time, there will be a flashback later."
 "Later?"
 "Earlier for me, er, the player, er, nevermind. We've gotta get out of

 "Not so fast, we need to save Dr. Elbe."
 "The famous temperologist? Where is he?"
 "Actually, she goes by Dana these days. But that's not important. She
 climbed out the window to attack the Sharkmen while they are having
 dinner in the kitchen."
 "Attack? With what?"
 "I told her of your secret weapons stash in the undergrow. Anyway, we
 and makes shooing motions with his hands.
 "What about you?"
 "I'm staying here. You know I hate guns."
 You nod and grab his head and kiss him gently.
 "See you soon. Don't die on me again."
 "You wish. Oh here."
 It's a bit late for a Christmas present, but here's your uncle."
 Paul looks at the bottle and whistles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden Area</span>
 Paul's parents loved this garden, and so do you. It's sorrounded on
 three sides by walls overgrown by undergrowth, so as to hide the
 family members going for a seamelss tan.This wasn't necessary for the
 southern wall, wich is quite high, because it borders on a Golf course
 (Pauls told you they find the occasional golf ball in the pool
 nonetheless). It seems that the Pool has been drained some time ago.

 The silhouettes of Sharkmen move through the fog.
 Also, you once again don't feel safe.

 Dr. Elbe kneels behind the barricade, aiming the M60 at the advancing
 Sharkmen.

 Your most prized possession, an original Colt Army Model 1860 lies
 beside Dr. Elbe.

 A ginger cat lies on one of the reamining deck chairs, watching the
 proceedings with weary disinterest.

 Now your deck-chairs have been piled up to make a barricade. Behind
 it, Dr. Elbe, in a tasteful yet practical summer dress kneels,
 reloading your M60 machine gun. She expertly feeds the belt of 7.62 mm
 NATO cartridges ( or .308 Winchester) into it, and you notice that she
 uses your M122 tripod.
 As you scramble to your feet, you notice a huge wall of smoke from the
 huge glass doors that lead inside, to the kitchen.
 You quickly jump behind the barricade for cover.

 Oh no! The Sharkman jumps over the barricade and lands on top of you.

 Sharkmen coming through the doors. Man, your kitchen must look like

 "Quick!" she shouts. "Get over the wall!"
 "Quick, Paul, I'll boost you." You stare at his ass a little more than

 You look back at Elbe, who provides more and more desperate covering
 fire.
 "It's noble she's sacrifing herself, but I don't feel comfortable with
 such a clichéd end for a minority character."
 "Sacrifice myself? Are you crazy? Cover me from up there, you dick."

 You get a good foothold on the wall to shoot it, even with foregrip.
 Better unfold the tripod.

 Dr. Elbe begins to climb the wall, somewhat hindered by the bullets
 hitting the wall around her and by her flowing dress.

>unfold tripod

 You unfold the tripod and try to find a good place on the wall to put
 it.

>shoot sharkmen

 You get a good foothold on the wall to shoot it, even with foregrip.
 Better unfold the tripod.

 Dr. Elbe looks at you angrily.
 "Uh, how about that covering fire?"
 "Damn thing was ..."
 A tracer sizzles overhead so close it nearly sets your hair on fire.
 "Hey!" shouts Paul, "I'm all for addressing problems directly, but how
 about COMING THE FUCK DOWN HERE first?"
 Dr. Elbe nods and scurries down into the Golf course, with you close
 behind.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Golf course</span>
 You are at the foot of a small, sloping hill, the lawn neatly cut. You
 can go eastwards, uphill. The wall of your garden is here.

 Dr. Elbe stands around here, eyes alert.

 Paul stands around, smiling at you affectionately.

>kiss paul

 Paul might not like that.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hilltop</span>
 You are on top of one of the innumberable hills of the golf course.
 You can see the whole golf course around you, which is boring as hell.
 The only interesting part seems to be one of the entrance gates to the
 northeast. West is the wall to your garden.

 You can see a golf cart (closed) here.

 Paul trudges along.

 Elbe follows you.

>unlock cart with key

 You unlock the golf cart.

>open cart

 You open the golf cart.

>enter golf cart

 You get into the golf cart.

 Paul shu-shus at you. "Scoot over, you're driving all the time."
 "All the time? I've been death for a while."
 Nevertheless, you slide over on the passager seat.

 Dr. Elbe climbs onto the backseat and grabs the M60 from your hands.
 She quickly unfolds the tripod and installs the machine gun on the
 rear end of the car. "Okay, ready."
 Cool, looks like you don't have to do anything.

>sleep

 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Paul goes northeast in the golf cart, taking you along.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Entrance Gate</span> (in the golf cart)
 A metal gate bars the way out to a lovely country lane.
 Oh wait, that's what this usually looks like. Now you look closer for
 the first time in years and realize there's a cemetery on the other
 site of the road. The way back is sw. I mean southwest.

 Dr. Elbe is on the backseat, at the M60.

 Paul drives the golf cart.

 Hello no! This thing is doing a breakneck 30 mph.

 You drive past the cemetery and Paul expertly does a handbrake turn to
 the right. The cemetery passes to the left, and you have the
 conversation from the intro.

 Paul goes northeast in the golf cart, taking you along.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Country Road</span> (in the golf cart)
 Spielertor is one of the oldest National Parks in the state, which you
 can easily tell from the forest.

 Dr. Elbe is on the backseat, at the M60.

 Paul drives the golf cart.

 What was a black shape down the road a second before turns into tank
 that's gaining on you very fast. Elbe starts firing the M60, with
 little effect.
 "Damn, Alex" cries Paul, "do something!"

 Paul goes northeast in the golf cart, taking you along.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Forest</span> (in the golf cart)
 This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there
 appears to be sunlight.

 Dr. Elbe is firing at the tank. Bullets riochet off the armor
 uselessly. Still, she seems to have fun.

 Paul drives the golf cart.

 The tank is chasing you!

>throw tube at tank

 Futile.

>examine tank

 It's black and huge, bulky yet sleek. Luckily, they can't get you with
 their gun turret, but a dude with an Assault Rifle (seems to be an
 update model of the M16) fires at the cart from behind a manhole
 cover.

>Elbe, shoot manhole cover

 "I'd like to help, Doc, but I'm unarmed. Got any of my stash left?"
 "Sorry, no, but I can give you this."
 She throws you something that is either a very big laser pointer or a
 very small flashlight.
 "Oh, is this a laser gun?"
 "No."
 "A lightsaber?"
 "Unfortunately, also no."
 "So, what is it?"
 "It's a very powerful laser. Not powerful enough to hurt anyone-"
 "Aww"
 "-but you could use it as a, you know, laser pointer."
 "I'll keep that in mind when I want to PowerPoint (tm) them to death."

 Paul swerves over the road wildly, trying to avoid the gunner's fire.
 "Dr. Elbe! Get that guy!"
 "He's too well protected. This looks like a job for the protagonist."
 "Just give me the g..."
 But just at that moment something terrible breaks through the dense
 foliage. It's a quadruple human, ridden by a Horseman. That's the most
 horrible thing you ever saw, at least since Paul had that herpes
 problem.

 Paul goes northeast in the golf cart, taking you along.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Forest</span> (in the golf cart)
 This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads
 north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches
 stands at the edge of the path.

 Dr. Elbe is firing at the tank. Bullets riochet off the armor
 uselessly. Still, she seems to have fun.

 Paul drives the golf cart.

 The tank is chasing you!

 The Horseman rides the Manhorse very closely alongside the cart, in
 hot pursuit.

>point laser at manhorse

 That may look interesting, but does nothing.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Clearing</span> (in the golf cart)
 You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on all sides. A
 path leads south. On the ground is a pile of leaves.

 He just leans away. Damn! He's close. If there was only some way to
 get over there.

>jump on horse

>jump on manhorse

 You lean out of the cart, grabbing the roof with one hand.
 "What are you doing?" screams Paul.
 "We need to stop-"
 "Don't say horsing around!"
 "Okay." And then you jump.
 After some dramatic scrambling, you sit in the saddle behind the
 confused Horseman.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Clearing</span> (on Manhorse)
 You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on all sides. A
 path leads south. On the ground is a pile of leaves.

 A tank is chasing you, and a guy with an assault rifle fires at the
 golf cart.

 You can also see a golf cart (in which are Dr. Elbe and Paul) here.

 A horseman sits before you.

 Paul goes northeast in the golf cart.

 The Horseman rides the Manhorse very closely alongside the cart, in

>push horseman

 You punch the horseman in the kidneys, and pull him off the manhorse.
 With a Wilhem winny, he falls by the wayside.
 The manhorse keeps following the golf cart.

>point laser at tank

>jump onto cart

 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>examine dude

 A sharkman with an assault rifle!

>jump on cart

 You don't want to jump on that.

>examine manhorse

 The Manhorse is as a big horse, but looks like a man! Surprisingly, he
 manages to keep up with the cart. One of the saddlebags is marked with
 some writing.


 It says "DANGER! EXPLOSIVE."

 Paul goes northeast in the golf cart.

 This dangerous act would achieve little.

 Y'all arrive at a nice fire tower, and at a glance you see the package
 for Elbe on the floor, but there is no room for you to go, and the
 tank runs over the golf cart with a terrifying crunch (everyone
 escapes unharmed).

 You aim the tube at the tank. This will either net you a Darwin Award
 or be awesome,you think.
 The grenade ignites.
 The tube burns up in your hands faster than aluminum foil. There is a
 loud hissing and a trail of smoke towards the tank.
 For a second, nothing happens. With a loud, defeaning roar, the tank
 explodes, pushing over the golf cart, throwing you off the horse and
 into the woods. You crash against a tree and fall down. Around you,
 the forest has quickly caught fire. Flames roars, and metal cracks in
 the distance. You try to get up, but your back hasn't hurt this bad
 since your first yoga practice.

 messily."
 Then you notice his red glowing eyes and crap your pants (not
