 Ahhhh! Another can of refreshing Coca-Cola! You sigh in contentment as
 you partake of the sweet carbonated beverage, so recently purchased.
 But what's this? The dispenser light is still on! You can select
 another! You pause, though. The labels seem to be different than they
 were before,...

 At the Coca-Cola Dispenser
 Of all the places in the world to obtain the sweet goodness of
 Coca-Cola products, this has to be your favorite. The Coke machine
 dominates the landscape, resting snugly against the perfect brick wall
 next to the unbroken sidewalk, which seems to lead to untold
 possibilities, their potential unlocked by the mere presence of
 Coca-Cola.

>go east
 You can't bring yourself to leave the Coke Machine. At least, not
 while there are free buttons left to push.

>examine machine
 This Coke machine has served you well. It is always full, always has
 exact change, always operates smoothly, and always keeps its
 assortment of Coca-Cola products chilled at exactly the right
 temperature. Right now, though, the buttons don't seem to have the
 same labels they used to. The 'Select!' light is still on, meaning you
 can push the following buttons:

 **Curses**
 **Adventure**
 **Planetfall**
 **Hitchhiker**
 **Grip**
 **A Bear's Night Out**

 You'll have to specify which button you wish to push.

 This demo is now over, but there's Always Coca-Cola!


 At the Coca-Cola Dispenser
 Of all the places in the world to obtain the sweet goodness of
 Coca-Cola products, this has to be your favorite. The Coke machine
 dominates the landscape, resting snugly against the perfect brick wall
 next to the unbroken sidewalk, which seems to lead to untold
 possibilities, their potential unlocked by the mere presence of
 Coca-Cola.

>examine machine
 This Coke machine has served you well. It is always full, always has
 exact change, always operates smoothly, and always keeps its

 place!


 Chatelet-Les-Halles
 This is a vast underground station in great rectangular caverns, deep
 beneath the streets. You are outside the ticket gates, near a flight
 of steps back up to the city, and since you haven't a ticket you're
 likely to stay that way.

 Behind a kiosk, a surly-looking man is selling guide books and maps.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a crumpled piece of paper
   a can of Coca-Cola

>examine paper
   Things to do:

   1. Find map.
   2. Phone airport to check parking.
   3. Health forms...

 and so on. Let's face it, 1. is more enticing than the rest put
 together.

>examine man
 His jumper is unstriped, and there are no onions around his neck.
 Nonetheless he has a rather Gallic, disgruntled look to him. Perhaps
 he's a former Socialist cabinet minister.

>examine coke
 Truly, all of your desires can be assuaged with the refreshing
 goodness inside this can.

 Aaaaah! What joy! What bliss! What unbearable ecstacy of delight!

>ask man about coke
 He refuses to understand you, on principle.

>ask man about map
 "Non."  And he folds his arms defiantly. Perhaps he has no such thing.

>give coke to man
 The man snatches the Coke from you, sneers, and drains it in one huge,
 unhurried swallow.

 He glares at you for a moment, and then a change ripples across his
 features. "Merci," he croaks in a voice unaccustomed to politeness. He
 shudders, and then shakes himself like a dog exiting water.

 He stares down at his jumper in disbelief, and rips it off, revealing
 a New York Giants T-shirt underneath. He shakes his head, clears his
 throat, and tries again.

 "Thanks, buddy!" he exclaims, in what is manifestly a New Jersey,
 rather than a French, accent. "This is in-freakin'-credible! You've
 cured me of being a freakin' Frog! Holy freak! You freakin' RULE!"

 "Oh, you wanted the freakin' map?"

 He shrugs and hands you the map of Paris. You feel a shiver ripple
 through the multiverse as the ancestral Curse of the Meldrews is
 lifted.

 "I dunno why the freak you'd wanna go there, though. It's all covered
 in freakin' dog crap, and worse than that, it's full of freakin'
 Frogs! No, you need someplace better than that."

 He scratches his head, encountering his beret, which he flings into
 the darkness.

 "I know!" he shouts. "At-freakin'-lanta! Birthplace of Coca-Cola! Only
 the greatest freakin' drink in the history of the freakin' world!
 Yeah! C'mon! I got a cousin Vinnie who knows a guy who knows a guy who
 can get you a sweet freakin' deal on the trip!"

 Arm in arm, the two of you leave the Underground behind. After a
 fantastic vacation in Atlanta, the highlight of which is (of course)
 the "World of Coke" exhibit, you somehow find yourself...

 Rain and mud. And the taste of something, sweet in your mouth.

 Those are your first solid memories. Rain pouring down on your head,
 filling your eyes. Mud beneath your feet, filling your shoes. And, of
 course, there's always Coca-Cola -- or is there? A sudden feeling of
 loss sweeps over you, and a chill wind cuts through your clothes with
 ease.

 Shelter would be a good beginning.


 Muddy Glade
 The trees around you are spaced far enough to provide little shelter,
 allowing the stinging rain to pelt you. A grey mist conceals
 everything past four meters.

>push grip
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east
 You strike off in that direction, but soon become disoriented by the
 rain.

 Muddy Field
 Once the field might have been covered in grass. Now the grass is but
 a memory. Mud covers the ground in its place, fed by the constant
 rain.

 Buried almost to its chin in the mud is a human head.
 The head glances northeast for a moment. "Just a sip, that's all I
 ask. One little sip of Coke."

 You are carrying:
   a bottle of cola

 "So thirsty ... So, so thirsty ..."

>kick head
 The head's eyes widen as you draw your foot back. "Terry, no, please,
 oh God you can't--"  His cries are cut short as your foot slams into
 him. With the sound of eggshells cracking, the head fragments into
 countless pieces which are quickly lost in the mud.

>examine bottle
 A bottle of some dark, fizzy substance. But it's definitely not Coke.

>/undo

>/undo
 Muddy Field
 [Previous turn undone.]

 Other than being buried in mud to his chin, the head is reassuringly
 normal. His hair and mustache are a matted brown, perhaps from
 genetics, perhaps from mud. Rivulets of water run down his creased
 face.
 The head glances northeast for a moment. "Just a sip, that's all I
 ask. One little sip of Coke."

>drink coke
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask head about coke
 There is no reply.

 "'Have A Coke and A Smile', they said. I'm smiling --" the head pulls
 its lips into a cracked grin. "Where's my Coke?"

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a bottle of cola
 "'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke'. And I did. So you OWE me!" The
 head's eyes flicker to the northeast.

 You can only do that to something animate.

>ask head about caffeine addiction
 There is no reply.

 "'Have A Coke and A Smile', they said. I'm smiling --" the head pulls
 its lips into a cracked grin. "Where's my Coke?"

 The head's eyes widen as you open the bottle and begin to pour.
 "Terry, no, please, oh God you can't--"  His cries are cut short as a
 stream of hissing liquid trickles into his mouth. His head seems
 almost involuntarily to wriggle its way further down into the mud, and
 quickly disappears. A few remaining drops of liquid drip from the
 bottle and splash down onto the soil, cutting tiny trails to the
 northeast.

>undo
 Muddy Field
 [Previous turn undone.]

>drink cola
>go northeast
 The mud coating him makes you think twice.
 "'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke'. And I did. So you OWE me!" The
 head's eyes flicker to the northeast.

 The madness and confusion of this place drives you to
 ever-more-desperate acts. But here, at the brink, you manage to summon
 your courage and honor and draw back.

 The head hums a Coke jingle to itself.

 As you walk away, the head screams at you. "Coward! You put me here!
 Can't you at least get me something to drink?"  Disturbed, you keep
 walking.

 Front of Building
 Looming suddenly out of the gloom is a large marble building. Its
 columns jut skyward, raked by the unending rain. To the north lies its
 entrance.

>go north
 As you walk through the door of the building the sound of the rain
 stops, as if suddenly turned off.

 Foyer
 The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north. On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway. The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.

 A section of the air just above your head shimmers. A small pyramid
 falls from the disturbance to the ground below.

>examine pyramid
 A small paper pyramid, about three centimeters on an edge.

>take pyramid
>take it
 The pyramid begins glowing softly. It unfolds like a flower and voices
 begin to issue from it, saying "Subject suffering from unusually low
 levels of sugar and caffeine..."  "Thirst dangerously unsatisfied..."
 (someone shouts) "Doctor! We must try the new experimental treatment,
 it's his only hope!" "Fine, get me a syringe."
 When the light dies down, the pyramid is gone.

 You can't see "it" (the paper pyramid) at the moment, unlike your
 Coke.

 You can't go that way.

 An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.


 South End of Hallway
 Like the foyer, the hallway is marble. Its two-story height combined
 with its thinness inspires unease. A walkway runs above you, clinging
 to the east and west walls. Below the east walkway is a doorway.

>examine walkway
 The walkway rings the hall on every side but the south, casting a
 shadow on the floor.


 South Half of Archive
 Just enough light filters in to show you row after row of boxes
 filling rack after rack of shelves, making it difficult to find a
 place to stand. The room continues to the north. Above the west exit
 is a clock.

 Cardboard boxes, all taped shut. Each one has been labeled with a
 black magic marker.

 Your eyes roam over their surfaces, taking in their titles. Many are
 labeled "Bottled: " with a range of dates following. A few are labeled
 "Carbonation." You feel an odd sense of disorientation as you stare at
 them.

 A red-faced clock with white hands. Above the hands is written the
 inscription "It's always time for Coca-Cola".

>go north

 North Half of Archive
 Metal shelves fill the hall; most are empty and many have succumbed to
 rust. The shelves that aren't empty hold broken shards of glass. The
 archive continues to the south, and an exit leads west.

>go west

 North End of Hallway
 The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you. The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest. A doorway to the east is mirrored by a
 closed door to the west.

>doors

>examine doors
 The carved doors are made of oak and are twice your height. They stand
 slightly ajar, leaving enough room for you to enter.

>open doors
 The doors have frozen in position over time. You cannot budge them.

>go west
 You can't, since the small door is in the way.

 You open the small door.


 Utility Room
 The room is hot and stifling -- makes you wish for a Coke right about
 now -- and cobwebs drip from every surface. A hot-water tank crouches
 in one corner. Rickety stairs lead into the depths of the building. To
 the east is an open door.

>go down

 Bottling Room
 A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you. The north and
 west walls are taken up by tables. A clock is just visible next to the
 stairs on the south wall. In the northwest corner is a tiny drain,
 while a pile of bottles has claimed part of the east wall.

 A man stands bent over the tables, jotting things down in a large
 notebook.

 As your footsteps sound on the stairs, the man turns. He looks you
 over, one eyebrow quirking in surprise. "Hello," he says. "And here I
 thought I was the last one still around. I'm Frankie."

 Frankie has better things to do.

>ask frankie about coke
 There is no reply.

>talk to man

 (the bottle of cola to Frankie)
 "Dear God, what is this?" he says. "I've seen some weird things in my
 day, kid, but nothing as weird as this. Take some advice from someone
 who's been around and stick with Coke." He hands it back.

>ask frankie about minimal NPC implementation
 There is no reply.

>examine drain
 The metal drain is a small circle with a grate about ten centimeters
 in diameter.

 The bottles are smooth and translucent, glowing softly from within.
 Several are caked with mud and dirt, testimony to their recent
 location. They have been stacked in a tight-fitting pyramid. You feel
 a strange sense of deja vu as you gaze into them.

>frankie, go to hollywood
 Frankie doesn't appear interested.

>get bottle
 Which do you mean, the pile of bottles, the bottle-opener, the bottle
 of Sprite or the bottle of cola?

 You reach your hand towards one of the bottles. As you draw nearer, a
 spark spits from the bottle, rushes up your arm, and then--

 Darkness, then light.

 You see yourself, a brief memory of buying a Coke for the first time,
 a muttered conversation, money changing hands, the hiss of a can
 opening, and then the taste. Ahhh.

 Light, then darkness.

 You'd been in the principal's office for hours. Got suspended for a
 week, you remember. But Billy Thimbleton was in the hospital with a
 broken arm and a black eye. That'll teach him to offer you a Dr.
 Pepper--

 With a horrendous wrenching sensation you pull yourself away from the
 pile of bottles. You glance at Frankie, but absorbed in his work, he
 has not noticed your momentary distress.

>take opener
 That seems to belong to Frankie.

>ask frankie for opener
 Frankie has better things to do.

>examine frankie
 Frankie is of middling height, with tousled hair and a sandy brown
 mustache. He carries a notebook and a bottle.  Resting in his shirt
 pocket is a bottle-opener.


>kill frankie
 As you prepare to attack Frankie, he turns and fixes you with a gimlet
 glare. "Now, now," he says softly. "Getting antsy without a caffeine
 fix, eh?"

>examine opener
 It looks like an ordinary bottle-opener, made out of metal with a
 pointy bit on one end.

>examine notebook
 You can't see any such thing.

>give coke to frankie
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:

>ask Frankie for coke

>ask Frankie for opener

 That seems to belong to Frankie.

>kick bottles
 Again you reach for the bottles, but cannot draw close. The rush of
 memories triggered by the bottles was overwhelming the first time.

 That seems to belong to Frankie.

 The bottle of Sprite is closed (but then, you don't care for it
 anyway).

 Frankie has better things to do.

 Bottling Room
 A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you. The north and
 west walls are taken up by tables. A clock is just visible next to the
 stairs on the south wall. In the northwest corner is a tiny drain,
 while a pile of bottles has claimed part of the east wall.

 Frankie is here, sorting and mixing.

>examine clock
 A red-faced clock with white hands. Above the hands is written the
 inscription "It's always time for Coca-Cola".


 Utility Room
 The room is hot and stifling -- makes you wish for a Coke right about
 now -- and cobwebs drip from every surface. A hot-water tank crouches
 in one corner. Rickety stairs lead into the depths of the building. To
 the east is an open door.


 North End of Hallway
 The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you. The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest. A doorway to the east is mirrored by an
 open door to the west.


 Northeast Walkway
 The walkway runs along the east wall of the hallway. A sweeping
 staircase joins the walkway to the southwest.

 You can't go that way.

 Audience Hall
 Your footsteps echo hollowly in the dimly-lit and cavernous hall.
 Benches line the floor, their rows skewed slightly to focus on the
 object at the north end. A clock is set in the wall in plain view of
 the desk. The south third of the room is covered by a balcony,
 reducing the height of the hall from two stories to one. A small door
 to the east and two large doors to the south stand ajar.

 A dust-covered Coke machine stands at the north end of the hall, the
 focus of attention.

 The Coke machine's lights are dimmed and the whole is covered with a
 thin coating of dust. "What demon hath robbed thee of thy vigor, noble
 machine?" you can't help but cry. Then you notice the power cord
 extending from the back of the machine, hanging limp on the floor mere
 inches from a socket.

>plug machine into socket
 Curses! Inches too short! What fiendish mind could have devised such a
 Tantalus-like torture?

 It is fixed in place. Unlike a typical refreshing Coke.

>examine socket
 It's an apparently ordinary light socket, tucked away against the
 wall.

 The plug is a dusty black in color. It extends from the back of the
 machine, just waiting to bring the electronic god to life again.

>pull socket
 It is fixed in place. Unlike a typical refreshing Coke.

>cut cord
 Cutting that up would achieve little.

 An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.

 You can't go that way.

 Violence doesn't solve anything. But Coke does!

 That can't contain things.

 You are carrying:
   a bottle of cola

 You feel nothing unexpected.

 Teddy bears, being soft toys, find such feats difficult.

 What you can see of yourself is familiar. But wait .. there's
 something different. Something wrong. You don't have a Coke!

 Not without dropping the cord, you don't.

  INTERACTIVE FICTION: IT'S BACK

  For too long since its heyday in the 80's, interactive fiction has
 languished in the ghetto of obscurity. Despite brilliant and
 insightful works by dozens of new authors, IF has continually failed
 to receive the recognition by the general community it so richly
 deserves. The solution? Corporate sponsorship.

  The Coca-Cola Corporation, in conjunction with the newly-formed
 Interactive Fiction Promotion Board (a wholly-owned subsidary of the
 Cola-Cola Corporation), is pleased to announce a new direction in text
 adventures, Interactive Fiction for the Next Millennium.


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our promotion plans will take several forms. Television and radio
 advertising, of course, will be a must. The marketing department is
 still working out slogans, but we have a number that seem promising,
 including "Zork: it's the choice of a new generation", "Just say 'No'
 to grues", and "Perdition's Flames: Mostly Dead".

  The opportunity for product tie-ins are also unlimited. Imagine being
 able to purchase an Elvish bottle-opener of great antiquity (glows
 blue in the presence of caffeine!), or a black rod with a rusty star
 on one end and the familiar red-and-white logo on the other. Or how
 about this: buy a six-pack of Coke, and get a hintbook for Curses!

  And speaking of Curses, that brings us to the most important aspect
 of the promotion -- IF development. Because that's what this is really
 all about, right? With the help of the Coca-Cola Interactive Fiction
 Promotion Board Foundation, full-time IF authorship is about to become
 a reality. Certain selected authors will be chosen based on the
 quality of their work to receive sponsored positions at the
 Foundation, with no other task than to continue producing the sort of
 games they've become famous for. Needless to say, these are expected
 to be highly-sought positions, but all members of the IF community are
 encouraged to apply. As examples of the sort of thing we'll be looking
 for, the Foundation has hired several current IF authors to rework
 parts of existing games in the new "Coca-Cola style".

  We hope you enjoy the package, and invite you to submit a demo game
 of your own ASAP!

  P.S. And remember -- when you see XYZZY, think Coke!

      A Message from Coca-Cola








 After seeing the wonderful promotional game 'The Lost Island of
 Alanna' on the Cherry Coke web site
 (<A HREF="http://www.cherrycoke.com/alanna/">http://www.cherrycoke.com/alanna/</A>), a group of us decided to contact
 Coca-Cola and see if they would be interested in doing a similar thing
 with IF. We had the good luck of being able to contact Mr. Fizzlewick,
 who surprised us all with the fervor of his interest in our idea.
 Soon, we were all hired and working frantically to produce
 'proof-of-concept' scenarios based on current works of IF. We managed
 to put this game together in time for their end-of-March manager's
 meeting, where JP was able to sell the idea to the group. If all goes
 well, you should see this game or something very similar go up on one
 of their web pages some time in April. In the meantime, JP wanted us
 to tell the rest of the IF community about the idea, so we put
 together this package and are uploading it to GMD.

 The following people comprise the group:

 Lucian Smith:  The main module and library replacement.
 Adam Thornton:  'Curses' module
 J. Robinson Wheeler:  'Adventure' module
 Michael Fessler:  'Planetfall' module
 Adam Cadre:  'Hitchhiker's Guide' module
 Dan Shiovitz:  'Losing Your Grip' module
 David Dyte:  'A Bear's Night Out' module


 'Coca-Cola' and 'Coke' are registered trademarks of the Coca-Cola
 bottling company.

 Utility Room
 The room is hot and stifling -- makes you wish for a Coke right about
 now -- and cobwebs drip from every surface. A hot-water tank crouches
 in one corner. Rickety stairs lead into the depths of the building. To
 the east is an open door.


 North End of Hallway
 The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you. The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest. A doorway to the east is mirrored by an
 open door to the west.


 South End of Hallway
 Like the foyer, the hallway is marble. Its two-story height combined
 with its thinness inspires unease. A walkway runs above you, clinging
 to the east and west walls. Below the east walkway is a doorway.


 Foyer
 The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north. On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway. The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.

 You start to take a step out the door, then pause. Somehow, the
 weather has turned from drenching rain to snow, colder than a Coke
 straight from the fridge. You shiver and retreat back to the warmth of
 the foyer.


 You can't go that way.


 South End of Hallway
 Like the foyer, the hallway is marble. Its two-story height combined
 with its thinness inspires unease. A walkway runs above you, clinging
 to the east and west walls. Below the east walkway is a doorway.

 You can't go that way.


 South Half of Archive
 Just enough light filters in to show you row after row of boxes
 filling rack after rack of shelves, making it difficult to find a
 place to stand. The room continues to the north. Above the west exit
 is a clock.

 The tape prevents you from oepning the boxes.

 There are too many, and you have no way of determining which are
 important.

 There are too many, and you have no way of determining which are
 important.


 North Half of Archive
 Metal shelves fill the hall; most are empty and many have succumbed to
 rust. The shelves that aren't empty hold broken shards of glass. The
 archive continues to the south, and an exit leads west.

>examine shards
 The glass fragments (perhaps broken bottles?) run the gamut from large
 shards to fine, gritty powder.

 You would most surely cut yourself.

>search shards
 You find nothing interesting (like a Coke).

 The shelves cover the room, as if they had multiplied in the same
 manner Coke bottles in the fridge don't. They are covered in broken
 shards.

>climb shelves
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.


 North End of Hallway
 The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you. The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest. A doorway to the east is mirrored by an

 in one corner. Rickety stairs lead into the depths of the building. To

 Bottling Room
 A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you. The north and
 west walls are taken up by tables. A clock is just visible next to the
 stairs on the south wall. In the northwest corner is a tiny drain,
 while a pile of bottles has claimed part of the east wall.

 Frankie is here, sorting and mixing.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Frankie is of middling height, with tousled hair and a sandy brown
 mustache. He carries a notebook and a bottle.  Resting in his shirt
 pocket is a bottle-opener.


>examine book
 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

 bottle-opener: That seems to belong to Frankie.
 bottle of Sprite: That seems to belong to Frankie.


 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>ask frankie about sprite
 "Actually, yeah, you could give me a hand here. Could you take this up
 to the top floor and get it opened? I'm not having much luck with my
 bottle-opener."  He hands you the bottle.

>examine notes
 "Top floor, I said. In the library."

 You can't see any such thing.

 Frankie says "I'm doing some observational analysis. I'd like to do
 some product synthesis of these bottles once I figure them out."

 Frankie shrugs. "I'd never seen you before you walked down the stairs.
 You look like you could use a Coke, though."

 Frankie grins sardonically. "I'm just an archaeologist, nothing more.
 My team and I were working on unearthing those," he gestures at the
 pile of bottles by the wall, "until we got word of the drink
 shortage."

 There is no reply.

 Northeast Walkway
 The walkway runs along the east wall of the hallway. A sweeping
 staircase joins the walkway to the southwest.

 You can't go that way.


 Southeast Walkway
 The walkway is cut off to the south by the rising walls of the foyer.
 There is a doorway to the east; the walkway continues to the north.


 Library
 The library is a dimly-lit backwards L curving around the end of the
 building. Shelves filled with books take up much of the room; the rest
 is inhabited by stacks of books. A metal sentinel guards the west
 exit; directly above it is a clock.

>examine book
 The books resemble case histories from a law library: leather binding,
 small type on their spines.

 The books resemble case histories from a law library: leather binding,
 small type on their spines.

 You pull one off the shelf at random and open it: "Coca leaves, cola
 nut, carbonated water, corn syrup, phosophorus .." You replace it and
 draw another: slightly different ingredients, slightly different
 method of preparation. Each recipe seems vaguely familiar, none seem
 quite right.

>examine guard
 A dark metal statue, reminiscent of a prop from Fritz Lang's
 Metropolis. A stern, angular head sits atop a sexless body seven feet
 tall. One arm hangs by its side -- the other extends outwards as if to
 grasp something.

>put sprite in hand
 The statue's relaxed hand suddenly blurs into life. It reaches up to
 the bottle, twists off the cap, and returns to the relaxed position
 almost before you noticed it moving. You (gingerly!) take the bottle
 back.

>drink sprite
 You think about it, but decide you'd really rather have a Coke.

>go east
 You can't go that way.


 Southeast Walkway
 The walkway is cut off to the south by the rising walls of the foyer.

 while a pile of bottles has claimed part of the east wall.

 Frankie is here, sorting and mixing.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>give sprite to frankie
 "Excellent!" Frankie says, taking the bottle from you. He immediately
 begins observing the Sprite and taking notes on its behavior. "By the
 way," he says, "I don't need this, and you might find it handy."
 Frankie takes the bottle opener out of his pocket and hands it to you.

 A quiet sound catches your attention. A black liquid has begun welling
 up through the drain, covering it and starting to fill the northwest
 corner.

 Frankie glances down, then swears quietly. "Sam, you son-of-a-bitch,"
 he mutters, scribbling furiously in his notebook.


>ask frankie about sam
 There is no reply.

 It looks like an ordinary bottle-opener, made out of metal with a
 pointy bit on one end.

 Hissing, the table legs begin to dissolve in the sludge. You hastily
 step away.

>ask frankie about black liquid
 There is no reply.

>open bottle
 Which do you mean, the pile of bottles, the bottle of Sprite, the
 bottle-opener or the bottle of cola?

>cola
 If you'd like to drink it, at least be honest with yourself and just
 say so. Otherwise, pour it someplace or something.

 Almost all the available floorspace is taken up by Pepsi. Several of
 the bottles in the pile have already been eaten away, their contents
 mixing with the sludge. You step back to a narrow spot by the stairs.

>go up

 Utility Room
 The room is hot and stifling -- makes you wish for a Coke right about

 in one corner. Rickety stairs lead into the depths of the building. To
 the east is an open door.

>drink cola
 The madness and confusion of this place drives you to
 ever-more-desperate acts. But here, at the brink, you manage to summon
 your courage and honor and draw back.

 Not with the Pepsi down there!


 North End of Hallway
 The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their

 the desk. The south third of the room is covered by a balcony,
 reducing the height of the hall from two stories to one. A small door
 to the east and two large doors to the south stand ajar.

 A dust-covered Coke machine stands at the north end of the hall, the
 focus of attention.

>put opener in socket
 You can't see any such thing.

 Somewhat unwisely, you jab the bottle opener into the socket. Current
 flows through your body and you twitch like a trout on a hook.

 You cry out as the floor collapses, dropping you into a seething pool

 This Coke machine has served you well. It is always full, always has
 exact change, always operates smoothly, and always keeps its

 temperature. Right now, though, the buttons don't seem to have the
 same labels they used to. The 'Select!' light is still on, meaning you
 can push the following buttons:

 **Planetfall**
 **Hitchhiker**
 **Grip**
 **A Bear's Night Out**

>push grip
 Your surroundings melt away, and you find yourself in a completely new
 place.



 Rain and mud. And the taste of something, sweet in your mouth.

 Those are your first solid memories. Rain pouring down on your head,
 filling your eyes. Mud beneath your feet, filling your shoes. And, of
 course, there's always Coca-Cola -- or is there? A sudden feeling of
 loss sweeps over you, and a chill wind cuts through your clothes with
 ease.

 Shelter would be a good beginning.


 Muddy Glade
 The trees around you are spaced far enough to provide little shelter,
 allowing the stinging rain to pelt you. A grey mist conceals
 everything past four meters.

 Front of Building
 Looming suddenly out of the gloom is a large marble building. Its
 columns jut skyward, raked by the unending rain. To the north lies its
 entrance.

 As you walk through the door of the building the sound of the rain
 stops, as if suddenly turned off.

 Foyer
 The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north. On the north wall to the west of the hallway's

 North End of Hallway
 The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their

 Your footsteps echo hollowly in the dimly-lit and cavernous hall.
 Benches line the floor, their rows skewed slightly to focus on the
 object at the north end. A clock is set in the wall in plain view of
 the desk. The south third of the room is covered by a balcony,
 reducing the height of the hall from two stories to one. A small door
 to the east and two large doors to the south stand ajar.

 A dust-covered Coke machine stands at the north end of the hall, the
 focus of attention.
 Violence doesn't solve anything. But Coke does!


 North End of Hallway
 The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors. Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you. The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest. A doorway to the east is mirrored by an
 open door to the west.

 Northeast Walkway
 The walkway runs along the east wall of the hallway. A sweeping
 staircase joins the walkway to the southwest.

 Southeast Walkway
 The walkway is cut off to the south by the rising walls of the foyer.
 There is a doorway to the east; the walkway continues to the north.


 Northeast Walkway
 The walkway runs along the east wall of the hallway. A sweeping
 staircase joins the walkway to the southwest.
 An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.

 Library
 The library is a dimly-lit backwards L curving around the end of the
 building. Shelves filled with books take up much of the room; the rest
 is inhabited by stacks of books. A metal sentinel guards the west
 exit; directly above it is a clock.

>take books
 You wouldn't know where to begin.

 You can't go that way.

 You can't go that way.

>read books
 You pull one off the shelf at random and open it: "Coca leaves, cola
 nut, carbonated water, corn syrup, phosophorus .." You replace it and
 draw another: slightly different ingredients, slightly different
 method of preparation. Each recipe seems vaguely familiar, none seem
 quite right.

>examine sentinel
 A dark metal statue, reminiscent of a prop from Fritz Lang's
 Metropolis. A stern, angular head sits atop a sexless body seven feet
 tall. One arm hangs by its side -- the other extends outwards as if to
 grasp something.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a bottle of cola
   a bottle-opener

 The statue's relaxed hand suddenly blurs into life. It reaches up to
 the bottle and twists off the cap. Hidden taste sensors activate, and
 the sentinel hurls the bottle to the ground, to shatter in a crash of
 glass and hissing fluid.

 I don't suppose the sentinel would care for that. I *do* suppose the
 sentinel would care for a refreshing Coke!

 North Half of Archive
 Metal shelves fill the hall; most are empty and many have succumbed to
 rust. The shelves that aren't empty hold broken shards of glass. The
 archive continues to the south, and an exit leads west.

>go south

 South Half of Archive
 Just enough light filters in to show you row after row of boxes
 filling rack after rack of shelves, making it difficult to find a
 place to stand. The room continues to the north. Above the west exit
 is a clock.

>go west

 South End of Hallway
 Like the foyer, the hallway is marble. Its two-story height combined
 with its thinness inspires unease. A walkway runs above you, clinging
 to the east and west walls. Below the east walkway is a doorway.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>go south

 Foyer
 The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north. On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway. The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>enter doorway
 You can't see any such thing.

>go south
 You start to take a step out the door, then pause. Somehow, the
 weather has turned from drenching rain to snow, colder than a Coke
 straight from the fridge. You shiver and retreat back to the warmth of
 the foyer.

>examine floor
 Which do you mean, the floor or the marble floor?

>marble
 The floor reflects the ceiling back. For a moment, the light shifts,
 and you think you catch a glimpse of a familiar red-and-white image;
 then the light shifts again and the pattern vanishes.

>look up
 What do you want to look up in?

 You see nothing special about the ceiling. It is entirely unlike

 A dust-covered Coke machine stands at the north end of the hall, the
 focus of attention.

 Cutting that up would achieve little.

>clean machine
 You achieve nothing by this.

 An inner voice tells you there's no Coke that way.

>pull cord
>examine clock
 Nothing obvious happens.

 A red-faced clock with white hands. Above the hands is written the
 inscription "It's always time for Coca-Cola".

 You can't see any such thing.

>take clock
 It's up high on the wall.

>get cord
 Taken.

 You would achieve nothing by this.

 Somewhat unwisely, you jab the bottle opener into the socket. Current
 flows through your body and you twitch like a trout on a hook. You
 grasp the power cable firmly and hope for the best. The Coke machine
 hums to life as you cry out with the pain. Tragically, the last words
 you hear before it all fades to black are a mechanical voice saying
 "I'm sorry, this machine is all out of that selection. Please enter 75
 cents and choose again."








 A great deal of mostly non-Coke related things occur.

 Hospital Room
 You are in the room where your father died. It is crowded with
 familiar medical equipment which clusters around a bed.

 The Pause That Refreshes.

 The array of equipment only succeeded in prolonging your father's
 agony. Tucked in amongst the equipment you notice a mini-fridge.

>open fridge
 You open the mini-fridge, revealing a can of Coke.

>take can
 Taken. (Things go better with Coke.)

>drink coke
 You take a sip of the Coke. Truly, this entire experience was worth
 it. You glance up again, and notice the prone figure of your father,
 lying there.

 He breathes in shallow gasps. His face is pale as a candle flame. The
 cancer has crept from his lungs to the rest of his body.

>examine father

>give coke to father
 You lean over and tip some of the Coke into your father's mouth. His

 -- You're a good boy, Terry."

 *** Thanks to Coca-Cola, you have resolved your latent Oedipus complex
 and gone on to a happier and more mentally and physically secure life

 At the Coca-Cola Dispenser
 Of all the places in the world to obtain the sweet goodness of
 Coca-Cola products, this has to be your favorite. The Coke machine
 dominates the landscape, resting snugly against the perfect brick wall
 next to the unbroken sidewalk, which seems to lead to untold
 possibilities, their potential unlocked by the mere presence of
 Coca-Cola.

 You can't see any such thing. Maybe you meant to refer to your Coke?

>examine machine
 This Coke machine has served you well. It is always full, always has
 exact change, always operates smoothly, and always keeps its
 assortment of Coca-Cola products chilled at exactly the right
 temperature. Right now, though, the buttons don't seem to have the
 same labels they used to. The 'Select!' light is still on, meaning you
 can push the following buttons:

 **Planetfall**
 **Hitchhiker**
 **A Bear's Night Out**

 Your surroundings melt away, and you find yourself in a completely new

 Nutrimat Room
 This room is empty except for a large machine bearing the label
 "NUTRIMAT".

 You can see a Nutrimat here.

 You are carrying:
   a can of Coca-Cola
   a dressing gown (being worn)

>examine can
 Truly, all of your desires can be assuaged with the refreshing

 The Nutrimat has a door which can be opened and a button which can be
 pressed.

 You open the door, revealing some circuitry.

>push button
 The Nutrimat produces a cup of fizzy brown liquid. "Share and enjoy!"
 it remarks.

 A simple button, nothing more.

>push button
 "I already made you a beverage," says the Nutrimat.

 substance so crisp, so refreshing, so delicious!"

 "I already made you a beverage," says the Nutrimat.

 Aaaaah! What joy! What bliss! What unbearable ecstasy of delight!

>pour cup on circuitry
 You need to be holding the cup of fizzy brown liquid before you can
 put it into something else.

>get cup

 That doesn't seem likely to be helpful.

 PFAH! This beverage is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Coke!
 You dash the cup from your lips.

 it remarks.

 AHHH! Now that's more like it! Crisp, refreshing Coca-Cola!

 Marvin the robot wanders into the room. "Oh my," he says. "Human, you
 have managed to acquire both Coke and More Coke at the same time.
 Truly a sign of intelligence. Well done."

 You yawn, stretch, and roll over blearily. Suddenly, you feel a sharp
 pain in your side! Your eyes snap open, just in time to see Floyd bend
 over to poke you again. You leap to your feet.


 Bio-Lock West
 The is the second half of the sterilization chamber leading from the
 main lab to the Bio Lab. The door to the east, leading to the Bio Lab,
 has a window. The bio lock continues to the west.

 The door to the lab, mercifully, is closed.

 Your trusty companion, Floyd the robot, bounces to his feet as well.
 "Hi!", he beams. "You sure are a sleepyhead."

>examine floyd
 From its design, Floyd the robot seems to be of the multi-purpose
 sort. It is slightly cross-eyed, and its mechanical mouth forms a
 lopsided grin.

>ask floyd about pepsi
 Floyd, clearly uncomprehending, whistles cheerily.

>ask floyd about coke
 "Irving the miniaturization-tech-person used to drink lots of
 refreshing Coca-Cola. He was so absent-minded that he added RNA memory
 engrams to all Coke in Complex, so he could remember his passwords. So
 for you to fix computer, you have to drink Coke. Coke is It."

 Floyd pauses for a moment, then glances toward the lab door. "Looks
 dangerous in there," says Floyd. "I don't think you should go inside."
 He peers in again at the Coke on the Bio Lab floor. "But without
 refreshing RNA-enhanced Coca-Cola, you won't know minibooth code to
 fix computer. Hmmm... I know! Floyd will get refreshing Coca-Cola.
 Robots are tough. Nothing can hurt robots. You open the door, then
 Floyd will rush in. Then you close door. When Floyd knocks, open door
 again. Okay? Go!" Floyd's voice trembles slightly as he waits for you
 to open the door.


>open door
 The door opens and Floyd, pausing only for the briefest moment,
 plunges into the Bio Lab. Immediately, he is set upon by hideous,
 mutated monsters! More are heading straight toward the open door!
 Floyd shrieks and yells to you to close the door.

>close door
>close door
 The door closes.
 From within the lab you hear ferocious growlings, the sounds of a
 skirmish, and then a high-pitched metallic scream!

 That's already closed.
 You hear, slightly muffled by the door, three fast knocks, followed by
 the distinctive sound of tearing metal.

 Floyd stumbles out of the Bio Lab, clutching the delicious-looking can
 of Coca-Cola. The mutations rush toward the open doorway!

 You close the Bio Lab door. And not a moment too soon! You hear a
 pounding from the door as the monsters within vent their frustration
 at losing their prey. And, of course, their Coke.

 Floyd staggers to the ground, clutching the delicious can of Coke. He
 is badly torn apart, with loose wires and broken circuits everywhere.
 Oil flows from his lubrication system. He obviously has only moments
 to live.

 You drop to your knees and cradle Floyd's head in your lap. Floyd
 looks up at his friend with half-open eyes. "Floyd did it ... got
 Coke. Floyd a good friend, huh?" Quietly, you croon Floyd's favorite
 song: "I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke".

 As you finish the last verse, Floyd smiles with contentment. His
 fingers tighten around the Coke can, and with a spine-tingling
 "Pfffft!" he opens it. With his last strength, he sets the can on the
 ground before you. His eyes close as his head rolls to the side. You
 sit in silence for a moment, in memory of a brave friend who gave his
 life so that you might have Coke. All in all, a fair trade, but
 admirable nonetheless.


>pray
 You close your eyes. You pray for a Coke. You open them again. You
 still don't have a Coke, but you feel more hopeful of getting one
 soon.

>drink coke
 Aaaaah! What joy! What bliss! You feel renewed strength and energy
 coursing through your body.

 And -- what's that? There.

 There, glimmering in the corner of your mind: the access code to the
 teleportation booth. Floyd was right.

 Now it's up to you to make his sacrifice worthwhile. Casting a final,
 sad glance at his mangled carcass, you stride off to the west...

 Bedroom (on the big bed)
 Moonlight plays through the window, softly illuminating the bedroom,
 full of comfortable memories.

 To the west is the cupboard where you usually live, and the doorway to
 the northwest leads to the rest of the house.

 David, your owner, lies next to you on the bed, in a deep sleep.

>examine david
 David is handsome, debonair, forgetful and fast asleep. He also wrote
 this description, and loves Coca-Cola (tm).

>go west
 You'll have to get off the big bed first.

 Quite the most beautiful furry brown teddy bear. And a good potential
 corporate logo to attract young children, not that the Coca-Cola
 Corporation would ever do that. Anyway, we fund dentists' groups to
 prevent this sort of accusation, buddy! So leave us alone.

>get off bed
 You tumble down, but being a soft bear, that's ok.

>go west

 Cupboard
 When you aren't lying on the bed, you usually stay in here, snug and
 safe with your friends atop the warm pile of clothes.

 The cupboard opens eastward to the bedroom.

 On the pile of clothes you can see a can of Coca-Cola (tm) and a hand
 drawn sign.

 Your warm winter Coca-Cola jacket is here, which may be just as well,
 it's a little chilly.

 A big bed fills up most of the room.

 David lies on the bed, very much asleep.

>look under bed
 Unfortunately, you find no more Coke.

>go northwest
 There's no need to explore tonight- Coca-Cola (tm) will take care of

 David continues to sleep, totally oblivious.

>climb bed
 You struggle, but clamber up successfully.

>search david
>hit david with can
 You find nothing as interesting as your Coke.

 The refreshing, ice cold can gently touches David on the nose.
 Instantly he awakes, and grabs the can.

 `Wow, a refreshing ice cold Coke (tm)!'

 David opens the can, pausing for a moment to savour the cool air from
 within, then raises the can to his lips. The first sip is smooth, yet
 effervescent with the familiar thirst quenching taste of Coca-Cola.

 David looks down at you.

 `Oh no! The Teddy Bear Picnic! Do we have enough Coke (tm)?'

 He races from the room, with the ice-cold can of Coke (tm).

 You can't see any such thing.


 Bedroom (on the big bed)
 Moonlight plays through the window, softly illuminating the bedroom,
 full of comfortable memories.

 To the west is the cupboard where you usually live, and the doorway to
 the northwest leads to the rest of the house.

 You hear David happily gulping Coke (tm) and riffing through papers.

 `Aha! I knew this card was somewhere.'

>go down
 You tumble down, but being a soft bear, that's ok.

 You hear David pulling several 12-packs of refreshing Coca-Cola (tm)
 from a high cupboard somewhere in the kitchen.

 `Aha! A free Coca-Cola (tm) trading stamp!'

>go northeast
 You can't go that way.

 You hear the creaking of a picnic basket under strain as David pushes
 in several 12-packs of refreshing Coke (tm).

 There's no need to explore tonight- Coca-Cola (tm) will take care of
 everything!

 David rushes back into the room.

 `There, all ready for the picnic. Thanks to my teddy bear, and the
 things-go-better flavour of an ice cold Coca-Cola (tm)!'

 You go to sleep, David lies awake for the rest of the night, and you
 have a wonderful picnic the next day, with Coke (tm) enough for all!

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You're on the run. You've got a million errands to do -- your
 apartment to get cleaned up, the fish to feed, lingerie to buy,
 Britney's shuttle to meet--

 The fish. God damn. You almost forgot. And it's in the studio, halfway
 across town from anywhere else you have to do. Oh well, you'll just
 zip over, take care of it, and hop back on the El. This'll be over in
 no time.

 Don't you just hate days where you wake up the wrong color?


 A Day for Fresh Sushi
 Copyright Emily Short 2001.
 Release 1 / Serial number 010416 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/10

 Studio
 This is Britney's studio. You haven't been around here for a while,
 because of how busy you've been with work, and she's made a few
 changes -- the aquarium in the corner, for instance. But it still
 brings back a certain emotional sweetness from the days when you had
 just met for the first time... when you used to spend hours on the
 sofa...

 You shake your head. No time for fantasy. Must feed fish.

 A huge cabinet, in the guise of an armoire, stands between the
 windows.

 On the easel is a painting.

 On the table is a vase (which is empty).

 In one corner of the room, a large aquarium bubbles in menacing
 fashion.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

 The evil fish begins to butt his pointy nose against the glass walls
 of the tank.

>examine aquarium
 A very roomy aquarium, large enough to hold quite a variety of
 colorful sealife -- if any yet survived.

 The evil fish is floating belly up!

 ...oh, damn. He was toying with you. As soon as he sees you looking,
 he goes back to swimming around.

 Even if you had had no prior experience with him, you would be able to
 see at a glance that this is an evil fish. From his sharkish nose to
 his razor fins, every inch of his compact body exudes hatred and
 danger.

 The fish glares at you, as though to underline this point.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a telegram
   a chef hat (being worn)
   a lingerie bag
   a bouquet of flowers

 The evil fish darts to the bottom of the tank and moves the gravel
 around with his nose.

>read telegram
 A telegram, apparently. And dated three days ago.

 TRIUMPH OURS STOP BACK SOON STOP BE SURE TO FEED FISH STOP

 "So," blubs the evil fish. "How about it? Little food over here?"

 "Hey, nice SKIN TONE," shouts the evil fish. His words reach you in a
 spitting gurgle of aquarium water. "You gone over to a pure eggplant
 diet these days?"

>examine flowers
 Okay, so it's silly and sentimental and no doubt a waste of money, of
 which there is never really enough, but: you miss her. You've missed
 her since ten seconds after she stepped aboard the shuttle to Luna
 Prime, and when you saw these -- her favorites, pure golden tulips
 like springtime -- you had to have them.

 "Oh, you shouldn't have," says the fish. "For me??"

 You just respond with a livid glare.

 The evil fish is swimming around the tank in lazy circles.

>put flowers in vase
 You settle the flowers into the vase and arrange them so that they
 look sprightly.

 "Oooh," says the fish. "No one ever changes the plant life in HERE.
 It's the same damn seaw--"

 "Cut me a break and cork it," you reply tartly.

 "There ya go," says the fish. "The girl is getting WARMER."

 You open the cabinet, revealing some paints and a heap of cloth.

 Various colors of drapery that Britney uses to set up backgrounds and
 clothe her models. She does a lot of portraiture, so this comes in
 handy. It's all a big messy wad at the moment. Organized is not her
 middle name.

 "Whatcha looking at? I can't see through the doors, you know."

 Poking around the cloths reveals -- ha HA! -- a vehemently orange can
 of fish food.

 You already have that.

 "Oh, for--!" The evil fish breaks out in exasperation and hives.
 "Screw the screwing around with the screwtop. SHE never has to do
 that."

 "Well, SHE is not here," you reply. "What do you suggest?"

 at you with his fin. "Simplicity. Try it."

 Triumphantly, you dump the remaining contents of the canister of fish
 food into the tank. It floats on the surface like scum, but the fish
 for once stops jawing and starts eating. Like a normal fish. Blub,
 blub.

>examine fish
   *** TWO HOURS LATER ***

 "So," Britney says, tucking a strand of hair behind your ear, "where
 shall we go for dinner? Since I made the big bucks on this trip, it's
 my treat. Anywhere you like."

 "I've had a hankering all day," you admit, as the two of you turn from
 the shuttle platform and head toward the bank of taxis. "I could
 really go for some sashimi right now."


     *** You have won ***

 tadsr - A text-only TADS 2.5.10 Interpreter.
 Copyright (c) 1993, 2006 by Michael J. Roberts.

 That wacky Neil deMause!  What will he think of next?  Why, the last
 time you tried to visit him, you got stuck on Ellis Island for hours,
 and ended up years in the past talking to a goat.  Boy, you were
 really "Lost in New York" that time (heh heh).  And history seems to
 have repeated itself, because here it is Halloween, and here you are,
 wandering through the streets in the fog, looking for his apartment
 again.  Sheesh.

 Kids, don't eat your Halloween candy without having your parents
 inspect it first because there are SICKOS out there who will put RAZOR
 BLADES in it and you will CUT YOUR MOUTH and GET A POISONED INFECTION
 and DIE, all from eating your candy early.  So don't do that.: A TADS
 Adventure by Dan Shiovitz and his amazing programmable monkey
 Developed with TADS, the Text Adventure Development System.

 Someplace in New York
    It's a good thing it's too foggy to make out any details, because
 I've spent all of three hours in New York, and they were all at the
 airport waiting to switch flights.  Still, you can make out a street
 going north (how did you get into this dead end, anyway?)
    A jack-o-lantern sits in the middle of the street to the north.

>get jack-o-lantern
 You take a step or two towards the pumpkin.  A sudden gust of wind
 makes the fog swirl, obscuring it for a moment despite the candle's
 glow, and then it's gone.  Huh.  Weeeyurd.

>examine jack-o-lantern
 I don't see any jack-o-lantern here.

>examine jackolantern
 I don't know the word "jackolantern".

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

 Someplace in New York
    It's a good thing it's too foggy to make out any details, because
 I've spent all of three hours in New York, and they were all at the
 airport waiting to switch flights.  Still, you can make out a street
 going north (how did you get into this dead end, anyway?)

>go north
 You walk forward into the fog.
 Someplace Else in New York
    You're still lost, but at least you know you aren't where you were
 before.  So you must be, erm, someplace else.  The street bends, so
 you can go either east or south.

 In a total of 3 turns, you have achieved a score of 1 points out of a
 possible 5, which gives you a rank of pie:  it's the flesh of the
 pumpkin

 I don't know the word "xyzzy".

>go east
 You pause for a moment as you start to walk again.  Did you ..  hear
 something? Nah.  Couldn't be.
 A Third Place in New York
    Steadily narrowing down the options, you plan on having the whole
 of New York mapped any time now.  *Including* the secret passage from
 the Kitchen to the Library.  Streets lead west and north.

>go north
 Again, you pause.  There's definitely something out there.  Something
 nasty.  Something big.  Something orange.
 A Fourth Room in New York
    Someplace else.  Someplace foggy.  Someplace sinister.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

 "Ha!"  you reassure yourself "There's nothing out there!  And if there
 were, it would never leap onto my back suddenly and clasp its slimy
 hands around my throat and slowly squeeze until all my life was
 crushed out.  It'd just rip my chest open and feast on my entrails."

>examine orange thing in the fog
 I don't know the word "orange".

>examine thing
 I don't know the word "thing".

>examine pumpkin
>examine something
 I don't see any pumpkin here.

 I don't know the word "something".

>examine fog
 I don't know the word "fog".

>go east
 This seems to be the end of the line.  Your last stand.  The final
 battle.  No wait out but dead man's boots.

 (Dramatic pause).

>wait
 Time passes...

 EEEAGH!  FLYING DEMONIC PUMPKIN HEAD!!!

 When the horror finally ends, you're someplace else.
 Someplace else in New York
    Another time ..  another place.  Or is it?  One moment seems to
 blend into another, one stretch of pavement becomes the same as any
 other.  It's tough being a hard-boiled detective, tossed off the
 police force because you knew too much about the kickbacks being paid
 to the guys up top.  Yeah, it's tough, on your own, in-debt and
 half-drunk to forget the pain of a broken heart.  So it's a good thing
 you're not one.  You're just J Random Protagonist, remember?  Now go
 find neild's house.  I think it's north of here.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>who am i
 I don't know the word "who".

>go north
 No, wait, I guess it's west of here.  (Take *that*, fourth wall!)

>go west
 You walk west, and find yourself on the doorstep of Neil's house.
 Your quest is over!  ...  or is it??
 Outside Neil deMause's House
    For ease of narration, his apartment got turned into a house
 sometime.  Or maybe you went inside and are standing outside the door
 to his room.  Whatever.
    You see a door here.

>knock
 (the door)
 You knock three times:
 bang!
    bang!
        bang!
 The door sloooowly creeeeeeaks opeeeeeen....
>look

 It's yor frend!

 neild invites you inside and gives you cookies.

 Inside Neil deMause's House/Apartment
    Depending on which path you took to get here, this is either Neil
 deMause's House or his Apartment.
    Neil deMause is here.  Yaaay!

 I beg your pardon?

>eat neil
 The Neil deMause doesn't appear appetizing.

 You have a cookies.

 In a total of 14 turns, you have achieved a score of 3 points out of a
 possible 5, which gives you a rank of senor sausageface

>ask neil about pumpkin
 "I don't know much about that.  So let me tell you about baseball
 instead."  (hehehehehe see, he likes baseball hehehehe)There is a
 sudden knocking at the door.
 "Oh no!"  says neild, "It's the pumpkinhead!  Lets hide!"  Neil hides
 in the kitchen.  You hide in the closet.

 Closet
    This is the closet.  It has stuff in it.  There is a wall.  And
 another wall.  Also there is a coatrack.

>eat cookies
 The cookies slide down your throat and you quickly are full.  Also,
 "wooden wood".  Ha!

>enroll to get pepsipoints
 I don't know the word "enroll".

>examine stuff
 I don't know the word "stuff".

>examine coatrack
 it's made out of wood.  and varnished.  and nailed to the wall.  and

 Pulling the coatrack doesn't have any effect.

 You are empty-handed.

>turn coatrack
 Turning the coatrack doesn't have any effect.

>examine neil demause

>wait

 Turning the coatrack doesn't have any effect.

 Closet
    This is the closet.  It has stuff in it.  There is a wall.  And
 another wall.  Also there is a coatrack.

>push wall
 You push the wall and it opens up!  There is a secret passage that you
 go in and neild is waiting on the other side.  "Yay!"  he says.  "Lets
 go to Seattle because it is the west coast IF mecca" you say.  "OK" he
 says.

 THE END

 It's taken you years to work your way up from Ketchup Packet Sorter
 Third Class to your current post:  Bad Beef Courier.  It's been hard
 work, and it's taken its toll on you, but it's all been worth it.
 With your new clearance, you can finally bring down Mr. McBeefy's vast
 animal-exploiting empire and set things right.

 They said that the Beef Flu was an urban legend, but it's been eating
 away at you for twenty years.  You must hurry: your can tell you
 haven't much time left.

 FREEDOM FOR OUR BOVINE BRETHREN!

 MEAT IS MURDER!

 Mr. McBeefy's Beef Imporium
 The Beef Imporium -- MBI, to you wage slaves -- stands at the very
 base of the Tower of Beef.  The vast glass ceiling lets you look up
 into the Tower and see the vast machinery of Mr. McBeefy's Vertical
 Beef Processing Facility at work.  Cows and carcasses swing by at all
 elevations, ready to be processed from happy heifers into happy meals.
 Now and then an organ or spurt of blood falls onto the glass ceiling,
 but it's always quickly cleaned up by one of the janitors.  Those
 lucky bastards get off with the easy work.

 The supply room lies to the east, and a sliding door leads out.

 Like most days, the place is full of kids.  There are two field-trips
 here, at the moment.

 Included with your The Tower of Beef packaging you should find a .010"
 hypodermic syringe and a 50cc vial containing an infection-guaranteed
 quantity of a randomly chosen fatal disease.  Injection no more than
 six and no less than three days (for gestation) is recommended for the
 optimal experience.  Upon completion, you will be issued a claim code
 for an antidote.  Please contact Tower of Beef Limited with this code
 to receive your antidote.  (2.95 USD per minute, please allow six to
 eight weeks for delivery.)

 Adam Biltcliffe: I love the way the NPCs relentlessly criticise
 everything the player does.
  -- Adam Biltcliffe

 The throbbing is unmistakable!
  -- D. Jacob Wildstrom

 This game leaps forward in time to show the player the effects of a
 key early decision.  My reaction was a Keanu-like 'whoa.'
  -- Peter Berman

 I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH!  IT GAVE ME SARS!
  -- Tablesaw

 The completed game map formed an interesting shape, which was a nice
 touch.
  -- Caleb

 In most games, instant death puzzles are a flaw.  This game cries out
 for an instant death puzzle to put it out of its misery.
  -- Sam Kabo Ashwell

 It will make you run right out and steal little packets of ketchup and
 do crazy things.
  -- David Cornelson


 The author gave a fresh perspective to normal day-to-day objects; how
 they could be used, what they really are. It made me look around my
 surroundings a bit more carefully.
  -- Duchess

 The game appeared mostly vertical - i.e., almost all room-to-room
 movement was via up and down, with  little use of the compass
 directions.

 and beef accessories.  MBI is back to the west.

 It's a pile of ground chuck laid out on a table, probably for use in

 Lardonnaise).

 Upon close inspection, you realize this is bad beef -- a perfect

 East-West Passage
 Huge glass walkways lead east and west.  Carts full of beef and bones
 are everywhere, blocking the way.  Stairwells lead up and down.

 A sign hangs on the wall here.

>examine sign
 The sign is painted with two big arrows.  One points east and reads:
 THIS WAY TO THE DISPOSATORIUM.  The other points west and reads: THIS
 WAY TO BEEFBURGER PREPARATION.

>go east

 The Disposatorium
 Rows and rows of carts run through the Disposatorium, hauling bad beef
 to be processed into feed.  Other couriers rush in and out, as if
 their lives depended on it.  The manager's office is upstairs; the
 rumor is that he loves the smell of bad beef.

 Couriers rush in and out.

>give beef to courier
 You can only do that to something animate.

>go up

 Management Office
 This small office serves as a refuge for Branch Manager Fat. There's a
 desk and some computers and paperwork.  It's all quite uninteresting.
 You press your hand to your head, and you can feel the vein in your

 Grinder Room
 You're standing on a precarious walkway above a gigantic meat grinder,
 where the fresh whole beef is converted into chuck. Overhead, sides of
 beef swing down from the infinite expanse above and drop into the
 grinder, which happily consumes them and drops them to the processing
 floor at the bottom of the stairwell

 Peters, the day-shift inspector, is here.

>examine peters
 Peters is a weaselly little shit in a lab coat.  Every time he sees
 you with bad beef up here, he gives you a filthy look, as if you
 contaminated it yourself.  (If only he knew.)
>show chuck to peters
 Peters glowers at you.  "Get back to work, Courier."

>give chuck to peters
 Peters doesn't seem interested.

>go down
 Peters stops you.  "No unauthorized personnel!"

>push peters
 That would be less than courteous.  Hahahaha!

>kill peters
 Oh, you'd love to, but it would probably spoil the rest of your plans
 for the day.

>feed chuck to peters
 Peters doesn't seem interested.
 By now, you've broken out in a cold sweat, and you feel feverish.
 With every breath, your lungs THROB.

>examine beef
 Beef, beef, everywhere, but not a drop to drink!

>examine chuck
 It's a pile of bad beef.  Nice and toxic, this, and probably rife with
 botulism.  No Beef Flu, though.  You'd be able to smell it.  Your
 veins THROB at the thought.

 Upon close inspection, you realize this is bad beef -- a perfect

 Decontamination Room
 While they call this the decontamination room, nothing actually gets
 done to decontaminate anything.  Basically, there's a locked door
 between here and the Breeding Room, and they only give the key to
 people who won't contaminate the studs.  Apparently, this satisfies
 the ISO requirements.  Stairs lead down and the Breeding Room door is
 to the west.

>examine door
 It's a pretty solid door.

>squirt syringe through keyhole

 What do you want to unlock the breeding room door with?

 You can't see any such thing.

 You are carrying:

   a syringe
 Yours muscles ache with every step you take.  The Beef Flu has you in
 its clutches.  (Make that THROB, ok?  Your muscles THROB.  It sounds
 more DRAMATIC.)

 You can't, since the breeding room door is in the way.

 The Tower of Beef is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives
 long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>look

 Supply Room
 The MBI supply room is just a little pantry, well-stocked with beef
 and beef accessories.  MBI is back to the west.

>examine accessories
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>go west

 Mr. McBeefy's Beef Imporium
 The Beef Imporium -- MBI, to you wage slaves -- stands at the very
 base of the Tower of Beef.  The vast glass ceiling lets you look up
 into the Tower and see the vast machinery of Mr. McBeefy's Vertical
 Beef Processing Facility at work.  Cows and carcasses swing by at all
 elevations, ready to be processed from happy heifers into happy meals.
 Now and then an organ or spurt of blood falls onto the glass ceiling,
 but it's always quickly cleaned up by one of the janitors.  Those
 lucky bastards get off with the easy work.

 The supply room lies to the east, and a sliding door leads out.

 Like most days, the place is full of kids.  There are two field-trips
 here, at the moment.

>go up

 East-West Passage
 Huge glass walkways lead east and west.  Carts full of beef and bones
 are everywhere, blocking the way.  Stairwells lead up and down.

 A sign hangs on the wall here.

>go east

 The Disposatorium
 Rows and rows of carts run through the Disposatorium, hauling bad beef
 to be processed into feed.  Other couriers rush in and out, as if
 their lives depended on it.  The manager's office is upstairs; the
 rumor is that he loves the smell of bad beef.

 Management Office
 This small office serves as a refuge for Branch Manager Fat. There's a
 desk and some computers and paperwork.  It's all quite uninteresting.

 Dropped.

 Grinder Room
 You're standing on a precarious walkway above a gigantic meat grinder,
 where the fresh whole beef is converted into chuck. Overhead, sides of
 beef swing down from the infinite expanse above and drop into the
 grinder, which happily consumes them and drops them to the processing
 floor at the bottom of the stairwell

 Peters, the day-shift inspector, is here.

 You find nothing of interest.

 That would be less than courteous.  Hahahaha!

 It's taken you years to work your way up from Ketchup Packet Sorter
 Third Class to your current post:  Bad Beef Courier.  It's been hard
 work, and it's taken its toll on you, but it's all been worth it.
 With your new clearance, you can finally bring down Mr. McBeefy's vast
 animal-exploiting empire and set things right.

 They said that the Beef Flu was an urban legend, but it's been eating
 away at you for twenty years.  You must hurry: your can tell you
 haven't much time left.

 FREEDOM FOR OUR BOVINE BRETHREN!

 MEAT IS MURDER!

 Chicks really dig how "sensitive" your activism makes you seem.

 The Beef Imporium -- MBI, to you wage slaves -- stands at the very

 Some ground chuck sits on a sheaf of paper on a counter.

>get chuck
 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

 It's a pile of ground chuck laid out on a table, probably for use in
 McBeefy Beef Tacobeef Mexiburgers (with extra Spic Sauce and
 Lardonnaise).

 Upon close inspection, you realize this is bad beef -- a perfect
 excuse to head up to the Disposatorium.

>eat chuck
 That's plainly inedible.

>examine syringe
 It's a syringe of your blood.  It should be just swarming with the
 Beef Flu.  Hopefully, you can get close enough to Big Buck to put it
 to use.
 You feel your heart THROBBING in your chest.  You're definitely
 getting sicker.

 where the fresh whole beef is converted into chuck. Overhead, sides of
 beef swing down from the infinite expanse above and drop into the
 grinder, which happily consumes them and drops them to the processing
 floor at the bottom of the stairwell

 Peters, the day-shift inspector, is here.

>throw chuck at grinder
 Peters cries out in horror as you throw the bad chuck into the grinder
 and rushes over to the edge of the catwalk, peering into the grinder.
 You heave the bad beef into the grinder, and it happily mixes in with
 the rest, pouring down into production.  That should do nicely.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>push peters
 You give Peters a healthy shove and he falls into the grinder and is
 processed down through it.
 A wave of nausea hits you.  Your intestines THROB.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>go down

 Beef Processing
 The beef comes down through the meatgrinder, a flight above you, and
 falls onto the conveyer belt in front of you.  It's been stopped for a
 while, so there's quite a pile built up.  The steel stairway leads
 back up to the grinder's top.

>search pile
 You run your hands through the pile of meat, oblivious to the waves of
 nausea running through you.  You're rewarded with a shiny (well, not
 really) key, engraved with an unfamiliar, phallic icon.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine key
 The key is pretty normal looking, except for the phallus carved into
 its head.  Presumably that indicates its use.

 You press your hand to your head, and you can feel the vein in your
 forehead THROBBING as you clench your teeth.

 Decontamination Room
 While they call this the decontamination room, nothing actually gets
 done to decontaminate anything.  Basically, there's a locked door
 between here and the Breeding Room, and they only give the key to
 people who won't contaminate the studs.  Apparently, this satisfies
 the ISO requirements.  Stairs lead down and the Breeding Room door is
 to the west.

>unlock door with key
 You unlock the breeding room door.

>open dor
 You can't see any such thing.

>open door
 You open the breeding room door.

>go west

 Breeding Room
 The Breeding Room is the cleanest room you've seen in the Tower. It's
 a large, dome-shaped room with a dirt and grass floor.  One wall is an
 exterior wall, and is made of one-way glass.  You can see the skyline
 outside, as well as the sun.

 You can see a Big Buck here.

 You can't see any such thing.

>inject buck with syringe
 You casually walk over and inject the Beef Flu into Big Buck.  He
 doesn't seem to notice, and just grunts a bit. You laugh to yourself
 as you realize how easy it's been. Now, you can go home and die in the
 knowledge that you've saved the world.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>score
 You have so far scored 30 out of a possible 35, in 21 turns.

 East-West Passage

 A sign hangs on the wall here.

 Mr. McBeefy's Beef Imporium

 Like most days, the place is full of kids.  There are two field-trips
 here, at the moment.

 You step out into the warm, sunshiny day.  Here and there, co-workers
 sit and eat packed lunches, discussing their days. Children frolic and
 birds sing.  What a perfect day!

 You lean back against The Tower and contemplate your success,
 imagining the future of the world:

 Fifty or seventy-five years from now, billions are dead from the
 mutated Beef Flu.  Death from Super McBeefy is slow, throbbing, and
 painful -- as you well know -- and society has fallen apart trying
 merely to bury the dead and sustain the living.  With the economy in
 shambles and the majority of the fabric of society in tatters, the
 human race is reduced to foraging: foraging for nuts and berries, and
 not beef.

 You are a hero!


     *** You have won ***


 In that game you scored 35 out of a possible 35, in 25 turns.
