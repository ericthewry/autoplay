 You shouldn't be sitting in the driver's seat. You should be getting
 out on the passenger side, and there should be someone else sitting at
 the wheel, key in the ignition, keeping an eye out.

 And that's probably how this would be going down, if you had any
 friends left.

 Yes. Take a minute to reflect on the choices you've made.

>wait
 No. Don't do that. You need to be prepared mentally. You need to be one
 hundred percent involved in what you are about to do. You and yourself
 are all you need to come out of this smelling like a rose.

 You, yourself, and maybe that sweet little slab of steel in your
 pocket, that two-and-a-half-pound insurance policy, that cold, hard...

 Do not waste time being poetic about your gun. Get out of the car.

 No. Get moving now, before you chicken out.

 Wait, no. Sit still and figure out when and how you should get out of

 Inside your car
 Technically, you don't own this car; the bank does. And it'll be
 asserting its ownership pretty aggressively if you don't start coughing
 up some cash pretty quick.

 Aside from the usual accomodations, the interior of this automobile
 boasts numerous empty pop cans, a tall and disorganized stack of
 documents and a variety of stains--to say nothing of the wonders to be
 found in the back seat.

>examine gun
 enough to scare anybody it's pointed at, this is a kind of gun with a
 specific name--a brand name, like cars have. It also has a "caliber,"
 which is a number that refers to what kind of bullets you can put in
 it, but you can't remember that either.

 The important details are easy enough: You point it like this, you put
 your index finger in here, and when you squeeze the trigger it goes
 boom, assuming the gun is loaded. One other important thing to keep in
 mind is that the gun is not loaded.

 Sorry I couldn't be here to play with you guys today. I just found out
 that today, right now, is when my church is putting up decorations for
 Christmas, and this I cannot miss out on!

 I hope you are enjoying Taco Fiction and I look forward to reading the

 La Pizzá Parking Lot
 As you exit the car, the humidity slaps you in the face.

 This parking lot is reserved solely for La Pizzá customers, as the sign
 over there clearly states. La Pizzá is across the street west of here,
 but of course by this time of night it's locked up tight. Paco's Tacos,
 on the other hand, is open late, and it's a hole in the ground with
 zero security.

 A low-slung iron chain separates this section of the lot from the one
 reserved for patrons of Paco's, which is further east.

 Your piece of junk Ford Focus is parked here.

>open trunk

 You've been meaning to give it back.

 lot in half. Around the middle, the chain is only a few inches off the
 ground, and people probably trip on it all the time.

>open trunk
 baby stroller. It's a long story.

 You've been meaning to give it back.

>trip over chain

>go east
 Paco's Tacos Parking Lot
 The single streetlight shared by the two parking lots casts most of its
 light on the La Pizza side, so while you can barely see your own feet,
 your car back on the west side is cast in a harsh orange glow. Paco's
 is on the other side of the alley east of here.

 This side of the lot has its own informative sign.

 A bleary-eyed guy unfamiliar to you is walking this way from across the
 alley. Well, he's trying to walk, anyway.

>examine sign

 way. "Hey, friend! What do you need, do you need anything?"

 [1] "Were you just at Paco's Tacos?"
 [2] "Lovely weather we're having."
 [3] "So, what's your name?"
 [4] "Spare some change?"
 [5] Point your gun at him.

 "Sure thing, friend. Sure thing." He pushes a few coins into your palm.
 "Just, get off my back about money, okay?"

 [Your funds have increased by 80¢.]

 [1] "Were you just at Paco's Tacos?"
 [2] "Lovely weather we're having."

 [4] "Well, goodbye."

 put it where your friend can see it. No point worrying about what to
 say: no words are necessary.

 Upon realizing what it is he's staring down the barrel of, the young
 man begins shrieking hoarsely and fumbling around in his pockets. As
 soon as he's figured out where his wallet is, he throws it at your
 feet. And now he's off like a feral cat, down the street and out of
 sight.

 There's something shaking inside your head.

>examine wallet
 It's shaking up and down so fast there must be someone operating a
 jackhammer in there, and deep in your throat you detect that you're
 about to be sick. You can control yourself, though; you push it down,
 for as long as you can hold your breath, which presently you realize
 you've been holding all this time, since just before you reached in
 your pocket, and so instead of vomiting you stand there and heave hot
 air, in and out, until you feel steady again. Apparently this is what
 it feels like, mugging somebody.

 quarter now.

 [Your funds have increased by $3.25.]

 That wasn't so bad, though! Nobody got hurt, and by tomorrow morning he
 probably won't even remember. If anything, he'll have learned a
 valuable lesson about walking home alone. Anyway, he probably won't--he
 definitely won't, there's no way he would, he absolutely will not
 report anything to the police. That won't happen.

 Besides, it's not technically armed robbery if the gun's not loaded,
 right?

 Alley
 The bricks in this alley are so old that at the middle of the road they
 have sunk a full foot below the level of their neighbors closer to the
 building walls. Walking across this uneven half-pipe of bricks is an
 unnerving and probably dangerous experience.

 The alley continues north, past a staple-encrusted utility pole, until
 the beams of the streetlamps don't quite reach; west is the parking lot
 and east is Paco's Taco's.

 Taped to the utility pole is a crumpled piece of paper, fluttering in
 the breeze.

 looks like something has been written on the back.

 However, removing the paper has revealed something painted on the

 the pole. One of the metal plates has something red spraypainted on it.

 As you tilt your head you detect the glimmer of a dime in the space
 between two bricks. You try your best to look graceful and casual as
 you stoop, then kneel, then get on your hands and knees to pick it up.

>go east
 Outside Paco's Tacos
 Here's the entrance to Paco's Tacos, everyone's favorite place for a
 bite as long as everything else is closed. The stretch of sidewalk here
 is covered by a striped awning for the masses to huddle under while
 waiting for a table at peak hours. The door to the north is framed by
 neon signs behind plate glass windows. Further east, there's some sort
 of ice cream place.

 Now is a good time to go over the plan before you pull the job. It'd be
 nice if you had everything written down as a reminder, but a note like
 that could end up being incriminating. So, mentally, as you're standing
 here in front of the taco shop, remember:

 Once you're inside, you're going to go north across the dining room, to
 where the counter is. Then you're going to point the gun at the cashier
 and, without hesitating, tell the cashier to open the cash register.
 When that's done, tell the cashier to take the money from the register
 and tell the cashier to give the money to you. (But don't say "to you",
 say "to me".) Finally, while still pointing the gun at the cashier,
 walk backward to the entrance. Once you're back outside, you just have
 to get to your car and drive away.

 Nobody will get hurt, nobody will recognize you, and best of all,
 nobody will get evicted.

 Outside Get Your Licks
 From this end of the street you can almost see the respectable part of
 town, way over to the east.

 The name of this establishment, according to the vinyl banner in the
 window, is "Get Your Licks." The sign in the door to the north says
 it's open, but in spite of the heat you can see no customers inside.

>examine sign

>go north
 Inside Get Your Licks
 Blissfully you step into the open arms of air conditioning.

 Is this really just an ice cream place? It looks more like a mountain
 cottage, with lace curtains in the windows, and a low table with a
 built-in checkerboard next to the little fake fireplace. The walls are
 done up with floral wallpaper and littered with newspaper clippings.

 You'd probably take it for a coffeeshop if the counter didn't include a
 big glass window displaying numerous tubs of ice cream.

 A number of cheap wire coat hangers hang from a hastily-installed coat
 rack.

 A dark-haired cashier sits behind the counter.

>examine curtains

 standing around and howling at you from across the snow.

 just makes her arms look long.

 She's wearing an apron; she has a tattoo on her left shoulder. She also
 has a lot of hair, which must be a nightmare in this humidity.

 She produces a tiny plastic spoon. "What would you like to try?"

 "I would be happy, to, let you do that," she stumbles. She scoops up a
 tiny spoonful and offers it to you.

 "Absolutely." She scoops a tiny amount of ice cream onto the little
 spoon, and then she hands it to you.

 Oh, wow. "Vanilla" doesn't mean "plain." This has a flavor.

 "refresh" the things to ask about.]

 "Oh, it's a slice of pie." She lifts up her sleeve so you can see the
 ink in its entirety: It does indeed depict a slice of pie. The white
 curve at the bottom is the plate it's sitting on.

 "It's cherry pie; it's my favorite."

 And now you know!

 Her eyes widen. "Yes. I do." You'd better think of something good! [You
 can try this option again if you find any more weird things in the
 future.]

 [9] "Have you seen this graffiti of a bird?"
 [10] "What's your name?"
 [11] "I should get going."

>9

 "Oh, you mean the one with the beak?" She makes a sweeping,
 downward-curving gesture in front of her nose. "Yeah, I've seen that
 thing all over town. I think it's supposed to be an ibis."

 What's an ibis?

 [1] "What's an ibis?"

 "Um, it's a bird, with a curvy beak and a long neck. I don't know much

 [8] "You wanna hear something weird?"
 [9] "I should get going."

 "Of course you can." She rolls up a fairly generous spoonful onto the
 little spoon, which she then hands to you.

 Hey, this is bitter. Do you like bitter?

 [1] "I would actually love to taste something&"
 [2] "I know what kind of ice cream I want."

 [5] "Can I taste the salted caramel?"
 [6] "Would you mind my asking&"
 [7] "You wanna hear something weird?"
 [8] "I should get going."

 "Certainly." She scoops up a little bit of pink ice cream and hands you
 the spoon.

 It's a lot more mellow than you expected.

 [6] "You wanna hear something weird?"
 [7] "I should get going."

>4

 "Oh, please do. I just put it together, and I really want to know what
 you think of it." She picks at the stuff with her tiny spoon and
 produces a sample for your adjudication. You put it in your mouth.

 You are unable to conceal your reaction.

 She frowns. "Too much salt, huh?"

 [1] "I would actually love to taste something&"
 [2] "I know what kind of ice cream I want."
 [3] "Can I taste the key lime?"
 [4] "Would you mind my asking&"
 [5] "You wanna hear something weird?"
 [6] "I should get going."

 "Yes you may." She spoons a tiny amount of ice cream onto her spoon and
 then she hands it to you. "Careful, it's intense."

 Geez! She wasn't kidding.

 "They're all stories about my family's dairy farm. All this ice cream

 "Oh, sure!"

 She trots with you over to the low wooden table and you each take a
 seat. The checkers are divided by color and then arranged in the
 appropriate configuration. Then the game begins.

 You are not a master of the art; you do not normally take a lot of time
 considering each and every possible move. But your opponent is so
 cautious and deliberate that you feel like you have to slow down, if
 only to be polite.

 Her eyes are narrowed, but she's smiling, and you can tell she relishes
 the opportunity to take something like this way too seriously.

>look
 Presently you realize the board is a mess. It's absurd that the game
 should be this close when it's this far along. There must be some
 release to the tension, some sort of button you can press to bring the
 whole thing crashing down.

 And then suddenly your eyes refocus and your mind is completely clear.
 You see it. You have never had an epiphany in your life, but you are
 having one now. You can make a dumb-looking move now that will force
 her into a position where you'll be able to jump every single one of
 her pieces, and can she do anything to stop it?

>look
 No. She definitely can't. It's not just a great move you've found, it's
 a foolproof gambit. You glance up at her and try to read her
 expression.

 As far as you can tell, she doesn't see it.

 So now the question is, do you take the move? Do you make the
 stupid-looking move and destroy her, or do you make the smart-looking
 move and let her win?

 Say "yes" if you're going to let her win.

>no
 You take the move that seems like an idiotic move. She looks at you
 quizzically.

 Then she jumps every single one of your pieces. How did she do that?

 Oh, you missed the& That one. There. You didn't see that one.

 "You didn't have to let me win," she says, smiling. "But thanks a lot
 anyway. I needed something to cheer me up."

 You'd probably take it for a coffeeshop if the counter didn't include a
 big glass window displaying numerous tubs of ice cream.

 Zuleika notices you noticing her and smiles.

 [1] "I would actually love to taste something&"
 [2] "I know what kind of ice cream I want."
 [3] "Would you mind my asking&"
 [4] "You wanna hear something weird?"
 [5] "What's your tattoo of?"
 [6] "What are all these newspaper clippings?"
 [7] "Do you wanna play checkers?"
 [8] "I should get going."

 "Oh, sure!"

 She trots with you over to the low wooden table and you each take a
 seat. The checkers are divided by color and then arranged in the
 appropriate configuration. Then the game begins.

 You are not a master of the art; you do not normally take a lot of time
 considering each and every possible move. But your opponent is so
 cautious and deliberate that you feel like you have to slow down, if
 only to be polite.

 Her eyes are narrowed, but she's smiling, and you can tell she relishes
 the opportunity to take something like this way too seriously.

 Presently you realize the board is a mess. It's absurd that the game
 should be this close when it's this far along. There must be some
 release to the tension, some sort of button you can press to bring the
 whole thing crashing down.

 And then suddenly your eyes refocus and your mind is completely clear.
 You see it. You have never had an epiphany in your life, but you are
 having one now. You can make a dumb-looking move now that will force
 her into a position where you'll be able to jump every single one of
 her pieces, and can she do anything to stop it?

 No. She definitely can't. It's not just a great move you've found, it's
 a foolproof gambit. You glance up at her and try to read her
 expression.

 As far as you can tell, she doesn't see it.

 So now the question is, do you take the move? Do you make the
 stupid-looking move and destroy her, or do you make the smart-looking
 move and let her win?

 Say "yes" if you're going to let her win.

>yes
 You take the obvious, smart-looking move. She jumps half of your
 remaining pieces, leaving you with a single suicidal "choice," which
 you are of course forced to take, allowing her to clean you out
 completely.

 "That was fun," she says, although her huge grin is enough of an
 indication. "Thanks. I feel a lot better now."

 [1] "I would actually love to taste something&"
 [2] "I know what kind of ice cream I want."
 [3] "Would you mind my asking&"
 [4] "You wanna hear something weird?"
 [5] "What's your tattoo of?"
 [6] "What are all these newspaper clippings?"
 [7] "What's wrong?"
 [8] "I should get going."

>7

 She breathes in so deeply that you find yourself inhaling along with
 her, like you're in a yoga class or something. Then she sighs a massive
 sigh, a lingering sigh. Only after she is done sighing do you allow
 yourself to exhale.

 "I only opened this place a few weeks ago. My parents loaned me a lot
 of money to get it started, but I kept insisting that I wanted the
 business to be separate from the dairy farm. I learned a lot about
 business from them. I wanted to be independent.

 "They were worried about this neighborhood, too, but I said it was the
 best place. I said an ice cream store couldn't fail in the middle of
 summer, right? But I've had almost no customers. People mostly just
 come in and look around, like they're gonna buy the place out from
 under me, and then they tell me 'Oh, this is a tough town for a new
 business.' 'You're a very brave girl.'" She stares out the window.

 "And those cops, and the guy next door, they just stop by to 'see how
 I'm doing.' They look all up and down the walls, they look under the
 seats, and then they ask if the building inspector has been around.
 There's nothing wrong with this building.

 "And I think people are spreading rumors. Someone heard there's E. coli
 in my ice cream. There's not. I don't have a stupid dripping soft-serve
 dispenser hanging in the air to collect germs."

 She sighs again. "Sorry. Let's talk about something else."

 [1] "I would actually love to taste something&"
 [2] "I know what kind of ice cream I want."
 [3] "Would you mind my asking&"
 [4] "You wanna hear something weird?"

>eat ice cream
 Vanilla is supposed to be boring. So what the heck is going on here?

 It's something else. It's not really vanilla; the girl is just calling
 it that. Or there is vanilla in it, but something else has been done.
 What is it?

 It's something that's not bad, exactly, but something that you're not
 supposed to eat. That must be it, because you're starting to feel a
 little guilty. You hold on to that thought: You need to figure this out
 before it's gone.

 So you start eating a little slower. You close your eyes.

 Cookie dough! This tastes like cookie dough. It's not vanilla ice cream
 with pieces of cookie dough in it; it's cookie dough in the shape
 of--Goodness.

 Now that that's sorted out, you eat the rest fairly quickly, with a
 feeling of great satisfaction.

>go south
 Outside Get Your Licks
 From this end of the street you can almost see the respectable part of
 town, way over to the east.

 The name of this establishment, according to the vinyl banner in the
 window, is "Get Your Licks." The sign in the door to the north says
 it's open, but in spite of the heat you can see no customers inside.

>go west
 Outside Paco's Tacos
 Here's the entrance to Paco's Tacos, everyone's favorite place for a
 bite as long as everything else is closed. The stretch of sidewalk here
 is covered by a striped awning for the masses to huddle under while
 waiting for a table at peak hours. The door to the north is framed by
 neon signs behind plate glass windows. Further east is Get Your Licks.

 Now is a good time to go over the plan before you pull the job. It'd be
 nice if you had everything written down as a reminder, but a note like
 that could end up being incriminating. So, mentally, as you're standing
 here in front of the taco shop, remember:

 Once you're inside, you're going to go north across the dining room, to
 where the counter is. Then you're going to point the gun at the cashier
 and, without hesitating, tell the cashier to open the cash register.
 When that's done, tell the cashier to take the money from the register
 and tell the cashier to give the money to you. (But don't say "to you",
 say "to me".) Finally, while still pointing the gun at the cashier,
 walk backward to the entrance. Once you're back outside, you just have
 to get to your car and drive away.

 Nobody will get hurt, nobody will recognize you, and best of all,
 nobody will get evicted.

 Inside Paco's Tacos
 The place is pretty much dead. The chairs aren't on the tables yet, but
 the place may as well be closed. The nearest sign of life is a tiny
 potted tree.

 At the north end, across the dining room, there's a counter attended by
 a cashier, and sitting in a booth way over there are a couple of
 bikers.

 An oversized painting on the west wall arrests your attention.

>examine painting
 a huge chunk of wall.

 In long, curving strokes that remind you unpleasantly of the sixties,
 the painting apparently depicts some Victorian millionaire's
 smoking-room. An unseen fireplace glows orange on the green wallpaper
 and the green velvet-backed armchairs, which are huddled around
 something else, over to the side, which you also can't see.

 The focus of the composition is a collection of masks, mounted on the
 wall like trophies and casting weird shadows in the firelight. The
 masks are all grotesque: One has a huge lower jaw and protruding tusks;
 one has shaggy sideburns, a lolling tongue and a goatee; the worst has
 three unsettlingly lifelike eyeballs set above two noses and a wide,
 gap-toothed mouth.

 A mask! Should you be wearing a mask? The cashier will see your face!
 Or the bikers will see your face, and they'll know it was you!

 No, hold on. The reason you're here at Paco's is because nobody around
 here is going to recognize you, because they'd never think to haul in a
 guy from your neighborhood for a robbery committed here. You've got
 nothing to worry about; just get over there and do it.

 As you stagger backward, you collide with something large and
 doughy-soft, which grunts in response and drops an envelope at your
 feet.


 It's the size of a normal business envelope, but made out of fancy
 black paper. The side where you'd normally write an address is
 decorated with an embossed gold border. Both sides are bulging out from
 the girth of whatever's inside.

 That thing you just bumped into, evidently a sweaty, balding man,
 snatches the envelope from your hands without so much as a thank you.

 "Make sure and lock up my office when you leave," he barks at the
 cashier. The cashier merely mumbles in response, but his boss is
 already stomping his way out.

 Paco's Tacos Counter
 The cash register sits here on a long counter, accompanied by a great
 big tip jar and guarded by a bored-looking cashier. The menu is printed
 on a big chalkboard near the ceiling.

 Around the counter and to the north is a long hallway. That must be
 where the big guy came from.

 A blonde cop and a mustachioed cop are enjoying their tacos in a booth
 near the counter.

 huge eyebrows requires some mental and emotional exertion, but even if
 your body language betrays your anxiety, the process has its intended
 effect. He's too afraid to run, but he backs away a little; he even
 tries to put his hands up, although it isn't easy while he's holding
 that blanket in them.

 "Okay okay okay okay!" he stammers. "What do you want?"

 [1] "Hand over that blanket!"
 [2] "How about you give me your wallet."
 [3] "Where's Paco?"
 [4] "Why don't you tell me what the heck is going on around here?"

 "Sure! Sure thing! Absolutely!" He tosses the mass of fabric to you,
 and you manage to catch it with the arm that isn't busy pointing a gun

 of ram mask.

 In retrospect, the word "toss" was a poor choice: he throws the ram
 mask in a high arc, forcing you to take your eyes and and gun off of
 him as you attempt to complete the pass while holding a gun in one hand
 and big heavy cape in the other.

 Ritual, and that entry to our auxiliary Location is granted only to
 those who pay fitting Homage to our Guardian Pet.

 A blonde cop and a mustachioed cop are enjoying their tacos in a booth
 near the counter.

 The moral of this particular story is: aggravated assault upon a law
 enforcement officer is a felony offense, carrying a minimum sentence of
 three years.

 "Good evening, ollifis--" and then you seem to somehow choke on your
 own tongue. The cop with the mustache is able to stifle his laughter,
 but his partner audibly snorts into her drink.

 "Good evening yourself, citizen!" answers the mustachioed cop, as his
 partner wipes off her face. "This here is Officer Rae, and I am Officer
 Bob, at your service."

 "What, seriously?" Officer Rae asks, as if the sin of illegal parking
 could possibly be interpreted as a joke.

 After a couple seconds of blank stares, the officers seem to come to

 just continues staring, catlike, straight in front of him.

 Paco's Tacos Back Office
 Your fingers find the light switch in the instant that your brain
 realizes there's someone sitting there in the darkness, ready to bust a
 cap in you the second they get a good look at who's sneaking around in
 their office. But when you turn on the light, there's nobody there.

 This place is a dump. The one nod to aesthetics is a framed portrait
 hanging on the wall that looks like it was painted in a hurry. Besides
 that, the desk, the plastic wardrobe, the wheeled upholstered chair
 from 1976, even the garbage can all look like they fell down a couple
 flights of stairs each.

 Set into the wall behind the desk and looking extremely out of place in
 this atmosphere of squalor is an expensive-looking safe.

 As it turns out, the safe is only a few inches deep, and the back wall

>press red button
 nerve to push the button. Once you do, the console makes a couple of
 worrying clicking noises--but then it starts humming, and the two
 screens light up. The images are in grainy black and white, but you can
 mostly tell what's going on:

 On the left screen is one of those Egyptian statues of a guy with a
 wolf's head wearing a towel. Someone has placed it in front of a
 curtain.

 Meanwhile, on the right screen, a number of people in hooded cloaks are
 milling around a candlelit room.


 Someone in a hooded cloak walks up to the wolf-head statue on the left
 screen.

 On the right screen you can discern that the cloaked people are moving
 around a huge table. It's impossible to tell how many people there are;
 there are dozens of candles in the room, and they cast all kinds of
 confusing shadows.

>push button
 console stops humming.

>push button

 On the left screen, the wolf head guy raises his hand to the cloaked
 person, like he's saying "Halt!"

 For a moment the crowd on the right screen parts, and you can see a
 large section of the table.

>watch screens

>watch left screen
 creepy wolf head, standing guard in front of a curtained doorway.

 The cloaked person on the left screen raises his own hand (or her own
 hand?) back at the wolf guy. Are they going to high five? Are they just
 comparing hands? You can't see the cloaked guy's face.

 The items are being arranged on the huge table in a spiral pattern:
 Circles within circles, around and around&

>watch left screen
 creepy wolf head, standing guard in front of a curtained doorway.

 On the left screen, the guy facing Shirtless Wolf Head Guy looks down
 to reach in his cloak, and for the moment he faces the camera you can
 see he's wearing a stoic lion's-face mask.

 The intricate pattern on the table on the right screen is obviously
 arranged around some central thing, but you can't make out what it is.

>examine thing

>wait

 The dude (or lady) in the cloak on the left screen pulls a mean-looking
 dagger out of the copious folds of his (or her) voluminous robe.

 The centerpiece of the table appears for an instant, glittering. Is it
 a diamond? Is it multiple diamonds?

>wait

 On the left screen, the cloaked person points his dagger right at
 Shirtless Wolf Head Guy.

 One of the hooded people on the right screen raises her arms.
 Apparently she's yelling at everyone else, because they all stop what
 they're doing and look at her.

>wait

 The wolf head guy nods his smooth, expressionless, incredibly eerie
 wolf head. The cloaked guy nods back.

 The leader of the cloaked people on the right screen gestures
 theatrically toward the table. As she turns, you can tell she's wearing
 a mask with a long snout.

>wait

 On the left screen, the wolf head guy steps out of the way, and the guy
 in the cloak walks through the curtain and out of sight.

 On the right screen, the people are watching the snout-masked lady
 intently. Some of them start nodding.

>examine lady
 the snout-masked lady.

 Shirtless Wolf Head Guy steps back in front of the curtain and crosses
 his arms.

 As Snout-Mask Woman's gesticulations reach a crescendo, some other
 person (probably wearing a cloak) walks in front of the camera. The
 image on the right screen goes completely black.

>read letter
 folded in thirds like it was delivered in a business envelope. The
 letterhead (also gold-embossed) says ÅÃÄ·Á¹¿ É¸¿Â, which must be
 Russian or something. At least the main text is in English:

 Venerable Brothers and Sisters!

 Circumstances have lately demanded that the meeting of our illustrious
 Organization in this turning of the Moon must be convened instead at
 our auxiliary Location, accessible via the roof of your Brother's most
 distinguished La Pizzá Building. A thousand thousand apologies are
 extended for the inexcusable lack of Foresight that necessitated this
 disturbance.

 You are reminded, O Brothers and Sisters, that acceptance into our
 Mystery is forbidden to those who do not prove themselves by the Sacred
 Ritual, and that entry to our auxiliary Location is granted only to
 those who pay fitting Homage to our Guardian Pet.

 You are thus warned!

 And then where the signature should be there's just this goofy code: An
 upside-down J, a picture of a boot, and then picture of a teacup.

 Standing perfectly still, with his arms crossed, the wolf head guy is
 starting to look like a statue again.

 Whoever's standing in front of the camera for the right screen doesn't
 seem to have anywhere else to be.

 The cash register sits here on a long counter, accompanied by a great
 big tip jar and guarded by a bored-looking cashier. The menu is printed

 The place is pretty much dead. The chairs aren't on the tables yet, but
 the place may as well be closed.

 Outside Paco's Tacos
 Here's the entrance to Paco's Tacos, everyone's favorite place for a
 bite as long as everything else is closed. The stretch of sidewalk here
 is covered by a striped awning for the masses to huddle under while

 neon signs behind plate glass windows. Further east is Get Your Licks.

>go west
 Alley
 The bricks in this alley are so old that at the middle of the road they
 have sunk a full foot below the level of their neighbors closer to the
 building walls. Walking across this uneven half-pipe of bricks is an
 unnerving and probably dangerous experience.

 The alley continues north, past a staple-encrusted utility pole, until
 the beams of the streetlamps don't quite reach; west is the parking lot
 and east is Paco's Taco's.

>go west
 Paco's Tacos Parking Lot
 The single streetlight shared by the two parking lots casts most of its
 light on the La Pizza side, so while you can barely see your own feet,
 your car back on the west side is cast in a harsh orange glow. Paco's
 is on the other side of the alley east of here.

 This side of the lot has its own informative sign.

 That silver Honda is still parked here.

 La Pizzá Parking Lot
 This parking lot is reserved solely for La Pizzá customers, as the sign

 but of course by this time of night it's locked up tight.

 You brought a date here once. You could barely afford it then; you
 definitely wouldn't be able to afford it now.

 Come to think of it, as expensive as that date was, it should have gone
 a lot better.

 The dark red brick building, tall and well-kept, looks extremely out of
 place in this neighborhood. By way of contrast, the lot directly to the
 north is vacant, a jungle of weeds and trash.

 The name of the restaurant is displayed above the door in the form of a
 massive cursive neon sign, taking advantage of every flourish and
 curlicue that "La Pizzá Pizzeria" can offer. Above the sign there are a
 number of windows, some with their lights on. There must be apartments
 or offices or something up on the second floor.

 That buzzing you hear is the fancy security system.

 Rooftop Garden
 Good grief.

 On top of this pizzeria, in the middle of this terrifying neighborhood,
 somebody has cultivated a garden the likes of which you have only seen
 in movies about drug lords. Here is a tall shrub that has been cut into
 the shape of a naked lady. Here is a statue of a cat, carved out of a
 block of marble or ivory or something like that. The flowerbeds are
 immaculate, lit by pale blue lamps in neat little rows.

 The centerpiece of the spectacle is a gigantic artificial waterfall.

 access door. How dramatic.

 Service Tunnel
 As you cross some invisible threshold, the doors slam shut behind you.

 This looks like one of those tunnels they use to covertly transport
 uncostumed workers at Disneyland. The walls are exactly as tall as the
 ceiling and floor are wide, so the hallway is perfectly square, a fact
 which wouldn't normally seem so eerie, but these walls are sweating in
 the humidity, and there are ancient stains and cracks all over them.
 The lights are only bare bulbs, and they're spaced out too far apart.

 There's a human figure at the far eastern end of the hall.

>go east

 Here, in a dark spot between two light bulbs, is a good place to pause

 Before you can finish a single syllable, Wolf Head Guy holds up a

 Now he raises his palm to you, as if to say: "Halt!"

 Meeting Room
 What is this?

 Dozens of people are milling around. They're all in hooded cloaks, and
 they're all wearing creepy animal masks, except for the people who are
 wearing very creepy yellow, glassy-eyed human masks. The room is
 huge--where the heck is this room?--and lit up with hundreds of little
 candles, enough to make the room unbearably hot. But the air
 conditioning is on full blast, so the flames just whip around crazily
 and cast all kinds of weird shadows.

 At one end of the room is a raised platform with a podium; behind the
 platform are two giant bird-headed statues.

 In the middle of the room is a massive table.

 Shirtless Wolf Head Guy pokes his head in through the curtain and nods
 at somebody.

>examine table
 napkins and punch bowls and plates and platters: shrimp, sorbets,
 mozzarella bruschetta, mousse in little glasses, slices of brie--a
 tourbillon des hors d'oeuvre that sweeps the eye like a drowning sailor
 toward the center of its vortex: An ice sculpture of a bird.

 One of the cloaks breaks off from a group to take the stage. When he
 steps into the light, you can see his mask is a long, pointed face, a
 reptilian face. Either an alligator or a crocodile, depending on what
 the difference between those two things is.

 As he nears the middle of the stage, the murmuring in the room
 diminishes, and the knots of people loosen into more of a herd as
 everyone turns toward the platform.

>examine anubis

>examine sobek
 doesn't care what he knocks over.

 The guy in the alligator mask raises his arms. "Brothers and sisters!"
 his voice rumbles, muffled by the mask. "I'm getting the signal from
 Doug that everyone is here, so let me start out by saying I am pleased,
 I am beyond pleased, to call to order this meeting of the Mystery of
 Thoth."

 Where have you heard that voice before?

 doesn't care what he knocks over.

 "The catering for tonight's meeting was overseen by Sister Heatherton,
 and it's a really amazing spread, as you can see; I think she deserves
 some recognition. Sister Heatherton, can you show us where you are?"

 A woman near you wearing a hippopotamus mask (Is that Snout Mask Woman?
 She's thinner in person) raises her hand. "I had a lot of help!" she
 giggles, but her attempt at modesty is drowned out by applause.

>applaud

>talk to paco
 is the one respect in which this party is like every other one you've
 been to.

 "The chocolate mousse in particular is just staggering," continues the
 alligator mask, as the ovation peters out. "You don't serve this to the
 general public, do you?"

 She shakes her hippo head emphatically, but Alligator Mask isn't really
 looking for an answer so much as he's trying to get a laugh out of the
 audience.

 "Good! They don't deserve mousse like this!" he growls, and as everyone
 laughs some more, you realize who it is that's wearing that mask.

 It's Paco! From Paco's Tacos! Although you're starting to suspect that
 "Paco" isn't his real name.

>eat mousse
 You carefully pick up one of the fragile-looking glasses.

 "Now, before we get going, let me remind you that Brother Kerrigan is
 playing taxman, going around collecting your offerings," Paco
 continues. Somebody on the other end of the room raises a stack of
 envelopes over his head.

 "Remember, a lot of people are depending on us, and vice versa. And
 although the Mystery of Thoth has yet to be recognized as a charitable
 organization," (another big laugh) "&your support does make a
 difference in these people's lives. You all know Vic, from the health
 department. He told me the other day that his family's going to Maui in
 a couple weeks. I said 'That's nice! So, what are you gonna do while
 they're away?'"

 Huge laugh.

>laugh

>wait

 Brother Kerrigan weaves his way through the crowd, shaking his pile of
 envelopes at everybody he passes, but each one raises a hand as he
 approaches, as if to say "No, I'm good." When he's finally satisfied,
 he makes his way east, where the crowd parts to reveal a previously
 hidden doorway.

>wait

 "I'm glad everybody could make it; sorry we had to change the venue on
 you at the last minute. We were hoping to do this in Sister Witt's
 lounge at the Lafayette Café, but things fell through. I think it was a
 piano that fell through, right? Fell through the ceiling!"

 This one doesn't land quite as well. Paco coughs.

 "Well, let's get right to it. What is there as far as old business?"

 Someone else speaks up: "There is the matter of the interloper."

 Interloper! Do they mean you? Are you found out?

>wait

 "I was actually hoping to save that issue for last&" Paco grouses.

 "Well I say we settle it now! She's been enough of an annoyance these
 past months."

 Then it's probably not you. You've only been an annoyance for maybe a
 couple of hours.

>wait

 Paco throws up his hands. "The chair recognizes your bellyaching,
 Brother Stantz! But there are some other things we need to get out of
 the way first. How about new business; is there any new business?"

 Brother Kerrigan re-emerges from the doorway to the east.

 Back Office of Thoth
 It's even colder in here.

 This is either an office or some sort of lounge: The walls are lined
 with shelves, but the shelves are all empty; up against one wall is an
 aquarium, but without any fish; there's a long table in the middle of
 the room, but there's only one chair. A window in the door to the north
 and a lamp inside the aquarium supply the only light.

 The door shuts behind you with a faint click, but the conversation in
 the next room is still audible.

 That pile of fat envelopes is here, but now they're all empty.

 "Point of order! We haven't finished with old business!"

 "Oh, point of order, huh? Well, I am going to table your point of
 order. I am going to postpone your point of order indefinitely."

 Paco's rapport with his audience has taken a turn. People are
 grumbling.

>search envelopes

 A new voice pipes up: "Can't we have just one meeting that doesn't end
 with everybody at each other's throats?"

 "Yes! That is exact--" Paco is blustering! "That's why I wanted to
 finish off with the interloper issue, because it's something we can all
 agree on, so we could work as a team, and then when we were finished we
 could all leave feeling like we accomplished something."

 There's not much going on up here, except for the door to the roof and
 the stairs leading down.

 There's a button on the wall here labeled "waterfall control," which is

>restore

>look
 Dozens of people are milling around. They're all in hooded cloaks, and
 they're all wearing creepy animal masks, except for the people who are
 wearing very creepy yellow, glassy-eyed human masks. The room is
 huge--where the heck is this room?--and lit up with hundreds of little
 candles, enough to make the room unbearably hot. But the air
 conditioning is on full blast, so the flames just whip around crazily
 and cast all kinds of weird shadows.

 At one end of the room is a raised platform with a podium; behind the
 platform are two giant bird-headed statues.

 In the middle of the room is a massive table.

 "Point of order! We haven't finished with old business!"

 "Oh, point of order, huh? Well, I am going to table your point of

 On the long table are a stack of maps, a crumpled list, some minutes, a
 cashbox and a collection of restaurant menus.

 Brother Stantz yells: "I think the first thing we should accomplish is
 the election of a new chair!"

>examine cashbox
 stands at high school football games. It's heavy. But it's locked.

 Somebody yells "For the new chair, I nominate myself!" but nobody
 seconds the motion.

>examine maps

 Each one has title written on it just north of the city limits, like
 "ITALIAN" or "sports" or "ETHNIC," and then the city is broken up into
 different-colored sections, like a history textbook explaining where
 countries used to be.

 Here's the "pizza" map: La Pizzá is in the middle of a big red area
 that takes up this whole side of town--that's right, there aren't any
 other pizza places around here, are there?--and the rest of the city is
 split up into much smaller blue, green, yellow and orange chunks, each
 with one other (less expensive) pizzeria.

 The "Mexican" map has a doodle of a sombrero on it. And there's Paco's
 Tacos, sitting in the middle of its kingdom like Pierre in the middle
 of South Dakota.

 There's an ice cream map, too, but it's a little different: this
 neighborhood is on the outskirts of the territory set apart for Captain
 Hugo's Locker (a pirate-themed pizza/ice cream place ten blocks from
 here). Get Your Licks isn't labeled by name, but the plat where it's
 located has been circled in red pen a few times. Maybe by Captain Hugo?

 He must have been pretty angry.

 As you're contemplating the pros and cons of opening the emergency
 exit, Paco arrives at the top of the stairs. "Very kind of you to wait
 up for me," he pants. As you reach in your pocket for the gun, Paco
 pulls off your mask. "Pleasure to meet you," he says, his own mask
 completely motionless. Then something (a fist!) slams into your face,
 and all of a sudden you are on the floor.

 Maybe, someday, things will get better for you.

 Paco turns your body over and presses a fat elbow against your neck.
 Then he tears off your mask and throws it down the alley.

 "What are you doing here?" he heaves.

 [1] "I don't know!

 Paco leans in closer. "We're business owners. We work together, to
 contribute to this community. We keep people like you in line," he
 hisses, "because you people don't contribute anything."

 [1] "I don't know!
 [2] "Who are you?"

 "Who am I?! I'm the Blue Moon! I'm Mike's On Fifth! I'm La Pizzá! I own

 Now he's wheezing too.

 happens and you're able to reach your gun. You point it at his face
 just long enough for him to realize what it is, and then you pull the
 trigger.

 You hear a sharp crack, an explosion.

 Which is odd, because the gun wasn't&

 Now you're standing up, and Paco is lying face down on the ground.

 &wasn't loaded&

 Although you're pretty sure Paco isn't his real name.

 Up the Alley
 Any further north and the road gets too dark for any sane person to be
 walking around alone, but south of here there are streetlights, and a
 street.

 Paco is lying on the ground here.

>check gun
 enough to scare anybody it's pointed at, this is a kind of gun with a
 specific name--a brand name, like cars have. It also has a "caliber,"
 which is a number that refers to what kind of bullets you can put in
 it, but you can't remember that either.

 The important details are easy enough: You point it like this, you put
 your index finger in here, and when you squeeze the trigger it goes
 boom, assuming the gun is loaded. One other important thing to keep in
 mind is that the gun is not loaded.

 Then you hear a scream from somewhere south of here. Some doors slam,
 some people yell at each other, and then a dog starts barking, so of
 course every other dog in the neighborhood starts barking, and from
 that point the noise becomes incomprehensible.

 The gunshot must have been across the street. Some guy got mad at some
 other guy, or got mad at some other guy's car, or whatever. Somebody
 else's problem.

 Maybe it's time to go home.

 Alley
 The bricks in this alley are so old that at the middle of the road they
 have sunk a full foot below the level of their neighbors closer to the
 building walls. Walking across this uneven half-pipe of bricks is an
 unnerving and probably dangerous experience.

 The alley continues north, past a staple-encrusted utility pole, until
 the beams of the streetlamps don't quite reach; west is the parking lot

 You can see a ram mask here.

 Thoth - Minutes of" and then a date. The text is mostly
 incomprehensible bureaucratic nonsense. A random paragraph catches your
 eye:

 Brother Alpert moved to trade masks with somebody, saying he was "tired
 of being the guy with a beetle for a face." Brother Malone denied this
 motion, although Brother Alpert was later seen at Mike's on Fifth
 offering Brother Stantz an undisclosed amount to swap him for the cobra
 mask.

 Each one is "respectfully submitted" by Sister Lagrange.

 started out as a typewritten table: A column of names, a column of
 positions, and a column of dollar amounts. For example:

 BOB ELIOT       PATROLMAN      $100

 Most of these names you don't recognize: building inspectors and health
 officials, police, newspaper editors. But the mayor is on here too! On
 his row, "CITY COUNCILMAN" has been crossed out and replaced with
 "MAYOR," and "$5000" has been crossed out and replaced with a much
 larger number.

 it's open, but in spite of the heat you can see no customers inside.

 Is this really just an ice cream place? It looks more like a mountain
 cottage, with lace curtains in the windows, and a low table with a

 You'd probably take it for a coffeeshop if the counter didn't include a

 So you tell her everything, from breaking into the car, to the cat

 telling it, it sounds stupider and stupider, but your friend is
 transfixed. She doesn't doubt you for a second.

 And then you show her the papers you found in the office.

 "This is me!" she says, pointing to a circle on one of the maps. "This
 is proof that they're after me! And this list has gotta be list of
 bribes that they're paying to people all over town! The freakin' mayor!
 You uncovered a huge, crazy restaurant conspiracy!"

 She pauses. "We have to be careful about this. They're gonna be after
 you. But we can lay low. We can take it slow. We'll talk to my parents;
 they can hide you up on the farm if they have to. We'll figure it out."

 Paco's Tacos Parking Lot
 The single streetlight shared by the two parking lots casts most of its
 light on the La Pizza side, so while you can barely see your own feet,
 your car back on the west side is cast in a harsh orange glow. Paco's
 is on the other side of the alley east of here.

 This side of the lot has its own informative sign.

 That silver Honda is still parked here.

>go west
 La Pizzá Parking Lot
 This parking lot is reserved solely for La Pizzá customers, as the sign
 over there clearly states. La Pizzá is across the street west of here,
 but of course by this time of night it's locked up tight.

 A low-slung iron chain separates this section of the lot from the one
 reserved for patrons of Paco's Tacos, which is further east.

 Your piece of junk Ford Focus is parked here.

 Aside from the usual accomodations, the interior of this automobile

 So, then, you go ahead and start the car.

 It's so late now that there's nobody else on the roads. You can drive
 slowly, incredibly slowly, through intersections and empty parking
 lots; when you come up to the top of a hill you can weave back and
 forth while you idle your way down.

 And as you do, you let yourself smile a little bit.

 Some weird stuff happens over the next few weeks: Paco's Tacos closes,
 and then La Pizzá says it's "on hiatus," and some stories come out in

 name), next to a story about his controversial acquittal, you don't
 notice at all.
