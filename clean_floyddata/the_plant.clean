 [If you haven't played this game before, please type HELP.]




 You're just starting to doze off when a jerking motion brings you back
 to alertness.  You look over to see your boss, Mr. Teeterwaller,
 struggling to steer the car onto the shoulder as the engine dies.  You
 can see that all of the dashboard lights are on as the car jerks to a
 stop.

 This is turning into a fine business trip.  First Mr. Teeterwaller
 insists on making the five-hour car trip in the middle of the night so
 the company won't have to pay for a hotel, then you spend an hour stuck
 behind a convoy of slow trucks on Teeterwaller's two-lane supposed
 short-cut, and now his aging bargain-basement car strands you out in
 the middle of nowhere.

 Teeterwaller turns off the headlights and turns on the hazard lights.
 "I just had this thing in the shop," he mumbles.

 In the car
    The Toyunchknisk Piglet was imported from Blottnya during the brief
 period between the fall of the old iron-fisted regime and the ethnic
 unrest that divided the tiny country into several even tinier countries
 whose names you can't recall, since the press lost interest several
 years ago.  The car is almost comically spartan, so it's just like your
 boss to own one.  The only amenity the dashboard offers is a glove
 compartment; no radio, no air conditioner, no console armrest, no
 cup-holders.
    You're sitting in the rather uncomfortable passenger's seat.  The
 driver's door is closed, and your door is closed.
    Sitting on the back seat is a jacket, a map, a Project Tyche manual,
 and a magazine.  The ignition seems to contain a car key.
    Your boss Mr. Teeterwaller is here.

 You're carrying your temporary ID card.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

 I don't know the word "this".

>talk to teeterwaller
 I don't know the word "talk".

>examine teeterwaller
 He's about five-foot-six, with graying black hair that he keeps cut in
 a short business-like style, and a neatly trimmed mustache.  He's
 wearing a dull brown slacks that are part of a suit (although he's not
 currently wearing the jacket), a beige shirt and a brown striped tie.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>search teeterwaller's pockets
 "Hey!"  Teeterwaller protests, moving away from you.

 The hazard lights click on and off in a steady rhythm.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>examine manual
 It's a stack of photocopied pages, bound with a plastic spiral.  The
 cover page reads "Project Tyche Specification" at the top, and
 "Omegatron Corporation - Copyright 1972 - Confidential" at the bottom.
 You glance through it, and find page after page of electronic diagrams
 and schematics interspersed with dense blocks of technical information
 and parts lists.  None of it is familiar to you, since you're in the
 software part of the company.

 It occurs to you that you should ask Mr. Teeterwaller about the project
 some time, since you're always interested in hearing stories about the
 early days at the company.

 The hazard lights click on and off in a steady rhythm.

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>examine magazine
    DUFON Journal
    The Official Journal of the Discovery UFO Network

 The cover has a photo of a streak of light in the dusk sky above a
 wooded hilltop, with the caption The Milltown Sighting:  A New
 Re-Examination, Part III.

 You thumb through the magazine.  There's an article by an expert on
 official cover-ups, insisting that the government open an investigation
 into a previous investigation of an alleged cover-up.  Another article
 describes the many revelations that have come out of Blottnya since the
 break-up of the old government, including photos from Blottnya's old
 space program that show that the "face" on Mars bears an uncanny
 resemblance a famous Eastern European television star, raising the
 possibility that the ancient Martians not only were capable of space
 travel but time travel as well.

 The interesting thing about the journal is that they're obviously quite
 serious; it's not a supermarket tabloid.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>ask teeterwaller about project
 "I worked on that project, oh, twenty-five years ago or so.  We were
 building an embedded controller system for some industrial equipment;
 it would be quite routine today, but it had some amazing technology for
 those days.  There were a couple of parts in particular, some logic
 chips, that seemed to come out of nowhere...  without them the project
 would have been nearly impossible.  I got a copy of the old
 specification document from the corporate archives people a couple of
 months ago, because I wanted to figure out the history of those logic
 chips, but for some reason that section of the spec is missing."

>get map
 Taken.

 The hazard lights click on and off in a steady rhythm.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>examine it
 "Excellent idea," Teeterwaller says.  The two of you unfold the map and
 inspect it.

 You find state route 142 on the map.  You don't know exactly how far
 you are from Bakerton, but you'd guess that it's at least fifty miles
 west, which puts you in this big empty expanse out in the valley.  The
 nearest city is Conners City, which is perhaps twenty miles east.  The
 map shows a couple of crossroads that could be a short distance to the
 east; it doesn't depict any businesses, but it's possible that one of
 the crossroads has a service station or at least someone with a phone.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>look out window
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>look through window
 I don't see any window here.

>open passenger's door
 Opened.

 The hazard lights click on and off in a steady rhythm.

>look out windscreen
 I don't know the word "windscreen".

>examine id
 It's your temporary employee identification card; it's just a worn
 piece of cardboard with the Omegatron logo and the word TEMPORARY
 stamped in red letters.  It's amazing how inefficient the company's
 bureaucracy is; you've worked at Omegatron for three months now, and
 you're still stuck with this temporary badge, which doesn't have the
 little magnetic stripe that opens doors, so you constantly have to call
 Security to come unlock doors for you.

 The hazard lights click on and off in a steady rhythm.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>turn off hazard lights
 Okay, it's now turned off.

>open glove
 Opening the glove compartment reveals a garage opener.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>get garage. x garage
 Taken.

 Teeterwaller notices you taking the opener.  "That isn't mine," he
 offers.  "I think it belonged to the previous owner of the car.  I've
 never been able to return it, of course, since I bought the car at an
 estate sale."

 (the garage opener)
 It's a small plastic box with a large button.  On the back is a small
 compartment, which is currently closed.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>turn ignition key
 Turning the car key doesn't have any effect.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>take key
 Mr. Teeterwaller looks at you sharply, wondering if you've forgotten
 whose car this is.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>open compartment
 Opening the garage opener compartment reveals a battery.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>look under car seat
 I don't see any car seat here.

>look under seat
 Which seat do you mean, the driver's seat, the passenger's seat, or the
 back seat?

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>look under passenger's seat
 There's nothing under the passenger's seat.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>look under driver's seat
 There's nothing under the driver's seat.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>look under back seat
 There's nothing under the back seat.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>kiss teeterwaller
 I don't know the word "kiss".

>examine back seat
 On the back seat you see a jacket, a Project Tyche manual, and a DUFON
 journal.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>take jacket

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>search jacket
 You find nothing of interest.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road, near car
    The road stretches off into the dim moonlight to the east and west.
 Mr. Teeterwaller's car sits in the shoulder, parked just slightly off
 the road.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

>look under car
 There's nothing under the car.

>get under car
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine car
 The small economy car is parked in the shoulder just off the road.  The
 driver's door is open, and the passenger's door is open.

 A corner of the sky glows briefly with a lightning flash.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>ask boss about map
 "Excellent idea," Teeterwaller says.  The two of you unfold the map and
 inspect it.

 You find state route 142 on the map.  You don't know exactly how far
 you are from Bakerton, but you'd guess that it's at least fifty miles
 west, which puts you in this big empty expanse out in the valley.  The
 nearest city is Conners City, which is perhaps twenty miles east.  The
 map shows a couple of crossroads that could be a short distance to the
 east; it doesn't depict any businesses, but it's possible that one of
 the crossroads has a service station or at least someone with a phone.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road at driveway
    A gravel driveway leads away from the road to the north.  The road
 continues east and west.  To the west you can just make out Mr.
 Teeterwaller's car; it's too dark to see much to the east.

>examine driveway
 The driveway leads north.

>go north
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Driveway
    The driveway ends at a closed roll-up metal door in a large,
 windowless building to the north.  The door looks like it belongs on a
 one-car garage.  Bolted to the side of the building is a heavy steel
 chain, attached to which is a dog harness.  The driveway leads south,
 back to the road.
    A huge dog chained to the side of the building eyes you warily.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>examine dog
 The dog is bigger than you are.  You don't recognize the breed; he has
 tall, pointy ears, a long muzzle, a long bushy tail, and a body like a
 bear.  His hair is light brown, with a few darker markings.  He has a
 harness around his chest, which is attached to a chain.

 "I saw a television program where they explained that guard dogs are
 usually trained using German commands," Teeterwaller says.  "I think
 you just have to say `aus,' which is German for `out,' to call off an
 attack."

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>press button
 You press the button.  A moment later, you hear a thunk, and the door
 starts opening.  The door slowly rolls up its tracks, and finally stops
 when fully open.

 [Your score has increased by two points.]

>enter garage
 (the garage opener button)
 I don't know how to enter the garage opener button.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>go north
 The dog jumps into your path, snarling and growling, refusing to let
 you pass.

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

>pet dog
 The dog is acting too menacing to pet him right now.

 Teeterwaller tells you about the latest episode of his favorite TV
 show, "Shadow Man."  You never liked the show very much--too much silly
 conspiracy theory stuff--but you listen politely.

>say aus
 I don't understand that sentence.

>dog, aus
 The dog rears up on his hind legs and barks angrily at you.

 Teeterwaller practically jumps into the air at the barking and runs
 back a ways further from the dog.  "I guess this must not be a German
 dog," he says.

 The dog gradually calms down again, and resumes his guarding posture.

>doh, sit
 I don't know the word "doh".

>dog, out
 The dog just snarls at you menacingly.

>dog, sit
 What do you want the huge dog to sit on?

>dog, who's a good doggie?
 I don't know the word "who's".

>dog, halt
 I don't know the word "halt".

>dog, down
 The dog just snarls at you menacingly.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>dog, sit down
 What do you want the huge dog to sit on?

>dog, haus
 I don't know the word "haus".

>examine chain
 It's about ten feet long and made of heavy steel links.  One end is
 bolted to the wall of the building; at the other end is a clip, which
 is attached to the dog harness.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>unclip chain
 The dog tenses up as you approach and snarls menacingly.  You decide to
 keep at a safe distance.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>examine harness
 The harness goes around a dog's chest.  Even though it's meant for a
 dog, this one seems like it's big enough for a bear.  At the top of the
 harness is a ring that's used to attach the harness to a chain or
 leash; it's currently attached to the chain.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>examine ring

 A corner of the sky glows briefly with a lightning flash.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>dog, eat teeterwaller
 The dog just snarls at you menacingly.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>feed boss to dog
 I don't know the word "feed".

>inventory
 You have your temporary ID card, a map, a garage opener, a jacket, a
 Project Tyche manual, and a DUFON journal.  The garage opener
 compartment seems to contain a battery.

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

>show jacket to dog
 The huge dog isn't impressed.

>throw jacket at dog
 You miss.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Driveway
    The driveway ends at an open roll-up metal door in a large,
 windowless building to the north.  The door looks like it belongs on a
 one-car garage.  Bolted to the side of the building is a heavy steel
 chain, attached to which is a dog harness.  The driveway leads south,
 back to the road.
    A huge dog chained to the side of the building eyes you warily.
    Your boss Mr. Teeterwaller is here.

>brandish rolled up journal
 I don't know the word "brandish".

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road at driveway

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road at ditch
    The road continues east and west, rising slightly as it crosses a
 deep ditch.  Metal guard rails run alongside the road on both sides to
 prevent vehicles from running into the ditch.  You can't see anything
 through the darkness to the west, but to the east you can see some
 dimly flashing lights.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Detour
    A set of wooden barricades, painted with orange stripes and topped
 with flashing orange lights, stand blocking the road to the east to
 vehicles, and "Detour" signs point to the intersecting road leading
 south.  Beyond the signs, trucks and construction machinery sit idle on
 the road, presumably awaiting the return of workers in the morning.

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

>get lights
 You can't have the barricade.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>go west
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road at ditch

>examine ditch
 It's a deep ditch, running north and south under the road.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>search ditch
 You find nothing of interest.

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>examine rail
 The guard rails are heavily dented from years of collisions.  At the
 right end of the rail on the north side of the road, you notice a
 narrow foot path leading northeast.

 [Your score has increased by one point.]

>go northeast
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path
    The path runs north and south alongside a deep ditch, which is to
 the west.  The road lies to the south.

>examine ditch
 The ditch runs north and south alongside the path.  The banks are steep
 here.

 A corner of the sky glows briefly with a lightning flash.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>examine banks
 I don't see any banks here.

>enter ditch
 The bank is too steep to climb down here.

 A corner of the sky glows briefly with a lightning flash.

>go north
 The path veers toward the ditch, then slopes down along a terrace cut
 into the ditch's bank until it reaches the bottom of the ditch.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path in ditch
    The path occupies a narrow ledge just above the stagnant water of
 the ditch. The path to the south climbs a narrow terrace cut into the
 ditch's bank.  You can't go any further north, but the tenuous ledge
 hugging the bank to the southwest looks passable; without something to
 light the way, though, it would be too dangerous.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

>examine terrace
 It's just wide enough to accommodate the path.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

>take battery
 Behind the battery, you find a diagram showing the proper way to
 install the battery, and a bank of tiny switches.

 Taken.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

>examine water
 The ditch runs north and south.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>examine switches
 Eight tiny slide switches are lined up next to each other.  On the side
 of each switch, eight small notches show the possible positions; each
 switch can be set to a number from 0 to 7.  Currently, the switches are
 in the following positions:  55567562.  Just above the switches,
 someone has written "55567562".

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>examine diagram
 The diagram shows the correct way to install the battery.

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>install battery wrong
 I don't know the word "wrong".

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>go south
 The path ascends a terrace cut into the ditch's bank back to the top of
 the bank.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Detour

>look
 Detour
    A set of wooden barricades, painted with orange stripes and topped

 vehicles, and "Detour" signs point to the intersecting road leading
 south.  Beyond the signs, trucks and construction machinery sit idle on
 the road, presumably awaiting the return of workers in the morning.
    Your boss Mr. Teeterwaller is here.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>examine barricades
>examine machinery
 The barricades block vehicle travel to the east, and direct traffic
 along the road to the south.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

 You can't see much detail from here, but all of the equipment looks
 idle.

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road
    The road runs north and south.  To the north, you can just make out
 the dim lights of the detour barricades.

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road
    A light fog hangs over the road in the still night air.  The road
 continues into the darkness to the north.  To the south, distant lights
 glow weakly through the fog.

>examine fog
 It's a thin fog, not dense enough to obscure nearby objects very much,
 but it gives the night air a damp chill.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>examine fog

 but it gives the night air a damp chill.

>shiver
 I don't know the word "shiver".

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Outside Complex
    The road ends at the gated entrance to a huge industrial complex
 sprawling over the foggy landscape to the south.  A tall chain-link
 fence surrounds the complex; the fence is interrupted only by a sliding
 section of fence that serves as a gate (currently closed) across the
 road.  Narrow paths run along the outside of the fence east and west of
 the road.  The road continues into the darkness to the north.

 "That's curious," Teeterwaller mumbles.  "Why would they set up a
 detour that just comes to a dead end?"

>examine lights
 The complex must be a chemical factory, or an oil refinery, or perhaps
 a power plant.  Towering smokestacks and fat vertical tanks are wrapped
 in a thick tangle of pipes, which run up the towers, between
 smokestacks, alongside each other, grouped together in wide sets of
 parallel cylinders for hundreds of yards and then suddenly parting
 ways, bending abruptly up, down, around one other, joining new groups
 for a while then bending away again.  Atop the towers are flashing
 lights to warn off aircraft, dozens of lights slowly flashing to their
 own rhythm, twinkling sometimes with their neighbors and often on their
 own.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>open gate
 The gate is securely closed.

>examine fense
>press button
 I don't know the word "fense".

 "Click."

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>examine fence
 The fence is huge, easily twenty feet high, and topped with loops of
 razor wire.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>examine path
 It's not much of a path; just a narrow band along the fence where no
 vegetation is growing.  One path leads east, and another leads west.

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>examine gate
 The gate is merely a separate section of the fence that slides across
 the road. It's currently closed.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path outside fence
    The terrain is clear for a few feet outside the perimeter of the
 fence, creating this path.  The road is just to the west, and the
 enormous plant complex is beyond the fence to the south.  The terrain
 slopes up to the east.

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Hilltop
    The terrain is considerably elevated above the road, which lies some
 distance to the west.  Scrubby bushes grow almost up to the fence here,
 making it too difficult to travel further to the east.  The elevation
 gives you a clear view of the road through the vegetation.  The
 sprawling plant complex lies to the south, beyond the fence, and the
 path leads west along the fence.

 From the direction of the plant, you hear three short, low-pitched
 electronic beeps, distant and echoing but still loud, then a deep male
 voice, broadcast through a public address system in the plant.

 "Section blue, section green, clear sector S, stand by stations.
 Section black, target approaching, commence operation."

 From the road to the north, faint lights come into view, moving down
 the road toward the gate.  The lights come closer and you see that
 several large vehicles are approaching.

 The gate in the fence starts slowly sliding open.  A group of men
 wearing dark jumpsuits and black helmets and carrying machine guns trot
 out through the gate; some take up positions along the shoulder of the
 road, others run out into the underbrush alongside the road.  The men
 keep pouring out of the gate until at least a couple hundred have
 emerged.

 The first few of the approaching vehicles rumble to a stop near the
 gate.  You can now see that the vehicles are large semi trucks, painted
 a uniform white, without any markings you can see.

>search bushes
 You find nothing of interest.

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 The last of the trucks rolls to a stop up the road; you count eight
 trucks.  Some of the armed men start moving in groups towards the
 trucks, while others remain crouched along the sides of the road.

 Mr. Teeterwaller crouches behind the bushes, watching the road
 intently.  "Get down!  Get down!"  he whispers at you urgently.  You
 move to conceal yourself a little better.

>hide in bush
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>hide in bushes
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>wait
 Time passes...

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 One by one, the truck drivers emerge from their cabs, holding their
 arms up while the armed men lead them away from the trucks, towards the
 plant gate.

 The fourth truck in line suddenly lurches forward, pulls out of the
 line, and starts picking up speed, sending everyone on the road
 scrambling to get out of its way.  Gunfire immediately erupts from the
 men flanking the road, and the truck is engulfed in a shower of sparks
 and flying metal.  The cab of the truck suddenly lurches sideways; half
 a moment later a deafening boom sounds.  The truck rolls off the road
 and stops as the engine compartment bursts into flames; two figures
 jump out of the cab and flee in opposite directions.

 More gunfire from up the road.  Soldiers in full battle gear have come
 storming out of the backs of two of the trucks and are scrambling
 around the trucks looking for cover, and trying to fire back through
 the hailstorm of bullets coming from the sides of the road.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 The gunfire starts to trail off.  Soon the soldiers seem to be the only
 ones firing; they quickly notice this and stop firing, looking warily
 around.

 A deep rumbling sound draws your attention to the plant gate, where you
 see a tank come rolling out onto the road.  The tank rumbles to a stop
 just past the first truck.  The tank's turret swings slowly around
 until the protruding cylinder of its cannon is pointed at one of the
 trucks the soldiers are using for cover.  Almost in unison, the
 soldiers around the truck bolt from their positions and scatter across
 the road; only a moment later, flames shoot out of the tank's cannon
 and the truck explodes in a huge fireball.

 The attackers waste no time rounding up the scattered soldiers, and the
 remaining soldiers quickly surrender and are marching toward the plant
 gate with their hands in the air.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 The last of the soldiers march into the plant, a large contingent of
 their attackers escorting them at gunpoint.  A few dozen of the armed
 men continue patrolling around the edges of the road, but most are
 heading back towards the gate.

 Electronic beeps echo from the direction of the plant, followed by a
 voice on the PA system.  "Section blue, section green, all clear.
 Section white, initiate containment procedures."

 From up the road, several vehicles that look like road construction
 equipment--dump trucks,bulldozers,and the like--roll toward the
 wreckage.  At the same time, a few dozen people wearing blue hard hats
 and tool belts, making them look like construction workers, walk out of
 the complex's gate and start heading purposefully toward the trucks.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 The trucks that are still intact start moving into the plant, one by
 one, as the bulldozers clear a path through the wreckage.

>a
 An article must be followed by a noun.

>wait
 Time passes...

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 The construction workers continue clearing the wreckage out of the
 road.

 "Did you see that?"  Teeterwaller says, talking very quietly.  "What
 could that have been about?"

>panic
 I don't know the word "panic".

>xyzzy
 Poof!  In a cloud of orange smoke, you're magically transported to...

 Hilltop
    The terrain is considerably elevated above the road, which lies some
 distance to the west.  Scrubby bushes grow almost up to the fence here,
 making it too difficult to travel further to the east.  The elevation
 gives you a clear view of the road through the vegetation.  The
 sprawling plant complex lies to the south, beyond the fence, and the
 path leads west along the fence.
    Your boss Mr. Teeterwaller is here.

 (Okay, it wasn't that magical.)

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 The construction workers continue to clear the wreckage from the road.

 "Look," Teeterwaller says, "I know this is going to sound a little
 strange, but I think we should try and find out what's going on here.
 I think we need to get inside there," he says, indicating the
 industrial complex beyond the fence. "I think this could be really
 important."

>lol
 I don't know the word "lol".

>go west
 Teeterwaller stops you.  "Let's stay here for a moment," he whispers.
 "We need to figure out what's going on before we walk into the middle
 of this."

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 The construction workers clear the last of the wreckage from the road.
 The construction equipment and workers withdraw into the complex,
 leaving only a few of the armed men still out on the road.

 "I could really use your help getting in there," Teeterwaller says.  "I
 know it could be dangerous, so if you don't want to join me, if you
 just want to return to the car and wait for help, I'll understand.  But
 I'm not sure I can do it alone."

>ask teeterwaller about plant
 "All I can tell is that it looks like a chemical plant."

 Teeterwaller nervously watches the road through the bushes.

 You hear the rumbling of approaching trucks, this time from the
 complex.  Out of the gate comes a large, white truck, exactly like the
 ones that arrived before the fighting.  The truck accelerates up the
 road to the north.  Another truck follows, then another, until the
 trucks number eight.  These obviously aren't the original eight,
 though, since several of those were badly damaged in the fighting.

 "I used to fancy myself something of an amateur sleuth," Teeterwaller
 tells you, looking a little sheepish and little smug at the same time.
 "This will give me a chance to get back in practice."

 The trucks travel away to the north until they're out of sight.  The
 remaining men on the road withdraw into the complex, and the gate
 slides shut.

>go west
 You start back towards the road, staying alert for anyone who might
 still be patrolling.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Outside Complex

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

>go west
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path outside fence
    The path ends abruptly to the west with a wall of tall, thorny
 bushes growing out of a deep ditch.  The road is just to the east, and
 the plant complex is on the other side of the fence to the south.
    A metal framework under the fence inside the ditch is visible
 through the bushes.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

>examine framework
 The framework is inside the ditch, under the fence, so you can't easily
 see the whole thing through the bushes.  Two vertical rails, one on
 each side of the ditch, are connected at the top by a crossbar.  A
 winch is in the center of the crossbar, and a pair of cables lead down
 from the winch.

 You find nothing of interest.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road
    The brush alongside the road is crushed against the ground, and deep
 tracks from heavy machinery are pressed into the soil.  The road
 continues east and west; you can see only darkness in either direction.

>examine tracks
 The tracks are from several different types of trucks or tractors;
 they're wide and deep, clearly from heavy equipment.  They don't lead
 anywhere, but just meander on and off the road for a stretch, as though
 the equipment was turning around at this spot.

 You notice a flashlight partially hidden by some of the flattened
 brush.  You reach down and pick up the flashlight.

 [Your score has increased by one point.]

    A small, dilapidated building is just north of the road, which

    This one-room schoolhouse has clearly been out of use for many
 years.  A chalkboard is on one wall, and a single desk remains.  Exits

 The blackboard is chipped and warped with age.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

 It's the type that combines a desk and a chair into one unit.  The top
 of the desk can be opened to get at a storage area.  The top is

    Blottnisq Ninshta
    Blottnian Today

 It seems to be an elementary Blottnian textbook, for learning Blottnian
 as a foreign language.  Despite its age ("copyright 1967, The Horton,
 Merfin Company, New York"), it's still intact.  It has chapters
 numbered 1 through 5 that you can read.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>read 1
 Inshna Hojdzunshchk!

 Welcome to your introductory Blottnian course!  In this book, we will
 learn not only how to speak and write the Blottnian language, but much
 about the rich history and colorful culture of the nation of Blottnya.

 (The chapter goes on at length about how to use the textbook and
 accompanying audio tapes; a quick scan of the chapter reveals little of
 note.)

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

 This chapter covers some basic vocabulary.

 Common conversational verbs:
    azdrupiq -- to sit
    yijtgiq -- to stand
    pozhbriq -- to open
    oxviq -- to close
    lloyriq -- to speak
    chdraliq -- to be silent
    wurtriq -- to attack
    shchrudiq -- to befriend

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

 This chapter discusses the culture of Blottnya.  You scan a few of the
 passages.

 A picture of a dog, which looks very much like the guard dog you
 encountered earlier, is accompanied by a caption:

 Years ago, herders used the Blottnian Moose Dog to help control their
 herds.  Centuries of careful breeding have made the Moose Dog extremely
 intelligent and hard-working.  Today, the same herding instinct that
 once served moose herders now serves Blottnian government security
 police, who use the Moose Dog to help control the cheerful citizens.
 Blottnya even trains Moose Dogs for service abroad; guard dogs are the
 country's second largest export.

 Teeterwaller reads the book over your shoulder.  "I've never heard of
 anyone in this country studying Blottnian before," he says.

>ask teeterewaller about blottnya
 I don't know the word "teeterewaller".

>ask teeterwaller about blottnya
 "I went there on a business trip once," he says.  "That was years ago,
 back when they had a government.  It was a little scary--they had
 undercover police following us around everywhere, and you could hear
 them listening in on the phone.  I wouldn't want to go back."

>read 4
 This chapter is about the convoluted grammar of Blottnian, which is
 considerably more complicated than any language you've studied.  You
 find a verb conjugation table for regular "-iq" verbs; they seem to use
 "to open" as the example:

 First-person singular, prideful:  pozhbroq
 First-person singular, shameful:  pozhbronsh
 First-person singular, uncertain:  pozhbrioo
 First-person singular, emphatic:  pozhbrim

 Second-person singular, complimentary:  pozhbras
 Second-person singular, accusatory:  pozhbrazim
 Second-person singular, commanding:  pozhbru

 It goes on and on like that for forty-five different cases.  And that's
 just the present tense.

 This is a chapter on culture, focusing on how children in Blottnya are
 raised.  For example, it points out that parents in Blottnya are very
 fond of using reverse psychology, always telling children just the
 opposite of what they want them to do.  Apparently this practice
 applies to road signs as well, making driving in Blottnya extremely
 confusing for foreigners.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

 School yard
    This school yard must always have been a modest playground at best,
 but is now little more than a dirt patch overgrown with weeds.  The

    A huge dog chained to the side of the building eyes you warily.

 The dog sits down for a moment, then resumes his guarding posture.

 A corner of the sky glows briefly with a lightning flash.

>dog, wurtru
 The dog suddenly becomes very friendly.  He wags his tale and whines at
 you happily.

 "Whatever you said, it worked!"  Teeterwaller exclaims.  He cautiously
 approaches the dog and pets him, getting lots of licking and
 tail-wagging in return.

 leash.

 Building
    This cavernous space is broken up only by a few vertical steel beams
 supporting the roof high above.  A diffuse yellow glow from pale lights
 suspended from above filters down through the thick dust hanging in the
 air.
    Rows of drab gray metal desks extend off in all directions,
 separated by just enough space to form aisles.  On each desk is a
 ragged pile, several feet high, of assorted papers, and a small machine
 of some kind.  Some of the piles of paper are narrow, precariously
 balanced columns, others are mounds; a few have fallen over, scattering
 papers across the floor.
    A large door (currently open) to the south leads out of the
 building.  The area near the door, where you're standing, is clear of
 desks, and instead is mostly open, except for a huge workbench.
 Several huge burlap sacks full of envelopes are piled alongside the
 workbench.
    Sitting on the workbench is a small plastic device and a looseleaf
 page.

>examine device
 The device appears to be a portable hand-held scanner of some kind.
 The boxy plastic body is mounted on top of a pistol grip with a
 trigger; at the front of the body is a little red window, and on top is
 an electronic display.  Clearly, you are meant to hold the scanner by
 the grip, point it at an object to be scanned, and pull the trigger.
 The display is currently dark.

 You point the scanner at the bar code and pull the trigger.
 Pencil-thin lines of red light vibrate across the bar code for a few

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>teeterwaller, shut up
 I don't know the word "shut".

>examine machine
 The machines look a little like typewriters, but they have strange
 keyboards, and the paper-feeding mechanisms don't look like they're for
 paper.

 "Those are card punch three-three-five's," Teeterwaller says, sounding
 surprised.  It takes you a moment to figure out what he means, then you
 realize he's talking about a model number, something like Card Punch
 335~.  "I haven't seen one of these in years," he says.  You're afraid
 he's going to go off on one of his tangents about the good old days of
 computing when real programmers had to key in the operating system in
 binary with their toes, but he just looks fondly at the machines.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>examine papers
 The piles look random; they're composed of papers of all sizes and

>examine workbench
 The workbench is very wide, and dominates the entire open area near the
 door.  On closer inspection, you see that it's not merely a workbench,
 but is actually a machine of some kind.  In the center of surface of
 the workbench is a rectangular depression, about the size of a
 coffee-table book and about four inches deep, lined at the bottom with
 little gears and wheels; it's currently empty.  Sticking out of the
 front of the workbench, roughly under the top depression, is a metal
 basket, of roughly the same dimensions as the depression, placed in
 front of a chute coming out of the workbench; the basket contains a
 deck of punched cards.

 On top of the workbench, near the depression, is a knob that looks like
 the channel dial on a really old television; the knob can be set to
 values from 0 to 7, and is currently set to 0.  Next to the knob is a
 black push-button.

 There's nothing on the workbench.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>examine cards
 The deck is ten inches thick and must contain thousands of cards--far
 too many to examine individually.  Each card has numerous neat little
 square holes randomly dispersed across the card, and a series of
 numbers printed across the top, corresponding to the punched holes.
 The numbers are arranged into groups: the first group has eight digits;
 the second group has one or two digits, then a decimal point, then two
 more digits.

 Glancing through the deck, you notice that the cards are sorted by the
 first group of numbers, which would make it easy to find a particular
 number of that group in the deck.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

 The machine inside the workbench grinds into action.  Waves of motion
 start rippling through the cards sitting in the depression, and they
 all vibrate rapidly.  The machinery makes more and more noise until the
 whole workbench is vibrating wildly.  Suddenly, the cards start
 disappearing into the machinery, and after a few moments the entire
 deck has been sucked inside the workbench.

 The workbench impossibly gets even louder, and starts making bangs and
 clunks at irregular intervals--clunk...  whir...
 bang-bang-bang-clunk...  whir...  clunk-bang...  clunk...  bang-bang...
 whir...

 Suddenly, the cards start issuing from the chute at incredible speed
 and lining up neatly in the basket.  It only takes a few seconds before
 the entire deck has been reassembled.

 The noise from the machinery starts to subside, falling in both pitch
 and volume as the gears and flywheels coast to a halt within the
 workbench.  The machine eventually becomes quiet and still.

 start rippling through the cards sitting in the depression, and they
 all vibrate rapidly.  The machinery makes more and more noise until the
 whole workbench is vibrating wildly.  Suddenly, the cards start
 disappearing into the machinery, and after a few moments the entire
 deck has been sucked inside the workbench.

 The workbench impossibly gets even louder, and starts making bangs and
 clunks at irregular intervals--clunk...  whir...
 bang-bang-bang-clunk...  whir...  clunk-bang...  clunk...  bang-bang...
 whir...

 Suddenly, the cards start issuing from the chute at incredible speed
 and lining up neatly in the basket.  It only takes a few seconds before
 the entire deck has been reassembled.

 The noise from the machinery starts to subside, falling in both pitch
 and volume as the gears and flywheels coast to a halt within the
 workbench.  The machine eventually becomes quiet and still.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>examine cards
 The deck is ten inches thick and must contain thousands of cards--far
 too many to examine individually.  Each card has numerous neat little
 square holes randomly dispersed across the card, and a series of
 numbers printed across the top, corresponding to the punched holes.
 The numbers are arranged into groups: the first group has eight digits;
 the second group has one or two digits, then a decimal point, then two
 more digits.

 Glancing through the deck, you can detect no apparent ordering; they're
 just randomly arranged in the deck, which would make it next to
 impossible to find a particular number in the deck.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>put cards in depression. turn knob to 0. press button
 Done.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

 There are words after your command that I couldn't use.

>examine switches
 Eight tiny slide switches are lined up next to each other.  On the side
 of each switch, eight small notches show the possible positions; each
 switch can be set to a number from 0 to 7.  Currently, the switches are
 in the following positions:  55567562.  Just above the switches,
 someone has written "55567562".

>turn knob to 0
 Okay, it's now turned to 0.

>look up 55567562 in deck
 The cards are sorted, so you easily flip through the deck to where
 55567562 should be.  You find a card that looks like this:

    55567562        2.57

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>look up 2.57 in envelopes
 You can't look up anything in the envelopes.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>look up 12345678 in deck
 Since the cards are sorted, you easily flip through the deck to where
 12345678 should be, but you don't find a card with that value.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>look up 12345670 in deck
 Since the cards are sorted, you easily flip through the deck to where
 12345670 should be, but you don't find a card with that value.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>examine envelopes
 There are far too many envelopes for a thorough examination, but you
 pick a few at random, and find that they're all addressed to different
 products' rebate offers:  Healthy Concern Low-Fat Crème Brûlée Frozen
 Dessert $1.51 Rebate Offer, Gazette SonarTrac Razor 3-Pack $2.15
 Mail-In Rebate Offer, Sergeant Sweet's Peanut Butter Sweet with
 Chocolaty Chips and Macadamia Nuts 44 Ounce Breakfast Cereal $3.77

 Shane's No-Spill Men's 100% Cotton Briefs $2.80 Mail-In Rebate Offer,
 and many more.  Even though each envelope is for a different product's
 rebate offer, they all have the same address:  PO Box 2004, Conners
 City.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

 Road
    The road continues east and west.  To the east you can just make out
 Teeterwaller's car.  It's too dark to see much to the west, although
 you remember from having driven this stretch that there's nothing for a
 long ways.

>go west
 Teeterwaller stops you.  "We just came from this direction," he says.
 "There's nothing this way for at least twenty miles."

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

 Road, near car
    The road stretches off into the dim moonlight to the east and west.
 Mr. Teeterwaller's car sits in the shoulder, parked just slightly off
 the road.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road at driveway
    A gravel driveway leads away from the road to the north.  The road
 continues east and west.  To the west you can just make out Mr.
 Teeterwaller's car; it's too dark to see much to the east.

>go northeast
 It's too dangerous to attempt to travel the off-road terrain on foot in
 this darkness.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Road at ditch
    The road continues east and west, rising slightly as it crosses a
 deep ditch.  Metal guard rails run alongside the road on both sides to
 prevent vehicles from running into the ditch; a narrow foot path leads
 northeast from the end of the north rail.  In the darkness, you can't
 see far down the road in either direction.

>go northeast
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path
    The path runs north and south alongside a deep ditch, which is to
 the west.  The road lies to the south.

>go north
 The path veers toward the ditch, then slopes down along a terrace cut
 into the ditch's bank until it reaches the bottom of the ditch.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path in ditch
    The path occupies a narrow ledge just above the stagnant water of
 the ditch. The path to the south climbs a narrow terrace cut into the
 ditch's bank.  You can't go any further north, but the tenuous ledge
 hugging the bank to the southwest looks passable; without something to
 light the way, though, it would be too dangerous.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>turn on flashlight
 You switch on the flashlight.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>go southwest
 It's difficult, but since you have enough light to see what you're
 doing, you manage to make your way further along the ledge.

 "Wait for me!"  your boss cries from behind.  You shine the light back
 for him, and he nervously negotiates the narrow ledge.

 Tunnel
    The ditch passes through a tunnel under the road.  The path is wide
 and straight here, continuing alongside the ditch to the north and
 south.

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path near ditch
    The path continues north and south along the ditch.  To the north,
 you can just barely make out the road crossing over the ditch.  To the
 south, you see some faint lights in the distance.

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Ditch, north of fence
    The ditch is deep here--the banks are perhaps twenty feet high.  A
 chain-link fence runs above the top of the ditch to the south, below
 which is a gate made of closely-spaced steel bars; the gate covers the
 full width of the ditch, and blocks travel to the south.

>examine gate
 The gate is made of vertical steel bars, spaced about six inches apart.
 Rails at either side guide the gate so that it can slide up and down,
 and a pair of cables attached to the top of the gate are connected to a
 winch high above.  The gate is immersed in the water and covers the
 full width of the ditch; it completely blocks travel to the south.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>examine cables
 The cables connect the gate to a winch above the gate.

>examine ditch
 The ditch runs north and south.

>go down
 You can't go that way.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>press button

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

 Teeterwaller tells you about the latest episode of his favorite TV
 show, "Shadow Man."  You never liked the show very much--too much silly
 conspiracy theory stuff--but you listen politely.

>examine garage
 (the garage opener button)
 You presumably push the button to transmit a radio signal to open a
 garage door somewhere.

>examine switches
 Eight tiny slide switches are lined up next to each other.  On the side
 of each switch, eight small notches show the possible positions; each
 switch can be set to a number from 0 to 7.  Currently, the switches are
 in the following positions:  55567562.  Just above the switches,
 someone has written "55567562".

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>search gate
 You find nothing of interest.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>go east
 The bank is too steep to climb.

 Lightning flashes for a moment on the horizon.

>go west
 You don't have any desire to wade into the stagnant water.

>examine winch
 It's high above; you can't see any detail from here.

>examine rails
 The rails guide the gate so that it can move up and down.

 A corner of the sky glows briefly with a lightning flash.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>open gate
 You brace yourself and pull the bars as hard as you can, but the gate
 is much too heavy to move.

>set switches to 20300273
 You carefully manipulate the tiny switches into the new positions.

>press button
 "Click."

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>inventory
 You have your temporary ID card, a map, a garage opener, a jacket, a
 Project Tyche manual, a DUFON journal, a battery, a flashlight
 (providing light), a Blottnian textbook, a hand pump, a dog harness, a
 portable hand-held scanner, and a looseleaf page.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

    A light fog hangs over the road in the still night air.  The road
 continues into the darkness to the north.  To the south, distant lights
 glow weakly through the fog.

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Outside Complex
    The road ends at the gated entrance to a huge industrial complex
 sprawling over the foggy landscape to the south.  A tall chain-link
 fence surrounds the complex; the fence is interrupted only by a sliding
 section of fence that serves as a gate (currently closed) across the
 road.  Narrow paths run along the outside of the fence east and west of
 the road.  The road continues into the darkness to the north.

>examine gate
 The gate is merely a separate section of the fence that slides across
 the road. It's currently closed.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Path outside fence
    The terrain is clear for a few feet outside the perimeter of the
 fence, creating this path.  The road is just to the west, and the
 enormous plant complex is beyond the fence to the south.  The terrain
 slopes up to the east.

 In the distance, a flash of lightning glows in the sky.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Hilltop
    The terrain is considerably elevated above the road, which lies some
 distance to the west.  Scrubby bushes grow almost up to the fence here,
 making it too difficult to travel further to the east.  The elevation
 gives you a clear view of the road through the vegetation.  The
 sprawling plant complex lies to the south, beyond the fence, and the
 path leads west along the fence.

    The path ends abruptly to the west with a wall of tall, thorny
 bushes growing out of a deep ditch.  The road is just to the east, and
 the plant complex is on the other side of the fence to the south.
    A metal framework under the fence inside the ditch is visible
 through the bushes.

>examine framework
 The framework is inside the ditch, under the fence, so you can't easily
 see the whole thing through the bushes.  Two vertical rails, one on
 each side of the ditch, are connected at the top by a crossbar.  A
 winch is in the center of the crossbar, and a pair of cables lead down
 from the winch.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>examine winch
 It looks like a heavy-duty winch capable of lifting an extremely large
 load.

 Next to the winch is a small black box.

 A corner of the sky glows briefly with a lightning flash.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>examine box
 You shine the flashlight on the black box, which gives you enough light
 to make out some detail.  Several wires run from the box to the winch,
 and a short antenna sticks up out of the top of the box.  On the side
 of the box is a white adhesive label with what looks like a bar code
 printed on it.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>scan bar code
 (with the portable hand-held scanner)
 Which bar code do you mean, the looseleaf page bar code, or the black
 box bar code?

>scan black box bar code
 (with the portable hand-held scanner)
 You point the scanner at the bar code and pull the trigger.
 Pencil-thin lines of red light vibrate across the bar code for a few
 moments, then the scanner emits a short bip, and the display lights up
 to show:  4.71.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

 [Your score has increased by one point.]

>look up 4.71
 What do you want to look up it in?

>look up 4.71 in cards

>go north
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Driveway
    The driveway ends at an open roll-up metal door in a large,
 windowless building to the north.  The door looks like it belongs on a
 one-car garage.  Bolted to the side of the building is a heavy steel
 chain.  The driveway leads south, back to the road.
    A huge dog is here, happily puttering around.

>go north
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Building
    This cavernous space is broken up only by a few vertical steel beams
 supporting the roof high above.  A diffuse yellow glow from pale lights
 suspended from above filters down through the thick dust hanging in the
 air.
    Rows of drab gray metal desks extend off in all directions,
 separated by just enough space to form aisles.  On each desk is a
 ragged pile, several feet high, of assorted papers, and a small machine
 of some kind.  Some of the piles of paper are narrow, precariously
 balanced columns, others are mounds; a few have fallen over, scattering
 papers across the floor.
    A large door (currently open) to the south leads out of the
 building.  The area near the door, where you're standing, is clear of
 desks, and instead is mostly open, except for a huge workbench.
 Several huge burlap sacks full of envelopes are piled alongside the
 workbench.

>take cards
 Taken.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>look up 4.71

 The cards are sorted, so you easily flip through the deck to where 4.71

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Ditch, north of fence
    The ditch is deep here--the banks are perhaps twenty feet high.  A
 chain-link fence runs above the top of the ditch to the south, below
 which is a gate made of closely-spaced steel bars; the gate covers the
 full width of the ditch, and blocks travel to the south.

 A lightning flash momentarily lights up the sky in the distance.

>press button
 From above, you hear the winch make a loud humming noise.  The cables
 become tense, then the gate starts slowly rising.  It lifts up out of
 the water, then continues sliding up the rails for a few feet.  When it
 reaches the top of the rails, it stops, and the winch becomes silent.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

 [Your score has increased by five points.]

>SAVE
>cf18
 Saved.

>score
 Your score is 20 of a possible 100, in 297 moves.  If Mr. Teeterwaller
 were to evaluate your performance thus far, he would rank you as an
 up-and-coming go-getter.

 [Use the FULL SCORE command to display a detailed list of the points
 you've earned.]

>go south
 You have to bend down slightly to move past the gate.  Mr. Teeterwaller
 cautiously joins you, looking up to make sure the gate isn't going to
 come crashing down on him as he passes underneath.  As you cross under
 the fence, the ditch changes to a concrete-lined canal.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Canal near gate
    Vertical concrete walls line this deep canal.  A chain-link fence
 crosses over the top of the canal above; under the fence, a steel gate
 hangs several feet above the water, allowing passage through a low
 opening under the gate.  To the south, the canal stops at a concrete
 wall perforated by an array of pipes.
    A ladder is set into the west wall.

 "Wonderful job!"  Teeterwaller says excitedly.  "We're inside the
 complex!  Now we just need to find the trucks."

>examine pipes
 The pipes vary in size; most are about a foot in diameter, but many are
 only a few inches and a few are two feet wide.  The pipes all open into
 the canal, and most are dripping slightly.

 Something deep inside a large rusty pipe catches your eye.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>examine rusty
 The pipe is over two feet in diameter and is very rusty, whereas most
 of the other pipes look clean and new.  You can see something inside
 the pipe, but you can't tell what it is from here; it's too far inside
 the pipe for you to reach it.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>put harness in pipe
 You don't want to put anything into the pipe; it would just get all
 covered with slime.

>hit pipe
 Which pipe do you mean, the array of pipes, or the rusty pipe?

>hit rusty
 I don't know how to attack the rusty pipe.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>ask teeterwaller about trucks
 "You probably know as much as I do."

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>enter pipe
 Which pipe do you mean, the array of pipes, or the rusty pipe?

>rusty
 I don't know how to enter the rusty pipe.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a
 short distance to the west.

>kick rusty
 I don't know how to attack the rusty pipe.

 A lightning bolt flashes through the sky a short distance to the north.

>go up
 You cautiously climb up the rungs.  It's quite a ways up and you feel a
 little anxious about the height, but you reach the top and peer over
 the edge to see if there are any guards about.  You can't see anyone,
 so you pull yourself over the edge.

 You motion to Teeterwaller to join you.  He nervously climbs the
 ladder, looking down several times.

 Bank of canal
    A deep, concrete-lined canal is to the east; metal rungs are set
 into the wall, forming a ladder down into the canal.  A tall fence
 topped with razor wire is to the north.
    Pipes and conduits are everywhere, packed so tightly together that
 they form walls.  Narrow openings in the pipes allow travel to the
 southeast and southwest.  To the west, a cylindrical tower rises up out
 of the pipes and looms several stories overhead; a spiral stairway
 encircling the tower leads up.  The ground is replaced by a metal
 grating for the ten feet around the tower.

>go west
 You cross the grating, and climb the gentle slope of the stairway
 through one revolution around the tower.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, two stories up
    A short landing, about two stories above the ground on the east side
 of the tower, interrupts the steady spiral of the stairs, which
 continue up and down.  The canal is visible in the distance below, and
 the tower looms overhead.
    Sitting above you, on top of the grating of the stairs one level up,
 you see a yellow hard-hat and a white hard-hat.

>take hats
 yellow hard-hat:  That's on the other side of the grating.
 white hard-hat:  That's on the other side of the grating.

>go up
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, four stories up
    The stairs end at this landing, and go no further up.  This landing
 is nearly at the top of the tower, around four stories above the
 ground, and on the east side of the tower.
    A closed rounded metal door is set into the tower wall to the west.
 A large wheel is in the center of the door.
    Through the grating below, you see a yellow hard-hat and a white
 hard-hat on the stairs one level down.

>examine wheel
 It's a big metal wheel, about a foot in diameter, in the middle of the
 door.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>turn wheel
 The wheel is hard to move, but you manage to turn it a couple of
 revolutions clockwise, where it stops.  A hissing sound escapes from
 the door for a few moments, then fades away.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>open door
 As soon as you start to move the door, a thick, acrid vapor oozes out
 of the opening, and your eyes and lungs start burning.  You quickly
 shut the door again.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a
 short distance to the west.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>get hats
 yellow hard-hat:  That's on the other side of the grating.
 white hard-hat:  That's on the other side of the grating.

>go down
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 of the tower, interrupts the steady spiral of the stairs, which
 continue up and down.  The canal is visible in the distance below, and
 the tower looms overhead.
    Sitting above you, on top of the grating of the stairs one level up,
 you see a yellow hard-hat and a white hard-hat.

 A lightning bolt rips through the sky nearby to the east.

>examine grating
 Which grating do you mean, the top grating, or the bottom grating?

>examine top grating
 The grating is the bottom of the stairs one level above.  Through the
 grating, you can see a yellow hard-hat and a white hard-hat.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>open grating
 (the top grating)
 It's too far away.

>go down
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Bank of canal
    A deep, concrete-lined canal is to the east; metal rungs are set
 into the wall, forming a ladder down into the canal.  A tall fence
 topped with razor wire is to the north.
    Pipes and conduits are everywhere, packed so tightly together that
 they form walls.  Narrow openings in the pipes allow travel to the
 southeast and southwest.  To the west, a cylindrical tower rises up out
 of the pipes and looms several stories overhead; a spiral stairway
 encircling the tower leads up.  The ground is replaced by a metal
 grating for the ten feet around the tower.

>examine grating
 It's a sturdy metal grating covering a shaft around the tower.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>open grating
 It's firmly fixed in place.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>go southwest
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Safety station
    The forest of pipes opens up a little here into a large clear area.
 In the center of the clearing stands a tall metal enclosure topped with
 a brightly-lit red sign:

      SAFETY STATION

 An opening in the pipes leads northeast, and another passage leads
 south.  You may also be able to squeeze through a narrow crawl-way to
 the southeast.

>examine south
 I don't see any south here.

>look south
 I don't see any south here.

>examine passage
 I don't know the word "passage".

>examine enclosure
 The enclosure is about seven feet tall and open on one side to provide
 access to the equipment within.  A gray fire hose is coiled up neatly
 on a giant reel. In addition, the enclosure contains a newer gas mask
 and an older gas mask.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>get masks
 newer gas mask:  Mr. Teeterwaller picks up the older gas mask.  "Good
 idea," he says.  "This could come in handy."

 Taken.
 older gas mask:  Mr. Teeterwaller is carrying the older gas mask and
 won't let you have it.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>get hose
 You take hold of the end of the fire hose, and unreel the hose a couple
 of feet.  The reel remains under tension as you pull it, but it allows
 you to unreel the hose.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>examine hose
 (the coiled fire hose)
 The hose is neatly coiled on a giant reel (except for the last few
 feet, which you're holding); next to the coil is a valve with a brass
 control wheel.  The hose ends in a nozzle, attached to which is a
 lever.

 A lightning bolt rips through the sky nearby to the east.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>turn wheel
 You turn the wheel counterclockwise until it stops.  You can hear water
 rush through the valve for a few moments as the hose pressurizes.

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>go northeast
 You carefully pull the fire hose along with you.  The reel unwinds,
 letting out the hose for you.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Bank of canal
    A deep, concrete-lined canal is to the east; metal rungs are set
 into the wall, forming a ladder down into the canal.  A tall fence
 topped with razor wire is to the north.
    Pipes and conduits are everywhere, packed so tightly together that
 they form walls.  Narrow openings in the pipes allow travel to the
 southeast and southwest.  To the west, a cylindrical tower rises up out
 of the pipes and looms several stories overhead; a spiral stairway
 encircling the tower leads up.  The ground is replaced by a metal
 grating for the ten feet around the tower.
    The fire hose stretches along the ground through the opening to the
 southwest.

>go west
 You won't be able to drag the hose up the stairs; it would get stuck
 wrapping around the tower wall.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>go east
 Teeterwaller looks down into the canal.  "I don't think the hose will
 make it over the edge without some help," he says.  "I'll stay up here
 and guide it over the edge for you."  He situates himself at the top of
 the ladder as you start to climb down.

 Canal near gate
    Vertical concrete walls line this deep canal.  A chain-link fence
 crosses over the top of the canal above; under the fence, a steel gate
 hangs several feet above the water, allowing passage through a low
 opening under the gate.  To the south, the canal stops at a concrete
 wall perforated by an array of pipes.
    A ladder is set into the west wall.
    The fire hose stretches up the wall of the canal to the top of the
 ladder.

>put hose in rusty
 You shove the fire hose nozzle into the pipe.  You still have to hold
 the hose to keep it from retracting.

>pull lever
 You pull the lever, and water immediately starts gushing through the
 nozzle and into the pipe.  The pipe quickly fills up, and the water
 starts shooting back out.  You release the lever and jump out of the
 way as the water pours out of the pipe.  A deflated silver balloon
 falls out of the pipe, carried by the force of the water.

 [Your score has increased by ten points.]

>take balloon
 Taken.

 A lightning bolt flashes through the sky a short distance to the north.

>examine pump
 It's a small hand-operated pump, probably for inflating basketballs or
 something similar.

>examine balloon
 It's an ordinary balloon, made of shiny silver plastic.  It's currently
 fully deflated.

>go up
 You cautiously climb up the rungs.  It's quite a ways up and you feel a
 little anxious about the height, but you reach the top.

 The fire hose retracts as you go.

    Your boss Mr. Teeterwaller is here.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>se
 You can't get the hose around the bend--there are too many pipes at odd
 angles.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a
 short distance to the west.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>drop hose
 As soon as you let go of the hose, it slides away to the southeast as
 the reel winds the hose back onto the coil.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>se
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Narrow passage
    The pipes are just barely far enough apart here for you to squeeze
 through to the northwest, but this is otherwise a dead end.
    A space between some pipes to the east affords a peephole view of a
 large courtyard.

 "Look!"  Mr. Teeterwaller says, pointing through the opening in the
 pipes.

 Through the opening, you can see several trucks parked in the
 courtyard--the same trucks that you saw hijacked.

 Two people, wearing baggy white whole-body suits with hoods and gas
 masks, emerge from the back of one of the trucks, walking backwards,
 carrying something.  They continue out down a ramp at the back of the
 truck; two more people dressed the same way come into view, also
 helping to carry the object, which you can now see is a large shiny
 silver crate.  Two more people come out of the truck, then another two
 carrying the trailing end of the crate.  The eight slowly make their
 way down the ramp with the obviously heavy cargo.

 You wonder what they could be removing from the trucks that requires
 such elaborate protective clothing.  You look at Teeterwaller.  He's
 watching intently, but, strangely, does not seem surprised by what he's
 seeing.

 Another space-suited worker emerges from the truck, slowly waving a
 wand attached by a cord to a box that makes intermittent ticking
 sounds.

 You feel a chill as you realize that the cargo must be radioactive.

 The group and their load disappear behind the truck, and the clicking
 of the Geiger counter recedes into inaudibility.

 Teeterwaller continues watching for a few moments.  "Interesting," he
 finally says.

 Dead end
    This opening in the pipes is large enough to stand in, but not much
 more.  To the northwest is a low crawl-way, but there are no other
 openings large enough to travel through.  The dense wall of pipes to
 the south is, however, broken in one spot by a six-inch gap.

>examine gap
 The gap is about six inches high and a little wider.  Beyond the gap,
 there appears to be a large open area with a glass floor.

 East end of catwalk
    A catwalk starts at the rounded door to the east (which is open),
 and extends west toward the center of the cylinder of the tower,
 suspended by cables over a churning, bubbling sea of viscous
 yellow-green liquid ten feet below.  A green, misty vapor swirls up
 from the surface of the liquid.

 The rounded metal door swings shut with a dull thud.


>go west

    This is roughly the center of the catwalk, which extends east and
 west.  A pair of cables, suspended from above, are attached to the
 catwalk here to provide support.

>examine cables
 The cables extend to the domed roof of the tower above, and are
 attached to the catwalk here to support its weight.  At the top of the
 cables, you can just make out what looks like an access hatch in the
 roof.

>climb cables
 "I think I'll wait here," Mr. Teeterwaller says nervously.

 You take a deep breath and grasp the cable, giving it a tug to make
 sure it's as firmly attached as it appears to be.  Taking care not to
 look down at the bubbling cauldron of who-knows-what below, you start
 ascending the cable.  It's as hard as you expect, but you manage to
 climb the twenty feet to the roof of the dome.

 Under the roof, on a cable
    The cable is attached to a hook bolted to the roof of the dome.
 Within reach is a round access hatch, currently closed, in the roof of
 the dome.

>open hatch
 It won't budge.

>examine hatch
 It's a round door about two feet in diameter, with a wheel in the
 center.  It's currently closed.

>turn wheel
 You can't seem to turn it with just one hand, and there's no way you
 can let go of the cable with both hands without something to keep you
 from falling.

>wear harness
 Okay, you're now wearing the dog harness.  Tightening the harness
 securely around your chest, you can't help but feel a little silly.

>attach harness to hook
 You slip the harness's ring onto the cable hook.  The hook and harness
 seem easily able to support your weight.

>turn wheel
 You cautiously let go of the cable, letting your weight shift to the
 harness.  The harness easily holds you in place, letting you take hold
 of the wheel.  The wheel is hard to move, but you manage to turn it a
 couple of revolutions clockwise, where it stops.  A hissing sound
 escapes from the door for a few moments, then fades away.

>open door
 Opened.

>go up
 You start to leave, but the harness instantly jerks you to a stop.

>remove harness
 Okay, you're no longer wearing the dog harness.

>go up
 You start to leave, but the harness instantly jerks you to a stop.

>unclip harness
 You slip the ring off the hook

>go up
 You grab onto the edge of the access hatch and pull yourself through
 the opening and out onto the roof of the tower.

 Roof of tower
    This is the apex of the tower dome, which slopes down in all
 directions.  The air is cool and a steady wind flows past the dome.  An
 access hatch is at the top; it's precariously propped up and open, and
 wisps of green vapor drift out.  Handholds set into the roof form a
 ladder down the west side of the dome.
    The industrial wasteland of the plant complex stretches to the
 north, other towers delineated by colored lights twinkling in the
 distance, a vast spiderweb of pipes and conduits below.

 You hear frightened muttering from the hatch.  Mr. Teeterwaller's head
 appears in the opening.  You reach down and help him up onto the roof.

 "Good job getting that hatch open," Teeterwaller tells you.  "That
 never would have occurred to me."

 The precariously-balanced hatch slams shut as you leave.

 You climb down the handholds, following the curved dome as it becomes
 steeper and finally vertical.  The handholds continue down the side of
 the tower to a landing.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, four stories up
    The stairs reach their summit at this landing, which, unlike all of
 the other landings, is on the west side of the tower.  Handholds set
 into the tower wall at regular intervals form a ladder up the side of
 the tower.
    A closed rounded metal door is set into the tower wall.  In the
 center of the door is a wheel.

>go down
 You follow the stairs halfway around the tower to the next landing.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, three stories up
    This landing is about three stories above the ground, on the east
 side of the tower.  The stairs continue wrapping around the tower,
 allowing you to travel up or down.
    You see a yellow hard-hat and a white hard-hat here.

>get hats
 yellow hard-hat:  Mr. Teeterwaller picks up the white hard-hat.  "Good
 idea," he says.  "This could come in handy."

 Taken.
 white hard-hat:  Mr. Teeterwaller is carrying the white hard-hat and
 won't let you have it.

 Mr. Teeterwaller starts telling you some office gossip, but stops, a
 little disappointed, when he realizes you don't know the people
 involved in the embarrassing parts.

>go down
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, one story up
    This landing is about one story above the ground, on the east side
 of the tower.  The stairs continue up and down.

>go down
 As the stairway winds around to the west side of the tower, it passes
 through an opening in the grating surrounding the tower and descends
 into the shaft below.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Underground, in shaft
    Concrete walls line this cylindrical shaft surrounding the tower.
 The stairs end their descent here, about a story beneath the surface,
 but the shaft continues far below.  A metal grating completely covers
 the shaft at the bottom of the stairs, providing a floor.
    A narrow opening in the wall of the shaft leads west.

>go west
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Narrow passage
    This low, narrow tunnel was probably never intended as a walkway;
 it's more like a ventilation shaft than a corridor.  The tunnel becomes
 an aluminum duct to the west, and several small vents connect through
 the north and south walls. The passage opens into a larger area to the
 east.

>examine vents
 The vents are circular and vary in size from a few inches to a foot in
 diameter.

>go west
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Air duct
    This aluminum air duct is just large enough to crawl through here,
 but splits into several smaller ducts to the west, none of which are
 large enough to permit further passage.  The duct widens to the east.
 A vent cover, two feet on a side, is over an opening in the floor.

>examine ducts
 There are six smaller ducts, all too small to enter.

>open cover
 You swing the vent cover down and out, leaving the opening uncovered.

 You hear some voices from the room below, but you can't make out what
 they're saying.

>listen to voices
 I don't know the word "listen".

>SAVE
>cf19
 Saved.

>wear hat
 (the yellow hard-hat)
 Okay, you're now wearing the yellow hard-hat.

 Mr. Teeterwaller puts his hard-hat on as well.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

 Several workers wearing isolation suits and gas masks, together
 carrying a large silver crate the size of a refrigerator, walk into
 view in the room below.  They put the crate on the floor.

>examine crate
 The crate is made of a very shiny silver metal.  It's about the size of
 a refrigerator sitting on its back.

 One of the workers visible below walks slowly around the silver crate,
 scanning the crate with a hand-held device.  He makes two circuits of
 the crate, then clips the device to his belt and takes off his mask.
 After a few moments, the other workers all remove their masks as well.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

 Through the opening in the floor, you see the workers file out of the
 room to the south.

>go down
 The floor is a hundred feet below.

>look u
 I don't understand that sentence.

>inventory
 You have your temporary ID card, a map, a garage opener, a jacket, a
 Project Tyche manual, a DUFON journal, a flashlight (providing light),
 a Blottnian textbook, a hand pump, a dog harness, a portable hand-held
 scanner, a looseleaf page, a deck of punched cards, a newer gas mask
 (being worn), a silver balloon, and a yellow hard-hat (being worn).
 The garage opener compartment seems to contain a battery.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>inflate balloon
 (with your lips)
 You'd have a hard time fitting the balloon under your gas mask.  If you
 want to inflate the balloon with the pump, though, just say so.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>inflate balloon with pump
 You put the hand pump into the balloon's opening and pump up the
 balloon, expanding the silver plastic into an oblong ball.  Once the
 balloon is inflated, you tie a knot in the opening to keep the air from
 escaping.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>examine balloon
 It's an ordinary balloon, made of shiny silver plastic.  It's currently
 fully inflated, and the opening is knotted to keep the air from
 escaping.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>attach harness to balloon
 You see no way to do that.

>jump
 Wheeee!

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>go down
 The floor is a hundred feet below.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>deflate balloon
 You carefully untie the knot and let the air escape.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Narrow passage
    This low, narrow tunnel was probably never intended as a walkway;
 it's more like a ventilation shaft than a corridor.  The tunnel becomes
 an aluminum duct to the west, and several small vents connect through
 the north and south walls. The passage opens into a larger area to the
 east.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Underground, in shaft
    Concrete walls line this cylindrical shaft surrounding the tower.
 The stairs end their descent here, about a story beneath the surface,
 but the shaft continues far below.  A metal grating completely covers
 the shaft at the bottom of the stairs, providing a floor.
    A narrow opening in the wall of the shaft leads west.

>go up
 Following the stairs around the tower, you cross through an opening in
 the grating and emerge into the night air.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, one story up
    This landing is about one story above the ground, on the east side
 of the tower.  The stairs continue up and down.

 Lightning flashes across the sky directly above.

>go up
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, three stories up
    This landing is about three stories above the ground, on the east
 side of the tower.  The stairs continue wrapping around the tower,
 allowing you to travel up or down.

>go up
 The stairs only make half a turn around the tower before you encounter
 another landing, this time on the west side of the tower.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, four stories up
    The stairs reach their summit at this landing, which, unlike all of
 the other landings, is on the west side of the tower.  Handholds set
 into the tower wall at regular intervals form a ladder up the side of
 the tower.
    A closed rounded metal door is set into the tower wall.  In the
 center of the door is a wheel.

>turn wheel
 The wheel is hard to move, but you manage to turn it a couple of
 revolutions clockwise, where it stops.  A hissing sound escapes from
 the door for a few moments, then fades away.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>open door
 Opened.

 Wisps of viscous green vapor waft slowly out from the door.
 Fortunately, the gas mask seems to be protecting you from the gas.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a
 short distance to the west.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 West end of catwalk
    The catwalk reaches the west wall of the tower here, and extends
 into the center of the tower to the east.  A door is set into the west
 wall; it's currently open.

 The rounded metal door swings shut with a dull thud.


>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Center of catwalk
    This is roughly the center of the catwalk, which extends east and
 west.  A pair of cables, suspended from above, are attached to the
 catwalk here to provide support.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 East end of catwalk
    A catwalk starts at the rounded door to the east (which is closed),
 and extends west toward the center of the cylinder of the tower,
 suspended by cables over a churning, bubbling sea of viscous
 yellow-green liquid ten feet below.  A green, misty vapor swirls up
 from the surface of the liquid.

>go east
 (Opening the rounded metal door)
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, four stories up
    The stairs end at this landing, and go no further up.  This landing
 is nearly at the top of the tower, around four stories above the
 ground, and on the east side of the tower.
    An open rounded metal door is set into the tower wall to the west; a
 viscous green vapor wafts out of the door.  A large wheel is in the
 center of the door.

 A lightning bolt rips through the sky nearby to the east.

>go down
 As you start down the stairs, you notice that the door swings shut.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, two stories up
    A short landing, about two stories above the ground on the east side
 of the tower, interrupts the steady spiral of the stairs, which
 continue up and down.  The canal is visible in the distance below, and
 the tower looms overhead.

>go down
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Bank of canal
    A deep, concrete-lined canal is to the east; metal rungs are set
 into the wall, forming a ladder down into the canal.  A tall fence
 topped with razor wire is to the north.
    Pipes and conduits are everywhere, packed so tightly together that
 they form walls.  Narrow openings in the pipes allow travel to the
 southeast and southwest.  To the west, a cylindrical tower rises up out
 of the pipes and looms several stories overhead; a spiral stairway
 encircling the tower leads up.  The ground is replaced by a metal
 grating for the ten feet around the tower.

 Lightning flashes across the sky directly above.

>go southwest
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Safety station
    The forest of pipes opens up a little here into a large clear area.
 In the center of the clearing stands a tall metal enclosure topped with
 a brightly-lit red sign:

      SAFETY STATION

 An opening in the pipes leads northeast, and another passage leads
 south.  You may also be able to squeeze through a narrow crawl-way to
 the southeast.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a
 short distance to the west.

>go south
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 North edge of glass
    The ground to the south is covered with a huge array of glass
 panels, stretching hundreds of feet to the south and as far to the
 east.  The pipes that are everywhere in this compound bend around the
 sea of glass leaving the area above open to the sky; white cylindrical
 towers rising up above the pipes are scattered around the perimeter of
 the glass.  A passage through the pipes opens to the north, and the
 pipes leave enough space for a walkway southwest along the edge of the
 glass.
    A metal cage, suspended a few inches off the ground by a cable
 hanging from a beam overhead, is just this side of the glass.

>go southwest
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 West edge of glass
    This is a narrow walkway along the west edge of an array of glass
 panels covering the ground to the east.  A wall of pipes parallels the
 edge of the glass a few feet back from the edge, blocking travel except
 to the northeast.  Midway along the wall of pipes is an elevator door.

>examine door
 The elevator has a sliding metal door, which is closed, and a round
 button just to the right of the door.

>press button
 (the elevator button)
 Nothing happens.

 Lightning flashes across the sky directly above.

 Teeterwaller looks through his pockets for something.

>examine pipes
 The pipes are broken here only by a passage to the northeast and by the
 elevator to the west.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a
 short distance to the west.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>open door
 The door is controlled automatically by the elevator; you can't open it
 manually.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

 In the cage
    The cage is a simple framework of poles connected to a metal floor.
 Attached to one of the poles, about midway up, is a pair of levers.  A

 into its new location.

 A lightning bolt rips through the sky nearby to the east.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

 North edge of glass
    The ground to the south is covered with a huge array of glass
 panels, stretching hundreds of feet to the south and as far to the
 east.  The pipes that are everywhere in this compound bend around the
 sea of glass leaving the area above open to the sky; white cylindrical
 towers rising up above the pipes are scattered around the perimeter of
 the glass.  A passage through the pipes opens to the north, and the
 pipes leave enough space for a walkway southwest along the edge of the
 glass.
    A metal cage, suspended a few inches off the ground by a cable
 hanging from a beam overhead, is just this side of the glass.
    About fifty feet to the east, you can see the nozzle of the fire
 hose sticking out through the pipes.

>go north
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Safety station
    The forest of pipes opens up a little here into a large clear area.
 In the center of the clearing stands a tall metal enclosure topped with
 a brightly-lit red sign:

      SAFETY STATION

 An opening in the pipes leads northeast, and another passage leads
 south.  You may also be able to squeeze through a narrow crawl-way to
 the southeast.
    A fire hose stretches out of the enclosure and through the crawl-way
 to the southeast.

>turn wheel
 You turn the wheel counterclockwise until it stops.  You can hear water
 rush through the valve for a few moments as the hose pressurizes.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>in
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 In the cage
    The cage is a simple framework of poles connected to a metal floor.
 Attached to one of the poles, about midway up, is a pair of levers.  A
 few inches above the levers, a yellow note is taped to the pole.
    The cage is above solid ground, at the north edge of the glass, and
 about ten feet from the west edge.
    The nozzle of the fire hose is sticking through a gap in the pipes
 about fifty feet east of the cage.

>push left
 With a lurch, the cage starts moving to the east.  The cage travels
 about twenty-five feet, then stops, leaving it about thirty-five feet
 east of the west edge of the glass.  You release the lever, and a
 spring returns it to the upright position; after a few wide swings, the
 cage gradually settles into its new location.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a

 You manage to hold on to the fire hose, which drags along the ground as
 the cage moves.

 You manage to hold on to the fire hose, which drags along the ground as

>examine glass
 The glass looks like a giant window set into the ground, roughly square
 and a hundred feet on a side.  It looks as though a huge chamber is
 below the glass.

 The glass pane directly outside the cage is different from all of the
 others; it has a handle and hinges, and can clearly be opened.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>open glass
 You carefully lean out, grasp the handle, and give it a good pull.  The
 cage sways slightly as you pull.  The glass sticks for a moment, but
 then pops free, and you tilt up the panel until it's sitting straight
 up, where it locks into position.

>go down
 You can't walk on the glass, since it wouldn't support your weight, and
 you can't enter the hatch, since the floor is a hundred feet below.

 A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes the ground a
 short distance to the west.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>put hose in glass
 You feed the fire hose down through the opening, gradually pulling hose
 off the reel in the distance.  The weight of the hose hanging down into
 the opening eventually starts doing most of the work of pulling more
 down.  Finally, after a tremendous length of hose has disappeared into
 the chamber below, the hose seems to reach the floor.

 You carefully let go of the hose, letting it drape over the edge of the
 opening.

>go down
 If you want to climb down the hose, just say so.

 Lightning flashes across the sky directly above.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>climb down hose
 You have a sudden chill looking at the hose disappearing into the
 darkness below.

 Teeterwaller gulps.  "B-b-b-be careful," he stutters.  "I'll wait here
 until you reach the bottom, to make sure we don't put too much weight
 on the hose."

 Slowly, you maneuver yourself over to the edge nearest the opening, and
 lean out of the cage, holding on to the pole with both hands.  It's
 only a foot or two to the hose, but somehow it feels like you're about
 to try jumping over a canyon.

 You realize you've been holding your breath, and force yourself to
 exhale.  You jerk one hand out and grab at the hose, slipping at first
 but finally getting a good grip on it.  You carefully swing one leg out
 onto the framework supporting the windows, then the other, taking care
 not to put any weight on the glass.

 With nothing left to do, you let go of the cage with your other hand
 and grab at the hose.  The framework is obviously sturdy enough to
 support you if it can support all of this glass, you keep telling
 yourself, but you can feel it flexing under you.

 Having successfully negotiated the chasm between the cage and the hose,
 you feel much less panicked, and start descending the hose.  It's a
 nice rough material and easy to grip as you climb down.

 The descent takes less time than you would have thought, given the
 amount of hose you had to feed down through the hatch.  You reach the
 floor, and rest a moment to let the adrenaline wear off.

 Atrium
    The polished marble walls of this vast chamber slant slightly inward
 as they rise hundreds of feet to the glass panes of the ceiling.
 Lights from the towers above the surface twinkle like Christmas tree
 decorations through the glass.  An elevator is to the west, and
 passages lead north and southeast.
    A fire hose hangs down from the ceiling, the end of the hose just
 reaching the floor.

 After a few minutes, Mr. Teeterwaller comes sliding down the hose at
 high speed, and crashes into the floor.  He collects himself off the
 floor and spends a few moments brushing off dust.

 "What a novel idea," Teeterwaller tells you.  "I wondered what you were
 thinking, dragging that hose everywhere."

 [Your score has increased by ten points.]

>SAVE
>cf20
 Saved.

>climb up hose
 Climbing hundreds of feet up a fire hose might seem like a daunting
 task to some people.  It's a good thing you've been working out.

 "I'll follow you after you get to the top," Teeterwaller says.

 You laboriously climb the hose.  It seems a lot further going up than
 it did coming down.

 You reach the top and are relieved to find the cage parked next to the
 opening in the glass.  You grab a pole and drag yourself onto the
 platform.

 In the cage
    The cage is a simple framework of poles connected to a metal floor.
 Attached to one of the poles, about midway up, is a pair of levers.  A
 few inches above the levers, a yellow note is taped to the pole.
    The cage is hanging over the glass, about fifty feet from the north
 edge, and about sixty feet from the west edge.
    The glass pane roughly in the center of the glass has been tilted
 up, creating an opening in the glass.  A fire hose stretches between a
 gap in the pipes to the north and the open panel.

 After a few minutes, Mr. Teeterwaller comes climbing up the hose,
 panting and exhausted.  You help him into the cage.

 Construction area
    This wide hallway is filled with dust and debris from a construction
 project.  A foreman is looking at a blueprint, and several construction
 workers are demolishing parts of the hallway.  The hallway opens to the
 south, and continues north past the contruction.

>go north
 The foreman waves you by.  You carefully navigate through the
 construction debris, following the hallway as it turns a corner and
 continues west.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Hallway
    This is the west end of a wide east-west hallway.  A sliding metal
 door, labeled "Lab 7," leads north, and a white door, labeled
 "Observation Room," leads west.

>go north
 You'll have to open the sliding metal door first.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>open white door
 Opened.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>go west
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Observation room
    The lighting in this room is muted, presumably to reduce glare on
 the window that covers the north wall.  On the other side of the window
 is a huge chamber, a hundred feet high and twice as wide; pieces of
 electronic equipment are scattered throughout the area, and a workbench
 is in the center of the room.  Near the workbench is a silver crate the
 size of a refrigerator lying on its back.  A woman, whom you take to be
 a scientist because of her white lab coat, and a technician, wearing a
 blue jump-suit, are working with the equipment.  A white door leads
 east.

 Through the glass, you see the scientist walk to the silver crate.  She
 does something you can't see to the side of the crate, and the top
 slowly swings open.  The woman reaches inside and removes a black disk,
 about the size of a half-dollar coin.  She holds it up and looks at it,
 then closes the crate's lid.

>examine crate
 The crate is made of a very shiny silver metal.  It's about the size of
 a refrigerator sitting on its back.

 Through the glass, you see the scientist walk to the workbench near the
 center of the room and carefully place the black disk on a stand on the
 workbench.  The technician pulls a cart carrying an electronic device
 over to the workbench, and attaches a pair of electrodes from the
 device to the stand, on opposite sides of the disk.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

 A woman's voice issues from a hidden speaker; you realize it's the
 scientist in the lab, talking to the technician.  "Okay, we'll start at
 low voltages and work our way up.  Ready?"

 The technician carries a hand-held meter to the lab bench, points it at
 the stand, and nods to the scientist.

 "Here we go, then.  One percent."  She makes some adjustments to the
 electronic device.  You can't be sure, but it looks like the disk glows
 faintly for a moment.

 "Negative point zero zero three gee," the technician says.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The scientist's voice is audible through a hidden speaker:  "Two
 percent."  She adjusts the electronic device, and you again see a
 faint, momentary glow from the disk.

 "Negative point zero one gee," the technician says.

>wait
 Time passes...

 "Five percent," the scientist says.  She adjusts the electronic device,
 and you see a clear blue glow from the disk; the glow fades after a few
 moments.

 "Negative point zero eight gee," the technician says.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

 You hear a warbling sound through the hidden speakers.  The scientist
 reaches into the pocket of her lab coat and takes out a cellular phone.
 "Yes?"  She listens to the phone.  "Affirmative.  We've just started,
 but the anti-gravity effect is confirmed."  She listens some more.  "I
 understand.  We're on our way."

 She turns to the technician.  "They're ready to start the omicron beam
 again and they need us to monitor the scattering.  Leave everything set
 up here and we'll resume this when we're done with the beam test."

 The two walk briskly to the door and leave the lab.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Hallway
    This is the west end of a wide east-west hallway.  A sliding metal
 door, labeled "Lab 7," leads north, and a white door, labeled
 "Observation Room," leads west.

>examine sliding door
 The door is closed and is labeled "LAB 7--RESTRICTED."  A small slot,
 about the right size to accept a credit card, is next to the door.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>put id in slot
 You slip your ID card into the slot; it's a good fit, but nothing seems
 to happen, so you pull it back out.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

 floor, the wire-caged light fixtures all give this corridor an antique
 appearance.  A large room lies to the northwest, and silvery doors lie
 to the east, west, and south; the door to the south is labeled
 "MAINTENANCE," and the door to the east is marked "RECORDS."

>go northwest
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Atrium
    The polished marble walls of this vast chamber slant slightly inward
 as they rise hundreds of feet to the glass panes of the ceiling.
 Lights from the towers above the surface twinkle like Christmas tree
 decorations through the glass.  An elevator is to the west, and
 passages lead north and southeast.
    A fire hose hangs down from the ceiling, the end of the hose just
 reaching the floor.

 Elevator
    This elevator has a sliding door to the east, next to which is a
 control panel, with buttons labeled UPPER LEVEL, LOWER LEVEL, DOOR
 OPEN, and DOOR CLOSE, plus a red knob labeled PUSH TO RUN/PULL TO STOP.
 The knob is currently pushed in.  The door is open.

 West edge of glass
    This is a narrow walkway along the west edge of an array of glass
 panels covering the ground to the east.  A wall of pipes parallels the
 edge of the glass a few feet back from the edge, blocking travel except
 to the northeast.  Midway along the wall of pipes is an elevator door.

 A lightning bolt rips through the sky nearby to the east.

>go northeast
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 North edge of glass
    The ground to the south is covered with a huge array of glass
 panels, stretching hundreds of feet to the south and as far to the
 east.  The pipes that are everywhere in this compound bend around the
 sea of glass leaving the area above open to the sky; white cylindrical
 towers rising up above the pipes are scattered around the perimeter of
 the glass.  A passage through the pipes opens to the north, and the
 pipes leave enough space for a walkway southwest along the edge of the
 glass.
    A metal cage, suspended a few inches off the ground by a cable
 hanging from a beam overhead, is just this side of the glass.
    Roughly in the center of the glass, one of the panes has been tilted
 up, creating an opening in the glass.
    A fire hose is sticking through the pipes about fifty feet to the
 east; the hose stretches across the glass and disappears down through
 the access hatch.

>go north
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Safety station
    The forest of pipes opens up a little here into a large clear area.
 In the center of the clearing stands a tall metal enclosure topped with
 a brightly-lit red sign:

      SAFETY STATION

 An opening in the pipes leads northeast, and another passage leads
 south.  You may also be able to squeeze through a narrow crawl-way to
 the southeast.
    A fire hose stretches out of the enclosure and through the crawl-way
 to the southeast.

>go northeast
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Bank of canal
    A deep, concrete-lined canal is to the east; metal rungs are set
 into the wall, forming a ladder down into the canal.  A tall fence
 topped with razor wire is to the north.
    Pipes and conduits are everywhere, packed so tightly together that
 they form walls.  Narrow openings in the pipes allow travel to the
 southeast and southwest.  To the west, a cylindrical tower rises up out
 of the pipes and looms several stories overhead; a spiral stairway
 encircling the tower leads up.  The ground is replaced by a metal
 grating for the ten feet around the tower.

>go up
 You cross the grating, and climb the gentle slope of the stairway
 through one revolution around the tower.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, two stories up
    A short landing, about two stories above the ground on the east side
 of the tower, interrupts the steady spiral of the stairs, which
 continue up and down.  The canal is visible in the distance below, and
 the tower looms overhead.

>go up
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, four stories up
    The stairs end at this landing, and go no further up.  This landing
 is nearly at the top of the tower, around four stories above the
 ground, and on the east side of the tower.
    A closed rounded metal door is set into the tower wall to the west.
 A large wheel is in the center of the door.

>inventory
 You have your temporary ID card, a map, a garage opener, a jacket, a
 Project Tyche manual, a DUFON journal, a flashlight (providing light),
 a Blottnian textbook, a hand pump, a dog harness, a portable hand-held
 scanner, a looseleaf page, a deck of punched cards, a newer gas mask
 (being worn), a yellow hard-hat (being worn), and a silver balloon.
 The garage opener compartment seems to contain a battery.

>open door
 Opened.

 Wisps of viscous green vapor waft slowly out from the door.
 Fortunately, the gas mask seems to be protecting you from the gas.

 Teeterwaller looks around purposefully.

>go west
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 East end of catwalk
    A catwalk starts at the rounded door to the east (which is open),
 and extends west toward the center of the cylinder of the tower,
 suspended by cables over a churning, bubbling sea of viscous
 yellow-green liquid ten feet below.  A green, misty vapor swirls up
 from the surface of the liquid.

 The rounded metal door swings shut with a dull thud.


>fill balloon with pump
 I don't know the word "fill".

>pump balloon
 It's already as inflated as it can be.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>deflate balloon
 You carefully untie the knot and let the air escape.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>pump balloon
 (with your lips)
 You'd have a hard time fitting the balloon under your gas mask.  If you
 want to inflate the balloon with the pump, though, just say so.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>inflate balloon with pump
 You put the hand pump into the balloon's opening and pump up the
 balloon, filling the balloon with the toxic green gas.  Once the
 balloon is inflated, you tie a knot in the opening to keep the fumes
 from escaping.

>go east

 You can't go that way.

 A lightning bolt flashes through the sky a short distance to the north.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>enter cage
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 In the cage
    The cage is a simple framework of poles connected to a metal floor.
 Attached to one of the poles, about midway up, is a pair of levers.  A
 few inches above the levers, a yellow note is taped to the pole.
    The cage is above solid ground, at the north edge of the glass, and
 about ten feet from the west edge.
    The glass pane roughly in the center of the glass has been tilted
 up, creating an opening in the glass.  A fire hose stretches between a
 gap in the pipes to the north and the open panel.

 A lightning bolt rips through the sky nearby to the east.

>push left
 With a lurch, the cage starts moving to the east.  The cage travels
 about twenty-five feet, then stops, leaving it about thirty-five feet
 east of the west edge of the glass.  You release the lever, and a
 spring returns it to the upright position; after a few wide swings, the
 cage gradually settles into its new location.

 Mr. Teeterwaller seems to be lost in thought.

>examine glass
 The glass looks like a giant window set into the ground, roughly square
 and a hundred feet on a side.  It looks as though a huge chamber is
 below the glass.

 A glass panel about fifty feet south of here is tilted up, creating an
 opening. A fire hose, stretching from a gap in the pipes to the north,
 hangs down through the opening.

>climb down hose
 The cage must be closer to the opening for you to climb down the hose.

>push right
 With a lurch, the cage starts moving to the south.  The cage travels
 about twenty-five feet, then stops, leaving it hanging over the glass,
 about twenty-five feet south of the north edge, and sixty feet east of
 the west edge. You release the lever, and a spring returns it to the
 upright position; after a few wide swings, the cage gradually settles

>climb down hose
 You carefully maneuver yourself over to the hose, and start lowering
 yourself down its length.  You reach the floor after a brief descent.

 Atrium
    The polished marble walls of this vast chamber slant slightly inward
 as they rise hundreds of feet to the glass panes of the ceiling.
 Lights from the towers above the surface twinkle like Christmas tree
 decorations through the glass.  An elevator is to the west, and
 passages lead north and southeast.
    A fire hose hangs down from the ceiling, the end of the hose just
 reaching the floor.

 After a few minutes, Mr. Teeterwaller comes sliding down the hose at
 high speed, and crashes into the floor.  He collects himself off the
 floor and spends a few moments brushing off dust.

 Maintenance room
    This is a small, musty-smelling room whose only exit is the door to
 the north.  A cabinet occupies one wall.  Opposite the cabinet is a
 large air vent, below which is a lever.

>examine lever
 The lever is mounted below the vent, and moves left and right.  The
 left end is labeled "Outside," and the right end is labeled "Recycled."
 The lever is currently at the right limit of its travel.

 Mr. Teeterwaller watches you expectantly.

>deflate balloon
 You carefully untie the knot, allowing the green gas to escape.  Your
 gas mask protects you as the toxic vapors swirl around you.  The green
 gas is quickly drawn into the vent; a few moments later, from the hall,
 you hear loud coughing and yelling.  Down the hall, one of the doors
 bursts open, and two men and a woman run out into the hall, holding
 their hands over their mouths.  They run off down the hall.

 Records room
    This long, narrow chamber might better be called a corridor than a
 room.  The north and south walls are lined with file drawers from floor
 to ceiling; there must be thousands of drawers.  A door lies to the
 west; a small vent is over the door.
    You see a briefcase and a red ID card here.

 Teeterwaller has a look of awe on his face.  "This is amazing," he
 says.  "I never thought they'd just file everything away like this."
 He picks up the briefcase.  "This is perfect."

 He starts opening drawers and going through files.

 Teeterwaller looks through a drawer, pulling a couple of files and
 looking them over.  "This is astonishing," he says.  "I've been looking
 for this type of information for years, but all I've ever been able to
 find is the vaguest of hints, just bits and pieces.  This is everything
 I've been looking for, all in one place."

>ask teeterwaller about files
 "I've been trying to find this sort of information for years, but all
 I've been able to find before are bits and pieces."

 Teeterwaller looks through a drawer, pulling a couple of files and
 looking them over.  "This is it!  Look!"  he says excitedly, showing
 you the file.  It's marked "Omegatron Corp. (Project `Tyche')" and is
 dated in 1970.  He flips through the file for you; it contains
 electronic diagrams and technical data, none of which makes sense to
 you but clearly is important to Teeterwaller.

 "I don't know if I ever told you about Project Tyche," he says.  "I
 worked on it around twenty-five years ago.  We were building an
 embedded controller system for some industrial equipment.  Part of the
 project involved these logic chips that seemed almost magical at the
 time.  They were far ahead of anything we'd seen.  I started wondering
 about them recently, so I asked our corporate archives people for a
 copy of the specification document for the project.  I got the spec,
 but the parts about the logic chips were missing.  Well, this is the
 missing section.  Plus, it has information about how these people," he
 looks around the room at the file drawers, "whoever it is who's keeping
 these records, planted this information with our project."

>ask teeterwaller about car
 "It's always been very reliable," he says defensively.  "I know people
 make all sorts of jokes about what a terrible car it is, but I've had
 very good luck with it."

 You pick a drawer at random and open it.  The drawer is loaded with
 files; you choose one with a typewritten label reading "Microprocessor
 Transfer Study" and look through it.

 The rapid pace of transfers over the past five years has clearly
 strained several absorption factors and is not producing the benefits
 that accrued in prior stages.  The original recipients bear partial
 responsibility through their dubious practices, but fundamentally we
 have simply transferred technology too rapidly.  The schedule
 adjustments we have initiated should stabilize the market within two
 years and restore full profitability.

 Teeterwaller snatches the file.  "This one looks important," he says as
 he stuffs the file into his briefcase.

 Darkness suddenly falls over the room as all of the lights go out; a

 You suddenly feel like you're tumbling sideways, and it feels like
 something is pulling your feet and your head in opposite directions.
 You reach out for something to hold, but find nothing in reach.

 Just as you think you're going to hit the ground, you realize that the
 floor is twenty feet away and getting further.  You're falling, but
 somehow you're falling toward the ceiling.  The room is spinning
 rapidly, and you see that Mr. Teeterwaller is falling alongside you,
 his eyes closed and his arms flailing wildly; beside him the
 brightly-glowing disk is serenly floating in mid-air.

 You keep falling upwards for several seconds, moving directly toward a
 large air vent on the ceiling.  You draw closer and closer to the vent,
 and you brace yourself for impact.  In a moment the vent is only a few
 feet away, but now you can see that you're not moving very quickly
 after all, and you easily maneuver yourself into the opening.

 Teeterwaller crashes into the ceiling just outside the vent, but you
 manage to grab his arm and help him through the opening.

 You find yourself in a large air duct.  The disk floats up through the
 opening; its glow gradually fades, and as it does, you, Teeterwaller,
 and the disk settle to the floor of the duct.  Gravity returns to
 normal.

 Air duct
    This aluminum air duct is just large enough to crawl through here,
 but splits into several smaller ducts to the west, none of which are
 large enough to permit further passage.  The duct widens to the east.
 In the floor is a square opening, two feet on a side, whose cover has
 been swung out and down; a cavernous chamber below is visible through
 the opening.
    You see a black disk here.

 Through the opening, you see the door to the lab slide open, and dozens
 of guards rush into the lab, looking up at you from the floor far
 below.

 [Your score has increased by ten points.]

>get disk
 Taken.

 Through the opening, you see the guards in the lab watching you.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>take disk
 You already have the black disk!

 The guards in the lab rush around busily, several keeping a close watch
 on you.

 Mr. Teeterwaller mumbles something to himself.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Narrow passage
    This low, narrow tunnel was probably never intended as a walkway;
 it's more like a ventilation shaft than a corridor.  The tunnel becomes
 an aluminum duct to the west, and several small vents connect through
 the north and south walls. The passage opens into a larger area to the
 east.

>go east
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Underground, in shaft
    Concrete walls line this cylindrical shaft surrounding the tower.
 The stairs end their descent here, about a story beneath the surface,
 but the shaft continues far below.  A metal grating completely covers
 the shaft at the bottom of the stairs, providing a floor.
    A narrow opening in the wall of the shaft leads west.

>go up
 Following the stairs around the tower, you cross through an opening in
 the grating and emerge into the night air.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, one story up
    This landing is about one story above the ground, on the east side
 of the tower.  The stairs continue up and down.
    Several guards are watching you through the grating of the landing
 one level up.

 The guards watch you through the stairs.

>examine guards
 The guards are watching you through the grating of the stairs.

 The guards watch you through the stairs.

 Mr. Teeterwaller looks around.

>go up
 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, three stories up
    This landing is about three stories above the ground, on the east
 side of the tower.  The stairs continue wrapping around the tower,
 allowing you to travel up or down.
    Several guards are watching you through the grating of the landings
 above and below.

 The guards watch you through the stairs.

>go up
 The stairs only make half a turn around the tower before you encounter
 another landing, this time on the west side of the tower.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Landing, four stories up
    The stairs reach their summit at this landing, which, unlike all of
 the other landings, is on the west side of the tower.  Handholds set
 into the tower wall at regular intervals form a ladder up the side of
 the tower.
    A closed rounded metal door is set into the tower wall.  In the
 center of the door is a wheel.

>go up
 As you start up the ladder, the door bursts open and guards start
 pouring out onto the landing.  You climb the ladder as quickly as you
 can.

 Mr. Teeterwaller comes with you.

 Roof of tower
    This is the apex of the tower dome, which slopes down in all
 directions.  The air is cool and a steady wind flows past the dome.  An
 access hatch is at the top; it's closed.  Handholds set into the roof
 form a ladder down the west side of the dome.
    The industrial wasteland of the plant complex stretches to the
 north, other towers delineated by colored lights twinkling in the
 distance, a vast spiderweb of pipes and conduits below.

 Guards take up positions at the top of the stairs below the dome, but
 for some reason do not follow you up the ladder.

>open hatch
 Opened.

 Wisps of viscous green vapor waft slowly out from the door.
 Fortunately, the gas mask seems to be protecting you from the gas.

 Someone starts climbing the ladder from below.  For a moment you think
 it's one of the guards, but as the figure draws closer, you see that
 it's a tall, gray-haired man in a business suit.  He reaches the top of
 the ladder and walks toward you and Teeterwaller, his hands open,
 presumably to show he's not carrying a weapon.  His jacket flaps in the
 breeze; he reaches down to button it.

 "When I was a boy," the man says in a deep, gravelly voice, "my family
 lived in a small town in Arizona.  One day I rode my bike out into the
 desert, as I often did, in search of dinosaur fossils or Indian relics.
 After several hours I was still empty-handed and had mostly forgotten
 what I had set out to find anyway, so with the sun nearing the horizon
 I started heading home, when a glint in the eastern sky caught my eye."

>examine man
 He's a tall, athletic-looking man with gray hair.  His dark business
 suit is fluttering in the strong wind.

 The gray-haired man continues.  "I watched as the glint turned into a
 streak, and the streak turned into a fireball, all in the course of a
 few heartbeats.  The sight transfixed me and I barely recognized that I
 was directly in the path of whatever was falling from the sky, but some
 instinct made me dive under a nearby boulder, only an instant before
 the ground shattered from the impact.  I hid under my rock as debris
 rained down."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The man continues speaking to you.  "My fear soon turned to curiosity
 and before long I made my way to the crash site.  I expected a
 meteorite, which I pictured as some kind of red glowing sphere with
 miniature moon craters.  What I found was obviously not a meteorite,
 not even anything natural.  But it wasn't anything man-made either.  It
 was the size of a small airplane, but had no wings; its shape was
 complex and irregular; and it was made of a dull gray material that
 looked like wet clay."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "The wreckage was in a few large pieces, but some small bits were
 scattered around, and I pocketed a few as souvenirs.  I was about to
 start looking at the larger pieces, when a group of airplanes came over
 the horizon and made for the crash site.  Something made me return to
 my bicycle and pedal away as fast as I could.  I took refuge behind
 some rocks up a hill half a mile away and watched as the planes
 disgorged men and machines by parachute."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "I stayed for some time watching the men load the pieces of the fallen
 object onto trucks.  Nightfall forced me to abandon my hideout and go
 home, and when I returned the next day I could find nothing left of the
 crash; the crater had been filled and even the fragments of rock
 scattered hundreds of yards away had been swept into the sand."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "I spent years looking at the fragments I had kept from the crash
 without recognizing their true nature.  A series of chance discoveries,
 however, led me to realize that the object that crashed was not some
 experimental military craft, as I had long imagined, and that indeed it
 was not even of this Earth."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "My souvenirs were in fact products of a highly advanced technology,
 far beyond what was thought possible when I found them and beyond even
 what is commonly believed possible today, and having discovered a few
 of their secrets I quickly learned more.  I realized at once the
 commercial potential of my discoveries and set about finding practical
 applications.  You see around you here a small facet of the enterprise
 that we have built, dedicated to the steady improvement of our society
 and the world through the carefully controlled introduction of this
 technology."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "I did not know until many years after the crash the fate of the rest
 of the object.  As our company grew, we began to have the resources
 necessary to cultivate relationships inside the government, and we
 eventually learned where the pieces recovered from the crash were being
 studied.  We have monitored the progress of the government's studies
 carefully, and it has been a source of constant frustration for us that
 these studies have not only been almost completely unproductive, but
 what little they have gleaned has been hidden behind a veil of military
 secrecy and national security."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "We have for many years known that the government is incapable of
 putting this technology to proper use, and that we must take control of
 it for the good of mankind.  Unfortunately, even our resources have
 proven insufficient to correct this problem, at least until now.  When
 we learned that the crash artifacts were to be relocated to a new
 facility, we saw our chance to intervene, taking what is rightfully and
 morally ours."

 A lightning bolt strikes one of the nearby towers.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Teeterwaller, who up to now has been silently listening to the
 gray-haired man, speaks to him.  "`Rightfully and morally' yours," he
 scoffs.  "You're just as bad as the government, hiding this technology
 for decades.  You're worse, in fact, the way you dole it out a little
 at a time to maximize your profit at everyone else's expense."

 The gray-haired man shakes his head slightly.  "Profit isn't our
 motive," he says.  "It is society's readiness to absorb change that
 dictates the rate of our disclosures.  If we were to reveal all we knew
 at one time, the world would plunge into chaos."

 "You'll never get away with this," Teeterwaller says.  "You actually
 think the government won't figure out who stole the artifacts?"

 "The government will never even suspect they were taken," the
 gray-haired man responds dismissively.  "We replaced the originals with
 inert duplicates.  The fools have never been able to learn anything
 from the originals anyway; they'll labor for fifty more fruitless
 years, then shrug, pack the whole mess off to a warehouse in Illinois,
 and move on to their next assignments."

 Thunder rumbles from the sky overhead.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The gray-haired man continues.  "You have something that belongs to
 us," he says.  "As you can plainly see, there is nowhere for you to go.
 Despite your weak bargaining position, we can afford to be generous, so
 I would like to offer both of you positions as Vice Presidents in one
 of our many exciting subsidiary or affiliated corporations.  All you
 have to do is give me the disk."

 A few bright flashes of lightning light the sky directly overhead.

>SAVE
>cf23
 Saved.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The gray-haired man looks at you expectantly.

 Static electricity crackles through the sky overhead.

>throw disk off roof
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>throw disk
 You throw the disk.  Teeterwaller and the gray-haired man follow the
 disk with their eyes as it arcs into the night sky and disappears into
 the distance.

 "I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement," the gray-haired
 man says.  He motions to the guards, who come up onto the roof and
 arrest you.

 The guards take you to their security office, and later turn you over
 to the local police, who arrest you on trespassing charges.  You and
 Teeterwaller tell your fantastic story of hijacked trucks and floating
 anti-gravity disks, but the police just ignore you.

 After a night in the local jail, the police release you, explaining
 that the company that owns the plant is not pressing charges.  In town,
 you and Teeterwaller find a mechanic to fix the car.  You return home,
 having missed your meeting.  Life returns to normal.

 In the months that follow, the subject of that strange night seems to
 become taboo, and you and Teeterwaller never again discuss it.
 Eventually, Teeterwaller leaves the company; you hear later that he's
 working for one of those UFO magazines, writing bitter diatribes about
 government conspiracies and military cover-ups.

 You often wonder what might have happened if you had escaped with the
 odd little black disk, but you feel fortunate enough to have made it
 through the experience unscathed.

 *** Your life has returned to normal. ***

 Your score is 85 of a possible 100, in 748 moves.  If Mr. Teeterwaller

    This is the apex of the tower dome, which slopes down in all
 directions.  The air is cool and a steady wind flows past the dome.  An
 access hatch is at the top; it's precariously propped up and open, and
 wisps of green vapor drift out.  Handholds set into the roof form a
 ladder down the west side of the dome.

 made a good career decision that strange night, but you can't help
 wondering from time to time what might have happened if you'd somehow
 escaped with the odd little black disk.  It's an idle thought, though;
 you'd just have ended up like Teeterwaller, writing bitter diatribes
 for some little conspiracy-minded UFO magazine.

 The gray-haired man watches you expectantly.  "The perks are very nice
 for Vice Presidents," he says.

 Your hair feels like it's standing on end from the static charge in the
 air.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The gray-haired man looks at you expectantly.

 Thunder roars overhead.  Lightning flashes from cloud to cloud in the
 sky above you.  Suddenly, a tongue of lightning cuts through the air
 directly in front of you, striking the center of the dome.

 Somehow, the lightning bolt stays where it is, dancing a little around
 the top of the dome but continuing to discharge electricity.

>put disk in lightning
 You carefully hold out the disk, and very slowly move your hand toward
 the lightning bolt.  Your skin tingles with electricity as you get
 closer, and your hair starts to stand on end.

 A tiny tendril of brilliant white light leaps out from the lightning
 bolt and touches the disk.  You feel a jab and jerk your hand back, but
 you see that the disk is glowing with an intense blue light, and you
 start to feel light-headed and disoriented.  Teeterwaller grabs your
 arm, and the two of you rapidly ascend into the sky.  The gray haired
 man reaches his hand out toward you and shouts something, but you're
 already too far away to hear what he's saying.

 The wind picks up speed and changes direction several times as you
 climb, and you start drifting to the north.  Soon the lights of the
 plant are behind you, and you're over open ground.  Silence falls as
 your own motion matches the wind speed and you move along at the same
 rate as the surrounding air.

 "I can't believe we made it out of there alive!"  Teeterwaller says.
 "This is an amazing find," he says, indicating the disk.

 You start descending again, and you see that you're headed for the
 road--in fact, you can see Teeterwaller's car, right where you left it.
 The disk's glow fades, and you settle gently to the ground near the
 car.

 Headlights approach from down the road.  They draw nearer, and the
 vehicle starts slowing down and pulling over behind Teeterwaller's car.
 You almost make a run for it, when you see that the vehicle is a van
 from a local television station.  A young woman in a smart blue dress
 gets out from the passenger side, and a man in a flannel shirt carrying
 a video camera follows.

 "Excuse me," the woman says as she approaches you.  "We've had some
 reports of strange electrical activity in the sky around here, and I
 wondered if either of you have seen anything interesting tonight."

 Teeterwaller smiles at you.  "Yes," he says.  "As a matter of fact we
 have."

 Author's Notes

 Are we in Blottnya yet?

 Some people who played the Competition Edition wondered whether the
 game was meant to take place in Blottnya.  There's so much Blottnian
 stuff lying around (Teeterwaller's car, the dog, the article in the
 Dufon journal, the language textbook), especially in the areas outside
 the plant complex, that it may seem that the setting is Blottnya.  If
 you made this assumption, you probably found it jarring near the end of
 the game when the gray-haired man says a few things that strongly imply
 that the setting is really the United States (he mentions Arizona and
 Illinois, for example).

 All of the Blottnian references were really just a motif, and weren't
 meant to imply that the story was set in Blottnya.  In fact, to me the
 language textbook suggests that we're not in Blottnya, since it teaches
 Blottnian as a foreign language to speakers of English.

 In this revised edition, I've tried to make it more obvious from the
 start that we're not in Blottnya.  For example, if you ask Teeterwaller
 about Blottnya, he'll tell you that he traveled there years ago and
 doesn't want to go back; Teeterwaller also points out while you're
 reading the textbook that he's never heard of anyone "in this country"
 studying Blottnian.

 What happened to the hostages?

 The fate of the guards from the hijacked trucks is a detail that never
 made it into the final game, mostly for lack of time before the
 competition.  My plan was to include a seminar room where the guards
 from the trucks were watching a presentation on the many reasons to
 switch employers and join the company that owns the plant--great health
 insurance benefits, a generous relocation allowance, career advancement
 potential, and a very competitive compensation package.

 I always wonder, when I'm watching something like a Bond movie, how
 these vast criminal enterprises always manage to attract and retain
 such a large army of generic henchmen, especially when the evil genius
 running the show is always giving negative performance feedback to
 underperforming lieutenants by opening the trap door or feeding them to
 the sharks.  I mean, where's the incentive to come into work in the
 morning?

 So, the seminar room was supposed to show that the plant's owners were
 a new kind of criminal enterprise, an enlightened, 90's kind of
 conspiracy that recognizes that its employees are its most important
 asset and emphasizes teamwork and coaching over sharks and trap doors.
 But, it wasn't integral to the story, so in the end it fell off the
 list.

 Would the decoy trucks really work?

 Originally, the decoy trucks were never meant to reach their
 destination.  In my early plans for the game, soon after entering the
 plant, you'd come across a television (in a guard house) showing
 coverage of the aftermath of a horrible train wreck that, of course,
 involved the decoy truck convoy.  The idea was that the trucks would be
 destroyed in a huge flaming wreck, which would damage everything so
 badly that the government would never know that the materials had been
 stolen.

 As with the recruiting seminar, this detail didn't seem important
 enough to build a whole scene around it, so the matter of the decoys
 was handled in the gray-haired man's speech, when he says that the
 government scientists wouldn't be smart enough to detect the deception.

 This doesn't address the question of whether the original guards would
 be missed (which wasn't as issue with the train wreck, since everyone
 would have been presumed killed).  However, one can imagine that the
 people on the receiving end of the shipment didn't know the guards or
 the drivers personally, so henchmen posing as the guards should have
 fooled the recipients.  Given the apparent resources of the
 conspirators, a little bureaucratic tampering should be sufficient to
 paper over any remaining questions about where all of the guards went
 after delivering the goods.

 What did Teeterwaller know and when did he know it?

 A few people have asked whether Teeterwaller knew what he was getting
 you into; it has even been suggested that Teeterwaller planned the
 automobile breakdown so that he'd be at the right place at the right
 time.

 It's clear toward the end of the story that Teeterwaller knows more
 than he's letting on.  The first real sign of this, I think, is his
 lack of surprise when you realize that the truck cargo is radioactive,
 but he's especially blatant in the records room ("I've been looking for
 this type of information for years").

 Personally, my theory is that Teeterwaller was just incredibly lucky,
 and that chance favored his prepared mind, which was obviously full of
 conspiracy theories and UFO trivia to start with.  However, he is
 suspiciously eager to find out what's going on, and his talk of a "big
 reward is pretty unconvincing motivation.  (So unconvincing, in fact,
 that I've changed that detail in this revised edition.  He's now
 straightforward about being driven by curiousity, and doesn't try the
 `reward' ploy, but instead simply asks for your help.)

 A Witness to History

 One of the techniques that I used throughout this game was multi-turn
 cut scenes.  In some games, major plot events are related in single,
 large blocks of text, often called `cut scenes' (a term borrowed from
 graphical games, which use it to refer to non-interactive sequences of
 animation, essentially little movies, that fill in plot and provide
 transitions between game sections).  The Plant uses a similar
 technique, but I broke up most of these into series of scenes spread
 out over several turns.  In most cases, you're viewing the events from
 a distance, and can't do much except watch and wait.

 As the author it's always hard to perceive the exact effect that
 players will, but I have mixed feelings about the technique.  On the
 one hand, I like the small, easily-digested chunks of text; long
 monolithic cut scenes are often overwhelming simply in the amount of
 text that appears all at once.  I also like the way that the multi-turn
 sequences integrate the cut scenes with `game time,' keeping the action
 on a somewhat consistent time scale rather than abruptly having many
 turns' worth of time elapse between two consecutive command prompts.

 On the other hand, the effect is distancing, in that it removes
 interactivity from a scene almost as much as a single large cut scene
 would.

 I think that, in future games, I'd like to try to find more interactive
 ways of unfolding major plot advances.  It's a difficult balancing act,
 because you want the plot to unfold without puzzling the player, indeed
 almost in spite of the player--in other words, you essentially want to
 coerce the player into doing the right thing; but at the same time, you
 want the player to feel a degree of freedom of action greater than I
 offered in these cut scenes.

 Some games achieve this type of coercion by killing the player on a
 misstep, but I think this destroys the illusion of interactivity by
 forcing you to save and restore repeatedly, since you're essentially
 trying to navigate through a minefield.  I think a better approach
 would be to make it so obvious what to do next, and so rewarding to do
 the obvious thing, that the player will naturally feel inclined play
 along and follow your script--ideally without even realizing that
 there's a script.  The multi-turn cut scenes in this game are a very
 primitive attempt at this, I think, but since the only thing you can do
 is `wait,' it gets repetitive after a while.  Something to keep in mind
 on the next game.

 As probably happens in the course of any software project, a number of
 details of the game's original design changed in the course of
 implementation, when I found that some elements weren't working.  I've
 made transcripts of some of the biggest changes, along with some notes
 on why I didn't keep the original versions.

 (One of the biggest changes that I made after starting work on the game
 was adding Mr. Teeterwaller.  Originally, the player was going to be
 alone.  I decided very early on that I wanted the player to have a
 companion who had an inkling (or at least a suspicion) of what might be
 going on inside the plant, but the original design lacked this element.

 (Without Mr. Teeterwaller, the player needed some sort of motivation to
 break into the plant.  The hijacking scene certainly made it clear that
 something mysterious was going on, but it didn't by itself give the
 player any reason to become involved.  To provide this motivation, the
 original design had a minor character named Major Bennett, who shows up
 just after the hijacking.

 (The hijacking started off pretty much the same as it does in the final
 game.  After the bulldozers started clearing wreckage, though, Major
 Bennett shows up...)


 The trucks that are still intact start moving into the plant, one by
 one, as the bulldozers clear a path through the wreckage.

 You hear a rustling sound behind you.  You turn to look, and hear a
 woman's voice yell `Freeze!'  You're so rattled by what you've just
 seen that you practically jump over the fence with fright.  You quickly
 raise your hands.  Someone approaches behind you and pats you down for
 weapons, then withdraws.

 `Turn around, slowly,' the voice says.

 You turn around--like she said, slowly--and see a woman in an army
 uniform pointing a pistol at you.  Her uniform looks like an officer's,
 which is quickly confirmed when you see that her nameplate reads MAJ.
 BENNETT--a major.  Her eyes do not blink as she watches you, and her
 expression is fierce.

 `Who the hell are you?'  she asks.  `Are you part of this operation?'

 She almost laughs.  `I doubt it,' she says dismissively.  She seems to
 relax a little, having decided you're not a threat.  `Okay, so who are
 you?'

 You explain about your car trouble, that you're here purely by accident
 and bad timing.

 The major nods.  `It may be bad timing for you, but you may be the
 first bit of good luck I've had today.'  She lowers her gun, then
 suddenly loses her balance, just managing to grab the fence for
 support.  You notice for the first time that her left leg is wet--with
 blood, you realize.  The major slowly lowers herself to the ground, her
 left leg out straight in front of her.

 `As you can probably see, I've been shot,' she says.  `I'm not going
 anywhere in this condition.  From the way I feel I doubt I'll even be
 conscious much longer.  I don't suppose you're a doctor?'  she asks;
 you can't tell if she's being sarcastic.

 `There's not much you could have done anyway,' she says.

 `I'd better at least try to stop this bleeding.'  She laboriously takes
 off her belt, leans forward, wraps it around her leg above the wound
 and pulls the belt tight.

 She leans back against the fence.  She looks exhausted.  `I need your
 help,' she says, visibly fighting to stay awake.  `Those trucks out
 there were transporting live nuclear weapons.  I don't know who the
 hell these people are, but someone has to stop them.'  Her voice drops
 almost to a whisper.  `Look, I know you're just an innocent bystander
 here, but you're the only one who can stop them.  Here,' she says,
 reaching in her pocket and pulling something out; she tries to toss it
 to you, but she only manages to throw it a couple of feet. `That's the
 destruct key.  If there's any way you can get in there, find the bombs,
 use the key--it'll destroy their detonators and render them harmless.'

 With that, the major slips into unconsciousness, her head falling to
 her chest and her body going limp.

 (The scene concludes pretty much as in the final game.  Of course, the
 bit about nuclear weapons is just the cover story, as you eventually
 find out, but now you have a reason to continue with the story.  The
 destruct key really is the destruct key, though; at the end of the
 story, you'd have the option of destroying the artifacts, letting the
 hijackers keep them, or stealing them.)

 ________


 (In the first scene involving opening the crate from the truck, when
 you're viewing events through the vent opening in the air duct, there
 was originally going to be a force field erected around the crate.
 This was meant to make it more obvious that this was no ordinary
 crate.)

 This aluminum air duct is just large enough to crawl through here, but
 splits into several smaller ducts to the west, none of which are large
 enough to permit further passage.  The duct widens to the east.  A vent
 cover, two feet on a side, is over an opening in the floor.

 A cavernous space the size of an airplane hangar is visible through the
 opening.  The floor is a hundred feet below.  Equipment of all kinds is
 scattered throughout the room:  forklifts, generators, machines
 connected by thick electrical cables running across the floor, welding
 torches with their gas tanks, rolling racks of power tools, portable
 arc lights.

 In the center of the room is a rectangular area marked with a yellow
 border painted on the floor, clear of any equipment.

 Several workers, dressed in isolation suits and gas masks, are standing
 just outside the yellow border.

 A forklift comes into view and moves toward the center of the floor
 below, beeping as it slowly carries a silver crate the size of a small
 car across the room.  The forklift drives into the yellow rectangle and
 gently sets the crate down in the center.  The forklift backs out and
 heads out of view.

 The workers, still standing just outside the yellow border, turn around
 and face away from the crate.  Suddenly, a flash of white light, like a
 reflection of the sun in a mirror, bursts from the yellow border, and a
 moment later you hear a small thunderclap.  The afterimage takes
 several seconds to fade from your eyes; once you can see clearly again,
 you notice that the air around and above the yellow rectangular area is
 shimmering slightly and has a slight blue glow.

 Time passes...

 Through the opening in the floor, you see the workers move to different
 pieces of equipment, setting dials and switches.  After each worker has
 checked several pieces of equipment, they gather together; they look
 like they're talking among themselves but you can't hear what they're
 saying.

 The workers seem to conclude their conversation.  They take off their
 gas masks, then head to a corner of the room and disappear from sight.

 (The force field was to have played a part later in the game as well.
 The observation room was actually going to be a control room, which
 would have let you turn off the force field, which would in turn would
 have sent the workers running for cover.  Once the force field had been
 lowered, of course, you'd have needed an isolation suit of your own to
 enter the lab.  I removed all of this partially because the game was
 getting to be long enough without additional puzzles involving the
 force field and isolation suit, but mostly because it would have robbed
 the end of the game of its momentum.)

 (The end of the game was originally going to be rather different from
 the way it finally turned out.  After you'd seen enough--the records
 room and the lab in particular--the end-game was to begin with your
 capture.)

 A large group of armed guards appears out of nowhere.  Before you
 realize what's happening, several of the guards wrestle you to the
 ground and handcuff your hands behind your back.

 `X-Ray five, we've apprehended the subject,' you hear someone say.  An
 unintelligible voice from a walkie-talkie replies.

 The guards pull you to your feet.  You look around and realize that
 Teeterwaller has disappeared; you're not sure if the guards have
 already taken him away separately or if he somehow evaded them.

 The guards escort you through a series of passages that you haven't
 seen before, leading you deeper and deeper underground.  Finally, you
 arrive at a small cell; a guard removes your handcuffs, then locks the
 door, leaving you alone.

 Cell
    This is a small room, about eight feet by eight feet; the single
 exit is a heavy steel door to the south, locked from the outside.
 Against one wall is an air vent; the only other feature is an air vent
 in the ceiling.

 (A few turns would elapse, allowing you to explore your surroundings,
 although there wasn't much you could do at this point.)

 You hear a scraping sound coming from the air vent.

 Time passes...

 A whisper comes from the air vent.  `Hello, is that you?'  You realize
 it's Mr. Teeterwaller!

 `We don't have time for that now.'

 `I'm going to find a way to get you out of here,' Teeterwaller whispers
 from the air vent.

 Not surprisingly, the builder didn't use the kind of air vent cover you
 can open.

 The cell door opens.  A guard enters and motions for you to follow.
 You glance up at the vent, then follow the guard.

 Five guards escort you down the hall and into an elevator, which climbs
 several floors.  You emerge into a plushly furnished room that looks
 like a country club lounge:  big leather chairs, portraits on the wall,
 a brick fireplace with smoldering logs.  The guards lead you across the
 room and through some doors, down a wide hallway, and into a darkened
 room; all of the guards but one remain outside.

 The guard leads you to a chair sitting in a pool of light at the end of
 a mahogany table.  You sit, and the guard stands behind you.

 (You'd receive essentially the same lecture from the gray-haired man at
 this point as in the final end-game sequence.  Eventually, Teeterwaller
 would have shown up to rescue you, and you'd make your daring escape.

 (I saw quickly that this approach wasn't going to work.  The obvious
 problem was that the gray-haired man simply had no good reason to
 lecture or cajole you, since you had essentially nothing that he might
 want.  If you'd already stolen the disk, the guards simply would have
 taken it when they captured you.  Teeterwaller might have slipped away
 with it, but that wouldn't leave you with any bargaining power.  This
 was basically going to be a James Bond end-game, with the evil genius
 revealing his master plan as the laser beam slowly closes in on Bond,
 who's strapped to a table.  The device is tired in movies but worse in
 IF, because of the momentum-destroying effects of a puzzle.

 (So, I rearranged the end-game to eliminate the capture, replacing it
 with an extended chase, leaving the player with a degree of freedom in
 the final showdown.)
