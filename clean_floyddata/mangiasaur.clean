 Mangiasaur

 Mangiasaur

 by DCBSupafly


 Your long sleep is over.  You open your eyes to a world of green leaves
 and a rising sun.  The air around you is filled with pollen and
 insects.  Your parents will have left months ago, leaving this land to
 you alone, for a growing mangiasaur needs all the food it can find.

 [ Forest Canopy | Your Size: 0 ]
>examine me
 You are a mangiasaur.  You were born into your treetop home and left to
 hibernate until to you were old enough to fulfill your destiny: to eat
 and grow.

>eat leaves
 You are not holding the trees.

>take trees
 A mangiasaur has no pockets.  It has only a stomach.

>eat insects
 You are not holding the bugs.

>eat
 I don't understand what you are trying to eat.

 You spot a nearby caterpillar behaving strangely; apparently having
 finished eating, it seems to be busy defecating!  It squirms around on
 its branch, excreting little grey blobs all around itself.  After
 watching for a short while, you realize that it's building a shell out
 of this dejection!  Moments later, it's completely covered in its
 cocoon.

>eat cocoon
 (Your score has increased by 3)
 It's not like it can run away.  You scrape the dry little thing off its
 branch and chew.  It tastes pretty awful.  In fact, it almost seems to
 hurt!  Besides the dry, stringiness of it, you feel a mild stinging
 sensation in your mouth!  You can feel the hunger relenting as you
 digest, but the your body doesn't seem to know what to do with the
 food.  You won't grow any larger from such a small bite, but you feel
 growth nonetheless...in your shoulders.  You bleed briefly and squirm
 from the pain, beginning to wish you had just left the little wad of
 bug alone until you realize ... you have not grown bigger, but you have
 grown wings.

 A small fly buzzes past you, en route to its lunch at a tiny pink
 flower bud nearby.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine wings
 You see no such thing.

 A caterpillar cocoon nearby begins to stir, seemingly trying to wiggle
 free of the branch it previously clung to with such tenacity!  After a
 moment, though, rather than shaking loose, it simply cracks open and a
 golden brown moth flutters out.  The moth alights on a branch nearby,
 flapping its wings idly for a moment before taking off in flight.

>fly
 You're not really willing to fly if it doesn't lead directly to food or
 a new dining location.

>eat moth
 By the time you see the moth, it's no longer there.  They move too fast
 for you to eat them.

 They fill the air around you and it's easy to pounce on one.
 There is a satisfying crunch as you snap your mouth shut on its squishy
 little body.  A little rumination and the fly slides down your gullet
 into your belly.
 The fly's nutrients are exactly what you need to grow bigger and
 stronger.  A good meal.  You'll be satisfied for a while now. While you
 digest the bug, your body grows a little bit larger.

 Your stomach is finishing off its contents.  Soon you will need more

>eat buds

 You stoop to bite one off the branch and catch a whiff of the sweet
 pollen in the air around it.

 When you bite into the little bud, a burst of delicious, syrupy nectar
 squirts out.
 The sugary nectar contained in the bud is a wonderful treat.  Though
 you were already full of food when you ate, your stomach makes room for

>look

 Forest Canopy
 The uppermost branches of the trees are thick with bright green
 foliage, little buds of pink, purple, and orange, and a multitude of
 creatures skittering, slinking, and flapping about.

 Down below you is the forest floor.
 The sun has reached its peak, at the top of the sky.  You can feel its
 pleasant warmth all around you.

 A little caterpillar moth is flying around.

 Some pollen from a flower bud floats by on a treetop breeze.  The scent
 of the pink dust is enough to make your mouth water.

 The pollen in the air must come from the flower buds that are sprouting
 from the branches.  It's a pale pink and orange dust that drifts
 through the leaves.

 Looking closely at the foliage around you, you see a small green bird
 hiding in the leaves.

>eat bird

 You can't catch them in the air, but you can certainly catch one
 standing idly on a branch.
 You close your jaws on the feathery food before it even sees you.
 Under all the feathery fluff, you find a pretty good meal.  Though you
 were already full of food when you ate, your stomach makes room for the

 lips.

>go east
 You can't go in that direction, but you can move down.

>go down
 You glide down from your canopy birthplace into the dark forest floor
 below.

 [ Forest Floor | Your Size: 11 ]
>look

 Forest Floor
 Under the canopy the trees are huge columns of wood sprouting from a
 rotten, brown blanket of fallen leaves and branches.

 From the treetops, the forest floor always seemed like a barren
 wasteland;  there is no living foliage to speak of, and very little
 light gets through the canopy.  Now that you are down here, however,
 you can see that the landscape is just as alive as up in the treetops.
 Slugs are so common here that the foliage on the ground is constantly
 moving.

 From here you can go back up to the treetops, east into the valley, or
 south into the cavern.
 The air is cooling as the sun moves toward its resting place.

 Distension is a natural thing for a mangiasaur's belly, but you are
 aware of your stomach returning to normal as you process your excess of
 food.

 A nasty little slug slimes around on a leaf near your feet.

>eat slug
 (Your score has increased by 1)
 You stoop to lap up a slimy little slug.
 It tastes digusting.  It does ease your hunger a little, but is it
 really worth it?

>eat sun
 You are not holding the sky.

 You hear some kind of animal nearby dragging itself along the forest
 floor.

>listen
 Scaly crawlers make the most noise down here, dragging their tales
 along the ground, sifting for slugs.

 While you're by no means starving, You could certainly fit a bit more
 food in there.

 The animal is getting closer.  You hear it disturbing leaves as it
 moves.

>listen
 Scaly crawlers make the most noise down here, dragging their tales
 along the ground, sifting for slugs.

 A scaly crawler beast with a wrinkly face is crawling around nearby,
 dragging its tail in the forest's debris.  It walks sometimes on two
 legs and sometimes on four.  It picks little slugs up from the ground
 and grimaces while eating them.

>eat beast
 I don't understand what you are trying to eat.

 Cavern
 The cavern is damp and dark.  It's mossy walls dampen the sounds of all
 the cavern's creatures, digging, flapping, & chirping.

 The only way out is north to the forest floor.

 The buzzing of bugs gets louder as a swarm of them moves closer to you.

 Bugs fly all over the cave.  It's hard to move without running into

 (Your score has increased by 1)
 It's not like to you need to know where these bugs are to eat them.
 The air is so saturated that you need only open your mouth to catch
 one.
 You crunch the tiny morsel to nothing and digest it in seconds.  Though
 you were already full of food when you ate, your stomach makes room for
 the food. Unfortunately, it's too little food to help you grow at all.

 You hear a flapping of wings as a bat approaches.

>eat bat
 (Your score has increased by 4)
 You snap your mouth shut, crushing the bat instantly.  It's a little
 more than a mouthful.
 You enjoy the delicious bat, spitting out the wings as you chew and
 swallow.  By the time you are done eating, you feel a strange sensation
 in your throat.  You are not choking though.  Rather, you are growing.
 A lump in your throat.  Not a tumor, but a voice box!  You have grown
 your own voice box and can now chirp like a bat!
 Though you were already full of food when you ate, your stomach makes
 room for the food.  You have grown considerably by the time you're done
 eating.

 [ Cavern | Your Size: 17 ]
>eat bat
 You can tell they're all around you, but you can't find any near enough
 to catch.

>chirp
 You send out a little bat chirp, and look for the echos.
 The echoing chirp reveals a bat nearby.
 The echoing chirp shows you a scurrying rodent digging its way into the
 wall of the cavern nearby.

>eat rodent
 (Your score has increased by 3)
 You spot a rodent nearby and leap for it.
 The creature is dumb and easy to catch once you've found it.
 The creature is dumb and easy to catch once you've found it.  Moments
 after eating it, you can already feel the growth in your toes.  They
 are lengthened, and curved for digging!  You may not be able to dig
 through the stone walls of the cave like these creatures, but you
 should try digging outside in the dirt.

 A nasty little slug slimes around on a leaf near your feet.

 Amidst the usual nighttime forest sounds, there is an usual rumbling

 Valley Pass
 The trees of the forest to the west give way abruptly to a low rolling
 grassland nestled between huge looming mountains.  Smelly herd beasts
 upset the tranquility of the area with their grass-nibbling and
 farting.  The only other disruptions in the billowing grasses are a
 small adobe hut, and a grove of strange trees nearby.

 The valley is level with the forest floor to the west, but the eastern
 wall of the valley is formed by a large plateau rising at least as high
 as the mountains around it, casting a dark shadow on much of the
 grassland through much of the day.
 The moon has reached its peak on this short summer night.  The air is
 cool and the stars shine in the night sky.

 [ Valley Pass | Your Size: 30 ]
>examine hut
 You see no such thing.

>examine trees
 The grove is full of these trees.  They are tall, slender trees, with
 hard, thick bark.

 You feel a little tickling on your legs, when you push the grass aside,
 you see a small hard-shelled beetle crawling off your leg onto the
 grass.

>eat beetle
 (Your score has increased by 1)
 You slurp one up and chew.  It really doesn't have much flavor but
 after a little chewing, you feel a fine powder on your tongue and gums.
 Spitting some out, you realize it's from your teeth!  The beetle's
 shell is so hard that it has actually managed to sharpen your teeth!
 You can forget about swallowing one of those beetles, but if you were
 hoping to be able to eat tree bark then today's your lucky day!

 aware of your stomach returning to normal as you process your excess of

>eat tree bark
 (Your score has increased by 1)
 With your newly sharpened teeth, it's a breeze.  You gnaw the bark raw
 on the nearest tree. Though you were already full of food when you ate,
 your stomach makes room for the food.  You look back to the tree where
 you bit into it and notice that a funny yellow sap is leaking from the
 porous wood.

>eat sap
 (Your score has increased by 1)
 You lick up a bit of the sap.  You decide immediately that it's nowhere
 near as good a snack as the tree bark that held it in.  It's
 interesting though.  It has an oiliness about it.  It's not very sticky
 though.

>examine sap
 It's opaque and viscous.  It's running very slowly down the tree from
 the gash in the bark.

 While you're by no means starving, You could certainly fit a bit more
 food in there.

 A smelly herd animal nearby lets out an intense fart.  You have little
 sense of smell, and you cannot eat a fart, so you ignore it.

>examine animal
 These smelly herd animals dot the grasslands, munching on the tall
 grass and farting.

 (Your score has increased by 1)
 You munch it for a while.  It's no good, really.   Tough and devoid of
 nutrition.  Tastes mildly bitter, but that's not a big deal.  As you
 move down the stalk, however, you notice some things beneath the grass.

 At the base of the grass stalks are some kind of air-filled sacs.

 Crawling all over those sacs are little hard shelled beetles.

>examine sacs
 These little brown air sacs are at the bottom of the grasses that grow
 everywhere in this valley.  The majority of these sacs are swarming
 with little hard-shelled beetles.

 They are too slow to escape you.  If they have ever dealt with

 save them.
 It's nasty, but you power through it, eating every last bit of flesh.
 Though you were already full of food when you ate, your stomach makes
 room for the food.  In addition to filling you up, the meat from the
 smelly animal is great fuel for your growth, and you grow drastically
 in size!

 A hut dweller is standing in here, wondering what you are.

 You snatch the torch off the wall and chomp it to bits.  You are just

 drifting about, illuminating the waters with their brilliant limbs.
 At the bottom of the ocean, you can see a solid mass of wispy plant
 stalks swaying with the water.     Tiny sentient shrimp fill the

 You slice through the glowing rubbery tentacle meat with your new sharp
 teeth, reducing it quickly to little floating bite-sized pieces.  It's
 a wonderful feast: delicious and satisfying!

 You can't go in that direction, but you can move up.

 While you're by no means starving, You could certainly fit a bit more
 food in there.



>go west

>dig
 The hunger makes you crazy.  Try again.

>eat shrimp
 This time you go for a loner.  You find one little tiny self-aware
 crustacean drifing around by itself, etching poems onto a slew of tiny
 shrimp hats.  Chomp!  You squish him with your teeth mid-iamb.  Maybe
 it was actually a better idea to eat larger groups of tiny sentient
 shrimp at once; the flavor of just one is kinda understated.



>eat shrimp
 You've learned from your mistakes.  This time you go for a huge
 line-dancing cluster of shrimp!  It's about to be a scrumptuous
 mouthful of conscious krill but wait!  Just as you are closing your
 mouth, the shrimp zip away leaving little tiny bubbles in their wake!
 Next thing you know, they're pelting you from all sides with their
 spiky little poetry-imbued hats!  It's terribly irritating!  Almost as
 bad as having to snatch them each up one-by-one.  Still pretty tasty in
 the end.  A quick look around reveals a definite dearth of shrimp.  Any
 survivors have clearly fled.



>read hats
 You can't read.  You're not a lexisaur.  That's stupid.



>examine hats
 You can't see any around here.

 Underground Ocean
 The missing tentacle nets are making it hard to see in some areas.  The
 ocean is changing from a dim blue to a dark black.  The remaining
 tentacle nets shed light on their surroundings.  At the bottom of the
 ocean, you can see a solid mass of wispy plant stalks swaying with the
 water.

 The only way out is back up into the hut.

 A small shark is swimming around in the deeper water near the swaying

>eat shark
 (Your score has increased by 5)
 Aren't sharks supposed to be scary?  You just swim right up to this one
 and tear it to pieces.  It's a regular shark smorgasbord, with little
 tasty bits of shark meat drifting around in the water.  Your stomach is
 full of fish before you're even half way done, and you can feel your
 whole body expanded with the meat.  You chomp down another bit and
 suddenly find yourself staring at another shark.  This is one is at
 least fives times the size of the last.  You turn to flee immediately,
 huge shark jaws agape behind you!  You swim well, and escape the
 underground ocean, never to return again.

 [ Valley Pass | Your Size: 87 ]
>look

 Valley Pass
 The trees of the forest to the west give way abruptly to a low rolling
 grassland nestled between huge looming mountains.  Smelly herd beasts
 upset the tranquility of the area with their grass-nibbling and
 farting.  The only other disruptions in the billowing grasses are a
 small adobe hut, and a grove of strange trees nearby.

 The valley is level with the forest floor to the west, but the eastern
 wall of the valley is formed by a large plateau rising at least as high
 as the mountains around it, casting a dark shadow on much of the
 grassland through much of the day.
 The morning sun feels good on your face.

>go west
 You move west.
 Forest Floor

 A nasty little slug slimes around on a leaf near your feet.

 [ Forest Floor | Your Size: 87 ]
>look

 Forest Floor
 Under the canopy the trees are huge columns of wood sprouting from a
 rotten, brown blanket of fallen leaves and branches.

 From the treetops, the forest floor always seemed like a barren
 wasteland;  there is no living foliage to speak of, and very little
 light gets through the canopy.  Now that you are down here, however,
 you can see that the landscape is just as alive as up in the treetops.
 Slugs are so common here that the foliage on the ground is constantly
 moving.

 From here you can go back up to the treetops, east into the valley, or
 south into the cavern.
 The morning sun feels good on your face.



>eat slugs
 You stoop to lap up a slimy little slug.
 It tastes digusting.  It does ease your hunger a little, but is it
 really worth it?

>listen
 Scaly crawlers make the most noise down here, dragging their tales
 along the ground, sifting for slugs.

 Distension is a natural thing for a mangiasaur's belly, but you are
 aware of your stomach returning to normal as you process your excess of
 food.

 (Your score has increased by 2)
 You can pretty much walk right up to it.  It turns its head sideways
 and stares at you, and you jump on it!  It's an easy thing to kill,
 despite its armored shell.  Getting at the meat is a different story.
 Once you finally get at some of the food bits it's probably the most
 delicious thing you've ever eaten!  Just juicy and chewy enough for
 your tastes!  Though you were already full of food when you ate, your
 stomach makes room for the food.  Not only that but you've grown
 considerably by the time you're done with the feast!

 Your stomach is still full and fat.  It's a good feeling.

>examine air sacs
 These little brown air sacs are at the bottom of the grasses that grow
 everywhere in this valley.  The majority of these sacs are swarming
 with little hard-shelled beetles.

 You feel a little tickling on your legs, when you push the grass aside,
 you see a small hard-shelled beetle crawling off your leg onto the
 grass.

>eat air sacs

 I don't understand what you are trying to eat.

 A smelly herd animal nearby lets out an intense fart.  You have little
 sense of smell, and you cannot eat a fart, so you ignore it.

>eat herd animal
 They are too slow to escape you.  If they have ever dealt with
 predators before, probably their smell is the only thing that could
 save them.
 It's nasty, but you power through it, eating every last bit of flesh.
 Though you were already full of food when you ate, your stomach makes
 room for the food.  In addition to filling you up, the meat from the
 smelly animal is great fuel for your growth, and you grow drastically
 in size!

 Perhaps if you were a smelly herd beast, but you're not, nor would you
 want to be, as fun as spending all day eating grass seems.

 Distension is a natural thing for a mangiasaur's belly, but you are
 aware of your stomach returning to normal as you process your excess of
 food.

>eat bark
 With your newly sharpened teeth, it's a breeze.  You gnaw the bark raw
 on the nearest tree. Though you were already full of food when you ate,
 your stomach makes room for the food.  Sure enough, more sap leaks from
 the wound.

 You can't climb rocket tree.

>burp on sap
 The expulsion of hot gas singes your throat, but when it hits the
 exposed tree sap, igniting it in flames, the real show begins.  The
 tree starts to shake and rumble.  When you see the tree uprooting
 itself, you jump on, not wanting to miss the ride.

 The rocket tree, fully aflame from the inside, blasts off from the
 ground and hurtles through the air toward the eastern wall of the
 valley!

 The wind blasts you as you ride the flaming tree through the sky.
 Within seconds of taking off, your rocket tree is sputtering to a halt
 up above the mesa's top.

 The landing is rough, but you survive.  The rocket tree burns up after
 it's done spinning around in the red mesa dust.

 The land up here is dry and dusty.  Little bristly bushes have sprung
 up through the cracks in the hard clay earth.  There are footprints of
 people everywhere, and some kind of slithering tracks near the bushes.
 A family of buzz birds is making a ruckus nearby.
 The sun may be sleeping, but your hunt for food will continue into the
 night.

 The hunter is here on the mesa top, spear in hand, staring at you.

>SAVE

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>eat hunter
 You leap for the hunter, mouth open, claws spread.
 The hunter lunges with its spear, but you slap it away with your foot
 before sinking your teeth into its chest.  The spear clatters to the
 ground and you and the hunter follow it, sending up a huge cloud of
 dust as you land.
 It takes a few minutes to polish it off, but when you're done your
 stomach is full.  Completely.  Not to say that you can't just make it
 bigger when you eat more, but in its current form, it's full.  You have
 grown immensely, adding almost the whole mass of the human to yours.

 You approach the buzz birds cautiously, more than a little worried
 about what might happen if they all decided to fight you at once.  When
 you are close enough, you leap at the nearest one, catching its gangly
 feet in your mouth as the rest of the family flies off, buzzing loudly.
 After a minute of wrestling with this buzz bird, you can eat your meal
 in silence.

 The other end of the spear is carved with an intricate pattern.

 food in there.

 canopy, only with a hint of sourness and some kind of sweet powder...

 brine.  The isolation of the skins brings out a flavor you recognize
 only in memory...
 smelly herd beast meat, but without the stench!  How did they do it...
 hard-shelled beetle bodies, shells heated to a thin crispy coating!
 These humans are capable of such wonders!...
 tiny sentient shrimp!  And garnished with little tiny poetry hats!
 They must have their own access to an underwater ocean...
 and many more incredible delicacies.  As you swish it all around in
 your mouth you are overcome with a wonderful warmth.  You are full.
 You are full and ready to nap.  So you do.

 And every day from now on you awake to more beautiful platter of

 When you claimed that you were tough enough to take on Malygris
 single-handedly, everyone knew you had been drinking much more than was
 good for you. And the prince is not one to let an opportunity pass.
 Before you could so much as protest, his court mage opened a portal and
 you were shoved through. Predictably, the portal immediately
 disappeared. You doubt they're going to open it up again -- but at
 least you can try to make good on your boast and kill Malygris, the
 Wizard of Kerkerkruip!

 As the daggers fall down, you feel the soul that animated them absorbed
 into your own body. You are sharp. You are deadly. (Power of the
 daggers: +2 attack, +1 damage, -1 defence, +6 health, +1 dexterity, and
 the pierce skill.)

 Absorbing a soul has fully healed you.

 Hall of Vapours
 Several large pipes continuously spew forth vapours into this room.

 Thick clouds of smoke fill the room.

 A skull-sized ball of gooish, undulating flesh jumps up and down
 ponderously. It is a jumping bomb, gathering speed and preparing to
 launch itself at one of its enemies.

 Exits lead east (to Entrance Hall), west and down.

>examine flesh
 Connoisseurs consider these jumping balls of red meat to be among the
 most exciting spectacles of Yahvinna's annual Feast of Flesh. To the
 slaves and convicts down in the arena, whose limbs the spectators hope
 to have blown into their lap, the jumping bombs also bring excitement,
 though of a wholly different type.

 The jumping bomb is a level two hostile creature.

 You transform part of your own flesh into a magical dagger, which then
 speeds towards Miranda of its own accord. Miranda rolls 1 + 7

 "But... my adventure was only just beginning!" cries Miranda.

 As Miranda dies, you feel her soul absorbed into your own body. (Power

 Placing treasures...

 Finishing the dungeon...








 When you claimed that you were tough enough to take on Malygris
 single-handedly, everyone knew you had been drinking much more than was
 good for you. And the prince is not one to let an opportunity pass.
 Before you could so much as protest, his court mage opened a portal and
 you were shoved through. Predictably, the portal immediately
 disappeared. You doubt they're going to open it up again -- but at
 least you can try to make good on your boast and kill Malygris, the
 Wizard of Kerkerkruip!

 Since you are strengthened by blood, hitting an enemy gives you a
 temporary damage bonus. (Level 1)
 When you die, you explode, dealing as much damage to your enemy as the
 enemy dealt to you. This gives you a last chance to kill your enemy,
 and perhaps absorb his soul and come back to life in the process.
 (Level 2)
 You can confuse as a reaction; the attacker may lose concentration and
 become confused. (Level 3)

 When you claimed that you were tough enough to take on Malygris
 single-handedly, everyone knew you had been drinking much more than was
 good for you. And the prince is not one to let an opportunity pass.
 Before you could so much as protest, his court mage opened a portal and
 you were shoved through. Predictably, the portal immediately
 disappeared. You doubt they're going to open it up again -- but at
 least you can try to make good on your boast and kill Malygris, the
 Wizard of Kerkerkruip!

 Kerkerkruip
 An IF roguelike by Victor Gijsbers
 Release 1 / Serial number 110929 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Entrance Hall
 The vast entrance hall is empty, silent, foreboding. Skull-sized rubies
 project a red light far too bright for the eyes of a human.

 You can see the crown of the empire and the goggles of acuity here.

 Exits lead north, south, west and up.

>get all then wear crown
 goggles of acuity: Taken.

 You put on the crown of the empire.

 Drawing Room
 This otherwise unremarkable room has been decorated with a fascinating
 drawing.

 copper chains, both thick and thin, that hulks in its center.

 You can also see a scroll labelled TWAN METIER here.

 Exits lead south (to Entrance Hall), west and down.

>examine golem

>go up
 Portal Room
 A huge magical portal dominates the room.

 A swarm of small daggers is flying through the air like a flock of
 birds, their sharp points eagerly seeking your flesh.

 Exits lead west and down (to Entrance Hall).

>attack daggers

 Rolling 6 + 2 (inherent bonus) - 2 (defender dodging) = 6, you beat the
 swarm of daggers's defence rating of 4.

 You deal 2 = 2 damage, wounding the swarm of daggers to 6 health.

 spend one action regrouping themselves.

 Rolling 8 + 2 (inherent bonus) - 2 (defender dodging) + 1 (tension) =
 9, you beat the swarm of daggers's defence rating of 4.

 You deal 3 = 3 damage, killing the swarm of daggers.

 All life suddenly goes out of the daggers. For a moment they hang still
 in the air, but then the planet below pulls them inexorably downwards.

 As the daggers fall down, you feel the soul that animated them absorbed
 into your own body. You are sharp. You are deadly. (Power of the
 daggers: +2 attack, +1 damage, -1 defence, +6 health, +1 dexterity, and
 the pierce skill.)

 Absorbing a soul has fully healed you.

>look
 A huge magical portal dominates the room.

 Exits lead west and down (to Entrance Hall).

>examine portal

>go west
 Library
 Hundreds of books line the walls of this magnificent library, a bigger
 collection than the already legendary one of the marquis of Savon.

 Room).

>go south
 Alchemical Laboratory
 Centuries ago, Malygris captured the great alchemist Metastasio and
 forced him to work in this laboratory. Most of his equipment is now
 gone, but one curious machine remains.

 A small simian creature aggressively shows you its teeth.

 You can also see a smoke grenade and a fungicide contraption here.

 An exit leads north (to Entrance Hall).

>examine ape
 and is perhaps even more muscular. Thankfully, the ape is somewhat
 smaller than you are.

 The blood ape is a level one hostile creature.

>attack ape

 Rolling 4 + 4 (inherent bonus) = 8, you do not overcome the blood ape's
 defence rating of 8.

 The blood ape concentrates, and is now quite concentrated.

>attack ape

 Rolling 6 + 4 (inherent bonus) - 2 (defender dodging) + 1 (tension) =
 9, you beat the blood ape's defence rating of 8.

 You deal 2 + 1 (tension) + 2 (inherent bonus) = 5 damage, killing the
 blood ape.

 The blood ape topples over with a small grunt.

 The blood-hungry soul that animated the ape is absorbed into your own
 body. You are strong. You hunger for blood. (Power of the ape: +1
 attack, +1 defence, +2 health; when you score a hit, your damage will
 increase for a short time.)

 The violence of the absorption drives the power of the daggers out of
 your body. Absorbing a soul has fully healed you.

>look

 Entrance Hall
 The vast entrance hall is empty, silent, foreboding. Skull-sized rubies

 Exits lead north (to Drawing Room), south (to Alchemical Laboratory),
 west and up (to Portal Room).

 Hall of Mirrors
 Mirrors surround you on all sides in an impossible geometry. Myriad
 reflections follow your every movement -- though some, always in the
 corner of your eyes, seem to behave differently.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 You can see a tormenting necklace (reflected thousandfold) here.

 Exits lead north, east (to Entrance Hall) and up (to Library).

>examine necklace
 broken points of daggers and thorns. It is imbued with a magic that
 deals paralysing pain to anyone who is wounded in combat. (This
 necklace lowers the initiative of anyone who gets hit -- including you
 -- thus increasing the probability that a successful attacker can
 immediately act again.)

>get necklace

 As rust spores whirl around the room, the smoke grenade rusts.

>go north
 Phantasmagoria
 This huge hall is filled with the radiant images of warriors long dead,
 fighting their bloody battles over and over again. You see several
 knights in plate armour struggling to reach the shores of a swamp,
 while the land retreats before them as if it were alive -- but the
 scene changes before you can focus on any details.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 Exits lead south (to Hall of Mirrors), east (to Drawing Room), west and
 up.

>go west
 Temple of Isatzo
 Exactly half of the room is black, and exactly half of it is white.
 This is the temple of Isatzo, the god of balance, whose statue stands
 in the center, one arm stretched out to each side.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 You can see a rusted executioner's axe and a rusted war mask here.

 An exit leads east (to Phantasmagoria).

 The famous workshop of the master of Algir has been transported here in
 all its glory. A huge forge dominates the room.

 A pale druidess stands here, murmuring to herself in a language you
 have never heard.

 You can also see five flash grenades and a cloak of shadows here.

 Phantasmagoria
 This huge hall is filled with the radiant images of warriors long dead,
 fighting their bloody battles over and over again. You see vast armies
 of skeletons clash while their masters pray for the help of forbidden
 deities -- but the scene changes before you can focus on any details.

 Exits lead south (to Hall of Mirrors), east (to Drawing Room), west (to
 Temple of Isatzo) and up (to Workshop of the Blademaster).

>status
 Attack: 3
 Defence: 9
 Perception: 5
 Dexterity: 5

 You have visited the following rooms: Entrance Hall (south), Hall of
 Mirrors (south), Phantasmagoria (here), Temple of Isatzo (west),
 Workshop of the Blademaster (up), Alchemical Laboratory (south), Portal
 Room (south), Library (south), Drawing Room (east).

 You have seen the following creatures in these locations:

 - Fafhrd (level 0) in Library (which lies south from here)
 - Mouser (level 0) in Library (which lies south from here)
 - Bodmall (level 4) in Workshop of the Blademaster (which lies up from
 here)

 Tip: you can "pray" in any temple.

>go east
 Drawing Room
 This otherwise unremarkable room has been decorated with a fascinating
 drawing.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 The room is dominated by a chain golem, a moving mass of iron and
 copper chains, both thick and thin, that hulks in its center.

 You can also see a scroll labelled TWAN METIER here.

 Exits lead south (to Entrance Hall), west (to Phantasmagoria) and down.

 The rusted chain golem starts rotating slowly, spinning its chains
 around its core.

>concentrate

 As rust spores whirl around the room, the dagger of draining rusts.

 The rusted chain golem speeds up, its chains whirling through the air.

 As rust spores whirl around the room, Fafhrd's sword rusts.

 As rust spores whirl around the room, the crown of the empire rusts.

>concentrate

 The rusted chain golem spins even faster, audibly slashing the air with
 its whip-like metal appendages.

>attack
 The chain golem lashes out with a heavy iron chain, trying to stop the
 attack.

 You attempt to duck under the whirling chains. You roll 8 + 5
 (dexterity score) = 13 against a target number of 10, succeeding at the
 dexterity check.

 Rolling 3 + 3 (inherent bonus) + 4 (concentration) - 2 (defender
 parrying) + 3 (tension) = 11, you beat the rusted chain golem's defence
 rating of 8.

 You deal 5 + 2 (concentration) + 2 (tension) + 1 (inherent bonus) = 10
 damage, wounding the rusted chain golem to 6 health.

 Unbalanced by the hit, the chain golem stops spinning.

 The rusted chain golem starts rotating slowly, spinning its chains
 around its core.

>attack
 The rusted chain golem speeds up, its chains whirling through the air.

 You attempt to duck under the whirling chains. You roll 9 + 5
 (dexterity score) = 14 against a target number of 9, succeeding at the
 dexterity check.

 Rolling 9 + 3 (inherent bonus) + 1 (tension) = 13, you beat the rusted
 chain golem's defence rating of 8.

 You deal 5 + 1 (tension) + 1 (inherent bonus) + 3 (power of the ape) =
 10 damage, killing the rusted chain golem.

 The chains lash out one final time, blindly seeking prey -- but fall
 down limply before they can hit anyone. With thousands of hard metal
 clicks they start falling asunder.

 As the chain golem bursts apart into its constituent links, you feel
 the soul that animated it absorbed into your own body. (Power of the
 chains: +2 attack, +2 damage, +1 defence, +12 health, and the lash
 skill.)

 The violence of the absorption drives the power of the ape out of your
 body. Absorbing a soul has fully healed you.

 Ever since, pilgrims have flocked to Montenoir's temple of Nomos to see
 and revere it. How it has ended up in this dungeon is anyone's guess.

 bad at parrying; better tension damage bonus.

 Quartering Room
 The smell of decay here is overwhelming. A large pile of human body
 parts lies in a corner.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 A skull-sized ball of gooish, undulating flesh jumps up and down
 ponderously. It is a jumping bomb, gathering speed and preparing to
 launch itself at one of its enemies.

 An exit leads up (to Drawing Room).

>attack bomb

 Rolling 7 + 4 (inherent bonus) - 2 (defender dodging) = 9, you beat the
 jumping bomb's defence rating of 8.

 You deal 2 + 2 (inherent bonus) = 4 damage, wounding the jumping bomb
 to 8 health.

>attack bomb

 Rolling 1 + 4 (inherent bonus) - 2 (defender dodging) = 3, you do not
 overcome the jumping bomb's defence rating of 8.

 As rust spores whirl around the room, the gilded rapier rusts.

 The jumping bomb jumps up and down a little bit faster.

 The jumping bomb speeds up, and is now bumping around energetically.

>attack bomb

 Rolling 2 + 4 (inherent bonus) - 2 (defender dodging) + 2 (tension) - 2
 (speed of the jumping bomb) = 4, you do not overcome the jumping bomb's
 defence rating of 8.

 The jumping bomb accelerates yet further, your image of it dissolving
 almost into a blur.

 Suddenly changing its direction, the jumping bomb launches itself
 towards you -- threatening instant death upon contact.

>dodge

 Rolling 2 - 2 (inherent penalty) + 8 (concentration) - 3 (defender
 dodging) + 3 (tension) - 6 (lower concentration bonus for jumping bomb)
 = 2, the jumping bomb does not overcome your defence rating of 9.

>concentrate

>concentrate

 The jumping bomb jumps up and down a little bit faster.

>attack bomb

 Rolling 10 + 4 (inherent bonus) + 4 (concentration) - 2 (defender
 dodging) + 5 (tension) - 1 (speed of the jumping bomb) = 20, you beat
 the jumping bomb's defence rating of 8.

 You deal 5 + 2 (concentration) + 3 (tension) + 2 (inherent bonus) - 2
 (rust) = 10 damage, killing the jumping bomb.

 As the last of its blood flows out of the jumping bomb, it goes limp
 and falls to the floor like a punctured balloon.

 As the bomb deflates, you feel its insane, beastly soul absorbed into
 your own body. (Power of the bomb: +2 attack, +2 defence, +10 health,
 and you will now explode when killed, giving you a last chance to
 defeat your enemy and perhaps absorb his soul in the process.)

 The violence of the absorption drives the power of the chains out of
 your body. Absorbing a soul has fully healed you.

 project a red light far too bright for the eyes of a human.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 Exits lead north (to Drawing Room), south (to Alchemical Laboratory),
 west (to Hall of Mirrors) and up (to Portal Room).

 Clouds of rust spores drift into the room.

>spray fungicide

 of skeletons clash while their masters pray for the help of forbidden
 deities -- but the scene changes before you can focus on any details.

 Mirrors surround you on all sides in an impossible geometry. Myriad
 reflections follow your every movement -- though some, always in the
 corner of your eyes, seem to behave differently.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 Tip: if a fight proves too much for you, try to "retreat". On entering
 a room for the first time, you can always retreat for free.

>go north
 Phantasmagoria
 This huge hall is filled with the radiant images of warriors long dead,
 fighting their bloody battles over and over again. You see a heavily
 muscled barbarian succumbing to the fiery breath of a dragon -- but the
 scene changes before you can focus on any details.

 The air is full of the tiny brown spores of the rust moss.

 Exits lead south (to Hall of Mirrors), east (to Drawing Room), west (to

 have never heard.

 You can also see five flash grenades and a cloak of shadows here.

 Exits lead north, south (to Library) and down (to Phantasmagoria).

 Bodmall chants loudly, and her skin transforms and toughens. It now
 looks like the bark of a tree.

>go north

 Rolling 1 + 5 (inherent bonus) + 1 (tension) + 4 (you are running) =
 11, Bodmall beats your defence rating of 10.

 Bodmall deals 1 + 2 (you are running) = 3 damage, wounding you to 5
 health.

 Bridge of Doom
 You stand on an exceedingly narrow bridge crossing a seething lake of
 lava. Dodging would be suicidal.

 Thin clouds of smoke and tiny brown spores of the rust moss fill the
 room.

 Exits lead north and south (to Workshop of the Blademaster).

>go north
 Hall of Vapours
 Several large pipes continuously spew forth vapours into this room.

 Thick clouds of smoke and tiny brown spores of the rust moss fill the
 room.

 Malygris, perhaps the greatest of all living sorcerers, is standing
 here.

 You can also see an unguentum argenti, the robe of the dead mage, a
 rusted magical spade and the rusted Blessed Grenade here.

 An exit leads south (to Bridge of Doom).

>examine blessed

 instance.

>attack malygris
 empire, but the object resists!

 Rolling 3 + 4 (inherent bonus) - 3 (executioner's axe penalty) - 1

 Bodmall chants softly, and great clouds of fog or smoke rise up from
 the ground.

 Rolling 5 + 5 (inherent bonus) + 1 (tension) - 1 (smoke) - 3 (running
 covered by smoke) + 4 (you are running) = 11, Bodmall beats your
 defence rating of 10.

 Bodmall deals 8 + 2 (you are running) = 10 damage, killing you.


 Bodmall kneels over your corpse. "Death is but a stage in the cycle of
 Nature," she says.

 Your body explodes vehemently, but Bodmall survives the blast.

 The demonic assassin arrives from below.



     *** You were killed by Bodmall. ***


 In that game you scored 6 out of a possible 18, in 143 turns.
