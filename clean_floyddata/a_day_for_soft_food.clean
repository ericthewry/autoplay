                         A Day for Soft Food


                      [ Press a key to begin. ]








 Ever since the Provider's sickness began, he's been all hisses and
 growls. Even the slightest misstep annoys him. Maybe that's why your
 bowl has held nothing but hard food lately. And not much of that.

 You awaken to a faint twitter. Perhaps a trick of the rising light,
 you pinpoint a fluttering shape. Your quickened breath frosts the
 window pane, the dawn promising no ordinary day.

 On the Sill
 Opposite a billowy wall, a window looks east over a snowy landscape.
 Although the window's light warms you, a cold breeze emanates from its
 base.

>examine me

 You hear snoring to the west.

 To the east, a shape flutters out of view.

>examine shape
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east
 You bump your nose on the glass.

 You hear snoring to the west.

 Your stomach growls.

 your dark fur is well-groomed.

 Opposite a billowy wall, a window looks east over a snowy landscape.
 Although the window's light warms you, a cold breeze emanates from its
 base.

 You hear snoring to the west.

>go west
 You nose your way under the billowy wall...

 Blankets
 You enjoy curling up in the blankets' warm folds, though when the
 Provider is here, you do so with care. He is mean enough when
 un-provoked, and does not appreciate being woken. A cord hangs beside
 a billowy wall to the east. A mingling of faded scents lure you
 northward.

 The Provider snores beside you.

>meow
 You mew loudly, plaintively.

 The Provider grumbles as he rises from the blankets and seizes you by
 the scruff of the neck. Moments later, you find yourself tumbling head
 over heels into a bank of snow. You hear the latch click inside the
 cottage, knowing you've been sentenced to a day in the cold--hardly
 bearable without even the hope of soft food.


     *** You have wasted the day. ***


 In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 100, in 9 turns, earning
 you the rank of pussyfooter.

>examine provider
 The Provider lies asleep on his side. He faces east, snorfling loudly.

 Your stomach growls.

>pull cord
 You tentatively paw at the cord, then reconsider. Idle play this close
 to the Provider may have serious consequences. [You have been warned.]

 The Provider snores beside you.

>play with cord
 With a deft swat of your paw, you tug on the cord. The billowy wall
 parts, and a stream of sunlight illuminates the blankets below. His
 face bathed in light, the Provider blinks and stirs. He notices you
 standing suspiciously beside the swaying cord.

 The Provider grumbles as he rises from the blankets and seizes you by
 the scruff of the neck. Moments later, you find yourself tumbling head
 over heels into a bank of snow. You hear the latch click inside the

>go north

 Food Room
 Here the Provider divines food from the cupboard's magic containers,
 and prepares it on the ledge above you like only a Provider can. It
 seems that all roads lead to your food bowl: there's an alcove to the
 west, a small flap northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile
 of blankets southward.

 On the floor, lies your food bowl, as bare and empty as your stomach.

 A DAY FOR SOFT FOOD is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives
 long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>examine cupboard
 You might be able to open the cupboard above you.

>open it
 You pry open the cupboard with your paw.

>search it
 You might be able to enter the cupboard above you.

>enter it
 You leap up into the cupboard...

 Food Room (in the cupboard)
 Within the close, heavy shadows, it's difficult to separate the
 commingled scents. Most of the arranged boxes appear to contain a
 Provider version of hard food. Indeed, your very own monstrous sack of
 hard food stands nearby.

 On the floor, lies your food bowl, as bare and empty as your stomach.

>chew bag
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>bite bag
 You scratch futilely at the monstrous sack.

>open bag
 The sack is too tightly bound.

 Your stomach gurgles and groans.

>examine sack
 The monstrous sack contains a seemlingly limitless supply of hard
 food.

>push sack
>push sack
 The sack plummets to the floor, exploding loudly on impact. You marvel
 at the tremendous mountain of hard food below, as does your Provider,
 who arrives shortly. Waving away the clouds of dust, he seizes you by
 the scruff of the neck. Moments later, you land in a bank of snow,
 hear the latch click, and know you'll be spending a day in the cold,
 without food of any kind.


     *** You have wasted the day. ***

 whiskers are grease-free and properly alligned.

>go north
 You duck through the flap in the front door...

 Clearing
 A tree stump pokes through the otherwise unbroken blanket of soft,
 powdery snow. A slatted fence traverses the snow to the north, while
 the cottage entrance lies southward.

 A yellow-feathered bird flies high above.

 An orange light rises in the east.

 Alas. It's high in the sky.

 Creeping forward, you attempt to conceal your dark fur in the shadows
 of the tree stump, but when you leap forward, the yellow-feathered
 bird easily anticipates you.

 The yellow-feathered bird flies off to the west.

 An axe is embedded in the stump.

 It makes up for the Provider's lack of sharp claws.

 That's hardly portable.

 The Provider snores beside you.

>go north

 Food Room
 Here the Provider divines food from the cupboard's magic containers,
 and prepares it on the ledge above you like only a Provider can. It
 seems that all roads lead to your food bowl: there's an alcove to the
 west, a small flap northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile
 of blankets southward.

 On the floor, lies your food bowl, as bare and empty as your stomach.

>examine bowl
 Checking your food bowl is your greatest pastime. On rare days, it
 contains soft food--dreamy blends of salmon and turkey giblets,
 chicken livers and beef, that the Provider scoops from flat, shiny
 eggs. More often, it contains hard food--dry, drab stuff from a
 monstrous sack. Unfortunately, your bowl is utterly empty.

>look under bowl
 You find nothing of interest.

>go east
 You leap up onto the lumpy mountain...

 Lumpy Mountain
 There is just enough room in this cozy corner for the lumpy mountain
 and the confusing black box that faces it. The lumpy mountain is home
 to some of your finest claw and scratch marks, though your Provider
 has never shared much enthusiasm for the art. The scent of your food
 bowl wafts in from the west.

 You can see a flannel shirt here.

>unravel shirt
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine shirt
 A bit smelly, perhaps, but you love to nap in its soft folds.

>examine box
 Two silvery antenae extend from this peculiar animal.

 You're beginning to feel dizzy.

>climb on box
 You wouldn't feel safe on the confusing box.

>pull shirt
 Nothing obvious happens.

>bite shirt
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>get shirt

 Dropped.

 You gingerly pick up the flannel shirt with your teeth.

>eat shirt
 That's plainly inedible.

>nap in shirt
 I only understood you as far as wanting to nap.

>enter shirt
 You can only get into something freestanding.

>drop shirt
 Dropped.

>enter shirt
 You get onto the flannel shirt.

>nap
 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west
 You'll have to get off the flannel shirt first.

>get off shirt

 You get off the flannel shirt.

 Lumpy Mountain
 There is just enough room in this cozy corner for the lumpy mountain
 and the confusing black box that faces it. The lumpy mountain is home
 to some of your finest claw and scratch marks, though your Provider
 has never shared much enthusiasm for the art. The scent of your food
 bowl wafts in from the west.

 You can see a flannel shirt and a yellow feather here.

 You're not going to be able to carry on without food.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>go up

>open cupboard
 You pry open the cupboard with your paw.

 Your hunger has become unbearable. With your last remaining energy you
 curl up to sleep. When you awake, night has fallen. You set out in
 search of the Provider, hoping for his kindness. If that fails, there
 are always insects.

 A rotting log lies half-exposed in the snow.

 You roll the log in front of you, carefull to avoid the gathering
 swarm of insects.

 Clearing
 A tree stump pokes through the otherwise unbroken blanket of soft,
 powdery snow. A slatted fence traverses the snow to the north, while
 the cottage entrance lies southward.

 The Provider would certainly be abuzz with gratitude if you could
 somehow manage to roll the log indoors.

 You roll the log in front of you, carefull to avoid the gathering

 Aspens
 Overlooked by a high window of the Provider's cottage, a trail follows

 Canopy Trail
 A north-south trail runs beneath a canopy of chestnut trees. You've
 seen giant glinting beasts stampede here, especially in the mornings
 and evenings. A lesser track leads east.

 You hear a distant rumbling approaching from the south.

 Food Room
 Here the Provider divines food from the cupboard's magic containers,
 and prepares it on the ledge above you like only a Provider can. It
 seems that all roads lead to your food bowl: there's an alcove to the
 west, a small flap northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile
 of blankets southward.

 On the floor, lies your food bowl, as bare and empty as your stomach.

 You leap up onto the lumpy mountain...

 Lumpy Mountain
 There is just enough room in this cozy corner for the lumpy mountain
 and the confusing black box that faces it. The lumpy mountain is home
 to some of your finest claw and scratch marks, though your Provider
 has never shared much enthusiasm for the art. The scent of your food
 bowl wafts in from the west.

 You can see a flannel shirt here.

 Your stomach aches with hunger.

 You achieve nothing by this.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 That's plainly inedible.

 A bit smelly, perhaps, but you love to nap in its soft folds.

 Blankets
 You enjoy curling up in the blankets' warm folds, though when the
 Provider is here, you do so with care. He is mean enough when
 un-provoked, and does not appreciate being woken. A cord hangs beside
 a billowy wall to the east. A mingling of faded scents lure you
 northward.

 The Provider snores beside you.

 You can't see any such thing.

>scratch provider
 You rake the Provider with your claws!

 The Provider grumbles as he rises from the blankets and seizes you by
 the scruff of the neck. Moments later, you find yourself tumbling head
 over heels into a bank of snow. You hear the latch click inside the
 cottage, knowing you've been sentenced to a day in the cold--hardly
 bearable without even the hope of soft food.

 On the Sill
 From the inner sill of a window, you look east over a snowy landscape.
 Although the window's light warms you, a cold breeze emanates from its
 base.

 You hear snoring to the west.

 You enjoy curling up in the blankets' warm folds. Light streams down

 Food Room
 Here the Provider divines food from the cupboard's magic containers,
 and prepares it on the ledge above you like only a Provider can. It
 seems that all roads lead to your food bowl: there's an alcove to the
 west, a small flap northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile
 of blankets southward.

 On the floor, lies your food bowl, as bare and empty as your stomach.

>go north
 You duck through the flap in the front door...

 Clearing
 A tree stump pokes through the otherwise unbroken blanket of soft,

 Lumpy Mountain
 There is just enough room in this cozy corner for the lumpy mountain
 and the confusing black box that faces it. The lumpy mountain is home
 to some of your finest claw and scratch marks, though your Provider
 has never shared much enthusiasm for the art. The scent of your food
 bowl wafts in from the west.

 You can see a flannel shirt here.

 Your hunger has become unbearable. With your last remaining energy you

 Food Room (in the cupboard)
 Within the close, heavy shadows, it's difficult to separate the

 The sack plummets to the floor, exploding loudly on impact. You marvel
 at the tremendous mountain of hard food below, as does your Provider,
 who arrives shortly. Waving away the clouds of dust, he seizes you by
 the scruff of the neck. Moments later, you land in a bank of snow,
 hear the latch click, and know you'll be spending a day in the cold,
 without food of any kind.

 to some of your finest claw and scratch marks, though your Provider
 has never shared much enthusiasm for the art. The scent of your food
 bowl wafts in from the west.

 You can see a flannel shirt here.

 The Provider lies here, gazing into the confusing box.

 Food Room
 Here the Provider divines food from the cupboard's magic containers,

 of blankets southward.

 On the floor, lies your food bowl, full of hard food.

 You can also see a yellow feather here.

 The Provider is fumbling with the front door.

 Aspens (on the aspen)
 The sky never seemed so vast, the wind so angry, the ground so remote.
 Facing upwards,  you cling with all four claws to a slender trunk.

 Caught in the branches of an aspen, is a red balloon.

 Food Room
 Here the Provider divines food from the cupboard's magic containers,
 and prepares it on the ledge above you like only a Provider can. It
 seems that all roads lead to your food bowl: there's an alcove to the
 west, a small flap northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile
 of blankets southward.

 On the floor, lies your food bowl, full of hard food.

 The Provider glares at you. You're not sure if this is because he fell
 into a snow hole, because you stole a strip of kindling, because you
 tracked snow into the cottage, because you failed to defend your food
 bowl, because you stirred up a swarm of insects, because he suspects
 you brought a bird into the house, because you mewed excessively, or

 The Provider's cottage is that way, but you can't enter it from here.

 You falter in the face of your Rival's ferocious charge. He pins you
 to the ground, mauling your face and underbelly. You struggle, but are
 helpless beneath him. You're dimly aware of him as he saunters away,
 leaving you for dead in the reddening snow. You only hope you freeze
 to death before the vermin and insects arrive.

 Your Rival cautiously sniffs the edge of the snow mound, hesitates,

 noise as the ground gives way beneath him, and he's swallowed by the

 Yowling horribly, and leaping from the hole, your Rival is pursued by
 an angry swarm. He dashes across the snowy plain, cries of agony
 echoing tree to tree. You savor the last reverberations of his anguish

 Beaneath Embankment

 You squeeze into a small opening...

 Darkness
 Through a network of burrows and tiny side-passages, a larger tunnel
 winds northward. Your whiskers indicate even it may be impassable. The
 air is scarce, the earth close and unstable. With no room to turn
 around, perhaps you should just back out the way you came in.

 reflect a sliver of light beneath a huge western door. Various cartons

 seems that all roads lead to your food bowl: there's an alcove to the
 west, a small flap northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile
 of blankets southward.

 You can see a yellow feather here.

 The Provider is turning blue.

>go north
 You duck through the flap in the front door...

 A tree stump pokes through the otherwise unbroken blanket of soft,
 powdery snow. A slatted fence traverses the snow to the north, while
 the cottage entrance lies southward.

>hit provider with kindling
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the Provider.

>hit provider
 First you take a tentative bite. Several more bites, and the Provider
 sleeps on. He's fairly tasty! Over the next few days, you manage to
 eat most of him. But when the insects arrive you flee to Rival's old
 wood to hunt fresh game. It's a savage fate for your poor master. But
 you have to admit that--even to the bitter end--he was always a
 Provider.

 There is just enough room in this cozy corner for the lumpy mountain

 singed.

 Soon a great mewing beast arrives to fight the flames. It seems that
 everyone in the valley comes to watch the inferno that was your home.
 You slink guiltily into the woods, surprised at how deeply you miss
 your Provider.

 Your fallen Provider lies oddly still.








 As the figure steps through the door, he turns toward your fallen
 Provider, and hurries to his side. A short while later, a loud and
 horrible mewing approaches, and the white-furred ones come to take
 your Provider away. You're sorry to see him go. He was all hisses and
 growls, but he was a Provider nonetheless.

 You eventually devour the mountain of hard food, and take to Rival's
 old wood. As the weeks pass, you hunt with greater relish; in the
 shadows, or from an overhanging limb, you watch and you wait with
 heightened senses. One day, having nearly forgotten him, you spy your
 Provider rolling into the cottage on a shiny stool. He no longer
 grunts or glares at you; instead, he sits all day on his shiny stool,
 gazing sadly into the confusing box.

 As winter warms over, the Provider begins to invite you onto his lap
 for a ride to the aspens, or through the ferns emerging on the forest
 floor. You hunt the golden-feathered bird and chase new rivals from
 across the stream. He strokes your fur, even croons to you. During
 such moments, you do something you haven't done in a long time. You
 purr.
