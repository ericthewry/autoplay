 Sigh. In retrospect, admitting yourself to this overseas sanitarium
 was a bad idea. The grounds here are beautiful, and the food is
 divine, but you're becoming impatient with the doctorsâdoctors whose
 techniques could be charitably described as "unorthodox." Very little
 psychotherapy, and a bit too much word play. In any case, your
 disabling malaise has proven unshakeable.

 Today, you face your final evaluation with Dr. Schuyler. If you pass,
 you'll be able to leave this place, perhaps to renew your attempts at
 recuperation elsewhere. If you fail, the doctors might recommend that
 you remain...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Therapist's Office</span>
 You find yourself, once again, in Dr. Schuyler's spacious and
 tastefully decorated office.

 The doctor is here. He holds a clipboard and a pen, and sits in his
 chair with impeccable posture. "Let's begin your evaluation," he says,
 and turns over a nearby egg timer.

 The doctor asks, "Would you describe yourself as feeling...
 <span class="floydstyle i">cold</span>?"

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You've been preparing for this. You must respond by saying NO I'M</span>

 It's Tuesday, 7:39 PM exactly. I clock off at eight. Until then, I'm
 stuck at the checkout.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">If I Wasn't Shy</span>
 A lifetime of shyness by Joey Jones
 Release 1 / Serial number 120324 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Checkout (on the stool)</span>
 I'm sitting on a hard stool, back slouched, fingertips poised to grasp
 dog food cans and punch in numbers on the register. Really though it's
 so quiet I mostly just look out the window. The big clock above the
 intercom speakers ticks slowly.

 Before me are the many aisles of the supermarket.

>examine me


 I'm me, you know? I have to wear this stupid oversized red uniform
 with the little "Ask Me" button.

 "This week only: loin of pork, 79 cents per pound," intones the
 sonorous announcer over the intercom.

>burn button


 (the "Ask Me" button)
 I can just imagine the way the little laminate would crinkle and warp
 under the flame. I would you know, I really would.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks, 89 cents a pound," our master of
 ceremony continues.

>examine clock


 The big clock never seems to move when I look at it. It says it's
 about twenty to eight.

>inventory


 I am carrying:
   a "Ask Me" button (being worn)
   a red uniform (being worn)
   a lighter
   a pack of cigarettes
   a time clock card

 "Lean boiled ham, 99 cents a pound."

>examine window


 Outside the window, all I can see is somebody's Cadillac parked up
 close.

 I spot the nurse, the one from the psychiatric hospital, the one that
 always buys his groceries here.

>remove button


 (the "Ask Me" button)
 I never take it off the uniform, I might lose it and then they'd make
 me pay for a replacement.

 "Fresh frying chickens, 29 cents a pound!"

>smoke


 (the canned goods)
 One day, when I'm <span class="floydstyle em">all alone</span> I might burn the whole place
 down.

 Mildred starts her shift, 7:45 on the dot; she's sitting at the
 checkout right in front of me.

>examine nurse


 The nurse is a short, slim man, with the sort of face that can pull
 off looking deathly tired without coming across too badly: some men
 turn into almost skeletal trogdolytes, or the black eyes make them
 look like bare-knuckle boxers. This guy though, he just comes across
 as a nice man who doesn't get enough sleep.

 A married couple walk by, the older end of middle-aged.
 "You're not worth the powder to blow you to hell," she says.
 "I know dear," he says.

>examine cigarettes


 I never used to smoke. I just started one day, you know? Everyone else
 was doing it, and-- well, I need <span class="floydstyle em">something</span> to spend my money
 on.

 The married couple walk off into the canned goods aisle; the man
 secretively wiping his nose upon his sleeve.

>examine cadillac


 The cadillac is bright red and always seems to be sitting out there.
 Somedays I dream about taking it for a spin.

 "Fresh ground beef, 49 cents a pound."

>examine mildred


 "Mildred", the name sounds like industrial malaise. She's prettier
 than all that. Well, I suppose she must be. Most of what I ever see of
 her is the points of her shoulder blades seen through the fabric of
 the ugly red uniform we have to wear. Except the MC on the intercom. I
 know for a fact he wears a suit.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks at 89 cents per pound!"

>examine aisles


 There are dozens of aisles in the Garden Mart. My eye catches on the
 fresh zucchinis.

 "Fresh frying chickens, 29 cents a pound!" He's repeating himself. He
 must be repeating himself.

>examine zucchinis


 I can't stand zucchinis. When I was a kid we never had any money and
 all I remember being fed was different kinds of squash and canned food
 from the church.

 "Fresh frozen hot house garden peas, 3 packages for 69 cents."

>examine lighter


 It's a cheap plastic lighter. I use it for burning things when
 nobody's about. I bought it from this store. I didn't use my discount:
 they don't really like us using it for that sort of thing.

 Our self-styled master of ceremonies ends on an incredulous note:
 "Juicy Florida Oranges: ten for 69 cents!"

>examine clock card


 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the big clock.

>burn zucchinis


 One day, when I'm <span class="floydstyle em">all alone</span> I might burn the whole place
 down.

 The nurse has got all his shopping done and he's walking towards me.

>examine card


 It's a small punch card. It gets put in a little slot when I
 <span class="floydstyle em">leave</span> the store.

 The nurse turns at the last moment, checking out with Mildred.

>smile


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>flip off nurse


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine aisles


 There are dozens of aisles in the Garden Mart. My eye catches on the
 pork loins.

 Sentimental strains of a canned orchestra flow out the in-store
 speakers.

>examine loins


 The Garden Mart even sells pork loins. I'm not sure I'd want to eat
 anything called "pork loins". Only pepper-steak could be worse. Or
 liver, I guess. Kidneys? Yeah that'd be pretty gross.

 The couple emerge from the aisles to browse the cigar stand in front
 of me.
 "...to err is human," the husband replies to something I didn't quite
 catch.
 "Not in my book." She hits him with her handbag.

>kiss mildred


 Oh Mildred, I can hardly picture her face: her back is all I see. It's
 a very pretty back. I mean, from what I can make out. I
 <span class="floydstyle em">assume</span> that it's pretty. I guess it could be hideous really.
 There could be acne or something. No, I don't think that's true. I bet
 her back would be nice to kiss. Am I really thinking that? That's
 pretty weird.

 "Get some instant dog food," the wife says.
 "Yes dear."
 "It's for you, you mutt!"
 And they split off in two different directions, her towards the meat
 counter, him towards the pets aisle.

>smoke cigarette


 One of these days I'm going to light up a cigarette and stroll right
 outta here.

 The string section of the canned orchestra reach new heights of
 inoffensive whimsy.

>stop being so damned shy


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>mildred, hello


 (talking to Mildred)
 It's funny, we've both been working at the store for nearly six months
 now and I've never said a word to her. Actually, thinking about it,
 that's not that funny.

 The nurse leaves the shop, bag in hand.

>ask mildred for kiss


 I can't see any such thing.

>ask mildred about herself


 (talking to Mildred)
 I mean, there are many things I'd like to ask her. But I never have.

 Hmmm... it's time to clock out.

>clock out


 I shuffle over to the exit. Another day done. Until tomorrow. One of
 these days I'll do something big for sure. But not today.

 I'm sitting on a hard stool, back slouched, fingertips poised to grasp

 quiet I mostly just look out the window. The big clock above the

 Before me are the many aisles of the supermarket.

>get up


 Alas! It's not yet time to leave work.

 "This week only: loin of pork, 79 cents per pound," intones the
 sonorous announcer over the intercom.

>burn it to the ground


 I'm not sure what "it" refers to.

>clock out


 I really can't leave early. Not that anyone would notice.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks, 89 cents a pound," our master of
 ceremony continues.

>burn card


 Aw, I need this for clocking out. I'll not get paid otherwise. But I
 totally would burn it otherwise.

 "Lean boiled ham, 99 cents a pound."

>remove dress


 I can't see any such thing.

 I'm not that kind of person. Am I? I hope not.

 I spot the nurse, the one from the psychiatric hospital, the one that

 Mildred starts her shift, 7:45 on the dot; she's sitting at the
 checkout right in front of me.

>remove uniform


 Here? Oh no! The very thought of it! I can barely stand to get
 undressed in the company of myself.

 A married couple walk by, the older end of middle-aged.
 "You're not worth the powder to blow you to hell," she says.
 "I know dear," he says.

>burn couple


 One day maybe. But, um, not today.

 The married couple walk off into the canned goods aisle; the man
 secretively wiping his nose upon his sleeve.

>examine canned goods


 I hate stacking cans. It's just so repetitive. Everything here is just
 so repetitive. Maybe it's a Tuesday. Maybe it's July. It could be a
 Friday in October. I just live out the same day with minor variations.
 Sometimes I focus in on those variations. Concentrate on the specific
 gradation of feeling. Mostly I just sit at the checkout.

 "Fresh ground beef, 49 cents a pound."

>get can


 Nobody's brought any food to the checkout, and as much as I'd like to
 I'm not going to steal the canned goods.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks at 89 cents per pound!"

>examine checkout


 I can't see any such thing.

>buy steak


 The surloin steaks aren't up to my usual standards.

 "Fresh frying chickens, 29 cents a pound!" He's repeating himself. He
 must be repeating himself.

>buy chicken


 The chicken strips aren't up to my usual standards.

 "Fresh frozen hot house garden peas, 3 packages for 69 cents."

>examine peas


 They sell packs of peas for 23 cents when you get three. I sometimes
 bring a few packs home for Mom. I don't really like them but Kid Blast
 loves spoonfuls of honey and peas.

 Our self-styled master of ceremonies ends on an incredulous note:
 "Juicy Florida Oranges: ten for 69 cents!"

>push oranges


 Nothing obvious happens.

 The nurse has got all his shopping done and he's walking towards me.

>talk to nurse


 I know he works at the psychiatric hospital, he must be fascinating to
 talk to. Of course I haven't, and I probably won't.

 The nurse turns at the last moment, checking out with Mildred.

 speakers.

 I'm really not a song and dance kind of person.

 The couple emerge from the aisles to browse the cigar stand in front
 of me.
 "...to err is human," the husband replies to something I didn't quite

 "Not in my book." She hits him with her handbag.

>talk to couple


 I'd rather not speak to either of them!

 "Get some instant dog food," the wife says.

 "It's for you, you mutt!"
 And they split off in two different directions, her towards the meat

 There is hardly anyone here, plus no supervisor...

 I will have to get off the stool first.

>get off stool


 A minute early! Take that price-of-beef announcer! Take that
 supervisors! Hah! Um... I hope nobody sees this...

 I shuffle over to the exit. Another day done. Until tomorrow. One of
 these days I'll do something big for sure. But not today.

 It's Tuesday, 7:39 PM exactly. I clock off at eight. Until then, I'm
 stuck at the checkout.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Checkout (on the stool)</span>
 I'm sitting on a hard stool, back slouched, fingertips poised to grasp
 Florida oranges and punch in numbers on the register. Really though
 it's so quiet I mostly just look out the window. The big clock above
 the intercom speakers ticks slowly.

 Before me are the many aisles of the supermarket.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Checkout (on the stool)</span>
 I'm still sitting on the stool, fingertips poised to grasp pork loins
 and punch in numbers on the register. Really though it's so quiet I
 mostly just look out the window. The big clock above the intercom
 speakers ticks slowly.

 Before me are the many aisles of the supermarket.

 "This week only: loin of pork, 79 cents per pound," intones the
 sonorous announcer over the intercom.

>examine oranged


 I can't see any such thing.

>examine oranges


 The oranges come direct from Florida. Well, I mean, we get them via a
 supplier who gets them straight from Florida. I sometimes help unload
 the pallets, but they don't ask me to do it that often.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks, 89 cents a pound," our master of
 ceremony continues.

>examine register


 The register is covered in numbers and has a lever on the side for
 opening up the drawer.

 "Lean boiled ham, 99 cents a pound."

>punch numbers


 I'm really not the violent sort.

 I spot the nurse, the one from the psychiatric hospital, the one that
 always buys his groceries here.

>pull lever


 The drawer springs open with a satisfying ker-ching sound, revealing
 lots of cash within.

 "Fresh frying chickens, 29 cents a pound!"

>steal cash


 I dream about doing that most every day. But I don't. But then...

 Mildred starts her shift, 7:45 on the dot; she's sitting at the
 checkout right in front of me.

>examine drawer


 The drawer has been sprung open. I'm not really supposed to be doing
 this when there's no customers.

 In the drawer is lots of cash.

 A married couple walk by, the older end of middle-aged.
 "You're not worth the powder to blow you to hell," she says.
 "I know dear," he says.

>examine wife


 She's got pinched features from a lifetime of mean-natured suspicious.
 Her eyes have a way of looking down at a person even though her height
 means she's invariable looking up.

 The married couple walk off into the canned goods aisle; the man
 secretively wiping his nose upon his sleeve.

>take cash


 I guess I could get away with it. Oh, no.

 "Fresh ground beef, 49 cents a pound."

>examine window


 Outside the window, all I can see is somebody's Cadillac parked up
 close.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks at 89 cents per pound!"

>steal cadillac


 Maybe, maybe if I was all alone, late at night and I had all the right
 tools. Yeah maybe I could steal it.

 "Fresh frying chickens, 29 cents a pound!" He's repeating himself. He
 must be repeating himself.

>get cash


 Or maybe yes? I don't have a supervisor.

 "Fresh frozen hot house garden peas, 3 packages for 69 cents."

>get cash


 No, the customers would see and report me. Not that they're paying any
 attention to me.

 Our self-styled master of ceremonies ends on an incredulous note:
 "Juicy Florida Oranges: ten for 69 cents!"

>get cash


 With this kind of money, I could skip town, but where would I go?

 The nurse has got all his shopping done and he's walking towards me.

>get cash


 Maybe my cousin Vinnie would put me up, he wouldn't mind harboring a
 fugitive.

 The nurse turns at the last moment, checking out with Mildred.

>wave


 Reminds me of the time someone waved to me across the street. I
 plucked up the courage to wave back, but turns out they were waving to
 the girl behind me.

 Sentimental strains of a canned orchestra flow out the in-store
 speakers.

>pull lever


 The drawer's already open.

 The couple emerge from the aisles to browse the cigar stand in front
 of me.
 "...to err is human," the husband replies to something I didn't quite
 catch.
 "Not in my book." She hits him with her handbag.

>get cash


 But Vinnie does have a huge mouth on him, he'd tell Aunt Pam and she'd
 tell <span class="floydstyle em">everyone</span>.

 "Get some instant dog food," the wife says.
 "Yes dear."
 "It's for you, you mutt!"
 And they split off in two different directions, her towards the meat
 counter, him towards the pets aisle.

>get cash


 If I was a fugitive I could do whatever I wanted. I'd steal somebody's
 Cadillac, I'd steal anything I lacked!

 The string section of the canned orchestra reach new heights of
 inoffensive whimsy.

>get cash


 No, I'm too shy to be a fugitive. I don't think I can take the money.

 The nurse leaves the shop, bag in hand.

>get cash


 What would Mildred think if she knew I was some kind of thief? I
 couldn't take the money.

 Hmmm... it's time to clock out.

>get cash


 But I've never spoken to Mildred, what does she care?

 I really should <span class="floydstyle em">leave</span>.

>get cash


 I could, I could speak to Mildred or even that nice Nurse. But then,
 if I took the money I wouldn't have to speak to anyone.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

>get cash


 Is that a good thing? I'm not sure. The choice just seems so
 irrevocable. Just the thought of it makes me feel a little sick.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

>get cash


 No. I'm not going to take the money. But I know that there's a small
 part of me that would love to.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

>get cash


 I remember the bravest thing I ever did, I was playing on railway
 sidings as a kid, and I heard the rails hum way before I saw the train
 coming. Without even thinking about it, I ran and jumped into rail
 side bushes.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

>get cash


 But that's not like stealing money, and besides, it was another three
 minutes before the train actually came. I was just overreacting.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

 I'm not hanging around here any longer!

 I shuffle over to the exit. Another day done. Until tomorrow. One of
 these days I'll do something big for sure. But not today.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Checkout (on the stool)</span>
 I'm sitting on a hard stool, back slouched, fingertips poised to grasp
 someone's rutabaga and punch in numbers on the register. Really though
 it's so quiet I mostly just look out the window. The big clock above
 the intercom speakers ticks slowly.

>pull lever
>burn uniform


 The drawer springs open with a satisfying ker-ching sound, revealing
 lots of cash within.

 "This week only: loin of pork, 79 cents per pound," intones the
 sonorous announcer over the intercom.



 When I stop working here I'll do it. I'll make a bonfire and throw it
 on.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks, 89 cents a pound," our master of
 ceremony continues.

>burn button


 (the "Ask Me" button)
 I can just imagine the way the little laminate would crinkle and warp
 under the flame. I would you know, I really would.

 "Lean boiled ham, 99 cents a pound."

>burn intercom


 I don't think the intercom system is flammable, but I guess it would
 go if I torched the whole building. I'd have to pour gasoline all over
 the place. It wouldn't be that hard to do, if I broke in at two in the
 morning. They don't have shutters, and smashing the glass wouldn't be
 that hard if I took a brick... Oh look another minute has gone by!

 I spot the nurse, the one from the psychiatric hospital, the one that
 always buys his groceries here.

>burn customers


 I can't see any such thing.

>talk to nurse


 I know he works at the psychiatric hospital, he must be fascinating to
 talk to. Of course I haven't, and I probably won't.

 "Fresh frying chickens, 29 cents a pound!"

>ask mildred for kiss


 I can't see any such thing.

>kiss mildred


 I can't see any such thing.

>kiss nurse


 I mean, I've often thought about it. I bet he'd be quite nice to kiss,
 he's got soft looking lips. I wonder if he uses lip gloss? That
 doesn't seem likely. But then, he's in a caring profession, so it's
 not that out of the question. Is that a sexist thing to think? But I
 bet it would be nice.
 Eww... the very though of it!

 Mildred starts her shift, 7:45 on the dot; she's sitting at the
 checkout right in front of me.

>burn card


 Aw, I need this for clocking out. I'll not get paid otherwise. But I
 totally would burn it otherwise.

 A married couple walk by, the older end of middle-aged.
 "You're not worth the powder to blow you to hell," she says.
 "I know dear," he says.

>burn couple


 One day maybe. But, um, not today.

 The married couple walk off into the canned goods aisle; the man
 secretively wiping his nose upon his sleeve.

>bark


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>kiss couple


 I can only do that to something animate.

>burn me


 I'm not that kind of person. Am I? I hope not.

 "Fresh ground beef, 49 cents a pound."

>examine intercom


 The master of ceremonies in his booth announces the deals of the day.
 He gets to clock off before me.

 "Delicious tender surloin steaks at 89 cents per pound!"

>vomit


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>cry


 Some days I almost do, but I haven't yet cried in store.

>steal microphone


 Oh I couldn't do that. I mean, of course I guess I could do that, but
 I won't.

 "Fresh frying chickens, 29 cents a pound!" He's repeating himself. He
 must be repeating himself.

>inventory


 I am carrying:
   a "Ask Me" button (being worn)
   a red uniform (being worn)
   a lighter
   a pack of cigarettes
   a time clock card

 "Fresh frozen hot house garden peas, 3 packages for 69 cents."

 Our self-styled master of ceremonies ends on an incredulous note:
 "Juicy Florida Oranges: ten for 69 cents!"

>scream


 I could never be so loud or brash. That just isn't me.

>steal


 (the canned goods)
 Nobody's brought any food to the checkout, and as much as I'd like to
 I'm not going to steal the canned goods.

 The nurse has got all his shopping done and he's walking towards me.

>curse


 I sometimes curse under my breath. You know, when I stub a toe or
 something.

 The nurse turns at the last moment, checking out with Mildred.

>check out nurse


 I only understood you as far as wanting to check outside.

>steal nurse


 Oh I couldn't do that.

 Sentimental strains of a canned orchestra flow out the in-store
 speakers.

>turn off intercom


 They're not something I can switch.

 The couple emerge from the aisles to browse the cigar stand in front
 of me.
 "...to err is human," the husband replies to something I didn't quite

 "Not in my book." She hits him with her handbag.

 The string section of the canned orchestra reach new heights of
 inoffensive whimsy.

 In the drawer is lots of cash.

 The nurse leaves the shop, bag in hand.

>look under drawer


 I find nothing of interest.

 Hmmm... it's time to clock out.

>ask mildred for a kiss


 I can't see any such thing.

>kiss mildred


 Oh Mildred, I can hardly picture her face: her back is all I see. It's
 a very pretty back. I mean, from what I can make out. I
 <span class="floydstyle em">assume</span> that it's pretty. I guess it could be hideous really.
 There could be acne or something. No, I don't think that's true. I bet
 her back would be nice to kiss. Am I really thinking that? That's
 pretty weird.

 I really should <span class="floydstyle em">leave</span>.

>again


 I've never even <span class="floydstyle em">talked</span> to her. First things first.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

 I've never even <span class="floydstyle em">talked</span> to her. First things first.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

>talk to mildred


 It's funny, we've both been working at the store for nearly six months
 now and I've never said a word to her. Actually, thinking about it,
 that's not that funny.

 I don't have to be here anymore.

>talk to mildred


 I mean, there are many things I'd like to ask her. But I never have.

 You're having an invigorating conversation on your morning jog. At any
 rate, you're more invigorated than the lazybones on the other end of
 the cell phone who's barely up yet. You're so interested in your
 conversation you don't notice the skull on the ground. Or the
 passenger train whooshing past with no tracks to guide it, people
 hanging their heads out. Things got weird, and there's no obvious way
 back.

 <span class="floydstyle header">Turn Around</span>
 Turn Around -- Episode 15 of the Apollo 18 Tribute Album by Andrew
 Schultz
 Release 1 / Serial number 120416 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Origin</span>
 You're in some sort of weird outdoor classroom. It's got a huge
 chalkboard to the north. There are paths in all the other standard
 cardinal directions, but you don't know if you're brave enough to
 travel all of them. Certainly not backwards. You don't want to turn
 around. You don't feel you have the right to, yet.

 There is a boggle box sticking out at your chest's height from the
 blackboard. It's the only adornment--no chalk, no ledge to put the
 chalk on for the chalkboard behind it.

 The ghost of the guy you killed--well, someone said you killed him,
 but there're no charges, and you never touched him--is here. He banged
 his head theatrically when you asked him why he bothered with those
 silly old logic puzzles--then the train you both were taking to work
 lurched, and, boom.

 He could have at least called you up instead of freaking you out like
 this.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[To see a list of commands specific to this game, type COMMANDS.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Or you can just enter a verb that doesn't work. Oh, you can also type</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">ABOUT and CREDITS for people the author wishes to thank.]</span>

>examine box

 It's about three feet wide by a foot tall, with four small cubical
 nooks labeled a/b/c/d. The words "Box of Tangents" are engraved over
 the four nooks, which currently show nothing--they're all empty.

 On the left side there's a compass, which has not just eight but
 sixteen directions, currently flipping wildly around, and a small line
 of text below says PLEASE INSERT NUMBER IN APPROPRIATE NOOK.

>commands

 This game doesn't recognize too many commands. You can EXAMINE stuff
 or PUSH buttons. Or you can see commands specific to the current
 PUZZLE. They should be abbreviated. You can also RESET a puzzle
 outside the origin. The standard directions also apply, and hey, maybe
 that ghost's worth talking to.

>examine ghost

 He's got the bedsheet and the inner peace thing going, just lying in
 wait for you to start a conversation.

>inventory

 You are carrying nothing.

>talk to ghost

 "I thought you'd never ask." You're not sure if he cared WHAT you
 asked about, or even if you were asking. "It wasn't all your fault I
 died, you know. But you contributed to it by BORING me with...well, I
 didn't have to bang my head until I...that's not important. Main
 thing, I've forgiven you, but I can't take the next step up--you
 know--until I help you understand. Understand why I wanted to read
 that logic book instead of talking to you. Oh, and they made me give
 you something. But it's nothing, really."

 And it is. It's a big fat zero. Or, rather, a wooden cube mostly plain
 except for a big fat zero on one face.

 "It'll help you get to some logic puzzles ahead. Don't worry--they're
 tricky, but not lethally boring. Ahem. Oh, apparently I also have to
 give you help if you get stuck too long...part of gaining my wings."

 He disappears through the chalkboard to the north.

>examine chalkboard

 The scrawlings on the blackboard are disturbingly incoherent, but
 what's behind it may be worse.

>examine me

 You're in your jogging outfit, a full grey sweatsuit.

>look behind chalkboard

 You can't see any such thing.

>put zero in nook a

 Weird. A magnetic field's repelling it. Try another nook?

>examine zero

 It's not so much a zero as a wooden cube with a zero on one face and a
 black metallic strip on the opposite.

>look in nook a

 This is a logic problem, not a treasure hunt. Examine what you need
 to, instead.

>examine nook a

 Nook a is empty.

>put zero in nook b

 The Big Fat Zero fits in with a magnetic snap.

>examine compass

 It is currently pointing east.

>again

 It is currently pointing east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Room 0</span>
 The room's disappointingly bare for your average New Location. You can
 only go back west here.

 That magic square hanging in the air must be your first puzzle. It's
 probably worth having a look.

>examine square

 "Maybe you've seen this before, maybe you haven't," says the ghost's
 voice. "Put the numbers one through nine so that all diagonals, rows
 and columns add up to the same number. If you're nice, I'll even tell
 you that nu...well, okay, it's gotta be one third of the sum of 'em
 all. Just say UL 3 or CR 6 or whichever to place a number. Or set it
 to zero to clear it. Or RESET for the whole board."

 "Not bad. This one's a bit trickier, but it isn't. Only so many
 possibilities, but it's easy to "eliminate" the right one. You know
 how pawns in chess move? Forward, but capture diagonally? You'll need
 to make a queen here. Have a look at the board. Fail all you want.
 I've got time. Oh, just use algebraic notation--you know? a6 for a
 pawn to move ahead, a5-b6 to capture? Can't do anything snazzy like bc
 yet. Sorry."

 "Don't worry. This isn't a puzzle. It's a bit of showing off, really.
 In fact, all of the rooms to the south that'll open up? They're
 showing off, too. Hope you don't mind. I...uh...well, they'd be
 trickier if I'd gotten around to learning assembly language. No, no,
 that's not your fault--I put it off for years!"

 A pair of 5x5 squares is here.

 Someone's drawn up a bunch of numbers:

   A     B

 12340 30241

 Hm. Another checkerboard. But it's a bit smaller. You hear your friend
 again. "Well...that 8x8 board was kind of tricky. So I gave you a
 6x6-er instead. It's sort of more complex and less complex at the same
 time."

 You can see a 6x6 board here.

>examine board

 "Here's one that shouldn't be too hard. I think. Six queens, six by
 six square. It's impossible for four-by-four and a bit too easy for
 five-by-five. Above that, you need a computer. Just say the square you
 want to remove a piece from or place it on. Remember, queens move
 vertically, horizontally and diagonally."

 You hear a "poof" from back at the origin. You see smoke coming from
 the boggle-box. It's probably for effect, but who knows...

>sse

 You run to check the boggle box, but it looks unharmed. The foldout
 appears to be slightly off-key, though. It wobbles into the shape of a
 spiffy, perpendicular X before tumbling out of the boggle-box.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
>examine +

 Wait--it's a plus, because when it fell, it landed on one of the legs.
 You pick it up gingerly, half worried it might combust or gain a few
 thousand degrees Fahrenheit. You fiddle with it to make sure you can
 switch it back to a minus sign if you need to.

 You walk into what appears to be a city block. It has a limousine by a
 nightclub, with a hotel a bit away. Six women are here--they're
 yacking about you're not sure what. You find them less attractive, and
 their babble less interesting, than you would have an hour ago.

 "Ohmigod!" yells one. "You must be the limo driver! You totally have
 to take us back to the hotel! But you like can't schlep us all in at
 once. We like have standards though. Are you like listening?"
>no
 once. We like have standards though. Are you like listening?"


 She babbles on. "We can't let you in the limo with just one of us
 because we've had a driver put the moves on us and we can't let you
 just drive it around empty because that would like be wasting money
 and I like almost forgot something really important. We're like BFFs
 but some of us are really upset with each other right now so we like
 need to cool down until we're all like safe."

 After some interrogation, you determine their names, and also that
 Danni hates Cindy hates Buffy hates Abbie hates Fanny hates Ellie, and
 vice versa.

 "Well there you have it," whispers the ghost. "A bunch of ladies you
 might have tried to put the moves on, or been jealous if a friend
 did..."

 You blink, then double check--yup, everyone's back at the hotel!

 They actually give you a decent tip, but as you leave, you hear them
 saying "Oh my god. Who did he think he was? Referring to us by name? I
 mean, we told him our names to introduce ourselves but he totally
 abused it." As they walk away you hear them discuss whether being
 brainy enough to solve a puzzle like this made you that dorky looking,
 or whether being dorky looking forced you to be brainy. You almost get
 interested, yourself.

 You hear a click-foom from the southsouthwest, with trailing
 falling-firework sounds. You suspect your handy foldout has changed

 Well, it's not really behind you, but more like behind where you were.

 You have solved 6 of 6 quirky puzzles. Congratulations! You made it!
 The weirdness fades and you step out into an alley to continue your
 jog. The usual pseudo-Narnian time constraints and all mean you
 weren't really gone, even if some of the puzzles took a while.

 You're out of the whole mess, and you find yourself thinking of the
 problems and variations on them. At first you didn't want to think
 THAT guy--dumb enough to bash his head theatrically--could know
 something you'd have fun learning. Maybe if you could it, you could
 get a little further ahead in the world...or (and you don't know WHERE
 this thought came from) maybe it might be fun to learn on its own.
