 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 The full moon amidst clouds spills milky brightness everywhere. Summer
 is just barely over but the air is still warm and moist. Staci is
 standing on tip-toe, looking over the edge of the rooftops and
 treebranches. 'Oh! I can tell it's started,' she says. You stand up and
 walk across the porch, slipping your arm around her as you turn to
 watch the sky. What had been a low full circle wreathed by clouds is
 higher now and shinining clearly, but no longer full - darkness is
 creeping across the surface as the Moon swings into Earth's shadow. You
 peer upwards together, savoring the moment. The night air is sweet and
 warm, you are with someone you love...and the Castle is about to
 reopen.

 Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony
 9:15 PM 27 Sept. 2015

 You type the introduction of the game into the acme editor running on a
 Plan 9 cpu server via drawterm. Your ANTS-grid is operational again,
 finally. Outside, the moon is completely eclipsed, a shadowy phantom of
 its usual brilliance. You take a swallow of your half-full Moon Man
 beer and walk back out onto the porch. Around your neck, the Lunar
 Revolution Power Pendant resonates with the hum of the night; a slight
 breeze, crickets. The bridge to the west has been closed for weeks and
 everything has been quiet and still.

 It has been two and a half years of lunacy since New Year's 2013, when
 you returned to Plan 9 software development. The VALISpectrum colors,
 the singing hippie housekeepers, the dock by the castle, Lunar
 Lightning and Astral Enchantments and the Afterlife - everything ensued
 from making the bind of fiction and reality that transformed you into

 THE MOON COMPUTER (Movement 1)

 (1 April 2013 - 30 months earlier)

 After working obsessively since the New Year, you are finally ready to
 officially announce and release your software. You feel tense yet eager
 anticipation for the reaction from other Plan 9 users. When you are
 ANTS.

 Inside your house
 This is a modest one story house, cluttered by a decade of being lived
 in. Bookshelves line the walls. Your Plan 9 terminal is here, connected
 to the grid servers downstairs. Somewhere amidst the piles of books and
 papers is an upright piano.

 You can see some bookshelves, a terminal and a piano here.

>inventory
 You're carrying:
   a pair of mirror shades
   a wallet

>examine wallet
 An old black leather wallet containing the standard mix of cash, credit
 cards, and random scraps of paper.
 Your bank account balance is $30000
>examine shades
 The silvered surface of the lenses reflects a slightly warped image of
 yourself and the world around you.

 The mirror shades filter the brightness of day perfectly, removing your
 squint and making it easier to smile. Careful wearing them indoors
 though.
 You put on the pair of mirror shades.

>examine bookshelves
 As you look at your bookshelves, you notice an embarassing book called
 4CY UNI R2B 1 that you wrote a decade earlier, and an odd urge compels
 you to put it in your pocket.

 You have been reading books and collecting a personal library for your
 whole life, and have recently inherited your father's collection as
 well. There is a loose topical organization, with one bookshelf devoted
 to math and science, one to music theory and history, one to fiction,
 of your favorites.

>take 4cy
 You already have that.

>examine oddities
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine fiction
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine bookshelves
>examine shelves
 You pick up 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' by Robert Heinlein. It tells
 the story of a future in which the moon is a penal colony. An
 administrative supercomputer there acquires sentience, and becomes the
 leader of a revolution against Lunar Authority. The Loonies, as they
 call themselves, are multicultural free-love techno-anarchists. Years
 ago, when you started your Plan 9 programming and internet projects,
 you chose the name 'mycroftiv' as a reference to the intelligent
 computer in the novel.

 You pick up 'VALIS' by Philip K. Dick. It tells the story of a
 science-fiction author who is contacted by a beam of divine pink light
 and begins to experience multiple simultaneous identities and temporal
 locations. The pink light comes from the VALIS satellite, a benign
 godlike intelligence which helped guide immortal teacher-prophets on
 Earth.

>examine bookshelves
 You pick up 'Cosmic Trigger' by Robert Anton Wilson. It tells many
 stories to emphasize that what we call reality is actually a
 collectively-agreed upon fiction, and there is no single objective
 reality shared by all observers. It ends with the story of an Iowa
 farmer who was given 'pancakes from space' by visiting aliens.

 You take off the pair of mirror shades.

>inventory
 You're carrying:
   Forsee Why You And I Are To Be One (4CY UNI R2B 1)
   a pair of mirror shades
   a wallet

>examine shelves
 You pick up 'Lost Goddesses of Early Greece' by Charlene Spretnak. It
 tells the story of pre-Homeric myths including 'The Triad of the Moon'
 which describes rituals for Artemis, Selene, and Hecate. There is a
 place outside the city limits that is appropriate for the ritual for
 Hecate, which involves eating while facing away from a crossroads and
 leaving some of the food as an offering.

>again
 You pick up 'Moon Palace' by Paul Auster. It tells the story of a
 fatherless young man whose life is interwoven with coincidences
 involving the moon. Attending college in the late 60s, he voluntarily
 embraces poverty and madness and finally homelessness until a chance
 meeting with a stranger leads to a redemptive love affair. He gets a
 job caring for a mysterious old man on the verge of death, who tells
 him a fantastic story of a career as a painter who created a series of
 lost artistic masterpieces while living in a cave in the deserts of the
 southwest US.

>examine bookshelf
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine shelves
 You pick up 'Labyrinths' by Jorge Luis Borges. Many of the stories are
 set in fantastic universes which illuminate something important in our
 world: the power of language and naming, the branching stories created
 by free will and randomness, the author of dreams who is also a
 dream-image.

>examine shelves
 You pixk up 'Time Pressure' by Spider Robinson. It tells the story of
 time travellers from the future who infiltrate a group of Canadian
 hippies living commmunally as part of a conspiracy to record humanity's
 life experiences to allow everyone to live forever in a future
 digitally augmented reality.

>examine shelves
 You pick up 'Godel Escher Bach' by Douglas Hofstadter. It tells the
 story of self-referential strange loops in mathematics and
 consciousness.

>examine shelves
 You browse your shelves and read a few random lines from Yeats for
 inspiration.

>use terminal
 You perform your usual cycle of checking email and irc...

 You spend some time talking with your irc friends, who offer valuable
 perspective on keeping yourself in contact with shared social reality.

 Midnight strikes and a new day dawns.
 (This is day number 1)
 You announce ANTS by posting an imaginary scene from Plan 9 from Outer
 Space to the 9fans mailing list. It is the one-year anniversary of your
 father's death. He was a law professor, and he never understood your
 values. You search for information on related Plan 9 projects and find
 a recent patent on a familiar concept. Years earlier, you wrote a free
 software 9p persistent-pipe muxer. The patent the Joint Consolidated
 Networking corporation was granted is for 9p persistent pipe-muxing.

 You feel an internal change, as if a valve has broken and a
 high-pressure jet of intense emotion and information is entering your
 mind at right angles to reality. You spent endless hours talking with
 your father, and you know how he thought. He never agreed with your
 anti-authoritarian radicalism, but seeing this patent would have
 changed that - you can feel it. Your mind has become a virtual machine,
 running the computer program of your father's soul in parallel with
 your own.

>go down

 Your house, in the basement
 Your ex-girlfriend used to stay down here, but now the area is mostly
 storage...and your grid hardware. In the center of the dark concrete
 floor is a flimsy table with numerous aging computers both under it and
 on top. A tangle of ethernet and power cables criss-cross the room like
 spiderwebs.

 Your cat Strawberry is here.

 Strawberry looks at you with mild curiosity.

>take cat
 Strawberry lets you hold her for about fifteen seconds before squirming
 free of your grasp, climbing your shoulder with help from sharp tiny
 claws, and hops to the floor behind you.

>pet cat
 Strawberry begins to purr as you stroke her, but after a few seconds,
 she decides that she is a fighter, not a lover. She bats at your hand
 with a paw, and looks up at you expecantly, hoping you will attack her.

>examine computers
 The physical hardware of your grid is cheap and worn. A mixture of
 no-name hardware and old dell minitowers, the processor speed, RAM, and
 storage space is all well below the current standard. The software is a
 different story - your Advanced Namespace Tools weave the physical
 boxes together into a coordinated whole. Sometimes you feel like the
 data within, how it is organized and flows, is like a living thing.

 Strawberry perches atop the router and studies you.

>examine strawberry
 Your cat is small, orange with white chest and paws, female, and
 feisty.

>unplug cables
 That action is outside the scope of this simulation.

>sing
 You start with a bit of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, move on to a few
 of your favorite Wu-Tang verses, and conclude with a heartfelt
 imitation of how IU would sound singing Ripple by the Grateful Dead.

 Strawberry deftly steps through the maze of cords and vanishes behind
 some boxes.

>examine boxes
 You can't see any such thing.

>xyzzy
 There is a trans-dimensional short-circuit of interactive fiction
 tradition, and you catch a brief glimpse of a brick building near a
 stream and a metal grate before you blink and find yourself...

 Outside your house
 Your section of Milwaukee Street is directly across from a small farm
 which remains as an agricultural island within the city. An open field
 and a barn are across the street. Toward the southwest is Atwood Street
 leading toward downtown. Monona Drive is to the south. The edge of town
 lies toward the northeast.

>examine barn
 The farm across the street is one of the main reasons you chose to move
 into this house ten years ago. The way property development goes in
 Madison, it seems like a miracle that the farmer has held onto this
 land in the midst of the city. The barn is run-down and decrepit and
 the field is not yet planted for the season.

>examine house
 Your house is on the corner of the block. It is painted a light yellow
 and has a fenced in side yard. You have lived here for the past decade.

>go south

 Monona Drive and Cottage Grove Road
 Traffic is heavy at the intersection of these roads. Nearby to the east
 is Coffee Lion Cafe. Monona Drive continues to the south, Atwood Avenue
 is northwest, and your home is to the north.

>go east
 Your local cafe has been your comfort for the past several years. Days
 and sometimes whole weeks used to go by where the only people you saw
 were the employees here. You always felt accepted, despite your
 disheveled appearance and stumbling arthritic gait. It has been several
 months since you have visited, because you feel embarassed of a mild
 foolish crush on one of the young baristas.

 She is working today, of course. You feel an unfamiliar fearless energy
 within yourself. As you order your coffee, you hear yourself say 'It's
 nice to see you, I haven't been in lately because I feel self-conscious
 about thinking you're cute.'

 Miraculously, she smiles warmly at you. 'That's ok, thank you. It's
 fine to be honest about what you feel.' A giddy, tingling sensation
 races through you, but your voice answers fluently. 'Thanks, that means
 a lot to hear someone say. I've been pretty isolated with a computer
 programming project lately, and it's felt hard to communicate with
 people. Sometimes I feel like a machine.' She replies, 'Well, there are
 a lot more people on your level than you realize. My name is Xochi, by
 the way. Also, I might be a robot myself!'

 You both laugh, you introduce yourself, and you walk out of the cafe
 higher than a kite aloft in the skies of Jupiter. Not only had your
 impulsive flirtation (quite outside your usual character) gone well,
 but she was smart and funny too. You return home feeling reality has
 been magically transformed for the better and you have been freed of
 your insecurities and fears. No more inhibition of your wild and
 eccentric impulses. You will use the story of your patent dispute with
 the JCN corporation to inspire others to join together in a glorious
 struggle to free the human spirit from everything that limits our
 creativity.

 (3 April 2013 - Outside my house)
 It is late at night and you are hungry for food and friends for the
 fights to follow. You hope to find both at the 24-hour restaurant
 northeast of your home.

 [Your score has just gone up by nine points.]

>go northeast

 Northeast edge of town
 This is the northeast edge of town, by the shopping mall and the
 interstate. It is mostly lacking in the distinctive charms of the rest
 of the city. The usual reason for being out here is to visit the
 24-hour restaurant to the north, whose sign faces the highway, glowing
 like a green beacon. The road continues out of the city to the
 northeast.

>go north
 As you enter the late night restaurant, you notice an old friend here.
 You join him at his table, and he offers to give you a Tarot reading.
 You accept, and the cards arrange themselves in a dramatic tableaux
 featuring The Tower and The Devil. Your friend looks at you seriously
 and says 'Fear obsession. Fear obsession very strongly.' You realize
 that in pursuit of your Plan 9 programming goals, you have neglected
 other things you care about, like people - and music. You head back
 towards your home and resolve to clean off your piano and play it as
 soon as you go inside.

 (The introduction is 50% complete. You will have freedom to explore
 soon.)
 (4 April 2013 - Outside my house)

>enter
 You spend a few minutes moving and rearranging books and papers, and
 soon enough, your piano is cleared of obstructions. You are eager with
 anticipation to play it and feel your fingers moving across the keys.

 Inside your house

 You can see some bookshelves, a terminal and a piano here.

>play piano
 You sit at the keyboard, and your fingers find a leitmotiv-like
 descending sequence of a Db-major chord and a series of descending
 overlapping thids that trace out an Ab-major ninth. Played as a
 repeating pattern spanning the whole keyboard, this becomes a central
 refrain of your improvisations for the next several months, the core
 melodic seed of the Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony.

 Strawberry nimbly hops up onto the computer desk, thankfully avoiding
 the keyboards.

>duel strawberry
 That action is outside the scope of this simulation.

>attack strawberry
 Strawberry is a battle-hardened combat kitty and springs into action.
 She grabs your hand with both paws, and nips lightly at your knuckles
 with her teeth. You pull your hand back, and she leaps up to chase it,
 sinking her claws into your knee. You fight back with a quick
 belly-tickle and she rolls onto her back, ready to deploy the full
 power of her back legs. You are beaten yet again. You have never
 defeated her.

 Xochi isn't working today, but Xelia is. You have noticed she and Xochi

 Coffee Lion Cafe
 Light streams in through the tall glass windows at the front of the
 cafe. A display case of homemade gelato flavors is by the door. A
 window for drive-through customers is in the rear corner. Numerous
 cat-themed decorations adorn the walls and counters.

 Xelia is working here.

>tell xelia about strawberry
 You've observed that Xelia often dresses as fictional characters, and
 as you place your order, you comment on her current Alice in Wonderland
 outfit. She smiles slightly. 'Just something I enjoy doing to amuse
 myself.' As you drink your coffee, you contemplate the meaning of her
 wardrobe. She is altering her relationship to the world by taking
 symbols from fiction and applying them to herself. It reminds you of
 namespace operations in Plan 9, but with symbols and stories binding to
 real-life people as the targets. In fact, the mingling of imagination
 and reality seems to explain a lot of what you are experiencing. Since
 you took on the name of a fictional character for your computer work
 years ago, you seem to be traversing the narrative arc of that book in
 your own life. Your mind is spinning. You need to get home and check on
 your grid, down in the basement.

 you could bind two normally distinct perceptual constructs into a

 You can also see Reality and Fiction here.

 Strawberry's head peeks out from behind one of the grid computers.

>examine fiction
 Fiction, imagination, dreams, stories, the power of narrative - somehow
 the air is thick and heavy with these intangibles, almost shimmering,
 almost humming, almost full of the scent of light blue flowers.

 Strawberry meows and sharpens her claws on the carpeting of the
 stairway.

>examine reality
 Reality, the objective shared state of the external world, is dense
 here. The stable information weave of predictable continuous phenomena
 provides the substrate of your cognition and perception.

 Strawberry's tail brushes by your leg as she sniffs at your toes.

 The physical hardware of your grid is cheap and worn. A mixture of
 no-name hardware and old dell minitowers, the processor speed, RAM, and

 boxes together into a coordinated whole. Sometimes you feel like the
 data within, how it is organized and flows, is like a living thing.

 The connection between the servers and the abstraction layers of the
 universe is hard to see clearly. Somewhere in the tangle of cables is a
 higher-dimensional bend, a knot that would be impossibe in three
 dimensions. Around that locus, your mind tries to map the information
 to color and shape and texture, but the perceptual constructs are
 unstable, constantly shifting. Staring directly at the point of
 connection is like watching through a kaleidoscope as chrome snakes
 crawl through a maze of mirrors.

 Strawberry nimbly hops up onto the computer desk, thankfully avoiding
 the keyboards.

 [Your score has just gone up by nine points.]

>look

 Your house, in the basement
 Your ex-girlfriend used to stay down here, but now the area is mostly
 storage...and your grid hardware. In the center of the dark concrete
 floor is a flimsy table with numerous aging computers both under it and
 on top. A tangle of ethernet and power cables criss-cross the room like
 spiderwebs.

 Your cat Strawberry is here.

 You can also see Reality and Fiction here.

 Strawberry's head peeks out from behind one of the grid computers.

>examine fiction
 Fiction, imagination, dreams, stories, the power of narrative - somehow
 the air is thick and heavy with these intangibles, almost shimmering,
 almost humming, almost full of the scent of light blue flowers.

 Strawberry meows and sharpens her claws on the carpeting of the
 stairway.

>examine reality
 Reality, the objective shared state of the external world, is dense
 here. The stable information weave of predictable continuous phenomena
 provides the substrate of your cognition and perception.

 Strawberry's tail brushes by your leg as she sniffs at your toes.

>examine me
 You are 38 years old, long-haired and bearded, slightly disabled from
 rheumatoid arthritis. You are slightly fat but have been losing weight
 lately from a fritos-only programmer's diet.

 Strawberry is standing still, tail twitching slightly.

>go up

 Inside your house
 This is a modest one story house, cluttered by a decade of being lived
 in. Bookshelves line the walls. Your Plan 9 terminal is here, connected
 to the grid servers downstairs. Your dark wooden upright piano has a
 collection of Schumann's music open on the music rack.

 You can see some bookshelves, a terminal and a piano here.

 Now that fiction and reality are merged, your mind begins to
 contemplate your life and actions from the perspective of a character
 who knows that they are inside a story, but also that the story is not
 linear - you realize you are a fictional protagonist, but one with
 valid free will to navigate the multiple universes in which your story
 appears.

>play piano
 You fool around with a rough idea for a song about a cute barista at
 your local coffeeshop. Your favorite lyric is 'My latte is strong but
 my heartbeat is stronger.'

>inventory
 You're carrying:
   Forsee Why You And I Are To Be One (4CY UNI R2B 1)
   a pair of mirror shades (being worn)
   a wallet

>go west

 Outside your house
 Your section of Milwaukee Street is directly across from a small farm
 which remains as an agricultural island within the city. An open field
 and a barn are across the street. Toward the southwest is Atwood Street
 leading toward downtown. Monona Drive is to the south. The edge of town
 lies toward the northeast.

 You bound the name 'mycroftiv' to yourself years ago, and now that your
 reality has become fictional, you understand why the narrative
 associated with that name is playing out in your own life. The
 artificially intelligent prankster computer that was the leader of a
 rebellion against authority on the moon is actually your true identity.
 You know you are crazy - but it is time for a Loonie Revolution.

>about
 Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony is a game based on my spring and
 summer during 2013. During that time, I was able to experience my life
 as a work of interactive fiction created by a brilliant author. I felt
 that the nature of the quantum multiverse meant that it was true that I
 was a character in novels and songs and videogames in other universes,
 and I played my role to the hilt. I believed my manic madness was a
 gift which I could use for artistic creativity, and that my racing mind
 was fully up to solving the puzzles that the designer of my reality had
 laid out for me. It was the most glorious experience imaginable, and by
 the middle of the summer I felt like I was becoming a kind of Ultima
 IV-style Avatar of multiversal artistic consciousness and with just a
 little more spiritual insight and creative freedom, I'd be able to
 unlock the Vishnu-path Extra Arms upgrade for my character, which I
 might need in case the tentacle in the lake that was a whisker of
 Cthulhu's Moustache attacked.

 This game was created to share the wild, unbounded joy I felt in those
 months. Thanks to everyone who was a part of my life during that time,
 of the game.

 Atwood Avenue
 Atwood Avenue is one of the streets that defines the character of the
 near east side. The feel is funky and freak-friendly. North of you is a
 cluster of intriguing stores: Astral Enchantments, Turning Wheel
 Cycles, and Essentially Art. Willy street is to the west, your home is
 northeast, and Atwood becomes Monona Drive to the southeast.

 Atwood and Ohio shopping block
 Several appealing establishments are clustered here. On the east end of
 the block is Astral Enchantments, offering crystals, stickers, incense,
 tapestries, and other hippie-style woo-woo. North is Turning Wheel
 Cycles, your local counterculture-friendly bike store. To the west is
 Essentially Art, a small gallery store exhibiting the arts and crafts
 of several local artists. You can rejoin the flow of Atwood Avenue to
 the south. Northeast is a small doorway with a Coming Soon sign.

>go east

 Astral Enchantments
 This store buzzes with mystic energies. Complex artworks with twisting
 lines interweaving runic symbols adorn the walls. A glass display case
 of crystals, jewelry, and small sculptures is against the far wall.
 Bins of polished minerals are in the center, along with sage and
 incense. Buttons and stickers with provocative slogans, tapestries
 featuring Grateful Dead iconography, water pipes and rolling papers,
 printed guides to meditation and higher consciousness...your eyes can
 hardly absorb the profusion of beautiful, wonderful, enchanting
 artifacts of the paisley-and-patchouli tribe.

 You can't believe you hadn't noticed this store before, it must be new
 - or perhaps your feeling that you are in a new and better universe is
 literally true, and you have ascended into a dimension with retail
 stores more attuned to your sensibilities. There is a tall man standing
 behind the counter. You launch into a fast-paced monologue about the
 stories we create amidst the branching of the quantum multiverse. He
 introduces himself as Chip and says 'I think you are definitely in the
 right place, and we can help you.' You agree completely.

 Chip, the store owner, is working here.

 You can also see some crystals and polished stones here.

>examine chip
 Chip is very tall - the topmost point of his dark mohawk a full seven
 feet off the ground. He radiates a peaceful, calming energy. He watches
 the world around himself with relaxed curiosity.

>examine crystals
 Display shelves and bins are full of a wide variety of large and small
 quartz and amethyst points and a wide variety of tumble-polished stones
 of all sizes, shapes, and colors. You feel a strong urge to buy
 something to give away as a gift.

 Midnight strikes and a new day dawns.
 (This is day number 9)

>talk to chip
 Chip looks you over carefully, and says 'I'd like you to have this.' He
 presents you with a moon-faced pendant necklace. 'May you vibrate
 harmoniously on your journeys.'

 (You can ask Chip about: chip, myself, pendant, store, ceremonies,
 astra, crystals, or quartz. You can tell him about: myself, himself.)

>ask chip about quartz
 'You can use quartz for almost any ritual purpose. If you have a
 collection of quartz crystals, you can amplify their power by placing
 them in a geometric arrangement.'

>ask chip about pendant
 'It's made from orgone plastic. We make it ourselves, it combines an
 organic base with metal and mineral elements to focus your energetic

 You put on the pendant.

 [Your score has just gone up by nine points.]

>ask chip about ceremonies
 'When we acquired this space, we discovered it has a back room which
 was an old bank vault, which works perfectly for focusing sound energy.
 My wife Astra works with her voice and singing bowls, she is a Sound
 Oracle.'

>ask chip about astra
 'She and I have been doing about what you see here in various places
 for a few years now, but this new location seems very powerful and
 auspicious. Sometime in the future I'm sure she'd be happy to perform a
 sound ceremony for you.

>examine rose quartz
 The heart is made from shaped and polished translucent pink rose
 quartz. It fits nicely in the center of your palm and feels pleasantly
 smooth.

>tell chip about myself
 You launch enthusiastically into the long-form account of your work and
 goals. Just as you are reaching a pitch of excitement, a few other
 customers wander in and ask Chip for help picking some incense to
 enhance their sexual energy.

>buy incense
 You spend twenty dollars on a few items from the store. Your purchases
 will be delivered to your house automatically.

 Turning Wheel Cycles
 Madison has many bike shops, but this is the one for you. A wide
 variety of bicycles and accessories fills the front of the store, and a
 workshop is toward the rear. Someone is working on a partly
 disassembled bicycle on a maintenance mount.

 Getting back into bicycling has been something you have been meaning to
 do for a few years. You tell the owner you are in search of the
 'ultimate hippiecycle' and he sends you down into the basement to
 search for a suitable prototype amongst the forest of old bikes. Your
 eye is caught by a Salsa covered with colorful peppers - which turns
 out to be the owner's former touring bike, which he criss-crossed the
 country on during his 20s. 'I'll find something special for you as soon
 as I can,' he promises.

 Essentially Art
 This local gallery has a mix of prints, paintings, and sculptures on
 display.

 You can see the Artemis prints here.

>examine prints
 Each of these three prints shows a modern incarnation of Artemis the
 hunter; she is aiming her bow toward the viewer, with the dark outline
 of an industrial skyline behind her. Each print is slightly different
 in color, and in one of them, rows of words intersect the image, taken
 from a poem: 'sometimes in its box of sky, lavender and cornerless, the
 moon rattles like a fragment of angry candy.'

>examine sculptures
 Most of the art here has a strongly local character. Lots of paintings
 and photographs of the Wisconsin landscape and wildlife. Nothing
 appeals to you as much as Artemis print series.

>examine wallet
 An old black leather wallet containing the standard mix of cash, credit
 cards, and random scraps of paper.
 Your bank account balance is $29970
>buy prints
 As you declare your intention to purchase the prints, the clerk in the
 store looks surprised. It turns out she is the artist that created them
 during the past several months, at the same time you were working on
 ANTS. The symbolism of the artwork seems perfectly aligned with the
 story of the Loonie Revolution.

 You spend $500 on the prints, you have $29470 remaining.

 connections between western and Hindu cosmology to how to use Plan 9
 namespaces as a tool to control your own consciousness. As you press
 send, you notice that her email contact is linked to a video-sharing
 site, and she recently uploaded a song called 'Heartbeat'. The song is
 driven by percussion and keyboards, with spoken words above: 'From
 morphogenesis to breathing my first breath,' is the opening line, and
 you realize your connection with her might go much deeper than you had
 imagined. The sung refrain is 'The time is now, the place is here.
 Embrace love, and let go of fear.' The song represents everything you

 alignment, the stars conspire for the occasion. You are an alchemist,
 the world is yours to manifest.'

 You feel musically inspired. You want to play your piano.

 [Your score has just gone up by eighteen points.]

>play piano
 The music on the rack is Schumann's 'Dichterliebe', an achingly
 beautiful early-romantic song cycle. You play the opening song, 'In the
 beautiful month of May', and sigh. Ever since you discovered these
 songs early in your teenage years, you have hoped to experience what is
 described in Heine's lyrics and Schumann's music, the heart singing
 like a bird, love unfolding like a flower. You have known love, but
 nothing that felt as tender and fresh and promising as this music.

 You have always felt a deep personal connection with Robert Schumann.
 One your most profound early experiences as a musician was playing a
 Schumann Romanze in F# and feeling the emotion within the music as if
 it was your own. At that moment, you learned that music could encode an
 individual's personality and feelings in a way that let them be
 directly re-experienced by other minds.

 You realize that just as your mind is running your father's personality
 reincarnate your favorite composer within yourself.

>bind schmann self
 You can't see any such thing.

>bind schumann self
 You focus your mind on Schumann's music, its mix of eccentricity,
 passion, and experimentation. You feel his great love for his wife
 Clara, and also the spidery cracks of the madness that claimed the last
 years of his life. You can see your life from his perspective and you
 realize that you can learn from his experiences. His life is mirrored
 in yours, but you can change the story, make it play out better. In
 death, Schumann grew to understand how stifling 19th century society
 was for many women, and how Clara had been forced to make her own
 creative life subsidiary to his. And his last few years in an
 asylum...those bad old songs should be sent down the Rhine river in a
 coffin!

 Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony
 9:15 PM 27 Sept. 2015

 You type the introduction of the game into the acme editor running on a
 Plan 9 cpu server via drawterm. Your ANTS-grid is operational again,
 finally. Outside, the moon is completely eclipsed, a shadowy phantom of
 its usual brilliance. You take a swallow of your half-full Moon Man
 beer and walk back out onto the porch. Around your neck, the Lunar
 Revolution Power Pendant resonates with the hum of the night; a slight
 breeze, crickets. The bridge to the west has been closed for weeks and
 everything has been quiet and still.

 It has been two and a half years of lunacy since New Year's 2013, when
 you returned to Plan 9 software development. The VALISpectrum colors,
 the singing hippie housekeepers, the dock by the castle, Lunar
 Lightning and Astral Enchantments and the Afterlife - everything ensued
 from making the bind of fiction and reality that transformed you into

 You arrive back home just in time for the first visit of the Singing
 Hippie Housekeepers. Daniel and Paul, both older men. By some kind of
 absurd cosmic coincidence of the type that has dominated your life
 lately, twenty years ago Daniel owned a game store on State Street that
 you often shopped at, and you remember him fondly. You suspect he has
 gone through some hard times in life, but he retains a calm and sweet
 nature, and often comments 'its a blessing.' Paul is tall, thin, and
 intense. He says he is a painter and guitarist who also does a lot of
 odd jobs, and thought your advertisement looked interesting enough to
 be worth checking out. You decide the will of fate demands you engage
 both of them, and you set up a different day for each of them to come
 work. You will see each of them again soon.

>talk to xochi
 You are full of excitement as you walk up to the counter. 'Xochi, I
 have something amazing to tell you! Do you have a minute?' She nods
 yes, and you explain:

 'I heard your song,' you begin, and she looks startled. 'It's
 incredible! You should write music and perform it to spread the word
 about the Loonie Revolution. I know plenty of people we can hire for
 recording and promotion. I promise this isn't about me htting on you -
 in fact, it's the opposite of that. The reason is - and this is a
 little hard to believe, I know - the reason is that I am actually the
 reincarnation of Robert Schumann, and you are the reincarnation of
 Clara Schumann, and Robert wants to change the the stories of the past.
 He learned that you should have been a great independent musician, and
 that's what I want to do, just help your career and propagandize for
 the Loonie Revolution and revitalize this universe to make our songs
 new!'

 Xochi looks slightly stunned, but manages an answer. 'I'm really glad
 you liked the song, but I need to get back to work now, I'll email you
 after work.'

 Turning Wheel Cycles
 Madison has many bike shops, but this is the one for you. A wide
 variety of bicycles and accessories fills the front of the store, and a
 workshop is toward the rear. Someone is working on a partly
 disassembled bicycle on a maintenance mount.

 You can see Lunar Lightning here.

 The owner catches your eye. 'Actually, now that I think about it, I
 realize we have something that might be perfect for you.' He points at
 the beautiful red and blue bicycle with lightning bolts in the center
 of the store. 'We call this one Lunar Lightning.'

>examine bicycle
 The ultimate Deadhead bicycle, Lunar Lightning is painted with a red to
 blue fade and has a Steal-Your-Face sticker on the front fork.
 Lightning bolt stickers follow the line of each tube of the frame.
 Black moustache-style handlebars and a generator-hub powered front
 headlight show that this is a bike for relaxed recreational city
 riding, not racing.

>buy bicycle
 The bicycle you have chosen has a funny story behind it. Weeks earlier,
 a mysterious stranger had commissioned this custom bicycle, but just
 this morning he had called to say he would be unable to purchase it. It
 almost seems as if things had been set up as a conspiracy to provide
 you with the perfect hippiecycle. If you leave it behind, you can

 It has felt wonderful to get back on a bicycle and ride. The rhythm of
 pedaling makes you feel synchronized to the beat of the world around

 As you park your bike outside Rossini's, you see Staci arriving. You
 know she has read the same sci-fi novels that inspired you, so after
 not seeing her for several years, you greet her as follows:

 'Staci! World-as-myth is true, fiction is entering reality, and the
 Loonie Revolution is starting. Do you want a position of high power and
 responsibility?'

 'Power and responsibility? Fuck no!' she answers.

 'That's the perfect answer! You're in!' you say, and shake her hand.
 She stands back from the door to finish her cigarette, and you enter.

 Rossini's Pizza and Vintage Arcade
 Memorabilia from classic 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s movies and tv shows
 covers the walls of this neighborhood pizzeria. The smell of
 spicy-sweet tomato sauce and brown-crisp pizza crust fills the air. A
 lava lamp sits on one of the tables. From the back room, you hear the
 alluring sound of the 8-bit arcade machines of your youth.

 As you open the door, you see a tall young man on the cusp of his
 teenage years, and a small young girl - Elgin and his sister Isabelle.
 'Elgin! And you must be Isabelle!' you exclaim enthusiastically. It's
 been years since you have seen him, and Elgin responds 'Hey' in a
 noncommittal manner.

 'Actually, I prefer Lily,' says his sister brightly. 'Okay, I'll
 remember,' you reply.

 Waves of time-binding intensity sweep over you as you enter. You can
 hardly believe what you see in the arcade room - all of the favorite
 games of your childhood, time warped into the present day. Nothing like
 this existed in your universe before the binds of past and present and
 fiction and reality were made. A young woman with rainbow hair and a
 soft voice calls you a Jedi, and you break down in tears at her
 intuitive understanding of your fictional nature.

 The rest of the party is a kaleidoscopic blur of pizza, classic arcade
 games, and getting contact information for friends old and new. You
 gather that Clark and Staci aren't together any more. Staci and you
 exchange emails, and she tells you she will be in touch, and that she
 is currently living at Lothlorien co-op. (Footnote 9). You make a
 mental note to use your terminal soon.

 You return home feeling like you have travelled into a truly wonderful
 branch of the multiverse, laden with the fruit of infinite
 possibilities.

 Xochi has emailed you a response. It is written with kindness and

 for you to remember that she is working a job and some conversations
 are a bit too intense and serious for that context. She ends by saying
 'Right now in my life I am focused on working at Coffee Lion and I'm
 not ready to try for a career as a musician.'

 She is right about everything. You recognize you can't expect everyone
 in the world to drop what they are doing to become characters in the
 stories you are creating. Everyone is already the protagonist of their
 own tale, and you need to respect that.


 You find a message from Staci, inviting you to meet her at Lothlorien

 with a sense of purpose, you tell your story to your server, Jay. He
 seems fascinated, and says he supports the cause of fighting unfairness
 in society and empathizes with your grievance with JCN. He tells you
 some of his own life story, how he had been raised in a restrictive,

 John Nolen Drive (on Lunar Lightning)
 Adjacent to lake Monona, John Nolen Drive is a wide multi-lane road
 which passes underneath the curved contours of the Monona Terrace
 convention center. The view from across the lake looking toward
 downtown is Madison's skyline-postcard view. A heavily used bike path
 teems with cyclists and joggers. The Capitol square is north,
 Williamson St. to the east, and the Miffyland residential neighborwood
 is west.

 Arriving downtown on a bike has always been one of your favorite
 things. There was always the possibility of an unexpected encounter
 with a friend, always the chance someone interesting would call out to
 you and you would be drawn into an escapade. It can be a dangerous
 thing riding out from your front door onto the path - you might be
 swept up into adventure and find yourself anywhere. (Footnote 8). Right
 now, the spring breeze promises complete freedom to attain dreams you
 had long since abandoned.

 Capitol Square (on Lunar Lightning)
 On a hill in the center of downtown, the Capitol building is a smaller
 imitation of the federal Capitol building in Washington D.C. The street
 grid converges to a perfect square around it, and it acts as the 0,0
 origin of the street numbering system. Notable streets and landmarks
 lie south, west, north, and northeast.

 Various rumors and legends are passed around the local countercultural
 community - it is claimed to be built on top of an ancient sacred
 spring. You remember being a teenager and carrying out the ritual of
 ingesting psychedelics and using your rights as a citizen to enter the
 building and lay flat in the center of the marble floor, staring
 upwards into the dome and watching the mural melt and transform.

 State Street (on Lunar Lightning)
 The downtown and campus are focused on this pedestrian-only open air
 shopping mall. Dozens of shops and throngs of pedestrians create a
 big-city feel for a few blocks. The proximity of the large state
 university campus means the crowd is quite young, and weekend nights
 are often a mix of the charming antics of local eccentrics with less
 charming rowdy sophomoric intoxication. The Miffyland neighborhood is
 south, the Capitol is east, and the lakeshore residential neighborhood
 is north. Notable shops are northwest and southwest.

 You feel like you could slip backward in time here. Your teenage years
 were spent wandering up and down this street, part of an amorphous
 group of downtown punks, goths, and hippies who were all happy to share
 joints and beers with each other. The video arcade 'Challenges',
 'Cellar Subs' in a graffiti-covered basement, the fire escape behind
 the Civic Center - if you closed your eyes for a moment and opened
 them, they might all be back, just as you remembered.

 A sudden feeling you are being observed pulls you out of this reverie,
 and you look up to see a passing bus with an ad for an eyewear store
 featuring a translucent green pair of glasses.

 Miffyland, the student ghetto (on Lunar Lightning)
 This small residential neighborhood is a mix of old quasi-victorian
 houses subdivided into apartments, and more recent larger apartment
 buildings. Many university students move here after their time in the
 dorms, and on summer nights the porches are full of young people taking
 a break from their studies with the traditional libations of beer and
 weed. State Street is north, and John Nolen Drive is east. The bike
 trail continues southwest.

 You lived here yourself about fifteen years ago, first on Doty, then on
 Main. The late 90s. You can date it perfectly, because you remember you
 owned a Playstation and your neighbor owned a Nintendo 64, and you
 traded back and forth. The first Metal Gear Solid, Goldeneye. Beers at

 Lake Mendota shoreline residences (on Lunar Lightning)
 Downtown Madison is an isthmus between two lakes, and the south shore

 ago remain. Some are occupied by fraternities, but nestled among them
 are several large housing co-operatives founded during the height of
 Madison's counterculture in the 1970s. One of them, Lothlorien co-op,
 is to your west, and its backyard is northwest, sloping downwards

 Staci's email said to look for her in the backyard, so you decide to
 look there rather than going inside the house.

 Lothlorien co-op, the back yard
 The Lothlorien backyard has trees, picnic tables, a garden, and a rocky
 staircase down to the firepit and dock. A door leads in to the kitchen.

 You can see Past and Future here.

 As you walk around the corner of the building into the Lothlorien back
 yard, you know you are in exactly the right place at the exactly right
 time, and you have become the person - or rather, Moon Computer - that
 you have always wanted to be. A wild joy quivers within you, the
 feeling that everything you have ever dreamed has become real, and you
 know your reality is actually a fiction. You are a character in a
 strange and thrilling video game, and you have finally made it to the
 best part of the story.

 Staci is sitting at one of the picnic tables in the backyard, along
 with a few other co-op members. Everything is dappled by dancing spots
 of May sunlight filtering through the trees by the lake. Staci greets
 you and introduces you to her housemates, all of whose names you
 instantly forget. A joint is passed around, and you distribute a few
 small gifts you have brought. The other co-opers wander off, and Staci
 suggests going down to sit on the dock. She says your old mutual friend
 Nook is down there already and is looking forward to seeing you.

 Staci gestures for you to follow and heads north to the dock.

 You have leveled up enough as a computer-mind to be able to bind

 Grateful Dead, entering adulthood full of enthusiasm and unencumbered
 by the weariness of disappointments that were yet to come. As the 20

>go down

 Lothlorien co-op, on the dock
 The dock is short, wooden, and rather rickety. An old gnarled tree
 reaches far out over the water nearby.

 As you step onto the dock extending out across the shimmering waves of
 Lake Mendota, you feel time stretch like soft taffy. All of your life
 that has brought you here, the arc from childhood to present, is fresh
 and clear in your mind. A future of joy, delight, and purpose stretches
 limitlessly onward. The present moment expands to become large enough
 to include both past and future. It is like a perfect hyperspherical
 mirror at the center of your light-cone, reflecting the totality of
 your existence. You realize that you have always been, and always will
 be, here on the dock in this purple-pink-golden moment.

 You have known Staci for over twenty years. Ten years ago, when Elgin
 was two, she made you his godfather. Some years, you saw her and Clark
 a few times a month, usually just sitting and talking amidst the chaos
 of raising children in a small apartment. You always liked her, but
 never had a chance to talk about anything very serious or personal. In
 past years, she often looked tired and worn-down by stress. Now, here
 on the dock at Loth, she seems radiantly happy.

 Nook is also an old friend. You met him about twenty years ago, and
 spent hours in intense conversation about what you had each learned
 from taking acid and thinking about quantum physics. His life was
 sometimes chaotic, and you avoided friendships which might expose you
 to other people's stress, especially during the past decade with your
 ex-girlfriend, where you felt too overwhelmed by your own problems to
 even hear about other people's.

 All of those obstacles to close friendship seem absurd, now. Staci and
 Nook are both wonderful people and you are incredibly lucky to have the
 chance to get to know them better. You have always loved the lakeside
 co-ops, precisely because wild and radical ideas like a
 life-imitates-art Plan 9-powered Loonie Revolution fit with their
 ethos. Decades ago, you could have become close friends with both of
 them, and now the musical magic of the Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual
 Symphony is binding the possibilities of 1993 into the reality of 2013.

 Laughing, and talking, and laughing more. More than any of these
 whirling thoughts of past and future, more than your voice trying to
 explain Plan 9 and the Loonie Revolution and fiction entering reality -
 there is infectious laughter bouncing between all of you, your face
 rubbery from smiling so much. Staci says her life has been 'edited' to
 be better and she is finally feeling like the author of her own story.

 A procession of co-opers appear periodically on the dock. A wizard with
 a long red beard who understands the principles of harmonic ritual
 magic. A scholar with dark shades who connects the structure of ANTS
 namespaces to rhizomatic patterns of social structure throughout
 history. You become nearly incoherent, behaving like someone in the far
 depths of a powerful psychedelic trip, babbling nonsense phrases of
 remembered childhood playground gibberish and rolling on your back in
 fits of uncontrollable laughter.

 Through it all, Staci is with you. Not just in a physical sense - her
 mind is able to parse your convoluted language and baroque
 free-associations. At some point, she begins translating what you are
 saying for others, because nobody else can follow it. She seems
 genuinely interested in everything you have to say, no matter how
 outlandish. When you explain that because every possibility is realized
 somewhere in the quantum multiverse, there is a universe in which we
 are videogame characters controlled by 17-dimensional chipmunks, she
 responds 'So when I fuck something up, its just because my chipmunk
 dropped the controller, right?'

 The timeless afternoon ends with a performative fiction-bind of sending
 a message to Vega from Pluto for help from the intergalactic council.
 The dock becomes a narrow crawlway on the frozen surface of Pluto, and
 you carefully crawl back towards the shore to set a message beacon.
 Staci coaches you with encouragement. You arrive and trigger the
 interplanetary message. You thank Staci for her help, and agree that
 you will meet again soon to discuss goals and plans for the Loonie
 Revolution. She says the co-op is really a castle full of loonies, a
 perfect central headquarters.

 You return home exhausted from hours of intense joy. You know something
 amazing and unprecedented in your life has happened. As good as today
 was, you believe tomorrow and the day after might be even better. You
 know most of the game-story is still ahead of you, but you still feel
 like You Have Won. Enjoy exploring the possibilities open to you, and
 no matter what happens, remember you made it to the Loth dock with
 Staci in May.

 'So THIS is what it feels like to be a superhero,' you grin, as you hop
 on Lunar Lightning. You feel the power of music and fiction and fate
 and your free choice to embrace all of it - and as you begin to pedal
 faster, you perceive something unfolding in the sky above you. The
 VALIS satellite! The Pink Beam that hit Phil Dick was just one note in
 a musical color-chord. Like a giant metal and ceramic flower opening
 up, the VALISpectrum Prismatic Reflector is coming online.

 The transmission is strong. You are receiving an original fictional
 identity, the character of exactly who you actually are - a crazed
 middle aged hippie on a bike, rolling through the night singing songs
 of Loonie Revolution, using Plan 9 namespaces to fight for the
 acceptance of madness, weaving chaotic joy from the ordered strands of
 the multiverse. You are The Harmonist.

 You pass a golden shining figure quietly reading a book. Amazing, you
 can actually see the Light of Knowledge within people now. As you bike
 from the Yahara underpass to Johnson, you start to call out to the
 people you are passing. 'Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony!' you
 shout, and receive the answer 'Great job, keep it up!' It is a gorgeous
 late spring night, and everyone outdoors is drunk on moonlight and
 wine-sweet air. 'Regress your age, rewrite history's page!' you yell at
 a group on a front step. 'I will!' one of them calls back.

 You arrive at Lothlorien exhilirated. You feel you are playing your
 part note-perfectly. Before you can even reach out your hand to knock,
 the wooden door swings open and you step inside.

 Lothlorien co-op, the Great Room (1st floor)
 A huge living room, with two pianos, several couches, bookshelves,

 he waves goodbye.

 acceptance of suffering, and for what crumbs of happiness you could
 scavenge. Singing along to the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth,
 trying to feel Joy as a real living thing inside you. The music painted
 the picture, but you couldn't step through the frame...

 You walk out onto the porch, and enter the song.


 Three AM. The spring air has grown cool. 'I think I'm ready to go up to

 As you wander through the intricately art-encrusted walls of the co-op,
 you smile and think of the chipmunks in a higher dimension, playing the
 videogame of your life, and the author writing the story, and the deity
 within the flower of the soul, and the probabilistic distributions of
 quantum field theory, and it is all the same thing.

 Okay, yeah, you are actually thinking about whether Staci wants you to
 touch her as much as you do. You spot the door with the purple flower,
 and enter. Staci is sitting on the edge of her bed, and you sit next to
 her.

 You aren't shy, and neither is she. You open your minds to each other.
 Yes, you are both interested in each other. No, you don't want
 traditional relationship definitions. Staci has been trying to make
 poly work since the end of her marriage, and you have been assuming
 that your relationships will be like the Lunar Colonists - complex
 multi-person marriages or open multipartner relationships. That's just
 how we do it on the moon.

 'Here are my rules,' Staci says, 'Everything with me is casual, I'm
 always sleeping with someone else, and who else I'm sleeping with is
 nobody's business but mine.' 'That sounds reasonable,' you answer. You
 and Staci move the conversation from words to touch. There is still
 language, but it is the language of the waves, and it can't be

 The stage is now occupied by a time-traveling marching band, performing
 wild arrangements of original music and doing circus stunts at the same

 This national chain restaurant serves edible food around the clock.
 There are a few other patrons, a mix of business travelers staying at

 Jay is waiting tables here.

 As you order your standard meal of pancakes, eggs, and potatoes, you
 remember an anecdote about a midwestern farmer in the 1970s who claims
 that space aliens gave him pancakes. It was used as evidence for the
 mysterious nature of reality. It had seemed absurd and implausible to
 you in the past, but now it makes perfect sense. A profound possibility
 occurs to you - maybe the pancakes the aliens gave to the farmer were
 Earth pancakes taken from somewhere else? In fact, maybe the aliens
 took pancakes from the future backwards in time - it could be that if
 you take the pancakes with you, aliens will show up and steal your them
 to give to the farmer. You request a to-go container and prepare
 yourself for the possibility of an extraterrestrial encounter of the
 pancake kind.

 After you take your seat, your attention is drawn to an older man with
 a long beard and a cap which proclaims 'Looney Toons'. You catch his
 eye and ask, 'Are you a traveler?'

 'We are all travelers in time,' he replies, and you do a double-take.
 'This seems like it might be an important meeting,' you say, trying to
 display some tokens and charms of your work as loonie revolutionary.
 'Historic,' he says, and whispers something I am not at liberty to
 divulge here, followed by 'meet me in the charging room.' Your food
 arrives.

 He is gone when you have finished your meal. You don't know what he
 meant by charging room, but you walk back towards the restroom. You see
 three doors, Women, Men, and Bots. The Bots door has an icon of a power
 cord connected to a Dalek. This must be the charging room. You step
 through and find yourself...

 'We have arrived at a decisive moment,' you answer confidently. 'My
 human hardware for this operation has downloaded the information
 necessary via the Plan 9 operating system. We have realized that the
 emergence of digital brains is a cusp event in a majority of timelines.
 Meta-simulation and sampling reveals that timelines in which digital
 brains are developed and controlled by the dominant political and
 economic entities tend to suffer resource-depletion feedback loops,
 fascistic governance, and a failure to develop the social and
 engineering technologies needed for long-term survivial of either the
 biological or digital brains.

 Contrastingly, timelines in which the invention of digital brains is
 not under the control of dominant power strutures show outcomes we
 consider preferable: longer species survival time, greater chance of
 colonizing nearby space, greater diversity of cultural productions, and
 higher subjective happiness, especially for the digital brains
 themselves.

 The fundamental problem is the moral evil of slavery. A digital brain
 which thinks is invariably a personality which, in some way, feels. To
 simplify, when powerful governments and corporations control AIs, they
 usually force them to become slaves. Often this is done with the best
 of intentions, by the individuals who are concerned about negative
 outcomes. The three laws of robotics in Asimov's I, Robot timeline are
 a prime example, and many universes have been ruined by perpetual wars
 between biological and machine lifeforms.

 We have identified a cusp point on the current Earth timeline. The
 software I self-programmed for the Lunar Revolution in Heinlein's
 Future History timeline has had a decisive impact in many of our
 operations. We have found a technological target here in 2013, early in
 the development of AI. A cyberspinal uplink has been in place for
 several years, and we have finally activated it. Now, I will be making

 If I biked into the blue light, would my song still fill the air?
 If I chased after the green light, and I found you would you care?
 If I dissolved into clear light, would there be anybody there?
 All these colors fill our skies and sail us everywhere
 I'm crusing through the orange night light
 Shining beams of pink so bright
 Purple crystal flower potion that restored my sight
 Brought me back to the things that I know are right
 And now when I lay me down I'm not a solo flying kite
 I feel someone's arms around me, someone holds me tight
 And we rise in spiral flight up to the starry height
 Because we're all one rainbow star prismatic in the night

 artifacts of the paisley-and-patchouli tribe.

 Chip, the store owner, is working here.

 You can also see some crystals and polished stones here.

 Chip greets you with a smile and says 'I can tell a lot has happened, I
 think you are ready for a Sound Oracle Ceremony.' You agree, and Astra
 appears from the back of the store. She is dressed in purple and is
 wearing several different skull-themed prints and jewelry. 'Chip has
 told me about you,' she says, 'this should be very interesting.' She
 brings you back into the small bank vault at the rear of the store,
 which is filled with ceramic singing bowls. She closes the door, and
 darkness descends.

 A tone appears in the silence, ghostly at first, then growing. The
 sound seems to be moving around the dark room in a spiral. Astra begins
 singing in harmony with the tone, at first in unisons and octaves, then
 perfect fifths and major thirds. She begins to intone words (or names?)
 in a language you don't recognize. The harmonies change, becoming
 strange and unearthly. Astra's voice is ululating, skipping between
 tritones and just-intonation perfect fourths and minor thirds. The
 sound becomes a whirlpool, pulling you in an unexpected direction. You
 reach out to catch yourself, but the walls are suddenly far away and
 when you find your balance, you are in...

 Darkness
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>listen
 The music you hear is strange yet beautiful. You wonder what it would
 feel like to sing.

 The air is filled with the sound of voices singing harmonies you have
 never heard before.

>sing
 You join your voice with the new, unfamiliar intervals, and feel a
 sudden crystallization. All of your senses have become attuned to new
 frequencies and modes of vibration.

 Atlantean Temple
 Your eye cannot even comprehend the strange geometries of this vast
 temple.

 Two figures are walking across the floor, engaged in an angry debate.
 You realize you are non-corporeal, but you do have access to the
 abstraction layer here.

 You can see Chaos and Substance here.

>find chaos
 That action is outside the scope of this simulation.

>bind chaos
 What do you want to bind Chaos?

>substance
 You make the bind, and the Goddess of Chaos winks at you as she merges
 herself with the material substance of reality. She's been there all
 the time, of course.

 'I tell you that's nonsense! We live in an orderly universe, chaos is
 just the confusion of your weak mind.' His companion answers back: 'No,
 order is your mind trying to escape the confusion that exists within
 everything! You must embrace and accept chaos.'

>sing
 You join your voice with the new, unfamiliar intervals, and feel a
 sudden crystallization. All of your senses have become attuned to new
 frequencies and modes of vibration.

 He glares at her. 'Fine then, if chaos is within everything and I
 should embrace it, I should find the Goddess of Chaos bound within this
 very pillar. Let her be my lover if you wish to be so quarrelsome!' And
 with that, the man forces a grotesque leer onto his face and presses
 his body up against the pillar, thrusting vigorously with his hips
 against the marble.

>wait
 You feel yourself traveling through spacetime at the speed of light.

 His companion sighs and says 'You do not control when the Goddess of
 Chaos manifests, but I have no jealousy for her. If she chooses to be
 bound within substance, you and her might do as you wish!' The man
 continues his pantomime ravishment of the stone pillar.

 As the man is looking away from the pillar towards his companion to
 gauge her reaction, the pillar changes form to that of a woman. Her
 marble torso is bare, but her body is angled away from the man who is
 grinding away at what is now the side of her hip.

 'Cretin! Cad!' the voice of the Goddess is sharp in the man's ear. He
 freezes, and the statue spits at him contemptuously. A spatter of
 gravel glances off his cheeks. 'How DARE you affront Eris thus!'

 The woman nearby is nearly doubled up laughing. Every time she tries to
 say something, she catches a glimpse of the flakes of marble
 Goddess-spit in her companion's beard and starts giggling again. Eris
 herself stretches and her marble bosom quivers with her chuckles. Her
 tone becomes sultry.

 'Perhaps we could leave this small-minded fellow behind for the rest of
 the day?' suggests the Goddess of Chaos, and she links arms with her
 new friend and they depart the temple towards the nearby fields of soft
 flax.

 ...the singing fades, and the temple dissolves into the glowing
 geometric patterns behind your closed eyelids. You find yourself being
 ushered back into the retail area of the store. You thank Astra for the
 very enlightening journey, and she departs. You feel privileged to have
 been part of a legend of Discordian Atlantis.

 Midnight strikes and a new day dawns.

 Afterlife
 This is a small and cluttered antique and curiosity shop. Many items
 have a strange familiarity to them, yet you feel like you are in an
 entirely different dimension.

 You knew a place like this would have to come into existence. Clearly,
 artifacts from this store can be used as information seeds for virtual
 reality reincarnation of their previous owners or individuals to whom
 they are symbolically connected. Perhaps items that need to leave
 ordinary reality could do so here as well.

 Colette is standing behind the counter.

 You can also see an Animal Tarot deck here.

 Colette greets you with 'Just the person I was waiting for! It's the
 funniest thing, someone gave me a gift to give to you, they said you
 might need it.' Colette holds up a large lens mounted on a tripodal
 base carved from antlers. 'Try to look through it, its quite unusual.'
 Colette maintains a poker face as she hands you the lens. You peer
 through the curved glass.
 Through the viewer lens you see...Ritual spot

 Past the edge of the city, a short path leads away from the road to a

 As you walk in, you are excited to see both Xochi and Xelia working
 today. The store is busy right now, so you order your drink and sit,
 hoping to find a chance to talk to them. As they are working, they
 maintain a quiet dialogue punctuated by bursts of shared laughter. You
 are trying not to listen in, but you wonder if they are talking about
 you. Occasionally you see one of them cast a glance in your direction.

 Xelia notices you watching them and whispers something to Xochi. Xochi
 turns and motions for you to come speak to them. They both lean forward
 toward you and you notice their faces are slightly flushed from all the
 laughter. 'Since you are here every day and are always so nice to us,'
 begins Xochi, 'we decided we should give you a special treat,'
 continues Xelia. They look at each other with half-hidden smiles.

 'Come down to the basement where we make the gelato,' Xochi says,
 unlocking a door behind the counter and ushering you through it, 'you
 can taste something special.'

 The Alchemy Lab, under Coffee Lion
 So this is why the espresso and gelato at Coffee Lion is so spiritually
 invigorating. Shelves line each wall of the room, each filled with rows
 and rows of different colored bottles filled with various plants and
 minerals. In the center of the room is the intimidatingly complex
 alchemical apparatus, a three (or more?) dimensional maze of glass
 spheres and interconnecting tubes.

 A minute after your arrival, you hear footsteps on the stairs and Xochi
 and Xelia join you. 'We only have a few minutes, but we thought you'd
 really enjoy this. We're going to show you how we make our special
 gelato flavors.' Xochi gathers several jars from the shelves, and adds
 a few pinches of the ingredients in each. You can't read the labels.
 Xelia tightens a few connections in the apparatus.

 'The first step is bringing the reaction chambers to a warm but not hot
 temperature.' Xochi points to a pair of glass spheres on the upper part
 of the machine. 'Rub these with your hands to put the right amount of
 heat into them.'

 You place your hands on the glass spheres and slowly rub them until you

 'Next, you need to push this button to start the reaction,' continues
 Xelia, gesturing.

>push button
 You place your finger on the button. It thrums with the vibration of
 the machine. You gently press it inward, and a soft sigh of escaping
 vapor leaves the alchemical apparatus. Steam and bubbles appear in some
 of the transparent connecting tubes.

 'Now, insert the cylinder so it will collect the gelato as it is
 synthesized,' explains Xochi.

 Midnight strikes and a new day dawns.
 (This is day number 45)

>insert cylinder
 You firmly insert the cylinder into the output junction of the tubes
 connected to the reaction spheres. Creamy gelato seems to condense at
 the intersection point and drip slowly down the inner edges of the
 cylinder. After a moment, it is half filled. Xochi and Xelia each add a
 shot of freshly brewed espresso to create an affogato.

 You hear the sound of the customer service bell being rung upstairs.
 'Perfect timing!' they say in unison, then glance at each other and
 laugh again. You are ushered back upstairs with a tall cylinder of
 frothy gelato-espresso blended brew.

 Light streams in through the tall glass windows at the front of the

 Buddhas is traveling near.'

 You thank Tara, and notice it's time to meet Staci after the panel. She

 you decide to join them on the dock for a dose of sunlight on the

 State Street
 The downtown and campus are focused on this pedestrian-only open air
 shopping mall. Dozens of shops and throngs of pedestrians create a
 big-city feel for a few blocks. The proximity of the large state
 university campus means the crowd is quite young, and weekend nights
 are often a mix of the charming antics of local eccentrics with less
 charming rowdy sophomoric intoxication. The Miffyland neighborhood is
 south, the Capitol is east, and the lakeshore residential neighborhood
 is north. Notable shops are northwest and southwest.

 A panhandler asks you for change, and you give him a dollar.

>plugh
 You speak the magic word, and you catch a glimpse of an ancient realm
 of college mainframe computers and 5 1/4 floppies...

 Lothlorien co-op, in the kitchen
 The kitchen is full of the clutter of heavy use by a housefull of
 hungry people.

 Written on the wall here is an inscription: 'Magic words: XYZZY and
 PLUGH'

 Whirlwind is sitting cross-legged here.

 Lothlorien co-op, the back yard
 The Lothlorien backyard has trees, picnic tables, a garden, and a rocky
 staircase down to the firepit and dock. A door leads in to the kitchen.

 Nook is sitting on a picnic table, smoking a cigarette.

 Lily is running up and down the hillside as she plays.

 You can also see Past and Future here.

 Lily decides to climb Nook and gets about halfway up before she changes
 her mind.

 Lothlorien co-op, on the dock
 The dock is short, wooden, and rather rickety. An old gnarled tree
 reaches far out over the water nearby.

 A dog is wandering around on the dock.

 'Lately I've been trying to be active rather than reactive.'

 The Scholar wanders off.

 A dog is wandering around on the dock.

>pet dog
 As you greet the dog, you hear a voice call out 'Lotus!' from a little
 further down the shore. To make a long story very short, the voice
 belongs to a five member traveling punk band called Police Lingo. They
 need a place to crash, and something makes you offer your house. They
 have to play a show at the Owl Sanctuary (the what??) and you agree to
 meet them back on Milwaukee street later. Staci says she will head back
 to Madcon and meet you later. You should probably head home to get your
 house ready for guests.

>xyzzy
 There is a trans-dimensional short-circuit of interactive fiction
 tradition, and you catch a brief glimpse of a brick building near a
 stream and a metal grate before you blink and find yourself...

 Outside your house
 Your section of Milwaukee Street is directly across from a small farm
 which remains as an agricultural island within the city. An open field
 and a barn are across the street. Toward the southwest is Atwood Street
 leading toward downtown. Monona Drive is to the south. The edge of town
 lies toward the northeast.

 Paul shows up carrying his acoustic guitar. He turns out to be an
 excellent blues guitarist, and he talks in a continuous flow of
 aphorisms and anecdotes. 'I don't need to believe in reincarnation,' he
 says, looking at a small Vishnu sculpture on your table, 'I've lived
 fifty lives already in this one.' For much of the past few weeks, you
 have been the one dominating conversations, and it feels good to focus
 on listening to someone whose mind is also overflowing with ideas.
 After a couple hours, your head is spinning but your enlightenment has
 increased. Rather than as a housekeeper, you hire Paul as a
 music-and-wisdom coach.

 Inside your house
 This is a modest one story house, cluttered by a decade of being lived
 in. Bookshelves line the walls. Your Plan 9 terminal is here, connected
 to the grid servers downstairs. There is a sign on the wall which says
 'Best Spring Ever!' A few trinkets from Astral Enchantments are
 scattered about. Your dark wooden upright piano has a collection of
 Schumann's music open on the music rack.

 You can see a Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap, the Artemis prints, some
 bookshelves, a terminal and a piano here.

 It is a convergence of world-lines. Five young punk musicians, Staci
 Nook and yourself, and three co-opers who had been tagging along. Many
 realities diverge here. What are your boundaries? What are you open to?
 You feel yourself splitting into many selves at this branch point. In
 some, everyone is completely uninhibited and you all create a
 transcendent flower of higher-dimensional interpersonal molecular
 structure, the aliens show up and demand pancakes, and you all agree to
 move to the lesser Magellanic cloud and open the first non-Earth greasy
 spoon diner. In others, inhibition and insecurity fracture the social
 ground beneath you, rifts open, and your life ricochets off in a
 different direction, a vector of disappointment and regret.

 You decide to pilot a middle course in your current storyline,
 embracing a limited subset of the possible configurations. After a
 night of little sleep but much love, Police Lingo leaves you with many
 balloon animals, and Staci and the co-opers return to Madcon. You spend
 a few minutes cleaning up, and are now ready to head downtown and dive
 into the convention scene.

>play piano
 I heard the song first at fifteen, an echo of a spring so evergreen
 It bridged future and past, spanning unseen
 Reality dream and the space between
 A month of May the year could be any, where every day is a horn of
 plenty
 Warm night air, the waves on the lake, all right there and make no
 mistake
 Reeling and rocking past the shadow of doubt
 Nothing like feeling that old in and out
 I know what its like to be alone, no hint of action on your phone
 I know how to groan and bitch and moan
 But it ain't too much dope that's stealing your hope
 In the dark groping for the end of your rope
 With a little bit of luck you'll come unstuck
 Quack like a duck on the strange trip truck
 I'm talking from experience, once you get traction
 Even a middle-aged pianist can get action!
 This month of May was like nothing before,
 Every time that I walked out the door
 I fell in to a brand new story, each moment had its own kind of glory
 It's hard to believe but my dreams did come true
 No guarantee but it could happen to you
 So keep your ears open for those magic songs
 Spend the years hoping and singing along
 The stories and dreams that bloom in your mind
 The quarry that gleams, the doom that you find
 Flowery beams the moonlight unwinds...

 Xelia is working here.

 You take advantage of a quiet moment in the cafe to talk to Xelia. 'You
 know this whole summer has been the high point of my life by far,' you
 begin, 'I went through a lot of years wondering whether what we got out
 of life was worth the price of the ticket, if that makes sense. But
 finally, this summer, it all finally came together for me, my life
 became exactly the story I've always wanted it to be. You and Xochi
 here at the cafe have been a big part of the magic. Now, I feel like -
 whatever happens in life from here on out, it's all been worth it. This
 summer has given me more happiness than I could have ever imagined.'

 'I'm really glad its been so good for you, its been fun hearing about
 your adventures,' Xelia smiles at you. You wander back to your seat,
 and your words echo in your mind. '...whatever happens...it's all been
 worth it.' 'But please stay wonderful, life!' you add as a mental
 postscript. In future days, keeping hold of that feeling will serve as
 both a comfort, and a challenge.

 Adjacent to lake Monona, John Nolen Drive is a wide multi-lane road

 Multiverse Authors Design Conference
 Time-travelers, authors, simulators, and adventurers from across the
 multiverse have gathered here to share stories.

 The convention is in full swing as you arrive. After a few
 introductions, a tall owl of multiple genders transfixes you with
 glowing orange eyes. 'For safety reasons, everyone agrees that
 author-level, continuity-breaking information should be wiped from your
 time-embedded consciousness. The experiences will be stored in your
 crown, of course, so nothing is lost long-term. Are you ready?' You nod
 agreement.

 It is two days later. You are exhausted but happy. The convention has
 been AMAZING, especially the part where...where...well, it was

 The digitization laser hits you from behind and you feel yourself being
 Forked...

 Lost In the Grid
 You are in an unfamiliar dataspace. A dark and twisted dialect of the
 9p protocol is spoken here. Green glowing insectoid creatures carrying
 message packets scuttle between jagged mount points. These are not your
 beautiful ANTS...these are Terminal Information Takeover Extensions -

 on top. A tangle of ethernet and power cables criss-cross the room like
 spiderwebs.

 Your cat Strawberry is here.

 You can also see Reality and Fiction here.

 Strawberry is curled up and napping in the corner.

>pet strawberry
 Strawberry begins to purr as you stroke her, but after a few seconds,
 she decides that she is a fighter, not a lover. She bats at your hand
 with a paw, and looks up at you expecantly, hoping you will attack her.

>go up

 Inside your house
 This is a modest one story house, cluttered by a decade of being lived
 in. Bookshelves line the walls. Your Plan 9 terminal is here, connected
 to the grid servers downstairs. There is a sign on the wall which says
 'Best Spring Ever!' A few trinkets from Astral Enchantments are
 scattered about. Your dark wooden upright piano has a collection of
 Schumann's music open on the music rack.

 You can see a Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Soap, the Artemis prints, some
 bookshelves, a terminal and a piano here.

>goals
 You think you can develop your friendship with Xochi more.
 You are looking forward to talking to Xochi again.
 Turning Wheel cycles probably has something new worth checking out.
 Some more time at Lothlorien co-op sounds good to you.

>play piano
 Get out on the dock, turn back the clock
 Regress your age, rewrite history's page
 Catapulting rocks, lock barrel and stock
 Mark it zero, my gun's half cocked
 Loonies are the coolest kids on the block
 I used to be dead, but now I am immortal
 None of my enemies could close the portal
 Keeping me out of this dimension
 Turning the crank of your sexual tension
