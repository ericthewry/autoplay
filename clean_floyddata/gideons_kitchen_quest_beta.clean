 Mother's voice weighs you down like a bag of sand. You grasp Teddy
 harder as you stare hypnotized at the huge finger stabbing the air not
 more than half an inch from your nose. You shrink back.
 "Behave now you damned little devil. You little beast! If I hear a
 single word from out here when I talk to your dear aunt, a single
 word...

 There is no need for her to finish as the tightness of her puffy lips
 and the steel in her eyes tells you all you need to know.

 Your enormous and absolutely terrifying mother stares intently at you
 for an excruciatingly long moment before she turns around. She stomps
 away towards the next room, and then she stops. Just when you think
 that she is going to move on, she turns and comes back. Your heart
 nearly escapes your body when she smiles.

 convinced now that your mother is an alien, or something unimaginably
 worse, you try to back away from her. There is no way out though. In
 one smooth move, she rips Teddy from your grasp and you can barely
 stop a shriek of horror as his warm fur looses contact with you. She
 starts to walk away again but changes her mind. She places Teddy on
 the counter, brings a chair over, steps up on the chair herself and
 places Teddy on top of the cabinet. It's the scary place, alldarkness,
 dust and eight-legged creatures. Without mercy, she shoves him into
 the corner up there. The dark corner.

 You look for Teddy up there in the scary place, longing for him.

 Mother brings the chair with her, grabs the second chair in passing
 the table, and carries them off with her. She doesn't give you another
 glance. After a few more moments, you can hear the clinking of cups
 and the creaking from living room furniture under strain.

 You look at the darkness where Teddy is, although all you see is a
 vague brown and red shape, and you know in your heart that Teddy is
 reaching for you. Teddy is afraid of high places, high and dark places
 in particular. Does she not know?

 Gideon's Kitchen Quest!

 By Jenny Brennan 2008.

 You sit quietly in the corner. Singing a tuneless song under your
 breath, afraid of being heard.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Kitchen</span> (in the dark corner)
 This is the kitchen. Here, you spend most of your time, mostly sitting
 quietly in the corner. There is a stove, a monster of a stove, in one
 corner. A giant pot of pea soup is puttering away on top of it. A
 solid wooden table takes pride of place in the middle of the kitchen,
 although it looks strange without the chairs. A huge cabinet with
 glass doors stands in the corner opposite to the dark corner. It's
 full of that yucky china that Mother seems to like so much. Above the
 cabinet, it is dark. Too dark for a poor Teddy.
 There is a lot of counter too, with two big drawers and a bread box.

 You can see a dark hole behind a loose board (which is empty) here.

>examine stove


 Sorry, aint nothing like that here.

>examine hole


 One of the boards in the dark corner is loose. There is a dark hole
 behind it. It is big enough to hide something valuable in there. You
 don't think that Mother knows.

>look in hole


 The dark hole behind a loose board is empty.

>examine board


 Sorry, aint nothing like that here.

>examine me


 You are Gideon. Four years old and an only child. Teddy is your best,
 your only, friend in the whole wide world.

>examine table


 The huge table stands in the middle of the kitchen. It is a big and
 heavy wooden table with many years of grease and grime as varnish.

>examine counter


 You can do nothing from where you are.

>climb table


 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.
 "Well well, isn't that something...}

>climb counter


 You can do nothing from where you are.

>examine me


 You are Gideon. Four years old and an only child. Teddy is your best,
 your only, friend in the whole wide world.

>examine china


 (the china cabinet)
 The huge cabinet stands in the northwest corner of the kitchen. It is
 full of all the old ugly china that your mother won't let you touch,
 not that you would ever want to. You really don't see the point in
 those old ugly things anyway. The dusty glass doors are always locked
 and the top rises higher than the other cabinets in the kitchen.
 The old clock in the other room ticks.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>pray


 Nothing practical results from your prayer.

>examine soup


 Eeew! is all you have to say about that.

>open drawer


 Which do you mean, the first drawer or the second drawer?

>open first drawer


 You will have to leave the dark corner. You can't do anything as long
 as you're sitting there.

>stand up


 You get out of the corner.

>open first drawer


 You grab the handle on the first drawer and pull on it. There is a
 grinding noise and you glance at the hallway. Very carefully, you open
 the drawer. In the first drawer are some knives and forks and a bundle
 of rags.
 You've got to set everything straight before Mother comes.

>examine rags


 A bundle of rags that Mother uses when she polishes the furniture.
 That doesn't happen very often. They are brown and if squished
 together a bit, it could be mistaken for a certain little bear. As
 long as the look is quick and very cursory that is.
 You throw a glance towards the hallway. Time is short.

>examine stove


 Sorry, aint nothing like that here.

>climb counter


 The counter is not a place where you want to go. It is so clean and
 perfect that mother would see a spot of dirt a mile away. You climbed
 up there once so you could look out the window. The horror of it is
 still fresh in your mind. You shudder and shake your head.
 You've got to set everything straight before Mother comes.
 The old clock in the other room ticks.

>open second drawer


 You grab the handle on the second drawer and pull on it. There is a
 grinding noise and you glance at the hallway. Very carefully, you open
 the drawer. In the second drawer are a meat tenderizer and a red
 kitchen towel.
 You look around. This is not good.
 You hear Mothers voice. To your horror, she is calling your name.
 "GIDEON? Are you behaving?" All you can manage is a frantic not of the
 head towards the hallway. You know that she expects no answer from
 you. "We will eat at four and your fingernails better not be dirty"

 You stare at your blackened nails and even though you know Mother
 can't see you, you quickly hide your hands behind your back. Finally,
 your mother turns to her sister in the other room and the chitchat
 starts again. Aunt Evelyn giggles. You would hate to know what was so
 terribly funny.

>examine fingernails


 Sorry, aint nothing like that here.

>open cabinet


 It seems to be locked.
 You grind your teeth. Time is running out.
 The old clock in the other room ticks.

>listen


 You can hear spoons clinking in their cups, chit chatter and crunching
 on cookies from the living room.
 You've got to set everything straight before Mother comes.
 You hear your mother's voice.
 "Oh, dear me. I had better check on my soup soon. I'll just finish
 this cup of tea first."

>take rags


 Taken.
 You throw a glance towards the hallway. Time is short.

>close drawer


 Which do you mean, the first drawer or the second drawer?

>close first


 Very slowly, you close the noisy drawer again.
 You look around. This is not good.
 Suddenly, Mother stands there with an iron grip on the scruff of your
 neck.
 "STOP SQUIRMING! I believe I told you to behave. What do you do? You
 ungrateful beast! I believe you are sleeping in the cellar tonight.
 Without Teddy!"


     <span class="floydstyle i">*** Teddy was washed. He will never be the same again. ***</span>

 Aunt Evelyn slurps loudly.

 You put both hands on the edge of the table and push as hard as you

 horrible sound. You stop immediately, heart thumping.
 "Did you hear something Dear sister?" everything is dead quiet. You
 hold your breath.
 "Oh, No dear" your aunt says with a high-pitched giggle. "I believe
 that might have been me. You know about my little problems don't you

 the table. Perhaps when Mother is in the bathroom.

>wait


 Four o'clock is coming up fast.
 In the other room, Mother seems to be talking about compost.
 "oh dear. I hate to disturb your visits this way darling sister, but I
 really need to visit the little girl's room. You don't mind do you
 dear?"
 You can hear Mother's heavy steps hurrying across the hallway floor.
 Fortunately, they disappear into the bathroom. The door closes, the
 lock clicks.

>move table


 You put your tiny hands against the edge of the table and for a moment
 your courage falters. Then you shut your eyes hard and push. The table
 legs grind and studder against the floor and it moves. Grunting,
 straining, you manage to push the table against the big china cabinet,
 careful not to push it so far that it might break something.
 "Are you alright in there dear sister?" No answer from the bathroom.

 is necessary to hold your breath.

 Your aunt Evelyn mutters something apologetic as you expect to either
 get sick or start to laugh uncontrollably. Luckily for you, the air

 You listen. Aunt Evelyn seems to be talking about her poor dead cat.

>move bread


 You gingerly push the loaf of bread until it flips over. That's where
 Mother hides the key for the cabinet. You quickly take the key.

>unlock cabinet with key


 You unlock the china cabinet.
 "oh dear. I hate to disturb your visits this way darling sister, but I
 really need to visit the little girl's room. You don't mind do you
 dear?"
 You can hear Mother's heavy steps hurrying across the hallway floor.
 Fortunately, they disappear into the bathroom. The door closes, the
 lock clicks.

>close box


 You close the bread box.
 Aunt Evelyn slurps loudly.
 The old clock in the other room ticks.

>climb cabinet


 There is nothing but glass on the cabinet door. There is nothing to
 climb. You will have to get the door opened first and then try.
 Aunt Evelyn gets up from her chair. After a moment she sits back down
 with a sigh.

>open cabinet


 You open the china cabinet.
 Mother checks the bathroom door just to be sure it's locked.

>climb cabinet


 You put your foot on the bottom shelf of the cabinet. There is a soft
 clink, then another. You hold your breath as you very slowly step back
 from the shelf.

 There are too many breakable things stacked on the lower shelves ,
 there is no way you can step on them without breaking something. The
 shelves higher up seem like they have more room though. The only thing
 that might be a problem is a big crystal vase on a high shelf. That
 one might be possible to push to a safe position though.
 Water is running in the bathroom. Surely, mother isn't done yet?
 Your tummy growls.

>push table


 You put your tiny hands against the edge of the table and for a moment
 your courage falters. Then you shut your eyes hard and push. The table
 legs grind and studder against the floor and it moves. Grunting,
 straining, you manage to push the table against the big china cabinet,
 careful not to push it so far that it might break something.
 Water is running in the bathroom. Surely, mother isn't done yet?

>get on table


 You get onto the kitchen table.
 Strange noises emerge from behind the bathroom door. You try not to
 think about it.

>examine vase


 On one of the higher shelves stands the biggest, and most sparkling,
 vase you've ever seen. Mother says it's far too fine to keep anywhere
 other than in the cabinet. You wonder about that sometimes. If it's so
 fine, then you'd want to show everybody wouldn't you?
 "Are you alright in there dear sister?" No answer from the bathroom.

>push vase


 You push the vase deeper into the cabinet. Now there is space on the
 shelf and the vase is safe.
 Mother checks the bathroom door just to be sure it's locked.

>climb cabinet


 You put your foot on the shelf, grab the edge, and put your weight on
 the shelf. There is a slight creaking from it but finally your eyes
 are above the edge. Teddy is there. He reaches for you.
 Aunt Evelyn gets up from her chair. After a moment she sits back down
 with a sigh.

>get teddy


 You reach for Teddy. He is tucked all the way into the corner and you
 stretch your arm as much as you can. You feel him, you reach harder,
 and you have him. Teddy is saved!
 Water is running in the bathroom. Surely, mother isn't done yet?

 You drop down on the table with a thud that is a bit too loud for
 comfort.
 Mother checks the bathroom door just to be sure it's locked.

 You get back down on the floor.

>open breadbox


 You open the bread box, revealing a crusty loaf of bread.
 Aunt Evelyn gets up from her chair. After a moment she sits back down
 with a sigh.
 A rumbling seems to shake the floors and you stop breathing for a
 moment. Then the cloud rolls in over the floor towards you and now it
 is necessary to hold your breath.

 Your aunt Evelyn mutters something apologetic as you expect to either
 get sick or start to laugh uncontrollably. Luckily for you, the air
 clears and you get control of yourself.
 There's a sound from the hallway but there is no one there.

>put key under bread


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>put key in breadbox


 You put the fancy looking key into the bread box.
 Water is running in the bathroom. Surely, mother isn't done yet?
 The toilet flushes, the bathroom door opens, heavy steps over the
 hallway into the living room.
 "Sorry dear, now what were we talking about?"

>close breadbox


 You close the bread box.
 You throw a glance towards the hallway. Time is short.
 You hear your mother's voice.
 "Oh, dear me. I had better check on my soup soon. I'll just finish
 this cup of tea first."

>push table


 You put both hands on the edge of the table and push as hard as you
 can. The table legs studder and grind against the floor, making a
 horrible sound. You stop immediately, heart thumping.
 "Did you hear something Dear sister?" everything is dead quiet. You
 hold your breath.
 "Oh, No dear" your aunt says with a high-pitched giggle. "I believe
 that might have been me. You know about my little problems don't you
 dear? Now give me some more of that wonderful tea. Apple cinnamon is
 it?"
 You've got to set everything straight before Mother comes.
 The old clock in the other room ticks.

>get in corner


 You get into the dark corner.
 You grind your teeth. Time is running out.

>wait


 Four o'clock is coming up fast.
 You look around. This is not good.
 Suddenly, Mother stands there. She keeps glancing at you as she goes
 to stir her soup, eyes cold and suspicious.

>mother, hello


 You can't talk to Mother.

>examine mother


 Mother is enormous. She stirs her soup with the same energy as when
 she mixes cement or turns the compost.
 Suddenly she stares at you, eyes narrowing to dangerous slits between
 fat eye-lids.
 "What is that in your hand you little devil?" In a second she has an
 iron grip on your arm. "DON'T SQUIRM! Do you want to go in the cellar
 again? Without Teddy?"

 Mother's voice weighs you down like a bag of sand. You grasp Teddy
 harder as you stare hypnotized at the huge finger stabbing the air not
 more than half an inch from your nose. You shrink back.
 "Behave now you damned little devil. You little beast! If I hear a
 single word from out here when I talk to your dear aunt, a single
 word...

 There is no need for her to finish as the tightness of her puffy lips
 and the steel in her eyes tells you all you need to know.

 Your enormous and absolutely terrifying mother stares intently at you
 for an excruciatingly long moment before she turns around. She stomps
 away towards the next room, and then she stops. Just when you think
 that she is going to move on, she turns and comes back. Your heart
 nearly escapes your body when she smiles.

 convinced now that your mother is an alien, or something unimaginably
 worse, you try to back away from her. There is no way out though. In
 one smooth move, she rips Teddy from your grasp and you can barely
 stop a shriek of horror as his warm fur looses contact with you. She
 starts to walk away again but changes her mind. She places Teddy on
 the counter, brings a chair over, steps up on the chair herself and
 places Teddy on top of the cabinet. It's the scary place, alldarkness,
 dust and eight-legged creatures. Without mercy, she shoves him into
 the corner up there. The dark corner.

 You look for Teddy up there in the scary place, longing for him.

 Mother brings the chair with her, grabs the second chair in passing
 the table, and carries them off with her. She doesn't give you another
 glance. After a few more moments, you can hear the clinking of cups
 and the creaking from living room furniture under strain.

 You look at the darkness where Teddy is, although all you see is a
 vague brown and red shape, and you know in your heart that Teddy is
 reaching for you. Teddy is afraid of high places, high and dark places
 in particular. Does she not know?

 You sit quietly in the corner. Singing a tuneless song under your
 breath, afraid of being heard.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Kitchen</span> (in the dark corner)
 This is the kitchen. Here, you spend most of your time, mostly sitting
 quietly in the corner. There is a stove, a monster of a stove, in one
 corner. A giant pot of pea soup is puttering away on top of it. A
 solid wooden table takes pride of place in the middle of the kitchen,
 although it looks strange without the chairs. A huge cabinet with
 glass doors stands in the corner opposite to the dark corner. It's
 full of that yucky china that Mother seems to like so much. Above the
 cabinet, it is dark. Too dark for a poor Teddy.
 There is a lot of counter too, with two big drawers and a bread box.

 You can see a dark hole behind a loose board (which is empty) here.

>stand


 You get out of the corner.

>open first drawer


 You grab the handle on the first drawer and pull on it. There is a
 grinding noise and you glance at the hallway. Very carefully, you open
 the drawer. In the first drawer are some knives and forks and a bundle
 of rags.
 Your tummy is in a knot. You stare at the hallway again.

>take rags


 Taken.
 You grind your teeth. Time is running out.

>close first drawer


 Very slowly, you close the noisy drawer again.

>open box


 You open the bread box, revealing a crusty loaf of bread.
 You stop to listen. Aunt Evelyn giggles.

 "...well dear sister, don't you think that.."
 There's a sound from the hallway but there is no one there.

 You get into the dark corner.
 There's a sudden creak from the old chair in the other room and you
 freeze.

 You hear Mothers voice. To your horror, she is calling your name.
 "GIDEON? Are you behaving?" All you can manage is a frantic not of the
 head towards the hallway. You know that she expects no answer from
 you. "We will eat at four and your fingernails better not be dirty"

 You stare at your blackened nails and even though you know Mother
 can't see you, you quickly hide your hands behind your back. Finally,
 your mother turns to her sister in the other room and the chitchat
 starts again. Aunt Evelyn giggles. You would hate to know what was so
 terribly funny.

 room.

 A bundle of rags that Mother uses when she polishes the furniture.

 Once on the table, you put your foot on the high shelf of the cabinet.
 You grasp the edge at the top of the cabinet and put your weight on

 There is a terrible clinking, the sound of something toppling over,
 and a clear crisp crash from broken crystal. Horrified, you stare at
 about a trillion glittering pieces spread across the kitchen floor.

 Like in a nightmare, you hear the steps, you feel the dragon breathe
 down your neck, you do not turn your head. Your fingers are still
 grasping the ledge at the top of the china cabinet, with one foot on
 the shelf, and the other foot sticking out behind you.

 As if shoved by cruel fate, Teddy suddenly falls over and a soft furry
 paw brushes against your fingers.

 So close. So far away.

>climb cabinet


 Once on the table, you put your foot on the high shelf of the cabinet.
 You grasp the edge at the top of the cabinet and put your weight on
 the shelf.
 There is a terrible clinking, the sound of something toppling over,
 and a clear crisp crash from broken crystal. Horrified, you stare at
 about a trillion glittering pieces spread across the kitchen floor.

 Like in a nightmare, you hear the steps, you feel the dragon breathe
 down your neck, you do not turn your head. Your fingers are still
 grasping the ledge at the top of the china cabinet, with one foot on
 the shelf, and the other foot sticking out behind you.

 As if shoved by cruel fate, Teddy suddenly falls over and a soft furry
 paw brushes against your fingers.

 So close. So far away.

 long as the look is quick and very cursory that is.
 You look around. This is not good.
 Suddenly, Mother stands there with an iron grip on the scruff of your
 neck.
 "STOP SQUIRMING! I believe I told you to behave. What do you do? You
 ungrateful beast! I believe you are sleeping in the cellar tonight.

 One of the boards in the dark corner is loose. There is a dark hole
 behind it. It is big enough to hide something valuable in there. You
 don't think that Mother knows.
 Aunt Evelyn slurps loudly.
 There's a sound from the hallway but there is no one there.

>examine corner


 This is the dark corner. Mother lets you stand there with your face
 against the wall when you've been bad and let you sit down and be
 invisible when she doesn't want to be disturbed. It is dark and smells
 kind of funny. That is usually no problem as long as Teddy is with you
 but without him, the southeast corner of the kitchen is dark and
 scary.
 Aunt Evelyn gets up from her chair. After a moment she sits back down
 with a sigh.
 A rumbling seems to shake the floors and you stop breathing for a
 moment. Then the cloud rolls in over the floor towards you and now it
 is necessary to hold your breath.

 Your aunt Evelyn mutters something apologetic as you expect to either
 get sick or start to laugh uncontrollably. Luckily for you, the air
 clears and you get control of yourself.

 Mother's voice weighs you down like a bag of sand. You grasp Teddy
 harder as you stare hypnotized at the huge finger stabbing the air not
 more than half an inch from your nose. You shrink back.
 "Behave now you damned little devil. You little beast! If I hear a
 single word from out here when I talk to your dear aunt, a single
 word...

 There is no need for her to finish as the tightness of her puffy lips
 and the steel in her eyes tells you all you need to know.

 Your enormous and absolutely terrifying mother stares intently at you
 for an excruciatingly long moment before she turns around. She stomps
 away towards the next room, and then she stops. Just when you think
 that she is going to move on, she turns and comes back. Your heart
 nearly escapes your body when she smiles.

 convinced now that your mother is an alien, or something unimaginably
 worse, you try to back away from her. There is no way out though. In
 one smooth move, she rips Teddy from your grasp and you can barely
 stop a shriek of horror as his warm fur looses contact with you. She
 starts to walk away again but changes her mind. She places Teddy on
 the counter, brings a chair over, steps up on the chair herself and
 places Teddy on top of the cabinet. It's the scary place, alldarkness,
 dust and eight-legged creatures. Without mercy, she shoves him into
 the corner up there. The dark corner.

 You look for Teddy up there in the scary place, longing for him.

 Mother brings the chair with her, grabs the second chair in passing
 the table, and carries them off with her. She doesn't give you another
 glance. After a few more moments, you can hear the clinking of cups
 and the creaking from living room furniture under strain.

 You look at the darkness where Teddy is, although all you see is a
 vague brown and red shape, and you know in your heart that Teddy is
 reaching for you. Teddy is afraid of high places, high and dark places
 in particular. Does she not know?

 Gideon's Kitchen Quest!

 By Jenny Brennan 2008.

 You sit quietly in the corner. Singing a tuneless song under your
 breath, afraid of being heard.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The Kitchen</span> (in the dark corner)
 This is the kitchen. Here, you spend most of your time, mostly sitting
 quietly in the corner. There is a stove, a monster of a stove, in one
 corner. A giant pot of pea soup is puttering away on top of it. A
 solid wooden table takes pride of place in the middle of the kitchen,
 although it looks strange without the chairs. A huge cabinet with
 glass doors stands in the corner opposite to the dark corner. It's
 full of that yucky china that Mother seems to like so much. Above the
 cabinet, it is dark. Too dark for a poor Teddy.
 There is a lot of counter too, with two big drawers and a bread box.

 You can see a dark hole behind a loose board (which is empty) here.

>stand


 You get out of the corner.

>open first drawer


 You grab the handle on the first drawer and pull on it. There is a
 grinding noise and you glance at the hallway. Very carefully, you open
 the drawer. In the first drawer are some knives and forks and a bundle
 of rags.
 You grind your teeth. Time is running out.

>take rags


 Taken.
 You've got to set everything straight before Mother comes.

>close first drawer


 Very slowly, you close the noisy drawer again.

>open box


 You open the bread box, revealing a crusty loaf of bread.

>move bread


 You gingerly push the loaf of bread until it flips over. That's where
 Mother hides the key for the cabinet. You quickly take the key.

 You put both hands on the edge of the table and push as hard as you
 can. The table legs studder and grind against the floor, making a
 horrible sound. You stop immediately, heart thumping.
 "Did you hear something Dear sister?" everything is dead quiet. You
 hold your breath.
 "Oh, No dear" your aunt says with a high-pitched giggle. "I believe
 that might have been me. You know about my little problems don't you
 dear? Now give me some more of that wonderful tea. Apple cinnamon is
 it?"
 You look around. This is not good.
 There's a sudden creak from the old chair in the other room and you
 freeze.

 You are Gideon. Four years old and an only child. Teddy is your best,

 In the other room, Mother seems to be talking about the postman.

>remember teddy


 What's that?

>about


 What's that?

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.
 You hear Mothers voice. To your horror, she is calling your name.
 "GIDEON? Are you behaving?" All you can manage is a frantic not of the
 head towards the hallway. You know that she expects no answer from
 you. "We will eat at four and your fingernails better not be dirty"

 You stare at your blackened nails and even though you know Mother
 can't see you, you quickly hide your hands behind your back. Finally,
 your mother turns to her sister in the other room and the chitchat
 starts again. Aunt Evelyn giggles. You would hate to know what was so
 terribly funny.

>yell yes

>yell

 That was a rhetorical question.

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

 Suddenly, Mother stands there. She keeps glancing at you as she goes
 to stir her soup, eyes cold and suspicious.

 Mother mutters something, puts the big wooden spoon away, and glances
 at you. After a moment, she is back drinking her tea in the other

 "oh dear. I hate to disturb your visits this way darling sister, but I

 dear?"
 You can hear Mother's heavy steps hurrying across the hallway floor.
 Fortunately, they disappear into the bathroom. The door closes, the
 lock clicks.

 You open the china cabinet.
 Aunt Evelyn slurps loudly.

>push table


 You put your tiny hands against the edge of the table and for a moment
 your courage falters. Then you shut your eyes hard and push. The table
 legs grind and studder against the floor and it moves. Grunting,
 straining, you manage to push the table against the big china cabinet,
 careful not to push it so far that it might break something.

 Strange noises emerge from behind the bathroom door. You try not to

 off dear sister. Go now and see to your wonderful soup. I've been
 smelling it from the kitchen all afternoon."
 Heavy steps over the floor, the front door opening and closing, Mother
 coming closer.... NO! You are not ready!

 Ok.

>go down


 You drop down on the table with a thud that is a bit too loud for
 comfort.
 Water is running in the bathroom. Surely, mother isn't done yet?

>open second drawer


 You grab the handle on the second drawer and pull on it. There is a
 grinding noise and you glance at the hallway. Very carefully, you open
 the drawer. In the second drawer are a meat tenderizer and a red
 kitchen towel.
 Aunt Evelyn slurps loudly.

>get towel


 Taken.
 Aunt Evelyn gets up from her chair. After a moment she sits back down
 with a sigh.
 There's a sound from the hallway but there is no one there.

>close second drawer


 Very slowly, you close the noisy drawer again.
 Mother checks the bathroom door just to be sure it's locked.

>go up


 You step on the shelf and climb back up.
 Aunt Evelyn gets up from her chair. After a moment she sits back down
 with a sigh.

>put towel on rags


 Putting things on the bundle of rags would achieve nothing.
 "Are you alright in there dear sister?" No answer from the bathroom.
 A rumbling seems to shake the floors and you stop breathing for a
 moment. Then the cloud rolls in over the floor towards you and now it
 is necessary to hold your breath.

 Your aunt Evelyn mutters something apologetic as you expect to either
 get sick or start to laugh uncontrollably. Luckily for you, the air
 clears and you get control of yourself.

>examine rags


 A bundle of rags that Mother uses when she polishes the furniture.
 That doesn't happen very often. They are brown and if squished
 together a bit, it could be mistaken for a certain little bear. As
 long as the look is quick and very cursory that is.
 "Are you alright in there dear sister?" No answer from the bathroom.
 The toilet flushes, the bathroom door opens, heavy steps over the
 hallway into the living room.
 "Sorry dear, now what were we talking about?"

>look



 <span class="floydstyle i">The Kitchen</span> (on the shelf)
 This is the kitchen. Here, you spend most of your time, mostly sitting
 quietly in the corner. There is a stove, a monster of a stove, in one
 corner. A giant pot of pea soup is puttering away on top of it. A
 solid wooden table takes pride of place in the middle of the kitchen,
 although it looks strange without the chairs. A huge cabinet with
 glass doors stands in the corner opposite to the dark corner. It's
 full of that yucky china that Mother seems to like so much. Above the
 cabinet, it is dark. Too dark for a poor Teddy.
 There is a lot of counter too, with two big drawers and a bread box.

 You can see a dark hole behind a loose board (which is empty) here.
 You've got to set everything straight before Mother comes.
 You hear your mother's voice.
 "Oh, dear me. I had better check on my soup soon. I'll just finish
 this cup of tea first."
 There's a sound from the hallway but there is no one there.

>examine cabinet


 The huge cabinet stands in the northwest corner of the kitchen. It is
 full of all the old ugly china that your mother won't let you touch,
 not that you would ever want to. You really don't see the point in
 those old ugly things anyway. The dusty glass doors are always locked
 and the top rises higher than the other cabinets in the kitchen.
 Your tummy is in a knot. You stare at the hallway again.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a red kitchen towel
   Teddy
     a T-shirt
   a fancy looking key
 You try to be silent, but it is so hard.

>examine towel


 One of mother's tea-towels is neatly folded in the drawer. You've used
 it plenty of times. The towel is bright red with white stripes.
 You grind your teeth. Time is running out.
 Suddenly, Mother stands there with an iron grip on the scruff of your
 neck.
 "STOP SQUIRMING! I believe I told you to behave. What do you do? You
 ungrateful beast! I believe you are sleeping in the cellar tonight.
 Without Teddy!"


     <span class="floydstyle i">*** Teddy was washed. He will never be the same again. ***</span>

 The high scary place is full of shadows. You can't reach that far. You

 Mother's voice weighs you down like a bag of sand. You grasp Teddy
 harder as you stare hypnotized at the huge finger stabbing the air not
 more than half an inch from your nose. You shrink back.
 "Behave now you damned little devil. You little beast! If I hear a
 single word from out here when I talk to your dear aunt, a single
 word...

 There is no need for her to finish as the tightness of her puffy lips
 and the steel in her eyes tells you all you need to know.

 Your enormous and absolutely terrifying mother stares intently at you
 for an excruciatingly long moment before she turns around. She stomps
 away towards the next room, and then she stops. Just when you think
 that she is going to move on, she turns and comes back. Your heart
 nearly escapes your body when she smiles.

 convinced now that your mother is an alien, or something unimaginably
 worse, you try to back away from her. There is no way out though. In
 one smooth move, she rips Teddy from your grasp and you can barely
 stop a shriek of horror as his warm fur looses contact with you. She
 starts to walk away again but changes her mind. She places Teddy on
 the counter, brings a chair over, steps up on the chair herself and
 places Teddy on top of the cabinet. It's the scary place, alldarkness,
 dust and eight-legged creatures. Without mercy, she shoves him into
 the corner up there. The dark corner.

 You look for Teddy up there in the scary place, longing for him.

 Mother brings the chair with her, grabs the second chair in passing
 the table, and carries them off with her. She doesn't give you another
 glance. After a few more moments, you can hear the clinking of cups
 and the creaking from living room furniture under strain.

 You look at the darkness where Teddy is, although all you see is a
 vague brown and red shape, and you know in your heart that Teddy is
 reaching for you. Teddy is afraid of high places, high and dark places
 in particular. Does she not know?

 You sit quietly in the corner. Singing a tuneless song under your
 breath, afraid of being heard.

 This is the kitchen. Here, you spend most of your time, mostly sitting

 There is a lot of counter too, with two big drawers and a bread box.

 You can see a dark hole behind a loose board (which is empty) here.

>examine counter


 You can do nothing from where you are.

>stand


 You get out of the corner.
 There's a sudden creak from the old chair in the other room and you
 freeze.

>examine counter


 The counter top runs along the east wall between the stove and the
 china cabinet. It is reasonably empty and very clean at the moment
 because Mother made you clean it just this morning. There's an old
 breadbox on the counter and two big drawers.

>open breadbox


 You open the bread box, revealing a crusty loaf of bread.
 In the other room, Mother seems to be talking about compost.

>move bread


 You gingerly push the loaf of bread until it flips over. That's where
 Mother hides the key for the cabinet. You quickly take the key.

>get key


 You already have that.
 There's a sudden creak from the old chair in the other room and you
 freeze.

 What's that?

 A bundle of rags that Mother uses when she polishes the furniture.

>squish rags together


 What's that?

>attach towel to rags


 You would achieve nothing by this.
 "Oh, my! Is that so?}
 You hear Mothers voice. To your horror, she is calling your name.
 "GIDEON? Are you behaving?" All you can manage is a frantic not of the
 head towards the hallway. You know that she expects no answer from
 you. "We will eat at four and your fingernails better not be dirty"

 You stare at your blackened nails and even though you know Mother
 can't see you, you quickly hide your hands behind your back. Finally,
 your mother turns to her sister in the other room and the chitchat
 starts again. Aunt Evelyn giggles. You would hate to know what was so
 terribly funny.
