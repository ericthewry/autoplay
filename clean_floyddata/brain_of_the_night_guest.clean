 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 It was supposed to be a carefree escape. Just you, your yacht, and a
 two-month supply of frozen pizza, chicken fingers, and beer. But it
 seems there was an uninvited guest: scurvy.

 A Scurvy of Wonders
 An Interactive Fiction by Rob Dubbin, Courtney Stanton, and Darius
 Kazemi
 Release 1 / Serial number 110313 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Yacht
 The immaculate fiberglass transom of your 45-foot yacht only
 highlights the hideous, scorbutic condition of your body. Fifty-eight
 days of nothing but carbohydrates, alcohol, and deep-fried poultry
 have come to this.

 You cannot speak, and you can barely move. You can only muster the
 strength to groan.

>groan
 You moan a wet-sounding sough.

 HOW TO PLAY: The options available to your scurvy-riddled brain and
 body are:

  appreciate
  eat
  examine
  give
  groan
  wait

 Typing "help" at any time will bring up this list again. It will not,
 however, restore your body's ability to synthesize collagen.
>appreciate life
 That isn't here, nor have you hallucinated it.

>appreciate me
 You're really more of an animal person.

>appreciate scurvy
 You're really more of an animal person.

 A chance look at the ocean reveals the corpulent outline of a
 surfacing manatee.

>appreciate yacht
 You're really more of an animal person.

>appreciate manatee
 As you ruminate on the merits of the manatee -- so noble! So gentle!
 -- your vision blurs and you feel your perspective shift.

 Grove
 The smell of citrus awakens long-dead senses, as a gentle breeze wafts
 through row after row of orange trees in fruit. The wind only somewhat
 irritates your inflamed gums, so that's an improvement.

 You can see some trees and a manatee farmer here.

>examine trees
 Festooned with life-giving citrus. Even one of them would save your
 life, but for one thing they are too far away and for another they are
 guarded by a possessive manatee farmer.

 "Boy howdy, I could stand to whet my whistle. Preferably with
 something alcoholic." The manatee farmer winks. "Got me one of them
 demandin' whistles."

>groan
 You grumble a heartrending wail.

 "Take yer grousin' somewhere else," says the manatee. "I've seen
 worse."

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a jacket (being worn)

>examine jacket
 You bought this jacket to symbolize your financial independence and
 freedom. Right now it's soaked with a heady combination of rum,
 breading, and old sweat.

 The manatee twitches its vibrissae. "Been a long day out here," it
 muses. "Could sure use a tall cold one."



 Before you can act, the smell of the ocean fills your nostrils and
 your vision shifts again as the hallucination expires.

 You cannot speak, and you can barely move. You can only muster the
 strength to groan.

 You can see a rat here.

>appreciate rat
 As you meditate on the merits of the rat -- so resourceful! So
 thrifty! -- your vision blurs and you feel your perspective shift.

 Money Cave
 The mountain of treasure piled before you shimmers with the casual
 indifference of unadulterated wealth. Torches burn in the wall
 sconces, contributing to the impression of an ill-gotten fortune.

 Sitting before his hoard in a gilded Aeron chair, whiskers twitching
 proudly, is a rat tycoon.

>examine treasure
 You see amethyst goblets, hillocks of gold doubloons, and what appears
 to be a life-sized jewel-encrusted chimpanzee.

 With studied indifference, the whiskered prince of business hefts a
 crystalline chalice. "Feh. About as much emotion in this object as
 there is in my multinational corporation's mission statement."

>examine chimpanzee
 Was it ever alive? And if so, isn't this better?

 "I would give it all up," the tycoon says, nervously worrying at his
 lapels, "for proof that love exists in this cynical,
 bottom-line-driven world."

 You cannot speak, and you can barely move. You can only muster the

>get beer
 You emit a piteous sob.

 With a loud caw, a seagull alights on the aft railing in front of you.

>appreciate seagull
 As you ruminate on the merits of the seagull -- so loud! So
 gregarious! -- your vision blurs and you feel your perspective shift.

 Tavern
 The candlelit taproom smells of liquor and cherry-wood. Dignified in
 her barkeep's apron, your seagull wife swabs the surface of the bar
 with a feathered wing.

 One look and you know she's a loving, caring wife who can carry her
 end of a conversation.

>appreciate wife
 This is not the 2010 film sensation Inception.

>examine seagull
 She grits her beak with frustrated determination, and worry-lines
 crinkle the downy spots around her eyes.

 Your seagull wife taps idly at the cash register with her beak. It
 springs open, empty.

>buy whiskey
 That isn't here, nor have you hallucinated it.

>kiss seagull
 Keep your mind on the game.

 The candlelit taproom smells of liquor and cherry-wood. Dignified in

 One look and you know she's a loving, caring wife who can carry her
 end of a conversation.

>give jacket
 (to the seagull)
 She eyes your jacket with skepticism. "That won't pay the bills," she
 caws. "Nothing will."

>talk to seagull
 You emit a piteous sob.

 Times may be hard, but you swore to love each other for richer or for
 poorer, and she is a gull of integrity.

 Taking flight over the bar with a single flap, she lands at your side
 and cradles your head under her wing. For minutes, you sit there
 together in silence. As she hops back, you feel the gentle poke of a
 wing feather caught in your captain's jacket.

>examine feather
 It smells uncannily like love. Well, love and seagull.

 "I just don't know," comes the frustrated coo. "What more can we do to
 attract customers?"

 The rat begins to sneer at the feather, but then pauses. He sniffs the
 air. "This... this feather smells like love. True love. Clearly it is
 a treasure to you." His eyes become greedy. "The feather must be
 mine."

 Turning around, he fishes in his treasure pile, pulls out a large bag
 of money, and tosses it into your lap. "Take this instead, buy
 yourself a new soulmate."

>examine bag
 The clinking of coins inside reminds you of your own money-pile back
 home.

>give bag

 At first, she can't believe it. Her beady eyes dilate, and her
 crown-feathers ruffle in surprise. "Is that... for us?" Defying
 biology, a tear rolls down her seagull cheek.

 As proudly as you can muster under the circumstances, you nod.

 "Let's celebrate!" She clutches two of the tavern's finest microbrews
 in one claw, and walks around the bar to your side. Handing you a
 bottle, she chirps in your ear: "Someone's getting lucky tonight."

>examine bottle
 Cisco Brewers' The Grey Lady, named for the often foggy island where
 it is brewed. This wheat beer is fermented with Belgian yeast and
 brewed with fresh fruit and spices. A unique ale that emits a complex,
 earthy nose and a soft, mid-palate maltiness with hints of tropical
 fruit. Dry and spicy.

 Your seagull wife taps idly at the cash register with her beak. It
 springs open, empty.

>give microbrew
 (to the manatee farmer)
 "Now we're talkin'!" The manatee positively leaps with excitement, to
 the extent that a manatee can leap.

 "S'pose it's only fair you get somethin' in return." Ponderously, the
 farmer stabs the nearest orange with its pitchfork, then tucks the
 fruit into your jacket.

>eat orange
 With just one bite, you feel life-giving Vitamin C begin to course
 through your veins. It won't be long before you're back on land,
 resuming your life as a wealthy yacht-owning layabout.

 The Braintree. The oldest enemy of your people, sitting there in the
 middle of the Neverlight Forest. Sitting...scheming. So now he put a
 giant space claw on Pluto, and Pluto powers your people, because you
 are some kind of sci-fi metaphor for hippies and back to nature
 -stuff. So the Eldest of your people send you and Kevin on a mission
 to find the Tomb of the Unknown Tool, also known as Grave of the
 nameless Idiot. There you will find the artifact to defeat the evil
 Braintree. So there you are, at the edge of the Forest, ready to begin
 your trip. I will be your eyes and ears. And nose.

 Bored Ladders
 An Interactive Fiction by Taleslinger
 Release 1 / Serial number 110313 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

  No relation to any real people called Kevin or Jim is implied.

 Edge of Forest
 The forest is dark and foreboding, yadda, yadda, forest path.

 You can see Jim here.

>smell
 Yeah, I said I'll be your nose, but you caught a cold.

>examine jim
 Jim is wearing something made of 100% natural cotton, because your
 people are into nature and stuff.

>inventory

 As good-looking as ever.

 Jim gives you a satisfying answer.

 "Shouldn't we follow the Forest Path? What do you mean not
 implemented? It's just here, to the northnortheast."
 Jim goes to the Northnortheast.
 You follow Jim to the Northnortheast.
 The forest path looks pretty normal...Oh dear!
  Vacuum Trap!!!
  Jim explodes in the goriest way you can imagine (so it might be
 pretty tame).

 Vacuum Trap!!!
 There's nothing here to see, as vacuum is invisible. Luckily, you're
 immune to vacuum, as all creatonists are. The forest path continues to
 the east.

>go east

 Tomb of the Unknown Tool, also known as Grave of the nameless Idiot
 It is done up in a modern style, all glass and steel, the lettering of
 its name float over the glass front as flashy laser projections. The
 entrance leads down (by elevator).

>go down
 Nice elevator music!

 Chicken Room
 This room is full of skulls and bones. Right before you lies the slain
 corpse of the famous adventurer Monathan Mlask, who has met his doom
 here. A door leads, hm, let's say southeast.

 You can see a bubble gum door and a Chicken with Hands! here.

 loud explosion. You drift through Space as helpless as the next sequel
 hook. But with Pluto's power restored, your people are able to find
 you, sailing to your rescue on Space Birds. Back home, they're having
 a big celebration in your honor, and you finally muster up your
 courage to speak to the silk weavers daughter. Braintree is still at
 large, but it's not like he can run away.

 After dreams of swedish fish fountains and 5-cent space otter rides,
 you find yourself unwillingly dragged back into consciousness. You
 open your eyes slowly to the sight of a completely bare ceiling. Your
 thoughts swim aimlessly in your head, trying to figure out what was
 happening before you passed out.

 "Hi there!" a chipper voice says. You raise your head and see the
 flashing light-eyes of a maintenance bot. "Seems like you were
 unconscious in the bathroom! I moved you here."

 Oh yeah. You had been on a field trip with your class to the Plutonian
 Commonwealth museum, learning about ancient technology and the history
 of the braintree and lots of educational stuff. As always, you find
 things way more educational when combined with the results of your
 pharmaceutical class, so you got totally fruitbat flapjacks on
 yesterday's lesson. You guess it must have been too much for you and
 you passed out.

 "Sorry, but the museum's already closed and your tour group has gone.
 Since you're not supposed to be here, we'll have to have the security
 guy take you to the police in the morning. In the meantime, I'm off
 duty, so -" the light-eyes of the maintenance bot die out as it goes
 into sleep mode.

 Dang. You've taken so many liberties in pharmaceutical class, you'd
 have a ton of paperwork to do if the police end up taking you out of
 here. You're going to have to find an exit on your own.

 Maintenance Room
 You are in a sparse, small room with no decoration whatsoever. It
 stinks of garbage, metal and oil.  From here, you can go north into
 the main museum hall, west into a nasty little break room, and east
 down a smelly hallway.

 A pile of fat black garbage bags take up most of the room.

 Nearby, a maintenance bot squats, inactive and shut off.

 You can also see a reminder note here.

>examine bags
 Large black garbage bags, filled with stuff you don't want to think
 about.

>examine bot
 A squat robot on treads. Its cylindrical body contains all of the
 tools and appendages it probably uses to keep up the place, but
 they're all retracted right now. Its eye-lights are currently dark.

>examine note
 The note reads, "Please remember: to maintain optimum stamina, the
 braintree must be fed nightly. Deposit protein slurry directly into
 its planter. DO NOT GIVE JUNK FOOD to the braintree; it will be up all
 night."

>examine self
 You are Alex.
  You are a kind of lazy student and you have a penchant for bringing

 stinks of garbage, metal and oil.  From here, you can go north into
 the main museum hall, west into a nasty little break room, and east
 down a smelly hallway.

 A pile of fat black garbage bags take up most of the room.

 Nearby, a maintenance bot squats, inactive and shut off.

 You can also see a reminder note here.

>take note
 Taken.

>go west

 Break Room
 This is a break room, you guess? It lacks a kitchenette of any kind,
 with no counters, no sinks and no cupboards. The large refrigerator in
 the corner looks lonely, its surface bare of adornment. With a
 complete lack of tables or chairs, it seems less and less credible
 that any people work here.

>examine refrigerator
 A large refrigerator, alone and unloved. Its surface is bare.

 You open the refrigerator, revealing Jim's brain and some half-eaten
 chicken fingers.

>examine brain
 Someone has written "Jim" on this brain in black sharpie.

>examine fingers
 Some gross fried chicken fingers, covered in congealed grease. Who
 refrigerates fried food? And why did people think it was a good idea
 to start growing chickens with fingers?

>get all
 Jim's brain: Taken.
 half-eaten chicken fingers: Taken.

>close fridge
 You close the refrigerator.

>eat brain
 That's plainly inedible.

>bot, w
 The maintenance bot has better things to do.

>search bags
 You check through the garbage bags briefly.  It's a pretty gross
 experience.

 In one of the bags, you find a discarded brain in a plastic bag.  You
 pull the brain out for a better look and stuff the plastic bag back
 into the garbage.

 Plutonian Commonwealth Museum, Grand Hall
 Of all of the halls, this is the grandest. It even has a sweeping
 staircase going up to a balcony type thing that overlooks where you're
 standing. This room was created exclusively to house the magnificent
 braintree, which is in the center of the room. The maintenance room
 where you woke up is to the south, and an unobtrusive door with an
 excessively obtrusive padlock on it is to the east.

 There's a placard above the padlocked door to the east.

 You can also see a planter (in which is a magnificent braintree), a
 brain tank (empty), a transfer chair, a transfer pedestal, a display
 note and a warning sign here.

 It's a spartan but relatively comfortable chair. You sit in it to have
 your brain switched around. Sitting in it before you put a brain on
 the pedestal will leave you pretty out of it until somebody comes to

 The braintree hunches over slightly, noticing that there is something
 in its planter. When it realizes that a perfectly good nugget of
 protein, fat and salt is within devouring range, it quickly pulls the
 chicken fingers under the soil. It makes a sort of "nom nom nom" sound
 as it eats, and within moments the braintree is looking much more
 magnificent.

 You're now a maintenance guy. You tell the maintenance robots to do

 Without the Braintree, the basic human right of taking your brain out

 works is that you put a brain on that pedestal over there and then you
 sit in the chair on the other side. In that order. Doing it in that

 Maintenance Room
 You are in a sparse, small room with no decoration whatsoever. It
 stinks of garbage, metal and oil.  From here, you can go north into
 the main museum hall, west into a nasty little break room, and east
 down a smelly hallway.

 A pile of fat black garbage bags take up most of the room.

 There is nothing special about this corridor, except for the fire door

>hit panel with hammer
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the control panel.

>hammer panel
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>hit panel
 You wind up and smack the control panel with the hammer.  The hammer
 bounces off, rather to your surprise.  You try a couple more times,
 but you get the feeling real fast that you're not very good at this.

>go north

 Plutonian Commonwealth Museum, Grand Hall
 Of all of the halls, this is the grandest. It even has a sweeping
 staircase going up to a balcony type thing that overlooks where you're
 standing. This room was created exclusively to house the magnificent
 braintree, which is in the center of the room. The maintenance room
 where you woke up is to the south, and an unobtrusive door with an
 excessively obtrusive padlock on it is to the east.

 There's a placard above the padlocked door to the east.

 You can also see a planter (in which is a magnificent braintree), a
 brain tank (in which are Marlene's brain and Kevin's brain), a
 transfer chair, a transfer pedestal (on which is Jim's brain), a
 display note and a warning sign here.

>sit
 (on Alex's brain)
 That's not something you can sit down on.

 The magnificent braintree suddenly screams, "Moose-squirrels!"  There
 is no response.

>sit on chair
 With a click and a woosh, the braintree vacuums up your brain and
 replaces it with Jim's brain.  You feel very odd as you stand up.

 You're now a maintenance guy. You tell the maintenance robots to do
 maintenance stuff. There are a lot of subroutines and routines and
 things so you don't really know much of what that is. You do know that
 if you hit the fire door's control panel real hard, it unlocks.

 Drawing on long experience, you whack the control panel precisely with
 the hammer.  There's a muted WHAM!, like a muffled explosion, and a
 gorgeous shower of sparks.  You might worry about it if you hadn't
 seen it happen some twenty-odd times before (though the last time, you
 had to hit it with a giant chunk of topaz from over in Rocks and
 Minerals, and wasn't that a caution....)

 Oh, and the door's unlocked now.

>take alex
 Taken.

>put alex on pedestal
 You put Alex's brain on the transfer pedestal.

>sit on chair
 With a click and a woosh, the braintree vacuums up your brain and

 And field trips.

>go east
 You walk out into the warm Plutonian night. You feel exhausted; having
 to solve your own problems and take responsibility for your mistakes
 is really hard. You make a mental note to avoid doing so for the
 forseeable future.

 You do feel like you owe yourself a bit of self-congratulation for the
 work you did today, though. Usually the degree of truancy, vandalism,
 and lack of respect for history that you've shown takes several
 students working in tandem. Seems like there are some ways in which
 you really can be an overachiever.

 Now all you have to do is figure out a way to get home...

 Diner
 You have always enjoyed this diner before, but now it just feels
 forced.  Tacky attempts at some sort of art deco diner atmosphere
 crowd all around you.  Nothing feels right.  Jim sits across the from
 table from you, silent but supportive.  A listless rain pours on
 outside.

 You can see a table (on which is a plate of chicken fingers) here.

 Jim glances carefully at you from over his plate of chicken fingers.
 It reminds you briefly of the time before your futile mission to
 locate something better in life.  A fleeting mission you intend to
 abandon, no less, but that's just like you.  Jim still hasn't given up
 on you.

>examine jim
 His mussed hair has fallen over his eyes.  Now you've probably gone
 and gotten him downcast, too.  From time-to-time, he glances at you
 half-expectantly.

 Like a good, patient friend, he's waiting for you to talk to him.

 Kevin Masters, only you feel least of all a master at the moment, and
 more like a slave to a fate... ennui... and your own self-loathing.

>talk to jim
 "I've decided," you tell Jim.  "I've really made up my mind this time.
 There's nothing else for it."

 "But decided what, Kev?  I... I wish I could understand what you've
 been going through.  It's like you've been on Pluto for the past few
 months.  I just want to help."  He sweeps his hair away briefly and
 folds his hands thoughtfully, semi-pleadingly.  "Is it Marilyn?"

 "Maybe they should just bury me now," you say.  "We could mark it The
 Tomb of the Unknown Tool."

 "One of those already exists, you know," Jim informs you, but it
 sounds no less pithy to you.

>talk to jim
 You struggle to form words decent enough to express your troubles.
 "I've just been having these... explosions in the vacuum of my
 braintree."

 "Explosions?"

 "Ripples... tiny, crackling shocks.  An inevitable rot.  Can't be
 fixed."

 "It is Marilyn, isn't it?  Has she... done something?"  You cannot
 answer.  Words lapse again into silence.

>talk to jim
 You sigh.  "No, it doesn't matter.  I've made up my mind.  Get me to

 You chew on the tasteless, overly chewy substance.  The breading feels
 stale on the roof of your mouth.  When you swallow, it sits
 uncomfortably-- anxiously, even-- in the pit of your stomach.  There

 The shaking stops after three or four tense minutes. This piece of

 Digging Time!
 by Rob Wheeler
 Release 1 / Serial number 110312 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S

 Pluto - Deep Mine
 Twisting, crystalline passages carved out of pink ice and muddy rock
 lead down deep into the planetoid core. Tremors pulsate through your
 feet, up your spine, and shifting rock and newly-ground sand tumble
 from overhead cracks, drifting slowly downward in the near-zero
 gravity.

 Your tracking sensor pings.

>jim, he's dead
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   an alien digging tool
   your tracking sensor
   your atmos suit (being worn)

>examine sensor
 Thirty meters to the artificial north is the signal emitter. It is
 completely stationary, so Jim or Kevin either left it behind or are
 themselves immobilized.

 Your tracking sensor pings.

>examine tool
 This was the first artifact that you came across that let you know you
 were on the right trail to find the missing dig crew. Of alien origin,
 it doesn't resemble an earthbound digging tool such as a bladed
 shovel.

 This looks more like a corkscrew attached to a five-pronged handle
 with some kind of stabilizer gyroscope stuck on the end. I suppose
 that helps you dig "down" in a near-null-gravity planetoid core, which
 is where you happen to find yourself.

>examine suit
 The suit is what keeps your feet more or less on the ground, and the
 air in your lungs. You have about nine hours of fresh oxygen and about
 two days worth of recycled air before respiration ceases.

 Your tracking sensor pings.

>go north
 It's slow going to half-float, half-scrape yourself along a tunnel
 that wasn't really made for someone your size. Your suit also seems to
 be chugging and wheezing trying to calibrate, not sure whether the
 temperature is freezing cold or becoming unbearably hot.

 Insulation protects you from the worst of this, but you can feel a
 cold sweat trickling down your back.

 Abruptly, the tunnel dead ends, two meters from the signal emitter, at
 a solid wall.

 Pluto - Deep Mine - Tunnel end
 The mining tunnel dead ends here, two meters south of the signal
 emitter, at a solid rock wall.

>examine wall
 The mining tunnel dead ends at a solid rock wall.

 Your tracking sensor pings.

>dig n
 (the solid rock wall)
 It crumbles as you touch it, sending debris tumbling in slow motion
 down to the ground, which at least holds your weight, as negligible as
 your weight is right now.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>score
 You have so far scored 1 out of a possible 10, in 7 turns.

>look

 Pluto - Deep Mine - Tunnel end
 The mining tunnel dead ends here, two meters south of the signal
 emitter, at a solid rock wall.

 Your tracking sensor pings.

>go north
 As you squeeze through, you dislodge enough loose sand and dirt to
 cause a small rockslide that seals the passage as soon as you pull
 your legs through.

 Pluto - Deep Mine - Vent Chamber
 A small chamber, round and compact like a bathysphere. Overhead, the
 ceiling is riddled with vent holes in a swiss cheese pattern. Below, a
 corkscrew hole winds down like a helter skelter slide, obscuring your
 view of how far down it goes. A red, wet heat steams up out of it,
 blurring your faceplate.

 Lying dead next to the hole is Jim Alewife. There's no sign of Kevin.

 You can also see a signal emitter here.

>examine emitter
 The blue button on the signal emitter is lit.

 Your tracking sensor pings.

>press button
 You push the blue button. Click.

 The light goes out in the emitter. Seconds later, there's a crackle
 over your commlink. "Mendoza, the emitter just stopped sending its
 signal. What is your status? Did you find them?"

 "I found one of them. Jim's dead. Looks like he died waiting for Kevin
 to return from exploring a coreward tunnel."

 There's a loud crackle about one second before a huge tremor nearly
 splits the chamber you're standing into two pieces. The hole you
 squeezed through is buried under more rocks than you'll be able to
 easily push out of the way, and a gout of steam spits and hisses out
 of the corkscrew hole.

 "The way out just got lost. I'm going deeper," you report. There's
 only radio silence. You're on your own.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>examine jim
 You have to wipe at his faceplate to make out his features, which show
 parched lips and a lolling tongue. Perhaps he died of dehydration,
 waiting for someone to return who never did. Going down the hole would
 probably be an extremely risky move at this point.

>examine hole
 A corkscrew hole winds down into the planetoid core.

>search jim
 You find nothing of interest.

>take jim
 I don't suppose Jim Alewife would care for that.

>wake jim
 He's dead.

>search jim
 You find nothing of interest.

>take emitter
 You already have that.

>SAVE
>cf5
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go down
 You put your feet over the edge of the corkscrew hole and listen to
 yourself breathing heavily. Your heart thumping, you find some kind of
 stupid courage somewhere in yourself, and push off, taking the ride
 wherever it goes.

 The corkscrew slide seems to draw you downward with magnetic power. It
 can't be gravity -- gravity should be getting less and less
 accelerative the closer you go to planetoid core, but within seconds
 you're twisting fast enough to become dizzy. Your hands uselessly try
 to grab hold, but there's not enough friction. Or too much -- your
 hands feel like they're burning through your gloves before you can
 tell there's any slowing of your momentum at all.

 You feel your vision collapsing to a pinpoint, and everything is about
 to go black, when suddenly everything bursts wide open and bright as
 day.

 Pluto - Central Core - Brain Tree
 You are tumbling and spinning in an effective zero gravity
 environment, in a place big enough to fit two or three mining ships
 end to end. Giant, ancient crystals grow in funguslike clusters around
 the spheric volume, spiking up toward the center, looking every bit
 like the inside of a geode.

 Asymmetrically, a single great fossilized tree trunk grows from the
 far side of the cavernous space from you, with branches that twist and
 curl and spread and go straight and turn back again -- some kind of
 null gravity growth that you've never seen in an earthbound tree,
 which has to contend with gravity and atmosphere and winds. Here in a
 vacuum, other rules of growth seem to apply.

 While it was alive, that is. It does look fossilized. It doesn't,
 however, look dead.

>examine tree
 Sitting in the center of the trunk, embedded within it, with the
 fibers of the tree attached to his head so that the tree seems to be
 plugged into his brain stem, is Kevin. His eyes are closed, his
 expression blank.

>examine kevin
 His eyes open. A line of silver pulsates out from his head, threading
 through the tree branches, flowing through capillaries. At the ends, a
 bright glow, a sense of drawing you closer.

 Within moments, you are face to face with the face in the tree.

 "This planet is dying," croaks a reedy voice. "It will break apart
 soon, freeing me to enter the void. You will have to help this happen,
 and then flee."

 "What do I have to do?" you say.

 "You have to dig."

 "Dig?"

 "Dig."

>examine crystals
 You can't see any such thing.

>dig
 (the brain tree)
 Digging time! You float down to the base of the tree and start
 digging, at first with your hands. A minute of this and your hands
 fall upon some sort of hard thing buried in the rocky soil.

 After dusting it off and shaking it, what at first felt like a metal
 box cleans off to reveal an ancient typewriter. An Under-Wood, of
 course.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>examine typewriter
 The typewriter is a heavy contraption, but looks in good shape for
 typing.

 A large, papery leaf breaks off the upper branches of the tree and
 floats within reach of you.

>get leaf
 Taken.

>take leaf
 You already have that.

>read it
 A large, papery leaf. It's blank.

>put leaf in typewriter
 You crank the leaf into the typewriter. As soon as you touch the keys
 of the typewriter, it begins to automatically clack out text. With a
 crank and a zip, the paper leaf pops out into your hands, covered in
 writing.

>read it
 The text of the paper reads:

     "The shaking stops after three or four tense
       minutes. This piece of rock isn't going to
       hold together much longer..."

 A sense of disorientation and dislocation spins your head around, and
 a headache like a piercing dagger cuts into your brain. As you look
 up, there is an explosion of light, followed by an explosion of
 darkness, as everything solid breaks apart and flies into the vacuum
 of space.

 A great glowing silver tree floats in the void, seeming to suck all of
 the light and heat there is into itself to glow brighter.  The tree
 begins to move, its branches turning into arms, its balled-up roots
 turning into things like fins. You are grabbed, you are enveloped, you
 are propelled in one direction and the tree in another.

 Void
 The sun is a distant point of light, recognizably the nearest star,
 but impossibly small and cold. You are alone.

>push button
 You push the blue button, click. The light flashes and then glows
 steadily. As long as you don't drop it...

 You have an hour to contemplate the silence and cold and the void, and
 the potential running out of oxygen, freezing to death here at the
 edges of the solar system. And then, a sparkle, a glint of weak
 sunlight reflecting off metal, angling off of solar panels.

 Your ship picks you up an hour later.

 The end.

 Your Office
 This is the graduate student office you share with Jim and Molly. Like
 pretty much every graduate student office, tiny (way too small for
 three people to share), windowless, and littered with some random shit
 -- a shelf of books, a typewriter, a vacuum.

 The exit is to the north.

 You can see Jim and Molly here.

>examine books
 Performativity in the Beta-Male Gaze; Food, Longing, and Intertextual
 Meta-Narrative in Ancient Greece; Heteronormativity and You. You know,
 the usual grad student fare.

>examine typewriter
 This is Molly's. It's so old, it's not even electric. She likes to
 write drafts on it instead of on her computer, which you think is
 adorable.

 She mentioned once that the typewriter belonged to her
 great-grandfather in Ireland, a hundred years ago or so -- he was some
 sort of revolutionary poet. Super romantic, you think.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine jim
 You have known Jim since he first hazed you in college, and for some
 reason, you've been hanging out with him ever since -- following him
 around like you're his fucking shadow -- despite the fact that he
 consistently makes you feel like shit about yourself. It's not like
 he's even that fun, either.

 Yet here you are, not only in the same graduate program, but sharing
 an office. Which means you have to look at his stupid fucking face
 every time you come here to get some work done (or, more
 realistically, to pretend you're getting work done while really you're
 angsting about how you haven't even started your dissertation).

>fuck
 Real adventurers do not use such language.

>examine me
 You are Kevin, graduate student extraordinaire.

 Okay, not really extraordinaire.... at being a graduate student, or at
 anything else.

>examine molly
 Molly Malone is the most beautiful creature in the world -- red-gold
 curls tumbling around her pale, freckled face; thousand-watt green
 eyes; an endearingly gap-toothed smile; and sharp as a whip, too.
 (She's a year ahead of you in school, but more like two or three years
 ahead if you measure it in dissertation progress. Not that you've...
 well, started.)

 Unfortunately for you, Jim thinks she's the most beautiful creature in
 the world, too. And if there's one thing that's bugged you more than
 anything else about your friendship with Jim -- such as it is -- it's
 his habit of seducing the women you like before you can get out so
 much as a garbled "Hello".

>examine vacuum
 Why is there a vacuum in your tiny office in your department building?
 Who knows. People leave all kinds of stuff in these offices, then get
 re-assigned to new offices and forget about it.

 "Hey, I'm getting hungry. Jim, Kevin, either of you want to go pick up
 something to eat?" Molly says.

 "I --" you say faintly, but Jim cuts you off.

 "I'll go! Just call me... Helpfulman," he says. Helpfulman? How
 stupid, you think, and turn to Molly to share a laugh; but you stifle
 your snort when you see a genuine smile on her face.

 "That's really sweet of you, Jim! Thanks, Helpfulman!"

 Jim runs out, shit-eating grin on his face. You scowl. Helpfulman.
 What a douche.

 You're always tongue-tied around her, and what you want to say just
 comes out a stupid-sounding blurt.

 Courtyard
 A round courtyard, paved with large, flat flagstones. It's suprisingly

 what looks like the remains of an illegal campfire set by some

 There is a fountain in the center of the courtyard.

>go north
 To get into the dorm you need an undergrad escort, and you prefer not
 to talk to them; by comparison they make you feel old, ugly, hopeless.

 Even worse, some of them are your students, and they have things to
 say to you like "Kevin, why haven't you graded my paper yet?" or "Hey,
 dude, how come I got an A- on this paper? I thought it was good?" or
 "Carl" -- they don't always remember your name -- "Carl, I need an
 extension on my paper because I was up all night making out with my
 boyfriend and didn't write it yet" or "Hey, you, what's your name,
 aren't you my TA? Do you know when our paper is due?"

 peaceful here; at this hour, it's lit by starlight, moonlight, and
 what looks like the remains of an illegal campfire set by some
 undergrads from the dorms to the north.

 There is a fountain in the center of the courtyard.

 A passage leads downward.

>examine fountain
 A round, concrete fountain, full of water; more water spews from the
 mouth of a grotesque concrete realization of the university mascot.
 Super tacky.

 In the fountain is an alewife.

   a length of string (with both ends free)

 You knot the length of string onto the pencil.

 Your Office
 This is the graduate student office you share with Jim and Molly. Like
 pretty much every graduate student office, tiny (way too small for
 three people to share), windowless, and littered with some random shit
 -- a shelf of books, a typewriter, a vacuum.

 The exit is to the north.

 You can see Molly here.

 Jim rushes back in, holding a styrofoam container of gross-looking
 chicken fingers. "Hey, Molly!" he says breathlessly. "I got you some
 dinner!"

 Molly looks up. "Oh, Jim, that's really nice of you! Um, but I should
 have said, I'm allergic to chicken. I can't eat that."

 You're not pleased with yourself for the smug smile of satisfaction
 that creeps onto your face as you see Jim turn suddenly glum. But you
 are pleased. The douche had it coming. Helpfulman.

 "Um, I'll get you something else!" he says, rushing away, and dropping
 one of the chicken fingers to the ground as he goes.

>put finger in fountain
 You put the chicken finger into the fountain.

>examine pencil
 A #2 pencil, suitable for taking standardized tests. Fortunately you
 finished your last one of those with the GRE. Thank God that's over.

 The pencil is currently tied to the chicken finger and the length of
 string.

 You try to grab it with your hands, but it flops and flips away.

>take alewife with finger
 You dangle the finger over the fish with the pencil. Closer...
 closer...

 The fish bites! You pull it up gently, and detach it from its bait. It
 flops in your hand.

 You caught a fish! You, Kevin, caught your own fish.

 Man, this is great.

>SAVE
>cf6
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>kill fish
 You smash the fish against the flagstones until it stops wriggling.

 Take that, fish! And that! And that!

 You realize that now you're beating a dead fish. Nice going, Kevin.

>cook fish
 You hold the dead fish over the glowing embers, and soon it gives off
 a delicious roasted aroma.

>give fish to molly
 Molly takes the cooked fish from you, and looks at you.

 "Kevin, this is so sweet! I love fish!" She gives you a beautiful
 gap-toothed smile; then eats the fish, nibbling daintily with her
 wonderful mouth.

 Suddenly you feel courage rushing into you. "Molly... would you like
 to get dinner with me sometime?"

 "Oh, honey..." Molly fixes her green eyes on you. "I'm seeing someone.
 I thought you knew!"

 For a moment you think that your heart is ready to break into a
 million little pieces. But then, surprisingly, it doesn't. You
 swallow, and smile at Molly. "Okay! That's fine. I just thought I'd
 ask."

 "I hope you enjoyed the fish!" You smile as you walk out the door.

 You caught your own fish. You cooked it. You asked Molly out.

 As you walk out into the courtyard, you look up at the sky. Bright,
 full moon; constellations of stars; planets. And things like Pluto,
 that aren't really planets -- more like shadows of planets.

 Pluto was always your favorite, anyway. The underdog planet.

 When you get home, you're going to start writing your dissertation.
 You have a feeling you're going to have plenty of ideas tonight.

 The Tool has been buried.  The monument has been erected.  It's taken

 an ancient tool) but here you are, the day before the great Unveiling

 Thing is, it's taken so long to get approval and to work out the

 Beside The Tomb
 You are standing on the top of the hill of the Festeron graveyard,
 beside the newly-made marble tomb.  The gates are back to the south.

 The branches of a massive, dead tree stretch overhead.

 You can also see Kevin and Jim here.

>examine me

 Graveyard Gates
 The gates of the graveyard are appropriately spooky and twisted.  It
 takes a lot of care and money to keep them that way.  A rocky path
 winds back up the hill to the north.

 You can see Morty here.

 Morty, the Head Undertaker.  Or something.  You've met him at various
 graveyards and hospitals, but it's never entirely clear what he does.

 "Oh, him.  That's really Pluto, lord of the Underworld.  Not a myth.
 Show him this, and you'll see."  Jim pulls a pomegranate out of a
 pocket and tosses it to you.

>climb tree

>ask jim about tree
 Jim nods to the tree stretching overhead.  "Yeah, that's a braintree.
 They plant them in graveyards for the zombie uprisings.  They're
 supposedly carnivorous, and give you knowledge in exchange for food.
 But that's just a myth."

 It's a red "apple grenade" (well, that's what a pomegranate is in
 French) from Sargent Farms.

 You can see Morty here.

>show pomegranate to morty
 Morty's face undergoes a dramatic change when he sees the pomegranate.
 "Ah," he says, in a voice like arsenic-laced chocolate, "I see you've

 in a cloud of sulphur.  A moment later, you hear the ominous clucking
 of a zombie chicken pecking around where Morty/Pluto used to be.

 Kevin, listening in, suddenly snaps his fingers.  "That's it!  We'll
 just get rid of the tomb!  We can blow it up with this huge pile of C4
 that I just happen to be carrying around with me!"  And sure enough, a
 moment later, the pair of them are packing explosives into and onto
 and around the tomb (Which, I might remind you, took a hundred years
 just to get approved) in order to blow it into oblivion.

 This seems like a rather bad idea, now you think about it.

 The branches of a massive, dead tree stretch overhead.

 You can also see Kevin and Jim here.

>give fingers to tree
 Not quite knowing how this works, you lay the chicken fingers on the
 ground at the roots of the tree.  A moment later, roots snake out of
 the ground and drag the chicken fingers (the horror! the horror!)
 under the ground.  The branches overhead wave spookily and lean in
 towards you.

 "A typewriter.  The unknown tool is a typewriter."

 You run back around the tomb to where Jim and Kevin are just about to
 push the button on the detonator.  "A typewriter!" you shout, "the
 unknown tool is a 100-year-old typewriter!"

 And that's that.  Kevin's a bit disappointed at not having been able
 to make something go BOOM, but the tomb is saved, and the unknown tool
 is now known.  Tomorrow, the Monument to the 100-year-old Typewriter
 will be unveiled, and all will be well.

 The future's not what it's cracked up to be! Jetpacks and joybooths
 are cool and all, but you've always had a special place in your heart
 for history and its artefacts- so much that it was long ago that you
 decided you wanted to be a roguish space pirate (way before it was
 considered cool, in fact).

 Among the many who had heard the tale of a fabled lost museum devoted
 to interactive fiction, you alone thought the myth was rooted in
 truth. Perseverence paid off, though, and by golly, you found it.
 Tragicly, you lost your cohorts Jim and Kevin to an ill-considered
 mining expedition to Pluto, so you are embarking on this adventure
 alone. You have already ransacked the other wings of the museum. The
 one thing left to do is to crack the...

 Vault of Hugo II: Electric Boogaloo
 An Interactive Scavenging by Roody Yogurt
 Hugo v3.1 / Library 31031

 The Hugo Wing
   This place is pretty amazing. Of course, your attention is mainly
 drawn to the north, where the big Hugo Vault Door keep you from its
 treasures. Also somewhat neat is the desk near it. You came from the
 east, but there was a cave-in just moments ago, trapping you. Luckily,
 there seems to be a room past a tight squeeze to the southwest.

>go east
 The way back to the ALAN Wing has been blocked by a cave-in. Those
 plaques written in Comic Sans are inaccessible to you for now.

>examine vault
 This thing is the real deal. There's no way you're getting this bad
 boy open without some serious firepower.

>examine desk
 This is quite a sturdy work desk. On top of it is a typewriter, and
 behind the typewriter is an output tray for sheets of paper to fall
 into.

 The desk has the 100 year old awesomatic-typewriter and an output tray
 on it.

>look in tray
 The output tray is empty.

>examine typewriter
 Unbelievable! Everybody remembers the "automatypewriter" that predates
 this one, but not many remember the Awesomatic-Typewriter that came
 much later, playing only Hugo games. This one seems to be in the
 middle of a game of "Quest For Museum" and is currently waiting for a
 command. If you feel up to the challenge, TYPE "COMMAND" ON
 TYPEWRITER.

>type i on typewriter
 That doesn't make any sense.

>go southwest
 You'd never make that squeeze while carrying anything!

>inventory
 You are carrying a landmine.

>examine landmine
 The only thing you have left- after using all of your good ordnance
 raiding this museum- is your trusty landmine. With its hair-trigger
 mechanism, it'll explode at a moment's notice. It may not be the
 safest kind of landmine to carry around on one's person, but hey, they
 are among the cheapest! It is roughly 8 by 10 inches in length and
 fires powerful shrapnel in all directions.

 You don't need to use the word "squeeze".

 You put the landmine in the output tray.

 It's a tight fit, but you make it, finding yourself in...

 The Tomb of the Unknown Tool
   What a weird place. Some graffiti lines the concrete walls, but the
 real star of the room is the little creepy coffin at its center. Also,
 did I mention that the floor is dusty?

>examine floor
 What a horribly dirty floor! Where's the abandoned museum cleaning
 staff?

>clean floor
 You have nothing to vacuum with!

>examine coffin
 Creepy! Little! Coffin! It is closed.

>read graffiti
 You can't do that with graffiti.

>examine graffiti
 It reads, "Don't you hate spelling 'graffiti' right in IF games???"

>open coffin
 Scary stuff! With great trepidation, you slowly open up the coffin's
 lid. Shockingly enough, the contents are revealed to be a hand vacuum
 (a dustbuster, ya know?). Somebody here had a sense of humor.

>examine grafitti
 You don't need to use the word "grafitti".

>take vacuum
 Taken.

>vacuum dust
 In a fit of dustbusting fever, you attack the dusty floor with the
 dustbuster. Your efforts are rewarded by revealing a trapdoor. Huzzah!

>open trapdoor
 Opened.

 Inside the trapdoor is a game walkthrough.

>take walkthrough
 Taken.

>read it
 (assuming you mean the game walkthrough)
 Somebody hid away this walkthrough for the game "Quest For Museum."
 There are lots of little comments making snide remarks about the game
 at any point results in the biggest infodump in the game.

 The Hugo Wing
   This place is pretty amazing. Of course, your attention is mainly
 drawn to the north, where the big Hugo Vault Door keep you from its
 treasures. Also somewhat neat is the desk near it. You came from the
 east, but there was a cave-in just moments ago, trapping you. Luckily,
 there seems to be a room past a tight squeeze to the southwest.

>take landmine
 Taken.

>type "scrape parrot" on typewriter
 The awesomatic-typewriter springs to life, printing a giant screed
 filled with the author's views on politics, religion, and his
 complicated relationship with his mother. In fact, it still is
 printing!

>examine typewriter
 Unbelievable! Everybody remembers the "automatypewriter" that predates
 this one, but not many remember the Awesomatic-Typewriter that came
 much later, playing only Hugo games. This one seems to be in the
 middle of a game of "Quest For Museum" and is currently waiting for a
 command. If you feel up to the challenge, TYPE "COMMAND" ON
 TYPEWRITER.

 The page finishes printing and falls into the output tray without much
 fanfare. Uninterested with the result, you instantly throw the paper
 away- NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.

>put landmine in tray
 You put the landmine in the output tray.

>type "scrape parrot" on typewriter
 You'll have to load the typewriter up with some paper first.

>load typewriter
 You grab a blank sheet of paper and load it up into the typewriter. It
 automatically prints a line of text and waits with a new prompt.

 happiness and success and more effective roguishness!

 The future's not what it's cracked up to be! Jetpacks and joybooths
 are cool and all, but you've always had a special place in your heart
 for history and its artefacts- so much that it was long ago that you
 decided you wanted to be a roguish space pirate (way before it was
 considered cool, in fact).

 Among the many who had heard the tale of a fabled lost museum devoted
 to interactive fiction, you alone thought the myth was rooted in
 truth. Perseverence paid off, though, and by golly, you found it.
 Tragicly, you lost your cohorts Jim and Kevin to an ill-considered
 mining expedition to Pluto, so you are embarking on this adventure
 alone. You have already ransacked the other wings of the museum. The
 one thing left to do is to crack the...

 "Oh, guzzletuff!" exclaims Merk. "Why can't they make these like they
 used to? This is the fourth keyboard I've broken this week!"

 He sweeps the shattered bits of the plastic keyboard into the spacebin
 and sits down to write a letter.

 Apartment
 This is where you live with your buddy Jim. His stuff adorns every
 surface of the room. The front door leads out to the north.

 On the counter is an envelope (closed).

>read envelope
 Written on the outside, in an awkward, alien hand: "For Jim and
 Kevin".

>open it
 You open the envelope, revealing a letter.

>read letter
 It reads:

 Dear Jim and Kevin,
 I have a mission for you: find me a 100-year-old typewriter. You'll be
 rewarded with space riches beyond your wildest dreams!
 Your new friend,
 Merk from Pluto

 The door opens, and Jim arrives. "Hey, man! What's crack-a-lackin'?"

 He nods toward the opened envelope. "Oh yeah," he says. "I found that
 outside the door this morning. Anything good? Lemme see!"

>give letter to jim
 (first taking the letter)
 You hand the letter to Jim. He skims through it and says, "Crazy. Wish
 I could help you, but I got a big date tonight. Like, stupid big. Have
 fun!"

 He hands you the letter and walks right back out the door.

 Well, better get started looking for that typewriter. You dig a phone
 book out from the pile of stuff.

>read book
 You flip the phone book open to the Typewriters section. Looks like
 there's only one typewriter store open today: Braintree Typewriter
 Services, a couple miles from the Braintree station.

>examine phone book
 No need to open the phone book again. You remember that you're going
 to Braintree Typewriter Services, a couple miles from the Braintree
 station.

>examine stuff
 What a mess. There's just way too much stuff to even think about
 listing it.

 Street
 This is the street in front of your apartment. The front door of your
 apartment is to the south, and down the block to the west, you can see
 Broadway Station.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>close door
 You close the front door.

>go west

 Broadway Station
 Red signage covering the walls indicates that this is the Broadway
 station on the Red Line. To the east, you can see the street leading
 to your apartment.

 A turnstile stands between you and the boarding platform.

>examine turnstile
 It prevents you from getting to the boarding platform unless you
 insert a ticket.

 Track sunk into a dangerous-looking trench runs through the room. The
 outer part of the station is to the east.

 The train arrives with a gust of wind. Its doors open, and you step on
 board.

 Train
 This train car looks clean enough. There are rows of seats on either
 side. Doors lead out.

>sit on seat
 You get onto the seat.

 The doors close, and the train begins to move. After a few minutes, a
 voice intones, "Now arriving at Broadway."

 The train comes to a stop, and the doors open.

 You leave the train, find some stairs leading out of the station, and
 walk outside.

 Outside Braintree Station
 You're at the top of the stairs leading out of Braintree Station. The

 Pilgrims Highway leads southeast toward the typewriter store.

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 You hike along the highway for a few miles, finally arriving at the

 Braintree Typewriter Services
 Typewriters are everywhere, typewriters, typewriters!

 A salesman is watching you.

 He's wearing a cheap suit and reeks of typewriters.

>buy typewriter
 Nothing is on sale.

>examine typewriters
 They're everywhere, they, they!

>show letter to salesman
 The salesman is unimpressed.

>ask salesman about 100-year-old typewriter
 "As a matter of fact, we just got a 100-year-old typewriter. Come into
 the back room, I'll show it to you."

 You follow him through a previously hidden door into the back room.

 Back Room
 Aged wood paneling suggests that this room doesn't get much use.

 You can see a table (on which is an old typewriter) here.

 The salesman gestures toward the table. "There you are. Go ahead, try
 it out."

 He slips out the door and shuts it behind him, leaving you trapped
 inside.

>examine typewriter
 It looks ancient! You can believe this is 100 years old.

>type on it
 You type "lovesong of sherlock holmes" on the old typewriter. Seems to
 work.

 You look around for some sign of where the salesman went, when
 suddenly a massive vacuum opens up in the middle of the room!
 Powerless to escape, you're soon sucked through and find yourself in
 an unfamiliar place.

 Tomb of the Unknown Tool
 This small room houses an unmade bed, several textbooks, and a lamp.
 The exit is to the south.

 Pluto
 From beneath a glass dome, you can see the unmistakable surface of
 Pluto. The Tomb is to the north.

 A green alien strolls up to the outside of the dome, waving his
 tentacles annoyedly.

 He speaks to you. "I didn't tell you to get a cursed typewriter!
 That's no help to me at all, and now look what you've done: the curse
 has followed you through the vacuum and infested my planet. See these
 tentacles? I didn't have tentacles when I woke up this morning! Who
 knows what will happen next?"

>ask alien about curse
 There is no reply.

 The alien continues. "The only option now is to blow up the planet.
 Long ago, my space ancestors fitted this planet with a self-destruct
 mechanism for just such an occasion. Unfortunately, the builder who
 installed this dome forgot about it. You'll have to activate it from
 inside."

>look
 Pluto
 From beneath a glass dome, you can see the unmistakable surface of

 An ominous plunger slowly rises out of the ground.

 The alien points to it and says, "There. Don't worry about me, just do
 what needs to be done. Today is a good day to die."

>pull plunger
 The handle pulls right out! Embarrassed, you drop it back in.

 You press the plunger. A series of loud explosions ensues, but you
 only have an instant to register them before you're vaporized.
