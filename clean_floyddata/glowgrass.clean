 The dropship sways dangerously as the pilot trys to correct for
 slipstream effects.  Clutching the thin monofilament line doesn't do a
 lot for your stability, but at least it helps you concentrate.  You
 risk a glance below - stupid thing to do, really, at this height, even
 after taking the anti-vertigo treatment - and you're rewarded with a
 glimpse of the ruins.  Tantalisingly close, almost totally preserved.
 After all these years, to finally reach an intact Ancient site -

 The line shears in your fingers, and in sudden slow-motion horror you
 watch the buckle, the support harness, your entire equipment pack come
 wrenching up and over your arms.  The debris dangles gracefully in
 midair for the longest moment, then slides away out of reach as
 gravity takes over.

 Your involuntary scream, drowned in the wind, turns to a jerking gasp
 as you fall through the jungle tree cover, rolling, sliding, and
 finally landing with a thud on solid ground -

 The ground of the Ancients!


 GLOWGRASS
 An Interactive Short Story
 Copyright (C) 1997 by Nate Cull
 Release 1 (3rd Annual IF Contest release)

 Courtyard
 This appears to be some kind of courtyard in the centre of an Ancient
 dwelling. The building itself swings around to the north and west,
 terminating in a crumbling retaining wall due south.  A smaller domed
 construction opens to the northeast, through a wide metal door
 (closed).  To the east is a flat space that could bear further
 exploring.

 You hear a high-pitched decelerating whine -- a dropship turbine in
 trouble -- from the northeast, followed by a dull roaring crash.  Just
 in time, you duck and cover your eyes.  Blue-white light etches across
 the landscape, then the gravity blast wave hits.  Every molecule in
 your private universe shudders.

 A minute later, you get to your feet, pain gnawing your body.  Scratch
 one dropship; nobody could have survived that crash.  Scratch your
 equipment.  Now it's just you, your wits - and the Ancients.  Hope
 you're as good a xenohistorian as you claimed at the Institute.
 Because unless you find some kind of way out of here, it could be
 months before a recovery team locates you.

>examine myself
 You're a world-renowned xenohistorian and student of Ancient
 artifacts.  And you're in reasonably good shape, given the mess this
 field trip has turned into.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>go east
 Lawn
 You're standing in a square area of neatly trimmed green lawn,
 shimmering faintly in the afternoon light.  To the west, the lawn
 gives way to courtyard, and beyond it to the west and north are
 buildings.  An odd, paved rectangular depression in the ground leads
 down to the southeast; the encroaching jungle vegetation further back
 is kept at bay by a barrier of translucent sheeting.

 Something about the scene gives you a sudden tingle of recognition, a
 surge of awe.  As if you're walking into a legend.

>examine ship
 I don't see any ship here.

>se
 Pool
 You're standing in a concrete rectangle set into the ground, paved
 with a grey substance, probably stressed concrete.  It's recognisable
 as a swimming pool, a popular Ancient recreation fixture.  Whatever
 water was once here has long since drained away, probably through the
 outlet grate set centrally in the pool's floor.

 You see a bright orange object here.

>examine object
 It's a bright orange polymer casting, moulded in the shape of a spiral
 disk.  A tiny legend on the now faded material reads, in the Ancient
 language, FRISBEE (tm) HELIPTA.

>take frisbee
 Taken.

>inventory
 You have a Frisbee Helipta.

>throw frisbee
 The Frisbee Helipta spins furiously as it leaves your hand, hovers
 briefly before shooting straight up into the air, then glides in a
 graceful spiral back into your hand.  Reminds you of a a modern
 dropship in flight.

>examine grate
 In the outlet grate you see a set of cards.

>take cards
 With some difficulty, you fish the set of cards out of the outlet
 grate.  Taken.

>examine cards
 It's a set of card-sized holographic images, in full colour, printed
 on some kind of synthetic backing material which has survived
 immersion in a pool of water for years.  Flicking through the holos,
 you see images of an Ancient family seated in an aerial vehicle; a
 young girl, holding what looks like a fabric toy; the same girl, a
 little older, throwing an orange disklike object; the family again,
 together, around the pool; the girl, older yet, examining a blade of
 grass with an optical instrument.  Definitely, this is an important
 xenohistorical artifact.

>pull grate
 Pulling the outlet grate doesn't have any effect.

>go south
 You can only go up to the northwest.

>go northwest
 Lawn
 You're standing in a square area of neatly trimmed green lawn,
 shimmering faintly in the afternoon light.  To the west, the lawn
 gives way to courtyard, and beyond it to the west and north are
 buildings.  An odd, paved rectangular depression in the ground leads
 down to the southeast; the encroaching jungle vegetation further back
 is kept at bay by a barrier of translucent sheeting.

 Something about the scene gives you a sudden tingle of recognition, a
 surge of awe.  As if you're walking into a legend.

>examine barrier
 The barrier is a thin, translucent film, resembling modern polycarbon
 alloys.  Possibly an early form of monomolecular diamond; if so, it
 confirms some of your theories about the development of Ancient
 materials handling.  It stands nearly three metres high, forming a
 protective wall across the entire south and east edges of the lawn
 area.

>remember
 I don't know the word "remember".

>climb barrier
 I don't know how to climb the translucent barrier.

>touch it
 Touching the translucent barrier doesn't seem to have any effect.

>examine lawn
 The lawn grass radiates a pale green glow.

 You suddenly realise what it is that struck you about the lawn.  It's
 glowing!  And it's _completely untouched._ The chill works deep into
 your spine.  This is a find so staggering, you'd never thought it
 possible.

 Glowgrass.  One of the earliest successes of Ancient genetic
 engineering.  A simple enough idea; graft firefly genes into the DNA
 of common lawn grass.  Primitive tests on tobacco plants had proved
 the concept worked; the rest was only a matter of commerce.  (Ancient
 economic theory was strange in many ways, but you're as well informed
 as any modern scholar can be).

 And by the end of the Ancient era, almost every family home had its
 glowgrass lawn.  You picture children playing on the soft shining
 green mat, imagine the laughter and music of a vanished age.  An age
 of ghosts, legends, heroes.

 One small clump of grass, growing alone by the concrete edge, attracts
 your attention; it would make a perfect scientific specimen for the
 Institute.

>take clump
 Taken.

>score
 You're here.  And you're alive.  That's enough, for now.

>examine clump
 It's a clump of glowgrass, unchanged since the Ancient era.  The tiny
 green blades glow with a pale green light.

>smell clump
 It smells just like a clump of glowgrass.

>Grue-repellent!
 I don't know the word "grue-repellent".

>go west
 Courtyard
 This appears to be some kind of courtyard in the centre of an Ancient
 dwelling. The building itself swings around to the north and west,
 terminating in a crumbling retaining wall due south.  A smaller domed
 construction opens to the northeast, through a wide metal door
 (closed).  To the east is a flat space that could bear further
 exploring.

 You briefly catch a metallic glimmer from the top of the wall.

>taste clump
 I don't know the word "taste".

>examine glimmer
 The object looks metallic, and out of place in the vegetation above
 the wall.  It could - you hardly dare to hope - could be a piece of
 equipment from your pack, but you can't tell which one from this
 distance.

>examine ship
 The dropship is gone, crashed somewhere nearby in the jungle.  Another
 casualty of these local slipstream winds.  The critics at the
 Institute were right; you were lucky to get this far alive.

>climb wall
 I don't know how to climb the southern wall.

>get glimmer
 The metallic object is too high to reach with your hands alone.
 Perhaps you could find something to help you get it down.

>throw frisbee at glimmer
 The metallic object is too high to reach with your hands alone.
 Perhaps you could find something to help you get it down.

>throw frisbee
 The Frisbee Helipta spins furiously as it leaves your hand, hovers
 briefly before shooting straight up into the air, knocking into the
 vegatation at the top of the retaining wall, and dislodging a metallic
 object, which falls back to the ground with it.

>examine object
 It's a bright orange polymer casting, moulded in the shape of a spiral
 disk.  A tiny legend on the now faded material reads, in the Ancient
 language, FRISBEE (tm) HELIPTA.

>take glimmer
 Taken.

>examine glimmer
 This is definitely a piece of your equipment.  It's a magprobe, a
 silvery rod about ten centimetres long and half a centimetre wide.
 The ceramic inductors inside are crude, useless for interfacing with
 any modern technology, but sufficient to manipulate small
 ferromagnetic devices.

>go northeast
 You'll have to open the northeast door first.

>open northeast door
 The door appears to be locked, using a simple ferromagnetic latch from
 the middle Ancient period.  Perhaps the magprobe might prove useful
 here, after all.

>probe door
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>use probe
 Try unlocking something with it.

>unlock door with probe
 After a few minutes of careful manipulation with the magprobe, you
 feel the door's magnetic contacts click open.  You breath a sigh of
 relief; those hours of studying Ancient artifacts at the Institute
 training finally paid off.

>go northeast
 You'll have to open the northeast door first.

>open door
 The wide metallic door slides upward, creaking a little, and clangs
 jerkily to a halt.

>go northeast
 Vehicle Dome
 This domed construction is fairly small compared to the building
 proper, and open to the air at the southwest.  Given today's scholarly
 confusion about many Ancient living habits, it could serve any number
 of functions.  But the giveaway is the vehicle stationed in the middle
 of the floor.  An interior door, currently closed, leads west to to
 whatever mysteries lie within the main building.

 The vehicle, a primitive skycar, rests under the centre of the dome.

 Glancing around the dome, your spirits rise a little.  Your initial
 orbital scan of the site has proved accurate; the building is intact.
 And if the living quarters are as well-preserved as this...  then who
 knows what treasures you might find?

>examine vehicle
 You recognise the Ancient vehicle from Institute file fragments.  If
 this one is anything like the reconstructions you examined, it uses a
 solid-state power cell to jumpstart deuterium-hydrogen fusion,
 ejecting its clean-burning fuel directly as accelerated reaction mass.
 A clumsy system, compared to today's gravitic drives, but possibly
 more reliable in the short term.  The skycar's sleek angular lines are
 marred by ugly thermal scars, as if the vehicle was caught in some
 kind of blast before being landed here.  An entrance hatch in the
 vehicle's side is closed.

 Looking at the skycar, you feel a surge of hope.  Despite the
 vehicle's age, it seems intact.  Maybe, if you could somehow get it to
 work...

 The thought dies as quickly as it came.  Stupid idea.  You have no
 idea how to fly the thing, and who knows what parts are missing?

>open hatch
 At a touch from your hand, the skycar's entrance hatch swings open.

>look in
 What do you want to look in?

>enter car
 You step into the vehicle.

 Skycar, in vehicle dome
 The interior of the skycar is fairly cramped compared to a modern
 altiwing or dropship.  There's a control console directly in front of
 you, and a viewshield through which you can see the vehicle dome.  The
 exit hatch to your side is open; in the rear of the car is an access
 panel (currently closed).

>look in skycar
 You're in the skycar; it's all around you.

>open panel
 Opening the access panel reveals a power cell, a corroded metal coil,
 and a triangular hole.

>examine hole
 It's a triangular hole, with what looks like some kind of one-way
 filter or valve beneath it.  It's inscribed with a teardrop symbol.

>examine coil
 It's a thin coil of some heavily corroded metal, about ten centimetres
 long and three across.

>examine symbol
 Which symbol do you mean, the green button, or the triangular hole?

>triangular
 It's a triangular hole, with what looks like some kind of one-way
 filter or valve beneath it.  It's inscribed with a teardrop symbol.

>smell
 You smell nothing unusual.

>out
 You step out into the vehicle dome.

 Vehicle Dome
 This domed construction is fairly small compared to the building
 proper, and open to the air at the southwest.  Given today's scholarly
 confusion about many Ancient living habits, it could serve any number
 of functions.  But the giveaway is the vehicle stationed in the middle
 of the floor.  An interior door, currently closed, leads west to to
 whatever mysteries lie within the main building.

 The vehicle, a primitive skycar, rests under the centre of the dome.

>go west
 You'll have to open the western door first.

>open western door. w.
 After a few minutes of careful probing, you locate the door's catch
 mechanism -- some Ancient artifacts require care, because of the
 paranoid security devices which were a feature of the age -- but this
 one yields easily at a touch.  The door slides upwards, revealing a
 room to the west.

 Living Area
 You're in what seems to be the central space of the dwelling, a wide
 living area that still retains the awe and innocence of the Ancient
 age.  The room is now mainly bare, apart from shreds of mouldered
 textile on the decayed timber floor, and an intriguing floor sculpture
 poised opposite a two-metre black cube.  There is a door to the east
 (open), and hallways leading west and southwest.

 Dust.  That's your first impression.  And...  emptiness.  Somehow
 you'd expected an intact Ancient dwelling to be bright, exotic,
 bulging with secrets and arcane lore.  But maybe that was only ever a
 myth; maybe the Ancients just didn't build everything to last.

>examine dust
 I don't see any dust here.

>examine cube
 The cube is black and nearly featureless, apart from a blue button
 marked with a lightning bolt symbol, a hexagonal socket, and a
 ten-centimetre disk slot.  There's a yellow disk in the slot.  Black
 words embossed on the cube's polymer face spell out the legend
 "Sonjitsu 2100 Immersive Entertainment System", whatever that means.

>press blue button
 The button clicks, but nothing happens.  The device doesn't seem
 damaged; perhaps it requires an external power supply.

>examine hexagonal
 The socket is hexagonal, about two centimetres across.  It's probably
 designed to take some kind of cable.

>save
>cf1
 Saved.

>examine textile
 The textile floor-coverings are valuable xenohistorical artifacts, but
 they're useless to you right now.

>look under textile
 The textile floor-coverings are valuable xenohistorical artifacts, but
 they're useless to you right now.

>examine sculpture
 The floor sculpture seems to be formed from some transparent
 semi-plastic polymer, poured into a web of interlocking fractal loops
 and twists.  It stands about half a metre high and two metres around,
 and gives softly when you touch it.  As a sculpture it's quaintly
 beautiful, in an abstract kind of way; but you sense there's some
 further purpose to it.  Perhaps the fact that it's in a direct line of
 sight to the black cube might mean something.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Saved.

>enter sculpture
 I don't know how to enter the floor sculpture.

>unravel sculpture
 I don't know the word "unravel".

>move it
 You can't move the floor sculpture.

>push sculpture
 The floor sculpture moves softly at your touch and springs back when
 you remove your hand.  It feels as if it could support some weight.

>take cube
 You can't have the black cube.

>climb sculpture
 I don't know how to climb the floor sculpture.

>jump on sculpture
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>sit on sculpture
 Of course!  That's what it is - a seating device!  Okay, you're now
 sitting on the sculptured chair.  The polymer loops sway beneath you,
 distributing your mass until you feel nearly weightless.  The black
 cube is now directly centred in your field of vision.

>examine cube
 The cube is black and nearly featureless, apart from a blue button
 marked with a lightning bolt symbol, a hexagonal socket, and a
 ten-centimetre disk slot.  There's a yellow disk in the slot.  Black
 words embossed on the cube's polymer face spell out the legend

 I don't know the word "couch".

>xyzzy
 I don't know the word "xyzzy".

>go west
 Service Area
 Judging from the stark utility of this room, compared to the airy
 spaciousness of the living area, it's a service or preparation area.
 Possibly a kitchen for food, though from its role in Ancient legends
 you'd pictured a more warming aura than this.  Metal alloy surfaces,
 their function unknown, line the walls; the only exits are east and
 southwest.

 You see a printout here.

>read printout
 San Francisco, USNA.  North American President Jarvies Erlmann today
 denied rumours that tactical nuclear devices could be used to fight
 the viral mutagen popularly known as the Green Plague.

 "The idea was floated at a strategy briefing," Erlmann's online avatar
 announced during his live press conference at vr.whitehouse.gov, "but
 I can definitely state that it is an unfeasible option and will not be
 applied.  The North American government will continue to provide
 financial and scientific assistance to the state of Europe in dealing
 with this threat, but detonating nuclear weapons on foreign soil would
 constitute a breach of the 2012 Geneva Treaty.  For God's sake,
 people, we're talking about vaporising whole cities!  Let's get a
 perspective!"

 Erlmann's position, while predictable from his stance on human rights,
 seems precarious given the overwhelming support in the United Nations
 for drastic measures against the Plague.  The spread of the mutagen,
 which has already claimed twelve major cities worldwide including
 London, Athens, Cairo and Geneva, continues to accelerate, according
 to the World Health Organisation Special Incident Committee
 (vr.theplague.med/whosic/hourlystats).

>get printout

>go southwest
 Hygiene Area
 This is a soothing, white-walled chamber with soft rounded surfaces,
 much like being inside an egg.  From your knowledge of Ancient social
 mores, it's likely to be a personal cleansing area.  There is a blue
 lens embedded in the western wall, with a placard above it, and a
 white vat standing opposite it.  Round curtained apartures lead
 northeast and southeast.

>read placard
 EnviroMaster UV showerhead.  For a guaranteed sterile environment.
 WHOSIC Green certified.

>examine lens
 The blue lens is embedded into the wall of the chamber.  It looks like
 some kind of light based cleansing device, now non-functional.

>examine vat
 The vat is white, about fifty ventimetres high, and sealed, although
 it seems to be filled with liquid.  You could probably lift it with
 both hands.  There is a label on one side and a small tap near the
 bottom.

>examine label
 HydroSource Sterile Water Supplies.  Europe's Number One for quality
 and protection.  WHOSIC Green certified.

>get all
 You'll need to take that one thing at a time.

>take vate
 I don't know the word "vate".

>take vat
 Taken.

>examine tap
 It's a mechanical device for controlling the flow of liquid out of the
 vat, with a triangular mouth.  You would probably have to put the tap
 into some receptacle, then open it, to get the liquid, otherwise it
 would be wasted.

 I don't know the word "aperture".

 Sleep Area
 Some things never change over the ages.  This looks like a room for
 rest and sleeping - there's a polymer mattress on the floor, moulded
 as a single unit and still intact.  The walls are covered with
 colourful images, presumably icons from Ancient culture; there's years
 of work here for a psycholinguistic team alone.  Doorways lead
 northeast and northwest.

 But the immediate sight that catches your eye - and your breath - is
 what's sprawled on the mattress.  A young Ancient skeleton, complete
 and fully preserved.  You can barely keep from trembling.

>examine images
 Which images do you mean, the set of holograms, or the wall glyphs?

>examine skeleton
 With icy stabs of excitement coursing down your spine, you bend over
 the sad remains to examine them more closely.

 The skeleton is moderately sized, but smaller than recent digs and
 salvaged files indicate was normal for an Ancient adult; this was
 almost certainly a young female.  She lies on the bed crouched in a
 fetal position, her arms twisted as if shielding her face from intense
 pain.  There is no obvious evidence of external injury, but the odd
 displacement of joints in the upper and lower limbs, along with deep
 cracking of the bone structure, suggests violent muscular spasms as
 she died.  In her right hand, the woman clutches a small object;
 possibly some kind of electronic device, with leads running from the
 box in her hand to a headset draped across her skull.

 A gasp wells in your throat, as vividly you relive how it must have
 been; to suffer such agony, so young.  For the first time you regret
 the empathic talent which led you to xenohistory.  A moment later, the
 mood passes, leaving you still somehow chilled.

>glyphs
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine device
 The device is possibly a recording or playback instrument of some
 kind; it has a slot for a ten-centimetre disk, a common Ancient data
 storage format.  Words embossed into its polymer surface read "Kodak
 Synapsit (tm) Neural Transfer System."  Judging by the corrosion
 stains seeping from inside the device, it's completely non-functional.
 There's a green disk in the slot.

 It appears to be a thin metallic polymer disk around ten centimetres
 in diameter, with a green tint.  You recognise the object from
 Institute files as an Ancient data storage device.

 stains seeping from inside the device, it's completely non-functional.
 The disk slot is empty.

>examine holograms
 It's a set of card-sized holographic images, in full colour, printed
 on some kind of synthetic backing material which has survived
 immersion in a pool of water for years.  Flicking through the holos,
 you see images of an Ancient family seated in an aerial vehicle; a
 young girl, holding what looks like a fabric toy; the same girl, a
 little older, throwing an orange disklike object; the family again,
 together, around the pool; the girl, older yet, examining a blade of
 grass with an optical instrument.  Definitely, this is an important
 xenohistorical artifact.

>take headset
 The skeleton is clutching the device so tightly, it would be
 impossible to remove without risking severe damage.  You'll have to
 find another way of learning more about it.

>touch skeleton
 Not likely.  This is your most outstanding find yet, and every detail
 of the body's position is vital data.  It would take a complete
 archeological forensics team at least a week to study and capture the
 remains before they felt at all comfortable with moving it, and even
 then it would be an emergency operation; you've got no equipment, not
 even a basic quantum chromodynamagraph.

 It would be impossible to sit on the mattress without disturbing the
 position of the skeleton.

 as a single unit and still intact.  The walls are covered with
 colourful images, presumably icons from Ancient culture; there's years
 of work here for a psycholinguistic team alone.  Doorways lead
 northeast and northwest.

 Sprawled out on the mattress is a lone Ancient skeleton.

>go northeast
 Living Area
 You're in what seems to be the central space of the dwelling, a wide
 living area that still retains the awe and innocence of the Ancient
 age.  The room is now mainly bare, apart from shreds of mouldered
 textile on the decayed timber floor, and a sculptured chair poised
 opposite a two-metre black cube.  There is a door to the east (open),
 and hallways leading west and southwest.

>go east
 Vehicle Dome
 This domed construction is fairly small compared to the building
 proper, and open to the air at the southwest.  Given today's scholarly
 confusion about many Ancient living habits, it could serve any number
 of functions.  But the giveaway is the vehicle stationed in the middle
 of the floor.  An interior door, currently open, leads west to to the
 living area.

 The vehicle, a primitive skycar, rests under the centre of the dome.

>inventory
 You have a set of holograms, a clump of glowgrass, a magprobe, a
 printout, a white vat, and a green disk.

>in
 You step into the vehicle.

 Skycar, in vehicle dome
 The interior of the skycar is fairly cramped compared to a modern
 altiwing or dropship.  There's a control console directly in front of
 you, and a viewshield through which you can see the vehicle dome.  The
 exit hatch to your side is open; in the rear of the car is an access
 panel (currently open).

>examine panel
 The access panel is open.  In the access panel you see a power cell, a
 corroded metal coil, and a triangular hole.

>SAVE

>examine coil
 It's a thin coil of some heavily corroded metal, about ten centimetres
 long and three across.

>fill hole with vat
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>put tap in hole
 You hold the vat over the access panel and rest the tap inside the
 triangular hole.  It fits neatly.

>examine power cell
 The solid state power cell, easily the most distinctive Ancient
 artifact of all, is a rectangular solid block around thirty
 centimetres tall and half as wide and deep.  It's silver in colour,
 completely featureless apart from the logo "Energiser (tm)" and a
 hexagonal socket.

>open tap
 You open the tap, sending liquid trickling into the triangular hole.
 After a few minutes, the vat is empty.

>examine socket
 The socket is hexagonal, about two centimetres across.  It's probably
 designed to take some kind of cable.

 Service Area
 Judging from the stark utility of this room, compared to the airy
 spaciousness of the living area, it's a service or preparation area.
 Possibly a kitchen for food, though from its role in Ancient legends
 you'd pictured a more warming aura than this.  Metal alloy surfaces,
 their function unknown, line the walls; the only exits are east and
 southwest.

>rummage
 I don't know the word "rummage".

>examine surfaces
 The metal surfaces could have been used for storage, or perhaps
 manipulation, of food products.  Most of them are open and empty,
 their contents gone.  But one small vertical panel seems worth more
 investigation.

>open panel
 I don't know how to open the vertical panel.

>push panel
 At a touch from your hand, the panel slides out from the wall,
 revealing a storage cupboard.

>look in
 (the storage cupboard)
 In the storage cupboard you see a black cable and a white box.

>examine cable
 The cable is about two metres long, with hexagonal connectors at each
 ends.  From your knowledge of Ancient technology, it seems likely to
 be some kind of data or energy transfer device.

>examine box
 It's a small box made from some decay-resistant pressed fibre,
 possibly spun carbon or silicon.  A label reads "Surefire palladium
 ignitor coils, contents 6".  The white box is closed.

 The black cable plugs neatly into the power cell's socket.  The other

>connect cable to cube

 (also dropping the power cell)
 The black cable plugs neatly into the cube's socket, linking the black
 cube to the power cell.

>examine cube
 The cube is black and nearly featureless, apart from a blue button
 marked with a lightning bolt symbol, a hexagonal socket, and a
 ten-centimetre disk slot.  There's a yellow disk in the slot.  Black
 words embossed on the cube's polymer face spell out the legend
 "Sonjitsu 2100 Immersive Entertainment System", whatever that means.

>push blue
 The black cube hums.  A tiny flicker of light, barely visible in your
 peripheral vision, appears in the room, along with a suggestion of
 muted sound.

>sit on sculpture
 Okay, you're now sitting on the sculptured chair.  The polymer loops
 sway beneath you, distributing your mass until you feel nearly
 weightless.  The black cube is now directly centred in your field of
 vision.

 The flicker of light and sound suddenly takes form, merging into an
 experience that swells through your mind.

 Twilight Lawn, in the sculptured chair
 The neat square of grass shines with a pale green glow, almost as
 bright now as the last ray of sunset afterglow.  Dark shapes of
 buildings loom comfortably all around, while evening stars, mere
 pinpoints of light, appear in the deep blue sky.

 A young Ancient girl stands in the middle of the lawn, shivering.

 You take a sharp breath.  The girl - she must be the same age as you
 judged the skeleton to be.  So this is some kind of recording; perhaps
 the first ever complete personal diary of an Ancient!

>examine girl
 The girl is young, probably in her late teenage years taking into
 account the difference in aging rates between Ancient and modern
 biochemistries.  She has deep blue eyes and reddish-brown hair; you're
 struck by such an unusual colour, which is only accentuated by the
 black jumpsuit she wears.  Perhaps it was once the colour of mourning,
 which would be appropriate given her manner.  She looks up at the
 evening stars, unaware of you.

 The girl winces as if controlling a surge of pain, looks up at the
 stars, and starts speaking.

 "Tuesday.  This'll be...  ahh...  my last entry.  Six weeks since
 Quarantine.  I think everyone...  uhh...  else must be dead.
 Infection's so...  nngh...  fast."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "Took the 'car up this afternoon.  Last chance to make...  uuuhh..  a
 run for it.  No sky patrols.  Didn't realise, too late.  They'd
 evac'ed the area.  Sky went white, two suns.  Never thought I'd see
 that and live.  Dived to miss the firestorm but got...  nnnng...
 heaps of rads in the, whatever, flash.  Landed back home.  No use
 running, I'm dead either way, nuke or plague.  Lucky the house
 survived.  Valley must've shielded it."

>examine lawn
 The lawn scene is strangely haunting.

 The girl tenses, her whole body shuddering, and paces around the lawn.

 "Anyway...  no time left...  getting the shakes real bad...  hope this
 is recording okay.  Pulled some 'stricted files off the net...
 crosswired neural inputs.  Hyper illegal but that's hardly
 important...  if it works maybe...  someone will find it and...  wish
 Mum and Dad had tried this...  couldn't even find the other memory
 pack..."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The girl's image fluctuates, breaking up.  Even the background wavers.
 "Losing...  it...  pulse...  overlo...  no...  don't want to die
 like..."

 The image suddenly clears.  The girl freezes in mid-frame, jerks,
 collapses to the ground.

>wait
 Time passes...

>look
 Twilight Lawn, in the sculptured chair
 The neat square of grass shines with a pale green glow, almost as
 bright now as the last ray of sunset afterglow.  Dark shapes of
 buildings loom comfortably all around, while evening stars, mere
 pinpoints of light, appear in the deep blue sky.

 The body of a young Ancient girl lies sprawled on the lawn.

>examine body
 The paperlike substance appears to be a digital data service printout
 in the standard Ancient language, Ingles-2.  Loosely translated, the
 headline reads:  UNITED EUROPE NEWSWEB 2068.261.08.35 (the numbers
 could be either a date or location code).  NUKES WON'T HALT GREEN
 PLAGUE - ERLMANN.  An article, in closely printed body text, follows.

 Slowly, as if in a dream, the girl gets to her feet.  Her image seems
 more chunky, less detailed than before.

 "What..." she manages.  "How..."  Then she sees you.  "Oh God!"  she
 whispers.  "It... I did it.  I'm... Oh, God, no!  I can't have been
 that stupid!"

 The girl turns to you, shivering for real now.  She speaks the Ancient
 syllables so fast you can barely translate.  "Who are you?  Where am
 I?  What have you done to my mind?"

>talk to girl
 What do you want to talk to it about?

>hello
 Nice weather we've been having.

 "Who are you?"  repeats the girl, plainly terrified.

>girl, hello
 The girl listens wide-eyed while you try to explain who you are; an
 explorer from her future.  It sounds strange, even to you.  Her eyes
 lose some of their terror, but remains taut and wary.

 "Marie", she says.  "Marie Hyde.  The lost."

 A tingling chill seeps deep into your bones, and you dimly realise
 that you're sweating.  Neural transfer.  A technology only crudely
 developed by the Ancients, but the potential would have been in place.
 Is it possible this girl was desperate enough to risk a full-mind
 simulation?  To copy her entire soul to a machine?

 If that's true, you've made the most stunning discovery of the
 millenium.  This simulation you've awoken could be not just a
 recording - but an Ancient's living replica!

>ask girl about plaque
 I don't know the word "plaque".

>ask girl about plague
 "The Green Plague was the worst bio-disaster in history," says Marie,
 shivering.  "Worse than XIT or the Carbon Flu.  It wiped out whole
 cities.  Probably the world, for all I know.  I don't know how it
 started.  Maybe a geneering accident.  Or a weapon that got loose.  It
 usually caused death within days."  She looks over her shoulder, and
 crosses her arms over her chest.  "That's how I died.  Funny, I always
 used to pity the survivors."

>ask marie about marie
 Marie's eyes flash.  "I'm a figment of a computer's imagination, and
 I'm trapped here in a vee-ar sim forever.  My parents are dead and my
 world is probably extinct.  Otherwise, I'm just fine.  Why should you
 care?"

 Marie looks around, cautiously.  "I wish I could see something," she
 says.  "Something from home.  To prove it's not just a dream."

>show marie the glowgrass
 Marie looks at the clump of glowgrass, wonder in her eyes.  "The
 grass," she says.  "You found some.  It's still there."  Her eyes turn
 pixelised, beyond the capacity of the simulation to render them.  "I
 used to dream of this as a child.  They were always good dreams."

 Marie seems to relax a little, but still remains cautious.

 Marie looks around, cautiously.  "I wish I could see something else,"
 she says. "Something else from home."

>show her the holograms
 Marie looks at each of the holograms in turn, tears forming in her
 simulated eyes.  "Yes," she says.  "That was me.  That was my life."

 Marie seems to relax a little, but still remains cautious.

>show holograms to marie
 Marie looks puzzled.  "You've already shown me that."

>inventory
 You have a set of holograms, a clump of glowgrass, a magprobe, a
 printout, a white vat, a white box, and a yellow disk.

>ask marie about nukes
 Marie is silent for a moment.  "Yeah, they nuked us," she says.  "It
 was the only thing they knew that would stop the Plague."  She looks
 around the room, and shivers.  "I guess it must have worked, in the
 end.  But I'm not one of the lucky survivors."

 Marie looks around, cautiously.  "I wish I could see something else,"
 she says. "Something else from home."

>ask marie about news

>ask marie about europe
 I don't know the word "europe".

>show vat to marie
 "It's just a vat of sterile water," says Marie.  "Might be useful."

>show disk to marie
 Marie shrugs, indicating either ignorance or unwillingness to answer.

>ask marie about car
 Marie's eyes cloud with suspicion.  "And why would you be interested
 in our family skycar?  I'll tell you this much.  It won't start
 without a password.  But I'd have to trust someone a lot before I let
 them know the code."

>ask marie about skycar

 "President Erlmann?  He's the American president who authorised the

 guess he had no choice."

 Marie looks around, cautiously.  "I wish I could see something else,"
 she says. "Something else from home."

>ask her about me
 Marie listens as you explain again who you are and how you came to be

 "I believe you," she says, but her eyes are troubled.  "Just leave me
 alone.  I need to grieve."

 Marie looks around, cautiously.  "I wish I could see something else,"
 she says. "Something else from home."

 Marie seems to relax a little, but still remains cautious.

 as if stretching the computational power of the projector system to
 its limit.  She looks at you, taut and wary, an arm's reach away.

>throw frisbee
 The Frisbee Helipta spins furiously as it leaves your hand, hovers
 briefly before shooting straight up into the air, then hits the
 ceiling and tumbles awkwardly to the floor.  Guess it wasn't designed
 for use indoors.  Dropped.  The Frisbee Helipta vanishes from the
 illusion.

 Sleep Area
 Some things never change over the ages.  This looks like a room for
 rest and sleeping - there's a polymer mattress on the floor, moulded
 as a single unit and still intact.  The walls are covered with
 colourful images, presumably icons from Ancient culture; there's years
 of work here for a psycholinguistic team alone.  Doorways lead
 northeast and northwest.

 Sprawled out on the mattress is a lone Ancient skeleton.

>take images
 Which images do you mean, the set of holograms, or the wall glyphs?

>examine mattress
 Aside from the Ancient skeleton, there's a fabric animal on the
 mattress.

>take wall images
 The wall glyphs may well be important artifacts, but they tell you
 nothing of use right now.

>examine fabric animal
 It appears to be a colourful replica of a koala bear, one of the
 animal species from the Ancient era, extinct until very recently.  The
 fabric has remained almost intact, probably made from the same
 resilient material as the mattress.

>examine headset
 The device is possibly a recording or playback instrument of some
 kind; it has a slot for a ten-centimetre disk, a common Ancient data
 storage format.  Words embossed into its polymer surface read "Kodak
 Synapsit (tm) Neural Transfer System."  Judging by the corrosion
 stains seeping from inside the device, it's completely non-functional.
 The disk slot is empty.

 Sleep Area
 Some things never change over the ages.  This looks like a room for
 rest and sleeping - there's a polymer mattress on the floor, moulded
 as a single unit and still intact.  The walls are covered with
 colourful images, presumably icons from Ancient culture; there's years
 of work here for a psycholinguistic team alone.  Doorways lead
 northeast and northwest.

 Sprawled out on the mattress is a lone Ancient skeleton.

>look under bed
 There's nothing under the mattress.

>go northeast
 Living Area
 You're in what seems to be the central space of the dwelling, a wide
 living area that still retains the awe and innocence of the Ancient
 age.  The room is now mainly bare, apart from shreds of mouldered
 textile on the decayed timber floor, and a sculptured chair poised
 opposite a two-metre black cube.  There is a door to the east (open),
 and hallways leading west and southwest.

 A tiny flicker of light and sound dances frustratingly around your
 vision.

 You see a black cable (linking the black cube to the power cell), a
 power cell, and a Frisbee Helipta here.

>sit
 (the sculptured chair)
 Okay, you're now sitting on the sculptured chair.  The polymer loops
 sway beneath you, distributing your mass until you feel nearly
 weightless.  The black cube is now directly centred in your field of
 vision.

 The flicker of light and sound suddenly takes form, merging into an
 experience that swells through your mind.

 Twilight Lawn, in the sculptured chair
 The neat square of grass shines with a pale green glow, almost as
 bright now as the last ray of sunset afterglow.  Dark shapes of
 buildings loom comfortably all around, while evening stars, mere
 pinpoints of light, appear in the deep blue sky.

 The young Ancient, Marie, stands facing you, her eyes wary.

>show animal to marie
 Marie looks at the fabric bear, and a shiver runs down her body.
 "Miss Kelli," she says.  "I had her with me.  The last thing I saw..."
 She turns away, unable to continue.

 Marie pauses, as if she's finally coming to some internal decision.
 Then she steps forward and places one arm on your shoulder.  Her touch
 is warm; apparently the simulation includes tactile response.  Ancient
 technology must have been more advanced than even the Institute had
 realised.

 "I believe you," she says, struggling to keep a tear from appearing
 again.  "You're really here.  Walking through my home."

 Marie looks into your eyes, pain and hope colliding.

 "But there's nothing left for me now.  Everything I knew is gone."

>hug marie
 I don't know the word "hug".

>ask her about ancients
 "Ancients?"  says Marie sadly.  "Yes, I suppose we are to you.  I'd
 love to tell you everything I know about my world, but I don't think
 we have the time right now."

>touch marie
 Marie leans against your arms.  "Mmmm," she says softly.  "But we
 don't have time to waste like this."

>ask her about car
 Marie gasps.  "The skycar!  Of course!  I don't know if it could still
 work, but it's probably our best chance of getting out of here.
 You'll need a password to start the electrical system - just 'say
 dolphin' when the voice asks you.  And there's an onboard VR
 projector, too - you can keep me live."

 Marie grips your hand.  "Please.  Take me with you."

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

>marie, yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

>okay
 I don't know the word "okay".

>kiss marie
 Marie kisses you briefly on the lips.  "Mmmm," she says, "But I don't
 have the processor power for this right now.  And besides, you don't
 want me.  You want a girl who's alive."

 Marie grips your hand.  "Please.  Take me with you."

>take marie
 Marie leans against your arms.  "Mmmm," she says softly.  "But we
 don't have time to waste like this."

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer in the sculptured chair.  The image evaporates
 from your mind, leaving you slightly dizzy.

 The cube is black and nearly featureless, apart from a blue button
 marked with a lightning bolt symbol, a hexagonal socket, and a
 ten-centimetre disk slot.  There's a green disk in the slot.  Black
 words embossed on the cube's polymer face spell out the legend
 "Sonjitsu 2100 Immersive Entertainment System", whatever that means.

 Vehicle Dome
 This domed construction is fairly small compared to the building
 proper, and open to the air at the southwest.  Given today's scholarly
 confusion about many Ancient living habits, it could serve any number
 of functions.  But the giveaway is the vehicle stationed in the middle
 of the floor.  An interior door, currently open, leads west to to the
 living area.

 The vehicle, a primitive skycar, rests under the centre of the dome.

>look under car
 There's nothing under the skycar.

>examine car
 You recognise the Ancient vehicle from Institute file fragments.  If
 this one is anything like the reconstructions you examined, it uses a
 solid-state power cell to jumpstart deuterium-hydrogen fusion,
 ejecting its clean-burning fuel directly as accelerated reaction mass.
 A clumsy system, compared to today's gravitic drives, but possibly
 more reliable in the short term.  The skycar's sleek angular lines are
 marred by ugly thermal scars, as if the vehicle was caught in some
 kind of blast before being landed here.  An entrance hatch in the
 vehicle's side is open.

 This appears to be some kind of courtyard in the centre of an Ancient

 To the east is a flat space that could bear further exploring.

 The black cable plugs neatly into the cube's socket, linking the black

 The black cube hums.  A tiny flicker of light, barely visible in your
 peripheral vision, appears in the room, along with a suggestion of
 muted sound.

 Okay, you're now sitting on the sculptured chair.  The polymer loops
 sway beneath you, distributing your mass until you feel nearly
 weightless.  The black cube is now directly centred in your field of

 The flicker of light and sound suddenly takes form, merging into an
 experience that swells through your mind.

 Stadium, in the sculptured chair
 Crowds of screaming fans stand all around you, reaching out toward the
 rock group playing on the centre stage.

 Harsh white spotlights converge on the lead singer, while smoke and
 lasers spell out the band's name: "Fleischman Tokamak."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The lead singer steps up to the hovering cam-bot, taps his implant
 mike, and begins.  "This one goes out to everyone who has ever logged
 into the cube in the morning, seen their own reflection... and wept.
 Biofeedback."  The crowd falls silent.

>sing along
 I don't know the word "sing".

>examine reflection
 I don't know the word "reflection".

>wait

 The band kicks up, a grating metallic beat that devours the singer's
 voice.

 "Bright annihilation

  to ever fly away"

 first two stanzas.

 "Biofeedback

>listen

 "Biofeedback

>wait
 Time passes...

 The musician does another lead break, roaming up and down the scale in
 five different tonal keys.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The singer steps forward, drops his voice to a whisper and speaks
 softly as if reading a nursery rhyme.

 "And we will walk on glowgrass lawns
  And we will sing electric storms
  And the mothers and the fathers
  of all our futures will be there
  And we will live without a care..."

>wait

 The band kicks into a screaming frenzy and ends on a crescendo cry.

 "Biofeedback!"

 The crowd goes wild, and the sound slowly fades out.

 Marie's projected image appears on the seat beside you.

 Marie flicks in and out of view for a few moments, then settles into a

 - presumably, the skycar has concealed visual pickups to give
 projected images the power of sight - and then nods.

 "Okay.  You've got the electrics running.  Now you need to give the
 drive some power.  That lever there is the main throttle - pull it to
 increase power and push to slacken off.  Steering could be a problem -
 I'll try to cut past the overrides and do it myself."

 Skycar, in vehicle dome
 The interior of the skycar is fairly cramped compared to a modern
 altiwing or dropship.  There's a control console directly in front of
 you, and a viewshield through which you can see the vehicle dome.  The
 exit hatch to your side is open; in the rear of the car is an access
 panel (currently open).  A green button on the console is glowing.

 "You did not say the password," says the electronic voice.  "For your

 There's a quiet click from the console.  The green button stops
 glowing.

 An electronic voice replies, "Thank you.  Your password is accepted."

>push sunburst
 There's a brief hum from the console, and the green button starts
 glowing.

 Marie's projected image appears on the seat beside you.

 Marie flicks in and out of view for a few moments, then settles into a
 sitting posture beside you.  She glances around the vehicle's interior
 - presumably, the skycar has concealed visual pickups to give
 projected images the power of sight - and then nods.

 "Okay.  You've got the electrics running.  Now you need to give the
 drive some power.  That lever there is the main throttle - pull it to
 increase power and push to slacken off.  Steering could be a problem -
 I'll try to cut past the overrides and do it myself."

 Seeing your expression, Marie grins.  "Why the surprise?  I'm a
 natural with cars.  You should have seen me fly this before...  when I
 was...  whatever.  Well, I'm okay now.  I'll be fine."

>un out of gas somewhere far from home
 I don't know the word "gas".

>examine coil
 It's a thin coil of some heavily corroded metal, about ten centimetres
 long and three across.

>examine box
 It's a small box made from some decay-resistant pressed fibre,
 possibly spun carbon or silicon.  A label reads "Surefire palladium
 ignitor coils, contents 6".  The white box is closed.

>ask marie about coil
 Marie shrugs, indicating either ignorance or unwillingness to answer.

 "Well, let's go!" says Marie.

>open box
 Opening the white box reveals a transparent bag.

 "Well, let's go!" says Marie.

>examine baf
 I don't know the word "baf".

>examine bafg
 I don't know the word "bafg".

>examine bag
 It's a small bag made from transparent polymer sheeting, about the
 size of your hand.  In the transparent bag you see a shiny metal coil.

>open bag
 Opened.

>get bad coil
 I don't know the word "bad".

>get old coil
 Taken.

>put new coil in panel
 You'll need to be more specific; there are several places to put
 things in the access panel.

 "Well, let's go!" says Marie.

>examine panel
 The access panel is open.  In the access panel you see a triangular
 hole, a power cell, and a round hole.

>put new coil in round hole
 The shiny metal coil screws neatly into the round hole.

>pull lever
 You pull the lever back one notch.  An electronic voice says "Please
 close the hatch before ignition."  The lever clicks forward again.

 "Duh," grins Marie.  "Better get that."

>clsoe door
 I don't know the word "clsoe".

>pull lever
 You pull the lever back one notch.  An electronic voice says "Please
 close the hatch before ignition."  The lever clicks forward again.

 "Duh," grins Marie.  "Better get that."

>close door
 The exit hatch swings closed.

 "Ready to go yet?"  asks Marie.

>pull lever
 You pull the lever back one notch.  An electronic voice says "Please
 close the access panel before ignition."  The lever clicks forward
 again.

 "Duh," grins Marie.  "Better get that."

>close panel
 Closed.

>save
>cf6
 Saved.

>release parking break
 I don't know the word "release".

>pull lever
 You pull the lever back one notch.  The skycar's engine ignites with a
 deep vibrating hum.

 The skycar begins to lift into the air.

 Marie grins.  "Nice liftoff.  Now comes the tricky part.  Open up the
 throttle some more, and take us out of here - but be ready to hit it
 when I tell you.  I can't handle both steering and power at the same
 time.  I'm having enough trouble just computing myself as it is."

>SAVE
>cf7
 Saved.

>pull throttle
 You pull the lever back one notch.  The engine's hum increases to a
 whine.

 The skycar accelerates up and out to the southwest, grazing the edge
 of the vehicle dome's ceiling in a shower of sparks.

 Marie's image flickers.  "Sorry about that.  Okay, I've got it now.
 Watch out for the turn, I'm going to need full throttle in a moment."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The skycar skims through the courtyard, heading directly for the
 southern wall.

 "This is it!" shouts Marie, her hands flicking across the console.
 "Full throttle, now!"

>full throttle
 I don't know the word "full".

>pull throttle
 You pull the lever back one notch.  The engine's whine increases to a
 shriek.

 The skycar banks sharply to the south and east, pulling hard into a
 near-vertical turn across the glowgrass lawn.  Through the viewshield,
 you see the pool and vehicle dome, tilted at a freakish angle.

 "Excellent!" shouts Marie.  "I didn't think we were going to make that
 one.  Okay, slacken back a bit and I'll try to staighten us up."

>push throttle
 You push the lever forward one notch.  The engine's shriek decreases
 to a whine.

 The skycar levels out into a gentle climbing arc, rising out of the
 small valley that shelters the ruins of Marie's house.  The vehicle
 sways uneasily in the slipstream winds.

 "Better slacken up," says Marie, concentrating on the console.  "I
 can't get through these crosswinds any faster."

>push throttle
 You push the lever forward one notch.  The engine's whine decreases to
 a hum.

 "That's fine," says Marie.  "Hold it like that."

>open door
 An electronic voice says, "For your comfort and safety, the hatch will
 not open while the vehicle is in motion."

 The skycar continues to follow the valley's curve, gradually heading
 towards a forested ridge.  Below, you get a clear view of the jungle:
 tall green palms with leafy fronds, clustering thornbushes, strange
 contorted ferns.  All of them glowing, a soft pale green.

 Marie looks down at the jungle, wonderingly.  "This was a city," she
 breathes.  "All this was city.  Suburbs, housing estates, skycars,
 towers...  all gone.  I don't believe it."  She turns away, as if
 unwilling to reveal any more emotion.

>push save
 I don't understand that sentence.

>SAVE
>cf8
 Saved.

>take yellow
 You already have the yellow disk!

 The skycar reaches the end of the valley, approaching the ridge.  To
 the west, the sun is sinking behind the mountains; golden light gives
 everything a dreamlike aura, like one single fading moment of
 innocence.

 Marie takes one last look back at the valley, as if fixing it in her
 mind.

>ask her about city
 [But you don't know anything worth mentioning about any city yet.]

>take green
 Taken.

 Marie's image vanishes.

 The skycar falters, losing height.

 Skycar, in the air
 The interior of the skycar is fairly cramped compared to a modern
 altiwing or dropship.  There's a control console directly in front of
 you, and a viewshield through which you can see the jungle below.  The
 exit hatch to your side is closed; in the rear of the car is an access
 panel (currently closed).  A green button on the console is glowing.

 You see a Frisbee Helipta, a white vat, and a magprobe here.

 Marie's projected image sits on the seat beside you, watching the
 console.

>make out
 I don't know the word "make".

>kiss marie
 Marie kisses you briefly on the lips.  "Mmmm," she says, "But I don't
 have the processor power for this right now.  And besides, you don't
 want me.  You want a girl who's alive."

 The skycar tops the ridge and breaks through into a scene of
 devastation.  A smouldering crater, carved out of the jungle by the
 doomed dropship's crash.  There's no wreckage; a turbine implosion
 never leaves more than scattered plasma.  You watch silently as the
 crater passes by beneath.  If your team were lucky, they had a few
 seconds to activate the escape wormhole, and make their own way home.
 If not...

 Marie looks over at you, her face gentle.  "So, it was true.  You had
 friends too."  She looks back at the console for a moment, then at
 you.  "Lost?  Or...  no.  There's still hope, isn't there?"

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

 The skycar leaves the crater, passing over a sheer cliff - recently
 fractured by the dropship's blast wave - into a river valley that
 winds its way out towards more familiar territory.  The setting sun
 slowly drops out of sight, leaving a trail of soft green light as the
 glowgrass jungle switches on its full bioluminescence.  Bright moving
 dots mark the passage of birds and predators.  You hope Marie doesn't
 ask about the taller ones; or notice the drop of greenish, sparkling,
 blood oozing from the tiny cut on your arm.  Tommorow will be time
 enough for everything.

 "Hope," continues Marie, quietly, watching the jungle swallow the
 night.  "Yes. I guess that's all any of us has."

 You nod, silently.  There doesn't seem anything else to say.

 A projected image of a rainforest appears on the seat beside you.

 Helplessly out of control, the skycar plunges down into the jungle.

 Trapped in the wreckage, you desperately race to free yourself, but
 it's too late.  The car's electrics die, sending a last surge of
 unregulated power through the fusion ignitors.  Everything within a
 thirty metre radius explodes.

 The recovery team, six months later, finds no trace of your body.  Had
 you lived, you would have warned them to may more attention to

 The electrics die; fusion ignitors spark in a final unregulated surge
