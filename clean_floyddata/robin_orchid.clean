 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.




 Casey glances around the newspaper office. "Orchid is gone, right?"

 "Yes, she left. Why do you ask?"

 "I wanted to give you this while she wasn't around." He hands you a
 thick, well-leafed notebook. "It's just kind of a guide kind of thing,
 with some general information and directions, just to help you get
 around. Don't let Orchid see it."

 "Are you sure I'll require so much background material? And why
 shouldn't Orchid see it?"

 "Well, Robin," Casey says, and he spins around a chair to sit on it
 backwards in what he surely thinks is a very casual and friendly pose,
 "Orchid is a church member, and you're not, and you missed the lock-in,
 so you don't have a lot of the context that Orchid has. I just wanted
 to put you on an even footing. And for your second question, I might
 have written some things in there that I wouldn't have said to Orchid's
 face."

 You nod, and slip the notebook into your backpack. "I'm sure you've
 adequately prepared me for my mission."

 "Yes, I have. You're welcome. No, wait, I've got one more thing to say.
 Make sure you take lots of pictures, obviously. It's your job. That's
 one." He starts counting on his fingers. "Um, it's more fun if you run
 off by yourself, so make sure you get Sharon off your back. That's two.
 And keep an open mind. I mean, just because you don't believe in ghosts
 doesn't mean you're not gonna see one.

 "So, yeah. That's three things."

 Robin & Orchid
 An exercise in photojournalism by Ryan Veeder & Emily Boegheim
 Release 3 / Serial number 131027 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Nursery
 Sharon, in her wisdom, decided that everybody should sleep in this
 cramped corner of the church basement.

 Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up
 in a corner of the room. Cupboards are mounted high on the walls, out
 of reach of tiny fingers, and an enormous blue recliner sits underneath
 them. It's already dark outside, and the doors west to the basement
 stairway and south are dark as well.

 Your sleeping bag is lying on a tidy patch of floor, ready for when you
 finish your investigation.

 Orchid is lounging around, lecturing you.

 "You'd better hold onto this," she says, handing you the camera,
 "you're the official photographer. Just don't forget, if you see
 something that might be evidence of a ghost, make sure you take a photo
 of it."

 You slip the camera strap around your neck.

>inventory
   Casey's notes
   a Polaroid camera (being worn)

 Orchid notices your notebook. "What's all that?" she asks.

 "Oh, Casey gave it to me. It's just some notes about things in the
 church."

 "Is there anything about me in there?"

 "I don't think so," you lie, and Orchid loses interest.

>examine me
 West High Warbler. You are not overly fond of churches, and you have
 never claimed to believe in ghosts, but here you are.

 "Oh, and," Orchid adds, "don't turn the lights on while you're looking
 around unless you have to. Some ghosts won't appear unless it's dark,
 and we've only got tonight to gather all our evidence."

>take a photo of orchid
 You snap a picture of Orchid. The camera whirrs and vibrates and
 eventually spits out a print of the photo.

 Sharon stomps into the nursery. "There are supposed to be some blankets
 somewhere in this nursery," she says. "Robin, can you find them and
 grab them for me?" She looks thoughtfully at the child-sized cots
 scattered around the room.

>examine sharon
 High Warbler. In the past the staff has always managed quite well
 without a student teacher, but she does come in handy as a chaperone
 for situations like this.

 "Okay, girls," she says. "Here's how this is going to work."

>examine orchid
 covered in freckles that you had never seen before tonight; she must
 put makeup on over them for school. You have the uneasy feeling that
 there are more freckles on her left cheek than her right.

 She notices you examining her, and you look away.

 Sharon continues, "This is your story and your investigation, so don't
 expect me to be running around the church with you all night." She
 pushes one of the cots up against the wall.

>read notebook surreptitiously

>read notebook
 like it's nearly full. Surely Casey didn't make notes about everything
 in the church? How long did he spend on this anyway?

 There's way too much information here to sit down and read it all at
 once, but you can look up anything you want to know about.

 Sharon pulls another of the cots toward her and lines it up with the
 first one. "I don't care if you stay up all night, tomorrow isn't a
 school day so it's not my problem if you're exhausted. Personally, I
 want my eight hours, though."

>count freckles

>lookup ghosts

>look up ghosts
 [This action may cause some slight lag in the browser version of this
 game. We sincerely regret any inconvenience.]

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 don't know how much you already know about the ghost in the church so
 I'll give you the whole story. Jennie Bancroft is the name of the ghost
 that haunts Grace United Methodist. She used to be alive, but then she
 died, in or around the church, sometime in the distant past. I keep
 meaning to look up when she died but I haven't had time.

 "When people see her, she looks like a teenage girl in pigtails. I
 don't think she shows up covered in blood or anything like that; she's
 just a sad girl. Obviously a lot of the time she's invisible though.

 "Some of the evidence that we have for her existence includes:

 - sounds of footsteps and a girl crying when nobody else is in the
 church
 - cold spots in rooms, rooms that suddenly become cold for no reason
 - stuff goes missing, then shows up again
 - you see someone at the end of the hallway but when you get to the end
 of the hallway there's nobody there
 - basically everybody has seen her out of the corner of their eye at
 some point

 "Debate continues on the subject of how Jennie died. Popular theories
 state that she jumped off of the church steeple, or she drank poison,
 or used a space heater to carbon monoxide herself. According to one
 explanation she died accidentally, because she was using a Ouija board,
 but that theory is idiotic. Jennie Bancroft definitely committed
 suicide, and it was definitely because of a boy she was in love with."

 Sharon continues, "So I'm going to stay here and sleep, and you two are
 going to get on with your investigating, and not wake me up unless
 there's a life-threatening emergency or something."

>look up casey
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "Dear
 Robin. I am Casey, your friend. I am writing to you from the past. Back
 here in the past it is very dark, but we have hope that you, in the
 future, will be able to rekindle the flame of enlightenment and lead us
 to wisdom. Have you seen a ghost yet? If you haven't seen a ghost, keep
 looking around until you do. Thanks. Sincerely, Casey."

 "Orchid, pass me that cot in the corner, will you?" Sharon asks.

 Orchid pulls a face but goes to get it.

>examine cot
 frame, and there is no way any of them could be very comfortable.

 "Just don't complain to me when you've spent the whole night
 ghost-hunting and have nothing to show for it. Thanks, Orchid." Sharon
 pushes the last cot into place alongside the other two and frowns at
 the result.

>pull face

>look up orchid
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Here's an anecdote about Orchid. This happened just recently. I didn't
 tell you, because I wanted to save it for here. Okay:

 "I'm at school after hours because of rehearsals. But we're still in
 the fairly lazy stage of the production, so there's lots of time to
 just goof off around the school. So while the underclassmen are sitting
 around in the hall running lines, I head up to the drama office,
 because there are donuts there.

 "But Orchid and Aiden Kingsley are already up in the office, and as
 soon as I poke my head in Orchid looks up and says 'Actors only,
 please!' and I'm like 'Actually, I am an actor,' and she says, 'Well,
 you know what I mean.'

 "No, Orchid! I do not have the slightest idea what you mean. I would
 have just grabbed a donut and left, but you're not allowed to take the
 donuts out of the drama office, so I just left.

 "I wouldn't say I hate Orchid. Hate is a very strong word. I completely
 hate Aiden, though."

 Sharon unrolls a thin mattress on top of the cots. "I expect the West
 High Warbler can find some other story to run if this one doesn't work
 out. It'll be a nuisance, though."

>look up Aiden
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 guess you've probably seen Aiden in plays, but I've actually worked
 with him, so I know what I'm talking about. He is unbearable. You
 should be able to guess from the mustache.

 "Aiden goes to parties, gets girls drunk, makes out with them, and then
 convinces them that his number is '123-4567'. And then he tells this
 story to everyone at rehearsal and expects us to laugh.

 "Speaking of which. This is the worst thing Aiden does: He laughs at
 every single one of his own jokessometimes just at sentences he says
 that can't even be considered jokesand it's always the same
 single-syllable laugh, always the same pitch, pronounced exactly the
 same way. It's not really a laugh, it's more of a signal that you're
 supposed to think he's funny.

 "Aiden doesn't even go to my church, but he's the worst, and I think
 you should know that."

 "Have you found the blankets yet?" Sharon asks.

 You shake your head.

 "They must be in one of these cupboards. Somewhere." She looks up at
 them and sighs. Sharon is barely taller than you, and she obviously
 doesn't want to try to search the cupboards herself. "Someone from the
 church would know."

 "Don't look at me," Orchid says.

>goals

>search cupboards
 top shelves from here, much less reach them. Surely there's a better
 way to find out where the blankets are kept than just hunting through
 everything.

>hunt through everything

>look up sharon in book

>look up sharon in notebook
 do people like Sharon want to become teachers? (By 'people like Sharon'
 I mean 'people who obviously hate everything about teaching, even and
 especially students'.) If you're already completely jaded and cynical
 after your first semester of student teaching, isn't that a sign that
 you should give up on K-12 education and possibly on life in general?"

>look up blankets
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "What
 I heard is that you guys are going to sleep in the nursery, which
 doesn't make sense because there are couches in the youth rooms, but I
 guess those couches are pretty grody actually. I see your point. They
 keep some blankets up in the cupboards, but somebody as short as you is
 probably going to have to climb up on top of the recliner to reach
 them. No offense, Robin. I'm just saying. You're really short."

 Sharon, in her wisdom, decided that everybody should sleep in this

 in a corner of the room. Cupboards are mounted high on the walls, out
 of reach of tiny fingers, and an enormous blue recliner sits

 "you're the official photographer. Just don't forget, if you see
 something that might be evidence of a ghost, make sure you take a
 photo of it."

 You slip the camera strap around your neck.

>examine recliner

 The armchair is covered in lumpy blue corduroy. At least it's clean.

 Orchid notices your notebook. "What's all that?" she asks.

 "Oh, Casey gave it to me. It's just some notes about things in the
 church."

 "Is there anything about me in there?"

 "I don't think so," you lie, and Orchid loses interest.

>climb on recliner

 You step up onto the seat of the recliner, adding at least a foot to
 your height.

 "Oh, and," Orchid adds, "don't turn the lights on while you're looking
 around unless you have to. Some ghosts won't appear unless it's dark,
 and we've only got tonight to gather all our evidence."

>examine cupboards

 The nursery cupboards are numerous and mounted high up on the walls,
 presumably so the kids can't get into them.

 Sharon stomps into the nursery. "There are supposed to be some
 blankets somewhere in this nursery," she says. "Robin, can you find
 them and grab them for me?" She looks thoughtfully at the child-sized
 cots scattered around the room.

>orchid, inventory

 Sharon talks over you, drowning you out.

 "Okay, girls," Sharon says. "Here's how this is going to work."

>open cupboards

 It takes some hunting to find them, but there are the blankets, up on
 the top shelf.

 Sharon continues, "This is your story and your investigation, so don't
 expect me to be running around the church with you all night." She
 pushes one of the cots up against the wall.

>get blankets

 Taken.

 Sharon pulls another of the cots toward her and lines it up with the
 first one. "I don't care if you stay up all night, tomorrow isn't a
 school day so it's not my problem if you're exhausted. Personally, I
 want my eight hours, though."

>#clubf should we be seeing status lines?

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine blankets

 The blankets are small, thin, and colorful. Probably they're designed
 for making kids' afternoon naps fun, not for actually sleeping under.

 Sharon continues, "So I'm going to stay here and sleep, and you two
 are going to get on with your investigating, and not wake me up unless
 there's a life-threatening emergency or something."

>give blankets to sharon

 Sharon takes the pile of blankets from you. "Thanks, Robin," she says.

 "Orchid, pass me that cot in the corner, will you?" Sharon asks.

 Orchid pulls a face but goes to get it.

>examine toys

 Toy cars, a lot of wooden blocks, a tea set, that kind of thing. It
 looks like someone tried to take a bite out of one of the blocks.

 "Just don't complain to me when you've spent the whole night
 ghost-hunting and have nothing to show for it. Thanks, Orchid." Sharon
 pushes the last cot into place alongside the other two and frowns at

 doesn't work out. It'll be a nuisance, though."

>exits

 From here, you could head south and west to the basement stairway.

 Sharon looks at the makeshift cot bed and purses her lips. "I guess
 that'll do," she says.

 Suddenly Orchid gasps and grabs your arm. "Someone's outside!" she
 squeaks, pointing at the window.

 Behind the glass, you see a pale face, blurry in the dim light.

>take photo of face

 (with the Polaroid camera)
 The click of the shutter sounds loud in the silence and seems to
 startle the creature outside the window. It turns and vanishes out of
 the light, its tail flicking past the glass. Orchid gives a
 high-pitched giggle.

 "Scared of a cat!" Sharon says. "You better not freak out and wake me
 up every time you mistake a shadow for a ghost tonight."

>examine photo

 It's the photo you took of the cat looking in through the window. How
 did you ever think it was a person? It's much too small and pale to be
 anything human. Although outside the window, obscured by the glass, it
 did look pretty ghostly.

 Orchid peeks over your shoulder at the photo you took. "Hey, that's
 good!" she says. "I guess you can see how it's a cat now, but it
 looked really spooky, didn't it?"

>examine photograph

 It's the photo you took of the cat looking in through the window. How
 did you ever think it was a person? It's much too small and pale to be

 Sharon yawns. "Right, I'm going to bed now. Keep out of trouble, don't
 break anything, and don't wake me up unless it's <span class="floydstyle em">really,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> serious, got it?" Without waiting for an answer, she lies
 down on the row of cots, facing away from you, and pulls the blankets
 over herself.

 Orchid says, "We'd better get started. How about this: you check out
 the basement, and I'll go upstairs and look around there, and then
 we'll meet up and compare notes. Don't forget to take a photo if you
 find any evidence of a ghost!" She slips out of the room. A moment
 later, you hear her footsteps echoing in the stairwell as she heads
 back up to the main floor.

>tell sharon about couches

 On second thoughts, maybe what you wanted to say isn't urgent enough
 to brave Sharon's wrath at being woken.

>go south

 (first getting off the recliner)
 You switch the lights on in the next room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Youth Room</span>
 A large part of this room is taken up by a rickety ping pong table.
 Couches line the edges of the room, some of them close enough to the
 table that they're probably not safe to sit on if someone is actually
 playing ping pong. On the other hand, you can't see any ping pong bats
 anywhere, so maybe that's not an issue. In between the couches, doors
 lead north to the nursery, west, and south.

 A garish golden trophy catches your eye.

 A trolley with an ancient TV and a Super Nintendo on it is standing in
 front of one of the couches.

>examine trophy

 The figurine on top is a generic gold-painted plastic person raising
 its arms in victory. The text at the bottom reads: "BIBLE QUIZ
 TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONS".

 Ryan Veeder and Emily Boegheim began work on <span class="floydstyle em">Robin & Orchid</span>
 in July of 2012. Their original intention was to enter it in the 2012
 Interactive Fiction Competition. Then their intention was to enter it
 in the 2013 Spring Thing. If you're reading this, that means they have
 successfully entered it in the 2013 Interactive Fiction Competition.

 An adaptive walkthrough has been built into the game; you can enter
 the command "WALKTHROUGH" to get some directions if you're stuck.
 Something might also happen if you try "HINT".

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 don't even know what Bubsy is about. A squirrel? It doesn't even have
 a proper two-player mode. You have to wait and watch the other guy
 play. It's bad for the group. I miss Tetris Attack."

>push trolley west

 You turn the lights off in the youth room and switch the lights on in
 the next room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
 This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
 like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
 altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
 doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
 west.

 On the small table are a small white cross and a bird cage.

>examine cage

 The curving faux-wrought-iron bars and caked-on "rust" identify this
 as one of the non-functioning, overpriced decorations which are so
 popular in craft stores. What does a Sunday School need with a bird
 cage?

>look up cage

 (the bird cage)
 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Can't really tell you what the Sunday School bird cage is for; it
 showed up after I graduated. I think it might have something to do
 with like, Old Testament animal sacrifices? Back when you had to give
 the priest two of your doves instead of just praying for forgiveness?"

>take photo of cage

 You snap a picture of the bird cage. The camera whirrs and vibrates
 and eventually spits out a print of the photo.

>examine photo of me

 It turns out it's not that easy taking a photo of yourself with a

 if it's because you weren't holding the camera still, or because it
 was too close to your face.

>take better photo of me

 altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
 doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
 west.

 The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.

>examine poster

 The Ten Commandments are retold here by little cartoon children, in
 language appropriate to the target demographic: "Thou shalt not covet
 thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife,"
 etc., becomes "Don't be jealous of what other people have."

 As rusty as you are in this area, you can't remember which commandment
 is the one about adultery. It must be the seventh one, which is
 translated here as "Be faithful and loyal."

>examine altar

 As altars go, it is fairly tacky: sponge-painted to simulate age,
 draped with an excessively ornate doily.

>look under doily

 You find nothing of interest.

>take doily

 That's hardly portable.

>go west

 You turn the lights off in the Sunday School room.

 You flick the hallway light switch on, but nothing happens. In the
 end, you turn the Sunday School room lights back on so you can see
 what you're doing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway runs north into darkness. It's hard to tell how long it
 might be from here, though the Sunday School room to the east provides
 some light at this end. A huge figure looms out of the shadows—no,
 wait, it's just a plywood image of a lighthouse. Behind the lighthouse
 and partially obscured by it is a mural of Jesus blessing the little
 children.

 A movement catches your eye. Some tiny lights seem to be floating at
 the far end of the hall, flickering occasionally.

>hello doily

 I only understood you as far as wanting to hello.

>take photo of lights

 (the flickering lights with the Polaroid camera)
 You snap a picture of the flickering lights. The camera whirrs and
 vibrates and eventually spits out a print of the photo.

>examine photo of lights

 Blue lights trail across the photograph, bright against the darkness
 of the hallway.

>hello sailor

 I only understood you as far as wanting to hello.

 The lights float across the ceiling like rings of blue smoke, blinking
 in and out to a frantic, inaudible rhythm.

>examine mural

 Which do you mean, the little children or Jesus?

>examine jesus

 As is traditional, Jesus is depicted with very long hair, a white robe
 and a beatific smile.

>examine little children

 Happy little children of various ethnic backgrounds are crowded around
 Jesus.

>examine lighthouse

 The piece of plywood is about eight feet tall and an inch thick. A
 minimum of detail has been painted on to convey that this tapered
 rectangle is supposed to be a lighthouse. There are no supports; it's
 just propped up against the wall.

>look behind lighthouse

 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>move lighthouse

 You get the feeling that if you tried to move this thing anywhere, it
 would fall on top of you and snap in half.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway runs north into darkness. It's hard to tell how long it
 might be from here, though the Sunday School room to the east provides
 some light at this end. The plywood lighthouse, on the other hand,
 peacefully fails to provide any light. Behind the lighthouse and
 partially obscured by it is a mural of Jesus blessing the little
 children.

 A movement catches your eye. Some tiny lights seem to be floating at
 the far end of the hall, flickering occasionally.

>push lighthouse

 You get the feeling that if you tried to move this thing anywhere, it
 would fall on top of you and snap in half.

>slide lighthouse

 You get the feeling that if you tried to move this thing anywhere, it
 would fall on top of you and snap in half.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The tiny lights to the north continue to drift aimlessly. Thanks to
 the light filtering in from the south end of the hall, you can make
 out some kind of mural painted on the wall, but you can't tell what
 it's supposed to represent in the gloom.

>examine mural

 Which do you mean, the swathe of yellow, the indistinct smear, or the
 bluish blob?

>examine yellow

 It's too dark here to make out any details.

>touch yellow

 You feel nothing unexpected.

>photograph mural

 Which do you mean, the swathe of yellow, the indistinct smear, or the
 bluish blob?

 The camera hums and drops an indistinct photograph into your hand.

>examine photo of blob

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine blob

 Which do you mean, the photo of the cat looking through the window,
 the photo of the bird cage, the photo of you taking a photo of
 yourself, the photo of the flickering lights, or the photo of
 darkness?

>examine photo of darkness

 It's too dark here to make out any details.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The flickering lights are only a little way to the north now.
 Otherwise, it's almost completely dark. At least you can still see the
 light at the south end of the hallway. The rectangles to the east and
 west must be doorways to somewhere, but they're barely distinguishable
 from the walls.

>look up flash

 (looking up "flash" in Casey's notes)
 There isn't enough light for you to read Casey's notes here.

 (first opening the west storage room door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

 As you approach the lights, they flicker one more time and vanish,
 leaving you in complete darkness.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing except for the dim light
 trickling in from the south end of the hallway.

>go north

 It's too dark to see where you're going. A dim light from the south
 end of the hallway shows you the way back, but if you wander around at
 random you're probably just going to walk into walls.

>go south

 You run a hand along the wall to help you find your way, and your
 fingers trail through something cold and slimy. Ugh, now it's on your
 hand.

 The cat is sitting in the middle of the room, staring at you.

 You're still on the other side of the room when the cat scampers off
 to the east.

>examine ectoplasm

 The ectoplasm is pale gray, thick and gooey.

>taste it

 How do ghosts produce ectoplasm anyway? You're not sure it's something
 you want to put in your mouth.

 Your fingers itch where the ectoplasm is clinging to them.

>smell it

 The ectoplasm smells bitter and unnatural.

 You're about to adjust the camera strap around your neck, but catch
 yourself just before you smear the ectoplasm on it.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   some ectoplasm (stuck to your fingers)
   a bird cage
   a small white cross
   a stack of photos
   Casey's notes
   a Polaroid camera (being worn)

>drop ectoplasm

 It clings to your fingers stubbornly.

>wipe ectoplasm

 There's nowhere to wash your hands here. You're briefly tempted to
 wipe the goo off on your jeans, but catch yourself in time.

>wipe hands

 There's nowhere to wash your hands here.

>go west

 From here, you could head north to more hallway and east to the Sunday
 School room.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
 This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
 like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
 altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
 doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
 west to the hallway.

 The cat is sitting in the middle of the room, staring at you.

 The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.

>examine cat

 The cat is almost completely white, except for a small black spot on
 the end of its tail. When it sees you looking at it, it narrows its
 pale blue eyes at you.

 The cat wanders off to the north, glancing back at you as if to check
 whether you're following.

>look up bathroom

 Which do you mean, men's restroom or ladies' restroom?

>look up ladies' restroom

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Well, Robin. I actually explored the ladies' restroom briefly, during
 a game of Sardines. But then, because of events that transpired, the
 ladies' restroom was declared to be off-limits. And shortly after
 that, because of fairness, the men's restroom was declared to be
 off-limits as well. For Sardines purposes at least."

>look up sardines

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Sardines is this awesome game we Christian Youth play instead of
 Romans and Christians now. In Sardines, a person hides somewhere and
 then everyone else looks for that person and when you find them you
 have to get in the hiding place and hide with them. It is fantastic.
 It's a lot less hectic than Romans and Christians."

>look up romans and christians

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Romans and Christians is the game we used to play at church. The
 rules were, you had two Romans, and everyone else was the Christians,
 and the Christians just ran around the church in the dark while the
 Romans tried to catch them and take them to the Jail, which was a
 couch. If there are any other rules then I'm forgetting them.

 "The excitement of being actively chased around the church caused a
 lot of Christians to kinda lose their heads and occasionally break
 stuff, so we started playing Sardines instead."

>look up lions

 (looking up "lions" in Casey's notes)
 You riffle through the notes, but you can't find anything that seems
 relevant.

>look up mural

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 volunteered to paint a mural in the basement, and Patrick the youth
 leader gave me permission, so I painted a mural of the Four Beasts
 (the man and the lion and the ox and the eagle) and it was a GREAT
 MURAL but once they saw it they went ahead and covered it up with
 JONAH."

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "The
 lighthouse symbolizes how the church is a beacon of guidance to the
 rest of the world. I don't mean my church specifically, I mean all of
 Christianity. Or at least Methodists."

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Youth Room</span>
 A large part of this room is taken up by a rickety ping pong table.
 Couches line the edges of the room, some of them close enough to the
 table that they're probably not safe to sit on if someone is actually
 playing ping pong. On the other hand, you can't see any ping pong bats
 anywhere, so maybe that's not an issue. In between the couches, doors
 lead north to the nursery, west to the Sunday School room, and south.

 A garish golden trophy catches your eye.

>go south

 You turn the lights off in the youth room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Black Light Room</span>
 You flip the light switch, but the only things that light up are your
 shirt and your socks.

 The black walls in here have been painted with Bible verses that glow
 underneath the UV lights. The couches are glowing, too; unsettlingly
 green. The door to the north, on the other hand, is barely visible.

 Propped up in one corner is a rough wooden cross.

>examine ectoplasm

 The ectoplasm is pale gray, thick and gooey.

>examine cross

 (the small white cross)
 This is a nice little cross for a table. Nothing fancy.

>c wooden cross

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine wooden cross

 You have to guess that whoever constructed this cross purposefully
 chose the roughest, most splintery lumber available.

 Around the center plank (which is twice as tall as you are), on top of
 the crossbar, is a "crown of thorns" made from rusty barbed wire.

>examine notes

 The notebook is thick, and as you flick through the pages, it looks
 like it's nearly full. Surely Casey didn't make notes about
 <span class="floydstyle em">everything</span> in the church? How long did he spend on this
 anyway?

 There's way too much information here to sit down and read it all at
 once, but you can look up anything you want to know about.

>look up jonah

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I

>look up patrick

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Patrick the youth leader is Grace's youth leader currently. In the
 distant past there was a different, previous youth leader, but we
 don't talk about her.

 "Actually, I'm looking over the other notes I've written and it looks
 like I've probably said too much about Patrick the youth leader too."

>look up jennie

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 don't know how much you already know about the ghost in the church so
 I'll give you the whole story. Jennie Bancroft is the name of the
 ghost that haunts Grace United Methodist. She used to be alive, but
 then she died, in or around the church, sometime in the distant past.
 I keep meaning to look up when she died but I haven't had time.

 "When people see her, she looks like a teenage girl in pigtails. I
 don't think she shows up covered in blood or anything like that; she's
 just a sad girl. Obviously a lot of the time she's invisible though.

 "Some of the evidence that we have for her existence includes:

 - sounds of footsteps and a girl crying when nobody else is in the
 church
 - cold spots in rooms, rooms that suddenly become cold for no reason
 - stuff goes missing, then shows up again
 - you see someone at the end of the hallway but when you get to the
 end of the hallway there's nobody there
 - basically everybody has seen her out of the corner of their eye at
 some point

 "Debate continues on the subject of how Jennie died. Popular theories
 state that she jumped off of the church steeple, or she drank poison,
 or used a space heater to carbon monoxide herself. According to one
 explanation she died accidentally, because she was using a Ouija
 board, but that theory is idiotic. Jennie Bancroft definitely
 committed suicide, and it was definitely because of a boy she was in
 love with."

 You hold your gooey hand out, away from your body, so as not to get
 any ectoplasm on your clothes.

>go north

 You turn the lights off in the youth room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nursery</span>
 Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up
 in a corner of the room. Cupboards are mounted high on the walls, out
 of reach of tiny fingers, and an enormous blue recliner sits
 underneath them. It's already dark outside, and the doors west to the
 basement stairway and south to the youth room are dark as well.

 Your sleeping bag is lying on a tidy patch of floor, ready for when
 you finish your investigation.

 Sharon's makeshift bed doesn't look comfortable, but apparently she's

 You switch the lights on in the next room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement Stairway</span>
 This room is apparently just for show; there are no tables or chairs.
 A wide staircase runs up to the main floor of the church, and doorways
 lead east to the nursery, south to the Sunday School room and north.
 Mounted on the wall is a gigantic abstract painting.

>examine painting

 The piece is very pleasant, if not particularly interesting: the
 inoffensive greens and pinks could suggest river waters, or branches
 waving in the wind. Its size is probably its most impressive quality.

 Your fingers itch where the ectoplasm is clinging to them.

 You turn the lights off in the basement stairway and switch the lights

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boiler Room</span>
 All of a sudden you feel very claustrophobic. This must be a fairly

 the north, northeast and southeast; according to the plaques on them,
 they open onto the pastor's office, the men's restroom and the ladies'
 restroom respectively.

 A vast framed poster is hanging on the wall in between the restroom
 doors, and in the middle of the room, directly facing the poster, is a
 wooden bench.

>se

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ladies' Restroom</span>
 A restroom in a church is about the same as any other restroom. You

 "But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
 This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
 tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
 much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
 stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.

 One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.

>look up office

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "You
 used to be able to get into the pastor's office all the time, back
 when Patrick the youth leader had his own sub-office at one end of the
 room where he had free candy. But that was a security risk apparently,
 so they locked up the pastor's office and Patrick the youth leader had
 to move his office to his truck."

>examine model

 It can't be a model of this church; it's the wrong shape. There's an
 incredible level of detail, though, from the tiles in the roof to the
 tiny people on the sidewalk. The double doors in front are open, and
 you can barely make out the shapes of little pews inside.

 and the model ended up in our church. It's kind of a creepy object,
 though. The guy who made it was clearly way too obsessed with his
 church."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The church kitchen contains much the same kind of thing as any
 kitchen, only more so. Long countertops line the walls, with cupboards
 and drawers underneath them. A break in the counters allows you to
 leave the kitchen via the door to the west, and on the far side of the
 room a sink is set into the counter.

 A sturdy box is sitting on the floor in the corner, with some cans in
 it.

 Somebody forgot to put away an empty jam jar.

 An old label on the box says "Navel Oranges", but someone has written
 "FOOD BANK" over that. Apparently they thought they'd need a good
 sturdy crate for all the Food Bank donations they'd get.

 On the subject of canned food Casey writes, "I'm pretty sure the

 Stolen.

>open drawers

 You pull open a random drawer for a moment, revealing an assortment of
 dish towels.

>score

 There is no score in this story.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The church kitchen contains much the same kind of thing as any
 kitchen, only more so. Long countertops line the walls, with cupboards
 and drawers underneath them. A break in the counters allows you to
 leave the kitchen via the door to the west, and on the far side of the
 room a sink is set into the counter.

>examine sink

 It's a big sink, capable of handling the influx of dirty dishes that
 church functions undoubtedly generate.

>likelihood of going to heaven

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>wash jar

 You don't have anything to clean the empty jam jar with.

>turn on faucet

 You can't see any dirt on your hands, but you wash them just in case.

>examine jar

 The jar has lost its lid, but it appears to be clean and sterile
 anyway.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
 This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
 tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
 much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
 stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.

 One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
 The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
 welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
 large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
 is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.

 To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
 obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
 south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.

>examine bible

 The Bible is obviously a well-respected object around here, but it's
 not a mere display piece; the pages have been creased and scuffed by
 continuous use.

>read it

 The Bible is obviously a well-respected object around here, but it's
 not a mere display piece; the pages have been creased and scuffed by

>examine tags

 There must be a name tag on here for everybody who's ever set foot in
 this church. There's Casey's, and there's Orchid's, and this one says
 "Robin"—but they must mean some other Robin.

>examine patrick

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine patrick's tag

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine jennie's tag

 You can't see any such thing.

>look up tags

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "When the new pastor came, he insisted that everybody wear name tags
 all the time, but that didn't last long. Name tags are a pain."

>get bible

 You feel it would be disrespectful to remove the Bible from its
 podium.

>open bible

 It's already open.

>read bible

 The Bible is obviously a well-respected object around here, but it's
 not a mere display piece; the pages have been creased and scuffed by
 continuous use.

>turn page

 You flip aimlessly through the book, and eventually your gaze lands on
 a passage: "Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the
 power to interpret. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my
 mind is unproductive."

>turn page

 You flip aimlessly through the book, and eventually your gaze lands on
 a passage: "But there are also many other things that Jesus did; if
 every one of them were written down, I suppose that the world itself
 could not contain the books that would be written."

>wear tag

 (first taking the name tag)
 You pull the name tag labeled "Robin" off of the board, even though it
 couldn't possibly be for you.

 You pin the name tag on.

>get pamphlet

 You won't let yourself give any of this material a closer look.

>read it

 One pamphlet is titled "Meaningful Relationships?".

>Maybe he braided everyone's hair, and the braids were in another language of knots, so every head of hair was a sentence in a story.
 LANGUAGE OF KNOTS, SO EVERY HEAD OF HAIR WAS A SENTENCE IN A STORY.

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>read pamphlets

 "Please Take One!" reads the cursive text at the bottom of the rack,
 but none of the pamphlets succeeds in engaging your curiosity. You've
 never been afflicted with any of the problems they purport to solve.

>examine jesus's tag

 You can't see any such thing.

>look up jesus

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 volunteered to paint a mural in the basement, and Patrick the youth
 leader gave me permission, so I painted a mural of the Four Beasts
 (the man and the lion and the ox and the eagle) and it was a GREAT
 MURAL but once they saw it they went ahead and covered it up with
 JONAH."

>examine orchid's tag

 You can't see any such thing.

>search tags for robin

 I only understood you as far as wanting to search the board full of
 name tags.

>search tags

 There is nothing on the board full of name tags.

 The plastic stems and silk blossoms are obviously artificial, but that
 hasn't stopped someone from trying to water them recently.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
 This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
 huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
 by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.

 Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
 room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.

 It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
 lifeless. Orchid hasn't turned the lights on either; you can barely
 make out anything in the gloom.

 Orchid comes over to meet you. "I didn't find anything up here," she
 says, "how about you?"

>show photo of lights to orchid

 Her eyes widen at the photo of the flickering lights. "Wow, Robin,"
 she says, "that's great, good work! That definitely looks paranormal
 to me."

 Before you can say any more, Orchid gasps and points upwards.
 Something is floating near the ceiling, glowing faintly—a pale figure
 in a wispy dress.

>take photo of figure

 (with the Polaroid camera)
 You snap a picture of the ghostly figure. The camera whirrs and
 vibrates and eventually spits out a print of the photo.

 The ghostly figure hovers silently in the air.

>examine figure

 The glowing figure is wearing a pale dress and her hair is in
 pigtails, just like Casey said. You can't make out the expression on
 her face, but she's holding her hands out as if she's reaching for
 something or asking for something.

 The figure drifts towards the ground and glides northward towards the
 altar.

>examine photo of figure

 It's too dark here to make out any details.

 Orchid hisses, "What are you waiting around for? Get some more photos
 of the ghost!"

 The figure drifts northwards through a small door behind the altar.

>take photo of figure

 You can't see any such thing.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit,
 the altar, and the American and Christian flags. Behind them, to the
 north, is a tiny doorway.

 On the altar are two candles.

 A large cross hangs high on the wall above the altar.

>go north

 You catch just a glimpse of the ghost in the darkness before it floats
 towards the back wall and vanishes. When you switch the light on, the
 room is empty.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Room</span>
 This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are
 covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and
 windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a
 closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the
 altar to the south.

 A stack of hymnals is crammed into one corner.

 Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor.

 You are carrying:
   a name tag (being worn)
   a can of tuna
   a can opener
   an empty jam jar

>get ectoplasm with jar

 You carefully scoop a sample of the ectoplasm into the jar.

>lick ectoplasm

 You touch the ectoplasm gingerly with the tip of your tongue. The
 bitter tang makes you gag.

>examine ectoplasm

 The ectoplasm is pale gray, thick and gooey.

>eat ectoplasm

 (first taking the ectoplasm)
 You've already collected some ectoplasm.

>smell ectoplasm

 The ectoplasm smells bitter and unnatural.

 You prod the ectoplasm gingerly, then rub it between your fingers.

 You pull yourself out of the box.

>close chest

 You close the huge wooden chest.

>examine panels

 Looking closely at the walls, you realise that one of the panels on
 the wall is sitting slightly further forward than the others.

>open panel

 You're not quite sure how to open the panel, or even if it can be
 opened. You jiggle it experimentally and it shifts a little.

>push panel

 You press your palms against the panel, but it doesn't seem to move.

>pull panel

 You grab the edges of the panel and try to pull it towards you.

 Nothing much seems to happen at first, but then the panel shifts
 upward and slides to the side. Behind it a narrow tunnel leads
 downwards. You open and close the panel a few more times to make sure
 you know how it works, and then leave it open.

>get candles

 Without something to light them with, these candles are just sticks.
 Not worth carrying around.

>light them

 This dangerous act would achieve little.

>examine cross

 (the small white cross)
 This is a nice little cross for a table. Nothing fancy.

>examine large cross

 It must be fifteen feet from top to bottom. The wood is smooth, and
 the proportions are graceful. Aesthetically speaking, it is a very
 pleasant object.

 On the altar are two candles.

 Which do you mean, the American flag or the Christian flag?

>examine american

 Although it's lying furled against its post, you can easily tell that
 this is an American flag. This one has tassels around the edges, and
 an eagle figurine is perched at the top.

 You assume it's the Christian flag, because there's a red cross near
 the top, but you've never seen such a flag anywhere else.

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Here's an anecdote about Orchid. This happened just recently. I
 didn't tell you, because I wanted to save it for here. Okay:

 "I'm at school after hours because of rehearsals. But we're still in
 the fairly lazy stage of the production, so there's lots of time to
 just goof off around the school. So while the underclassmen are
 sitting around in the hall running lines, I head up to the drama
 office, because there are donuts there.

 "But Orchid and Aiden Kingsley are already up in the office, and as
 soon as I poke my head in Orchid looks up and says 'Actors only,
 please!' and I'm like 'Actually, I am an actor,' and she says, 'Well,
 you know what I mean.'

 "No, Orchid! I do not have the slightest idea what you mean. I would
 have just grabbed a donut and left, but you're not allowed to take the
 donuts out of the drama office, so I just left.

 "I wouldn't say I hate Orchid. Hate is a very strong word. I
 completely hate Aiden, though."

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 Standing here, you have a good view of the altar and most of the
 sanctuary. A low wall with a railing along the top prevents accidents,
 though it probably also obscures the view for anyone sitting on the
 balcony pews. A projector is mounted at one end of the pews, pointing
 down towards the front of the sanctuary. On the ceiling behind the

 some kind, and a narrow staircase leads back down to the sanctuary.

 A strong metal cage protects the projector from careless and/or

 There are only a few rows of pews up here, mounted on a series of

 "It sounds like you had quite the spooky evening!"

 Take a look at these," you say, handing Casey your photos.

 He points at the image of the flickering lights. "I imagine these were
 more impressive in motion."

 "How did you know they were moving?"

 "Well, they look kinda like lights from a party ball."

 You look at the picture again. He has a point.

 "And you collected some ectoplasm?"

 "Well, I collected this." You hand him the jar.

 "Looks like ectoplasm to me!"

 "Does it look like it could be anything else?"

 "Yeah, I guess. It could be..."

 "It could be anything."

 He lifts the photo of the floating girl. "Now, this photo looks like a
 ghost," he says, "but I mean, it also kind of looks like any number of
 fake ghost photos you see all over the place. Not that I don't believe
 it was a real ghost, but other people might not find it so
 convincing." He tries to smile.

 He sighs. "So, what are you thinking?"

 "I think I was duped."

 A strong metal cage protects the projector from careless and/or
 malevolent handling.

>examine this cage

 The curving faux-wrought-iron bars and caked-on "rust" identify this
 as one of the non-functioning, overpriced decorations which are so
 popular in craft stores. What does a Sunday School need with a bird
 cage?

>open that cage

 The cage is locked, presumably to stop people like you from messing
 with the projector.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Room</span>
 This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are

 A stack of hymnals is crammed into one corner.

>stand

 You get off the upside-down ladies' room garbage can.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 Standing here, you have a good view of the altar and most of the
 sanctuary. A low wall with a railing along the top prevents accidents,
 though it probably also obscures the view for anyone sitting on the
 balcony pews. A projector is mounted at one end of the pews, pointing
 down towards the front of the sanctuary. On the ceiling behind the
 pews, you can see the square outline of what must be a trapdoor of
 some kind, and a narrow staircase leads back down to the sanctuary.

 The orange box is sitting upside down on the floor.

 A tangled heap of bars and cables is lying near the edge of the
 balcony.

 You can also see an upside-down ladies' room garbage can here.

>jump

 No matter how high you jump, the pull-cord is still well out of your
 reach.

>jump over railing

 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony Stairs</span>
 There isn't really any room in here for anything except the stairs up
 to the balcony, but that hasn't stopped someone from putting a potted
 plant in the corner. If you can avoid tripping over the plant, an
 archway to the west leads back out into the sanctuary.

>examine plant

 The plant is a tiny potted palm. It's fake, but that's fair enough.
 It's not like there's enough light in here for a real palm tree to
 flourish.

>climb palm

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>push palm

 Nothing obvious happens.

>get palm

 You remove the tripping hazard from the bottom of the balcony stairs.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
 This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
 huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
 by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.

 Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
 room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.

 It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
 lifeless.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
 The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
 welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
 large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
 is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.

 To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
 obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
 south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
 This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
 tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
 much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
 stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.

 One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Floor Stairway</span>
 This room forms a sort of nook off the fellowship hall to the south. A
 wide flight of stairs leads down to the basement. There are doors to
 the north, northeast and southeast; according to the plaques on them,
 they open onto the pastor's office, the men's restroom and the ladies'
 restroom respectively.

 A vast framed poster is hanging on the wall in between the restroom
 doors, and in the middle of the room, directly facing the poster, is a
 wooden bench.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement Stairway</span>
 This room is apparently just for show; there are no tables or chairs.
 A wide staircase runs up to the main floor of the church, and doorways
 lead east to the nursery, south to the Sunday School room and north to
 the boiler room. Mounted on the wall is a gigantic abstract painting.

 The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
 This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
 like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
 altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
 doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
 west to the hallway.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway runs north into darkness. It's hard to tell how long it
 might be from here, though the Sunday School room to the east provides
 some light at this end. The plywood lighthouse, on the other hand,
 peacefully fails to provide any light. Behind the lighthouse and
 partially obscured by it is a mural of Jesus blessing the little
 children.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Thanks to the light filtering in from the south end of the hall, you
 can make out some kind of mural painted on the wall, but you can't
 tell what it's supposed to represent in the gloom.

>examine mural

 Which do you mean, the bluish blob, the indistinct smear, or the
 swathe of yellow?

>examine bluish

 It's too dark here to make out any details.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>

 be doorways to somewhere, but they're barely distinguishable from the
 walls.

 The cat strolls in from the south and purrs at you.

 You place the open can of tuna carefully on the floor.

 The cat wanders off to the south, glancing back at you as if to check

 Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up

 underneath them. It's already dark outside, and the doors west to the

 Your sleeping bag is lying on a tidy patch of floor, ready for when

 A large part of this room is taken up by a rickety ping pong table.
 Couches line the edges of the room, some of them close enough to the
 table that they're probably not safe to sit on if someone is actually
 playing ping pong. On the other hand, you can't see any ping pong bats
 anywhere, so maybe that's not an issue. In between the couches, doors
 lead north to the nursery, west to the Sunday School room, and south
 to the black light room.

 Propped up in one corner is a rough wooden cross.

 thrown in a garbage can.

 Putting things on the blacklights would achieve nothing.

>examine cage

 The curving faux-wrought-iron bars and caked-on "rust" identify this
 as one of the non-functioning, overpriced decorations which are so
 popular in craft stores. What does a Sunday School need with a bird
 cage?

 The bird cage seems to be welded closed. It must be purely decorative.

 <span class="floydstyle em">life.</span>

 It should be "The wages of sin <span class="floydstyle em">are</span> death."

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Yes! This room! So, Patrick the youth leader got us together a few
 years ago and had us paint the walls of this room black, and then
 paint Bible verses on it, and then install black lights instead of
 normal lights, so it would look like a Christian rave or whatever. And
 I mean it looks fairly cool, I guess.

 "But when you have a dark room, with purple lights, and a bunch of
 couches, and then you invite teenagers into the room and leave them in
 that room unattended, what happens is, the teenagers will use that
 room for what Patrick the youth leader calls 'heavy petting'.

 "So that's why this room is called the Black Light Make-Out Room."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Room</span>
 This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are
 covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and
 windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a
 closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the
 altar to the south, or try the sliding door to the north.

 Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor.

 Behind the sliding door you find a steep, narrow flight of stairs with
 no handrail. You walk down them slowly, not wanting to miss your
 footing in the dim light.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
 You could hardly call this a room. It's just a long, musty, narrow
 space behind a wall. At one end, a flight of stairs runs up to the
 room behind the altar; at the other end a heavy door leads out to the
 south. In between them, a fuse box is mounted on the wall, its metal
 door hanging open to reveal a row of switches.

 A cheap-looking mirror, a black sphere and some black cloth are lying
 in a heap on the floor.

>examine fuse box

 Someone left the fuse box door hanging open, showing a neat row of red
 switches. Most are in the on position, but one, marked "WEST
 BASEMENT", is off.

>flip basement on

 You flick the last switch into the ON position.

>Now let's see if that worked!

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine cloth

 Thick, heavy black cloth of some kind—a curtain or something, maybe.

>examine sphere

 It's a black metal ball with numerous round glass panels set into it.
 Turning it over, you notice that it's heavyish and slightly warm to
 the touch. Your fingers also find a small button on the top? base?
 side? of the sphere.

>get sphere

 Taken.

>get cloth

 Taken.

>press button

 The button clicks, and blue light streams from the glass panels on the
 sphere, reflecting off the cheap-looking mirror and scattering across
 the walls and ceiling. This must be one of those party light sphere
 things that are supposed to make your house look like a nightclub or
 something.

 didn't think much of it either.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Hallway</span>
 The hall ends here at a heavy door to the north. A huge mural of David
 fighting Goliath adorns the west wall, but it's marred by a streak of
 gray gunk clinging to the wall.

 Echoing footsteps draw your attention to a figure walking down the
 south end of the hallway, but whoever it is goes into the Sunday
 School room before you can see their face.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 A huge rainbow arches across the wall in this part of the hallway.
 Underneath it, a door leads west, with an identical door opposite on
 the east wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway continues to run north and south. The wall here is taken
 up by a mural of a beached whale and a man lying on the sand.

 You can see an open can of tuna here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway runs north, past the plywood lighthouse, all the way up to
 the door to the tunnel. A doorway to the east leads into the Sunday
 School room, and on the wall opposite it is the mural of Jesus
 blessing the little children.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
 This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
 like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
 altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
 doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
 west to the hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement Stairway</span>
 This room is apparently just for show; there are no tables or chairs.
 A wide staircase runs up to the main floor of the church, and doorways
 lead east to the nursery, south to the Sunday School room and north to
 the boiler room. Mounted on the wall is a gigantic abstract painting.

 The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.

 From here, you could head north to the boiler room, south to the
 Sunday School room, east to the nursery, and up to the main floor
 stairway.


 This tissue was used to wipe up an eerie glowing substance, then
 thrown in a garbage can.

>u.s.w.n.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Floor Stairway</span>
 This room forms a sort of nook off the fellowship hall to the south. A
 wide flight of stairs leads down to the basement. There are doors to
 the north, northeast and southeast; according to the plaques on them,
 they open onto the pastor's office, the men's restroom and the ladies'
 restroom respectively.

 A vast framed poster is hanging on the wall in between the restroom
 doors, and in the middle of the room, directly facing the poster, is a
 wooden bench.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
 This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
 tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
 much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
 stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.

 One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
 The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
 welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
 large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
 is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.

 To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
 obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
 south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
 This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
 huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
 by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.

 Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
 room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.

 It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
 lifeless.

>listen

 The church is silent.


 Some of the designs are purely abstract, but you notice a dove, a
 lion, a lamb, and what looks like an elk.


 You're holding ten photos:
   two photos of the glowing tissue paper
   a photo of the ghostly figure floating in the air
   a photo of the model church
   a photo of the ladies' room mirrors
   a photo of darkness
   a photo of the flickering lights
   a photo of you taking a photo of yourself
   a photo of the bird cage
   a photo of the cat looking through the window

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit,
 the altar, and the American and Christian flags. Behind them, to the
 north, is a tiny doorway.

 On the altar are two candles.

 A large cross hangs high on the wall above the altar.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Room</span>
 This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are
 covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and
 windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a
 closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the
 altar to the south, or try the sliding door to the north.

 Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor.

>go north

 It turns out it's not that easy taking a photo of yourself with a
 Polaroid camera. The picture came out slightly blurry; you're not sure
 if it's because you weren't holding the camera still, or because it
 was too close to your face.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
 You could hardly call this a room. It's just a long, musty, narrow
 space behind a wall. At one end, a flight of stairs runs up to the
 room behind the altar; at the other end a heavy door leads out to the
 south. In between them, a fuse box is mounted on the wall, its metal
 door hanging open to reveal a row of switches.

 You can see a cheap-looking mirror here.

>examine mirror

 The mirror is large-ish, but the frame is just cheap fake-wood-grain
 plastic and the glass (is it actually glass?) is slightly warped.
 Judging by the Goodwill price sticker on the frame, its previous owner
 didn't think much of it either.

>get mirror

 Taken.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Hallway</span>
 The hall ends here at a heavy door to the north. A huge mural of David
 fighting Goliath adorns the west wall, but it's marred by a streak of
 gray gunk clinging to the wall.

>examine mural

 Which do you mean, David or the giant?

>examine david

 David stands poised, ready to sling a stone at Goliath. The mural
 makes him look like a ten-year-old. You can't really remember the the
 details of the story now, but surely he'd have to be a bit older than
 that before he was allowed to do battle with giants.


 The ectoplasm is pale gray, thick and gooey.

>examine goliath

 Goliath is stooping slightly to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling
 of the hallway.

>look up david

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 volunteered to paint a mural in the basement, and Patrick the youth
 leader gave me permission, so I painted a mural of the Four Beasts
 (the man and the lion and the ox and the eagle) and it was a GREAT
 MURAL but once they saw it they went ahead and covered it up with
 JONAH."

>put gunk in jar

 You've already taken a sample of the ectoplasm; that should be
 sufficient.

>examine door

 There's no writing on the door, but it could hardly say KEEP OUT more
 clearly if there were.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 A huge rainbow arches across the wall in this part of the hallway.
 Underneath it, a door leads west, with an identical door opposite on
 the east wall.

>examine rainbow

 The rainbow is painted in a bright, cartoony style, with thin black
 lines between each of the colors. Unfortunately whoever painted it put
 the indigo and violet stripes in the wrong order.

>examine violet

 You can't see any such thing.

 A huge rainbow arches across the wall in this part of the hallway.
 Underneath it, a door leads west, with an identical door opposite on
 the east wall.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storage West</span>
 You can see a manger (empty), a huge stack of plastic chairs, a tin of
 half-used crayons, a pile of tiny hempen robes, a shepherd's crook,
 several big cloth signs, a tricycle, an unopened packet of
 marshmallows, an exercise ball, some paper streamer chains, and a door
 leading out to the hall here.

>get crook

 Taken.

>examine it

 A wooden pole with a large hook at one end. Presumably this is for the
 Christmas play. Judging by its size, the shepherds are played by
 children.

>examine manger

 This is clearly a manger from a Nativity scene—some wisps of hay are
 still caught in the corners. But baby Jesus is nowhere to be seen.

>examine signs

 You can see that there's text printed on them, but as they're rolled
 up, you can't read them.


 You can see that there's text printed on them, but as they're rolled

>unroll

 (the glowing tissue paper)
 That's not something you can open.

>unroll signs

 There's no room to unroll them in here, and anyway you'd never be able
 to roll them up again.

>get signs

 You start to pick up one of the signs, but it slips through your hands
 and starts to unroll, so you quickly push it back into place.


 The best before date is smudged, but judging by the layer of dust on
 the packet you suspect they're well past it by now.

>examine ball

 (the party light sphere)
 It's one of those party light sphere things, a black metal ball with
 bright blue light glowing out of the glass panels set into it. Turning
 it over, you notice that it's heavyish and slightly warm to the touch.
 Your fingers also find a small button on the top? base? side? of the
 sphere.

>examine exercise ball

 A huge neon pink exercise ball. Some church member is into yoga?

>roll exercise ball east

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>push exercise ball east

 The ball doesn't roll very far before bumping up against some of the
 other junk in the room.

>get on ball

 (the party light sphere)
 That's not something you can enter.

>get on exercise

 That's not something you can enter.

>ride tricycle

 The tricycle creaks under your weight, so you quickly get off it

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine robe

 The robes could only be worn by children, but they could represent any
 number of Bible characters. They've been tossed on the floor in a
 pitiable heap.

 You pick up the robes, but only to fold them neatly and put them back
 in a tidier pile.

 The robes could only be worn by children, but they could represent any

>examine chains

 Colorful chains made out of paper streamers, like you might use as
 decorations for a kid's birthday party. The links are all different
 sizes, and there doesn't seem to be any pattern to the choice of
 colors. At a guess, you'd say the Sunday School children made these.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storage East</span>
 This place is a mess.

 A series of rickety shelves mounted to the north wall have failed to
 put the room into any kind of order. For some reason, there's nothing
 on the lowest shelf, even though there's stuff everywhere else. Near
 the shelves is a sturdy cabinet, maybe three feet tall. In front of
 the cabinet and blocking the lower two-thirds of its door stands a
 huge amplifier. A plywood Noah's Ark and a plywood Ark of the Covenant
 are sitting on the floor by the cabinet. There's a case labelled
 "HANDBELLS" on the Ark of the Covenant.

 You can just make out a container of some kind on the very top shelf,
 glistening strangely.

>examine glistening

 The glistening container is up on top of the wall shelves; you can't
 get a look at it from your current height.

>drop men's

 You place the men's room garbage can carefully on the floor.

>examine noah's

 The whole thing is made out of plywood, but smaller planks of wood
 have been painted on the sides to give the vague impression of a
 giant, rectangular seafaring vessel. It's two feet tall, two feet
 deep, and maybe four feet long.

 This wooden box has been spraypainted gold and detailed with glitter
 markers in an attempt to convey that this is an object of great value.

 balcony pews. A projector is mounted at one end of the pews, pointing
 down towards the front of the sanctuary. Behind the pews you can see
 the ladder up to the steeple, and a narrow staircase leads back down
 to the sanctuary.

 The orange box is sitting upside down on the floor.

 A tangled heap of bars and cables is lying near the edge of the
 balcony.

 You can also see an upside-down ladies' room garbage can here.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steeple</span>
 The inside of the church steeple is a cold concrete cube with
 cinderblock walls. There's one window, but it's been boarded up.

 You jump. There's a boy sitting on the floor, smirking at you. It's
 Aiden Kingsley.

 The ghost's glowing dress lies in a heap nearby. It doesn't look very
 ghostly now.

 Aiden stands up. "Hey, hey, Robin! Are you enjoying your evening?" he
 asks, smiling.

 You are not smiling. "So you're the ghost."

 "Well, yes. Well, no. I am not a dead person. Heh. But I portrayed the
 ghost you saw, yes."

 "Does Orchid know?"

 "Does Orchid know. Does Orchid know? What a well-chosen detective
 question."

 Aiden looks down the trapdoor behind you. "Do you think we could
 continue this conversation downstairs? It's really freaking cold up
 here."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 Standing here, you have a good view of the altar and most of the
 sanctuary. A low wall with a railing along the top prevents accidents,
 though it probably also obscures the view for anyone sitting on the
 balcony pews. A projector is mounted at one end of the pews, pointing
 down towards the front of the sanctuary. Behind the pews you can see

 A tangled heap of bars and cables is lying near the edge of the

 You can also see an upside-down ladies' room garbage can here.

 You look back to make sure Aiden has followed you.

 "Yes. Now I'll tell you the answer to your question. Of course Orchid
 knows. This was all Orchid's idea. She was very naughty. And I'm not
 even supposed to be here, so I should probably get going."

 He tries to slip past you, but you grab his arm.

 Aiden yelps like a dog. "What's your problem?"

 "You're not going anywhere. I've got a few more questions."

 "Then can you get your hands off me first? You're gonna break my arm."

 "Sure." You let go of his arm. "Let's get going." You know exactly
 where the two of you are going, but you should probably keep that a
 surprise.

 You snap a picture of Aiden. The camera whirrs and vibrates and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony Stairs</span>
 There isn't really any room in here for anything except the stairs up
 to the balcony. An archway to the west leads back out into the
 sanctuary.

 Aiden mopes along after you.

 "Yeah, Orchid brought the idea to me. She said if she could write a
 story about a real ghost, then maybe people would actually read the
 newspaper. Heh. But I told her I'd help her."

 "Why?"

 "For the heck of it, primarily."

 From here, you could head west to the sanctuary and up to the balcony.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
 This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
 huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
 by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.

 Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
 room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.

 It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
 lifeless.

 Aiden follows you in.

 "Originally, she was just going to let me in the church during the
 sleepover, and we'd just spend the night taking a bunch of ghost
 pictures. However. Then we found out that you were going to be the
 other newspaper girl staying the night. And Orchid said you'd never go
 along with it. So we had to change the plan."

>examine desk

 You saw one of these in a movie once. The top recedes into the back of
 the desk, and you can hide a convict inside.

>open desk

 You try to pull back the top of the desk, but it's locked down.

>look up desk

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "The
 sound guy, whose name I don't remember, keeps all the controls for the
 sound and lights in that rolltop desk. He takes the key to the desk
 home with him, because the stuff inside is super expensive. I'm just
 fine with not breaking into it and messing around because I would
 probably break everything."

>look up aiden

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 guess you've probably seen Aiden in plays, but I've actually worked
 with him, so I know what I'm talking about. He is unbearable. You
 should be able to guess from the mustache.

 "Aiden goes to parties, gets girls drunk, makes out with them, and
 then convinces them that his number is '123-4567'. And then he tells
 this story to everyone at rehearsal and expects us to laugh.

 "Speaking of which. This is the worst thing Aiden does: He laughs at
 every single one of his own jokes—sometimes just at sentences he says
 that can't even be considered jokes—and it's always the same
 single-syllable laugh, always the same pitch, pronounced exactly the
 same way. It's not really a laugh, it's more of a signal that you're
 supposed to think he's funny.

 "Aiden doesn't even go to my church, but he's the worst, and I think
 you should know that."

>look up sound guy

 (looking up "sound guy" in Casey's notes)
 You riffle through the notes, but you can't find anything that seems
 relevant.

>ask aiden for number

 Aiden looks around nervously. "Why don't we keep moving, huh?"

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
 The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
 welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
 large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
 is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.

 To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
 obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
 south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.

 Aiden follows you in.

 As you enter the narthex, Orchid strolls in through the front door of
 the church. When she sees Aiden, her eyes go wide.

 "Aiden! What are you doing here?"

 "Hey. Don't bother," Aiden snaps. "I've already told her everything.
 Or almost everything. Heh."

 Orchid rushes up to Aiden with her fists clenched. "You're lying.
 There's no proof. All you can prove is that you broke into the church
 and tried to scare us."

 "Well, no," says Aiden. "I can prove some other things. I have the
 receipts. For the makeup and everything. Because you had to use a
 credit card, idiot."

 Orchid goes quiet.

 "Well, we can talk about this in the morning," Aiden says, and he
 makes for the southern exit—but you grab his arm, and he cries out
 softly. "Yeah. Your way is probably better."

>kill aiden

 You have to assume you'd get in huge trouble if you attacked
 Aiden—like suspended-at-the-very-least levels of trouble.

>show photos to orchid

 Orchid declines to comment.

>get aiden's tag

 You can't see any such thing.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
 This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
 tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
 much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
 stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.

 One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.

 Aiden and Orchid come in after you.

 "Now, where were we? Orchid didn't trust you to help her pull off this
 hoax. She said you're too much of a straight arrow. Those weren't her
 exact words. What were your exact words, Orchid?"

 Orchid is looking down at her shoes.

 Aiden shrugs. "She said something really nasty."

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Floor Stairway</span>
 This room forms a sort of nook off the fellowship hall to the south. A
 wide flight of stairs leads down to the basement. There are doors to
 the north, northeast and southeast; according to the plaques on them,
 they open onto the pastor's office, the men's restroom and the ladies'
 restroom respectively.

 A vast framed poster is hanging on the wall in between the restroom
 doors, and in the middle of the room, directly facing the poster, is a
 wooden bench.

 Orchid and Aiden follow along.

 "But Orchid had this other great idea. She figured if we went a little
 further with the hoax, we could get you to believe the ghost was real.
 Heh."

 "I wasn't trying to trick you!" Orchid pleads. "I just wanted it to be
 authentic. I wanted it to be a great story."

 "Sure, and then the great ghost story would be in the newspaper with
 the name of the most trustworthy reporter on staff on it, and Orchid's
 name too." Aiden chuckles. "But, looks like that didn't work out."

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement Stairway</span>
 This room is apparently just for show; there are no tables or chairs.
 A wide staircase runs up to the main floor of the church, and doorways
 lead east to the nursery, south to the Sunday School room and north to
 the boiler room. Mounted on the wall is a gigantic abstract painting.

 The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.

 Orchid and Aiden come down the stairs after you.

 Aiden looks past you, into the nursery, and you can see something
 click in his brain.

 "Although, you know, we could still do it. You guys can write the
 story, I won't say anything, Orchid won't say anything, everyone will
 love it, you'll probably be co-editors-in-chief next year. Let's go
 back upstairs, we'll get some better pictures of the ghost."

 "No thanks," you say.

>photo orchid and aiden

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>photograph orchid and aiden

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>photograph orchid

 (with the Polaroid camera)
 You snap a picture of Orchid. The camera whirrs and vibrates and
 eventually spits out a print of the photo.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nursery</span>
 Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up
 in a corner of the room. Cupboards are mounted high on the walls, out
 of reach of tiny fingers, and an enormous blue recliner sits
 underneath them. It's already dark outside, and the doors west to the
 basement stairway and south to the youth room are dark as well.

 Your sleeping bag is lying on a tidy patch of floor, ready for when
 you finish your investigation.

 Sharon's makeshift bed doesn't look comfortable, but apparently she's
 fast asleep anyway.

 You usher Aiden and Orchid in ahead of you.

>wake sharon

 Sharon stirs, rubs her eyes, and looks at you, then Orchid, then
 Aiden. She says something that one does not typically say in a church.

 ***
>press space

 "What did she say?"

 "I won't repeat it."

 Casey slumps back in his chair. "You would make a great Christian," he
 mutters.

 "I'm sure I would." You try not to smile.

 "Well, how did Aiden fly around in the sanctuary?"

 "I'm entertaining a hypothesis. I noticed components from an unusual
 mechanism lying around in the balcony."

 "The Engelgurt?"

 "If you like. I assume that, while I was chasing after Aiden, Orchid
 was up in the balcony disassembling the rig so it would look ever so
 slightly less suspicious."

 "Hey, did you hear what happened to Orchid?"

 "I heard that she's suspended from the next two issues of the paper."

 Casey pouts. "I wanted to be the one to tell you."

 "Sorry. Why don't you tell me what happened to Aiden?"

 "I'd love to! Except, I didn't know anything happened to Aiden. I
 didn't think they could do anything, since he's not on the newspaper?"

 "Unfortunately for Aiden, in this case the left and right hands are in
 close communication. The drama department is putting him on probation
 for an as-yet undetermined period."

 Casey perks right back up. "Robin! That is the best thing I've ever
 heard! Although the thing about Orchid is pretty great too."

 "Well, Orchid is getting what she wanted anyway, I think. The
 <span class="floydstyle em">Warbler</span> is going to run a story that people will actually
 read, for once—except this one is true."

>look up gwen

 (Gwen)
 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "I'll tell you about the big painting at the bottom of the stairs, but
 first I have to tell you about Homeschooled Gwen.

 "Homeschooled Gwen, so called because she was totally homeschooled,
 went to our high school. Yes! She was not in fact <span class="floydstyle em">completely</span>
 homeschooled, because her parents sent her to West for seventh-period
 geometry, because they did not remember the quadratic formula. It is:
 x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus
 4ac, over 2a.

 "But Gwen's parents couldn't remember that, even though I, Casey,
 memorized it so easily. So Gwen went to West High. And she was in my
 Geometry class."

 You pause before flipping the page. This story barely seems relevant
 to the church, much less your investigation. Are you sure you want to
 keep reading?
>yes

 You turn the page:

 "So, due to being homeschooled, Gwen was not at all socialized for
 interacting with us teens of the modern era. What I am saying is that
 she was super weird. I was friends with her mostly out of morbid
 curiosity. Here are some of the weird stunts she pulled in Geometry:
 Told us all individually what breed of dog we would be if we were
 dogs. Read us stories, apparently like Wendy read to the Lost Boys.
 Gave us a survey about what we found attractive in girls.

 "When I say 'us' I mean just the boys in class. Gwen was super
 boy-crazy, because, due to being homeschooled all of her life, Gwen
 had never seen a boy before. Yes."

 This looks like it might be turning into an extended rant against the
 institution of homeschooling (Casey can be something of a jerk when it
 comes to things he knows nothing about). Do you want to continue?

>yes

 Casey goes on:

 "I mean she had probably seen a male human before. She had a dad; we
 found that out eventually. But you know what I mean.

 "Anyway one day after school, after seventh-period geometry, I was
 hanging out in the mud room waiting for my ride home, and Gwen was
 there too, waiting for her own ride back to her own horrible
 school-home hybrid, and then <span class="floydstyle em">Patrick the youth leader</span> showed
 up, because he's still allowed on school grounds. And he asked me
 about the lock-in."

 It is increasingly clear to you that this story has no bearing on your
 investigation. Do you want to keep reading it?

>yes

 You turn another page.

 "Or he asked me about <span class="floydstyle em">something.</span> Probably the lock-in. But we
 were talking, and Gwen was there, and Patrick the youth leader WITHOUT
 CONSULTING ME BEFOREHAND looks over at Gwen and asks her if she wants
 to come to the lock-in. And of course Gwen says yes, because there
 will be boys there.

 "Gwen came to the lock-in, and after that she started coming to the
 high school group meetings. And an unfortunate percentage of people in
 the group did not seem to catch on right away that Gwen was a nutbar,
 so she felt very welcome and emotionally supported by us, and when
 Patrick the youth leader opened the floor for 'discussion' after his
 sermons we all got to listen to her insane opinions about
 Thanksgiving, and family togetherness, and sex, etc., etc."

 You look up from the notes. Maybe there's something else you should be
 doing. Do you want to continue reading?

>yes

 "Then, this was around the end of last semester, Patrick the youth
 leader gave all of us in the group one of his CHALLENGES. His
 CHALLENGE to us this particular week was for us to think about our
 relationship to the church. I mean, like, 'spend the next seven days
 thinking about this, and come back next week with something really
 profound.' A lot of Patrick the youth leader's CHALLENGES are
 basically attempts to get us to say something profound.

 "And of course we all forgot about this CHALLENGE immediately, because
 come on. He never follows up on any of them anyway. He just read in
 some youth leader magazine that you should give your youth group
 CHALLENGES.

 "And when we came back the next week, of course, Patrick the youth
 leader doesn't bother asking anyone what brilliant answers we came up
 with to his incredibly vague CHALLENGE. We had a sermon and then we
 played Sardines or whatever.

 "But before we could leave, Patrick the youth leader called us all
 together, because Gwen had something to share with us."

 Keep reading?

>yes

 "Now that I think about it, she must have brought the painting in with
 her, left it behind a couch or something, and waited for three hours
 or however long for Patrick the youth leader to ask for people's
 answers to his CHALLENGE of the previous week. She was just too
 freaked out and embarrassed to bring it up herself, until the very
 last possible moment.

 "So yeah it was this painting. I'm not gonna bother describing this
 painting, because you can see it yourself. But if you think about it,
 all those tiny brushstrokes on a canvas that huge must have taken a
 zillion hours to do, and she supposedly only had a week to paint it. I
 guess that's what the church meant to Gwen."

 It goes on a little longer, but that feels like an end to the
 "substance" of the story, such as it is. Should you bother reading the
 rest?

>yes

 "Well, sometime during the summer, Gwen quit coming to the youth
 group. It took me a while to figure out what happened but it turns out
 she got <span class="floydstyle em">grounded</span> from <span class="floydstyle em">church</span> because her parents
 found out she had a <span class="floydstyle em">crush</span> on a <span class="floydstyle em">boy</span> who went there.

 "So, that is the story on Homeschooled Gwen. You will never meet her,
 because her parents will never let her out of the house again."

 put makeup on over them for school. You have the uneasy feeling that

 (the man and the lion and the ox and the eagle) and it was a GREAT
 MURAL but once they saw it they went ahead and covered it up with
 JONAH."

>look up manger

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "So
 last year, Orchid said she wanted to run the Christmas play. And
 Marcie Kempulfers, who always runs the Christmas play every year,
 thought that was a great idea. She said it would be really cute to
 have a little girl be in charge of the play. This was last year, so
 Orchid was either fifteen or sixteen years old, I think.

 "The first thing Orchid suggested was that they use a real baby to
 play the baby Jesus. Some church person had a baby, and Orchid,
 because she's completely a girl, was totally nuts for this baby. But
 Marcie says oh no, we always use a doll for the baby Jesus, real
 babies cause so many headaches.

>look up handbells

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Here is the deal with the handbells. Marcie Kempulfers is in charge
 of the bell choir. She has a very strict handbell protocol. The
 handbells are church property, and she says so frequently as people
 try to goof off in bell choir practice.

 "But Patrick the youth leader is not so uptight, and for this youth
 service he thought we should do a bell choir number, without any
 oversight by or permission from Marcie Kempulfers. He decided we
 should play 'Seek Ye First', because he could only force an octave's
 worth of kids to volunteer, and he thought it was an easy song. And it
 is an easy song. But we were poorly motivated.

 "So the youth service rolls around, and the extremely unofficial youth
 bell choir has yet to master our song. But we're listed in the
 program. We have to go out and perform, and when we perform this song
 we are going to butcher it.

 "Then, right before the service starts, Marcie Kempulfers shows up to
 have words with Patrick the youth leader. The effects of these words
 were, first of all, we were definitely not going to be performing a
 non-Kempulfers-supervised handbell piece, ever, and secondly, now
 Marcie takes the handbells home with her whenever they aren't being
 used at church.

 "I don't know why she doesn't take the case too."

 "Okay. Just as she's about to land, Orchid's robe gets caught on one
 of the shepherd's crooks, and the Engelgurt suffers a critical failure
 and Orchid falls to the floor and according to some witnesses almost
 dies. The whole service gets shut down so that Orchid can go to the
 emergency room, although I think all that happened was she sprained
 her ankle.

 "Of course, Orchid is in huge trouble with Marcie Kempulfers and with
 the church in general, but what does being in trouble with a church
 even mean? It's not like they can expel you. We're Methodists. They
 didn't even get rid of the Engelgurt; it's still in the storage room.

 "And anyway Orchid wasn't sorry at all. She kept saying, 'At least it
 was new!' 'At least it was exciting!' Because that's how she operates.

 "That's it. This is Entry Four of Four."

>look up robes

 Which do you mean, the choir robes or the neat stack of hempen robes?

>look up hempen robes

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "So
 next Orchid says she wants the shepherds to sing a song. You have to
 understand that the shepherds are played by the littler kids, and the
 older kids play angels or Mary and Joseph or the wise men, and while
 every older kid ends up having to sing a song at some point, the
 shepherds do not. I think Orchid wanted them to sing 'Silent Night',
 which is a pretty good choice for little kids to sing. I will admit
 that Orchid made a good call here.

 "But Marcie did not agree. I'm pretty sure Marcie thinks that because
 it's impossible to get little kids to carry a tune or understand
 Italian music vocabulary, nobody wants to hear them sing in church,
 which is a critical misconception and I think indicates some sort of
 psychological defect in Marcie Kempulfers's brain. Anyway.

 "Marcie made up this insane justification to have the bell choir play
 'Silent Night' instead. She said the bell choir had already practiced
 it, which was technically true, although specifically they had
 practiced it during the previous calendar year. But Marcie got her
 way.

 "I hope you're not reading this as me defending Orchid, because I
 would never do that. Don't worry; we will get to the part where Orchid
 is horrible in the next entry. This is Entry Two of Four."

>look up cloth signs

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: We
 hang up the cloth signs in the sanctuary for Advent. I think they say
 'Hope', 'Wait', 'Expect', and 'Await'."

>hope
>look up engelgurt

 That's not a verb I recognize.


 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Well, Marcie shut down a couple more of Orchid's ideas, and Orchid
 eventually figured out her real problem, which was: she kept telling
 Marcie her ideas. If she was going to change anything about the
 Christmas program, she was going to have to do it behind Marcie's
 back.

 "So she got her dad to build this crazy device, the Engelgurt, which
 used a system of rods and pulleys and winches to make someone glide
 across a room, like an angel.

 "A couple nights before the Christmas program, Orchid and her dad came
 in and set up the Engelgurt while nobody else was around. I mean, I
 have to assume her dad was involved, although I don't remember him
 ever getting in trouble over it. Whatever.

 "The night of the program came around and for a while everything went
 exactly as Marcie planned. Jesus was a doll, and the bell choir played
 'Silent Night', and so on. But in the middle of the angels singing
 'Angels We Have Heard On High', Orchid appears up in the balcony, in
 her non-regulation homemade angel robe, and starts floating down to
 Earth, and oh no I've run out of space! Cliffhanger! This is Entry
 Three of Four!"

 Something about the description of the Engelgurt sounds vaguely
 familiar.

>look up boiler room

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "I've only been inside of the boiler room very briefly, but I have to
 assume it's a really cool place to hang out. Make sure you tell me all
 about it when you get the chance."

>look up blank page

 You riffle through the notes, but you can't find anything that seems
 relevant.

>look up black light

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Yes! This room! So, Patrick the youth leader got us together a few
 years ago and had us paint the walls of this room black, and then
 paint Bible verses on it, and then install black lights instead of
 normal lights, so it would look like a Christian rave or whatever. And
 I mean it looks fairly cool, I guess.

 "But when you have a dark room, with purple lights, and a bunch of
 couches, and then you invite teenagers into the room and leave them in
 that room unattended, what happens is, the teenagers will use that
 room for what Patrick the youth leader calls 'heavy petting'.

 "So that's why this room is called the Black Light Make-Out Room."

>look up back room

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "The
 back room is kind of a secret, I guess, although we use it as the
 'backstage' whenever we do plays and that kind of thing. Nobody ever
 uses it as a hiding place when we're playing games, though. I guess it
 might be too obvious? Or maybe it's just too boring.

 "You can get to the basement from the back room, too: there's a
 sliding panel in the back wall, but to get it open, you have to apply
 some upward pressure to get it out of its groove a little bit. That's
 the real secret, I guess."

>look up tunnel

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "You
 might want to know where the tunnel is, because that's where the fuse
 box is. If I remember to draw a map for you then I'll make sure to
 point out the tunnel and stick it in here."

 There is no map.

>look up fuse box

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "The
 fuse box is in the tunnel. I don't know how it works. Ohms."

>look up tuna

 Which do you mean, the open can of tuna or the mass of tuna?

>look up mass of tuna

 (in Casey's notes)
 On the subject of canned food Casey writes, "I'm pretty sure the
 people who are supposed to be in charge of donating stuff to the Food
 Bank are really disorganized, because you always see spare cans of
 stuff lying around. Or maybe some of the cans were rejected by the
 Food Bank. I don't know how it works."

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "The
 model church is a model of some other church. I think it used to be
 inside of that church, but it got torn down, or they went bankrupt,
 and the model ended up in our church. It's kind of a creepy object,
 though. The guy who made it was clearly way too obsessed with his
 church."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony Stairs</span>
 There isn't really any room in here for anything except the stairs up
 to the balcony, but that hasn't stopped someone from putting a potted
 plant in the corner. If you can avoid tripping over the plant, an
 archway to the west leads back out into the sanctuary.

 The cat watches you for a moment, but runs off to the west before you
 can get near it.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
 This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
 huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
 by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.

 Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
 room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.

 It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
 lifeless.

 The cat wanders off to the north, glancing back at you as if to check
 whether you're following.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit,
 the altar, and the American and Christian flags. Behind them, to the
 north, is a tiny doorway.

 On the altar are two candles.

 A large cross hangs high on the wall above the altar.

 You're still on the other side of the room when the cat scampers off
 to the north.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Room</span>
 This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are
 covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and
 windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a
 closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the
 altar to the south, or try the sliding door to the north.

 A stack of hymnals is crammed into one corner.

 Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor.

 The cat bounds downstairs.

>go down

 Behind the sliding door you find a steep, narrow flight of stairs with
 no handrail. You walk down them slowly, not wanting to miss your
 footing in the dim light.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
 You could hardly call this a room. It's just a long, musty, narrow
 space behind a wall. At one end, a flight of stairs runs up to the
 room behind the altar; at the other end a heavy door leads out to the
 south. In between them, a fuse box is mounted on the wall, its metal
 door hanging open to reveal a row of switches.

 A cheap-looking mirror, a black sphere and some black cloth are lying
 in a heap on the floor.

 The cat sits down underneath the fuse box and starts licking its paw.

>examine cloth

 Thick, heavy black cloth of some kind—a curtain or something, maybe.

 The cat scampers up the stairs.

>nap

 When you feel you've got all the evidence you need, your sleeping bag
 is waiting for you in the nursery.

 Unlike some of the other switches, the "West Basement" switch actually
 has a legible label. It's also the only switch that's not turned on
 right now.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
 The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
 welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
 large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
 is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.

 To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
 obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
 south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "But

 continuous use.

 notice, and the corners of that podium are right about at crotch
 level."

 The heavy door slips out of your fingers and slams shut behind you,
 leaving you in darkness.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing except for the dim light
 trickling in from the south end of the hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 It's almost completely dark. At least you can still see the light at
 the south end of the hallway. The rectangles to the east and west must
 be doorways to somewhere, but they're barely distinguishable from the
 walls.

>s. s. e


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Thanks to the light filtering in from the south end of the hall, you
 can make out some kind of mural painted on the wall, but you can't
 tell what it's supposed to represent in the gloom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway runs north into darkness. It's hard to tell how long it
 might be from here, though the Sunday School room to the east provides
 some light at this end. The plywood lighthouse, on the other hand,
 peacefully fails to provide any light. Behind the lighthouse and
 partially obscured by it is a mural of Jesus blessing the little
 children.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
 This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
 like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
 altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
 doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
 west to the hallway.

 The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement Stairway</span>
 This room is apparently just for show; there are no tables or chairs.
 A wide staircase runs up to the main floor of the church, and doorways
 lead east to the nursery, south to the Sunday School room and north to
 the boiler room. Mounted on the wall is a gigantic abstract painting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boiler Room</span>
 This must be a fairly large room, but most of the space is given over
 to snaking pipes, anonymous machinery, and the church's giant boiler.

>examine pipes

 Many of the pipes run all the way down to the floor from their tangled
 maze in the ceiling, making some corners of the room impossible to
 reach.

 A menagerie of valves and pressure gauges stick out from the pipes at
 awkward angles, some dangerously close to your eye level.

 The piece is very pleasant, if not particularly interesting: the
 inoffensive greens and pinks could suggest river waters, or branches
 waving in the wind. Its size is probably its most impressive quality.

 This room forms a sort of nook off the fellowship hall to the south. A
 wide flight of stairs leads down to the basement. There are doors to
 the north, northeast and southeast; according to the plaques on them,
 they open onto the pastor's office, the men's restroom and the ladies'
 restroom respectively.

 A vast framed poster is hanging on the wall in between the restroom
 doors, and in the middle of the room, directly facing the poster, is a

 that, because of fairness, the men's restroom was declared to be
 off-limits as well. For Sardines purposes at least."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The church kitchen contains much the same kind of thing as any
 kitchen, only more so. Long countertops line the walls, with cupboards
 and drawers underneath them. A break in the counters allows you to
 leave the kitchen via the door to the west, and on the far side of the
 room a sink is set into the counter.

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I'm
 really glad you're using a Polaroid to get proof of the ghost, because
 that's what Winona Ryder used in <span class="floydstyle em">Beetlejuice</span> to get proof of
 Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis.

 "Now that I think of it, in the movie, the ghosts didn't actually show
 up on the Polaroids. But that's probably not how it works in real
 life."

>look up cross

 (the small white cross)
 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Man, when I was a little kid in Sunday School, and we had those
 little kid Bible lessons, I always used to stare at that little white
 cross, to pass the time or something. I'm pretty sure I was too smart
 for Sunday School. Sunday School is a weird thing to be too smart for,
 I guess.

 "Although I guess when the high schoolers broke off to be their own
 mature group, that was basically the same thing. Kind of. In that
 situation it was because we were too cool for the junior high kids.
 But that's still really weird.

 "What I mean is, it's really weird for people who identify as
 Christians to also identify as being too cool for something."

>look up wooden cross

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "If
 you ask me I think that big gnarly cross in the black light room is in
 kind of poor taste, mostly because of the barbed wire crown on top. It
 doesn't belong in a church, it belongs in a grungy music video, with
 some rotting steak or something.

 "I dunno, I feel like the torture of Christ isn't exactly radical? But
 I guess Patrick the youth leader likes it."

>look up large cross

 (in Casey's notes)

 fine."

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:

 You riffle through the notes, but you can't find anything that seems

>look up match

 (looking up "match" in Casey's notes)
 You riffle through the notes, but you can't find anything that seems
 relevant.

>look up light

 (the light switch)
 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
 don't have much to say about the lights. Sometimes there's a problem
 and you have to go mess with the fuse box. But in your case it doesn't
 matter, because you should be leaving the lights off anyway! You're
 hunting a ghost!"

>look up sharon

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "Why
 do people like Sharon want to become teachers? (By 'people like
 Sharon' I mean 'people who obviously hate everything about teaching,
 even and especially students'.) If you're already completely jaded and
 cynical after your first semester of student teaching, isn't that a
 sign that you should give up on K-12 education and possibly on life in
 general?"

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The church kitchen contains much the same kind of thing as any
 kitchen, only more so. Long countertops line the walls, with cupboards
 and drawers underneath them. A break in the counters allows you to
 leave the kitchen via the door to the west, and on the far side of the
 room a sink is set into the counter.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a name tag (being worn)
   a can of tuna
   a can opener
   a jam jar
     some ectoplasm
   an orange box
   a bird cage
   a small white cross
   a stack of photos
   Casey's notes
   a Polaroid camera (being worn)

>look up jam

 (in Casey's notes)
 You can't find a note for any specific jar, but Casey did write down
 something related.

 "In like, I think freshman year, Patrick the youth leader had this
 great idea to try canning preserves, to raise money for some kind of
 thing. And he gave each of us a job: you get jars, you get
 strawberries, you get peaches, we'll all come together and can stuff.

 "And, because we were freshmen and not yet completely jaded by the
 high school experience, we all brought the stuff we were supposed to.
 But on the day of the big event it turned out, in a revelation that
 completely shocked the socks off of Patrick the youth leader, that
 canning preserves is a pretty complicated process with steps beyond
 just mashing up fruit and putting it into jars. And if you mess it up
 then your jam will give people salmonella and they'll die.

 "So we just sat around and ate fruit, and now there are a bunch of
 glass jars hanging around the church for no good reason."

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
 This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
 tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
 much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
 stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.

 One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
 The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
 welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
 large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
 is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.

 To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
 obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
 south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.

>n. n. n


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
 This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
 huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
 by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.

 Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
 room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.

 It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
 lifeless.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit,
 the altar, and the American and Christian flags. Behind them, to the
 north, is a tiny doorway.

 On the altar are two candles.

 A large cross hangs high on the wall above the altar.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Room</span>
 This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are
 covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and
 windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a
 closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the
 altar to the south, or try the sliding door to the north.

 A stack of hymnals is crammed into one corner.

 Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
 You could hardly call this a room. It's just a long, musty, narrow
 space behind a wall. At one end, a flight of stairs runs up to the
 room behind the altar; at the other end a heavy door leads out to the
 south. In between them, a fuse box is mounted on the wall, its metal
 door hanging open to reveal a row of switches.

 A cheap-looking mirror, a black sphere and some black cloth are lying
 in a heap on the floor.

>examine fuse

 Unlike some of the other switches, the "West Basement" switch actually
 has a legible label. It's also the only switch that's not turned on
 right now.

>turn on switch

 You flick the last switch into the ON position.

>go south

 (first opening the heavy door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Hallway</span>
 The hall ends here at a heavy door to the north. A huge mural of David
 fighting Goliath adorns the west wall, but it's marred by a streak of
 gray gunk clinging to the wall.

 Echoing footsteps draw your attention to a figure walking down the
 south end of the hallway, but whoever it is goes into the Sunday
 School room before you can see their face.

>s. s. s


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 A huge rainbow arches across the wall in this part of the hallway.
 Underneath it, a door leads west, with an identical door opposite on
 the east wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway continues to run north and south. The wall here is taken
 up by a mural of a beached whale and a man lying on the sand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The hallway runs north, past the plywood lighthouse, all the way up to
 the door to the tunnel. A doorway to the east leads into the Sunday
 School room, and on the wall opposite it is the mural of Jesus
 blessing the little children.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
 This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
 like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
 altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
 doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
 west to the hallway.

 The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.

>look up tv trolley

 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Yeah, we have video games at church. I think the SNES belongs to
 Chad. Does Chad even come to church anymore? Well, he's gotta come
 back someday. To get his SNES."

>look up chad

 The plump blue whale is flicking its tail in the air in a cheerful
 sort of fashion. It doesn't seem at all bothered by having beached
 itself and vomited up a human.

>examine jonah

 It looks like Jonah hasn't recovered from his ordeal in the belly of
 the whale yet.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 A huge rainbow arches across the wall in this part of the hallway.
 Underneath it, a door leads west, with an identical door opposite on

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storage West</span>
 You can see a manger (empty), a huge stack of plastic chairs, a tin of
 half-used crayons, a pile of tiny hempen robes, a shepherd's crook,
 several big cloth signs, a tricycle, an unopened packet of
 marshmallows, an exercise ball, some paper streamer chains, and a door
 leading out to the hall here.

>get crook

 Taken.

>examine crayons

 Some of the crayons are half-used. Some of them are more like
 three-quarters used, or even four-fifths used. The rest are broken.

>look up crayons

 (in Casey's notes)
 You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting:
 "Before a certain unnamed individual left the church, we used to have
 art activities in Sunday School all the time. It was awesome. But
 things change, and people change, and on and on. I think there are
 some crayons left in the storage room."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony Stairs</span>
 There isn't really any room in here for anything except the stairs up
 to the balcony, but that hasn't stopped someone from putting a potted
 plant in the corner. If you can avoid tripping over the plant, an
 archway to the west leads back out into the sanctuary.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 Standing here, you have a good view of the altar and most of the
 sanctuary. A low wall with a railing along the top prevents accidents,
 though it probably also obscures the view for anyone sitting on the
 balcony pews. A projector is mounted at one end of the pews, pointing
 down towards the front of the sanctuary. On the ceiling behind the
 pews, you can see the square outline of what must be a trapdoor of
 some kind, and a narrow staircase leads back down to the sanctuary.

 A tangled heap of bars and cables is lying near the edge of the
 balcony.

>reach cord with crook

 Standing on tiptoe, you flourish the hooked end of the crook at the
 loop of cord, but you still can't <span class="floydstyle em">quite</span> reach.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a shepherd's crook
   a name tag (being worn)
   a can of tuna
   a can opener
   a jam jar
     some ectoplasm
   an orange box
   a bird cage
   a small white cross
   a stack of photos
   Casey's notes
   a Polaroid camera (being worn)

 The cat trots up the stairs and purrs at you.

>drp box

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>drop box

 You place the orange box carefully on the floor.

>flip box

 You pick up the stuff in the orange box and turn it upside down.

 The cat springs onto the pile of bars and things and from there up
 onto the railing of the balcony but—probably wisely—immediately
 jumps
 back down again.

>examine railing

 A low wall runs along the edge of the balcony, with a thick wooden
 railing set on top of it. It's hard to tell if the railing is just
 meant to be decorative, or if it was added as an afterthought to make
 the wall a bit higher.

 The cat bounds downstairs.

>stand on box

 You step up onto the upside-down orange box.

>reach cord with crook

 You catch the loop of cord with the end of the crook and pull. The
 trapdoor opens and a small ladder slides down, offering access to the
 steeple above.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steeple</span>
 The inside of the church steeple is a cold concrete cube with
 cinderblock walls. There's one window, but it's been boarded up.

 You jump. There's a boy sitting on the floor, smirking at you. It's
 Aiden Kingsley.

 The ghost's glowing dress lies in a heap nearby. It doesn't look very
 ghostly now.

 Aiden stands up. "Hey, hey, Robin! Are you enjoying your evening?" he
 asks, smiling.

 You are not smiling. "So you're the ghost."

 "Well, yes. Well, no. I am not a dead person. Heh. But I portrayed the
 ghost you saw, yes."

 "Does Orchid know?"

 "Does Orchid know. Does Orchid know? What a well-chosen detective
 question."

 Aiden looks down the trapdoor behind you. "Do you think we could

 "Yes. Now I'll tell you the answer to your question. Of course Orchid

 even supposed to be here, so I should probably get going."

 He tries to slip past you, but you grab his arm.

 Aiden yelps like a dog. "What's your problem?"

 "You're not going anywhere. I've got a few more questions."

 "Then can you get your hands off me first? You're gonna break my arm."

 "Sure." You let go of his arm. "Let's get going." You know exactly

 Casey glances around the newspaper office. "Orchid is gone, right?"

 "Yes, she left. Why do you ask?"

 "I wanted to give you this while she wasn't around." He hands you a
 thick, well-leafed notebook. "It's just kind of a guide kind of thing,
 with some general information and directions, just to help you get
 around. Don't let Orchid see it."

 "Are you sure I'll require so much background material? And why
 shouldn't Orchid see it?"

 "Well, Robin," Casey says, and he spins around a chair to sit on it
 backwards in what he surely thinks is a very casual and friendly pose,
 "Orchid is a church member, and you're not, and you missed the
 lock-in, so you don't have a lot of the context that Orchid has. I
 just wanted to put you on an even footing. And for your second
 question, I might have written some things in there that I wouldn't
 have said to Orchid's face."

 You nod, and slip the notebook into your backpack. "I'm sure you've
 adequately prepared me for my mission."

 "Yes, I have. You're welcome. No, wait, I've got one more thing to
 say. Make sure you take lots of pictures, obviously. It's your job.
 That's one." He starts counting on his fingers. "Um, it's more fun if
 you run off by yourself, so make sure you get Sharon off your back.
 That's two. And keep an open mind. I mean, just because you don't
 believe in ghosts doesn't mean you're not gonna see one.

 Sharon, in her wisdom, decided that everybody should sleep in this

 Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up

 "You'd better hold onto this," she says, handing you the camera,

 Orchid rushes up to Aiden with her fists clenched. "You're lying.
 There's no proof. All you can prove is that you broke into the church
 and tried to scare us."

 "Well, no," says Aiden. "I can prove some other things. I have the

 "But Orchid had this other great idea. She figured if we went a little
 further with the hoax, we could get you to believe the ghost was real.
 Heh."

 "I wasn't trying to trick you!" Orchid pleads. "I just wanted it to be
 authentic. I wanted it to be a great story."

 "Sure, and then the great ghost story would be in the newspaper with
