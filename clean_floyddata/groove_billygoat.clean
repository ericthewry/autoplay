 Call came after midnight.  So it's Sunday--what a black day.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I need you to head down to the bad part of town and check out a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">StepEasy squattin' in the industrial quarter.  Dame across the street</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">said she saw a lady, she thought it shady somehow.   A man came</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">thinks, to her doom.  But listen, can you do this?  I mean with all</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">that happened before--"</span>

 You shook your head as you pushed out of the diner in the quicksilver
 rain.  Hurled the paper to the garbage where it pattered, closed
 yourself in the car.

 Ah, the peace in your automobile before the tension of a case.  You
 enjoy a puff on a cigar and smooth sax on the radio as you drive to
 clear your head.  No even remotely-danceable beats.   The captain
 always said before the prohibition three years ago, "If dancing is a
 crime, then only criminals will have dance moves."  Or something like
 that.

 No suprise they come together in these places in the city.  Every
 other kind of trouble, irrespective, follows quickly.  The
 commissioner usually takes a blind eye to the burnouts who writhe at
 the feet of Muse Terpsichore, but when something happens it's always
 you.  You are the one who knows your the way around the parquet floors
 strewn with broken heels and broken glass.

 Most of these dancing fools are non-violent and out for a good time
 only, but you know how exertion and adrenaline get out of hand.  If
 someone has hurt that lady, you'll definitely collar the perp.  You
 know the exact type of people these madmen are.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bad Part of Town</span>
 Grey and white rain streams down over hard concrete edifices, where it
 goes swirling and shining, reflecting the dingy streetlights as it
 pours into the gutters and then down into the black sewers.  Nobody
 decent comes here, not at this time of night.

 A beat up old trash can with a lid leans against the brownstone steps
 that are gray in the gloom of night.

 You've parked your vehicle to the side of the road.  Not like there's
 any traffic anyway.

 A haggard figure huddles on some steps out of the rain.

 A sign bolted near a gap in a cement wall declares "Outway Only".

>examine figure

 He's likely one of these StepEasy burnouts.  He's got a tin cup that
 he brandishes hopefully at you.

 The bum shakes his tin cup meaningfully.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a dark gray suit (being worn)
   a soaking wet black trenchcoat (being worn)
   your fedora (being worn)
   a chest holster (being worn)
     your gun
   a working knowledge of CPR

 The bum jingles his tin cup meaningfully.

>give CPR to bum

 The bum blinks and looks up, not realizing at first you're talking
 directly to him.

 "I don't know about that." he replies.

 The bum rattles his tin cup meaningfully.

>examine cup

 In the tin cup are some meager coppers.

>shoot bum

 The final order to eliminate all those infected by Muse Terpsichore
 has not been issued yet.

 It's an outway leading from an even darker and seedier part of the
 neighborhood.  One would assume that an Outway would have a
 corresponding Inway, but in these parts of town, sometimes even the
 laws of physics don't apply.

 Nothing under that.

 You open the banged-up trash can, revealing a weird coin.

>examine coin

 It's a weirdly large coin, not of any denomination that spends in
 civilized society.  You wonder if it's some kind of bus token.

>take it

 You confiscate the weird coin.

 The bum indicates his tin cup meaningfully.

>put coin in cup

 You put the weird coin into the tin cup.

 "Thank you, Sir," the old coot says.

 He then stands up and after a quick stretch does a tight series of
 chaine-turns down the sidewalk away from you.  This is followed by a
 perfectly limber grande battement kick that nearly reaches his face,
 and then an intricate sequence of alternating grande jetes, stag
 leaps, and barrel-turns before you lose sight of him down the block.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Poor old geezer's got it bad,</span> you think to yourself.

 Yeah, as if it were that easy.  And besides, it's illegal unless it
 comes about as part of the line of duty in an undercover operation.

 The ground shudders as some explosions occur a block or two away.  You
 shake your head for the old fool--the only thing more dangerous than
 dancing inside is dancing outside.

>dance the forbidden dance

 I only understood you as far as wanting to dance.

>take lid

 The garbage trucks aren't on strike anymore, so this can is empty and
 you could carry it around with you, although you don't know why you
 would.

>enter gap


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Badder Part of Town</span>
 Inside the outway, removed from the normal public streets, is a vast
 complex of warehouses and industrial buildings.  Milky gray rain
 smacks down harder, splashing on the sidewalk.  There are paths in
 almost every direction, although  none looks any more promising than
 the other.

>go east

 You search a ways to the east.  There's nothing here to spark your
 interest.  You could always go back out to the somewhat less-bad part
 of town if you wanted.

 You really feel awkward carrying around this trash can, and set it
 down out of the way to continue its pitiful gray life here.

>kick the can

 Hand to hand combat is never a good idea.

>go west

 You continue further to the west.  Nothing here worthy of your
 attention.  You could always go back out to the somewhat less-bad part
 of town if you wanted.

>go north

 You walk along the buildings to the north.  You encounter nothing here
 seemingly related to your investigation.  You could always go back out
 to the somewhat less-bad part of town if you wanted.

>go south

 You continue in the rainy street to the south.  The search is
 fruitless, as nothing stands out here that catches you in a noteworthy
 fashion.  You could always go back out to the somewhat less-bad part
 of town if you wanted.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bad Part of Town</span>
 Grey and white rain streams down over hard concrete edifices, where it
 goes swirling and shining, reflecting the dingy streetlights as it
 pours into the gutters and then down into the black sewers.

 You've parked your vehicle to the side of the road.

 A sign bolted near a gap in a cement wall declares "Outway Only".

 Your attention is diverted after a storefront second-story window
 screeches open and a rope spirals down almost to the wet pavement--no
 not a rope.  Bedsheets tied together.  You hear young voices inside
 "C'mon Rufus!  Hurry before she hears!"

 "I'm goin' as fast as I can, shut UP Lenny!"

 And then a higher female, "Don't forget about me! I'm Betsy!"

 And with that, three tiny gray youngsters shimmy down in the rain to
 the pavement, pull down the rope of bedsheets, and sprint across the
 street, stopping only when they nearly collide with you.  Two boys and
 a girl, all stare up at you, shocked that there is someone on the
 street at this hour during pouring rain.

 The little girl looks up at you with her wiry braids standing up,
 defying the rain. "Hey Mister, are you a cop?"

 "Well, no...I..." you stammer, hoping to keep your cover, but then...

 You hear some strange jazzy music coming from somewhere...you don't
 know.  The little girl orphan toddles up to you and effortlessly
 climbs you like that ape on the Empire State Building and settles into
 your arms.  The music vamps for a few measures, and she opens her
 mouth...to sing?

>drop girl

 Dropped.

 "Now, come on, little girl, I'm very busy!  You stop that you hear!  I
 don't have time for an entire song!" you say, setting the girl down to
 shut her up.  She humphs up at you puffing her cheeks and making a
 face, turning away to consider what will likely be her future life of
 crime now that you've fostered a hatred of law enforcement in her.

>examine girl

 This poor bedraggled orphan girl wears a battered denim jumper with
 striped long underwear.  Her wiry braids are askew as if she's caught
 an errant blast of wind to the face.

 Betsy sings:
 <span class="floydstyle em">Hey, Mister, you came along and now I'm not so blue!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">I'm singin' a song and now I am here with you!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">I'm tellin' ya, Mister, I'm so glad!  I'm stickin' with you!</span>

 You can't think of anything to sing right now except songs you learned
 in the precinct, and those would <span class="floydstyle em">clearly</span> give away your
 identity as law enforcement.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Hey, Mister, I...am...stickin' with yoooooouuu!</span>

>examine lenny

 Lenny's blond hair is either greased back or perhaps rain-stuck to his
 head, with one long tuft hanging in his face.  You wish you had a pair
 of scissors to snip it off for him.  Otherwise, he's dressed in denim
 overalls and a checked shirt.

 Betsy sings:
 <span class="floydstyle em">My mom and dad, Mister, they left me flat!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">And here you come, in your coat and a hat!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">I wished on a star, Mister!  And here you are, Mister!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Cause I've! Got! A new Dad now!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">And holy wow!  You're stuck with me now!</span>

 Out of nowhere, you hear violins swelling, and out-of-place triumphant
 orchestral brass building anticipatorily.  What the hell?

 "It's him!" shouts Rufus, pointing down the block, where an unearthly
 light as if from a hundred garbage truck headlights grows around the
 corner, casting the shadow of a thin man against the wall. He emerges
 around the corner, his white suit blinding in the golden light,
 surrounded by clouds of mist from a curb grate.

 The sidewalk slab <span class="floydstyle em">lights up</span> as the man steps, and then the
 next one as he steps onto it, only fading after it his shoes have left
 the surface.  <span class="floydstyle em">This can't be... </span>you think, trying to blink the
 mirage from your eyes.

 The man's clothing is immaculately blinding, and his body twitches
 angularly as he makes his way down the block toward you.

 The boys  scamper toward him and receive big hugs in turn, then the
 man spins on his heels and pulls up his trousers at the knee,
 displaying gleaming black shoes topped with white spats.

 He is clearly ill in some way, and you resolve to get him proper help
 in a hospital if he's not your perp.

 Betsy squirms in your grasp.  "IT'S HIM, IT'S HIM!" screams the little
 girl, fighting her way out of your arms, unintentionally planting a
 solid size-two patent leather sole in your jaw as she scrambles down,
 the song forgotten, at least for now as she runs to get a hug from the
 thin man in white.

>examine thin man

 He's tall and thin, wearing a glowing white suit and matching
 black-banded fedora that shadows his eyes.  His body is always seeming
 both frozen in an angular position and in constant motion with part of
 his physique still and the rest moving subtly.

 The mysterious man turns away, and <span class="floydstyle em">now is walking in the opposite</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">direction of his travel. </span> You shake your head, wondering what was
 in that coffee you drank.  He's clearly walking away, but moving
 backwards into the outway.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bad Part of Town</span>
 Grey and white rain streams down over hard concrete edifices, where it
 goes swirling and shining, reflecting the dingy streetlights as it
 pours into the gutters and then down into the black sewers.

 You hear unexpected strains of orchestral music warmups and rehearsal
 pouring out some slightly lit windows from an edifice on the other
 side of the street.

 The dreary gray edifice the orphans climbed down out of is barely
 visible in the opaque gray rain.

 You've parked your vehicle to the side of the road.

 A sign bolted near a gap in a cement wall declares "Outway Only".

 You can also see Betsy, Lenny and Rufus here.

>enter gap

 The three young ragamuffins scramble after you and assemble again in
 an attentive line.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Badder Part of Town</span>
 Inside the outway, removed from the normal public streets, is a vast
 complex of warehouses and industrial buildings.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands aloofly, on a sidewalk tile that
 seems to glow with luminous heat under his shoes.  He does a strangely
 twitchy little kick with his knee bent and repositions his feet.
 Obviously he's one of these people who rolls deep the StepEasy scene
 and can't manage to keep his body from writhing in such a manner.  You
 vaguely wonder if he's the smooth criminal you're looking for.

 A broad security door seems to be the main entrance into the lighted
 warehouse.

 You blink, as you're sure this wasn't here before.  A low, two-story
 warehouse now has hazy golden light streaming out of it.  It appears
 to take up half of the entire block.

 A street sign leans near the entrance, marking the location of the
 StepEasy.

 You can also see Betsy, Lenny, Rufus and a banged-up trash can (empty)
 here.

 The thin man seems to slide to the door of the now active warehouse
 <span class="floydstyle em">without moving his feet in the correct directions somehow</span>
 then pounds on the metal-clad portal.  The slat is thrown open, and
 the man in white seems to hiccup before shouting something, that you
 can only suppose is the word JAMON!

 At this, the door is thrown open and the strange man holds his hat on
 as <span class="floydstyle em">windy golden light blows out the door, surrounding him in a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">smoky halo.  </span>And you've only had one drink today, seriously.

 As quickly as it started, the windy light stops and the man proceeds
 into the StepEasy, the door slamming securely shut behind him.
 "He's so dreamy!" intones young Betsy, swooning.

>enter stepeasy

 You'll need to find a way in somehow.  The first floor windows are a
 bit too high to climb into and have bars over them.

>knock on door

 (the security door)
 You pound on the door.  After a second the slat scratches aside.

 "You gots the passwoid?  Then you say it out loud likea good boy.
 Unkay?" rumbles a deep voice, probably belonging to a very large and
 deadly someone.  After a moment, the slat closes as if it were never
 there.

>jamon

 You pound on the door and intone <span class="floydstyle em">JAMON! </span>as accurately as you
 can.

 There is a pause, and someone says "Waitaminnit..."  The slat closes
 and you hear some back and forth arguing.  Then a longer pause before
 the slat opens again, and a ham sandwich is shoved through the opening
 at you.

>take sandwich

 You already got it.

>examine it

 Yeah, it is a ham sandwich.

>eat it

 You scarf down the nicely-toasted sandwich hungrily.

 The orphans look sad.

>give sandwich to rufus

 "Hey, Mister," says Rufus.

 The orphans quickly accept your sandwich, divide it in thirds with
 mathematical precision, then each hungrily wolfs their portion down.
 "FANKS MIFTER," Betsy says, chewing and swallowing.

 Rufus explains, "Miss Olivia hasn't been feeding us because we've been
 displaying an overabundance of vigour for orphans of our stature."

 "And she spells <span class="floydstyle em">vigour</span> with a U somehow," adds Lenny."

>give sandwich to rufus

 The orphans tear the sandwich into chunks and eat it, much less
 ferociously than before.

 "No, thanks, Mister," Rufus says, patting his stomach.

 "This is more food than we've had in any three-week period," claims
 Lenny.

 "YEAH AND MISS OLIVIA SAYS YOU ASPLODE IF YOU EAT TOO MUCH.  WE DON'T
 WANNA ASPLODE MISTER!" shouts Betsy.

 "Oh wait," says Rufus.  He begins jumping up and down. "I know the
 password!  I know the password!  You're pronouncing it wrong.  It's
 not "jamon," it's <span class="floydstyle em">shamone</span>!"

>shamone

 You shout "SHAMONE!" at the door ferociously, and it flies open,
 buffetting you suddenly with a gale force of golden light that
 explodes out at you.  You lean forward to keep your footing and hold
 your hat as your clothing and trenchcoat whip around in the uncanny
 breeze.  Finally it stops and you blink.  "Sorry," says a deep voice,
 "we been having some A/C problems all week here..."

 You nod somewhat encouragingly to yourself as you step into the
 warehouse.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corner of Warehouse</span>
 The entire warehouse is cleared of its normal furnishings except for
 some support beams, and indigo light arcs in from high semicircular
 barred windows.  The entire place is packed with StepEasy denizens,
 all spastically writhing to the bits of discordant music played by the
 band, dancing and yet pretending not to dance by writhing, remaining
 away from the legal limits of the choreography laws.  It looks like
 you could move through the crowd west and northwest.  The north part
 of the dancefloor from here is really packed and it would probably
 take a molotov cocktail to get in amongst the throng.

 A narrow window in the corner seems to be where clubgoers can check
 their coats.

>check coat

 (the soaking wet black trenchcoat)
 Black, like the recesses of your inner soul.  It's also comfy and
 rain-resistant.

>examine window

 It's a narrow hole in the wall, staffed by a bored-looking young lady.

 In the coat check window is a coat check girl.

>give coat to lady

 (the soaking wet black trenchcoat to the coat check girl)
 "You got something you need checked in?" she says unenthusiastically.

 (first taking the soaking wet black trenchcoat off)
 The girl smartly hangs your coat in the back room and hands you the
 marker for it.  You tip her, and she says "Enjoy yourself."

 A severe looking couple tangos past you, arms interlocked holding
 martini glasses.

>examine marker

 An ebony tag with a hole in it from the coat check.  Number 116.

 A man in a dark suit does a dance solo and is cheered on by the crowd
 around him.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Band Platform</span>
 A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from
 the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second
 floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but
 the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent
 throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The
 warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of
 dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the
 northeast.

 A hush falls over the crowd as they all catch sight of the thin man in
 a spotlight.  He pulls a large coin out of his pocket and flicks it in
 the air, declaring "HOO!"

 The coin hovers, flipping end over end for a second, suspended.  The
 thin man shrieks "EEHEE!" and the coin resumes its path straight into
 the slot of the jukebox.New-fangled, almost unearthly music with a
 heavy, unrelenting beat begins as the needle drops on the record.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands disinterestedly.  His hands move
 furitively over the brim of his white hat and his belt as if
 repositioning them with bird-like speed.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

 You hear the Thin Man shout <span class="floydstyle em">hoo</span> and oddly enough, small
 objects seem to levitate off tables and hover in the air a moment
 before falling down again.

 The intro counts off, and a group of suited men run to the southwest
 corner of the warehouse near the jukebox and line up, ready to dance.
 The Thin Man is in the lead of the formation, singing lyrics that go
 by so fast you can barely understand them.

>examine jukebox.new-fangled

 You can see records trundling inside, but all the selector keys have
 been broken off, so it looks like you get pot-luck for putting your
 coin in the slot.  The plastic dome has a few dents, almost as if it
 has sustained several good hard thumps in its lifetime.

 The dancers PIROUETTE, pull their KNEES IN and they NOD NOD.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>dance

 You groove a little self-consciously for a moment even though your
 attempts feel quite foolish.

 The Thin Man tosses another coin in the air, then shouts <span class="floydstyle em">hoo</span>
 at it, making it hover.  Then he says <span class="floydstyle em">eehee</span> a little louder,
 and the coin goes flying directly into the slot of the jukebox.

 The dancers HEELPIVOT, POINTPOINT and HEADPOP.

>headpop

 You try to make it into the dance formation, but you miss your chance.
 You need to get in right at the beginning to have any chance of
 keeping up.

 The dancers simultaneously JUMPSHRUG, SHOULDERROLL, and HEADPOP, then
 they turn to the southwest, while crossing the floor NORTHEAST,
 penetrating the crowded right dance floor where everyone makes room
 for them.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The dancers LEAN over, hovering at an unnatural angle with their feet
 still on the floor, seemingly defying gravity.  The crowd goes wild,
 and everyone on the dancefloor joins in, somehow knowing what move
 comes next at rapid-fire high speed.

>wait

 Time passes.

 All the dancers JUMPSHRUG and bring their KNEES IN, and they NOD NOD,
 and they HEELPIVOT, POINT POINT.  Then they all do a HEADPOP, and they
 JUMPSHRUG, and they SHOULDERROLL, KNEES IN.  Everyone does a
 HEELPIVOT, POINT POINT and finally STEPSLIDE out of it.
   Solo dances continue excitedly as the formation breaks up.

>jumpshrug

 You can't go that way.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Band Platform</span>
 A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from
 the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second
 floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but
 the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent
 throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The
 warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of
 dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the
 northeast.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands at a weird angle.  He points a
 finger up into the sky while looking away from it in the opposite
 direction for seemingly no reason.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

 You hear whooping, and a floozy dancer is launched into the air, does
 a high flip, and is caught and carried along by the crowd.

>headpop

 You can't go that way.

 A man and woman jive relentlessly near you before disappearing into
 the crowd.

>dance

 You step-touch to no particular beat whatsoever, feeling suddenly very
 caucasian.

 The Thin Man shouts <span class="floydstyle em">whoa</span> as he balances on his toes for a
 surprisingly long time, almost as if gravity has no effect.

>go southwest

 You can't go that way.

>go northeast

 That corner of the dance floor is jam-packed.  You'll need to find a a
 more clever way in there.

 A woman is thrown around her partner's back jitterbug style.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Left Dancefloor</span>
 Spotlights operated by mysterious figures overhead pick out the most
 risque dancers on this parquet square of premium dance space that
 continues to the east.  The band is south, and the warehouse exit is
 southeast.  The even better dancers pack the floor to the east, and
 you're unsure if you could get through there to where that staircase
 leading up is.

 You notice a dim passage also to the west.

 A gray-suited thug comes up behind the Thin Man taps him, and swings a
 roundhouse punch when he turns.  The Thin Man easily deflects it, then
 shouts <span class="floydstyle em">aaow</span>.  The thug is hurled back by unseen hands...like
 the Thin Man punched him with his <span class="floydstyle em">mind</span>!...

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dim Passage</span>
 This dim, slickly light green-painted corridor leads south and east
 back to the dancefloor.  There is some lettering stencilled on the
 wall.

 A large man wearing thick glasses and sitting on what must be the
 worlds most tiny, uncomfortable stool glares dimly at you with his
 arms folded.

>examine wall

 It says "Employees Only".

>talk to m an

 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to man

 You say hello to the dim bouncer.

>take stool

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine man

 He looks very likely like he could squeeze your neck until you pop
 like a grape that is having its neck squeezed by a very large, person.

>go west

 You can't go that way.

>go south

 The bouncer says "Wisten bub.  I'm watching that office, and I see you
 headed in that diwection.  Beat it."

>beat it

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>dance

 Seriously, you haven't heard any drones overhead, but it's best not to
 risk it.

>go east

 "Enjoy your evening in the cwub!" exclaims the dim bouncer, waving.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Band Platform</span>
 A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from
 the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second

 the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent
 throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The
 warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of
 dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the
 northeast.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands aloofly.  He adjusts his trousers
 near his crotch seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is in public
 whilst pointing the thumb, index finger and pinky of his free hand off
 to the side.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

 The Thin Man does this crazy thing with his feet - it appears he walks
 in one direction, but his direction of travel is usually opposite.
 Like he's walking somewhere with no gravity.  Like the moon for
 example.

>examine jukebox

 You can see records trundling inside, but all the selector keys have
 been broken off, so it looks like you get pot-luck for putting your
 coin in the slot.  The plastic dome has a few dents, almost as if it
 has sustained several good hard thumps in its lifetime.

>hit jukebox

 You thump hard on the jukebox dome.  Heyyyyy.... Surprisingly, this
 works, and the contraption lights up and selects a record.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 The music from the jukebox is otherworldly and incredibly
 pulse-pounding.

 The intro counts off, and a group of suited men run to the southwest
 corner of the warehouse near the jukebox and line up, ready to dance.
 The Thin Man is in the lead of the formation, singing lyrics that go
 by so fast you can barely understand them.

>PIROUETTE


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">First Beat</span>

 You roll your shoulders best you can while traveling in one direction
 without tripping and remembering to look in the opposite correct

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Flourish</span>
 Everyone pops their head and freezes for a moment, before sharply
 turning their bodies southwest.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Approaching Dancefloor</span>
 A huge round of applause greets the crossing formation.  Somehow
 everyone in your dance formation meshes with the people on the
 dancefloor to form a much larger and complicated arrangement.
 The thin man is singing the lead vocal to the song.  You don't know
 what the words blazing by actually are, but you try to sing along
 anyway-<span class="floydstyle em">"...betty crocker took a car-load...to the drive-in...where</span>

 The dancefloor clears a space as you and the group of suited dancers

 You hold your breath and close your eyes and lean forward.
 Unbelieveably when you open your eyes, you are staring straight down
 at the floor!  Your feet haven't moved, and you're leaning at the same
 impossible angle as everyone else is!
 The Thin Man:<span class="floydstyle em">"...timmy grable did a favor...for the flavor...of</span>

 Everyone on the dancefloor joins in and dances in ridiculous speedy

 You are bludgeoned by flying arms and legs as you fall out of sync
 with the rest of the dancers and end up having to crawl out of the
 formation...


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corner of Warehouse</span>
 The entire warehouse is cleared of its normal furnishings except for
 some support beams, and indigo light arcs in from high semicircular
 barred windows.  The entire place is packed with StepEasy denizens,
 all spastically writhing to the bits of discordant music played by the
 band, dancing and yet pretending not to dance by writhing, remaining
 away from the legal limits of the choreography laws.  It looks like
 you could move through the crowd west and northwest.  The north part
 of the dancefloor from here is really packed and it would probably
 take a molotov cocktail to get in amongst the throng.

 A narrow window in the corner seems to be where clubgoers can check
 their coats.

 The coat check girl looks at you disdainfully.  "This your first time
 honey?  We all been there" she remarks.

 Everybody grooves down low to the floor as the music gets a little
 softer now.

>STEPSLIDE


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Right Dancefloor</span>
 You lean against a pillar, panting, unbelievably proud of yourself
 that you made it through the entire dance number.  The surge of
 adrenaline is intoxicating.  You understand how easy it could be to
 fall into the lowlife scene of back-alley dancehalls and bathtub
 sarsaparilla.  You can barely think in the hot, sweaty crush of
 writhing dancers.  You are forced into some gymnastic positions and
 movements just to keep your feet on the floor.  You could climb up a
 metal fire escape staircase that leads to the second floor walkway.
 The warehouse exit is south, the band platform is southwest, and the
 less-crowded section of dancefloor is east.

>go up

 You leap onto the fire escape stairs and climb up to the walkway,
 where there is a door that leads out of the sweltering humidity of the
 nightclub into the cool blue-gray night.  As you are making your way
 through, you hear a guttural shout from below--the lights change, and
 all the dancers move in slow motion.  They writhe in a tight knot
 around the Thin Man, exclaiming random words and syllables and sounds
 in either wracking pain, desperation, or delirious ecstacy as the
 downside of Muse Terpsichore takes them out of their heads.

 Such are the results of a continuous life of dance-crime, you reckon
 sadly to yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warehouse Rooftop</span>
 You're on top of the warehouse where it has stopped raining, but a
 cool breeze ripples the puddles of rain that have accumulated.  To
 your left, (the west that is) is the entrance to a shabby rooftop
 flat.  To the north there is barely a step up onto the wide, low wall
 that surrounds the edge of the building.  Between that and the gravel
 rooftop of the other building to the north is a sickening, likely
 fatal, plunge.

>plunge

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Her Apartment</span>
 A standard tiny two-room flat, much tidier on the inside than out.
 The furnishings are spare, if neatly kept.  There is minimal damage
 except to the window where the perp likely entered, and the carpet
 which is painted with darkening red bloodstains.  The bedroom is west
 from here, and you can exit to the east.

 With a commotion, the trio of orphans attempt to invade the crime
 scene, jibberjabbering about candy and jump ropes and other orphan
 things.

 "Kids, stay, back, there's nothing to see here!  Nothing at all!" you
 insist, pushing them towards the door.

 "Hey, wait," Lenny says, peering around you. "Are those bloodstains?
 On the carpet?"

 "We need to check on Miss Annie," Rufus proclaims.  "She's our friend
 who was trying to help us get out of the orphanage!"

 "ANNIE?  ARE YOU OKAY?" bellows Betsy as you push them finally out the
 door again.

 An oddly narrow aquarium sits on a side table.

 You can also see a carpet (on which are some bloodstains) here.

>arrest orphans

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine aquarim

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine aquarium

 Wait, it's not an aquarium, rather it's an ant farm.  But you find it
 to be surprisingly out of place in the apartment of a young woman.

>examine ant farm

 The ants have a very structured society with citizen ants and police
 ants, and down low you notice ants dancing in tight choreographic
 formations led by one tiny ant with a white hat who seems to move a
 bit spastically.

>dance

 Yeah, as if it were that easy.

>examine blood

 Apparently the victim was struck down, as aforementioned, likely to
 her doom.  The stains lead west into the bedroom where the victim
 likely attempted to evade her attacker.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 A tiny bedroom, filled with one tiny twin bed and a rack with some
 ladies clothing hung up to dry.

 A small, barred window prevents people from breaking in, too bad there
 weren't bars on the other living room window.

 The body of a woman lies on the floor at the end of a few blood
 spatters on the carpet.  It appears she was attempting to crawl under
 the bed to protect herself when she was struck down.

 You hear some climbing noises and the orphans climb monkey-like at the
 bars of the window, staring in.  "Listen, kids, this is a crime scene,
 you need to get away from there this instant!"  Of course they don't
 pay attention.

 "That's Miss Annie, is she all right?" Rufus asks.

 "She doesn't look good," Lenny observes.

 "ARE YOU OKAY MISS ANNIE?" Betsy hollers loud enough to be audible in
 heaven.

 "Annie, are you okay?" Rufus says.

>poke annie

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine annie

 Annie is petite, and well put together, wearing a prim blue dress.
 It's obvious if she is into the StepEasy scene, she hasn't been there
 long.  You'd almost bet she's fresh off the bus from Idaho or Nebraska
 or Kentucky.  One of those kinds of places..You're not sure there's
 much you can do for her.  You don't feel a pulse and her pupils are
 unresponsive.

 "Are you okay?" Lenny says.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your marker
   a ham sandwich
   a dark gray suit (being worn)
   your fedora (being worn)
   a chest holster (being worn)
     your gun
   a working knowledge of CPR

 "ARE YOU OKAY, ANNIE???" hollers Betsy.

>perform cpr

 What do you want to perform cpr on?

>perform cpr annie

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>perform cpr on annie

 Feeling rather foolish you move your mouth to the lifeless woman's.
 <span class="floydstyle em">mouth-to-mouth resuscitation...</span>
  you think as you press your lips to her cold flesh.

 Then you feel the very breath from your body illuminate and exhale
 into her.  From below there are roiling violins and hopeful trumpets
 as wind...now magic and golden...surrounds you both in a violent
 vortex or a full orchestral score that stands Annie up on her feet.
 And she is alive again, blinking curiously.

 "YAAAAAAAY!" shout the orphans, seeing Annie conscious again.

 "Miss Annie," you say, not knowing what else to ask, "are you...okay?"

 "Yes, I'm fine!" she says, wobbling a bit stiffly.  "And the children
 are here, so everything is perfect!  Now if I can just make us a cup
 of tea-"

 She doesn't get to make that cup of tea because she is interrupted by
 the thin screams of the orphans as black-gloved hands pull them away
 from the bars of the window and make off with them.

 "Oh no!" Annie exclaims.  "They've taken the orphans!  Mister!  You've
 got to help them!"

 Outside the apartment you hear shoes on cement and the definite
 clatter of steel weaponry.  Annie grabs your arm, "Don't go out
 there!"

 "Don't worry," you say calmly reaching for your .38. "I can handle
 this."  You glance out the window as your fingers close around air.
 Your gun is gone.  Oh, nuts.

 Annie races to the front room of the apartment and you hear her
 shriek.  A thug in an indigo suit has grabbed both her wrists.  You
 run out and grapple with the thug for two seconds before Annie brings
 him down with a solid smash to the head with a ceramic emu from her
 collection.

 "That was my <span class="floydstyle em">grandmother's</span> you creep!" she hisses.  You hear
 more commotion outside.

 You can see a carpet (on which are some bloodstains) and an alien ant
 farm here.

 "Get out of my sight you exceedingly mean people!" Annie growls,
 grabbing a china saucer and hurling out the door at the thugs outside.

 You hear grumbling and random bursts of machine-gun fire from the
 thugs on the rooftop.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to look outside.

 You can hear the orphans screaming from the rooftop just to the north,
 adjacent to the one  you are on.  Their voices echo from behind a red
 and gray door set in a rooftop building with a smokestack that pours
 dark coal dust.

 "What are we going to do?" Annie asks, crouching low.
 Annie frowns, "Don't you have some kind of secret weapon?"

 You hear grumbling and random bursts of machine-gun fire from the
 thugs on the rooftop.

>examine marker

 An ebony tag with a hole in it from the coat check.  Number 116.

 "Get out of here you freaks of nature!" Annie calls, grabbing a
 antique cherub statue and chucking out the door at the thugs outside.

 You hear grumbling and random bursts of machine-gun fire from the
 thugs on the rooftop.

>examine holster

 It holds your piece at the ready just inside your jacket, and isn't
 visible under normal outerwear.

 "Get out of here you mama's boy!" Annie screams, grabbing a crystal
 napkin ring and hurling out the window at the thugs outside.

 You hear grumbling and random bursts of machine-gun fire from the
 thugs on the rooftop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 A tiny bedroom, filled with one tiny twin bed and a rack with some
 ladies clothing hung up to dry.

 A small, barred window prevents people from breaking in.

 You hear grumbling and random bursts of machine-gun fire from the
 thugs on the rooftop.

 In the barred window are Betsy, Lenny and Rufus.

 You hear grumbling and random bursts of machine-gun fire from the

>examine lenny

 Lenny's blond hair is either greased back or perhaps rain-stuck to his
 head, with one long tuft hanging in his face.  Otherwise, he's dressed
 in denim overalls and a checked shirt.

 You hear grumbling and random bursts of machine-gun fire from the
 thugs on the rooftop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Her Apartment</span>
 A standard tiny two-room flat, much tidier on the inside than out.
 The furnishings are spare, if neatly kept.  There is minimal damage
 except to the window where the perp likely entered, and the carpet
 which is painted with darkening red bloodstains.  The bedroom is west
 from here, and you can exit to the east.

 Miss Annie wrings her hands concernedly.

 You can also see a carpet (on which are some bloodstains) here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warehouse Rooftop</span>
 You're on top of the warehouse where it has stopped raining, but a
 cool breeze ripples the puddles of rain that have accumulated.  To
 your left, (the west that is) is the entrance to a shabby rooftop
 flat.  To the north there is barely a step up onto the wide, low wall
 that surrounds the edge of the building.  Between that and the gravel
 rooftop of the other building to the north is a sickening, likely
 fatal, plunge.

 You can see a Chartreuse Thug, a Green Thug, a Blue Thug and a Red
 Thug here.

 The Red Thug sprays a rattle of machine-gun fire across the rooftop.

 The pane is smashed, likely creating quite a crescendo as the criminal

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Right Dancefloor</span>
 You can barely think in the hot, sweaty crush of writhing dancers.
 You are forced into some gymnastic positions and movements just to
 keep your feet on the floor.  You could climb up a metal fire escape
 staircase that leads to the second floor walkway.  The warehouse exit
 is south, the band platform is southwest, and the less-crowded section
 of dancefloor is east.

>go up

 You leap onto the fire escape stairs and climb up to the walkway,
 where there is a door that leads out of the sweltering humidity of the
 nightclub into the cool blue-gray night.  As you are making your way
 through, you hear a guttural shout from below--the lights change, and
 all the dancers move in slow motion.  They writhe in a tight knot
 around the Thin Man, exclaiming random words and syllables and sounds
 in either wracking pain, desperation, or delirious ecstacy as the
 downside of Muse Terpsichore takes them out of their heads.

 Such are the results of a continuous life of dance-crime, you reckon
 sadly to yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corner of Warehouse</span>
 The entire warehouse is cleared of its normal furnishings except for
 some support beams, and indigo light arcs in from high semicircular
 barred windows.  The entire place is packed with StepEasy denizens,
 all spastically writhing to the bits of discordant music played by the
 band, dancing and yet pretending not to dance by writhing, remaining
 away from the legal limits of the choreography laws.  It looks like
 you could move through the crowd west and northwest.  The north part
 of the dancefloor from here is really packed and it would probably
 take a molotov cocktail to get in amongst the throng.

 A narrow window in the corner seems to be where clubgoers can check
 their coats.

 Everybody grooves down low to the floor as the music gets a little
 softer now.

 "You got something you need checked in?" she says unenthusiastically.

 "Ah, yes, I'll get that for you right away, Sir," the girl says,

 damp.

 Futile.

 A group electric slides around you as you try to avoid getting kicked.

 The Thin Man moonwalks past in the background, pointing with his one
 right glove.

 "Evening," you say, as the Thin Man turns his birdlike attention to
 you.

 You will need to move further to the outside to reach that.

 Two athletic dancers whirl and dip impressively.

 A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from

 floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but
 the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent
 throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The
 warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of
 dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the

 The oddly-thin man in white stands disinterestedly.  He does a
 strangely twitchy little kick with his knee bent and repositions his
 feet.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

 A brown-suited man backflips across the dancefloor as people move out
 of the way.

>turn off jukebox

 You hear the Thin Man shout <span class="floydstyle em">hoo</span> and oddly enough, small

 He's tall and thin, wearing a glowing white suit and matching
 black-banded fedora that shadows his eyes.  His body is always seeming
 both frozen in an angular position and in constant motion with part of
 his physique still and the rest moving subtly.

 The Thin Man shouts <span class="floydstyle em">whoa</span> as he balances on his toes for a
 surprisingly long time, almost as if gravity has no effect.

 The dancers HEELPIVOT, POINTPOINT and HEADPOP.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands at a weird angle.  His hands move
 furitively over the brim of his white hat and his belt as if
 repositioning them with bird-like speed.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall pounding out extremely dense, complicated, bass-heavy
 music that makes your joints twitch involuntarily and, disturbingly,
 your rear-end tingle.  You don't recognize the song, but the lyrics
 are too fast and don't make a lot of sense.  It seems to be perfectly
 tailor-made for mindless dancing.  You'd prefer some orchestral Brahms
 or, if feeling frisky, nothing more wild than a slightly up-tempo
 polka if you please.

 The dancers simultaneously JUMPSHRUG, SHOULDERROLL, and HEADPOP, then
 they turn to the southwest, while crossing the floor NORTHEAST,
 penetrating the crowded right dance floor where everyone makes room
 for them.

>examine band

 (the band equipment)
 Some very sluggish musicians occasionally play an atonal phrase on a
 saxophone or a clarinet, but the music doesn't make sense.

 The dancers LEAN over, hovering at an unnatural angle with their feet
 still on the floor, seemingly defying gravity.  The crowd goes wild,
 and everyone on the dancefloor joins in, somehow knowing what move
 comes next at rapid-fire high speed.

 A gray-suited thug comes up behind the Thin Man taps him, and swings a

 continues to the east.  The band is south, and the warehouse exit is
 southeast.  The even better dancers pack the floor to the east, and
 you're unsure if you could get through there to where that staircase
 leading up is.

 You notice a dim passage also to the west.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Band Platform</span>
 A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from
 the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second
 floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but
 the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent
 throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The
 warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of
 dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the
 northeast.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands at a weird angle.  He does a
 strangely twitchy little kick with his knee bent and repositions his
 feet.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

 You hear the Thin Man shout <span class="floydstyle em">hoo</span> and oddly enough, small
 objects seem to levitate off tables and hover in the air a moment
 before falling down again.

>hit jukebox

 You thump hard on the jukebox dome.  Heyyyyy.... Surprisingly, this
 works, and the contraption lights up and selects a record.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 The music from the jukebox is otherworldly and incredibly
 pulse-pounding.

 The intro counts off, and a group of suited men run to the southwest
 corner of the warehouse near the jukebox and line up, ready to dance.
 The Thin Man is in the lead of the formation, singing lyrics that go
 by so fast you can barely understand them.

>PIROUETTE


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">First Beat</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sixth Beat</span>

 You all jumpshrug in tight formation.  The direction changes are

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eighth Beat</span>
 You roll your shoulders best you can while traveling in one direction
 without tripping and remembering to look in the opposite correct

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Flourish</span>
 Everyone pops their head and freezes for a moment, before sharply
 turning their bodies southwest.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Approaching Dancefloor</span>
 A huge round of applause greets the crossing formation.  Somehow
 everyone in your dance formation meshes with the people on the
 dancefloor to form a much larger and complicated arrangement.
 The thin man is singing the lead vocal to the song.  You don't know
 what the words blazing by actually are, but you try to sing along
 anyway-<span class="floydstyle em">"...betty crocker took a car-load...to the drive-in...where</span>

 You hold your breath and close your eyes and lean forward.
 Unbelieveably when you open your eyes, you are staring straight down
 at the floor!  Your feet haven't moved, and you're leaning at the same
 impossible angle as everyone else is!
 The Thin Man:<span class="floydstyle em">"...timmy grable did a favor...for the flavor...of</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Right Dancefloor</span>
 You can barely think in the hot, sweaty crush of writhing dancers.
 You are forced into some gymnastic positions and movements just to
 keep your feet on the floor.  You could climb up a metal fire escape
 staircase that leads to the second floor walkway.  The warehouse exit
 is south, the band platform is southwest, and the less-crowded section
 of dancefloor is east.

 Everyone puts their hands on their hips and pulls their knees in
 tight.

 You can't go that way.

>go up

 You leap onto the fire escape stairs and climb up to the walkway,
 where there is a door that leads out of the sweltering humidity of the
 nightclub into the cool blue-gray night.  As you are making your way
 through, you hear a guttural shout from below--the lights change, and
 all the dancers move in slow motion.  They writhe in a tight knot
 around the Thin Man, exclaiming random words and syllables and sounds
 in either wracking pain, desperation, or delirious ecstacy as the
 downside of Muse Terpsichore takes them out of their heads.

 Such are the results of a continuous life of dance-crime, you reckon
 sadly to yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warehouse Rooftop</span>
 You're on top of the warehouse where it has stopped raining, but a
 cool breeze ripples the puddles of rain that have accumulated.  To
 your left, (the west that is) is the entrance to a shabby rooftop
 flat.  To the north there is barely a step up onto the wide, low wall
 that surrounds the edge of the building.  Between that and the gravel
 rooftop of the other building to the north is a sickening, likely
 fatal, plunge.

 You can see some flying bullets, a Chartreuse Thug, a Green Thug, a
 Blue Thug and a Red Thug here.

 You have to duck into the apartment to avoid getting filled with hot
 lead.  You hurl yourself back inside as shrapnel clatters into the
 apartment wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Her Apartment</span>

 You can barely think in the hot, sweaty crush of writhing dancers.
 You are forced into some gymnastic positions and movements just to
 keep your feet on the floor.  You could climb up a metal fire escape
 staircase that leads to the second floor walkway.  The warehouse exit
 is south, the band platform is southwest, and the less-crowded section
 of dancefloor is east.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands aloofly.  His hands move furitively
 over the brim of his white hat and his belt as if repositioning them
 with bird-like speed.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

 The Thin Man tosses another coin in the air, then shouts <span class="floydstyle em">hoo</span>
 at it, making it hover.  Then he says <span class="floydstyle em">eehee</span> a little louder,
 and the coin goes flying directly into the slot of the jukebox.


 (thin man)
 He's tall and thin, wearing a glowing white suit and matching
 black-banded fedora that shadows his eyes.  His body is always seeming
 both frozen in an angular position and in constant motion with part of
 his physique still and the rest moving subtly.

 The dancers PIROUETTE, pull their KNEES IN and they NOD NOD.


 (the dark gray suit)
 It's dark gray, so as to be inconspicuous without being so dark as to
 cause panic in people you interact with.  It's also a size or two
 larger than you need, in case you need to become a man of action at
 any given moment.

 The dancers HEELPIVOT, POINTPOINT and HEADPOP.


 It's spotless, despite him being in the rain without a coat.

 The dancers simultaneously JUMPSHRUG, SHOULDERROLL, and HEADPOP, then
 they turn to the southwest, while crossing the floor NORTHEAST,
 penetrating the crowded right dance floor where everyone makes room
 for them.


 You can see records trundling inside, but all the selector keys have
 been broken off, so it looks like you get pot-luck for putting your
 coin in the slot.  The plastic dome has a few dents, almost as if it
 has sustained several good hard thumps in its lifetime.

 The dancers LEAN over, hovering at an unnatural angle with their feet
 still on the floor, seemingly defying gravity.  The crowd goes wild,
 and everyone on the dancefloor joins in, somehow knowing what move
 comes next at rapid-fire high speed.

>get jukebox

 That's fixed in place.

 All the dancers JUMPSHRUG and bring their KNEES IN, and they NOD NOD,
 and they HEELPIVOT, POINT POINT.  Then they all do a HEADPOP, and they

   Solo dances continue excitedly as the formation breaks up.

 direction for seemingly no reason.

 Everyone pelvic thrusts suggestively around you, and the crowd goes

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dim Passage</span>
 This dim, slickly light green-painted corridor leads south and east
 back to the dancefloor.  There is some lettering stencilled on the
 wall.

 A large man wearing thick glasses and sitting on what must be the
 worlds most tiny, uncomfortable stool glares dimly at you with his
 arms folded.


 The bouncer says "Wisten bub.  I'm watching that office, and I see you
 headed in that diwection.  Just beat it, beat it hoo."


 What do you want to moonwalk?


 You should try moonwalking the opposite of the direction you intend to
 travel.


 You shiftily transfer your weight and push with your toes so that it
 appears you are walking north while moving south.

 You afford the dim bouncer a friendly nod as you scrape your way
 backward, southward...into the office while facing north the entire
 time.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Office</span>
 This makeshift office appears to be where the club payroll and work

 A blue beam of light shines down on the desk.

 In the blue beam of light is a different marker.

 You take the different marker into evidence even though you don't have

 Your feet suddenly leave the ground as the dim bouncer picks you up by
 the neck and squeezes.  "Wissen pow," he growls.  "I told you to beat
 it!  And despite my extweme neawsightedness, I can see the mawker is
 gone.  So now I'm gonna beat you!"  Which he then proceeds to do, in
 grand and professional fashion.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corner of Warehouse</span>
 The entire warehouse is cleared of its normal furnishings except for
 some support beams, and indigo light arcs in from high semicircular
 barred windows.  The entire place is packed with StepEasy denizens,
 all spastically writhing to the bits of discordant music played by the
 band, dancing and yet pretending not to dance by writhing, remaining
 away from the legal limits of the choreography laws.  It looks like
 you could move through the crowd west and northwest.  The north part
 of the dancefloor from here is really packed and it would probably
 take a molotov cocktail to get in amongst the throng.

 A narrow window in the corner seems to be where clubgoers can check
 their coats.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Band Platform</span>
 A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from
 the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second
 floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but
 the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent
 throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The
 warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of
 dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the
 northeast.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands at a weird angle.  He adjusts his
 trousers near his crotch seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is in
 public whilst pointing the thumb, index finger and pinky of his free
 hand off to the side.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corner of Warehouse</span>
 The entire warehouse is cleared of its normal furnishings except for
 some support beams, and indigo light arcs in from high semicircular
 barred windows.  The entire place is packed with StepEasy denizens,
 all spastically writhing to the bits of discordant music played by the
 band, dancing and yet pretending not to dance by writhing, remaining
 away from the legal limits of the choreography laws.  It looks like
 you could move through the crowd west and northwest.  The north part
 of the dancefloor from here is really packed and it would probably
 take a molotov cocktail to get in amongst the throng.

 A narrow window in the corner seems to be where clubgoers can check
 their coats.

 Some dancers writhe on the catwalk above, silhouetted in the flashing
 lights.


 "You got something you need checked in?" she says unenthusiastically.

 "Ah, yes, I'll get that for you right away, Sir," the girl says,
 disappearing into the plush collection.
 The girl returns holding out a white glove between two fingers.  "I've
 got to apologize that I don't have your coat sir, but instead it seems
 to have gone missing somewhere, but I'm happy to return to you this.
 This glove," she says, dropping it on the sill.  "Personally that's
 the reason I don't check <span class="floydstyle em">anything</span> but coats, because who's
 the first person they're gonna come lookin' for once somethin' turns
 up missing?..."  She continues talking but you can't hear the rest as
 she organizes some boxes of shoes out of your view.

 A thug in a maroon suit stage-dives from the catwalk and is caught and
 carried on the crowd below.

 A gray-suited thug comes up behind the Thin Man taps him, and swings a
 roundhouse punch when he turns.  The Thin Man easily deflects it, then
 shouts <span class="floydstyle em">aaow</span>.  The thug is hurled back by unseen hands...like
 the Thin Man punched him with his <span class="floydstyle em">mind</span>!...


 (the left white glove)
 You put on the left white glove.


 "AAOW!" you scream as a wave of energy thunders around you, rattling
 things that aren't nailed down.

 You hear whooping, and a floozy dancer is launched into the air, does
 a high flip, and is caught and carried along by the crowd.

 The Thin Man does this crazy thing with his feet - it appears he walks
 in one direction, but his direction of travel is usually opposite.
 Like he's walking somewhere with no gravity.  Like the moon for
 example.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Left Dancefloor</span>
 Spotlights operated by mysterious figures overhead pick out the most
 risque dancers on this parquet square of premium dance space that
 continues to the east.  The band is south, and the warehouse exit is
 southeast.  The even better dancers pack the floor to the east, and
 you're unsure if you could get through there to where that staircase
 leading up is.

 You notice a dim passage also to the west.

 Everyone pelvic thrusts suggestively around you, and the crowd goes
 insane.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Band Platform</span>
 A combo band and a microphone is set up in the opposite corner from
 the warehouse entrance.  From here, you notice that there is a second
 floor walkway that would seem to lead to an upstairs apartment, but
 the fire-escape-like stairs are right in the middle of that violent
 throng of dancers in the northeast corner of the building.  The
 warehouse entrance is to the east, there's a less-crowded section of
 dancefloor to the north, and a jam-packed throng of dancers to the
 northeast.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands aloofly.  He does a strangely
 twitchy little kick with his knee bent and repositions his feet.

 A new-fangled music machine you've heard called a "jukebox" sits here
 against the wall.

 A woman is thrown around her partner's back jitterbug style.


 You thump hard on the jukebox dome.  Heyyyyy.... Surprisingly, this
 works, and the contraption lights up and selects a record.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 The music from the jukebox is otherworldly and incredibly
 pulse-pounding.

 The Thin Man moonwalks past in the background, pointing with his one
 right glove.

 The intro counts off, and a group of suited men run to the southwest
 corner of the warehouse near the jukebox and line up, ready to dance.
 The Thin Man is in the lead of the formation, singing lyrics that go
 by so fast you can barely understand them.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">First Beat</span>
 Here goes nothing.  You whirl around with the dancers and land right
 in the middle of the dance formation.  Without even thinking, you pull
 your

 Wow, you're really doing this?



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Second Beat</span>
 Your knees pull together tightly and without hesitation you



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Third Beat</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fourth Beat</span>
 The only thing you can do after that fast of a spin is

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fifth Beat</span>
 You get both directional points in, and instantly remember to



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sixth Beat</span>
 The headpops are ridiculously sharp and you apologize to your
 chiropractor silently as you and the other dancers line yourself up in
 a diagonal with the right dancefloor.  While starting the traveling
 cross you have to



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Seventh Beat</span>
 You all jumpshrug in tight formation.  The direction changes are
 ridiculous, but you continue to



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eighth Beat</span>
 You roll your shoulders best you can while traveling in one direction
 without tripping and remembering to look in the opposite correct
 direciton with everyone else.  The dance phrase ends with



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Flourish</span>
 Everyone pops their head and freezes for a moment, before sharply
 turning their bodies southwest.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Approaching Dancefloor</span>
 A huge round of applause greets the crossing formation.  Somehow
 everyone in your dance formation meshes with the people on the
 dancefloor to form a much larger and complicated arrangement.
 The thin man is singing the lead vocal to the song.  You don't know
 what the words blazing by actually are, but you try to sing along
 anyway-<span class="floydstyle em">"...betty crocker took a car-load...to the drive-in...where</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">they ate spumoni..."</span>
 The dancefloor clears a space as you and the group of suited dancers



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bridge</span>
 You hold your breath and close your eyes and lean forward.
 Unbelieveably when you open your eyes, you are staring straight down
 at the floor!  Your feet haven't moved, and you're leaning at the same
 impossible angle as everyone else is!
 The Thin Man:<span class="floydstyle em">"...timmy grable did a favor...for the flavor...of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">rice a roni..."</span>
 Everyone on the dancefloor joins in and dances in ridiculous speedy
 precision.  Once again you



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Dance One</span>
 The entire dancefloor jumpshrugs in unison <span class="floydstyle em">...greta garbo was</span>

 Whoops, that's not right...OW OUCH!


 You are bludgeoned by flying arms and legs as you fall out of sync
 with the rest of the dancers and end up having to crawl out of the
 formation...

 The coat check girl looks at you disdainfully.  "This your first time
 honey?  We all been there" she remarks.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Dance Four</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Big Dance Five</span>
 ...point point...and finally "...<span class="floydstyle em">some groove billygoat!"</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em"></span>...there's only one move left!



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Right Dancefloor</span>
 You can barely think in the hot, sweaty crush of writhing dancers.
 You are forced into some gymnastic positions and movements just to
 keep your feet on the floor.  You could climb up a metal fire escape
 staircase that leads to the second floor walkway.  The warehouse exit
 is south, the band platform is southwest, and the less-crowded section
 of dancefloor is east.

 You hear the Thin Man shout <span class="floydstyle em">hoo</span> and oddly enough, small
 objects seem to levitate off tables and hover in the air a moment
 before falling down again.


 You leap onto the fire escape stairs and climb up to the walkway,
 where there is a door that leads out of the sweltering humidity of the
 nightclub into the cool blue-gray night.  As you are making your way
 through, you hear a guttural shout from below--the lights change, and
 all the dancers move in slow motion.  They writhe in a tight knot
 around the Thin Man, exclaiming random words and syllables and sounds
 in either wracking pain, desperation, or delirious ecstacy as the
 downside of Muse Terpsichore takes them out of their heads.

 Such are the results of a continuous life of dance-crime, you reckon
 sadly to yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warehouse Rooftop</span>
 You're on top of the warehouse where it has stopped raining, but a
 cool breeze ripples the puddles of rain that have accumulated.  To
 your left, (the west that is) is the entrance to a shabby rooftop
 flat.  To the north there is barely a step up onto the wide, low wall
 that surrounds the edge of the building.  Between that and the gravel
 rooftop of the other building to the north is a sickening, likely
 fatal, plunge.

 You can see some flying bullets, an alien ant farm, a Chartreuse Thug,
 a Green Thug, a Blue Thug and a Red Thug here.

 You have to duck into the apartment to avoid getting filled with hot
 lead.  You hurl yourself back inside as shrapnel clatters into the
 apartment wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Her Apartment</span>
 A standard tiny two-room flat, much tidier on the inside than out.
 The furnishings are spare, if neatly kept.  There is minimal damage
 except to the window where the perp likely entered, and the carpet
 which is painted with darkening red bloodstains.  The bedroom is west
 from here, and you can exit to the east.

 Miss Annie wrings her hands concernedly.

 You can also see a carpet (on which are some bloodstains) here.

 The Red Thug, the Green Thug, the Blue Thug, the Chartreuse Thug and

 where they disappear in nonlethal puff of multicolored smoke.

 You catch your breath.  They seem to have stopped attacking for now.
 You hear Betsy yelling "Mister!" from the north still.


 You leap onto the low wall at the edge of the building thinking you
 can jump it, but you lose your nerve at the last second, and there is
 a sickening moment of dread as you pinwheel your arms to keep balance.
 You finally manage to fall back onto the rooftop, heart pounding.


 You stand up on the low wall of the roof, close your eyes and
 concentrate, thinking "<span class="floydstyle em">whoa</span>" as intensely as you can,
 standing up on your tiptoes.  There is a rush of wind and when you
 open your eyes...you are across the gap!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Snowy Rooftop</span>
 Inexplicably, the rain has turned to fluffy snow that piles around
 like drifts of cake frosting.  There is a low building here, which
 must be where the children are being held.  Before you can charge in,
 the door opens up and Annie walks out holding hands with Lenny and
 Rufus and Betsy.

 "Annie, how did you get across--I thought the children were in
 danger?"

 "No danger," Annie says, shaking her hair as her features morph into
 that of the Thin Man.  You stand, jaw agape, not comprehending.
 "Things aren't always what they seem," says the Thin Man, putting his
 fingers to his mouth to give a loud whistle.

 You hear jingle bells, and a sleigh pulled by eight tiny reindeer
 alights on the rooftop and skids to a halt.  "Come on, children, time
 to go!" the Thin Man says as they begin piling into the sleigh,
 giggling.

 "Wait," you say, "I don't care <span class="floydstyle em">how</span> smooth of a criminal you
 are, you can't steal these children from the orphanage!

 "We want to go!" Betsy says, and Lenny and Rufus nod enthusiastically.
 "I'm not stealing them," says the Thin Man, climbing onto the front
 seat of the sleigh, which is loaded with presents. "I'm taking them to
 live with new families, where they will be loved and appreciated and
 won't be orphans anymore!"

 "YAAAAAAAAY!" the children shout in unison.  You can't help but grin a
 bit as you shake your head in disbelief.  "Are you Santa Claus?" you
 ask.

 "Not quite," the man replies, switching out his white fedora for a
 floppy red cap with a white brim.  "Oh," I'll need that other glove
 back.  I don't think the world is quite ready for that kind of power
 yet," he grins.

 The oddly-thin man in white stands disinterestedly.  His hands move
 furitively over the brim of his white hat and his belt as if
 repositioning them with bird-like speed.

 You can also see Betsy, Lenny, Rufus and a large sleigh here.

 You realize you are still wearing the man's other glove.

 %% Enter a save filename to write:

 You take off the left white glove.

 The Thin Man waits expectantly.


 (the left white glove to thin man)
 "Evening," you say, as the Thin Man turns his birdlike attention to
 you.

 "Thank you," he says, folding the unused garment into his coat pocket.
 "You've been a big help.  More than you know," he says, piling into
 the sleigh.  "Say bye to the nice detective, kids," he suggests, and
 they all wave and squeal at you happily.

 "Oh, I almost forgot.  A very special lady asked me to give you this,"
 he says, tossing his white hat with the wide black brim to you.  You
 notice there is a folded card tucked inside.

 The Thin Man cracks his whip, and the reindeer heave the sleigh as he
 lifts off into the night, in the distance you can hear him urging the
 reindeer on:

 <span class="floydstyle em">"On Randy!  On Tito!  On Jermaine and Janet...on Marlon and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Jackie...KEEP UP LATOYA!"</span>

 You shake your head in disbelief, wondering how exactly you're going
 to change the details when you write this up in your report so you
 won't be laughed out of the precinct...or worse <span class="floydstyle em">fired</span> for
 being drunk somehow.

 Well, you do have this nice hat, you remark, as fluffy snowflakes
 begin to drift down.


 You already got it.


 You can't see any such thing.


 An anniversary present given to you by your late wife.  The felt is
 charcoal black, like your soul.  <span class="floydstyle em">"Doesn't it make me look a little</span>
