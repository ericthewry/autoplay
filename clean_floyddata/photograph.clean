 You're seated comfortably, hunched forward in your armchair. The frame
 rests on your lap, cradled in both hands, the continuing focus of your
 attention.

 You no longer sense change...

 In the periphery of your vision you see something of the room - the
 wood stove, a window. Beyond your field of view there is nothing but
 clutter and increasing irrelevance. You're pleased that you'll never
 have to look on any of it again.

 The initial euphoria has subsided. Replaced by a sense of ease, of
 place, of things being, well... right.

 It can't be long now...

 'Photograph' features many non-standard verbs and puts some standard
 interactive fiction verbs to different uses. Most instances of the
 latter should be self evident, but one new verb that requires special
 mention is CONSIDER (or synonyms such as THINK ABOUT, REMEMBER, WONDER
 ABOUT, etc). You can CONSIDER (or 'C') many of the objects, topics, and
 even abstract concepts in the story. This will sometimes provide useful
 background detail, but more importantly, its use at certain points is
 vital to the development of the plot. Also, CONSIDER-ing things at
 different times may produce different responses. So, CONSIDER and
 CONSIDER often.

 Of the verbs that have non-standard uses, one that warrants mention is
 WAKE. This verb may be used when your character is merely distracted or
 daydreaming and not actually asleep.

 Conversation in 'Photograph' uses most of the standard constructs (eg:
 "ASK X ABOUT Y", "TELL X ABOUT Y", "ASK X FOR Y, "X, Hello", "SAY Y to
 X", etc.). However, there are other possibilities that can optionally
 be used, including MENTION Y TO X, DISCUSS Y WITH X, and so on.

 In short, if you think something should provide a sensible response
 even though the verb is not standard issue, then try it. If it doesn't
 work, then please send me a bug report.

 Please note that the BRIEF and SUPERBRIEF print states have been
 disabled in this story. VERBOSE is therefore the only printing 'option'
 available.

 Something else I should mention is that there are scenes that can be
 replayed within the story with different outcomes.

 It shouldn't be possible to put the story into an unfinishable state,
 and it is exceedingly unlikely that the player character will die
 during play. Dying is possible, but I'd be surprised if anyone manages
 to do it without resorting to decompiling the story file.

 Living Room (in the armchair)
 You are seated in your armchair. The picture-frame rests on your lap.
 In the periphery of your vision you can see something of your living
 room - the wood stove, a window.

>examine me
 You can see something of your arms and lap, but not much else.

>who am i
 [The story read that as "hop a i"].
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hop.

>consider me
 You are happier now than you have ever been.

>wake
 The wonderful truth is, this time it is not a dream.

>examine frame
 The frame is made from Baltic pine. Within the frame is a rectangle of
 pure and unrelieved white. You think that perhaps you can discern some
 flicker of motion there, but then again it may only be your
 imagination.

>examine photograph
 The frame is made from Baltic pine. Within the frame is a rectangle of
 pure and unrelieved white. You think that perhaps you can discern some
 flicker of motion there, but then again it may only be your
 imagination.

>examine motion
 It's probably just wishful thinking on your part. There seems to be
 nothing there but a white rectangle.

>window
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine window
 The window (now closed) looks out over the yard. The afternoon sunlight
 streams through. You see a bird sitting on the outside sill.

>examine bird
 The bird is a starling. It stands unmoving, with its head slightly
 cocked, beak open. Starlings are common enough, but you are certain
 you've seen this particular bird before.

>listen
 You hear the high-pitched sound of the bird.

>consider starling

>open window
 You lose yourself in thought...








 You stand on a balcony looking out over treetops and distant roofs to
 the river and the hills beyond. The sky is pink and blue pastels, the
 sun barely risen above the late morning mists and woodsmoke haze. A fog
 rolls down the river valley like a lazy cloud.

 As you move to pull your coat closer about you against the cold a
 startled bird takes flight from the eaves above your head. You follow
 its progress to a nearby blue gum.

 Balcony
 You are on a wooden balcony that looks out over a river valley. An open
 door to the west leads back into the house. You are cold.

>examine coat
>examine me
 Your coat is old and weathered. The pockets are empty.

 You are 55 years old, but look (and feel) much older. Although you
 aren't planning on going far away from your wood fire today, you are
 nevertheless rugged up in a thick coat.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine valley
 A dense fog fills the river valley.

>examine gum
 It's a tall blue gum eucalyptus tree. A bird sits on a high branch.

>examine bird
 The bird is a starling. It looks agitated.

>examine bird
 The bird is a starling. It looks agitated.

>open frame
 You see no frame here.

>examine fog
 A dense fog fills the river valley.

>sing
 Your singing is abominable.

>examine river
 A dense fog fills the river valley.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine me
 You are 55 years old, but look (and feel) much older. Although you
 aren't planning on going far away from your wood fire today, you are
 nevertheless rugged up in a thick coat.

>go west
 You take a deep breath of the smoke-laden air (the chill cutting your
 lungs like little knives), then enter the house.

 Living Room (East)
 On entering the living room you find yourself oppressed by the clutter
 and do your best to ignore it. Your armchair is here in front of the
 wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the living
 area continues west.

>say piu piu
 [The story read that as "say it it"].
 (to yourself)
 There is no reply.

>examine clutter
 The room is full to bursting with all manner of items scavenged or
 bought at auctions or fire-sales; furniture, paintings, tools,
 bric-a-brac and junk. Most are covered in a substantial layer of dust.
 You wonder what possessed you. The only thing here that still holds any
 interest for you rests on an old pine mantel near the window.

>close door
 You close the back door.

>examine mantel
 Your attention inevitably shifts to the mantel and you're reassured by
 the sight of the picture sitting where you left it.

>examine picture
 The picture-frame is made of Baltic pine. The photograph it contains is
 slightly overexposed and was taken using a flash.

 Depicted are a young man and young woman leaning with their backs to
 the rail of a rough wooden deck, backed by the spray of a narrow
 waterfall cascading down two tiers of mudstone outcrop. Bordering the
 waterfall is thick temperate rainforest vegetation: a canopy of tall
 myrtle and sassafras trees, beneath which are leatherwood and
 tree-ferns, all covered in moss, lichen, shell-fungus. The boy has his
 arm around the girl's shoulder. Both are wearing light bushwalking
 clothes, and he carries a day pack. The boy looks cocky and confident
 and wears an idiotic 'say cheese' grin. The girl is not smiling. This
 was not, as you recall it, that she had been unhappy, just unused to
 having her picture taken.

 "It's like giving away a piece of your soul," she had once joked.

 As it happens she had smiled just after the shot was taken; a small,
 nervous smile of relief (you mimic the smile at the memory).

>examine man
 A fool, clearly.

>smile
 You smile, again.

>examine girl
 The girl has a stern, set expression.

>examine waterfall
 The backdrop to the picture is of no interest.

>kiss frame
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine pack
 There is nothing about the clothing that interests you.

>examine girl
>examine touch picture
 The girl has a stern, set expression.

 You can't see any such thing.

>consider girl
 In your mind you can still picture her clearly as she was on that day -
 with that long raven hair and those big brown eyes.

>take photo
 Taken.

>touch picture
 You feel nothing unexpected.

>examine eyes
 You see no eyes here.

>consider boy
 You were young then, and too cock-sure for your own good.

>look

 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of
 the wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the
 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window.

>examine armchair
 Your armchair is old and threadbare. You have spent a lot of time in
 this chair.

>consider mantel
>examine stove
 The mantel came from the home of one of your neighbours. He was going
 to throw it out but you thought it too good to waste. It now takes up
 space, resting against your wall.

 It's a pot-bellied wood stove. A fire blazes within and there is a
 supply of firewood beside it.

>examine fire
 It's a pot-bellied wood stove. A fire blazes within and there is a
 supply of firewood beside it.

>push mantel
 Pushing the mantel around would not achieve anything.

>sit on chair
 You turn up your jacket collar and sink back into the faded armchair,
 elbow patches neatly covering matching holes in the upholstery. You
 soon begin to feel the warmth radiating from the wood stove.

>throw picture in fire
 The photograph belongs on the mantel.

>put firewood in fire
 You need to be holding the firewood before you can put it into
 something else.

>consider fire
 The fire is blazing, but you still feel a chill.

>examine me
 You are 55 years old, but look (and feel) much older. Although you
 aren't planning on going far away from your wood fire today, you are
 nevertheless rugged up in a thick coat.

>go up
 You'll have to get out of the armchair first.

>out
 You get out of the armchair.

 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of
 the wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the
 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window.

>go north
 As you enter your bedroom you see a large spider, nearly the size of
 your hand, crawl under the bed.

 Bedroom
 Your bedroom is small and comparatively tidy. The only furnishings are
 a wardrobe and the bed itself. There is a window here facing north and
 the living room is to the south.

>look under bed
 It was a huntsman spider, but it is now nowhere to be seen. Those
 things can hide anywhere. You'd be lucky to find it without taking the
 bed apart. But it's best left alone in any case. They aren't dangerous,
 and they help keep down the flies. There is a metal box here under your
 bed.

>examine box
 It's a closed metal box.

>get it
 You pull the metal box out from under the bed.

>open it
 You open the metal box, revealing some rolls of $50 notes.

>examine rolls
 You have enough money for your needs.

>consider spider
 You can no longer see the spider.

>consider money
 You ended up with a lot of cash when you sold the business, more than
 enough to meet your simple needs for the rest of your life. You've
 never trusted banks.

>consider the economy
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>push box
 You can't push the box back under the bed while it's open. It won't
 fit.

>close box
 You close the metal box.

>push box
 You push the box back under the bed.

>examine wardrobe
 It's a large solid piece of furniture, made of blackwood. Right now,
 it's closed.

>open it
 You open your wardrobe. It contains clothing.

>open it
 That's already open.

>examine clothing
>examine clothing
 You're already wearing your coat. There is nothing here that you need.

 You're already wearing your coat. There is nothing here that you need.

>wear clothing
 (first taking the clothes)
 You are already dressed. You don't need the clothing.

>examine coat
 Your coat is old and weathered. The pockets are empty.

>c coat
 You've owned this coat for a long while.

>c clothing
 Your taste in clothes these days tends towards the 'practical'. 'Style'
 doesn't get a look in.

>close wardrobe
 You close the wardrobe.

>c box
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>look

 Bedroom
 This is your bedroom. The only furnishings are a wardrobe and your bed.
 There is a window facing north and the living room is to the south.

>examine bed
 Your bed is unmade. The top sheet is pulled back and the blankets are
 strewn about.

>make bed
 It's a bit late to start changing the habits of a lifetime.

>look through window
 It's a small window. Through it you see your four-wheel-drive parked
 outside.

>c bed
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>examine car
 A battered old Landcruiser. You've had it for years.

>c car
 The Landcruiser has served you well over the years, despite rough
 treatment.

>lie in bed
 You lie down on the bed.

>sleep
 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

>search bed
 There is nothing on the bed.

>look through window
 You can't reach the window from here.

 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of

 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window.

>go west

 Living Room (West)
 This is the other half of your living area (again heavily cluttered).
 This space also serves as your kitchen. There is a small sink here, a
 gas stove, refrigerator and a cupboard. Your bathroom is to the north
 and a door to the west leads outside.

>open fridge
 You know without looking that the refrigerator contains nothing that
 could still be called edible.

>open cupboard
 You open the cupboard.

>c fridge
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>look in cupboard
 The cupboard contains nothing of use to you right now.

>examine clutter
 Your living area is full of all manner of items scavenged or bought
 over the years.

>go north

 Bathroom
 Your bathroom is small but functional. There is a bath, toilet and a
 hand basin. The room also has a small wall-mounted mirror. The living
 room is to the south.

>examine sink
 It's just a hand basin.

>examine mirror
 It's a small shaving mirror, mounted over the hand basin.

>was hands
 I beg your pardon?

>wash hands
 You don't want to do that now.

>pee
 You don't have the urge.

>look in mirror
 You gaze at your reflection for a moment. Time and the elements have
 not been kind. You're now aged 55 years, but look far older - with that
 furrowed brow, drawn face, teeth like an old graveyard and skin that
 gathers in folds around your jowls. The head of thick dark hair of your
 youth is now reduced to a thin shock of silver on the trailing
 hemisphere. But you take some comfort from the fact that you still
 retain an air of dignity about you; a keenness to your deep-set eyes;
 that pronounced, almost regal, line of your nose ("that noble nose," as
 Nadia used to call it). But perhaps these are no more than cruel
 reminders of what might have been.

>break mirror
 You don't need another seven years bad luck.

>c nadia
 She was not the one for you.

>uc nadia
 [The story read that as "c nadia"].
 She was not the one for you.

>remember nadia
 She was not the one for you.

>remember Nadia.

>c me
 You feel very cold. It's not a warm day, but the weather doesn't fully
 account for the way you feel. Perhaps you are unwell.

>wonder about health

 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

 You rummage around in the junk for a while. You get as far as the dusty

 get no further.

 There is a cardboard carton here.

>examine carton
 The carton contains a number of old possessions scattered loose,
 including a pile of photographs and various unrelated oddments. The
 only things there that hold any interest for you right now are a rather
 moth-eaten animal skin hat and a small brass ornament.

>examine photos
 Some of the photos date from your days at the office, and all feature
 people or places you either don't remember or would rather forget. The
 rest of the items are an eclectic mix of bits and pieces that are of no
 particular interest or worth. The most bizarre of these items is a jar
 containing your appendix, which was removed when you were a child.

 You are on a familiar mountain track. You spend much of your time
 outdoors by yourself on these bush trails. The surrounding forest
 extends almost to the back door of your house, which is to the
 northeast. In effect, the whole of the mountain is your back yard, your
 playground - from this eucalypt forest, right on up to the mist
 shrouded boulder fields and sheer dolerite cliffs and tors beneath the
 summit. It's a bright day, but there is a chill Southerly wind blowing.
 Your grandmother has told you not to wander far, as your lunch is
 nearly ready. You know better than to disobey her.

 Mountain track
 You are on a rocky track, surrounded by eucalypt forest. The track
 leads down a gentle slope to the northeast towards your house and
 continues higher up the mountain to the west. There is a chill
 Southerly wind blowing.

>inventory
 You are wearing your possum skin hat.

>examine hat
 It's your favourite hat. You wear it almost wherever you go.

>remove hat
 You take off your possum skin hat.

>wear it
 You put on your possum skin hat.

>examine me
 You're a scrawny kid, wearing as ever, your possum skin hat and a thick
 duffel coat. Thin pipe-cleaner legs are visible below your shorts -
 "Hollow legs", your grandmother calls them, although you wonder how
 anything so thin could be hollow. On your feet are rather worn leather
 walking boots.

>c hat
 Your hat was made for you by your grandfather. It's the subject of
 jokes and taunts at school, but you don't care, you wear it all the
 same.

>examine photo
 You can't see the photograph here.

>inventory
 You are wearing your possum skin hat.

>score
 The score is: (Jack 0/Life 0)

>vu

>go up
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>go up

 Mountain track
 You are on a rocky track, surrounded by eucalypt forest. The track
 rises steeply to the northwest and winds back down the slope to the
 east. Another narrower path, not much more than an animal trail, leads
 away to the south.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go south

 Part way along the track you spot an echidna, digging for ants on the
 path. At your approach it abandons its labour and shuffles with
 surprising speed off the track and into the undergrowth. As you pass
 you hear it furiously digging itself into the earth, spraying sod and
>go south
 dirt over the long quills on its back.

 Small clearing
 You have entered a small, familiar clearing surrounded in all
 directions except to the south by stands of white gum eucalypt trees
 and dense undergrowth. To the south rises a large lichen-covered rock.
 The air here is damp and close - heavy with the scents of eucalyptus
 and wild flowers. A narrow trail leads back to the north.


 You clamber up the side of the rock, deftly finding those hand and
 footholds that you know so well.

 On the rock
 This rock is your favourite place - a place where you like to come to
 sit and think, or just to be alone. It's only after making the short
 climb from the clearing that you can see the rock for what it is - and
 get some idea of its magnitude. Before you it drops away sharply,
 towering over the trees of the forest below, giving you a superb view
 out over of the rolling foothills of the mountain and the wide river
 valley beyond. Out on the rock you're exposed to the full force of the
 Southerly wind and you brace yourself against it. As you do so, you
 catch sight of something you hadn't noticed before in a crack near the
 rock's far edge.

>examine crack
 There's a small white gum seedling growing in the dirt that has
 collected in the crack. On seeing the seedling you immediately feel an
 affinity with it, and can't help feeling concerned for its predicament.
 It has no chance of growing into a tree where it is.

>c it
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>take it
 You cautiously pull the seedling from the crack, taking care not to
 damage the roots.

>go north

 You carefully climb back down to the clearing.

 Small clearing
 You are in a small, familiar clearing surrounded in all directions
 except to the south by stands of white gum eucalypt trees and dense
 undergrowth. To the south rises a large lichen-covered rock. The air
 here is damp and close - heavy with the scents of eucalyptus and wild
 flowers. A narrow trail leads back to the north.

>plant seed
 [The story read that as "plant me"].
 (first taking yourself)
 You are always self-possessed.

>plant tree
 The ground here is too rocky.

>go north

 Mountain track
 You are on a rocky track, surrounded by eucalypt forest. The track
 rises steeply to the northwest and winds back down the slope to the
 east. Another narrower path, not much more than an animal trail, leads
 away to the south.

>go northwest

 Verge (beside the road)
 You've come up a steep incline onto a cleared dirt verge beside the
 mountain summit road. This is a bend in the gravel road, which runs on
 and up towards the north like a ragged scar across the face of the
 mountain, and back to the southwest where it winds its way steadily
 down through the foothills and towards the city. On the far side of the
 road is a ditch, etched out over the years by the elements and run-off.
 Just beyond the ditch is a sheer cliff several times your height,
 marking where this part of the road has been cut into the
 mountain-side. A rocky track leads back down to the southeast.

 You hear your grandmother calling. Your lunch must be ready.

>examine ditch
 It's a narrow channel running along the far side of the road - etched
 out over time by run-off and melting snow.

>plant gum

 You dig a small hole and carefully plant the seedling.

 Mountain track
 You are on a rocky track, surrounded by eucalypt forest. The track

 continues higher up the mountain to the west.

>c tree
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>go northeast

 Back door
 You are at the back door to your grandparents' house which is to the
 east. The forest extends almost down to the back veranda and a rocky
 track to the southwest leads back into the bush. Through a window you
 can see into the kitchen, where your grandmother and grandfather are
 sitting at the table having lunch. They seem to be arguing about
 something. You can hear their raised voices. You could probably listen
 without being noticed.

>listen
 You hear your grandparents arguing. As usual, it is your grandmother
 who has the most to say. She is angry as it seems your grandfather has
 loaned a lot of money to Mr Timpson, who runs the local store. Your
 grandmother doesn't think they can spare the money and obviously
 doesn't think they'll ever see it again. You've never liked Mr Timpson,
 but you know his father and your grandfather were friends.

 As you open the back door and enter the kitchen your grandparents
 abruptly stop their argument. Your grandfather looks up from his food,
 and gives you a conspiratory wink. Your grandmother snorts, and points
 towards your seat. The air at the table is tense, but you barely notice
 as you hungrily eat your lunch.

 Those days seem such a long time ago now...

>c grandma
 Everything melts away...








 ...and you find yourself back in your living room.


 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of
 the wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the
 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window.

 There is a cardboard carton here.

 The afternoon sun shines weakly through the window.

>c grandma
 You miss your grandmother and all her sagely advice.

>c grandpa
 Your grandfather was a kind and practical man.

>c mr timpson
 Bill Timpson has the only general store up on this part of the
 mountain. You never feel comfortable around him, so you try to keep
 your trips to his shop to a minimum.

>inventory
 You are carrying a possum skin hat and the picture-frame.

>examine photo
 The picture-frame is made of Baltic pine. The photograph it contains is
 slightly overexposed and was taken using a flash.

 Depicted are a young man and young woman leaning with their backs to
 the rail of a rough wooden deck, backed by the spray of a narrow
 waterfall cascading down two tiers of mudstone outcrop. Bordering the
 waterfall is thick temperate rainforest vegetation: a canopy of tall
 myrtle and sassafras trees, beneath which are leatherwood and
 tree-ferns, all covered in moss, lichen, shell-fungus. The boy has his
 arm around the girl's shoulder. Both are wearing light bushwalking
 clothes, and he carries a day pack. The boy looks cocky and confident
 and wears an idiotic 'say cheese' grin. The girl is not smiling. This
 was not, as you recall it, that she had been unhappy, just unused to
 having her picture taken.

 "It's like giving away a piece of your soul," she had once joked.

 As it happens she had smiled just after the shot was taken; a small,
 nervous smile of relief (you mimic the smile at the memory).

>examine carton
 The carton contains a number of old possessions scattered loose,
 including a pile of photographs and various unrelated oddments. The
 only thing there that holds any interest for you right now is a small
 brass ornament.

>examine ornament
 The ornament is an ankh. A gift from Nadia.

>remember Mr. Timpson
 Bill Timpson has the only general store up on this part of the

>open frame
 You lose yourself in thought...








 It's Saturday and as usual you're at your market stall. You make the
 journey here once a week to sell old tools, books and assorted junk.
 The weekly market is set outdoors among the convict-built sandstone
 buildings near the city's waterfront - once warehouses, seedy pubs and
 brothels, but now mostly converted to art galleries, craft shops and
 caf?s. Beyond these colonial buildings and the modest high-rises behind
 them, you see the mountain - a stark and imposing backdrop to the city,
 and for once not covered in clouds. The surrounding stalls have
 brightly coloured awnings, making yours appear somewhat drab in
 comparison. To the south a busker plays a violin, while from the north
 come the strains of South American folk music played on guitar and
 pan-pipes. Nearby, a man dressed as a clown twists balloons into animal
 shapes.

 It's a hot day and the place is busy, though not for you. You haven't
 sold a thing all morning. To top it off, Nadia should be here helping
 with the stall, but you haven't seen her in nearly two days. You wonder
 what her excuse might be, this time.

 At the Market (behind your stall)
 You are tending your stall at the weekly outdoor market near the city's
 waterfront. Nearby, a man dressed as a clown is making balloon animals.

>score
 The score is: (Jack 1/Life 1)

>examine me
 Although well into your thirties, you're still pretty fit.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine stall
 Your stall consists of two covered wooden trestle tables, set out with
 the old tools, books and assorted junk you've brought along to sell.

>examine books
 There is nothing remarkable about any of the items you have for sale.
 You sometimes have rare, or sought-after stuff, but not today. It's
 therefore small wonder that you haven't sold anything.

>sell books
 I beg your pardon?

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine man
 Which do you mean, the clown or the busker?

>clown
 The clown is twisting helium-filled balloons into the shape of a dog.
 To entertain the waiting children he sings a nursery rhyme.

 "Hey, diddle, diddle,
 The cat and the fiddle,
 The cow jumped over the moon,
 The little dog laughed to see such sport,
 And the dish ran away with the spoon."

 On noticing your attention the clown winks, then waves, accidentally
 bursting one of the balloons in the process and uttering a very
 un-clown-like exclamation.

 An elderly lady arrives at your stall and begins carefully considering
 an 'antique' porcelain cat. She looks up as though about to ask
 something, then changes her mind and hobbles away.

>examine busker
 The busker is an old man, raggedly dressed. He is dancing and playing a
 jig on a violin. A battered violin case lies open on the ground in
 front of him. The area around the busker is one of the few uncrowded
 spaces at the market. The lack of an audience doesn't seem to be
 concerning him one bit.

>talk to busker
 To talk to someone you should use the form "TALK TO person ABOUT
 topic".

 You can't help noticing that the clown is having more problems with his
 balloon animals. It's always reassuring to see someone having a worse
 day than you.

>talk to clown about balloons
 The clown is preoccupied and doesn't respond.

 Things are going very slowly. You really do wonder where Nadia is. You
 could do with a break.

>talk to busker about violin
 The busker smiles and plays a little faster.

>look

 At the Market (behind your stall)
 You are tending your stall at the weekly outdoor market near the city's
 waterfront. It's a bright, sunny day and the place is bustling with
 activity. Beyond the colonial sandstone buildings that line the
 marketplace and the modest high-rises behind them, you see the
 mountain. Nearby, a man dressed as a clown is making balloon animals.
 To the south a raggedly dressed busker plays a violin, while further
 away to the north a crowd gathers around a band playing South American
 folk music.

>examine crowd
 The market is a lively place today. It's bustling with people from all
 walks of life.

>examine band
 The band are dressed in traditional South American costume, brightly
 coloured woollen hats and ponchos, and must be sweltering on a day like
 today. There is a large crowd gathering to hear their music.

>c nadia
 You first met Nadia on the night of your thirtieth birthday, several
 years after you broke up with Melanie. You were on a night out with the
 boys and found yourself instantly hooked by her smile. It was a smile
 that lit up her face and almost made you go weak at the knees. That
 night was the beginning of a tempestuous casual relationship.

 Nadia looks for the hidden beauty in everything and everyone; believing
 in astrology, the healing powers of crystals and reincarnation (to her
 everyone has been someone in a former life). You, on the other hand,
 consider yourself to be practical and down-to-earth. Despite your
 differences, you initially found Nadia's optimism refreshing - were
 almost prepared to believe that you had known each other previously (in
 a Biblical sense, and era) and enjoyed being called Akhnaten: "my
 little sun king" (to her Nefertiti).

 Within a few months of meeting, it was Nadia - while remarking on your
 tenseness, offering short-term relief through massage, then telling you
 to "be true to the creature you are" - who gave you the impetus to
 return to the mountain.

 You sold your business and moved together to a caravan on a steep block
 high in the foothills while building your bush home from mud brick,
 local stone and recycled materials. Later, to keep yourself busy, you
 began trading in second-hand furniture and junk (a passion for which
 you acquired in the course of getting the materials together for the
 house) and, much to Nadia's horror and chagrin, by cutting and selling
 firewood. ("Trees have feelings too, you know.")

 But recently things have not been going well. Nadia is beginning to
 tire of your scepticism, and you, of the Bohemian world she inhabits.
 You frequently get on each other's nerves. She is sometimes away from
 home for days at a time, often without explanation. Although your
 relationship appears to be foundering, in many ways you are relieved.
 The strain of it all has been starting to get to you.

>look

 mountain. Nearby, a man dressed as a clown is making balloon animals.
 To the south a raggedly dressed busker plays a violin, while further
 away to the north a crowd gathers around a band playing South American
 folk music.

 A man dressed in overalls walks by. He suddenly notices something among
 the old tools you've laid out on a trestle table. "Hey, I haven't seen
 one of those in years!" he exclaims. Then he laughs and disappears back
 into the crowd.

 Through the crowds you catch a glimpse of Nadia. She seems to be
 heading your way, and has someone with her.

>examine him
 The busker is an old man, raggedly dressed. He is dancing and playing a
 jig on a violin. A battered violin case lies open on the ground in
 front of him. The area around the busker is one of the few uncrowded
 spaces at the market. The lack of an audience doesn't seem to be
 concerning him one bit.

 Nadia pushes her way through the crowd and arrives at your stall. She's
 wearing a thin, ankle-length blue dress and is well bedecked with
 jewellery - gaudy paste rings, gold-coloured bangles and bands coiled
 around her bare arms and large lapis lazuli earrings shaped like asps.
 At her side is someone you haven't met. He's a youngish man, perhaps in
 his early twenties, tall and athletic - all chin, with a physique that
 looks as though it could have been carved from marble - and a crop of
 short dark curly hair. Nadia has a firm grip on his elbow.

 "Hello, Jack." (There's that smile.)

 "'lo, Nadia. It's been a while. Are you going to introduce us?" You
 glance towards her companion.

 "This is Mark," says Nadia. "He's an artist. Mark, meet Jack. Jack
 Downer."

 "Hello, Mark."

 "Er...It's Michael, actually...," stammers Nadia's friend.

 "You're Mark Anthony," corrects Nadia, and he nervously shifts his
 feet.

 "I see," you reply, then turning to Nadia - "And you are...?"

 "I was Cleopatra, of course. Time moves on, Jack, and we must move with
 it. We had our share of good times, but now it's over. You know it as
 well as I. Mark and I are going up to the house to get my stuff. I came
 to say good-bye."

 For once you find yourself lost for words. Looking away from Nadia's
 face your attention is drawn to the brass ankh she wears around her
 neck. She once bought it for you as a present, a symbol, as she put it,
 "of the life-energy we share". Needless to say, you thought it looked
 better on her.

>ask mark about her
 (Nadia)
 "Don't you worry about Nadia. I'll look after her."

>ask mark about mark
 'Mark' has nothing to say about that.

>ask mark about adultery
 'Mark' has nothing to say about that.

>ask nadia about us
 "We had our time, Jack. Some of it was fun. I'm with Mark now."

>beat the shit out of mark
 [The story read that as "eat the shit out of mark"].
 You see no the here.

>give ankh to nadia
 (first taking the ankh)

 "Hey, if you wanted the ankh back, you only had to ask." Nadia takes
 off the ankh, unthreads it from its chain and hands it to you.
 "Good-bye, Jack." She turns and walks back into the crowd, 'Mark' in
 tow.

 You'd considered throwing the thing away. But, of course you never
 did...

>press space
 Everything melts away...








 ...and you find yourself back in your living room.


 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of
 the wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the
 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window.

 There is a cardboard carton here.

 It is getting late in the day. The shadows in the room are lengthening.

>undo

 [Previous turn undone.]

>c mark

>hit mark
 You take a wild swing at 'Mark' and manage to get a lucky punch right
 on that marble chin of his. Buoyed by this success and barely able to
 resist a gleeful cackle, you circle him looking for another opening.
 But that's where everything starts to go pear-shaped. Within a few
 seconds you're lying flat on your back in front of your stall, bleeding
 profusely from the nose. Nadia looks totally disgusted with both of you
 and turns to leave. As she does so she takes off the ankh, unthreads it
 from its chain and drops it on your blood stained T-shirt. "You always
 were a fool, Jack. I think you've got more need of this than me." She
 turns and walks back into the crowd, alone.

 It didn't happen that way, of course, but hey, perhaps it should
 have...

 You'd considered throwing the ankh away. But, you never did...

 You lose yourself in thought...








 You're standing on the wooden deck with your back to the spray of the
 waterfall. The German tourist has returned your camera and you watch
 him briefly as he starts back towards the car park. Melanie is standing
 beside you, smiling. You put your camera away in the day pack then
 gesture towards the falls.

 "C'mon Mel, let's go on to the top," you hear yourself saying.

 Melanie's smile gives way to a frown. "No, you go," she says. "I'll
 wait here."

 Wooden deck (near the waterfall)
 You stand on a wooden deck at the base of a waterfall. The air is cool,
 damp and close, rich with the smells of the rainforest. A walking track
 heads east to the car park. A narrower track leads north towards the
 top of the falls. Melanie is here with you.

 Mel pushes you away.

 You stand on a wooden deck at the base of a waterfall. A walking track

 Melanie is looking angry.

>push melanie in water
 You can't see any such thing.

>open pack
>examine melanie
 You open the day pack, revealing your camera and some sandwiches.

 Melanie avoids your gaze and looks out over the rail towards the falls.
 She is frowning.

>examine falls
 The waterfall is tall, narrow, and bordered by thick rainforest
 vegetation. The water cascades down two outcrops of mudstone into a
 shallow pool at the base. Below the observation deck the pool narrows
 into a swift-flowing stream running east.

 "Well, go on then. Up you go. What are you waiting for?"

 Melanie stamps her foot.

>give sandwiches to melanie
 (first taking the sandwiches)
 "I'm not that hungry right now," says Melanie. "Save them for later."

>go north

 You hand Melanie the day pack, smile broadly, then turn and start
 towards the top of the falls. You're able to set a brisk pace initially
 but are forced to slow as the path narrows and becomes more steep and
 slippery. The last few metres are a scramble and you clutch at roots
 and ferns to gain purchase.

 Once at the top, you inch your way out along a fallen log towards the
 edge of the falls and look down through the spray to the observation
 deck. You are about to wave, but Melanie is nowhere in sight.

 You stand precariously on a fallen log jutting out over the edge of the
 falls.

>examine falls
 It looks like a long way down from here.

>jump
 Jumping from the top of the waterfall would certainly make a dramatic
 statement. But "of what", you are not sure.

>c melanie
 A pretty girl. You know that you could easily fall for her. But it's a
 pity you have so little in common. You had hoped that she would share
 your feelings for this place.

>examine log
 The log is wide but slippery. It juts out over the edge of the falls.

>yell
 [The story read that as "tell"].
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine deck
 You can see the observation deck through the spray below. Melanie is no
 longer there.

>c waterfall
 This is a very special place for you. You used to come to this forest
 with your grandparents during school holidays when you were very young.

>examine forest
 The rainforest is dark, still and damp. A canopy of giant
 myrtle-beeches and sassafras arches overhead, above leatherwoods and
 tree-ferns. Both the trunks of trees and the forest floor are covered
 in mosses and lichens. The rainforest floor is dappled with brightly
 coloured fungi. Undergrowth prevents you from straying far from the
 paths.

>jump
 Jumping from the top of the waterfall would certainly make a dramatic
 statement. But "of what", you are not sure.

>climb log
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>c grandfather
 Your grandfather died several years ago, now. He was a good man,
 mostly, but weak willed. You have long resolved not to be like him.

>inventory
 You are carrying some sandwiches.

>c grandma
 Your grandmother died quite recently. She was a strong and opinionated
 woman. But she meant well.

>cry
 [The story read that as "c"].
 (the sandwiches)
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>eat sandwiches
 You eat the sandwiches. Not bad.

>look

 Top of falls (on the log)
 You stand precariously on a fallen log jutting out over the edge of the
 falls.

>swim
 Jumping from the top of the waterfall would certainly make a dramatic
 statement. But "of what", you are not sure.

>go north
 There is nowhere to go from here but back the way you came.

>c waterfall
 This is a very special place for you. You used to come to this forest
 with your grandparents during school holidays when you were very young.

>c nadia
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>c school
 Your years at boarding school were not the happiest times of your life.

>c childhood
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>c parents
 You barely remember your parents. But you've never really forgiven them
 for dying so young and leaving you alone in the world.

>go down
 You leave the log and scramble back down the path.

 Wooden deck (near the waterfall)
 You stand on a wooden deck at the base of a waterfall. A walking track
 heads east to the car park. A narrower track leads north towards the
 top of the falls. Melanie is no longer here.

>c boarding school
 Your years at boarding school were not the happiest times of your life.

>c car
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>go east
 As you start back along the path towards the car park you hear a rustle
 in the undergrowth nearby, and catch a quick glimpse of something
 moving away. You're out of breath by the time you catch up to Melanie,
 part way back along the track. She is crouched on one knee, examining
 the other, which seems to have been grazed.

 "Hey, Melanie! What's happened? What have you done to yourself?" There
 is little sympathy in your voice.

 Melanie looks up, startled. "What do you care, you bastard? Look at
 this," she gestures at her knee. "This is your fault. I was ready to
 go, Jack. And if you'd listened, I wouldn't have been scared half out
 of my wits. There was some creature back there, near the waterfall - in
 the bush. It charged out at me."

 "It was a pademelon, Mel. I saw it."

 "A what?"

 "A pademelon. A wallaby."

 "Look Jack, I don't care what it was. I'm a city girl, remember. At
 least in town if something jumps at me I've a fair idea what it is and
 what it's after. I've had enough of this bush shit for one day. Let's
 get back to the cottage, ok?"

 Rainforest path
 You are on a walking track that leads east to the car park. Melanie is
 here, crouched on one knee. The day pack is on the ground beside her.

>examine knee
 The knee has a nasty graze.

>open pack
 That's already open.

>look in it
 In the day pack is your camera.

>take camera
 Now is not a good time to take another picture.

>c camera
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>kiss knee
 "Ouch! That hurts." Melanie winces. "Just help me up will you?"

>help melanie
 You pick up the day pack, then help Melanie to her feet and walk
 together back towards the car park.

 The light is fading fast. Tea coloured water cascades and swirls over
 pebbles and sand in the bed of the shallow stream running beside the
 track. You hear the harsh cry of a currawong. Although only twenty
 minutes from the car park, you could easily be many miles from
 civilisation. You would normally have been at ease in these
 surroundings, but you are not. For an instant, you see Melanie lying
 face down in the stream, water-boatmen in her raven hair, then you
 shudder and look ahead through the growing gloom.

 "How's the knee?"

 "It hurts like hell, since you ask. How much further?"

 "Not far. Here, take my arm."

 The cottage is a log cabin with a grey shingled roof of untreated
 timber. Covered with a tracery of yellow-green lichen, and surrounded
 by stands of rainforest trees, it has a rustic charm. After tending
 Melanie's knee, you share the cooking of a meal and eat together in
 silence.

 "Jack?" You glance up from your empty plate to find Mel looking at you
 intently, with those big dark eyes you know you could drown in. The
 anger has gone from her face, replaced by a more familiar gentleness.
 "Have we made up?" she asks.

 "I guess so," you reply, without conviction.

 "Well, here we are then," she says. "And there's no TV. So, how about
 bed?"

 You lie in bed watching Mel undress, admiring her pale skinned beauty.
 Your resolve does not waver on contact with her softness, the touch of
 her breasts and thighs, her smell. Her fingers press into your back,
 yours into hers, feeling the outline of her ribs and arch of her spine
 as you move together. "Careful of my knee." You enjoy each other's
 presence and bodies, with a tenderness and sureness that comes from
 knowing one another well. But only you know it will be for the last
 time. Later, lying close:

 "Do you love me, Jack?"

 "You know I do." (How could you have doubted it?)

 "So are you ready to go ahead with it? Are you finally ready to move
 out of that dump of yours and show some commitment to this
 relationship?"

 "It's late, Mel. Sleep now. We'll talk about it in the morning."

 "Uh-uh, Jack Downer. You don't get out of it that easily. We'll talk
 about it now."

 "Tomorrow, Mel. I'm tired." (Why couldn't you have said "yes"? How
 different things may have been.)

 You break the news the next morning while packing the car ready to
 leave; reeling off practised phrases about "not being ready", "needing
 to slow down", "needing time to think". Melanie says nothing, just
 fixing her attention on putting things in boxes, then the boxes in the
 car. The silence grows as you drive back towards town, finally erupting
 into a heated argument, ending with the last words ever spoken between
 you.

 "Watch out for that tree, you crazy bastard!!"

 Stupid bastard, more like...

 It's just a good thing no-one was seriously injured...

 Everything melts away...








 ...and you find yourself back in your living room.


 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of
 the wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the
 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window.

 The light is failing. It is nearly evening. The flicker from the wood
 stove casts eerie shadows around the room.

>c melanie
 You're too tired to concentrate.

 You're beginning to feel quite tired.

>examine fire
 It's a pot-bellied wood stove. A fire blazes within and there is a
 supply of firewood beside it.

>examine shadows
 They are eerie.

>take firewood
 The fire doesn't need any more wood right now.

>time to take Jack to bed.
 [The story read that as "tie to take jack to bed."].
 You see no to here.

>stand
 You are already standing.

>go west

 This area of your living room doubles as a kitchen. There is a small
 sink here, a gas stove, refrigerator and a cupboard. Your bathroom is
 to the north and a door to the west leads outside.

>undo

 [Previous turn undone.]

>go north

 Bedroom
 This is your bedroom. The only furnishings are a wardrobe and your bed.
 There is a window facing north and the living room is to the south.

>get in bed
 You lie down on the bed.

>sleep

 You can keep awake no longer.

 But you know you can't go to bed until you've seen to the fire. So you
 drag yourself up from the bed, walk wearily to the wood stove and build
 up the fire before heading back to your bedroom. After climbing into
 bed you toss and turn for a while then settle into an uneasy sleep...








 And in this sleep, you dream...








 In your dream you are Akhnaten, the pharaoh of Nadia's fancy, standing
 on a sandy shore gazing out over dark waters. You are dressed in white
 robes, in your right hand is a flail, and in your left is a shepherd's
 crook. The night sky is a terrible serpent that slithers and uncoils
 above you, blood leaching from its foul skin into the waters of the
 East. There are four sealed jars laid out on the sand before you, and
 from your side come the guttural sounds, the snufflings and snarls, of
 some kind of animal, or worse. Reeds grow about you, wrapping
 themselves around your feet, tugging at your ankles.

 But you know that you must not shift your gaze from the horizon, not at
 any cost.

 Sandy shore
 You stand on a sandy shore, gazing out through darkness to the horizon
 in the East. There are four sealed jars set on the sand before you.
 Something is growling beside you, and reeds grow about your feet,
 wrapping themselves around your ankles.

>watch horizon
 You are watching the eastern horizon for Matet, the boat of Ra the sun
 god, that will take you to the afterlife. And not without some
 trepidation. With the benefit of hindsight you wonder at the wisdom,
 during your reign, of banning the worship of Ra and the rest of the
 panoply of Egyptian gods in favour of Aten, a single god of your own
 invention.

 Then again, even pharaohs make mistakes.

 How long must you wait? Surely, it can't be long now.

>c nadia
 Of all your wives, Nefertiti was the one who meant the most to you. You
 were devastated when she was forced into exile.

 You are becoming aware of a burning sensation in your chest.

>c melanie
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>c horizon
 You are watching the eastern horizon for Matet, the boat of Ra the sun
 god, that will take you to the afterlife. And not without some

 panoply of Egyptian gods in favour of Aten, a single god of your own
 invention.

 Then again, even pharaohs make mistakes.

 You are becoming aware of a burning sensation in your chest.

>c flail
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>touch chest
 You drop the flail and reach beneath your robes with your right hand.
 You can feel the jagged edges of the flesh of your chest-wall, and
 beneath that, nothing, an empty cavity. This doesn't auger well for
 your meeting with Osiris (the weigher of hearts).

>touch heart
 Surely, morning must come soon...








 You awake before dawn and lie in your bed in the dim half-light of
 early morning listening to the gentle spattering of sleet or snow
 against the windowpane. You are lying on your back with your arms
 folded across your chest. Normally, you sleep curled on your side, or
 sprawled on your stomach. You are also bathed in sweat.

 Bedroom (on the bed)
 This is your bedroom. The only furnishings are a wardrobe and your bed.
 There is a window facing north and the living room is to the south.

>examine me
 You are 55 years old, but look (and feel) much older. You are wearing
 your coat.

 Your stomach rumbles. There's no food in the house. Like it or not, you
 know you'll have to brave the cold today and go to the store to buy
 some supplies.

>feel me
 If you think that'll help.

>diagnose
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>stand
 You get off the bed.

>look under bed
 There is a metal box under your bed.

>pull box

 You open the metal box, revealing some rolls of $50 notes.

>take roll
 You take a roll of fifties.

>close box

 You close the metal box.

>push box

 You push the box back under the bed.

 You put the roll of $50 notes in your coat pocket.

>go south

 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of
 the wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the
 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window.

>inventory
 You are carrying a cardboard carton, an ankh, a possum skin hat and the
 picture-frame.
 In a coat pocket you have a roll of $50 notes.

>put ankh, hat, frame in carton
 ankh: Done.
 possum skin hat: Done.
 photograph: The photograph belongs on the mantel.

>put frame on mantel. drop carton
 You place the picture back on the mantel.
 Dropped.

>score
 The score is: (Jack 0/Life 1)

>go west

 Living Room (West)
 This area of your living room doubles as a kitchen. There is a small
 sink here, a gas stove, refrigerator and a cupboard. Your bathroom is
 to the north and a door to the west leads outside.
>braaaiiiins

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west

 With barely a backwards glance at the photograph on the mantel, you
 step out of the door and onto the path. Fresh snow is beginning to
 settle on the gravel. It crunches under your feet as you walk, and dark
 clouds billow up over the mountain, obscuring the stars.

 Front Path
 You are on the gravel path near your front door, which is to the east.
 The path leads north to your driveway and continues south to your yard.
 The trees of the surrounding forest come nearly to the edge of the
 path.

>go north

 Bottom of driveway
 You are standing at the bottom of your driveway. The drive heads up to
 the northwest. Leading off the driveway to the south is a path that
 takes you around to the front of the house. Your old Landcruiser is
 parked here, near the house.

>enter car
 (the Landcruiser)
 You get into the Landcruiser.

>examine car
 (the Landcruiser)
 The inside of your Landcruiser is as tatty as the outside. The front
 seats are torn and dirty, and those of the rear have long since been
 removed altogether to give you more carrying capacity.

>drive car
 You see no car here.

>drive
 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>c car
 (the Landcruiser)
 The Landcruiser has served you well over the years, despite rough
 treatment.

>go northwest
 The Landcruiser coughs into life and in a shower of gravel, rattles on
 up towards the road, windscreen wipers waving noisily. At the top of
 your drive you turn and start the winding descent towards the store. As
 you drive you sit forward, hunched over the steering wheel, pot-holes
 jarring your craned neck as you struggle to make out the line of the
 road. The snow is falling more heavily now, making visibility poor.

 Mountain road (in the Landcruiser)
 You're heading south along a narrow stretch of the mountain summit
 road. This part of the road has been cut from the mountain-side. It has
 rocky cliffs rising on its western edge and drops away sharply into the
 forest to the east. The road here is badly corrugated, making driving
 difficult.

>c snow
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>c cliff
 Dolerite is a black crystalline volcanic rock, similar to basalt.

>c death
 [The story read that as "c earth"].
 Nothing of interest occurs to you.

>c all
 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>go south

 Suddenly, out of nowhere, a wallaby jumps onto the road in front of
 you, is caught briefly in the headlights and then is gone, in one
 bound, back into the bush. As you swerve to avoid it the Landcruiser
 leaves the road, coming to rest heavily in a ditch. You gun the engine
 and press the accelerator to the floor, a spray of yellow mud erupting
 from the wheel-arches as the vehicle slues further from the road.

 For a while you sit rigid and unmoving in the cabin of the Toyota, then
 with a deep sigh, you kill the engine and relax your white-knuckled
 grip on the wheel. With resignation you begin to feel all tension and
 panic drain away, and with them, all resolve and sense of purpose.
 "Bloody wallaby," you mutter to yourself. You gaze absently at the
 criss-crossed patterns of ice forming in the arcs of the still
 screeching wiper-blades, and at the sleet and snow hitting the
 windscreen like glass bugs.

>c wallaby
 Then you begin to shake uncontrollably...








 It's difficult to say when the wheels started falling off your life.
 You were fine when Nadia left you. Your depression came years later,
 the onset gradual and seemingly without cause. You began to withdraw
 from the things and people around you, as though a filter had been
 placed between you and the rest of the world, or perhaps a small rip
 had developed in the fabric that bound you to it. Your fondness for the
 bush and those of the local community began to pale, and your
 recollections became tinged with sadness and regret. Over time you
 found it more difficult to keep your mind focused and you developed a
 propensity for self-doubt - doubts that led to failures, perceived as
 well as actual, that further fuelled your lack of confidence.
 Eventually, you fell into a descending spiral of despondency and
 despair, and the small rip in the fabric of your existence became a
 gaping rift.

 By the time you realised something had gone wrong, you were already
 powerless to do anything about it, and had nothing left to fight with.
 While still physically fit, you were an emotional cripple. And in this
 state, you would sit in your armchair for hours on end, wrestling inner
 demons, rerunning the events of your life in your mind, looking for
 someone or something to blame, before ultimately deciding that at some
 point in your life...

 ...you had taken a wrong turn.








 As you sit in the cabin of your Landcruiser, watching the snow fall
 through the frosted windscreen, you see a small boy standing on the
 dirt verge on the other side of the road. The boy is wearing a duffel
 coat, shorts and an animal skin hat. You recognise the child's bright
 eyes and stoic expression - can almost imagine him calling out "Hey,
 mister. What's the problem? Shall I get help?" You want to yell to the
 boy, to warn him, but as you go to get out of the car, he turns, looks
 over his shoulder as though someone has called him, then disappears
 down the bank and into the bush.

 Bend in the road (in the Landcruiser)
 You are sitting in your Landcruiser. The vehicle rests precariously
 with one rear wheel in a ditch and the opposing front wheel high in the
 air. Near the Landcruiser, to the west, rises a cliff and on the
 opposite side of the road is a dirt verge. There is a tall white gum
 eucalypt growing on the verge.

>examine tree
 It's a tall white gum tree.

>climb tree
 You can't do that from inside the vehicle.

>c tree
 The white gum has done well since you planted it here as a seedling all
 those years ago.

>open compartment
 You see no compartment here.

>out
 As you step from the Landcruiser you find yourself thankful for the
 fact that it is equipped with a winch.

 Bend in the road
 You are standing near your Landcruiser. The vehicle rests precariously
 with one rear wheel in a ditch and the opposing front wheel high in the
 air. Near the Landcruiser, to the west, rises a cliff and on the
 opposite side of the road is a dirt verge. The gravel road heads back
 to the north, and leads on around the bend to the southwest. There is a
 tall white gum eucalypt growing on the verge.

>go southwest
 It is too far to walk to the store from here.

>attach winch to tree
 But you don't have the winch cable.

>get cable
 You take the end of the winch cable.

>attach winch to tree
 Having attached the winch to the tree, you pull the four-wheel-drive
 free of the ditch. Then in a flurry of gravel and snow you continue
 down the road towards Timpson's store. You drive carefully, but still
 have to fight for grip on the ice and snow. By the time you swing into
 the small parking bay at the front of the store you're sweating
 profusely and your fingers ache from gripping the wheel. It would be
 well into the morning by now, but the weather has closed right in and
 it is still quite dark. The mountain slopes above you are completely
 obscured by clouds.

 Outside Timpson's store (in the Landcruiser)
 You are sitting in your Landcruiser parked at the front of Timpson's
 store which is to the west. The store is a somewhat dilapidated
 double-storey weatherboard building with a veranda, and an old
 advertising hoarding out the front. The shop itself is on the ground
 floor. Bill Timpson lives above it. The summit road heads back to the
 northeast and continues as a sealed road towards the small local
 township to the south.

>enter shop
 (the store)
 I don't think Bill Timpson would appreciate a ram-raid on his store.
 Perhaps you should get out of the four-wheel-drive first.

>out
 You turn off the engine, jump from the Landcruiser, and quickly climb
 the two steps up to the front veranda of the shop. It's only when you
 get to the door that you notice the rough cardboard sign tacked to it.

>read sign
 The sign says, "CLOSED".

 The wind whistles through the uprights of the veranda, whipping the
 falling snow into circles that dance at your feet as you stand staring
 at the sign. You feel your temper rising.
>examine sign

 The sign says, "CLOSED".

>knock on door
 (the front door)
 You pound at the door, perhaps more vigorously than was necessary.
 Several moments later you hear the sound of a window being opened above
 you.

 "Go, away! It's Sunday. We're closed." It's Timpson. In frustration,
 you pound the door again.

 "Look, I mean it, whoever you are. Get lost. Now!...or I call the
 police."

 You step back from the veranda and look up to the second-storey window
 where you see, glaring down at you, a tiny wisp of a man, dressed in
 pyjamas.

 "Oh, it's you, Downer y'mad bugger. Well, we're closed. So you'd better
 go back to that mud hut of yours."

>tell him about hunger
 "I can't help you, Jack. It's Sunday. Go home."

>ask him about grandpa
 At the mention of your grandfather Timpson softens noticeably. He
 hesitates for a moment, then glances skywards, before saying, "Yeah
 okay, Jack. Just this once, for your granddad's sake. I owe him. But if
 you've damaged my door with all that banging, I'll take it outta ya
 hide. I'll be down in a minute." He steps back from the window, pulls
 it shut and draws the curtain. A short time later you hear the front
 door being unlocked and opened.

>go west

 Timpson's store
 Timpson keeps a musty, old-style, general store. The place hasn't
 changed much since you first came here with your grandparents all those
 years ago. Then, he used to keep a sweet jar on the counter, and you
 wondered whether one day he might offer you one. But, of course, he
 never did. You somehow still feel like that child whenever you come
 here. The old man doesn't keep a lot of stock, but he generally has
 most of the basic food and hardware items you need. Timpson is standing
 behind the counter, still in his pyjamas.

 "Well?" he asks.

>buy food
 You quickly select the supplies you need, pay for them with a couple of
 the fifties from the roll you carry in your coat pocket and turn to
 leave the store. As you reach the veranda with your bag of purchases
 you suddenly become disoriented, and falter in your step. For an
 instant your vision blurs and a wave of nausea sweeps over you. Beads
 of sweat form on your brow. Timpson comes out from behind his counter.

 "You alright, Downer? You look as though you seen a ghost."

 The feeling passes.

 "Yeah, Bill. I'm fine. See you, Timpson." You step down from the
 veranda as Bill Timpson shakes his head, then closes and locks the door
 to his store.

 Outside Timpson's store
 You are at the front of Timpson's store which is to the west. The store
 is a somewhat dilapidated double-storey weatherboard building with a
 veranda, and an old advertising hoarding out the front. The shop itself
 is on the ground floor. Bill Timpson lives above it. There is a sign
 tacked to the front door (which is closed). The summit road heads back
 to the northeast and continues as a sealed road towards the small local
 township to the south. Your Landcruiser is parked nearby.

>inventory
 You are carrying a large paper bag.
 In a coat pocket you have a roll of $50 notes.

>look in bag
 It's a large paper bag, full of food items and other supplies that you
 need.

>c timpson
 Bill Timpson has the only general store up on this part of the
 mountain. You never feel comfortable around him, so you try to keep
 your trips to his shop to a minimum.

>eat food
 You think about getting something out of the bag and eating it on the
 spot, but then decide you should wait until you get into your house at
 least.

>enter car
 (the Landcruiser)
 You climb into the Landcruiser and put your supplies on the passenger's
 seat beside you.

>drive
 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>drive ne
 The drive home is not going to be easy. You drive cautiously, at a
 crawl. Your progress is not only threatened by the weather, but by
 something else as well - you are having trouble maintaining your
 concentration, sweat from your palms loosens your grip on the wheel and
 there is a pounding in your head. You wonder if you might be going mad.
 Eventually you make it safely back to your driveway.

 Bottom of driveway (in the Landcruiser)
 You are sitting in your Landcruiser parked at the bottom of your
 driveway. The drive heads up to the northwest. Leading off the driveway
 to the south is a path that takes you round to the front of the house.
 Your bag of supplies is on the passenger's seat beside you.

>get food
 Taken.

>out
 You step from the vehicle with your bag of supplies. You are feeling
 very unwell.

 You are on the gravel path near your front door, which is to the east.
 The path leads north to your driveway and continues south to your yard.
 The trees of the surrounding forest come nearly to the edge of the

>go east

 As you enter the house you find yourself breathing heavily and fighting
 back fatigue. You put the bag of supplies down on the kitchen floor,
 then look towards the mantel and feel some composure return at the
 sight of the photograph sitting there. But you quickly begin to feel
 uneasy. Something about the photograph isn't right.

 Living Room (West)
 This area of your living room doubles as a kitchen. There is a small

 Living Room (East)
 Your living room is full of clutter. Your armchair is here in front of
 the wood stove. A doorway to the north leads to your bedroom and the
 living area continues west. The back door is to the east.

 There is a cardboard carton here.

 An old pine mantel leans against the wall near the window. On the
 mantel you see a photograph.

>examine picture

 You take the frame in both hands, then as you stand there your hands
 begin to tremble, sweat pours into your eyes and your mind is numbed by
 the clamour of your racing heart and the rattle in your chest. You
 stare in disbelief at the photograph, rub the sweat and tears from your
 eyes with your sleeve, then look again - at the smile.

 With a grimy, callused finger you prod the picture trying to wipe away
 the smile on Melanie's face, that small nervous smile of relief so
 often recalled in your memory, the smile that you know can not be
 there, because it happened after the picture was taken. But the smile
 is not the only change in the photograph. You can also see your own arm
 reaching towards the camera.

>examine arm
 In horror, you drop the photograph, the frame smashing on contact with
 the floor, then you back away towards the bedroom. Lying in a foetal
 position, your body heaving, you fall into a long, deep dreamless sleep
 - the sleep of the dead...








>press space
 The discovery of the photograph had been largely fortuitous. Some time
 after the onset of your depression, you had been sitting in your
 armchair feeling choked by the clutter that surrounded you and had
 resolved to do something about it. Your clean up began with a dust
 covered cardboard box of old possessions from before your return to the
 mountain, and that was as far as you got. As you went through the
 contents of the box you came across a number of photographs scattered
 loose, among them the photo of Melanie and yourself at the waterfall.
 For a moment you had trouble recalling the photograph, where it had
 been taken, and even who the girl was that you were with. Then you
 remembered, and were instantly overwhelmed by feelings of melancholy
 and nostalgia. It was an almost palpable experience, like breaking open
 an exotic fruit and being immersed in the smell of its rich fleshy pulp
 - sickly sweet, but turning at the core. The scene in the photograph,
 which you had barely given a thought for years, was instantly
 transformed into a pivotal moment; while only one point in the millions
 that had made up your life, for you it became the critical one, the
 point where your life had started to go wrong.

 You made a frame for the photograph, and set it in a prominent position
 on the mantel. Over the following months you became more and more drawn
 to the picture, spent increasing amounts of time looking at it, running
 the frame through your hands, and running the events of that day and
 evening through your mind, thinking about how they might have been
 different. In time, you came to reinterpret everything that had
 happened before the day of the photograph as preparation for that
 moment and everything after as a mistake. Your waking hours were spent
 striving to regain the moment, and set it to rights in your mind. The
 world and your needs within it paled into insignificance, were merely
 inconvenient distractions from your true focus. And you became
 increasingly frustrated by the fact that with each passing hour you
 were a little further from the only junction in your life that had
 mattered, the only point where you could have put your life back on
 track...








 You open your eyes to find that you are once more lying on your back,
 feet together with arms folded across your chest. It is daylight and
 bright. You can hear the calls of birds outside. You feel strangely
 calm and rested, your breath coming easily and without pain. Even your
 hunger has abated. You have not forgotten the photograph lying in its
 shattered frame in the next room, but you don't feel pressed to do
 anything about it. There is no rush.

 A huntsman spider crawls along the beam above your head, towards a fly
 at the opposite end. The fly is caught in the strand of another
 spider's web, and it spins noisily and stupidly, like a fish on a hook.
 You are resigned to the fly's fate well before it is, and look away no
 longer interested before the spider reaches it.

 slowing your progress nonetheless.

>examine photo
 Taking care to avoid the broken glass you bend down to look at the
 photograph. You brace yourself for what you might see, anticipating
 that your heart may skip a beat. The smile is still there, although it

 your right hand is your camera that the German tourist used to take the
 shot.

 You put the frame down on the workbench and get the tools you'll need.
 Having selected your tools, you begin by removing the remaining shards
 from the picture-frame, then you carefully fix the joins in the wood of
 the frame and cut and fit a new piece of glass.
>repair frame

 As you work you glance at the photo, trying to discern movement in the
 scene. While not noticing any changes in the picture as you watch it,
 you find that after looking away to get a piece of glass or a tool and
 returning to the scene there seem to be minute differences in detail in
 the spray from the waterfall, the refraction of light through the
 trees, or the features or posture of Melanie and yourself.

 You work slowly, wanting to make it as good as it was, and when
 finished you put away your tools and pick up the restored frame.

 You have already mended the picture-frame.

 There's a bag of supplies on the floor near the door.

>cook food
 You take what you need from the bag of supplies and prepare a good
 solid breakfast, your first decent meal in weeks. You feel relaxed and
 in control as you prepare, then eat your meal. You feel as though
 you've been relieved of all your worries. Your approach to the
 activities of the day has been unhurried, and conducted with a degree
 of ceremony, as though in deference to fate. You really feel like
 Nadia's Egyptian king, with your final die cast and with organs safely
 tucked into jars, awaiting the arrival of the boat of Ra.

 You finish your meal and pick up the photograph. The changes in the
 scene have now become obvious - your head is fully turned towards the
 waterfall and your left arm is extended, pointing towards the top of
 the falls, while the smile on Melanie's face has gone, replaced by the
 beginnings of a frown.

 Your bathroom is small but functional. There is a bath, toilet and a

 room is to the south.

>undress
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take shower
 [The story read that as "take her"].
 You can't see "her" (Melanie) at the moment.

>take bath
 You fill the tub with warm water, then undress, leave the photograph on
 the floor well away from the water and have a long, leisurely bath.

 As you bathe you notice that the sensation of impeded movement is still
 there, but is much more pronounced than when you woke. It is almost as
 though your mind and body are operating at different speeds, with
 messages from your brain taking time to filter through your nervous
 system.

 After you've bathed and dressed you pick up the photograph, then take
 it to the armchair and sit with it on your lap. The couple at the
 waterfall are now facing each other. Melanie has her mouth open and you
 are now sure you can see the movement in the picture, although it is
 agonisingly slow. She is speaking and you silently mouth the words in
 anticipation of the horror of your worst mistake being repeated before
 your eyes.

 "No, you go. I'll wait here."

 Sweat pours from your hands and forehead and your heart is in your
 mouth as you watch for over an hour while the image of your younger
 self removes the day pack from his shoulder and hands it to Melanie. As
 the broad grin begins to appear on the face of the boy, you desperately
 wish you could reach into the scene to wipe away the conceited
 expression and shake some sense into the young fool. You wait with
 resignation for the boy to turn and start up the track to the top of
 the falls, but for a long time he just stands there unmoving - then by
 degrees he moves towards the girl and puts his arm around her waist.
 Only when the boy has taken the pack and the pair begin walking back
 along the track together do you start to breathe normally. This, you
 know, is how it was meant to be.

 As you sit in your armchair you look up from the photograph and notice
 that the fire is getting low.

>put firewood in fire

>take firewood

 You take the firewood, set the fire then close the stove and sit back
 in the armchair with the photograph.

 Throughout the rest of the day you sit there following the couple's
 slow progress back along the track. You afford yourself a wry chuckle
 as the startled pademelon bounds across the path in front of them -
 Melanie jumping and the boy comforting her, then their laughter at the
 episode. You can almost feel the shape of her through her clothes, the
 sparkle and comfort of her presence beside you. The rate of change in
 the photograph has increased steadily through the day, more a slow
 motion movie than portrait by day's end.

 While it is hard to drag yourself away, in time you find yourself too
 tired to go on watching the scene.

 sleep fitfully. While awake you toss and turn, noticing the increasing
 lag in your movements and feeling like an insect caught in a web or
 trapped in hardening resin. But you understand the reason for this
 feeling, and are not concerned. The one thing that does concern you is
 missing something in the developing scene in the next room, and so you
 leave your bed well before dawn.

 There is a cardboard carton here.

>examine photo

 You take the photograph, sit back down in the armchair and look to the
 scene in the picture.

 Melanie and your younger self are eating a meal in the cottage. You
 watch every mouthful of food as it leaves the plate to their mouths,
 then the empty forks return to the plate, and you see Melanie's
 inquiring gaze well before it is noticed by the boy. Then you smile to
 yourself as the boy looks up into those big dark eyes you know he must
 drown in, and follows the girl to the bedroom. As voyeur you are with
 them as they make love, and afterwards you watch them talk in soft
 tones and laugh at shared jokes as they lie in each other's arms. By
 the time they are packing the car ready to return to town the scene in
 the picture is changing at life speed, and you feel as though you are
 there as they chat and joke on the journey in the car. You tense as
 they approach a forested turn, anticipating the screech of brakes and
 thud of impact, but then relax as they round the bend without incident.
 The pace of the unfolding scene continues to increase. And as the world
 in the photograph gains momentum you are increasingly aware of things
 around you slowing down. You have no difficulty in following the
 couple's return to the city, the boy moving in with Melanie, and
 something of their first days of living together. While the scene is
 soon moving too quickly to follow, you know what will happen. You know
 that you will stay in your legal practice, that you and Melanie will
 have children, that your lives together will be happy. You have been
 there many times in your mind and don't need the visual confirmation.

 The photograph is now only a blur, a rectangle of unrelieved white, and
 you sit staring and motionless before it, as though embedded in a world
 of amber...
 Epilogue









 Heather Downer regretted that she had never really got to know her
 father, and now of course it was too late. It had been two weeks since
 his death and still she hadn't cried. She knew she should feel guilty,
 but somehow was more angry that he had chosen her eighteenth birthday
 as the day to have a massive cardiac arrest. She was also angry that
 all chance had now gone for him to make up for those broken promises;
 of getting back from work in time to help with her homework, or of
 spending some time with her, or just showing some interest in her life.
 Instead he had spent all his time working himself into an early grave
 at age forty-two. Heather sat cross-legged on the floor, helping her
 mother sort through her dad's things. She had before her a cardboard
 box of some of his older possessions, childhood books, photos, a tennis
 racquet, and was saddened to think that he once had a life like anybody
 else's, with interests and hobbies. If only things could have been
 different. She brushed away strands of her long black hair that had
 fallen forward into her eyes, and a tear with them.

 "Hey, mum. Who's this old wrinkly?"

 Melanie Downer was on the other side of the room and came across to
 look at the framed photograph in her daughter's hand. "I don't know,
 dear. Perhaps it was a relative of your father's. I can certainly see a
 resemblance. Although, I don't remember Jack ever talking about having
 close family."

 "A relative? Do you think so? Look at the way he's sitting there in
 that disgusting old chair, with all that junk everywhere, just staring
 like that. It gives me the creeps. I don't want it in the house. Can I
 toss it?"

 "I suppose so, we can't keep all his things. It's a nice frame though,
 Baltic pine by the look of it. Keep that. You can put the photograph
 over there with his appendix. I don't know why he kept that either,"
 Melanie said pointing to a jar containing a small shrivelled object.
 "They can go out together."

 ...and await the arrival of the boat of Ra.
