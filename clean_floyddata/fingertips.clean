 Well, this has not been a great day for you. Your shoelace broke, you
 stepped on some gum, someone moved your chair without asking you, and
 now your apartment's been set on fire by your enemies. Which is just
 one of the job hazards that you have to put up with in your line of
 work, but still, you're not really a big fan of things being set on
 fire. (Unless you're doing it, which is only when there's a good
 cause.) So this is a problem. The flames have engulfed most of the
 room now. You can feel your hair frizzling in the heat. As the fire
 crackles hungrily towards you, you have only moments to decide: what
 are you going to do?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hideout</span>
 You've been operating out of this apartment for months, undercover,
 infiltrating a shadowy organization known only as <span class="floydstyle em">them</span>. Or
 <span class="floydstyle em">they</span>, depending on the grammatical demands of the sentence.
 Anyway, this apartment isn't really yours, technically speaking, but
 you were kind of attached to it and are sad to see it meet such a
 fate.

 The smoke makes it ever so slightly hard to see your surroundings, but
 you know that in front of you, to the north, the only door out of this
 room is blocked off by the blaze, and that there's a window behind
 you.

 Against the wall farthest from the flames stands your bed, neatly
 made.

 A photograph lies at your feet, still untouched by the flames.

>sleep


 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

>lie on bed


 You don't have time for that now.

>examine me


 You look down at your charcoal-grey suit. It's a very nice suit. You
 just picked it up from the dry-cleaners last night. If you had known
 that both it and you were going to be reduced to a pile of ash not
 twenty-four hours later, you wouldn't have bothered. What would be
 great is if you had some kind of advance warning of these things,
 though you guess if you had then you could've been well out of town by
 now. Obviously saving yourself would be better than just saving your
 suit. What would be even better than that, of course, would be saving
 the data that you've collected over the past few months--although if
 you could save both the data and yourself, that'd be best of all.
 Where did you leave that stuff, anyway? You're sure you left yourself
 a note about it somewhere around here...

 While you've been dithering, the fire has been spreading, and by the
 time you actually start thinking about how to get out, it's too late.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">***Vanity is bad for you.***</span>

>examine photograph


 The photograph is of you and an old flame, Ana Ng--well, that was what
 she was calling herself then. You don't know her real name, which you
 guess is only fair since she never knew yours either. After two
 blissful days together, you found out she was working undercover for
 <span class="floydstyle em">them</span>, and that was the end of that. You kept the picture,
 though. In it she has her face half turned away from the camera, her
 long black hair and incredibly large hat obscuring most of her
 features. You always thought her distaste for being caught on film was
 shyness. You weren't sure what to make of the hats, though, even then.

 As you pick up the photograph, you notice a memo to yourself scribbled
 on the back, reminding you to do the things you gotta do and touch
 the... floor? Huh. You make a mental note to leave yourself clearer
 notes in the future, then tuck the photograph into your pocket and
 make a break for it through the window. As you flee the scene, it
 occurs to you that there was something more important you could've
 rescued from that room. Well, no use crying over burnt data.

>l under bed


 You know you've got some important data hidden around here--you just
 don't know where. Could it be under the bed? You bend down and peer
 under it, but all you can see is your carefully cultivated dust bunny
 collection (shame to see that go, but what can you do, really) and a
 guitar. You find nothing underneath your pillow, either, but then
 you'd be surprised if you did find anything there. It's not a very
 good hiding place, especially since you're a bit of a restless
 sleeper. Finally, you check under your mattress, but that doesn't turn
 up anything either. Where could you have left it? You're pretty sure
 you wrote a note to remind yourself, but you don't remember where that
 is, either...

 Unfortunately, you spend so much time searching your bed for the
 missing data and then wondering to yourself where else you might have
 put it that you fail to escape.

>search floor


 You have to save that important document--this may be a mess, but you
 can still get <span class="floydstyle em">something</span> out of it. Now, where did you put
 it... ah, yes, of course, under the loose floorboard! You crawl over
 to the board in question and push it down so that the end comes up,
 then fish the file out of the hole. You leave everything else
 behind--none of it was yours, anyway, besides that photo of your
 ex-girlfriend, and she was a jerk anyway, what with the whole
 ratting-you-out-to-the-enemy thing. Also, her taste in hats was
 terrible.

 Making your way to the window, you open it wide and make a daring
 exit, just as any dashing person of mystery should. In spite of
 everything, you have to admit you're feeling pretty pleased with
 yourself as you walk off into the sunset.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Everything Is Catching On Fire</span> is part of the Apollo 18 + 20
 IF "tribute album" project. It is a one-move game: every possible move
 ends the game, including examining or taking objects. There is,
 however, a way to "win". So, try a lot of different things, and pay
 attention to the results that you get.

 The author can be contacted at the.xenographer@gmail.com with any
 feedback or bug reports. Special thanks to the beta-testers: Melvin,
 Ruth, Jack, Dan, and Cally.

 Panicking, you take a flying leap right through the glass of the
 window, severing several rather important blood vessels in the
 process. As you lie on the ground bleeding, you reflect that this
 always looked so much cooler in the movies.

 You've gotta get out of here. You heave the window open and dive out,
 tucking in your limbs and rolling as you hit the ground. Unfortunately
 you're not made of rubber anymore (but that's another story), so the
 impact still jars you a little, but does a super awesome secret agent
 such as yourself let that stop them? Of course not. So you pick
 yourself up and flee the scene.

 You regret that you couldn't save the intel that you gathered--maybe
 then this whole mess would be salvageable--but you didn't have time,
 and anyway you can't remember where it is. Not that you <span class="floydstyle em">lost</span>
 it or anything. Super awesome secret agents such as yourself don't
 lose things. You just put it in such a safe place that it ended up
 being safe even from you. And at least now your enemies absolutely,

 ...It all begins again...

 Before Ululul can type the last command on the keypad, the plasma
 burns overcome him, and he slumps to the floor. You're all alone now,
 isolated; the others can't reach you.

 While the energy relays spark and scream, you stare at the keypad,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reactor Core</span>
 Like a dewdrop suspended from a crystalline cocoon, this massive
 chamber emerges from the underbelly of the Hexergon station, exposed
 to galactic stillness and storms. You're isolated in what the
 Hexergons call the Overlook, a translucent, plasticine bubble affixed
 to the apex of the chamber. It's here with a single keypad that the
 core is controlled. It's also here that the experiment went awry.

 The reactor core blazes chaotically hundreds of meters below your
 feet. Hundreds of thousands of kilometers beyond the core roils the
 black hole around which the station now holds a tenuous orbit.

 The bodies of Ululul and the translator bot lie motionless, both burnt
 by the now uncontrollable plasma bursts.

 Nothing happens.

 It's happening again.. You can feel it...

 The reactor core pulses... once... twice... then explodes. The
 remaining energy relays follow suit, dropping from the ceiling in a

 There's a bunch of slime on the notepad, probably from Ululul's
 fingertips when he yanked the notepad away from you during the chaos.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Numbers," Ululul said at some point during the interview. "The</span>

 support, but apparently not enough power to propel the station out of

 The reactor core blazes chaotically hundreds of meters below your
 feet. Hundreds of thousands of kilometers beyond the core roils the
 black hole around which the station now holds a tenuous orbit.

 The bodies of Ululul and the translator bot lie motionless, both burnt
 by the now uncontrollable plasma bursts.

>examine bot


 A simple cube that normally hovers a meter off the ground, happily
 translating whatever the speaker has to say. It now rests on the
 floor, that last blast of plasma having nearly shredded it. It seems
 to still be chirping something, but you'd need to listen more closely
 to it.

 It's happening again.. You can feel it...

 <span class="floydstyle em">The translator bot, normally a serene thing, echoed Ululul's own</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">cries as the station pitched toward the black hole: "I need more time!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">I need more time!" Then a shout of triumph, something about</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">configuring the core's quantum frequency to harmonize with the black</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">hole's singularity and the "brain waves of the human, thus causing it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to experience a recursive time loop..." Or something like that...</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Ululul got nailed by another plasma burst soon after, the same one</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">that took out the bot.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Regardless, you didn't like being called "it."</span>

 The reactor core pulses... once... twice... then explodes. The
 remaining energy relays follow suit, dropping from the ceiling in a
 cascade of fireworks. Reality ripples, time wavers... And just as
 everything is about to end...


 (Press any key)




 ...It all begins again...

 Before Ululul can type the last command on the keypad, the plasma
 burns overcome him, and he slumps to the floor. You're all alone now,
 isolated; the others can't reach you.

 While the energy relays spark and scream, you stare at the keypad,
 then at your hands, realizing that the only things between you and
 this recursive nightmare are your fingertips...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reactor Core</span>
 Like a dewdrop suspended from a crystalline cocoon, this massive
 chamber emerges from the underbelly of the Hexergon station, exposed
 to galactic stillness and storms. You're isolated in what the
 Hexergons call the Overlook, a translucent, plasticine bubble affixed
 to the apex of the chamber. It's here with a single keypad that the
 core is controlled. It's also here that the experiment went awry.

 The reactor core blazes chaotically hundreds of meters below your

 The bodies of Ululul and the translator bot lie motionless, both burnt

>listen to bot


 Seems to be the last thing that Ululul was screaming, repeated over
 and over again: "EJECT!... EJECT!... EJECT!..."

 It's happening again.. You can feel it...

 The bodies of Ululul and the translator bot lie motionless, both burnt
 by the now uncontrollable plasma bursts.

>type |V/.\-\.|V/.|V|.\\- on keypad


 The symbols "|v/.\-\.|v/.|v|.\\-" manifest above the keypad in an
 ephemeral, green light.

 You hear an automated Hexergon recording which the dying translator
 bot helpfully transforms into a pleasant feminine voice: "Ejecting
 reactor core... Please wait... Magnetic locks released... Core
 ejected..."

 And so it is. The unstable core blasts into space, disappearing so
 rapidly from view that it might as well have winked out of existence.
 Emergency power activates, maintaining life support and lights, but
 there's not enough power for the engines to re-stabilize orbit. The
 innards of the station groan as it lilts toward the black hole...

 Against the black orifice shines a beautiful light--the core has
 finally exploded. Seconds later the shock wave reaches you. The
 station quakes, the remaining energy relays burst into fragments, and
 the fractures within the plasticine bubble widen. You fall, knocking
 your head against the keypad.

 It's Ululul who shakes you awake, holding the mangled translator bot
 in his fingers. "The shock wave," the translator croaks for the
 injured alien. "It must have propelled the station to a higher orbit.
 We have stabilized, and help is on the way." He holds out his hand and
 as you reach out to take his, your fingertips brush, releasing a
 static discharge that makes both of you jump back. For a second
 there's silence, then the cosmos echoes with the first joint laughter
 of human and Hexergon.

 sound, and a tiny creature crawls out from underneath the pillow. It's
 unlike anything you've ever seen before, but it seems friendly enough.
 You reach out and stroke its head.

     <span class="floydstyle i">*** YOU HAVE LOST ***</span>



 <span class="floydstyle i">Freefall</span> (in the falling car)
 I am in my car, which is not bad. But my car that I am in is in
 freefall, which is a kind of bad. Did I mention that I am an object
 currently contained within this container that is my car, which is in
 freefall? Not much left for me to do at this point, and not more than
 a moment left to do it. What do I do?

>panic


 Think in concrete action verbs.

>scream


 Or, I bet there is an even more intelligible plan.

>freak out


 Concrete action verbs.

>wreck


 (the falling car)
 No kidding.

 So, that's it? That's your idea for how to use my one last moment? Oh,
 well. <span class="floydstyle em">Now it's over</span>.



     <span class="floydstyle i">*** YOU HAVE LOST ***</span>

>cry


 Or, I bet there is an even more coherent plan.

>get out


 So I kick out the door, which swings open into an immediate hail of
 bullets. This is no road gang -- this is the Curator. My chances are
 grim but I have no choice. I dive through the curtain of gunfire, and
 then I'm on the ground, mince meat, rolling, spitting blood as the car
 explodes at the bottom of the ravine.

 A roll of duct tape, probably caught by wind, spins to a stop at my
 broken legs. I didn't even realise I had packed duct tape. That could
 have come in handy earlier, but no time for regrets. I hear his
 tubercular cough, and I know that he is steadying himself for the kill
 shot. Only thing left is the dying... unless you count <span class="floydstyle em">rotating in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">his display case, hanging from a skyhook</span>.

>pray

>xyzzy


 Concrete action verbs.

>get tape


 An ant wanders round the duct tape on my wrists and finally, I lose
 it. It's all been such a slog. 'This'll be a nice relaxing afternoon,'
 I'd assumed. That is, until Lewis showed up to "borrow the car to go
 to the big box". Which would have been fine if I hadn't been in it at
 the time. I mean, I know he was pissed about the money, but really? At
 gunpoint? On a Sunday?

 Back at home an hour later, I was about to watch the game. In stormed
 Lewis with a bundle of sheet plastic, the duct tape, and this look on
 his face, and I just knew I'd miss the score. But I definitely hadn't
 counted on a long, boring drive. And when we got to the cliff-top?
 Wanker made me get out and help push, and then shoved me carelessly
 back in the car, possibly spraining my arm. And now I'm just falling
 to my death and there is an ant in here. Maybe even ants, plural!

 Now, I'm no control freak about my possessions. I ask only that they
 be returned in the exact same condition as when they were borrowed. I
 ask only that one damn thing! So... "That's it!" I exclaim, and I peel
 off the tape. Open the glove box, and out tumbles (weightless in
 freefall) my phone, followed by a pistol I keep for extreme
 emergencies. Taking up the pistol, I scream: <span class="floydstyle em">"No more Mister Nice</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Guy!"</span> But I am a moment late.

>open glove box


 I open the glove box, and out tumbles (weightless in freefall) my
 phone, followed by a pistol. Taking up the pistol, I check the clip.
 Three bullets. Three zombies. One inside (not counting the severed
 head as it is not immediately threatening). Two crawling on the hood.
 There is no more room for error, especially since the one inside just
 <span class="floydstyle em">took a bite out of my spine</span>, I've lost control of the car,
 and I'm 'infected'. Best case scenario? I survive the fall by landing
 perfectly on a pile of ghoulish corpses, only to transform ghoulishly
 into another ghoulish corpse. I don't want to be a crash test zombie.
 So I take the one-bullet exit. Just before impact, I shoot myself.
 Right in the head.

 Sadly, since neither neurological activity nor muscle movements can be
 sustained without a fully functioning circulatory system, a simple
 head injury couldn't possibly prevent what must after all be a
 supernatural transformation. So I just <span class="floydstyle em">run around in the rain with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">a hole in the brain</span>, yet another victim of urban myth.

>call 911


 <span class="floydstyle em">As I got hit by a car there was a message for me. As I went</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">through the windshield I noticed something</span>. My phone. The driver
 had an enraged look about him, which is lame. If he'd been checking
 his blind spots instead of talking on *his* phone, he wouldn't have a
 pile of sentient metal in his passenger seat right now. I say 'pile'
 but I am more of a deceptively disorganised assemblage. It's a long
 story about a mound of scrapped computer parts repeatedly struck by
 lightning in a dump down the street from the leaky nuclear plant that
 once powered a nearby decommissioned supercollider. Anyway, the only
 reason I can relate all of this is that I am self-aware.

 So I'd just got done chewing on some cable, when this dude careens
 onto the bridge going maybe 40 over the limit and drifting to the
 right. I figured this was the best chance I'd ever get, so I let go of
 my perch. I'm less than half the weight of this car, but my impact on
 the frame nearly crushed it. Luckily there was enough momentum left to
 carry us both over the side, and bingo! We are falling. My exit's
 coming up any second, but I should have time for one voicemail. The
 dude, however, is still screaming.

 "Shut up man," I croak. "I'm trying to hear this." And then he tells
 me to get out of *his* car. "It's my car now, pal! Look around." One
 look out his windshield and he's forgotten me in favour of the water
 rushing up to greet us. Which reminds me that I missed my jumpoff! I
 spring up, way up, and out, but it's just too late, and I am dunked in
 the river less than *10 metres* from the island dump's shoreline. My
 circuits are shorting. I imagine the taste-that-would-have-been:
 silicon chips dipped in steaming compost. Mmm, so close...

>inventory


 I am wearing a watch. It's made of stars. It has <span class="floydstyle em">a minute hand, a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">millenium hand, and an eon hand</span>, but all of the hands are made of
 planets. The whole assemblage is strapped, like any watch, to my
 wrist, which extends nebulously from the galaxies of my elbow like...
 a wrist. I heave a sigh, and a thousand spiral arms collide. The watch
 still reads the same as when I last checked, and I feel vaguely
 ashamed. There is no point to this behaviour when you're sitting in
 traffic that's fallen for billions of years and will fall for billions
 more.

 Don't spread it around, but I think I lost interest in the Great
 Attractor. Ever since the universe was young, when I first climbed
 into my pimped supercluster and peeled off on this whole space trip,
 the Attractor's been my compass. We were so in love. Everything was a
 big bang, then.

 However, time spins on, and I am no longer in the best of health. I'm
 afraid I might have cancer of the black hole. Besides, no matter how
 quickly I descend, the Attractor just plays hard to get. Dark energy:
 when did *that* become a factor? It's all starting to sound
 suspiciously like heat death, and I am just. So. Tired. Do you find it
 gaseous in here? I should crack a window. What do you think would
 happen if I stepped outside?

 Don't worry. I'm kidding. Ha ha. I am too old. It'd take a billion
 years I haven't got.

 chances are grim but I have no choice. I dive through the curtain of
 gunfire, and then I'm on the ground, mince meat, rolling, spitting

 A sombrero, probably caught by wind, spins to a stop at my broken
 legs. I didn't even realise I had packed a sombrero. That could have
 come in handy earlier, but no time for regrets. I hear his tubercular
 cough, and I know that he is steadying himself for the kill shot. Only

>wear sombrero


 The sombrero looks just as it did when first spotted on Mars, scooping
 samples into its wide brim with the mech extenders it stows (when not
 in use) under a central dome. Alarmists labelled it a monster. Of
 course, the probability had always been that Earth's first contact
 would be not with a sentient alien, but with an automated probe.

 And here it is, <span class="floydstyle em">gently waving in the air above the meadow</span>,
 heaped full of soil freshly sampled from my neighbourhood. Just now,
 its great scoopers retracted to be replaced by the long, thin pickers
 that sift organic matter from concrete and houses and wire. I seized
 upon this as my chance to bolt, from the bedroom (which had been
 relocated to the garage) into my car. The driveway had become just a
 cracked assemblage of tar floes, but there was still enough traction
 for me to burn rubber and rocket over that sombrero's rim.

 And so here I am, gently falling in the air above the meadow, having
 used my final moment to review the few before. And as I glimpse my
 final glimpse -- tall grasses blowing in a summer breeze -- I wish
 that I had used that final act to maybe roll down a window.

>roll down window


 Which, the windshield, the rear window, or the side windows?

>side


 I look over at the side windows just in time to see the doors buckle
 under the weight of giant robot fingers. I could have taken my chances
 and jumped earlier, but not anymore. Now I'm trapped. My body tumbles
 painfully through the interior as the giant robot swings my little car
 wildly in its giant robot playroom.

 "Stop!" I scream. "You're killing me!" And it seems to work. At least,
 the swinging stops. The car is raised to the giant robot's giant-eye
 level. I display my bloodied head and injuries, trying to appear as
 frail as humanly possible. Finally, the giant mouth opens wide,
 looking almost sad, and with a voice like chains pulled through a
 pipe, intones: <span class="floydstyle em">"ROBOTS OBEY WHAT THE CHILDREN SAY."</span>

 And then the robot giggles. Or no, there *was* a giggle, but it was a
 child's. It must have come from the giant playroom's giant intercom.
 There is another sound from that intercom -- something faint.
 Something odd. But my car radio is still on: I'd have to turn it off,
 or listen harder. But I am out of time for curiosities. "Throw it
 again!" comes the child's voice. And the robot does just that.

>listen harder


 I listen, and I do hear something -- something I recognise instantly.
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> I blurt out, curiosity rising. <span class="floydstyle em">"Who's that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">playing... the guitar?"</span> The only one I know who plays that tune
 is Jim. <span class="floydstyle em">"Is it Jim?"</span> What's he even doing here?
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> No answer. What am *I* even doing here?
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Still no answer. Car radio's off, so that can't be it.
 Am I on a crash trajectory into a concert hall? This reality is so
 half-baked.

 I check the back seat but there is nobody and nothing there except for
 a few stray candy wrappers (weightless in freefall) and a broken
 pencil. Is this a dream...? <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Should I wake up...?
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Is that the ground...? <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Please let me
 wake up. I'd better give real consideration to what will be my final--

>wake up


 I bolt upright from my bed, gasping for air. Why do I hold my breath
 in my sleep? I feel a tickle and twist my arm around to scratch at it.
 Probably <span class="floydstyle em">an ant crawling up my back in the nighttime</span>. Giving
 me the terrors. I'm relieved, but also disappointed.

 Where does my dream car go, when I stop seeing it in my mind? Either
 it crashes without me, or the memory is wiped out, never to be
 retrieved, like so many memories of a dream. Regardless, without me
 the car will surely be a wreck by morning. As I drift back to sleep I
 think of this. And of the ant. And I slip under. And it occurs to me
 that there is something else I could have done...

 Wanker made me get out and help push, and then shoved me carelessly
 back in the car, possibly spraining my arm. And now I'm just falling
 to my death and there is an ant in here. Maybe even ants, plural!

 Now, I'm no control freak about my possessions. I ask only that they
 be returned in the exact same condition as when they were borrowed. I
 ask only that one damn thing! So... "That's it!" I exclaim, and I peel
 off the tape. Open the glove box, and out tumbles (weightless in
 freefall) my phone, followed by a pistol I keep for extreme
 emergencies. Taking up the pistol, I scream: <span class="floydstyle em">"No more Mister Nice</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Guy!"</span> But I am a moment late.

 I am in my car, which is not bad. But my car that I am in is in
 freefall, which is a kind of bad. Did I mention that I am an object

 I open the glove box, and out tumbles (weightless in freefall) my
 phone, followed by a pistol. Taking up the pistol, I check the clip.
 Three bullets. Three zombies. One inside (not counting the severed
 head as it is not immediately threatening). Two crawling on the hood.
 There is no more room for error, especially since the one inside just
 <span class="floydstyle em">took a bite out of my spine</span>, I've lost control of the car,
 and I'm 'infected'. Best case scenario? I survive the fall by landing
 perfectly on a pile of ghoulish corpses, only to transform ghoulishly
 into another ghoulish corpse. I don't want to be a crash test zombie.
 So I take the one-bullet exit. Just before impact, I shoot myself.
 Right in the head.

 Sadly, since neither neurological activity nor muscle movements can be
 sustained without a fully functioning circulatory system, a simple
 head injury couldn't possibly prevent what must after all be a
 supernatural transformation. So I just <span class="floydstyle em">run around in the rain with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">a hole in the brain</span>, yet another victim of urban myth.

>inventory


 I am wearing a watch. It's made of stars. It has <span class="floydstyle em">a minute hand, a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">millenium hand, and an eon hand</span>, but all of the hands are made of
 planets. The whole assemblage is strapped, like any watch, to my
 wrist, which extends nebulously from the galaxies of my elbow like...
 a wrist. I heave a sigh, and a thousand spiral arms collide. The watch
 still reads the same as when I last checked, and I feel vaguely
 ashamed. There is no point to this behaviour when you're sitting in
 traffic that's fallen for billions of years and will fall for billions
 more.

 Don't spread it around, but I think I lost interest in the Great
 Attractor. Ever since the universe was young, when I first climbed
 into my pimped supercluster and peeled off on this whole space trip,
 the Attractor's been my compass. We were so in love. Everything was a
 big bang, then.

 However, time spins on, and I am no longer in the best of health. I'm
 afraid I might have cancer of the black hole. Besides, no matter how
 quickly I descend, the Attractor just plays hard to get. Dark energy:
 when did *that* become a factor? It's all starting to sound
 suspiciously like heat death, and I am just. So. Tired. Do you find it
 gaseous in here? I should crack a window. What do you think would
 happen if I stepped outside?

 Don't worry. I'm kidding. Ha ha. I am too old. It'd take a billion
 years I haven't got.

>take ant


 An ant wanders round the duct tape on my wrists and finally, I lose
 it. It's all been such a slog. 'This'll be a nice relaxing afternoon,'
 I'd assumed. That is, until Lewis showed up to "borrow the car to go
 to the big box". Which would have been fine if I hadn't been in it at
 the time. I mean, I know he was pissed about the money, but really? At
 gunpoint? On a Sunday?

 Back at home an hour later, I was about to watch the game. In stormed
 Lewis with a bundle of sheet plastic, the duct tape, and this look on
 his face, and I just knew I'd miss the score. But I definitely hadn't
 counted on a long, boring drive. And when we got to the cliff-top?
 Wanker made me get out and help push, and then shoved me carelessly
 back in the car, possibly spraining my arm. And now I'm just falling

 I bolt upright from my bed, gasping for air. Why do I hold my breath
 in my sleep? I feel a tickle and twist my arm around to scratch at it.
 Probably <span class="floydstyle em">an ant crawling up my back in the nighttime</span>. Giving
 me the terrors. I'm relieved, but also disappointed.

 Where does my dream car go, when I stop seeing it in my mind? Either
 it crashes without me, or the memory is wiped out, never to be
 retrieved, like so many memories of a dream. Regardless, without me
 the car will surely be a wreck by morning. As I drift back to sleep I
 think of this. And of the ant. And I slip under. And it occurs to me
 that there is something else I could have done...

>examine backward


 <span class="floydstyle em">One thousand eyes are staring</span> down at me from behind.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Everyone's walking with arms extended in a trance</span>. I don't
 know who they are. I was just driving on the freeway, then boom I was
 in a jam: the type where everybody's honking but it just gets worse.
 And then *they* came, great crowds of them: mobbing the cars, pulling
 people out, and doing something to them -- I don't know what exactly,
 but something bad, because once they'd had it done, they didn't get
 back into their vehicles. They joined the mob instead. I locked my
 doors.

 Wrong move, as it happens. When they can't get you out of a car, it's
 like there's a silent broadcast; <span class="floydstyle em">they hear the instructions: they</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">follow directions</span>. So in unison, they began to push. They pushed
 my car right off the edge of the overpass! I kept honking and tried to
 put it in gear, but no luck.

 It's not the longest fall, but long enough. Unsure what else to do, I
 punch a final blast out of the horn and then commence impact. The horn
 sticks and blares on, heralding my mutilation in this road-crumpled,
 flaming wreck. I am about to commit my remaining resources to the
 process of bleeding out all over the road, when I hear footsteps. Here
 *they* come again. It's the horn! <span class="floydstyle em">They travel great distances to</span>

 then I'm on the ground, mince meat, rolling, spitting blood as the car

 A roll of duct tape, probably caught by wind, spins to a stop at my

 have come in handy earlier, but no time for regrets. I hear his

 I haven't really figured out how the rest of it goes, or how to work
 in what happened after the crash, or how I met the girl. But I was
 thinking the chorus might go something like-- oh hey, hold on...
 Chuck! Hey! How ya doing?

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey, man! I thought you were dead. I thought you crashed your</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">car." No, man, I've been right here this whole time playing bass</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">guitar for the Mesopotamians</span>. But I *did* crash my car, only
 instead of being dead, I'm writing a song about it. "Yeah? Can I hear
 it?" Sure, no problem. "By the way, that is a kickass guitar." It's
 more than just kickass. This guitar may have saved my life in the very
 crash of which I am about to sing. "Really? In what variety of ways

 And I sang:

 <span class="floydstyle em">I make out a spiralling shape</span>. It's <span class="floydstyle em">hypnotic and strange</span>

 The car is jerking again, and in an instant we pass through a velvet
 curtain into sunlight, squealing to a stop at the starting platform.
 We never fell out; it was all a trick. The attendant unbuckles us and
 moves on to the next car, and then the next.

 "That was kinda short," I say, climbing out. "I want a refund."

>look behind


 (the rear window)
 <span class="floydstyle em">One thousand eyes are staring</span> down at me from behind.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Everyone's walking with arms extended in a trance</span>. I don't
 know who they are. I was just driving on the freeway, then boom I was
 in a jam: the type where everybody's honking but it just gets worse.
 And then *they* came, great crowds of them: mobbing the cars, pulling
 people out, and doing something to them -- I don't know what exactly,
 but something bad, because once they'd had it done, they didn't get
 back into their vehicles. They joined the mob instead. I locked my
 doors.

 Wrong move, as it happens. When they can't get you out of a car, it's
 like there's a silent broadcast; <span class="floydstyle em">they hear the instructions: they</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">follow directions</span>. So in unison, they began to push. They pushed
 my car right off the edge of the overpass! I kept honking and tried to
 put it in gear, but no luck.

 It's not the longest fall, but long enough. Unsure what else to do, I
 punch a final blast out of the horn and then commence impact. The horn
 sticks and blares on, heralding my mutilation in this road-crumpled,
 flaming wreck. I am about to commit my remaining resources to the
 process of bleeding out all over the road, when I hear footsteps. Here
 *they* come again. It's the horn! <span class="floydstyle em">They travel great distances to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the sound</span>. Maybe I should've tried singing instead. My guitar's
 in the back, or at least it was. I try to laugh, but settle for a
 bloody, final snort.

</span>

 Outside the car is a void so black, I'm perversely tempted to jump
 into it, but I restrain myself and focus, eyes-front. <span class="floydstyle em">In darkness</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">I make out a spiralling shape</span>. It's <span class="floydstyle em">hypnotic and strange</span>
 and I am starting to dig it, but the car is jerking backward and the
 seat just slides way forward and <span class="floydstyle em">I fall through the window!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Clawing at nothing I drop through the void</span>.

 The car is jerking again, and in an instant we pass through a velvet
 curtain into sunlight, squealing to a stop at the starting platform.
 We never fell out; it was all a trick. The attendant unbuckles us and
 moves on to the next car, and then the next.

 "That was kinda short," I say, climbing out. "I want a refund."
 "Giant squid was scary," she says.
 So I say, "Giant squid?"
 "You missed it," she says. "Next time, look behind."

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey, man! I thought you were dead. I thought you crashed your</span>

 So I kick out the door, which swings open into an immediate hail of
 bullets. This is no road gang -- this is the Curator. My chances are
 grim but I have no choice. I dive through the curtain of gunfire, and
 then I'm on the ground, mince meat, rolling, spitting blood as the car
 explodes at the bottom of the ravine.

 A sombrero, probably caught by wind, spins to a stop at my broken
 legs. I didn't even realise I had packed a sombrero. That could have
 come in handy earlier, but no time for regrets. I hear his tubercular
 cough, and I know that he is steadying himself for the kill shot. Only

 I bolt upright from my bed, gasping for air. Why do I hold my breath
 in my sleep? I feel a tickle and twist my arm around to scratch at it.
 Probably <span class="floydstyle em">an ant crawling up my back in the nighttime</span>. Giving
 me the terrors. I'm relieved, but also disappointed.

 Where does my dream car go, when I stop seeing it in my mind? Either
 it crashes without me, or the memory is wiped out, never to be
 retrieved, like so many memories of a dream. Regardless, without me
 the car will surely be a wreck by morning. As I drift back to sleep I
 think of this. And of the ant. And I slip under. And it occurs to me
 that there is something else I could have done...

 An ant wanders round the duct tape on my wrists and finally, I lose

 I'd assumed. That is, until Lewis showed up to "borrow the car to go
 to the big box". Which would have been fine if I hadn't been in it at
 the time. I mean, I know he was pissed about the money, but really? At
 gunpoint? On a Sunday?

 Back at home an hour later, I was about to watch the game. In stormed
 Lewis with a bundle of sheet plastic, the duct tape, and this look on
 his face, and I just knew I'd miss the score. But I definitely hadn't
 counted on a long, boring drive. And when we got to the cliff-top?
 Wanker made me get out and help push, and then shoved me carelessly
 back in the car, possibly spraining my arm. And now I'm just falling
 to my death and there is an ant in here. Maybe even ants, plural!

 Now, I'm no control freak about my possessions. I ask only that they
 be returned in the exact same condition as when they were borrowed. I
 ask only that one damn thing! So... "That's it!" I exclaim, and I peel
 off the tape. Open the glove box, and out tumbles (weightless in
 freefall) my phone, followed by a pistol I keep for extreme
 emergencies. Taking up the pistol, I scream: <span class="floydstyle em">"No more Mister Nice</span>

>push button


 No question about it: the void is much improved over its former self.
 Oh, I dabbled in reality, but as it turns out, the universe sucks, so
 I vowed to destroy it. But you can't, from inside. There is a very old
 legend on my world, about an exit ramp from the actual universe. I
 know -- it sounds superstitious, even to me (and I've been honouring
 the road gods for a thousand years). They say you have to ride the
 most snarled cloverleafs in the galaxy to get there. We're talking
 round-the-clock rush hour through centuries worth of interlooping
 overpasses and curves.

 Most just laugh this story off, but they don't have my passion. I
 actually looked for it. I actually found it. It wasn't easy: I had to
 buy the deed to the property from a realtor on his deathbed. <span class="floydstyle em">"Have</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">no fear,"</span> he said. <span class="floydstyle em">"You will be killed right away."</span> I
 thought that was honest at least, so I paid the man and proceeded to
 <span class="floydstyle em">kiss the girl from Venus, for science</span> (or more specifically,
 for the superweapon intel she had stored on her glandtop).

 As advertised, the exit ramp led exactly nowhere. On my way out I
 pulled a 180, just like we used to do in the parking stadium back
 home. Only this time I <span class="floydstyle em">got those missiles ready to destroy the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">universe</span>. My rate of spin brought my targeting scope to bear for
 just a moment. It was enough. I pushed the button and let fly.

 Now it's just me and the void. And the falling. I don't know why I'm
 still alive, but that realtor was dead wrong, and now he's just dead.
 But at least I've got my car. Hmm. Odometer's blinking something
 unreadable. Must have got cracked in the missile launch. So I just
 stare at my watch for a while.

 Where there would normally be an odometer, I've installed a
 chronometer. It reads, March 24th, 2012, 12:02 pm, which was exactly
 my incursion target, so why I am falling? What could possibly have
 gone wrong? I stole this temporal gear from Doctor Technopia.
 Everybody says she's the best. Did I just forget a diagnostic? And
 then it hits me:

 Elevation. 300 million years of sedimentary deposits. So, how many
 metres of elevation? I don't know, because I forgot to calculate! I
 *only* corrected for all of Earth's possible trajectories through

>examine watch


 I am wearing a watch. It's made of stars. It has <span class="floydstyle em">a minute hand, a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">millenium hand, and an eon hand</span>, but all of the hands are made of
 planets. The whole assemblage is strapped, like any watch, to my
 wrist, which extends nebulously from the galaxies of my elbow like...
 a wrist. I heave a sigh, and a thousand spiral arms collide. The watch
 still reads the same as when I last checked, and I feel vaguely
 ashamed. There is no point to this behaviour when you're sitting in
 traffic that's fallen for billions of years and will fall for billions
 more.

 Don't spread it around, but I think I lost interest in the Great
 Attractor. Ever since the universe was young, when I first climbed
 into my pimped supercluster and peeled off on this whole space trip,
 the Attractor's been my compass. We were so in love. Everything was a
 big bang, then.

 However, time spins on, and I am no longer in the best of health. I'm
 afraid I might have cancer of the black hole. Besides, no matter how
 quickly I descend, the Attractor just plays hard to get. Dark energy:
 when did *that* become a factor? It's all starting to sound
 suspiciously like heat death, and I am just. So. Tired. Do you find it
 gaseous in here? I should crack a window. What do you think would
 happen if I stepped outside?

 Don't worry. I'm kidding. Ha ha. I am too old. It'd take a billion
 years I haven't got.

>swap brains


 Concrete action verbs.

>kill zombies


 I open the glove box, and out tumbles (weightless in freefall) my
 phone, followed by a pistol. Taking up the pistol, I check the clip.
 Three bullets. Three zombies. One inside (not counting the severed
 head as it is not immediately threatening). Two crawling on the hood.
 There is no more room for error, especially since the one inside just
 <span class="floydstyle em">took a bite out of my spine</span>, I've lost control of the car,
 and I'm 'infected'. Best case scenario? I survive the fall by landing
 perfectly on a pile of ghoulish corpses, only to transform ghoulishly
 into another ghoulish corpse. I don't want to be a crash test zombie.
 So I take the one-bullet exit. Just before impact, I shoot myself.
 Right in the head.

 Sadly, since neither neurological activity nor muscle movements can be
 sustained without a fully functioning circulatory system, a simple
 head injury couldn't possibly prevent what must after all be a
 supernatural transformation. So I just <span class="floydstyle em">run around in the rain with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">a hole in the brain</span>, yet another victim of urban myth.

>restore brain


 I seem to think I should try to restore.

>look forward


 Outside the car is a void so black, I'm perversely tempted to jump
 into it, but I restrain myself and focus, eyes-front. <span class="floydstyle em">In darkness</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">I make out a spiralling shape</span>. It's <span class="floydstyle em">hypnotic and strange</span>
 and I am starting to dig it, but the car is jerking backward and the
 seat just slides way forward and <span class="floydstyle em">I fall through the window!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Clawing at nothing I drop through the void</span>.

 The car is jerking again, and in an instant we pass through a velvet
 curtain into sunlight, squealing to a stop at the starting platform.
 We never fell out; it was all a trick. The attendant unbuckles us and
 moves on to the next car, and then the next.

 "That was kinda short," I say, climbing out. "I want a refund."
 "Giant squid was scary," she says.
 So I say, "Giant squid?"
 "You missed it," she says. "Next time, look behind."

>examine side window


 I look over at the side windows just in time to see the doors buckle
 under the weight of giant robot fingers. I could have taken my chances
 and jumped earlier, but not anymore. Now I'm trapped. My body tumbles
 painfully through the interior as the giant robot swings my little car
 wildly in its giant robot playroom.

 "Stop!" I scream. "You're killing me!" And it seems to work. At least,
 the swinging stops. The car is raised to the giant robot's giant-eye
 level. I display my bloodied head and injuries, trying to appear as
 frail as humanly possible. Finally, the giant mouth opens wide,
 looking almost sad, and with a voice like chains pulled through a
 pipe, intones: <span class="floydstyle em">"ROBOTS OBEY WHAT THE CHILDREN SAY."</span>

 And then the robot giggles. Or no, there *was* a giggle, but it was a
 child's. It must have come from the giant playroom's giant intercom.
 There is another sound from that intercom -- something faint.
 Something odd. But my car radio is still on: I'd have to turn it off,
 or listen harder. But I am out of time for curiosities. "Throw it
 again!" comes the child's voice. And the robot does just that.

>turn off radio


 The radio is currently off, so I take the opportunity to turn it back
 on. Might as well. The dashboard is blinking some kind of a warning
 light, and there's an audio alert, but I'd rather hear the song -- I
 love this song. Earth radio is the best. Not that there is any other
 radio; at least, not since I destroyed all other life on the moon for
 being so annoying. It's a long story, but seriously they deserved it.
 The next time the Earthlings came <span class="floydstyle em">by rocket to the moon... I was</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the only living creature there</span>.

 I made sure they didn't spot me. I was a longtime listener of course,
 and had definite plans to visit, but only a monkey'd bet his ass on a
 can covered in tin foil. I wanted to arrive in style, so I started on
 my own rig in '73. Just finished yesterday. If you can spot a slight
 resemblance to a '57 Chevy with warp drive, it's intentional. (Had a
 little trouble with the theory part, so the nacelles are decorative --
 for now.)

 Anyway the point is: Earth, here I come! Watched from orbit for a
 while, but that's just dull. Would *Jim Kirk* watch from orbit? No, so
 let's get dirty: I have started my descent. My retro rockets just
 fired. I am stoked! How do I look? Does my slime glisten? There's a
 bacterial comb in the glove box next to the grav gun. By the way, I
 don't really have a landing plan, but you guys can just beam me out of
 here, right?

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> No answer. What am *I* even doing here?
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Still no answer. Car radio's off, so that can't be it.
 Am I on a crash trajectory into a concert hall? This reality is so
 half-baked.

 I check the back seat but there is nobody and nothing there except for
 a few stray candy wrappers (weightless in freefall) and a broken
 pencil. Is this a dream...? <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Should I wake up...?
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Is that the ground...? <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey!"</span> Please let me

 The tip of the pencil is worn nearly to a nub. I chew at it as I
 survey my handiwork. Terrible. The car looks totally irregular, like
 it's already been through a previous accident. The wheels don't even
 seem all the same size. And my head's a little big, but then I always
 do that when I doodle.

 Something's really not right, though. I mean, granted, <span class="floydstyle em">I am not</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">allowed to meet the criminal government agent who oppresses me</span>.
 (I don't even ask.) But there is something more. 'Why wouldn't I just
 jump?' I realise. 'Something has to block the doors.' Furiously I
 erase the crashed car, which leaves an indelible smudge on my scenery,
 but it's fine. It's just a sketch. Let's just call it <span class="floydstyle em">paper stains</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">on the grey utility pole</span>. Besides, I only get one scrap paper at
 a time out of the guards on this shift.

 Carefully positioning the torn envelope on my last bit of floor that
 doesn't stick, I start again.

>examine severed head


 I can't see the mirror from my beaker, but I am feeling pretty dull.
 They say the brain-soup in here's good for about 20 minutes, but they
 say a lot of things, and nobody ever came back from a decapitation to
 say otherwise. They also say the old days were soft and I agree, but
 when it comes to executions, give me the needle any day. Of course,
 back then there would also be a trial. That was before the invention
 of cheap, mass-produced 3D replicators sparked the rapid conversion of
 12% of the Earth's land mass into kittens. Catpocalypse changed
 everything, and now you can't even replicate ONE GUY's sister without
 wild hordes of grimey road punks calling for your head -- and they
 will get it. In a beaker. Delivered in your car by airdrop to the
 public square.

 I understand they're pissed. But why destroy the car? There are still
 packs of mutant felines hunting in every hollow; good transport is
 what keeps us alive. Besides, it's history on wheels. My history. They
 want me to watch it die. Well I won't do it. I close my eyes. I expect
 to hear the crash first, but all at once I am flung through the
 windshield and... bullseye? I guess. I can't see anymore. Did the
 crowd stand? <span class="floydstyle em">Did a large procession wave their torches as my head</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">fell in the basket?</span> Maybe, if I'd bothered to check the front
 window before falling through it, I could have figured how to tumble
 in a more annoying way.

 The score is: YOU LOSE.

>break guitar


 My guitar is in the back. Why is that important? Why focus on that,
 now? I'm in freefall. Maybe this is not the best time to be ogling my
 guitar. Maybe I should pay more attention to, oh I don't know... the
 front windshield? Too late now, though, isn't it?

 And I have been so absorbed in this stupid line of thinking around my
 guitar that I only just now realised that the inside of the vehicle is
 suddenly smaller and <span class="floydstyle em">I am dragging my feet across my back, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">feeling this feeling in my spine</span>, like... <span class="floydstyle em">I believe I'll be</span>

>sing


 I haven't really figured out how the rest of it goes, or how to work
 in what happened after the crash, or how I met the girl. But I was
 thinking the chorus might go something like-- oh hey, hold on...
 Chuck! Hey! How ya doing?

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hey, man! I thought you were dead. I thought you crashed your</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">car." No, man, I've been right here this whole time playing bass</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">guitar for the Mesopotamians</span>. But I *did* crash my car, only
 instead of being dead, I'm writing a song about it. "Yeah? Can I hear
 it?" Sure, no problem. "By the way, that is a kickass guitar." It's
 more than just kickass. This guitar may have saved my life in the very
 crash of which I am about to sing. "Really? In what variety of ways
 could that possibly occur?"

 And I sang:

>get out


 So I kick out the door, which swings open into an immediate hail of
 bullets. This is no road gang -- this is the Curator. My chances are
 grim but I have no choice. I dive through the curtain of gunfire, and
 then I'm on the ground, mince meat, rolling, spitting blood as the car
 explodes at the bottom of the ravine.

 A roll of duct tape, probably caught by wind, spins to a stop at my
 broken legs. I didn't even realise I had packed duct tape. That could
 have come in handy earlier, but no time for regrets. I hear his
 tubercular cough, and I know that he is steadying himself for the kill
 shot. Only thing left is the dying... unless you count <span class="floydstyle em">rotating in</span>

>say xyzzy to robot


 I look over at the side windows just in time to see the doors buckle
 under the weight of giant robot fingers. I could have taken my chances
 and jumped earlier, but not anymore. Now I'm trapped. My body tumbles
 painfully through the interior as the giant robot swings my little car
 wildly in its giant robot playroom.

 "Stop!" I scream. "You're killing me!" And it seems to work. At least,
 the swinging stops. The car is raised to the giant robot's giant-eye
 level. I display my bloodied head and injuries, trying to appear as
 frail as humanly possible. Finally, the giant mouth opens wide,
 looking almost sad, and with a voice like chains pulled through a
 pipe, intones: <span class="floydstyle em">"ROBOTS OBEY WHAT THE CHILDREN SAY."</span>

 And then the robot giggles. Or no, there *was* a giggle, but it was a
 child's. It must have come from the giant playroom's giant intercom.
 There is another sound from that intercom -- something faint.
 Something odd. But my car radio is still on: I'd have to turn it off,
 or listen harder. But I am out of time for curiosities. "Throw it
 again!" comes the child's voice. And the robot does just that.

>say wingardium leviosa


 But who to say that to?

>wake up


 I bolt upright from my bed, gasping for air. Why do I hold my breath
 in my sleep? I feel a tickle and twist my arm around to scratch at it.
 Probably <span class="floydstyle em">an ant crawling up my back in the nighttime</span>. Giving
 me the terrors. I'm relieved, but also disappointed.

 Where does my dream car go, when I stop seeing it in my mind? Either
 it crashes without me, or the memory is wiped out, never to be
 retrieved, like so many memories of a dream. Regardless, without me
 the car will surely be a wreck by morning. As I drift back to sleep I
 think of this. And of the ant. And I slip under. And it occurs to me
 that there is something else I could have done...

>defy gravity

>examine button


 No question about it: the void is much improved over its former self.
 Oh, I dabbled in reality, but as it turns out, the universe sucks, so
 I vowed to destroy it. But you can't, from inside. There is a very old
 legend on my world, about an exit ramp from the actual universe. I
 know -- it sounds superstitious, even to me (and I've been honouring
 the road gods for a thousand years). They say you have to ride the
 most snarled cloverleafs in the galaxy to get there. We're talking
 round-the-clock rush hour through centuries worth of interlooping
 overpasses and curves.

 Most just laugh this story off, but they don't have my passion. I
 actually looked for it. I actually found it. It wasn't easy: I had to
 buy the deed to the property from a realtor on his deathbed. <span class="floydstyle em">"Have</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">no fear,"</span> he said. <span class="floydstyle em">"You will be killed right away."</span> I
 thought that was honest at least, so I paid the man and proceeded to
 <span class="floydstyle em">kiss the girl from Venus, for science</span> (or more specifically,
 for the superweapon intel she had stored on her glandtop).

 As advertised, the exit ramp led exactly nowhere. On my way out I
 pulled a 180, just like we used to do in the parking stadium back
 home. Only this time I <span class="floydstyle em">got those missiles ready to destroy the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">universe</span>. My rate of spin brought my targeting scope to bear for
 just a moment. It was enough. I pushed the button and let fly.

 Now it's just me and the void. And the falling. I don't know why I'm
 still alive, but that realtor was dead wrong, and now he's just dead.
 But at least I've got my car. Hmm. Odometer's blinking something
 unreadable. Must have got cracked in the missile launch. So I just
 stare at my watch for a while.

 Must be Tuesday. Same bar, same crowd, except this week its Bill who
 has stumbled up to you, the one side of his face looking like a
 sledgehammer had its way with him.

 "Hey!" he growls, shoving your shoulder. "Hey! I'm talking to you!"
 He leans down, his breath fuming with anger and booze. He points at
 the bruise. "Last week... Aren't you the guy..." He points at his
 bruise again. "Aren't you the guy who hit me in the eye?"

 Yep. It's Tuesday. And like every Tuesday, you've got one move to
 keep this guy from hitting <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> in the eye.

 "I'm telling ya," Bill slurs at you. "All ya need to do is say yes,
 no, or point at the person who hit me." He fists creak as they clench.

 The other regulars pay no attention to the standoff at the bar. After
 all, it's a Tuesday.

 "Well, I need to hit someone," Bill admits, "so it might as well be
 you." In baseball they call a strike a "swing and a miss..."
 Unfortunately, this is not baseball.

 "Fine," Bill growls, then punches you dead in the face.

 Aric's generally willing to cool off.

 Short and stout, and surprisingly intellectual and liberal for this
 particular neighborhood. Cedric wrestled in college, so it's best to
 avoid him, especially if Dick is around. You see, Dick was Cedric's
 roommate back in the day... and slept with most, if not all, of
 Cedric's girlfriends. Nothing makes Cedric happier than seeing Dick
 hit the floor.

 "If that's how you want it," Bill growls, then punches you dead in the

 thousand dollars, which you did--but he'll never be able to prove it.
 Regardless, he'll come after you with any chance he gets.

 "Whatever," Bill growls, then punches you dead in the face.

 Bill relaxes his fists, raises his fingers to his head, and declares,
 "America salutes you." He then dives after Dick.

 Dick upends his table, and Bill crashes into it. Bill drops like a
 sack, but for good measure, Dick gives him a swift kick.

 Clearly searching for someone to fight, Dick looks around, locks his
 gaze on you, and gives you an evil grin. "You're next," he sneers.
 And, yes... yes, you are...

 Quick as a fox, Aric avoids Bill's attack, grabs a chair and smashes
 it over Bill's head. Bill crumples.

 Seeing that Bill is out of commission, Aric grins maniacally, and sits
 down with his beer.

 And just as quickly as it started, the brawl ends with Bill strewn
 across the floor. You turn back to your drink, happy to note that the
 bartender, Butler, has returned.

 "Another Tuesday, sir?" he asks, looking over the carnage while

 and within moments, Bill passes out.

 Cedric stands, dusts himself off, and is about to return to his chair
 when he spots Dick. "Philanderer! Rake! Wolf!" he shouts, and promptly
 leaps upon his old roommate.

 Dick upends his table, and Cedric crashes into it. Cedric drops like a

 "Hey!" he growls, shoving your shoulder. "Hey! I'm talking to you!"
 He leans down, his breath fuming with anger and booze. He points at
 the bruise. "Last week... Aren't you the guy..." He points at his
 bruise again. "Aren't you the guy who hit me in the eye?"

 Yep. It's Tuesday. And like every Tuesday, you've got one move to
 keep this guy from hitting <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> in the eye.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bar</span>
 The local dive, home to local ruffians, including yourself. You're at
 your usual spot along the counter, and everyone else is in their usual
 spot, except for Cedric whose breath continues to grace your face in
 an alcoholic fog.

 "I'm telling ya," Cedric slurs at you. "All ya need to do is say yes,
 no, or point at the person who hit me." He fists creak as they clench.

 The other regulars pay no attention to the standoff at the bar. After
 all, it's a Tuesday.

>hit cedric


 Oh, what the Hell... Cedric's sloppy drunk. Maybe you can--

 Before you can even finish the thought, the world reels, and you
 realize that awful crunch is the sloppy drunk not so sloppily slamming
 his fist into your eye.

>hit dick


 Forget it. Dick's looking for any excuse to take you down. You're not
 going to give him one.
 "Whatever," Cedric growls, then punches you dead in the face.

>point at dick


 "Ah, yes, I remember now. How distasteful of me to forget. If you will
 excuse me..." Within moments, he's attempting to put Dick in a
 headlock.

 Dick upends his table, and Cedric crashes into it. Cedric drops like a
 sack, but for good measure, Dick gives him a swift kick.

 Clearly searching for someone to fight, Dick looks around, locks his
 gaze on you, and gives you an evil grin. "You're next," he sneers.
 And, yes... yes, you are...

>point at bill


 "Ah, yes, I remember now. How distasteful of me to forget. If you will
 excuse me..." Within moments, he's attempting to put Bill in a
 headlock.

 Military training springing to life, Bill deftly deflects Cedric's
 attacks, then brings his elbow down squarely between Cedric's shoulder
 blades. Cedric collapses to the floor.

 Bill rises, eager for a fight, but then notices Cedric's body on the
 floor. "That's what you get for voting Democrat, jerk." Smiling, he
 returns to his drink.

 And just as quickly as it started, the brawl ends with Cedric strewn
 across the floor. You turn back to your drink, happy to note that the
 bartender, Butler, has returned.

 "Another Tuesday, sir?" he asks, looking over the carnage while
 cleaning a glass.

 "Another Tuesday," you agree.

 "Another drink, sir?"

 You agree to that, too.

 Must be Tuesday. Same bar, same crowd, except this week its Aric who
 has stumbled up to you, the one side of his face looking like a
 sledgehammer had its way with him.

>examine dick


 True to his name, that's all you can say. You avoid him like the
 plague, especially since he believes you fleeced him of several
 thousand dollars, which you did--but he'll never be able to prove it.
 Regardless, he'll come after you with any chance he gets.

 "If yer not gonna say anything," Dick growls, then punches you dead in
 the face.

>point at cedric


 Thankfully, Dick lowers his fists. "I'll take care of him," he
 rumbles, but then he returns his glare to you. "I'll come for you,
 next." Then he's off, hollering at the top of his lungs, preparing to
 wrap his hands around Cedric's neck.

 Dick has no chance. Cedric quickly wraps Dick's neck in a scissor lock
 and within moments, Dick passes out.

 Cedric stands, dusts himself off, and determining that there is no
 reason to continue the fight (especially since Dick has been knocked
 cold), he calmly returns to his seat.

 And just as quickly as it started, the brawl ends with Dick strewn
 across the floor. You turn back to your drink, happy to note that the

 rumbles, but then he returns his glare to you. "I'll come for you,
 next." Then he's off, hollering at the top of his lungs, preparing to
 wrap his hands around Aric's neck.

 Quick as a fox, Aric avoids Dick's attack, grabs a chair and smashes
 it over Dick's head. Dick crumples.

 Seething with adrenaline, Aric looks around, spots his arch-nemesis,
 Bill, grabs a stool, and charges!

 Military training springing to life, Bill deftly deflects Aric's
 attacks, then brings his elbow down squarely between Aric's shoulder
 blades. Aric collapses to the floor.

 Bill immediately leaps up from his opponent's body, spots Cedric, and
 in his alcohol- and adrenaline-induced rage screams, "Commie! Pinko!
 You either love this country or you leave it! And now you're gonna
 leave it!" He grabs his bottle, smashes it against the table, and
 assaults Cedric.

 Bill has no chance. Cedric quickly wraps Bill's neck in a scissor lock
 and within moments, Bill passes out.

 Cedric stands, dusts himself off, and determining that there is no
 reason to continue the fight (especially since Dick has been knocked
