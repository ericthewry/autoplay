 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Just your luck. You were on your way to your Aunt Mabel's 100th
 birthday party when your car finally gave up the ghost. Not like it
 hasn't been trying to do that for weeks, but on a student budget a
 newer car was out of reach. Nothing to do but walk to the nearest town
 and see about other transportation.

 Type "about" for more information.

 By Your Car
 You're standing on a stretch of road by your car. On the sides of the
 road is nothing but flat, dry ground and nothing to see at all to the
 horizon. The sign you passed a few miles back said it was about 10
 miles to the nearest town, the name of which you've already forgotten.
 Seeing as it's even farther back to the previous town, the only way to
 go is forward to the east.

 Curb detracts from the scenic value of the vicinity.

 You can also see your car and a road sign here.

>examine me
 You're tall and thirsty. Too old to be drifting loose, too young to
 have done anything much to deserve confirmation - your tattoos show
 that much.

>examine tattoos
 Your right arm, left hand and the left side of your face are partially
 covered with blocky, rounded glyphs precisely specifying your age,
 blood type, status (social, economic, marital) and affiliations
 (birth-clan, adopted clan, moiety, college). None of which are going to
 impress anybody, except for the adopted-clan part, perhaps; Aunt
 Mabel's reputation extends across the known world. But even so, the
 conspicuous hollow circles on the backs of both hands mark you as
 unconfirmed.

 Curb skitters about.

>examine curb
 Now this here is a pedigree Chattanooga brindled mooch-hound. This
 noble breed, of which Curb forms paradigm and pinnacle, is eight kinds
 of crazy, twelve kinds of stupid and every kind of mean.

 You didn't exactly plan for a hound. A friend's bitch whelped, you were
 trying to act cute around a girl, and you were not at that time
 familiar with the quirks of the breed. The puppy got a home, you got a
 lifelong companion, the girl got eight stitches and the hell out of
 Dodge.

 Curb scratches his ear.

>examine car
 This piece of junk has seen you through three years of school. You just
 needed it to last a little longer. Too bad it didn't. Other than that,
 it's got the usual things you'd find on a car... steering wheel, those
 little pedals that's supposed to make it go "zoom," oh, and there's
 also a trunk in back.

 Thrown across the back seat you can see the guitar.

 Curb peers curiously at Treasure Huntery Lesson 1.

>take guitar
 The car isn't open.

 Curb gnaws hungrily on his own forepaw.

>open door
 You can't see any such thing.

>open car
 You open the car.

 Curb writhes about on his back, kicking his hind legs.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your car keys
   an alligator stetson (being worn)
   your panga
   Treasure Huntery Lesson 1

 Curb sniffs at the road sign like the horrible little pervert he is.

>examine sign
 At some juncture of the distant past it may, you surmise, have
 displayed information of some kind; the original content has been
 effaced, but it still tells you something; to wit, folks here have ammo
 to waste and don't mind shooting at trash.

 Curb peers curiously at the car keys.

>take guitar
 Taken.

>play guitar
 You play a few notes of "Puff, the Magic Dragon". Contrary to IF
 convention, you actually play quite well.

>open trunk
 Twenty hours on the road are starting to take its toll on your motor
 skills: on the first try, you fumble the keys and drop them onto the
 blacktop. With a yelp of joy, Curb snaps them up and dodges out of
 reach. Well, fuck.

 Curb starts at nothing, and half falls over in a desperate attempt to
 escape it.

>take keys
 That dog has a laudable attitude towards the defence of private
 property, and you have no desire to add a ragged, septic hand wound to
 your troubles.

 Curb attempts to swallow your car keys, chokes, and brings them back
 up. He doesn't drop them, though.

>hit dog
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

   Treasure Huntery Lesson 1

 Curb attempts to swallow your car keys, chokes, and brings them back
 up. He doesn't drop them, though.

 You vigorously pat Curb's head until he closes his eyes and nearly
 falls asleep. The second you stop, though, he returns to his same old
 self.

 Curb attempts to howl, but it devolves into a whimper.

>read lesson
 "Treasure Huntery Lesson 1: Maps" is a slim pamphlet that gives just
 the basics. You've read it a thousand times, but it never hurts to have
 it on hand.

 Curb snaps at flies.

>push car eas
 You can't see any such thing.

>push car east
 The car cannot be pushed from place to place.

 Curb chases his tail, squealing frustration.

>read pamphlet
 You can't see any such thing.

>cut off curb's tail
 You can't see any such thing.

>read treasure huntery
 "The first thing any treasure hunter needs is a map. It's no good to
 just go looking for treasure with no idea of where to look! You may be
 skeptical about the existence of actual treasure maps, but in fact the
 people who hid treasure generally wanted to be able to find it again,
 or even to let their heirs or accomplices find it in the event that
 they could not. This doesn't mean they made it easy!"

>go east
 It might be a good idea to close the car first.

>close car.e.
 You close the car.

 You silently trudge down the road toward the town, wherever it may be.

 Paved Highway
 This lonely stretch of road seems to continue east toward the horizon.
 The sides of the road haven't changed much either. It's still flat, dry
 ground. You can see your car in the distance to the west.

 A ways down the road you can make out a solitary billboard.

 Curb scampers after you.

>examine trunk
 Yep. It's a trunk, and it's at the back of the car. You can't remember
 if you put anything useful in there before you left your house or not.

 Naturally, a protective geesoofus is prominently displayed. You
 wouldn't cross the badlands without one.

 you've got to keep some things sacred.

 Curb attempts to swallow your car keys, chokes, and brings them back

>give panga to dog
 Curb watches the panga with a sceptical eye, considers its merits
 relative to the car keys, decides that you're trying to manipulate him
 and scampers to a safe distance.

 Curb attempts to swallow your car keys, chokes, and brings them back
 up. He doesn't drop them, though.

>examine panga
 Two feet of heavy, sharp iron with a single blade. Machete, some call
 it. It's not much, but you're stuck with it.

 When you was born, your folks were in a bad way; they'd just gotten run
 out of the Dakotas, were getting just whatever work they could find
 till a House turned up that was accepting indentured, and didn't have
 the money to get anything better. So you got bound to this overgrown
 sheath-knife.

 It's a good tool and all, and your folks did all they could to get it,
 but - any road, you're bound to it now, so make the best of it.

>examine billboard
 FIFTYMILE
 Critter Museum & General Store
 * Water - Tobbaco - Erotica - Local Crafts *

 The paint's faded and worn away in patches, and you can see no evidence
 of life; but that needn't mean anything, out here.

>lick billboard
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go east
 You continue to trudge down the road, you car falling away from sight
 behind you.

 Junction
 As the highway continues to the east, you can see a rutted dirt path
 heading off to the north toward what looks like a small farmhouse.

 Curb scampers after you.

>examine farmhouse
 It's seen better days.

>go north
 You head toward the small farmhouse.

 Trading Post Porch
 A wide porch of wood slats, with the obligatory animal skulls nailed up
 against the wall. South leads back to the road; north takes you inside.

 Just outside the shadowed doorway, a parched corpse slumps in a
 rocking-chair, a long gun across his knees.

 Curb scampers after you.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>examine corpse
 Tall guy. Thin, but that's most likely just how you get when you dry
 out. Old clothes; someone already took his hat and been through his
 pockets. Buzzards been at him, so you can't tell much else. Had a red
 beard. Gun still lying across his lap.

 Curb attempts to swallow your car keys, chokes, and brings them back
 up. He doesn't drop them, though.

>examine gun
 Long enough barrel, but it's just a home-made matchlock. Badly made,
 too - the lock's blown wide open. Likely that's what got him. Certainly
 didn't help him any.

>take gun
 With a sharp tug, you pull the gun from the corpse's stiff hands. As
 you do, the blasted lock falls apart entirely, leaving you with just
 the long musket-barrel.

>examine barrel
 A musket barrel about five and a half feet long. More suited to a
 drainpipe than a gun, but you're in no place to judge.

 Curb snaps at flies.

>go north
 Trading Post Main Room
 Light spills through dust-caked windows and cracks in the log walls. It
 doesn't show up much. Some shelves, an old counter that may once have
 held a till, an uneven plank floor; must have been looted a dozen times
 over. Over in one corner there's a trapdoor.

 On the shelves are a Twinkie, a strip of bison jerky, and a Son of Toil
 bar.

 No phone, of course. Not that you were expecting one, at this point.

 Curb scampers after you.

>take all
 Twinkie: Taken.
 strip of bison jerky: Taken.
 Son of Toil bar: Taken.

>give jerky to curb
 You wave the strip of bison jerky at Curb. His ears prick up, and he
 abandons the car keys immediately, almost taking your fingers off as he
 snatches the delicious treat away from you.

 Curb attempts to howl, but it devolves into a whimper.

>take keys
 You steel your courage. Dog slobber is no picnic.

 Taken.

 You insert your key in the trunk and it pops open.

>look in trunk
 In the trunk are a glow-jar and an offering.

>take all from trunk
 glow-jar: Taken.
 offering: Not much you can do with these until you have some form of
 transport; you sure as hell ain't smoking them.

 Curb peers curiously at the panga.

>examine offering
 One thousand packs of filterless Camels, your birthday gift to Aunt
 Mabel. Hopefully it'll be a sufficient offering for her to confirm you,
 but that's no sure thing.

 Curb snatches up the offering in his mouth and gnaws noisily at it.

>PLay guitar
 You play a few notes of some Rick Astley song you can't remember the
 name of. Contrary to IF convention, you actually play quite well.

>examine jar
>play guitar
 Some of the crazier hill-tribes sell this glowy liquid stuff. It's
 nasty stuff - you wouldn't want to get it on your skin - but you figure
 that if it's sealed in a Ball jar you should be just fine. Anyhow, it
 gives off a decent light that never goes out, which is why you paid
 fifty smokes for it.

 You play a few notes of "Chobits ending theme 2". Contrary to IF
 convention, you actually play quite well.

 Eyes rolling nervously, Curb hunches over and humps thin air.

>go east
 It might be a good idea to close the trunk first.

>close trunk. e. e. n. n.
 You slam down the trunk and it clicks shut.

 Curb scampers after you.

>open trapdoor
 You open the trapdoor.

 A pale moth flutters out of the cellar. You reflexively make a warding
 sign - though they don't help much with Curb, so their potency against
 curses and doom seems to be limited.

 Curb writhes about on his back, kicking his hind legs.

>go down
 Holding the glow-jar before you, panga at the ready, you cautiously
 descend into the cellar.

 Root Cellar
 Plenty of sweat went into digging this cellar out, and it smells like
 it. Wooden shelves are hammered into the dirt walls, covered in grime.
 Dirt steps are cut into one wall, leading up to a trap door.

 You hear an eager whine, and Curb barrels into the trap-door from
 above, which just misses your head as it slams shut.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>curse
 Blasphemy!

>kill curb with panga
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine trapdoor
 A crude wooden trapdoor bolted into the floor with rustic iron hinges.

 A heavy sound suggests Curb might have been walking around, but just
 sat down again.

>look

 Dirt steps are cut into one wall, leading up to a trap door.

 It sounds like Curb is gnawing on something above the trapdoor.

>examine shelves
 Ain't much to one of these shelves. A couple of two-by-fours sunk into
 the wall, and some one-by-fours set across, and some dirt.

 Curb scuffles at the trapdoor, as though trying to dig through it.

>search shelves
 There is nothing on the cellar shelves.

>search dirt
 Which do you mean, the packed dirt, the dirt corner, or the dirt steps?

>corner
 You find nothing of interest.

>search packed dirt
 You find nothing of interest.

>dig packed dirt
 With what, your panga?

 Curb howls mournfully. Thank goodness the trapdoor muffles some sound.

>yes
 Well, if you must, you must. It's a tool before all else, it's true.
 You start hacking away at the dirt.

 It's a really crummy tool for this job, though.

 After a while, you hear a "thunk", and realize you've hit wood. A
 little more work, and you realize there's a sort of a cubby down there
 - a place to stash things where they won't be disturbed. Except by
 jerks with pangas, of course.

>examine wood
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cubby
 A rough hole has been hacked into the ground here, down to a little
 cubby made of wood. Tucked into the cubby are a diary, an old bolt, and
 a piece of paper.

>take all
 diary: Taken.
 old bolt: Taken.
 piece of paper: Taken.

>read paper
 An old, brittle, yellowing piece of paper, maybe once a shopping list,
 written in big, painful capital letters. Some of it has succumbed to
 time, but what you can read says:

 (smudge) RTS CREAM
 2 DOSEN EGG
 6 HINDGE BOLTS
 50# LEAD FOR SHOOTING
 HALF DOSEN LEMONS
 MEDECENE FO(smudge)MPA

 The rest is all a blur.

 You hear the familiar sounds of Curb eating his own vomit.

>examine diary
 A worn-out leather diary, written in a crabbed hand. Your letters were
 never all so good as that, and you wouldn't want to try reading this
 mess in anything but good light.

>look
 Root Cellar
 Plenty of sweat went into digging this cellar out, and it smells like
 it. Wooden shelves are hammered into the dirt walls, covered in grime.
 Dirt steps are cut into one wall, leading up to a trap door. A rough
 hole has been dug - or cut, really - into the corner.

 Curb howls mournfully. Thank goodness the trapdoor muffles some sound.

>smell cellar
 You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine shelves
 Ain't much to one of these shelves. A couple of two-by-fours sunk into
 the wall, and some one-by-fours set across, and some dirt.

>take shelves
 That's hardly portable.

>go up
>examine bolt
 You try to open the trapdoor, but it seems to be stuck. Or Curb has set
 his mangy behind down on it, which seems just about as likely.

 It sounds like Curb is gnawing on something above the trapdoor.

 (the old bolt)
 Actually, it's only part of an old bolt. It's rusty, stained, and the
 end is broken off, so it's only about an inch long.

 Hmm. Bolts needing changed, and this one's broken and rusty. Might be
 too much to hope for...

>examine door
 A crude wooden trapdoor bolted into the floor with rustic iron hinges.
 Now that you look closely, those bolts do look somewhat old and shabby.
 Certainly no match for, say, your panga.

>hit door
 You bruise your knuckles on the bolts. Maybe you should find something
 else to use.

 You hear the familiar sounds of Curb eating his own vomit.

>hit bolts with panga
 Armed with your newfound knowledge - and your trusty panga - you lay
 into the trapdoor's bolts. They shatter with a few sharp blows each.

 As you are attacking the last bolt, there's a dangerous creaking sound,
 and suddenly the trapdoor collapses, spilling dust, rust, and your
 ever-faithful friend, Curb, down onto your head. But at least the
 trapdoor is open again!

 Curb scampers after you.

>examine bar
 Son of Toil bars contain protein and suchlike for the man with work on
 his mind. You never had so much work on your mind that you could stand
 the taste. The packaging is attractively decorated with an image of
 some Bible feller in a generic act of honest labour.

>eat bar
 You feel a strong personal disinclination against such a venture. Say
 what you will. Maybe it's on account of your weak non-toiling
 constitution or some such.

 Curb has apparently grown bored with the offering. If you want it,
 you'll have to brave a great deal of slobber.

>take offering
 Not much you can do with these until you have some form of transport;

 It's covered in dog slobber and chew marks.

 Curb peers curiously at the panga.

>examine twinkie
 One of the foulest creations of the Former Age, but they contain
 calories of some kind and they never rot. You don't blame the looters
 for leaving it, though.

>examine tattoo
 Your right arm, left hand and the left side of your face are partially
 covered with blocky, rounded glyphs precisely specifying your age,
 blood type, status (social, economic, marital) and affiliations
 (birth-clan, adopted clan, moiety, college). None of which are going to
 impress anybody, except for the adopted-clan part, perhaps; Aunt
 Mabel's reputation extends across the known world. But even so, the
 conspicuous hollow circles on the backs of both hands mark you as

>go east
 You walk for a few sandy miles, out into the desert, and night begins
 to fall, slowly, like a dead parachutist. In the distance, the
 whispering wind takes on a howl - looks like a sandstorm is on its way.
 By the time you realize this, however, you've gone to far to go back to
 your car.

 And so, in the depths of nights, with the sandstorm building up its
 inhuman, demonic power around you, you find yourself on...

 The Saloon porch
 The building is in the state you've expected from a ghost town. Its
 upper floor is completely gone, but the front is still standing, and
 you can barely make out the words Kissing Bandit Saloon in sun-bleached
 red paint. One half of a swinging door leads north, inside.

 Curb scampers after you.

>go north
 You enter through the swing door, Curb on your heels.

 In the saloon
 This room is much smaller than what the movies tell you. A stairway
 leads up to a gallery, though most of the roof and the upper floor is
 missing. A few chairs and tables gather dust, accompanied by a lone
 piano in a corner.
 A counter is near the back wall.
 An impressive chandelier dangles from the remains of the ceiling.

 On the counter is an empty pewter mug.

 Behind the counter is a shelf lined with a row of casks.

 An empty lemon juice bottle lies abandoned by the counter.

>play piano
 You play some notes from "The Late Goodybe" by Poets of the Fall, but
 then realize that the piano is one of those automatons. It even
 features some screechy lyrics. You can make something about a guy
 called Tom, who was a slinger, but not slinging "a gun". Something
 about a more lyrical meaning. Thankfully, the record ends soon.

 Curb peers curiously at the Son of Toil bar and makes a famished whine.

>author
 Scene 4, "Ghosts", was written by Marius Mueller.

>take all
 shelf: That's fixed in place.
 empty glass bottle: Taken.
 empty pewter mug: Taken.

>examine mug
 It's empty.

>examine bottle
 It's a clear glass bottle with a jaunty picture of an anthropomorphized
 lemon on the label. However, it is bone dry inside.

 Curb savagely gnaws at his genitals with slurpy snarls of contentment.

>take mug, bottle
 empty pewter mug: You already have that.
 empty glass bottle: You already have that.

 Curb stares at the rum cask with paranoid fascination.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine cask
 Which do you mean, the beer cask, the wine cask, the moonshine cask,
 the rum cask, the sarsaparilla cask, or the lemonade cask?

>examine moonshine
 It has "XXXXX" stencilled on the front. Wow, five X's? That must be
 strong stuff!

 Curb peers curiously at the musket barrel.

>examine sarsaparilla
 You see nothing special about the sarsaparilla cask.

 Curb skitters about.

>examine wine
 It's labelled "House White". There doesn't seem to be a house red.
 Maybe the patrons of this saloon preferred delicate, subtle flavors.

>examine beer
 You see nothing special about the beer cask.

 Curb chases his tail, squealing frustration.

>examine lemonade
 You see nothing special about the lemonade cask.

>examine rum
 It has the words "RED RUM" scratched crudely into the wood. Funny, the
 R's are backward. Maybe it's cyrillic and it really says YAED YAUM.

 Curb sniffs at the rum cask like the horrible little pervert he is.

>fill mug with moonshine
 The pewter mug is now full of moonshine.

>drink shine
 You can't see any such thing.

>drink moonshine

 You slam it back. Ahh, refreshing.

 In the saloon
 This room is much smaller than what the movies tell you. A stairway

 piano in a corner.
 A counter is near the back wall.
 An impressive chandelier dangles from the remains of the ceiling.

 Curb detracts from the scenic value of the vicinity.

 Behind the counter is a shelf lined with a row of casks.

>examine chandelier
 An old, cobwebbed chandelier. Looks like some sort of map is stuck in
 the chandelier.

 Curb attempts to howl, but it devolves into a whimper.

>take map\

 You can't reach it up there.

 Curb scratches his ear.

>get map with barrel
 I only understood you as far as wanting to get the treasure map.

>throw barrel at map
 (the musket barrel at the treasure map)
 Futile.

 Curb writhes about on his back, kicking his hind legs.

>throw barrel at chandelier
 (the musket barrel at the chandelier)
 You can't quite throw that high.

 Curb peers curiously at the Son of Toil bar and makes a famished whine.

>stand on curb
 That's not something you can stand on.

 Curb skitters about.

>stand on curb's head and jump up and down vigorously.
 You can't see any such thing.

 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

 Curb peers curiously at the car keys.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 Curb writhes about on his back, kicking his hind legs.

>go up

 Stairs
 You've climbed half-way up the stairs. To go any further would be
 foolishly risking your life.

 An old piece of cloth sticks to the floorboards here.

 Curb scampers after you.

>take cloth
 Taken.

>examine cloth
 An old piece of blue cloth. Could be ripped out from a pair of jeans or
 something.

 Curb snaps at flies.

 Curb eyes the piece of cloth with more than curiosity, something akin
 to keen interest. He sniffs it expectantly.

>show cloth to curb
 Curb sniffs the shred of cloth. He then holds up his head, and just for
 a moment, you can see, even in this big, repulsive heap of fat meat and
 dirty fur, the wolf, scenting the deer.

>go curb
 That's not something you can enter.

 Curb goes down.

 Curb frantically digs a hole in a corner.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Curb tries to gnaw on the beer cask. You shoo him off before he does
 too much damage.

>examine hole
 A hole, not as artfully dug as what you did in the cellar, but what can
 you expect from Curb?
 In it you can see a skull.

 Curb peers curiously at the panga.

>take skull
 Taken.

 Curb tries to gnaw on the piano. You shoo him off before he does too
 much damage.

>examine it
 A human skull. It's wearing an eyepatch that's in surprisingly good
 condition.

 Curb peers curiously at the empty pewter mug.

>take eyepatch
 You slide the eyepatch off the skull.

 Curb scratches at the ground with his forepaws.

>look in skull
 You find nothing of interest.

 Curb peers curiously at the shred of cloth.

>shake it
 Violence is not the answer.

>put bolt in eyepatch
 The eyepatch won't keep anything in it for long. If you want to sling
 the old bolt at something, you should just sling the old bolt at it
 directly.

>sling bolt at map
 Taking good aim, and a few practice swings, you haul your missile at
 the treasure map- up and up it goes-
  Hit!
 The treasure map tumbles down. But so does a part of the chandelier,
 knocking you out. The last thing you hear is Curbs anxious growling.
 The last thing you feel, unfortunately, is Curbs wet tongue, licking
 your cheek. Then, thankfully, you pass out.

  *** You have knocked yourself out.***

  You wake up with a bad headache. Outside, the sun is shining again,
 the sandstorm is gone. Curb has rolled up at your side, and for all his
 faults, you love him for that.

 Curb sniffs at the chairs. like the horrible little pervert he is.

>examine map
 Well, it's obviously a treasure map, because it has a big X on it to
 mark the spot. But it's a pretty strange map: it's completely blank,
 and has a light iridescent sheen to it, like a photographic plate.
 Also, it's strangely warm to the touch.

 Curb fixes you with a look of abject guilt and keens softly.

>author
 Scene 5, "Invisiclues", was written by Carl Muckenhoupt.

>read treasure huntery
 "For one thing, the maps are often nearly as well-hidden as the
 treasures themselves. However, that doesn't mean you're left to search
 aimlessly. The purpose of the map is defeated if no one has access to
 it, so treasure maps can usually be found among the effects of the
 treasure-hiders, or in places they frequented. Look in residences,
 gathering-places, and vehicles."

 Curb peers curiously at Treasure Huntery Lesson 1.

>again
 "Once you've found your map, the next step is deciphering it. Treasure
 maps are usually encrypted or obfuscated in some way. Edgar Allan Poe's
 short story The Gold Bug tells about a map that has instructions
 written in code... and also in invisible ink!"

>again
 "Invisible ink is actually surprisingly common in authentic treasure
 maps -- and one of the main reasons that there are still treasure maps
 that have gone undetected. The most popular form of invisible ink is
 ordinary lemon juice, although any weak acid works just as well. When
 heat is applied to the paper, the parts weakened by the lemon juice
 discolor more quickly. There are recorded attempts at developing an ink
 that would work the other way around, but to our knowledge this has
 never been done successfully."

 Curb scratches his ear.

 the rum cask, the sarsaparilla cask, or the lemonade cask?

>fill mug with wine
 The pewter mug is now full of vinegar.

 Curb skitters about.

>pour vinegar on map
 (the pewter mug of vinegar on the treasure map)
 Little wisps of vinegar-scented smoke curl upward as an image appears
 on the map.

>examine map

 with a big black X in the middle.

 The rum is a brilliant red color, but it smells like rum all the same.

>look at map through bottle
 Aha! When you look through the red rum, you the pattern becomes clear.
 Instead of a map, all you see is the word "LUXOR".

 What the heck? The treasure is in Egypt?

 Well, there's nothing for it. If you're going to get that treasure,
 you'll have to get to Egypt. One plane flight later, some checking with
 the remainder of the map, and you find your way to a worn-down souk by
 the Necropolis.

 Shisha Souk
 You've followed your treasure map to this dingy little tobacco house on
 the eastern bank of the Nile. Sleepy old men gather around the hookahs
 and trade smoke. A cabinet full of curiosities lines the back wall.

 Curb detracts from the scenic value of the vicinity.

 Curb tries to gnaw on the tables. You shoo him off before he does too

 These are relics and gewgaws from all over the world. One in particular
 catches your eye - a softwood box with your family crest imprinted on
 it.

 Curb peers curiously at the alligator stetson.

 This fine sandalwood box must be some lost heirloom of your family
 line; it's got your crest on the lid.

 Curb peers curiously at the diary.

 It's the same symbol and motto that has been passed down through your
 family for generations: An extinguished lantern under the phrase SIC
 SEMPER RIMORIS.

 Curb savagely gnaws at his genitals with slurpy snarls of contentment.

 Taken.

 Curb peers curiously at the piece of paper.

 You open the heirloom box, revealing a decoder ring and a slip of
 paper.

 Curb peers curiously at the panga.

 This old slip of paper has the mysterious message DSAJX YPFC, XUJPER on
 it.

 Curb peers curiously at the Twinkie and makes a famished whine.

>examine ring
 This decoder ring has a wheel that matches letters to other letters.
 Surely, with this, the darkest secrets of the cosmos are yours.

 [To use the decoder ring, type the command DECODE (text), where (text)
 is the text you wish to decode.]

>wear ring
 (first taking the decoder ring)
 You put on the decoder ring.

 Curb stares at the tables with paranoid fascination.

>examine tables
 The tables here are stained with years of smoking.

 Curb snaps at flies.

>decode dsajx ypfc, xujper
 Using your mighty ancestral decoder ring, you decode DSAJX YPFC, XUJPER
 to WRONG CITY, GENIUS.

>decode luxor
 You ponder the map. "LUXOR" alone really isn't much of a clue to
 finding the treasure on its own. Perhaps if you put your ancestral
 decoder ring to work, it will produce a new clue. Let's see. "L" maps
 to "V", "U" to "E"...

 You feel a certain sinking feeling as you guess the rest. Yep. "LUXOR"
 decodes to "VEGAS". You've been searching on the wrong continent all
 this time. At least you did get that it was in a desert, though.

 Time to book another flight.

 Gambling Pit at the Luxor
 It's dry as a bone out there, but at least in here the drinks flow
 freely. The map, suitably reinterpreted to this locale, lead you to
 this slot machine, right on the X in LUXOR. All around you, blinking,
 screaming electronics want to take your money, but your steely resolve
 remains undeterred.

 Curb detracts from the scenic value of the vicinity.

 Curb skitters about.

>examine machine
 This slot machine looks much like the others here; video screens
 showing results, lots and lots of flashing lights and exciting sounds,
 and a slot with which you may insert all your money.

>play machine
 You stick a token in the machine and pull the lever. Lemon, Lemon,
 and... your family crest? This is no ordinary slot machine.

 It's no ordinary payout mechanism, either. A chute opens up beneath
 you, and you slide into darkness.

 Central Broadcasting
 This is more like it! The chute took you into this awesome command
 center. An important-looking door leads off to the north, while more
 unassuming ones lead in all other cardinal directions. Surely some hint
 to the treasure must be in this secret complex.

 Giving Lounge
 You are in a brightly-lit pillared underground chamber, with purple

 Vegas Heaven
 The underground Las Vegas version of Heaven is as big as a major city
 railway terminal and brilliantly lit, with a high vault ceiling painted
 sky blue. Vapory, cottoney off-white structures flit about the room,
 blown by a pleasant breeze from discreetly placed and deeply muffled
 fans. It's all spectacularly fake, of course, but with superb
 production values.

 You can see a set of pearly gates and a heart-shaped bed here.

 And, more to the point, there's someone on the bed.

 Curb scampers after you.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>Author
 Scene 8, "Heaven is Heart-Shaped Bed", was written by Jacqueline A
 Lott.

>examine someone
 The woman on the bed is nothing short of a goddess. And it's not just
 the tacky Vegas version of Heaven that's making you think that way.

>examine bed
 The, um, goddess is lying down on a heart-shaped bed. Maybe it's more
 of a couch. It doesn't seem to have any sheets or anything... it seems
 to be upholstered in white fur. Looks soft, though.

 The couch, I mean.

 Well, the goddess too.

 I mean, she's not fat or anything. Just soft. You know, her skin.

 Curb peers curiously at the empty pewter mug.

>goddess, hi
 There is no reply.

 Curb vomits from excitement, his ribcage convulsing. He laps up the
 result hurriedly, before you steal his prize.

>ask goddess about goddess
 She just smiles at you seductively.

 Curb scratches his ear.

 You advance toward her, but she shakes her head. "I don't think so,
 lover. I'm not quite that easy... I'm a goddess, after all."

 Curb scratches at the ground with his forepaws.

>kiss goddess
 You walk toward her, but she raises a hand to stop you. "Sorry, my
 darling. I'm not quite that easy... I'm a goddess, after all."

>pray
 You prostrate yourself before the goddess.

 She lowers her gaze. "Welcome to Heaven, you fiendish thing. Come here,
 lover."

 Curb chases his tail, squealing frustration.

>enter bed
 You walk toward her, and she welcomes you with open arms. She smiles as
 you climb up into the big, white, furry couch.

 Just one kiss, and the world seems to dissolve around you...

 Afterbliss
>kiss her
 Oh, now you've done it. Or at least, you presume that you've done it,

 The floor opens up beneath you, and you fall for an exceedingly great
 distance...

 Hell
 Cut off from everything good in the universe, your sensations are
 limited to pain, frustration, and ennui. You are immersed in an endless
 sea of fire, which certainly doesn't help matters.

 Curb detracts from the scenic value of the vicinity.

 You can also see a devil, a helicopter, and a red gear here.

>examine gear
 You see nothing special about the red gear.

 Goodness gracious me. What sort of thing just appeared in your hands?
 Some sort of box?
>examine devil

 The banality of evil is personified by this loathsome fellow, who
 doesn't project fear so much as an intense longing to be anywhere other
 than in his presence.

 The devil looks in your direction and says "Cerberus! Where have you
 been?"  He then seizes Curb by the neck and drags him away, continuing
 to abuse the animal for abandoning his duty. You are unable to care
 about this turn of events, but notice that the devil has lost his
 helmet during the struggle.

>take helmet, gear
 helmet: The imp on your left shoulder warns you: "Thou shalt not
 steal."  On your right shoulder, G. K. Chesterton replies: "Thieves
 respect property. They merely wish the property to become their
 property that they may more perfectly respect it."  You hadn't noticed
 either of these apparitions before this moment, but find yourself
 leaning in the direction of the latter. You pick up the horned helmet.

 You mumble a prayer from your childhood:

 God bless the moon and God bless me.

 It's a pretty selfish prayer, when you think about it. I mean, the moon

 else, do you?

 I swear... you belong in Vegas.

 You play a few notes of "Chobits ending theme 2". Contrary to IF
 convention, you actually play quite well.

>search guitar
 The guitar is empty.

>examine pattern
 The pattern, although still confusingly complex, gives you the vague
 impression of a house.

>think about house
 Unbearably hellish music overwhelms your thoughts. You struggle
 mightily to think about something else.

>touch house
 You can't see any such thing.

>touch pattern
 A snap of static jumps from the pattern to your fingers, and the world
 collapses around you!

 Basement
 This would be pitch-black if it weren't for your glow-jar and a bit of
 light coming in via the window. A rickety staircase leads upwards.

 You can see a cupboard (closed) here.

 The Nox Box seems to have vanished from your possessions.

>open cupboard
 You open the cupboard, revealing a yellow gear and a blue gear.

>take gears
 yellow gear: Taken.
 blue gear: Taken.

>examine window
 You can't see any such thing.

>go up
 With a blink and a flash, you're suddenly somewhere a bit more
 familiar...

 Gambling Pit at the Luxor
 You're here in front of a slot machine situated right on top of the X
 in the Luxor's logo. All around you, blinking, screaming electronics
 want to take your money, but your steely resolve remains undeterred. A
 dark passage in front of the slot machine leads down.

 Your possessions shift slightly. The Nox Box seems to have returned.

>get box
 (the Nox box)
 You already have that.

>open nox
 You open the Nox box, revealing a gear slot.

>put yellow gear in nox
 You put the yellow gear into the gear slot.

>put blue gear in nox
 You put the blue gear into the gear slot.

>close nox
 You close the Nox box.

>shake nox
 As the box shakes, you get a vague impression of a field.

>touch pattern
 A snap of static jumps from the pattern to your fingers, and the world
 collapses around you!

 Grassy Field
 A wide open field with a blue sky above. Far off in the distance,
 towards the setting sun, you can see a large, lone tree. Closer by,
 like nearly on top of you, is an enormous trebuchet.

 You can see an orange gear here.

 The Nox Box has vanished again.

>take orange gear
 Taken.

>examine tree
 Far off in the distance, you can just make out a tree poking up over
 the tall grass.

>examine trebuchet
 The enormity of this enormous trebuchet is enor... is staggering. The
 wheels themselves are easily forty feet in diameter, if not more. The
 top reaches too high to even estimate. The rope is thicker than a tree
 trunk. A really thick tree trunk. The sling is currently empty, and an
 amusingly small lever built into the side looks like it'll set it off.

 Far overhead, you hear the buzzing of a plane.

>examine plane
 You can definitely hear it, but you can't quite see it.

 The buzzing becomes louder.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The plane is almost directly overhead.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The plane continues on its way across the sky.

>examine rope
 The enormity of this enormous trebuchet is enor... is staggering. The
 wheels themselves are easily forty feet in diameter, if not more. The
 top reaches too high to even estimate. The rope is thicker than a tree
 trunk. A really thick tree trunk. The sling is currently empty, and an
 amusingly small lever built into the side looks like it'll set it off.

 The buzzing becomes very faint as the plane flies out of view.

>go north
 With a blink and a flash, you're suddenly somewhere a bit more
 familiar...

 Trading Post Porch
 A wide porch of wood slats, with the obligatory animal skulls nailed up
 against the wall. South leads back to the road; north takes you inside.

 Just outside the shadowed doorway, a parched corpse slumps in a
 rocking-chair.

 Your possessions shift slightly. The Nox Box seems to have returned.

>open nox
 You open the Nox box, revealing a gear slot.

>put orange gear in slot
 You put the orange gear into the gear slot.

>close box
 (the Nox box)
 You close the Nox box.

>shake nox
 As the box shakes, you get a vague impression of a tree.

>touch pattern
 A snap of static jumps from the pattern to your fingers, and the world
 collapses around you!

 Under a Tree
 A tree stands majestically in the middle of a great open field. The
 sun, just rising over the horizon, makes the tree's shadow stretch off
 over the grass into the distance. The field continues in all
 directions.

 The Nox Box has vanished again.

>examine tree
 You're not exactly sure what kind of tree this is as you're not a
 botanist. However, it is tall and sturdy and makes a nice amount of
 shade, and high up in the branches you can just make out a gear of some
 hue or other.

>climb tree
 With a blink and a flash, you're suddenly somewhere a bit more
 familiar...

 Stairs
 You've climbed half-way up the stairs. To go any further would be
 foolishly risking your life.

 Your possessions shift slightly. The Nox Box seems to have returned.

>examine nox
 The box is square, solid black, and inlaid with strands of silver that
 makes an unusual and almost hypnotic pattern on all six sides. It's
 just about the size of the old Christmas presents you used to shake as
 a kid to guess their contents.

 The Nox Box makes a noticable buzzing sound.

>examine pattern
 The pattern, although still confusingly complex, gives you the vague
 impression of a tree.

>shake nox
 As the box shakes, you get a vague impression of an enclosed space.

>touch nox
 You feel nothing unexpected.

>touch pattern
 A snap of static jumps from the pattern to your fingers, and the world
 collapses around you!

 Plane Cabin
 Hunched over in a cramped, lurching, noisy cabin makes your back hurt
 and endangers your hearing. Wires and cables are strung neatly nearly
 everywhere, and pipes prove useful when you need to grab onto
 something. A hatch in the ceiling leads to the deck above you, and a
 door is set into the hull of the plane.

 You can see a hull door, a hatch, and a giant silver sphere here.

 The Nox Box has vanished again.

>examine sphere
 Although the sphere appears to be silver, you can't be certain exactly
 what metal it's made of. The surface of it dances and swirls before
 your eyes, and when you lean close to it, your reflection distorts
 amusingly. At least, you assume your nose isn't that big.

>author
 Scene 10, "Endgame", was written by Mark J Musante.

>open hatch
 You open the hatch.

>go up
 With a blink and a flash, you're suddenly somewhere a bit more
 familiar...

 Central Broadcasting
 This is clearly some kind of command center. An important-looking door
 leads off to the north, while more unassuming ones lead in all other
 cardinal directions. Surely some hint to the treasure must be in this
 secret complex.

 You can see a ladder here.

 Your possessions shift slightly. The Nox Box seems to have returned.

>open hull door
 You open the hull door.

>examine wires
 You can't see any such thing.

>push sphere
 You roll the sphere out the door!

>go down
 You can't go that way.

>enter hull door
 You leap to your death. And your death takes a while to hit you, mostly
 because it comes in the form of the ground, which was far far below the
 plane.

 The Saloon porch
 The building is in the state you've expected from a ghost town. Its
 upper floor is completely gone, but the front is still standing, and
 you can barely make out the words Kissing Bandit Saloon in sun-bleached
 red paint. One half of a swinging door leads north, inside.

 Your possessions shift slightly. The Nox Box seems to have returned.

>wait

 The plane is almost directly overhead.
 A glint of light shines briefly below the plane. You squint but can't
 make it out.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The plane continues on its way across the sky.
 The glint of light becomes brighter, and a rushing, crackly, whooshing
 sound is coming from it.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The buzzing becomes very faint as the plane flies out of view.
 The glint of light rushes towards the ground at a fantastic rate. It
 thuds into the earth, throwing up rocks and dirt in an amazing display.
 Still more amazingly, it bounces up into the air and with a neat
 "plop", lands gently onto the trebuchet.

>pull lever
 Slowly at first, and then with increasing speed, the trebuchet pulls
 the loaded sling underneath and then the sling swings free. It flies
 far out into the distance and curves upwards in an arc that seems slow
 only because of the distance involved. At the top of the swing, almost
 up into the clouds, you see a flash of light as the sphere is thrown
 clear of the sling. It flies high into the air and you wait and wait as
 it comes down almost at the horizon. And right into the large lone tree
 in the distance. The tree shudders once and is still.

>go north
 With a blink and a flash, you're suddenly somewhere a bit more
 familiar...

 In the saloon
 This room is much smaller than what the movies tell you. A stairway
 leads up to a gallery, though most of the roof and the upper floor is
 missing. A few chairs and tables gather dust, accompanied by a lone
 piano in a corner.
 A counter is near the back wall.
 An impressive chandelier dangles from the remains of the ceiling.

 Curb has dug a hole into the ground here.

 Behind the counter is a shelf lined with a row of casks.

 Your possessions shift slightly. The Nox Box seems to have returned.

 You can see a giant silver sphere and an indigo gear here.

 The Nox Box has vanished again.

>take indigo
 Taken.

>examine sphere
 Although the sphere appears to be silver, you can't be certain exactly
 what metal it's made of. The surface of it dances and swirls before
 your eyes, and when you lean close to it, your reflection distorts
 amusingly. At least, you assume your nose isn't that big. Despite the
 fact that it took quite a journey since you saw it last, it appears
 completely unharmed, with not a scratch to be seen.

>examine tree
 You're not exactly sure what kind of tree this is as you're not a
 botanist. However, it is tall and sturdy and makes a nice amount of
 shade, although many of the branches are splintered and broken.

>go north
 With a blink and a flash, you're suddenly somewhere a bit more

 Gateway
 This end of the Giving Lounge is bathed in gentle light. A set of
 (literally) pearly gates stands to the west.

 You pause to reflect on this for a moment. The fact that the pearly
 gates are underground adds that extra touch of Vegas oddness to the
 scene.

 You can see a set of pearly gates and a guardian angel here.

 Beach
 A picturesque beach at sunset. Clich?, but extremely pleasant. The sun
 glints over the waters as the waves crash gently on the shore. The
 beach is secluded, with cliffs all around you. At last, you can relax.
 It seems like forever ago when you started in By Your Car and your odd
 and surreal journey began. But now it's over, and you've found a place
 to rest. All it needs is a bit of music to be complete.

 The Nox Box has vanished again.

>play guitar
>play guitar
 You sit down in a comfortable spot, expertly tune your guitar, and play
 music to match the peaceful beauty of your surroundings. Your fingers
 fly over the guitar strings with the effortless ease of one who has
 mastered the instrument, and you close your eyes, breathing a sigh of
 completion.

 Giving Lounge
 You are in a brightly-lit pillared underground chamber, with purple
 shag carpeting and a group of very generous people. A back office lies
 to the east, while the west end of the lounge gives off a gentle glow.

 Curb detracts from the scenic value of the vicinity.

 You can also see Bruce K, Corinne Q, and Sammy Z-E here.

 Corinne Q passes a brown square to Sammy Z-E. Sammy Z-E gifts a small
 wooden house to Corinne Q.

 You glow with enlightenment.

 Curb scampers after you.

 You glow with enlightenment.

>go west
 The angel opens the gates with a smile, and you pass beyond. Could the
 treasure you seek lie beyond?

 Vegas Heaven
 The underground Las Vegas version of Heaven is as big as a major city
 railway terminal and brilliantly lit, with a high vault ceiling painted
 sky blue. Vapory, cottoney off-white structures flit about the room,
 blown by a pleasant breeze from discreetly placed and deeply muffled
 fans. It's all spectacularly fake, of course, but with superb
 production values.

 You can see a set of pearly gates and a heart-shaped bed here.

 And, more to the point, there's someone on the bed.

 Curb scampers after you.

 [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

>blaspheme
 "What do you think you are?" you ask. "Some kind of hot and holy little
 sex muffin? I'll have you know that I possess strong moral fiber, and
 will not succumb to your feminine wiles!"

 Her eyes open wide and fill with rage. "Oh, you won't, will you?"

 You catch a brief glimpse of her cleavage. "Um..."  Must. Look. In.
 Her.  Eyes... "No. No, I won't!"

 "You're perfectly sure?"  She crawls toward you a little bit more.
 "Absolutely certain?"

 Gosh, I dunno. Are you sure?

>no

 You give it some thought. Real thought, this time, not just impulse...

 And you realize that maybe the Vegas lifestyle isn't so bad. Not
 really.

 Looks like it might be fun, actually, to climb up onto the fuzzy white
 bed and...

 ...and what? Gosh. You're not sure. You think about that, too...

 And you decide that you'll do pretty much whatever she wants you to do.
 "What the hell?" you say. "Why not?"  She smiles as you climb up into
 the big, white, furry couch and snuggle up beside her.

 Just one kiss, and the world seems to dissolve around you...

 Afterbliss
 Oh, now you've done it. Or at least, you presume that you've done it,
 since you don't really remember anything after that first kiss. You're
