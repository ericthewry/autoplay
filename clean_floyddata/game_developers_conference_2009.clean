 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You're actually here. The Gee Dee Cee. You don't know which session to
 check out first. Unlike your hometown, you're one promoter among many
 here -- exciting and intimidating.

 Exciting because between now and Friday you might be able to put
 together a game development team with the varied people here, but
 intimidating because you don't know a soul. Luckily people all have
 their names printed on their badges, that's one thing you don't have to
 worry about.

 Type CREDITS for the full credits, HELP if you need it, and QUIT to
 exit the game.

 Moscone Center South 2000
 Geez, there's a lot of people here. You wish your buddy Jon had come.
 He had a ton of advice about getting to know people. What was it that
 he said? You bet you could REMEMBER if you tried.

 You can go north to Moscone Center North 2000, east to art session
 "Lighting With Purpose" and west to the code session "AI Behaviors from
 Improvisational Actors".

>remember
 What was it that Jon said? You can learn a lot if you EXAMINE folks...
 that taking a personal INVENTORY helps you keep track of your skills
 and interests... and when in doubt, GO WEST?

 You dunno about that last one, especially since he went on to rant
 about twisty mazes, but you (perhaps aptly) couldn't follow what he was
 saying.

 But he did have some other helpful stuff to say too, you'd just need to
 focus to REMEMBER it.

>remember

 Over beers the day before you left, he got philosophical. Sure, there's
 a lot of swag, but it's not about what you can TAKE, he said. It's
 about the exchange of ideas. ASK people ABOUT something they care
 about. If you don't know, ASK them ABOUT INTERESTS. And if you have an
 interest, TALK ABOUT it TO them -- maybe your enthusiasm about it will
 catch. And he said not to worry about getting it right the first time,
 that it can take a couple of years to get into the groove.

 You're pretty sure there was some other stuff he said, too.

>remember

 Jon got a little drunk and started to brag that he was around when he
 saw someone PROPOSE GAME WITH VECTOR GRAPHICS TO DAVE. Then he started
 to grouse about the economy and how he wished he was going this year,
 and the evening went downhill from there. He pointed out that because
 you're an extreme extrovert, you'd have to be careful not to talk
 people's ears off.
  (Which seemed kind of personal to you, but Jon has a tact deficit.)

 Now that you're thinking of it, wasn't there something else he said?

>remember

 Right before you extricated yourself, Jon had one more piece of advice
 -- to make sure you checked out the dev team workshop when you thought
 you had a team together. The other workshops were useful too, in case
 you couldn't get a coder or an artist -- it's pretty random who you're
 gonna meet, he said. He started on about something else but you told
 him you had an early plane to catch.

>inventory
 You are dressed like a typical promoter. Your interests include viral
 marketing. Currently, your dev team consists of yourself as promoter.

 remarks from Raigan reveal that you don't really know what you're
 talking about.

 Before the conference ends you decide to see how your team stacks up...
 assessment workshop "Dev Team Judgement: R U Ready?"
 You can go south to Moscone Center North 3000.

 Your dev team is assessed as ready to go with a 70% chance of
 completing the project. Having put together a team this late in the
 conference means that you don't have a ton of time to hash stuff out.
 Luckily the members of your team like each other overall, which makes
 the project easier to manage. Despite the challenges of any game dev
 project, you have great hopes for the game's unique use of bot movement
 and pixel art.



     *** You have a decent chance of getting your game made ***

 Before the conference ends you decide to see how your team stacks up...
 assessment workshop "Dev Team Judgement: R U Ready?"
 You can go south to Moscone Center North 3000.

 Your dev team is assessed as ready to go with a 70% chance of
 completing the project. Having put together a team this late in the
 conference means that you don't have a ton of time to hash stuff out.
 Luckily the members of your team like each other overall, which makes
 the project easier to manage. Despite the challenges of any game dev
 project, you have great hopes for the game's unique use of ARGs and
 viral marketing.



     *** You have a decent chance of getting your game made ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
>restart








 You're actually here. The Gee Dee Cee. You don't know which session to
 check out first. Unlike your hometown, you're one promoter among many
 here -- exciting and intimidating.

 Exciting because between now and Friday you might be able to put
 together a game development team with the varied people here, but
 intimidating because you don't know a soul. Luckily people all have
 their names printed on their badges, that's one thing you don't have to
 worry about.

 Game Developers Conference 2009
 A social interaction simulator by Jim Munroe.
 Release 1 / Serial number 090504 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)
 Type CREDITS for the full credits, HELP if you need it, and QUIT to
 exit the game.

 Moscone Center South 2000
 Geez, there's a lot of people here. You wish your buddy Jon had come.
 He had a ton of advice about getting to know people. What was it that
 he said? You bet you could REMEMBER if you tried.

 You can go north to Moscone Center North 2000, east to art session
 "Lighting With Purpose" and west to the code session "AI Behaviors from
 Improvisational Actors".

>help
 You know, your pal Jon had a bunch of interesting tips that you could
 REMEMBER if you tried.

>remember
 What was it that Jon said? You can learn a lot if you EXAMINE folks...
 that taking a personal INVENTORY helps you keep track of your skills
 and interests... and when in doubt, GO WEST?

 You dunno about that last one, especially since he went on to rant
 about twisty mazes, but you (perhaps aptly) couldn't follow what he was
 saying.

 But he did have some other helpful stuff to say too, you'd just need to
 focus to REMEMBER it.

>remember

 Over beers the day before you left, he got philosophical. Sure, there's
 a lot of swag, but it's not about what you can TAKE, he said. It's
 about the exchange of ideas. ASK people ABOUT something they care
 about. If you don't know, ASK them ABOUT INTERESTS. And if you have an
 interest, TALK ABOUT it TO them -- maybe your enthusiasm about it will
 catch. And he said not to worry about getting it right the first time,
 that it can take a couple of years to get into the groove.

 You're pretty sure there was some other stuff he said, too.

>remember

 Jon got a little drunk and started to brag that he was around when he
 saw someone PROPOSE GAME WITH VECTOR GRAPHICS TO DAVE. Then he started
 to grouse about the economy and how he wished he was going this year,
 and the evening went downhill from there. He pointed out that because
 you're an extrovert, you'd have to be careful not to talk people's ears
 off.
  (Which seemed kind of personal to you, but Jon has a tact deficit.)

 Now that you're thinking of it, wasn't there something else he said?

>remember

 Right before you extricated yourself, Jon had one more piece of advice
 -- to make sure you checked out the dev team workshop when you thought
 you had a team together. The other workshops were useful too, in case
 you couldn't get a coder or an artist -- it's pretty random who you're
 gonna meet, he said. He started on about something else but you told
 him you had an early plane to catch.

 Luckily the members of your team like each other overall, which makes
 the project easier to manage. Despite the challenges of any game dev
 project, you have great hopes for the game's unique use of ARGs and
 pixel art.

 You're actually here. The Gee Dee Cee. You don't know which session to
 check out first. Unlike your hometown, you're one coder among many here
 -- exciting and intimidating.

 Exciting because between now and Friday you might be able to put
 together a game development team with the varied people here, but
 intimidating because you don't know a soul. Luckily people all have
 their names printed on their badges, that's one thing you don't have to
 worry about.

 You can go down to Moscone Center North 2000, east to art workshop
 "Artsy Assets -- Open Source Not Outsource", west to tool workshop
 "Prototyping with Gamemaker" and north to assessment workshop "Dev Team
 Judgement: R U Ready?".

 You feel uncomfortable around Kevin.
 Mare has got an amazing way of stringing together buzzwords like ARGs,
 and it's hard to tell if Kevin is buying it or not.
 Shooting you a dirty look, Susan heads to art workshop "Artsy Assets --
 Open Source Not Outsource".
 Raigan asks you what you're interested in these days. You say that
 you're pretty interested in point-and-click game making tools, Creative
 Commons licensed art, procedural gameplay, viral marketing and pixel
 art.

>go east

 art workshop "Artsy Assets -- Open Source Not Outsource"
 You can go west to Moscone Center North 3000.

 You arrived early enough to get something out of it. You come out of
 the day-long workshop on Creative Commons licensed art really feeling
 like you could manage without an artist.

 You feel uncomfortable around Kevin.
 Mare is like a firehose of chat about pixel art, and Kevin's enthusiasm
 was put out long ago.

 Susan wanders out of the session with a hopelessly befuddled look on
 her face.
 Shooting Mare a dirty look, Raigan heads to art workshop "Artsy Assets
 -- Open Source Not Outsource".
 Raigan gives you a friendly wave.

 Before the conference ends you decide to see how your team stacks up...
 assessment workshop "Dev Team Judgement: R U Ready?"
 You can go south to Moscone Center North 3000.

 Your dev team is assessed as ready to go with a 65% chance of
 completing the project. Having put together a team this late in the
 conference means that you don't have a ton of time to hash stuff out.
 Luckily the members of your team like each other overall, which makes
 the project easier to manage. There's also the challenge of having so
 many interests that the game might lose focus. Despite the challenges
 of any game dev project, you have great hopes for the game's unique use
 of Creative Commons licensed art, viral marketing and pixel art.



     *** You have a decent chance of getting your game made ***

 You're actually here. The Gee Dee Cee. You don't know which session to
 check out first. Unlike your hometown, you're one designer among many
 here -- exciting and intimidating.

 Exciting because between now and Friday you might be able to put
 together a game development team with the varied people here, but
 intimidating because you don't know a soul. Luckily people all have
 their names printed on their badges, that's one thing you don't have to
 worry about.

 Game Developers Conference 2009
 A social interaction simulator by Jim Munroe.
 Release 1 / Serial number 090504 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)
 Type CREDITS for the full credits, HELP if you need it, and QUIT to
 exit the game.

 Moscone Center South 2000
 Geez, there's a lot of people here. You wish your buddy Jon had come.
 He had a ton of advice about getting to know people. What was it that
 he said? You bet you could REMEMBER if you tried.

 You can go north to Moscone Center North 2000, east to art session
 "Lighting With Purpose" and west to the code session "AI Behaviors from
 Improvisational Actors".

 Jim Munroe was commissioned to make this for GameSetWatch.com in April
 2009, and blogged about it there during the design process.

 Thanks to the Inform 7 creators and Wei-Ju Wu for ZMPP. Alpha testing
 by Mare Sheppard and Kevin Jackson-Mead. Beta testing by Raigan Burns,
 Susan Bustos, Simon Carless, Ryan Couldrey, Jeffrey Joy, Katherine
 Parrish, and Jordan Reiter.

 The attendees in this game are named after them, but as each play
 session randomly assigns sociability levels, skillsets and interests,
 they rarely reflect their character. The names of the sessions are
 adapted from GDC 2009, except for one. The workshops are fictional.

 You are dressed like a typical designer. Your interests include ARGs.
 Currently, your dev team consists of yourself as designer.

 You'll need to upgrade your video card if you really want to see magic
 happen.

 What was it that Jon said? You can learn a lot if you EXAMINE folks...
 that taking a personal INVENTORY helps you keep track of your skills
 and interests... and when in doubt, GO WEST?

 You dunno about that last one, especially since he went on to rant
 about twisty mazes, but you (perhaps aptly) couldn't follow what he was
 saying.

 But he did have some other helpful stuff to say too, you'd just need to
 focus to REMEMBER it.


 Over beers the day before you left, he got philosophical. Sure, there's
 a lot of swag, but it's not about what you can TAKE, he said. It's
 about the exchange of ideas. ASK people ABOUT something they care
 about. If you don't know, ASK them ABOUT INTERESTS. And if you have an
 interest, TALK ABOUT it TO them -- maybe your enthusiasm about it will
 catch. And he said not to worry about getting it right the first time,
 that it can take a couple of years to get into the groove.

 You're pretty sure there was some other stuff he said, too.


 Jon got a little drunk and started to brag that he was around when he
 saw someone PROPOSE GAME WITH VECTOR GRAPHICS TO DAVE. Then he started
 to grouse about the economy and how he wished he was going this year,
 and the evening went downhill from there. He pointed out that because
 you're an extrovert, you'd have to be careful not to talk people's ears
 off.
  (Which seemed kind of personal to you, but Jon has a tact deficit.)

 Now that you're thinking of it, wasn't there something else he said?


 Right before you extricated yourself, Jon had one more piece of advice
 -- to make sure you checked out the dev team workshop when you thought
 you had a team together. The other workshops were useful too, in case
 you couldn't get a coder or an artist -- it's pretty random who you're
 gonna meet, he said. He started on about something else but you told
 him you had an early plane to catch.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>upgrade video card
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>remember
 You're pretty sure you remembered every relevant moment of that night
 already, and a few irrelevant ones too. But if you want to relive it
 again, REMEMBER away.

>get me
 There's nothing tangible to be gained in this game. This is a world of
 ideas, bub.

 Raigan talks to you about chiptune music, which he obviously knows
 nothing about.
 Wei-Ju talks to Jordan about point-and-click game making tools, which
 he obviously knows nothing about.
 Jeffrey floats away to code session "AI Behaviors from Improvisational
 Actors".

>propose game using chiptune music with me
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>propose game with chiptune music with me
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>propose game with chiptune music to me
 Seeing as you don't have much excitement for it yourself, your proposal
 sounds hollow to you.

 Raigan asks you what you're interested in these days. You say that
 you're pretty interested in ARGs.

 Wei-Ju asks Jordan what he's interested in these days. Not really sure
 what to say, Jordan makes a joke about being into post-hipsterism.

 Jeffrey walks out of a session, looking excited and inspired and
 chatting to someone about bot movement.

 the designer greats.
