 Reception Chamber
 The glitterings of Gold, Jewels, Tapestries, &c. belie the Corruption
 of he who 'til recently occupied this high Seat. A white Carpet, once
 flanked by Sycophants & Counsellors, now lies untravelled. It leads
 away from the Seat & towards the Sunrise.

 The cruel Baron lies at your feet, dyeing the carpet scarlet with his
 blood.

>examine baron
 His eyes are wide & unseeing. He wears only his velvet Robe of state,
 his face bearing a resigned Expression.

 You hear a terrible crashing sound to the east.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a sacred blade
   a holy symbol (glowing with a sacred light & being worn)
   a suit of Chain-Mail (being worn)
   a leather sheath (being worn)
   a wooden Scroll-Case (being worn & closed)

>open case
 You open the wooden Scroll-Case, revealing a vellum Scroll.

>read scroll
 The Scroll is made of rich vellum & is rolled up, inside the
 Scroll-Case.

>get scroll then read it
 You remove the Scroll from its Case.
 The rich vellum is covered with a flowing hand.

 &lt;&lt;The bearer of this Notice, one Knight Itinerant, being granted
 special Dispensation & ordered by Divine Covenant to separate from
 this World the immortal Soul of par Tiller, Baron of Stesan, his
 Crimes and Sins having blotted his Name beyond hope of Redemption or
 Reform, & it being ordered that any & all requested Assistance be
 rendered this Knight in this sacred Quest, let it be known that to
 this I set my Stamp & Seal on this day & for Perpetuity, in the name

 The stamp & signature is that of the Bishop of Dol Nesta.

>examine me
 You are a strapping Knight, secure in your faith & glowing with the
 chaste Excitement of a task accomplished.

>put blade in sheath
 You sheathe your Blade.

>go east

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, its walls covered in pagan Frescoes
 which beckon you to impure thoughts. Chairs arranged near the circular
 perimeter mingle with Tables for gaming. The chamber becomes the
 Reception Chamber to the west, the Dining Hall to the north. A small
 tiled archway leads southwest & to the east is the grand Entry Hall.

> x fresco
 You can see no such thing.

>examine fresco
 You can see no such thing.

>examine frescoes
 You shield your Eyes from the lewd & ribald Frescoes. Under the guise
 of Art they depict pagan & unrighteous Scenes--that is all that shall
 be said of them.

>go east

 Entrance Hall
 In this grand Hall do Heraldry & great Pomp greet the visitor to this
 Keep. Yet a visitor, betrayed, can quickly become a prisoner--a metal
 Portcullis to the east now separates you from the threshold. You must
 take your leave instead to the round Chamber that lies westward, or
 else attend one of the two archways to the north & south.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

>turn wheel
 A strange tingling comes over you as you reach for the Wheel. When you
 withdraw, your Arm is numbed. You try again, and feel sensation give
 way to Pain, mild and then unbearable. It seems you cannot turn the
 Wheel.

>examine wheel
 A heavy wooden wheel, which raises and lowers the Portcullis.

>examine pomp
 You can see no such thing.

>go north

 Armoury
 An Armoury, stocked by the Baron for a siege but unable to protect him
 from the vengeance of the Almighty. Amidst the Armour, Weaponry &c.
 stands an archway to the south.

 A wooden Lance stands here, propped against a wall.

>examine lance
 Intended not for warfare but for the Baron's extravagant games, the
 wooden Lance sits unused against a wall of the Armoury. It is of
 nearly constant width along its length, giving it the look of a common
 pole.

>get it
 To hold that you must have both hands free.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a vellum Scroll
   a holy symbol (glowing with a sacred light & being worn)
   a suit of Chain-Mail (being worn)
   a leather sheath (being worn)
     a sacred blade
   a wooden Scroll-Case (being worn & open but empty)

>sheath blade
 It is already sheathed.

>put scroll in scroll-case
 You roll up the Scroll and slide it into the Case.

>close case
 You close the wooden Scroll-Case.

>get lance
 Taken.

>go south

 Entrance Hall

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

>turn wheel with lance
 I only understood you as far as wanting to turn the large Wheel.

>vault
 I do not recognise that verb.

>jump over wall with pole
 You can see no such thing.

>examine portcullis
 A heavy iron portcullis blocks your way. No doubt its sudden closing
 was the cause of the crashing sound you heard earlier. Sun shines
 through the grate.

>lift portcullis
 Your strength is as great as your faith, but try as you might, you
 cannot lift the heavy portcullis. Perhaps the nearby Wheel holds the
 answer.

>lift portcullis with lance
 I only understood you as far as wanting to lift the heavy portcullis.

>go south

 Study
 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order in which he kept
 his Study! Had he lined his heart with good Works the way he lined his
 walls with Books, kept his spiritual affairs as tidy as he kept his
 Writing-Desk, then your grim task need never have been assigned you.
 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again
 occupy it. A solid oak door blocks your way to the west & an archway
 leads north.

 The orderly appointment of the Books on their several Shelves is
 marred in one place by a Gap.

>examine desk
 The Writing-Desk is of dark wood. Its flap is closed.

>open flap
 You open the flap of the Writing-Desk, revealing a small but deep Hole
 in the south wall.

>look in hole
 You find nothing of interest.

>reach in hole
 I do not recognise that verb.

>go south
 Methinks you see exits where there are none.

>put pole in hole
 Inserting the lance into the hole as far as you can, you feel the wood
 catch & hear the faraway grinding of stone. Removing the lance, you
 find it unchanged.

>go north

 Entrance Hall

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

>examine portcullis
 A heavy iron portcullis blocks your way. Sun shines through the grate.

>go south

 Study

 The orderly appointment of the Books on their several Shelves is
 marred in one place by a Gap.

 It seems to be locked.

>joust door
 I do not recognise that verb.

>go north

 Entrance Hall

>turn wheel
 A strange tingling comes over you as you reach for the Wheel. When you

 Wheel.

 tiled archway leads southwest & to the east is the grand Entry Hall.

>go southwest

 Chapel
 O foul Hypocrite! O whited Sepulchure! In the midst of his debauchery
 the Baron does see fit to erect himself a Chapel of the faith! Mayhap
 he thought to take sanctuary here at your approach. 'Tis more likely
 the lighted Candles & marble Altar did bear witness to blasphemous &
 terrible Rites in the Baron's lifetime.

 A stair in the corner leads down into darkness, an archway northeast.
 A solid oaken Door prevents your going east.

>examine altar

 The Altar is smooth & sweet-smelling, but you see it stained with
 Blood.

>examine door
 The door is made of fine oak, with a copper lock. It stands
 forebodingly closed.

 The Candles are old & sit guiltily in pools of their own Wax,
 flickering under your gaze.

>go down

 Priest's Quarters
 In contrast to the Baron's opulence lurks here the spartan Cell of his
 corrupt Priest. The only furnishing is a straw Mat, the only
 concession to luxury a Tapestry which hangs near the upward-climbing
 Stair.

 The Priest sits on his mat, eyes downturned in submission.


>ODYSSEUS
 I do not recognise that verb.

>examine priest
 You can sense the fear in his eyes, though your code prevents you from
 harming him. Fear of the Justice you represent, of the Judgement that
 will be passed upon him for the evils he did not act to prevent.

 he thinks this will earn him Clemency?

>examine tapestry
 The Tapestry depicts an allegorical Scene from the Scriptures of the
 true Faith.

>go north

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favored Thinkers entered
 this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic
 repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare,
 stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the larger
 items remain--the long Table & the ornate Chairs.

 On the long Table is a Perpetuum Mobile (which acts as a Water-Fall).

>examine mobile
 This Device you have seen before, in the Library at Dol Nesta. An
 ingenious Perpetuum Mobile, built of Pipes, Gears, & Screws of
 Archimides. Whereby the Force exhibited by Water as it pours into a
 wide Funnel drives the Drawing of that water upward, to fall again
 through a Spout into the Funnel--on & on, ad infinitum. The Design is
 that of a certain Portuguese & the Baron seems to have been impressed
 with it so as to have it realized as a Fountain.

 Now Water pours through the Perpetuum, falling out of the Spout & into
 the Funnel. The Splashings of the water combine harmoniously with the
 Grindings of the Gears & Screws. Tho it seems very heavy, you could
 probably carry the Perpetuum, if you were careful not to spill its
 Water.

>go west

 Kitchen
 Gluttonous indeed were the the Feasts prepared in this Kitchen while
 the Baron still lived. The huge Ovens now stand cold & unlit, the
 Crockery smashed & strewn about the floor. The Dining Hall is to the
 east, & northwards is a small enclosed Yard. A stair leads downward
 into Darkness.

 The Baron's Fool lies besotted beneath a large Wine-Barrel.

>SAVE

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine fool
 The Baron's Fool has taken to the cups. His Master no longer requires
 his gambols & rapier Wit. He sprawls beneath a large Wine-Barrel,
 clutching a Tankard from which he sips. His lincoln Cap is askew. He
 has not suffered the pangs of Sobriety for some time.

>pity fool
 I do not recognise that verb.

>examine cap
 The Fool's Cap is lincoln Green,  adorned with Bells. It is stained
 with the Drippings of wine from the Barrel.

>examine ovens
 The ovens stand cold as stone.

 Slaughter Yard
 In this small, walled Yard were Beasts put to the knife & prepared for
 the master's feasting table. Unthinkably--but undoubtably--were other
 Prey too destroyed here, to feed the Baron's appetite for sin. There
 is no hiding place in this small Arena; meat, alive or dead, can
 escape only south, through the Kitchen.

 A bloated Pig lies here, its Stomach slit.

 The stump of an ancient Oak stands here. The steel blade of an Axe
 calls it home.

>examine crockery
 You can see no such thing.

>examine pig
 The Pig is dead two days. Its Butcher likely fled the castle, dreading
 your approach. A large Slit travels its bloated Stomach.

 Store Room
 The gloomy Store Room has been recently sacked, though racks of Ham &
 strings of dried Fruit still hang above your head. A bag of Flour has
 been ripped open, its contents scattered. Hundreds of white
 Foot-Prints run frantic around the room & up the Stairs.

 A dented Box lies in a corner, seemingly kicked there by a thwarted
 Robber.

>examine box
 Battered, dented, the stoic and iron Resistor of an attack on its
 contents. A small Lock secures it.

>get box
 Your hands are full.

 O foul Hypocrite! O whited Sepulchure! In the midst of his debauchery
 the Baron does see fit to erect himself a Chapel of the faith! Mayhap

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, walls covered with pagan frescoes which

 In this grand Hall do heraldry & great pomp greet the visitor to this

 lies westward, or else attend one of the two archways to the north &

 Study
 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order he kept his

 occupy it. A solid oak door blocks your way to the west & an archway
 leads north.

 The Baron's library is full of heretical Ideas & Assertions most
 blasphemous. Yet here are also books of Metallurgy, of Alchymy and
 other useful Arts. A monk from Dol Nesta will need to be sent here to
 separate Wheat from Chaff, to save that which might be usefully
 Consulted and to destroy the Dross.

 The glitterings of Gold, Jewels, Tapestries, &c. belie the Corruption

 I'm Leonard Richardson, author of "Guess The Verb!". I'll be your tour
 guide through hell! Or that portion of hell which is "Degeneracy", my
 second IF game.

 I got the idea for the game in late November of 2000, and worked on it
 into the new year. Don't let the pseudo-archaic writing throw you; in
 gameplay terms, this is an utterly conventional exercise in timed
 puzzle solving.

 There's a specific subset of people who liked "Guess The Verb!" who
 will also like this game, but for the most part I think the two games
 appeal to disjoint audiences. Whatever the case, I hope you find
 "Degeneracy" novel and interesting.

 Note: as with all my games, I recommend you play Degeneracy with
 VERBOSE descriptions on. However, after having been lectured during
 the beta test of "Guess The Verb!" about messing with the VERBOSE
 default, I have decided to leave this decision in the hands of you,
 the player.

>search bag of flour
 I only understood you as far as wanting to search the sack of Flour.

>search sack
 There is nothing there but the Flour.

>take sack
 You would scatter Flour everywhere you walked.

>examine ham
 Racks of Ham hang from the Ceiling.

>examine fruit
 Strings of Fruit both familiar & exotic hang from the Ceiling.

>score
 You have completed your divine Task.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a dented Box (which is closed & locked)
   a sacred blade
   a holy symbol (glowing with a sacred light & being worn)
   a suit of Chain-Mail (being worn)
   a leather sheath (being worn)
   a wooden Scroll-Case (being worn & closed)

>examine symbol
 (the holy symbol)
 A perfect Circle, symbolizing the creation: Heaven above, Earth here &
 now, the pits below. The unbroken continuity of God, of which Man
 partakes. The symbol hangs by a light Chain from your neck.

>take all
 Stair-Way: The Stair-Way is hardly portable.
 racks of Ham: It is unclean.
 strings of Fruit: You hunger not.
 sack of Flour: You would scatter Flour everywhere you walked.
 Foot-Prints in the Flour: The Foot-Prints are not portable.

 The Baron's Fool has taken to the cups. His Master no longer requires

 Slaughter Yard
 In this small, walled Yard were Beasts put to the knife & prepared for
 the master's feasting table. Unthinkably--but undoubtedly--were other
 Prey too destroyed here, to feed the Baron's appetite for sin. There
 is no hiding place in this small Arena; meat, alive or dead, can
 escape only south, through the Kitchen.

 A bloated Pig lies here, its Stomach slit.

 The stump of an ancient Oak stands here. The steel blade of an Axe
 calls it home.
 Your hands are full.

 Priest's Quarters
 In contrast to the Baron's opulence lurks here the spartan Cell of his
 corrupt Priest. The only furnishing is a straw Mat, the only
 concession to luxury a Tapestry which hangs near the upward-climbing
 Stair.

 The Priest sits on his mat, eyes downturned in submission.

 A richly attired Wait Chamber, its walls covered in pagan Frescoes

 this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic
 repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare,
 stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the larger
 items remain--the long Table & the ornate Chairs.

 On the long Table is a Perpetuum Mobile (which acts as a Water-Fall).

>examine mobile
 This Device you have seen before, in the Library at Dol Nesta. An
 ingenious Perpetuum Mobile, built of Pipes, Gears, & Screws of
 Archimedes. Whereby the Force exhibited by Water as it pours into a
 wide Funnel drives the Drawing of that water upward, to fall again
 through a Spout into the Funnel--on & on, ad infinitum. The Design is
 that of a certain Portuguese & the Baron seems to have been impressed
 with it so as to have it realized as a Fountain.

 Now Water pours through the Perpetuum, falling out of the Spout & into
 the Funnel. The Splashings of the water combine harmoniously with the
 Grindings of the Gears & Screws. Tho' it seems very heavy, you could
 probably carry the Perpetuum, were you careful not to spill its Water.

 the Baron still lived. The huge Ovens now stand cold & unlit, the
 Crockery smashed & strewn about the floor. The Dining Hall is to the
 east, & northwards is a small enclosed Yard. A stair leads downward
 into Darkness.

 The Baron's Fool lies besotted beneath a large Wine-Barrel.

>go east

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favored Thinkers entered
 this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic
 repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare,
 stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the larger
 items remain--the long Table & the ornate Chairs.

 You can see a fine Axe & a dented Box (in which are a silver key & a
 handful of spice) here.

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, walls covered with pagan frescoes which
 beckon you to impure thoughts. Chairs arranged near the circular
 perimeter mingle with tables for gaming. The chamber becomes the
 reception chamber to the west, the dining hall to the north. A small
 tiled archway leads southwest, & to the east is the grand Entry Hall.

>go east

 Entrance Hall
 In this grand Hall do heraldry & great pomp greet the visitor to this
 castle. Yet a visitor, betrayed, can quickly become a prisoner--a
 metal portcullis to the east now separates you from the castle
 threshold. You must take your leave instead to the round Chamber that
 lies westward, or else attend one of the two archways to the north &
 south.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

>turn wheel
 A strange tingling comes over you as you reach for the Wheel. When you
 withdraw, your Arm is numbed. You try again, and feel sensation give
 way to Pain, mild and then unbearable. It seems you cannot turn the
 Wheel.

>turn wheel with mobile
 I only understood you as far as wanting to turn the large Wheel.

>put mobile on wheel
 Putting things upon the large Wheel would achieve nothing.

>attach mobile to wheel
 You would achieve nothing by this.

>examine gears
 Gears of many shapes & sizes turn endlessly in the Machine, imitating
 the model of Creation itself.

>examine screws
 The Archimedian Screws turn silently, meshing one into another to
 carry a cargo endlessly upwards.

>examine armor
 The sanctified chain mail is light on your body, and leaves your Arms
 and Elbows free. A white cloth covering bears a blue Circle, the
 symbol of the faith.

>remove cloth
 (first taking the white Covering over your armour)
 To remove your Covering outside the Church is to invite divine
 Disapproval.

>remove holy symbol
 To remove the symbol of the faith is to lose divine protection.

>examine wheel
 A heavy wooden wheel, which raises and lowers the Portcullis.

>attach mobile to wheel

 Chapel
 O foul Hypocrite! O whited Sepulchure! In the midst of his debauchery
 the Baron does see fit to erect himself a Chapel of the faith! Mayhap
 he thought to take sanctuary here at your approach. 'Tis more likely
 the lighted Candles & marble Altar did bear witness to blasphemous &
 terrible Rites in the Baron's lifetime.

 A stair in the corner leads down into darkness, an archway northeast.
 A solid oak door prevents your going east.

>go down

 Priest's Quarters
 In contrast to the Baron's opulence lurks here the spartan Cell of his
 corrupt Priest. The only furnishing is a straw Mat, the only
 concession to Luxury a tapestry which hangs near the upward-climbing
 stair.

 The Priest sits on his mat, eyes downturned in submission.

 'Tis odd... you cannot but think this Place has changed since last you
 did look upon it. Nay, it cannot be.

 The cruel Baron lies at your feet, dyeing the carpet scarlet with his
 blood.

 This Device you have seen before, in the Library at Dol Nesta. An

 Archimides. Whereby the Force exhibited by Water as it pours into a
 wide Funnel drives the Drawing of that water upward, to fall again
 through a Spout into the Funnel--on & on, ad infinitum. The Design is
 that of a certain Portuguese & the workmanship is such that the
 Machine continues its toil even in the absence of Water to propel it.

 Tho the Perpetuum is empty, still turn its Gears & Screws.

 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again

 The orderly appointment of the Books on their several Shelves is
 marred in one place by a Gap.

 Study
 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order he kept his
 study! Had he lined his heart with good works the way he lined his
 walls with books, kept his spiritual affairs as tidy as he kept his
 Writing-Desk, then your grim task need never have been assigned you.
 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again
 occupy it. A solid oak door blocks your way to the west & an archway
 leads north.

 Have these Walls shifted? Is the Light different in its attentions
 upon your Eyes? Nay, for how could this be so? It must be your
 tiresome Confinement that makes your Memory falter. You had best find
 a way to quit the Baron's Keep.

 Has this Place changed since last you were here? The work of some
 mischevious Spirit, or deceiving Daemon? It is but a slight tugging in
 your Marrow, yet a worrisome one.

 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order he kept his

 Reception Chamber
 The glitterings of Gold, Jewels, Tapestries, &c. belie the Corruption
 of he who 'til recently occupied this high Seat. A white Carpet, once
 flanked by Sycophants & Counsellors, now lies untravelled. It leads
 away from the Seat & towards the Sunrise.

 The cruel Baron lies at your feet, dyeing the carpet scarlet with his

 In the library you find no biographical information on that great
 Scoundrel, par Tiller, Baron of Stesan.

>consult books about mobile
 You find a reference to the Perpetuum Mobile (oddly enough) in a
 Discourse on religious Symbolism. Tho your brothers at the Monastery
 would follow the Arguments better than you can, the Ideas seem
 orthodox & you can make out most of what is said.

>consult books about fool
 The Perpetuum must exist, even if only in the mind of God (so says the
 Author, for the Work is a century old & so precedes the working
 Perpetuum) for it realizes the sacred Circle on a cosmic scale.
 Without the Perpetuum, the Cosmos is a strait Line, slowly declining
 in vital Force, sinking into Degeneracy & Oblivion. As God is the
 moral restorative of this vital Force, so is the Perpetuum, which does
 Work without losing Energy, its physical Restorative. When the vital
 Force moves back & forth between the Poles of Entropy & Restoration,
 is the Cosmos realized as a grand Circle.

 In a satirical work on the Hangers-On at court, you find the
 following:

 upon some Lie/Therein only one, the Fule/may speak true of lordly
 Misrule. He knows none his Words will heed/nor one comprehend his

 There is more of this poor Doggerel, but it merely repeats this Theme.

>consult books about circle
 The Circle makes itself the Symbol of this great Faith, symbolizing
 all that was and all that will be. Sadly, most of the references you
 find in the Baron's Library pervert this great Truth by demonstrating
 methods of subverting and desecrating the true Cycles of God and
 Nature, life and death.

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favored Thinkers entered
 this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic
 repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare,
 stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the larger
 items remain--the long Table & the ornate Chairs.

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, walls covered with pagan frescoes which

 You can see a dented Box (in which are a golden key, a silver key & a
 handful of spice) here.

 Entrance Hall
 In this grand Hall do heraldry & great pomp greet the visitor to this
 castle. Yet a visitor, betrayed, can quickly become a prisoner--a
 metal portcullis to the east now separates you from the castle
 threshold. You must take your leave instead to the round Chamber that
 lies westward, or else attend one of the two archways to the north &
 south.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

 Study
 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order he kept his
 study! Had he lined his heart with good works the way he lined his
 walls with books, kept his spiritual affairs as tidy as he kept his
 Writing-Desk, then your grim task need never have been assigned you.
 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again
 occupy it. A solid oak door blocks your way to the west & an archway
 leads north.

 The orderly appointment of the Books on their several Shelves is
 marred in one place by a Gap.
 The Gap is book-shaped.

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, walls covered with pagan frescoes which
 beckon you to unpure thoughts. Chairs arranged near the circular
 perimeter mingle with tables for gaming. The chamber becomes the
 reception chamber to the west, the dining hall to the north. A small
 tiled archway leads southwest, and to the east is the grand Entry
 Hall.

 Has this Place changed since last you were here? The work of some
 mischevious Spirit, or deceiving Daemon? It is but a slight tugging in
 your Marrow, yet a worrisome one.

 Entrance Hall
 In this grand Hall do heraldry andgreat pomp greet the visitor to this
 castle. Yet a visitor, betrayed, can quickly become a prisoner--a
 metal portcullis to the east now separates you from the castle
 threshold. You must take your leave instead to the round Chamber that
 lies westward, or else attend one of the two archways to the north and
 south.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order he kept his
 study! Had he lined his heart with good works the way he lined his

 Writing-Desk, then your grim task need never have been assigned you.
 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again

 Reception Chamber
 The glitterings of Gold, Jewels, Tapestries, &c. belie the Corruption
 of he who 'til recently occupied this high Seat. A white Carpet, once
 flanked by Sycophants & Counsellors, now lies untravelled. It leads
 away from the Seat & towards the Sunrise.

 The cruel Baron lies at your feet, dyeing the carpet scarlet with his
 blood.

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, walls covered with pagan frescoes which
 beckon you to unpure thoughts. Chairs arranged near the circular
 perimeter mingle with tables for gaming. The chamber becomes the
 reception chamber to the west, the dining hall to the north. A small
 tiled archway leads southwest, & to the east is the grand Entry Hall.

>go north

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favored Thinkers entered
 this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic
 repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare,
 stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the larger
 items remain--the long Table & the ornate Chairs.

 On the long Table is a Perpetuum Mobile.

>examine mobile
 This Device you have seen before, in the Library at Dol Nesta. An
 ingenious Perpetuum Mobile, built of Pipes, Gears, & Screws of
 Archimides. Whereby the Force exhibited by Water as it pours into a
 wide Funnel drives the Drawing of that water upward, to fall again
 through a Spout into the Funnel--on & on, ad infinitum. The Design is
 that of a certain Portuguese & the Baron seems to have been impressed
 with it so as to have it realized as a Fountain.

>get mobile
 To hold that you must have both hands free.

>drop robe
 Dropped.

>get mobile
 As you strain to lift the heavy Perpetuum, there is a Lurch & a sudden
 Outpouring of water, which seeps into the Floor. The Gears & Screws
 continue to spin as before, but the Machine is now dry.Taken.

>go east

 Entrance Hall
 In this grand Hall do heraldry &great pomp greet the visitor to this
 castle. Yet a visitor, betrayed, can quickly become a prisoner--a
 metal portcullis to the east now separates you from the castle
 threshold. You must take your leave instead to the round Chamber that
 lies westward, or else attend one of the two archways to the north &
 south.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

>go south

 Study
 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order he kept his
 study! Had he lined his heart with good works the way he lined his
 walls with books, kept his spiritual affairs as tidy as he kept his
 Writing-Desk, then your grim task need never have been assigned you.
 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again
 occupy it. A solid oak door blocks your way to the west & an archway
 leads north.

 Slaughter Yard
 In this small, walled Yard are the Beasts put to the knife and
 prepared for the master's feasting table. Unthinkably--but
 undoubtably--were other Prey too destroyed here, to feed the Baron's
 appetite for sin. There is no hiding place in this small Arena; meat,
 alive or dead, can escape only south, through the Kitchen.

 A bloated Pig lies here, its Stomach slit.

 The stump of an ancient Oak stands here. The steel blade of an Axe
 calls it home.

 O foul Hypocrite! O whited Sepulchure! In the midst of his debauchery
 the Baron does see fit to erect himself a Chapel of the faith! Mayhap
 he thought to take sanctuary here at your approach. 'Tis more likely

 A stair in the corner leads down into darkness, an archway northeast.
 A solid oak door prevents your going east.

 You can see the Baron's corpse here.

 Priest's Quarters
 In contrast to the Baron's opulence lurks here the spartan Cell of his
 corrupt Priest. The only furnishing is a straw Mat, the only
 concession to Luxury a tapestry which hangs near the upward-climbing
 stair.

 Have these Walls shifted? Is the Light different in its attentions
 upon your Eyes? Nay, for how could this be so? It must be your
 tiresome Confinement that makes your Memory falter. You had best find

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favored Thinkers entered
 this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic
 repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare,

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favoured Thinkers
 entered this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters
 of exotic repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands
 bare, stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the

 Gluttonous indeed were the the Feasts prepared in this Kitchen while

 The Baron's Fool lies besotted beneath a large Wine-Barrel.

 Slaughter Yard
 In this small, walled Yard were Beasts put to the knife & prepared for

 Prey too destroyed here, to feed the Baron's appetite for sin. There

 escape only south, through the Kitchen.

 A bloated Pig lies here, its Stomach slit.

 The stump of an ancient Oak stands here. The steel blade of an Axe
 calls it home.

 Reception Chamber
 The glitterings of Gold, Jewels, Tapestries, &c. belie the Corruption
 of he who 'til recently occupied this high Seat. A white Carpet, once
 flanked by Sycophants & Counsellors, now lies untravelled. It leads
 away from the Seat & towards the Sunrise.

 The cruel Baron lies at your feet, dyeing the carpet scarlet with his
 blood.

>go south
 From here you may go only east.

 You hear a terrible crashing sound to the east.

>go east

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, its walls covered in pagan Frescoes
 which beckon you to impure thoughts. Chairs arranged near the circular
 perimeter mingle with Tables for gaming. The chamber becomes the
 Reception Chamber to the west, the Dining Hall to the north. A small
 tiled archway leads southwest & to the east is the grand Entry Hall.

>go south
 Methinks you see exits where there are none.

>go southwest

 Chapel
 O foul Hypocrite! O whited Sepulchure! In the midst of his debauchery
 the Baron does see fit to erect himself a Chapel of the faith! Mayhap
 he thought to take sanctuary here at your approach. 'Tis more likely
 the lighted Candles & marble Altar did bear witness to blasphemous &
 terrible Rites in the Baron's lifetime.

 A stair in the corner leads down into darkness, an archway northeast.
 A solid oaken Door prevents your passage east.

 Wait Chamber
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go east

 Entrance Hall
 In this grand Hall do Heraldry & great Pomp greet the visitor to this
 Keep. Yet a visitor, betrayed, can quickly become a prisoner--a metal
 Portcullis to the east now separates you from the threshold. You must
 take your leave instead to the round Chamber that lies westward, or
 else attend one of the two archways to the north & south.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

>go south

 Study
 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order in which he kept
 his Study! Had he lined his heart with good Works the way he lined his
 walls with Books, kept his spiritual affairs as tidy as he kept his
 Writing-Desk, then your grim task need never have been assigned you.
 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again
 occupy it. A solid oak door blocks your way to the west & an archway
 leads north.

 The orderly appointment of the Books on their several Shelves is
 marred in one place by a Gap.

>consult books about soul
 The Soul, precious gift of God, that which distinguishes Man from
 Animal, is given small service in this library. What little there is,
 chiefly in Manuals devoted to dark and unholy Twistings of God's work,
 described by phrases unsuitable for repeating here.

>consult books about animals
 &lt;&lt;Animals are placed under the dominion of Man. Having no Souls, they
 must share in the Glory to him allotted, aligning themselves with his
 in these Volumes.

>consult books about god
 You glance through a few Volumes, but find nothing that seems
 relevant.

>consult books about religion
 Only a few books in the Library touch properly upon true Religion.
 Even these you suspect the Baron harbored for some darker Purpose.

>consult books about rosy-gold
 The sympathetic Alloy, much celebrated. &lt;&lt;It is of four parts of Gold,

>consult books about alloys
 &lt;&lt;An alloy such as Bronze or Electrum may be formed by the molten
 Merging of its several Composites. Some alloys of the nobler metals
 have mythic Powers--in particular the celebrated alliage sympathique,

>consult books about electrum
 The alloy of Gold & Silver; four parts of the one to one of the other.

>consult books about sympathetic
 In a work on alchymic Medicine you find the following:

 &lt;&lt;The sympathetic Alloy, Rosy-Gold, so named for its Colour. Its dust
 comprises Powder of Sympathy, or the Weapon-Salve, tho this is but its
 most convenient Form. Its true power lies in the bonding of its three

>consult books about powder of sympathy
 A work is devoted to the Weapon-Salve, or Powder of Sympathy, which is
 the dust of the sympathetic Alloy. &lt;&lt;The Powder heals when applied not
 to the Wound but to the Weapon. Most Injuries can it treat, tho it

>consult books about perpetual
 You find a reference to the Perpetuum Mobile (oddly enough) in a
 Discourse on religious Symbolism. Tho your brothers at the Monastery
 would follow the Arguments better than you can, the Ideas seem
 orthodox & you can make out most of what is said.

 The Perpetuum must exist, even if only in the mind of God (so says the
 Author, for the Work is a century old & so precedes the working
 Perpetuum) for it realizes the sacred Circle on a cosmic scale.
 Without the Perpetuum, the Cosmos is a strait Line, slowly declining
 in vital Force, sinking into Degeneracy & Oblivion. As God is the
 moral restorative of this vital Force, so is the Perpetuum, which does
 Work without losing Energy, its physical Restorative. When the vital
 Force moves back & forth between the Poles of Entropy & Restoration,
 is the Cosmos realized as a grand Circle.

>examine me
 You are a strapping Knight, secure in your faith & glowing with the
 chaste Excitement of a task accomplished.

>consult books about circle
 The Circle makes itself the Symbol of this great Faith, symbolizing
 all that was and all that will be. Sadly, most of the references you
 find in the Baron's Library pervert this great Truth by demonstrating
 methods of subverting and desecrating the true Cycles of God and
 Nature, life and death.

>consult books about cosmos

 There is a Work in the Library on the ontological status of the Idea,
 but it is too technical for you to follow.

>consult books about hourglass
 A history of Time-Keeping devotes considerable space to the
 Hour-Glass, its history occidental and oriental, its usages in
 Navigation, &c. A book of modern Philosophy waxes more poetic of the
 Time-Piece, seeing in it a symbol of the linearity of Time, the
 irretrievability of Moments past.

>consult books about time
 In a book on Meta-Physicks you find a waggish Summary of the
 Controversy surrounding the nature of Time: &lt;&lt;It is said by some that
 Time travelleth in a great Circle, by others that it maketh a strait
 Line. The former Description prevaileth, as we art obliged to listen
 to its Exponents again and again, the latter being content to assert

 Nesta.

 An Atlas describes the Town of Dol Nesta as &lt;&lt;a small mountain
 village, renowned for the quality of its Soil and the breadth of its

>examine atlas
 The Baron's library is full of heretical Ideas & Assertions most
 blasphemous. Yet here are also books of Metallurgy, of Alchymy & other
 useful Arts. A monk from Dol Nesta will need to be sent here to
 separate Wheat from Chaff, to save that which is useful & to destroy
 the Dross. While you are here, however, you may CONSULT the Library
 about its more wholesome topics.

 There is a noticable Gap between two particularly odious Books.

 following:

 In contrast to the Baron's opulence lurks here the spartan Cell of his

 Chapel

 Wait Chamber

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favored Thinkers entered
 this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic
 repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare,
 stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the larger
 items remain--the long Table & the ornate Chairs.

 On the long Table is a Perpetuum Mobile (which acts as a Water-Fall).

 Kitchen
 Gluttonous indeed were the the Feasts prepared in this Kitchen while
 the Baron still lived. The huge Ovens now stand cold & unlit, the
 Crockery smashed & strewn about the floor. The Dining Hall is to the
 east, & northwards is a small enclosed Yard. A stair leads downward
 into Darkness.

 The Baron's Fool lies besotted beneath a large Wine-Barrel.

 Store Room
 The gloomy Store Room has been recently sacked, though racks of Ham &
 strings of dried Fruit still hang above your head. A bag of Flour has

 Foot-Prints run frantic around the room & up the Stairs.

 A dented Box lies in a corner, seemingly kicked there by a thwarted
 Robber.

 dented Box: Your hands are full.

 Slaughter Yard
 In this small, walled Yard were Beasts put to the knife & prepared for
 the master's feasting table. Unthinkably--but undoubtably--were other
 Prey too destroyed here, to feed the Baron's appetite for sin. There
 is no hiding place in this small Arena; meat, alive or dead, can
 escape only south, through the Kitchen.

 A bloated Pig lies here, its Stomach slit.

 The stump of an ancient Oak stands here. The steel blade of an Axe
 calls it home.

 Reception Chamber
 The glitterings of Gold, Jewels, Tapestries, &c. belie the Corruption
 of he who 'til recently occupied this high Seat. A white Carpet, once
 flanked by Sycophants & Counsellors, now lies untravelled. It leads
 away from the Seat & towards the Sunrise.

 The cruel Baron lies at your feet, dyeing the carpet scarlet with his
 blood.

>go east

 Wait Chamber
 A richly attired Wait Chamber, its walls covered in pagan Frescoes
 which beckon you to impure thoughts. Chairs arranged near the circular
 perimeter mingle with Tables for gaming. The chamber becomes the
 Reception Chamber to the west, the Dining Hall to the north. A small
 tiled archway leads southwest & to the east is the grand Entry Hall.

 You hear a terrible crashing sound to the east.

>go east

 Entrance Hall
 In this grand Hall do Heraldry & great Pomp greet the visitor to this
 Keep. Yet a visitor, betrayed, can quickly become a prisoner--a metal
 Portcullis to the east now separates you from the threshold. You must
 take your leave instead to the round Chamber that lies westward, or
 else attend one of the two archways to the north & south.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

>go north

 Armoury
 An Armoury, stocked by the Baron for a siege but unable to protect him
 from the vengeance of the Almighty. Amidst the Armour, Weaponry &c.
 stands an archway to the south.

 A wooden Lance stands here, propped against a wall.

>sheath sword
 You sheathe your Blade.

 Taken.

 A wooden Wheel is mounted on the wall, near the Portcullis.

 Study
 If only the Baron had set his soul in the same order in which he kept
 his Study! Had he lined his heart with good Works the way he lined his
 walls with Books, kept his spiritual affairs as tidy as he kept his
 Writing-Desk, then your grim task need never have been assigned you.
 But the leather Arm-Chair now awaits a master who will never again
 occupy it. A solid oak door blocks your way to the west & an archway
 leads north.

 The orderly appointment of the Books on their several Shelves is
 marred in one place by a Gap.

>open desk
 You open the flap of the Writing-Desk, revealing a small but deep Hole
 in the south wall.

>thrust lance into hole
 I do not recognise that verb.

>put lance in hole
 Inserting the lance into the hole as far as you can, you feel the wood
 catch & hear the faraway grinding of stone. Removing the lance, you
 find it unchanged.

 Dining Hall
 On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favoured Thinkers
 entered this long Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters
 of exotic repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands
 bare, stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the
 larger items remain--the long Table & the ornate Chairs.

 On the long Table is a Perpetuum Mobile (which acts as a Water-Fall).

>go west

 Kitchen
 Gluttonous indeed were the the Feasts prepared in this Kitchen while
 the Baron lived. The huge Ovens now stand cold & unlit, the Crockery
 smashed & strewn about the floor. The Dining Hall is to the east, &
 northwards is a small enclosed Yard. A Stair leads downward into
 darkness.

 The Baron's Fool lies besotted beneath a large Wine-Barrel.

>go north

 Slaughter Yard
 In this small, walled Yard were Beasts put to the knife & prepared for
 the master's feasting table. Unthinkably--but undoubtedly--were other
 Prey too destroyed here, to feed the Baron's appetite for sin. There
 is no hiding place in this small Arena; meat, alive or dead, can
 escape only south, through the Kitchen.

 A bloated Pig lies here, its Stomach slit.

 The stump of an ancient Oak stands here. The steel blade of an Axe
 calls it home.

>get axe
 You remove the fine Axe from the Stump.

 The Baron's Fool lies besotted beneath a large Wine-Barrel.

 Store Room
 The gloomy Store Room has been recently sacked, though racks of Ham &
 strings of dried Fruit still hang above your head. A bag of Flour has
 been ripped open, its contents scattered. Hundreds of white
 Foot-Prints run frantic around the room & up the Stair.

 A dented Box lies in a corner, seemingly kicked there by a thwarted
 Robber.

 Wait Chamber

 Chapel
 O foul Hypocrite! O whited Sepulchure! In the midst of his debauchery
 the Baron does see fit to erect himself a Chapel of the faith! Mayhap
 he thought to take sanctuary here at your approach. 'Tis more likely
 the lighted Candles & marble Altar did bear witness to blasphemous &
 terrible Rites in the Baron's lifetime.

 A stair in the corner leads down into darkness, an archway northeast.
 A solid oaken Door prevents your passage east.

>chop door with axe
 You hack at the door with your Axe. Tho' sturdily built, it cannot
 stand under your strength. Slowly, the splinters of Wood give way to
 cracking Slabs, and with a final series of Blows you are afforded
 entry.

>go down

 Priest's Quarters
 In contrast to the Baron's opulence lurks here the spartan Cell of his
 corrupt Priest. The only furnishing is a straw Mat, the only
 concession to luxury a Tapestry which hangs near the upward-climbing
 Stair.

 The Priest sits on his mat, eyes downturned in submission.


>show box to priest
 The Priest treats your act as an accusation, and quails. &lt;&lt;The box? It

 before you.

 Though the Baron never took a Wife, 'tis said his bed was not a night

 Dresser & Looking-Glass. The door to the west is smashed, the door to
 the east closed, & a most curious Trap-Door is set into the ground
 near the bed.

 On the Dresser is a copper key.

 Alchymyst's Laboratory
 It is stifling hot in here, yet the flickering yellow glow of the
 small Furnace does little to light this room. On a long, acid-scarred
 Work-Bench sit Crucibles, Mortar & Pestle, &c. A stair leads up.

 A small opening in the Stone leads northwest.

 On the Work-Bench is a Book of evil Magic.

>examine furnace
 The Furnace is your equal in height, and its Insides glow yellow with
 concealed heat. It was no doubt used by the Baron to prepare scraps of
 the base Metals for their transmutation. Material placed in a vent
 soon runs molten into a stone collecting pan.

>bench

>examine bench
 The Baron's Work-Bench reeks of evil. The Crucibles & other

>examine book
 The book is one of foul & evil Magic, by an unknown Author. Its open
 Page is covered with Notes in the Baron's Hand. Tho it burns your eyes
 to look at its cursed Runes, you feel that by perusing the Baron's
 last Endeavour you may bring his activities to light.

 The Tyrant, it seems, was planning for his inevitable Demise. His
 study was of an ancient Curse, activated upon its caster's Death for
 the purpose of Revenge. The Recipe is black & foul, and at the end of
 is a caution to the would-be Warlock:

 &lt;&lt;Its close ties to the Caster's physical Blood make this Curse
 vulnerable to a Weakening or Breaking through methods of Sympathy. The
 tying of the curse to the Caster's Soul instead of to the Blood would
 make the Curse un-breakable, but none yet have accomplished this

 It seems the Baron commissioned a short Work on the operation of a

 The Tyrant, it seems, was planning for his inevitable Demise. His
 study was of an ancient Curse, activated upon its caster's Death for
 the purpose of Revenge. The Recipe is black & foul, and at the end of

 &lt;&lt;Its close ties to the Caster's physical Blood make this Curse
 vulnerable to a Weakening or Breaking through methods of Sympathy. The

 Astoundingly, he reports that where once stood par Tiller's Keep,
 there is naught now but a fallow Field, as smooth and empty as a blank
 Scroll. It is a Mystery which may never see Light, and you think oft

 through a Spout into the Funnel--on & on, ad infinitum. The Design is

 gone behind you.

 There is a major Easter egg in this game involving the pig. There is
 an extremely minor Easter egg in this game involving the 1980s
 American television show "The A Team". Apart from those two, there are
 not a whole lot of things you can do in this game just for fun. As
 Kevin once put it, "This character is not a fun guy." Once you've
 gotten the optimal ending and you understand what is going on in the
 keep, there's not much left to see.

 My next major game will probably be more light-hearted; my natural
 style is much closer to "Guess the Verb!" than to this game.

 By the way, if you're still wondering what major portions of the game
 are for, you haven't gotten the optimal ending. Also, if you're really
 strapped for fun, you can try to solve the game in as few moves as
 possible. I can get a winning ending in 32 turns (I'm pretty sure this
 is the absolute minimum) and the optimal ending in under 60.
