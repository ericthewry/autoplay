 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.




 Magic is real.

 Or that's what the Headmaster of Hogwarts College--no, Hogwarts School
 of Witchcraft and Wizardry--wants you to think. Assuming that you're
 not going insane, it seems like he's probably right. How else could you
 explain the way he appeared out of nowhere, or how he made you speak in
 rhyming couplets for ten minutes, or how he brought your grandmother's
 Lladró figurines to life and had them dancing with each other, or
 packed all your things with the wave of a wand, or...

 Then, he asked you to be his new Professor of Muggle Studies. Whatever
 a "Muggle" is. You just needed to sign the contract, say good-bye to
 your old place, and you'd be whisked away. By magic. To Scotland. To
 start your new job immediately.

 You asked for a little while to think. What you really meant, of
 course, was "a little while to go on a bender in celebration of all
 your notions about life and the world being shattered." That worked out
 pretty well, except you woke up with a pounding headache and a signed
 contract. Oh, and an old shoe, which apparently you are supposed to
 touch whenever you want to be transported. You're not sure how that
 works, but he put it around here somewhere--you can't quite remember
 where--and you'd better find it if you want to make it to Hogwarts.

 A magical contract is probably pretty unbreakable, yeah?

 Your Flat
 Your simple one-room flat, suitable to the needs of a young teacher.
 The place was advertised as a steal, and everyone who sees it has to
 admit that its bones are good. Unfortunately, it hasn't been redone
 since before the Second World War. Also, it's about the size of a
 postage stamp. It's cheap, anyway... You've got a bed, a wardrobe, a
 table, and an ancient Aga to cook on. One lonely broadside hangs on the
 south wall. The door on the north wall leads to the rest of the
 building. A packed trunk stands in the middle of the floor.

 On the table are a contract, a Hogwarts brochure, and a handful of
 yellow Jelly Babies.

>read contract
 full year, blah, blah, blah, painful death if you don't fulfill the
 terms of the contract, blah, blah, blah, then the signatures Albus
 Dumbledore and Alice Armstrong. Yep. That's your drunk-signature. You'd
 know it anywhere.

 Holy shit. It says that they can erase your memories if you don't
 actually hold up your end of the deal. It says they can hex you. What
 does hexing even mean? It doesn't sound very pleasant. ...looks like
 you're going to have to go to Hogwarts.

>examine broadside
 of poetry by Shelley.

 You read: All day the wizard lady sate aloof,
 Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,
 Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;
 Or broidering the pictured poesy
 Of some high tale upon her growing woof,
 Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye
 In hues outshining heaven - and ever she
 Added some grace to the wrought poesy.

 Now that you know what you know about magic, having "The Witch of
 Atlas" on your wall is pretty damn ironic.

>who is Sangita

 The Grand High Mugglewump or whoever he is kept offering you sweets.
 You tried to slip them down your sleeve so you didn't have to eat any.
 Hopefully he didn't notice. Even if you liked Jelly Babies, you
 probably couldn't have kept them down--you were pretty much in shock
 after he appeared unexpectedly in your flat. Maybe he thought that
 raising your blood sugar would help? Do wizards even have blood sugar?
 Well, of course they have blood sugar, they're human, aren't they?
 ...aren't they? God, this is not a good line of thinking.

>remember sangita

>examine brochure
 just happens to have moving pictures, including an aerial view of a
 craggy, hodgepodge castle that must be Hogwarts itself.

 You read:

 HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY
 Providing an excellent magical education since 909 AD
  Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Order of Merlin First Class, Grand Sorc.,
 Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump International Confed. of Wizards)--et
 cetera, et cetera.

 ...wait a minute. That's not what the brochure said when Dumbledore
 gave it to you at your interview. Then, it was about Hogwarts
 College--not Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--and it was all
 about how Hogwarts provides extensive bursaries for nearly all its
 students, and how they follow a unique educational programme, focusing
 on life skills and personal interests. And the pictures didn't
 move--and there certainly wasn't a picture of students flying around on
 broomsticks--and the section about Hogwarts's history didn't mention
 that most of the historical alumni still live there as ghosts.

 Of course, now that you think about it, it must have been an enchanted
 brochure. After you accepted the job and Dumbledore broke the news
 about magic to you, its nature changed. That makes as much sense as
 anything seems to lately.

 dingy brown canvas and lined with outstandingly ugly floral-sprigged
 paper. You can't see the paper, of course, because it's closed, stuffed
 to the brim with your clothes and knicknacks.

 Headmaster Dumbledore waved around that ridiculous wand and everything
 just jumped in there. The Lladrós even wrapped themselves up in
 newsprint to make sure they wouldn't crack! That probably convinced you
 more than anything--parlor tricks aside, absolutely nothing could make
 all your stuff fit in that little trunk except magic.

 selling point: so functional! Now that it's about to go into storage
 (well, that's what the Headmaster said would happen, anyway. Maybe it's
 going to go into a pocket dimension or something. Who knows?) you're
 feeling a bit wistful. Sangita was great, and you still pretty much
 miss her. It's been a year, though, and you'd better get over it. Maybe
 it's a good thing you're starting over in Scotland. There definitely
 won't be anything there to remind you of her.

 Nothing inside, not even dust--no old shoe.

>open wardrobe
 hide inside the wardrobe, behind her fur coats, and pound on the back
 wall to see if anyone in Narnia, on the other side, could hear you. The
 sound of the door creaking open brings it all back: the scent of the
 moth balls, the feel of her papery skin, the heavy warmth of the coats
 around you.

 No old shoe here, either. All this searching is doing exactly nothing
 for your headache.

>examine table

>look under table

>examine aga
 rusty and unassuming. At least the stove is functional, and you use the
 oven for storage.

 Actually, part of why you ended up taking this flat is the Aga. It's
 sentimental, really. When you were a small child, your parents' house
 had one just like it. Your mother never liked to cook--for her, a
 family meal meant going round the corner for curry take-away instead of
 actually sitting down in a restaurant--but whenever your grandmother
 came to visit, she'd make the most incredible meals on that crummy old
 thing. You can still practically taste everything--she did all the
 standards, a roast one day, bubble and squeak the next, tarts and
 scones and pies. Unfortunately, she never taught you any of it.

 Dumbledore's Office
 A circular room with a high, vaulted ceiling. It is filled with various
 magical instruments, an enormous claw-footed desk, and innumerable
 oddities--all of which have been pushed, higgledy-piggledy, to the
 walls, and some of which look much the worse for it. An elaborate perch
 stands forlornly next to the desk, with no bird seated on it. The walls
 themselves are covered in portraits of important-looking people. A
 spiral staircase appears to continually spin downwards--almost like an
 escalator--at the far end of the room.

 Wait, what?

>examine desk
 covered in chalked designs, strange and geometric.

 On the claw-footed desk is an iron bell.

 As you examine the designs, you walk around the desk--and notice a
 piece of purple parchment, dropped nearby. You pick it up.

 You read: INGREDIENTS. To be carried by spellcaster.
 The next bit is all symbols:
 a dot inside a circle;
 a crescent moon;
 a female symbol;
 a male symbol;
 a 2 with a 1 intersecting its tail;
 a female symbol with horns;
 a curiously embellished lower-case h;
 a circle bisected by a horizontal line;
 a circle with a complicated, Celtic-looking pattern.

 No, really, what the fuck is going on?

>examine bell
 side, as though somebody hastily dropped it.

 You've got a sinking feeling you know what's going on. This is Hogwarts
 School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. That was some bona fide wizardry
 there, only instead of being on your trunk, it was on you. Okay. All
 right. So the next step is to find Dumbledore. Why isn't he here?

>examine portraits
 televisions than oil paintings, however, as their inhabitants are
 animated. Most of them are sleeping, rhythmically breathing: "Dilys
 Derwent, headmistress 1741-1768," "Phineas Nigellus Black, headmaster
 1890-1925." One is awake, reading a book: "Newton Scamander, headmaster
 1930-1939." You deduce that they are former heads of Hogwarts.

>ask scamander about dumbledore

>talk to scamander

 "Of course I can, what do you think?" he replies.


>1
 figure out how to be polite to a portrait.

 He peers at you over the top of his book. "In my day we never would
 have thought of such a thing as having a Muggle at Hogwarts," he says,
 which does not seem to be quite on topic. "Particularly not one that's
 as rude as you. You were late. Very late. So he thought he'd get some
 business done first."


>1
 you ask, but before you can say anything further, yet another weird
 thing happens. A bizarre little man appears, floating between you and
 Scamander's portrait. He seems to have come from the ceiling,
 but--where could he have been, up there?

 Before you have a chance to say anything, even to exclaim in surprise,
 he shouts in a singsong voice, "Oi! It's the new Muggly-girl!" He
 dances around--surprising, how he can manage to dance in midair--to
 hover with his feet just on the level of your nose. "I, of course, am
 Peeves the Proper, King of this castle. Bet you're wondering what's
 going on, aren't you? Eh-eh-eh?" The bells on his hat jingle.

 "Yeah, uh, starting with -" you begin, but he cuts you off.

 "There once was a lazy headmaster
 who thought he could cast a spell faster.
 But the corners he cut
 slammed dimension doors shut
 and now he's a missing spellcaster!"

 "Get out of here, Peeves," Scamander says. "I'll call the Bloody
 Baron!" To your surprise, the threat seems to work: Peeves disappears
 as quickly as he came.

 All right. So Dumbledore tried to cast a spell and everybody
 disappeared, including him. That makes... well, it makes a weird kind
 of sense. It seems like you have a couple of options--you could try to
 fix the spell, even though you're not magical, or you could try to
 figure out where you are and start walking home. Maybe you could find a
 train station or something.

 Why did you ever think this whole teaching thing was a good idea?

>wake nigellus

>talk to scamander

 "Yes?"


 This has been fun and all, but you're pretty much ready to go home now.

>3

 "Excuse me?" the Headmaster asks.

 "I mean--you're not a hologram or something? You and the other
 paintings?"

 "What in Merlin's name is a hologram?" he inquires. It occurs to you
 that you don't actually know how holograms are made. What's that
 phrase--'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
 magic'?


>1

 "The castle poltergeist. I'm not entirely clear on why he didn't
 disappear along with all the other ghosts," Scamander muses. "Perhaps
 he's simply too annoying for magic to deal with."


>2

 Scamander sighs. "You heard Peeves," he says. "The headmaster and his
 assistant were making complex adjustments to the castle's wards.
 Something related to your arrival here, as I understand it. In any
 case, something they did went wrong, and off they went, Merlin knows
 where. I believe you've already found their notes." Well, shit.

 "Um. Thanks," you say, to be polite.

>talk to scamander

 "Yes?"


>2

 "How should I know?" Scamander asks. "I've been a portrait since 1991,
 and before that I never came here if I could help it. Being the
 Headmaster stank."


>1

 "The only thing Peeves is scared of. I don't suppose the threat will
 work long--any minute now he'll figure out that the Baron's not around,
 and then he'll be insufferable."

>ring bell

 The sound makes you think. There was a church quite near Grandma's
 house and when the bells rang she'd ring a little bell of her own. It
 was a funny tic. She'd ring the bell at plenty of things, actually--the
 toad that lived in her garden and the owls that flew in to visit,
 various pots and pans in her kitchen, sometimes even at you. Grandma
 liked bells. "They scare the faeries out," she'd say, but you knew
 perfectly well that she was just telling you old wives" tales.

 on one wall, and on another hangs a portrait of a fat lady in a pink
 dress. A squirming staircase--yes, really squirming, it's weird - leads
 down; a narrow passage leads northwest; an ordinary door leads south;
 and a feather-strewn archway leads northeast.  Not very much like a
 stately castle, you have to say.

 Now how are you going to get back up to the office? There's got to be
 some kind of mechanism for moving the gargoyle, or another way up, but
 you sure can't see it.

 She looks at you doubtfully. "Muggle transport? It'd take you days, if
 you're going to walk. Anyhow, the castle's sealed itself up when
 whatever-it-was happened, to prevent the problem from growing. You
 can't go anywhere."

 "The castle knows when something's wrong," she explains slowly, as
 though speaking to a particularly dense child. "There must be something
 really wrong, too, because it's decided that nobody can come in or out.
 The wards are all tight as can be; only a Portkey can get you in here
 now, and nothing can get you out till things are fixed."

 asks.

 "Well, you must be one then. That's bad luck. You can't do magic, is
 what a Muggle is. Sometimes a Muggle can reverse a spell, but who knows
 if you can manage this one?" she asks, apparently rhetorically. "You'll
 have to look into it. Try the library."

 Owlery
 You must be in the top of a tall tower; the room is circular, cold, and
 echoing. Owls swoop in and out of the many unglassed windows. Four
 perches jut from the walls, high above your head, in each cardinal
 direction. An owl-parrot seems to have made himself a nest of feathers
 on the floor. You can also head southwest through a feather-strewn
 archway. Lots of feathers all over. Wow. Apparently wizards have a
 thing for birds.

 You haven't seen an owl since Grandma died--her house was always ground
 zero for owls. Day or night, there were always one or two around. She
 even kept a few mice on hand to feed them, like a normal person would
 keep birdseed. Kind of bloodthirsty, for an old lady, now that you
 think about it.

 As you enter, the owl-parrot turns his enormous head to look at you.
 "Awk. Here for the medallion?" he asks. "Ah--yes?" you respond. "CALL
 the owls," he says. "Owls are very polite. Owls like names. Four
 pieces. Four owls. Four names. Four names! CALL the names, CALL the
 owls!"

 You weigh the four pieces of wood in your hands for a moment--and then
 it strikes you. Fitting them together just so, you make a little wooden

 Various items necessary for divination are fitted into nooks in the
 circular walls. One high shelf runs around the walls, about a foot and

 nestle around a low table. A silver ladder leads down.

 glazed porcelain. She's clothed in a lovely white dress covered in
 eyelet lace. As you examine her delicate patent leather shoes, she
 seems to notice that you're staring. She turns to face you--moving her
 whole body, as her head cannot turn on her neck. She stares back at
 you, her immobile face pure and blank, for a long moment. Then she
 returns to her original posture.

>talk to doll
 twenty-four hours ago you thought magic was all bullshit. "Excuse me,

 that tourmaline ball that you've got there? I really need it."

 You've clearly piqued the doll's interest; she awkwardly examines the
 ball, then inches towards the edge of the shelf and peers over. It must
 seem very far, even though she is a large doll. She begins to writhe.
 It takes you a moment to realise that she's trying to shake her head
 "no." To be fair, if you were made of porcelain, you'd probably be
 sensitive about the risk of smashing too.

 seems to have merely been scoping out his new situation, waiting to
 make himself known. He has more or less managed to communicate to me
 that he would like his silky black mane back; he seems to be rather
 vain, and quite proud of the silver that I used to replace his split
 hoof. (Thank heavens that part of the curse is a Muggle myth; not being
 able to handle Sickles would be quite frustrating.) As a wig would
 spoil the effect of the skeleton, and the beast is quite rude about it,
 I'm apt to let him stew in his own juices until he becomes more polite.

 Potions Classroom
 A large, rather damp room. A long stone table is its primary feature. A
 heavy door stands a little ajar at the north end of the room, as though
 someone were just going through it when they disappeared. The corridor

 On the stone table are a copper cauldron (in which is an icy potion)
 and a potions book.

 A small and cluttered room. A large and intricate card file takes up

 On the metal desk are a printing press, a piece of type, a list of
 banned items, and a Kwikspell course.

 so, even though you've never actually handled a piece of type before,
 it seems familiar to you. The font's familiar too. It's clearly not a
 computer font. The serifs are somehow wrong, not slantwise, but--just
 off, a little. It looks like it came from a parallel universe. But, of
 course, now that you think about it, it's rather like the font Sangita

 You can see a tin cup here.

 The silver hoof is surprisingly heavy in your pocket. You used to have
 a hoof from a horse, and it was much lighter. It wasn't silver, but it
 was cloven like the one you got from the skeleton. Now that you think
 about it, it couldn't have been from a horse, of course--horses don't
 have cloven hooves. It was big, though, and when you were little and
 going through your horse phase you used it to stamp out prints in the
 dust, so you could pretend you were really riding along. Kind of
 macabre.

>take tin

 That tin cup feels abnormally small in your hand, and it takes you a
 moment to resolve the cognitive dissonance. You drank from a tin cup
 like this as a child in your grandmother's kitchen, and then it was
 just the right size. Grandma would pour you a dose of her cold remedy
 in that cup--not hot but peppery, peppery, peppery! "It'll pep her up,"
 Grandma would say to your mum, "stop fussing," and yes, it always did
 seem to help more than any medicine Mum got from the pharmacy.

 Grandma Gigi's snug kitchen, with its Aga and its aura of coziness,

 Fortunately, Grandma chuckles.

 Then two people pop into existence. Albus Dumbledore is standing behind
 his desk. Standing next to you - somehow, for some strange reason - is
 Sangita.

 "Why, Miss Armstrong!" Dumbledore says. "I'd hoped you wouldn't be too
 nonplussed at our little mishap. I assume that you fixed things
 yourself? --Excellent, excellent!" While you are still gaping, he
 rushes out the door. "Many things to attend to!" he calls, airily, over
 his shoulder. "You've got things to talk about, I expect!" ...and
 you're alone with your ex-girlfriend.

 "I can explain," she says. "Ally--I'm a witch."


>1
 not. I asked what you're doing here."

 "Albus only told me you were coming today," she says. "I wanted to be
 here so I could tell you about everything."


>2

 "I couldn't!" she says. "It's the law - our law, I couldn't tell you
 unless you were part of my family. Unless we were married. They
 would've snapped my wand, Ally, you have to understand that."


>1
 another wand."

 "I couldn't get another one," she says. "Breaking a wand means throwing
 us out of the wizarding world. Forever."


>2
 in the Muggle world well enough, else we'd never have met... what does
 it mean for you, otherwise? Being banished."

 "Legally speaking, you become like a Muggle," Sangita says. "It's like
 becoming a child again. All your rights--stripped."


>2
 would lose your status too. So you couldn't change it, not ever,
 because you'd be out just like me."

 "Yes. And we hide the wizarding world from you. It isn't fair at all.
 I've been trying to change it. I swear I didn't want to lie to you, I
 never put a spell on you, nothing. But it wouldn't have done any good
 for me to have my wand snapped."


>2
 it's hard. You have to know it's hard. How can I ever trust you?--Is
 anyone else I know a witch?"

 But Sangita's face is closed and you know she's about to drop something
 heavy on you. "She wanted you to know," she says. "Your grandmother.
 Oh, surely you caught the hints! But she couldn't tell you either."


>2
 know. "I suppose I knew that," you say. Suddenly grief crashes in on
 you. "Look, I think you ought to leave me alone for a bit," you say.
 "Just go."

 She goes. She can't even look at you. You are alone.

 "Hello, my dear," Dumbledore says, swooping in just as Sangita swoops
 out. "I take it that your conversation was not easy?--Well, it's only
 to be expected. But now I would imagine you have a great many questions
 to ask me."


>2

 "I was modifying the wards," he says.


>2
 a great job of hiding your emotions right now.

 "I was modifying them to allow you in," he replies. "It isn't just
 Muggles they keep out, either. There is evil in the world."


>1
 think--Look, I don't care if magic is real, Sauron isn't."

 "Not Sauron," Dumbledore replies. "Much more banal than that. Ah well:
 ignorance is bliss! Perhaps an enterprising young wizard will sell the
 story to a Muggle movie studio someday, and you can see it all on the
 gold screen."

 "Silver screen," you correct automatically. Wizards are truly weird.


>2

 "I know all the students who have attended Hogwarts during my tenure,"
 he says. "In any case, our interests coincide quite often."


>1

 "Yes, the magical qualities of the printed book--but our politics also
 align admirably," he says. "Miss Gopalan is, perhaps, an idealist on
 the issue of Muggle liberation; but I respect her with all my heart."


>1

 "Miss Gopalan is a good Hufflepuff, interested in following the rules
 and living her life in a rational and ordered way; but she deeply
 believes that Muggles have the right to know about the wizarding world,
 however inconvenient it might be for us." Dumbledore sighs. "I agree
 with her that far--but she does not consider the wider political
 climate, the lurking presence of Lord Voldemort and the danger he
 poses. That is far more immediate than any long-standing injustice."


>1
 what's wrong and what's right. You're talking about lying to most of
 the population. I can't tell you what betrayal -"

 "A natural Gryffindor," Dumbledore says. "Ah, well. My House is not
 without its follies." You refrain from asking what a Gryffindor's
 traits are. You probably wouldn't like the answer.


>2
 you manage to make an exception for me?"

 "The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy is the main thing," he
 replies. "As for how you were excepted--Muggles with wizarding children
 are already excepted, of course, and Squibs. So you see, it wasn't all
 that difficult to convince them that you would be an excellent
 candidate for the Muggle Studies position, and that it was not a
 startling deviation from the Statute to inform you of our world."


>2

 You've hit a nerve. Dumbledore does not look happy. "Enforcement is
 haphazard at best," he says. "Certainly Muggles are Obliviated. For
 wizards, however, the punishment can be as light as a warning or as
 severe as utter banishment. One never knows. All depends on influence
 and luck."


>1
 say slowly. "Do you enjoy playing God? Muggles have laws
 against--against brain-washing, and kidnapping, and everything."

 "Muggle laws do not apply to wizards," Dumbledore says, "and Muggles
 have few rights under wizarding law. The law sees wizards as benevolent
 parents and Muggles as ignorant children."


>2
 you ask, even though you know it's true, that he would have. "It says
 something about 'hexing', too. Would you have hexed me?"

 "It was a risk," Dumbledore says, "but a worthwhile risk. It is only by
 more contact with Muggles that we will ever begin to grow closer to the
 Muggle world. We need someone like you at Hogwarts."


>1

 "Oh, there was a great deal to attend to," he says. "You did wreak some
 havoc, didn't you?"


>1
 fooled one bit, but he smiles indulgently and lets you save face.


>1

 "You have a choice before you, Alice," Dumbledore says. "I believe I
 speak for the entire staff of Hogwarts when I say that we would be
 honored if you choose to remain with us. Otherwise, I shall release you
 from your contract. You signed it, after all, in a rather impaired
 state." He touches his nose--and how did he know that? You never told
 him! "So--will you stay at Hogwarts?"
>%showpartial
>yes

 "I am very glad, my dear girl," the Headmaster says. "I thought you
 must have had some of Gertrude's spirit in you. It won't be an easy row
 to hoe, you know, the Ministry of Magic will almost certainly wish to
 hold an inquiry--but what am I doing? I believe that Miss Gopalan will
 be waiting in the hallway, and she will be very eager to hear what you
 have chosen."

 You take a deep breath. "There wasn't really any other choice to make,"
 you say. "I can't help Sangita fight if I can't remember what I'm
 fighting for."

 Then two people pop into existence. Albus Dumbledore is standing behind
 his desk. Standing next to you - somehow, for some strange reason - is
 Sangita.

 "Why, Miss Armstrong!" Dumbledore says. "I'd hoped you wouldn't be too
 nonplussed at our little mishap. I assume that you fixed things
 yourself? --Excellent, excellent!" While you are still gaping, he
 rushes out the door. "Many things to attend to!" he calls, airily, over
 his shoulder. "You've got things to talk about, I expect!" ...and
 you're alone with your ex-girlfriend.

 "Hello, my dear," Dumbledore says, swooping in just as Sangita swoops
 out. "I take it that your conversation was not easy?--Well, it's only
 to be expected. But now I would imagine you have a great many questions
 to ask me."


 "Given the events of today, it seems unwise that you come to Hogwarts
 as a Muggle Studies teacher," Dumbledore says, "which means that there
 is only one path open to me."

 "Obliviation," you say flatly.

 "Just so. But if you like--I might consider asking Miss Gopalan to pay
 you a visit, after you are returned to London. It will be dangerous for
 her to defy the Ministry--but I suspect that today's events have
 galvanized her against them in any case. So. Yes or no?
>3
>yes
 "I hope that we neither of us are making a mistake--and I hope the
 Ministry of Magic does not get wind of this, at the inevitable
 inquiry," Dumbledore says. "Is there any message you would like to send
 yourself--after?"

 "Only promise me that Sangita won't just tell me about herself," you
 say. "Promise me she'll tell me about Grandma Gigi. And about you. And
 about all the things I couldn't ask."

 "Very well," he says, and raises his wand, and the world goes dark.

 This room doesn't look like a classroom at all; it's more like an
 unholy cross between an old-fashioned tea-shop and someone's attic. The
 air is stiflingly warm and scented with a heavy, sickening perfume.
 Various items necessary for divination are fitted into nooks in the
 circular walls. One high shelf runs around the walls, about a foot and
 a half from the ceiling. A fat little pouf and an ugly chintz armchair
 nestle around a low table. A silver ladder leads down.

 On the high shelf is a china doll.

 You idly caress the surface of the tourmaline ball, and then you
 remember why it seems so familiar. Sangita had a ball like
 this--exactly like this, actually. She used to juggle it, keeping it in
 contact with her skin, running it up and down her arms and over her
 chest. She was quite good.

 Well, you've got all the things that you seem to need now - one for
 each of the symbols in the notes. If you know the magic word, you
 should be able to reverse the spell and bring back the denizens of
 Hogwarts.

 Divination Landing
 An extremely tiny landing with a brass plaque affixed to the low
 ceiling. A narrow passageway leads southeast, and a silver ladder leads
 up through a trapdoor.

>se
 Purple Corridor
 The walls and ceiling are painted a violent shade of purple. The floor
 seems to have turned green with envy. A gargoyle of curious mien stands
 on one wall, and on another hangs a portrait of a fat lady in a pink
 dress. A squirming staircase leads down; a narrow passage leads
 northwest; an ordinary door leads south; and a feather-strewn archway
 leads northeast.

>talk to gargoyle

 Dumbledore's Office
 A circular room with a high, vaulted ceiling. It is filled with various
 magical instruments, an enormous claw-footed desk, and innumerable
 oddities--all of which have been pushed, higgledy-piggledy, to the
 walls, and some of which look much the worse for it. An elaborate perch
 stands forlornly next to the desk, with no bird seated on it. The walls
 themselves are covered in portraits of important-looking people. A
 spiral staircase appears to continually spin downwards--almost like an
 escalator--at the far end of the room.

 Then two people pop into existence. Albus Dumbledore is standing behind
 his desk. Standing next to you - somehow, for some strange reason - is
 Sangita.

 "Why, Miss Armstrong!" Dumbledore says. "I'd hoped you wouldn't be too
 nonplussed at our little mishap. I assume that you fixed things
 yourself? --Excellent, excellent!" While you are still gaping, he
 rushes out the door. "Many things to attend to!" he calls, airily, over
 his shoulder. "You've got things to talk about, I expect!" ...and
 you're alone with your ex-girlfriend.

>talk to sangita

 "I can explain," she says. "Ally--I'm a witch."


>1
 not. I asked what you're doing here."

 "Albus only told me you were coming today," she says. "I wanted to be
 here so I could tell you about everything."


>1
 clean," you say. You're not even a little bit sorry that it comes out
 sharp as can be.

 "I couldn't!" she says. "It's the law - our law, I couldn't tell you
 unless you were part of my family. They would've snapped my wand, Ally,
 you have to understand that."


>1
 another wand."

 "I couldn't get another one," she says. "Breaking a wand means throwing
 us out of the wizarding world. Forever."


>1
 honestly."

 Sangita looks uncomfortable. "Well. Legally speaking Muggles are--it
 isn't fair, all right, but Muggles are worse than children. They
 haven't any rights, practically."


>1
 whenever? What spells did you put on me?"

 "Only to protect the wizarding world from discovery," Sangita says. "I
 don't like it either, but it's been the law since 1692. The
 International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Since we broke up it's
 been--it was a wake-up call for me, Ally. I didn't ever put a spell on
 you. I swear it."


>1
 Who else do I know who's been lying to me? I'm just not special enough,
 am I." You snort, but you aren't finding anything very funny just now.
 "You must've gotten a good laugh out of World of Warcraft, and me the
 mage."

 But Sangita's face is closed and you know she's about to drop something
 heavy on you. "She wanted you to know," she says. "Your grandmother.
 Oh, surely you caught the hints! But she couldn't tell you either."


>1
 just--"That fucking tops all," you say. "Get out. I don't ever want to
 see you again."

 "Ally -"

 "GET BLOODY OUT!"

 She gets. You're left alone.

 "Hello, my dear," Dumbledore says, swooping in just as Sangita swoops
 out. "I take it that your conversation was not easy?--Well, it's only
 to be expected. But now I would imagine you have a great many questions
 to ask me."


>4
 you manage to make an exception for me?"

 "The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy is the main thing," he
 replies. "As for how you were excepted--Muggles with wizarding children
 are already excepted, of course, and Squibs. So you see, it wasn't all
 that difficult to convince them that you would be an excellent
 candidate for the Muggle Studies position, and that it was not a
 startling deviation from the Statute to inform you of our world."


>1
 turn us all into frogs if we got uppity."

 Dumbledore looks sad. "Witches were burned in the streets not so long
 ago. We live longer than you do: we remember better than you do."


>1
 there's some religious freaks, but you make it sound like Muggles are
 savages."

 "Not just witch-burning," Dumbledore says. "We can heal wounds quickly
 and easily. We can Transfigure lead into gold. We can walk around,
 invisible. What do you think your Prime Minister thinks of that? He
 knows about us. He's terrified of us."


>1
 is mad. You can probably cure cancer and you're keeping it from us. You
 enjoy playing God, I suppose."

 "I do not play God," Dumbledore says, but he sounds--troubled? It's
 strange; he seemed so unflappable before. "I have had this conversation
 before, believe it or not; and once we get to this point, there is not
 much point in continuing. Only your own experience of the wizarding
 world can help you understand."


>1

 "Oh, there was a great deal to attend to," he says. "You did wreak some
 havoc, didn't you?"


>2
 as though I asked for all this to happen."

 "One should never sign a contract if one doesn't know precisely what it
 means," he replies. "Why, last time I did that, I ended up the
 foster-father of a hundred and seven baby Fwoopers. Enough to drive you
 mad!"


>2

 "I know all the students who have attended Hogwarts during my tenure,"
 he says. "In any case, our interests coincide quite often."


>2

 Dumbledore looks affronted. "My dear, the decision to lie to you--or
 rather to exclude certain truths--was not and has never been hers to
 make. One of the reasons she and I get on so well is that she is one of
 the few wizards with a more radical view of Muggles than my own."


>2
 you say. "If they'd snapped her wand for telling me, it'd have been
 worth it."

 "If they'd snapped her wand for telling you, they'd have erased her
 memory of the wizarding world entire," Dumbledore says sharply. "She'd
 forget you too. Everything. If she were lucky, she'd wander homeless
 for awhile, then somehow find a job at a press--if they were kind
 enough to leave her memories of how to print. No-one would ever know.
 She wouldn't be a martyr; she'd be forgotten."


>2
 any right to make me fall in love with her if she was going to be lying
 to me. It's like --like a slave being forced to sleep with their
 master."

 "Really," Dumbledore says, his voice doubtful and even a little
 scornful, but he does not say anything else.


>1

 "I was modifying the wards," he says.


>1
 What could wizards possibly be afraid of?" you ask.

 "Other wizards," he says. "Muggles do not have a monopoly on evil."


>2
 people would abuse their magic. But Muggles couldn't fight that. We
 wouldn't have a chance."

 "That's one of the reasons people claim that it is easier to keep our
 worlds separated," he says. "Our wars don't spill over into your world
 as much. You needn't fear struggles you have no hand in."

 "Well, that's infantilizing."

 "Quite."


>1

 "Given the events of today, it seems unwise that you come to Hogwarts
 as a Muggle Studies teacher," Dumbledore says, "which means that there
 is only one path open to me."

 "Obliviation," you say flatly.

 "Just so. But if you like--I might consider asking Miss Gopalan to pay
 you a visit, after you are returned to London. It will be dangerous for
 her to defy the Ministry--but I suspect that today's events have
 galvanized her against them in any case. So. Yes or no?
>no

 "Perhaps you are wise," Dumbledore says, his voice low and disappointed
 nonetheless. "The Ministry will hold an inquiry, and it would certainly
 all come out then. I had hoped..."

 "Only be thorough about it," you say. "I don't want to remember any of
 it. I don't even want to remember Sangita if I can possibly help it.
 Ignorance is bliss, isn't it? So put me back."

 And he does.
