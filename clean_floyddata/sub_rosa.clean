 To name a secret is to destroy it and Confessor Destine is a man made
 of secrets. It has taken seventeen careful years but soon he will be
 undone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Leathery Cliff</span>
 You stand calf-deep in mud beneath a leathery cliff that bisects the
 otherwise endless Mambling Plain. You have with you all the tools
 you'll need to infiltrate the Destine mansion and discover what lies
 the Confessor has concealed. Somewhere along this cliff is the
 possibility of an intersection into another plain.

>inventory

 You are wearing:
   your llama-suit (muddy)

 You are carrying:
   the somnuliser
   the attuning set
   a Winkerchief

>examine llama suit

 From feet to appendages to head, your form is completely covered by a
 thin-weave suit made wholly from the wool of the pellucid llama. It
 renders you undetectable to all the senses that matter, including your
 own.

 You wove it yourself under the tutelage of the master weaver, White
 Widow. For her knowledge and silence she only asked for the
 whereabouts of her seven wayward sons. As you wove the invisible
 thread, she slowly and solemnly sapped each one, all the while
 instructing you on how to avoid dropping unseeable lines.

 Your lower legs are splattered with mud from the trek through the
 Mambling Plains.

>examine winkerchief

 The Winkerchief is a branded wipe cloth that perfectly wipes clean any
 surface. It's good for about a dozen uses before it loses its
 porousness.

>examine somnuliser

 The somnuliser works as a small bomb. If thrown, it emits spores of
 untraceable potentiality, making it praeternaturally likely that
 anyone coming into contact with the spores will fall asleep with the
 firm belief that their sleepiness is natural and unnotable. It has but
 one use, but once activated its spores should propagate through halls
 throughout the entire house, slowed only as it seeps under the doors.
 It should incapacitate everyone in the wing, but you'll have to be
 inside first for it to have an effect.

>examine attuning set

 The set is a twist of lead rods that can be used to <span class="floydstyle em">attune</span>
 the possibilities inherent in things in favour of the holder.

 A gust of wind blows across the cliff, flapping a loose sheet of skin.

 The cliff feels warm to touch as you pull down the flaking sheet of

 You run the attuning set lightly over the sheet but the lead rods
 barely even shimmer; it doesn't need attuning to you.

 (with your attuning set)
 You run the attuning set along the cliff. This was the place the Tacit
 One said the intersection would be. Just when you begin to suspect
 that the urn-dweller had set you up for failure, you spot a slim gap
 in the leather cliff: the intersection.

>enter intersection

 To step Mambling mud into Confessor Destine's carpets would be your

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blue Rose Garden</span>
 The Blue Rose Garden of the Destine clan is one of the Five
 Transcendent Gardens and is comprised of a single rose bush grown to
 magnificent proportions. Its offshoots form a prickled boundary,
 enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow with
 uniform fecundity. From a rockery in the centre of the garden, from
 which all the offshoots stem, is the core bush and from it grows a
 pristine bouquet.

 The Destine mansion rises up to the west. A maze of flowers are
 reflected in the tooth-glass dome of the greenhouse, its sliding door
 almost completely flush with the unpanelled pane.

 Balanced precariously on the greenhouse dome is your attuning set, a
 whole storey out of reach.

 The somnuliser lies unscathed on the ground beside you.

 The greenhouse dome is smooth and impossible to climb by any
 conventional means, and most unconventional means.

>examine roses

 The flowers in the rose garden are all roses and every one of them is
 blue. The flowers at the outer reaches are a pale celeste, whilst
 those closest to the central bush are a rich cobalt.

 Splayed across some of the flowers is your Winkerchief.

 You remember your lessons when you were studying to become the
 Orloger; Counter Cur taught you everything you didn't want to know
 about sums.

 "In order to calculate the area of a bounded plain, you must find the
 length of the cross product of the vectors of its 2 adjacent sides,"
 he said.

 You didn't see why you couldn't just ask the letter-beast doing the
 binding, but you humoured the Counter at the time.

 "Well," Counter Cur continued, "if B (Bx, By, Bz) and C (Cx, Cy, Cz)
 are the vectors of its 2 adjacent sides and A (Ax, Ay, Az) is the
 cross product, then you must find A = B x C using this formula:

 "Ax = By Cz - Bz Cy
 Ay = Bz Cx - Bx Cz
 Az = Bx Cy - By Cx."

 "My memory is good, but there's got to be a better way of memorising
 this," you said.

 "You will notice," Cur continued, "that if you replace x with y, y
 with z and z with x you can get from the first line to the second line
 and from the second line to the third line."

 "So all I need to do is remember the first line, right?" you said.

 "Precisely," said Cur, "and you do that by remembering the handy
 mnemonic 'xyzzy'."

 And that's how you cal... wait a minute, you didn't spend seventeen
 years preparing to break into the Confessor's mansion just to find out
 the area of the plain.

 Before moving further, you'll need to rescue your attuning-set from
 the dome.


 No, if you throw it out here it'll just disperse out harmlessly.


 The Winkerchief isn't exactly ideal for throwing at things.


 You can't quite see that, at least as described.


 Do you mean:



 You'd like to do just that: pluck one of the Confessor's famous roses
 and feel its petals pulp in your fist. But you will not give him the
 pleasure of leaving so obvious a trace.


 Emerging from a curse-stone rockery is the central bush of blue rose
 garden. On the central bush, from which all the offshoots grow, is the
 most perfect of the <span class="floydstyle em">impossibly</span> blue roses. The single stem
 terminates in a full vivid bloom: its colour is vibrant even in
 citylight.


 Beneath the central rose bush is a masterfully assembled rockery made
 up of asymmetrically tessellating curse-stones placed to create a
 perfect hectahedron

 It's unclear how the rose is so well hydrated with the solid rockery
 sitting on top of its main body of roots.


 You take a curse-stone and instantly the rockery takes on a sinister
 and unnatural cast. You are momentarily overwhelmed by an insidious
 metaphysical wrongness before your Lemniscate training takes over and
 you shrug away the impossibility.


 You slowly exhale, eyeing up the attuning set in the citylight. Your
 overhand throw was tested often in the various Theocratic games,
 although that was nearly two decades ago. You hurl the rock through
 the air and it catches the attuning set on one corner of its
 outstretched rods and it slides down into the garden.


 Firstly the rock: You take the rock. It's a single seventeen-sided
 curse-stone. To gaze on a curse-stone in isolation for too long is to
 invite madness. The afflicted, the geocultists, only meet peace when
 their stone is perfectly enmeshed with other curse-stones in the form
 of a perfect solid.

 And finally the attuning set: You get the attuning set.

>attune door

 (with your attuning set)
 You move the attuning set in the forbidden sideways figure-of-eight
 that your wrists naturally settle in when in motion. The lead rods of
 the set shimmer and you feel an intense feeling of rightness with the
 sliding door: it is attuned to you, for now.

>open door

 The door slides effortlessly open and you're greeted by a wave of rich
 warm air from the greenhouse.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 You step into the greenhouse and the warmth envelops you, assaulting
 you with a panopoly of scents.

 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. A closed blue door leads west into the house.

 The hayberry bush is laden with bright red round berries. The banberry
 shrub is a small sapling. The spindleweed is in thin yellow strands.

>examine sapling

 The plants in the greenhouse grow and die in a rapid cycle, proceeding
 through all possible stages of their life endlessly due to the lead
 enriched soil.

 The hayberry bush is dead, rotting on the soil. Large white flowers
 blossom on the banberry shrub. Tiny sprouts of spindleweed are
 growing.

>examine spindleweed

 The plants in the greenhouse grow and die in a rapid cycle, proceeding
 through all possible stages of their life endlessly due to the lead
 enriched soil.

 The hayberry bush is bare, its leaves small and its branches stubby.
 Hard red berries hang like droplets from the banberry shrub. The
 spindleweed leaves are long and thin.

>examine berries

 The plants in the greenhouse grow and die in a rapid cycle, proceeding
 through all possible stages of their life endlessly due to the lead
 enriched soil.

 Small yellow flowers blossom across the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is covered in dozens of black obloid berries. The spindleweed
 stalks have grown higher and the leaves broader.

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 At last you tip-toe into echo-prone confines of the Destine Mansion,
 each room carved out of what was once a small mountain. You sacrificed
 three toes to learn how many secrets would bring the Confessor down.
 Seven. There are seven deceits you know can be found in these halls
 and you won't leave until you know them.

 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a closed leathery red door bars the way
 west into the rest of the house.

 Clashing with the kitchen's decor is an ugly square rug, lying flat by
 your feet.

>examine rug

 The rug is a thick slab of carpet with a beguiling pattern of
 interlocking keys and doors, tessellating in queasy spirals.

 You don't feel a need to adorn yourself with the rug.


 You can't quite see that, at least as described.


 The rug is much too cumbersome to fit in the refresher.


 That's not going anywhere.


 The refresher dial has two settings, contained and uncontained. It is
 currently set to contained.


 You turn the dial to uncontained and the whole device starts to hum
 with purpose.


 The gourd is cooked, with the top end sliced through to make a lid,
 which is open, revealing some kind of mince inside. It's a regular
 yellow gourd, and has the letters 'XVII' scratched into one side.


 That's already open.


 You close the refresher.


 You close the gourd.


 The refresher is a small transparent box that sits on the counter and
 hums constantly. It's a common sight in kitchens, used for
 rejuvenating food that has turned bad. When <span class="floydstyle i">activated</span>, it can
 restore food to whatever state it was in three days prior to use. It's
 currently closed.

 There's a panel at the back for finer calibrations.


 On the back of the refresher there's a compartment for the lead rod
 that powers the device, a small dial for changing the time setting and
 an activation switch to activate the device. Imprinted on the panel
 are the words "CONSULT MANUAL FOR DIAL CONFIGURATIONS".

 The whole panel is shaking now the machine is set to be uncontained.


 The refresher is activated by pressing the small switch embedded in
 one side.


 Your finger hovers at the base of the activation switch, but you know
 the refresher won't work when there's nothing in it.


 You can't quite see that, at least as described.


 You open the refresher.


 You know the refresher won't work when there's nothing in it.


 The gourd is cooked, with the top end sliced through to make a lid.
 It's a regular yellow gourd, and has the letters 'XVII' scratched into

 I don't understand that verb.

 One of the counters is a cooling slab that keeps chilled anything left
 on it, this one has a gourd on it.


 One of the counters is a cooling slab that keeps chilled anything left

 You can feel the cold as you move your hand near.


 You risk it falling apart in your spindly appendages if you pick it
 up. The best you could do is open up its little lid.


 While the rug could fit on some things, the cooling slab isn't one of
 them.


 (with your attuning set)
 You run the attuning set lightly over the cooling slab but the lead
 rods barely even shimmer; it doesn't need attuning to you.

 (with your attuning set)
 You run the attuning set lightly over the rug but the lead rods barely

 A brief look around shows that there really is nothing here that yet
 requires attuning.


 You don't need to clean the gourd.


 You have robust digestive faculties, but there is no need to eat that.

 post-comp release.

 Feel free to type HELP or REVIEW for hints and a list of your current
 progress with the secrets.

>review

 You need to put the household asleep before you can explore any
 further. Throwing the somnuliser in the kitchen should do the trick,
 but you'll have to take steps to avoid being caught by the spores.

>throw somnuliser

 You throw the somnuliser softly at the ground and it clicks open,
 silently loosing invisible sleeping spores. Best make haste!

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 You know that the spread of the spores from the somnuliser must be
 gaining on you quickly: at this rate you doubt you could make it
 across the greenhouse.

 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 Hard green fruit bodies hang from the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is crinkled and grey with mould. The plant bed is thick with
 spindleweed.

>go east

 You've nearly reached the sliding door when you feel a gentle soothing
 spreading through your limbs. <span class="floydstyle em">Too late</span>, you think dimly as
 you stifle a yawn.


 You gently lower yourself to the ground, involuntarily but as if it
 were the most natural thing in the world, to be found by Confessor
 Destine's guards the next morning.

 [Undoing to just before you threw the somnuliser.]

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a closed leathery red door bars the way
 west into the rest of the house.

>examine somnuliser

 The somnuliser works as a small bomb. If thrown, it emits spores of
 untraceable potentiality, making it praeternaturally likely that
 anyone coming into contact with the spores will fall asleep with the
 firm belief that their sleepiness is natural and unnotable. It has but
 one use, but once activated its spores should propagate through halls
 throughout the entire house, slowed only as it seeps under the doors.

>put somnuliser in refresher

 You put the somnuliser into the refresher.

>take somnuliser

 As you take the somnuliser you spare a passing thought for all the
 things that have passed through your appendages to be stashed or
 stowed or forgotten about, thousands of medium sized dry goods
 disappearing into your past.

>inventory

 You are wearing:
   your llama-suit

 You are carrying:
   the somnuliser
   a rug
   the attuning set
   a Winkerchief

>examine rug

 The rug is a thick slab of carpet with a beguiling pattern of
 interlocking keys and doors, tessellating in queasy spirals.

>search rug

 The act of looking under a rug requires the rug to be on the ground,
 for it is only then that the rug reaches its full potential in
 concealing.

>drop rug

 Dropped.

>look under rug

 You pull back the rug and the ground underneath is sucked into its
 weave, revealing a bone ladder leading down into dark depths below.

>go down

 You put a tentative foot on the third rung down of the slender bone
 ladder beneath you. Through your invisible body, you stare down into
 the darkness below, slowly descending. The bones creak as if their
 long dead owners were there to complain. Taking one step at a time you
 arrive safely at the bottom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wine Cellar</span>
 Three brick walls of the wine cellar are lined with racks, burgeoned
 with bottles. The western wall is bare. The bone ladder leads back up
 to the kitchen.

>examine bottles

 Thousands of bottles line the rack, no doubt organised by some arcane
 system. Most are coated in a thick layer of dust.

>go west

 (first opening the brick wall)
 You give the wall a light shove but it doesn't yield.

>go east

 It doesn't look like you can go that way.

>take bottles

 The bottles are dusty, precariously stacked, and their ordering is
 unknown and so are best not to touch.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wine Cellar</span>
 Three brick walls of the wine cellar are lined with racks, burgeoned
 with bottles. The western wall is bare. The bone ladder leads back up
 to the kitchen.

>search wall

 The bricks in the middle of the western wall are grouped in a pattern
 of five bricks across by four down, etched into the bricks are the
 letters A to T in alphabetical order, like so:

 -----------------------------------------
 |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |   E   |
 -----------------------------------------
 |   F   |   G   |   H   |   I   |   J   |

 |   K   |   L   |   M   |   N   |   O   |
 -----------------------------------------
 |   P   |   Q   |   R   |   S   |   T   |
 -----------------------------------------

>inventory

 You are wearing:
   your llama-suit

 You are carrying:
   the somnuliser
   the attuning set
   a Winkerchief

>oh!

 I don't understand that verb.

>go up

 You stare up at the small square of light above. The bone is cold and
 clammy in your pellucid grasp. You lift yourself up and the bones seem
 to bend under your weight. For a moment you think the ladder might be
 falling backwards but it holds and soon you are up in the kitchen once
 more.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a closed leathery red door bars the way
 west into the rest of the house.

 Clashing with the kitchen's decor is an ugly square rug, peeled back
 to reveal the space below.

>throw somnuliser

 You throw the somnuliser softly at the ground and it clicks open,
 silently loosing invisible sleeping spores. Best make haste!

>look under rug

 The sleep powder is designed to act silently, to send occupants into
 unconsciousness without them knowing, but as you're struck by the
 sudden urge to sleep you know it's wholly explicable.


 You gently lower yourself to the ground, involuntarily but as if it
 were the most natural thing in the world, to be found by Confessor
 Destine's guards the next morning.

 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

>examine tree

 In the centre of the round greenhouse is a great grosvair tree, its
 shaggy fur hanging in rugose strips from the calcified trunk.

 The hayberry bush is dead, rotting on the soil. Large white flowers
 blossom on the banberry shrub. Tiny sprouts of spindleweed are
 growing.

>examine hayberry

 The plants in the greenhouse grow and die in a rapid cycle, proceeding
 through all possible stages of their life endlessly due to the lead
 enriched soil.

 The hayberry bush is bare, its leaves small and its branches stubby.
 Hard red berries hang like droplets from the banberry shrub. The
 spindleweed leaves are long and thin.

>examine berries

 The plants in the greenhouse grow and die in a rapid cycle, proceeding
 through all possible stages of their life endlessly due to the lead
 enriched soil.

 Small yellow flowers blossom across the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is covered in dozens of black obloid berries. The spindleweed
 stalks have grown higher and the leaves broader.

 enriched soil.

 Hard green fruit bodies hang from the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is crinkled and grey with mould. The plant bed is thick with
 spindleweed.

>go up

 If you climbed the tree, you would have nowhere to go from there.

 The hayberry bush is laden with bright red round berries. The banberry
 shrub is a small sapling. The spindleweed is in thin yellow strands.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blue Rose Garden</span>
 The Blue Rose Garden is comprised of a single rose bush grown to
 magnificent proportions. Its offshoots form a prickled boundary,
 enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow. From a
 rockery in the centre of the garden, from which all the offshoots
 stem, is the core bush and from it grows a pristine bouquet.

 The Destine mansion rises up to the west. A maze of flowers are
 reflected in the tooth-glass dome of the greenhouse, its sliding door
 almost completely flush with the unpanelled pane.

>throw somnuliser east

 (first ignoring unnecessary text "east")
 No, if you throw it out here it'll just disperse out harmlessly.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 Small yellow flowers blossom across the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is covered in dozens of black obloid berries. The spindleweed
 stalks have grown higher and the leaves broader.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a closed leathery red door bars the way
 west into the rest of the house.

 Clashing with the kitchen's decor is an ugly square rug, peeled back
 to reveal the space below.

>throw somnuliser

 You throw the somnuliser softly at the ground and it clicks open,
 silently loosing invisible sleeping spores. Best make haste!

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 You know that the spread of the spores from the somnuliser must be
 gaining on you quickly: at this rate you doubt you could make it

 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass

 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 The hayberry bush is dead, rotting on the soil. Large white flowers
 blossom on the banberry shrub. Tiny sprouts of spindleweed are
 growing.

>go east

 You've nearly reached the sliding door when you feel a gentle soothing
 spreading through your limbs. <span class="floydstyle em">Too late</span>, you think dimly as
 you stifle a yawn.


 You gently lower yourself to the ground, involuntarily but as if it
 were the most natural thing in the world, to be found by Confessor
 Destine's guards the next morning.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a closed leathery red door bars the way
 west into the rest of the house.

 Clashing with the kitchen's decor is an ugly square rug, peeled back
 to reveal the space below.

>put somnuliser in cooling slab

 The gourd fills the slab, leaving little room for other things.

>examine refresher

 The refresher is a small transparent box that sits on the counter and
 hums constantly. It's a common sight in kitchens, used for
 rejuvenating food that has turned bad. When <span class="floydstyle i">activated</span>, it can
 restore food to whatever state it was in three days prior to use. It's
 currently open.

 There's a panel at the back for finer calibrations.

>put somnuliser in refresher

 You put the somnuliser into the refresher.

>close refresher

 You close the refresher.

>examine panel

 On the back of the refresher there's a compartment for the lead rod
 that powers the device, a small dial for changing the time setting and
 an activation switch to activate the device. Imprinted on the panel
 are the words "CONSULT MANUAL FOR DIAL CONFIGURATIONS".

 The whole panel is shaking now the machine is set to be uncontained.

>examine dial

 The refresher dial has two settings, contained and uncontained. It is
 currently set to uncontained.

>examine bomb

 The somnuliser works as a small bomb. If thrown, it emits spores of
 untraceable potentiality, making it praeternaturally likely that
 anyone coming into contact with the spores will fall asleep with the
 firm belief that their sleepiness is natural and unnotable. It has but
 one use, but once activated its spores should propagate through halls
 throughout the entire house, slowed only as it seeps under the doors.

>examine lead

 There's a closed hatch under the panel.

>open hatch

 You open the lead compartment, revealing a power rod.


 Do you mean:


>examine blue door

 An open blue door stands between the kitchen and the greenhouse. The
 wood is slightly tainted by the decades of greasy fumes.

>examine red door

 The door is formed of a single rigid strip of red leather,
 unmistakably from a letter-beast. The door is currently shut.

>open blue door

 That's already open.


 An open blue door stands between the kitchen and the greenhouse. The
 wood is slightly tainted by the decades of greasy fumes. On closer
 inspection you note that the blue colour of the door is made up of
 thousands of tiny interlocking painted blue roses, each slightly
 different from all the rest.

>examine blue roses

 An open blue door stands between the kitchen and the greenhouse. The
 wood is slightly tainted by the decades of greasy fumes. Staring
 further at the tiny roses, you note that each tiny rose is made up of
 a number of small lines.

 themselves small roses, each different from the rest.

>examine power rod

 The power rod of the refresher takes up half of its compartment and it
 hums slightly with the potent power of lead.

>take rod

 The internal lead rod is partially fused with the refresher itself and
 cannot be removed. The space around the rod is empty, perhaps to leave
 room to install additional rods.

>examine dial

 The refresher dial has two settings, contained and uncontained. It is
 currently set to uncontained.

 The refresher ceases its vibrating as you turn the dial back to
 contained.

 are the words "CONSULT MANUAL FOR DIAL CONFIGURATIONS".

>activate switch

 There's no clear way of activating the activation switch.

>turn switch

 You can't turn the activation switch.

>switch switch

 It isn't something you can switch.

>activate refresher

 (first closing the lead compartment)
 You turn the refresher on and there's a brief flash of light which
 must come from the particles which clang to the somnuliser. Looking
 inside, you see the somnuliser.

>turn dial

 You turn the dial to uncontained and the whole device starts to hum
 with purpose.

 Banquet Hall the last revellers are taking ether and
 barely-enfranchised cousins are plotting in a distant drawing room.
 But here this wing is quiet. A long slope curves up round the chamber,
 looping several times. A closed bone white door leads west and an open

 You've never heard of this Confidante Destine, though with hundreds of
 the Destine clan in just the other wings of the mansion, this is
 perhaps no great surprise.

 There are many great menageries in the plains: the Swinery, the
 Pleasure Gardens of Leaguer Mel, Eyefort Maze... this is not one of
 them. Confessor Destine has little taste in either selection or
 arrangement. The open bone door leads east.

 Unfortunately, most of the 'menagerie' is made up of stuffed exhibits.
 You get the impression that the Confessor liked the idea of having a
 menagerie more than he liked the idea of actually owning and caring
 for live animals.

 First the visitor is greeted by a pile of hay in an empty stall, where
 the pellucid llama once lived.

 Then they see a worried looking bird mumbling to itself in a cage.

 Finally, at the back of the room, they see a glass chamber swarming
 with shiny black beetles.

>examine hay

 A large pile of loose hay, fairly fresh, sits in a stall.
 Pellucid-llamas greatly prefer eating nuts and berries to grass, but
 will eat it if there's truly nothing else.

>search hay

 You root through the hay, but you can't find anything. You have to
 spend a few moments placing strands of hay back on the pile lest you
 leave them littered through the house.

>examine bird

 The quailer is a nervous looking brown bird that shivers every few
 moments as it talks endlessly to itself. Every few moments it pecks
 fruitlessly at the banberry stones that litter its cage.

>take banberry stone

 (first ignoring unnecessary text "banberry stone")
 What do you want to take?

>f x chamber

 You can't quite see that, at least as described.

>examine glass

 You can't quite see that, at least as described.

>examine beetles

 On closer inspection, the beetles are more like very dark blue and
 they flit across the chamber disinterestedly.

>take beetle

 (the beetle chamber)
 The chamber is much too big for you to lug around.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Tower</span>
 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal
 wing of the house. The north door leads off into other wings of the
 mansion where other members of the Destine clan live and work. A long
 slope curves up round the chamber, looping several times. An open bone
 white door leads west and an open red door east.

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a leathery red door opens the way west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 The hayberry bush is dead, rotting on the soil. Large white flowers
 blossom on the banberry shrub. Tiny sprouts of spindleweed are
 growing.

>examine banberry

 The plants in the greenhouse grow and die in a rapid cycle, proceeding
 through all possible stages of their life endlessly due to the lead
 enriched soil.

 The hayberry bush is bare, its leaves small and its branches stubby.
 Hard red berries hang like droplets from the banberry shrub. The
 spindleweed leaves are long and thin.

>take banberries

 You pluck one of the berries from the banberry shrub as they sprout
 before you.

 Small yellow flowers blossom across the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is covered in dozens of black obloid berries. The spindleweed
 stalks have grown higher and the leaves broader.

 down before starting a different litany.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blue Rose Garden</span>
 The Blue Rose Garden is comprised of a single rose bush grown to
 magnificent proportions. Its offshoots form a prickled boundary,
 enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow. From a
 rockery in the centre of the garden, from which all the offshoots
 stem, is the core bush and from it grows a pristine bouquet.

 The Destine mansion rises up to the west. A maze of flowers are
 reflected in the tooth-glass dome of the greenhouse, its sliding door
 almost completely flush with the unpanelled pane.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Walkway</span>
 As you arrive at the top of the slope, you reflect that a secret is
 only a secret if someone is invested in keeping it one. If the
 Confessor is a man who becomes more comfortable in his position, you
 would expect him to have fewer secrets as the years go on. But perhaps
 he is a man for whom past indiscretions, explainable at the time,
 become hardened into the unspeakable as the years make his past
 motives less explicable.

 From the downward slope at the edge of the tower a narrow stone
 walkway juts out, a long drop on either side. On its western end, a
 closed purple door leads into the master bedroom, and on its eastern
 end a closed orange door leads into the library.

 A stone plinth in the shape of a down-turned dagger is the only
 furniture here, and the ceiling mural is the only decoration.

>examine mural

 Across the ceiling is a diorama depicting the procession of the plains
 through the different ages. The Golden Age of plenty when gods walked
 the plains. The Silver Age of long childhood summers and bitter
 heresy. The Bronze Age of monsters and heroes. The Iron Age of
 technological wonder and endless strife. And now, the Age of Lead,
 where all that has come will come again and all that might be will be.
 In the centre is the symbol of the Sinuan Theocracy, whose reason for
 being is to prevent the cycle of the Ages from recommencing.

>examine plinth

 On the top of the stone plinth is an indent in the shape of a dagger.
 It's empty. On the edge of the hilt is what appears to be a coat hook.

 Looking at the plinth close up, you notice set into it is a small

 the uncontained dial setting, only three days. Looking inside, you see
 a parchment.

>take parchment

 (first opening the refresher)
 You take the parchment. The parchment, perfectly reformed as it was
 precisely three days before, is a letter which reads:

 BURN AFTER READING

 Grey news, Confessor. I caught Assenter Cur sniffing around
 Beningnell's old office in the Holy Chambers. He asked if I had a copy
 of the Strictures of Forgetting. I think he knows, or at least
 suspects, what we have done. Send advice soon.

 The Confessor is definitely hiding something here, but what? The name
 "Beningnell" sounds familiar but you can't quite place it. This bears
 further investigation.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Tower</span>
 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal
 wing of the house. The north door leads off into other wings of the
 mansion where other members of the Destine clan live and work. A long
 slope curves up round the chamber, looping several times. An open bone
 white door leads west and an open red door east.

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Walkway</span>
 From the downward slope at the edge of the tower a narrow stone
 walkway juts out, a long drop on either side. On its western end, a
 closed purple door leads into the master bedroom, and on its eastern
 end an open orange door leads into the library.

 A stone plinth in the shape of a down-turned dagger is the only
 furniture here, and the ceiling mural is the only decoration.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 The library is a cramped room cluttered with bookcases that barely
 leave room for the armchair and the fireplace. Distant city light
 streams through the open curtains. The open orange door leads west,
 opposite the closed window on the east side of the room.

 You can see a pile of dust here.

>examine bookcases

 The bookcases have been shoved together precariously, leaning on one
 another for support. Each bookcase is labelled in a script comprised
 of interwoven azure flowers and thorny stalks. The labels are the
 seven eternal categories: damp, forgotten, implausible, pejorative,
 exhaustive, unsettling and beseeching.

>examine forgotten

 Do you mean:


>examine 4

 The spine reads, <span class="floydstyle em">Strictures of Forgetting</span> by <span class="floydstyle em">a forgotten</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">writer</span>.

>read 4

 (first taking Strictures of Forgetting)
 You open up Strictures of Forgetting.

 The Strictures of Forgetting is a ritual that can be performed by two
 determined individuals. The effect of this ritual is to uncanonise
 someone or something targeted by the ritual. Once uncanonised the
 target is considered not only to no longer exist but also to have
 never existed. This technique is forbidden except by a majority
 decision in the Holy Chamber.

 A cold shiver runs through you: the Confessor must have used the
 Strictures of Forgetting with the accomplice that wrote to him to
 uncanonise someone... but who, and why?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 The master bedroom of the Destine mansion is smaller than you'd
 expected: it only has twelve chandeliers. In the centre of the
 polished wooden floor is a round bed on which is the sleeping figure
 of Confessor Destine himself.

 Tucked beside the bed is an unseemly bedside table. Opposite the open
 door east to the corridor is an open watercloset.

>examine confessor

 Confessor Destine is a tall thickset male human. He is solely
 responsible for holding the secrets of every believer in Sinua,
 including his own. He is currently fast asleep buried in the silks,
 wearing his ceremonial pyjamas and a dagger belt. He's lying on his
 stomach, breathing slowly.

>wake up confessor

 You imagine the shock on his face were you to wake him... it'd be
 worth a lot but not seventeen years of planning.

>examine pyjamas

 The pyjamas are finely woven, plush, and thankfully all-encompassing.
 You imagine they're buttoned up, but it's impossible to tell while the
 Confessor is lying on his front.

>examine belt

 It's a simple cloth sheath attached to a belt. The part that holds his
 dagger is trapped under his sleeping form.

>examine dagger

 For reasons unapparent, the dagger is made of solid gold and as such
 appears neither sharp nor valuable. Etched into the blade are the
 words "Confessor Destine".

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 In the centre of the polished wooden floor is a round bed on which is
 the sleeping figure of Confessor Destine himself.

 Tucked beside the bed is an unseemly bedside table. Opposite the open
 door east to the corridor is an open watercloset.

>examine table

 The table beside The Confessor's sleeping couch is shaped like a fist
 clutched around a larynx. Your throat tightens reflexively just
 looking at the table.

 Sitting on the table is a bowl.

>examine bowl

 It's a bowl made from a twice-fused skull of an emutant. Aside from
 being tactless and ugly, it is smeared with unidentified grey remains
 of a second dinner.

 Inside the bowl is a substance scanner.

 The substance scanner is a slim brass wand. A display made from liquid
 crystals is embedded in one side.

 It's a huge round bed covered in layers of silk and velvet. Confessor
 Destine slumbers alone in its centre.

>examine watercloset

 The open closet appears to be made of sickly chrome alloy, squatting
 jaundiced in an alcove of the room.

 The closet is full of inscrutable holes and nozzles for human
 functions. You were given to believe that it is usually polite to
 leave a watercloset closed, unfortunately such a minor flaw doesn't
 count as a secret to hold against the Confessor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse Roof</span>
 You struggle through the window onto Greenhouse roof, mentally making
 a note to close it up with the curtains before you escape back through
 the intersection. As you enter into the cool night air, something
 about the Confessor strikes you. As odious as the man is, as a
 Confessor he is without fault: he has not left a single trace of
 anyone else's secrets but his own.

 You stand on the apex of the perfectly reflective dome embedded in the
 side of the Destine mansion. The blue rose garden lies below you to
 the east. If you squint at the night, you can just about make out the
 intersection that leads back to the Mambling Plains.

 To your west is the open window to the Confessor's library, through
 which you can see the open curtains.

>exits

 The dome itself is formed of smooth tooth-glass and it reflects the

 The scanner flickers up PORT. Nothing unusual there. And then, moments
 later, it flickers LEAD. Only the Doge is permitted to so potent a
 draught as lead-sweetened port. This will be awkward for the Confessor
 to explain in the Holy Chamber.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Tower</span>
 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal
 wing of the house. The north door leads off into other wings of the
 mansion where other members of the Destine clan live and work. A long
 slope curves up round the chamber, looping several times. An open bone
 white door leads west and an open red door east.

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

 She sleeps against the door, drooling only mildly. Her suit of armour
 is so long and heavy it actually appears to be propping her upright.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Walkway</span>
 From the downward slope at the edge of the tower a narrow stone
 walkway juts out, a long drop on either side. On its western end, an
 open purple door leads into the master bedroom, and on its eastern end
 an open orange door leads into the library.

 A stone plinth in the shape of a down-turned dagger is the only
 furniture here, and the ceiling mural is the only decoration.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 In the centre of the polished wooden floor is a round bed on which is
 the sleeping figure of Confessor Destine himself.

 Tucked beside the bed is an unseemly bedside table. Opposite the open
 door east to the corridor is an open watercloset.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 The library is a cramped room cluttered with bookcases that barely
 leave room for the armchair and the fireplace. Dim city light filters
 through the crack in the curtains. The open orange door leads west,
 opposite the closed window on the east side of the room.

>examine bookcases

 The bookcases have been shoved together precariously, leaning on one
 another for support. Each bookcase is labelled in a script comprised
 of interwoven azure flowers and thorny stalks. The labels are the
 seven eternal categories: damp, forgotten, implausible, pejorative,
 exhaustive, unsettling and beseeching.

 I don't understand that verb.

>go east

 (first opening the window)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse Roof</span>
 You stand on the apex of the perfectly reflective dome embedded in the
 side of the Destine mansion. The blue rose garden lies below you to
 the east. If you squint at the night, you can just about make out the
 intersection that leads back to the Mambling Plains.

 To your west is the open window to the Confessor's library, through
 which you can see the closed curtains.

>go down

 Sitting on the edge of the dome, you slide yourself down into the
 garden below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blue Rose Garden</span>
 The Blue Rose Garden is comprised of a single rose bush grown to
 magnificent proportions. Its offshoots form a prickled boundary,
 enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow. From a
 rockery in the centre of the garden, from which all the offshoots
 stem, is the core bush and from it grows a pristine bouquet.

 The Destine mansion rises up to the west. A maze of flowers are
 reflected in the tooth-glass dome of the greenhouse, its sliding door
 almost completely flush with the unpanelled pane.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 Small yellow flowers blossom across the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is covered in dozens of black obloid berries. The spindleweed
 stalks have grown higher and the leaves broader.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a leathery red door opens the way west
 into the rest of the house.

 Clashing with the kitchen's decor is an ugly square rug, peeled back

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

>examine paintings

 Firstly the bronze framed picture: Framed by bronze leaf is a diorama
 of the Chief Destine, founder of his clan. In the painting he is a
 wearing a purple cloak and wielding an ornate dagger that is touched
 up against an egg of purest lead. In the background is a surprised
 looking goose.

 Then the iron framed picture: In the painting, the Confessor himself
 is standing regally in his purple cloak. On one shoulder, eating out
 of a raised palm, is a young quailer.

 And finally the silver framed picture: This is a painting of a young
 woman with a distinctive smile. She is dressed for the Hex wars, with
 a swine-net and a mace. The title underneath the portrait reads:
 Confidante Destine.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Menagerie</span>

 Unfortunately, most of the 'menagerie' is made up of stuffed exhibits.

 the pellucid llama once lived.

 Then they see a worried looking bird mumbling to itself in a cage.

 Finally, at the back of the room, they see a glass chamber swarming

 The quailer is a nervous looking brown bird that shivers every few

 fruitlessly at the banberry stones that litter its cage.

 You pop the berry into the quailer's mouth and it gulps it straight
 down before starting a different litany.

 "Are you listening bird?" snuffles a low swine voice faithfully
 recorded by the quailer. "Good, so Confessor, you may wonder why you
 have no llama now. Heh heh, Sow 17 is why. I got out, didn't you know?
 I know it was you that stitched us. Don't try looking for llama, I ate
 her. Time you hear this I be long gone. Heh, heh.".

 Yes, that's definitely Sow 17's voice. Surely the Confessor would have
 heard that by now? But then, he hadn't wiped the record. Maybe he

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Tower</span>
 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door

 in which the great curse-stone monument of Never More Unseen was
 toppled using a thoroughly starched python as the lever, a hypnotised
 pygmy elephant as the fulcrum, with the younger members of the
 monastery forming a human pyramid from which the abbot could stand.
 The final chapter is made up geocultist ravings about the impossible

 The entry for Confessor Destine spans several pages but the section on
 his early life before Confessordom has been blacked out. Through the

>look up beningnell

 Beningnell was the fictitious title holder of the Confessordom for at
 least thirty years before Grover Destine nobly convinced the Theocracy
 that Beningnell had in fact never existed. Prior to this, he was
 considered to be a quiet figure who had the good fortune of being both
 invisible and incorporeal. How this non-person came to be Confessor is
 unknown but the revelation of his non-existence was the key factor in
 Grover Destine's ascension to the title of Confessor.

 It all seems so clear now. Confessor Beningnell was a real person,
 although he may well have been invisible and incorporeal: some of the
 best people are. Grover Destine, eager for his position, performed the
 Strictures of Forgetting on Beningnell, uncanonising him, erasing his
 existence. Worse than simply killing the Confessor, he made it so he
 had never truly existed. This must be the Confessor's most dangerous
 secret.

 From feet to appendages to head, your form is completely covered by a
 thin-weave suit made wholly from the wool of the pellucid llama. It
 renders you undetectable to all the senses that matter, including your

 Only the greatest of hunters can track down and capture a pellucid
 llama. They are invisible and silent, they emit no scent and move too
 fast to be easily touched. Fortunately for you, the greatest of
 hunters are rarely the best treasure-keepers. You had three pellucid
 llamas rustled from the pleasure gardens of Leaguer Mel, who's
 life-work was the capturing of a herd from the outskirts of the
 Boundless Plains. The rustlers (Carminative Brown, Sow 17, and
 She-Who-Regrets) believed the plan was their own and even saved you
 the trouble of the shearing. Each of them inevitably were found by
 Leaguer Mel's probability-hounds, along with the rustled llamas. But
 you fleeced the fleeces from them long before then.

 You open up The Last Days of The Red Letter.

 This slim volume tells of the downfall of a famous letter-beast in the
 Divergent Plains. The letter-beast laid claim to the Plains, marking
 out edges with his endless burgundy tail. Like all letter-beasts, he
 sublet his territory in exchange for victuals and favours. His
 downfall came by the cleaving points of the Knights Linear. The book
 describes their first encounter:

 "I will lease you all the land that you could possibly need, fair
 Knights, or I am not a letter-beast!" said the Red Letter, with
 sincerity uncommon in his kind.
 "We accept your word as it stands," said the Knights Linear evenly.

 But the Knights' need was great and in their attempts to halt the
 machinations of the Leminscaters they needed much land to grow lead
 groves. Soon all the land they'd let from the Red Letter had been
 filled and yet their lead rod requirements were nowhere near met.

 "What can I do for you, fine and fair knights?" asked the Red-Letter,
 smiling with all his sincere mouths and frowning with all his
 insincere mouths.
 "Letter-beast," said the Knights Linear, "our need is greater than the
 land that you have let us."
 The Red Letter opened his mouths for making deals and closed his
 mouths for making idle talk. "Even knights, I could easily let you
 more land for an appropriate price."
 "You misunderstand," said the Knights, "you said that you would lease
 us all the land that we could possibly need or you are not a
 letter-beast. Our need has outstripped the land that you have leased
 us, and yet you are still a letter-beast."

 And so, of course, the Knights Linear were entitled by their creed to
 undo any breakers of oaths. Upon that day they bisected the great
 beast and took all his land, evicting all other tenants and selling
 his great hide in millions of rectangular strips. Though the Knights
 Linear had merely acted justly, they gained the unearned favour of all
 other letter-beasts, who always rejoice when one of their kind is
 felled, and the unsurprising enmity of what was to become known as the
 Divergent Diaspora: a collective formed by many of the Red Letter's
 landless former tenants who mark their old landlord's demise each year
 with renewed vows to destroy the Knights Linear.

 description of events in the novel, such that only the most dedicated
 and unhinged of literary analysts could discover the true meaning of
 the work.

>examine 6

 The spine reads, <span class="floydstyle em">Songs and Codes</span> by <span class="floydstyle em">Bore Boar 44</span>.

>read 6

 (first taking Songs and Codes)
 You open up Songs and Codes.

 The book details the shameful practice of embedding secret codes into
 songs, whether revealed when played backwards or deciphered from
 stressed syllables. While disapproving, the work goes into some
 considerable detail on the mapping of the initial letters of
 individual syllables in a song line to letters in code grids. The
 danger here being that songs can be transmitted unwillingly between
 people once they stick in minds, and so messages may be spread through
 seemingly innocent ditties that secretly function as ciphers and
 crypto-mnemonics.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse Roof</span>
 You stand on the apex of the perfectly reflective dome embedded in the
 side of the Destine mansion. The blue rose garden lies below you to
 the east. If you squint at the night, you can just about make out the
 intersection that leads back to the Mambling Plains.

 To your west is the open window to the Confessor's library, through
 which you can see that there are no curtains.

>go down

 Sitting on the edge of the dome, you slide yourself down into the
 garden below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blue Rose Garden</span>
 The Blue Rose Garden is comprised of a single rose bush grown to
 magnificent proportions. Its offshoots form a prickled boundary,
 enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow. From a
 rockery in the centre of the garden, from which all the offshoots
 stem, is the core bush and from it grows a pristine bouquet.

 The Destine mansion rises up to the west. A maze of flowers are
 reflected in the tooth-glass dome of the greenhouse, its sliding door
 almost completely flush with the unpanelled pane.

>go east

 You have no desire to get lost in the Confessor's gardens.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 The hayberry bush is laden with bright red round berries. The banberry
 shrub is a small sapling. The spindleweed is in thin yellow strands.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a leathery red door opens the way west
 into the rest of the house.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Tower</span>
 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal
 wing of the house. The north door leads off into other wings of the
 mansion where other members of the Destine clan live and work. A long
 slope curves up round the chamber, looping several times. An open bone
 white door leads west and an open red door east.

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

>drop rug

 Dropped.

>look under rug

 You pull back the rug and the ground underneath is sucked into its

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Menagerie</span>
 Confessor Destine has little taste in either selection or arrangement.
 The open bone door leads east.

 Unfortunately, most of the 'menagerie' is made up of stuffed exhibits.

 First the visitor is greeted by a pile of hay in an empty stall: the
 housing for a pellucid llama.

 Then they see a worried looking bird mumbling to itself in a cage.

 Finally, at the back of the room, they see a glass chamber swarming
 with shiny black beetles.

>drop rug

>drop rug

 Dropped.

 The hayberry bush is dead, rotting on the soil. Large white flowers
 blossom on the banberry shrub. Tiny sprouts of spindleweed are
 growing.

>look under rug

 You pull back the rug and the ground underneath is sucked into its
 weave, revealing soil and roots, nothing out of the ordinary.

 The hayberry bush is bare, its leaves small and its branches stubby.
 Hard red berries hang like droplets from the banberry shrub. The
 spindleweed leaves are long and thin.

>take rug

 You lift up the rug entirely and a hole appears briefly underneath it
 before disappearing.

 Small yellow flowers blossom across the hayberry bush. The banberry
 shrub is covered in dozens of black obloid berries. The spindleweed
 stalks have grown higher and the leaves broader.

 With a quick intake of breath you quickly shimmy down the bone ladder.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wine Cellar</span>
 Three brick walls of the wine cellar are lined with racks, burgeoned
 with bottles. The western wall is bare. The bone ladder leads back up
 to the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon</span>
 You find yourself in a damp cavern strewn with aged trash that extends
 out into darkness. You know it's a dungeon by all the dangling
 manacles. The opening in the brick wall leads back east to the wine
 cellar.

 Lying among the detritus is a pristine white skull.

 Discarded on one side is a huge sack of gold coins.

 The skull is human and complete, and has very pointy teeth, but beyond

 With the full weight of the cloak upon your back, you touch the tip of

 lighter in your grasp as the coins, staying the same size, grow duller

 The refresher is a small transparent box that sits on the counter and
 hums constantly. It's a common sight in kitchens, used for
 rejuvenating food that has turned bad. When <span class="floydstyle i">activated</span>, it can
 restore food to whatever state it was in three days prior to use. It's
 currently open.

 Inside the refresher is a skull.

 There's a panel at the back for finer calibrations.

 The substance scanner is a slim brass wand. A display made from liquid
 crystals is embedded in one side.

 It is a spent hull, but a potent reminder that something may be amiss.


 The set is a twist of lead rods that can be used to <span class="floydstyle em">attune</span>

>examine panel

 On the back of the refresher there's a compartment for the lead rod
 that powers the device, a small dial for changing the time setting and
 an activation switch to activate the device. Imprinted on the panel
 are the words "CONSULT MANUAL FOR DIAL CONFIGURATIONS".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 The hayberry bush is laden with bright red round berries. The banberry
 shrub is a small sapling. The spindleweed is in thin yellow strands.

 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal

 mansion where other members of the Destine clan live and work. A long
 slope curves up round the chamber, looping several times. An open bone
 white door leads west and an open red door east.

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

>examine paintings

 Firstly the bronze framed picture: Framed by bronze leaf is a diorama
 of the Chief Destine, founder of his clan. In the painting he is a
 wearing a purple cloak and wielding an ornate dagger that is touched
 up against an egg of purest lead. In the background is a surprised
 looking goose.

 Then the iron framed picture: In the painting, the Confessor himself
 is standing regally in his purple cloak. On one shoulder, eating out
 of a raised palm, is a young quailer.

 And finally the silver framed picture: This is a painting of a young
 woman with a distinctive smile. She is dressed for the Hex wars, with
 a swine-net and a mace. The title underneath the portrait reads:

 What makes a toad unsightly isn't its texture or croak, for that much

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Menagerie</span>
 Confessor Destine has little taste in either selection or arrangement.
 The open bone door leads east.

 Unfortunately, most of the 'menagerie' is made up of stuffed exhibits.

 First the visitor is greeted by a pile of hay in an empty stall: the
 housing for a pellucid llama.

 Then they see a worried looking bird mumbling to itself in a cage.

 Finally, at the back of the room, they see a glass chamber swarming
 with shiny black beetles.

 don't appear to be interested in the eyes though.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Tower</span>
 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal
 wing of the house. The north door leads off into other wings of the
 mansion where other members of the Destine clan live and work. A long
 slope curves up round the chamber, looping several times. An open bone
 white door leads west and an open red door east.

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blue Rose Garden</span>
 The Blue Rose Garden is comprised of a single rose bush grown to

 enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow. From a
 rockery in the centre of the garden, from which all the offshoots
 stem, is the core bush and from it grows a pristine bouquet.

 Subsea is a bright blue rock found at the bottom of the ocean. This

 floor and ground into a fine powder and from there used to make blue
 dyes.

 Subsea is a blue dye! The Confessor has a pot of blue dye beneath his
 famous rose garden, that's why they're blue! No, more than that, the
 symbol of the Destine clan, the blue rose itself, is a lie.

 You stand on the apex of the perfectly reflective dome embedded in the
 side of the Destine mansion. The blue rose garden lies below you to
 the east. If you squint at the night, you can just about make out the
 intersection that leads back to the Mambling Plains.

 To your west is the open window to the Confessor's library, through
 which you can see the closed curtains.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 The library is a cramped room cluttered with bookcases that barely
 leave room for the armchair and the fireplace. Dim city light filters
 through the crack in the curtains. The open orange door leads west and
 the open window reveals the greenhouse roof to the east.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Walkway</span>
 From the downward slope at the edge of the tower a narrow stone
 walkway juts out, a long drop on either side. On its western end, an
 open purple door leads into the master bedroom, and on its eastern end
 an open orange door leads into the library.

 A stone plinth in the shape of a down-turned dagger is the only
 furniture here, and the ceiling mural is the only decoration.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entry Tower</span>
 A tall round chamber, the reception room for The Confessor's personal
 wing of the house. The north door leads off into other wings of the
 mansion where other members of the Destine clan live and work. A long
 slope curves up round the chamber, looping several times. An open bone
 white door leads west and an open red door east.

 Along the walls are three paintings, framed in silver, bronze and
 iron.

 The Confessor's guard slumbers in her ornate iron armour by the door
 leading north to the rest of the mansion.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Bedroom</span>
 In the centre of the polished wooden floor is a round bed on which is
 the sleeping figure of Confessor Destine himself.

 Tucked beside the bed is an unseemly bedside table. Opposite the open
 door east to the corridor is an open watercloset.

 You can also see a pile of dust here.

 You stand on the apex of the perfectly reflective dome embedded in the
 side of the Destine mansion. The blue rose garden lies below you to
 the east. If you squint at the night, you can just about make out the
 intersection that leads back to the Mambling Plains.

 To your west is the open window to the Confessor's library, through
 which you can see the closed curtains.

>go east

 Sitting on the edge of the dome, you slide yourself down into the
 garden below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Blue Rose Garden</span>
 The Blue Rose Garden is comprised of a single rose bush grown to
 magnificent proportions. Its offshoots form a prickled boundary,
 enclosing the garden. At precise intervals, blue roses grow. From a
 rockery in the centre of the garden, from which all the offshoots
 stem, is the core bush and from it grows a pristine bouquet.

 The Destine mansion rises up to the west. A maze of flowers are
 reflected in the tooth-glass dome of the greenhouse, its sliding door
 almost completely flush with the unpanelled pane.

 You can also see a brass pot here.

>take rug

 You lift up the rug entirely and a hole appears briefly underneath it
 before disappearing.

>go east

 You have no desire to get lost in the Confessor's gardens.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Greenhouse</span>
 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 The hayberry bush is dead, rotting on the soil. Large white flowers
 blossom on the banberry shrub. Tiny sprouts of spindleweed are
 growing.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a leathery red door opens the way west
 into the rest of the house.

 You drop the rug.

 You've now found all seven deceits of Confessor Destine. Now all that

 leaving through the intersection.

>put sack in refresher

 It's always preferable to clean out refreshers before reusing to avoid
 cross-contamination.

>open refresher

 That's already open.

>examine refresher

 The refresher is a small transparent box that sits on the counter and
 hums constantly. It's a common sight in kitchens, used for
 rejuvenating food that has turned bad. When <span class="floydstyle i">activated</span>, it can
 restore food to whatever state it was in three days prior to use. It's
 currently open.

 Inside the refresher is a red smear.

 There's a panel at the back for finer calibrations.

>examine smear

 A copper-coloured stain that smells of iron. It cakes the bottom of
 the refresher.

>clean smear

 (with the Winkerchief)
 You scour the inside of the refresher with your winkerchief, soaking
 up the red stain until the device is as pristine as it was before.

>put coins in refresher

 You put the sack of lead coins into the refresher.

>close refresher

 You close the refresher.

>turn on refresher

 The light flashes, signalling that the sack of lead coins within has
 aged, despite the uncontained dial setting, only three days. Looking
 inside, you see a sack of gold coins.

>take coins

 Taken.

>close refresher

 You close the refresher.

>look under rug

 You pull back the rug again, revealing a bone ladder leading down into
 dark depths below.

>go down

 With a quick intake of breath you quickly shimmy down the bone ladder.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wine Cellar</span>
 Three brick walls of the wine cellar are lined with racks, burgeoned
 with bottles. The western wall has swung ajar. The bone ladder leads
 back up to the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Confessor Destine's personal kitchen is small: certainly less than
 half an acre of countertops. In the centre, by the refresher, is a
 heating stove and a cooling slab. An open blue door leads into the
 greenhouse to the east, whilst a leathery red door opens the way west
 into the rest of the house.

 The greenhouse of the Destine mansion is a tooth-glass dome. The glass
 reflects back the light and heat of a microscopic sun that slowly
 orbits a huge grosvair tree. A variety of plants grow, bloom and die
 on a long plant bed.

 On the east of the greenhouse an open sliding door leads back out to
 the rose garden. An open blue door leads west into the house.

 The hayberry bush is dead, rotting on the soil. Large white flowers
 blossom on the banberry shrub. Tiny sprouts of spindleweed are
 growing.

 You stand on the apex of the perfectly reflective dome embedded in the

 intersection that leads back to the Mambling Plains.

 To your west is the open window to the Confessor's library, through
 which you can see the closed curtains.

>close window

 You close the window.

>enter intersection
 You step through the intersection and after a long walk through mud,
 you change your outfit in the next plain, and then again in the next,
 shedding cover identities like second skins as you move your way
 towards the centre of the plains: to the city of Sinua.

 When you arrive you are who you once were, the Orloger, a theocrat
 with an obsolete role whose absence from the Chamber was surely not
 missed. You declare that you will be leading the next session to
 Assenter Cur who doesn't appear surprised at your sudden arrival.

 Within the hour you are standing before the Holy Chamber, dozens of
 theocrats" eyes upon you, the Confessor himself sitting in the centre.

 "Murder, pig-eating, heresy and usurpation," you begin. "These are the
 charges I level at Confessor Destine."

 A wave of shock ripples across the theocrats. You lay before your
 peers the seven deceits of Confessor Destine, each time raising your
 voice above the outraged cries of the crowd. Throughout, the Confessor
 remains silent, coldly assessing you.

 "But do not take my word," you say, "search the Destine mansion and
 there all the evidence you will find.

 "Search all you like, you will find nothing of the sort," the
 Confessor says with a slither of a smile. You suspect he discovered
 his home was broken into and took steps to conceal what might have
 been discovered.

 And right enough, no evidence of serious ill-doing was found although
 he had no time to procure a new llama and the rose cuttings taken
 turned white when grown elsewhere. While still the Confessor, all
 trust in Destine had eroded and a faction installed his absent
 grandfather the Doge as head of the clan.

 And as for you? Your position in the Theocracy is no longer tenable,
 sneakthieves are not untrusted no matter their motives. As they drive
 you out the chamber you cast your eyes across Sinua: if it takes
 seventeen more years, you will be back and back for good.

 Telling someone's secret always reveals two people. To speak these
 deceits in front of an assembly of theocrats would be to reveal
 yourself as a sneakthief. It would be your own undoing as well as the
 Confessor's.

 Confident that Destine would be none the wiser about your break in,
 you take a few months planting seeds of doubt through proxies. You
 leave dossiers on the desks of rival family members and leak libellous
 details to pamphleteers in Sinua. You are in the chamber dressed as an
 Orloger, your first skin. Beningnell's illicit uncanonising has just
 been discovered through forensic continuity rituals and Cecil Destine
 has confessed to his part in it in exchange for banishing to the Hex
 lands. The Confessor's face is haggard, worn down by the burden of the
 last few months.

 "All in favour of appointing a new Confessor?" calls Boar Bore 44. The
 chamber is unanimous.

 "I veto!" shouts the Confessor.

 "Veto this!" cries the Bore, goring him with his left tusk, rending
 him unfit to practice. The Confessor grasps his side as he is dragged
 screaming from the chamber.

 In the fallout none are blameless and all suspect all of conspiring
 with Destine. None are blameless, that is, except for you who have
 been absent from the chamber all these years. Within the month you are
 chosen as the new Confessor, which was your goal all along...
>press space
 A year later you sit in your booth, listening to a confession.

 "I am not Confessor Destine," says the voice behind the screen, "I no
 longer have that title. My clan has cast me aside, I no longer bear
 that name. I am nameless and I am leaving and I will stop at
 <span class="floydstyle em">nothing</span> to bring you down."

 But you leave nothing unconsidered.

 "You are not leaving for you never were to begin with," you say as you
 signal to Assenter Cur across the chamber and pull out a copy of the
 Strictures of Forgetting...

 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last

>reveal
 Congratulations on leaving no trace. Throughout the game there are
 multiple hints that the protagonist is not a human. They are in fact a
 giant ant with opposable digits, best known in the theocracy as the
 Orloger. Their role in the theocracy was to count the turning of the
 ages (to prevent the Lead Age from ending and a Golden Age from
 arising). Since the Theocracy of Sinua successfully prevents the ages
 from turning (by way of various rituals), the Orloger doesn't have an
 active role. Like any theocrat, they can submit and vote on measures
 in the Holy Chamber; but like most, there's not much expectation that
 they actually will (in part due to the power the Confessor has over
 proceedings with his power of veto). As such, they can get away with
 being absent for decades on end without anyone really noticing.

 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last
 command or REVEAL the full identity of the protagonist?
