 "Oh, Julia! Where did you learn that?" Keith whispers breathlessly.

 All tongue and fingers, he kisses the milky skin above your breasts,
 while your hands slide their way up and down his sculpted chest, so
 eager with lust that your watch occasionally snags on a stray chest
 hair. Your lips, glistening like two fresh strawberries laced with dew,
 hungrily roam across his neck. And your hips! Well, that's better left
 to the imagination.

 Normally, you wouldn't even consider seeing Keith at Pine Meadows, but
 Frank's in Boston and won't be back until tonight's banquet.  And when
 the cat's away...

 Just then, a low shelf wedges itself in to your back, jarring you from
 your reverie. That's when you hear it.

 A click. A flash. The tell-tale tapping of heels on concrete.

 Sting of the Wasp
 Interactive Damage-Control

 Release 1 / Serial number 040622 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11

 The next few minutes are a blur.  Keith juts his tongue down your
 throat, but, without you reciprocating, it feels like he's searching
 for cavities. The rhythms of your body no longer coincide with his. In
 fact, the only rhythm left in your body is the pounding of your heart,
 the warm throbbing of blood in your ears. He must notice your
 discomfort as soon he backs off and starts buttoning his shirt.

 "Well, I gotta get back to the Pro Shop, babe,"  he says, grabbing his
 shades. "Stop by later." With that, he takes off down the hall, leaving
 you, still stunned, slumped against the wall.

 Utility closet
 This is the first time you've been in this closet, and hopefully it
 will be the last. Keith assured you that no one ever comes down here.
 And now you can see why.  The concrete walls are oppressively close,
 made more so by the smell of bleach and chemicals coming from a filthy
 shelf against the far wall. Various brooms clutter the room, displaying
 none of the pleasant tidiness characteristic of the rest of Pine
 Meadows. All this can be escaped through a door to the south.

 Tossed to the side in the throes of passion, your bag, a fabulous Louis
 Vuitton original, lays on the ground.

>examine bag
 A Louis Vuitton original, your purse can practically carry anything,
 which comes in handy but is absolute hell when you have to find your
 keys.

>examine me
 Your lipstick is smeared, your cheeks are flushed, and your mascara is
 running. At least the fact that your blouse is open should draw
 attention away from your face.

>button blouse
 You hastily button up your blouse, careful not to break a nail.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your watch (being worn)
   your ensemble (being worn)

>fix makeup
 Using your compact, you carefully apply your makeup, adding a little
 more powder than usual to your cheeks to hide the flush.

>examine ensemble
 Nothing but the best for you.  Pumps from Prada, skirt by Yves Saint
 Laurent, a gorgeous silk blouse from the much-coveted Vera Wang
 collection.  Too bad it'll all have to be replaced in two weeks.

>take bag
 Taken.

>open bag
 That's already open.

>look in bag
 In the Louis Vuitton bag are your make-up and a pair of banquet
 tickets.

>examine watch
 Frank felt so guilty after spending a month in Tokyo that he bought you
 this. Honestly, you enjoyed the time apart, but that didn't stop you
 from playing up the guilt. So far, that little ploy has gotten you a
 mink stole, a diamond necklace, and a Bentley, but this watch takes the
 cake. Whoever said that flagrant displays of wealth were tacky must not
 have seen this. Exquisitely crafted from platinum and diamonds, the
 only downfall this watch has is that the gems tend to obstruct your
 view of its face, making it somewhat difficult to read the actual time.
 Still, it's a small price to pay to be seen sporting such a piece.

>examine time
 Looking closely at your watch, you see that it is sometime before five.

>examine makeup
 Survival gear for the modern woman; you never leave home without it.

>examine brooms
 Do people even still use these things? They're so dirty and
 utilitarian. Like those who use them, you suppose.

>take broom
 Brooms are for witches, and despite accusations to the contrary, you
 are not one.

>examine walls
 There's nothing special about the walls.  Except that they're unadorned
 concrete, a rarity in Pine Meadows.

>examine pumps
 Nothing but the best for you.  Pumps from Prada, skirt by Yves Saint
 Laurent, a gorgeous silk blouse from the much-coveted Vera Wang
 collection.  Too bad it'll all have to be replaced in two weeks.

>examine me
 Pure dynamite! Not bad for twenty thousand. Your ass is high, your
 tummy is tight, and your skin hasn't a line or blemish. It's a shame
 you'll have to do it all over again in a year. Oh well, no one said
 beauty was easy.

>go south

 Access hall
 A short, dimly lit hallway between the utility closet to the north and
 the stairs to the rest of the club leading south and up. While the
 dominant smell here is, as in the closet, chlorine, some other
 fragrance, a sweeter one, is mingled with it.

>smell
 Turning up your nose ever so slightly, you sniff the air.  Although it
 is almost entirely wiped out by the smell of chlorine, you definitely
 detect the hint of something.  Chanel #5?  Dior Addict Eau Fraiche?
 Something. Whoever it was now has you in quite an awkward position, and
 likely a picture of the same. If only you had something to put you back
 on top.

>xyzzy
 Nothing happens. Guess if you want to travel someplace exotic, you'll
 have to do it the old-fashioned way and sleep with Frank.

>go south
 The stairs turn sharply north as you ascend.

 Western wing
 This is the newest addition to Pine Meadows, built to house the new spa
 to the west. In stark contrast to the well-lit, tan stucco walls, a
 dingy concrete stairwell descends to south.  To the north, a rather
 uninspired doorway leads to the office of the club manager. The hall
 itself extends to the east.

>go east

 Foyer
 Putting the club's best foot forward is clearly the purpose of the
 foyer. A stately crystal chandelier scatters daylight into
 kaleidoscopic patterns. Two verdant plants stand next to a set of
 double doors to the north, their leaves extended as if to usher people
 in to the banquet hall. To the south, next to the exit to the gardens,
 is a bulletin board. The hall continues to the west and east.

>undo. n.
 You can't see any such thing.

>go north
 You can't, since the door to Charles's office is in the way.

>open door
 It seems to be locked.

>knock
 What do you want to knock on?

>knock on door
 There's no reply. Charles must be out.

>smell
 Whatever smell is there is overpowered by your characteristic
 fragrance: Self-Obsession, by Calvin Klone.

>go west

 Spa lobby
 Pine Meadows's most recent addition, the spa was built during the
 natural beauty craze of the late nineties, when holistic was in and
 plastic surgery was out. Frankly, you never could understand why it was
 so popular. The smell of damp seaweed and aromatherapy float in from
 the south, where the actual spa lies. To the north and west, with a
 functionalism that seems out of place next to the distinctively modern
 architecture of the spa, are the women's and men's change facilities,
 respectively.

 The crowning achievement of some hack designer, a desk, dominates the
 room, trying to give some sense of purpose to the poor soul whose job
 it is to man it.

 Desperately trying to look important, a receptionist peers down a
 hawkish nose at a log book, scribbling in corrections at a furious
 speed.

 Desperately trying to look important, the receptionist peers down a
 hawkish nose at a log book, scribbling in corrections at a furious
 speed.

>examine desk
 A stainless steel and mahogany monstrosity, the desk reflects the
 gentle light coming in through the skylight. Surprisingly, or maybe not
 seeing as the spa's popularity has fallen with plastic surgery's
 resurgence, there is no computer on the desk; its job instead being
 done by a simple log book.

>examine log book
 The client list for Pine Meadows Spa, it contains the names and locker
 information, as well as "beauty profiles," of practically every full
 member, part member, and former member of the club. If you want to find
 anyone in particular, you'll have to look them up individually.

>look up me in log book
 "I'm sorry Mrs. Hawthorne, but that is confidential," she says, "If
 you've forgotten your combination you can ask me."

>examine receptionist
 Tall, thin, and oh so Madison Avenue, the spa receptionist serves as a
 living advertisement for her business's services. And like most
 advertisements, she grossly misrepresents the truth. Her looks come
 from the tried and true: surgery, make-up, and anorexia. Not the herbal
 wraps and mud baths she pushes on her customers.

>ask receptionist about combination
 "Could you please tell me my locker combination?" you ask, trying to be
 as pleasant as possible.

 "One moment, Mrs. Hawthorne," she says, flipping through the log book.
 "Yes, it's right here. Locker #11, combination 38-25-34."

>ask receptionist about beauty profile
 "I'm really very sorry Mrs. Hawthorne, but I am incredibly busy," she
 says in a questionably trendy accent.

>show watch to receptionist
 You better watch out: people knowing about you and Keith is enough for
 them to think you're a Democrat. If you start giving things to the
 working class, it'll only look worse.

>ask receptionist about logbook
 "I'm really very sorry Mrs. Hawthorne, but I am incredibly busy," she
 says in a questionably trendy accent.

>take logbook
 You can't see any such thing.

>take log
 That belongs on the desk.

>go west
 "Umm, Mrs. Hawthorne?" the receptionist says, giving you an odd look.
 "That's the men's change room."

 You mumble something about allergies and come back to the lobby.

>smell
 Oh that's a nice blend: kelp and sandalwood. Really now, if you wanted
 to vomit you would just make love to Frank.

>examine time
 Looking closely at your watch, you see that it is sometime before five.

>go north

 Women's change room
 Your heels click loudly on the tiles, echoing down the banks of lockers
 that line the sides of the room. With the pool closed until summer and
 tennis verging on the passé, the only use the women of Pine Meadows
 have for this room is the lockers. The showers lie, unused, to the
 north.

 Your locker, #11, sits against the left wall.

>open locker
 (your locker)
 38 left, 24 right, 34 left, just like your measurements. Inside is a
 change of clothes.

>examine clothes
 While the thought of changing without your vanity desk and six angled
 mirrors is by no means appealing, you've kept a spare set of clothes in
 your locker since last year when Frank spilled red wine all over you.

>take clothes
 Besides from a little sweat, your ensemble is in good condition.
 There's no need to change right now.

>search clothes
 You find nothing of interest.

>search locker
 (your locker)
 In your locker is a change of clothes.

>close locker

 The crowning achievement of some hack designer, a desk, dominates the

 it is to man it.

 Looking east and not seeing a flock of members coming to use the spa,
 the receptionist sighs and drops her shoulders a little.

>go south
 "I'm sorry, Mrs. Hawthorne, but there is a pilates class until five,
 you'll have to wait until then," the receptionist says.

 Exquisitely crafted from quartz and brass, the chandelier has a stately
 charm reminiscent of Romanov Russia, before the rabble rose with all
 their drab olives and fireless reds.

>examine plants
 Normally you aren't all that fond of plants, but these two have a
 subdued elegance that you find pleasing.

>search plants
 You find nothing of interest.

>smell plants
 Whatever smell is there is overpowered by your characteristic
 fragrance: Self-Obsession, by Calvin Klone.

>examine board
 Although seemingly impossible, somehow this cork bulletin board, with
 its oak border and brass inlay, manages to appear elegant. I guess all
 it takes to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear is money. A fact
 illustrated by many of Pine Meadows's patrons. On the bulletin board is
 an announcement.

>read announcement
 This note announces the charity banquet going on tonight. It's supposed
 to be the gala event of the season and, as such, you bought your
 tickets months in advance. The doors open at six-thirty followed by the
 "Opening speech by Julia Hawthorne; Philanthropist of the Year" at
 quarter to seven. The donation seemed like a good idea at the time but
 with all that's happened today, you're kind of regretting it.

>go east
 You make your way through the east wing to the garden path.

 Garden path
 Serving as little more than a junction, the path here leads from the
 garden in the southwest to the outside dining area in the north and
 northeast. The club itself lies to the west and the tennis court to the
 east. To the southeast is the pool, but it is closed for the season.

>se
 The pool is closed for the season.

>smell
 Ugh, that's what roses smell like? Where's the benzaldehyde? the
 phenetol?

>go east

 Tennis court
 Since tennis became passé, this court is mainly used by those few
 members who actually enjoy the game. In fact, due to the reduced use,
 the club has even begun letting non-members play on it. You've never
 been that fond of tennis and with the rabble about, you're loath to
 even stay on the court. Hardly a big loss. The net droops, the benches
 are peeling, and the rubber floor sticks to your pumps. Although you
 are fenced in on most sides, thankfully, you can still leave to the
 more agreeable outside dining areas to the northwest and north, or the
 garden path to the west.

 Beverly Winters, a long time member of the club, hops from foot to
 foot, waiting for a ball to come out of a serving machine at the other
 end of the court.

 Barely turning, Beverly starts talking. "Well, hello, Julia," she says,
 still not facing you. "Tonight's banquet should be interesting. No?"

 In a strangely crude move, Beverly shifts her bra uncomfortably.

>examine machine
 Once top of the line, the serving machine has seen better days. Its
 turning mechanism has broken, so now it just shoots out balls at the
 same speed and same course every time. Good for Beverly's score, bad
 for everyone else.

>smell
 Whatever smell is there is overpowered by your characteristic
 fragrance: Self-Obsession, by Calvin Klone.

>smell beverly
 The smells of antiperspirant and sweat battle it out over Beverly.
 Unfortunately the antiperspirant is winning.

>examine beverly
 Just a couple of years your senior, Beverly joined the club a few
 months before you. This was back in the prime of Pine Meadows, before
 the computer boom, before the stock market became a playground for
 anyone with a couple thousand, before peasant blouses and the anti-fur
 movement; those were the days. Back then, the only thing to do was
 engage in dramatic rivalries. And what a rivalry you formed. Playful at
 first, it soon degenerated in to a spat worthy of the Hatfields and
 McCoys, that is if the two of you were troglodytic mountain folk. After
 dying down for a couple of years, the rivalry flared up again when you
 caught her flirting with Frank at one of last year's charity auctions.
 Normally you would have been happy to have his hands occupied for a few
 hours, but the insult was too great to ignore.

>examine net
 The net droops, and your spirits with it. It's fashioned from cheap
 rayon, not the delicate silk it was made of back when you used to play.
 You feel trapped just looking at it.

 Beverly pauses between serves, tucking her hair behind her ears.

>examine bra
 Beverly's chest looks lumpier than usually.

>search bra
 Beverly's chest looks lumpier than usually.

>ask beverly about bra
 "Oh dear, Beverly," you say, glancing at her chest, "you're not going
 to let your surgeon get away with that, are you?"

 She says nothing but shifts her bra again.

 Beverly smacks a ball across the court.

>take bra
 Beverly wouldn't appreciate that.

>take beverly's eyes
 I only understood you as far as wanting to take the bra.

>fix Beverly's chest
 Beverly wouldn't appreciate that.

 Beverly smacks a ball across the court.

>examine benches
 The only thing sadder than playing a sport that's passed its prime is
 watching a sport that's passed its prime. Judging from the thick layer
 of grime on the benches, it seems that the people of Pine Meadows might
 not be as sad as you thought.

 Beverly smacks a ball across the court.

>examine floor
 (the floor)
 Soft with the heat, the rubber floor of the tennis court sticks to your
 heels, leaving little impressions after your steps.

 Beverly pauses between serves, tucking her hair behind her ears.

>ask beverly about frank
 "You haven't seen Frank in a while, have you?"

 "No I haven't. How is your husband, anyway? We have so much catching up
 to do."

 In a strangely crude move, Beverly shifts her bra uncomfortably.

>ask beverly about keith
 "I guess you know about Keith and I,"

 "Oh yes, I heard about that. Poor Frank. Of course, he'll never believe
 any of the gossip. Unless someone shows him proof..."

 Beverly smacks a ball across the court.

>punch beverly
 You two prefer more subtle ways of expressing your rivalry.

 Beverly smacks a ball across the court.

>ask beverly about photo
 "Someone took a photo of Keith and I in the basement."

 "A photograph, you say? How very Enquirer of you."

>accuse beverly
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask beverly about lump
 "Really, Julia. Sometimes you are such a whore," Beverly mutters.

 "What was that?"

 "I said: 'Really, Julia. Sometimes you are such a bore.'"

 Beverly pauses between serves, tucking her hair behind her ears.

>distract beverly
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>yell
 (Beverly)
 Beverly isn't afraid of you.

 In a strangely crude move, Beverly shifts her bra uncomfortably.

>show watch to beverly
 "Really, Julia. Why would anyone be interested in that?"

 Beverly pauses between serves, tucking her hair behind her ears.

>examine time
 Looking closely at your watch, you see that it is sometime before five.

>point machine at beverly
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>pull hair
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine machine
 Once top of the line, the serving machine has seen better days. Its
 turning mechanism has broken, so now it just shoots out balls at the
 same speed and same course every time. Good for Beverly's score, bad
 for everyone else.

>examine mechanism
 You can't see any such thing.

>fix machine
 You would achieve nothing by this.

>go north

 Outside dining (next to the Pro Shop)
 This is what it's all about: stale food and staler gossip. However,
 despite all that, the outside dining offered by Pine Meadows is really
 the only thing that interests you at the club. The tables are full; the
 place is busy. The members don't seem to be eating all that much
 though, no doubt saving their appetites for the banquet tonight. To the
 west is the server's entrance to the kitchen where all manner of food
 is prepared. The dining area extends to the east, and to the south and
 southeast are the garden path and tennis court respectively.

 A group of women sit here playing bridge and chatting.

 "Beep beep" My God! Digital watches at Pine Meadows? Cartier must be
 rolling over in his grave.

 Cynthia Fordham, a woman whose wrath makes even you cringe, sits in a
 high back chair.

 Apparently someone lacked the willpower to stick to their diet, as a
 bowl of half-eaten salad sits on the table, forgotten.

 "I told you, I ordered Coquille Saint Jacques half-an-hour ago. What
 are you, deaf?" Cynthia screams at a cowering waiter who then flees to
 the safety of the kitchen.

 Just then, she glances over to you. "Oh, there you are, Julia," she
 says, her voice dripping with saccharine venom. "I hear you have a way
 with the help." --she winks, a little too obviously-- "Perhaps you
 could work your charm on that waiter for me."

>examine salad
 Little more than limp, wilted lettuce leaves and sour vinegar, the
 salad looks like it was picked at slightly, and then discarded. Nice
 way to spend twelve bucks.

 Amongst the lettuce is a pair of cucumber slices.

 "So I was up at the golf course and do you want to know what I heard
 Roger say?" one of the bridge players says dramatically.

 "No," another replies, "but I'm sure you'll tell us anyway."

>take cucumber
 Taken.

 "He said 'No grandson of mine is going to be a doper.' And then he
 disowned him," the first one says, waiting for a gasp. When she sees
 none is forthcoming, she continues, "I mean, it was just a little pot,
 nothing to freak out over."

 The second rolls her eyes incredulously. "Really, now. Why don't you
 just stop shaving your legs and move to British Columbia already?"

>examine cucumber
 Just two round slices of cucumber, about the size of silver dollars.

 "She was in the basement?" one asks, horrified.

 "I guess that's what passes for courting among the help," says another.

>smell
 Whatever smell is there is overpowered by your characteristic
 fragrance: Self-Obsession, by Calvin Klone.

 "Still, you'd think she'd be a little more discrete. I mean Frank's
 only been gone for a day."

 "Personally, I think she wanted to get caught. She always has enjoyed
 the limelight."

>slap woman
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask cynthia about roger
 "Really, Julia, can't we talk about something a little more
 interesting?".

 "Oh well. Did you see what Cissy was wearing?"

 "How could you miss it?"

>ask cynthia about keith
 "So you must have heard and Keith and I."

 "Well, yes. I know a woman must have her hobbies," Cynthia says
 coquettishly. "It's a shame yours will destroy your marriage."

>ask cynthia about photo
 "Have you heard anything about a photo today?"

 "Oh yes, I heard someone took a picture of you. What a shame."

>ask cynthia about beverly
 "How do you feel about Beverly?"

 "She's a little manipulative, even for my tastes."

>smell beverly
 You can't see any such thing.

>smell cynthia
 Careful not to look like a bloodhound, you raise your nose and sniff
 delicately. Amidst the smells of wine and food, you detect the faint
 scent of Bellagio. Definitely not the scent from hall.

>take salad
 "Come now, Julia," Cynthia clucks. "I heard Frank cut up your platinum
 card, but must you really resort to taking leftovers?"

 You ignore her and take it.

>ask cynthia about cissy
 "What do you think of Cissy?"

 "I'm just glad she's not talking to me."

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>dump salad on cynthia
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put salad on cynthia
 Putting things on Cynthia would achieve nothing.

 "Frankly," she pauses, thinking herself the funniest person in the

 he's a bad dresser. He's not even that rich."

 How dare she. Sure the first part is true, but not rich? What is she
 suggesting, you married out of love?

 A waiter bustles about, tray of wine glasses in hand, trying
 desperately to keep up with drink orders from demanding patrons.

 Oh great, Cecilia Winnecott is here, the most frightfully irritating
 woman you have ever had the displeasure to meet. You attempt to duck
 out before she sees you but it's too late.

 "Yoohoo, Julia! Over here." As if you could miss her. Her bright
 fuchsia pantsuit practically sears your retinas. Cissy sashays up to
 you, her jacket barely able to contain those three Danishes you saw her
 wolf down this morning.

 A hundred-eighty pound woman packed in a hundred-sixty pound Chanel
 reject. You've got to hand it to her though, all that fuchsia really
 does detract from what it covers.

 "Oh, Julia. It's been ages. You simply must see our pictures from
 Tuscany," she says, and before you can decline, she pulls a stack of
 photos from her purse.

>examine photos
 Why does anyone think people want to see their pictures? Well, since
 you're looking, I guess that's a stupid question.

 "Here's my eldest, Tyler, isn't he handsome?" Cissy croons, showing you
 a photo of a rather dirty little boy with a finger up his nose.

>get photo
 You can see them as much as you like from here, which isn't much at
 all.

 "Oh ooh, here's Madison. Isn't she darling?"

 "She's absolutely breathtaking," you say.

>search photos
 You find nothing of interest.

 "And this is our villa, isn't it just to die for?"

 Frankly, you agree. You'd die before setting foot in such a dismal
 little hovel.

>smell cissy
 Your nose is overrun with both Dolce and Gabbana.

 "Aww, look at little Aidan. Isn't he a treasure?"

 My God, doesn't this woman ever stop breeding?

>ask cissy about cynthia
 "So what do you think of Cynthia?"

 "She's a dreadful gossip, that woman." Cissy leans in a bit closer,
 "Who, by the way, is going back for another collagen treatment in a
 week."

>ask cissy about beverly
 "What do you think of Beverly?"

 She shudders. "Ugh, don't mention that horrible woman to me."

 Cissy recently found out all the bad things Beverly says behind her
 back. Fortunately, she thinks Beverly is the only one who says them.

>smell cissy
 Your nose is overrun with both Dolce and Gabbana.

 Cissy continues to prattle on about her oh so fascinating life.

>ask cissy about outfit
 Cissy has the memory span of a goldfish. Unless it was related directly
 to what she's talking about, she would forget her own name.

>ask cissy about frank
 "What do you think of Frank?"

 "Oh, you've got yourself a keeper there. He really does worship the
 ground you walk on."

 You must admit: that's nice. It makes him all the easier to walk all
 over.

>ask cissy about keith
 "I suppose you've heard about Keith and I."

 "Oh, that. Well, I wasn't going to bring it up; it's vulgar, really.
 Besides, I don't believe a word of it."

>ask cissy about photos
 You subtilely feel Cissy out about the photo, but she doesn't get it.

 "They're spectacular, aren't they? I took them all myself," she says,
 admiring a blurry photo of what looks to be an ape, or her husband.

>ask cissy about kids
 You make a passing comment about her kids.

 "Children are an absolute treasure, aren't they?" she says, looking at
 her photos fondly. "Really Julia, you simply must have one one of these
 days."

 Any thought you ever had of having a child went up in smoke after
 seeing her 'charming' brood.

>ask cissy about banquet
 You mention the banquet to Cissy.

 "Oh yes, you have that speech as Philanthropist of the Year, don't you?
 Really, Julia, you are such an inspiration. You could really teach
 these nouveaus," she glances around the dining area disdainfully, "a
 thing or two about noblesse obligé."

 Where does she get off with that tone? Her family made its money from
 inventing the egg carton.

>ask cecilia about egg carton
 "Didn't your family make its money in egg cartons?"

 "Well you know my great-grandfather, Sir Arthur Chesterbald Winnecott,
 invented them, right? Oh he was a brilliant man."

 Cissy proceeds to relate to you how the modern egg-carton evolved
 through a series of steps. First in boxes, then in little cardboard
 cups, and finally the styrofoam ones we've grown to know and love.
 Somehow, through the magic that is Cissy, she manages to make it more
 boring than you thought possible.

>ask cissy about receptionist
 Cissy has the memory span of a goldfish. Unless it was related directly
 to what she's talking about, she would forget her own name.

 Tuxedoes aren't active wear, and the waiter exemplifies perfectly why
 this is so. His cummerbund prevents him from turning his waist; his
 whole ensemble clings to him with sweat. In fact, his bow tie seems so
 tight that his eyes bug out and his face is flushed.

 Cissy continues to prattle on about her oh so fascinating life.

>ask cissy about gossip
 "I suppose you've heard about Keith and I."

 "Oh, that. Well, I wasn't going to bring it up; it's vulgar, really.
 Besides, I don't believe a word of it."

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go west
 "Umm, Julia, hon. That's the kitchen," says Cissy, giving you a
 peculiar look. You can't blame her. Most people, if they want to
 complain, just scream at the waiters in front of everyone.

>undo
 Outside dining (next to the kitchen)
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go east

 "I'm dreadfully sorry, Cissy, but I have some things to do," you say,
 rubbing your temples in attempt to ward off the migraine you know is
 coming.

 "Ciao!" Please, one month in Tuscany and she thinks she's Monica
 Bellucci.

 Outside dining (next to the Pro Shop)
 This is what it's all about: stale food and staler gossip. However,
 despite all that, the outside dining offered by Pine Meadows is really
 the only thing that interests you at the club. The tables are full; the
 place is busy. The members don't seem to be eating all that much
 though, no doubt saving their appetites for the banquet tonight. To the
 west is the server's entrance to the kitchen where all manner of food
 is prepared. The dining area extends to the east, and to the south and
 southeast are the garden path and tennis court respectively.

 A group of women sit here playing bridge and chatting.

 Cynthia glares at the nouveaus surrounding her.

>ask cynthia about receptionist
 "Really, Julia, can't we talk about something a little more
 interesting?".

>ask cynthia about spa
 "Really, Julia, can't we talk about something a little more
 interesting?".

>ask cynthia about club manager
 "What do you think of Pine Meadows?"

 "It's a shame what's happened to the place," she says, almost
 wistfully. "Nouveaus." She rolls her eyes in the direction of the
 diners.

>ask cynthia about charles
 "What do you think of Charles?"

 "Really, Julia. The only thing worse than being a bore is talking about
 one."

>examine time
 Looking closely at your watch, you see that it is just after five.

>go southwest

 "Aww, leaving so soon? Well we must do this again sometime," Cynthia
 calls out after you.

 Garden path
 Serving as little more than a junction, the path here leads from the
 garden in the southwest to the outside dining area in the north and
 northeast. The club itself lies to the west and the tennis court to the
 east. To the southeast is the pool, but it is closed for the season.

>go southwest

 Garden
 Being this far out in the country, the garden is really the only place
 at Pine Meadows where nature exists, yet isn't out of control. The
 topiary is subtle, no garish animals or ambitious creations. Flowers
 line the drive to the south, down which the valet service lies. A path,
 hedged with rose bushes, curves round the club to the northeast, and
 the club itself lies to the north.

 Melissa Stratham, wife to Johnathan Stratham, sits here on a bench,
 delicately leafing through a paperback novel.

 As she sees you enter, she looks up and grins impishly. "Oh, Julia,"
 she says, closing her book for a moment. "I'm surprised to see you
 here. I thought you preferred to do your hoeing in the basement."

>smell melissa
 You raise your nose ever so slightly and sniff. Chanel #5, definitely
 the same as in the hall.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>ask melissa about frank
 "So what do you think of my husband?"

 "Well he will certainly spice up the banquet. He is going to be there,
 isn't he? It just won't be any fun without him."

>ask melissa about keith
 "I suppose you heard about Keith and I."

 "Oh that, you know how this place is. News spreads fast."

>ask melissa about photo
 "Have you heard of a certain photo making it about the club?"

 "Oh yes, I heard someone had taken a photo of you as you were,
 indisposed. There's just no privacy any more is there?"

>ask melissa about perfume
 "That's a charming fragrance, Melissa. Whatever is it?"

 "It's Chanel #5, do you like it?"

 "Well, no. But then again, I have taste," you reply snidely.

 "What were you doing in the basement? And don't deny it, it reeked of
 Chanel, just like you."

 "Really, Julia. This paranoia is most unbecoming. A lot of people wear
 Chanel #5," Melissa says, shifting in her seat slightly.

>examine book
 It's the latest Danielle Steel: something about a wealthy heiress and a
 stableboy.

>search julia
 You can't see any such thing.

>search melissa
 You're not a lady cop, and this isn't Cinemax After Dark.

>ask melissa about book
 "That's quite a book you have there."

 "Do you like it? I thought you might. It's about a wealthy heiress and
 her affair with the stableboy." She pauses, thoughtfully. "Hey, perhaps
 you could write your own. You know, update it for the modern world. I'm
 sure you have enough material."

>ask melissa about charles
 "That Charles is something else, isn't he?"

 "Don't get me started. That man is such a bore. I dread each time I
 have to pay my dues and listen to him speak."

>ask melissa about beverly
 "You've taken quite a shine to Beverly, haven't you?"

 "Well yes I have. It was so kind of her to take me under her wing. Now
 there's a woman who knows how to get what she wants."

>ask melissa about cynthia
 "What do you know of Cynthia?"

 "I'd watch your step around her. She's a sly one."

>ask melissa about cissy
 "My God, did you see what Cissy was wearing?"

 "Oh, that woman. She just does not know interesting photography.
 Cynthia on the other hand..." Melissa lets her words trail off
 deliberately.

>ask melissa about receptionist
 "Please, Julia. I'm trying to read." Melissa says, barely glancing up.

 topiary is subtle, no garish animals or ambitious creations. Flowers
 line the drive to the south, down which the valet service lies. A path,

 Melissa continues to read her book.

>examine flowers
 Hedges of rose bushes frame the sides of the path, their little pink
 flowers swaying in a cool breeze.

>go north

 Foyer
 Putting the club's best foot forward is clearly the purpose of the
 foyer. A stately crystal chandelier scatters daylight into
 kaleidoscopic patterns. Two verdant plants stand next to a set of
 double doors to the north, their leaves extended as if to usher people
 in to the banquet hall. To the south, next to the exit to the gardens,
 is a bulletin board. The hall continues to the west and east.

>go north
 The hall is closed until tonight's banquet.

>go west

 Western wing
 This is the newest addition to Pine Meadows, built to house the new spa
 to the west. In stark contrast to the well-lit, tan stucco walls, a
 dingy concrete stairwell descends to south.  To the north, a rather
 uninspired doorway leads to the office of the club manager. The hall
 itself extends to the east.

>knock on door
 There's no reply. Charles must be out.

>go west

 Spa lobby
 Pine Meadows's most recent addition, the spa was built during the
 natural beauty craze of the late nineties, when holistic was in and
 plastic surgery was out. Frankly, you never could understand why it was
 so popular. The smell of damp seaweed and aromatherapy float in from
 the south, where the actual spa lies. To the north and west, with a
 functionalism that seems out of place next to the distinctively modern
 architecture of the spa, are the women's and men's change facilities,
 respectively.

 The crowning achievement of some hack designer, a desk, dominates the
 room, trying to give some sense of purpose to the poor soul whose job
 it is to man it.

 The receptionist glances around and sighs.

>ask receptionist about herself
 "How are you today?" you ask, trying to be as nice as possible.

 "I'm fine. A little tired, but you know how it is."

 Is she actually suggesting you've ever looked tired? It's definitely
 time to see Dr. Rickers again.

>ask receptionist about beverly
 You ask about one of the spa patrons.

 "I'm sorry Mrs. Hawthorne, but the stylist-client relationship is one
 of strictest confidence."

 True, they are the priests and therapists of the new millenium.

>show salad to receptionist
 "I couldn't possibly. Too fattening," she says, waving the salad away
 with the bones she calls fingers.

>show cucumbers to receptionist
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a half-eaten salad
   a pair of cucumber slices
   your Louis Vuitton bag (which is open)
     your make-up
     a pair of banquet tickets

>go south

 Spa
 Just two years ago, this place would have been packed at this time of
 day. Now hardly anyone comes in here, and you can hardly blame them. It
 feels more like some hellish jungle than a spa. The smell is subtle but
 gnaws at you nonetheless. A bed of rocks, heated to drive up sweat and
 drive out impurities, gives the room a heavy, fevered feeling, making
 you wonder why they even bothered considering there is already a
 whirlpool to the south. For those club members who have given up on
 trying to hide the fact that they dye their hair, a hairdresser's
 station sits to one side, from which you have a clear view of the lobby
 and its desk to the north. And all this set to some "Sounds of Nature"
 CD. Already, your hair is going limp from all the humidity.

 Ms. Williams, face covered in mud, sits at the hairdresser's station
 waiting for her weekly colouring.

>examine williams
 (Ms. Williams)
 A fearsome sight, Ms. Williams has opted for a peculiar strategy in
 fighting the ravages of time: none. When she smiles, a rare event, the
 crow's feet (although ostrich might be more fitting by comparison) lace
 across her face like webs. If it weren't for her weekly dye job you
 might think she were over a hundred.

>smell williams
 (Ms. Williams)
 Mothballs and ribbon candy. Guess even money can't ward off the smell
 of the elderly.

>eat cucumber
 Half-eaten food isn't quite your idea of fine dining.

>give cucumber to williams
 (Ms. Williams)
 "I thought you could use some cucumber to complete your facial," you
 say, handing her the slices.

 "Oh thank you, Julia," Ms. Williams croons. "These will be perfect for
 my eyes. That idiot at the desk doesn't know half as much about beauty
 as you," she says, laying the slices on her eyes.

>examine rocks
 Heated by some unknown source, the rocks cause the air above them to
 shimmer like a mirage. On the floor beside the bed of rocks is a bucket
 of water.

>examine bucket
 Trying to capture some of the supposed ambience of colonial America,
 this bucket is constructed of well-fitted oak panels. Hooked on to the
 side of the bucket is a ladle.

 You plunge the ladle in to the bucket and pour the water on to the
 rocks. A loud hiss ensues as a cloud of steam fills the room.

 The jungle image is now complete as steam wraps its way around the
 plants, partially obscuring your vision.

 Ms. Williams, face covered in mud, sits at the hairdresser's station
 waiting for her weekly colouring.

>examine station
 An all-in-one sink, chair, and hair dryer, the hairdresser's station is
 a testament to the fact that the spa doesn't service enough people to
 get the standard banks of equipment that more profitable ones do. While
 in itself an adequate piece of equipment, you would rather have one
 machine do each job and do it right.

 On the brim of the sink rests a bottle of dye.

>ask williams about receptionist
 (Ms. Williams about that)
 "What's with that receptionist? Who does she think she is?"

 "I don't know, but she was supposed to be in here ages ago to do my
 hair."
 As fast as it appeared, the steam dissipates, allowing you to see
 clearly again.

>examine dye
 You would die before being caught putting this in your hair. As to
 whether you would actually put it in or not, only your stylist knows
 for sure.

 The whirlpool is currently occupied. Besides, if you wanted to lie in a

 The concrete walls of this closet are oppressively close, made more so

 can be escaped through a door to the south.

>pour bleach in dye
 With Ms. Williams's eyes covered by the cucumber slices, you make your
 way over to the sink and carefully pour some bleach in to the dye.

 Just then, the receptionist, who apparently doubles as the hairdresser
 with the spa's drop in popularity, comes in. "Ready for your colouring,
 Ms. Williams?"

 "Of course I am, I've been waiting for hours." Her voice grates on you
 as it scrapes out past her ancient vocal cords.

 "I am sorry about that, it's just we're so busy, and--."

 "Just get on with it, you don't get paid to talk."

 With that, the hairdresser goes about mixing the dye with some peroxide
 she brought with her (in addition to the liberal dousing of bleach you
 put in there) and puts it in Ms. Williams already fragile hair. For a
 few minutes it seems as though the bleach has no effect, but then, just
 as you're about the leave, you notice a few strands coming out in the
 hairdresser's hands until finally it starts coming out in goopy clumps.

 "What's going on up there?"

 "Uh, ah, I don't know. I used the same proportions as always."

 "You idiot!" the old crone shrieks, fishing a hand through what remains
 of her hair. "My hair! My hair!"

 The hairdresser apologizes profusely, leading Ms. Williams out with a
 towel on her head.

 This is the newest addition to Pine Meadows, built to house the new spa
 to the west. In stark contrast to the well-lit, tan stucco walls, a
 dingy concrete stairwell descends to south.  To the north, a rather
 uninspired doorway leads to the office of the club manager. The hall
 itself extends to the east.

>unlock door with key
 You unlock the door to Charles's office.

>go north
 You open the door and walk in.

 Office of the Registrar
 You haven't seen this room since you joined the club years ago. Frank
 handles all the dues, and Charles isn't your first choice among people
 to socialize with. The office itself seems to be a lot more luxurious
 than before. Maybe last time you were just distracted by the fear of
 your application being denied, or, more likely, Charles's perpetually
 tacky air just drained all the class out of the place. Either way, you
 have to say that now you like its bold charm, so unlike its owner.

 Clearly the focus of the layout, a magnificently restored antique oak
 desk stands near the back of the room, illuminated by a spacious window
 overlooking the golf course. Somewhat less impressive, a wise move
 considering they might detract from the desk, are a row of cabinets
 leading from the door to the south, along the wall, to the window at
 the far side of the room.

 Charles could come back any minute. Better make it quick.

>examine desk
 Absolutely gorgeous and without a scratch on it. Which is to be
 expected, seeing as very little work actually gets done at it. Most
 members have their banks automatically pay their dues for them and
 since country clubs have declined in popularity recently, new members
 are few and far between. Why Charles would have been granted a new desk
 is beyond you.

 You try crawling under the desk, but figure that if Charles does come

 Charles isn't quite that short. Finally, you try hiding behind a
 pencil, but you have a few more months on your diet before you can pull
 that off. Dejected, you go about finding a better way to avoid getting

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>climb out window
 As soon as your head ducks below the windowsill, you hear Charles
 (obviously with some assistance) break open the door and shriek: "The
 window, they've gone out the window!"

 Quickly, you begin to climb down the trellis, careful not to get your
 heels snagged in the ivy. However, you're more adept at navigating a
 concrete jungle than a real one, and soon one of your pumps gets caught
 on a particularly nasty weed. You kick wildly for a few moments, but
 it's to no avail; you lose your balance and tumble in to the bushes
 below, dragging the wreckage of the trellis with you.

 Behind the club (in the thorn bushes)
 Ow! While the bushes cushion your fall, preventing any serious damage,
 their thorns still manage to tear at your clothes and cling at your
 hair. As you pluck the spikes from your face, you hear Charles
 screaming from the window above.

>out
 You get out of the thorn bushes.

 Behind the club
 Yours are probably the first feet to tread here since the trellis was
 installed. The bushes have none of the carefully manicured branches or
 unnaturally bright flowers of their cousins in the garden. Instead,
 they are twisted with many sharp little thorns. They thin a little to
 the southwest.

 Without the cover of the bushes, Charles easily sees you. The criminal
 charges are no big deal, but being seen by the whole club being pulled
 from the bushes by the police is almost too much to bear.

 "Can you see them?" You hear a voice ask from above.

 "No, they're in the bushes," Charles replies.

>wait
 Although the thorns continue to poke in to your soft skin, you decide
 you'd rather put up with that for a few minutes than let Charles see
 you.

 "Well is there any more you want me to do?"

 "Nah, go back to the whirlpool, I'll take care of things here."

 You battle your way through the underbrush for what must literally be
 minutes until you arrive in the garden.

 Garden
 Being this far out in the country, the garden is really the only place
 at Pine Meadows where nature exists, yet isn't out of control. The
 topiary is subtle, no garish animals or ambitious creations. Flowers
 line the drive to the south, down which the valet service lies. A path,
 hedged with rose bushes, curves round the club to the northeast, and
 the club itself lies to the north.

 Melissa continues to read her book.

 "My, my. First the basement, now the bushes? Ever heard of a bed?"
 Melissa says, smirking.

>ask melissa about scott
 "Please, Julia. I'm trying to read." Melissa says, barely glancing up.

>ask melissa about burton
 "That Charles is something else, isn't he?"

 "Don't get me started. That man is such a bore. I dread each time I
 have to pay my dues and listen to him speak."

 The fall took its toll on your appearance. Your skirt was ripped, but
 you managed to capitalize on that by tearing it a little more and
 turning it in to a fashionable slit. Although you tried, you failed to
 get all the twigs and thorns out of your hair. Still, you look a lot
 better than most of the people around here.

 Foyer
 Putting the club's best foot forward is clearly the purpose of the
 foyer. A stately crystal chandelier scatters daylight into
 kaleidoscopic patterns. Two verdant plants stand next to a set of
 double doors to the north, their leaves extended as if to usher people
 in to the banquet hall. To the south, next to the exit to the gardens,
 is a bulletin board. The hall continues to the west and east.

>go east
 You make your way through the east wing to the garden path.

 Garden path
 Serving as little more than a junction, the path here leads from the
 garden in the southwest to the outside dining area in the north and
 northeast. The club itself lies to the west and the tennis court to the
 east. To the southeast is the pool, but it is closed for the season.

 Pine Meadows's most recent addition, the spa was built during the

 Spa
 Just two years ago, this place would have been packed at this time of
 day. Now hardly anyone comes in here, and you can hardly blame them. It
 feels more like some hellish jungle than a spa. The smell is subtle but
 gnaws at you nonetheless. A bed of rocks, heated to drive up sweat and
 drive out impurities, gives the room a heavy, fevered feeling, making
 you wonder why they even bothered considering there is already a
 whirlpool to the south. For those club members who have given up on
 trying to hide the fact that they dye their hair, a hairdresser's
 station sits to one side, from which you have a clear view of the lobby
 and its desk to the north. And all this set to some "Sounds of Nature"
 CD.

 Strands of gray hair form a trail through the spa, left after you gave
 Ms. Williams the Sinéad O'Conner look.

>go south
 You open the door and walk in.

 Whirlpool room
 Cramped and humid, the whirlpool room is dominated by a large tub of
 bubbling water. The steam coming from it is almost unbearable; it
 flattens your hair and clings to your skin. Even worse, there seems to
 be no ventilation other than from the door to the north, beside which
 is a row of hooks for hanging clothes.

 A young man reclines in the pool, naked.

 Some clothes hang on one of the hooks.

 The man sits up with a start but does nothing to conceal his nudity.
 "Who the hell are you?" he demands. Without waiting for a reply, he
 lies back. "Nevermind. I don't care. Charles said I could stay here all
 afternoon, so fuck off."

 "Either you tell me what I want to know or I walk out with these
 clothes right now."

 "What? You're crazy!"

 "Am I?" You walk towards the door.

 "Ok, wait, wait. Alright, what do you want to know?"

 "Well, who the hell you are, for starters."

 "Ok, I'm Scott. Charles's new 'assistant.' I'd shake your hand, but I'm
 a little indisposed at the moment."

 "I'll let it slide," you say, politely averting your eyes. "Do you
 always bathe naked with your employers?"

 "Bathe naked, sleep naked, play Parcheesi naked," he shrugs his
 shoulders. "Whatever they pay me for. It's all the same to me."

 You knew it. Charles was always a little well-manicured, even for Pine
 Meadows. "So he pays you for your services?"

 "Of course, you have seen him, haven't you?" The two of you share a
 collective shudder.

 "Alright, that's enough." Satisfied you have enough information, you
 hang his clothes back on the hooks.

 "Anytime."

 Charles sits at his desk, pushing some papers around to at least give
 the impression that he's worth the money the club pays him.

 On Charles's desk is a telephone.

 "Julia!" Charles says nasally. "So good to see you. Can I help you with
 anything?"

>ask charles about scott
 "So I was talking to Scott, and he had some of the most interesting
 things to say."

 "Um, ah." Charles tugs at his bow tie. "I don't know what you're
 talking about."

>blackmail charles
 Try typing BLACKMAIL (someone) WITH (some words).

>blackmail charles with scott
 "My, my Charles, you look absolutely flushed. Have you been in the
 whirlpool?" you ask gently.

 "Well, yes I have, Julia." --his cheeks get a little redder-- "It's
 marvelous. You really must try it sometime."

 "Were you in for long? I saw the door and it said you were signed up
 for the whole afternoon. I'm only asking because prolonged exposure can
 be terrible for the skin, let alone the health." Your lips pout out a
 little with feigned concern.

 "Um, well, I was only in for an hour or so, I'm letting my assistant
 use the rest of my time." Charles tugs a little at his bow tie.

 "Oh, so you finally found someone to work 'under' you?" you ask, your
 emphasis almost tacky.

 "Yes, his name's Scott. He's worth every penny the club pays him."

 "Oh yes, Scott. I spoke to him." Charles face drops. "He has some very
 interesting things to say."

 Charles face glistens with sweat. "Please, Julia. Don't tell anyone,
 I'll give you anything you want." He pleads.

 "Alright, let me in to those cabinets and let me use your phone."

 "But that is-"

 "Or I could just go talk to Mr. Knowles."

 "Ok, ok. Just as long as you don't tell anyone I let you," Charles says
 resignedly and goes back to working on his papers, even less believably
 than before.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>call doctor
 Suspicious about those pills, you call up doctor Ferguson.

 "Hi, Dr. Ferguson. This is Angie from Dr. Leeds office," you say in as
 nasal a voice as you can muster. "I'm calling in regards to a patient
 of yours, one Melissa Stratham."

 "Yes, what can I do for you?" he asks, more than a little perturbed to
 be disturbed.

 "Well, Mrs. Stratham told us that you gave her a prescription for
 Percodan to be renewed indefinitely and--"

 "What? She's still taking them? They're highly addictive!" he says with
 concern, more likely from fear of malpractice than genuine compassion.

 "Alright, Dr. Ferguson. I'll notify Betty Ford right away."

 With that, you hang up the phone and ignore Charles's odd looks.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>look up knowles
 Roger's files list him as the primary shareholder of the club, giving
 him the ability to make membership decisions completely at his own
 discretion.

 "Please, Julia. I've let you look at the records, isn't that enough?"

>ask charles about frank
 "Please, Julia. I've let you look at the records, isn't that enough?"

>go south

 Western wing
 This is the newest addition to Pine Meadows, built to house the new spa
 to the west. In stark contrast to the well-lit, tan stucco walls, a
 dingy concrete stairwell descends to south.  To the north, a rather
 uninspired doorway leads to the office of the club manager. The hall
 itself extends to the east.

>go east

 Foyer
 Putting the club's best foot forward is clearly the purpose of the
 foyer. A stately crystal chandelier scatters daylight into
 kaleidoscopic patterns. Two verdant plants stand next to a set of
 double doors to the north, their leaves extended as if to usher people
 in to the banquet hall. To the south, next to the exit to the gardens,
 is a bulletin board. The hall continues to the west and east.

>go north
 The hall is closed until tonight's banquet.

>go south

 Garden
 Being this far out in the country, the garden is really the only place
 at Pine Meadows where nature exists, yet isn't out of control. The
 topiary is subtle, no garish animals or ambitious creations. Flowers
 line the drive to the south, down which the valet service lies. A path,
 hedged with rose bushes, curves round the club to the northeast, and
 the club itself lies to the north.

 Getting to a particularly steamy passage, Melissa fans her neck
 vigorously.

>ask melissa about pills
 You tell Melissa about your little conversation with Dr. Ferguson.

 "So they're mine. No one but the most backwards fossil would care about
 my little indulgence."

>blackmail melissa with pills
 You tell Melissa about your conversation with Dr. Ferguson.

 "Oh, please. This is the new millenium. Who cares if I indulge in a
 little Percodan now and then?"

> blackmail melissa with addiction
 "Now why would that scare me?" Melissa says, and returns to her book.

>show pills to melissa
 (first taking the bottle of Percodan)
 You tell Melissa about your little conversation with Dr. Ferguson.

 "So they're mine. No one but the most backwards fossil would care about
 my little indulgence."

 "So where is your husband, anyway?"

 "He's gone to London for business until the end of the month. It's like
 I never get to see him any more. How is a girl supposed to stay
 faithful?" --she glances at you-- "Well I guess I'm asking the wrong
 person."

>tell melissa about scott
 "Please, Julia. I'm trying to read." Melissa says, barely glancing up.

>ask melissa about roger
 "So what do you know of Roger Knowles?"

 "Ugh," she says, wrinkling her nose, "that man is an ogre."

>go northeast

 Garden path
 Serving as little more than a junction, the path here leads from the
 garden in the southwest to the outside dining area in the north and
 northeast. The club itself lies to the west and the tennis court to the
 east. To the southeast is the pool, but it is closed for the season.

>go north
 As if you never left, Cissy starts back on her photos.

 Outside dining (next to the kitchen)
 This is what it's all about: stale food and staler gossip. However,
 despite all that, the outside dining offered by Pine Meadows is really
 the only thing that interests you at the club. The tables are full; the
 place is busy. The members don't seem to be eating all that much
 though, no doubt saving their appetites for the banquet tonight. To the
 west is the server's entrance to the kitchen where all manner of food
 is prepared. The dining area extends to the east, and to the south and
 southeast are the garden path and tennis court respectively.

 The waiter takes a sip from one of the finished drinks and seems to
 calm down a bit.

 Cissy stands here in all her fuchsia splendour.

 "You're not leaving already are you?" Cissy asks, lips pouted. "Oh
 well, you must come back to see the rest of my photos soon."

 Cynthia waits impatiently for her meal.

>tell cynthia about pills
 "What do you think of Percodan?"

 "I haven't done it in years. Oh, well that explains how you're able to
 let Frank touch you."

>tell cynthia about charles
 "What do you think of Charles?"

 "Really, Julia. The only thing worse than being a bore is talking about
 one."

>tell cynthia about scott
 "Really, Julia, can't we talk about something a little more
 interesting?".

>ask cynthia about roger

 A waiter bustles about frantically, trying desperately to keep up with
 drink orders from demanding patrons.

 Cissy stands here in all her fuchsia splendour.

>examine waiter
 Tuxedoes aren't active wear, and the waiter exemplifies perfectly why
 this is so. His cummerbund prevents him from turning his waist; his
 whole ensemble clings to him with sweat. In fact, his bow tie seems so
 tight that his eyes bug out and his face is flushed.

 Cissy continues to prattle on about her oh so fascinating life.

>ask waiter for peanuts
 "I'm sorry, Mrs. Hawthorne, but we don't serve peanuts here. There
 might be some sauce in the kitchen though."

 Cissy tells you about another 'famous' relative's accomplishments.

>order drink
 "Here you go, Mrs. Hawthorne," he says, handing you a glass of wine,
 his experience such that barely a ripple passes across its surface.

 Cissy continues to prattle on about her oh so fascinating life.

>spill wine on cissy
 Pretending to catch your heel on a crack, you launch yourself forward
 towards Cissy, spilling the deep, red wine over her clothes.

 "My clothes!" she cries, trying desperately to sop up the rapidly
 setting wine. "This was a gift from my husband." You guess he bought it
 as a not so subtle hint.

 "Don't worry Cissy, a little club soda and that will come right out." A
 lie, sure, but you have to stop her from sobbing somehow. Besides, you
 did her a favour, that monstrosity wasn't helping anyone.

 When Cissy sees that nothing she can do here will stop the stain, she
 begins to walk out. "Oh dear, guess I'll go home to change. I'll see
 you at the banquet tonight. Ciao."

>go west

 Kitchen
 For all the years you've been a member of Pine Meadows, you've never
 had a reason to visit the kitchen before today. And you are thankful
 for that. If you had been here years ago you certainly wouldn't have
 been so quick to eat the food. Gray slabs of meat lie along the
 counters and hang from cupboards; enormous pots, some empty, some full,
 sit on stoves. All this under a barrage of pedestrian smells that
 assault your nose. A set of large, locked doors lead west to the
 banquet hall and a smaller opening on the opposite wall leads back out
 to the dining area.

 Amongst the many exotic dishes, you see a steaming plate of Coquille
 Saint Jacques.

 When he thinks you aren't looking, one of the cooks spits in to a
 steaming plate of something.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open cupboards
 The cooks look at you suspiciously but say nothing. You're well known
 among the kitchen staff for your temper. The cupboards are packed with
 a bewildering array of foodstuffs.

>search cupboards
 Here we go, Thai peanut sauce. You slip it in to your pocket while the
 cooks aren't looking.

>put sauce on coquille
 "Please, Mrs. Hawthorne," says one of the cooks, "leave the food to
 us."

>examine cook
 Harried and hurried, the cooks rush about the kitchen.

>examine pots
 Balanced on the stove, several pots stand dangerously close to falling
 over.

>knock pot
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>push pot
 Pretending to move with a complete lack of grace, you clumsily lurch in
 to a large pot, sending it crashing to the floor.

 Momentarily, the cooks are shocked by the crash, but after that wears
 off they proceed to clean up the mess you made, casting dirty looks
 your way but remaining silent nonetheless. Being feared certainly has
 its advantages.

>put sauce on coquille
 With the cooks distracted, you sneak the peanut sauce in to Cynthia's
 food and discard the bottle.

 Apparently you made quite a mess. The cooks are still cleaning it up.

 A group of women sit here playing bridge and chatting.


 You arrive just as Cynthia sits down to eat her Coquille Saint-Jacques.
 Your glee can barely be contained as she raises a slimy piece of
 shellfish to her lips and delicately nibbles at it.

 A few minutes pass while Cynthia eats her meal and when she is done,
 she finishes it off with a delicate licking of her lips. That's when
 she notices what you have been seeing the whole time. Her lips,
 reacting furiously to the peanut sauce, have begun to swell, ballooning
 up to twice their regular size with no sign of stopping.

 "Myb bwips, bwat's bappebing?" she blubbers. Oh well, at least she
 won't need that collagen anymore.

 Soon the paramedics arrive to take her away from the crowd of gawking
 club members and elated waiters, leaving you to resume your business.

 You walk down the paved path until you come to the Pro Shop.

 Pro Shop
 Since Pine Meadows instituted the policy of allowing day memberships,
 the shop has been enjoying a lot more business. Well, enjoying is
 probably the wrong word. The only people who frequent the shop are
 amateur social climbers trying to impress clients or lonely housewives
 eager to get a little attention from Keith. Luckily, none of them seem
 to be around, leaving you to see how cramped the shop actually is. All
 manner of rackets, clubs, and balls crowd the walls; an obtrusive
 counter divides the room arbitrarily, and to the north a door leads to
 the driving range, too small to open up the place at all.

 Keith smiles up at you as you enter.

 "Hey babe, good to see ya," Keith says, smiling. "I was beginning to
 think you might not make it."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine keith
 Tall, well-muscled, and the most sexually virile man you've ever known,
 Keith rubs his hand across his chest absently when he catches you
 looking at him. You suppress a shudder and involuntarily lick your
 lips.

 "You better be careful with those around Mr. Knowles," Keith says,
 glancing at the pills and jerking his thumb towards the driving range.
 "He's in a huff ever since he found out about his grandson."

>smell keith
 Whatever smell is there is overpowered by your characteristic
 fragrance: Self-Obsession, by Calvin Klone.

>tell keith about photo
 "Listen, Keith, someone was in the access hall while we were in the
 closet and they took a photo."

 "You mean someone took a picture of us while we were fucking?" You
 cringe at his vulgarity. "Shit, what are we going to do?"

 "Don't worry, I'll take care of it," you say, hoping it's not a lie.

>tell keith about frank
 "About Frank..."

 "Why don't you leave him already? Then we could finally be together.
 Just don't tell him about us, he'd ruin me." With that, he leans
 forward dramatically. "I could give you the moon."

 No, what he could give you would be more painfully trite lines like
 that.

>tell keith about charles
 "What do you think of Charles?"

 "That guy freaks me out. Always brushing up against me and stuff."

 "Sorry, babe. I don't know nothing about that."

>go north

 Driving range
 With the banquet just a few hours away, most people aren't willing to
 work up a sweat. As such, the driving range is all but uninhabited.
 While most of the course is just grass, the range has concrete walks,
 sparing you from the torture that is walking on grass in heels. The Pro
 Shop lies to the south.

 Roger Knowles, a man who puts the 'old' in old money, stands here,
 occasionally hitting a ball off in to the green.

 "Oh, Julia, it's you," Roger says, looking up. As he returns his
 concentration to the game, he continues, "What do you want?"

>tell roger about pills
 You carefully feel Roger out about drugs.

 "Damn junkies," he spits, "they're ruining this country and this club.
 I will not have those people at Pine Meadows."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>tell roger about melissa
 You better not, blackmail only works if you haven't actually revealed
 the information.

 Roger sights up and smacks a ball clear across the green.

>examine roger
 While Pine Meadows's members have never been known for their
 progressive politics, Roger Knowles is considered a little
 old-fashioned even here. You'd be wise to watch your step around him;
 he's never liked you and, being a primary shareholder of the club, is
 likely to expel you should you disturb him too much.

>ask roger about frank
 "Julia, I have no need of your gossip."

 You can go only northeast, west, southwest, or south.

 Tennis court
 Since tennis became passé, this court is mainly used by those few
 members who actually enjoy the game. In fact, due to the reduced use,
 the club has even begun letting non-members play on it. You've never
 been that fond of tennis and with the rabble about, you're loath to
 even stay on the court. Hardly a big loss. The net droops, the benches
 are peeling, and the rubber floor sticks to your pumps. Although you
 are fenced in on most sides, thankfully, you can still leave to the
 more agreeable outside dining areas to the northwest and north, or the
 garden path to the west.

 Melissa continues to read her book.

 "Oh, Melissa," you say, smiling, "I was just talking to Roger Knowles,
 you know, primary shareholder of the club, the man with the power to
 make or break? Well, he had some of the most interesting things to say
 about, how did he put it, oh yes, 'junkies.' I just thought you
 might--"

 "Cut the crap, Julia, what do you want?" she says, her boldness
 replaced by anger.

 "Now, now. No need for such language," you say, enjoying your moment.
 "Just give me the film and no one need know your dirty little secret."

 "Fine, take it," she says, pulling a roll of film from her handbag and
 tossing it at you. With that, she stomps off from the garden. However,
 as she does, she calls back to you, a hint of satisfaction in her
 voice. "But if you want the photo itself, you might want to talk to the
 person who's behind all this."

 "Who?" you ask, painfully aware of how little time is left until the
 banquet.

 "Who do you think? Who stands to gain the most by you and Frank
 splitting up? Besides Frank of course." And with that, she's gone.

 In a strangely crude move, Beverly shifts her bra uncomfortably.

>show film to bevely
 You can only do that to something animate.

>show film to beverly
 "I guess this is what you're after," Beverly says, fishing in to her
 shirt and pulling out a photo. "Sorry about all I've put you through
 today, it's just I couldn't afford to let you know I had it until the
 banquet. You've proved quite resourceful so far. Who knows? Had you
 known it were me from the start, you might have just been able to stop
 me." She puts the photo back in her blouse. "Really, Julia, Frank and
 all his money deserve to be with someone a little more faithful than
 you. And once he sees this photo he'll realize who that is. Men are so
 easy to bend when vulnerable, don't you agree?"

 "Oh well," she says, turning off the machine and wiping the sweat from
 her brow. As she does, Beverly glances at her watch. "My, my. Look at
 the time. I must be getting ready for the banquet. Oh yeah, I forgot to
 tell you. I talked to Charles and told him about how it had been so
 long since I had seen Frank and he was more than willing to seat us all
 together. Isn't that wonderful?"

 "See you there," she says, throwing her purse over her shoulder and
 walking off.

 Beverly was right, the banquet is almost starting, which means Frank
 will be arriving soon. You run as fast as you can without breaking a
 sweat to the bathroom, toss your stuff in your locker, and go about
 making yourself look as presentable as possible. Quickly, you get the
 extra clothes from your locker, put them on, and go about fixing your
 makeup. Within twenty minutes (a Pine Meadows record) you are ready and
 speed your way to the banquet hall, drawing more than a little bit of
 attention: running is as rare as running shoes amongst these people.

 Luckily, your speed pays off and you get to the banquet just in time.
 Frank is just arriving and Beverly is nowhere to be seen, apparently
 your tampering with her clothes slowed her down long enough. Just as
 the doors open, Beverly comes racing down the hall with a sweater tied
 around her waist, casting you a dirty look as she does. With that, you
 are all ushered in to the hall.

 Banquet hall (at your table)
 Well, here you are, seated at a table in what amounts to the most
 horrifically uncomfortable chair you have ever been upon. An
 ostentatious centerpiece, surrounded by candles with a program leaning
 against it, sits in the middle of the table, its baby's breath bouncing
 perilously close to the flames. All around you, the din of diners
 talking, plates clunking, and air-conditioners whirring, fade in to the
 background, allowing you to concentrate on the problem at hand.

 Frank sits to one side, gazing fondly at you.

 Beverly eyes you suspiciously and pulls her purse a little closer.

 You nervously flip the menu over in your hands, absent-mindedly
 pretending to read.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You have so far scored 18 out of a possible 20, in 403 turns, earning
 you the rank of Dowager.

>SAVE
>cf8

>examine menu
 The situation is enough to make you lose your appetite. And if it
 weren't, having seen the kitchen earlier certainly would.

 Beverly takes a sip of her drink.

 You are carrying:
   a menu
   a change of clothes (being worn)
   your Louis Vuitton bag (which is open)
     your make-up
   your watch (being worn)

>examine candle
 I guess Charles thinks that if the banquet is lit with these, people
 won't be able to see how tacky the whole thing is.

 Frank sips at his drink nervously.

>examine centerpiece
 Egad, from a cursory glance, the centerpiece appeared to be fresh-cut
 flowers, but on closer inspection, it's plastic! You knew this place
 was going down hill, but plastic?

 Glancing up towards the stage, you see Charles preparing the podium for
 the speakers.

>examine program
 With black calligraphy on goldenrod, the program look like an angry
 wasp. It announces the "Opening speech by Julia Hawthorne,
 Philanthropist of the Year" that you have to make at quarter to seven.
 Whatever you're going to do, you better do it quick.

>set menu on fire
 I only understood you as far as wanting to set the menu.

>burn menu
 Trying to make it look as accidental as possible, you put the menu in
 to the flame. Within seconds it is flaring away, causing quite a scene.

 "Your menu!" Frank shouts, jumping to his feet, surprisingly gallant.
 Quickly, he grabs one of the glasses from the table and dashes water
 over the burgeoning fire. It goes out with a hiss, leaving a puddle of
 ashy water and charred paper. "That was close," he wheezes, wiping the
 sweat from his forehead.

 "Yes, a little too close," Beverly mutters, eyeing you suspiciously and
 moving her purse beneath her chair.

 A team of waiters, hitherto immobilized with shock, move in to action.
 Within a few moments, the table is restored and people start getting
 back to waiting for their meals and gossiping amongst themselves.

>take purse
 It's not her purse you want.

>look under chair
 Bending over has already gotten you in to one awkward position today.

>take photo
 "Tut, tut, Julia," Beverly whispers, "you needn't provoke me, I'll show
 Frank in due time."

>burn program
 Better not, you already look like enough of a pyro.

 Suddenly, from the stage, the ceiling, and behind, speakers screech to
 life. "Testing." Charles voice sounds out from all corners of the room,
 a good deal less servile when pumped out at a hundred and ten decibels.

>burn beverly
 Better not, you already look like enough of a pyro.

 "Now, to say a few words before the banquet, here's Julia Hawthorne,
 this year's philanthropist of the year," Charles says, gesturing to you
 with a wide sweep of his hand while an enormous circle of light falls
 on you from a spotlight above. "Let's give her a hand, everybody!" A
 round of applause ensues.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You have no other choice. The time for action is over. Dejected, you
 make your way to the stage, hoping that Beverly chooses to prolong your
 anxiety for awhile longer and not show Frank the photo. Of course, hope
 is all you can do.

 When you reach the stage, you cast a glance towards your table, just
 long enough to see Beverly showing something to Frank. As you begin
 your speech, Frank leaves the table, and your life, forever.


     *** Your marriage is ruined ***

 first place. His skin is pale, his hair is limp, his body is flabby,
 and his clothes are outdated. Then you glance down at the bulge in his
 pants and remember: it was the size of his wallet.

 Glancing up towards the stage, you see Charles preparing the podium for
 the speakers.

>spill drink
 What do you want to spill the drinks in?

>purse
 You need to be holding the drinks before you can put them on top of
 something else.

>examine beverly
 For all her bravado on the tennis court, Beverly seems to be a tad
 nervous. It's a lot easier to threaten to cause a scene and ruin a
 marriage than to actually do so. But if she's held on this long,
 there's no way she'll bow out now. In fact, you can see her hand
 dangling below the table, ready to fish out the photo from her purse at
 any moment.

 Frank gulps down the rest of his drink.

>get drink
 You don't want to anger either of them.

 Draining her glass, Beverly licks the rim with relish. She always was a
 bit of a lush.

>examine plant
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine candle
 I guess Charles thinks that if the banquet is lit with these, people
 won't be able to see how tacky the whole thing is.

 "Here, Beverly, let me get that for you," Frank says, taking the empty
 glasses and calling over the waiter.

 "Oh, Frank. You're such a gentleman. How does Julia ever keep her hands
 off of you?" she says, handing him her glass.

 Frank chuckles. He always does that when he's nervous.

>put pills in beverly's drink
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine menu
 The situation is enough to make you lose your appetite. And if it
 weren't, having seen the kitchen earlier certainly would.

 A waiter comes by and removes the empty glasses, ignoring all requests
 for new drinks.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait

>wait

>sing
 Me me me me!

 Suddenly, from the stage, the ceiling, and behind, speakers screech to
 life. "Testing." Charles voice sounds out from all corners of the room,
 a good deal less servile when pumped out at a hundred and ten decibels.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Now, to say a few words before the banquet, here's Julia Hawthorne,
 this year's philanthropist of the year," Charles says, gesturing to you
 with a wide sweep of his hand while an enormous circle of light falls
 on you from a spotlight above. "Let's give her a hand, everybody!" A
 round of applause ensues.

>burn menu
 Trying to make it look as accidental as possible, you put the menu in
 to the flame. At first, no one notices the small flame, and by the time
 they do, it's too late for them to do anything.

 "Your menu!" Frank shrieks, pointing frantically and lurching back from
 the table. His foot catches on the leg of his chair, and he is sent
 sprawling in to a dessert cart. Another time and you might have found
 that funny, but you've had your fill of schadenfreude for today.

 Beverly, for once losing her icy composure, scrabbles away from the
 table as fast as she can.

 The fire begins to spread.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>take photo
 With everyone distracted by the raging fire, you grab the photo. Damn
 it's hot.

 The fire spreads to the centrepiece, the cheap plastic leaves curling
 and spouting out plumes of foul-smelling smoke.

>burn photo
 With a rather dramatic flourish (hey, you deserve it) you crumple up
 the photo and toss it in to the fire. As it burns, so does Beverly's
 hope of destroying your marriage. Not that she stops trying, though.
 Frank tells you later that week about a phone call from her, but
 without any proof, his blind adoration of you wins out over suspicion.

 The fire that resulted during the banquet ended up destroying a good
 portion of the building. Good riddance, you say, the club was past its
 prime and it was more fitting that it go out with flare rather than
 dwindle away to mediocrity.

 The fire spreads to the centrepiece, the cheap plastic leaves curling

>wait
 Time passes.

 The flames web across the tablecloth, scorching the table underneath
 and sending waves of heat in to your face. You feel your nose soften.
 Dr. Rickers said it would take at least twice this much heat; that son
 of a bitch is so sued.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The fire licks at the table, sending out smoke that makes your head
 swim.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The table collapses in to a pile of flaming kindling, sending a scent
 reminiscent of your trip upstate in to the air.

 All the smoke finally gets to you. Your mind clouds over for a moment,
 and your knees buckle from under you. The last thing you remember is
 pitching headlong in to the fire.

 When you awaken a few days later, you learn that Frank never saw the
 photo. But your satisfaction is short lived. With all the scars on your
 face, that's probably the last photo in which you looked decent. Well
 maybe not decent.

>tell frank about keith
 First casting a defiant look at Beverly, you turn to Frank, take his
 hand in yours, and pinch your thigh to get some authentic tears
 flowing.

 "Frank, I have to tell you something..."

 After what seems like hours of tears, pleads, and yells, things finally
 settle down. It's over. Not that it's the worst loss or anything, you
 just wish you hadn't signed that pre-nupt.

 Ahh, convince Frank you're a complete nympho by kissing Beverly and
 then maybe he won't consider your affair an act of betrayal and instead
 carry you off to the sexual-dysfunction clinic in his arms and you'll
 all live happily ever after, is that your plan? Dream on.

 Beverly takes a sip of her drink.

>kiss frank
 You haven't kissed him in months. To do so now might raise suspicion,
 and something else you're not too fond of.

 Office of the Registrar
 Clearly the focus of the layout, a magnificently restored antique oak
 desk stands near the back of the room, illuminated by a spacious window
 overlooking the golf course. Somewhat less impressive, a wise move
 considering they might detract from the desk, are a row of cabinets
 leading from the door to the south, along the wall, to the window at
 the far side of the room.

 On Charles's desk is a telephone.

 If you wanted to put something limp and wilted in your mouth... Ok,
