 Chapter 1: The Call of the Open Road

 Your Driveway -- Near the House
 The long driveway stretches east, towards adventure.

 The Dynamo gleams in the dappled sunlight. In the front seat is
 Aloysius.

>examine me
 You're Troy Sterling, daredevil adventurer. Or you will be, as soon as
 you master all this technical stuff and get on with the daredeviling
 part.

 "Come on, Mr. Sterling... get in!" says Aloysius.

>examine aloysius
 Aloysius Pratt is a brilliant inventor, a patient teacher, and a loyal
 companion. Scratch his crusty exterior and you will find boundless and
 inexplicable layers of additional crust. As far as you know, he's
 crust all the way down.

 "Mr. Sterling, are you finished staring at me?" he says, fidgeting
 uncomfortably. He gestures down your driveway, towards the east.
 "There's no time to lose!"

>kiss aloysius
 "That's not in my job description, Mr. Sterling!"

 "This is no time to delay!"

>go east
 "Not on foot, Mr. Sterling!" shouts Aloysius, shocked.

>hug aloysius
 "That's not in my job description, Mr. Sterling!"

 "Mr. Sterling, what did you buy the car for if you're not going to get
 in it?" asks Aloysius.

>enter car
 You step up on the running board. The instruments are arranged neatly
 on the dashboard in front of you. You open the glove compartment,
 revealing some gloves.

>get gloves
 Taken.

>examine it
 The Pratt Dynamo is Aloysius Pratt's latest, most brilliant invention
 -- twin six-cylinder motors, an electric starter, hydraulic steering,
 an on-board heater, and some stuff that has to do with fuel and
 airflow that you didn't quite catch the last time Aloysius mentioned
 it.  The body is white with gold trim. On the luggage rack are a tool
 chest and a crate.

 In the front seat are yourself and Aloysius.

 "Mr. Sterling, we'd better get going," says Aloysius.

>examine them
 Leather, long... still fairly new. Fur-lined.

>wear left glove
 I only understood you as far as wanting to wear the motors.

>wear glove
 (the gloves)

 "Great," says Aloysius. "Now let's go!"

 You slip them on. They fit you like... well, like gloves.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>turn on heater
 That's not something you can switch.

 Aloysius watches you, puzzled.

>examine heater
 Ever since the time you accidentally put fuel in the radiator and set
 it on fire, you have pretty much decided to let Aloysius handle all
 the details of taking care of the Dynamo.

>start car
 You push the electrical ignition button. The motors roar to life.

 Aloysius beams. "Very good, Mr. Sterling! You've been studying!"

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine tool chest
 A big metal tool chest, slightly dented. Aloysius still hasn't
 forgiven you for backing over it last month.

>open chest
 Aloysius, looking agitated, stops you. "Don't mess with that, Mr.
 Sterling," he says.

>go east
 With a horrendous screeching sound, the car lurches forward a little
 bit.

 "Parking brake!" Aloysius shouts. "Release the parking brake!"

>release break
 You release the parking brake.

 Aloysius watches approvingly. "Good, good," he says.

>go east
 But wait -- your hair! It might get messed up!

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some gloves (being worn)

>examine crate
 Just a big wooden crate.

>ask aloysius about hat
 "I don't know what to say about that," he says. He gestures down your
 driveway, towards the east. "There's no time to lose!"

>lower roof
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine panel
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine controls

>open crate
 You open the crate, revealing some bundles of flyers and a loose
 flyer.

>examine car
 The Pratt Dynamo is Aloysius Pratt's latest, most brilliant invention
 -- twin six-cylinder motors, an electric starter, hydraulic steering,
 an on-board heater, and some stuff that has to do with fuel and
 airflow that you didn't quite catch the last time Aloysius mentioned
 it.  The body is white with gold trim. On the luggage rack are a tool
 chest and a crate.

 In the front seat are yourself and Aloysius.

>examine loose flyer
 Taken.
 It bears an image of your face in profile, and reads as follows:

 Troy Sterling! (Amazing! Courteous!)

 Unlike other daredevil would-be role models, Troy always aids the
 helpless, waves to strangers, and blesses sneezers.

 Automotive tours. Camping and hiking expeditions. Birthday parties.
 House-sitting. Pet exercising.

 Troy Sterling! (Polite! Kind!)

>examine airflow
 You can't see any such thing.

>honk horn
 No little puny "ooga-ooga" squeeze-bulb for you! This baby's a
 steam-powered calliope, built to your exact specifications by Mr.
 Aloysius Pratt.

 The on-board calliope churns out a rousing march rendition of
 "Greensleeves."

>ask aloysius about car
>examine hair
 Aloysius fidgets. "Aw, you know how I feel about the automobile, Mr.
 Sterling."

 You can't see any such thing.

>look

 Your Driveway -- Near the House (in the Pratt Dynamo)
 The long driveway stretches east, towards adventure.

 The instruments are arranged neatly on the dashboard in front of you.

 In the Pratt Dynamo you can see Aloysius, an index card, some goggles,
 your favourite peaked riding cap and a scarf.

>examine instruments
 Among the notable features of the dashboard are a steering wheel, an
 electrical ignition button, a parking brake, a horn and a glove
 compartment (which is open but empty).

>wear cap, scarf and goggles
 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>wear cap
 (first taking the peaked riding cap)

 Aloysius watches incredulously. "At a time like this, you're worried
 about fashion?"
 You don your favourite riding cap. The cry, "Huzzah!" escapes your
 lips.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wear scarf
 (first taking the scarf)

 Aloysius rolls his eyes. "Never mind the threat of darkness looming
 over your household; paying back your debt to the forces of light can
 wait until you complete your stylish ensemble!"
 You throw the scarf around your manly neck, grinning your winningest
 grin.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wear goggles
 (first taking the goggles)

 "Mr. Sterling, whenever you're finished...?" says Aloysius, miming a
 driving motion, and gesturing east.

 You snap the goggles jauntily over your head. A little too jauntily,
 as it turns out. But a headache and blurred vision are a small price
 to pay for such dramatic flair.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine index card
 (first taking the index card)
 Taken.
 Neatly printed on the index card are the following instructions:

 "To use the patented Pratt Electrical Ignition System, 'push the
 ignition button'.
 "To use the parking brake, 'set brake' or 'release brake'.
 "To drive, simply 'drive [direction]'."

>go west
>hello?
 Aloysius points east. "To the other end of the driveway we go!" he
 shouts....
 From here, you can only go east.

>drive e
>wait
 Aloysius points east. "To the other end of the driveway we go!" he
 shouts....

 Your Driveway -- Near the Mailbox (in the Pratt Dynamo)
 Your tree-lined driveway leads west. Greenwood Lane runs north into
 town, and south into the country.

 The instruments are arranged neatly on the dashboard in front of you.

 In the Pratt Dynamo you can see Aloysius.

 Aloysius spots something. "There it is!" he shouts, pointing at a
 horse-drawn van, which approaches from the north.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open mailbox
 You open the mailbox.

 Aloysius starts to get out of the automobile, but hesitates.

 The horse-drawn van is some distance away, but approaching.

 Aloysius turns to face you. "You do it, Mr. Sterling," he says,
 holding out an envelope.

>examine envelope
 You'd have to be holding it first.

 Aloysius, looking over his shoulder at the van, waves the envelope at
 you.

>get envelope then x it
 Taken.

 "Good," says Aloysius. "You know what to do!"

 Indeed! You feel your muscles tingling as you contemplate this, your
 opportunity to send a message -- one that will pay back your debt,
 dispel the shadows of night, and restore the forces of light.

 The horse-drawn van is drawing closer to your driveway.
 It's stamped, and addressed to the Delinquent Accounts Office, Edison
 Electric Power & Light Co.

 The van is almost at your driveway.

>put envelope in mailbox
 You put the envelope in the mailbox.

 The horse-drawn van pulls up to your mailbox and stops.

 The driver peers into the mailbox, takes out the envelope and puts a
 postcard inside.

 "I really wish you were more conscientious about paying your bills on
 time, Mr. Sterling," says Aloysius. "But I guess it's not my place to
 say."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 "Good day to you!" says the mail driver, waving cheerfully.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "You're not exactly friendly when you're not in front of a paying
 audience," sniffs the driver.

>wave
 You wave to the driver. He is exceedingly pleased by your friendly
 gesture.
 The driver pulls away, smiling happily.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 It's stamped, and addressed to the Delinquent Accounts Office, Edison

 The postal van disappears around a bend to the south.

 The driver takes the envelope. "Right you are," he says.

 The driver waves at you again, apparently hoping for a response.

 "I really wish you were more conscientious about paying your bills on

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You wave to the driver. He is exceedingly pleased by your friendly

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open mailbox
 That's already open.

 The driver pulls away, smiling happily.

 Aloysius sighs thoughtfully. "Well, we survived another brush with the
 Dark Riders of the Postal Service," he says.

>get postcard
 Taken.

 The postal van disappears around a bend to the south.

 Aloysius hops out of the car.

 "You know, Mr. Sterling, something about those motors just didn't
 sound right. Shut them off a minute, please."

>examine postcard
 The postcard the mailman dropped off in your box seems to be another
 ominous legal statement from the Edison Electric Power & Light Co.

 Whew! You can rest easy now. Your debt has been paid, and your
 household will no longer be threatened with darkness. *If* the cheque
 doesn't bounce, that is.

 "Mr. Sterling, cut the motors, would you?" says Aloysius.

>push ignition
 You push the electrical ignition button, cutting the motors.

 Aloysius walks around to the front of the Dynamo, absently patting the
 frame as he goes. "Let me take a look for a minute," he says, cheerful
 once again.

>whistle
 You take a deep breath. You belt out a few random notes.

 Aloysius tinkers with the motors, whistling happily to himself.

>examine motors
 The motors are currently switched off.

 To the south, a horse-drawn buggy rounds a bend and comes into view.

>examine buggy
 It's just a little horse-drawn buggy, the kind a well-to-do farmer
 might take out on a Saturday afternoon, to shop with his wife, or
 *for* his wife, or for *a* wife, as the case may be.

 The buggy slows down as it approaches your driveway.

 "Broken down again, I see," smirks the driver.

 "There's nothing wrong with this machine, MacDougal," growls Aloysius.

 MacDougal pretends to steer a wheel. "Look at me, I'm an autoist! I am
 an affront to the laws of man and nature! I catch bugs in my teeth!
 Haw, haw!"

>honk horn
 Nothing happens, since the motors aren't on.

 Aloysius climbs wearily back into the Dynamo. "Just what I needed
 today," he mutters.

 MacDougal pretends to steer a wheel. "I sit in a noisy, expensive
 automobile! When it works, I run people off roads! I make little
 babies cry! My personal hygiene is appalling! Haw, haw!"

>push button
 You push the electrical ignition button. The motors roar to life.
 MacDougal's horse rears up. "Woah, there!" shouts MacDougal,
 struggling to keep control.

 Aloysius bursts out laughing. "Serves you right, you old buzzard!"

>honk
 (the horn)
 The on-board calliope churns out an exhilarating percussion rendition
 of "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean."

 MacDougal's horse rears up again.

 Aloysius's expression changes from delight to shock, as one of the
 buggy's wheels slips into a drainage ditch, just east of the road.
 MacDougal -- cursing a blue streak -- struggles to regain control of
 the horse, as the buggy totters on the edge.
>go east
 ...
 The buggy drops out of sight, taking the wild-eyed MacDougal along
 with it.

 The horse breaks free, and bolts into the woods.

 MacDougal must have landed hard in the ditch -- nothing seems to be
 moving down there.

>go down
 When still seated in an automobile, horizontal travel is generally
 best.

 Aloysius clucks his tongue, looking down into the ditch. "I hope he's
 not hurt down there... not too much, anyway."

>out
>out
 You slip out from behind the wheel. The Dynamo starts to roll...

 Aloysius lunges for the instruments. "Parking brake!" he shouts. "Set
 the parking brake!"

 Aloysius stops the Dynamo from rolling away.

>go down

 Roadside Ditch
 This is a rather deep roadside ditch. To the west, it ascends back
 towards the road.

 MacDougal, unconscious, is trapped beneath the buggy.

 From down here in the ditch, you can just barely see part of the
 Dynamo.

 You can also see MacDougal's ragged felt hat and a detached wooden
 wheel here.

 Muttering, Aloysius clambers down into the ditch just behind you.

>take hat
 Taken.

 "Well, would you look at that," says Aloysius, clucking his tongue.

>wake macdougal
 His eyes flutter open.

 MacDougal's groggy eyes suddenly become sharp. "You!" he snaps. "You
 autoists and your confounded mechanical monsters!"

 Aloysius rolls his eyes. "As you can hear, he's completely unharmed."

 MacDougal is still pinned beneath the buggy. "Get me out of here!"

>dust off hat
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine wheel
 This wooden wheel must have come off the buggy when it flipped over.

>push buggy
 Working together, you and Aloysius manage to free MacDougal from under
 the buggy.

 MacDougal brushes himself off, looking around unhappily. "Where's my
 hat?"

>take wheel
 Taken.

>give hat to macdougal
 MacDougal, grabbing his hat, grunts the tiniest little grunt of
 thanks.

 Aloysius looks chastened by your good example. "Well, I guess I
 wouldn't want to see any man trampled dead by his own horse. Not even
 MacDougal."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>score
 You have so far scored 9 out of a possible 42, in 63 turns.

>wave to macdougal
>give wheel to macdougal
 MacDougal just rolls his eyes.

 "My horse is bolted, my buggy's broke, and I'm supposed to be picking
 up some big-city visitor for Professor Sneedlewood," says MacDougal,
 growling and whining simultaneously.

 "Now, now," says Aloysius. "Take it easy, MacDougal. Mr. Sterling here
 can take care of the visitor."

 "I'll thank you keep your hands off my belongings," he snaps.

 MacDougal eyes you suspiciously as he stretches out kinks in his neck.
 "I can't say as I'd want to force anyone to ride in that tin-plated
 corpse-generator of yours... but here." He fishes into his pocket.
 "Your victim -- I mean, your passenger -- will be looking for this at
 the train station."

 MacDougal produces a hand-lettered sign.

>get sign
 Taken.

 "Listen here, Sterling. The professor says this visitor is very
 important," says MacDougal. "Try to keep that damned contraption of
 yours from killing her."

 Aloysius raises an eyebrow. "'Her'?"
>examine it
 ...
 "That's right," says MacDougal. "Her name's Melody Sweet."

>examine it
 A small, hand-lettered sign that reads, "Miss Sweat". (The "a" is
 squeezed in as an afterthought.)

 What unaccompanied female wouldn't immediately trust the bearer of
 this particular sign to pick her up in the train station and drive her
 to Professor Sneedlewood's estate, north of town?

 "I was headed to the train station to pick her up. Supposed to drive
 her up north, to the professor's place," says MacDougal.

>say bye
 Whom do you want to say the goodbye to?

>macdougal
 He grumbles dismissively. "Too busy fer that."

 "Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a horse to catch," says MacDougal.
 He climbs back up out of the ditch, and exits.

 Aloysius examines the buggy with an expert eye.

>search buggy
 You find nothing of interest.

 "Guess I'll get my tools. You can just run along as usual and try to
 impress the ladies," says Aloysius. "At least I'm good at what *I*
 do!"

 Aloysius climbs back up out of the ditch, and exits.

>out
 You climb back up out of the ditch.

 Your Driveway -- Near the Mailbox
 Your tree-lined driveway leads west. Greenwood Lane runs north into
 town, and south into the country.

 The Dynamo is here, its motors humming.

 You can also see Aloysius here.

 Aloysius carries his tool chest down into the ditch, muttering to
 himself: "Someday I gotta get *me* a faithful mechanic sidekick."

 The weather is perfect for a little jaunt into town. How fortunate
 that the arrival of this Miss Sweet affords you this opportunity to be
 heroic and dashing.

>enter dynamo
 You step up on the running board. The instruments are arranged neatly
 on the dashboard in front of you.

>release brake
 You release the parking brake.

 A small, colourful shape catches your eye by the side of the road,
 just beneath a tree. It seems to be a twitterpated hatchling.

 The road flows by at an exhilarating pace.

 The twitterpated hatchling is rather small, and shivering. It looks

 The familiar buildings and side streets look cheerful in the bright
 sunlight. The train station is to the east, and a livery stable is to
 the west. Greenwood Lane runs north towards the Sneedlewood Mansion
 (some distance away), and south towards your estate.

 A group of excited children swarms around the Dynamo.

 Just a big wooden crate.

 More children emerge from the sidestreets. "Blow the horn!" one of
 them shouts.

 In the crate are some bundles of flyers.

 All the children are now chanting, "Blow the horn! Blow the horn!"

>examine bundle
 The bundles are neatly tied up, waiting for you to distribute at your
 next big engagement.

 "Hey fellas," says one of the taller boys, "let's go wait for the
 train at the overpass."

 As the children scamper off, one collides with a short man on his way
 to the train station.

 "Excuse me," says the child, startled.

 The man smiles through clenched teeth. "Quite alright," he says,
 awkwardly patting the child's head.

>out
 You slip out from behind the wheel.

 The child stares at the man for a moment, and then darts after the
 rest of the children. "Hey! Wait for me!"

 As the children run off, you can hear their breathless chatter.

 The short stranger goes east.

 You put the old bucket into the glove compartment.

>So, we leave it unlocked?
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>go east

 Train Station
 There's really not much to the local train station; just a roofed
 platform and a long bench. The only exit is back west.

 You can see a short stranger here.

 You can hear the train approaching. It will be here in a moment if you
 wait.

>examine stranger
 His shiny black hair is slicked back over his head. Upon noticing your
 gaze, he makes what appears to be an honest attempt at a smile, but he
 looks away quickly.

 The train -- a two-boiler, 450-litre Douglas Special, in all its
 mechanical glory, pulls into the station, belching steam and soot.

 The passengers will be exiting soon.

>greet stranger
 "Hello," he says, shyly avoiding your eyes.

 From the train pours forth a spectacle of businessmen with folded
 newspapers, a blossom of ladies in floral hats, and a fountain of
 youths scratching at their travel clothes.

 Soon, the businessmen have shaken hands and parted; the ladies have
 claimed the arms and ears of their beaux, and the youths have endured
 many "welcome home" kisses.

>wave sign
 In a moment, the crowd clears, and the platform is empty once
 more...or almost empty.

 There's now a young woman sitting on the bench.

>wave sign
 You look ridiculous waving the small sign.

>show sign to woman
 She takes the small sign and winces.

 She gets up from the bench. "I'm Melody Sweet. I'm pleased to meet
 you. Thank you for coming."

 The train engineer pokes his head out of the locomotive. "Look, boys!
 Sterling's at it again!" he shouts, and withdraws his head from view
 again.

 "I packed as lightly as I could, but I'm afraid my trunk has gotten
 rather heavy," says Miss Sweet.

>kiss melody
 Her icy glare stops you in your tracks. And a good thing, too -- such
 an affront would hardly help your reputation.

 "I'd be ever so grateful for your assistance," Miss Sweet continues,
 gesturing towards her trunk.

>examine sweet
 She is a smallish, red-haired young woman, with high cheekbones and
 bright, intense eyes. She carries herself with the confident bearing
 of a performer -- someone who is used to being seen and heard. She is
 carrying a small sign and a purse.

 Upon noticing your gaze, she holds her shoulders a bit more erect, and
 tosses her head a little farther back.

 Neaby is a small, white trunk.

 Sighing dramatically, Miss Sweet opens her purse. "Perhaps you will
 help me now?" she asks, flashing a coin at you.

 A passing porter changes course in mid-stride, and heads for Miss
 Sweet.

>get trunk

 The porter tips his hat stiffly. "I'll be off then," he says, and
 dashes away.
 The trunk is heavier than it looks -- but not too heavy for you.

 Miss Sweet smiles politely. "Would you be so kind as to take me to
 Professor Sneedlewood now? I will follow you."

>go west

 In the Center of Town
 The familiar buildings and side streets look cheerful in the bright
 sunlight. The train station is to the east, and a livery stable is to
 the west. Greenwood Lane runs north towards the Sneedlewood Mansion
 (some distance away), and south towards your estate.

 The Dynamo is here, its motors humming.

 Miss Sweet follows you.

>put trunk in trunk
 (the small white trunk in the small white trunk)
 You can't put something inside itself.

 "I really shan't be able to relax for a moment -- not until we are
 safely on our way," says Miss Sweet.

>put trunk in boot
 (the small white trunk in the Dynamo)
 That can't contain things.

>boot trunk
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put trunk in luggage rack
 (the small white trunk in the luggage rack)
 You heft the trunk onto the luggage rack, where it settles in
 securely.

 "Thank you," says Miss Sweet.

 "So this is the famous Pratt Dynamo," says Miss Sweet. She stands near
 it, hand extended, palm down.

>ask sweet about professor
 "Professor Sneedlewood is a professor of Central American Antiquities,
 although he seems to fancy himself something of a musical historian as
 well," says Miss Sweet.

 Miss Sweet raises her hand a little higher.

>open door
 Miss Sweet permits you to hand her into the Dynamo. "Thank you," she
 says.

>in
 You step up on the running board.

 Miss Sweet settles herself in for the ride.

>go south
 "Excuse me, but the professor has informed me that his house is north
 of town," says Miss Sweet.

 "I believe I shall enjoy the ride to the professor's residence," says
 Miss Sweet.

>go north
>hit a key
 As soon as you start moving, the train in the station lurches forward.
 You and the engineer make eye contact briefly. His steely glare is all
 the challenge you need....

 As you make your way through the narrow streets, the train pulls ahead
 of you; but you start making up ground rapidly once you make it out
 onto...

 Greenwood Lane (in the Pratt Dynamo)
 You're on a lovely stretch of country road on the way to Professor
 Sneedlewood's estate, just north of town.

 On the rails which parallel the road, the Douglas Special tears along
 northwards, steam and sparks flying.

 In the Pratt Dynamo you can see Miss Sweet.

 The Dynamo is trailing the caboose.

>push nitrous button

 says.

 Far up ahead, you notice a slow-moving surrey.

 The Dynamo is even with a freight car.

>go north
 But the slow-moving surrey is blocking your progress!

 The Dynamo falls behind the freight car.

 Miss Sweet watches in dismay. "I had expected much more from the
 driver of the famous Pratt Dynamo, that's for sure," she sighs.

 The driver of the surrey has positioned himself directly in the middle
 of the road, making it impossible to pass.

 The Dynamo is even with the caboose.

>honk
 (the horn)
 The on-board calliope churns out a peppy dog-bark rendition of "Ave
 Maria." Miss Sweet can't help but to join in, and finishes off with a
 fancy flourish.

>honl
 The horse (harnessed to the surrey) rears up in alarm... The horse
 pulls the surrey off the road, where it careens through the brush.

 The road leading north is now clear.

 "LOOK OUT!" Miss Sweet shrieks.

 You press on the accelerator. The motors roar murderously....

 The children are frozen in terror!

 Miss sweet grabs at the wheel in a desperate attempt to alter your

 The terrified children freeze in their tracks. You manage to avoid
 hitting them, but the Dynamo spins off the road and into the trees...
 The Dynamo's motors cut off with a horrible grinding sound.

 "Hooray for Troy Sterling!" shout the children, scampering off into
 the woods.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 Steam is escaping from the radiator.

>go east
 But you can't drive the Dynamo unless the motors are on!

 Miss Sweet avoids your eyes. "I hope it's not too serious, Mr.
 Sterling," she says. "I guess I'll just wait here, while you fix it...
 if you can, that is."

 To the south, you can hear the Douglas Special approaching.

>Yay.
 "Huzzah!" you shout.

 Miss Sweet looks around in a vaguely apprehensive manner.

 The Douglas Special thunders up from the south. The engineer blows his
 whistle insolently as the engine screams past you. Passengers lean out
 of the windows, jeering, as the train rumbles past.

 The train disappears around the bend ahead of you.

>in
 But you're already in the Pratt Dynamo.

 The steam coming from the radiator is much lighter now.

>push button
 No, no... Aloysius would be beside himself in rage if he ever learned
 you drove the Dynamo in its present condition! You'd better fix the
 radiator first.

 The steam cloud dissipates.

 You slip out from behind the wheel.

>examine radiator
 The radiator is gleaming and shiny. There are hardly any dead bugs in
 it, thanks to Aloysius's careful ministerings. There is no water in
 it, leaving the car undriveable.

 Miss Sweet puts her hand to her temple and sighs.

 You're on a lovely stretch of country road that leads north towards

 The rails run north and south, parallel to the road.

 Miss Sweet hums a little something to herself.

 You hear nothing unexpected.

>hit a key
 You put one foot in front of the other, making slow progress, the

 Walking on Greenwood Drive
 You're on a lovely stretch of country road that leads north towards
 Professor Sneedlewood's estate. The road stretches south some distance
 towards the town.

 The rails run north and south, parallel to the road.

 The Dynamo is still visible some distance to the north, on the side of
 the road, crippled.

 Around a bend to the south comes the slow-moving surrey. The driver is
 glowering, and the apple-cheeked blonde is sulking, sitting as far
 away from the driver as she can get.

>wave to driver
 He's too far away for that.

 The surrey continues to approach from the south.

 "Get a horse!" shouts the driver.

 The apple-cheeked blonde giggles, and slips her hand through the
 driver's arm.

 The surrey continues on up the road, passes the Dynamo without slowing
 down, and disappears around the corner.

>go south
 You put one foot in front of the other, making slow progress, the

 In the Center of Town
 The familiar buildings and side streets look cheerful in the bright
 sunlight. The train station is to the east, and a livery stable is to
 the west. Greenwood Lane runs north towards the Sneedlewood Mansion
>hit a key
 (some distance away), and south towards your estate.

 You can't see any such thing.

>go west

 Livery Stable
 You are in front of the livery stable, in the old commercial sector of
 town. The center of town is east.

 Some old men sit around in the shade, playing checkers and generally
 passing the time.

 A rusty iron pump stands next to a watering trough.

>fill bucket from pump
 You pump vigorously. Water gushes from the spout and soon fills the
 watering trough.

 From the woods, MacDougal emerges, leading his nervous horse.

 Some of the old men greet MacDougal; others continue playing without
 interruption.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   an old bucket
   a detached wooden wheel
   a postcard
   an index card
   some goggles (being worn)
   a scarf (being worn)
   your favourite peaked riding cap (being worn)
   a loose flyer
   some gloves (being worn)

 MacDougal eyes you with disdain. "I didn't hear your God-awful
 contraption ride up. Ya didn't break down already, did ya? Haw, haw."

 A low chuckle rises from the group of old men, who elbow each other
 and smirk at you from beneath their hats.

>pour bucket on macdougal
 (MacDougal)
 That would hardly be polite.

 MacDougal glances over his shoulder at the old men. One or two are
 watching with amusement.

 MacDougal pats his horse's flank. "This here's a horse. H-O-R-S-S.
 It's kinda of like an automobile, except it works! Haw, haw!"

>fill bucket
 (transferring water from the watering trough)
 You fill the old bucket.

 MacDougal pretends to throw a scarf around his neck, and shows his
 grizzled profile. "Look here, I'm Troy Sterling!" he shouts. "Haw,
 haw!"

>throw water at macdougal
 (MacDougal)
 (first taking the water)
 Taken. MacDougal gasps. "The Great Troy Sterling done picked up an old
 bucket! Whatever can this mean? Haw, haw!"

 MacDougal prances about. "I eat all my vegetables! I do everything my
 mother tells me! That's why I have no friends except for my machines
 and my paid help! Haw haw!"

>pour water on macdougal
 (MacDougal)
 You heft the bucket in the air and dump it ceremoniously over
 MacDougal's head.

 The water trickles away and disappears.

 In a series of jerky motions that seem to call for a total lack of
 coordination, MacDougal staggers backwards all the way to the water
 trough, and somehow manages to fall in.

 The old men look up from their checkerboards. "That MacDougal don't
 know when to quit," says one of them, amused. The others murmur their
 assent.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>fill bucket
 (transferring water from the watering trough)
 You fill the old bucket.

 MacDougal drags himself out of the trough, water streaming from his
 clothes. "I'll get you, Sterling!" he shouts. "By this time next year,
 automobiles will be outlawed, all across the country!"

>cheer
 "Huzzah!" you shout.

 "The days of the automotive menace are numbered, Troy Sterling!
 Farmers and their animals will once again be safe on the roads!"
 shouts MacDougal, mounting his horse.

 Unfortunately for MacDougal, and for the dramatic scene he has so far
 managed to create, the jittery horse runs out from beneath him,
 sending him sprawling on the ground.

>laugh
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>smirk
 You pour on the charm, but don't get much of a reaction.

 MacDougal, understandably upset, runs after his horse. "Come back
 here!"

 The horse disappears into the woods, with MacDougal close behind.

>pour water on me
 Getting yourself wet might be fun, but would hardly accomplish
 anything useful.

>drink water
 You swallow a few sips.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 The rustic charm of Sneedlewood's estate provides an excellent
 backdrop for a daring and exciting motoring jaunt. The driveway curves
 southwest, towards the street. The professor's front door is to the
 north.

 In the Pratt Dynamo you can see Miss Sweet.

 A tweedy, bespectacled, balding man emerges from the house.

 "Miss Sweet, I presume?" he says. "I didn't expect you to arrive in
 the famous Pratt Dynamo."

 "I'm happy to have arrived at all," says Miss Sweet, in a perfectly
 innocent tone, but casting you a significant look.

 The Dynamo has started to steam again.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>give leaflet to sweet

 You have so far scored 18 out of a possible 42, in 186 turns.

 She takes the loose flyer and reads it. Her eyebrows climb. "My. You
 have a very... interesting profession, Mr. Sterling."
 Miss Sweet hesitates slightly, but responds with a gracious nod.

 "You'd better get that vehicle back to your friend, Mr. Pratt," says
 the professor. "It looks like it needs his attention."

 "Mr. Sterling," says Miss Sweet. "The right engine sounds about half a
 tone higher than the left engine. That may be why your automobile was
 pulling to the left as you came up the driveway."

>ask sweet about engines
 Miss Sweet shakes her head. "My specialty is music, Mr. Sterling, not
 automotive mechanics."

 "I didn't know you were so mechanically inclined, Miss Sweet," says
 Professor Sneedlewood, stroking his beard with bemusement.

 "I'm not," she says, and sings two notes, which sound exactly alike to
 you. "Couldn't you hear it? The dissonance was giving me a headache.
 It's my curse, I guess... I hear music in everything."

 "Of course," says Professor Sneedlewood. "That's precisely why I sent
 for you, my dear."

>say goodbye to sweet

 "Goodbye," she replies, showing good manners.

 "Please, Miss Sweet, let us sit down for a cup of tea," says
 Sneedlewood.

 "I'd be delighted, professor." she replies. On her way back inside,
 she turns around to nod politely in your direction. "Good day, Mr.
 Sterling."

 Sneedlewood grabs one handle of the trunk and drags it inside the
 doorway.

 The professor goes inside and shuts the door.
>knock on door

 Now you and the Dynamo are alone.

>cry
 Your outburst achieves little.

>enter car
 But you're already in the Pratt Dynamo.

>go south

 As you turn the Dynamo towards the open road once again, you ponder
 your next step. The motors roar thrillingly...








 Chapter 2: A Melodious Accompaniment

 The lopsided sound of Mr. Sterling's automobile recedes into the
 distance.

 After a chance to change and refresh yourself, you're enjoying a nice
 cup of tea with the professor, in his...

 Front Parlor
 The walls are heavy with green and maroon hangings. Some photographs
 are arranged on the wall, above an old upright piano. The foyer is
 visible to the east.
>examine me
 ...
 The professor smiles at you from across the tea table.

 "I hope you'll forgive me for lodging you in the guest cottage, Miss
 Sweet. My man Montgomery insisted the upstairs rooms are suitable only
 for old bachelors," he says. "I'm delighted that you accepted my
 invitation, vague as it was."

>examine me
 You're Melody Sweet, the world-renowned opera singer. You're feeling
 more impatient than usual, but otherwise you're holding up well. You
 are carrying a loose flyer, a coin, a small sign and a purse.

 "I am honoured to entrust you with information very precious,
 concerning an artifact of ancient origin," the professor continues,
 his eyes gleaming. "Because of your vocal accomplishments, and your
 ancestral relationship to the indigenous peoples of Central America, I
 am convinced me that *you* are the key to the riddle of the Nisnoc Siw
 people."

>examine sign
 A small, hand-lettered sign that reads, "Miss Sweat". (The "a" is
 squeezed in as an afterthought.)

 How charmingly, authentically rustic.

 "Only one of my colleagues has ever believed my theories about the
 Nisnoc Siw. Unfortunately, he went mad fifteen years ago," says the
 professor, with a rueful smile. "Many still debate whether his faith
 caused the madness, or vice versa."

>ask professor about artifact

 "At any rate, I've found my life's work to be unpublishable. If I were
 less well-mannered, this is probably the point where I would shake my
 fist and shout, 'Fools! I shall crush them all!'"

 Sneedlewood heaves a heart-rending sigh. "But instead..."

 "One moment, and I shall retrieve the artifact for you," says
 Sneedlewood, leaping to his feet. "I think you'll find it
 fascinating."

 Prof. Sneedlewood goes east.

>examine photographs
 One photograph shows a shambles of masonry which might once have been
 a burial pyramid. In the foreground are two men -- one man is
 Professor Sneedlewood, as he might have appeared thirty years ago. The
 other is apparently a colleague, but his face is entirely in shadow.

 The rest of the photographs show different scenes from what appears to
 be the same archeological site.
>sip tea

 A spot of tea might be refreshing under ordinary circumstances -- but
 today seems less and less ordinary every minute.

>sing
 (warming up)
 You sing middle C.

 The professor enters from the foyer and settles back into his seat.

 He is carrying his precious artifact.

>examine artifact
 Something like a slender brick. Its surface is pitted and flaky, like
 some kind of shale. Some strange markings are barely visible, running
 around all the edges.

 The professor holds the rock-like object up to the light.

 "I found this in an Aztec ruin. But these inscriptions aren't Aztec --
 they're some kind of musical notation, dating from a much older
 culture -- most likely the Nisnoc Siw, although without additional
 evidence, I am unlikely to convince my colleagues. My guess is that
 this particular item was acquired by the Aztecs in trade, or perhaps
 unearthed by Aztec archeologists -- amateurs, of course."

>sing
>examine markings
 If the professor is right, and the strange patterns on the artifact
 have something to do with music, then they aren't like any kind of
 musical notation you've seen before.

 "This artifact has enabled me to identify the Nisnoc Siw with the
 legendary music-makers of quite a number of indigenous cultures across
 the Americas," says the professor. "But aside from the music-making
 mythologies we can cobble together, this artifact, with its
 inscriptions, is all we know of the Nisnoc Siw."

>ask professor about photographs
 "So the photographs from my past intrigue you? Shortly after these
 were taken, my closest colleague and I had something of a falling
 out," says the professor. "We've recently gotten back in touch,
 despite my reservations, in connection with the opening of the new
 Central American antiquities exhibit at my university, you see.

 "I keep this little display as a memento of better times... and also a
 reminder of what madness can do to a man's soul."

 "Take it, Miss Sweet," he says, gazing lovingly at the artifact.

>ask professor about colleague
 "Ah, yes... My old friend, the dastardly Count Catastrophe," mutters
 the professor, momentarily troubled. "Never mind him. We've more
 important matters to tend to."

 The professor holds the artifact out to you, his eyes brimming with
 gratitude, his face a trembling mask.

>take artifact
 As you take the artifact, the professor beams. "It is yours, Miss
 Sweet," he says. "Use it, to bring to life the music that has been
 silent for thousands of years."

 The professor leans forward excitedly. "On my first trip to Central
 Mexico, our native guide sang a few bars of something he remembered
 his grandmother singing whenever she boiled water. His cousin
 remembered a similar tune; she called it the 'stone-soup song'."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>ask professor about stone-soup song
 "Quite, quite," says the professor, ever agreeable, if occasionally
 inattentive.

 "I later found parts of the same tune in a Brazilian goatherd song, a
 Chilean lullaby, and even a hymn written by a Carmelite nun who spent
 thirty years as a missionary among the Navaho. This tune must be
 deeply imbedded in the collective memory of the native peoples of
 America."

>listen to professor
 Calling forth your most eager, attentive expression, you await the
 professor's next words.

 "Using the variations in the folk tune as a kind of Rosetta stone, I
 managed to work out a basic musical notation system," says the
 professor. "It matches the markings on that artifact surprisingly
 well. I've come to believe that the artifact describes a long-lost
 musical composition of great ritualistic value."

 The professor grasps his lapels, a distant look in his eye, and slips
 into lecture mode: "Determining the exact nature of the connection is
 a matter of mapping a strange and wondrous landscape, interpreting and
 applying information from a wide variety of arcane and incomplete
 reference materials, completing side-quests in order to gain the trust
 of assorted simple-minded characters who just so happen to be posted
 at various important junctures, recording and cross-referencing a
 large number of unfamiliar symbols, and determining the meaning of
 each through a rigorous process of inductive reasoning."

>yawn
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>listen to professor
 Calling forth your most eager, attentive expression, you await the
 professor's next words.

 "Of course, I performed all that tedious legwork years ago as a
 graduate student," says the professor, winking playfully at you. "I'll
 be happy to share all my findings with you -- just as soon as I finish
 my tea."

 He raises his cup. "To success!"
>drink tea
 ...
 The professor swallows heartily.

 Suddenly, he slumps forward, groaning. One hand clutches frantically
 at his heart, the other slams the table.
>undo
 ...
 He throws his head back, revealing an ashen face, his eyes wide with
 terror.
>faint
 ...
 He draws a raspy, painful breath. His lips part, as he strains -- with
 gut-wrenching effort -- to divulge some utterance of vital importance.
>kiss professor
 ...
 *Bu-u-r-p!*
>say "If only you drink coffee!"
 ...
 "Excuse me, Miss Sweet," he says, tapping himself in the chest. "Bit
 of heartburn."

 He cheerfully reaches under the tea table and produces a
 heavily-annotated copybook. "It's all written down here for you."

>kill professor
 A diva's temper, while fearsome when unleashed, wouldn't be helpful in
 this situation.

 The professor slides his copybook over towards you.

>examine copybook
 (first taking the copybook)
 You take the copybook. The professor smiles benevolently. "Good,
 good!"
>push space
 As you open the copybook, some newspaper clippings fall out into your
 hands...

 The professor's copybook is carefully lettered, in a blocky, masculine
 hand.

 Each page is divided up into two columns -- ordinary musical notation
 on the right, and a strange set of symbols on the left. Together, they
 form a simple and effective tutorial (somewhat marred by rather long
 stretches of dry academic commentary) illustrating the Nisnoc Siw's
 system for depicting pitch, duration, rests, and tempo.

 Thanks to the professor's tutorial, you have at least a basic
 knowledge of how to sing Nisnoc Siw musical symbols.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine artifact
 Something like a slender brick. Its surface is pitted and flaky, like
 some kind of shale. Some strange markings are barely visible, running
 around all the edges.

>examine markings
 If the professor is right, and the strange patterns on the artifact
 have something to do with music, then they aren't like any kind of
 musical notation you've seen before.

>sing markings
 The professor leans forward excitedly. "I hope the tutorial in the
 copybook was clear enough," he says. "These symbols describe a
 five-tone octave, with seven beats per measure -- two pairs, followed
 by one group of three." He reaches over to point to one prominent
 symbol. "That's a C sharp."

 You manage to pick out a short musical passage inscribed on the
 artifact, including one featuring a musical tension between low,
 repetitive clusters and longer, higher notes. But almost as soon as
 you grasp the sense of the notes, you lose it, trailing off
 uncertainly.

 "An excellent attempt, Miss Sweet," says the professor, a bit hastily.
 "You may be more comfortable playing it on the piano, at this point."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine piano

 Hmm. There seems to be a manuscript of some sort, propped on the
 piano...

 It's just an ordinary piano, with a simple matching bench.

>examine manuscript
 The manuscript is labeled "Stone Soup Folk Melody" in blocky masculine
 lettering. There appear to be seven beats per measure, which is odd
 enough... but the score also shows a strange sequence of notes,
 ranging from a low C to a high E. Surely the professor knows this is
 out of your range. And that D! How does he expect anyone to sing it
 for eight full measures?

 The professor is grinning like a schoolboy. What's the matter with
 him? Playing this on the piano is one thing -- but singing it? Doesn't
 he know this is impossible?

>play piano
 You play a few random chords on the piano. It sounds a little tinny,
 but is reasonably well tuned.

>play markings
 Thanks to the professor's excellent primer, you manage to translate
 the ancient notes inscribed on the artifact, and play them reasonably
 well. The tune is most curious.

 As the tinny sounds of the piano fade, you hear a strange, muffled
 resonance emanating from the artifact -- but the sound fades almost
 immediately.

>manuscript
 You try out the first few bars of the haunting, almost hypnotic
 theme... but towards the middle of the manuscript, the notes climb
 until they are completely out of your range. The professor must have a
 great deal of faith in you, or must be completely ignorant of the
 physiological characteristics of the human voice, if he expects you to
 be able to sing this all the way through.

 "Excellent try, Miss Sweet," says the professor, a bit too hastily.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 The professor reaches over and takes your hand. "I can't begin to tell
 you how much your presence here means to me."

 "Now, if you don't mind, I believe I shall retire to my room for my
 customary nap. I've sent my man, Montgomery, out on an errand -- but
 he should be back shortly. He's been instructed to get you whatever
 you may need.

 "It has been a great pleasure to meet you, Miss Sweet," says the
 professor. "I have little choice but to trust you perfectly with the
 artifact, Miss Sweet, since you're the only one who can make use of
 it. But would you please give me the copybook? I wouldn't want it to
 fall into the wrong hands."

>turn manuscript
 Nothing obvious happens.

 The professor waits patiently for the copybook.

>put stone on piano
 You need to be holding the manuscript before you can put it on top of
 something else.

 The professor, looks somewhat puzzled.

>give copybook to professor
 The professor accepts it gratefully. "I'll put this in a safe place,"
 he says.

 "Now if you'll excuse me, Miss Sweet," he says.

 He strolls out of the room, humming something to himself -- something
 very strange, and very old.

 a sunbeam, in which is nestled a droopy-eared puppy wearing around its

 Chapter 3: A Miscued Rescue or Two

 Ah... nothing like a leisurely walk in the woods, following a morning
 of rigorous drilling in such automotive daredevil tricks as starting
 on an incline and backing into a parking space.

 "You only choked up the engine twice this time, Mr Sterling," Aloysius
 is saying. "That's a great improvement."

>examine me
 As luck [and plot contrivance] would have it, your stroll through the
 woods brings you to a...

 Wooded Rise
 This wooded rise overlooks the front yard of Sneedlewood's estate,
 which is visible to the north. A faint path leads southwest.

 You can see Aloysius here.

 Peering through the thicket of trees, you can someone approaching the
 front door to Sneedlewood's residence. It is the same short stranger
 who bumped into a child in town this morning.

>examine me
 You're Troy Sterling, daredevil adventurer. Or you will be, as soon as
 you master all this technical stuff and get on with the daredeviling
 part.

 The short stranger rings the doorbell. He looks around anxiously, and
 then peers in a window.

 "Why that... that looks like..." mutters Aloysius.

 The man reaches up towards his face and... eww! He seems to have
 pulled a glass eye out of its socket.

 "That's Salomonder!" says Aloysius. "What the devil would the
 professor want with a worm like him?"

 After a few moments, Professor Sneedlewood appears in the doorway,
 yawning. Salomonder speaks with him inaudibly, casually replacing the
 eye in its socket.

>examine salomonder

 You can't make out many details from way up here.

 Sneedlewood peers around nervously, lets Salomonder inside, and shuts
 the door.

>ask aloysius about salomonder
 "I knew him when I was boy," says Alyosius. "Tough little kid, from
 the wrong side of town, you might say -- same as me. But he was good
 with his hands, so we used to build go-carts together.

 "One day, we were racing. He tried to pass me, but wrecked. Lost an
 eye."

 What was that carried by the wind? A scream, from somewhere off to the
 east, sounding not unlike a woman in distress!

 "I don't like the looks of this, Mr. Sterling. I doubt Salomonder came
 alone."

 Aloysius frowns thoughtfully. "This is probably the part where the
 faithful sidekick gets captured and beaten up, thereby motivating you
 to delve deeper into the mystery. Maybe we should just skip that and
 start investigating now. You circle around to the east. I'll see what
 Salomonder's up to."

>go east

 "Good. It's probably a lot more heroic in that direction, anyway,"
 says Aloysius.
 "You don't need that, Mr. Sterling," says Aloysius, taking the
 detached wheel from you.

 thicket. A paved stone path leads north.

 Thick woods surround this small forest clearing. Down the path leading
 west, you can glimpse part of the main house. A yard is to the north.
 To the south, a gap in the bushes leads into a thicket.

 Smoke pours from the roof of a rustic cottage on the eastern edge of
 the clearing. The simple wooden door is closed.

 From inside the cottage, you hear a high-pitched scream! Definitely
 feminine, and obviously in distress.

 A frantic scratching sound comes from the other side of the cottage
 door.

>kick down door

>kick door
 A modern, twentieth-century man has little need to commit an act of

 extremely agitated tabby cat; then it disappears into the bushes.

 I? What are you doing?" she demands.

 She doesn't seem to realise the danger she was in.

 "Mr. Sterling, perhaps you'd better tell me what prompted you to this
 course of action," she says, attempting to compose herself.

 Perhaps you'd better tell her about the rescue.

 Miss Sweet composes herself for a moment, takes a deep breath, and
 unleashes a scream. Not any ordinary scream, mind you -- an operatic
 shriek of nerve-rattling, bone-chilling, eardrum-popping proportions.

 [Your score has just gone down by one point.]

>tell sweet about rescue
 Miss Sweet bursts out in laughter. "How bold and daring of you to
 snatch me away from my fiery tomb! But I'm afraid that the only smoke
 I see is from the little fire I made in the stove!"

 "O! WOE IS ME!" Miss Sweet shouts -- or, rather -- sings.

>tell sweet about undying love

 Miss Sweet is not about to be distracted.

 Suddenly, Miss Sweet stops. The color drains from her face, as she
 points behind you. When you turn around, you find yourself staring
 down the barrel of a revolver.

 Salomonder, holding the gun, regards you with a wry grin.

 [Your score has just gone down by one point.]

>kiss salomonder
 "Ah, the famous Mr. Sterling...  In the audience for a change. This
 private little performance has been... cancelled."

>fight salomonder
 Salomonder raises the revolver. "Tut tut, Mr. Sterling."

 Salomonder laughs darkly. "Please raise your hands, Mr. Sterling."

>inventory
 Salomonder raises the revolver. "Tut tut, Mr. Sterling."

 Salomonder's mirthless smile becomes cold. "I shall not ask you again,
 Mr. Sterling."

>notify on

>raise hands

 "Oh, very well," he sighs, aiming the gun testily...

 Hmm. Now that the thrill of the rescue is fading, you're beginning to
 feel a bit awkward carrying her around like this.

>go west

 Pleasant Clearing
 Thick woods surround this small forest clearing. Down the path leading
 west, you can glimpse part of the main house. A yard is to the north.
 To the south, a gap in the bushes leads into a thicket.

 The cottage door lies open to the east.

>drop sweet
 You carefully put Miss Sweet down.

>wake sweet
 Aware that the slightest shock to her womanly operatic constitution
 may cause her to launch into an interminable and painful death aria,
 you gently rouse her.

 Miss Sweet emerges from her swoon, and looks around crossly. "Where am
 I? What are you doing?" she demands.

 She doesn't seem to realise the danger she was in.

>tell sweet about fire
 Miss Sweet bursts out in laughter. "How bold and daring of you to
 snatch me away from my fiery tomb! But I'm afraid that the only smoke

>tell sweet about cat
 Miss Sweet's eyebrow edges upwards. "I really don't know what to say
 about that," she says.

 "Rest assured," says Miss Sweet, pausing to choose her words
 carefully, "my gratitude is duly proportionate to the value of the
 service you have rendered."

>tell sweet about scream
 "But I was in no danger. I was merely warming up my voice!" she says.
 "And as for the smoke, have you examined the chimney?"

 "I will bid you good-day, Mr. Sterling," she says, turning to go. As
 she does so, she stumbles, and starts to fall.

>catch sweet
 You manage to prevent her from losing her footing.

 Her cheeks redden. "Please excuse me," she says, trying to regaining
 her balance.

 There is an awkward moment of silence, as you both watch the lazy path
 a bumblebee makes along the edge of the woods.

 The bee whirls furiously around your head, and then suddenly breaks

 "I suppose you really did believe I was in danger. Your actions,
 though ludicrously unnecessary, were nevertheless thoughtful."

>f yes

 That was a rhetorical question.

 She sighs. "Once again, I find myself in your debt."

>smirk
 Miss Sweet hesitates slightly, but responds with a gracious nod.

 From high over your head, you hear an angry buzzing noise -- faint but
 growing louder. It can be nothing other than your winged tormentor,
 bent on inflicting great bodily harm!

 Miss Sweet goes east.

 This is a grassy stretch just east of the vine-covered house. A

 You can also see some leaves and twigs here.

 You manage to climb up the trellis, crushing only a few roses in the

 On the Roof
 You are on the roof of the lower storey. It slopes up to a brick wall,
 which forms part of the upper storey.

 Nearby is a skylight.

>open skylight

 It appears to be stuck. Perhaps if you got a hairpin from Miss Sweet,
 and used a mixture of saliva and earwax as a lubricant -- Bah! You
 have no time to waste on such trifles!!

>break skylight

 Heroically, you leap through the skylight feet first, intending to hit
 the floor and roll to absorb the impact. That plan doesn't work out
 very well, because you end up flat on your back, sprawled across
 broken furniture.

 As you shake the stars out of your eyes, you find yourself staring

 Chapter 4: The Evil Eye

 The vile little greasy man bows to you most obsequiously. "Miss
 Sweet," he says. "Now that the indubitable professor Sneedlewood and
 the redoubtable inventor Mr. Pratt have been joined in captivity by
 the very doubtable Mr. Sterling, I suggest that you and I have a
 little chat. Won't you come this way?"
>shriek
 ...
 Along with the other captives, you are bound and gagged on the floor.

 Cellar
 You are in a musty corner of the cellar, almost bare of furnishings
 but for a simple wooden table. A high shelf blocks much of the light
 coming in through a single tiny window, which is partly open, but
 barred. The exit is east.

 On the work table are a tin pot (which is empty), some leaves and
 twigs, some newspaper clippings, a letter opener, a manuscript, an old
 bucket (which is empty), a small sign, a postcard, a scarf, a peaked
 riding cap, some goggles, an index card, some gloves, a loose flyer, a
 handkerchief, a programme, a coin, a purse (which is empty) and an
 artifact.

 You can see Salomonder, Prof. Sneedlewood, Mr. Sterling and Mr. Pratt
 here.

 "Something about a cold, damp cellar makes me feel much better about
 holding captives," he says. "When I'm in a well-stocked laboratory, or
 a comfortable drawing room, I tend to hesitate when my profession
 requires the occasional brutish act. But here..." Salomonder glances
 around the dreary cellar, and breathes deeply. "Here, I feel more at
 ease."

 An orange tabby saunters into the room.

 I beg your pardon?

>shriek
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>scream
 You strain against the ropes, but your efforts are futile.

 Salomonder rubs his hands together. "Now, I must go about the business
 of having you killed."

 Salomonder picks up a jar from the shelf. "Peach preserves," he says,
 inspecting it approvingly. "My favourite."

 He smiles down at you. "My dear Miss Sweet," he says, with a wistful
 smile. "You've already glimpsed the power of the artifact, but you've
 no inkling of its true power." He crouches down beside you. "Aren't
 you curious? Wouldn't you like to know a little more about it?"

>sing
 The gag stifles your voice, all but for a muffled moan.

 The cat sneezes at Salomonder.

 "Come, Miss Sweet. This is no time to be coy. Do you want to help
 me... and yourself?"

>nod
 (nodding your head)

 Salomonder nods. "Very good."

 He removes your gag, with a fumbling attempt at gentleness. "Now, Miss
 Sweet. Ask me about anything at all."

 The cat sits and stares at Salomonder.

>ask salomonder about salomonder
 The artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "The squash -- the
 squash are ripe."

 You hear yourself laugh. "Behold, I come, with powers renewed and
 vital. Adore me!"

 Mr. Pratt and Mr. Sterling exchange bewildered glances, while the
 professor stares with wide-eyed horror.
>push space
 ...
 Salomonder gloats. "Professor... I see that you recognise the voice of
 High Priestess Anootla. You must know, therefore, that the prophecy
 will be fulfilled on schedule -- with or without your cooperation."

 "As you can see, the artifact is now fully charged. As vital as you
 were to begin the process, Miss Sweet, I'm afraid that you are now as
 expendable as your friends here."

 Salomonder picks up the artifact and brings it over to the professor.
 "Professor, you might be interested in this -- thanks to the lovely
 lady's vocal talents, a whole new set of markings has appeared on the
 artifact."

 As the professor strains to read the markings, Salomonder jerks the
 artifact away almost immediately.
>push space
 ...
 With a wry smile, Salomonder removes the professor's gag.

 The professor sputters, enraged. "You can't deny me this! I've spent
 my whole life on this quest!"

 The cat nuzzles the professor affectionately.

>scream
 You strain against the ropes, but your efforts are futile.

 Salomonder sighs moodily. He produces an envelope. "This, Professor
 Sneedlewood, is a message from a dear old friend of yours -- Count
 Catastrophe."

 What little color is left in the professor's face drains away.

 Salomonder brandishes the ivory-handled letter opener, and slices open
 the envelope.

 The cat nuzzles the professor affectionately.

>sing
 As you begin to sing, the artifact pulses with fierce red energy. The
 artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "The hour approaches."

 Salomonder reads from the letter: "My dear Barnaby. I write to you
 from behind the scenes at the Central American antiquities exhibit,
 where I have prepared a little surprise for the dignitaries who will
 be gathering here shortly. As the prophecy foretells, the one who
 completes the ritual will consort eternally with absolute power. By
 the time you read this letter, Miss Sweet's lovely voice will have
 charged the artifact. The ritual will be completed, on schedule, at
 sunset tonight."

 The professor interrupts. "Salomonder, you fool! Can't you see that
 he's mad?"

 Salomonder waves the professor off, irritated. He continues reading:
 "Barnaby, I am not a bloodthirsty man. I shall spare your lives -- but
 only if you agree to my demands, chief among which being sole credit
 for the discoveries I am about to introduce to the world."

 "Never!" interrupts the professor. "I'll not be a pawn in
 Catastrophe's mad game!"

 The cat sits and stares at Salomonder.

>eat coin
 (first taking the coin)
 You strain against the ropes, but your efforts are futile.

 Salomonder continues: "In the likely event that your pride will not
 allow you to submit to my demands, I shall have to rely upon
 Salomonder to eliminate you in whatever way he sees fit. I regret this
 course of action... but deep in your heart, I think we both know that,
 if you had the chance, you'd do the same thing to me."

 "No!" shouts the professor, a bit too quickly.

 Salomonder folds the letter. "Tsk, tsk, Professor. Whatever his faults
 may be, you must admit that Count Catastrophe is an excellent judge of
 character."

 The cat nuzzles the professor affectionately.

 Salomonder picks up the artifact, and strides out with it.

>sing
 You project towards the open window.

 Through it, you hear a distant musical echo.
 The professor sulks, utterly dejected.

 The cat scratches at a table leg.

 You can hear Salomonder's footsteps creaking up the stairs. The jars
 on the shelf resonate musically.

>sing to jars
 For some reason, that got mixed up in your head. (Try a synonym, or a
 different strategy.)

>sing
 (warming up)
 You sing high B.

 The cat sits pensively in a corner.

>listen to jars
 From time to time, the jars clink together, resounding with a fairly
 uniform C sharp pitch.

 The cat crawls familiarly across the professor's lap.

 Heavy footsteps thump down the stairs. The jars on the shelf resonate
 musically.

 A man dressed for outdoor work enters. He carries a small keg of some
 kind.

 The professor, obviously recognizing him, perks up and cries,
 "Montgomery!"

 "I hate to break up this little reunion," says Salomonder, strutting
 back into the room, "but Montgomery and I have work to do."

>sing high e
 As you begin to sing, the artifact pulses with fierce red energy. The
 artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "Hear the voice of the
 spider languishing on the rock."

 The cat sneezes at Salomonder.

 As Salomonder watches dispassionately, Montgomery uncorks his keg and
 lays down a line of black powder.

 Something feathery flutters against the window.

>sing c sharp
 As you begin to sing, the artifact pulses with fierce red energy. The
 artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "The plover -- the
 plover is dying, and the mushrooms are foul."

 The cat crawls familiarly across the professor's lap.

 Moving deliberately but very stiffly, Montgomery pours a small mound
 of powder in the far corner, and leaves the keg on top of it.

 The professor calls out to him again.

 Montgomery makes eye contact with the professor, staring
 uncomprehendingly.

 Salomonder laughs ruefully. "No use trying, professor," he says,
 leaning against the table.

>sing high c
 As you begin to sing, the artifact pulses with fierce red energy. The
 artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "The gander's mate is
 untamed as it pursues the crimson riverflesh."

 The cat sneezes at Salomonder.

 "Thank you, Montgomery," says Salomonder. "You may go."

 Salomonder watches him leave. "The Count is so very thorough when he
 sets out to bend weak minds to do his will," he says, thoughtfully.

 Salomonder puts the gag back on the professor. "I've heard quite
 enough from you," he says.

 "What shall I do with you, my friends?" asks Salomonder, pacing.

>sing stone soup
 As you begin to sing, the artifact pulses with fierce red energy. The
 artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "The stars fill the sky
 with the shining purity of destruction."

 The cat sits and stares at Salomonder.

 Salomonder sighs. "There's never a good sawmill with a slow-moving
 conveyor belt around when you need one."

 Behind Salomonder's back, Mr. Sterling begins to contort his body,
 trying to twist out of the ropes.

>sing middle c
 As you begin to sing, the artifact pulses with fierce red energy. The
 artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "The moon -- the moon
 drips with blood."

 The cat sneezes at Salomonder.

>kick jars
 You have just enough slack in the ropes to manage a short jab with
 your foot. Unfortunately, you're tied too tightly to reach the peach
 preserves.

 The cat nuzzles the professor affectionately.

>kick cat
 Salomonder reaches up casually towards his face. "To keep track of
 everything going on down here, I would almost need..." He whips his
 hand around behind his neck, and holds a small round object
 there..."An eye on the back of my head!"

 Mr. Sterling freezes in dismay, one shoulder partially out of a coil
 of rope.

>examine eye
 The light glints menacingly off of Salomonder's glass eye.

 The cat hops onto the shelf, causing the jars to clatter musically.

 "Hi there!" says Salomonder, in a strange little falsetto. "I'm Mr.
 Salomonder's magic eyeball!"

 Salomonder addresses his eye with exaggerated seriousness. "What do
 you see back there, little fellow?"

 Salomonder makes his eye jump up and down excitedly in the air. "It's
 Troy Sterling, Mr. Salomonder! He was trying to untie himself while
 you weren't looking, Mr. Salomonder! Better tie him up again!"

 Salomonder smiles. "I've taught you well!" he says, stroking his eye
 affectionately. "Good eye!"

>look

 Cellar
 You are in a musty corner of the cellar, almost bare of furnishings
 but for a simple wooden table. A high shelf blocks much of the light
 coming in through a single tiny window, which is partly open, but
 barred. The exit is east.

 On the shelf is a cat.

 On the work table are a letter opener, a tin pot (which is empty),
 some leaves and twigs, some newspaper clippings, a manuscript, an old
 bucket (which is empty), a small sign, a postcard, a scarf, a peaked
 riding cap, some goggles, an index card, some gloves, a loose flyer, a
 handkerchief, a programme, a coin and a purse (which is empty).

 You can see a mound of powder (on which is a powder keg), a line of
 powder, Salomonder, Prof. Sneedlewood, Mr. Sterling and Mr. Pratt
 here.

 Mr. Pratt wrestles with his ropes.

 The cat jumps onto the window ledge.

>kick table
 Salomonder makes the falsetto "eye" voice again: "Thank you, Mr.
 Salomonder! You always said I was your favourite...pupil!"
 ...
 Salomonder ties Mr. Sterling up again, this time very tightly.

 "Don't try to escape again," says Salomonder. He holds the eye
 momentarily on top of Mr. Sterling's head. "Remember...I've got my eye
 on you!"

 Mr. Pratt struggles furiously at his ropes. He seems to be attempting
 to slam his own head into the wall.

>untie ropes
 You strain against the ropes, but your efforts are futile.

 The cat bounds onto the table.

 Salomonder paces, surveying the room. "I thought my wit would go over
 better than this," he says. "After all, I have a captive audience."

 Salomonder nervously bounces his eyeball on the tabletop. (It resounds
 with a high E.)

>laugh
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sing high e
 As you begin to sing, the artifact pulses with fierce red energy. The
 artifact seems to pull a strange sound out of your throat. In an
 otherworldly voice, you hear yourself saying: "The plover -- the
 plover is dying, and the mushrooms are foul."

 The cat, prowling about on the tabletop, swats playfully at the letter
 opener.

>signal to cat
 "You will soon learn to appreciate my wit," continues Salomonder,
 working himself almost into a frenzy. "In fact, my very next spark of
 brilliance could very well......bring down the house!"

 In the distance to the north, you can hear the distant whistle of a
 train. Salomonder cups his hand to his ear. "Ah. That sound means it's
 time for me to leave. The Count is expecting me at the museum. The
 business we plan to conduct there, Miss Sweet, is enough to leave you
 speechless... for the rest of your life!

 "But don't fret. Soon all your worries will be over. I'd like to thank
 each of you for being my worthy opponents today," he says, fishing
 into his pocket, and extracting a small wooden stick from a box. "In
 light of what's about to happen, I think it's safe to say that you
 have all met your match!"
 ...
 In one sweeping gesture, Salomonder strikes a match, drops it onto the
 line of powder, and runs out the door.

 The professor shouts desperately into his gag.

 You hear Salomonder's footsteps pounding up the stairs and receding.
 The row of jars clatter together musically.

>sing c sharp
 You sing the note. The rows of peach preserves begin to rattle --
 resonating to the sound of your voice... Suddenly, several jars burst
 apart. Peach juice, pulp, and glass fragments bounce and splatter on
 the floor. One glass shard almost hits your foot.

 The professor looks on in joyful amazement. The fuse has gone out!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>get shard
 Although the glass fragment is very near your foot, you're tied too
 tightly to pick it up.

 The cat approaches the peachy gunk, sniffs it warily, and snorts.

 You have just enough slack in the ropes to manage a short jab with
 your foot. The glass fragment skitters across the room, and comes to a
 stop near Mr. Sterling!

 Mr. Sterling reaches out with his foot, struggling to hook the glass
 fragment.

 The cat stalks over to Mr. Pratt, and crawls onto his lap.

 Once again, you hear the train whistle. This time it is much closer,
 coming from the west side of the house.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>sing high e

 That note's too high for you, even on your best days.


 From outside the open window, a warbling voice answers. In a flutter
 of little wings, the nutfinch lands just outside the window.

 Mr. Sterling hooks the glass fragment, and carefully pushes it over to
 Mr. Pratt, who, rolling over onto his side, manages to pick it up with
 the fingers of one hand.

>sing
 You sing a wordless fragment of melody.

 The little nutfinch listens with some interest, but only chirps
 tenatively, casting a wary glance towards the cat.

 The cat looks at the bird thoughtfully for a moment. Yawning, it
 casually head-butts Mr. Pratt.

 Mr. Pratt, at last free from the cat's meddlesome influence, finally
 manages to get the glass fragment.

 The other captives look on with hopeful expressions, as Mr. Pratt
 works on his ropes.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>sing stone soup
 You sing a wordless fragment of melody.

 The little nutfinch listens with some interest, but only chirps
 tenatively, casting a wary glance towards the cat.

 Mr. Pratt manages to free one hand, and quickly tugs off his gag.
 "Thanks for distracting the cat, Miss Sweet!" he says.

 In the distance, on the south side of the house, you hear the train
 whistle.

 The professor mumbles urgently into his gag. Mr. Pratt rushes to
 uncover his mouth.

 "The evening express!" cries the professor, his face beaded with
 sweat. "If Salomonder catches that train, and brings his plunder to
 the antiquities exhibit before we can stop him, Miss Sweet may never
 again be free of Anootla's influence!"

 "Salomonder's not going anywhere," says Mr. Pratt, as he cuts through
 Mr. Sterling's ropes. "That's the Douglas Special you just heard,
 heading back to the station after its last run. Why, Salomonder would
 need a locomotive of his own to make it to the station in time to get
 aboard. Isn't that right, boss?"

 Mr. Pratt and Mr. Sterling share a hearty masculine laugh.

 Mr. Sterling throws off the last of his ropes. With a winning grin, he
 crouches beside you and starts untying your wrists.

>kiss sterling
 You strain against the ropes, but they are only partly untied at this
 stage.

 Mr. Pratt continues to reassure the professor, who is breathing rather
 heavily. "Professor, our friend Salomonder would need mighty fast
 transportation, if he thinks he can make it to the train station ahead
 of the Douglas Special. He'd need the fastest horse that ever lived.
 Or a pair of wings. Either that, or -- "

 Through the open window, you hear a calliope churning out an Oriental
 gong rendition of "Three Blind Mice."

>sing three blind mice
 Mr. Pratt and Mr. Sterling exchange a horrified glance... Sterling
 drops your half-tied wrists, and bolts out of the cellar. You can hear
 his leaden feet clomping up the stairs.

 Mr. Pratt begins to follow Mr. Sterling, but hesitates, and comes
 back. "Here, let me untie you, Miss Sweet. Are you alright?"

 Just outside the open window, the nutfinch cocks its head this way and
 that.

 The cat takes a second look at the bird, but evidently concludes that
 the bird is too far away to bother with it.

>no
 (shaking your head)

 Mr. Pratt's face clouds. "That scoundrel. I can't abide a man who
 mistreats a lady."

 You hear Mr. Sterling's clomping feet suddenly stop. Then you hear him
 coming back down the stairs. He sprints back into the room and dashes
 over to the table.

 He snaps his goggles jauntily over his head.

 Mr. Pratt rolls his eyes. "Oh, for Pete's sake!"

>wait
 Time passes.

 Mr. Sterling throws his scarf around his neck, flashing a winning
 grin.

 Mr. Pratt hurriedly finishes untying you. Casting a sour look at Mr.
 Sterling, he charges for the exit, grumbling. His footsteps pound up
 the stairs.

 "Oh, dear," says the professor. He looks very pale and weak.

>stand

 You're standing up now.

 Mr. Sterling puts on his cap. "Huzzah!" he cries.

 The next thing you know, you find yourself staring down the barrel of
 a revolver.

 You are in a musty corner of the cellar, almost bare of furnishings

 coming in through a single tiny window, which is partly open, but
 barred. The exit is east.

 On the work table are a letter opener, a tin pot (which is empty),
 some leaves and twigs, some newspaper clippings, a manuscript, an old
 bucket (which is empty), a small sign, a postcard, an index card, some
 gloves, a loose flyer, a handkerchief, a programme, a coin and a purse
 (which is empty).

 You can see Mr. Sterling, some peach gunk and Prof. Sneedlewood here.

 Mr. Sterling slips his gloves on.

 The professor is breathing heavily, trying to get up.

 Mr. Sterling flashes you a brilliant grin, and charges up the stairs.

 "I'm not as young as I once was, you know," the professor says,
 pausing to rest.

>sing c sharp
 You sing a soothing, uplifting melody.

 The nutfinch, adding its little voice to yours, hops through the bars
 of the window and onto the window ledge.

 "Miss Sweet... I don't see how you can ever forgive me for putting you
 through this, but perhaps I can figure out whether I can restore your
 voice," he says. "If I can get to my feet, that is."

 The tabby cat saunters back into the room.

>untie professor
 He's not something you can open.

 The professor sighs. "I shall have to get up myself, I suppose," he
 says.

>help professor
 The professor meekly holds out his hand.

>take hand
 (Prof. Sneedlewood)
 You help the professor to his feet.

 "Thank you, my dear," he says, lurching towards the table, his feet
 still unsteady.

 "Miss Sweet!" says the professor. "The new symbols that appeared on
 the artifact -- Salomonder showed them to me only for an instant, but
 look here -- there are faint markings on the table where the artifact
 was sitting. Scorch marks, I should say. If you would please fetch my
 copybook for me, I may be able to translate this new set of symbols."

>ask professor about copybook
>examine table
 You hear yourself saying: "The wind sings with longing for my return."

 "My dear girl -- you should save your voice," chides the professor,
 with gentle sadness. "You may need it later."

 "Where could my copybook have gone? I remember you handed it to me
 just before I went upstairs for my nap. But I can't recall what I did
 with it!"

 The simple work table is supported by blocky wooden legs.There is
 nothing on the work table.

 "Hurry, Miss Sweet! The marks are already fading. Please find me my

 Sneedlewood's Driveway
 This rural setting is certainly peaceful, but this far from the big
 city crowds, you can't help feeling a little isolated at the same
 time. A garden path leads east. A wooded hill rises to the south. The
 professor's front door is to the north.

 Once outside, you're treated to quite a sight.

 A grizzled country character canters around the front yard on a
 nervous-looking horse, taunting Mr. Sterling. "Whooeee! You knocked
 the wheel off my buggy this morning, Sterling, so I went and done a
 wheel-ectomy on your fancy automobile!" he shouts. Indeed, he is
 holding a steering wheel over his head. "Come and get it, goggle-boy!
 Haw, haw!"

 Mr. Sterling, bristling at the taunt, adjusts his goggles, tightens
 the scarf around his neck, and prepares to make a grab for it.

>distract character

 Waving the steering wheel over his head, the grizzled character sings:

 "Johnny O'Connor bought an automobile!
 He took his sweetheart for a ride one Sunday.
 Johnny was togged up in his best Sunday clothes.
 She nestled close to his side."

 Mr. Sterling grabs for the wheel, but the grizzled horseman spurs on
 his horse.

 You try out the first few bars of the haunting, almost hypnotic

 physiological characteristics of the human voice, if he expects you to
 be able to sing this all the way through.

 A colorful sculpture. Beneath a sparkling rainbow, a fluffy, white
 bunny rabbit peeps sleepily from behind a daffodil, and cocks its head
 quizzically at a pair of rosy-cheeked cherubim, who bear between them
 a sunbeam, in which is nestled a droopy-eared puppy wearing around its
 neck a large, heart-shaped medallion, on which, within a border of
 butterflies, is a crayon drawing of the Earth, around the
 circumference of which is a ring of shining happy people holding
 hands.

>break art
 The porcelain object shatters in a shining happy dust plume, which
 disappear to reveal a small silver heart that had been concealed
 inside.

 (yourself)
 You're Melody Sweet, the world-renowned opera singer. You're feeling
 more impatient than usual, but otherwise you're holding up well. You
 are carrying a silver locket, a pygmy statuette, a sordid elf of
 Great-Aunt Ickwiddy, an emerald the size of a plover's egg, a ring of
 keys, a purse, a coin, a programme, a handkerchief, a loose flyer, an
 index card, a postcard, a small sign, an old bucket, a manuscript,
 some newspaper clippings, some leaves and twigs, a tin pot and a
 letter opener.

 Secret Passage
 What eccentric professor's house would be complete without a secret
 passageway? This particular one is just a tiny space between the
 walls, but it will do. Sunlight spills around the corner from the
 east, but does not reach the dark alcove to the south.

>go east

 Side Yard
 This is a grassy stretch just east of the vine-covered house. A
 clearing lies south, a garden path leads southwest, and another path
 leads northwest, behind the house.

 A birdbath stands in the middle of the yard.

 The narrow door, partially hidden by a rose trellis, lies open to the
 west.

 The grizzled character arrives from the southwest.

 Waving the steering wheel over his head, the grizzled character sings:

 The lyrics are slurred and incomprehensible.

 Mr. Sterling arrives from the southwest.

>examine birdbath
 The birdbath is a statue of a woman holding a shallow brass basin.

 In the brass basin is some bathwater.

 Waving the steering wheel over his head, the grizzled character sings:

 "Johnny O'Connor bought an automobile!
 He took his sweetheart for a ride one Sunday.
 Johnny was togged up in his best Sunday clothes.
 She nestled close to his side."

 Mr. Sterling, his eyes fixed on the steering wheel, prepares to leap
 again.

>get steering wheel
 It's no good -- the jittery horse won't let you get close enough to
 try to grab the wheel.

 Waving the steering wheel over his head, the grizzled character sings:

 "Things went just dandy till he got down the road,
 Then something happened to the old machinery.
 That engine got his goat... off went his hat and coat...
 Ev'rything needed repairs!"

 Mr. Sterling examines the horse.

 Mr. Sterling looks around in frustration, and approaches the horse
 stealthily.

 The horse sniffs Mr. Sterling's empty hand, then snorts dismissively.

>sing to horse

 Waving the steering wheel over his head, the grizzled character sings:

 "He'd have to get under, get out and get under,
 To fix his little machine!"

 Mr. Sterling grabs for the wheel, but the grizzled horseman spurs on
 his horse.

 The grizzled character goes south.

 Pleasant Clearing
 Thick woods surround this small forest clearing. Down the path leading
 west, you can glimpse part of the main house. A yard is to the north.
 To the south, a gap in the bushes leads into a thicket.

 The cottage door lies open to the east.

 Waving the steering wheel over his head, the grizzled character sings:

 "He was just dying to cuddle his queen --
 But every minute... when he'd begin it...
 He'd have to get under, get out and get under.
 Then he'd get back at the wheel."

 It's a low ravine cut into the hillside, over the top of which to the

 The Dynamo is here, parked under an apple tree. In the back seat is
 Prof. Sneedlewood.

 You can also see Mr. Pratt here.

 "Oh, there you are, Miss Sweet," says Mr. Pratt. "Sorry I had to rush
 off like that, but I'm lucky I did. It turns out it wasn't Salomonder
 stealing the car after all -- it was MacDougal, who's not exactly a
 disciple of technological progress, trying to sabotage it. Now he's
 riding around with my steering wheel. The crazy drunken bastar-- uh,
 that is... bastion of the agrarian way of life."

>get apple
 The nearest apple is just out of your reach.

 Mr. Pratt twists a crick out of his neck. "I can't quite put my finger
 on it, but something sounds funny about the motors. I think MacDougal
 may have tried to damage them, too. We can't go anywhere without the
 wheel, so I figured I might as well see what I can do here."

>stand on car
 Mr. Pratt leaves his work for long enough to help you. You step up on

 Mr. Pratt turns a knob to the right.

 He looks up, startled. "I'm flattered that you're thinking of me, Miss
 Sweet. I'm not one to rush things. Though I must admit..." His voice
 trails off, and he looks at you silently for a moment.

 After a brief pause, he tugs at his collar, and looks away.

 Mr. Pratt shuts off the motors.

 Mr. Pratt crawls under the automobile.

 A thick-set man, on the far side of sixty, but still vital and
 healthy. His eyes are dark and intense, but they frequently sparkle

 Mr. Pratt turns the motors back on.

 The horse sniffs at your apple, and settles down enough to nibble at
 it.

 "Come on, there!" says the grizzled horseman, annoyed with you. Mr.
 Sterling takes advantage of the distraction, and leaps for the
 steering wheel.

 Mr. Sterling does a shoulder roll and lands on his feet, holding the
 steering wheel aloft, like a wedding bouquet in the hand of a
 victorious bridesmaid.

 Mr. Sterling goes west.

 The drunken horseman takes a long draught from his bottle and rides
 off into the woods, cursing with surprisingly good diction.

 You hear yourself saying: "The stars fill the sky with the shining
 purity of destruction."

 "My dear girl -- you should save your voice," chides the professor,
 with gentle sadness. "You may need it later."

 Mr. Pratt shakes his head with a little sigh. "Maybe you shouldn't try
 to talk to much, Miss Sweet," he says, very gently. "Not until the
 professor has figured this whole thing out, anyway."

 Mr. Sterling tugs at his scarf, and tries to smile for your benefit.

 Mr. Pratt turns a knob to the left.

 Mr. Pratt listens to the right motor.

>listen to motor
 Mr. Pratt brightens. "Miss Sweet," he says, fidgeting somewhat. "Could
 I trouble you to tell me when both motors sound exactly the same?"
 [press any key]

 With your help, Mr. Pratt finishes tuning the motors in no time.

 "Gosh, thanks, Miss Sweet!" he says, eyes somewhat downcast. "I've
 never met someone who... someone like you before."

 The professor, frustrated, scratches something out of his copybook.
 "No, no! That's all wrong. "Until I figure out what Salomonder's
 trying to do, Miss Sweet, the farther we stay away from him, the
 better."

 He continues working in silence for a moment.

 Mr. Pratt bangs away at something underneath the Dynamo. "Aha!" he
 says. "What have we here? The frame is bent against the axle."

 He leans out from under the vehicle. "Mr. Sterling, as long as we're
 still waiting for the professor, could I send you on a very important,
 noble, and heroic quest? I need is some kind of a long pole. Maybe the
 professor has a mop or something. I just need a little leverage here."

 Mr. Sterling's face brightens. "Huzzah!" he shouts.

 Mr. Sterling exits to the northeast.

 Mr. Pratt notices your water. "That should do nicely," he says. He
 takes the old bucket and fills the radiator.

 The engines are humming in perfect unision now.

 Mr. Pratt smiles proudly. As he starts collecting his tools, he starts
 humming something to himself, very quietly.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>listen to left motor
 How delightful -- of all the music that Mr. Pratt could hum to
 himself, he has chosen "Les oiseaux dans la charmille," the very aria
 that launched your professional career!

 Mr. Pratt smiles shyly. "I thought maybe you'd recognise that song,"
 he says.

 Mr. Pratt continues to tinker. "I'm sorry I can't do that song
 justice. I suppose my voice isn't as bad as the gentleman you saw on
 the horse earlier. That's MacDougal. We've kind of had a running feud
 with him and some of the fellows at the livery stable. They don't
 realise that we can't turn the clock back -- this is the Twentieth
 Century, for cryin' out loud."

 "It's a good thing for us that he just wanted to wreck it, rather than
 steal it. Still, I wish he hadn't chosen today, of all days, to
 escalate his little anti-automobile crusade."

 He looks up, to see whether you are still listening.

>listen to pratt
 (Mr. Pratt)
 Mr. Pratt smiles.

 Mr. Pratt rests his arms on the frame of the Dynamo. "I imagine it's
 very difficult for you, losing your voice and all," he says haltingly.
 He looks down at his hands. "When we were all down in the cellar, and
 I was tied up, I felt so utterly helpless."

 He splays his fingers, and flexes them in front of his face. He slowly
 makes his fingers curl up, shriveling them towards his palms. For a
 moment, he stands there, his thoughtful face framed by his twisted
 hands. He looks up at you.

 "Say... why don't you whistle? I'll sing for you. I know the words."

>nod dreamily
 I only understood you as far as wanting to nod.

>whistle
 You whistle the tune, while Mr. Pratt sings in an untrained but
 pleasant voice:

    "Les oiseaux dans la charmille
    Dans les cieux l'astre du jour,
    Tout parle ? la jeune fille d'amour!
    Ah! Voil? la chanson gentille
    La chanson d'Olympia! Ah!

    "The birds in the garden,
    The star of day up above,
    They speak to a young girl of love!
    Ah! This is the song so charming,
    The song of Olympia! Ah!"

 Mr. Pratt smiles.

>kiss pratt
 (Mr. Pratt)
 Keep your mind on the game.

 "I want to show you something, Miss Sweet," says Mr. Pratt, walking
 around to the side of the Dynamo and opening up a panel. "This is the
 control console for the steam-powered calliope I designed for Mr.
 Sterling. It's connected to the horn. Right now it's set to play a set
 of pre-recorded paper rolls, but look -- it's also got a keyboard."

 Mr. Pratt makes a few adjustments. "Let's go for the second verse. Go
 ahead and play it!"

>kiss mr pratt
 Keep your mind on the game.

 Mr. Pratt looks a little concerned. "Just play the keyboard, Miss
 Sweet," he says. "If you want to, that is."

>play keyboard
 "Just a minute, Miss Sweet," says Mr. Pratt, making a final
 adjustment. "Okay, go ahead."

 When you push a key, the calliope produces an enchanting tone. Mr.
 Pratt seems to have adjusted his device to blend the sounds of an
 angelic choir and the vivid warbles of birdsong, resting upon the
 surpisingly musical throb of the Dynamo's motors.

 If Maestro Fibonacci could hear you play now, he would surely be
 surprised!

 Mr. Pratt sings again, this time with more confidence:

    "Tout ce qui chante et r?sonne
    Et soupire, tour ? tour,
    Emeut son coeur qui frissonne d'amour!
    Ah! Voil? la chanson mignonne
    La chanson d'Olympia! Ah!

    "Everything that sings and sounds
    And sighs, in its turn,
    Moves her heart, which trembles with love!
    Ah! This is the darling song,
    The song of Olympia! Ah!"

 Mr. Sterling arrives, carrying a rake. "Huzzah!"

 Mr. Pratt smiles into your face blankly...

 Mr. Sterling waves the rake at Mr. Pratt. "Huz-ZAH?"

 Mr. Pratt snaps out of it, and notices the rake. "That'll do nicely,"
 he says, taking it.

 The professor rubs his eyes wearily. Suddenly his face lights up. "Of
 course! Why couldn't I see it before? The notes are only part of the
 solution. The high priestess sang while presiding over a ritual that
 involved the preparation of a ceremonial drink... I recently prepared
 a test batch of that drink. Perfectly harmless stuff, or so it seemed.
 I left some of it at the Museum."

 In the far distance, you hear a train whistle. "That would be the
 Douglas Special," says Mr. Pratt, "ready to leave town, and headed
 back this way."

 "Salomonder is sure to be on that train," says the professor.

 Your little party is ready for the final showdown.

 The motors roar thrillingly...

 Thanks for playing Fine-Tuned. If you're one of those who were
 frustrated by the original, buggy IF Competition release, thanks for
 giving it another shot.

 If you'd like to try the game over again, here are some suggestions:

 CREDITS
 Type "about" to get a list of acknowledgements, both of beta-testers
 and sources (movies, books, and history) that inspired this game.

 CHAPTER 1
 * Aloysius hums a happy tune to himself while working on the Dynamo.
 What could it that tune be? Ask him about 'humming'.
 * It's possible to finish the game without getting the highest score.
 You lose points for performing certain un-dashing, un-heroic actions
 that would be unbecoming of a goggle-faced scarf-necked glove-handed
 wheel-hugger like Troy Sterling.
 * If you take too long getting Miss Sweet into the Dynamo, she will
 make her own arrangements for getting to the professor's house. The
 race against the train is less interesting without Miss Sweet, but the
 story progresses the same either way.
 * Did you find the treehouse?
 * There are animals in the livery stable area, but they don't call
 attention to themselves.
 * If you deliberately upset Aloysius in the beginning, he will
 eventually get mad and leave. This is arguably the best story ending
 for him.
 * Aloysius refers to Professor Fate (from "The Great Race") and
 building flying cars in Vulgaria (from "Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang").
 * The Dynamo might be useful for smashing through the professor's
 front door.

 CHAPTER 2
 * The professor knows quite a bit about your background. You can talk
 with him about some of the details you find in the newspaper
 clippings.
 * The tapestry in the professor's parlour contains a hint.
 * The photos in the professor's parlour describe a scene from Graham
 Nelson's "Ruins" (the sample game in the Inform Designer's Manual).
 * If melody examines the sun or listens to the birds, the responses
 refer to the lyrics of her signature song.
 * You can ask the professor about cheese (one of several cheese
 references in the game... a shameless ploy to be included on Emily
 Short's cheese-related list of IF games).
 * Typing the magic word "XYZZY" (from "Colossal Cave Adventure") calls
 up a message full of silly interactive fiction in-jokes. The same
 thing happens when you count the leaves (a reference to "Zork").

 CHAPTER 3
 * There are about ten different ways to end chapter 3. Salomonder has
 puns for most of these occasions. (The one involving the tree in the
 backyard is probably the best.)
 * There's a way to gain access to the objects in the professor's
 trophy case. (Troy can do it in this chapter, or Melody can do it in
 Chapter 4.)
 * The emerald is from "Colossal Cave Adventure".
 * The sordid elf of Great-Aunt Ickwiddy is a pun on an important prop
 in "Zork".
>amusing
 * The statuette is another reference to "Ruins."
 * The porcelain art object is a horror, isn't it? Break it if you get
 the chance.

 CHAPTER 4
 * The apple tree that magically appears near the Dynamo was there all
 along... Troy just didn't notice it in the previous chapter.
 * Aloysius and Troy will respond differently if Melody offers an apple
 to them.
 * For the first several releases of the game, Melody calms the horse
 by giving it a sugar cube from the tea set in the professor's study.
 But I wanted to ensure that Melody had interacted at least slightly
 with Aloysius before she helped Troy get the wheel... as the scenes
 between Melody and Aloysius developed, I realized that Troy couldn't
 be there watching.
 * The song MacDougal sings, "Get Out and Get Under," is a popular
 barroom tune dating from 1913. I liked it so much that, while I had
 envisioned the story set around 1910, I included it anyway. It's in
 the common domain by now. I found the lyrics and an MP3 on the
 * While Olympia's aria is definitely in the common domain by now, I
 wasn't able to find a recording that was also in the common domain.
