 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You wake to stillness.  The hammering, banging, and shouting that kept
 you awake half the night are gone.  The air is cold, and something
 smells burnt.  Your master's experiments must be finished, but with
 what result?

 Something hesitates on the edge of your consciousness, the memory of
 unquiet dreams...

 Then you see.  You have been sent, again.  The taste of ash is on your
 lips, the grit in your eyes.  And you blink...

 Bare Room
 A formless place, such as you have often seen before; where dreams end
 and tasks begin.  The floor is uneven, cupped like the palm of your
 master's hand.   The walls shimmer with the artifice of your sending.

 A loose rock lies near your foot.

>examine me
 You look as you always do; feel as ever.  A bit weighted, a bit weary.

 A voice, remembered: "Find the elements.  Bring them to me."

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a workbox
     a ball of yarn
     a needle
   a brown dress (being worn)
   a ring (being worn)
   some slippers (being worn)

>examine ring
 A plain metal band, without adornment, that you have been accustomed
 to wear on your right hand.  It is the only thing of value you
 possess.

>examine workbox
 The wooden box in which you keep small tools for your work around the
 house.

>examine dress
 The coarse dress that you wear to do chores around the house -- and
 your tasks in other realms, as well.

>examine slippers
 Tattered by too many errands of this kind.  But at least they still
 fit.

>take rock
 Taken.

>examine stone
 A lumpy rock.

>examine walls
 The faint shimmer is fading even as you look.  It is only with averted
 vision, from the corners of your eyes, that you can still make out the
 shapes of lines and letters.

>examine shapes
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lines
 You can't see any such thing.

 They fade when you look at them straight-on.

 Bare Room
 A formless place, such as you have often seen before; where dreams end
 and tasks begin.  The floor is uneven, cupped like the palm of your
 master's hand.   The walls dull in your sight.

>examine floor
 The floor is roughly hollowed.

>go north
 The first step is more of the will than of the body: from here there
 is only out.

>hallow hollow
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>out
 The proximate walls fade away, leaving you in a much larger space.


 Shore of An Underground Lake
 A narrow ledge of solid rock at the southern end of a great cavern.
 Beyond it lies a body of water so flat, so black and tranquil, that it
 might be a surface of polished obsidian.

 Embedded in the wall, a mirror reflects your movements: an odd
 smoothness in the unshaped stone.

 A heavy bronze bell hangs from a stand.

>examine mirror
 A flat round mirror, which reflects you dimly in its face.  Around the
 edge runs the series of signs that fix an earthly object in an
 unearthly world: your master put this here for your return.

>open workbox
 That's not something you can open.

>examine water
 Preternaturally smooth and flat.

>examine it
 Preternaturally smooth and flat.

>examine workbox
 The wooden box in which you keep small tools for your work around the
 house.

>look in workbox
 In the workbox are a ball of yarn and a needle.

>put water in workbox
 You need to be holding the lake surface before you can put it into
 something else.

>take water
>fill box with water
 That's hardly portable.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to fill the workbox.

>touch lake surface
 I only understood you as far as wanting to touch the lake surface.

>fill box
 But there's no water here to carry.

>put box in lake
 Anything you dropped in there, you would be unable to retrieve.

>touch lake surface with yarn
 I only understood you as far as wanting to touch the lake surface.

>scoop water with box
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>unroll yarn
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>unravel yarn in water
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>drink water
 You stoop towards the water, but you can't bring your lips to the
 surface itself.

 Shore of An Underground Lake

 might be a surface of polished obsidian.

 Embedded in the wall, a mirror reflects your movements: an odd

 A heavy bronze bell hangs from a stand.

>examine bell
 A very ancient bronze bell, covered with a curious pattern.  It is
 mounted on a stand; there is no clapper within.

>ring bell
 There is no clapper.

>hit bell
 You slap ineffectually at the bell.

>hit bell with rock
 The peal is deep and resonant; the surface of the lake stands up in
 ripples; the darkness grows (if that is possible) more dark.  Even
 when the sound has died and the water stilled, you find yourself
 waiting.

>wait
 Time passes.

 There is a distant splash; a long silence; a repetition.

>wait
 Time passes.

 A dark shape distinguishes itself from the other darkness on the
 water: a small gondola without passengers, a single gondolier bent at
 his pole.  It is progressing towards you.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The gondola draws up against the ledge, its flank scraping stone.  The
 gondolier awaits.

>examine gondola
 Black and smooth as the surface of the water itself, but ornamented
 here and there with tiny gilt images -- mostly human figures, with
 mute faces and outstretched hands.

>examine gondolier
 Robed and hooded in heavy black cloth, the face obscured.

 The gondolier lifts his head and sighs softly.

>enter gondola
 The gondolier watches impassively as you clamber in.

 The gondolier pushes away from the ledge and propels the gondola
 through the water with remarkable speed.  Soon you cannot see the
 walls of the cavern, only the ghostly shafts of stalactites, present
 and then swiftly gone.  It seems an eternity before you land again.

>look
 You step out onto solid ground.


 North Shore
 Against the rough north wall of the cavern lies a moon-shaped landing
 of white stone, with a pair of shallow steps down to the glass-black
 surface of the lake.  A Moorish archway leads away to the north.

 The only furniture is an ornate metal pole, branching at the top, with
 dozens of bells hung from the branches.

 A gondola waits nearby, the gondolier leaning against his pole.

 The gondolier lifts his head and sighs softly.

>examine bells
 Tiny silver bells, each with its tongue.

 The gondolier, apparently weary of the wait, pushes off from the ledge
 and is quickly merged again with the darkness.

>examine archway
 Outlined in white stone and decorated with a geometric pattern.

>SAVE

 Predominantly made of triangular or near-triangular figures,
 interlocked, and carved deeply into the stone.

 Dome of Broken Light
 A straight white light comes through the hole in the ceiling, but it
 is soon after twisted and bent: mirrors cast it from angle to angle;
 crystal divides it; glass stains it.

 East and west, low corridors lead into shadow.

 In the north wall is a closed door, covered with a silver substance.

 Fallen from one of these strands, but intact, is a large
 magnifying-lens.

>examine substance
 Not quite shiny enough to act as a mirror.  It is significantly taller
 than you are, narrow, with a keyhole exactly in the middle.

>take lens
 Taken.

>examine lens
 A powerful lens about the size of your open palm, with a rim of chased
 bronze.

>examine mirrors
 Shiny beads, shells sawn in half and jagged shards of mirror, all no
 larger than your thumb, are embedded into the plaster of the ceiling.

>examine light
 It's hard to tell, from here, whether you are seeing sunlight or some
 other kind.  You see daylight rarely in your travels; these are
 isolated places, self-contained.

 But the light is too bright too look at long, whether it falls through
 glass or empty air; it carries no heat.

>examine keyhole
 A modestly-sized keyhole, surrounded by an undecorated plate of silver
 metal.

>look through keyhole
 You can see another round room, lit from above like this one, but with
 a staircase leading up.

>focus light on keyhole
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine crystal
 Strings of faceted crystals, like a giantess' necklace; here and there
 a large prism, pendant; shards of stained glass, linked with bits of
 chain.  The rainbows color your skin.

>examine glass
 (the magnifying glass)
 A powerful lens about the size of your open palm, with a rim of chased
 bronze.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a magnifying glass
   a rock
   a workbox
     a ball of yarn
     a needle
   a brown dress (being worn)
   a ring (being worn)
   some slippers (being worn)

>examine glass

 A powerful lens about the size of your open palm, with a rim of chased
 bronze.

>look at crystals through lens
 The glass distorts the image, but not in any interesting way.

>put lens over keyhole
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>look at keyhole through lens
 It looks much as it did before, but larger.  The magnification does
 not help you see any better what lies on the other side.

 Zoo of Marvels
 A long, vaulted room, lined with cages of filigree and jewels.  All of
 the animals are motionless and still, perhaps through the art of a
 taxidermist.  In one cage is an elephant, so short that he reaches
 only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
 him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
 slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

 Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular
 hourglass, one bulb larger than the other.  There is no sand within --
 nor could there be, since the contraption is open at each end.  At the
 moment the smaller end is uppermost.

>put lens on keyhole
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine mouse
 He seems peaceful and ponderous, as though enlargement has banished
 all his fears and replaced them with a blissful serenity.

>examine elephant
 There's a look almost beseeching in his grave eyes, as though he lived
 to old age at a proper size, and then only at the end was reduced to
 this sad state.

>examine cage
 They look like something out of a pasha's pleasure garden: ornate in
 shape and workmanship, but still strong enough to withstand
 considerable battering, even though the animals inside are stuffed.

>examine hourglass
 Made of a clear material (glass?  perhaps, perhaps not), large at one
 end and smaller at the other, and mounted on a sort of swivel on the
 wall so that it can be turned over at will.  At the moment the smaller
 end is uppermost.

>examine swivel
 You can't see any such thing.

>turn it
 You rotate the contraption on the wall so that the larger end is
 uppermost.

>examine elephant
 There's a look almost beseeching in his grave eyes, as though he lived
 to old age at a proper size, and then only at the end was reduced to
 this sad state.

>put glass in hourglass
>open cage
>look
 You put the magnifying glass into the contraption; improbably, it
 squinches down, passes through the narrow neck, and emerges from the
 other end smaller than it was when it went in.

 On close inspection, it seems that the mechanisms for opening the
 cages are stuck fast; no key will ever work in them again.

 Glass Grove
 An orchard of glass trees: trunks slender and orderly as the columns
 of the Alhambra, foliage iridescent and frail.  No wind stirs, and
 yet, from time to time, a leaf casts free of its branch and drifts to
 the ground.  The whole floor of the cavern is deep with them.

 At the center of this is a clearing where a monstrous furnace stands
 -- shaped like a coiled dragon.

>examine furnace
 A huge furnace in the shape of a dragon.  The dragon's belly contains
 the fire, and in this portion of the contraption is a space in which
 you might put something to heat.  The dragon's ear is a sort of dial;
 the dragon's eye is a push-button.

>count leaves
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>get leaf
 You take one of the glass leaves, but it is so fragile that even the
 slightest handling destroys it.

>examine trees
 Elegant, bloodless, utterly inorganic.  On inspection, the bark proves
 to be covered with tiny, stylized incisions; the branches fork in
 matched, symmetrical pairs.

 Hanging from one of the trees is an almost perfectly round apple, made
 of a reddish metal.

>count leaves
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine floor
 Layers on layers of fragile detritus.

>examine apple
 An apple almost perfectly round, made of a ruddy metal.

 The dial can be set to anything from 1 to 5.  It currently stands at
 3.  The label under this dial reads "Change to".

 You turn the dial to 2.

>press button
 The surface of the round apple becomes quickly rough and speckled.

>turn dial to 3
 You turn the dial to 3.

 A pale, iridescent red bauble, with only the faintest hint of an
 indent where the stem once went.

>look in apple
 In the round apple is a delicate key.

>turn dial to 4
 You turn the dial to 4.

 The plump surface gives way to a satiny lushness, falling in on
 itself.

>examine apple
 A round pink sack.

>open sack
 That's not something you can open.

>get sack
>tear sack
 You can feel something hard inside, through the cloth.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 You put the round apple into the furnace.

>push button
 The round apple grows gradually clear from the outside in, until it

>break apple
 With your bare hands?  That could be uncomfortable.

>break apple with rock
 You shatter the round apple into a million useless shards.  In the
 process, you spill out a delicate key.

 Tower, Bottom
 You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of
 the cardinal directions, except for the north; there, a spacious niche
 contains the statue of a woman, skillfully executed in white marble.

 The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made
 of such slender and delicate supports that it obscures neither light
 nor view.

 The silvery door to the south stands open.

 A wooden tube lies forgotten on the floor.

>ask galatea about herself
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine statue
 Delicately proportioned and carved of white marble, with a small,
 aristocratic head and supple limbs.  She is in the act of pulling up a
 mantle around herself with one hand; with the other hand, she is
 half-leaning on a large concave mirror.

>examine tube
 A short wooden tube, open at each end.  There seems to be a vellum
 scroll tightly rolled within.

>get scroll
 You can't manage to dislodge the vellum with your fingers: the tube is
 too narrow for easy negotiation.

>get scroll from tube
 Removed.

>read scroll
 A single sheet torn from a much larger volume.  Front and back are
 covered with diagrams of optical devices: silvered mirrors both flat
 and concave; a convex lens; a round ball of glass.  Lines represent
 the passage of light, bounced or bent.  Your master has just such
 papers at home, marked with the emblem of the Society of the Lynx.

 Considerable text accompanies these drawings, but since it is neither
 in Latin nor the vernacular, you cannot guess the sense of it.  There
 is, however, a marginal note, in red letters, that appears to be in
 Latin.  This is in a crabbed hand and too small to read.

>put lens on scroll
 Putting things on the vellum scroll would achieve nothing.

>read latin with lens

 You discover nothing of interest in the contraption.

 With the aid of the magnifying glass, you're able to make out what is
 written:

 The paths of light lie open, the swiftness of thought, the bending,
 the division, and the reflection.

 Top of Cistern
 This is the rim of a great cistern, which is built of bricks and lined
 with plaster, and must be very old.  Along the inside of the cistern,
 a spiral stair descends towards the surface of the water, more than a
 full story below you.

 The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable
 ocean: of the broad empty water, the clustering clouds, the thin and
 distant crust that is the beginning of the New World.

>examine paintings
 Which do you mean, the New World, the native village, the ocean, the
 trade ships, the wrecks or the pirate ships?

>examine new world
 A thin strip of coastline on the horizon, showing a dense growth of
 strange trees, and in a few places mountains rising out of the
 surrounding land.  A single plume of smoke rises from this shore, as
 though to indicate that the land is inhabited, though only just.

 Some of the picture is too tiny for you to make out with the naked
 eye.

 ("I don't know what you may find -- you'll have to look closely at
 everything...")

>look at new world through lens
 Closer inspection shows a mad variety there: native people standing
 under the trees, as naked and innocent as Adam and Eve; an abundance
 of unfamiliar fruits and crops growing, half-tended, in the shadow of
 the primeval trees; precious minerals and clusters of gems lying on
 the surface of the ground, ready for the taking.

>examine native village
 Too small for you to see without help.

>exploit new world
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>look at native village through lens
 The village, with its small houses arranged in a circle around a
 central fire, the outlying fields of crops, the peculiarly populous
 forests, all are done in a style familiar from etchings.  Stilted
 figures holding fruits and grains look out, solemnly smiling,
 advertising the carefree richness in which they live.

>look at ocean through lens
 The image swims before you, and you see down, under the surface, to
 the depths where the tentacled creatures live among the bones of
 sailors and the wrecks of ships.

>take gems
 You can't see any such thing.

>look at wrecks through lens
 You search the faces of the dead minutely, but do not see the one you
 know.  Perhaps he has already gone to coral and bone.

>look at trade ships through lens
 They struggle, deeply loaded, against an angry sea.

>look at ships through lens
 Which do you mean, the trade ships, the wrecks or the pirate ships?

>pirate
 You find yourself staring into the swarthy face of a Spanish
 buccaneer.  He has a thick black growth of beard, and a monkey clings
 to his shoulder.

 (Time here does not correspond to time outside; you have all the
 leisure you like to look at the strange world.)

 Top of Cistern
 This is the rim of a great cistern, which is built of bricks and lined
 with plaster, and must be very old.  Along the inside of the cistern,
 a spiral stair descends towards the surface of the water, more than a
 full story below you.

 The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable
 ocean: of the broad empty water, the clustering clouds, the thin and
 distant crust that is the beginning of the New World.

>pray
 Silence.  Whether you are heard or not is another question.

>go down

 In the Cistern
 You have reached the lowest extent of the stair, and stand on what
 might best be described as a small balcony.  The surface of the water
 is still some distance below you.

 Perhaps to deal with predicaments such as that in which you now find
 yourself, a pulley mechanism has been installed at this level.

>examine pulley
 A mossy chain hangs from the pulley: one side descends into the water
 below, while the other ends in a hook just at a reachable level.
 There is currently nothing on the hook.

 Tower, Bottom
 You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of
 the cardinal directions, except for the north; there, a spacious niche
 contains the statue of a woman, skillfully executed in white marble.

 The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made
 of such slender and delicate supports that it obscures neither light
 nor view.

 The silvery door to the south stands open.

>go east

 Vista Room
 On the curving walls are painted the village and the nearby
 countryside; beyond those are impossibly distant places (labelled for
 your better instruction): Paris, spired and shimmering; southward
 Rome; a misty London in the north.

 The floor is paved with large stones, and one of these is partly
 budged from its position.

>examine stone
 (the large paving stone)
 About two feet on a side and many inches thick: it is hard to guess
 what force might have budged it in the first place.

>examine paris
 Paris, narrow streets with narrow houses crowded; the Seine, and the
 Pont Neuf; trees in the preserve of the King.  There's a great deal of
 detail that you can't quite make out.

>look at paris through lens
 Paris, narrow streets with narrow houses crowded; the Seine, and the
 Pont Neuf; trees in the preserve of the King.  In the windows of the
 palaces, fine ladies stand looking out, gowned in extravagant fashion,
 breaking their fathers and husbands.

 In the dungeons prisoners twist and burn.  Beads of sweat run down
 their faces.  Their eyes are full of the fever of hell.  Notre-Dame
 sings, aspiring to God.

>look at london through lens
 The magnifying glass shows you details you'd missed before.  You see
 the criers in the streets, selling horses and books, toys and flowers,
 bread and fruit, their mouths open silently.

 You see the theaters, crowded with spectators; the stage, and the
 actors on it; their false swordplay and their disguising beards.  The
 breast of one has come askew, since God did not give it to him to be a
 woman by nature.

 You see the diviner, peering into a glass where demons teem.

 And at the very center stands the Queen, great woman in a little
 world.

>look at rome through lens
 You squint at the image of Rome through the glass, and it unfolds
 before you:

 There is the Tiber, winding, and every bridge that crosses it, and
 every peddler selling trinkets on those bridges.  The birds that flew
 in augury, circling still on the hills.  The beasts of burden, laden
 with food from the fields...

>take stone

 It's much too big to lift.

>move stone

 You lack the strength to move it with your bare hands.

 Tower, Mid-level
 A midpoint in the tower, with doorways east and west, lit from above.
 The south wall is occupied by a deep niche, in which is a statue of a
 young man in the Greek mode.

 The walls have been sheathed with a variety of fine materials, all
 exceptionally costly: sheets of beaten gold, squares of lapis lazuli,
 placards of ruby and adamant.

>examine statue
 Naked except for the sandals laced around his ankles, carrying in one
 hand a sturdy key.  His face is more vigorous than beautiful; his hair
 is arranged around his head in a disorderly array of curls.  He is
 looking up from under a strong brow, his gaze bent on something above
 you.

 From somewhere nearby comes a low rumbling.

>look up
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>go up
 Up there, cogs and wheels are moving at great speed.  You don't dare
 try to climb up.

>examine key

 A delicate key of silvery metal, with precisely-cut teeth.

 At the moment, the delicate key is a somewhat enlarged version of
 itself.

 A sturdy key of golden metal, with precisely-cut teeth.

 From somewhere nearby comes a low rumbling.

 crystal divides it; glass stains it.

 The silvery door to the north stands open.

 Glass Grove
 An orchard of glass trees: trunks slender and orderly as the columns

 yet, from time to time, a leaf casts free of its branch and drifts to
 the ground.  The whole floor of the cavern is deep with them.

 At the center of this is a clearing where a monstrous furnace stands
 -- shaped like a coiled dragon.

>examine furnace
 A huge furnace in the shape of a dragon.  The dragon's belly contains
 the fire, and in this portion of the contraption is a space in which
 you might put something to heat.  The dragon's ear is a sort of dial;
 the dragon's eye is a push-button.

>put tube in dragon
 You put the tube into the furnace.

 The dial can be set to anything from 1 to 5.  It currently stands at

 Zoo of Marvels
 A long, vaulted room, lined with cages of filigree and jewels.  All of
 the animals are motionless and still, perhaps through the art of a
 taxidermist.  In one cage is an elephant, so short that he reaches
 only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
 him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
 slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

 Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular
 hourglass, one bulb larger than the other.  There is no sand within --
 nor could there be, since the contraption is open at each end.  At the
 moment the smaller end is uppermost.

>put tube in hourglass
 You put the tube into the contraption; predictably, it squinches down,
 passes through the narrow neck, and emerges from the other end larger
 than it was when it went in.

 If only your master were here to observe that bit of cleverness.  He
 never asks how you achieve your ends.

>go down

 Hollow of Unbroken Darkness
 No light penetrates the sullen air; if you did not keep your hand on
 it, even the ladder upward would soon be lost to you.  It is only by
 touch that you are able to discern what surrounds you.

 And you're back in that place, where he sent you the first time.
 Groping hand and foot in a stifling blackness, no light anywhere.  ("I
 can't promise you help, but remember: rely on your wits.  And whatever
 you do, keep looking.")

 Whispering it to yourself in the close corridors, hearing the
 corridors whisper it back again.  Keep looking.

 And so you crawl on, sometimes falling unexpectedly, sometimes getting
 stuck; sometimes finding yourself far down a passage without outlet,
 having to crawl backwards again, start over.

 Even when you find what you seek -- a deep pool of matter in its
 rawness, chaos without shape -- you must make your way back again.
 There's no time here, no orientation, no measure.  Only blind
 persistence can ever bring you home.

>touch pool
 Then the darkness is just darkness again.

 (You grasp at air, startled.  It's gone -- not in your hands after all
 -- unless...?

 Something has changed.  Something has certainly changed.  But the
 possession is not of a physical sort.)

 young man in the Greek mode.

 The walls have been sheathed with a variety of fine materials, all
 exceptionally costly: sheets of beaten gold, squares of lapis lazuli,
 placards of ruby and adamant.

 Tower, Bottom
 You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of
 the cardinal directions, except for the north; there, a spacious niche
 contains the statue of a woman, skillfully executed in white marble.

 The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made
 of such slender and delicate supports that it obscures neither light
 nor view.

 The silvery door to the south stands open.

 Dome of Broken Light
 A straight white light comes through the hole in the ceiling, but it
 is soon after twisted and bent: mirrors cast it from angle to angle;
 crystal divides it; glass stains it.

 East and west, low corridors lead into shadow.

 The silvery door to the north stands open.

 Zoo of Marvels
 A long, vaulted room, lined with cages of filigree and jewels.  All of
 the animals are motionless and still, perhaps through the art of a
 taxidermist.  In one cage is an elephant, so short that he reaches
 only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
 him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
 slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

 Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular
 hourglass, one bulb larger than the other.  There is no sand within --
 nor could there be, since the contraption is open at each end.  At the
 moment the smaller end is uppermost.

>turn hourglass
 You rotate the contraption on the wall so that the larger end is
 uppermost.

>put tube in hourglass
 You put the tube into the contraption; predictably, it squinches down,
 passes through the narrow neck, and emerges from the other end smaller
 than it was when it went in.

 Glass Grove
 An orchard of glass trees: trunks slender and orderly as the columns
 of the Alhambra, foliage iridescent and frail.  No wind stirs, and
 yet, from time to time, a leaf casts free of its branch and drifts to
 the ground.  The whole floor of the cavern is deep with them.

 At the center of this is a clearing where a monstrous furnace stands
 -- shaped like a coiled dragon.

 Shadows and Apparitions
 You stand in the center of a dim room, lit from above by a piercing
 light.  Evidently there is another room above you, but the brilliance
 of its illumination makes it impossible for you to perceive anything
 up there.

 The center of the room is occupied by a bulky expandable staircase.

>put burl in oven
 Under the bright spot of the magnifying glass, the rough burl begins
 to smolder and then to burn.  After a few minutes, the water boils.
 There is a hiss and clank from within the machine, and the button in
 front begins to glow.

>push button with tube
 Unfortunately, the tube is too small to be useful.

>push button
 You can't help hesitating; is that really necessary?

>SAVE
>cf5
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>push button
 Grimly you hold your finger to the button long enough for the catch to
 engage.  The staircase expands upward from the ground, connecting with
 the ceiling with an audible click and locking into place.  There's a
 brief decompressive hiss.

 Absently you touch the burn with your tongue.  Your experience is that
 such things take some time to heal, even when you have returned to the
 sensible world.

 The priest touching your elbow after church.  "Are you well?  You
 look--"

 "My master is teaching me many things."

 Gravely: "Nothing you shouldn't learn, I hope.  He has strange ideas,
 especially of what it is right to teach to a female..."  Then as you
 turned away: "Come speak to me later."

 But you didn't.

>examine me
 Some essential restlessness is gone from you; you tremble less than
 you used to; your hand, relaxed, remains still.

 An upright triangle scars the back of your left hand, the symbol of
 earth.

>go up

 High Room
 All the time that you were climbing the stairs, you could barely look
 forward, so overwhelming was the light that came from this room; but
 now that you have arrived, you see that it too is lit from somewhere
 further on and far away.

 A flawless metal tetrahedron lies nearby.

>examine finger
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine tetrahedron
 A four-sided solid figure with triangular faces, made of a coppery
 metal.  On the faces are inscribed all sorts of interlocked and
 writhing figures, of salamanders, and a phoenix in flight.

>take it

 Flame licks over you, so fierce it seems you must die.

 ("Purification of the spirit," he mutters in your ear.  "You'll

 When you get up again, autumn has arrived.  Your legs are weaker than

 Brass Menagerie
 A long, low room, naturally lit by small windows just beneath the
 ceiling.  Down the center of the room runs a series of pedestals, and
 on each pedestal stands an automated creature of some sort -- a great
 clockwork bird; a chorus of glass frogs; a pair of human dancers
 eternally whirling on the cogged floor of their tiny ballroom.

 Beside the door, and running down into the rock of the floor, is an
 enormous crank of Damascus steel.

 On the wall there is an adjustable lever.

 From the ceiling high above the second pedestal hangs a wooden
 octahedron.

>examine octahedron
 Burnt into the surface of the wood is an intricate design of herons
 and owls, goshawks, peacocks, sparrows, doves, every species of bird;
 bees; butterflies; the airy drift of clouds, and the shaft of the sun.

 The crank is two handspans long, attached to a long shaft which runs
 through a sort of socket into the floor.  The entire mechanism has
 been thoroughly greased.

 The dancers are especially fine.  Their costume replicates an English

 copper, pierced in designs, and around the gentleman's neck is a ruff
 of folded silver.

 carved ivory, so that they look drawn, and even paler than ordinary
 English folk.

 over the frame, it seems.

 wax.  But it is the inward change you feel.  Heavy with thought, great
 with griefs, all that is physical discarded but the toiling of the

 Across the back of your left hand are scarred the symbols of fire,
 earth, and air.

 Tower, Mid-level
 A midpoint in the tower, with doorways east and west, lit from above.
 The south wall is occupied by a deep niche, in which is a statue of a
 young man in the Greek mode.

 The walls have been sheathed with a variety of fine materials, all
 exceptionally costly: sheets of beaten gold, squares of lapis lazuli,
 placards of ruby and adamant.

 The grumbling of machinery catches your attention.

 Tower, Bottom
 You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of

 The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made
 of such slender and delicate supports that it obscures neither light
 nor view.

 The silvery door to the south stands open.

 Top of Cistern
 This is the rim of a great cistern, which is built of bricks and lined
 with plaster, and must be very old.  Along the inside of the cistern,
 a spiral stair descends towards the surface of the water, more than a
 full story below you.

 The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable
 ocean: of the broad empty water, the clustering clouds, the thin and
 distant crust that is the beginning of the New World.

 In the Cistern
 You have reached the lowest extent of the stair, and stand on what
 might best be described as a small balcony.  The surface of the water
 is still some distance below you.

 Perhaps to deal with predicaments such as that in which you now find
 yourself, a pulley mechanism has been installed at this level.

 An orchard of glass trees: trunks slender and orderly as the columns

 At the center of this is a clearing where a monstrous furnace stands

 Zoo of Marvels
 A long, vaulted room, lined with cages of filigree and jewels.  All of
 the animals are motionless and still, perhaps through the art of a
 taxidermist.  In one cage is an elephant, so short that he reaches
 only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
 him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
 slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

 Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular
 hourglass, one bulb larger than the other.  There is no sand within --
 nor could there be, since the contraption is open at each end.  At the
 moment the smaller end is uppermost.

 You have reached the lowest extent of the stair, and stand on what
 might best be described as a small balcony.  The surface of the water
 is still some distance below you.

 yourself, a pulley mechanism has been installed at this level.

 On the pulley is a ring.

 Top of Cistern
 This is the rim of a great cistern, which is built of bricks and lined
 with plaster, and must be very old.  Along the inside of the cistern,
 a spiral stair descends towards the surface of the water, more than a
 full story below you.

 The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable
 ocean: of the broad empty water, the clustering clouds, the thin and

 Tower, Bottom
 You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of
 the cardinal directions, except for the north; there, a spacious niche
 contains the statue of a woman, skillfully executed in white marble.

 The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made
 of such slender and delicate supports that it obscures neither light
 nor view.

 The silvery door to the south stands open.

 Dome of Broken Light
 A straight white light comes through the hole in the ceiling, but it
 is soon after twisted and bent: mirrors cast it from angle to angle;
 crystal divides it; glass stains it.

 East and west, low corridors lead into shadow.

 The silvery door to the north stands open.

 Zoo of Marvels
 A long, vaulted room, lined with cages of filigree and jewels.  All of
 the animals are motionless and still, perhaps through the art of a
 taxidermist.  In one cage is an elephant, so short that he reaches
 only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
 him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
 slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

 Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular
 hourglass, one bulb larger than the other.  There is no sand within --
 nor could there be, since the contraption is open at each end.  At the
 moment the smaller end is uppermost.

>put ring in hourglass
 The ring rolls straight down the inside of the hourglass, passes
 through the narrow point (though it really shouldn't be able to),
 turns in on itself in some way that your eye is not able to follow,
 and emerges larger than it was to start with.

>put ring on hook
 (You have a feeling you won't get it back.)

 The chain shifts, tugging against its own rust.  Then, with a long
 resentful screech that you can feel in your teeth, the pulley shifts
 and the ring descends into the water.  At the same time, something
 else is lifted out.

 You rub at the bare spot on your ring finger.  You've worn that for
 nearly five years now.

 On the pulley is a perfect icosahedron.

 You taste bitter pride.  Determination is, in the end, more valuable
 than any other conceivable commodity.

>icosahedron
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine icosahedron
 An icosahedron made of glass, on the surface of which are etched
 fishes of all kinds, branching coral, dolphins and whales; ships
 swollen with wind, merfolk, sunk treasure... all the lustre of the
 surface of the sea, and all the mystery of its depth.

>take icosahedron
 As you remove the burden, the chain shifts again and, with a rattle,
 comes off the pulley, leaving only the pulley itself, but no hook.

 As for the icosahedron, it tingles in your hand--

>push space
 Sitting on the knee of the priest, while he read the letter to your
 mother.  (He held you very tightly, though he was looking at her.)
 You didn't understand the words he used; when she went out, you looked
 at him.  "Little one, your father has drowned in the sea."

>examine me
 Later, water again: the women washing your mother's body.  A voice:
 "You're going to have to make a decision.  What do you want to do now?
 The convent will take you, if you wish, or you could go into
 service..."

 But you buried your face, and the decisions were made on your behalf.

 Then you come back to yourself, your face still wet.

 only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
 him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
 slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

 Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular
 hourglass, one bulb larger than the other.  There is no sand within --
 nor could there be, since the contraption is open at each end.  At the
 moment the smaller end is uppermost.

>turn hourglass
 You rotate the contraption on the wall so that the larger end is
 uppermost.

>put slippers in hourglass
 You put the slippers into the contraption; predictably, it squinches
 down, passes through the narrow neck, and emerges from the other end
 smaller than it was when it went in.

>wear slippers
 Putting on slippers made of stone is not pleasant, but you find after
 a few moments' struggle that they do indeed still fit.

 Dome of Broken Light
 A straight white light comes through the hole in the ceiling, but it
 is soon after twisted and bent: mirrors cast it from angle to angle;
 crystal divides it; glass stains it.

 East and west, low corridors lead into shadow.

 The silvery door to the north stands open.

 Tower, Bottom
 You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of
 the cardinal directions, except for the north; there, a spacious niche
 contains the statue of a woman, skillfully executed in white marble.

 The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made
 of such slender and delicate supports that it obscures neither light
 nor view.

 The silvery door to the south stands open.

 Tower, Mid-level
 A midpoint in the tower, with doorways east and west, lit from above.
 The south wall is occupied by a deep niche, in which is a statue of a
 young man in the Greek mode.

 The walls have been sheathed with a variety of fine materials, all
 exceptionally costly: sheets of beaten gold, squares of lapis lazuli,
 placards of ruby and adamant.  There is a dark, square hole in the
 north wall where one of these sheets has been removed.

 You can see a tube (which is empty), two keys (a delicate key and a
 sturdy key), a workbox (which is empty), a magnifying glass, a ball of
 yarn, a needle and a placard here.

>go north
 You take a deep breath and enter, suppressing your distaste.


 Crawlspace
 You're crouched in a square crawlspace, barely broader than the width
 of your shoulders.  The absence of light makes things particularly
 unpleasant.

 There's a ferocious rumbling at the northernmost (and lowest) end of
 the crawlspace, where, you imagine, something very large is rotating.

>remove slippers
 That's not possible in so confined a space.

>put slippers in machinery

 That's not possible in so confined a space.

 The undressed stone of the walls scrapes at you as you move, which is
 an extremely unpleasant and distracting sensation.

>enter clockwork
 That's not something you can enter.

 "There's no glory in needless martyrdom."  The priest again, leaning
 in the doorway while you scrubbed the floor.  "You can come away from

 half-leaning on a large concave mirror.

>take statue
 That's hardly portable.

>look in mirror

 You see yourself upside down -- and other.  Your reflection seems
 taller, more noble, with untattered clothes.  And your upside-down

 burning eyes.

 Zoo of Marvels
 A long, vaulted room, lined with cages of filigree and jewels.  All of
 the animals are motionless and still, perhaps through the art of a
 taxidermist.  In one cage is an elephant, so short that he reaches
 only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
 him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
 slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

 Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular

 Glass Grove
 An orchard of glass trees: trunks slender and orderly as the columns
 of the Alhambra, foliage iridescent and frail.  No wind stirs, and
 yet, from time to time, a leaf casts free of its branch and drifts to
 the ground.  The whole floor of the cavern is deep with them.

 At the center of this is a clearing where a monstrous furnace stands
 -- shaped like a coiled dragon.

 The individual leaves are shaped like spades, but with serrated edges.

 You put the needle into the furnace.

 Tower of Stars
 You stand among cogs and gears, many with teeth longer than your
 forearm; the outer ring of the floor is wholly occupied with these.

 But above is a spangled darkness full of music.  The moon hangs
 overhead, and all the constellations, frozen in their places.

 In the center of the floor, bathed in its own light, is a perfect
 dodecahedron.

>examine dodecahedron
 A solid of unidentifiable material, smooth, shiny, and unflawed,
 across whose surfaces play the images of stars.  Orion.  Casseiopeia.
 The Pleiades.  The Great Bear.  And here and there among the
 constellations, the planets, wanderers, appear: traveling back on
 themselves, then straight again, across the dozen facets of the gem.

>take it
 It weighs almost nothing, but you hear its music for a moment in your
 mind: gracious and yet swift, a courtly dance.

>push space
 "It is not an easy road."  (You're standing in your master's study
 again; younger than now, and better fed.)  "You'll have to learn to
 read, if you're to be any use to me."

 You feel yourself nodding.

>again
 He opens the book on his desk, and shows you the images therein: the
 planets represented by gods, each with attributes; the bird with three
 heads, cased in a glass bottle; the constellations, given their proper
 faces.  And as you look at the pictures, he tells you about things:
 Time, eternity.  The significance of objects themselves, and of their
 relationships, of their proportions.  Of harmony, both moral and
 physical.

>again
 Too bad the price has been so great and the reward so slight.  Your
 mother's ring, all you had left of her.  Except, of course, the ruins
 of a house you cannot inhabit.

 Destruction gratifies you.  Proof of your strength.  In small ways the
 hardness you must practice here creeps into your action in the

 North Shore
 Against the rough north wall of the cavern lies a moon-shaped landing

 The only furniture is an ornate metal pole, branching at the top, with
 dozens of bells hung from the branches.

 The quiet after rain.

 There is a distant splash; a long silence; a repetition.

>wait
 Time passes.

 A dark shape distinguishes itself from the other darkness on the
 water: a small gondola without passengers, a single gondolier bent at
 his pole.  It is progressing towards you.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The gondola draws up against the ledge, its flank scraping stone.  The
 gondolier awaits.

>enter gondola
 The gondolier watches impassively as you clamber in.

 With a heavy sigh, the gondolier pushes the gondola off and begins the
 return journey to the south shore.  After a few minutes, you arrive...



 Shore of An Underground Lake
 A narrow ledge of solid rock at the southern end of a great cavern.
 Beyond it lies a body of water so flat, so black and tranquil, that it
 might be a surface of polished obsidian.

 A gondola waits nearby, the gondolier leaning against his pole.

 Embedded in the wall, a mirror reflects your movements: an odd
 smoothness in the unshaped stone.

 A heavy bronze bell hangs from a stand.

 The gondolier lifts his head and sighs softly.

>examine mirror
 A flat round mirror, which reflects you dimly in its face.  Around the
 edge runs the series of signs that fix an earthly object in an
 unearthly world: your master put this here for your return.

 The gondolier, apparently weary of the wait, pushes off from the ledge
 and is quickly merged again with the darkness.

>look in mirror
 (You bow your head to the inevitable, like an ox undergoing the yoke.
 And hate it.  Has nothing changed?)

 You slip through the surface of the mirror...

>push space
 And wake in your bed, drenched with sweat, with your blanket pulled
 around you.

 "You're back," your master remarks, seeing you stirring.  "It's about
 time."

 You glance at his hand; he is holding the dodecahedron, casting
 crescents of light around the room.  He follows your look.
 "Remarkable," he admits.  "You've done well."

 Reassured, you collapse back into the straw.  You're still tired --
 and who knows how soon he will have some new direction for you?  But
 for now, you've done well.  You've done well.

 You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of

 And hate it.  Has nothing changed?)

 Back home, fast as thinking.

 But your master cowers and trembles when he sees you, and cannot be
 made to know you until you put the knowledge into him.

 Your positions are, from now on, reversed: it is he who bows to you,
 who follows and obeys you.  Some rip has occurred in the illusion you
 called the world, so that everywhere you go, you find the substance
 and the structure beyond.

 Top of Cistern
 This is the rim of a great cistern, which is built of bricks and lined

 a spiral stair descends towards the surface of the water, more than a

 The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable

 Brass Menagerie
 A long, low room, naturally lit by small windows just beneath the
 ceiling.  Down the center of the room runs a series of pedestals, and
 on each pedestal stands an automated creature of some sort -- a great
 clockwork bird; a chorus of glass frogs; a pair of human dancers
 eternally whirling on the cogged floor of their tiny ballroom.

 Beside the door, and running down into the rock of the floor, is an
 enormous crank of Damascus steel.

 On the wall there is an adjustable lever.

>examine frogs
 Made of green Venetian ware, set in a pond full of lilies.  The
 largest is a bullfrog, with bulging eyes and a full extended throat.

 The water is done in several layers of glass, so that through the
 mottled blue of the surface you can discern the darting koi painted on
 the lower levels.

 It's hard to tell, from here, whether you are seeing sunlight or some

 But the light is too bright too look at long, whether it falls through
 glass or empty air; it carries no heat.

 (Yes, why not?  An easier way than to go home, in bitterness.)

 You leap, divide, return by multiple ways.

 Out of unity into multiplicity, out of time into the eternal instant.
 Feeling all the surface of the walls on your back, having the image of
 every angle in your eyes.  In this little space, you know as much as
 God himself: omniscience bounded in a hollow shell.

 You have reached the lowest extent of the stair, and stand on what

 until you come to dark unbeing and cool slumber at the world's heart.

 meat.  The horizon tips and sways, and you clutch the railing, trying
 to find your place, your balance.  You had not really even understood
 that there were such places as this in the world, let alone that you
 might come to them.

 Then someone shouts at you in gutter Spanish, and you reply without
 thinking.  In your glass, a fat English vessel is crowding sail.
 There will be a fine take before nightfall...

>examine ball
 A glass ball, like those that scryers use.

 And here you are, at home.  He hasn't seen you yet; he's still bent
