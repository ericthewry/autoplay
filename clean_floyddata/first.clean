 cucumbers are involved.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upside Down</span>
 You're suspended from the seat belt, which probably saved your life.
 Before you, a display of carelessly pressed flowers seen through a
 tangled network of fissured glass. There is an occasional sound of
 glass parting or metal yielding but the largest threat seems to be
 your inversion. To one side, a still inflated airbag obscures the
 driver.  On the other side, outside the car, there's a large metal
 thing and a small furry thing. Somewhere, you believe there are
 cucumbers.

 A comfortingly strong seatbelt holds you where you are.

 You can also see a cigarette lighter here.

>examine lighter

 Part of the car's standard equipment, it pushes in to heat and pops
 out when it's reached the ignition point of cigarettes.

>examine metal

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine driver

 Someone close to you, you remember that much.

>press lighter

 You manage to flail a limb at it and depress the lighter.

>examine airbag

 A big white puffy thing fills the left side of your vision. There's a
 sharp smell, as if someone had swept up all the dust from a library
 and packed it in to a pipe and smoked it.

>examine lighter

 Part of the car's standard equipment, it's glowing with a hot heat.

>take lighter

 With a boastful little POP, the lighter ejects. Fate is with you, and
 you snare it in your hand.

>put lighter on airbag

 Putting things on the puffy white airbag bag would achieve nothing.

>burn seatbelt

 The
 *** Run-time problem P10: Since the seatbelt is not allowed the

 It's finished! Hayashi corporation has finally finished the first time
 machine, and you have been chosen to use it for the first time! You
 begin to wonder what you should use it for. You could prevent world
 war I, go forward into the future, or anything else. Then, like a
 bullet from a high calibur rifle, it hits you! You're going to prevent
 Activision from buying Infocom!
 You fire up the time machine, set your destination, and step on it!
 The experience of driving a time machine reminds you of that old movie
 they call "Back to the Future."
 Then, the time machine grinds to a hault.
 It disappears, and a hollow voice says, When you're ready to return to
 the present, say plugh."

 released Milliways. At this time, Microsoft was supposed to release
 Windows 1.0, but they didn't! Eventually, people got sick of MS DOS,
 Apple DOS, Linux and UNIX. And that scruffy hacker? That was richard
 Stallman! He ended up creating everything he needed, and Linus
 Torvalds supplied the Linux colonel. However, People were too sick of
 computers to care! Now, this is critical. You have to return to the
 past, convince Infocom to create cornerstone, and convince Richard
 Stallman to go forward with GNU, or else we'll be living in a low-tech
 world! To go back to the past, say Plover."

>sex the farmer


 He is either male, or a very convincing transvestite. Your training
 only covered chickens.



 "Hold it right there, buddy," says the farmer. "I ain't lettin' you
 touch my chickens, until you've shown me you're qualified."

 A chicken of indeterminate gender.



 That's not a verb I recognize.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a certificate from the Zen-Nippon school of chick sexing



 As one of the first Americans to be certified in the Japanese art of
 chick sexing, you proudly carry this certificate.

>show certificate to farmer


 The farmer reads the certificate and snorts. "Zen-Nippon school, eh?
 Well ain't that just swell. Okay, buddy, show me what you've got."

>sex chick


 The chicken is too nervous. You need to make it calm down before you
 can do an accurate sexing.



 "There, there," you say, in the soothing voice you have spent years
 perfecting. "It'll be over in a second."

 The chicken peeks out from beneath its wings. After a while, it seems
 to decide that you aren't so dangerous after all, and emerges
 completely. It looks up at you with big innocent eyes.

>chicks dig sexers


 That's not a verb I recognize.



 Keep your mind on the game.



 Keep your hands to yourself.



 You carefully pick up the chicken with your expertly trimmed
 fingernails, and inspect its cloaca. In simple cases, the cloaca
 contains a small bead, the shape of which determines the gender. This
 is not one of those cases. To almost everyone in the world this would
 be just another chicken cloaca. To you, it's clearly male.

 Now that you know his gender, he somehow seems more like an
 individual. You almost feel like you should <span class="floydstyle i">name the chicken</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">something</span>.

>lick chick

 You decide to think of the chicken as "Male".

 The farmer smiles, revealing rows of yellow teeth. "I guess ya won't
 be givin' me any eggs, will ya?" He picks up Male from the table, and
 turns towards you. "Let's get to work. Plenty more where that came
 from."

 With that, he throws the gate wide open, and leaves the barn. You try
 not to think about Male. It's just a chicken, after all. Plenty more
 where that came from.

 towards you. "Let's get to work. Plenty more where that came from."

 Another day, another farmer in need of assistance. If it weren't for
 people like you, the entire American agricultural sector would've gone
 bankrupt years ago.

 You adjust your tie as you step out of the helicopter. Time to get to
 work.

 Piles of hay everywhere. A soft layer of sawdust covers the floor, and
 makes moving around feel like walking through coarse sand. The sun
 shines through the slits between the planks, causing crisscrossing
 rays of light to illuminate the dusty air.

 In the middle of the room is a large wooden table, on which a baby
 chick is currently trying to hide between its own tiny wings.

 The farmer stands by the gate to the south, waiting for you to do your
 job.

 Piles of hay everywhere. A soft layer of sawdust covers the floor, and
 makes moving around feel like walking through coarse sand. The sun
 shines through the slits between the planks, causing crisscrossing
 rays of light to illuminate the dusty air.

 In the middle of the room is a large wooden table, on which a baby
 chick is currently trying to hide between its own tiny wings.

 The farmer stands by the gate to the south, waiting for you to do your
 job.

>kill farmer


 You are not going to attack the farmer for the sake of some nameless
 chicken.

>kill chick


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>examine chick


 A chicken of indeterminate gender.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a certificate from the Zen-Nippon school of chick sexing

>show certificate to farmer


 The farmer reads the certificate and snorts. "Zen-Nippon school, eh?
 Well ain't that just swell. Okay, buddy, show me what you've got."

>pet chick


 "There, there," you say, in the soothing voice you have spent years
 perfecting. "It'll be over in a second."

 The chicken peeks out from beneath its wings. After a while, it seems
 to decide that you aren't so dangerous after all, and emerges
 completely. It looks up at you with big innocent eyes.

>sex chick


 You carefully pick up the chicken with your expertly trimmed
 fingernails, and inspect its cloaca. In simple cases, the cloaca
 contains a small bead, the shape of which determines the gender. This
 is not one of those cases. To almost everyone in the world this would
 be just another chicken cloaca. To you, it's clearly male.

 Now that you know his gender, he somehow seems more like an
 individual. You almost feel like you should <span class="floydstyle i">name the chicken</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">something</span>.

>name chick Herbert


 You decide to think of the chicken as "Herbert".

>kill farmer


 You consider trying to take down the farmer for Herbert's sake, but
 decide against it. He looks much stronger than you.

 You look at Herbert, and imagine that you see a flash of anger in his
 eyes. Your mind must be playing tricks on you.

>herbert, sic em


 [Use TALK TO to interact with characters.]

>talk to herbert


 You already made him calm down. Having an actual conversation is a bit
 beyond your skills.

>hit farmer


 You consider trying to take down the farmer for Herbert's sake, but
 decide against it. He looks much stronger than you.

 You look at Herbert, and imagine that you see a flash of anger in his
 eyes. Your mind must be playing tricks on you.

>kick farmer


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>kiss farmer


 Keep your mind on the game.

>hide herbert


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>kiss chick


 Keep your mind on the game.

>take herbert


 The farmer is watching you carefully. There is no way you can take
 Herbert without being noticed.

>pet herbert


 You gently caress the feathers of Herbert. He doesn't seem to mind.

>blind herbert


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>xyzzy


 Chicken sexing is not magic, even though it may appear as such to
 outsiders.

>name farmer adolf


 You only name chickens.

>take sawdust


 It's just sawdust.

>examine planks


 The barn is composed of old-fashioned wooden planks.

>take plank


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gate


 A large pair of wooden doors block the exit from the barn.

>throw sawdust at farmer


 (first taking the sawdust)
 It's just sawdust.

>hide chick in sawdust


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine table


 A sturdy wooden table.

 On the table is Herbert.

>look under table


 You find nothing of interest.

>open gate


 You can't leave until you've done your job.

>break planks


 You are a chicken sexer, not a barn architect.

>herbert, hit farmer


 "Herbert," you say with a confident voice. You raise your finger and
 point at the farmer: "Attack!".

 Herbert slowly stands up, looking like he might fall over at any
 moment. Then, almost faster than the eye can follow, he launches
 himself off the table, gliding through the air like a flying squirrel,
 towards the farmer. He lands on the farmers face and pecks at the
 eyes, furiously.

 The farmer drops to his knees and screams. "Aaargghhh! Not my vitreous
 humor! Get off me!" He rips Herbert off his face and throws him at
 you. "You're insane, both of you! Take that damn chicken and get off
 my farm!

 You catch Herbert in your outstretched hand. "You're the boss," you
 say to the farmer, and shrug. The sunlight caresses your face, as you
 step outside. It's going to be a wonderful day.

 You are never hired as a chicken sexer again, but that's okay. You
 have Herbert, and all the other chickens you manage to rescue during
 the next years. The neighbors start avoiding your house. They tell
 stories about the crazy chicken person, who lives in a house full of
 chickens, and talks to them all day long. It's fine. Who cares what
 they think?
