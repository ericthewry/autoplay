 Bonehead
 A Regrettable and Mostly True Tale by Sean M. Shore
 Release 1 / Serial number 110404 / Inform 7 build 6F95 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 East of the Platform
 It's a chilly September morning in lower Manhattan.  You're on your way
 to the Polo Grounds for today's potentially decisive tilt against the
 Cubs, who are only one-half game behind your Giants in the race for the
 National League pennant.

 You're just east of the platform for the Christopher Street stop of the
 Ninth Avenue Elevated train.  A ticket-taker filters access to the
 platform itself.  There's a short line ahead of you.  Not many people
 are headed uptown at this hour, but then, not many people are in your
 line of work.

 Some stairs lead down to the street below.

 [Everyone, especially those not pretty familiar with baseball, should
 type ABOUT].

 Bonehead is the mostly true story of Fred Merkle, major league baseball
 player for the New York Giants, and the mistake he made as a teenager
 that haunted him for the rest of his life.  There are some puzzles, but
 the primary emphasis is on setting and story.  Poking around is
 strongly encouraged.  Although it is possible to put the game in an
 unwinnable state, it will become painfully obvious within two or three
 moves that this has happened.  With a few UNDOs, you should always be
 able to get to a final (if not exactly winning) ending.  Needless to
 say, saving the game from time to time, especially once you're at the
 ballpark, is recommended.

 The game features a great deal of baseball-related activity and
 language, some of it antiquated.  If you are unfamiliar with baseball,
 you will doubtless be somewhat confused at times, but I have tried to
 make the game as forgiving to novices as possible.  See Baseball in
 Three Paragraphs in this menu for some basic information on the sport.
 Also, be sure to talk to everyone you can talk to, especially a certain
 right fielder on your team, and you will eventually learn what a
 ballplayer needs to know.

 Normal movement using compass directions is supplemented with GO TO

 Conversation is handled using Eric Eve's terrific Conversation
 Framework and Conversation Suggestions.  To initiate a conversation
 with a character, you can TALK TO the character, or SAY HELLO TO him,
 or ASK him ABOUT or TELL him ABOUT something.  Use TOPICS to display
 conversation topics.  Occasionally a character might respond to
 something not in his topics list.  You may also be able to REMEMBER
 advice that other characters have given you previously.

 From time to time the game will display images at the top of the
 screen.  Having a reasonably large window size may be helpful.  Note
 that these images are not in any way critical to game play, so
 sight-impaired players will not be at a disadvantage.

 Please send any comments, suggestions, and especially bug reports to
 mister_patient@yahoo.com.  Thanks for playing.

 Baseball is a pretty complicated game with many arcane rules -- I doubt
 very many fans can explain the myriad ways in which a pitcher can
 commit a balk (I can't) -- but for purposes of Bonehead, you only need
 to know a very few things.  These can be learned by careful reading or
 trial and error during play, but the information below may be helpful
 for those unfamiliar with the game.

 You are a batter, a runner, and a fielder in this game.  As a batter,
 you stand at home plate, attempting to hit balls thrown by the pitcher
 by swinging a bat.  (The mechanics of swinging will be explained to you
 in-game; please make sure to talk to your teammates about the art of
 hitting).  During batting practice, the pitcher throws balls for you to
 hit easily.  In the "real" game, however, the pitcher is your opponent;
 he attempts to keep you from hitting the ball, or hitting it well.  If
 you swing and miss at a pitch, it is recorded as a strike against you.
 If you decline to swing at a pitch, but the umpire deems it to be
 within the strike zone (roughly, from your chest to your knees
 vertically, and the width of the plate horizontally), it is also
 recorded as a strike.  Three strikes, and you are out.  If the pitch is
 outside the strike zone, it is recorded as a ball.  Four balls, and you
 are granted first base automatically (a base on balls, or a walk).

 If you hit the ball in fair territory during the game, you must run to
 first base; and from there, possibly to second base, third base, and
 back to home plate, which scores a run for your team.  The team with
 the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.  Note that the
 batter is required to try to advance to first base if he hits the ball
 and it is not caught in the air by a fielder.  If there is already a
 runner at first base, that runner must try to advance to second base.
 If the ball arrives at second base before that runner does, the runner
 is forced out.

 As a fielder, you are on defense: your goal is to put out the opposing
 players.  One of the primary means of accomplishing this is to touch
 first base while in possession of the baseball, before the batter can
 reach the base himself.  In Bonehead, you are a first baseman, so this
 task mostly falls to you.  On a ground ball, the other fielders will
 throw the ball to you; it's your job to catch it and make sure you're
 touching first when it arrives.  Of course, it's not always possible to
 do both at the same time.

 For a more complete explanation, clearer than anything I could have
 written, please see
 [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball#Rules_and_gameplay.">LINK</A>]  Even better:

 You're just east of the platform for the Christopher Street stop of the

 "Hey mister."  There's a tug on your coat.  It's a young boy in line
 right behind you.  "Hey, mister.  You're Fred Merkle, ain'tcha?  Hey,
 Mister Merkle, can I have your autograph?"  He thrusts a scrap of
 notebook paper at you.  Must be one of those really dedicated fans, I

 "Aw gee, mister, I'm real sorry about that.  I ain't got an extra

 the kid hurries up to the ticket-taker, across the platform, and onto a

 Christopher Street
 You're on Christopher Street in lower Manhattan, with myriad shops
 lining the thoroughfare on either side and pedestrians pushing in both

 west.

 In one of the shops -- a stationery store -- you spy a pretty young
 woman standing behind a counter.

 Leashed to a lamppost is an adorable little dog.

 little dog lunges at it, barking madly.  The pigeon flaps off to the
 west, with the dog in pursuit.

 The pretty young woman hears the ruckus, and looks up just in time to
 see her dog headed down the street.  She follows in a hurry.

>go west
 Corner
 Waves of pedestrians, carriages and pushcarts make their way through
 the intersection of Christopher and Greenwich streets.

 The little dog jumps up and down, slobbering all over the policeman,
 who is not enjoying the experience.  Then the pretty shopgirl comes by
 to claim her pet.  The policeman suddenly becomes an animal lover,
 scratching the dog's ears and rubbing his belly.  He blushes and begins
 chatting with the shopgirl.

 Some stairs lead down to the street below.

>show card to taker

 You show the baseball card with your picture on it to the IRT worker.
 He looks at it, examines you closely, and then says, "Hey, this is you!
 I'm not supposed to let anyone past here without a ticket, but I'm not
 going to be the one to hold up a member of the New York Giants!"  He
 steps aside and waves you through.

 On the Platform
 You're on a wooden platform above Christopher Street, waiting alongside
 a few other commuters for the next uptown train.

 A newspaper drifts down the platform in the chilly autumn wind.

>get newspaper

 You hear a rumbling from the south.  The train is approaching.

>SAVE

>read newspaper
 the sports headline.  But you already knew that; you were there, after
 all.  You dropped two games and let the Cubs right back into the
 pennant race.  Are you mentioned? -- there you are.  It's worse than
 you thought.  Aulick is in rare form.

 "Three men on bases.  Come on Crandall, and bang your way into a
 million hearts.  Three men on bases, and a single will tie the score.
 Come on Merkle, if they won't let Crandall bat.  We trust in you,
 Merkle, darlin'. You'd never throw us down now, would you, Merkle, with
 three men on bases, a single to tie, and a chance to win, out on the
 inning?  Of course, you wouldn't.  Step up there, good man, and play
 baseball.  Pshaw!  Why did you hit at that first one?  Why did you not
 wait?  It wasn't worth your effort.  Pick out a bonny one, Merkle, and
 then strike for the freedom of your sires, and a little bit more.  Not
 that one, not that, Merkle.  Didn't we give you waiting orders?  Never
 mind, there is one chance left.  Use it wisely.  Get a firm hold on
 your bat, and slash away yonder along third-base line.  If you are not
 in position, make it the right field, up as near the grandstand as you
 think you can get without fouling.  Or, if you think you can pull it
 off, a Texas leaguer will demoralize them.  Or you might -- Mr. Merkle
 has struck out, gentlemen.  Donlin, Devlin, and Bridwell, what of them?
 Were you ever at a reception where the lion of the hour and day came
 over to your corner, shook hands with the neighbor on your right, and
 the neighbor on your left, and then -- looked coldly past you and
 walked on, leaving you with your dexter fork extended in the air and
 feeling foolish all over?  That's how Messrs. Donlin, Devlin, and
 Bridwell felt when Mr. Merkle passed them up.  Let's all go home."

 Tomorrow's article is going to be much worse, I can assure you.

>get on tracks
 now, let's not contemplate suicide.

 The train pulls into the station, the doors open, and you step into the
 waiting car.

 Aboard the IRT
 You're on a standard elevated train car belonging to the Interborough
 Rapid Transit company.  There's a long bench on each side of the car,
 along with a few poles and straps for a standing-room only crowd, which
 this isn't.

>sit on bench

 You and the other passengers are whisked uptown.  Rapid transit,
 indeed.  In only a few minutes, you're already at 9th Avenue and 34th
 Street.

 Nearby, a gentleman you hadn't previously noticed scribbles furiously
 on a notepad.  "Blast!," he says to no one in particular, as the tip of
 his pencil breaks.  He looks at it forlornly.

 Aboard the IRT (on the bench)
 You're on a standard elevated train car belonging to the Interborough
 Rapid Transit company.  There's a long bench on each side of the car,
 along with a few poles and straps for a standing-room only crowd, which
 this isn't.

 Jack Norworth is seated here, notepad in hand.

>ask Jack about poem

 "No, not at all.  It's the beginnings of a song I might be able to use
 in a musical revue.  I was waiting at the train station a little while
 ago when I saw a sign that read Base Ball Today at the Polo Grounds."
 He waves his hands to illustrate the sign.  "I thought to myself,
 that's something that might make for a popular number."

 You could ask him about himself, the next bit of the song, musical
 revue or baseball; or tell him about yourself.

>ask jack about himself

 "I'm in the theater business.  I write songs for Tin Pan Alley, do a
 little singing and acting in vaudeville, that sort of thing."

>ask jack about the next bit of the song

 "Oh yes," he says.  "Miss Casey will be telling her gentleman caller
 that she'll go out with him as long as he brings her to the park, not a
 show.  I had a fleeting grasp of the phrasing I wanted a minute ago.
 It'll come back."

>ask jack about musical revue

 "I've been working on material for a new show, and the sign about the
 ball game just inspired me.  I figure the song might sell a few
 tickets, maybe draw some people in who might not otherwise go.  If
 anyone still remembers the song in a year's time, so much the better."

>ask jack about baseball
 You ask him how much he knows about the game.

 He chuckles.  "Not a lot, I must admit.  I've never actually been to a
 game.  But I do know what happens in one: three strikes and you're
 out!"

 You could tell him about yourself.

>tell jack about myself
 game today.

 "Well, I'll be damned!  Funny coincidence, that is," he says with a
 wide grin.

 The car gently rocks from side to side as it heads uptown.

>tell jack about baseball
 "Hm?"

 He seems oddly distant, then raises a finger.  "If you'll excuse me for
 just one moment," he says.  "I've got to get this down before I lose
 the wording."  You watch as he appends to the notepad Katie Casey's
 request of her young beau:

  Take me out to the ball game,
  Take me out with the crowd;
  Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,
  I don't care if I never get back.

 "There!  That's a good start, don't you think?"  The train slows down,
 and Norworth glances out the window.  "Anyway, this is my stop here.
 Very nice talking to you.  Good luck today!"

 With that, he departs.

>wait

 The 104th Street station recedes in the distance.  As the train
 approaches 110th Street, it slows down.  Looking out the window, you
 can see that you're perhaps 100 feet above the ground.  The train
 lurches dramatically to the right, practically at a 90 degree angle.
 This is what they call Suicide Curve.

>look

 The train travels along 110th Street, and then lurches again, this time
 to the left, as it turns onto 8th Avenue.  Good thing you're seated.

>wait

 The train pulls into the 155th Street station, its final stop, and
 yours.  You're at the far end of Manhattan, with the Harlem River
 before you, and the Bronx just across from it.  Below, you see the
 glorious Polo Grounds.  Beyond that, back the direction you came, is
 Coogan's Bluff, the great hill overlooking the park.  Fans without
 tickets can sit atop the bluff and watch the game, albeit from very far
 above.  They're affectionately known as hillbillies.

 The wooden doors open.  The remaining passengers start filing out onto
 the station platform.

>out
 Nice job getting here, Fred, but maybe it would have been better if you
 hadn't.  Allow me to demonstrate with a vignette from your future.






 (press any key)








 Daytona Beach, Florida, 1929.  You're forty now.  Aside from a handful
 of appearances in a Yankee uniform a few years ago, you've been retired
 from the game for about nine years.  All told, you had a pretty good
 career.  Lifetime batting average of .273, 61 home runs in the dead
 ball era, good defense, and five World Series appearances (all losses,
 unfortunately).  Still, no one remembers any of that.  What they
 remember, and what they never, ever let you forget, is the ninth inning
 on September 23, 1908.

 After enough abuse to last many lifetimes, you move down here with
 Ethel to become an anonymous citrus grower.  But you still love the
 game, even if it made you a national laughingstock, so you reluctantly
 agree to manage the local minor-league club.  It doesn't last long.

 "I don't need Fred Merkle the Bonehead to teach me how to pitch!",
 yells your own pitcher, when you lift him after a mediocre outing.  The
 words reverberate around the sparsely-attended park.  The guy in the
 back row must have heard it.

 It's about the millionth time someone has called you a bonehead in the
 last twenty years.  You'd think by now that either they'd be tired of
 it, or that you'd be used to it.  Somehow, neither has happened.
 Wherever you go, whatever you do, it is always with you.  In the
 Baseball Encyclopedia, Ty Cobb's entry lists his nickname as "The
 Georgia Peach."  Walter Johnson's says "The Big Train."  Care to guess
 what yours says, Fred?

 You quit your job as manager after the game.

 September 23, 1908.  After your commute on the IRT, you arrive at your
 workplace: the Polo Grounds.  They don't actually play polo here; they
 did in the original Polo Grounds, where the Giants also played, but
 this is a new park in a different location.

 It's a couple of hours before game time.  You've put on your uniform
 and you're warming up with the other fellows in preparation for sitting
 on the bench as usual.  The team is taking batting practice, and a
 small group is at the plate.  Roger Bresnahan, the Giants' veteran
 catcher, is taking his swings right now.  Turkey Mike Donlin and
 Christy Mathewson wait here for their turns.  Joe McGinnity is throwing
 from the pitcher's mound sixty feet away, and Fred Snodgrass is acting
 as catcher.

 The first baseman, Fred Tenney, comes limping up to you, clutching his
 back.  "Merkle, McGraw wants a word with you," he says, pointing to the
 Giants' dugout to the south.  Tenney slowly shuffles off the field.

 Home Plate
 This is home plate in your home park.  During the game, there will be
 fewer people loitering here, and somewhat less chit-chat.  A temporary
 backstop has been wheeled in for batting practice.

 The whole lovely ballpark stretches out before you, invitingly.  Your
 dugout is to the south, first base is southeast, the pitcher's mound is
 to the east, third base is northeast, and the visiting dugout is to the
 north.

 (You might be curious about these directions.  In the Polo Grounds, as
 in many other parks, the left field foul pole is roughly due north.
 This means that a pitcher standing on the mound facing the plate has
 his left shoulder facing south.  This is why lefties are called
 southpaws.)

 Matty and Donlin lean up against the backstop, chatting, while
 Bresnahan takes batting practice and Snodgrass catches anything
 Bresnahan doesn't offer at.

 McGinnity deals, and Bresnahan laces a solid line drive.

 McGraw back in Baltimore.  He's a terrific left-handed hitter, but what
 he really wants to do is become an actor.  He married the actress Mabel
 Hite a couple of years ago, which is probably good, since it will help
 keep him out of trouble.  He's gotten in more than a few bar fights in
 his day.  Back in Baltimore, he once urinated on a palm tree in the
 lobby of the Academy of Music, and then punched a showgirl, ending up
 in jail for a stretch.  He's called Turkey on account of how he sort of
 waddles around.

 Mr. McGraw.  He and Donlin both started their careers in '99, but Joe
 got a bit of a late start, debuting when he was already 28.  Called the
 Iron Man because he can throw pretty much every day (and did so twice
 yesterday).  Also, he works in an iron foundry in the off-season.
 Almost all ballplayers have to take a job over the winter to make ends
 meet.

 two of his innovations on the field: one, a helmet to be used while
 batting; and the other, shin guards, like an English cricketer might

>examine matty
 in all of baseball right now.  I don't think I'm giving too much away
 when I tell you that long after he has retired, he'll still be
 considered one of the all-time greats.  On top of that, he's tall, very
 handsome, educated (one of the few ballplayers who went to college),
 and a natural at pretty much everything he does, including bridge.
 He's one of the rare ballplayers who's accepted in polite society.
 He'd be utterly detestable if he weren't such a decent fellow.

 For many years, Christy and his brother Henry, who also pitched for the
 Giants, held the record for most career wins by a sibling tandem --
 Christy with 373, and Henry with 0.

 "Merkle, let's hustle!" That's Mr. McGraw's voice.  Better get to the

 Giants' Dugout
 This is the home team's dugout, and the place where you spend the
 majority of your time during actual games, since, well, you're not on
 the field.  It is not luxurious -- just a plain wooden bench and a roof
 to keep out the rain.  No amount of cleaning will ever remove the
 fragments of a million peanut shells or the tobacco stains from this
 place.  Home plate is north, and first base is northeast.

 You can see McGraw here.

 "Nice of you to drop by.  Next time when I call for you, rookie, you
 come over!  Got it?  Tenney's back is acting up, and he won't be able
 to go today.  You're starting at first base, batting seventh.  Go talk
 to Matty to make sure you two are coordinating on the field.  Then when
 you're ready, take some batting practice."

 You could ask him about Tenney, the Cubs, batting practice or yourself.

>ask him about the cubs

 "They've played us tough all year, and now they're only a half-game
 back.  Whoever wins today is in first place.  If we're going to win the
 pennant, we need to take charge and bounce back from yesterday's mess.
 Not going to be easy with Pfiester on the hill."

 You could ask him about Tenney, batting practice, yourself or Pfiester.

>as khim about pfiester

>ask him about pfiester

 "They don't call him Jack the Giant Killer for nothing.  He's been
 murdering us all year, and he's maybe their fourth-best pitcher.  It's
 infuriating, to say the least.  Ask some of the boys for tips on
 hitting him."

 You hear the crack of the bat as Bresnahan continues his batting
 practice.

>ask him about me

 "Don't blow it," he says.

 You hear a dull thud as Bresnahan pops one up.

>ask about tenney

 "I don't think he'll be out more than a day or two," he says, "but this

 Home Plate
 This is home plate in your home park.  During the game, there will be
 fewer people loitering here, and somewhat less chit-chat.  A temporary
 backstop has been wheeled in for batting practice.

 The whole lovely ballpark stretches out before you, invitingly.  Your
 dugout is to the south, first base is southeast, the pitcher's mound is
 to the east, third base is northeast, and the visiting dugout is to the
 north.

 Leaning against the backstop is a bat.

 Bresnahan stands in against Joe McGinnity, with Snodgrass crouched
 behind the plate.  Matty and Donlin watch the proceedings from behind
 the safety of the backstop.

>tie laces

>talk to matty
 Matty turns to you.  "Oh hey, Fred.  I heard you'll be starting at
 first today.  We'll be seeing a lot of each other, I think," he says
 with a wink.

 You could ask him about the Cubs, Pfiester, batting practice, hitting
 or playing first.

 Bresnahan's bat rings with solid contact.

>ask him about playing first

 "Yes, you and I will be seeing a lot of each other on the diamond this
 afternoon.  I know you're a good glove, Fred, so I'm looking forward to
 seeing what you can do out there today.  Just plant your foot on the
 bag, and give the boys a nice target for the throw," he says with a
 smile.  "But if the throw is off-line, forget about planting your foot.
 Go to where the ball is.  The most important thing is to catch it.
 We'd rather let the fellow be on first with an infield hit than be on
 second on a throwing error."

 (You can recall this advice later by typing REMEMBER MATTY'S ADVICE).

>ask him about batting practice

 "That's OK, Fred, you go as soon as you're ready.  Just get the bat and
 STEP UP TO THE PLATE.  You can DROP THE BAT when you're done."

 You hear the crack of the bat as Bresnahan continues his batting
 practice.

>ask about cubs

 "Oh, Joe Tinker," he says without hesitation.  "He's had my number for
 years.  But if you're talking about a rivalry on the mound, it's Three
 Finger Brown.  He and I seem to match up on the mound an awful lot, and
 he wins much more than his share.  But thankfully we won't be seeing
 him today, unless maybe in relief."

 You could ask him about Pfiester, hitting or Three Finger Brown.

>ask him about Phiester

>ask him about Pfiester

 He smiles and says, "I'm one of the worst hitters on the club, Fred.
 You might want to talk to someone with a chance of hitting him, like
 Mike over there," pointing to Donlin.

>ask him about hitting

 He smiles and says, "I'm one of the worst hitters on the club, Fred.
 You might want to talk to someone with a chance of hitting him, like
 Mike over there," pointing to Donlin.

>ask Donlin about hitting
 "Say, Mike, how do you approach an at bat against a tough pitcher?"

 "Well, kid, the way I see it, hitting is all about two things: pitch
 recognition and timing.  You have to be able to identify a pitch right
 out of the pitcher's hand, whether it's a fastball or a curve or a
 change or a spitball or something else.  You have to get good at
 anticipating where it's headed, too.  Pitchers are going to want you to
 chase their pitch out of the strike zone; you have to make them throw
 you your pitch.

 And then there's timing.  Pitchers are trying to foul up your timing,
 keep you off-balance, so they will vary the speed of their pitches.

 If it's a fastball, it's coming hard; you'll need to start your swing
 early.  For a fastball on the inside part of the plate, SWING EARLY TO
 PULL.  For an outside fastball, SWING EARLY TO THE OPPOSITE FIELD.  If
 they throw you something off-speed, like a changeup or a curve, it's
 going to be deceptively slow; you want to keep your hands back and
 swing late.  If it's inside, SWING LATE TO PULL, and if it's outside,
 SWING LATE TO THE OPPOSITE FIELD.  Of course, if it's out of the strike
 zone, you don't want to swing at all."

 You could ask him about batting practice, Pfiester, pitch recognition,
 pulling the ball or the opposite field.

>talk to him about batting practice

>ask him about batting practice
 next?"

 "That's OK, kid, you go when you're ready.  Just get the bat and STEP
 UP TO THE PLATE.  You can DROP THE BAT when you're finished."

 You could ask him about Pfiester, pitch recognition, pulling the ball
 or the opposite field.

 Bresnahan curses as the pitch jams him and his hands sting.

>ask him about pitch recognition

 "The first thing to identify is the spin.  A ball with backspin is
 going to be a fastball or a changeup.  A ball with forward spin is
 going to be a curveball.  A ball with no spin is a knuckleball, but
 Pfiester doesn't throw one, so you don't have to worry about that.

 You also want to get a look at the pitcher's grip if you can.  If the
 pitcher's any good, his motion with the fastball and change is going to
 look exactly the same, so you don't know which is which.  One way to
 tell is to get a look at his pitching hand when he's in his windup or
 in the set position.  If he's got two fingers spread out on top, and
 the thumb underneath, that's a fastball.  If there's three fingers on
 top, it means he's gripping it more tightly to slow it down.  It's a
 changeup.  Two fingers on the side along the seam means it's a curve."

 (You can recall this advice later by typing REMEMBER DONLIN'S ADVICE).

>ask him about pulling the ball

 "You can really drive an inside pitch if you try to pull it.  As a
 righthander, you pull the ball to left field," he says.

 You hear a dull thud as Bresnahan pops one up.

>ask him about the opposite field

 "You want to go the opposite way on a pitch on the outer half of the
 plate.  To right field, in your case.  Left, in mine."

>step up to the plate

 Bresnahan takes his last cut and then walks over to talk hitters with
 Matty.

 Having decided you've seen enough of the park, you step in to replace
 him, dig a comfortable spot for yourself with your spikes, heft your
 bat on your right shoulder, and get ready.  The club's veteran, Iron
 Man Joe McGinnity, is throwing batting practice today.  He's got a
 bucket of baseballs that he'll be throwing nice and easy to you.
 Everything will be somewhere near the strike zone, close enough that
 you can hit it.  "I'll keep throwing, and you keep hitting," he hollers
 from the mound.  "Just drop the bat to let me know when you're done."

 McGinnity begins his delivery.  During his windup, you notice he's got
 his index and middle fingers together, a little off-center.  The ball
 starts high and inside, then drops vertically, with what appears to be
 forward spin.

>remember donlin's advice
 Two fingers on top with backspin means it's a fastball; start your
 swing early.  Two fingers on the seams with forward spin means it's a
 curveball.  Three fingers on top with backspin means it's off-speed.
 Start your swing late for those two.  If it's an inside pitch, pull the
 ball; if it's outside, hit it to the opposite field.

 You take the pitch, and the ball pops in Snodgrass's mitt.

 Snodgrass flips a ball back to McGinnity.

>wait

 McGinnity winds up.  As he reaches the top of his motion, you can see
 that he's gripping the ball with three fingers spread out on top.  The
 pitch darts to the inner half of the plate, with what might be
 backspin.

 The hour draws near for the first pitch.  Both clubs are nearly done
 with their warm-ups.  The sausage vendors have begun frying up their
 wares, and the smell has begun wafting through the park.  You can hear
 the Ninth Avenue Elevated dropping off fans every few minutes.   Hank
 O'Day, who will be calling balls and strikes today, is rubbing up a few
 baseballs, and the groundskeeper is doing some last-minute tidying of
 the mound, to conform to Matty's liking.

 Your date with humiliation awaits you.  First, another taste of what's
 to come.

 A Sunday morning in church, circa 1936.  People are milling around
 before the start of the service.  They're your neighbors, for the most
 part.  They know to tread lightly around certain subjects.  Some other
 folks within earshot, not so much.  They're busy chattering away about
 the pennant races.  You try to shut them out, but it's impossible.  You
 can't not hear them.

 The reverend isn't here today; looks like they've got a visiting
 minister in.  He steps up to the pulpit, maybe a little nervous, clears
 his throat.  The crowd take their seats and wait expectantly.  "I want
 to begin," he says, forcing the sort of smile that accompanies a weak
 joke, "by admitting to you an ugly secret.  I am from Toledo, Ohio;
 birthplace of the infamous Fred 'Bonehead' Merkle!"

 A few of the other parishioners gasp, and you can feel their eyes on
 you.  Ethel squeezes your hand.  Well, that's just splendid.  It's one
 thing to hear it when you're umpiring an exhibition game  -- as
 happened a couple of years ago, the last time you tried to set foot on
 a major league diamond.  But now you can't even come to church anymore.
 You gather up Ethel and the kids and quietly walk out.

 The final indignity: you weren't even born in Toledo.

 The stands are packed with 20,000 cranks as the battle for the National
 League pennant begins.  The game is a very tight affair.  For the first
 four innings, Matty and Pfiester throw zeroes up on the board.  The
 Cubs' defense is a little shaky, but the Gothams cannot capitalize.
 You help out with a nice grab on Joe Tinker's line drive in the 2nd,
 but up until the final frame, you do very little with the stick --
 you're 0 for 2 with a walk.

 In the fifth, the Cubs strike.  It's Tinker -- Matty's nemesis.  He
 drives a ball to right that skips past Donlin.  While Turkey Mike
 scrambles to retrieve it, Tinker circles the bases for a home run.
 Cubs 1, Giants 0.

 In the sixth, Donlin gets his revenge by driving in Buck Herzog with
 the tying run.  Cubs 1, Giants 1.

 The pitchers' duel continues for another inning.  Now it's the top of
 the eighth.  You and the other Giants are out in the field, playing
 defense.  Johnny Kling, the Cubs' catcher, leads off for Chicago.
 There'll be a chance to avoid your fate here, if you so choose.

 First Base
 You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing
 your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your
 way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate.
 To your right is Buck Herzog, the second baseman.  The cranks along the
 first base line are almost close enough to touch.  They're certainly
 close enough to hear.  Most are shouting encouragement; a few, perhaps
 drunk, are heckling.

 Matty deals to Kling.  It's a fadeaway -- a Matty specialty -- and it
 runs right in on Kling's hands.  He makes a defensive swing, and taps a
 slow roller towards Art Devlin at third.  Kling dashes towards first
 base as Devlin barehands the ball.

>remember matty's advice
 "Just plant your foot on the bag, and give the boys a nice target for
 the throw.  But if the throw is off-line, forget about keeping your
 foot on the bag.  Step off and go to where the ball is.  The most
 important thing is to catch it.  We'd rather let the fellow be on first
 with a hit than be on second on a throwing error."

 Devlin starts to throw, but sees that you're not covering the bag.  He
 pockets the ball rather than risk throwing it into right field
 somewhere.  The cranks are screaming bloody murder, all of it directed
 at you.

 Matty.

 Kling dusts himself off.  "Didn't think I'd beat that one out," he
 says.  "Boy, Mathewson's been tough today, don't you think?  We're
 lucky to have gotten anything off him at all."  He looks down, points
 at your spikes and says "Hey, Fred, looks like your laces are untied.
 You might want to look at that."

>tie shoes.

 Matty paces the circumference of the mound as he rubs up the baseball.

>tie shoes.

 Matty gets back on the rubber and looks over to the dugout.  McGraw is
 signaling to Bresnahan.

>plant foot on bag

 With one on and none out, the pitcher, Jack Pfiester, steps up to bat.
 Bresnahan calls for time, and starts to trot out toward the mound.
 Matty waves you in as well, along with Herzog, Bridwell and Devlin.

>go northwest

 Matty is waving you over to confer with the other fellows.  Kling
 whispers over to you, and points to the north: "Merkle, I think you're
 wanted on the mound."

>go to mound
 This is the pitcher's mound.  It rises to a height of about fifteen
 inches to give the pitcher a better angle from which to throw.  In the
 old days, the hurler had a chalk-outlined box on level ground, and
 could throw the ball from anywhere inside that area.  (Thus the
 expression, "knocked out of the box", when a pitcher is hit hard by the
 opposing team.)  Nowadays the pitcher must throw from the pitching
 rubber.

 Home plate is west; second base is east; first base is south; and third
 base is north.

 You can see a rosin bag here.

 The entire infield is gathered here on the hill.  Bresnahan begins.
 "All right.  Pfiester is obviously going to be sacrificing here.  Let's
 go over what we're going to do."

>listen

 He looks at you and Devlin.  "Fred, Art: you two creep up a little bit
 when he squares around to bunt and be prepared to field the ball if
 it's hit your way."

>SAVE

 He then turns to Bridwell and Herzog.  "Al, you cover second.  Fred, if
 you field the bunt, Buck will cover first for you.  Otherwise, you
 cover first as usual."

 "Matty, get ready to help out if the bunt is right at you."  With that,
 Hank O'Day starts lumbering towards the mound to break up the
 conference and get the game moving.

 inches to give the pitcher a better angle from which to throw.  In the

 Home plate is west; second base is east; first base is south; and third
 base is north.

 You can see a rosin bag here.

 Bresnahan wraps things up.  "OK, everyone know what they're doing?"
 The other fellows all nod their assent.  Bresnahan heads back behind
 the plate, and Matty gives you a quick wink.  The other infielders,
 including you, move back to their original positions.

 First Base
 You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing
 your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your
 way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate.
 To your right is Buck Herzog, the second baseman.  The cranks along the
 first base line are almost close enough to touch.  They're certainly
 close enough to hear.

 Johnny Kling is here, taking a short lead off first base.

 Matty steps on the rubber.  He looks in at Bresnahan, who flashes the
 signs.  Matty nods, and sets.  He gives a quick look back at Kling, to
 make sure he's not taking a big lead.  Then he begins his windup.
 Pfiester starts to square around to bunt, holding his bat right out in
 front of him to deaden the ball.

>creep up
 Pfiester's bunt, should it come your way.

 Matty sets and delivers.  The pitch rides up high and tight to
 Pfiester.  There's nothing he can do with that pitch, but he tries to
 bunt anyway.  The result is a two-hopper, straight to Matty.  Looks
 like you've covering first base after all.  Kling takes off for second,
 and Pfiester heads to first, disgusted.  Instead of a sacrifice bunt,
 it's looking like a double play.  The cranks along the sidelines are
 screaming "Two!  Two!".

 Matty wheels around 180 degrees just as Bridwell reaches the bag.  He
 fires.  Bridwell takes the throw and sweeps his foot across the bag,
 just as Kling comes bearing down on him.  One out.  He steps to the
 outfield side of the bag, and gets set to throw the ball to you, to
 complete the double play.

>plant foot on bag

 Bridwell throws off-balance as he tries to get out of Kling's way.
 Even as it leaves his hand, you can see that it's starting to tail
 toward the home plate side of the bag.  It's still a little ways off,
 but you can tell that it's going to be a real stretch to field this
 cleanly when it arrives.  Time seems to slow down, as the image of a
 botched play flashes before you.

>go to ball

>unplant foot

 But then disaster strikes.  Your laces must have come untied again, and
 you trip over yourself, just as you're about to apply the tag to the
 Giant Killer.  Somehow Pfiester manages to avoid your toppling frame
 with a deft bit of acrobatics.  He's safe, while you collapse in a pile
 on the turf.

 Fortunately, you're not injured, just a little embarrassed, but it was
 an awkward play to begin with, and to most observers, it looked as if
 you were trying to avoid being run over by Pfiester while tagging him.
 Bridwell gets most of the blame for his errant throw.  The Cubs
 ultimately win the game 2-1, which is terrible, of course, but you will
 win other pennants with the Giants, and most importantly, you are not
 humiliated.

 taken in the middle of an inning.  Snodgrass goes out to replace you at
 first.

 "I don't know where your head is, Merkle, but it ain't in the game.  Go

 Cubs are now in first place.  From a team standpoint, this is obviously
 a disaster.  Personally, though, this is a godsend.  You played a role
 in the debacle, but Bridwell is the goat, not you.  You play the rest
 of your career, and live the rest of your life, as a solid,
 unremarkable, unremembered ballplayer.

 First Base
 You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing
 your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your
 way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate.
 To your right is Buck Herzog, the second baseman.  The cranks along the
 first base line are almost close enough to touch.  They're certainly
 close enough to hear.

 Bridwell's throw is as close to you as it's going to get.  It's now or
 never, Fred.

>examine shoes
 The laces they came with are oddly slick and perhaps a bit short as
 well, making them difficult to keep tied.

 The ball sails by as you make no attempt to catch it, ricochets off the
 tarpaulin, and rolls halfway up the right field line.  Pfiester easily
 trots into second, while Kling comes around to score.  The official
 scorer gives you an error on the play.  The crowd boos your
 mercilessly.  You even hear "bonehead" mixed in with the jeers.  Mr.
 McGraw leaves the dugout to pull you from the game, a grave step when
 taken in the middle of an inning.  Snodgrass goes out to replace you at
 first.

 "I don't know where your head is, Merkle, but it ain't in the game.  Go
 hit the showers.  It'll be a long time before you start again in this
 league," McGraw growls.

 The one-run lead holds up: Cubs 2, Giants 1 is the final score, and the
 Cubs are now in first place.

 The Pitcher's Mound
 This is the pitcher's mound.  It rises to a height of about fifteen
 inches to give the pitcher a better angle from which to throw.  In the
 old days, the hurler had a chalk-outlined box on level ground, and
 could throw the ball from anywhere inside that area.  (Thus the
 expression, "knocked out of the box", when a pitcher is hit hard by the
 opposing team.)  Nowadays the pitcher must throw from the pitching
 rubber.

 Home plate is west; second base is east; first base is south; and third
 base is north.

 You can see a rosin bag here.

 Bresnahan wraps things up.  "OK, everyone know what they're doing?"
 The other fellows all nod their assent.  Bresnahan heads back behind

 Pfiester starts to square around to bunt, holding his bat right out in
 front of him to deaden the ball.

 Across the diamond, Devlin creeps up towards home plate.  Herzog
 notices you not doing the same.  He flashes you a look as if to say,
 Can't you follow instructions, Merkle?  Well, it's too late now.

 Matty sets and delivers.  The pitch rides up high and tight to
 Pfiester.  There's nothing he can do with that pitch, but he tries to
 bunt anyway.  The result is a two-hopper, straight to Matty.  Looks
 like you've covering first base after all.  Kling takes off for second,
 and Pfiester heads to first, disgusted.  Instead of a sacrifice bunt,
 it's looking like a double play.  The cranks along the sidelines are
 screaming "Two!  Two!".

 Matty wheels around 180 degrees just as Bridwell reaches the bag.  He
 fires.  Bridwell takes the throw and sweeps his foot across the bag,
 just as Kling comes bearing down on him.  One out.  He steps to the
 outfield side of the bag, and gets set to throw the ball to you, to
 complete the double play.

>tie shoe

 Bridwell throws off-balance as he tries to get out of Kling's way.
 Even as it leaves his hand, you can see that it's starting to tail
 toward the home plate side of the bag.  It's still a little ways off,
 but you can tell that it's going to be a real stretch to field this
 cleanly when it arrives.  Time seems to slow down, as the image of a

 But then disaster strikes.  Your laces must have come untied again, and

 on the turf.

 Fortunately, you're not injured, just a little embarrassed, but it was
 an awkward play to begin with, and to most observers, it looked as if
 you were trying to avoid being run over by Pfiester while tagging him.
 Bridwell gets most of the blame for his errant throw.  The Cubs
 ultimately win the game 2-1, which is terrible, of course, but you will
 win other pennants with the Giants, and most importantly, you are not
 humiliated.

 the same ball is used for nearly the entire game.  Foul balls are

 make sure he's not taking a big lead.  Then he begins his windup.
 Pfiester starts to square around to bunt, holding his bat right out in
 front of him to deaden the ball.

 The Pitcher's Mound
 This is the pitcher's mound.  It rises to a height of about fifteen
 inches to give the pitcher a better angle from which to throw.  In the
 old days, the hurler had a chalk-outlined box on level ground, and
 could throw the ball from anywhere inside that area.  (Thus the
 expression, "knocked out of the box", when a pitcher is hit hard by the
 opposing team.)  Nowadays the pitcher must throw from the pitching
 rubber.

 Home plate is west; second base is east; first base is south; and third
 base is north.

 You can see a rosin bag here.

>touch ball

 Bresnahan wraps things up.  "OK, everyone know what they're doing?"
 The other fellows all nod their assent.  Bresnahan heads back behind
 the plate, and Matty gives you a quick wink.  The other infielders,
 including you, move back to their original positions.

 First Base
 You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing
 your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your
 way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate.
 To your right is Buck Herzog, the second baseman.  The cranks along the
 first base line are almost close enough to touch.  They're certainly
 close enough to hear.

 Johnny Kling is here, taking a short lead off first base.

 Matty steps on the rubber.  He looks in at Bresnahan, who flashes the
 signs.  Matty nods, and sets.  He gives a quick look back at Kling, to
 make sure he's not taking a big lead.  Then he begins his windup.

 you field the bunt, Buck will cover first for you.  Otherwise, you
 cover first as usual."

>tie shoes
 the laces, you feel pretty confident that they will finally stay tied.

 "Matty, get ready to help out if the bunt is right at you."  With that,
 Hank O'Day starts lumbering towards the mound to break up the
 conference and get the game moving.

 Pfiester starts to square around to bunt, holding his bat right out in

>creep up
 Pfiester's bunt, should it come your way.

 Matty sets and delivers.  The pitch rides up high and tight to
 Pfiester.  There's nothing he can do with that pitch, but he tries to
 bunt anyway.  The result is a two-hopper, straight to Matty.  Looks
 like you've covering first base after all.  Kling takes off for second,
 and Pfiester heads to first, disgusted.  Instead of a sacrifice bunt,
 it's looking like a double play.  The cranks along the sidelines are
 screaming "Two!  Two!".

 Matty wheels around 180 degrees just as Bridwell reaches the bag.  He
 fires.  Bridwell takes the throw and sweeps his foot across the bag,
 just as Kling comes bearing down on him.  One out.  He steps to the
 outfield side of the bag, and gets set to throw the ball to you, to
 complete the double play.

>catch ball

 Bridwell throws off-balance as he tries to get out of Kling's way.
 Even as it leaves his hand, you can see that it's starting to tail
 toward the home plate side of the bag.  It's still a little ways off,
 but you can tell that it's going to be a real stretch to field this
 cleanly when it arrives.  Time seems to slow down, as the image of a
 botched play flashes before you.

>set off bag

>step off bag
 throw from Bridwell.  It's now within reach.

 Pfiester is racing down the line as fast as he can, as the ball follows
 its errant arc, as near your glove as it's going to get.  The Polo
 Grounds faithful gasp.  It's going to be a tough play.

>catch ball
 you sweep your glove around, and barely graze a loose bit of the Giant
 Killer's jersey as he ducks to avoid your tag.  The umpire Bob Emslie
 saw it clear as day, though.  He makes a tagging motion with his arms,
 and yells "You're out!".  The crowd erupts in sustained cheers for a
 thrilling double play.  Matty turns to you and points, as if to say,
 Great play, Fred.

 You know, Fred, I admire your moxie.  Obstacle after obstacle in your
 way, and you've cleared them all.  But I've been trying to tell you,
 this isn't going to end well if you insist on trying to win.

 Let me make it perfectly clear.  Your name becomes a verb in the sports
 pages for the next few decades.  "To Merkle" means to make a colossal
 blunder.  "Merkle's Boner" will be perhaps the most infamous play in
 baseball history, at least until someone else screws up as badly.  You
 already know about your common sobriquet.  Not a game will go by for
 the rest of your career without your hearing it from someone.  To avoid
 having your tombstone defaced with "Bonehead," as it surely would be,
 you will be buried in an unmarked grave.  I am not joking, Fred.

 You've got one more chance to avoid this.

 Into the bottom of the ninth inning, with the score still knotted: Cubs
 1, Giants 1.  Cy Seymour, the Giants' center fielder, leads off the
 inning by grounding out to second base: Evers to Chance.  Art Devlin
 follows with a single off Pfiester to center field.  Moose McCormick,
 your left fielder, hits a ground ball to Evers, who throws over to
 Tinker at second base to put out Devlin.  McCormick is at first, with
 two outs.  Batting next for New York: Fred Merkle.

 The Polo Grounds crowd have risen to their feet in anticipation.  You
 stand in the batter's box, bat in hand.  Sixty feet, six inches away,
 Jack Pfiester glares in at Johnny Kling, getting the signs and twirling
 the ball in his left hand.  Umpire Hank O'Day crouches behind Kling.
 Out of the corner of your eye, you see Moose McCormick take his lead
 off of first base.

 Home Plate
 Though the bugs are screaming, and there's a runner on first, and a
 dugout full of teammates cheering you on, and two umpires and eight
 other Cubs arrayed in front of you, your field of vision is narrowed to
 the one man on the hill.  It's just you and Jack.

 Pfiester winds up.  During his windup, you can see that he is grasping
 the ball with two fingers spread out on top of the ball and his thumb
 tucked underneath.  The pitch tails away to the outer half of the
 plate, with tight backspin.

 what looks like a fastball grip.  The pitch flutters toward the inside
 part of the plate with a sort of loose backspin.

>swing late to pull
 swing and a miss.  Strike three.

 The official scorer marks a "K" for a strikeout.  Kling hands the ball
 to O'Day and the Cubs head to the dugout, all smiles.

 In the tenth, Chance leads off with a double, Steinfeldt advances him
 to third on a groundout to Herzog, Hofman flies out, but then Tinker
 strikes again.  He raps a single to left, Chance scores, and the Cubs
 win.  They're now in first place in the National League, and never
 surrender it.


 Your failure in the ninth is painful, but short-lived.  Everyone
 strikes out sometimes.  Two days from now, no one will remember the
 details of what happened in the ninth inning.

 dugout full of teammates cheering you on, and two umpires and eight
 other Cubs arrayed in front of you, your field of vision is narrowed to
 the one man on the hill.  It's just you and Jack.

 Pfiester has just thrown a pitch that looks like it won't get a piece
 of the plate.

>wait

 You let the pitch go by.  It's well out of the strike zone.  "Ball

 Pfiester gets the ball back as the din of the crowd grows ever louder.

 McCormick takes off towards second base.

>SAVE

>run to first
 wide turn, but there is no point in trying to stretch this into a
 double.  Your run doesn't count.  You settle in at first as the Polo
 Grounds cranks cheer wildly for you.  McCormick makes it all the way to
 third.  The winning run is only ninety feet away.

 First Base
 You're a few steps off first base, this time as a baserunner.  The
 cranks nearby are singing your praises.

 First and third, two outs.  Frank Chance, the Cubs' manager and first
 baseman, stands next to you, keeping you close to the base.  Al
 Bridwell steps up to the plate.  In the on-deck circle, Matty gives you
 a congratulatory nod.

 For the first time this inning, you exhale.  You've done your part,
 kept the inning alive, put the winning run in scoring position.
 Everything is right with the world.

 Pfiester and Kling agree on the pitch.  You take a few steps off first
 in anticipation.  Maybe a few too many steps.  You catch Bridwell's
 eye, and he looks at you as if to say, Are you nuts, Merkle?  Where are
 you going?  Pfiester steps off the rubber, and you scamper back to
 first.

>step off bag

 The crowd roars, cheering on Bridwell as he gets set for the pitch.

>lead

>wait

 Pfiester winds, kicks and delivers.  Bridwell swings -- it's a hit!
 McCormick starts racing home with the winning run, and the cranks go
 insane.  They start pouring onto the field, whooping in celebration,
 hoping to touch the idols of the Polo Grounds in the fading afternoon
 light.

 You are halfway to second base when Bridwell reaches first, and Matty
 and McGraw greet McCormick at home.  The roar from the crowd is
 deafening, and the field is swarming with the faithful.  The scene is
 utter chaos.

>go to second

 But it's a trade you can't make.

>wait
>run to second
 Avoiding the crush of fans, you head back to the Giants' dugout,
 hollering after your victorious comrades.

 What happens next is a matter of some dispute.

 In one account, Johnny Evers turns and yells to Solly Hofman, the
 center fielder.  Merkle hasn't touched second base.  The force play is
 still in effect.  Hofman finds the ball, throws it back in toward
 Evers, but Joe McGinnity, who had been coaching third, intercepts it,
 and throws the ball away into the crowd somewhere.  In the meantime,
 Evers gets the attention of O'Day, and somehow finds a ball.  Almost
 certainly not the ball Bridwell hit.  Just a ball.  He steps on second,
 and O'Day raises his right fist.  Three outs, and McCormick's run
 doesn't count.

 In some retellings, McGinnity doesn't intercept anything.  And Bridwell
 and Snodgrass both later say that Evers never had any ball at all, and
 that Chance just argued the point with O'Day.  What isn't in dispute is
 that you never touched second base, and thus McCormick never scored.
 It so happens that a few weeks earlier in Pittsburgh, a similar thing
 happened, and Evers tried to get O'Day, who was umpiring that game as
 well, to rule the player out.  He didn't, but Evers was determined to
 press his claim if it were to ever happen again.  And this time, he
 succeeded.

 This is the most infamous play in baseball history.

 There is no way to resume the game with the crowd on the field and the
 shadows lengthening.  The Giants press their case with the National
 League office, but the game is ruled a tie.  You are immediately
 crucified by the fans, and especially by the newspapers.  "Censurable
 stupidity on the part of player Merkle" is how W.H. Aulick puts it in
 tomorrow's New York Times, ignoring the fact that the rule you violated
 had never really been enforced.

 For the next two weeks, the Giants play poorly, but manage to hang on
 to a share of the lead in the pennant race.  The Merkle Game, as it is
 now known, is replayed at the Polo Grounds on October 8.  It's Matty
 for the Gothams once again.  Pfiester starts the game for the Chicagos,
 but gives way quickly to Mordecai Three-Finger Brown.  Matty is uneven,
 Cy Seymour drops an easy fly ball, and Brown is brilliant.  Chicago 4,
 New York 2 is the final score.  The Cubs win the National League
 pennant, and go on to beat Detroit in the World Series, four games to
 one.

 If it's any consolation, it's the last World Series they will ever win.

 No one on the Giants blames you.  "Being held close to the bag, the
 crowd rushing on him before he'd made it to second, seeing the winning
 run already cross the plate, why I think anyone would have done the
 same thing that Fred Merkle did," says Al Bridwell, many years later.

 "It is very unfair to put all the blame on Merkle for our losing the
 pennant in 1908," said Fred Snodgrass.  "McGraw never did, and neither
 did the rest of us.  It was mostly the newspapers.  They were the ones
 who invented the term 'bonehead.'  How could you blame Merkle, when we
 lost the play-off game and besides that we lost five other games after
 the Merkle incident?"

 Mr. McGraw is always your stalwart defender, and for years, turns to
 you for advice in tough spots.  But as far as the rest of the world is
 concerned, you are Fred Merkle, bonehead.

 July 30, 1950, the Polo Grounds.  It's not the same Polo Grounds.  The
 old wood park burned down in 1911.  The new one is on the same patch of
 ground.  You played here too for several years.  It's undergone some
 renovations since -- most notably, to enclose the whole outfield -- but
 it still feels like home.

 It's Old Timers' Day.  To your children's amazement, you accepted the
 Giants' invitation to come back.

 New Giants' Dugout
 You're in the dugout, mingling with some of the current ballplayers.
 There's Sal Maglie, the Barber -- so named because he pitches so high
 and tight that he shaves the hitters' stubble.  There's Alvin Dark, the
 terrific young shortstop.  Over in the corner is Bobby Thomson.  He'll
 have a big moment soon enough.  And you've just greeted the manager,
 Leo Durocher, famous for coining the phrase, "Nice guys finish last."
 He didn't say that exactly, but that's how people remember it.

 The public address announcer gets the attention of the crowd: "Our next
 returning player manned first base for the Giants from 1907 to 1915,
 appearing on three pennant-winning clubs.  A great fielder, a great
 hitter, and a leader on and off the field -- please welcome: Fred
 Merkle!"

>bow

>out
 the lovely, if crumbling, horseshoe-shaped park.  You brace for the
 worst.

 Then, something shocking and beautiful happens.  The crowd rises to
 their feet, and they cheer.  No boos, no heckling, no insults.  Just
 cheers and applause and love for you, Fred Merkle.  You wipe a tear
 away, and trot towards first base.

 Maybe Mr. Durocher was wrong.
