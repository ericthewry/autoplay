 Farm
 Leaves rustle in the spring breeze, and the soft calls of distant birds
 add a pleasant background. The barnyard is filled with muck. Nearby, a
 splintery old post juts from the mud. A rusty old cowbell hangs from
 the post.

 A perky pink pig is sleeping in the ooze nearby.

 A lunchbox lies forlornly on the ground.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

 "Please ... please hurry. My suit's almost out of air."

 "I'm almost to you. I've just left my buggy at the gate you described.
 How in the world did you find these ruins?"

 "Keep going ... there's a fountain up ahead. I'm ... leaning against
 the side facing away from you."

 "I can see the fountain. I'm approaching you now."

 "Thank you. Thank you. I thought I was going to die out here."

 "Uh ... there's nothing here. Is ... are there more fountains?"

 "..."

 "Hello?"

 "Sucker."

 Your pressure suit's short-range radio goes dead as the communication
 dies. Then, all you can hear is the sound of your own breathing.

 Moonwrecked
 An Interactive Fiction by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 110309 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Plaza
 Earthlight sheds a dim glow across the tall spire and broad basin of an
 empty fountain. The fountain is ringed with recessed lamps, but the
 lamps are currently off. The tall shadows of buildings block out the
 stars in all directions except west and south (the way you just came).

 You can see a fountain (empty) here.

>examine me
 You can't see much of yourself through the all-covering pressure suit,
 and you suppose no one would be able to see much of you, either.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a pressure suit (being worn)

>examine suit
 It's a basic but serviceable model - large and bulky, with a built-in
 short-range radio.  The orange and grey logo of the Prometheus
 Corporation is printed prominently on the chest.

>about
 This short interactive fiction game was written on Wednesday, March 8,
 2011 as a "practice" speed IF prior to PAX East 2011.  We used Glen and
 Karen Bledsoe's random prompt generator for inspiration at 6:00 PM,
 discussed our game (and took the subway home, and made dinner, and ate
 dinner) until 7:50 PM, and then wrote our game from about 8 PM to 11
 PM.  And then I added this help file.

 And then we celebrated with ice cream with maple syrup and rum.  (Colin
 wants you to know about the dessert.  Apparently, it's very important.)

>examine fountain
 The fountain is empty.

>get in fountain
 That's not something you can enter.

>fill fountain
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>exits
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west
 Obscured by the tall buildings of the city, no earthlight illuminates
 the area. You don't dare face unseen obstacles with no illumination.

>examine lamps
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine earth
 It's absolutely beautiful.

>take earth
 The Earth is too far away.

 That's hardly portable.

>switch on lamp
 You can't see any such thing.

>switch on lamps
 You can't see any such thing.

>remove suit
 The  Moon's atmosphere is far too thin for you to breathe.

>examine fountain
 The fountain is empty.

>; Should we explore south?
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>touch fountain
 You feel nothing unexpected.

>go south
 By the time you make it back to the gate of the mysterious city, you
 find an unpleasant welcome. Peeling away from the gate in a cloud of
 moon dust you see a lunar rover emblazoned with the logo of the Titan
 corporation, an exploratory rival to your own employer. You prepare to
 sprint to your own buggy, only to discover that it has been badly
 damaged.

 Someone, likely the "man in distress" whom you just tried to save, has
 taken a plasma welder to your buggy. Its tires and radio are completely
 destroyed, leaving you stranded in this beautiful but empty ruin and
 completely unable to contact your coworkers in the Prometheus Corp
 shuttle floating overhead.

 You look up at the shuttle, plainly visible in the earthlight but too
 far away to stand any chance of seeing you. You turn back toward the
 retreating form of the rover, barely visible now. Assured now that you
 will be stranded here for hours before the shuttle begins to worry
 about your safety, Titan will report exclusive discovery of this ruin,
 leaving you and your company in the dust.

 Immediately your mind begins to race, seeking a way to signal the
 shuttle. If only that spotlight overhead were pointed upward! If only
 it were turned on....

 Near the Gate
 This is the entrance to the mysterious city where you arrived in
 response to the distress call.  There is no pressure dome, leaving the
 dusty streets exposed to near-vacuum, but the buildings have the tall,
 rectangular shapes familiar to you from the Tokyo skyline.  Only the
 blue marble of the Earth high above sheds any light on your
 surroundings.

 There's a doorless building to the east.

 A massive gate stands wide open to the south.  A waist-high pedestal
 stands at the center of the gate, apparently preventing it from ever
 closing.  There is a tall spotlight nearby, but the spotlight is off.

 You can also see a moon buggy (empty) here.

>examine spotlight
 The spotlight is mounted on a tall pole and pointed down at the vacant
 pedestal.

>sturn on sportlight
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>turn on sportlight
 You can't see any such thing.

>turn on spotlight
 You don't see a power switch on the spotlight.

>examine buggy
 (the moon buggy)
 Your simple but trusty moon buggy is out of commission. Its tires have
 been utterly slagged under plasma fire, its rims partially melted and
 resting in the dust. While the battery housing is still intact and the
 dashboard controls look like they probably work, your saboteur took
 pains to specifically melt the long-range radio transmitter.

>examine battery
 You can't see any such thing.

>open housing
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine dashboard
 The dashboard is mostly intact, though it looks like your friend from
 Titan decided to shoot a hole in your radio controls, rendering them as
 useless as the transmitter. The only thing you could really operate to
 any effect at this point are the headlights.

>examine headlights
 The headlight switch is currently in the "off" position.

 The headlight switch is currently switched off.

>turn on headlights
 The headlights of the ruined buggy flare to life, casting light into
 the opening of the building to the east.

>examine pedestal
 You see nothing special about the pedestal.

>get on pedestal
 That's not something you can enter.

>climb pedestal
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>move spotlight
 It won't budge from its current position.

>go east

 Maintenance Recess
 This building is more like an alcove - hardly big enough to call itself
 a building at all, for all that it has three walls and a doorway
 leading back outside.

 Your buggy's bright headlights are visible through the doorway to the
 west.

 There's a control panel mounted to the back of the wall.  In the dim
 radiance cast by the buggy's headlights, you can make out three
 switches on the panel.  The switches are labelled "Gate", "Plaza", and
 "Residential".

>pull gate
 Nothing obvious happens.

>pull switch
 Which do you mean, the power switch labelled "Gate", the power switch
 labelled "Residential" or the power switch labelled "Plaza"?

>examine panel
 There are three switches on the panel.  All three switches are in the
 OFF position.

>switch on gate
 As you flip the switch to provide power to the gate, a bright light
 comes on from behind you, where you left your buggy.

>switch on plaza then switch on residential
 As you flip the switch to provide power to the plaza, the gate power
 switch clicks off.

 As you flip the switch to provide power to the residential area, the
 plaza power switch clicks off.

>go west

 Near the Gate
 This is the entrance to the mysterious city where you arrived in
 response to the distress call.  There is no pressure dome, leaving the
 dusty streets exposed to near-vacuum, but the buildings have the tall,
 rectangular shapes familiar to you from the Tokyo skyline.  To the
 north and west, you glimpse a yellow glow.

 There's a doorless building to the east illuminated dimly by your
 buggy's headlights.

 A massive gate stands wide open to the south.  A waist-high pedestal
 stands at the center of the gate, apparently preventing it from ever
 closing.  There is a tall spotlight nearby, but the spotlight is off.

>go west

 Residential Quarters
 Rows of elegantly-designed but otherwise spartan buildings line this
 road. The lack of any furnishings, vehicles, or signage increases the
 eerily sparse feel of the place.

 You can see a box of crockery here.

>examine crockery
 A cardboard box lies on its side on the ground here. Broken ceramic
 spills from its opening.

>eat ceramic
 You can't see any such thing.

>search ceramic
 You can't see any such thing.

>search box
 You open the box, immediately prompting a small avalanche of broken
 dishware. Delicately pawing through the rubble, you are able to find
 only a single intact dish. You pick it up.

>examine dish
 The dish is somewhere between a shallow bowl and a high-sided plate.
 Tiny blue flowers are painted around the edge.

>wear dish
 You can't wear that!

>SAVE

 A silvery, highly reflective liquid rises from the top of the fountain
 and flows down into the basin. The recessed lamps produce a panoply of
 delicate rainbow lights that dance softly around the plaza. The tall
 shadows of buildings block out the stars in all directions except west
 and south.

 You can see a fountain (in which is a falling stream of mercury) here.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to get the falling stream of
 mercury.

 You hold the china dish underneath the silvery stream. Within a few

 the center of the gate.

 You can also see a moon buggy (empty) here.

>put dish on pedestal
 You carefully set the dish on the pedestal, adjusting it so that the
 beam of light from the powerful spotlight reflects off the silvery
 liquid and up toward your waiting ship.

 You hold your breath with nervous anticipation as you see the
 spotlight's beam, unimpeded by the thin atmosphere, reach the
 far-distant Prometheus Corp shuttle. After a few seconds, you jostle
 the china dish, making the surface of the silvery liquid ripple and
 split the beam of light. You repeat this pattern for several minutes, a
 sick feeling slowly dawning on you that your attempt will fail.

 Just as you are about to lose hope, however, you see the shuttle fire a
 jet, changing its position. Your heart hammers in your chest as the
 shuttle maneuvers, and you have to resist crying out with joy as you
 see it release its spare buggy toward the surface of the moon. It's not
 too late after all, and those Titan bastards should have known you
 wouldn't give up without a fight....

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 It is the hottest summer of all time (or at least it feels that way now
 that your electricity has been cut off). Your lack of employment has
 finally caught up with you. Your funds have been depleted and your
 pockets are empty. Last month's essentials (cable television and
 Internet access) are now but sweet memories. The lack of air
 conditioning feels like the final straw. You were really hoping to
 starve to death at a comfortable 68 degrees.

 Yesterday for lunch you boiled and ate two hot dog wieners. For dinner,
 you drank the water you boiled them in. (Mmm, "Hot Dog Soup".) So far
 your dignity has kept you from rummaging through trash cans for food,
 but it's starting to sound like a viable option. Just the thought of
 sinking your teeth into someone else's left over pizza crust makes your
 mouth water.

 The current economy has made it hell for a spoiled, out-of-work
 computer programmer such as yourself to find work.  It wasn't too long
 ago that a five-figure salary seemed beneath you; today, given your
 current state of affairs, you would accept four. It's time to find a
 job and find some food, and find them today.

 Living Room
 While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back
 when you were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place
 up. Now that you have all the time in the world, you have no money.
 Even in hard times, you retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch
 sits along one wall, facing your cheap (and empty) entertainment
 center. The front door of your home is to the NORTH. Your dining room
 lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.

 (First time playing Hangar 22? Type ABOUT. Need a list of common
 commands? Type COMMANDS.)

 Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming
 in, and vice versa (it's called physics).

 You can also see a couch, a fish bowl, an entertainment center and a
 coffee table (on which is a remote control) here.

>about

 Welcome to HANGAR 22, an exciting new text adventure written by Rob
 O'Hara. Perhaps "exciting" is an overstatement (and heck, it's not even
 all that original!), but regardless, I hope you enjoy playing it as
 much as I enjoyed creating it.

 Hangar 22 was written using Inform 6. Despite my best efforts, you may
 find minor glitches as the two of us move through this game together.
 As I once asked of my prison cellmate, "Go easy on me." (He didn't.)
 For the record, I believe Hangar 22 qualifies as a "text adventure" and
 not "interactive fiction". I'm afraid you'll find no deep literary
 meaning here. My personal gaming experience with the medium lies in
 old-school text adventures, and the design of this game directly
 reflects that.

 Hangar 22's scoring system is very simplistic, and revolves around the
 completion of tasks. This results overall in a low scoring game, but
 based on your score you should be able to tell how many major tasks you
 have completed and how many you have left. The game contains a total of
 11 points. To truly win the game, you will need to acquire all 11
 points.

 Hangar 22 uses Brendan Barnwell's OKBScript for its menu-driven
 dialogue. Whenever you encounter a person you wish to speak with,
 simply type TALK TO NAME ("NAME" being the person's name) and you will
 be presented with a list of things you can say to the person. I am not
 completely sold on menu-style dialogue in text adventures, but as a
 first time author I thought it sounded easier to program. You can also
 talk to some objects.

 Hangar 22 supports the commands HELP (or HINT) and CHEAT. By typing
 HELP or HINT and hitting ENTER, the game will give you a hint that
 should nudge you in the right direction. For additional assistance,
 type CHEAT. You can try this with many objects as well (HINT COUCH or
 CHEAT PENCIL). Both HELP/HINT and CHEAT may reveal game spoilers, so
 don't use them unless you're really stuck! If you mess up, UNDO undoes
 the last command you just typed.

 Hangar 22 was beta-tested by Robb Sherwin, Jeff Martin, Ian Morris, Joe
 Ratulowski, Matt Roark, NZ17, Seth Spurlock, and multiple members of
 the Jolt Country and Gas Chamber forums. I could not have completed
 this game without Robb Sherwin's assistance. Thanks again, Robb!

 Work on Hangar 22 began in September of 2010 and was completed in April
 of 2011. I grew up playing text adventures in the late 70s, stopped in
 the mid-80s, and had my interest rekindled by Jason Scott's documentary
 Get Lamp. Hangar 22 is dedicated to Jason Scott, Robb Sherwin, Sam
 Patterson, Scott Adams, and my dad, Denny O'Hara, who introduced me to
 my first text adventure at the age of seven. Thanks to everyone still
 writing Interactive Fiction games, and most of all, special thanks to
 YOU for PLAYING THIS ONE.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine me
 You look roughly like an out of work computer programmer ... which,
 coincidentally, is exactly what you are. Your clothes are baggier than
 normal, thanks to your mandatory recent "low-food-intake" diet. Years
 of sitting behind computer keyboards have given you lean fingers and a
 pot belly, but when push comes to shove, you clean up nice.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>take remote
 Taken.

>examine remote
 If buttons are any measurement of manhood, owning this remote makes you
 a stud among studs. Back in the day, this bad mamma-jamma controlled
 everything you owned: your television, your DVD player, your cable box,
 your stereo, your coffee pot, and sometimes even your neighbor's
 automatic garage door. Over the past few months you've sold everything
 the remote used to control, but you keep the remote as a reminder of
 happier times.

>open remote
 That's not something you can open.

 Living Room
 While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back
 when you were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place
 up. Now that you have all the time in the world, you have no money.
 Even in hard times, you retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch
 sits along one wall, facing your cheap (and empty) entertainment
 center. The front door of your home is to the NORTH. Your dining room
 lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.

 Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming
 in, and vice versa (it's called physics).

 You can also see a couch, a fish bowl, an entertainment center and a
 coffee table here.

>examine couch
 The couch is wrapped in an orange and brown floral print, which must've
 been popular decades ago when the couch was manufactured. The bottom
 edges of the couch are scuffed and ripped. The main seam that runs
 along the top is unravelling, and the left-hand cushion literally has a
 spring poking through the fabric. What few meals you eat are typically
 eaten here; what food doesn't make it to your mouth usually falls down
 between the cushions ... which explains the smell.

 The couch is at least 40 years old, and looks it. All told, it's one of
 the nicer things you own.

>search couch
 Sticking your hand between the cushions reveals a handful of change and
 an old burrito, both of which you pull out and set aside. Say ... who
 knows what another search might yield!

>again
 Reaching waaaaay, waaaaay down inside the couch you feel ... the floor.
 Cue sad trombone sound effect here.

>examine change
 It's about a buck's worth of change -- mostly nickels and pennies, some
 stickier than others.

>cue sad trombone
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine burrito
 It's a "Taco Flaco" burrito, which is odd since you haven't eaten there
 in a couple of weeks now. The burrito is covered in a five-o'clock
 shadow of green fuzz. Nothing (and I mean NOTHING) good can come from
 eating this.

>examine center
 The particle wood bows in the middle where your television used to sit.
 Your television, DVD player, and stereo used to sit together on the
 entertainment center. Now, they sit together at Bad Brad's BBQ and
 Pawn.

>examine fish bowl
 This large fish bowl is where Goldie, your pet goldfish, used to live.
 Even when you were at your lowest, Goldie was always there for you. He
 was a good friend and a good companion, and two days after you ran out
 of peanut butter, he was a good snack.

 The bowl used to contain water, rocks, fake plants, and a little
 treasure chest that opened and closed. None of those things seemed
 edible, so after Goldie's demise they all went in the trash. All that's
 left is the bowl itself.

 Yeah ... no. Here's a short list of things that sound more appetizing

 While the colored buttons do somewhat resemble Skittles, surely you can

 Living Room
 While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back
 when you were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place
 up. Now that you have all the time in the world, you have no money.
 Even in hard times, you retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch
 sits along one wall, facing your cheap (and empty) entertainment
 center. The front door of your home is to the NORTH. Your dining room
 lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.

 Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming
 in, and vice versa (it's called physics).

 You can also see a couch, an entertainment center and a coffee table
 here.

>go west

 Dining Room
 The word "room" is a bit of a misnomer; it's more of a nook, and a
 sparse one at that. In the middle of the room on top of a rug sits a
 small table and two chairs. On the wall is a small tack where you hang
 your house key. Your kitchen is to the SOUTH, and the living room is to
 the EAST.

 You can see a house key, a trash can (which is empty) and a table (on
 which are a napkin and a pen) here.

>examine rug
 Despite the fact that it slightly smells of urine, the rug really ties
 the room together.

>examine valued

>take all from table

 The table is old and tired. It gets passed around between family

 own it because of its style; you own it because it was free.

>examine napkin

>look under table

>examine pen
 You bought two, since the thought og buying only one seemed depressing.

 It's a generic ink pen with a black cap. You try to keep one or two on
 the table.

>write on napkin
 Using the pen, you write "COUPON" across the top of the napkin in bold
 letters. Below that in smaller letters, you write "10 TACOS FOR A
 DOLLAR".

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine key
 Sometimes you like to pretend this is the key to the city, given to you

 It's about a buck's worth of change -- mostly nickels and pennies, some
 stickier than others.

>go south

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is small and somewhat dark. Even back when you had
 electricity, the room wasn't all that impressive. Now, it's essentially
 useless. All the basics are here (a refrigerator, a stove, a
 microwave), but without any electricity they aren't of much use. The
 SOUTH end of the room contains a small pantry. The dining room is to
 your NORTH.

 You can see a coffee mug here.

>examine mug
 The mug proclaims you are the "World's Greatest Dad", and who are you
 to argue? To date the only thing you've given birth to is unhealthy
 living conditions, but should you ever actually procreate, you feel
 like owning the mug gives you a head start. In the coffee mug
 department, you're the opposite of a procrastinator. You're like a ...
 precrastinator.

>examine me
 You look roughly like an out of work computer programmer ... which,
 coincidentally, is exactly what you are. Your clothes are baggier than
 normal, thanks to your mandatory recent "low-food-intake" diet. Years
 of sitting behind computer keyboards have given you lean fingers and a
 pot belly, but when push comes to shove, you clean up nice.

 where you kept it.

 You can see a candy bar and a bag of Reese's Pieces here.

>take all
 candy bar: Taken.
 bag of Reese's Pieces: Taken.

>examine candy bar
 It's a Three Muskateers bar. Its fairly misshapen from sitting in your

 You remember buying the Reese's Pieces to hand out for Halloween, but
 you can't remember which year. Reese's have never been a favorite snack
 of yours, so there they sit, waiting for next year's trick-or-treaters.
 Fortunately, candy doesn't have a shelf life. (At least that's what the
 guy at the dollar store told you while checking out. Come to think of
 it, perhaps he was being sarcastic.)

 Blech, no thanks. You don't even like them when they're fresh, much
 less a decade old.

 Not right now. You know what they say, "Candy is dandy, but tacos are
 ..." Well I can't remember how it goes, but the point is you're in the
 mood for tacos, not chocolate. Because you know what they say, "Meat

 Bedroom
 This is where "the magic" happens ... if, by "magic", you mean crying
 yourself to sleep at night while listening to your stomach growl. To
 make ends meet a few months ago you pawned your bed frame, but kept the
 mattress. (You would have pawned the mattress too, but "apparently" it
 had one stain too many.) In the corner is your closet. Your small
 bathroom is to the EAST. Your living room is back NORTH.

 You can see a mattress here.

>examine mattress
 Your mattress sits on the floor in the corner of your bedroom --
 classy, for sure. The mattress has multiple small stains, and covers a
 larger stain on the carpet beneath. A wrinkled sheet covers the stains.

 Front Porch
 Like the inside of your house, the front porch is small and cozy. When
 you first moved in you bought a small chair and placed it on the porch
 with dreams of spending your evenings drinking beer and enjoying the
 scenery. You ran out of money for beer months ago, and the scenery
 consists of the dog across the street that continually barks and
 neighborhood kids that give you the finger everytime they see you.
 These days the porch serves as a place to put your chair and mount your
 mailbox. Your driveway is EAST from here; your house is back to the
 SOUTH.

 The front door is open, potentially letting in heat, flies, and bill
 collectors.

 You can also see a mailbox (which is closed) and a man here.

>examine man
 Wearing a black suit, white shirt, black tie, black gloves and
 sunglasses, the man looks more like one of the Blues Brothers than a
 door-to-door salesman. He certainly doesn't look like any bill
 collector you've ever seen, and you've seen your share. The man looks
 more like one of the Men in Black, and not in a funny "Will Smith" kind
 of way. In his left hand, the man carries a clipboard.

>examine mailbox
 The mailbox is small and rusty. Although all you get are bills and
 collection notices these days, this used to be where your Netflix
 movies arrived. Boy, you sure miss Netflix. With over 60,000 titles and
 20 million members in the United States and Canada, Netflix is the
 world's leading Internet subscription service for enjoying movies and
 TV shows. For $7.99 a month, Netflix members can instantly watch
 unlimited movies and TV episodes streamed over the Internet to PCs,
 Macs and TVs. Among the large and expanding base of devices streaming
 from Netflix are Microsoft's Xbox 360, Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PS3
 consoles; an array of Blu-ray disc players, Internet-connected TVs,
 home theater systems, digital video recorders and Internet video
 players; Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, as well as Apple TV and
 Google TV. In all, more than 200 devices that stream from Netflix are
 available in the U.S. and a growing number are available in Canada.

 (This mailbox was sponsored by Netflix. To sponsor an object in one of
 my upcoming games, please contact me.)

>open mailbox

 Either this guy is a complete weirdo, or he's doing a perfect

 The man's suit, in combination with the hot summer sun, has caused him
 to begin sweating. Is that silver sweat? Or is the guy wearing makeup?
 Something's definitely not right with this dude. "Perfect," the man
 manages to say on his second attempt. The man proceeds to muster up the
 weirdest looking smile you have ever seen -- it's like the guy learned
 how to smile by looking at pictures of people smiling poorly. "We look
 forward to seeing you tomorrow."

 As you extend your hand in an attempt to shake hands with Captain
 Creepazoid, he places a business card into it. "The address is on the
 card."

 You look down and see the business card in your hand. When you look up
 again, you see the man has vanished.

 Driveway
 Your driveway is where you park your car. It's as interesting as a
 giant flat slab of concrete can be. To the WEST is your front porch.

 You can see an El Camino here.

>examine el camino
 She's a beauty, isn't she? You still refer to her as the Brown Bomber
 (in reference to the car's original color), but after thirty hard years
 of service it's getting more and more difficult to determine where the
 paint ends and the rust begins. The inside of your El Camino is almost
 as beautiful as the outside -- which is to say, "not very". Randomly
 scattered throughout the car are more stains, splotches, and sticky
 spots than the floor of your average adult theater. The ignition juts
 slightly from the steering column; someone busted the ignition for you
 while attempting to steal the car, and it now turns freely without a
 key.

 She burns more fluids than rubber these days, but she's paid for and
 she still runs. Usually.

>enter car
 You get into the El Camino.

>enter car
 But you're already in the El Camino.

>drive
 What, drive around aimlessly? Once inside your car, talk to your GPS
 and pick a destination.

>examine gps
 The GPS is a Sir Guide-A-Lot 350 model -- apparently, a promotional
 item bundled with Sir Mix-A-Lot's last album, "Where My Homies At?".
 While the GPS is slow, clunky, and rarely accurate, by far its most
 annoying feature is the fact that it constantly shouts at you in Sir
 Mix-A-Lot's voice. (Whoever authorized the combination of a has-been
 rapper's voice with a barely functional GPS didn't do much in the way
 of market research.) The only reason you haven't pawned it yet is that
 "350" denotes not only the model, but also its current value. In pesos.
 You found the device abandoned in a Taco Flaco bathroom, and each time
 you use the thing you are convinced that its former owner left it there
 intentionally. The unit's only redeeming value is its voice recognition
 feature. You can simply TALK TO GPS and it gives you directions.

 "BUTTERMILK BISCUITS, HEW HEWWWWW!" says Sir Guide-A-Lot. (Jesus, you
 hate that thing.) After a moment or two of processing, the GPS finishes
 its calculations, and off you go. The unit calculates a path that leads
 you through several back alleys you've never seen before and at least
 one third-world country. Stupid piece of junk. Despite Sir
 Guide-A-Lot's best effort at losing you, you finally arrive at ...

 Taco Flaco Drive-Thru
 Even as broke as you are, you can still eat like a king at Taco Flaco.
 You applied for a job here once but were told you were overqualified,
 what with your high school degree and all. (It all worked out for the
 best -- you wouldn't have had the stomach to club the baby chickens
 needed to make those little bite-sized burritos, anyway.) None of the
 employees are too bright, which is why your coupon scam continues to
 work. (For years now you've been handwriting your own "ten tacos for a
 dollar" coupons.) The staff is rude and the restaurant is dirty, but
 it's a fact that they make the best tacos in all the land. (And by "the
 land" I mean, "within three miles of your house".

 You can see a Taco Flaco Drive-Thru Sign here.

>examine sign
 Taco Flaco is known for a lot of things (the quality of their food, the
 rudeness of their employees, that time someone found a human foot
 inside their burrito ...), but menu diversity is not one of them. The

 "I don't have any money. Whatcha got for free?" you ask. After a moment
 of silence, the voice at the windows tells you to pull up.

 Working the drive-thru window (as usual) is Gloria, the sexiest
 seniorita to ever don a Taco Flaco uniform. If anyone can make a
 polyester shirt with a poor drawing of a taco with arms, legs and a
 smile on it romantic, it's this girl. Her hair, her smile, her fake
 gold tooth ... there's just nothing about this girl that you don't
 adore.

 Gloria slides the drive-thru window open and spits a loogie directly
 into your face.

 "Thank you, come again," she says, closing the window. It would seem
 you chose ... poorly.

 Intersection
 You are sitting inside your car at the end of the Taco Flaco
 drive-thru. All the other buildings you can see are vacant (it's not
 the best part of town). Other Taco Flaco drive-thru customers are
 behind you, honking their horns. It's time to use the GPS to get you
 out of this mess.

 DRINK. WITH NO SPIT IN IT!"

 After a few moments of silence, the voice asks you a question. "Would
 you like to add three flautas for a dollar?"

 Is this chick messing with you? Doesn't she know how crazy you are?
 You're about to rob a place you frequent regularly with no mask and
 nothing remotely resembling a weapon. YOU ARE EL GRINGO LOCO!

 "Yeah, sure, I'll take the flautas," you say.

 "Okay," the woman responds. "Please drive around."

 "Wow, that was pretty easy!" you say to yourself. As you pull up to the
 drive-thru window, it slides open to reveal not a bag full of money,
 tacos, three flautas and a drink with no spit in it, but rather the
 business end of a shotgun.

 Just moments ago, you had tacos on the brain. Now, your brains are
 about to be splattered all over Taco Flaco. Sometimes, the jokes just
 write themselves. You chuckle nervously.

 Adios, El Gringo Loco. Click, Click, BOOM!

 What do you want to say to the Taco Flaco Drive-Thru Sign?

 "I sure do," you respond. From the speaker you hear a long sigh,
 followed by the words "Pull around."

 Standing at the drive-thru window is Gloria, the hottest mamacita in
 all of Flaco land. Each time you see her you wish she were your age,
 but you would settle for "legal" (both in terms of age and
 citizenship).

 You place the pathetic coupon and fist full of sticky change into
 Gloria's soft hand. In return, Gloria hands you ten delicious tacos.
 Score!

 Intersection
 You are sitting inside your car at the end of the Taco Flaco
 drive-thru. All the other buildings you can see are vacant (it's not
 the best part of town). Other Taco Flaco drive-thru customers are
 behind you, honking their horns. It's time to use the GPS to get you
 out of this mess.

 Driveway (in the El Camino)
 Your driveway is where you park your car. It's as interesting as a
 giant flat slab of concrete can be. To the WEST is your front porch.

 You are inside your El Camino. Mounted to the dash with copious amounts
 of duct tape is your voice activated GPS. You can't find anything
 without it.

>examine glove compartment
 You can't see any such thing.

>search car
 The El Camino is empty.

>eat tacos
 You unwrap the first taco slowly, savoring the smell of the meat and
 the sound of the crinkling paper. You take a bite -- and another, and
 another. With the first taco shoved completely in your mouth, you
 unwrap the second. Like a kid on Christmas, you open each taco faster
 than the previous one. Teeth gnashing, you rip through the pile of
 tacos like a buzzsaw. Each taco is like a box of Cracker Jacks with a
 surprise inside (a fingernail here, a cigarette butt there), but you
 don't let that stop you. Before you know it all ten tacos have been
 consumed, leaving only a pile of wrappers behind. You. Feel. GREAT!

 After eating, all that's left in your hands is a big pile of wrappers.
 Say, you should put THOSE in the TRASH!

>go west

 Front Porch
 Like the inside of your house, the front porch is small and cozy. When
 you first moved in you bought a small chair and placed it on the porch
 with dreams of spending your evenings drinking beer and enjoying the
 scenery. You ran out of money for beer months ago, and the scenery
 consists of the dog across the street that continually barks and
 neighborhood kids that give you the finger everytime they see you.
 These days the porch serves as a place to put your chair and mount your
 mailbox. Your driveway is EAST from here; your house is back to the
 SOUTH.

 Your front door is closed, which prevents people outside from coming
 in, and vice versa (it's called physics).

 You can also see a mailbox (which is closed) here.

 Living Room
 While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back
 when you were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place
 up. Now that you have all the time in the world, you have no money.
 Even in hard times, you retain your sense of irony. Your ratty couch
 sits along one wall, facing your cheap (and empty) entertainment
 center. The front door of your home is to the NORTH. Your dining room
 lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.

 The front door is open, potentially letting in heat, flies, and bill
 collectors.

 You can also see a couch, an entertainment center and a coffee table

 Dining Room
 The word "room" is a bit of a misnomer; it's more of a nook, and a

 your house key. Your kitchen is to the SOUTH, and the living room is to

 Bedroom
 This is where "the magic" happens ... if, by "magic", you mean crying
 yourself to sleep at night while listening to your stomach growl. To
 make ends meet a few months ago you pawned your bed frame, but kept the
 mattress. (You would have pawned the mattress too, but "apparently" it
 had one stain too many.) In the corner is your closet. Your small
 bathroom is to the EAST. Your living room is back NORTH.

 You can see a mattress here.

>sleep
 You close your eyes and, with a smile on your face for the first time
 in weeks, you drift off to sleep.

 It's morning, you think. Confused, you look around and realize you must
 be at Hangar 22. While trying to remember how you got here, you hear a
 familiar voice.

 "Hi Honey," the voice says. You turn around to see Gloria from Taco
 Flaco standing behind you. Honey? What in the world is going on here?

 "I'm so glad you're home," she says. Home? As Gloria leans over to give
 you a kiss on the cheek, her moustache tickles your face. As you pull
 back you realize Gloria has become your mother -- well, her face has
 anyway. Recoiling, you see your mother now has the body of a
 chimpanzee. "Get back here!" you shout as your monkey mother begins
 climbing up some medical equipment. Just when you realize your mom is
 about to begin flinging poo at you, an alarm sounds! Wait, that sounds
 like ...

 ... your alarm clock. You sit straight up in bed, turning off your
 alarm with one hand and checking your chest for any signs of monkey poo
 with the other. Jesus Christ, just what kind of meat has Taco Flaco
 been serving lately?

 Compared to your dream, the rest of your morning is surprisingly
 normal. Although you haven't done it in months, you fumble through your
 old morning routine of cleaning, grooming and dressing yourself. You
 look great, and you feel great.

 Scooping up all the items you collected during yesterday's adventure
 (you never know what could come in handy on the first day of a new
 job!), you head outside. You feel like a new man. It's time to get to
 work!

>examine me
 You look roughly like an out of work computer programmer ... which,
 coincidentally, is exactly what you are. Your clothes are baggier than
 normal, thanks to your mandatory recent "low-food-intake" diet. Years
 of sitting behind computer keyboards have given you lean fingers and a
 pot belly, but when push comes to shove, you clean up nice.

 "LET'S GO, 'CUZ THE POSSE'S ON BROADWAY," says Sir Guide-A-Lot. You
 suspect Sir Guide-A-Lot secretly enjoys leading you around in circles,
 which would be funnier if the Brown Bomber didn't get such terrible gas
 mileage.

 You pull up to what you assume is Hangar 22. Funny, you've been on this
 street before but never noticed this building. Maybe you just weren't
 looking for it.

 Guard Shack
 You are sitting in your El Camino facing east, but a large metal
 cross-bar prevents you from continuing in that direction. Directly
 outside your driver side window is a guard shack. The shack sits on a
 small patch of grass which is mostly immaculate, save for a small pile
 of litter.

 You can see a guard here.

  2: "Yes. I'm selling Girl Scout cookies."

 What do you want to say to the guard?

 "I sure do. I work here now," you say to the guard.

 The guard looks down at his clipboard.

 "Sorry," the guard says. Nobody notified me about any new hires today.
 I'll have to radio HQ and see what's going on. Make yourself
 comfortable, this could take hours."

 You hear an odd rumble from the El Camino's engine. Wait, that wasn't
 your engine. It was the guard's stomach.

>examine litter
 You recognize the pile of trash as discarded Taco Flaco wrappers.

>give burrito to guard

 "Mmm, Mmm, MMM!" says the guard as he sinks his teeth into the moldy
 burrito. "Is this the new minty burrito?" the guard asks, in reference
 to the burrito's greenish hue. It's true what they say: the way to a
 security guard's heart is his big fat stomach. "Listen man," the guard
 says with mold on his teeth, "this paperwork stuff can take forever, so
 I'm going to go ahead and buzz you in -- on your way home, stop by here
 and I'll have a permanent badge waiting for you. You can get a
 temporary badge from Mr. Mordant. First door on your left as you walk
 in."

 The guard presses a button and the giant bar blocking your path begins
 to lift. You pull forward and park in the first available spot.

 "Thanks again for the grub," says the guard as you pass by.

 Parking Lot
 You are standing in the parking lot of Hangar 22. Multiple cars,
 including yours, are parked here. Several security cameras sit high
 above the parking lot, pointed at your face. A tall, black fence runs
 along the NORTH and SOUTH ends of the parking lot. The guard shack lies
 behind you to the WEST. To your EAST is a giant hangar. The side of the
 hangar facing you has no windows and a single red door.

 You can see some cameras, some cars and an El Camino here.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine cameras
 Some of the cameras are out in the open. Others are partially
 concealed. You suspect there are even more, well-hidden ones. All of
 the you can see are pointed directly at you.

>examine cars
 The cars belong to other employees. You feel guilty peering into them
 with so many security cameras pointed at you.

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>examine red door
 The door is off to the EAST. Painted on the door, faded but still
 readable, are the numbers "22". You're pretty sure that's the door the
 guard was referring to.

>knock on door
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>open door
 That's not something you can open.

>go east
 As you approach the red door, you hear a buzzing sound. You open the
 door and enter Hangar 22.

 Hallway
 You are standing at the west end of a long hallway.  The walls,
 ceiling, and other doors are all various shades of gray. Immediately to
 your WEST is the red door you entered through. The door to your NORTH
 has a small plaque that reads "IN PROCESSING". The door to your SOUTH
 has a small plaque that reads "INTERROGATION". The hallway continues
 EAST from here. You can see more doors in that direction.

>SAVE

>go north
 As you reach down toward the handle, the door flies open and you find
 yourself standing face to face with the same creepy guy that came to
 your house yesterday. Recognizing you, the man makes a facial
 expression resembling a smile.

 "Oh! Hello there," the man says. "Welcome to Hangar 22!" The man
 glances at your shirt and, realizing you aren't wearing an access
 badge, reaches into his pocket and pulls out a "New Employee" sticker.
 While mumbling something about the guards at the guard gate, he applies
 the sticker to your shirt and says, "That'll do for now."

 From the INTERROGATION ROOM, you can hear loud shouting. "If you'll
 excuse me I've ... had something come up," he says, his black eyes
 shifting to the door behind you. "I'll be back as soon as I can."

 With that, the man pushes past you and slips into the INTERROGATION
 ROOM, leaving the door to the IN PROCESSING ajar.

>go north

 In Processing
 This is the "In Processing" room, a place where (you assume) new
 employees are processed. A military-grade metal desk sits on one side
 of the room. The desk is covered with papers and various odds and ends.
 Multiple maps adorn the walls. Directly behind the desk hangs a large
 portrait.

 You can see a desk here.

>examine desk
 The desk is solid metal and weighs a ton. Scattered papers cover the
 top of the desk. The backside of the desk contains multiple drawers.

>examine papers
 It would take you months to read all of them. Quickly skimming through
 the piles, you notice most of them appear to be official government
 documents. The piece of paper on top contains an interesting
 handwritten note. "TO DO," the note reads. "01: Meet Glitzenbork for
 sushi after work. 02: Pick up dry cleaning. 03: Get new "recruits" to
 the organ-harvesting chamber, stat."

 Well well well, sounds like something fishy's going on around here. Or
 maybe that's just the sushi.

 Pilfering papers from your eerie new employer is probably not the best
 way to make a good impression on your first day of work.

>look under desk

>examine drawers
 All but one of the desk's drawers are locked.

>open drawer
 In the unlocked desk drawer you spot a keycard.

>examine portrait
 The painting hanging directly behind the desk has three men in it. The
 man on the left is the creepy creepazoid you just ran into. In fellow
 in the middle is a rough-looking military man (the flat top gives it
 away). The "thing" on the right appears to have the head of a giant
 fly, and giant, hairy arms with pinchers for hands. The fly-man's right
 pincher is up behind the military man's head, making bunny ears.
 Whoever painted the portrait obviously had a good sense of humor.
 Must've been an expensive gag gift.

 Astronaut Lounge
 The Astronaut Lounge resembles a cafeteria from the 1950s. The floor is

 Along one wall sits a vending machine and a refrigerator, and a
 television sits in the corner. Scattered around the room are tables and
 chairs of various shapes, sizes and colors. An astronaut sits at one of
 the tables.

 You can see a vending machine, a refrigerator (which is closed), an
 astronaut, some tables (on which is a pair of gloves) and a television
 here.

>examine vending machine
 The vending machine is stocked with various flavors of freeze-dried
 Astronaut Ice Cream. It's also filled with cobwebs, and doesn't appear

>open refrigerator
 Inside the fridge you discover dozens of bottles of Tang.

>take tang
 While stealing other people's drinks out of the fridge on your first
 day or work may seem like a good idea in that messed up head of yours,
 due to the fact that there's an astronaut sitting three feet away from
 you AND there's a sign on the fridge clearly asking you not to steal
 other people's drinks, you decide against it.

>examine refrigerator
 The refrigerator is old school and industrial strength. If you ever
 find yourself next to an atomic bomb that's about to go off, this is
 the refrigerator you want to take shelter in. There is a handwritten
 note taped to the front of the fridge.

>read note

 True to its name, the Observation Room has a long window that allows

 You can see a window, a table and a chair here.

>examine window
 The one-way window allows people in the Observation Room to see what's
 happening in the Interrogation Room, but not vice versa. (Thus,
 "one-way".) Through the window, you can see clearly see two people
 interrogating a third. One of the interrogators is "The Creep". The
 other is a solidly-built military man.

 The third man, you quickly realize, is not a man at all. He looks more
 like a cross between an octopus and supreme pizza.

>examine third man
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine creep
 The Man in Black in leaning up against the door. At first it looks like
 he's trying to keep something out, although you quickly realize he's
 probably trying to keep the giant octopus pizza in.

 The military man has a crew cut and muscles on his muscles. Veins bulge
 from his neck as he shakes his fist in the face of the giant octopus
 pizza. At least you think that's its face.

>examine pizza
 The giant Octopus Pizza is waving its tentacles around in a threatening
 manner, leaving slimy hints of itself all over the walls. The giant
 Octopus Pizza makes a loud, horrible sound, like a cross between a

 You are standing in a hallway. The walls, ceiling, and doors are all
 various shades of gray. To your NORTH is a door marked "ASTRONAUT
 LOUNGE". To your SOUTH is a door marked "OBSERVATION". The hallway
 leads both EAST and WEST, where you can see more doors.

>go west

 Hallway
 You are standing at the west end of a long hallway.  All the walls,
 ceiling, and other doors have been painted a drab shade of gray, save
 for the red door you entered through, which is directly to your WEST.
 The door to your NORTH, which is now open, has a small plaque that
 reads "IN PROCESSING". The door to your SOUTH has a small plaque that
 reads "INTERROGATION". The hallway continues EAST from here. You can
 see more doors in that direction.

 "DRESSING ROOM". A small sign on the door to your SOUTH reads "TOP
 SECRET". The hallway leads both EAST and WEST. To the EAST, the hallway
 gets very dark, very quickly. On the wall hangs what appears to be an
 alarm system, complete with a blinking red light and some text
 displayed on a small screen.

 You can see an alarm system here.

>examine alarm system
 Using the internationally recognized language of a red flashing light,
 the alarm indicates to you that you should probably not walk past it.
 Any possible misunderstanding of the flashing red light is confirmed by
 text on a small LCD screen that reads, "ALARM is currently ARMED".

>use remote
 The remote doesn't appear to affect anything ... here.

 Dressing Room
 You are standing in the dressing room, a room where (and again, you're
 assuming) people dress and undress. Overall, the room is pretty drab. A
 metal locker leans against the wall. A few benches line the floor.

 You can see some benches and a metal locker (which is closed) here.

>examine benches
 There are several benches here in the dressing room. There's no real
 mystery to them; people sit on them while dressing.

>open locker
 You open the metal locker, revealing a spacesuit, a t-shirt, a costume
 and some overalls.

>examine costume
 The costume looks similar to the astronaut spacesuit, except it has
 four arm sleeves. Man, Christmas parties around his place must be a
 hoot, what with all the funny costumes such as this one!

>examine spacesuit
 The spacesuit looks just like the ones astronauts wear, based on your
 knowledge of such things, most of which came from movies and
 cartoons.It's white and fluffy, like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, and
 approximately your size. (The spacesuit, not the Stay-Puft Marshmallow
 Man!) There's a name tag sewn to the front: "Rodzinski".

>examine shirt
 It's a white t-shirt with printing on the front that reads, "I came all
 the way from Mzzrxklpletic-405 and all I got was this stupid t-shirt."
 The shirt's tag states it is a 50/50 blend of cotton and
 blrbyxipunkonium.

>examine overalls
 The overalls are covered in dry blood, and appear to have been made for
 someone about eight-foot-three. Strange things are afoot at the local
 Hangar 22.

>wear spacesuit
 (first taking the spacesuit)
 You put on the spacesuit.

>wear gloves
 You know, while wearing the gloves, spacesuit, and fish bowl, you could
 pass for an astronaut ...You put on the pair of gloves.

>wear costume
 Unless you've grown a couple of arms since you left the house this
 morning, I don't think it'll fit

>wear overalls
 You would need to spend four-to-six weeks being stretched on a
 torturous medieval device to be tall enough to wear these overalls. And
 even if you did, they'd still be covered in someone else's dried blood.

 You know, the more I think about it, the fact that you would even WANT
 to wear someone else's blood-covered overalls raises some flags.
 Assuming you don't get killed on your first day of work, you might want
 to see if your new job benefits include a psychological evaluation.

 Really? Giant bloody overalls?

 Hangar 22
 You are standing in the entrance to a large hangar. The room is so
 large and the lights are so dim that your eyes have a difficult time
 adjusting. Next to the door is a small table.

 Just past the table is a cage. Off in the distance, you can make out
 the shape of a UFO.

 You can see a cage (which is closed) (in which is an alien) and a table
 (on which is a flower pot) here.

>examine table
 It's too dark to make out too many details, but from what you can tell
 it looks like all the other tables you've seen thus far.

>examine cage
 The cage resembles a jail cell. The bars glow blue, and appear to be
 electrified. A lock prevents the cage door from opening.

>examine alien
 The alien looks like every alien you've ever seen on television. He's
 short and gray, with big black eyes and a bigger head.

 The alien looks quite sad. Apparently it's no fun, being an illegal
 alie...un.

>examine pot
 In an attempt to freshen up the place, someone brought a flower pot
 with a few flowers in it. Unfortunately, no one has watered the flowers
 in quite some time. They appear sad and wilted like your grandpa.

>take pot
 Taken.

>examine ufo
 It's tough to make out the details in the low light, but you can
 clearly discern the outline of a classic saucer-shaped UFO. A framework
 has been constructed around the UFO. Several workers appear to be
 looking at and/or working on the craft.

 "Sup," says the alien, in a sullen voice. "I'm Arfefidedmlioonl, but
 everybody calls me Arf. I'd shake your hand, but ...". Arf motions
 toward the electrified cage. "I hope you're here to rescue me, because
 they're going to kill both of us.

  1: "What do you mean, kill both of us?"
  2: "Kill us? That's nonsense!"

 What do you want to say to the alien?

 "Despite the fact that I zoomed through space, time, and multiple
 dimensions to get to this planet, apparently my species, most
 unfortunately, tastes like sushi. I don't know what your story is yet,
 but based on the fact that you're wearing a fishbowl for a helmet, I'll
 bet it's a good one."

 You are carrying:

   a new employee sticker
   a business card
   a bag of Reese's Pieces
   a candy bar
   a coffee mug
   a pen
   a fish bowl (being worn)
   a remote control

>give reese's pieces to alien
 You toss the candy into the cage. The alien lets out a small sigh. "I
 don't want to sound ungrateful but ... eh, you know, it's a little
 racist. I mean, if I looked like a leprechaun would you have me dance a
 little jig? No, I mean ... you know, I get it and all, and thanks, but
 ... man, if it's all the same to you, I'd love some real food. Actually
 every time I come to this planet, I usually have tacos.

>use remote
 My goodness, is there anything this remote won't do? With the push of a
 button, the cage door suddenly springs open. The small alien leaps out
 of the cage and lands directly in front of you. "I'm free!" he shouts
 loudly, attracting the attention of the workers off in the distance. Uh
 oh. It's time to get out of here, and fast!


 Arf is dragging you by the arm. "Let's go!" he cries.

 "Hey!" yells one of the workers. "Arfefidedmlioonl is out of his cage
 ... and that guy's wearing a fishbowl! Let's get 'em!" The crew of
 workers quickly transforms into an angry mob. The workers are about 30
 feet away from you, and running toward you.

 What part about running did you not understand??

 I'm not really sure what you expected to happen. As the crowd reaches
 you, several members of the mob shove you the ground. Looking up you
 see a bearded man, about your size, with a giant wrench raised above
 his head. The man squints his eyes together and, noticing the nametag
 on your spacesuit, asks, "Why exactly are you wearing my suit?"

 "This cannot possibly end well," you think to yourself. The giant
 wrench in Rodzinski's hand agrees.

 reads "IN PROCESSING". The door to your SOUTH has a small plaque that

 Arf is freaking out. "Let's get out of here!"

 The mob is gaining on you!

>go west
 Still running at full speed, you plow into door at the end of the
 hallway. "There!" you shout, pointing at your El Camino in the parking
 lot.

 "You came here in that thing?" asks Arf, running along side you.
 "You're braver than I thought!"

 As the two of you jump into your trusty ride the mob begins to pour out
 of the building, waving wrenches and hammers and pitchforks in the air.
 As your brain pauses for a moment to wonder why astronauts and
 government officials would have pitchforks at their disposal, Arf takes
 over. The El Camino's engine roars to life, and its tires squeal as the
 car spins around in a 180 before lurching toward the guard shack and
 row of tire spikes.

 "I got this," says Arf, and with that the El Camino begins to lift up
 off the ground, sailing up and over the row of tire-shredding spike
 strips. (It should be noted that on any other day, there would have
 been an armed security guard standing inside the guard shack ready to
 shoot you. On this particular day however, that guard is sitting in a
 Porta-Potty one hundred yards away, wondering why on earth he decided
 to accept and eat a moldy burrito from a complete stranger.)

 As the car continues to rise, you notice the crowd doesn't look so
 menacing from up here. "We made it," you say to yourself. "We made it!"

 "Yep, we made it," confirms Arf. After a brief, uncomfortable moment of
 silence, you notice Arf looking at you. "And now, it's time to eat," he
 says, salivating ...

 "Know any good taco stands?" he asks.

 A few moments later the El Camino touches down in the Taco Flaco
 drive-thru. "This place has the best tacos in town," you say. The staff
 of Taco Flaco begins gathering at the window, looking out at the two of
 you.

 "Ah jeez man, let's go," says Arf. You assure him that it's cool and
 that these are good people, but Arf continues to slump down in his
 seat. It is then that you hear a voice, an angelic voice you've known
 for years.

 "Arfie? Arfie, is that you in there?" says Gloria from the drive-thru
 window. "Oh Arfie! I just KNEW you would come back!" Gloria climbs out
 the drive-thru window, pregnant as ever, with a suitcase in her hand.
 "I TOLD you," she shouts back at the workers still standing in the
 drive-thru window. "I TOLD you my baby daddy would come back!"

 "Wait ..." you say. "You ... and HER?" you ask Arf in disbelief.

 "What can I say," he says, shrugging his shoulders. "Chicks love a dude
 with a UFO."

 "Oh, Arfie baby" says Gloria as she climbs into the passenger seat,
 forcing Arf to scoot closer to you. "Heeeeey, Glo-bean," he says,
 faking a little gray smile. Gloria begins kissing Arf on the cheek.
 "Didja miss me? Didja? Didja? Oh, it's so good to see you! Finally, we
 can settle down! Just me, you, Arfie junior, and ... wait, how do you
 know the stupid coupon guy?" she says, looking at you. "And why is he
 wearing a goldfish bowl on his head?"

 "It's a long story," says Arf as the front end of the El Camino begins
 to lift up off the ground. "Say, is that a Sir Guide-A-Lot 350 GPS? I
 have one just like it in my ship! Sir Guide-A-Lot?" says Arf.

 "Yo, yo, yo," says Sir Guide-A-Lot 350.

 "Take us to Mzzrxklpletic-405, please."

 "Aw yeah, BABY GOT BACK!" responds Sir Guide-A-Lot.

 You hand Arf the "World's Greatest Dad" mug. "I think this belongs to
 you, bro," you say.

 And with that, the El Camino, with you behind the wheel, Gloria using
 your rear view mirror to put on lipstick, and Arf uncomfortably
 smooshed between the two of you, takes off like a rocket into the sky.
 Next Stop: Mzzrxklpletic-405 ...

 Scary House Amulet! - THE MOVIE
 Hugo v3.1 / Library 31031

 Stranded
   Who would have thought that your car would break down on such a
 bleary night? To the south lies the country road on which your car has
 given up the ghost. Across the frozen lake to the north, you can see
 lights that contain the promise of help.

   Hopefully, the worst of it is over. The defeated frozen lake lies to
 the south. A farmhouse lies to the north.

 Farmhouse
   Strangely enough, this farmhouse seems abandoned. An exit north leads
 to a yard.
   The butcher knife is here.

>examine knife
 The butcher knife looks just like you would expect.

>take knife
 A hidden spider previously unnoticed RANDOMly jumps out and bites you!
 You are now poisoned! It scurries off, never to be seen again. You grab
 the knife.

 You writhe around in pain, waiting to die.

>go north

 Yard
   This is a yard. To the northwest lies a SCARY BARN.

 You writhe around in pain, waiting to die.

>go northwest

 Scary Barn
   This barn is as many barns are, a big room full of a lot of hay.
   Taking a cat nap next to the remains of his latest victim is an evil
 killer!
 Eventually, you decide that the spider was probably not poisonous after
 all. Whew!

 cage match for your affection. In one corner, there's the tv that holds
 all of the movies and shows you love. In another corner (well,
 actually, the middle of the room), there's the couch upon which you
 like to sprawl.

   The kitchen is to the west. The patio is to the east.

 Your phone starts ringing.

>go west
 You aren't hungry for anything else, and dishes can wait until
 tomorrow.

 Your phone is ringing. Maybe you should answer it?

>answer phone
 You answer the phone. You are greeted by the same ominous voice.

 "You know, it is rude to hang up on people like that! Just the same,
 I've got a surprise for you. Turn on your patio lights!" the voice
 commands.

 The line goes dead.

>turn on patio lights
 With great trepidation, your shaky finger reaches for the patio light
 switch. Your curiosity eventually overcomes your fear, and the
 intensity of the situation is punctuated by the switch's "CLICK."

 The patio is flooded with light, and with horror, you see that somebody
 has set up your garden chairs in several rows holding giant letter
 signs that, altogether, read, "HAPPY ECTOCOMP!" What kind of madman
 would do that?

 Oh, well, the important thing is-

 *** A WINNER IS YOU! ***

 The game has ended.  Do you want to (R)ESTART, R(E)STORE a saved game,
 (S)pecial notes, or (Q)UIT?
>go south

 What was the point of the second game? I won on my first try!
 The middle game was the author's somewhat feeble attempt to try to get
 the player to UNDO or SAVE (at a couple parts). If one does that, the
 game becomes unwinnable (usually).

 How do I start over?
 Delete the "ecto" file from your interpreter's working directory. In
 Hugor, this should be the same directory as your gamefiles. With the
 official interpreter, this can be in different places, depending on
 your OS (In Windows 7, it shows up in
 C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Hugo)

 I hope you enjoyed the game!

 Enter (R)ESTART, R(E)STORE, or (Q)UIT:
