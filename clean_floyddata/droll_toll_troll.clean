 Motion disturbs the water.  Something falls from above, sinking down a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Depths</span>
 Only sporadic shafts of sunlight penetrate to these lonesome depths.
 Long weeds rise from the sand to drift and tangle in the current.

 A dead human has come to rest among the weeds.

 A massive box lies on the sandy floor.  Several layers of rope wind
 about the box, binding it closed.

>examine me


 You are scaled and finned, well suited to your environment.  And
 hungry, as almost always.

 Muffled vibrations come from within the massive box.

>examine box


 It's more than three times your length, with similar proportions in
 width and depth.

 Muffled vibrations come from within the massive box.

>bite rope


 Your powerful teeth slice neatly through the layers of rope, and the
 remanents fall easily away.

 A sharp vibration comes from the massive box, followed by a roiling
 mass of bubbles.  The bubbles send you spinning away, but you are
 nonetheless aware that a second human has emerged from the box.

 The new human is still alive.  Thrashing awkwardly, it propels itself
 up toward the sunlight.

>bite human


 You sink your teeth into the human's meaty limb, severing hunk after
 tasty hunk with joyous abandon.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">In his final moments, there was nothing but rage, red and angry.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">He drew back his fist, snarling a threat that even he barely heard.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">The commander went pale beneath her rouge.  He was certain that he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">would never strike her, but wondered (beneath that certainty) whether</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">he really might this time - he could not remember being so angry</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">before, so desperately, burningly angry.  The lips skinned back from</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">his teeth in a snarl and</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">SMASH! across the back of his head.  He never even saw where the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">blow came from.  There wasn't even pain, not really - just impact, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the ending of a life.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the
 currents.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Depths</span>
 Only sporadic shafts of sunlight penetrate to these lonesome depths.
 Long weeds rise from the sand to drift and tangle in the current.

 A partially eaten human has come to rest among the weeds.

 A massive box lies on the sandy floor.  Its lid gapes open to reveal
 the empty interior.

>bite new human


 You can't see any such thing.

>go up


 You're not done here yet.

>eat human


 You push past the human's weak coverings to make a first foray on the
 soft, tasty innards.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">He thought, if he could trust anyone, he could trust Roselle -</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">until he looked to the bottom of his glass and saw the residue, the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">rust-red powder inflaming the wine.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">When he stood, the deck reeled under him, and he couldn't tell any</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">more whether it was inside or outside his head.  His skin felt</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">flushed, his head ached, the room spun.  What had she dosed him with?</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">What would it do to him?</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">And yet he struggled for control.  She had forfeited her share of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the profit, that was for certain, and her right to move freely about</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the cabin.  But perhaps things could be remedied, somehow - if he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">could </span>think<span class="floydstyle em"> through the gathering haze - </span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the
 currents.

>eat human


 You burrow deeper, wriggling with delight as you gulp down mouthful
 after mouthful.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Over?" he echoed.  "What do you mean?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I mean what I said - " Gene looked sweaty, round, uncomfortable,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">not at all like a man who had just played him for the better part of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">twenty-three million.  "I need someone on board who listens.  Someone</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">who's got his shit together.  Someone who won't touch the cookie</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">jar."</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">And by their contract, under these circumstances - the contract he</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">had pushed for himself - Gene could take the company with him, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Jerry was screwed, screwed, screwed.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"What are you going to do, Jerry?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I'm going to kick your ass.  I'm going to wreck your car.  I'm</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">going to take a fucking cruise..." All the fight suddenly went out of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">him.  "I'm going to go home," he said, and he did.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Oddly, on the drive home, he thought: A cruise might not be a bad</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">idea.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the
 currents.

>again


 You turn your attention higher up the body, to the flappy cheeks and
 lips and nose and eyes.  You bite and tear and chew, savoring each
 delectable mouthful.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">"I could kill for a fix," he said, and then he didn't say it but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">he thought it, and days and weeks and months later he stopped thinking</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">it.  One day he realized he didn't know when he last thought it, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">that was the day Gene said, "You know, you really got your shit</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">together in there.  I need someone like that, someone focused,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">organized, under control.  But someone who understands me, too.  I got</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">this idea,"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">and he listened, and his heart said no, no, no until his mouth</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">said yes.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the
 currents.

 You are scaled and finned, well suited to your environment.  And
 hungry, as almost always.

>examine body


 You can't see any such thing.

 You've gnawed most of the meat off the limbs, hollowed the innards out
 completely, and eaten the fatty meat off the face.

>again


 You've gnawed most of the meat off the limbs, hollowed the innards out
 completely, and eaten the fatty meat off the face.

>eat human


 Exerting your powerful jaws, you crack the human's skull and nuzzle
 away at the cavity within.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Somewhere beneath it all, he was always fourteen.  He was always</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">at the top of the stairs in his skeleton costume for Halloween, and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the teachers were always walking past below, with the conversation</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">always drifting up the stairs like an evil spirit.  He was always</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">listening, even though he didn't want to hear.  He was always just</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">learning that they couldn't tell him apart from anyone else in the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">same costume.  That he was just another kid, here one year and gone</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the next.  That he was not special.  He was always just realizing that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">he would never be special.</span>

 The dream fades, and you are once more aware of the depths and the

 You nose your way across the bones one last time, but there's nothing

 (the dead human)
 Having consumed all the flesh off one human, you turn your attention
 to the other.

 You sink your teeth into the human's meaty limb, severing hunk after
 tasty hunk with joyous abandon.  And you dream....

 <span class="floydstyle em">In her final moments, she pounded against the inside of the wooden</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">box, strove against it, screamed against it, using up the air so fast.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">She used it up on purpose.  She knew she was going to die and she</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">cursed her captor's name.  And when she died, it was no surprise at</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">all - just the aching capstone to a useless life.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Betrayal was barely a word she knew.  She was shocked when she</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">walked into the cabin and Jerry rounded on her, screaming, "What have</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you done to me!" She didn't lift a hand to stop the blow, though it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">drove her glasses into her face and knocked her sprawling into the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">dresser.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">His hands were so strong, lifting her up like a child, dropping</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">her down on a rough wooden surface.  The darkness was almost</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">comforting, before awareness registered - and by then he had slammed</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the lid down, and she heard something scraping on the outside of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">box, over and over.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"You can stay there until La Ceiba," he snarled, ignoring her</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">protests.  And then he was gone, and the lid would not open, no matter</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">how she tried.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">They had the same cabin, and they slept in the same bed, but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">chastely, rarely keeping even the same hours.  And Jerry accepted it,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and his simple acceptance made her smile.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">He was in love with something else, of course - something darker</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and fiercer than she could ever be - and she felt sad for that, though</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">relieved that it kept his attentions at bay.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">She thought about that as he laughed above his wineglass, all</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">white teeth and sparkling eyes, and thought about it as she smiled</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">back.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">She didn't want his love.  She wouldn't have minded if she could</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">have it, if she could be capable of stealing it, but she didn't want</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">it.  But could she break his other love?  That might make his life</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">even better.  She didn't have the synthesis equipment with her, but</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">she could at least analyze her options.  Methadone, naltrexone,</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">The fire started after she cut the phone lines, and the house</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">burned to the ground.  Her sister's voice was higher-pitched than she</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">had ever heard it - "My god, Roselle, what were you thinking?</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Whatever were you thinking?"</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">She'd been thinking, it would be so easy to make sure your awful</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">boss never calls you again on a weekend.  She'd been thinking, all it</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">takes is scissors.  She'd been thinking, I have scissors.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">The cargo pants had giant pockets, and the scissors were still in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">her pocket.  If she slipped, they would go straight into her thigh.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">She didn't slip, or even move.  She stood quietly, instead, and</span>

 It's a chilly morning in January. The windows are frosty, and the sun
 has barely risen. Nevertheless, you wake up feeling lively this
 morning. But there's no time to waste diddling around; you have to get
 to work. Your daily ablutions are performed at maximum haste, and now
 ready to leave. The bathroom lies to the west and the front door lies
 to the south and leads to the parking lot.

>examine me

   a Happiness

>examine happiness

 What if you could touch the intangibles? Emotions, traits, maybe even
 ideologies are all given and taken as you wish. You could take away
 someone's depression, but that would mean that you would be burdened
 with it until you gave it away. Maybe something like conservation of
 energy still applies. Depression, joy, and other emotions don't go
 away; they just go to someone else. Maybe laughter is the act of
 passing on happiness and other intangibles. I thought it was an
 interesting thought to play around with. This is probably the extent
 of my writing abilities, and for that, I apologize. Nevertheless,
 here's my first attempt at an original interactive fiction.

 Give and take the intangibles. You can check other people's inventory
 with "NPC's name, inventory". Talking gives different responses based
 on mood (doesn't mean the character actually converses). You can give
 more than one item to an NPC but it's not recommended.

>go south


 (first opening Front Door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parking Lot</span>
 There are cars of many different colors here. The cold breeze
 momentarily halts your march towards the car. Stepping out, you run
 into your neighbor. You've only talked once when you moved into the
 apartment complex. Her name is either Alice or Alicia; no one can know
 for sure other than her and her boyfriend. They usually keep to
 themselves, but sometimes you hear them arguing and screaming through
 the wall. Sometimes you see her running out of her home with tears
 running down her cheeks. Sometimes she wears a turtleneck, even on a
 warm, sunny day.  Her expression today can only be described as sad.
 To the east is the Business Center, where your workplace is and the
 north to get back into your apartment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Business Center</span>
 The business center is a small cul-de-sac, just a few minutes away
 from the central business district. You drove to your work place, only
 to find you were an hour early! Your clock must have been off. Though
 most days you would yawn and nap in the car for an hour, today feels
 different for some reason. Maybe happiness is just a state of mind. To
 the south is Downtown.

 Personally, you hate Downtown. Crowds of people, polluted air, and
 brutal capitalism aren't your cups of tea. What catches your eye on
 this particular day is an angry looking homeless man glaring at a
 fashionable socialite who screams at this man in disgust. To the north
 of here is the Business Center

 "The poor man. I hope he gets some help." Wait, what? Just a second

 Homeless man picks up the Disgust.

 Tonight was an unusually quiet night. Not a single bang on the wall
 or brief stints of indiscernible shouts happened tonight. For the
 first time since you moved in, you slept in relative peace. Tomorrow
 morning, there will be a note on the door. It'll say: "Thank you. -
 Alicia" She's never seen again.


 A loud bang is heard through the walls. But it's not a sound that
 you're familiar with. Gunshot? A second one is heard. The entire
 neighborhood rings 911, but the deed was done: a murder-suicide with
 the gun in your neighbor's hands.


 A pity. A pity and a half. Two pities. The young socialite scratched
 the number on her check. "Thank you very much for your extremely
 generous donation." an old lady says. She walks out feeling she truly
 made a difference in the world.


 As for you? Like any other day, you wrap your emotions in a sheet and
 hide it in your closet. Then you lock it shut for tomorrow. You bide
 your time for the myriads of intangibles to burst out from the
 Pandora's Box in the corner of your bedroom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 It's a chilly morning in January. The windows are frosty, and the sun
 has barely risen. Nevertheless, you wake up feeling lively this
 morning. But there's no time to waste diddling around; you have to get
 to work. Your daily ablutions are performed at maximum haste, and now
 ready to leave. The bathroom lies to the west and the front door lies
 to the south and leads to the parking lot.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 Almost left the wallet in here!  It's not unusual to be in a hurry in
 the morning, but the wallet usually doesn't follow to the bathroom
 either.

 You see your wallet here.

>examine wallet


 A leather wallet your mother gave to you when you were seventeen. It
 holds fond memories, your license, and some change.

>get wallet

 (first opening Front Door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parking Lot</span>
 There are cars of many different colors here. The cold breeze
 momentarily halts your march towards the car. Stepping out, you run
 into your neighbor. You've only talked once when you moved into the
 apartment complex. Her name is either Alice or Alicia; no one can know
 for sure other than her and her boyfriend. They usually keep to
 themselves, but sometimes you hear them arguing and screaming through
 the wall. Sometimes you see her running out of her home with tears
 running down her cheeks. Sometimes she wears a turtleneck, even on a
 warm, sunny day.  Her expression today can only be described as sad.
 To the east is the Business Center, where your workplace is and the
 north to get back into your apartment.

 One last fight before she hits the road. Tears are heard through the
 walls, but today is different. It was his tears. After years of
 physical and emotional abuse, your (former) neighbor leaves for good.
 Disgusted of her old life, she chooses to live free of turtlenecks and
 bruises.


 With a smile to feed his efforts and an idea to fuel success, the
 homeless man writes a memoir of his time on the streets on a public
 library computer. Selling cans to pay for the printing adds the extra
 sympathy points to make his story a best seller. His face is on
 daytime talk shows now.


 As for you? Like any other day, you wrap your emotions in a sheet and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Master's Hut</span>
 Oh, glorious, wondrous, rapturous land!  The beauty is more than you
 can understand.  Master told of sky - master does not lie - but little
 furry servant you, you could not know the wonder true.  But now you
 see, you see in glee and praise master's mercy to let you free - not
 free to leave, silly fuzzy thing, but free to be outside in the wide
 under-sky, on the road from master's abode to who knows.  Master
 knows, and you he told: eastward lies the quim delivery station to
 which (to your elation) you are to move your fleet and furry feet and
 inject, input, insert every quim without qualm, lest master withold
 balm.

 You are outside of master's hut, and, for now, gut.  Above is the wide
 and clear purple sky, north and south out and past ken ruffle gently
 spears of grass.  The one and single road in all existence begins (not
 ends; it's master's instance) at master's door westward and pursues
 the horizon eastward.

>go east

 First time farthest from master's hut, first time farthest from
 master.  Slowly, first, then faster and faster furry feet patter along
 the quiet road, hands to hold gently the load.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bridge</span>
 What's this?  'Road' wouldn't be a miss, but this rises steeply over a
 river - a bridge, plainly, from hither to thither, with you hither and
 the goal thither.  Between these two places places himself a looming,
 long-limbed lobster - I mean Robster - I mean mobster - I mean momster
 - I mean monster.  On his face is placed a frown twice upside-down,
 and in his eye you espy a flicker that died.  "To pass, cross, or
 otherwise my bridge transverse you must, without loss, provide a
 smidge to me of that - in the whole universe - which is most
 precious."

 The droll toll troll stands in your way and demands his pay.  Under
 the bridge streams a stream.

>go east, like a beast

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine quim

 Quiet quims, buried in burlap.  Do they exist when you cannot see
 them?  Do they not exist?  Do they exist in some sort of superposition
 of existing and not existing?  Similarly, do YOU exist when master
 isn't looking at you?  Alas, if only master would tell you the answer.

>smile

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine me

 Furry, fuzzy, fizzy, fazzy, silly little thing.

>examine bridge

 Rising, rising, up and arched and falling, falling, down and ground,
 streaming water underneath, troll above the neath.

>examine feet

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine troll

 Mountainous monster, limber of limb above and lumbering below -
 meaning waving five arms and walking slow.  In eye and face he knows
 no glow, so there grows a menacing show of teeth in a
 twice-upside-down frown.  His arms wave to alarm the far and harm the
 near.

>talk to troll

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask troll about toll

 "To pass, cross, or otherwise transverse my bridge you must, without
 loss, provide a smidge to me of that which - in the whole universe -
 which is most precious."

>give quim to troll

 Never, never, never in all of ever would these limbs let loose of
 these quims!  Oh, precious quims, little quims, always, always quiet
 little quims, safe in the holding of this furry little thing.

>jump over troll

 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>inventory

 The quims, precious quims, honor to hold, deep in sleep and more
 precious than gold, rest in the bag in your tight-clenched hand, their
 fate at master's command.

>examine quim

 Quiet quims, buried in burlap.  Do they exist when you cannot see
 them?  Do they not exist?  Do they exist in some sort of superposition
 of existing and not existing?  Similarly, do YOU exist when master
 isn't looking at you?  Alas, if only master would tell you the answer.

 ends; it's master's instance) at master's door westward and pursues
 the horizon eastward.

>go west

 Unfinished!  Incomplete!  Undone!  Partway!  Master must not see you
 with the bag of quims!  Master must know the whole project is done
 else there's no fun.  Run, run east with quims, return only when
 delivered, only then.

>what is a quim

 Look, man, I don't know either.  It's just a MacGuffin.

>what is a macguffin

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 In a flurry of fuzzy furry fur you the cover the monster - his leg, at
 least, the most of the beast you could reach, but in your embrace the
 troll's droll face brightened, his eyes enlightened.

 "Ah - ah!  Furry little thing, silly fuzzy little thing, this is
 fitting payment, I only lament I'm so late to relent of the cold dull
 resistance of distance.  For this treasure, please pass at your
 pleasure."

>go east

 You stroll by the toll troll.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quim Delivery Station</span>
 Elation!  The quim delivery station!  A box atop a pole, inside the
 box a hole, facing the westward side at just the height right for
 fuzzy furry little things.  Strange - the range of the road runs
 longer than master told - master didn't say it didn't but master
 didn't say it did, but the road goes ever on, through and among the
 throng red and waving east to meet with the horizon.

>go east

 Master did not say to go along that way; master said - it's in your
 head - deliver quims, return without them.  Return, said master; what
 disaster falls upon the one who rolls along beyond where the end
 belongs?  Master's quims, you could not take them - unless you did,
 but what then?  Road, the road, eastward rolls the road, a stretch
 forever, past the end, with the quims...  A whim, a whim.

>stick the quims in the hole then go home

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>put quims in hole

 In go quims, quims go in, quims in bag and bag in box and little furry
 thing is good furry thing, good and fuzzy and pleasing master.

>examine hole

 From the center of the road rises a rectangular prism of wood, fitted
 on the top a box, as tightly as it could.  In the box, in it's side,
 resides a hole big enough for the whole bag of quims.  In fact, the
 hole who once lacked of quims is now stuffed to the brim with them.

>examine bag

 Quiet quims, buried in burlap.  Do they exist when you cannot see
 them?  Do they not exist?  Do they exist in some sort of superposition
 of existing and not existing?  Similarly, do YOU exist when master
 isn't looking at you?  Alas, if only master would tell you the answer.

>inventory

 Empty hands, empty, fuzzy, tiny little hands.

>enter hole

 That's not something you can enter.

>go west

 Back running to master, faster and faster, over the bridge and down
 the road to the old abode to hold pride in you eye for master to spy
 and offer - perhaps - praise of your worth,


 *** from glorious, gracious, generous, gratuitous,
 gustatory, glutinous, gelatinous, grievous, grim, grotesque, ghastly,
 glamorous master. ***

 can understand.  Master told of sky - master does not lie - but little
 furry servant you, you could not know the wonder true.  But now you
 see, you see in glee and praise master's mercy to let you free - not
 free to leave, silly fuzzy thing, but free to be outside in the wide
 under-sky, on the road from master's abode to who knows.  Master
 knows, and you he told: eastward lies the quim delivery station to
 which (to your elation) you are to move your fleet and furry feet and
 inject, input, insert every quim without qualm, lest master withold
 balm.

 You are outside of master's hut, and, for now, gut.  Above is the wide
 and clear purple sky, north and south out and past ken ruffle gently
 spears of grass.  The one and single road in all existence begins (not
 ends; it's master's instance) at master's door westward and pursues
 the horizon eastward.

>sing

 La la la la la la lu la.

>leap

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>sing

 Na na na na na na na na
>sing

 BATMAN!

>examine grass

 Red, red, red the waves roll forever, with wind through leaves in
 dodges and weaves, oceans of unfathomed depth and unmeasured breadth
 unbroken but by rising stones standing alone.

>examine stones

 The stones that rise from the grass plains of this sunlit land are
 like breaching whales out of the infinite, sunny ocean of grasses.

>take stones

 Too far, too far, silly furry thing, you would be lost, lost, lost.

>examine sky

 No clouds, no green pyramidal clouds today.  A perfect purple day.

>fly

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>search grass

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine road

 White road, right road, onward to success; eastward leading, still
 proceeding - guiding you, you guess (master wasn't clear, and master's
 isn't here - to ask - master said east, and thither the road - at
 least, you think).

>go east

 First time farthest from master's hut, first time farthest from
 master.  Slowly, first, then faster and faster furry feet patter along
 the quiet road, hands to hold gently the load.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bridge</span>
 What's this?  'Road' wouldn't be a miss, but this rises steeply over a
 river - a bridge, plainly, from hither to thither, with you hither and
 the goal thither.  Between these two places places himself a looming,
 long-limbed lobster - I mean Robster - I mean mobster - I mean momster
 - I mean monster.  On his face is placed a frown twice upside-down,
 and in his eye you espy a flicker that died.  "To pass, cross, or
 otherwise my bridge transverse you must, without loss, provide a
 smidge to me of that - in the whole universe - which is most
 precious."

 The droll toll troll stands in your way and demands his pay.  Under
 the bridge streams a stream.

>kiss troll

 In a flurry of fuzzy furry fur you the cover the monster - his leg, at
 least, the most of the beast you could reach, but in your embrace the
 troll's droll face brightened, his eyes enlightened.

 "Ah - ah!  Furry little thing, silly fuzzy little thing, this is
 fitting payment, I only lament I'm so late to relent of the cold dull
 resistance of distance.  For this treasure, please pass at your
 pleasure."

>examine stream

 Bubbling, babbling, burbling brook, winding and weaving with hooks and
 crooks.  From far to the south to far in the north, running and
 streaming, 'round bends, there careening.  Gold-colored water from
 somewhere to elsewhere, free frolicking through the red sea of leaves.

>go south

 No, no, no, not only too little, but too brittle of mind; only the
 road, grass-lined, for your furry little feet.  Too quick to pick the
 wayward way and away your way back home does fly.  Try, try to stay
 straight on the street, straight with furry feet east and east until
 you meet, as master is fair, the whole goal of this affair.

>go east

 You stroll by the toll troll.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quim Delivery Station</span>
 Elation!  The quim delivery station!  A box atop a pole, inside the
 box a hole, facing the westward side at just the height right for
 fuzzy furry little things.  Strange - the range of the road runs
 longer than master told - master didn't say it didn't but master
 didn't say it did, but the road goes ever on, through and among the
 throng red and waving east to meet with the horizon.

>put quim in hole

 In go quims, quims go in, quims in bag and bag in box and little furry
 thing is good furry thing, good and fuzzy and pleasing master.

>go east

 Quims delivered, yet you shiver to wonder to wander away from master.
 To return did master intend - would you with that contend?  The road
 runs down alone, along the sides the rise of red, the plain moves out
 and out, empty, no master, no quims, only wind, wind, wind through
 red...

>go east

 East and on and past all ken, past all memory of kith or quim, through
 the endless plain, master from your mine long waned,


     *** along the road, alone, alone, eternity to roam. ***

 Today is the day, hurrah, hurrah!  Leap for pleasure with unbounded
 measure: kind master, generous master, merciful master piled faster
 and faster graces and glories beyond all fabulous places in stories -
 today you away to a faraway nation, to the land of the quim delivery
 station.

 Quim bag in hand, you bow, then stand, then scurry with feet furry out
 the door.

 Master did not say to go along that way; master said - it's in your

 disaster falls upon the one who rolls along beyond where the end
 belongs?  Master's quims, you could not take them - unless you did,
 but what then?  Road, the road, eastward rolls the road, a stretch
 forever, past the end, with the quims...  A whim, a whim.

 Eastward onward rolling through the plain, ocean's red rising, waving,
 rolling

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Porch</span>
 This is a cozy front porch that looks out onto the dogwood trees.  The
 front walk is to the east and the front door is to the west.

 A rocking chair sits among the scattered leaves that made their way
 onto the porch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 This is a small foyer marking the entrance to the boarding house.  You
 can see a dining room to the north, a living room to the south, and a
 hall stretches to the west where it seems to terminate in a room with
 a lot of windows.  In the downstairs hall is a set of stairs up to the
 second floor.  The place seems to be decorated with original artwork
 and craftwork.

 You can see Andy Reynolds here.

 Andy Reynolds looks around as if wondering what to do with himself.

>ask andy about mountain

 There is no reply.

>talk to andy

 You are already talking to Andy Reynolds.

>topics

 You could ask him about himself, the first incident, the second
 incident, the third incident, the fourth incident, the fifth incident
 or the Carnival.

>about

 <span class="floydstyle em">Dark Carnival</span> is loosely based on a Chaosium Call of Cthulhu
 scenario of the same name by David A. Hargrave.  My carnival
 inspectors were Syman Weed, Geoff "mostly_useless" Moore, Francesco
 "explorington" Tortorici, Jason "harpua" Lautzenheiser, Hanon
 Ondricek, Anthony Casteel, Peter Orme & the illustrious David
 Welbourn.  Type "help" for more!

>ask andy about himself

 "What's your story?" you ask but instead of a reply, Andy Reynolds
 just gives you an irritated look.

>ask andy about third

 "So you were the cop fired for making that report about the event at
 the city dump?"

 "I'm not going to let you sit here and scoff me." he begins to say but
 you set him straight.

 "On the contrary.  I've seen shit that would change your gender.  I'm
 here to find the truth, so tell me what you know." you say.

 He sees you are serious so he tells you what he knows.
   (press SPACE)
 (press SPACE)"I was about a hundred yards into the dump when I got
 this feeling I was being watched.  I saw this person standing there in
 the middle of a pile of smouldering garbage.  I looked closer and saw
 it was a small person, maybe a child, maybe the Pendergast boy is what
 I was thinking at the time.  He even looked at me all scared and I was
 about to approach him to help him out and take him home, but that's
 when it happened.

 "The garbage around him rose up like a wave and swallowed the boy.
 Everything settled and he was gone.  Like an idiot, I reported the
 truth to Chief Walker.  He didn't fire me but the city council did,
 saying I was a drunk.  I'm not a drunk.  I'm just a bitter
 ex-policeman now.  That's my story.  Now get outta my face."

 Andy Reynolds looks at some of the crafts hanging on the walls.

>examine crafts

 You can tell they are homemade as they aren't really that good.
 You're allowed to say so because you took an art class once.

 Andy Reynolds looks around as if wondering what to do with himself.

>ask him about second

 "What about the Pendergast boy?  You know anything about him that
 might help me find him?" you ask.

 "You're going to try to find him?  Good luck.  You know after a few
 days. . ." he says but you interrupt.

 "I'm hoping for once, a missing persons case doesn't end in homicide."
 you tell him.

 "Well," he says, "I really don't know more than the simple fact that,
 against his mom's wishes, he went down to the carnival one evening
 with the Coombs brothers.  Freddie Pendergast got on the <span class="floydstyle em">Tunnel of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Terrors</span> ride and never emerged again.  The ride was searched, of
 course, but no body was found.  Probably abducted." he says with the
 proper cynacism.

>ask him about abduction

 There is no reply.

>ask about coombs

 There is no reply.

>topics

 You could ask him about the first incident, the fourth incident, the
 fifth incident or the Carnival.

>ask about carnival

 "You ever visit that carnival down the road?" you ask Andy Reynolds.

 "Not really." he says.  "I don't like the carny-folk.  Buncha
 scumbags, really.  And that Jonathan Boom, the security guard, thinks
 he's some sort of cop or soldier, but he's really just a disturbed man
 with a gun."

 Andy Reynolds looks at some of the crafts hanging on the walls.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room</span>
 This is a comfortable common area, complete with an old but
 comfortable-looking sofa, an armchair, and a bookcase.  You can see
 the foyer to the north and a narrow door to the west.  Outside the
 windows, you can see the dogwoods in Mother Matheson's yard.  The same
 artwork that is seen throughout the house can be found in here.

>examine artwork

 You can tell they are homemade as they aren't really that good.
 You're allowed to say so because you took an art class once.

>examine books

 How one can collect so many books of such a limited genre baffles you.

 It was either found somewhere or homemade, but it seems sturdy enough.
 It is full of romance paperbacks.

>search bookcase

 You find nothing of interest.

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Downstairs Bathroom</span>
 This is a white, tiled bathroom with the appropriate fixtures (toilet,

 This room has large windows that look out onto a garden of wildflowers
 behind the house.  A door to a bedroom is to the south and a utility
 room door is to the north.  The downstairs hall is to the east.

 An easel sits in this room.

 On the art easel is an unfinished painting.

>examine painting

 It appears to be a painting of an elephant underground, walking among
 stalagmites and stalactites with a crazed look in its eyes.  The

 That's not a verb I understand with the lock pick.

>unlock reynolds's door

 What do you want to unlock Reynolds' door with?

 (up the art easel)
 Yes, it's light and easy to carry, but it would still be a pain in the
 ass to do so, especially as you've no real need for it.

>unlock reynolds's door with pick

 Your lock pick does not fit this particular lock.

 It is nickel-plated and maybe was once fancy but now it is dull and
 weathered.  You found it in New Mexico.  It's a long story.

 The cigar lighter is currently switched off.

>go north

 (first opening the utility door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Utility Room</span>
 This seems to be part mud-room and part laundry-room.  A large basin
 and a small basin sit by one wall.  An door to the outside is to the
 west and the rest of the house can be reached to the south.

 You can see Mother Matheson here.

 Mother Matheson seems to be preparing to do laundry with the basins.

>talk to mother

 You say hello to Mother Matheson.

 Mother Matheson arranges the large and small basins.

 (You could ask her about herself, room key, the first incident, the
 second incident, the third incident, the fourth incident, the fifth
 incident, the unfinished painting or the Carnival.)

>ask about paiting

 There is no reply.

 Mother Matheson seems to be preparing to go outside, but you can't be
 certain.

>ask about painting

 "What's with the painting I saw in the Sun Room?" you ask.

 "Oh, yes," Mother Matheson explains, "I have recurring dreams of
 horrible things moving underground; beneath the carnival.  But those
 are just dreams."

>ask about room key

 You approach the landlady and ask about your room key.

 "Oh yes." she says, "You're the temporary tenant that phoned ahead.
 Your arrangements have been made.  Here's your key.  Your room is on
 the second floor." she tells you.

 Mother Matheson arranges the large and small basins.

>examine large

 This is probably the basin used for rinsing clothes.

 Mother Matheson seems to be preparing to go outside, but you can't be
 certain.

>ask about fifth incident

 "What about this incident that happened just the other night?  Did you
 know Jordan McIntyre?" you ask.

 "I know of the man.  He worked at Butler.  People have no idea what to
 think of the incident.  How could it have been so barbaric and what's
 with all the dried gook all over the scene?  It's just one of those
 things, I guess." she says.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>enter my door

 (first opening your door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Room</span>
 This is a small, simple bedroom furnished with only a bed and a
 bedside table.  A simple door leads to the upstairs balcony to the
 south and the upstairs hall is to the west.

 It's so simple, you wonder if Mother Matheson made it herself.

>go south

 (first opening the balcony door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upstairs Porch</span>
 This is a small, open-air porch that allows you to look down to the
 front walk.  The flowering dogwoods give this space privacy.  The door
 back inside is to the north.

 Forgotten by the last tenant and neglected by Mother Matheson's
 cleaning is a sealed jar of moonshine.

>get moonshine

 You pick up the jar of moonshine from the ground.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upstairs Bathroom</span>
 This is a white, tiled bathroom with the appropriate fixtures (toilet,
 sink, tub).  The pipes are visible up the walls from the fixtures and
 a mirror is set in the wall above the sink.  A wide door is to the
 north.

 You open the mirror.

 Your lock pick does not fit this particular lock.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Downstairs Hall</span>
 This is the nexus of the house with passages in many directions.  The
 same homemade artwork lines the walls and a staircase leads up to the
 second floor.  To the north, you can see the kitchen and to the east,
 the foyer.  A white door is to the south and you can see a sun room
 through a doorway to the west.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This kitchen is truly the heart of the home.  The smells of decades of
 home-cooking permeate from the walls.  A stove, icebox, and pantry are
 the fixtures but there are also a cabinet and a counter.  From here,
 you can head east to the dining room and south to the downstairs hall.

 You can see Arthur Peabody here.

>talk to arthur

 You say hello to Arthur Peabody.

 (You could ask him about himself, the first incident, the second
 incident, the third incident, the fourth incident, the fifth incident
 or the Carnival.)

>ask about third

 "So, you live in the same boarding house as Andy Reynolds, the
 disgraced cop." you say.

 "That's a little harsh, don't you think?" he asks, "But as I say,
 unless I have a dead body to examine, I have no professional opinion
 of the matter."

>ask about self

 There is no reply.

 Arthur looks to the south, into the downstairs hall.

>ask about arthur

 "What's your story, mister?" you ask.

 "Nice to meet you.  I'm Arthur Peabody.  I'm one of the proprietors of
 the undertaking firm Jackson, Goldberg, & Peabody.

>ask about fourth

 "Any thoughts on the town drunk's story of people in the cemetery?"
 you ask.

 "Nope."

 Arthur stares out the window for a moment.

>ask about fifth

 "What about this recent incident?  Jordan McIntyre's death?" you ask.

 "Well, as one of the undertakers here in town, I can tell you there
 was a murder, but there wasn't hardly any body left to undertake.
 Something tore that man in pieces." he says with a shudder.

>ask about carnival

 "You ever visit Swan Point Carnival?" you ask Arthur Peabody.

 "Hardly." is the gentleman's answer, "I am too busy to indulge in such
 trivialities.  Plus, that place hardly looks safe."

>examine counter

 It's just a hard, wooden counter.

 Arthur Peabody goes south.

>examine pantry

 It matches the cabinet.

>examine cabinet

 It matches the pantry.

>examine icebox

 Some have started calling it a "refrigerator" but you don't think the

>open cabinet

 Don't mess with the food.  You're not that hungry and you don't want
 to take other people's stuff.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 This is a homey dining room with mismatched chairs and a wide table.
 You can see the kitchen through a doorway to the west and the foyer is
 to the south.  The same arts-and-crafts artwork decorate the walls.
 Outside the windows, you can see the dogwoods on Mother Matheson's
 lawn.

>examine table

 It is wide enough to seat six comfortably and any number beyond six
 uncomfortably.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 This is a small foyer marking the entrance to the boarding house.  You
 can see a dining room to the north, a living room to the south, and a
 hall stretches to the west where it seems to terminate in a room with
 a lot of windows.  In the downstairs hall is a set of stairs up to the
 second floor.  The place seems to be decorated with original artwork
 and craftwork.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Porch</span>
 This is a cozy front porch that looks out onto the dogwood trees.  The
 front walk is to the east and the front door is to the west.

 A rocking chair sits among the scattered leaves that made their way
 onto the porch.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Walk</span>
 This is the front walk to Mother Matheson's boarding house, where
 you'll be staying.  Her porch is to the west and the main road is to
 the east.  Her lawn is dotted with dogwoods and covered in leaves.

>examine dogwood

 There are a good number of these trees.  Their branches gives a
 shadowy canopy over the house and yard.

>climb dogwood

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>examine canopy

 You can't see any such thing.

>go east

 You make your way down the road to the carnival.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Near Ticket Booth</span>
 Having made your way down the dusty road, you find the carnival.
 Being very late in the season, there aren't many carnival-goers from
 what you can tell so far.  The ticket booth stands sentinel before the
 fairgrounds entrance to the east.  A large, sweat-soaked man stands
 inside the ticket booth, eyeing you expectingly.

 to break the ice.

 The man just stares at you.

 "As the ticket guy here, have you seen any suspicious people lately?"
 you ask.

 "Everyone is suspicious in <span class="floydstyle em">my</span> eyes." he says.

 There is no reply.

 "You just <span class="floydstyle em">buy the carnival ticket</span>." he replies.

 but the ticket transaction still happens.

 The sweaty man coughs without covering his mouth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thoroughfare</span>
 You are at the southern end of the carnival's main thoroughfare.  The
 entrance to the park and its accompanying ticket booth is to the west.
 The security shack sits to the south.  To the east is a small building
 with a sign saying <span class="floydstyle em">Gift Shop</span> on its door.  The thoroughfare
 continues to the north where more booths, buildings, and tents are
 lined up on the east side with the road to town flanking its west
 border.

 A black cat runs by, crossing your path.

 It seems to be locked.

 You clandestinely pick the lock while looking out for anyone who might
 see you.  You feel you did it without being noticed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Security Shack</span>
 This is a one-room affair of clapboard with a pot-belly stove in one
 corner.  By the opposite wall is a desk with accompanying chair.  The
 exit is to the north.

 You can see Jonathan Boom here.

 Seeing you in the security shack, the security guard whips out his
 pistol and trains it on you.

 "What the hell do you think you're doing in here?" he demands, but
 without waiting for an answer, he pistol whips you into
 unconsciousness.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Hallway</span>
 This is a featureless portion of the fun house, designed only to be as
 dark as possible.  The sides are covered in thick black curtains.  You
 can make out passages to the south and west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spinning Room</span>
 Something is wrong with this ridiculous room.  It is small and
 cylindrical shaped and the floor is spinning counter-clockwise
 extremely fast.  You're hard pressed to imagine any children or

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fun House Entrance</span>
 Strangely, this entrance is unattended.  The building itself is made
 of numerous trailers attached to one another.  A facade dresses this
 up to be some sort of wondrous spectacle, but the management has not
 gone out of its way to hide any of the smoke-and-mirrors that support
 their flimsy illusion.  Still, the entrance, to the north, is so dark
 as to be menacing in its own way.  The carnival's main thoroughfare
 can be reached to the south and southeast.

 north-south part of the thoroughfare by heading southwest.  To the
 southeast is a dunk-a-clown booth.

>se


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dunk-a-Clown Booth</span>
 You stand before a dunk-a-clown booth off the main thoroughfare.
 Before you is the edge of the booth where you can talk to the carny to
 buy a chance to throw a ball at a target that would dunk a poor clown
 sitting in a dunk tank.  The clown in question is a crass looking
 character who stares at you with crabby eyes as he chews a wet cigar
 in his mouth.  The carny ignores him, choosing to watch you instead.
 He stands by a large box of stuffed animals.  The main thoroughfare is
 to the north, but you can cut to it by going northeast and northwest
 as well.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Throw the ball!"

>dunk clown

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Just throw the ball, piss-ass!"

 (You could ask him about himself, the incidents or Jonathan Boom.)

>ask about himself

 The carny looks at you but shouts to the clown, "Hey, look, Randy,
 it's some retarded chump!"

 From his platform above the dunk tank, Randy the Clown shouts back,
 "Give 'em a try for free!"

 The carny throws a red ball at you which you catch.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Bend over and I'll show ya a pizza
 party!"

>examine ball

 It's like a skinned baseball.

 You hear the sound of laughter from somewhere, but it is a mirthless,
 chilling sound.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Do it, lady!"

 You are a private eye; a gumshoe, as they say, and you appear as such.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Do it, lady!  Throw the ball!"

>ask about incidents

 "What do you think about the recent incidents involving the murders
 and disappearances?" you ask.

 "Shit's bad all over, man." is all you can get out of the carny.

 You see a balloon float off in the distance.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Throw the ball!"

 "Isn't Boom squirrely enough to be a suspect?" you mention.

 "Aren't you?" you asks in return.

 "Actually, no." you say.

 "Oh.  Well, I'm not one to say.  I barely know the guy."

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "This guy ain't no pitcher!  He's more
 like. . .diarrhea!  Yeah!"

>throw ball

 Dropped.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "You couldn't even throw a fit!"

>throw ball at clown

 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

 A black cat runs by, crossing your path.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "This shit sucks!"

>examine clown

 A true monster, you can tell as you can smell the whisky from all the
 way over here.  His rheumy eyes stare you down.  He must've terrified
 children and so has been relegated here, to the dunking booth.

 You hear the sound of a child crying; echoing from somewhere nearby.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Bend over and I'll show ya a pizza

>throw ball at target

 You wind up and pitch the ball.  It hits the target square in the
 center and Randy the Clown is dunked with a splash.  You hear him thud
 on the bottom of the tank as there wasn't enough water to cushion his
 fall.  With a crappy look on his face, he rights the platform, returns
 the wet cigar to his mouth, and sits again.  The carny throws a
 stuffed pig at you.

 Newspapers blow by like so much forgotten trash.

 Randy the Clown shouts at you, "Pussy!"

 "Aww," you tease, "Are you a sad clown?" noting the tears painted on

 ferris wheel, among other attractions.  To the immediate north is a
 Parisian theater, where silent films are shown, no doubt.  To the
 southwest is a dunk-a-clown booth.

 dark interior are made to resemble coffins.  These cars come out of
 the facade on one side and re-enters it on the other after loading and
 unloading the passengers.  A surly attendant watches over the
 operation.

 Filmore the Clown arrives from the south.

 Filmore the Clown goes south.

 you ask, trying to sound casual.

 "He likes this ride!" is the carny's response.

 "Hop in there, young feller, and I'll show ya how safe it is!" he

 With the grinding of gears and the hiss of machinery, the ride car
 begins being pulled on the track and into the dark tunnel within the

 It's not long when you realize something is wrong.  The track below
 you makes a loud snapping noise and it suddenly dips downward into a
 secret cavity.  The ride car, with you in it, plummets into darkness
 as the passage closes above you again.

 You hang on for dear life as the cart crashes downward and finally,
 you are dumped into mud, somewhere deep underground.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Distorted Room</span>
 This is a fairly standard fun house room.  It tricks the eye of a
 person on one side of the room to think that the people on the other
 side are giants.  It all has to do with where you stand as well has
 how lines are painted in the room.  To you, it's quite mundane and the
 room seems to have nothing else to offer.  Passages go north and west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shaky Steps</span>
 This room has a sunken floor and there are a small set of steps that
 lead down to it from both the eastern and southern exits.  Unseen
 machinery in the walls make all of these steps shake back and forth.
 This foolishness would normally just cause one to lose balance and
 giggle, but the machinery is pumping so noisily and furiously that the
 shaking is extreme, to say the least.

 their arms stretch out akimbo, reaching for passers-by.  Passages lead

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fun House Entrance</span>
 Strangely, this entrance is unattended.  The building itself is made
 of numerous trailers attached to one another.  A facade dresses this
 up to be some sort of wondrous spectacle, but the management has not
 gone out of its way to hide any of the smoke-and-mirrors that support
 their flimsy illusion.  Still, the entrance, to the north, is so dark
 as to be menacing in its own way.  The carnival's main thoroughfare
 can be reached to the south and southeast.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thoroughfare</span>
 This is the northern end of the carnival's main thoroughfare where it
 turns to the east.  To the south, the thoroughfare stretches with the
 road flanking its western side and a line of tents, buildings, and
 booths lining the east side.  To the east, the thoroughfare continues
 deeper into the carnival grounds.  To the southeast is a baseball toss
 booth and to your north is the funhouse, standing ominous and decaying
 in the autumn sun.

 You hear the distant sound of a carnival barker.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thoroughfare</span>
 You are on the east-west path of the carnival's main thoroughfare.  To

 You can see Wilberforce Wyatt here.

 Janice Parker arrives from the north.

>talk to janice

 You say hello to Janice Parker.

 (You could ask her about the incidents.)

>ask about incidents

 "Have you seen anything untoward in this place?  Any people I should
 ask about the murders and disappearances?" you inquire.

 She seems to brighten at your question.  "Yes!" she says, "I've been
 keeping records on the carnival and these murders and disappearances
 aren't isolated to this season.  People have been going missing for
 years here, it's just that lately, it's gotten worse.  If you stopped
 by the library sometime, I can show you the records." she tells you
 this but she's already told you all you need to know.  You thank her
 for her time.

 Wilberforce Wyatt takes off his cowboy hat, dusts it briefly, then
 returns it to his head.

>examine janice

 Miss Parker is the town's young librarian and looks the part.

 Janice Parker goes west.

 Wilberforce Wyatt seems to survey the area.

>examine wyatt

 This dark, handsome man in his late 40's is the owner and manager of
 the carnival.  You can tell this by the way he carries himself and
 gives orders to any carnies within earshot.  He is impeccably dressed
 as a stage cowboy and is the wealthiest-appearing man in the carnival.

 Wilberforce Wyatt takes off his cowboy hat, dusts it briefly, then
 returns it to his head.

>talk to wyatt

 You say hello to Wilberforce Wyatt.

 Wilberforce Wyatt quietly watches the few carnival-goers that walk by.

 (You could ask him about himself, the incidents or Jonathan Boom.)

>ask about himself

 "You look like some sort of carnival cowboy." you say but you
 immediately notice that you've offended this man.  Still, he
 <span class="floydstyle em">is</span> dressed to the nines in a shiny, white, expensive-looking
 cowboy outfit.

 "No, sir, I am Wilberforce Wyatt, the owner and manager of this fine
 carnival.  Now, if you'll excuse me, sir, I have much better things to
 do."

>ask about incidents

 "Anything you can tell me about the recent incidents?  The murders and
 disappearances?" you ask.

 "Just some bad luck and misadventure, unfortunately.  Nothing for you
 to worry about." he says with a smile, "Please enjoy your stay in my
 park."

 Something moves in the corner of your eye, but when you turn to look,
 nothing is there.

 Wilberforce Wyatt smooths his mustache.

>ask about boom

 "Tell me about Jonathan Boom, Mr. Wyatt." you ask.

 "He's an asset to the park, sir.  He's been at my side for a long time
 now.  I trust him with my life."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thoroughfare</span>
 You are on the carnival's main thoroughfare.  Here, it turns.  You can
 head west toward most of the booths and tents or you can head
 southeast where you can see a swan pond and a number of other
 buildings.  In the distance there, you can see the roller-coaster and
 ferris wheel, among other attractions.  To the immediate north is a
 Parisian theater, where silent films are shown, no doubt.  To the
 southwest is a dunk-a-clown booth.

>go north

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parisian Theater Lobby</span>
 Coming in from the bright, autumn sunlight, it takes a moment for your
 eyes to adjust.  You find yourself in a dark lobby, dimly lit by a
 couple of wall lamps in an attempt at an ersatz Hollywood theater.
 The theater itself is beyond a curtain to the north.  An attendant,
 dressed in a poorly-fitting belhop uniform, sits on a stool, allowing
 admittance.

 You can see Edgar Coombs here.

 Edgar Coombs goes north.

 You say hello to George Suggs.

 Edgar Coombs arrives from the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Swan Pond</span>
 This is the northern edge of a natural looking swan pond.  It was
 installed in the center of the park as if the park was built around
 it.  True to its name, swans lazily drift about on its surface.  The
 carnival's main thoroughfare is to the northwest.  You can walk around
 the pond to the southeast or southwest.  The men's restroom building
 is to the north and the women's is to the east.  Between them, to the
 northeast, is a small path leading to the House of Freaks.  To the
 west is the ice house.

 You can hear the tinny sound of a radio playing a flat-sounding
 version of <span class="floydstyle em">Blue Danube.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">House of Freaks Entrance</span>
 The front of this building is dressed up to appear as a large circus
 tent.  Two entrances allow visitors to choose which direction to take
 this tour of freaks; north or northwest.  The north side of the swan
 pond can be reached by heading southwest.  A wooded path leads
 southeast.  A carnival barker shouts at any who would hear; hustling
 them to enter the building and experience the grotesque wonders
 within.

>go north

 You enter the House of Freaks. . .

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall of Freaks</span>
 The inside of this building is made of a hall with cubicles built on
 the sides to display the freaks.  The place is fetid and rank with an
 odor as persistent as it is undefinable.  You will certainly never
 forget it.  On the east wall, bars prevent you from entering the
 cubicle of Wong Fu Ji, <span class="floydstyle em">The Amazing Indian Rubber Man</span>.
 Opposite him, on the west wall, you can see through bars to Rondo
 Moresby, <span class="floydstyle em">The Most Horrible Man in America</span>.  Signs below the
 bars tell you this information.  The house continues to the north and
 the exit is to the south.

>examine rondo

 Rondo Moresby is an extremely grotesque individual.  He simply sits on
 a stool to be stared at as an ugly, ugly man.

>talk to rondo

 You say hello to Rondo Moresby.

 (You could ask him about himself or the incidents.)

>ask about himself

 "Well, what's your story?" you ask the unfortunate looking man.

 "Just a freak.  Like you." he says, "Keep it moving, this ain't a peep
 show."

 "That's almost exactly what it is." you tell him.

 "Look, buddy, if the sidewalk were made of cocks, you'd find a way to
 walk on yer ass.  Now keep it moving!"

 Yeah?," you say, "Well, if assholes could fly, this carnival would be
 an airport."

 exist in the north wall and the east wall.  Signs here indicate that
 the resident of the north cell is Fatima Flores, <span class="floydstyle em">The Fat</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Lady</span>, and sure enough, she's at least 500 pounds.  The east cell

 five-legged calf, and the south is a cell holding the

 In the cell is a small pool of black liquid.  In the pool is a large
 tentacle; about eight feet long and a foot thick.  You've never seen
 anything like it.  It is dead, of course, but doesn't have the suction
 pads on it as an octopus's tentacle would have.  The more you consider
 it, the more disturbing it is to you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Carousel</span>
 You are on the north side of a once-grand carousel.  You can tell she
 was, at one time, a glamorous machine that delighted families for many
 years, but now, the faded paint and chipped wood gives her an
 almost-sinister air.  A path into some trees heads west.  You can walk
 around the carousel to the southeast and southwest.  The carousel is
 spinning somewhat fast.  In fact, you're not certain you'd safely make
 it on there if you tried, unless you jumped, maybe.  It spins in
 silence, the music having stopped long ago.

 You see a balloon float off in the distance.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Carousel</span>
 You are on a once-grand carousel that is spinning rather rapidly.  The
 horses and other animals of the ride are chipping their paint and
 cracking their wood, making them ugly, frightening things.  A
 maintainance door leads into the center portion of the carousel, but
 as it is spinning rather fast, it would be a challenge to get in
 there.

 You make an attempt at opening the door, but the carousel is spinning
 a bit too rapidly.  Maybe next time, you'll have better luck.

 You make your move and quickly get yourself into the maintainance
 door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Carousel Maintainance Room</span>
 You are in the center of the carousel.  Gears and cogs grind and spin,
 keeping the ride in rapid motion.  A door leads out to the ride to the
 east and a ladder leads down into darkness.  The smell of grease and
 smoke fills your nose and the sound of the gears grinding fills your
 ears.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave of Junk</span>

 the surface of the stone is slick with moisture.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pump Room</span>
 This is some sort of pump room where plumbing and pipes seem to work
 on flushing the sewage from the room above.  Where it goes, you cannot
 say.  Passages lead northeast, northwest, southwest,  and south.  You
 see a trapdoor closed above you.

 Standing in the chamber is a dark figure.  As you look closer, you see
 it is a rotting corpse, yet it peers at you with eyes that are
 definitely alive. . .somewhat.

 The horrible zombie attacks you again and, somehow, it is quicker than
 you anticipated.  It tears you to shreds.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Shore</span>
 This is the muddy shore of a fast-moving underground river.  The river

 darkness to the west.  The sound of rushing water echoes about in this
 chamber.

 You can't go that way.
>go northwest

 You can't go that way.

 It would be impossible to swim up that river.

 You decide against jumping into the river as you've no guarantee it

 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

 The hideous zombie arrives from the northwest.

 The hideous zombie seems barely aware of you.

 You fire a few rounds into the walking corpse but it is unaffected by
 your attack with the revolver.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Water Bridge</span>
 You stand on a natural bridge over a dark and turbulent underground
 river flowing to the southwest.  The bridge spans northwest to
 southeast and, of course, it looks ridiculously dangerous to cross as
 the surface of the stone is slick with moisture.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Moon Pool</span>
 This is, by far, the largest cavern you've explored so far.  In the
 center is a large, scum-covered pool of black water.  From the corner
 of your eye, when you aren't looking, you <span class="floydstyle em">think</span> there is
 movement within it.  Near the edge on one of the pool's sides is a
 wooden podium and a number of wooden benches set up like some sort of
 blasphemous church.  A wide tunnel leads east while smaller passages
 lead west and south.

 On the wooden podium is a stained notebook.

>read notebook

 (putting the revolver into the trenchcoat to make room)
 You take the stained notebook from the wooden podium.

 The first page tells you its title: <span class="floydstyle em">Translation of the Black Book</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of Shudde M'ell</span>.  It goes on to a litany regarding huge,
 tentacled worms that burrow beneath the earth.  Apparently, it is a
 book for worshipping these dreaded horrors.  Before closing the book,
 you see it also contains instructions for human sacrifice as well as
 the creation of zombies.  Near the back is a list, written in blood,
 in various handwritings, of the names of the carnies with the head
 signature: <span class="floydstyle em">WIlberforce Wyatt</span>.  With this damning evidence,
 you should confront Wyatt and get this carnival of cultists shut down.

>get it

 You already have that.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Widest Tunnel</span>
 This is the widest tunnel you've seen in this underground labrynth.
 It originates from the room with the black pool to the west and it
 recedes into darkness to the east.  You have a very uneasy feeling
 about this tunnel.

>go east

 You walk east for as long as your willpower allows, but the terror
 creeps up in your brain and you quickly walk back to near the
 beginning of the tunnel.

 The stench in this cave is overwhelmingly disgusting.  The reason why
 is evident enough; numerous corpses, in various states of decay, hang
 from chains fastened to the ceiling.  Passages lead northwest, where
 an eerie, rosy glow seems to emenate, and east, into more darkness.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thoroughfare</span>
 You are on the carnival's main thoroughfare.  Here, it turns.  You can
 head west toward most of the booths and tents or you can head
 southeast where you can see a swan pond and a number of other
 buildings.  In the distance there, you can see the roller-coaster and
 ferris wheel, among other attractions.  To the immediate north is a
 Parisian theater, where silent films are shown, no doubt.  To the
 southwest is a dunk-a-clown booth.

 You smell hot dogs for a brief moment, but then it goes away.

>se


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Swan Pond</span>
 This is the northern edge of a natural looking swan pond.  It was
 installed in the center of the park as if the park was built around
 it.  True to its name, swans lazily drift about on its surface.  The
 carnival's main thoroughfare is to the northwest.  You can walk around
 the pond to the southeast or southwest.  The men's restroom building
 is to the north and the women's is to the east.  Between them, to the
 northeast, is a small path leading to the House of Freaks.  To the
 west is the ice house.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East of Swan Pond</span>
 You are at the eastern side of a natural looking swan pond.  It was

 can walk around the pond to the northwest and southwest.  To your
 east, the carousel summons you with its hurdy-gurdy music.  In the
 distance to the southwest, you can see the roller coaster and ferris
 wheel.

 You hear a scream in the distance; perhaps from one of the rides.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of Swan Pond</span>
 This is the southern point of a natural looking swan pond.  It was
 installed in the center of the park as if the park was built around
 it.  True to its name, swans lazily drift about on its surface.  You
 can walk around the pond to the northeast or northwest.  From here,
 you can also walk a path to the ferris wheel to the southeast.

>se


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ferris Wheel</span>
 A young and tall carny mans this ride, assisting any carnival-goers on
 and off the ferris wheel.  At this time of season, those
 carnival-goers are few and far between.  The ferris wheel itself is
 surprisingly sturdy in its appearance, however, like all things in
 this carnival, it needs a fresh coat of paint.  For some reason, this
 seems to be an extra-tall ferris wheel, larger than the one in Coney
 Island, from what you can remember.  The Ferris wheel sits by the
 river, on the edge of the carnival.  The only path is back to the swan
 pond to the northwest.

 You can see Royce Brunner here.

 A path leads south to the roller coaster.

 You smell a pungent smell of burning meat.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roller Coaster Pavillion</span>
 This is a picnic area for the carnival.  A large wooden roof is held
 over some empty picnic tables.  A trash can accompanies the area.
 Here, at the end of the season, the place is desolate.  The roller
 coaster, a scary and cantankerous wooden contraption, is to the south.
 Once in awhile, the coaster's cars can be seen and heard traversing
 its slopes, but when you look, you don't see any riders on it.  A path
 leads back to carnival to the north and the coaster's entrance is to
 the south.

 You can see Elmer Walker here.

 Standing around as if waiting for someone is your client, of all
 people: the police chief Elmer Walker.  He waves at you while wiping
 his brow and popping a heart pill due to his extreme obesity.

 "What are you doing here?" you ask as you approach.

 "I came to see how you're coming along.  Join me on the coaster." he
 says and he heads south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roller Coaster Entrance</span>
 A carny guards this entrance.  He is the greasiest you've seen thus
 far.  The entrance leads to the track where the cars wait for
 passengers.  You can leave the roller coaster area and reach it's
 picnic pavillion by heading north.

 You can see Elmer Walker and Greasy Pete here.

 The carny nods his head to the two of you to board the cars and,
 dutifully, you do so.  Elmer, being obese, has already tilted the car
 a bit off the track, terrifying you already.

 The cars are pulled up the hill by the lift chain and Elmer begins
 talking to you.  "So, detective, I wanted to let you know that I went
 to the asylum and visited that poor Kent Howard boy: the one from the
 first incident report.  I couldn't get much out of him, the way he
 babbles now about horrors from the grave and such, but one thing he
 said really struck me as odd." the police chief pops another heart
 pill and the cars reach the first peak.

>show notebook to elmer

 You aren't able to do that while riding on a rickety roller coaster.

 The car suddenly drops down the first hill.  WInd whips your ears and
 your gut sinks as your plummet.  Strangely, Elmer keeps talking as if
 the two of you are simply seated on a park bench, "The lad said that
 the biggest corpse in the whole world must be buried under the
 cemetery where he and Lucy were attacked."

 The cars hit a bank turn on the coaster and you are thrown into
 Elmer's bulk.  He doesn't seem to notice and instead, keeps talking.

>wait

 Time passes.

 "I asked him why he said that," Elmer says, "And the boy says to me,
 <span class="floydstyle em">because of the maggots.  Such big maggots must come from a big</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">man's body.</span>"

 You're not sure what to think as the coaster is sending you up and
 down on a row of small hills in the track.  You start to feel sick.
 Elmer turns to you and asks, "Have you found out anything, or are you
 just farting around here?"

>show notebook to elmer

 You aren't able to do that while riding on a rickety roller coaster.

 "Well," you tell him, trying to speak over the noise of the coaster,
 "I discovered there are passages to some underground lair here."

 "Interesting." Elmer says, but he seems not too phased about what you
 just told him.  "Just keep at it.  Be sure to really check out the fun
 house, that mirror house, and that carousel, for sure.  We'll meet up
 again soon." and no sooner does he say this, the ride comes to a stop
 and you disembark with your obese client.  Without saying anything
 more, he wanders off, not wanting to be seen too long with you.

 who-knows-where and the exit back to the park is south.

 You are a private eye; a gumshoe, as they say, and you appear as such.

>examine desk

 It is a large, wooden desk; a bit fancy and out-of-place in this
 trailer.  It has a drawer that is closed.

>open drawer

 You open the drawer, revealing a black tome.

>read tome

 This is a black tome handwritten in Latin with what looks like dried
 blood.  No doubt, whatever this book is, it is evil.

 A man stands behind the counter, looking bored.

>examine mementos

 Nothing here is worth much or of any real interest.  But then you
 notice strange wood carvings on a shelf in the back.  They appear to
 be rearing fat worms with heads full of groping tentacles.  They
 almost make you sick staring at them.

 inside the ticket booth, eyeing you expectingly.

>go west

 That heads into the woods.  You shouldn't be heading in that
 direction.

 You head back up the road to the boarding house.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Walk</span>
 This is the front walk to Mother Matheson's boarding house, where
 you'll be staying.  Her porch is to the west and the main road is to
 the east.  Her lawn is dotted with dogwoods and covered in leaves.

 You can see Arthur Peabody here.

>go east

 You should get your room key (and maybe gather some information)
 before you head to the carnival.

 Arthur Peabody straightens his tie and breathes in the cool air.

 ferris wheel, among other attractions.  To the immediate north is a
 Parisian theater, where silent films are shown, no doubt.  To the
 southwest is a dunk-a-clown booth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Swan Pond</span>
 This is the northern edge of a natural looking swan pond.  It was

 the pond to the southeast or southwest.  The men's restroom building
 is to the north and the women's is to the east.  Between them, to the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ferris Wheel</span>
 A young and tall carny mans this ride, assisting any carnival-goers on
 and off the ferris wheel.  At this time of season, those
 carnival-goers are few and far between.  The ferris wheel itself is
 surprisingly sturdy in its appearance, however, like all things in
 this carnival, it needs a fresh coat of paint.  For some reason, this
 seems to be an extra-tall ferris wheel, larger than the one in Coney
 Island, from what you can remember.  The Ferris wheel sits by the
 river, on the edge of the carnival.  The only path is back to the swan
 pond to the northwest.

 You can see Royce Brunner here.

 Newspapers blow by like so much forgotten trash.

 New actions in this game include "shoot {someone}".  You just have to
 be holding your revolver when you want to do this.  You can also
 "listen to doors and "unlock door(s) with lock pick".

 During conversations, you can type "topics" to see a list of relevant
 topics you can ask about.  You can show and give things to people as
 well.

 In my games, when you "examine", you are doing so only with your eyes,
 but when you "search", you are also using your hands, so these actions
 usually produce different results.

 There are random events in this game, so if something happens the
 first time, it's not a guarantee it will happen that way again.  Good
 luck!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narrow Tunnel</span>
 This is a narrow tunnel carved into the earth.  It is just wide enough
 for you to traverse through.  Passages lead northwest, east, and
 south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fungi Cave</span>
 This is a small cavern littered with stalagmites and stalactites (but
 you've never remembered which is which).  Fungi grows inbetween all of
 these stone formations.  These mushrooms all glow with a sickening
 reddish light.  Passages exist north and northeast.

 Standing in the chamber is a dark figure.  As you look closer, you see
 it is a rotting corpse, yet it peers at you with eyes that are
 definitely alive. . .somewhat.

 The horrible zombie seems more aware of you and lashes out.
 It rakes your skin with its claws and manages to bite your shoulder.
 You holler out in pain.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Moist Tunnel</span>
 This is a circular tunnel with no features, however, the walls are
 slick with moisture.  Passages lead west, southwest, and east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wide Tunnel</span>
 This cave opens into an irregular space, even for an underground
 cavern.  Tight passages lead west, northeast, east, and southeast, but
 a wide tunnel leads south.  Each passage leads into pitch darkness and
 the air is still and close here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fungi Tunnel</span>
 This is a very long tunnel that glows with an eerie reddish light.
 The source of the light is the millions of bioilluminescent mushrooms
 that grow on every surface.  The tunnel stretches northwest to
 southeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pump Room</span>
 This is some sort of pump room where plumbing and pipes seem to work
 on flushing the sewage from the room above.  Where it goes, you cannot
 say.  Passages lead northeast, northwest, southwest,  and south.  You
 see a trapdoor closed above you.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave of Pillars</span>

 stalactites have merged, making a strange, natural temple of pillars.
 Passages lead north, southeast, and southwest.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Moon Pool</span>
 This is, by far, the largest cavern you've explored so far.  In the
 center is a large, scum-covered pool of black water.  From the corner
 of your eye, when you aren't looking, you <span class="floydstyle em">think</span> there is
 movement within it.  Near the edge on one of the pool's sides is a
 wooden podium and a number of wooden benches set up like some sort of
 blasphemous church.  A wide tunnel leads east while smaller passages
 lead west and south.

>search pool

 It was probably pilfered from a schoolhouse somewhere.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave of Corpses</span>
 The stench in this cave is overwhelmingly disgusting.  The reason why
 is evident enough; numerous corpses, in various states of decay, hang
 from chains fastened to the ceiling.  Passages lead northwest, where
 an eerie, rosy glow seems to emenate, and east, into more darkness.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Muddy Cave</span>
 This cave's ceiling is lost in the darkness above.  The rest of it is

 Passages lead southeast, northwest, and west.

 Seemingly dropped from above, a wrecked ride-car from one of the
 carnival's amusement rides is half-sunk in the mud here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Water Bridge</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave of Junk</span>
 This is a small cave cluttered with random junk.  Bits of metal,
 pipes, tubing, cogs, and bolts litter the ground.  A ladder leads
 upwards through a hole in the rock and some floorboards beyond.  The
 only passage leads northwest.

>search junk

 You search among the bits of random junk but find nothing useful.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Carousel Maintainance Room</span>
 You are in the center of the carousel.  Gears and cogs grind and spin,
 keeping the ride in rapid motion.  A door leads out to the ride to the
 east and a ladder leads down into darkness.  The smell of grease and
 smoke fills your nose and the sound of the gears grinding fills your
 ears.

>open door

 You can't see any such thing.

>exit

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Carousel</span>
 You are on a once-grand carousel that is spinning rather rapidly.  The
 horses and other animals of the ride are chipping their paint and
 cracking their wood, making them ugly, frightening things.  A
 maintainance door leads into the center portion of the carousel, but
 as it is spinning rather fast, it would be a challenge to get in
 there.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Carousel</span>
 You are on the north side of a once-grand carousel.  You can tell she
 was, at one time, a glamorous machine that delighted families for many
 years, but now, the faded paint and chipped wood gives her an
 almost-sinister air.  A path into some trees heads west.  You can walk
 around the carousel to the southeast and southwest.  The carousel is
 spinning somewhat fast.  In fact, you're not certain you'd safely make
 it on there if you tried, unless you jumped, maybe.  It spins in
 silence, the music having stopped long ago.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forked Path</span>
 This is a forked path amid some trees.  From here, you can head
 northwest to the House of Freaks.  The carousel is nearby and you can
 reach the north side of it by heading east or the west side by heading
 south.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">House of Freaks Entrance</span>
 The front of this building is dressed up to appear as a large circus
 tent.  Two entrances allow visitors to choose which direction to take
 this tour of freaks; north or northwest.  The north side of the swan
 pond can be reached by heading southwest.  A wooded path leads
 southeast.  A carnival barker shouts at any who would hear; hustling
 them to enter the building and experience the grotesque wonders
 within.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Swan Pond</span>
 This is the northern edge of a natural looking swan pond.  It was
 installed in the center of the park as if the park was built around
 it.  True to its name, swans lazily drift about on its surface.  The
 carnival's main thoroughfare is to the northwest.  You can walk around
 the pond to the southeast or southwest.  The men's restroom building
 is to the north and the women's is to the east.  Between them, to the
 northeast, is a small path leading to the House of Freaks.  To the
 west is the ice house.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thoroughfare</span>
 You are on the carnival's main thoroughfare.  Here, it turns.  You can
 head west toward most of the booths and tents or you can head
 southeast where you can see a swan pond and a number of other
 buildings.  In the distance there, you can see the roller-coaster and
 ferris wheel, among other attractions.  To the immediate north is a
 Parisian theater, where silent films are shown, no doubt.  To the
 southwest is a dunk-a-clown booth.

 You smell a pungent smell of burning meat.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thoroughfare</span>

 road flanking its western side and a line of tents, buildings, and
 booths lining the east side.  To the east, the thoroughfare continues
 deeper into the carnival grounds.  To the southeast is a baseball toss
 booth and to your north is the funhouse, standing ominous and decaying
 in the autumn sun.

 You see a balloon float off in the distance.

 You can't go that way.

 turns by heading northeast.  The western border is the road back to
 town and the eastern border is flanked with buildings, tents, and
 booths.  To your immediate east is a booth with a sign hanging above
 it stating <span class="floydstyle em">Baseball Toss</span>.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Baseball Toss Booth</span>
 You stand before a baseball toss booth on the thoroughfare.  In it, a
 carny stands before a wall of cheap stuffed animals and novelty gifts.
 Before the wall of prizes is a table with bottles stacked on each
 other.  Carnival-goers try to pitch baseballs to knock over the
 bottles to win the prizes.  The main thoroughfare can be easily
 reached to the west and the fun house stands to the northwest.

 You hear the sound of laughter from somewhere, but it is a mirthless,
 chilling sound.

>talk to carny

 You say hello to 'Sparrow' Gubatosi.

 (You could ask him about himself, the incidents, Wilberforce Wyatt or
 Jonathan Boom.)

>ask sparrow about wyatt

 You can't see any such thing.

>ask gubatosi about wyatt

 "What can you tell me of Wyatt?" you ask.

 "He's an alright boss.  What do you want to know?" he asks.

 "Well, I guess I'm looking to find out how legit this guy is.  I mean,
 his carnival is starting to get some really bad attention." you
 explain.

 "Yes." the carny suddenly seems to get a little angry, but you're not
 sure at what, "I told him we don't want no bad press or attention." he
 says under his breath.  "You wanna throw a damn ball or what?"

>ask him about himself

 "What's this?  Some sort of ball toss booth?" you ask.

 The sinister-looking carny stares at you like you're insane for a
 moment.  "Wanna try?" he finally asks, holding out a baseball for you.
>yes
 moment.  "Wanna try?" he finally asks, holding out a baseball for you.

 "Gimme the thing." you snatch the ball out of his hand.

>examine game

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine booth

 A carny stands before a wall of cheap stuffed animals and novelty
 gifts and before the wall of prizes is a table with bottles stacked on
 each other.

 You smell hot dogs for a brief moment, but then it goes away.

>throw ball at bottles

 You furiously throw the baseball at the stacked bottles and they
 explode apart from each other.  You even hear an onlooker say "Whoah".
 The carny replaces the stacked bottles and throws you a kewpie doll.

 "Get outta my face, mister." he says.

 You see a balloon float off in the distance.

>examine kewpie

 It's like a naked cupid or something.

 You smell a pungent smell of burning meat.

>ask carny about incidents

 "I suppose you don't know anything about the recent grisly incidents
 here at your fine park, do you?" you say, already knowing the answer.

 "You hit the nail on the head, mister."
