 'em!




 The spirits called you each off to one side. Said they had riddles.
 You'd boned up on mythological puzzles and even guessed the stab
 wound/hanged man and puddle of water right your first time; You felt
 confident, but you got straight-out math.

 Your pal wanted a beautiful wife--thought he'd get a lady-and-tiger
 deal but instead had to choose number one of a thousand and one. At
 least he got time to browse.

 You had to go with writing the perfect song. Beautiful women would
 follow. Nobody said you'd get to sing it, though. Still, you've got at
 least a chance in a thousand--well, a thousand and one--of getting it
 right. Maybe even better.

 One of these doors ahead holds that song--it's all you, but universal,
 as well. The other thousand? Gulp.

 Fingertips: I Walk Along Darkened Corridors -- Episode 37 of the
 Apollo 18 Tribute by Andrew Schultz
 Release 2 / Serial number 120518 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Room of 1001 Doors</span>
 Ten paths branch in front of you, to ten darkened stairways each, with
 five doors on each side of the stairways. You'll have to walk down one
 of them. Well, actually, there's door 1001. It seems boarded up for
 effect, but it's got drawings on it.

 You hear a hum in the distance--sounds like a natural C. A muscular
 statue holding a "Best Center Half Back Ever" trophy is in the center,
 and a starry-eyed statue is carrying a big not-quite-ball with a tag
 dangling from it. The tag reads "Virgo."

 You see a table of fractions and a yellowed chart of football
 positions here, and a small billboard with five electronically
 rendered dice seems to provide a diversion.

 You can see an angel with a pitchfork and a devil with a halo here.

>examine angel
 'em!


 He gestures to the doors in front of you and twirls his pitchfork. He
 suddenly looks down, blinks and wipes out a number written on one
 hand. You noticed it said <span class="floydstyle i">Combo is 343-391-439 for supreme world</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">leader</span>.

>examine devil

 He gestures to the doors in front of you and primps his haloYou don't
 catch any more hints, though. He's a bit too alert right now.

 You haven't gone all ethereal, yet. At least you don't have to wear
 some corny robes.

>examine 1001
 'em!


 Door 1001 is different from the other doors. You see a treble clef
 with a note on the second rung from the bottom. There's a picture of a
 guy holding a serpent, which you know/can deduce as Ophiuchus. There's
 also a depiction of a three-on-one where the leftmost advanced player
 is about to shoot on goal.

 First, I would like to thank my beta-tester. So should you--any bugs
 and nuisances you find would've been worse without his mails checking
 what I needed to get right. His name is Melvin Rangasamy, and I hope
 you enjoy his puzzles in this collection, too.

 I'd also like to thank David Welbourn, who doesn't know he partially
 inspired this game with his simpler and catchier <span class="floydstyle em">69,105 keys.</span>

 However, this game would not have been conceived without Kevin
 Jackson-Mead organizing the entire album tribute.

 I would also like to thank Ryan Veeder for creating a document of
 ideas for each song/game, and all the people on IFMud and
 intfiction.org who helped with coding and implementation details that
 often led to bigger realizations. There are too many people to name.

 Of course, general thanks go to Graham Nelson for creating Inform 7,
 David Kinder for creating the Windows front-end, and Aaron Reed for
 his wonderful book Programming in Inform 7. If you'd like to try your
 hand at writing, check the IDE out on inform7.com, or Sand-Dancer,
 Aaron's excellent sample game from the book at
 [<a href="http://inform7.textories.com/.Thanks">LINK</A>] to the creators of Inform 7, the
 organizer of this tribute album, and you, for sticking with this.

 In that song you realize everyone has that sort of song when they die,

 time--to lament not choosing door 543.

 From beyond the void, you hear mumbling about not filling out the

 No, you won't write it right away. Inspiration doesn't work like
 that." And it doesn't. What you felt as you walked through that
 door--those doors--takes a while to express, and when you figure it
 out, you can't believe how simple it is.

 It's incredibly catchy--something that can be caught only in song, not
 quite in a game or science or even the company of friends, but you
 know there were other better songs you lost despite paying attention.
 It's sung by a beautiful woman who follows it up with the song of a
 man who realized she was the most beautiful of a thousand when nobody
 else did, then realized he was not good enough for her. Sentimental
 rubbish but it stays at #1 longer than your effort, somehow.

 You spend the rest of your life trying, but failing, to expound on or
 recapture the whole incident with a follow-up song that's really
 yours. But it is oddly fulfilling.

 Congratulations! You figured this game out. Nothing more to see here.

 The spirits called you each off to one side. Said they had riddles.
 You'd boned up on mythological puzzles and even guessed the stab
 wound/hanged man and puddle of water right your first time; You felt
 confident, but you got straight-out math.

 Your pal wanted a beautiful wife--thought he'd get a lady-and-tiger
 deal but instead had to choose number one of a thousand and one. At
 least he got time to browse.

 You had to go with writing the perfect song. Beautiful women would
 follow. Nobody said you'd get to sing it, though. Still, you've got at
 least a chance in a thousand--well, a thousand and one--of getting it
 right. Maybe even better.

 One of these doors ahead holds that song--it's all you, but universal,
 as well. The other thousand? Gulp.

 Hmm. There's no actual writing. At the top, you see shows five lines
 in an S through a 3-by-3 square of dots...and a big red X through all
 that. Below, there're four lines next to an intact 3-by-3 square.
 There are a few more pages on the inside, too.

 There're diagrams about spacesuit operation--likely, the one you're
 holding--and how it protects from radiation and heat and so forth. The
 wavy lines and fire are universal enough. No letters are needed. But
 you don't see any dangers here, so maybe there's more useful later.

 There's a close-up of a lever on the side of the spacesuit. Two-way
 arrows indicate that it detects bends, or changes in direction. You

 You see a square of nine faces -- the middle frowny and red, the
 others smiley and green. The northwest -- assuming north is up -- has
 little sunshiney rays around it. Maybe the last bit will be more
 informative.



 Hmph. Just a finger pointing at you, a brain with lines coming from it
 (it appears to have just jumped from a box,) and pictures of medals
 and ribbons. But there's a loose page behind.

>examine loose page


 You rip the page from the brochure.

 There's a whole hash of universal warning symbols including a circle
 with a line through it--some poor stupid looking face is crossed out.
 There's also someone wearing a spacesuit next to a crossed-out stick
 figure that is not.

 There's a big exclamation mark in the upper right-hand corner--a
 pretty universal meaning. The slots on the left side are labeled A, B
 and C, from top to bottom (okay, they're unreadable glyphs. But you
 have to call them SOMEthing.) On the right, there's D, which you
 decide is a tab.

 B and D are parallel with the middle row, while A is close to the top
 row, and C is close to the bottom row.

 Would you like to see a physical representation?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Principal Area</span>
 This is a slightly raised platform area in the center of the
 boggle-box you've been transported into. You can go one move in any of
 the usual 2-d directions, even the crazy ones, before hitting a wall.

 The pedestal you took the spacesuit from is here, too. It's prominent
 enough that you couldn't trip over it if you tried.

>examine pedestal


 It's cylindrical, with an odd diagonal line down the side--you'd think
 it'd be straight up and down, but it's perpendicular to a ramp that
 seems to circle the outside.

 There's a hole about the size of the ball you're carrying on top of
 the ramp, and you can see a couple drawings, too.

>examine drawings


 You see two pictures: one, a grid of nine dots, and another, a black
 eight-pointed star with a big red X through its center. The star looks
 as below:

    *     *

>examine ramp


 You can't actually touch inside it--it's covered all the way down. But
 it cuts a spiral through the cylindrical pedestal that winds around
 almost three times before the hole at the bottom. The line cutting
 through the pedestal starts just to one side of the entry and to the
 other side of the exit.

>put ball in ramp


 That can't contain things.

>put ball in hole


 It drops into the hole and begins its spiralling descent around the
 outside of the pedestal. After a half-minute, the ball rolls slowly
 out the bottom. You could pick it up and try again, if you want.

>take ball


 Taken.

>put ball in hole


 It's fun to watch the ball roll down, but you doubt you're doing
 anything.

 You remember rolling a penny down a similar spiral at some toy store.

 Whee! Somehow, it never quite gets boring.

 Okay, I lied. You start wondering what the ramp is there for, or what

 You roll the ball down the ramp yet again.

 This is a slightly raised platform area in the center of the
 boggle-box you've been transported into. You can go one move in any of
 the usual 2-d directions, even the crazy ones, before hitting a wall.

 A protective spacesuit hangs on a pedestal. Well, you'd guess it's
 protective, since it doesn't look very fashionable.

 [Type ABOUT to find out more about this game, or CREDITS to find out
 more about people who helped make it, or make it better.]

>wear suit


 (first taking the protective spacesuit)
 Hmm. As you pick it up, a brochure falls off the pedestal and onto the
 floor, and a small lead ball also falls from a sleeve onto the ground.

 You also see the spacesuit was covering a couple of drawings.

 The suit fits comfortably. You didn't need instructions to put the
 spacesuit on, but...maybe for what do to while you're in it?
