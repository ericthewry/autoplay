 Wumpity, wumpity, wumpity. That's the sound of your bouncing bottom as
 you struggle to guide your plane through the storms of the Bermuda
 Triangle. Eventually, you crashland with a great wallop on an unknown
 island below! The jolt throws both you and the bag you were
 transporting out of your Sopwith Camel, giving you a good knock on the
 noggin.

 You stand up, shake off the impact, pick up the bag addressed to
 Handsome Manor, and set out to explore the mysterious (and hopefully
 saucy) unknown.

>examine camel

 It's your plane. It seems to have suffered a lot of damage during the
 landing. Probably because it was more of a crash than it was a
 landing.

>read sign

 The sign reads, "Welcome to Calembour! All are welcome here!" Well,
 the sign <span class="floydstyle em">would</span> read that if the words weren't crossed out.
 Beneath them, the phrase "All hail Count Dashing!" is crudely painted.

>take sign

 It's firmly rooted in the ground. Perhaps you should take it as a sign
 to go exploring!

>take plane

 There are far too many and they are far too large to lug around.

>fly plane

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

>examine plane

 You see planes from all stages of history, including a few that look
 like they could either be experimental or from the future. This must
 be where all the planes that enter the Bermuda Triangle end up...
 including your very own!

>examine me

 A flock of wristwatches flaps across the sky. Time sure flies here!

 Sheesh, is it vain in here or is it just you?

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a bag

>examine bag

 It's addressed to Lord Handsome. Below the address it says "DO NOT
 OPEN" in large, very serious letters.

 It looks like something is moving inside it.

 *** A voice cries "You fool! You let the cat out of the
 bag!" before a feline indeed leaps out and scampers away like a cat
 out of hell.

 ** You wonder how you're going to explain this to your boss before
 realising it's not an issue since you're now stranded in Calembour.
 You eventually forge a new life for yourself by setting up a business
 that specialises in selling laces for left shoes.

 ** It seems curiousity didn't kill this cat. Instead, it killed your
 chances of getting off this island! ***

 There are none at all available!

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 You are at a crossroads. The Great Planes are north, a bar is to the
 east and paths continue to the south and west.

 The crossroads mumble morosely under your feet.

>mumble back

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

>listen

 You can't hear much over the crossroads being... cross!

 The crossroads grouch grumpily under your feet.

 The crossroads mumble morosely under your feet.

>stomp crossroads

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

>cross road

 Pardon? You can see no such thing.

>talk to crossroads

 If you want to attempt conversation with someone (or something), try
 asking them about something. For example, "ask puppy about ball."

 The crossroads mutter moodily under your feet.

>ask crossroads about bar

 They respond with various expletives that make it rather clear they're
 not interested in conversation.

 The crossroads mutter moodily under your feet.

>fuck

 Now, now! There's no need for that! If you're becoming frustrated,
 it's always possible to type "HINT" for a little help!

 The crossroads grouch grumpily under your feet.

>go east

 You can see nothing but a shimmering desert to the east!

 The crossroads mutter moodily under your feet.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Intersection</span>
 You arrive at an intersection that's less grumpy than the one you
 encountered earlier. Paths lead north, south, east and wes... whoa,
 hold up, there are totally some naked chicks here!

>examine bar

 A long, metal bar. One could also consider it a pole.

>examine chicks

 These babes are incredibly cute!

>pet chicks

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Car Park</span>
 You're standing in an empty car park. A path leads west while desert
 extends in all other directions.

 You can see a tall sign and a pedestal here.

>read sign

 It reads "Calembour Bar & Chill: Gateway to Rudeville."

>examine pedestal

 It's a pedestal slightly taller than you. A plaque is attatched to it,
 and you can also see that there is a long, cylindrical groove along
 the top.

 It appears to be made of bronze. It reads: "The gateway between the
 Outlands and Rudeville has been sealed by the order of Count Dashing."

>examine groove

 It's long and cylindrical.

>put bar in groove

 (the bar in groove)
 The bar throbs and pulsates before rapidly bubbling and expanding into
 the famous Calembour Bar & Chill!

 Talk about raising the bar!

>enter bar

 (the bar entrance)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Calembour Bar & Chill</span>
 The crowd inside the bar cheers as soon as you enter! Many of the
 patrons say they would offer you a drink for breaking Count Dashing's
 seal, but apparently they've been trapped for so long that they're
 near the end of their alcohol supply so have none to spare. They say
 they hope you understand and return to their merriment, freeing you to
 continue your adventure.

 You can see a bartender and some bar patrons here.

>examine bartender

 He's looking rather dapper in a tuxedo.

>examine tuxedo

 What a dapper outfit!

>take tuxedo

 "Hey, you two at the back!" the bartender yells. "Stop throwing
 tantrums at each other!"

 That would be more than a little rude!

>ask bartender about tuxedo

 "This thing? Oh, I use it to cover up my rude bits."

>ask bartender about rude bits

 "Sorry, mate. Can't say I know much about that."

>ask bartender about chicks

 "Sorry, mate. Can't say I know much about that."

 *** Run-time problem P7: Too many rulebooks in simultaneous use.

>be merry

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

>ask patrons about chick

 They're too busy consuming alcopops (icy poles made from alcohol and
 shaped like beer bottles) and alcoholic ice cream among other things.

>ask bartender about ice cream

 "Sorry, mate. Can't say I know much about that."

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Calembour Bar & Chill</span>
 This themed bar is designed to look like an ice cavern. Dim, blue
 lights are coated with fake plastic ice and a low mist covers the
 ground. It's actually quite warm. A door is to the west and a sign is
 hanging on the south wall.

 You can see a bartender and some bar patrons here.

>read sign

 It says EX T.

>take bartender's eye

 Eh? Only the first bit of that sentence seemed to make sense.

>examine eye

 Pardon? You can see no such thing.

 There's a solid wall blocking the exit!

 It certainly looks cool! Haha, get it?

>ex t

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Big Apple</span>
 You're standing in the shadow of a gigantic apple. A path runs from
 east to west.

 A gentleman, who is clearly a tourist, runs up to you! "Excuse me!",
 he begins excitedly. "Could you take my picture, please?"

 You can see a tourist here.

>examine apple

 "Can you please take my picture, if it's not too much bother?"

 It looks a little rotten! But it's still impressively large. Some say
 it's the greatest apple in the world.

>take camera
>take a picture

 That's more than just a little rude!


 "It's just I want people to know I visited The Big Apple and I want
 proof! Taking a picture would be perfect! Picture perfect!"

 You take the tourist's picture and stuff it with the rest of your
 belongings.

 "Thanks!" he says before returning his gaze to The Big Apple.

 You see nothing special about the pith helmet.

>ask tourist about picture

 "Thanks again!"

>ask tourist about chicks

 "I haven't learned anything about that during my exploratory
 adventures, sorry!"

>thank tourist

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crime Scene</span>
 You walk onto what appears to be a film production set, complete with
 cameras and lights pointing into a room missing a fourth wall. The set
 appears to replicate a kitchen. A feeling of danger is in the air.
 Paths lead east and northeast.

 "You did do it, Hooyoo! Don't try to deny it, you bombastic bovine!
 Count Dashing told me everything!" You look towards the voice and find
 two women arguing. Or rather, one, Yoohoo, is yelling and the other,
 Hooyoo, is pleading for a return to sanity.

 After a few minutes of good hard bickering, Yoohoo notices you. "Aha!
 An impartial witness! Please, help us sort out this matter and show
 that I am correct! I know the proof will be around here somewhere!" A
 rather annoyed Hooyoo instead insists that you prove that Yoohoo is,
 in fact, incorrect.

 You can see an oven (closed), a closet (closed), a sink, cupboards
 (closed), a table (on which is pudding), Yoohoo and Hooyoo here.

>examine pudding

 It's a chocolate pudding. It looks delicious.

>feel danger

 Pardon? You can see no such thing.

 single tear appears on her face, accompanied by a trembling smile.

 "Oh Hooyoo! All this proves is the depths of your love for me!" They
 both burst into tears of joy and embrace each other! Once they finish
 cuddling, Hooyoo gives you a bear hug while thanking you for saving

 Searching that would reveal little.

 It looks like one of those old fashioned ovens from 50s sitcoms. It
 looks dangerously hot.

 It would appear completely normal if it weren't for the highly
 suspicious rattling sound coming from within.

 Nondescript kitchen cupboards. They appear to be trembling a little,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave Entrance</span>
 You are standing outside the entrance to a cave. A very mopey aura
 exudes from its innards. This feeling gets you rather down which,
 quite frankly, is rather inconsiderate of the cave. No, don't make
 excuses for it. It's selfish.

 The innards of the cave lie northwest. Paths also lead east and
 southwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lair of Salazar</span>
 You have entered the lair of Salazar, the legendary hermit. He sits in
 the middle of the cavern, looking like a gigantic pile of misery.
 Drawings cover the walls.

 The exit is southeast.

 You can see a handkerchief and Salazar here.

>examine drawings

 The walls are covered with frowny faces which appear to have been
 drawn with a marker.

>take all

 handkerchief: You edge closer to the handkerchief, revealing the words
 "Count Dashing" clearly embroidered into it. Most likely, this is a
 clue as to the owner. But why is it here?

 Suddenly, a gust of wind blows the hanky away and out of sight! It
 seems even the cave needs to clear its nasal passages every now and
 then. Thankfully, there wasn't any mucus.

>examine salazar

 The hermit beast of many legends, Salazar is a horned, blue skinned
 creature about nine feet tall with a lonely, sad expression on his
 face which is constantly flooded with tears.

>turn frown upside down

 Pardon? You can see no such thing.

>take salazar

 I don't suppose Salazar would care for that.

 It doesn't feel like it's quite enough to change his mood! You need
 something stronger.

>give salazar a bear hug

 A smile finally cracks across the face of Salazar. He giggles a little
 and hands you a magic marker, then sits back and sighs contentedly.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by twenty points.]</span>

 It's a magic marker. It says so right on the casing and why would it
 lie to you? There's also a warning label.

>examine label

 It says to only use the marker on official magic marker surfaces.

 Your art crumbles upon completion. Salazar shakes his head at you with
 a gentle smile on his face. It appears the marker's magic is weak
 inside this cave.

 middle of the city known as Rudeville, the rudest place in existence!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Poppycock Street</span>
 You're on Poppycock street, one of the many streets of Rudeville. It
 curves from north to east.

 You can see a very rude neon sign here.

>examine sign

 It says "YOU STINK" in large, obnoxious letters. You swear it's trying
 to flash its neon pink colour as condescendingly as it possibly can at
 you.

>smell me

 Ah, the sweet and sour smell of the city!

>smell sign

 A pair of running shoes rushes past you.

 Ah, the sweet and sour smell of the city!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Titmouse Square</span>
 You're in Rudeville's bustling heart of activity, Titmouse Square.
 Buildings climb high above you. Streets lead in all directions but
 some are blocked by large crowds of ever so rude people.

 The western street leads to the Calembour Bar & Chill and the
 Outlands. An alley is to the southeast and other unblocked streets
 lead south, southwest and north.

 You can see rude people here.

>stink

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

>examine people

 They look at you with a sneer fuelled with disgust.

>sneer

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

 A young woman drinking a bottle of ketchup rushes past. Now that was
 one saucy lady!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Assassin Alley</span>
 You're standing in a fairly nondescript alley. Well, the face on the
 southern wall is notable. Titmouse Square is northwest.

 You can see a brick wall here.

>examine wall

 It's a large brick wall, blocking your path! It has a face in the
 centre, staring back at you, looking very grumpy indeed.

>examine face

 (the brick wall)
 It's a large brick wall, blocking your path! It has a face in the
 centre, staring back at you, looking very grumpy indeed.

>ask wall about wall

 A gentleman trips over his own foot! He quickly reattaches it to his
 ankle while cursing whoever put his foot there, then continues on his
 way.

 Before you even open your mouth, the brick wall booms "NO ONE GETS
 THROUGH HERE, BY ORDER OF COUNT DASHING." An attempt to finish what
 you were asking is met with the same response.

 Sheesh, it's like talking to a brick... oh.

>punch wall

 Calembour! Or anywhere, for that matter.

 You casually walk onto the street when suddenly a group of people rush

>duck

 You duck, narrowly missing getting knocked in the noggin by something
 rocketing down from the sky! It crashes into the ground in front of
 you.

 "Damn, that's the third time the stock market has crashed this
 month!", says a particularly flabergasted business man as he gets up
 and walks away, shaking his head in irritation.

 Predictably, no one bothers to help you up.

 He's sporting long unwashed hair and ragged old jeans. His entire head

 The beggar mutters a few words to himself.

>examine beggar

 He's a gentleman wearing ragged clothes and sporting unkept hair. He's
 muttering the same words again and again.

 The beggar mumbles a few words to himself.

>ask beggar about beggar

 "Dumpling... doorknob... turnip... bovine... malarky..."

 Clearly he is a man of few words!

 The beggar murmurs a few words to himself.

>give words to beggar

 The beggar leaps up, filled with energy! "You possess my interminable
 gratitude, my tantalizing emancipator! I was silenced by that
 abhorrent chowderhead, Count Dashing! He discovered I harbored the
 power to topple his wall in Assassin Alley! To reciprocate, I bestow
 it unto you!"

 He hands over some words then gracefully patters out of sight.

 You can see a throne, Count Dashing and Lord Handsome here.

 "So here we are at last, Lord Handsome... face to face! But this time
 the advantage belongs to me: Count Dashing! Now that I have taken your
 voice, you cannot speak the words that can defeat me! It is time for
 me to take revenge for what you did to me... for turning my head into
 chowder!"

 Count Dashing suddenly notices your presence. "And who might you be?
 Wait... that bag... give it to me!"

 A look of desperation ripples across Lord Handsome's face as he
 notices the bag! He opens his hands towards you as if asking for
 something.

 They begin to wrestle toward you!

>deck mofo

 Sorry? It seems that's not a verb you can use.

>open bag



     *** A cat leaps out of the bag, scampering out of sight!

 ** "Thank you... fool!", the Count says in a rather evil manner which
 gives you the inkling that you may have done something wrong. "Now
 nothing can stop me from ruling Calembour!"

 ** He pumps his fist in the air, shattering the ceiling into millions
 of tiny pieces that rain to the floor! A lightning bolt shoots from
 the sky and strikes his fist, transforming it into iron which he uses
 to rule Calembour for all eternity!

 ** That wasn't a very good opening move! ***

>give bag to handsome

 His eyes widen! He knocks Count Dashing to the floor with a great
 thud, snatches and opens the bag, and yanks out a cat! He thrusts his
 hand down the feline's maw, pulling out what appears to be a human
 tongue.

 In what is a rather repulsive display, Lord Handsome sticks the tongue
 in his own mouth and swivels it around until finally he speaks.

 "It was not I who did this to you, Dashing! You know as well as I that
 actions speak louder than words, no matter how powerful those words
 may be!", the Lord booms handsomely. "You did this to yourself by
 treating all around you poorly! Act like a chowderhead and soon you
 will be percieved as one!

 "Now I will speak the word that will banish you from this land, the
 power of which can only be broken once your actions show that you have
 changed your ways!" He takes a deep breath.

 "POOTEMS!", he bellows in a very handsome manner while standing in a
 very handsome manor!

 Light retreats from the centre of the room as a wormhole rapidly takes
 shape. Count Dashing attempts to make a quick dash for freedom, only
 for an invisible force to pull him towards the now gigantic wormhole,
 its shimmering green hem caressing the ceiling.

 "I'll be back, Handsome!", the Count screams in defiance as the black
 abyss engulfs him, "I'll be back!"

 The wormhole vanishes, taking the villainous Count Dashing with it.

 Lord Handsome takes a moment to catch his breath before turning to
 you. "Oh, thank you! That cat got my tongue so long ago and I've been
 left speechless since, unable to say the magic words I possess that no
 other person in the land can say! I see my agents managed to retrieve
 it and send it off... how can I ever repay you?" He pauses briefly
 (and handsomely) to think. "Ah, I know! I'm sure your transport
 crashlanded here. Here, use my Jet Ski!"

 He brings out a single ski with a jet engine strapped to it with
 gigantic elastic bands. You fasten yourself in and (somehow safely)
 rocket home!

 The two combatants both fall toward you!

 Next to Lord Handsome, he's about as attractive as a wet sloth. Wait,
