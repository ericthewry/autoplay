 CHAPTER ONE: HAPPY FAMILY

 Wet, tired and incredibly bored.

 That just about sums up your present frame of mind. Standing in an
 almost empty churchyard in a ghostly nondescript town, all the while
 being soaked by constant rainfall, would be bad enough at the best of
 times.

 What makes it even worse is the very fact you're here. An all too often
 forgotten niece at her uncle's funeral. You're starting to wish you
 hadn't made the long journey up north after all. It's not like Uncle
 Henry actually cared about anything except his money and his ego, and
 you just wish the priest would get on with this tiresome ceremony.

 After it's finished you could go home, emptying any lingering thoughts
 of the selfish, arrogant man from your mind.

 Graveyard
 Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many
 gravestones and the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend
 in perfectly with the sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the south,
 with the promise of relatively safe territory beyond, can't begin to
 neutralise their gloomy surroundings.

 Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

 A group of mourners are gathered around the latest addition to the
 cemetery. The parish priest stands nearby, reading the last rites at a
 painfully slow pace.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

 The priest pauses for a moment before continuing with his speech.

 "There are those of us who are misguided in life, those who seek to
 inflict pain on others in order to further their own desires. Henry
 Lambert was one such person."

   a black canvas bag (which is open)

 Almost as if in reaction to the priest's condemnation it starts to rain
 slightly heavier. The crowd of people seems to be growing tired of the
 sermon and seeing the rapidly declining interest of those present, the

 a better world."

 Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many
 gravestones and the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend
 in perfectly with the sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the
 south, with the promise of relatively safe territory beyond, can't
 begin to neutralise their gloomy surroundings.

 Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

 A group of mourners are gathered around the latest addition to the
 cemetery. The parish priest stands nearby, reading the last rites at a
 painfully slow pace.

>xyzzy


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine frame


 A picture frame made out of silver. There seems to be some weird
 ancient script written on the border, but you have no idea what it
 means. The frame is currently occupied by a student's photo.

 The priest pauses for a moment before continuing with his speech.

 "There are those of us who are misguided in life, those who seek to
 inflict pain on others in order to further their own desires. Henry
 Lambert was one such person."

>examine photo


 A colour photograph, quite small. It seems to be of a student
 receiving a degree from a professor. You can hardly recognise yourself
 in that silly looking gown.

 Almost as if in reaction to the priest's condemnation it starts to
 rain slightly heavier. The crowd of people seems to be growing tired
 of the sermon and seeing the rapidly declining interest of those
 present, the priest seeks to bring the proceedings to a swift
 conclusion.

 "May he be forgiven for his sins, and may he find peace and solitude
 in a better world."

>examine hole


 Your uncle's final resting place is a simple hole in the ground. No
 decorations, no glossing over. Just a sloppily dug pit. You doubt he
 would have appreciated the ordinariness of it all. Uncle Henry was
 definitely a man in favour of the grand occasion.

 You can sense a feeling of pity in the priest's eyes as he looks
 straight at you, as if he is fully aware of the pain you have suffered
 over the past few years.

 "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Earth to earth."

>enter hole


 Entering the grave at this moment in time could hardly be recommended
 as a wise course of action.

 The priest takes one last look at the grave, making the sign of the
 cross on his chest.

 "Amen."

 The crowd of mourners begin to leave the graveyard one by one. It is
 only after they have all left that you become aware of a man loitering
 behind you. As the priest follows the crowd through the gates the man
 moves over to you, thrusting a curious envelope into your hands. In
 response to your bewilderment he can offer only a cryptic explanation.

 "It is only after their deaths that we can truly begin to appreciate
 their achievements."

>examine man


 The man returns your gaze with penetrating green eyes.

 The man paces about slowly, but shows no other signs of impatience.

>examine envelope


 A plain white envelope which to anyone else would seem so ordinary.
 But there is something about the way your name has been perfectly
 written on the front that manages to make you both fearful and curious
 about the contents.

>open envelope


 You carefully open the envelope, and with equal caution remove the
 folded letter from inside. The envelope blows away in a sudden gust of
 wind. Your hands tremble slightly as you unfold the letter. The
 signature at the bottom almost makes you tear up the letter in an
 outburst of rage, but your curiosity gets the better of you.

 The words are almost perfectly written and the flowing blue ink
 contrasts brilliantly with the bright yellow background. You begin to
 read,

 "My dear Elaine,

 It is with some regret that I look out of the back window of my flat
 across the street. The dirty run-down buildings beyond the pavement
 opposite seem almost fitting. I have become lost in the labyrinth, too
 late I have realised I had a family out there which needed more from
 me than what I gave them.

 You were always the brightest my dear. If anyone deserves my
 inheritance it is you. You have what it takes: the determination, the
 intelligence, and most importantly the finesse. But time grows short.
 I am unable to explain in detail what would undoubtedly be the coup of
 the century.

 I beg you Elaine: take up the challenge and finish my dream for me.
 You will surely appreciate the danger, the sense of adventure. Maybe
 you will even find the final secret. If you decide to follow the same
 path as me, I wish you good luck. But I must warn you, it will not be
 easy. Even the first steps will require a certain degree of
 intelligence to overcome. I know in my heart that you will succeed.

 Your dear Uncle,

 (Signed) Henry Lambert.

 PS: Remember the rhyme: One, Two,......"

 It takes a few moments to sink in. Defiance grips you, there is no way
 whatsoever you will become like him. The very idea of it is laughable.
 You, a thief? You wouldn't even know where to start. Then something
 happens. Perhaps in ten years time you will look back on this as the
 moment it all changed. Something within you makes you want to accept
 this challenge, to prove yourself. The raining seems to subside
 slightly. It looks as if the sun is about to come out from behind the
 clouds. Everything seems to be happening more slowly. The calmly
 delivered statement from the man disturbs your train of thought.

 "It's time to make the choice."

 The man tightens his long grey coat.

>talk to man


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>punch man


 The tension is high enough already.

>kiss man


 That action is surely inappropriate.

>ask man about letter


 "I am not here to answer your questions."

>look



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graveyard</span>
 Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many
 gravestones and the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend
 in perfectly with the sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the
 south, with the promise of relatively safe territory beyond, can't
 begin to neutralise their gloomy surroundings.

 A strange man stands casually nearby, carefully watching every move
 you make.

 Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

 The man paces about slowly, but shows no other signs of impatience.

>say yes


 (to the strange man)
 The man's smile gives away his reaction to your reply. He removes a
 plain wooden box from inside his coat and hands it to you.

 "Your uncle said you would accept the challenge. He was a very
 intelligent man, you will need his brains if you are to follow in his
 footsteps. The box you hold contains his legacy. It will open only
 when surrounded by the essence of life."

 The man casually walks away from the meeting as if it were
 commonplace. The sun comes out from behind the clouds and the last of
 the raindrops strikes the well worn gravestones. It is a peculiar
 feeling, the three of you being alone. You, your uncle and this
 mysterious challenge you now face.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine box


 The skillfully crafted box is quite an oddity. There are no markings
 of any kind on the surface and no apparent locking mechanism.

 You can't seem to get the box open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Recently Dug Grave</span>
 The hole in the ground has been recently dug. The lowering of your
 uncle's coffin into what seemed at the time like a bottomless pit
 remains vivid in your memory, more than can be said for the vast
 majority of the rest of the proceedings.

 Your uncle's coffin lies at the very centre of the grave, the lid shut
 tight.

>examine coffin


 After the funeral the gravediggers were more concerned about escaping
 the bad weather than in refilling the grave. It seems you aren't the
 only one who holds contempt for Henry Lambert. Recent occurrences have
 hardly changed your opinion of him. The black surface of the coffin is
 a perfect reflection of the man inside. Even the polished brass handle
 and the simple plaque on top seem dulled by his presence. As a mark of
 respect for his achievements during his fairly ambiguous occupation
 someone has tied a black ribbon to the handle of the coffin.

>open box


 You can't seem to get the box open.

>open grave


 You can't see any such thing.

>open coffin


 No matter how hard you push and shove, your uncle's coffin remains
 firmly shut.

>read plaque


 The smart black lettering on the plaque is hardly appropriate to the
 lifestyle of the man it describes.

 "Henry Charles Lambert, 1937-1997"

 The two lines of text underneath are somewhat less obvious in meaning.

 "When is "a badge" not a badge?
 That is the question."

>examine ribbon


>take ribbon
 A short piece of dark silk, nothing too remarkable about it.



 You untie the ribbon from the handle of the coffin and take it with
 you.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wear ribbon


 You can't wear that!

>examine handle


 After the funeral the gravediggers were more concerned about escaping

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Church</span>
 Stone pillars firmly hold up the ceiling and wooden pews are neatly
 aligned next to the central aisle. But it is the feeling of
 unwelcomeness that strikes you most about the place, as if you have
 crossed a significant threshold in your life. Even the statue of the
 Virgin Mary, normally associated with kind, loving feelings seems to
 follow your movements with hateful eyes.

 The church organ, so much the centre of attention on thanksgiving
 ceremonies, is located near the entrance.

>examine organ


 The organ in this church is rather strange. You are somewhat surprised
 that there only seem to be seven keys, and their modern style doesn't
 seem to fit in with the multitude of pipes rising out of the back.
 Equally oddly someone has inscribed the text "A-G" on the raised
 wooden lid.

 You play a series of notes on the church organ but given your
 substantial lack of experience at musical performances, the tune that
 emerges will never be regarded as a classic piece of art.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 The altar is made out of dark stone, it reminds you more of those used
 for human sacrifices in ancient times than the ones used in modern
 religious affairs. The sight of it makes you incredibly uncomfortable.
 The private quarters of the priest are to the west. The image of the
 Holy Crusade depicted on the stained glass window overlooking the
 altar hardly fills you with feelings of patriotism.

 On the dark stone altar is a wooden cane.

>window


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine window


 The stained glass window is old, at a rough estimate you'd say a
 couple of centuries. The window seems to glorify the very things the
 church crusades against. Images of death and destruction abound,
 composed of many shapes and colours of glass.

 A long piece of wood about a metre and a half in length, completely
 featureless apart from a narrow groove about half way along.

>take cane


 Taken.

>examine aktar


 You can't see any such thing.

>break cane


 Taking a firm hold of the wooden cane, you start to exert a pressure

 dividing point being two thirds of the way along. It didn't take much
 effort at all.

>examine altar


 The altar is nothing more than a block of dark stone covered in white
 cloth. The golden chalices and other precious ornaments have been
 sensibly removed. It would seem the priest isn't overfilled with faith
 for the general public. Some words have been boldly written on the
 front,

 "Only under the watchful eye of the demon can the deeds of sinners be
 truly repented, and only in the presence of the Lord can those sins be
 revealed."

 You find yourself in quite a small room. The light entering through a
 hole far above casts long shadows on the dusty floor. The main feature
 of the room is a large statue of some sort. You would have expected it
 to be of a holy figure given its location, but the sculpture doesn't
 even begin to resemble somebody with good intentions.

 At the foot of the statue is a deep hole, at this moment in time it is
 empty.

>examine statue


 The statue is quite tall, not to mention frightening. The sculpture
 quite clearly resembles a female pirate. Quite a shiver runs down your
 spine when you realise that in some ways you are looking at a mirror
 image of yourself. Nethertheless the statue of a villainess seems an
 odd thing to find on holy ground. The sword in the young girl's hand
 is firmly held, a patch covers one eye and the other one seems to
 watch you like a hawk does its prey.

 quite deep.

 apart from a narrow groove very close to one end.

>examine stick


 A short piece of wood about half a metre in length. It looks almost
 identical to its parent in every aspect except size.

>examine groove


 A long piece of wood about a metre in length, completely featureless
 apart from a narrow groove very close to one end.

>break stick


 Unlike the longer cane this shorter piece of wood seems to be
 unbreakable.

>break cane


 You'd better hold the wooden cane before you attempt to do that.

>take cane


 The wooden cane slides easily out of the deep hole.

>break cane


 You've already broken the wooden cane once. To do so again wouldn't
 help in the slightest.

>reforge cane


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>combine cane with stick


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>fix cane


 You would achieve nothing by this.

>put stick in groove


 The short cane fits into the groove perfectly. The two pieces of wood
 merge together so well you can't see the joint. You are left holding a
 wooden crucifix, finding it very hard to force recollections of cheap
 vampire movies from your mind.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>put cross in hole


 As the wooden crucifix slides into the deep recesses of the hole. You
 hear a faint click from the direction of the statue.

>take cross


 The wooden crucifix seems to be firmly embedded in the deep hole.
 There's no way to remove it.

>examine crucifix


 A cross that was formerly two separate pieces of wood, the crucifix
 appears as if it were fashioned from one. The joint between the two
 sections is totally invisible.

>examine statue


 The statue is quite tall, not to mention frightening. The sculpture
 quite clearly resembles a female pirate. Quite a shiver runs down your
 spine when you realise that in some ways you are looking at a mirror
 image of yourself. Nethertheless the statue of a villainess seems an
 odd thing to find on holy ground. The sword in the young girl's hand
 is firmly held, a patch covers one eye and the other one seems to
 watch you like a hawk does its prey.

>examine turn crucifix


 You can't see any such thing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Priest's Quarters</span>
 You find yourself in quite a small room. The light entering through a
 hole far above casts long shadows on the dusty floor. The main feature
 of the room is a large statue of some sort. You would have expected it
 to be of a holy figure given its location, but the sculpture doesn't
 even begin to resemble somebody with good intentions.

 At the foot of the statue is a deep hole, a wooden crucifix has been
 inserted into the depression.

 Putting things on the tall statue would achieve nothing.



 You are carrying:

 You can't wear that!



 A large bag made out of black canvas which you've always found an
 extremely convenient item to have around. There should be two leather
 straps on the back enabling you to sling the bag over your shoulder,
 but one of your flatmates recently cut them off as a rather unfunny

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 The altar is made out of dark stone, it reminds you more of those used
 for human sacrifices in ancient times than the ones used in modern
 religious affairs. The sight of it makes you incredibly uncomfortable.
 The private quarters of the priest are to the west. The image of the
 Holy Crusade depicted on the stained glass window overlooking the
 altar hardly fills you with feelings of patriotism.

>verbose


 HEIST is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long
 descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>break window


 The glass seems quite firmly fixed in place.

>examine glass window


 The stained glass window is old, at a rough estimate you'd say a
 couple of centuries. The window seems to glorify the very things the
 church crusades against. Images of death and destruction abound,
 composed of many shapes and colours of glass.

>desecrate altar


 That's not a verb I recognise.

 The altar is a huge block of stone. You can't even begin to move it.

 Futile.

>go east


 The priest's quarters are to the west and the exit from the church is
 to the south.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Church</span>
 Stone pillars firmly hold up the ceiling and wooden pews are neatly
 aligned next to the central aisle. But it is the feeling of
 unwelcomeness that strikes you most about the place, as if you have
 crossed a significant threshold in your life. Even the statue of the
 Virgin Mary, normally associated with kind, loving feelings seems to
 follow your movements with hateful eyes.

 The church organ, so much the centre of attention on thanksgiving
 ceremonies, is located near the entrance.

>examine organ


 The organ in this church is rather strange. You are somewhat surprised
 that there only seem to be seven keys, and their modern style doesn't
 seem to fit in with the multitude of pipes rising out of the back.
 Equally oddly someone has inscribed the text "A-G" on the raised
 wooden lid.

>push all keys


 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graveyard</span>
 Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many

 begin to neutralise their gloomy surroundings.

 You're on the main road on the west side of town, near a somewhat

 evidence of the growing neglect of the citizens of this once proud

 Like an unwanted child, an old fairground machine has been left
 abandoned like the factory buildings.

>examine machine


 It's one of those game machines that you used to play at fairgrounds
 when you were about six years old. Though it probably hasn't been used
 in months, you still recognise the coin collection device, the
 compartment on the front and the variety of coloured balls behind the
 glass case. The mechanical arm, a supposedly delicate instrument you
 could never get to work properly, hangs from the roof of the machine
 interior.

 north there is another example of misuse of land, and the road to town
 is to the east.

 The centre of the scrapyard is dominated by a heavy duty crane,
 seemingly now in disuse.

 This once powerful machine lies forgotten. An electromagnet once used
 to shift tons of metal hangs limply from a rusty cable. The ladder
 that provides access to the driver's cabin hardly looks secure.

 catastrophe.

 A piece of polythene that has come away from the rest of the rubbish

 heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential

 On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters

 This particular store is obviously not in the same league as the ones
 in major cities, but the owner seems to be running quite a profitable
 business. Various kinds of gold watches and pretty earrings adorn
 displays around the room, but the secure counter to one side is
 obviously designed to hold prime attractions. The jeweller must be
 getting concerned about his old age. He has taken the sensible, if
 somewhat risky, precaution of having a fire exit installed in the east
 wall.

 The fire exit is firmly closed.

 The owner of the store, a middle aged man, seems quite eager to serve
 you.

 The fire exit is normal. Everything from the opening mechanism to the

 A glass case that forms the main attraction of the jewellery store.
 The metal contacts under the cover are a give-away that the counter is
 protected by an alarm system. You'd hazard a guess that if the glass

 mechanism.

 The jeweller raises a cautionary hand, "Please, madam. Only look at my

 Clearly seeing your hostile intentions towards himself and his
 possessions, the jeweller reaches under the counter and presses a
 concealed button.

 The wailing of the police siren in the distance fills you with dread.
 The local police are so efficient that they arrive and surround the
 jewellers store within seconds. You have no alternative but to give
 yourself up. The commanding officer's expression as he places you
 under arrest is one of condemnation, "Young offenders, the scum of
 modern society."

 The cold steel of the handcuffs the police routinely attach to your
 wrists send shivers of apprehension and fear throughout your body.

 The wooden cane slides easily out of the deep hole.

 Taking a firm hold of the wooden cane, you start to exert a pressure

 dividing point being two thirds of the way along. It didn't take much
 effort at all.

 The short cane fits into the groove perfectly. The two pieces of wood

 to be the town's major tourist attraction, but the way useless bits of
 metal and plastic have been dumped here is quite appalling. To the
 north there is another example of misuse of land, and the road to town
 is to the east.

 The centre of the scrapyard is dominated by a heavy duty crane,
 seemingly now in disuse.

 After the minimum exertion of effort, one of the rungs on the ladder

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rubbish Tip</span>
 A huge heap of junk, most of it precariously balanced and ready to
 collapse at any moment. This place is an accurate symbolism of modern
 society, unpleasant but necessary. The scrapyard is to the south, and
 to the southeast is the escape route from this environmental
 catastrophe.

 A piece of polythene that has come away from the rest of the rubbish
 lies nearby.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Industrial District</span>
 At one time this part of town was flooded with factory workers and
 horse drawn carts, but now it is completely deserted. Most of the
 buildings have long gone, though one warehouse to the south is still
 standing. Huge piles of junk are visible to the west and northwest,
 evidence of the growing neglect of the citizens of this once proud
 township.

 Like an unwanted child, an old fairground machine has been left
 abandoned like the factory buildings.

>break compartment


 Your efforts to force open the compartment prove unsuccessful.

>pry compartment with bar


 You lever the iron bar into the padlock and heave. At first there
 doesn't seem to be any worthwhile result, but then without warning the
 padlock snaps off and is left hanging limply from the front of the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Street</span>
 You're on the main road on the west side of town, near a somewhat
 sinister churchyard to the north. The street continues eastwards
 towards the town centre. The southwestern view is considerably less
 pleasing to the eye, where a nasty selection of warehouses and
 abandoned factories make up the area's industrial district.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Centre</span>
 The central part of town is fairly quiet. Only the occasional
 pedestrian trudges wearily along the heavily littered pavement. While
 the main street runs from east to west, a somewhat more minor road
 heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential
 buildings.

 On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters
 and armoured glass windows evidently it's a jewellers, and the shop is
 open for business.

>se



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Side Street</span>
 The road leading between town buildings of lesser importance than the
 ones on the main street is as degraded as you might expect. The
 council has long since given up on trying to repair the many cracks on
 the pavement. The only area of interest is the fire exit leading into
 a particular establishment on the west side.

 The fire exit is firmly closed.

 From this side the fire exit justs looks like a sheet of metal. The

 As you walk along the road towards the residence where your uncle

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Estate</span>
 Chunks of rubble mark the spots where sprawling skyscrapers once
 stood. The groups of muggers that used to prey on the innocent here
 have moved on to other hunting grounds. The only residence left
 standing is a small block of flats to the north, and the darkest of
 alleyways to the northeast leads to the rear of the building.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Alleyway</span>
 If you were foolish enough to walk along this alley late at night,
 you'd probably see the unfortunates of this town asleep in damp
 cardboard boxes. Right now the alley is deserted. Far above you is a
 dirty rear window to one of the flats. Located a lot closer by on
 ground level is a council refuse bin.

>examine boxes

 A council refuse bin, used frequently by the town's underprivileged
 inhabitants. Someone has stolen the lid, and the bin is full to the

 The bin has been packed full of junk. The only thing you find of any
 potential use is a pair of surgical gloves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 With its poor lighting and wooden reception desk the entrance to this
 block of flats looks more like a cheap hotel. The elevator has long
 since fallen into disrepair. A staircase leads up to the residences of
 the people unfortunate enough to have to live in this dump.

 The building's landlady is in the middle of performing the unenviable
 task of cleaning the room.

 From the very second you enter the room, the landlady looks at you
 with distaste.

 "Another would-be souvenir hunter, eh? If it's not some copper asking
 questions about where he might have hidden 'is stuff, it's some
 blinkin' tourist lookin' for trinkets. Well, you can forget it. Go on,
 hop it. Unless you're 'ere to pay your respects, you got no business

>no


 That was a rhetorical question.

 The woman glares viciously at you, "You going to stand there all day?"

>examine woman


 An old woman in her fifties, with a look on her face you would

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Jewellers</span>
 This particular store is obviously not in the same league as the ones
 in major cities, but the owner seems to be running quite a profitable
 business. Various kinds of gold watches and pretty earrings adorn
 displays around the room, but the secure counter to one side is
 obviously designed to hold prime attractions. The jeweller must be
 getting concerned about his old age. He has taken the sensible, if
 somewhat risky, precaution of having a fire exit installed in the east
 wall.

 The fire exit is firmly closed.

 The owner of the store, a middle aged man, seems quite eager to serve
 you.

>examine case


 A glass case that forms the main attraction of the jewellery store.
 The metal contacts under the cover are a give-away that the counter is
 protected by an alarm system. You'd hazard a guess that if the glass
 were fractured in any way, it would also trigger a protective
 mechanism.

>l in case


 In the secure counter is Python's Eye.

>examine eye


 The Python's Eye, a jewel of considerable value. The way the light
 reflects off the sapphire's dodecahedral faces is quite fascinating.

>buy eye


 You'd better open the counter before you try and do that.

>open counter


 The jeweller raises a cautionary hand, "Please, madam. Only look at my
 wares, do not touch."

>examine exit


 The fire exit is normal. Everything from the opening mechanism to the
 clearly written green labelling is just as you would expect.

>read labelling


 The fire exit is normal. Everything from the opening mechanism to the
 clearly written green labelling is just as you would expect.

>open fire exit


 The jeweller watches you carefully as you fiddle with the fire exit.
 He decides not to take any chances and presses a concealed button
 underneath the counter.

 The wailing of the police siren in the distance fills you with dread.
 The local police are so efficient that they arrive and surround the
 jewellers store within seconds. You have no alternative but to give
 yourself up. The commanding officer's expression as he places you
 under arrest is one of condemnation, "Young offenders, the scum of
 modern society."

 The cold steel of the handcuffs the police routinely attach to your
 wrists send shivers of apprehension and fear throughout your body.

 With its poor lighting and wooden reception desk the entrance to this

 the people unfortunate enough to have to live in this dump.

 The building's landlady is in the middle of performing the unenviable
 task of cleaning the room.

>give flowers to lady


 The woman looks at the bunch of daffodils. For a moment you think the
 ploy might work, but then your hopes are dashed amidst arrogant
 ranting.

 "If they're for me, I don't want 'em. And if they're for him, they're
 utter garbage. He'd turn in 'is grave if he saw those, Henry would."

 The landlady seems to be getting frustrated. She paces about the room
 angrily.

 while the rest of the town is back to the west. On the southeast side
 of the street is a reminder of the area's more peaceful past, but the
 once homely Golden Lion pub was closed down years ago.

 A shady looking man leans against the park fencing, murmuring the

 You're on the main road on the west side of town, near a somewhat

 towards the town centre. The southwestern view is considerably less
 pleasing to the eye, where a nasty selection of warehouses and
 abandoned factories make up the area's industrial district.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graveyard</span>
 Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many
 gravestones and the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend
 in perfectly with the sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the
 south, with the promise of relatively safe territory beyond, can't
 begin to neutralise their gloomy surroundings.

 Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Church</span>
 Stone pillars firmly hold up the ceiling and wooden pews are neatly
 aligned next to the central aisle. But it is the feeling of
 unwelcomeness that strikes you most about the place, as if you have
 crossed a significant threshold in your life. Even the statue of the
 Virgin Mary, normally associated with kind, loving feelings seems to
 follow your movements with hateful eyes.

 The church organ, so much the centre of attention on thanksgiving
 ceremonies, is located near the entrance.

>examine organ


 The organ in this church is rather strange. You are somewhat surprised
 that there only seem to be seven keys, and their modern style doesn't
 seem to fit in with the multitude of pipes rising out of the back.
 Equally oddly someone has inscribed the text "A-G" on the raised
 wooden lid.

>press first.press second.press first.press fourth


 You press the first key, as you do so the pipes towards the rear of
 the organ shake violently, but somehow manage to stay intact. The
 sound of an incredibly low pitched note fills the room, but after a
 few seconds the noise dies away.

 The glass sphere starts to resonate to the note, vibrating with a high
 pitched ringing sound.

 You press the second key, as you do so the pipes towards the rear of
 the organ start to vibrate rapidly. The sound of a moderately low
 pitched note fills the room, but after a few seconds the noise dies
 away.

 The glass sphere starts to resonate to the note, vibrating with a high
 pitched ringing sound.

 You press the first key, as you do so the pipes towards the rear of

 the organ start to vibrate rapidly. The sound of quite a high pitched
 note fills the room, but after a few seconds the noise dies away.

 The glass sphere starts to resonate to the note, vibrating with a high
 pitched ringing sound.

>press seventh.press fifth.


 You press the seventh key, as you do so the pipes towards the rear of
 the organ shake violently, but somehow manage to stay intact. The
 sound of an ear shatteringly high pitched note fills the room, but
 after a few seconds the noise dies away.

 The glass sphere starts to resonate to the note, vibrating with a high
 pitched ringing sound.

 You press the fifth key, as you do so the pipes towards the rear of
 the organ shudder slightly. The sound of an extremely high pitched
 note fills the room, but after a few seconds the noise dies away.

 The glass sphere starts to resonate to the note, vibrating with a high

 Without warning the sphere shatters into tiny pieces of glass, leaving
 a steel key which must have been inside behind in its place.

 You find yourself in quite a small room. The light entering through a
 hole far above casts long shadows on the dusty floor. The main feature
 of the room is a large statue of some sort. You would have expected it
 to be of a holy figure given its location, but the sculpture doesn't
 even begin to resemble somebody with good intentions.

 At the foot of the statue is a deep hole, a wooden crucifix has been
 inserted into the depression.

>put red glass in eye


 The red piece of glass fits snugly into the statue's eye, as it clicks
 into place it seems to glow with an inner fire even more sinister than
 it did before. You hear a rumbling sound within the room. Fear grips
 you momentarily, you think you have angered the higher powers. Then
 you realise it's just a panel opening in one wall. Dust blows off a
 painting that hasn't felt clean air in countless decades.

 The painting has been drawn on aged canvas, but after the dust has
 blown away it looks almost as good as new. The artist was clearly
 untalented, you struggle to realise the picture shows a lighthouse
 whose yellow beam falls precisely on the peak of a distant
 mountaintop. Underneath the artwork someone has scribbled a quote,

 "Five eyes for an eye---Merciless Maria, 1698"

 church crusades against. Images of death and destruction abound,
 composed of many shapes and colours of glass.

 The altar is nothing more than a block of dark stone covered in white
 cloth. The golden chalices and other precious ornaments have been
 sensibly removed. It would seem the priest isn't overfilled with faith

 front,

 "Only under the watchful eye of the demon can the deeds of sinners be

 A picture frame made out of silver. There seems to be some weird
 ancient script written on the border, but you have no idea what it
 means. The frame is currently occupied by a student's photo.

 (first taking the silver picture frame)

 The jeweller doesn't seem at all interested in the silver picture
 frame.

 The jeweller seems absent minded for a moment as he looks out of the
 front window of his store.

>look in eye


 You find nothing of interest.

 The jeweller stamps his feet impatiently.

 something? We have a lovely range of necklaces. I'm sure we could find
 one to suit you."

 This particular store is obviously not in the same league as the ones
 in major cities, but the owner seems to be running quite a profitable
 business. Various kinds of gold watches and pretty earrings adorn
 displays around the room, but the secure counter to one side is
 obviously designed to hold prime attractions. The jeweller must be
 getting concerned about his old age. He has taken the sensible, if
 somewhat risky, precaution of having a fire exit installed in the east
 wall.

 The fire exit is firmly closed.

 The owner of the store, a middle aged man, seems quite eager to serve
 you.

 The Python's Eye, a jewel of considerable value. The way the light
 reflects off the sapphire's dodecahedral faces is quite fascinating.

 The jeweller is a middle aged man with dark hair and a trimmed
 moustache. He appears to have been in the business for quite some
 time.

 You can't go that way.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Centre</span>
 The central part of town is fairly quiet. Only the occasional
 pedestrian trudges wearily along the heavily littered pavement. While
 the main street runs from east to west, a somewhat more minor road
 heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential
 buildings.

 On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters
 and armoured glass windows evidently it's a jewellers, and the shop is
 open for business.

 A solitary car moves along the main road, disappearing out of sight to
 the west.

 You must have been the last customer, for just after you leave the
 jeweller comes out of the front door and seems to spend an age locking
 it. Obviously he prides himself on his security. Satisfied that he has
 properly checked whatever devices he has in place to prevent people
 borrowing items from his store without permission, he walks off to the
 west. The tune he hums to himself becomes gradually softer as he
 disappears from sight.

>se



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Side Street</span>
 The road leading between town buildings of lesser importance than the
 ones on the main street is as degraded as you might expect. The
 council has long since given up on trying to repair the many cracks on
 the pavement. The only area of interest is the fire exit leading into
 a particular establishment on the west side.

 The fire exit has been opened slightly.

 There are no keyholes on the fire exit. The locking mechanism is on
 the interior side of the door.

>cut case with cutter


 You remove the glass cutter and start to carve out a section of the
 counter. Almost immediately, you are rudely interrupted by the sound
 of the store's burglar alarm.

 The wailing of the police siren in the distance fills you with dread.
 The local police are so efficient that they arrive and surround the
 jewellers store within seconds. You have no alternative but to give
 yourself up. The commanding officer's expression as he places you
 under arrest is one of condemnation, "Young offenders, the scum of
 modern society."

 The cold steel of the handcuffs the police routinely attach to your

 You're on the fringes of the town. To the east the road leads off into
 the unwelcome suburbs. A gravel path leads north through parkland,
 while the rest of the town is back to the west. On the southeast side
 of the street is a reminder of the area's more peaceful past, but the
 once homely Golden Lion pub was closed down years ago.

 A shady looking man leans against the park fencing, murmuring the
 occasional word or two.

 The landlady only glances briefly at the shiny steel key, before

 interested in buying anything, just get out. Out! OUT!"

 "The door's just behind you. So flippin' well use it."

 black ribbon.

 You are carrying:
   a short length of black ribbon
   a bunch of flowers
   a boy's photo
   a mechanical arm
   a shiny steel key
   a pair of surgical gloves (being worn)
   a black canvas bag (which is open)
     a credit card
     a silver picture frame
       a student's photo
     a glass cutter
     a plain wooden box (which is open but empty)
     a perfectly written letter
     a clear piece of polythene
     a dirty coil of rope
     an iron bar

 The landlady seems to be getting frustrated. She paces about the room
 angrily.

>examine polythene


 A clear piece of polythene, the kind supermarket chains churn out in
 droves under the guise of plastic bags.

 The woman glares viciously at you, "You going to stand there all day?"

>ask landlady about henry


 "I'm not answering your questions. What are you, a reporter for some
 junky, sleazy tabloid?"

 I only understood you as far as wanting to tie the short length of
 black ribbon.

>tie ribbon to flowers


 You tie the black ribbon around the polythene. After a couple of
 attempts you manage to get it absolutely perfect.

>examine flowers


 The bunch of flowers are extremely beautiful, and their green stems
 are spotless. The golden petals are nothing short of spectacular. The
 flowers have been carefully wrapped up in a sheet of polythene, and a
 black ribbon has been impressively tied around them.

 "The door's just behind you. So flippin' well use it."

>show flowers to lady


 The speed with which the landlady snatches the bunch of flowers from

 desperately searching for a reason to reject them, but she is unable
 to find one. She grabs you by the arm like an upset mother would do
 with her baby and leads you upstairs.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landing</span>
 Bits of plaster have fallen off the walls onto the creaky wooden
 floorboards. Water drips in occasionally from tiny holes in the roof.
 Like the rest of the building, the landing should be classified a
 danger zone. Next to the door closest to the top of the stairs,
 several tokens of respect have been haphazardly arranged for the late
 occupant of the flat.

 The door to your uncle's flat is firmly closed.

 The landlady, who is extremely close behind you, points bluntly at the
 tokens of respect on the floor. She seems almost reluctant to leave
 you, but she obviously considers the threat of some poor fool stealing
 her cleaning equipment too great to ignore.

 "You got three minutes. So use 'em, then go back to whatever part of
 the world you came from."

 Something tells you that whatever you're planning, you'd better be
 quick about it.

 You can't, since the solid looking door is in the way.

 Despite that you have clearly unlocked the door, it still refuses to
 fully open. A microbe would have difficulty fitting through the tiny
 gap that runs between the door and the frame.

>open door with credit card


 It's unlocked at the moment.

>put credit card in gap


 With an amazing show of patience, you insert the credit card into the

 You push a little harder and you feel something moving behind the
 door. The entrance to your uncle's flat swings invitingly open. You
 feel quite proud of your skills at this sort of thing. Maybe you do
 have it in you to fulfil your uncle's proposed destiny.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Uncle Henry's Flat</span>
 Kindness and love always seemed totally alien to your uncle, yet the
 interior of the flat where he spent his final days feels warm and
 cosy. Now that all his belongings have been taken away, the room has
 an aura of emptiness about it. All that remain are a comfy armchair
 and a cuckoo clock on one of the walls. The front door is to the west,
 while the rest of the flat is in the opposite direction.

 The door to the flat lies invitingly open.

>examine armchair


 (the comfy armchair)
 An extremely comfortable looking armchair on wooden legs. The cushions
 decorated with images of hearts and flowers seem an unusual choice for
 your uncle. It's almost as if he left this chair here for your
 benefit.

>examine clock


 The cuckoo clock is quite a novel item. Tiny brass hands are attached
 to the front of a black face, and the numbers are engraved in silver.
 The timepiece appears to no longer be functional. The wooden hatch
 containing the cuckoo is firmly shut, the pendulum has gone and the
 clock is ominously silent.

 You find nothing of interest.

 You'd love to sit down and rest in the armchair, but you hardly have
 the time to do that right now. The landlady could come back at any

 There's nothing under the armchair but useless bits of dust and grime.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 If anything, the kitchen feels more empty than the other part of the
 flat. The only thing the removal services left in this room was a
 weird looking oven. Your uncle obviously hadn't been properly
 servicing the lights. They are clearly out of commission.

 On the east wall is the flat's rear window. From the look of it, it
 hasn't been cleaned in ages.

>examine oven


 This strange piece of equipment has the standard attachments of a
 cooking stove: a central dial, a button on either side, one red, the
 other green. Huge pipes and ducts leading out of the back, however
 suggest there might be more to the machine than at first appears. A
 nasty lever and a tiny metal tray are near the base of the oven. The
 setup is completed by a digital readout on the front, which is
 displaying the letters CHI in bold yellow computer typeface.

>clean window


 You're supposed to be a thief, not a window cleaner.

 You hear a rumbling sound as the landlady marches firmly up the
 stairs. This is quickly followed by the sound of the old woman coming
 into the room. She marches over to you, propelled by her rage at your
 deception.

 "'Ere, what you up to, then? Caught you red handed, I 'ave."

 Savouring her triumph, the landlady allows herself a brief smile with
 a touch of sadism about it. For what seems an eternity, you wait for
 the police to arrive. She never lets you out of her sight for an
 instant. When the moment finally comes, and you are led to a waiting
 patrol car, you are resigned to the fact your career is over.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 With its poor lighting and wooden reception desk the entrance to this
 block of flats looks more like a cheap hotel. The elevator has long
 since fallen into disrepair. A staircase leads up to the residences of
 the people unfortunate enough to have to live in this dump.

 The building's landlady is in the middle of performing the unenviable
 task of cleaning the room.

 The landlady looks suspiciously at the bunch of flowers, then at you.
 Her eyes narrow. You decide this might be a good time to make a quick
 exit.

 "Stay right where you are, you cunnin' little devil. I thought there
 was somethin' strange about you. Well, I gotcha!"

 With no way to escape, the police arrive swiftly and detain you. Weeks
 of sitting in a cold, cramped jail cell teach you a career in thievery
 can be brutally short.

>put flowers on tokens


 You lay the bunch of daffodils carefully amongst the other tokens of
 respect.

 You hear a rumbling sound as the landlady marches firmly up the
 stairs. Her eyes move from side to side, she takes in every minute
 detail in a matter of seconds. Finding nothing amiss, she grabs you by
 the arm and leads you downstairs and then out of the building.

 "Visiting time's over, you here me? Don't you come crawlin' back here.
 Lousy blummin' family relatives."

 You breathe a sigh of relief as the landlady trudges back into the
 building, and make a mental note to avoid bumping into her during the
 remainder of your life.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Estate</span>
 Chunks of rubble mark the spots where sprawling skyscrapers once
 stood. The groups of muggers that used to prey on the innocent here
 have moved on to other hunting grounds. The only residence left
 standing is a small block of flats to the north, and the darkest of
 alleyways to the northeast leads to the rear of the building.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Alleyway</span>
 If you were foolish enough to walk along this alley late at night,
 you'd probably see the unfortunates of this town asleep in damp
 cardboard boxes. Right now the alley is deserted. Far above you is a
 dirty rear window to one of the flats. Located a lot closer by on
 ground level is a council refuse bin.

 A rope leading up to the window ledge above hangs just within reach.

 Pausing to check nobody is around, you clamber up the rope and climb

 If anything, the kitchen feels more empty than the other part of the

 A coil of rope has been attached to the iron bar sticking out of the

 Kindness and love always seemed totally alien to your uncle, yet the
 interior of the flat where he spent his final days feels warm and
 cosy. Now that all his belongings have been taken away, the room has
 an aura of emptiness about it. All that remain are a comfy armchair
 and a cuckoo clock on one of the walls. The front door is to the west,
 while the rest of the flat is in the opposite direction.

 The door to your uncle's flat is firmly closed.

>examine chair


 An extremely comfortable looking armchair on wooden legs. The cushions
 decorated with images of hearts and flowers seem an unusual choice for

>examine clock


 The cuckoo clock is quite a novel item. Tiny brass hands are attached

 You get into the comfy armchair.

 You are somewhat startled to hear a chillingly familiar voice coming
 from somewhere in the room, feeling you have come into contact with a
 ghost. Then you realise what you are hearing is a pre-recorded
 message. You sit back and listen to your uncle's pearls of wisdom.

>listen


 You're already listening to your uncle.

 "Hello Elaine. It's been a long time. Too long in fact. When was it
 now? Ah yes, my birthday party."

>wait


 Time passes.

 You look round the room, but the source of the voice remains elusive.
 You wish your uncle would stop blabbering and get to the point.

 "I remember it as if it were yesterday, the 22nd February has never
 held more happy memories for me. I can still taste the roast chicken
 we had at the Steak House."

 The room seems to have gone colder. Your memories of the party are
 nowhere near as sweet.

>remember party


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>wait


 Time passes.

 "It is perhaps fate that today is also my birthday, and I stand here
 planning the robbery which would make me famous. But I grow tired in
 my old age, my best years are in the past."

     a perfectly written letter

 "You are young, healthy. You must complete my dream for me. Elaine,
 you must commit the crime of the century. You have to steal the Crown
 Jewels of Denario."

 The statement takes almost a minute to sink in. What he asks is surely
 impossible. The jewels are the most protected treasure in the country.
 There's no way anyone could steal them, let alone an inexperienced,
 nervous wreck of a student like yourself. You wait eagerly for a clown
 from the local rent-a-joke business to walk through the door and start
 laughing, but all thoughts of humour are evaporated by your uncle's
 remaining words.

>kick clock


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west


 You'd better get out of the armchair first.

 "You think the National Depository is impregnable but it is a
 building, and all buildings have a way in. Security systems still
 haven't matched the human mind in imagination or cleverness. We are at
 the turn of the millennium, yet that barrier remains to be surpassed.
 You will need to be prepared to succeed. That is why you will have to
 train before you can take on the challenge. But you have it within
 you. It is in the blood. To get through this you have to be part of
 us. One big loving happy family. Good luck, Elaine. And remember, I'll
 be watching."

 contemplate what you have just heard.

 The words are almost perfectly written and the flowing blue ink

 read,

 "My dear Elaine,

 It is with some regret that I look out of the back window of my flat
 across the street. The dirty run-down buildings beyond the pavement
 opposite seem almost fitting. I have become lost in the labyrinth, too
 late I have realised I had a family out there which needed more from
 me than what I gave them.

 You were always the brightest my dear. If anyone deserves my
 inheritance it is you. You have what it takes: the determination, the
 intelligence, and most importantly the finesse. But time grows short.
 I am unable to explain in detail what would undoubtedly be the coup of
 the century.

 I beg you Elaine: take up the challenge and finish my dream for me.
 You will surely appreciate the danger, the sense of adventure. Maybe
 you will even find the final secret. If you decide to follow the same
 path as me, I wish you good luck. But I must warn you, it will not be
 easy. Even the first steps will require a certain degree of
 intelligence to overcome. I know in my heart that you will succeed.

 Your dear Uncle,

 (Signed) Henry Lambert.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Memorabilia Room</span>
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to
 the centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set
 your eyes upon.

 For a moment you think you're in the Louvre, then you realise the Mona
 Lisa hanging on one of the walls is just an incredibly good replica.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You hang the silver picture frame on the metal hook. It seems almost

 ripples on the surface of your photo. You are certain you must be
 imagining things, but then you see it again. There's nothing you can
 do except look on in amazement as the photo changes. The professor
 handing you the degree now looks frighteningly similar to your uncle,
 and it no longer appears to be a degree. More like a bar of gold. And
 you're now wearing a sinister black outfit complete with balaclava
 mask.

 This is all too unreal. You turn around, but the odd experience is
 inescapable. Part of the map is illuminated: a tall glass skyscraper.
 You recognise the building just before the implications of what you
 have just seen happen become all too clear. The building is the
 National Depository, and inside it are stored the nation's proudest
 possession, the Crown Jewels of Denario.

 As you slide the boy's photo into the picture frame, you swear you see
 the image change. It now seems to be of a ship's captain standing
 proudly next to his vessel. Turning around, you see that once more the

 Turning around, you see that once more the scale model is illuminated

 in the rolling countryside, a long way out from the city centre.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Memorabilia Room</span>
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to
 the centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set

 A beam of light is illuminating one of the scale model's many

 Kindness and love always seemed totally alien to your uncle, yet the

 an aura of emptiness about it. All that remain are a comfy armchair
 and a cuckoo clock on one of the walls. The front door is to the west,
 while the rest of the flat is in the opposite direction.

 The door to your uncle's flat is firmly closed.

 A secret doorway has opened in the north wall, just underneath the
 cuckoo clock.

 You lift the latch on the rear of the door, it opens a lot more easier

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landing</span>
 Bits of plaster have fallen off the walls onto the creaky wooden
 floorboards. Water drips in occasionally from tiny holes in the roof.
 Like the rest of the building, the landing should be classified a
 danger zone. Next to the door closest to the top of the stairs,
 several tokens of respect have been haphazardly arranged for the late
 occupant of the flat.

 The door to the flat lies invitingly open.

 A frightening shuddering sound comes from somewhere above the roof.

>examine card


 (the tokens of respect)
 As to who would seriously consider sending these items in memory of
 such a man, you are completely lost. You never knew anyone he cared
 for who couldn't be likened to a modern day urban rat. It's all here
 though: bits of cheap jewellery, a couple of dubious pot plants, a
 familiar bunch of daffodils. Someone even took the trouble to send a
 card with the words "In loving memory of Henry." written on the front.

 A frightening shuddering sound comes from somewhere above the roof.

 If anything, the kitchen feels more empty than the other part of the

 weird looking oven. Your uncle obviously hadn't been properly
 servicing the lights. They are clearly out of commission.

 A coil of rope has been attached to the iron bar sticking out of the
 ledge just outside the window, providing an uncomfortable if
 reasonably safe route to the alleyway below.

 A cold breeze is entering through the open rear window.

 You start to climb down the rope, and after about a minute you reach
 the bottom and drop down carefully onto the floor of the alley.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Alleyway</span>
 If you were foolish enough to walk along this alley late at night,
 you'd probably see the unfortunates of this town asleep in damp

 dirty rear window to one of the flats. Located a lot closer by on
 ground level is a council refuse bin.

 A rope leading up to the window ledge above hangs just within reach.

 The central part of town is fairly quiet. Only the occasional

 heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential
 buildings.

 On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters
 and armoured glass windows evidently it's a jewellers, and the shop
 has closed up for the day.

 A couple of shoppers quickly make their way along the pavement, soon
 vanishing from view.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Side Street</span>
 The road leading between town buildings of lesser importance than the
 ones on the main street is as degraded as you might expect. The

 a particular establishment on the west side.

 This particular store is obviously not in the same league as the ones
 in major cities, but the owner seems to be running quite a profitable
 business. Various kinds of gold watches and pretty earrings adorn
 displays around the room, but the secure counter to one side is
 obviously designed to hold prime attractions. The jeweller must be
 getting concerned about his old age. He has taken the sensible, if
 somewhat risky, precaution of having a fire exit installed in the east
 wall.

 The fire exit is wide open.

>examine counter


 A glass case that forms the main attraction of the jewellery store.
 The metal contacts under the cover are a give-away that the counter is
 protected by an alarm system. You'd hazard a guess that if the glass
 were fractured in any way, it would also trigger a protective
 mechanism.

>look under counter


 Underneath the counter is the switch that controls the alarm
 mechanism.

>examine switch


 You see nothing special about the alarm system switch.

 In the secure counter is Python's Eye.

>examine eye


 The Python's Eye, a jewel of considerable value. The way the light
 reflects off the sapphire's dodecahedral faces is quite fascinating.

>open counter


 You carefully lift the glass cover of the counter.

 The silence in the room is shattered by the immense noise created by
 the building's burglar alarm.

 The wailing of the police siren in the distance fills you with dread.
 The local police are so efficient that they arrive and surround the
 jewellers store within seconds. You have no alternative but to give
 yourself up. The commanding officer's expression as he places you
 under arrest is one of condemnation, "Young offenders, the scum of
 modern society."

 The cold steel of the handcuffs the police routinely attach to your
 wrists send shivers of apprehension and fear throughout your body.

 once homely Golden Lion pub was closed down years ago.

 A shady looking man leans against the park fencing, murmuring the
 occasional word or two.

 The man taps the left side of his nose with one of his dirty fingers.

 The man seems fascinated by the jewel. He takes it from you and
 removes an eye lens from his scruffy jacket. After careful

 The area of the seabed in which you now find yourself is covered in
 algae coated rocks of various sizes. There are so many to the south of
 you that further progress becomes impossible. The seabed slopes
 upwards to the east, and you can see something reflecting on the sands
 to the north.

>examine rocks


 Almost every size of rock is present from tiny pebbles to huge
 boulders. You find it surprising that the algae can survive and such
 depths and with so little light.

 Underneath one of the rocks you think you notice something of

 Your sonar seems to be indicating the object is moving towards you

 Moving one of the smaller rocks aside, you uncover a passage leading

 Perhaps the purpose of this area was for storage, that would at least
 explain the presence of the reinforced packing crate at the far end of
 the cavern.

 You see something pass by on the seabed above. Your sonar indicates

 You plunge into the black ocean waters. The weight of the diving suit

 see a thing, and fear begins to take over. You are starting to find it
 difficult to breathe, when the suit's external lights and life support

 The thick muscled guard lies unconscious in the middle of the

>search guard


 You've knocked the guard out cold. He doesn't look anywhere near as
 tough now, especially in his childish teddy bear boxer shorts. Now
 that you have removed his uniform, you notice a digital wristwatch on
 his right arm that was previously hidden from view.

>take boxers

 Taking those off the guard would be rather rude.

 A digital wristwatch on a leather strap, the only visible control

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 Compared with the well lit military complex to the north of you, the
 area in which you find yourself is pitch black. Thick bushes make up
 the main source of vegetation in the lightly forested area. The
 occasional ray of moonlight which penetrates the clouds does nothing
 except cast long shadows. The landing area and the ocean are back to
 the northwest.

 The thick muscled guard lies unconscious in the middle of the

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outer Perimeter</span>
 The south side of the military installation is extremely well
 defended. Tall watchtowers overlooking the main entrance scan the open
 ground with powerful searchlights. Silhouettes of guards can be seen
 walking along the outer wall, with the latest models of murderous
 weaponry slung over their shoulders.

 You walk boldly in the direction of the military complex. One of the
 searchlights catches you in its glare. The military uniform seems to
 have deceived the guards, and you pass through the entrance unharmed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Military Compound</span>
 You're right in the heart of the military complex. Soldiers and
 vehicles pass you by with alarming frequency. Tall watchtowers guard
 the south entrance, and the ground is completely open leaving you
 nowhere to hide. The inner perimeter is to the north, while a small
 concrete building is on the east side of the compound.

 Your way in to the building is barred by a security door marked "Power
 Room."

>pour liquid in slot


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>put liquid in slot


 You pour the nasty green liquid from the sampling device onto the
 narrow card slot. Luckily, the soldiers patrolling the base haven't
 noticed you yet. Whatever the stuff in the sampler was it's very
 powerful, as it only takes a few moments to melt right through the
 security door. Your brief excursion into the world of chemistry seems

 the effectiveness of other security measures.

 The most obvious of these is a chain link fence mounted with barbed
 wire. It's easy to see why the soldiers put great faith in this means
 of preventing a security breach.

>cut fence


 Using the wire cutters, you cut a fair sized hole in the fencing.

 The very instant you touch the fence, millions of volts channel
 themselves through you into the ground. Smoke comes from your army

 size of a standard plug socket. On the lid there is a voice activated
 detector.

>open box


 You open the black plastic box, revealing a hollow metallic triangle.

>examine triangle


 It's a hollow triangle made of silver. Quite shiny, and for some
 reason it feels far more precious than it actually looks.

>take triangle


 As soon as you come into contact with the hollow metallic triangle,
 you feel this particular stage of your career has reached its climax.
 You are done here, and you feel you must return to a more familiar
 place to continue your task. Somewhere in your mind you know what you
 must do to continue, but you can't quite remember what.

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>kiss triangle


 You hold the hollow metallic triangle to your lips and give it a long
 kiss. You feel as though you have just passed a major stage in your
 career.

 Your surroundings seem to become blurred once more. There is sudden
 glare of light which forces you to shut your eyes. When you open them
 again, you see you have returned to your uncle's memorabilia room. The
 whole episode seems like a dream, except you are still carrying a
 certain incriminating metal shape. As you watch, the medal's photo
 sets on fire and burns to ashes in a matter of seconds, leaving the
 silver picture frame empty.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Memorabilia Room</span>
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to
 the centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set
 your eyes upon.

 The once immortalised replica of the Mona Lisa lies face upwards on
 the floor. A silver picture frame hangs in its place.

     a glass cutter
     a plain wooden box (which is open but empty)
     a perfectly written letter
   a hollow silver triangle
   a pair of surgical gloves (being worn)

>put statue in frame


 As you slide the statue's photo into the picture frame, you swear you
 see the image change. It now seems to be of a tour guide wearing a
 silly uniform and carrying a clipboard. Turning around, you see that
 once more the scale model is illuminated by a beam of light. This time
 the structure highlighted is a museum of art situated on one of the
 city's main streets.

>gloat about triangle


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>play triangle


 This is no time for games.

>kiss statue


 With a high degree of self confidence, you bend forward and kiss the
 photo in the silver picture frame. Once more, you see ripples begin to
 form on the surface. The silver picture frame shines with an unnatural
 light. The room around you starts to blur. The scale model of the city
 seems to burst into life. The distinct sound of schoolchildren running
 about excitedly fills your ears. The noise is almost unbearable. The
 room seems to spin. The sheer force of what is happening becomes so
 strong you close your eyes. When you open them again, you see your
 surroundings have changed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">CHAPTER THREE: A GUARDED TOUR</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">City Street</span>
 Rush hour traffic makes its way along one of the city's main routes.
 Occasionally a mad driver exposes their head from a car window to
 shout profanities. A crowd of children has gathered around the
 entrance to an architecturally impressive building to the north. Their
 supervisor has made the mistake of leaving them unattended, paving the
 way for chaotic behaviour.

>examine children


 An innocent group of schoolchildren is next to the building's main
 entrance. They seem to be an equal mix of boys and girls and are
 playing games, all the time oblivious to the horrors of the world they
 live in.

>murder children


 They are so innocent, put such evil thoughts out of your mind.

>examine building


 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine n


 You see nothing special about the north wall.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You appear to be in a museum, whose many exhibits are advertised by
 colourful posters lining the walls. Marble pillars stretch up to the
 ceiling, on the east side is an information kiosk, and to the west is
 one of the minor exhibition areas. Most people seem to be drifting
 towards a staircase on the north side. There must be something
 important in that direction.

 A security guard is standing next to the museum's entrance. He
 occasionally looks at the alarm point half hoping for some relief from
 the boredom of his existence.

 The guard carefully observes what is happening in the room.

>examine alarm point


 A large red button connected by wires to the museum's alarm system.
 The security guard is quite some distance from it, but it's still
 within his reach in an emergency.

 The guard starts to yawn loudly, before hurriedly returning to an
 active state.

>examine guard


 The security guard is a fairly young man. It's probably just dawned on
 him that he's going to be doing this kind of work for the rest of his
 life. He's half way to ruin already. His uniform has countless
 creases, and his once proud service badge is loosely attached to his
 grey jacket like an unwanted part of his life.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Information Desk</span>
 The foreign tourist's paradise: an office set up for their so called
 benefit which is usually staffed by an irritatingly stupid clerk. Your
 memories of such places are not ones you love to recall. Being the
 target of endless sales pitches and many long afternoons spent sitting
 on an uncomfortable sofa consumed most of your time.

 Another tourist has also found his way to the information desk. This
 one seems to be very frustrated.

 You seem to have been spared the agony of a further encounter. An
 apologetic sign is on the counter next to a bowl of sweets.

 The tourist turns round to greet you as you walk over to the desk.

 "Hello there, I wish you the best of luck with these people here at
 the information booth. Their service leaves much to be desired. They
 haven't served Gordon Palmers since he's been here. And that's me if
 you didn't know already."

>take candy


 You can't see any such thing.

>take sweets


 You shamelessly take one of the sweets from the bowl. It's a pretty
 pink one that looks extremely tasty.

 The tourist decides to tell you a chunk of his life story. You give an
 appropriate nod at the right time, and eventually he decides to shut
 up.

>examine sign


 A plastic sign with bold lettering. It's some time before you realise
 what it is that strikes you as odd about it. Then you notice it's
 upside down, a further example of staff incompetence.

 "I've seen all there is to see here. Medieval junk and cheap replica
 statues from lost continents. And I'm not too impressed, what about
 tomorrow? Have you got any new stuff here at all?"

 The sign isn't really that important. You'd be better off ignoring it.

 sandals. All that's missing is a souvenir shirt. A cheap camera hangs
 loosely from a strap on his back.

 The tourist decides to tell you a chunk of his life story. You give an
 appropriate nod at the right time, and eventually he decides to shut

 A cheap tourist's camera, one of those models where you have to rely
 on automatic systems to determine the quality of your shot. This one
 has even less controls than most. Just one black button on the top and
 a slit on the rear side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Corridor</span>
 This corridor seems to give the impression it is the most trodden in
 the museum. One of the walls is dominated by paintings of all ages and
 sizes. To the east of you is a decorative red curtain, and precious
 ornaments dangle far above your head. The north end of the corridor
 opens up into an octagonal chamber, whereas the exit from the building
 is in the other direction.

>examine paintings


 Most of the paintings are works by famous artists, although one of
 them looks remarkably modern. It shows an evil-looking man with an
 electronic eye, and despite that you are sure your paths will never
 cross, you feel that this man will perform many ruthless actions in
 the near future. Underneath the painting is a plaque with writing on
 it.

 "The fire will arise, and the world will be cleansed of its
 imperfections.

        ---Gustav Ernst III."

 A highly decorative red curtain inlaid with gold strips, the type of
 thing you might expect some of royal blood to have in their lodgings.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alcove</span>
 This neglected part of the museum is quite shady. The low powered bulb
 on the ceiling hardly makes it any brighter. On the back wall of the
 alcove is one of those fancy coats of arms lords in medieval times
 used to have as their symbol.

 A suit of armour is hanging from a stand in the centre of the alcove.

>examine armour


 A full set of armour, complete with a polished breastplate, greaves,
 and a plumed helmet. A rather impressive thing to have in any museum.
 Quite why the owners decided to leave it off the main route is beyond
 your reasoning to understand.

>enter armour


 That's not something you can enter.

>wear armour


 (first taking the suit of armour)
 You reach out for the suit of armour, but intuition stops you in your
 tracks. This is too easy. There has to be some sort of security system
 protecting the armour.

 This neglected part of the museum is quite shady. The low powered bulb
 on the ceiling hardly makes it any brighter. On the back wall of the
 alcove is one of those fancy coats of arms lords in medieval times
 used to have as their symbol.

 A suit of armour is hanging from a stand in the centre of the alcove.

 You seem to have used up the camera's film, this time no photograph is
 taken.

 A light bulb on the ceiling of the alcove. The low powered

 The lightbulb would no doubt prove quite useless.

 This neglected part of the museum is quite shady. The situation has

 A suit of armour is hanging from a stand in the centre of the alcove.

 (first taking the suit of armour)
 You take the suit of armour off its stand, exposing some sort of
 detection device that was underneath.

 It's a tiny square detector that was underneath the suit of armour, it
 looks very similar to a photocell.

 You are carrying:
   a suit of armour
   a colour photograph
   a cheap camera
   a pink sweet
   a pair of surgical gloves (being worn)

 You don't see how putting the colour photograph on the detector would
 help.

 The mint has such a beautiful flavour you are almost tempted to
 swallow it whole, but you somehow manage to resist doing so. As a
 result of your cautious probing the mint seems to have become rather
 sticky.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Corridor</span>
 This corridor seems to give the impression it is the most trodden in
 the museum. One of the walls is dominated by paintings of all ages and
 sizes. To the east of you is a decorative red curtain, and precious
 ornaments dangle far above your head. The north end of the corridor
 opens up into an octagonal chamber, whereas the exit from the building
 is in the other direction.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Balcony</span>
 You are on the south side of a balcony that runs around the entirety
 of the octagonal chamber which holds the museum's prime exhibit. A
 staircase just in front of you provides access to the floor below.
 Around the rest of the balcony are other less important collections
 which can be reached to the east and west. The corridor you entered
 this chamber by is to the south.

 A museum guide is just about to do the day's final tour of the main
 exhibit.

>go east


 A crowd of tourists have gathered and seem to block your exit. You try
 to move away, but they are everywhere you turn. You seem to have been
 the unlucky one who got pushed to the front, and as a result will have
 to suffer the agony of being next to the tour guide while she drones
 on in a rather dull voice. You are one of the first people to be moved
 down the stairs as the gruelling torture commences.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Octagonal Chamber</span>
 The octagonal chamber is the room that stores the pride of the
 museum's collection. Everything considered of any value from trinkets
 of Ancient Rome, to a statue supposedly from the lost continent of
 Atlantis is present. The centrepiece is a well protected display case
 elevated on a wooden pedestal.

 A museum tour guide is conducting her final duty for the day.
 Unfortunately this involves sharing her rather boring knowledge with
 you.

 The tour guide launches into her prerehearsed speech.

 "For years this museum has prided itself on the excellence of its
 exhibits, and we have continuously striven to add only the finest of
 items to our collection."

>go east


 The only exit from here are the stairs which lead up to the south
 balcony.

 The woman pauses hoping for a round of applause, but realising she
 won't receive any she continues with her lecture.

 "Around the room you can see items from all over the world and across
 time, preserved brilliantly by our experts, and on show entirely for
 your benefit."

>applaud


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>wait


 Time passes.

 Seeing the rapidly decreasing interest of the tourists, the woman
 turns her attention to the central exhibit. She spends about five
 minutes talking about how the hollow octagon belonged to some Chinese
 emperor, and then how it was recovered from his tomb. Eventually she
 reaches a point of some interest to you: the security measures.

>wait


 Time passes.

 "Of course everything in our museum is well protected. The entire
 floor is filled with pressure pads sensitive to even the tiniest
 weight. The display case is locked by a security system to which only
 museum personnel have the code, and as a final precaution the artefact
 is protected by....."

 Rather annoyingly, the tour guide is cut off by a sudden flow of
 tourists up the stairs eager to get away from her irritatingly boring
 voice. She turns to her final potential victim, but you make some
 obscure excuse and follow the rest of the tourists upstairs.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Balcony</span>
 You are on the south side of a balcony that runs around the entirety
 of the octagonal chamber which holds the museum's prime exhibit. A
 staircase just in front of you provides access to the floor below.
 Around the rest of the balcony are other less important collections
 which can be reached to the east and west. The corridor you entered

 One of the tourists has dropped a block of vanilla ice cream at the
 top of the staircase.

>examine ice cream


 The block of ice cream is melting rapidly, if you don't find some way
 to stop it soon it will all be gone.

 The ice cream continues to melt away.

 One of the museum's guards comes up to you. Your heart rate starts to
 increase as he approaches. Just as you think the game is up, the guard
 informs you that the museum is about to close and you should leave the
 building. You make your way towards the exit as instructed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Corridor</span>
 This corridor seems to give the impression it is the most trodden in

 colourful posters lining the walls. Marble pillars stretch up to the

 one of the minor exhibition areas. Most people seem to be drifting
 towards a staircase on the north side. There must be something
 important in that direction.

 A security guard is standing next to the museum's entrance. He
 occasionally looks at the alarm point half hoping for some relief from
 the boredom of his existence.

 The museum has now ceased business for the night. A security guard
 doing the final round of his shift stops by to check the alcove. After
 convincing himself that nothing is out of place, he moves on. You
 breathe a sigh of relief but you know your job here has just begun.
 You still have a crime to commit and other dangers to overcome.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

 You're quite horrified to notice that steel shutters have been put

 present in the corridor. Shutters made of steel bars have recently
 been locked in place.

 It would appear you're not the only occupant of the balcony. You can
 see somebody on the east side who you'd better avoid.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Balcony</span>
 The west side of the balcony is somewhat bare. There aren't any
 precious exhibits here at all, just a rather pathetic wooden table and
 a brass gong the museum staff couldn't find an alternative place for.
 There is a rather interesting marble pillar on one side though,
 complete with strange Egyptian heiroglyphics.

 You find it quite odd that one section of this balcony has been
 blocked off by a length of black cordon. There doesn't seem to be a
 reason for it at all.

>examine cordon


 There's a fair bit of rope here. It's about a centimetre in diameter.

>take cordon


 Taken.

>examine gong


 A thick circular brass plate, the kind that were used to summon people
 in oriental countries, though this one doesn't come supplied with a
 mallet.

>examine table


 The wooden table is a rather shoddy item to have been placed in the
 museum's collection. The surface is rough and the legs are connected
 at funny angles.

>examine pillar


 It is only after close observation that you realise the pillar doesn't
 go all the way up to the ceiling. It's an exhibit, and judging from
 the weird markings it probably came from Egypt.

 A security control box marked "Authorised Personnel Only" is on the
 north wall.

 The night watchman has reached the west balcony.

 (the video camera)
 The video camera is the latest in security equipment. It has all the
 recent upgrades to make it a state of the art anti-burglar device. An
 indicator light at the far end is flashing on and off.

 Which do you mean, the video camera or the cheap camera?

>put photo on video camera


 You lean over and start to put the colour photograph in front of the

 You must have done something to alert the museum's security staff.
 Powerful searchlights hidden in the roof are switched on. Before you
 can escape, you are surrounded by a small army of guards in black
 uniforms. You should be more careful when trying to deceive security
 devices.

 One of the weapons on show looks like it might be more useful to you

 The security guard is a fairly young man. It's probably just dawned on
 him that he's going to be doing this kind of work for the rest of his
 life. He's half way to ruin already. His uniform has countless

 grey jacket like an unwanted part of his life.

 he's up to, and like a detective that has just cracked a difficult

 A museum guide is just about to do the day's final tour of the main
 exhibit.

 A crowd of tourists have gathered and seem to block your exit. You try
 to move away, but they are everywhere you turn. You seem to have been
 the unlucky one who got pushed to the front, and as a result will have
 to suffer the agony of being next to the tour guide while she drones
 on in a rather dull voice. You are one of the first people to be moved
 down the stairs as the gruelling torture commences.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Octagonal Chamber</span>
 The octagonal chamber is the room that stores the pride of the
 museum's collection. Everything considered of any value from trinkets
 of Ancient Rome, to a statue supposedly from the lost continent of
 Atlantis is present. The centrepiece is a well protected display case
 elevated on a wooden pedestal.

 A museum tour guide is conducting her final duty for the day.
 Unfortunately this involves sharing her rather boring knowledge with
 you.

 The tour guide launches into her prerehearsed speech.

 "For years this museum has prided itself on the excellence of its
 exhibits, and we have continuously striven to add only the finest of
 items to our collection."

>examine case


 A glass case in the centre of the room. It's on top of a wooden
 pedestal, and it contains the museum's most important exhibit.

 The woman pauses hoping for a round of applause, but realising she
 won't receive any she continues with her lecture.

 "Around the room you can see items from all over the world and across
 time, preserved brilliantly by our experts, and on show entirely for
 your benefit."

>wait


 Time passes.

 Seeing the rapidly decreasing interest of the tourists, the woman
 turns her attention to the central exhibit. She spends about five
 minutes talking about how the hollow octagon belonged to some Chinese
 emperor, and then how it was recovered from his tomb. Eventually she
 reaches a point of some interest to you: the security measures.

>wait


 Time passes.

 "Of course everything in our museum is well protected. The entire
 floor is filled with pressure pads sensitive to even the tiniest
 weight. The display case is locked by a security system to which only
 museum personnel have the code, and as a final precaution the artefact
 is protected by....."

 Rather annoyingly, the tour guide is cut off by a sudden flow of
 tourists up the stairs eager to get away from her irritatingly boring
 voice. She turns to her final potential victim, but you make some
 obscure excuse and follow the rest of the tourists upstairs.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Balcony</span>

 top of the staircase.

 Taken.

 The ice cream continues to melt away.

 One of the museum's guards comes up to you. Your heart rate starts to
 increase as he approaches. Just as you think the game is up, the guard
 informs you that the museum is about to close and you should leave the
 building. You make your way towards the exit as instructed.

 The museum has now ceased business for the night. A security guard
 doing the final round of his shift stops by to check the alcove. After
 convincing himself that nothing is out of place, he moves on. You

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Corridor</span>
 This corridor seems to give the impression it is the most trodden in
 the museum. One of the walls is dominated by paintings of all ages and
 sizes. To the east of you is a decorative red curtain, and precious
 ornaments dangle far above your head. The north end of the corridor
 opens up into an octagonal chamber, whereas the exit from the building
 is in the other direction.

 You're quite horrified to notice that steel shutters have been put
 across the south end of the corridor.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Balcony</span>
 You are on the south side of a balcony that runs around the entirety
 of the octagonal chamber which holds the museum's prime exhibit. A
 staircase just in front of you provides access to the floor below.
 Around the rest of the balcony are other less important collections
 which can be reached to the east and west. The corridor you entered
 this chamber by is to the south.

 It would appear you're not the only occupant of the balcony. You can
 see somebody on the east side who you'd better avoid.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Balcony</span>
 The west side of the balcony is somewhat bare. There aren't any
 precious exhibits here at all, just a rather pathetic wooden table and
 a brass gong the museum staff couldn't find an alternative place for.
 There is a rather interesting marble pillar on one side though,
 complete with strange Egyptian heiroglyphics.

 You find it quite odd that one section of this balcony has been
 blocked off by a length of black cordon. There doesn't seem to be a
 reason for it at all.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Balcony</span>
 The side of the room you're on now is taken up almost completely by a
 collection of weapons. Virtually everything from samurai swords to
 modern machine guns are represented in some form. There's even a
 rather sad picture of the devastation caused by the first atomic bomb,
 which brings a few sympathetic tears to your eyes.

 One of the weapons on show looks like it might be more useful to you
 than the rest, a crossbow from medieval times.

 You hear a huge commotion from the direction of the west balcony.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>take crossbow

 The balcony runs from north to south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Balcony</span>
 This end of the balcony seems to contain less in the way of exhibits
 than the rest, apparently a place more for security reasons than
 entertainment. On the edge on the platform is a video surveillance
 camera, which points directly at the wooden pedestal and display case
 in the octagonal chamber below.

 A security control box marked "Authorised Personnel Only" is on the
 north wall.

>take photo of case


 You point the camera at the glass display case and press the black

 on the back. Quite impressive these modern cameras.

>put photo on video camera


 You lean over and start to put the colour photograph in front of the
 lens.

 You must have done something to alert the museum's security staff.
 Powerful searchlights hidden in the roof are switched on. Before you
 can escape, you are surrounded by a small army of guards in black
 uniforms. You should be more careful when trying to deceive security
 devices.

 (with the crossbow)
 You take aim and fire the crossbow bolt at the wooden pedestal. It is
 little more than a second before you hear the satisfying crunch as the
 metal pierces the wood. Seeing as it is now useless you toss the
 crossbow aside. You tie one end of the black cordon around the
 balcony, and since the opposite end is still firmly attached to the
 bolt on the pedestal below, you have a user friendly alternative route
 to the display case.

>go down


 You take a firm hold of the rope and make your way slowly down to the
 wooden pedestal.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Octagonal Chamber</span>
 You are doing the thing any hopeful thief loves most. Balancing
 yourself on a wooden pedestal, surrounded by a floor filled with
 sensitive pressure pads. The object of your desires, the central glass
 display case, is within touching distance. The wooden pedestal has
 been penetrated by a crossbow bolt. Between this and the north balcony
 is a firm length of black cordon.

>examine case


 The glass display case is solidly perched on the wooden pedestal, and
 is the choice storage place for the museum's most valuable exhibit.

>examine exhibit

>look in case


 In the centre of the glass display case is a black cushion, and on top
 of that is the hollow metallic octagon you are so interested in.

>examine octagon


 It's a hollow octagon made of platinum. Quite shiny, and for some
 reason it feels far more precious than it actually looks.

>put thermos on cushion


 As your hand comes near the black cushion, your ears are almost
 shattered by a loud screeching sound. Searchlights on the roof are
 switched on, and you can see shadowy figures moving around on the
 balcony above. A cage plummets down from the ceiling, preventing you
 from making a quick escape. You should have taken more notice of the
 alarm systems present.

 You hold the hollow metallic octagon to your lips and give it a long

 career.

 Your surroundings seem to become blurred once more. There is sudden
 glare of light which forces you to shut your eyes. When you open them
 again, you see you have returned to your uncle's memorabilia room. The
 whole episode seems like a dream, except you are still carrying a
 certain incriminating metal shape. As you watch, the statue's photo
 sets on fire and burns to ashes in a matter of seconds, leaving the
 silver picture frame empty.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Memorabilia Room</span>
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to
 the centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set
 your eyes upon.

 As you slide the boy's photo into the picture frame, you swear you see
 the image change. It now seems to be of a ship's captain standing
 proudly next to his vessel. Turning around, you see that once more the
 scale model is illuminated by a beam of light. This time the structure
 highlighted is a luxurious cruise liner anchored quite some distance
 from the city.

>kiss boy


 With a high degree of self confidence, you bend forward and kiss the
 photo in the silver picture frame. Once more, you see ripples begin to
 form on the surface. The silver picture frame shines with an unnatural
 light. The room around you starts to blur. The scale model of the city
 seems to burst into life. The distinct sound of waves crashing against
 a ship's hull fills your ears. The noise is almost unbearable. The
 room seems to spin. The sheer force of what is happening becomes so
 strong you close your eyes. When you open them again, you see your
 surroundings have changed.

 A rack of well used plastic sunbeds. They're of the reclining seat

 photo in the silver picture frame. Once more, you see ripples begin to
 form on the surface. The silver picture frame shines with an unnatural
 light. The room around you starts to blur. The scale model of the city
 seems to burst into life. The distinct sound of waves crashing against
 a ship's hull fills your ears. The noise is almost unbearable. The
 room seems to spin. The sheer force of what is happening becomes so
 strong you close your eyes. When you open them again, you see your

 Memorabilia Room
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to the
 centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set
 your eyes upon.

 The once immortalised replica of the Mona Lisa lies face upwards on the
 floor. A silver picture frame hangs in its place.

>put boy in frame
 As you slide the boy's photo into the picture frame, you swear you see
 the image change. It now seems to be of a ship's captain standing
 proudly next to his vessel. Turning around, you see that once more the
 scale model is illuminated by a beam of light. This time the structure
 highlighted is a luxurious cruise liner anchored quite some distance
 from the city.

 CHAPTER FOUR: CRUISING TO SUCCESS

 Observation Deck
 You get the impression that you're on top of the world. The moonlight
 spectacularly reflects off the waves which repeatedly bash against the
 cruise liner's hull far below. To the east is a rather impressive
 looking recreation deck and swimming pool, and a well used metal
 staircase leads downwards to the main deck.

 A particular large wave crashes against the ship's hull.

 In daylight this area would be cram packed with tourists trying to get

 sunbeds awaiting the big morning rush of desperate passengers. A
 Victorian style lamppost is on the east side of the deck, near to a set
 of steps which lead to the swimming pool below.

>examine lamppost
 The black lamppost looks extremely out of place. It gives the
 impression you've gone through a timewarp to the nineteenth century, so
 much so you reassure yourself by verifying your surroundings. The
 presence of the electric lightbulb instead of its former gas equivalent
 provides the only nod in the direction of modern times.

 A rack of well used plastic sunbeds. They're of the reclining seat
 type, and the wires underneath are starting to feel the strain of
 regular usage. Judging by the number present there must be a lot of
 passengers on this vessel.

>examine wires
 The bits of wire are losing their simultaneous battles with nature and
 humanity. Many of them are starting to come loose.

 The sound of laughter from a couple of wandering passengers momentarily
 breaks the silence.

 Swimming Pool
 Decorations such as the pleasant trees can only add to the brilliance
 of the scene. The swimming pool's water is crystal clear. Illumination
 is provided by pale turquoise lights under the surface. You could stay
 here forever, if it weren't for more important issues dominating your
 thoughts.

 A rubber dinghy floats on top of the water, nearby a couple of people
 playing in the pool, making quite a bit of noise.

 The man in the pool must be a waiter. He has abandoned his uniform in
 order to pursue his love interests.

 The female part of the couple produces a ridiculously high pitched
 laugh.

>examine pool
 The swimming pool provides quite a spectacular view, but it is somewhat
 spoilt by the disruptive splashing caused by its two current
 inhabitants. They appear to be a young couple in their early twenties,
 and from what you can gather, if they weren't out in the open they'd be
 doing the most indiscreet of things.

 The couple stop their noise production. For a small amount of time a
 blanket of silence descends upon the swimming pool. Then the couple
 restart their games, once more destroying the tranquil scene.

>examine man. x woman
 The young couple seem to be enjoying themselves. The rubber dinghy
 floating in the pool seems to have been forgotten in favour of a
 different pastime.

 The couple dive under the water for a brief moment, probably performing
 all manner of violations, before returning to the surface.

 A white jacket with silver buttons and matching pants make up the

 sleeves reads "HMS Silver Dolphin", which you assume must be the name
 of the cruise liner.

 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>get uniform
 You tiptoe over to the side of the pool. The couple seem quite
 engrossed in what they are doing. However since you are plainly visible
 in the bright light coming from above, you are soon spotted by the male
 half of the couple.

 "Hey, what do you think you're doing? Get away from there!"

 You mumble your apologies and back away.

 Starboard deck
 The deck on the right hand side of the ship provides a nice view of the
 ocean on which the cruise liner so wondrously cruises along. The
 westerly breeze blowing on your face is quite refreshing. You think you
 can make out a tiny Caribbean island in the distance.

 A steel cabinet with a bright red warning sign mars the otherwise calm
 atmosphere.

 You are almost knocked over by some creature vaguely resembling a
 drunken sailor. The man chants out a few garbled verses of "Rule
 Brittania" as he makes his way along the deck, somehow managing to stay
 standing.

>hello sailor

 You insert the piece of rusty wire into the cabinet's lock and start to
 fiddle about with it. Lockpicking is far more difficult in real life
 than you might have expected from watching all those cheap movies. Just
 when you're almost ready to give up, thinking it won't be your evening,
 you hear a click from the cabinet and struggle to contain your delight
 at overcoming this obstacle.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open cabinet
 You open the emergency cabinet, revealing a can of oil and an emergency
 distress flare.

>get all from cabinet
 can of oil: Removed.
 emergency distress flare: Removed.

>examine oil
 Engine oil in a steel container. There's hardly any left but the little
 it contains could prove quite useful.

 An emergency distress flare. Just a red cylinder with an innocent

 it you'll really start off the fireworks.

 Port Deck
 You're on perhaps the only part of the ship that feels insecure. The
 shadows cast by the surrounding vessel make you feel cold and unsafe,
 and the reassuring presence of the lifebelts is shattered by the poorly
 maintained railings, supposedly designed to prevent innocent
 sleepwalkers plunging to a watery grave.

 Concerns about your well being are hardly restored by the old wooden
 lifeboat hanging limply from a pulley system. It's more resemblant of a
 disaster than the means of escape from one.

>shiver
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine railing
 The safety railings are less than adequate. Metal supports weakly hold
 them together. The white paint is starting to scrape off revealing bare
 wood underneath. These things probably haven't been replaced in years.

 The luxury cruise liner rocks slightly to and fro.

>examine lifebelts
 Hollow circles of red and white plastic, one of those items you hope
 you will never have to use in what remains of your life.

 The sound of laughter from a couple of wandering passengers momentarily
 breaks the silence.

>take lifebelt
 You can't see any such thing.

>break railing
 After application of the tiniest of forces, one of the wooden railings
 snaps away from its support and rolls onto the surface of the deck. So
 much for safety mechanisms.

 The luxury cruise liner rocks slightly to and fro.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   an emergency distress flare
   a can of oil

>get circle

>examine lifeboat
 The old wooden lifeboat looks so much out of place next to its modern
 counterpart you're almost sure it's just intended as scenery. The ropes
 and pulley that connect it to the cruise liner give the impression of a
 deadly trap awaiting unsuspecting passengers.

 The luxury cruise liner rocks slightly to and fro.

>enter lifeboat
 Blatantly without heeding any of the many unintentional warnings from
 the lifeboat's jittery movements, you reach over and climb down the
 rope.

 Lifeboat
 From the moment you set foot on the wooden planks that make up the hull
 of this barely seaworthy craft, you realise you've made a dangerous,
 perhaps fatal, mistake. Half of the nails that are supposed to hold it
 together have gone missing, and the rope that provides a lifeline to
 the cruise ship looks barely able to take your combined weights.

 A sheet of black cloth is in the lifeboat's interior. It must have once
 covered up something important, but now it lies forgotten.

 Your added momentum seems to have set the lifeboat on its final
 journey. The supporting rope becomes taut. It can only be a matter of
 seconds now before it breaks apart.

 You are almost thrown off your feet as the lifeboat lurches violently

>go up
 You hurriedly grasp the rope and start to climb. There is creaking as
 the lifeboat rocks in the breeze. You have almost reached the safety of
 the deck above, when to your horror the rope snaps in two. For what
 seems a very long time, you fall with rapidly increasing velocity. As
 you splash into the water, your head collides with what remains of the
 rescue craft. Your view fades as you sink forever beneath the waves.

 Quite an extraordinary feat of engineering. Huge sheets of metal held
 firmly in place with rivets, but they're not what's grabbing your
 attention. At first you think it can only be a trick of the light, but
 then you realise the ladder leading up the side of the ship really is
 there.

 You are almost thrown off your feet as the lifeboat lurches violently

 Your relief becomes tainted with frustration. The ladder is just out of
 reach. Thoughts race rapidly through your mind. There must be some way
 to reach it.

>jump to ladder
 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

 You give the rope holding the lifeboat in its precarious position a
 huge shove. It feels exactly like one of those fairground rides, except
 you are sure that this boat doesn't have safety features built into its
 interior.

 The lifeboat seems to steady itself, but quickly returns to its state
 of dangerous disorder.

 The boat swings from side to side, coming perilously close to the metal
 hull of the cruise liner.

 Desperately, you grab hold of the metal ladder and begin to climb. As
 you reach the surface of the deck, the lifeboat falls apart, and the
 many pieces of wood fall into the ocean below before quickly vanishing

 Lounge
 The smoking lounge is dominated by privileges for the higher classes.
 Coffee tables of the finest glass are matched by chairs crafted of
 rich, dark wood. Portholes at evenly spaced points around the room
 provide a stunning view of the surrounding ocean.

 One of the tables stands out from the rest. You suspect it may be
 because it is being used by the only other occupant of the room, a
 white haired man wearing the smartest of dinner jackets.

 On the coffee table is a bottle of champagne.

 The man stops shuffling a deck of cards he is playing with, and extends
 out a friendly hand to the empty hardwood chair opposite where he is
 sitting.

 "Please, young lady. Have a seat, I would much enjoy having some
 company for a change."

>examine man
 Quite an old man, you would guess. His white hair and matching
 moustache are the features you might expect of an officer in the army.
 He's definitely dressed for any occasion. To say the dinner jacket he
 is wearing is smart would be an understatement.

 The white haired man shuffles the deck of cards.

 Champagne in a green glass bottle. The label is quite an expensive one
 and the cork is firmly in place.

 The man leans back in the chair, keeping a watchful eye on you.

 offer.

 The white haired man shuffles the deck of cards.

 "Superb, I love spirit in a woman. Now then, let's begin."

 The man shuffles the deck of cards and then deals one face down onto
 the table.

 be easier? All you have to do is tell what suit the card belongs to.
 It's as simple as that."

 rich, dark wood. Portholes at evenly spaced points around the room
 provide a stunning view of the surrounding ocean.

 One of the tables stands out from the rest. You suspect it may be
 because it is being used by the only other occupant of the room, a
 white haired man wearing the smartest of dinner jackets.

 On the coffee table is a bottle of champagne.

 The man seems quite upset as you leave the table. He picks up the deck
 of cards and appears almost devastated by your actions.

 "You have no idea how much pain you cause me, it breaks my heart to be
 alone for the rest of the cruise."

>sit down
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>drink champagne
 The bottle isn't open.

>ask man about wager
 "Perhaps you should sit down before we discuss that."

 The man leans back in the chair, keeping a watchful eye on you.

>sit down
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>sit in chair
 You get into the hardwood chair.

 The white haired man rubs his hands together gleefully as you sit down
 in the chair.

 "So glad you could join me. Now we can have a nice pleasant
 conversation. Such a beautiful night, isn't it?"

>say yes
 (to the white haired man)
 The man seems quite bewildered, not sure at all what you're talking
 about.

>ask man about wager
 "Ah, the adventurous type. Most splendid! Tell me, would you like to
 take part in a little bet? Don't worry, I'm prepared to stack the odds
 in your favour."

 The man grips the deck of cards, eagerly awaiting your reply to his
 offer.

 The man leans back in the chair, keeping a watchful eye on you.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You get out of the hardwood chair.

 Below Decks
 With its expensive red carpenting and exotic plantlife in precious
 chamber pots, this area of the cruise ship is almost reminiscent of a
 palace. The source of some rather pleasant music appears to be the bar
 area to the east, and on the west side is a doorway leading to the
 lounge. A hatchway above leads up to the main deck, whilst a staircase
 continues downwards to the cabins below.

>go east

 Cocktail Bar
 This bar was clearly designed with the wealthy element in mind. An old
 fashioned gramaphone fills the air with timeless musical classics, and
 the stores are well stocked with fine wines from all over the world.
 The eastern end of the room is a huge dance floor, upon which smartly
 dressed couples move exquisitely back and forth.

 One of the ship's waiters must have got sloppy. A silver tray lies
 tantalisingly on the surface of the bar.

>examine tray
 A well crafted silver tray, round in shape and polished to a shine.
 Some writing has been engraved on the back, "HMS Silver Dolphin."

>take tray
 As inconspicuously as you can, you move over to the bar and add the
 tray to your collection. Nobody seems to have noticed in the slightest.

>examine gramaphone
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>dance
 (with yourself)
 If you think that'll help.

>go east

 Dance Floor
 The dance floor is made of beautifully carved wooden panels. It seems
 to be the centre of the social life of the cruise liner's passengers.
 People dance to and fro with such delightfulness you are almost tempted
 to join them. Laser lights span the entire room, coming off a spinning
 globe on the ceiling.

 One particular couple dominate the stage. The ship's captain is dancing
 with a richly dressed lady.

>examine couple
 The captain of the cruise liner is immediately identifiable. He is
 dressed in a highly attractive blue suit and golden cufflinks. His
 black hair has been meticulously combed, and he would make any girl's
 ideal date.

>dance
 What do you want to dance with?

>dance with lady
 She's definitely not your type.

>dance with captain
 It would be most impolite to interrupt the couple in the middle of
 their dancing.

 The ship's captain lifts the lady in his arms and spins her about
 before returning her to the wooden floor.

>examine globe
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine panels
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine lady
 It is little wonder the ship's captain has chosen her as his date, her
 silver frock would be enough to seduce anybody. A necklace made of
 rubies and quite splendid earrings would have most men you know falling
 at her feet.

 The ship's captain lifts the lady in his arms and spins her about

 Plush Corridor
 As with the rest of the cruise liner, the outfitters have only chosen
 the most luxurious of fittings, even for the areas which only serve as
 a connection. The entire south wall is made of toughened glass. Many
 types of fish swim in harmony in the artificial ecosystem beyond. This
 particular corridor runs from east to west, passing even more
 delightful, if not exactly necessary, additions to this magnificent
 watercraft.

 Outside Cabin
 You seem to have reached the termination point of the corridor.
 Compared with the rest of the cruise ship it seems rather bare, though
 you must admit the rather impressive door to the south gives sufficient
 compensation for the lack of scenery. Some distinctly superior items of
 decoration are on show to the west.

>examine door
 The door is quite impressive. The texture of the wood fits perfectly in
 with the surroundings, while the golden handles and knocker add a touch
 of regality. You're surprised the name plate isn't made out of gold.
 The engineers opted for the more usual and practical brass. Even the
 name smacks of royalty, "Countess Venina."

>open door
 It seems to be locked.

>knock on door
 You reach up to the knocker and give it a big pull. It falls back into
 place producing a loud banging sound you are sure will wake up half of
 the previously happily sleeping passengers.

 The speed with which the door is thrown open does more than surprise
 you. A blonde haired woman carrying a cigarette holder stands in the
 doorway looking expectantly at you.

 "How dare you! You, a mere passenger, have interrupted the Countess
 Venina. I have much more important matters to attend to."

 The door is slammed shut, almost colliding with your face. It would
 seem the Countess doesn't like being disturbed.

 End Of Corridor
 The end of the corridor has a feeling of the ultimate tribute about it.
 The walls have been plastered with paintings of famous historical sea
 captains, and the Union Jack has been patriotically hung above a
 massive bronze plaque. The entire area appears to be memorial to past
 sailors, but to you it seems somewhat pitiful that it should be on
 board a boat designed for pleasure.

>read plaque
 Even despite that you have no interest in sailing, the memorial brings
 a few tears to your eyes. The Union Jack seems to give you a distant
 connection to the lost souls this part of the ship pays tribute to. The
 bronze plaque is full of names too innumberable to count, their dates
 of death ranging back to the twelfth century. At the base of the plaque
 a simple bronze urn has been laid as a final momento.

>examine urn
 A simple bronze urn, with some writing around the rim, but since it is
 in Latin you are unable to understand what it says.

>steal urn
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>get urn
 You manage to overcome your feelings of guilt, but you have to avert
 your gaze from the Union Jack as you remove the urn from its rightful
 place.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You are carrying:

   a silver tray
   a sheet of black cloth
   an emergency distress flare
   a can of oil
   a piece of rusty wire
   a pair of surgical gloves (being worn)

>put oil on wire
 Doing that would only mess things up.

>examine oil
 Engine oil in a steel container. There's hardly any left but the little
 it contains could prove quite useful.

>put oil on tray
 Doing that would only mess things up.

>look in tray
 This is no time to be admiring your reflection.

>examine cloth
 The sheet of cloth is dark. It looks rather unpleasantly similar to a
 shroud.

>tear cloth
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>wear cloth
 You can't wear that!

>examine flare
 An emergency distress flare. Just a red cylinder with an innocent
 looking black cord hanging from one end, but your guess is if you pull
 it you'll really start off the fireworks.

 You're on the main deck of the cruise liner. The ornate wooden panels
 which make up the floor are completely spotless. Minor decks are to the
 east and west. The sound of music drifts up from the hatch in the
 centre of the deck, while a staircase provides access to the
 observation deck above.

 You can see a wooden pole here.

 The sound of laughter from a couple of wandering passengers momentarily
 breaks the silence.

>take pole
 You're carrying too many things already.

 The luxury cruise liner rocks slightly to and fro.

>put flare in urn
 You put the emergency distress flare into the bronze urn.

 The sound of laughter from a couple of wandering passengers momentarily

 Observation Deck
 You get the impression that you're on top of the world. The moonlight
 spectacularly reflects off the waves which repeatedly bash against the
 cruise liner's hull far below. To the east is a rather impressive
 looking recreation deck and swimming pool, and a well used metal
 staircase leads downwards to the main deck.

>go east

 Recreation Deck
 In daylight this area would be cram packed with tourists trying to get
 a tan from the hot Caribbean sun, but now all you can see are a rack of
 sunbeds awaiting the big morning rush of desperate passengers. A
 Victorian style lamppost is on the east side of the deck, near to a set
 of steps which lead to the swimming pool below.

 The sound of laughter from a couple of wandering passengers momentarily
 breaks the silence.

>put shroud on lamp
 Making sure that nobody is around, you throw the black cloth on top of
 the lamppost. Your shot is a good one, and the cloth is equally
 impressive at cutting out the powerful glare provided by modern
 lighting.

 The sound of laughter from a couple of wandering passengers momentarily
 breaks the silence.

>go down

 Swimming Pool
 Decorations such as the pleasant trees can only add to the brilliance
 of the scene. The swimming pool's water is crystal clear. Illumination
 is provided by pale turquoise lights under the surface. You could stay
 here forever, if it weren't for more important issues dominating your
 thoughts.

 A rubber dinghy floats on top of the water, nearby a couple of people
 playing in the pool, making quite a bit of noise.

 The man in the pool must be a waiter. He has abandoned his uniform in
 order to pursue his love interests.

 The couple stop their noise production. For a small amount of time a
 blanket of silence descends upon the swimming pool. Then the couple
 restart their games, once more destroying the tranquil scene.

>get suit
 You can't see any such thing.

>get uniform
 You tiptoe over to the side of the pool. The couple seem quite
 engrossed in what they are doing. However since you are plainly visible
 even in the dim turquoise light coming from the bottom of the swimming
 pool, you are soon spotted by the male half of the couple.

 "Hey, what do you think you're doing? Get away from there!"

 You mumble your apologies and back away.

 The female part of the couple produces a ridiculously high pitched
 laugh.

>take uniform with pole
 You get as far back as you can from the swimming pool and keeping a
 watchful eye on the couple, you extend the pole in the direction of the
 uniform, and after a few unsuccessful attempts you manage to snag the
 metal bit on the uniform and pull it away from the side of the pool.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>wear uniform

 Somehow you don't fancy getting changed while other people are present.

 The couple dive under the water for a brief moment, probably performing
 all manner of violations, before returning to the surface.

 of steps which lead to the swimming pool below.

 Somebody has done a rather good job at blocking out the light from the
 Victorian lamppost. The method of throwing the sheet of black cloth
 over its metal brother is crude yet effective.

>wear uniform
 You get into the waiter's uniform, and to your surprise it fits
 perfectly. You just hope none of the other waiters stop to ask you any
 difficult questions.

 As good-looking as ever.

 You're on perhaps the only part of the ship that feels insecure. The

 You reach up to the knocker and give it a big pull. It falls back into

 the previously happily sleeping passengers.

 The speed with which the door is thrown open does more than surprise
 you. A blonde haired woman carrying a cigarette holder stands in the
 doorway looking expectantly at you.

 You hold out the bottle of champagne to her. For some reason she seems
 furious, her fingers trembling with rage as she points at the bottle.

 "What is this? You come here and wave this thing in my face! And you
 expect me to tolerate your ignorance! How dare you! HOW DARE YOU!!
 Champagne is a delicacy, and must be properly served. See to it!"

 The Countess terminates the conversation by slamming the door shut.

 manner."

 Fearful of the consequences if you weren't to respond to her wishes,
 you walk straight into the cabin.

 First Class Cabin
 You can tell right away that this cabin belongs to the fussy Countess.
 The four poster bed covered in gold inlaid sheets suggests the
 nobility, the rope used to call servants the arrogance of such a woman.
 On the east side is the bathroom. The door to the cabin is to the
 north.

 The cabin's wardrobe is just near the bed, a further luxury the
 Countess probably barely notices exists for her wellbeing.

 The Countess walks swiftly in, considering it beneath her dignity to
 even look at you as she walks straight into the bathroom. Her
 irritating voice carries the tone of someone used to getting her way.

 "Leave the champagne on the table, then go. And don't forget to close
 the door on the way out. The draughts can be most distracting."

>put urn on table
 You put the bronze urn on the bedside table.

 You hear water splashing in the bathroom. Obviously the Countess is
 taking a shower.

 A small pine table situated next to the four poster bed. You're
 surprised it doesn't have a million drawers for the Countess' little
 amusements. In fact, it doesn't have a single one.

 The Countess makes an incredibly bad attempt at singing what's supposed
 to be a musical tune.

>hide under bed
 You decide to conceal yourself under the Countess' sleeping place.
 Shortly afterwards the woman in question ceases her bathroom
 activities, and you you see her feet moving in the direction of the
 bed. There is a big bump from above as the Countess climbs onto her
 bed. You wait for quite a while, before considering it safe to emerge
 from hiding. As you slide out from underneath the bed, you are greeted
 by the smiling face of one of the ship's officers. Desperately you try
 to think of a means of escape more original than kneeing him in the
 groin. Your mind is still working on it when his fist connects with
 your face. Your lights and your career fall into a long, uncomfortable
 sleep.

 Shortly afterwards the woman in question ceases her bathroom
 activities, and you you see her feet moving in the direction of the
 bed. There is a big bump from above as the Countess climbs onto her
 bed. You hold your breath, hoping the Countess doesn't realise you are
 violating her privacy. After a while you hear a strange noise, you are
 curious as to what it could be. Emerging from hiding, you immediately
 see the answer. The Countess is asleep, making strange snoring noises.

 Strange snoring sounds come from the direction of the Countess' bed.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open wardrobe
 Taking care to check the Countess is still fast asleep you reach for
 the wardrobe and start to open it. You are startled by the creaking
 sound that comes from one of the hinges. Fortunately the amount of
 noise doesn't seem to have roused the Countess from her sleep.

 Strange snoring sounds come from the direction of the Countess' bed.

>open wardrobe
 Foolishly persisting with trying to open the wardrobe, this time the
 hinges creak more loudly. A yawning sound comes from the direction of
 the bed. The Countess sits up, then she screams like you have never
 heard anyone do so before. Frantically, she clambers around the bed
 until she finds the bell rope and pulls on it repeatedly. Almost
 immediately, a bumbling servant arrives and after a brief chase around
 the room. You are detained by the liner's security guards.

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 The Countess turns over in her sleep, but still seems well out of touch
 with reality.

>go north
 As you step in the direction of the door, a slight draught
 inconveniently disturbs the Countess. She sits up and takes one look at
 the open door, then another one at you. She opens her mouth as if
 puzzling over the situation, before yelling at the top of her voice for
 help. She fumbles around on her bedside table for some long lost
 servant calling mechanism before turning her efforts to the rope next
 to the bed. You are arrested by the liner's security shortly
 afterwards. Your discretion leaves much to be desired.

 You can't reach the knocker since the door is closed, and your efforts

>open door
 As you open the door, there seems to be slight alteration in the room's
 air currents. The countess yawns quietly, looking ready to wake up, but
 thankfully settles back into a deep slumber.

>knock on door
 You reach up to the knocker and give it a big pull. It falls back into
 place producing a loud banging sound you are sure will wake up half of
 the previously happily sleeping passengers.

 The noise seems to have woken the Countess. She rubs her eyes and sits
 up on the bed. "What are you doing? You have no right to be in here.
 Leave immediately, I may send for you in the morning."

 You take your leave at this point. The door is closed and locked behind
 you. Hopefully by the morning, you will be very far from here.

 Outside Cabin
 You seem to have reached the termination point of the corridor.
 Compared with the rest of the cruise ship it seems rather bare, though
 you must admit the rather impressive door to the south gives sufficient
 compensation for the lack of scenery. Some distinctly superior items of
 decoration are on show to the west.

 Plush Corridor
 As with the rest of the cruise liner, the outfitters have only chosen
 the most luxurious of fittings, even for the areas which only serve as
 a connection. The entire south wall is made of toughened glass. Many
 types of fish swim in harmony in the artificial ecosystem beyond. This
 particular corridor runs from east to west, passing even more
 delightful, if not exactly necessary, additions to this magnificent
 watercraft.

>go up

 Below Decks
 With its expensive red carpenting and exotic plantlife in precious
 chamber pots, this area of the cruise ship is almost reminiscent of a
 palace. The source of some rather pleasant music appears to be the bar
 area to the east, and on the west side is a doorway leading to the
 lounge. A hatchway above leads up to the main deck, whilst a staircase
 continues downwards to the cabins below.

 Cocktail Bar
 This bar was clearly designed with the wealthy element in mind. An old

 the stores are well stocked with fine wines from all over the world.
 The eastern end of the room is a huge dance floor, upon which smartly
 dressed couples move exquisitely back and forth.

>go east

 Dance Floor
 The dance floor is made of beautifully carved wooden panels. It seems
 to be the centre of the social life of the cruise liner's passengers.
 People dance to and fro with such delightfulness you are almost tempted
 to join them. Laser lights span the entire room, coming off a spinning
 globe on the ceiling.

 One particular couple dominate the stage. The ship's captain is dancing
 with a richly dressed lady.

 The captain smiles as you greet him. He takes you in his arms and his
 dancing is quite spectacular. The way he moves across the dance floor
 is both sweet and captivating. At the end of the dance he makes you an
 offer you can't refuse. You decide to go with him, and he leads you
 down what seems an endless amount of corridors before entering a
 splendid cabin. He locks the door, then turns to you.

 "Don't worry, sweetheart. We won't be disturbed."

 Captain's Cabin
 The captain of the ship has a small, cosy cabin. Murals of sea
 creatures on the ceiling provide a beautiful distraction from the more
 standard fittings. The bed looks fairly mediocre with its boring plain
 sheets, and the light blue shading of the lights is quite strange.
 Besides the cabin's main entrance to the north, there are other

 Captain's Cabin
 The captain of the ship has a small, cosy cabin. Murals of sea
 creatures on the ceiling provide a beautiful distraction from the more
 standard fittings. The bed looks fairly mediocre with its boring plain
 sheets, and the light blue shading of the lights is quite strange.
 Besides the cabin's main entrance to the north, there are other
 sections of the cabin to the southeast and southwest.

 The ship's captain has collapsed on the floor of the cabin. The glass
 of wine used to knock him out rolls around nearby.

 First Class Cabin
 You can tell right away that this cabin belongs to the fussy Countess.
 The four poster bed covered in gold inlaid sheets suggests the
 nobility, the rope used to call servants the arrogance of such a woman.
 On the east side is the bathroom. The door to the cabin is to the
 north.

 The cabin's wardrobe is just near the bed, a further luxury the
 Countess probably barely notices exists for her wellbeing.

>close door
 You close the impressive cabin door.

>hide under bed
 You decide to conceal yourself under the Countess' sleeping place.
 Shortly afterwards the woman in question ceases her bathroom
 activities, and you you see her feet moving in the direction of the
 bed. When the screaming starts you think that a mass murder has taken
 place somewhere on the cruise liner, but you later discover it's the
 Countess grumbling about her precious champagne. You are soon
 discovered and placed in custody by one of the ship's officers, very
 much doubting whether you will be a free woman again for quite some
 time.

 Your surroundings seem to become blurred once more. There is sudden
 glare of light which forces you to shut your eyes. When you open them
 again, you see you have returned to your uncle's memorabilia room. The
 whole episode seems like a dream, except you are still carrying a
 certain incriminating metal shape. As you watch, the boy's photo sets
 on fire and burns to ashes in a matter of seconds, leaving the silver
 picture frame empty.

 Memorabilia Room
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to the
 centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set

 the scale model is illuminated by a beam of light. This time the
 structure highlighted is a tall glass skyscraper.

 photo in the silver picture frame. Once more, you see ripples begin to

 light. The noise fades quickly, and the ripples cease, leaving the room
 exactly as it was before. You feel that the greatest challenge must be

 Turning around, you see that once more the scale model is illuminated

 the rolling countryside, a long way out from the city centre.

 With a high degree of self confidence, you bend forward and kiss the

 seems to burst into life. The distinct sound of a lovely excerpt of
 classical music fills your ears. The noise is almost unbearable. The
 room seems to spin. The sheer force of what is happening becomes so
 strong you close your eyes. When you open them again, you see your
 surroundings have changed.

 CHAPTER FIVE: RENDEZVOUS

 Country Estate
 An estate in the rolling countryside, whose walls are made of the
 finest white stone, and where the natural sounds of forest creatures
 can be heard in true solitude. Whoever lives in such a place must have
 a fair bit of cash to spend. A paved stone path leads into a forested
 area to the west and there is a quiet glade to the north of you.

 The entrance to the estate is obstructed by a wooden gate in the wall.

 Forest
 In the early months of autumn, the leaves on the trees have started to
 turn brown, though some evergreens with notably large leaves stand out
 from the rest. The late evening sunset, clearly visible in the
 cloudless sky, is simply beautiful. The forest becomes impossible to
 traverse in every direction except northeast, and a paved path heads
 back to the country estate.

>examine leaves
 The evergreen leaves have a large surface area, equal in size to a
 small notepad. Some of them look loose enough to be pulled away.

 The trees rustle slightly in an almost undetectable breeze.

>take leaves
 You choose one of the more larger leaves and take it with you.

 You didn't know it was possible for a leaf to be so large. This one is
 circular in shape and has a stem running down the middle.

 Quiet Glade
 The silence in this part of the forest is similar to that used for
 oriental meditation ceremonies, both calm and relaxing. A pile of brown
 leaves has gathered in the centre of the glade, and acorns have fallen
 onto the ground from the trees above.

 A cute grey squirrel dashes about the leaves on the floor, looking
 occasionally in your direction.

 Quiet Glade
 The silence in this part of the forest is similar to that used for
 oriental meditation ceremonies, both calm and relaxing. A pile of brown

 onto the ground from the trees above.

 Forest
 In the early months of autumn, the leaves on the trees have started to

 Country Estate
 An estate in the rolling countryside, whose walls are made of the

 Rear Garden
 More often than not back gardens are an untidy mess of long grass and
 weeds, but this one is definitely an exception to that rule. Well
 trimmed hedges are in abundance, some have even been formed into
 realistic animal shapes. An impressive fountain lies eastwards from
 here, and the side of the house is to the south.

 Kitchen
 Memories of times long past when you used to be part of a caring family
 come flooding back. The smell of cooking food is just as it was in your
 mother's kitchen during those innocent early years of your life. A huge
 pot is boiling on the stove, and a table nearby is full of all the
 ingredients any possible recipe could require.

 Hanging from a hook on the ceiling is the hunk of raw meat next in line
 for the cooking pot.

 You seem to have lost your good companion of a guard dog.

 More often than not back gardens are an untidy mess of long grass and

 realistic animal shapes. An impressive fountain lies eastwards from

 The moment you enter the garden a fierce guard dog comes rushing

>put meat in fountain


 The uncooked meat makes a splash as it collides with the surface of
 the water.

 The dog leaps into the pool of water in search of food. You are quite
 touched by the death screams of the animal. It cries out to the

 electrocution comes mercifully quickly for the guard dog.

 An estate in the rolling countryside, whose walls are made of the

 a fair bit of cash to spend. A paved stone path leads into a forested

 The wooden gate in the wall has been opened.

 You can also see a circular leaf here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest</span>
 In the early months of autumn, the leaves on the trees have started to
 turn brown, though some evergreens with notably large leaves stand out
 from the rest. The late evening sunset, clearly visible in the
 cloudless sky, is simply beautiful. The forest becomes impossible to
 traverse in every direction except northeast, and a paved path heads
 back to the country estate.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quiet Glade</span>
 The silence in this part of the forest is similar to that used for
 oriental meditation ceremonies, both calm and relaxing. A pile of
 brown leaves has gathered in the centre of the glade, and acorns have
 fallen onto the ground from the trees above.

 A cute grey squirrel dashes about the leaves on the floor, looking
 occasionally in your direction.

 You open the fancy window.

 The peace of the countryside is disturbed by an alarm siren ringing
 out across the garden. A red haired woman wearing an unusual suit and
 tie is quick to arrive on the scene. You are about to give yourself
 up, when to your horror, she removes a revolver fitted with a
 silencer. She doesn't even pause to give you an explanation. All she
 does is simply pull the trigger.

 burglar alarms, you haven't set any off yet.

>throw peanut at button


 You take aim and throw the handful of peanuts at the round white
 button. Unfortunately you miss and it falls onto the floor just past
 the desk. The squirrel performs a circus class climbing act up the
 brick wall and clambers through the broken glass panel. It dives off
 the desk, gathers up some peanuts, and disappears from the room.
 Luckily for you it pressed the round white button somewhere along the

 The piano with its sheet of classical music is probably so expensive

 The perpetrator of the amputations has a sick and twisted mind.

 I have the artefact in my possession, then do it."

 The trunk of the limousine is slammed shut. You feel relieved that
 nobody notices you. After an hour long drive, the car slows down to a
 halt. You must have reached the rendezvous point.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Limousine Trunk</span>
 You're still wondering whether choosing this particular hiding place
 was a good idea, the whole inside is covered in oily rags and black
 earth. The lid of the trunk doesn't seem to be locked. Even a small
 exertion of effort should be able to shift it.

 An expensive violin has been neatly placed in the trunk.

 The car boot is opened. You see a look of surprise on the woman's face
 but her reactions are faster than yours. She empties three bullets
 into you as if it were a simple daily exercise routine. Senses play a
 vital part in your job, and you didn't take sufficient notice of them.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Limousine Trunk</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>open trunk


 You give the lid a big push, and it swings rapidly upwards. There is a
 crunching sound as it collides with the bodyguard's face, she slumps
 onto the floor outside. You climb out of the trunk. It takes a few
 moments for you eyes to adjust to new lighting conditions.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aircraft Hangar</span>
 Most of the room is open concrete. Sheets of corrugated iron have been
 left leaning against the walls. The steel doors on the east side seem
 solidly fixed in one position, and the window next to them is covered
 in dirt and grime. The limousine has been parked some distance away
 from the entrance, near a staircase which winds its way upwards to the
 roof.

 The female bodyguard has been knocked out cold, her body lies unmoving
 on the concrete floor.

 On one of the walls of the hangar is a first aid kit.

>search bodyguard


 Right now the bodyguard doesn't look too much of a threat. Her face
 and mouth have been bruised by the heavy metal trunk and she looks
 completely out of it. She's wearing an odd looking suit and tie, and
 her red hair has been fastened securely by a hairpin.

 The window isn't the type that opens.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hangar Roof</span>
 The sloping metal roof is very slippery, and it takes a lot of effort
 to maintain your balance. You have a good vantage point of the
 surrounding airfield, but the view is quite obscured by the thick
 mists which have descended. The tension you are feeling is increased
 by the nerve racking silence and darkness.

 The mists clear slightly, but they're still fairly thick.

 The silver hairpin has a very narrow needle. Other than that, nothing
 grabs your attention.

 The mists clear slightly, but they're still fairly thick.

>unscrew violin with pin


 You use the silver hairpin to open the wooden casing, and you're not
 too surprised to see a high powered sniping rifle fall out onto the
 floor.

 You notice the man in dark glasses take something from the other man
 and back away slightly.

>shoot man


 (with the high powered sniping rifle)
 You centre the crosshairs on the the head of the man in dark glasses.
 You pause momentarily hoping for an easier option, but then the
 memories of the severed fingers come hauntingly back to the forefront
 of your mind. Vengefully, you squeeze the trigger. The sound of the
 gunshot rings out across the open airfield, but for some reason you
 seem to have missed. Both of the figures below dash into the mists.
 You've lost your only chance of getting what you wanted.

 the mists. You had the chance to both make amends and commit a crime,
 but you didn't take it.

>throw key in shrub


 Which do you mean, the large iron key or the bronze key?

>iron


 You throw the large iron key into the shrubbery, it makes a fair bit
 of noise. The bodyguard moves over to investigate, vanishing out of
 sight behind the shrubbery.

>enter trunk


 With the bodyguard distracted you don't have any trouble reaching the
 trunk. You just about make it before a sinister man in dark glasses
 makes his way over to the car, you can hear him giving orders to his
 lethal assistant.

 "I want him dealt with as soon as he has made the delivery. Wait until
 I have the artefact in my possession, then do it."

 The trunk of the limousine is slammed shut. You feel relieved that
 nobody notices you. After an hour long drive, the car slows down to a
 halt. You must have reached the rendezvous point.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Limousine Trunk</span>
 You're still wondering whether choosing this particular hiding place
 was a good idea, the whole inside is covered in oily rags and black
 earth. The lid of the trunk doesn't seem to be locked. Even a small
 exertion of effort should be able to shift it.

 An expensive violin has been neatly placed in the trunk.

 The metal trunk lid doesn't seem to be a major barrier to sound. You
 hear what is going on outside quite clearly, in this case two people
 walking along a concrete floor outside.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>take violin

 The man in charge gives further instructions to his bodyguard.

 "Keep out of sight. We arranged to meet alone."

 "He will have the artifact with him, but wait until I am clear before
 you take the shot. It is not that I underestimate your accuracy, but
 it never pays to take risks."

>eat cheese


 Unable to resist the urges of your stomach, you hurriedly devour the
 entire cheese wedge. The occupants of the house probably wouldn't
 appreciate your eating manners.

 "His jet will be arriving shortly. Have a look around. Make sure we
 weren't followed. If you find anybody, get rid of them. Silently."

 You feel like you've been caught in a mousetrap, with an unseen
 predator stalking the shadows.

>inventory

   a silver tipped walking cane
   a tungsten peg

 You hear bits of scrap metal being moved aside, but the bodyguard is
 still fair distance away.

 The bodyguard seems to be getting closer.

 You hold the hollow metallic hexagon to your lips and give it a long
 kiss. You feel as though you have just passed a major stage in your
 career.

 Your surroundings seem to become blurred once more. There is sudden
 glare of light which forces you to shut your eyes. When you open them
 again, you see you have returned to your uncle's memorabilia room. The
 whole episode seems like a dream, except you are still carrying a
 certain incriminating metal shape. As you watch, the musician's photo
 sets on fire and burns to ashes in a matter of seconds, leaving the
 silver picture frame empty.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Memorabilia Room</span>
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to
 the centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set
 your eyes upon.

 The once immortalised replica of the Mona Lisa lies face upwards on
 the floor. A silver picture frame hangs in its place.

 As you slide the student's photo into the picture frame, you swear you
 see the image change. It now seems to be of a cat burglar receiving a
 bar of gold from an all too familiar man. Your face is completely
 obscured by a balaclava mask. Turning around, you see that once more
 the scale model is illuminated by a beam of light. This time the
 structure highlighted is a tall glass skyscraper.

>kiss student


 With a high degree of self confidence, you bend forward and kiss the
 photo in the silver picture frame. Once more, you see ripples begin to
 form on the surface. The silver picture frame shines with an unnatural
 light. The noise fades quickly, and the ripples cease, leaving the
 room exactly as it was before. You feel that the greatest challenge
 must be left until last, that others must first be completed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Uncle Henry's Flat</span>
 Kindness and love always seemed totally alien to your uncle, yet the
 interior of the flat where he spent his final days feels warm and
 cosy. Now that all his belongings have been taken away, the room has
 an aura of emptiness about it. All that remain are a comfy armchair
 and a cuckoo clock on one of the walls. The front door is to the west,
 while the rest of the flat is in the opposite direction.

 The door to your uncle's flat is firmly closed.

 A secret doorway has opened in the north wall, just underneath the
 cuckoo clock.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 If anything, the kitchen feels more empty than the other part of the
 flat. The only thing the removal services left in this room was a
 weird looking oven. Your uncle obviously hadn't been properly
 servicing the lights. They are clearly out of commission.

 A coil of rope has been attached to the iron bar sticking out of the
 ledge just outside the window, providing an uncomfortable if
 reasonably safe route to the alleyway below.

 A cold breeze is entering through the open rear window.

>go down


 You start to climb down the rope, and after about a minute you reach
 the bottom and drop down carefully onto the floor of the alley.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Alleyway</span>
 If you were foolish enough to walk along this alley late at night,
 you'd probably see the unfortunates of this town asleep in damp
 cardboard boxes. Right now the alley is deserted. Far above you is a
 dirty rear window to one of the flats. Located a lot closer by on
 ground level is a council refuse bin.

 A rope leading up to the window ledge above hangs just within reach.

>go south


 The front of the flat building is to the southwest.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Estate</span>
 Chunks of rubble mark the spots where sprawling skyscrapers once
 stood. The groups of muggers that used to prey on the innocent here
 have moved on to other hunting grounds. The only residence left
 standing is a small block of flats to the north, and the darkest of
 alleyways to the northeast leads to the rear of the building.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Centre</span>
 The central part of town is fairly quiet. Only the occasional
 pedestrian trudges wearily along the heavily littered pavement. While
 the main street runs from east to west, a somewhat more minor road
 heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential
 buildings.

 On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters
 and armoured glass windows evidently it's a jewellers, and the shop
 has closed up for the day.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Street</span>
 You're on the main road on the west side of town, near a somewhat
 sinister churchyard to the north. The street continues eastwards
 towards the town centre. The southwestern view is considerably less
 pleasing to the eye, where a nasty selection of warehouses and
 abandoned factories make up the area's industrial district.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Industrial District</span>
 At one time this part of town was flooded with factory workers and
 horse drawn carts, but now it is completely deserted. Most of the
 buildings have long gone, though one warehouse to the south is still
 standing. Huge piles of junk are visible to the west and northwest,
 evidence of the growing neglect of the citizens of this once proud
 township.

 Like an unwanted child, an old fairground machine has been left
 abandoned like the factory buildings.

>examine machine


 It's one of those game machines that you used to play at fairgrounds
 when you were about six years old. Though it probably hasn't been used
 in months, you still recognise the coin collection device, the
 compartment on the front and the variety of coloured balls behind the
 glass case.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scrapyard</span>
 Everything from second rate car parts to defunct vacuum cleaners, all
 stacked into makeshift piles. The local scrapyard was never designed
 to be the town's major tourist attraction, but the way useless bits of
 metal and plastic have been dumped here is quite appalling. To the
 north there is another example of misuse of land, and the road to town
 is to the east.

 The centre of the scrapyard is dominated by a heavy duty crane,
 seemingly now in disuse.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Industrial District</span>
 At one time this part of town was flooded with factory workers and
 horse drawn carts, but now it is completely deserted. Most of the
 buildings have long gone, though one warehouse to the south is still
 standing. Huge piles of junk are visible to the west and northwest,
 evidence of the growing neglect of the citizens of this once proud
 township.

 Like an unwanted child, an old fairground machine has been left

 The town is to the northeast, whilst the rest of the industrial

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Street</span>
 You're on the main road on the west side of town, near a somewhat
 sinister churchyard to the north. The street continues eastwards
 towards the town centre. The southwestern view is considerably less
 pleasing to the eye, where a nasty selection of warehouses and
 abandoned factories make up the area's industrial district.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Graveyard</span>
 Just standing here is enough to give you a shudder. The many
 gravestones and the ivy covered spire of the church to the north blend
 in perfectly with the sinister atmosphere. Even the gates to the
 south, with the promise of relatively safe territory beyond, can't
 begin to neutralise their gloomy surroundings.

 Your uncle's final resting place is marked by a hole in the ground.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Church</span>
 Stone pillars firmly hold up the ceiling and wooden pews are neatly
 aligned next to the central aisle. But it is the feeling of
 unwelcomeness that strikes you most about the place, as if you have
 crossed a significant threshold in your life. Even the statue of the
 Virgin Mary, normally associated with kind, loving feelings seems to
 follow your movements with hateful eyes.

 The church organ, so much the centre of attention on thanksgiving
 ceremonies, is located near the entrance.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
 The altar is made out of dark stone, it reminds you more of those used
 for human sacrifices in ancient times than the ones used in modern
 religious affairs. The sight of it makes you incredibly uncomfortable.
 The private quarters of the priest are to the west. The image of the
 Holy Crusade depicted on the stained glass window overlooking the
 altar hardly fills you with feelings of patriotism.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Priest's Quarters</span>
 You find yourself in quite a small room. The light entering through a
 hole far above casts long shadows on the dusty floor. The main feature
 of the room is a large statue of some sort. You would have expected it
 to be of a holy figure given its location, but the sculpture doesn't
 even begin to resemble somebody with good intentions.

 A panel has opened on one wall exposing an aged canvas painting that
 was once encased in the stonework.

 At the foot of the statue is a deep hole, a wooden crucifix has been
 inserted into the depression.

>examine cross


 A cross that was formerly two separate pieces of wood, the crucifix
 appears as if it were fashioned from one. The joint between the two
 sections is totally invisible.

>search cross


 You find nothing of interest.

>take cross


 The wooden crucifix seems to be firmly embedded in the deep hole.
 There's no way to remove it.

>push cross


 The wooden crucifix doesn't seem to move forwards or backwards.

>turn cross


 You take hold of the wooden crucifix and attempt to rotate it, you are
 quite puzzled at how easily it turns. You feel a breeze blowing on
 your face, and after a brief investigation you track the source to the
 face of the statue. The statue begins to lift slightly from the
 ground. The power of machinery driving it must be enormous. A colour
 photograph of a girl is carried by the breeze and lands near your
 feet. The statue returns to its former position and the wind ceases.

>take photo

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Town Centre</span>
 The central part of town is fairly quiet. Only the occasional
 pedestrian trudges wearily along the heavily littered pavement. While
 the main street runs from east to west, a somewhat more minor road
 heads off to the north in the direction of a set of residential
 buildings.

 On the south side of the street is a store. From the steel shutters
 and armoured glass windows evidently it's a jewellers, and the shop
 has closed up for the day.

 A solitary car moves along the main road, disappearing out of sight to
 the west.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Estate</span>
 Chunks of rubble mark the spots where sprawling skyscrapers once
 stood. The groups of muggers that used to prey on the innocent here
 have moved on to other hunting grounds. The only residence left
 standing is a small block of flats to the north, and the darkest of
 alleyways to the northeast leads to the rear of the building.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Alleyway</span>
 If you were foolish enough to walk along this alley late at night,
 you'd probably see the unfortunates of this town asleep in damp
 cardboard boxes. Right now the alley is deserted. Far above you is a
 dirty rear window to one of the flats. Located a lot closer by on
 ground level is a council refuse bin.

 A rope leading up to the window ledge above hangs just within reach.

>go up


 Pausing to check nobody is around, you clamber up the rope and climb
 through the rear window of the flat.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 If anything, the kitchen feels more empty than the other part of the
 flat. The only thing the removal services left in this room was a
 weird looking oven. Your uncle obviously hadn't been properly
 servicing the lights. They are clearly out of commission.

 A coil of rope has been attached to the iron bar sticking out of the
 ledge just outside the window, providing an uncomfortable if
 reasonably safe route to the alleyway below.

 A cold breeze is entering through the open rear window.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Uncle Henry's Flat</span>
 Kindness and love always seemed totally alien to your uncle, yet the
 interior of the flat where he spent his final days feels warm and
 cosy. Now that all his belongings have been taken away, the room has
 an aura of emptiness about it. All that remain are a comfy armchair
 and a cuckoo clock on one of the walls. The front door is to the west,
 while the rest of the flat is in the opposite direction.

 The door to your uncle's flat is firmly closed.

 A secret doorway has opened in the north wall, just underneath the
 cuckoo clock.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Memorabilia Room</span>
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to
 the centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set
 your eyes upon.

 A beam of light is illuminating one of the scale model's many
 structures: a tall glass skyscraper.

 The once immortalised replica of the Mona Lisa lies face upwards on
 the floor. A silver picture frame hangs in its place.

>take student


 The student's photo comes slides easily out of the picture frame. The
 beam of light falling on the scale model disappears.

>put girl in frame


 As you slide the girl's photo into the picture frame, you swear you
 see the image change. It now seems to be of a female pirate standing
 on a rocky beach, carrying a fairly menacing cutlass. Turning around,
 you see that once more the scale model is illuminated by a beam of
 light. This time the structure highlighted is a lighthouse on one of
 the city's many sandy beaches.

>kiss girl


 With a high degree of self confidence, you bend forward and kiss the
 photo in the silver picture frame. Once more, you see ripples begin to
 form on the surface. The silver picture frame shines with an unnatural
 light. The room around you starts to blur. The scale model of the city
 seems to burst into life. The distinct sound of seagulls gathering
 above coastal waters fills your ears. The noise is almost unbearable.
 The room seems to spin. The sheer force of what is happening becomes
 so strong you close your eyes. When you open them again, you see your
 surroundings have changed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clifftop</span>
 You are at the top of a short expanse of white cliffs. A narrow path
 leads down to a rocky beach below. To the north of you is a large area
 of grassland. Leading northwest is a road to more civilised territory,
 but it is what is to the east that grabs your attention. The

 to the northwest. Grasslands stretch away far to the east, but the
 west side terminates sharply at the edge of the clifftop.

 On one side of the road is an ancient relic of a vehicle. This
 particular car doesn't look like it's been used in years.

 There's no way you could get the car to start. The paintwork has

 The way the sea sweeps slowly up the sandy beaches makes you want to

 job. The beach stretches eastwards to a more sheltered area, and the
 only other way to proceed is by taking the dangerous path to the top
 of the cliffs. The sand here is far from perfect. It is full of pieces
 of rock that make it less than welcome.

 One of the pieces of rock is somewhat larger than the others, a white
 chunk of clay which is embedded in the sand near your feet.

>examine clay


 The white chunk of clay is made of the same material of the cliffs, so
 it must have broken free. It seems to be quite hard and its surface

 The view from the top of the lighthouse is unmatchable. The large

 protected the beacon has failed the test of time. A cool sea breeze

 You have to avert your gaze from the centre of the room. The massive
 electric lamp has been switched on and is producing a blinding yellow
 beam of light, which is constantly changing direction depending on
 which way the lamp is facing.

>examine lamp


 The electric lamp consists of a powerful yellow bulb in the centre of
 a curved mirror, and is attached to a movable support. The strangest
 feature about the lamp is a thin slit running along the top parallel
 to the direction of the bulb. A blinding yellow beam of light is being
 produced by the setup. It constantly changes direction as the lamp
 spins furiously.

 The magnetic compass is normally the lifesaver of any adventuring
 type, but this one is of no use whatsoever. The glass casing is
 cracked, and the metal needle seems to point in any direction except
 from north.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a curved piece of glass
   a large rock
   a transparent plastic rod
   a cracked magnetic compass
   a pair of surgical gloves (being worn)

>break compass


 In your frustration, you repeatedly bash at the glass casing of the
 compass. It soon gives in to your overwhelming force and shatters. The
 compass falls apart leaving the metal needle as the only salvageable
 part.

 The compass needle fits easily into the slit. As you slide it into

 The view from the top of the lighthouse is unmatchable. The large
 proportion of grasslands to the north and the mountains in the
 distance are clearly visible. In the opposite direction are the
 swirling seas and perilous clifftops. Most of the glass that once
 protected the beacon has failed the test of time. A cool sea breeze
 passing through the broken panes gently brushes your face.

 You have to avert your gaze from the centre of the room. The massive

 The way the sea sweeps slowly up the sandy beaches makes you want to

 protected the beacon has failed the test of time. A cool sea breeze
 passing through the broken panes gently brushes your face.

 distance are clearly visible. In the opposite direction are the
 swirling seas and perilous clifftops. Most of the glass that once
 protected the beacon has failed the test of time. A cool sea breeze
 passing through the broken panes gently brushes your face.

 You have to avert your gaze from the centre of the room. The massive
 electric lamp has been switched on and is producing a blinding yellow
 beam of light, which illuminates a patch of grassland to the north.

>take rock


 As you pull the chunk of clay from underneath the lamp, it starts to
 rotate at high speed once more.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lighthouse</span>
 The interior of this warning beacon is barely an improvement on the
 outside. Planks of wood that used to make up the furniture are
 scattered around the room. A spiral staircase leads up to the top of
 the building. The steps are full of cracks and little chunks of
 masonry. In one corner is a hatchway which provides a route deeper
 into the ground.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clifftop</span>
 You are at the top of a short expanse of white cliffs. A narrow path
 leads down to a rocky beach below. To the north of you is a large area
 of grassland. Leading northwest is a road to more civilised territory,
 but it is what is to the east that grabs your attention. The
 lighthouse was probably built centuries ago, but its once clean walls
 are covered in patches of black, and like the rest of this coastline,
 it is completely deserted.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 The way the sea sweeps slowly up the sandy beaches makes you want to
 sit down and relax, but there's no time for that while you're on the
 job. The beach stretches eastwards to a more sheltered area, and the
 only other way to proceed is by taking the dangerous path to the top
 of the cliffs. The sand here is far from perfect. It is full of pieces
 of rock that make it less than welcome.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sheltered Cove</span>
 This section of the beach seems to be better protected from fierce
 weather than the area to the west. The cliffs that surround you
 provide more than an ample defence against raging winds, even the
 clumps of seaweed seem totally undisturbed.

 To the north of you is a gloomy cave entrance surrounded by peculiar
 rock formations.

>break rod


 You bend the rod in two, as you do so the chemicals start to mix and
 soon afterwards they are producing a bright green glow.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cavern</span>
 Water drips from the stalactites on the roof of the cavern. Hardly any
 light penetrates from outside, meaning the cavern interior is quite a
 contrast to the outside world in both atmosphere and safety. The large
 crack which runs down one of the walls emphasises the latter point
 uncomfortably well.

 To the north of you, a waterfall enters the cavern from above. As the
 clear liquid falls into the underwater lake it splashes up with
 considerable ferocity.

 collapse into tiny pieces on the floor and a thin ray of sunlight

 covered in rust. The only part of the cutlass which has completely
 resisted corrosion is the beautifully fashioned golden handle.

 The golden handle is without doubt the most magnificent part of the
 cutlass. It feels delightfully smooth to the touch and adds a bit of

 leg has replaced one of his natural ones and one of his arms has been
 amputated.

 Merciless Maria's Tomb
 Souls of butchered victims seem to hang in the air of this place. The
 female skeleton perched on the throne in the centre of the room
 probably looks more dangerous now than she did three centuries ago.
 Instruments that she used to spread her doom, from rapiers to kegs of
 gunpowder, are stacked behind her throne.

 A tin pan hangs in front of Maria's corpse. You are suspicious it could
 be one of her murderous devices she left behind for unwary trespassers.

>examine corpse
 It is the way the skeleton simply looks ahead that is most frightening,
 as if she knows her fate and that of the rest of the world. One of her
 eyes is covered by a dusty eyepatch, and the gold ring on her
 outstretched hand gleams ever so slightly in the dim light. You can
 sense her evil as if she were still alive, from the way her mouth is
 shaped it appears she is laughing at your predicament.

 As soon as the tin pan is emptied, the rope holding it is pulled
 upwards by a hidden counterweight, setting a sequence of deadly events
 in motion.

 You suddenly become aware of a trail of fire which has just started,
 and before you can react, it reaches the kegs of gunpowder. The
 resulting explosion is enough to severely disturb the countryside
 surrounding the caverns and to bury you underneath tons of rock.

 The tin pan appears to stabilise for a short period, then the rope

 You suddenly become aware of a trail of fire which has just started,

 It is the way the skeleton simply looks ahead that is most frightening,
 as if she knows her fate and that of the rest of the world. One of her
 eyes is covered by a dusty eyepatch, and the gold ring on her
 outstretched hand gleams ever so slightly in the dim light. You can
 sense her evil as if she were still alive, from the way her mouth is
 shaped it appears she is laughing at your predicament.

 Merciless Maria's Tomb
 Souls of butchered victims seem to hang in the air of this place. The
 female skeleton perched on the throne in the centre of the room
 probably looks more dangerous now than she did three centuries ago.
 Instruments that she used to spread her doom, from rapiers to kegs of
 gunpowder, are stacked behind her throne.

 A tin pan hangs in front of Maria's corpse. You are suspicious it could
 be one of her murderous devices she left behind for unwary trespassers.

 You can also see a transparent plastic rod (providing light), a curved
 piece of glass, a torn scrap of parchment and a pirate's cutlass here.

 Damp Tunnel
 The tunnel you're now standing has an even more sinister feeling than
 the cavern to the south. The floor has been dampened by the waterfall
 that kept this area a secret for uncounted decades. The north end of
 the tunnel is taken up by a heavy iron door. It has the strangest of
 contraptions on the wall next to it, some sort of wooden wheel with
 raised markings.

 Whoever built this tomb must like leaving warnings around. On the floor
 of the chamber is a human skeleton.

>go south

 Cavern
 Water drips from the stalactites on the roof of the cavern. Hardly any
 light penetrates from outside, meaning the cavern interior is quite a
 contrast to the outside world in both atmosphere and safety. The large
 crack which runs down one of the walls emphasises the latter point
 uncomfortably well.

 A secret compartment has opened up near the large crack, inside which
 is a pirate's treasure chest.

 To the north of you, a waterfall enters the cavern from above. The flow
 of water has decreased in strength slightly since your recent antics.
 Now you can make out a damp tunnel leading deeper into the cave system.

 You can also see a skeleton key here.

>go up

 Cramped Space
 The room available for movement in this part of the cavern is enough to
 even make you feel claustrophobic. Like the rest of this hellhole, the
 roof looks like it might fall in on you at any unprecedented moment.
 Some of the stalactites look very loose indeed.

 A thin ray of sunlight penetrates the roof above and falls onto the
 spot where the overhanging rock used to be.

 The river that used to supply the waterfall below has been blocked by a
 rock which used to hang over it.

>break leg on rock

 rock formations.

>kiss circle
 You hold the hollow metallic circle to your lips and give it a long

 career.

 Your surroundings seem to become blurred once more. There is sudden
 glare of light which forces you to shut your eyes. When you open them
 again, you see you have returned to your uncle's memorabilia room. The
 whole episode seems like a dream, except you are still carrying a
 certain incriminating metal shape. As you watch, the girl's photo sets
 on fire and burns to ashes in a matter of seconds, leaving the silver
 picture frame empty.

 Memorabilia Room
 This must be the room where your uncle would sit gloating over his
 triumphs. Many glass cases contain what you can only presume are his
 previous successes. These however, pale into insignificance next to the
 centrepiece of the room: a beautiful scale model of a city and its
 coastline, one of the most remarkable works of art you have ever set
 your eyes upon.

 The once immortalised replica of the Mona Lisa lies face upwards on the
 floor. A silver picture frame hangs in its place.

>put student in frame
 As you slide the student's photo into the picture frame, you swear you
 see the image change. It now seems to be of a cat burglar receiving a
 bar of gold from an all too familiar man. Your face is completely
 obscured by a balaclava mask. Turning around, you see that once more
 the scale model is illuminated by a beam of light. This time the
 structure highlighted is a tall glass skyscraper.

 With a high degree of self confidence, you bend forward and kiss the
 photo in the silver picture frame. Once more, you see ripples begin to
 form on the surface. The silver picture frame shines with an unnatural
 light. The room around you starts to become even more blurred than
 you're used to. You know the time for the greatest challenge is at
 hand. Images of your uncle flash across your mind, becoming so strong
 you have to avert your gaze. When you next look up, you see your
 surroundings have changed.

 CHAPTER SEVEN: THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN

 Abandoned Toy Factory
 This is the place where all those little toy cars and trains, the ones
 you used to enjoy playing with so much, were brought to life. It could

 Production Line
 The invention that was lethal to the human manufacturer, fully
 automated machinery, covers the entire working area and continues to
 the west. The safety glass being present is surprising. Perhaps the
 workers often got bored and developed suicidal tendencies.

 All of the machinery is controlled from one panel with rather simple
 buttons and switches.

>examine buttons
 People who work in these places must be getting more stupid by the

 Abandoned Toy Factory
 This is the place where all those little toy cars and trains, the ones
 you used to enjoy playing with so much, were brought to life. It could

 The invention that was lethal to the human manufacturer, fully

 Abandoned Toy Factory
 This is the place where all those little toy cars and trains, the ones
 you used to enjoy playing with so much, were brought to life. It could
 be hardly be compared to Santa's Grotto, but there is a certain magic
 about this place that makes you feel at home. Such a shame that the
 factory has been abandoned, and quite possibly marked for demolition.
 The supervisor's office is above you and other areas of the building

 Storeroom
 In the factory's heyday the shelves would have been filled to the brim
 with toy racing cars and lego sets. Now they're depressingly barren and
 empty. The huge forklift that used to shift crates by the ton has
 fallen into a sorry state of disrepair.

 The cardboard box has been moved to one side, bringing a previously

 The chemicals dissolved in the water illuminate the sewer tunnels with
 an eerie green light. It's all too easy to get lost in the maze of

 leading up and down from here.

 The sewer tunnels terminate at this point, a rather dull section of

 You boldly step through the grey doorway, and suddenly everything is

 The sewer tunnels terminate at this point, a rather dull section of
 cracked red brickwork. The water seems to have dried up too. The floor
 of the tunnel isn't even damp. A set of stairs lead up to the outer

 you want to pay it a visit.

 Moving some of the bricks has brought a square plug socket to light.

 Information Superhighway
 The whole world looks to have gone mad. Nothing around you can be
 described as a solid object. Towers colured black and grey stretch
 upwards to infinity. Tubes of glass run between them carrying
 information at lightning speeds. Just above you is an abstract grey
 doorway.

 A curious looking brown tetrahedron circles around your head,
 constantly spinning and changing direction.

>enter tubes
 You stand near one of the tubes, and an irresistible force pulls you
 inside. The world outside flashes by, it seems to take forever before
 you see the end approaching. The tube you are in comes out into a white
 walled cubical chamber.

 Cubical Chamber
 The walls of the chamber are a brilliant white. Quite where the
 illumination is coming from you have no idea. The only item inside the
 room is a bust on a stone pedestal. The grey doorway seems to have
 followed you as well, providing a thoughtful escape route.

 The bust is a vague figure of a head on a stone column, at the foot of

 Car Park
 The finest example of modern architecture, an ugly mass of concrete and
 metal which dominates the skyline. Vehicles of all shapes and sizes are
 parked in ever decreasing marked spaces. The guarded entrance to this
 nightmare scenario is to the west. The object of your undivided
 attention has to be the building on the east side. The tall glass
 skyscraper is unmistakably recognizable as the National Depository.

 A red sports car has been driven into a nearby parking space.

 National Depository
 This is it. The building that holds the nation's most prized
 possessions. Security guards patrol the spotless floors, their eagle
 eyes never missing a thing. On the far side of the room to the entrance
 is an elevator which leads down to the vault. Just in front of it is a
 secretary who is ruthlessly checking people's credentials.

>show id
 (to the secretary)
 The secretary takes the identity card from you and whips it through a
 scanning device. The tension builds as you wait for the judgement of a
 machine.

 The secretary nods briefly, and the tension disappears to be replaced
 by excitement. The elevator doors open and you step inside. You curse
 your misfortune as a depository management type gets in with you. Just
 before the doors close you see an element of suspicion in the
 secretary's actions. She starts to initiate a further check on you.
 Sooner or later she's sure to find something wrong. It's time to put
 your plan into action.

 Elevator
 You're in the elevator which leads from the ground level of the
 depository to the vault floor. The walls are shiny and you can see
 weird reflections, but there's no sign of any controls. The elevator's
 movements must all be decided externally.

 The other passenger in the lift, the depository manager, has taken it
 upon himself to bore you to death.

 The depository manager speaks in a tone especially reserved for the
 unfortunate people who do business with him.

 "Our vaults are intruder proof. We have all the latest locking devices
 in place."

 The manager must have an attack alarm with him, because as you soon as
 you make your advances, the elevator shudders to a halt and returns to
 ground level. A distinctly unpleasant reception committee is waiting
 for you when the doors open.

 The manager refers to it as if it were prize money.

>take man
 I don't suppose the depository manager would care for that.

 "But of course, these are insignificant next to the Crown Jewels, the

 acquisition you know."

 The elevator has nearly reached the vault floor, you'd best get rid of
 this guy.

>spray man
 (with the aerosol spray)
 You lift the aerosol, and spray the manager with sleeping gas. He seems
 slightly puzzled as he collapses. A tiny gold key falls out of his grey
 suit onto the metal floor. Soon afterwards, the elevator comes to a
 halt and the doors open.

 Outer Vault
 You feel so close now. Your destiny is within reach. To the south of
 you is a massive titanium door leading to the depository vault. The
 beautiful plants outside it seem insignificant. It's as if your whole
 life past, present and future depends on what happens in the next few
 minutes.

 Opposite the vault door is a red a white sign.

 The titanium door is quite clearly closed and locked.

 The elevator doors close behind you. It can only be a matter of time

 Inner Vault
 You would expect more than this, especially from what is supposed to be
 one of the most secure banks in the world. The presence of only one
 platform is something of an anticlimax. There are no safety deposit
 boxes or other means of storage. A maintenance hatch is plainly visible
 on the smooth floor of the vault.

 The Crown Jewels of Denario have been placed neatly on the central
 platform.

 Restricting your access to the central platform are a web of laser

 Just underneath you is a grey passage, which continues as far as the
 eye can see.


 As you enter the grey passage, you feel yourself returning to reality.

 Inner Vault
 You would expect more than this, especially from what is supposed to be
 one of the most secure banks in the world. The presence of only one
 platform is something of an anticlimax. There are no safety deposit
 boxes or other means of storage. A maintenance hatch is plainly visible
 on the smooth floor of the vault.

 An escape tunnel has opened up in the east wall.

 The Crown Jewels of Denario have been placed neatly on the central
 platform.

 Restricting your access to the central platform are a web of laser
 beams, surely connected to an alarm system.

 The laser beams surrounding the central platform disappear.

 [Your score has just gone up by six points.]

>SAVE
>cf51
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>take jewels
 Before doing anything with the crown jewels, you admire the beauty of
 them.

 Taking a closer look at the crown jewels, you see that they consist of
 a silver arrow, a jewel studded mace and a golden crown with a diamond
 mounted on the top. Quite easily the most magnificent collection of
 valuable items you have ever laid eyes upon. They have an ability to
 glisten as only the world's great treasures can.

>again
 Taken.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a jewel studded mace
   an interface terminal (connected to the circular socket)
   an identity card
   a black canvas bag (which is open)
     an aerosol spray
     a pornographic poster
     a child's doll
   a pair of surgical gloves (being worn)

 escape tunnel: That's fixed in place.
 central platform: The central platform can't be moved.
 maintenance hatch: You can't take that with you.

 On the central platform are a golden crown and a silver arrow.

>take crown
 Taken.

>take arrow
 Taken.

>examine platform
 A rather dull platform is in the centre of the vault, you can't see
 anything unusual about it.

>search platform
 There is nothing on the central platform.

>touch platform
 You feel a narrow groove running around the edges of the platform.

>examine groove
 A rather dull platform is in the centre of the vault, you can't see
 anything unusual about it.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>pry platform with arrow
 You insert the silver arrow into the narrow groove and heave. Soon
 afterwards the platform gives way to reveal a secret compartment.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>look in compartment
 In the central platform is a black opaque crystal.

>take crystal
 (putting the identity card into the black canvas bag to make room)
 Taken.

>examine arrow
 A splendid silver arrow that gleams in the light. The tip of it looks
 very sharp indeed.

>examine mace
 A rod of the purest gold, with emeralds and rubies covering the
 surface. It will make a fine addition to your mantelpiece when you get
 back.

>examine crown
 The crown is made of solid gold. There are ancient inscriptions written
 on the outside surface. In the centre of the crown is a large,
 perfectly shaped diamond.

>examine diamond
 The diamond is the centrepiece of the crown jewels, perfectly shaped
 and worth millions alone.

>take diamond
 You haven't really got time to do that now, you have to get out of
 here!

>go east

 Escape Tunnel
 The steel tunnel continues to the east, where you see the light of
 freedom and success. A sense of great triumph has descended on you.
 This first great step of your life is nearly at an end.

 The tunnel to the vault closes behind you.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>take diamond
 You remove the perfectly shaped diamond from the crown's mount.

>SAVE
>cf52
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go east
 As you walk down the tunnel, the crown jewels of Denario glisten in the
 light. Two hours later you're on a plane out of the country, with the
 jewels safely tucked away in a hiding place. For you it is the
 beginning of a life of plunder and adventure. Yet when you are staring
 out of a window near death just as your uncle was so long ago, you
 can't help feeling there was something you missed. The priest reading
 your last rites is just as condemning as that one was in that gloomy
 churchyard where it all started.

 The black opaque crystal is exactly the same shape as the sparkling
 diamond.

 You insert the black opaque crystal into the crown's mount.

 Nothing obvious happens.

 Nothing obvious happens.

 One of the emeralds seems slightly loose.

>touch mace
 One of the emeralds seems slightly loose.

>pry emerald with arrow
 That won't improve your situation.

>take emerald
 The emerald isn't loose enough to be pulled off the mace, though you
 should be able to push it.

>push emerald
 The black crystal starts to glow with an inner light. The atmosphere
 becomes darker and more sincere than before. A noise coming from the
 crown startles you. It is very much a voice from beyond the grave.

 "Congratulations, Elaine. You are a most worthy successor to my throne.
 Perhaps now you will have the knowledge to commit many crimes, but
 before you embark on your adventures, give some thought to why. When I
 came to the end of my days, I looked back with regret on what I had
 done. I saw that there was much need for my abilities, that there were
 other ways to use my talents instead of for personal profit. Hopefully
 you will not fall into the same trap. It is a glorious gift you have.
 Use it well. Good luck, and farewell Elaine. For ever."

 Your uncle's words of wisdom hit you hard. The crown jewels don't seem
 to glisten quite so much as they did before.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>go east
 Filled with a new vigour, you walk down the tunnel, and soon afterwards
 dump the crown jewels in a nearby lake. You begin to plan the rest of
 your career. The horrors of the severed fingers in the country mansion
 are still vivid in your memory. Crimes and people like that should not
 go unpunished. You embark on your crusade of making amends and
 correcting the many wrongs of modern society. The adventure is as
 present as it ever was, as is the excitement and the danger, but now it
 has direction it never had before.

 When your life finally ends and you are laid to rest in the churchyard
 next to your uncle, the priest reading the last rites this time has
 words of praise instead of condemnation.


     *** You have won ***
