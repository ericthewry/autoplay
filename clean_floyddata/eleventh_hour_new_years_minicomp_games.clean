 Top Chef Kitchen is the focal point of the show, your home away from
 home.  Well, technically, that would be the loft.  This is your home
 away from home away from home.  It's where the majority of challenges
 take place.  When you first arrived, it was intimidating and awkward,
 but now that you've been here awhile -- and with half the cheftestants
 gone -- it's become reasonably comfortable.

 In the "center" of the room (pretending for the moment that there is a
 fourth wall), there are a bunch of stations, each with some basic
 utensils, and a sink.  Along one wall is a gleaming row of GE
 Monogram® ovens, scrubbed inside and out after every challenge to show
 the sponsor in the best possible light.  Above them, the massive Top
 Chef logo looms.  And as always, a bunch of Elves are here with their
 gear, all artfully hidden from the viewers.  The pantry is to the
 west.

 [First time players should type ABOUT.  Really, you should.]

 A bunch of equipment is lined up on a rack near the gas range and
 grill: among many other things, there's some plates, a grater, a
 cast-iron skillet, a Robot Coupe, a huge pressure cooker and a mixing
 bowl.

 Justin, Andre, Linh, Stephen and Violet are here milling around.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Quickfire</span> was written in the last two weeks of December 2017,
 except for the opening text and description of Padma, which have been
 sitting on my hard drive for three and a half years.

 Thanks to Graham Nelson, Emily Short, and Michael Callaghan for Inform
 7 and the extensions I've used, and to Brian Rushton and an anonymous
 tester for testing and feedback.  Thanks also to Bravo, Magical Elves,
 Tom Colicchio and Padma Lakshmi for not suing me (please).  This is a
 work of fan fiction.  "Top Chef," "Quickfire Challenge", and
 "Restaurant Wars" are the intellectual property of Bravo and Magical
 Elves, and I make no claim otherwise.

 The games uses a number of uncommon verbs like GRATE, DRAIN, FLIP and
 PLATE.  I hope they will be obvious in context.  You can also make use
 handy while cooking.  Please note that examining, looking, searching,
 tasting, smelling and taking inventory are always free actions, so
 feel free to poke around even while the timer is ticking down.

 I can be reached at mister_patient@yahoo.com.  Thanks for playing.


 You haven't showered today, and your hair is kind of a mess, but the
 Elves have done their best to make you look presentable for the
 cameras.  You're wearing your Top Chef whites over a Litchfield
 Women's Correctional Facility T-shirt and a pair of jeans.


 You are carrying:
   a Top Chef whites (being worn)
   a Litchfield Women's Correctional Facility T-shirt (being worn)
   jeans (being worn)
   some knives


 A punishingly expensive and well-honed set of Bob Kramers for various
 applications, including a large chef's knife, a paring knife, a fillet
 knife, a cleaver, a serrated bread knife, and a few others.  At
 Padma's request, you will pack them and go.  [Note: You will
 automatically choose appropriate knives for your kitchen tasks.  No
 need to worry about what's what.]

>examine justin

 Justin is tall and faux-hawked, and has meticulously-maintained
 three-day stubble every day of the week.  He likes to remind people
 that he <span class="floydstyle em">staged</span> at <span class="floydstyle em">El Bulli</span>.

>examine andre

 A fairly big dude from Houston; nominated for a James Beard last year.
 He's a sweet guy, for the most part.

>examine linh

 A feisty little Vietnamese-American woman, executive chef at one of
 Charlie Palmer's places.  She's a real tough competitor, but usually
 not a jerk.

>examine stephen

 He's a small, quiet Midwesterner, self-taught, and works currently as
 a private chef.  While everyone else is drinking in the Stew Room,
 he's always got a bottle of fizzy water.  He's won a bunch of
 challenges, which drives Justin insane.

>examine violet

 She's African-American too; well, quite a bit further removed
 temporally from Africa than you are, and likely from the other side of
 the continent, but still, by American reckoning, African.  You can
 tell she is going to be a fan favorite.  Very pretty, very
 quick-witted, and usually very good as well.

>examine me

 You haven't showered today, and your hair is kind of a mess, but the
 Elves have done their best to make you look presentable for the
 cameras.  You're wearing your Top Chef whites over a Litchfield
 Women's Correctional Facility T-shirt and a pair of jeans.


 The details are not that important.  When you're ready, you can just
 PUT SKILLET ON RANGE.


 Each station has a counter with some electrical sockets for equipment
 and sundry standard kitchen implements.  Back at the start of the
 season, every station was occupied, leading to elbow-to-elbow cooking,
 territorial fights, ingredient theft, bickering, crashes, and other
 reality-show goodness.  Now there's a little room to spread out.  The
 rest still happens.

 On your station is a cutting board.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top Chef Kitchen</span>
 Top Chef Kitchen is the focal point of the show, your home away from

 away from home away from home.  It's where the majority of challenges
 take place.  When you first arrived, it was intimidating and awkward,
 but now that you've been here awhile -- and with half the cheftestants
 gone -- it's become reasonably comfortable.

 In the "center" of the room (pretending for the moment that there is a

 [First time players should type ABOUT.  Really, you should.]

 A bunch of equipment is lined up on a rack near the gas range and
 grill: among many other things, there's some plates, a grater, a
 cast-iron skillet, a Robot Coupe, a huge pressure cooker and a mixing
 bowl.

 Justin, Andre, Linh, Stephen and Violet are here milling around.

>xyzzy

 Sorry, did you say "tzatziki?"

>examine coupe

 A hideously-expensive, industrial-grade food processor used in
 professional kitchens.  Put stuff into it and press the button.

>examine skillet

 A heavy fifteen-inch cast-iron pan, properly seasoned.

 The cast-iron skillet is empty.


 It's a nice butcher-block model.  There are many like it, but this one
 (for the duration of the challenge) is yours.

 There is nothing on the cutting board.

>go west

 Don't wander off just yet.

 One of the Elves, a production assistant, raises his voice.  "OK,
 everyone, we're starting.  Cheftestants, please line up."  The other
 chefs dutifully begin to arrange themselves, with the assistance of
 the Elves.

 A few minutes later, Padma and Tom arrive and chat with each other
 inaudibly, over by the logo.  Tom's wearing a Santa hat.  The Elves
 set them on their marks, then wheel out a table loaded down with tubs
 of something.  Fabulous.  More product placement.  Everyone
 straightens up.  "Quiet on the set!," shouts the director.  The
 cameramen take their places and begin rolling.

 "Action!"

 "Greetings, chefs," purrs Padma.  She's considerably better-rested and
 groomed than you lot.  "It's Christmas!"  Actually, it's June as
 you're filming this, and about 90 degrees outside.  "Behind me, as you
 can see"  --  she waves for effect -- "we have sour cream from Organic
 Valley.  Sour cream is extremely versatile and can be used in a wide
 variety of last-minute sweet and savory dishes for a holiday party."

 Tom: "Your Quickfire challenge this week is to make us a delicious
 dish for a holiday party incorporating Organic Valley sour cream."
 The cameras come in for reaction shots from you and the others.  You
 can see the wheels turning in your fellow competitors.

 Padma, again: "You have twenty minutes.  The winner of the Quickfire
 will not get immunity, but will get a significant benefit in the next
 Elimination Challenge."

 "Cut!", yells the director.  "OK, everyone, stay on your marks.  Let's
 get some acknowledgments."  Tom and Padma chat for a bit, while a pair
 of Elves, one holding a camera, walk the line of cheftestants.  They
 approach, and make you repeat the terms of the challenge back to the
 cameras for legal purposes.  Reality show contestants can be rather
 litigious, you know.

 "Samiira, do you fully understand the terms of the challenge?"


 "Thank you, Samiira."  They move on down the line until all the
 cheftestants have given their assent.


 Don't wander off just yet.

 The director shouts, "Everyone, back on your marks!"  Moments later,
 they're set up and rolling again.

 Everyone tenses as they wait for Padma.  "Your time starts" -- slight
 pause -- "NOW!"

 OK!  Well, there's probably a million baking options, but you don't
 have anything other than <span class="floydstyle em">kac kac</span> or <span class="floydstyle em">luqaimat</span>
 memorized.  You don't have time to bake during a Quickfire anyway.
 Think of something!  What was the last thing you made with sour cream?
 OK, yes -- a friend you worked with (now your ex-boyfriend's wife)
 taught you to make latkes last year.  That'll work.  The timing will
 be really tight, though you think you can finish, <span class="floydstyle em">inshallah</span>.

 So you're gonna need POTATOES and EGGS and ONIONS and MATZO MEAL and
 OIL (or equivalent) and SALT.  And then SOUR CREAM, obviously, and
 something else on top.  Maybe a BERRY of some kind?  Or savory --
 wait, wasn't there some IKURA in the fridge yesterday?  [You can type
 RECIPE or R at any time to pull up the recipe.]

 The other cheftestants bolt off their marks to get their stuff.  You
 see Linh, Violet, and Justin dash to the pantry, and Andre and Stephen
 heading over to the equipment.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>
 The Top Chef pantry is stocked, at least most days, with just about
 anything you could want.  Not always in huge quantities, though.
 Having the cheftestants squabble over ingredients makes for good TV.
 A giant GE Monogram® refrigerator occupies much of the north wall.
 Next to it are shelves filled with various nonperishable goods.  And
 opposite them are baskets of produce.

 Here getting ingredients are Violet and Linh.

 The camera comes in for a close-up on you and what you're doing.  You
 manage a few words.

 You see Linh, already weighed down with armfuls of ingredients,
 struggling to reach a jar of Moroccan olives on the shelves.  She
 turns to you for help.  "Sam, hey, uh, can you?", she asks.  There are
 actually a couple up of jars there.  Justin, meanwhile, peels around
 the corner and starts lunging towards the baskets, with an Elf close
 behind.  "..blackberrry jus," he seems to be saying to no one in
 particular.


 You leave Linh hanging.  "Thanks for nothing!" she says.  She puts
 some stuff down, jumps, and gets the jar herself.

 Taken.

 Stephen and Andre arrive and begin gathering ingredients.

>take eggs

  salt

 Combine potatoes, onions, eggs, salt and matzo meal in bowl.  Fry
 latkes in very hot oil, flipping after five minutes.  Drain and plate
 the latkes.  Garnish as appropriate, and finish with salt to taste.

 Given this challenge, "garnish" means sour cream, and maybe a little
 something else.  Berries, or caviar, perhaps.

>get oil

 Justin elbows his way to the baskets and grabs the blackberries.
 "Sorry," he claims.  "I need them for a jus."  He lurches off.

 Justin calls out, "Does anyone have the immersion blender?"

>put eggs and onions and potatoes and salt and matzo in a bowl

 eggs: You crack some eggs, dump them into the bowl, and whisk them to
 a light froth.
 yellow onions: You dunk an entire onion, skin and all, into the raw
 egg mix.  Hm, that doesn't seem right.  You fish it back out again.
 Yukon Gold potatoes: You plop the whole potatoes into the raw egg mix.
 Hm, that doesn't seem right.  You fish them back out again.
 kosher salt: (first taking the salt)
 You sprinkle some salt in to the mix; probably a little less than you
 might normally need, but it's always easy to add later.
 matzo meal: You add the matzo meal.

>peel onion

 You don't really need to peel that.


 You grab the onions, quickly discard the skins, halve them, and
 holding the halves firmly, make a series of fine crosswise cuts.
 Keeping them together, you rock your big chef's knife up and down with
 lightning speed, turning the onions into tiny tidbits.  Your eyes are

 Magical Elves is the name of the production company, and so people
 refer to anyone behind the cameras generically as Elves.  Naturally
 you've gotten to know a few of them pretty well, having spent so much
 time over the last couple of weeks in their constant presence.  But in
 the heat of a challenge, they're just an undifferentiated mass of
 people putting cameras in your face and generally getting in your way.

 The Top Chef pantry is stocked, at least most days, with just about
 anything you could want.  Not always in huge quantities, though.
 Having the cheftestants squabble over ingredients makes for good TV.
 A giant GE Monogram® refrigerator occupies much of the north wall.
 Next to it are shelves filled with various nonperishable goods.  And
 opposite them are baskets of produce.

 There's a crash of pans on the floor and Justin takes a mock bow.


 Large wooden baskets, filled with all manner of produce.

 In the baskets are a few heads of garlic, some artichokes, some okra,
 some carrots, some green beans, some kale, some broccoli, some apples,
 some tomatoes, some spinach, some eggplant, some arugula, some
 endives, some lemons, some radicchio, some cauliflower, some zucchini,

 You check the underside of the latkes.  They're still a little pale on
 that side.


 Too late for that now.  You've already topped them with sour cream.


 Waiting for 5 minutes.

 As the clock ticks down to zero, Padma shouts: "Utensils down, hands
 UP!"

 "Cut!" yells the director.  An Elf comes by with a cart and carefully
 gathers up the beauty plates to be photographed off-set.  Another Elf
 straightens up the tasting plates and gets everyone, including Tom and
 Padma, lined up after a few seconds.  You're the last in line.

 "Action!"

 "Hi, Linh," says Padma, heading to the first cheftestant.  "What did
 you make for us today?"  Padma and Tom taste everyone's dishes and
 chitchat with the chefs for a bit until finally they get to you.

 "You made latkes!" says Tom, with some amusement.  "Yeah, I'm not much
 of a Christmas person," you reply.  "I have to say, you don't look
 like a Hanukkah person, either."  He chuckles.  You continue: "It's
 just a classic potato latke, with sour cream."

 Padma digs in.  Tom picks at the latkes.  "Did you forget to flip
 them?", he asks.  "Looks like you got one side, but not the other."
 Padma asks, "What did you fry this in?"  "Vegetable oil," you reply.
 She and Tom are inscrutable.  "Thanks," she says.

 The Elves guide Padma and Tom back to their marks, and the cameras
 begin rolling again.  "So, Tom, who had our least-favorite dishes?"
 Tom points.  "Justin," he says.  "The individual components were all
 cooked well, but it just didn't make sense to me.  I'm not sure why
 you would pair the bison with Mentos."

 He then turns to you.  "Samiira."  <span class="floydstyle em">Wase</span>.  "My wife does
 latkes every year at Hanukkah, and these just weren't up to snuff."
 Awesome.  You stop listening to the rest.  Hey, Violet actually won.
 Good for her.  After everyone settles down, Padma begins again.  "And
 now for this week's Elimination Challenge: it's what you've all been
 waiting for."  She winds and delivers: <span class="floydstyle i">"Restaurant Wars!</span>"

 The sun has not even risen when the Elves rouse you from your rest.
 You've slept far too little since last night's bloodbath, but it's
 time once again for battle.  You sharpen your blades and head to the
 arena.  Only six combatants remain, including yourself.  Great
 merciful Zeus, you are exhausted.  But you're not giving up now, not

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top Chef Kitchen</span>
 Top Chef Kitchen is the focal point of the show, your home away from
 home.  Well, technically, that would be the loft.  This is your home
 away from home away from home.  It's where the majority of challenges
 take place.  When you first arrived, it was intimidating and awkward,
 but now that you've been here awhile -- and with half the cheftestants
 gone -- it's become reasonably comfortable.

 In the "center" of the room (pretending for the moment that there is a
 fourth wall), there are a bunch of stations, each with some basic
 utensils, and a sink.  Along one wall is a gleaming row of GE
 Monogram® ovens, scrubbed inside and out after every challenge to show

 Chef logo looms.  And as always, a bunch of Elves are here with their
 gear, all artfully hidden from the viewers.  The pantry is to the
 west.

 [First time players should type ABOUT.  Really, you should.]

 A bunch of equipment is lined up on a rack near the gas range and
 grill: among many other things, there's some plates, a grater, a
 cast-iron skillet, a Robot Coupe, a huge pressure cooker and a mixing
 bowl.

 Justin, Andre, Linh, Stephen and Violet are here milling around.


 It's an enormous, professional-quality pressure cooker.  It seems to
 be sitting unevenly on the rack.


 You shift the huge pressure cooker, and find a Robot Coupe grating
 attachment underneath.  The attachment is now sitting on the equipment
 rack.

 One of the Elves, a production assistant, raises his voice.  "OK,
 everyone, we're starting.  Cheftestants, please line up."  The other
 chefs dutifully begin to arrange themselves, with the assistance of
 the Elves.

 A few minutes later, Padma and Tom arrive and chat with each other
 inaudibly, over by the logo.  Tom's wearing a Santa hat.  The Elves
 set them on their marks, then wheel out a table loaded down with tubs
 of something.  Fabulous.  More product placement.  Everyone
 straightens up.  "Quiet on the set!," shouts the director.  The
 cameramen take their places and begin rolling.

 "Action!"

 "Greetings, chefs," purrs Padma.  She's considerably better-rested and
 groomed than you lot.  "It's Christmas!"  Actually, it's June as
 you're filming this, and about 90 degrees outside.  "Behind me, as you
 can see"  --  she waves for effect -- "we have sour cream from Organic
 Valley.  Sour cream is extremely versatile and can be used in a wide
 variety of last-minute sweet and savory dishes for a holiday party."

 Tom: "Your Quickfire challenge this week is to make us a delicious
 dish for a holiday party incorporating Organic Valley sour cream."
 The cameras come in for reaction shots from you and the others.  You
 can see the wheels turning in your fellow competitors.

 Padma, again: "You have twenty minutes.  The winner of the Quickfire
 will not get immunity, but will get a significant benefit in the next
 Elimination Challenge."

 "Cut!", yells the director.  "OK, everyone, stay on your marks.  Let's
 get some acknowledgments."  Tom and Padma chat for a bit, while a pair
 of Elves, one holding a camera, walk the line of cheftestants.  They
 approach, and make you repeat the terms of the challenge back to the
 cameras for legal purposes.  Reality show contestants can be rather
 litigious, you know.

 "Samiira, do you fully understand the terms of the challenge?"


 "Thank you, Samiira."  They move on down the line until all the
 cheftestants have given their assent.


 Time passes.

 The director shouts, "Everyone, back on your marks!"  Moments later,
 they're set up and rolling again.

 Everyone tenses as they wait for Padma.  "Your time starts" -- slight
 pause -- "NOW!"

 OK!  Well, there's probably a million baking options, but you don't
 have anything other than <span class="floydstyle em">kac kac</span> or <span class="floydstyle em">luqaimat</span>
 memorized.  You don't have time to bake during a Quickfire anyway.
 Think of something!  What was the last thing you made with sour cream?
 OK, yes -- a friend you worked with (now your ex-boyfriend's wife)
 taught you to make latkes last year.  That'll work.  The timing will
 be really tight, though you think you can finish, <span class="floydstyle em">inshallah</span>.

 So you're gonna need POTATOES and EGGS and ONIONS and MATZO MEAL and
 OIL (or equivalent) and SALT.  And then SOUR CREAM, obviously, and
 something else on top.  Maybe a BERRY of some kind?  Or savory --
 wait, wasn't there some IKURA in the fridge yesterday?  [You can type
 RECIPE or R at any time to pull up the recipe.]

 The other cheftestants bolt off their marks to get their stuff.  You
 see Linh, Violet, and Justin dash to the pantry, and Andre and Stephen
 heading over to the equipment.

 Next to it are shelves filled with various nonperishable goods.  And
 opposite them are baskets of produce.

 Here getting ingredients are Violet and Linh.

 Justin is making a show of his butchering technique.

 You see Linh, already weighed down with armfuls of ingredients,
 struggling to reach a jar of Moroccan olives on the shelves.  She
 turns to you for help.  "Sam, hey, uh, can you?", she asks.  There are
 actually a couple up of jars there.  Justin, meanwhile, peels around
 the corner and starts lunging towards the baskets, with an Elf close
 behind.  "..blackberrry jus," he seems to be saying to no one in
 particular.


 Which do you mean, the intact jar of Moroccan olives or the greasy jar
 of Moroccan olives?


 You reach up and grab the nicer of the two jars and hand it to Linh.
 She's always been pretty decent to you, except that one time during
 the mise en place relay race when you overheard her whispering smack
 to Brian about your suprèming technique.  Linh nearly drops the jar
 but recovers and heads to her station.

 Stephen and Andre arrive and begin gathering ingredients.


 Plain but attractive shelves filled, for the most part, with
 medium-sized dry goods.

 On the shelves are some Panko, some masa, some mustard, some paprika,
 some sugar, some baking soda, a bottle of gochujang, some soy sauce,
 some vegetable oil, some linguine, some kosher salt, some ketchup,
 some tomato paste, a bag of flour, some cardamom, some cocoa powder,
 some cinnamon, some matzo meal, some wild rice and some jasmine rice.


 You can't see any such thing.


 Taken.

 Justin elbows you out of the way and grabs the blackberries.  He
 lurches off.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>

 Just as you reach for the blackberries, Justin barges in, elbowing you
 aside.  "Sorry," he claims.  "I'm doing a jus."  He snags them and
 heads back toward his station.

 away from home away from home.  It's where the majority of challenges
 take place.  When you first arrived, it was intimidating and awkward,
 but now that you've been here awhile -- and with half the cheftestants
 gone -- it's become reasonably comfortable.

 In the "center" of the room (pretending for the moment that there is a
 fourth wall), there are a bunch of stations, each with some basic
 utensils, and a sink.  Along one wall is a gleaming row of GE

 west.

 Furiously prepping and cooking here are Andre, Violet, Stephen, Justin
 and Linh.

 Padma Lakshmi and Tom Colicchio are chatting off-camera.

 A bunch of equipment is lined up on a rack near the gas range and
 grill: among many other things, there's some plates, a grater, a
 cast-iron skillet, a Robot Coupe, a huge pressure cooker and a mixing
 bowl.

 On the equipment rack is a grating attachment.

 You can also see a table (on which are many tubs of sour cream) here.


 You need to grate, rather than chop, the potatoes.


 You need to something to grate with.  Like a grater.  Or even better,
 a Robot Coupe.


 You grab a peeler from the implements at your station and peel the
 Yukon Gold potatoes as fast as you possibly can.


 You put the Yukon Gold potatoes into the Robot Coupe.

 Someone shouts "Hot!" as they race around the kitchen.


 Unfortunately you can't grate anything with the Robot Coupe without
 the proper attachment.


 The rack is where the common kitchen equipment is kept.

 On the equipment rack are a grating attachment, some plates, a grater,
 a cast-iron skillet, a Robot Coupe, a huge pressure cooker and a
 mixing bowl.


 You pop the attachment into the Robot Coupe.  Now you can grate stuff
 with it.

 "Behind!" someone yells.


 You pulse the Robot Coupe with the grating attachment in place until
 the potatoes are grated nicely.  You dump the potatoes on the cutting
 board and quickly rinse out the processor.


 You grab the onions, quickly discard the skins, halve them, and
 holding the halves firmly, make a series of fine crosswise cuts.
 Keeping them together, you rock your big chef's knife up and down with
 lightning speed, turning the onions into tiny tidbits.  Your eyes are
 tearing, but you have no time to wipe them.

 A camera-wielding Elf scurries past you.


 You crack some eggs, dump them into the bowl, and whisk them to a
 light froth.

 Linh is talking to the camera somewhere.

 Each station has a counter with some electrical sockets for equipment
 and sundry standard kitchen implements.  Back at the start of the
 season, every station was occupied, leading to elbow-to-elbow cooking,
 territorial fights, ingredient theft, bickering, crashes, and other
 reality-show goodness.  Now there's a little room to spread out.  The
 rest still happens.

 On your station are a mixing bowl and a cutting board.


 You dry the Yukon Gold potatoes as best you can with paper towels,
 trying to wring as much moisture out as possible.


 Small, golden spuds.  They've been peeled.  You've grated them.  And
 they've been dried.

 You put the skillet on the range and turn the burner up to high.  The
 duck fat begins to heat up.


 You add the yellow onions.


 (first taking the salt)
 You add the last of the latke ingredients into the bowl and mix them
 thoroughly.  You now have raw latkes, or at least the stuff of raw
 latkes.  [To begin cooking, add some frying medium to the skillet and
 put the skillet on the range.]


 A heavy fifteen-inch cast-iron pan, properly seasoned.

 In the cast-iron skillet is some duck fat.


 I didn't understand that number.


 Time passes.

 The intensity of the sizzling tells you that the pan is now hot enough
 to fry with.


 (first taking the latkes)
 You slide the latkes into the pan, and they begin to sizzle a little.
 [Note: when you're done cooking them, just GET SKILLET.]

 The latkes continue to fry in the skillet.


 Waiting for 5 minutes.

 The latkes continue to fry in the skillet.

 The latkes are browning nicely.

 Violet's loud laugh reverberates around the whole studio.

 The latkes continue to fry in the skillet.

 The latkes are browning nicely.


 First things first.  You remove the latkes from the heat.  The
 sizzling abates.

 You put the latkes on some paper towels to drain the excess grease.


 You carefully plate the latkes, trimming some of the edges to make
 them more visually appealing, and arranging them just so.

 Padma and Tom re-enter the kitchen.  Violet looks up and shouts "54

 There's a crash of pans on the floor and Linh takes a mock bow.


 You open the refrigerator, revealing a lobe of foie gras, some bacon,
 some feta, some Ahi tuna, some short ribs, some milk and a leg of
 lamb.


 I didn't understand that sentence.


 In the refrigerator are some short ribs, some milk, a leg of lamb, a
 lobe of foie gras, some feta, some bacon and some Ahi tuna.

>search tuna

 You don't need the Ahi tuna.  Focus on what you need for your dish.

 A burst of flame erupts momentarily from the range as someone else's
 pot boils over.

 The fridge door swings shut.

>search lamb

 You can't see any such thing.


 You open the refrigerator, revealing some bacon, a leg of lamb, a lobe
 of foie gras, some milk, some Ahi tuna, some short ribs and some feta.


 There might be some, but you don't see it immediately.  You'd have to
 SEARCH THE FRIDGE FOR it, which might take a little time.

>search THE fridge

 In the refrigerator are some short ribs, some milk, a leg of lamb, a
 lobe of foie gras, some feta, some bacon and some Ahi tuna.

 The fridge door swings shut.

>open fridge

 You open the refrigerator, revealing a lobe of foie gras, some milk,
 some Ahi tuna, some bacon, some short ribs, some feta and a leg of
 lamb.

>search fridge for caviar

 You find the ikura, buried in the back, and grab it before anyone else
 does.  Sweet!

 As the clock ticks down to zero, Padma shouts: "Utensils down, hands
 UP!"

 "Cut!" yells the director.  An Elf comes by with a cart and carefully
 gathers up the beauty plates to be photographed off-set.  Another Elf
 straightens up the tasting plates and gets everyone, including Tom and
 Padma, lined up after a few seconds.  You're the last in line.

 "Action!"

 "Hi, Linh," says Padma, heading to the first cheftestant.  "What did
 you make for us today?"  Padma and Tom taste everyone's dishes and
 chitchat with the chefs for a bit until finally they get to you.

 "You made latkes!" says Tom, with some amusement.  "Yeah, I'm not much
 of a Christmas person," you reply.  "I have to say, you don't look
 like a Hanukkah person, either."  He chuckles.  You continue: "It's
 just a classic potato latke, with sour cream."

 Padma digs in.  Tom takes a bite.  "Did you taste these?", he asks.
 "They're underseasoned.  They need more salt."  Padma asks, "What did
 you fry this in?"  "Duck fat," you reply.  "I can tell," she says.
 "Thanks."

 The Elves guide Padma and Tom back to their marks, and the cameras
 begin rolling again.  "So, Tom, who had our least-favorite dishes?"
 Tom points.  "Justin," he says.  "The individual components were all
 cooked well, but it just didn't make sense to me.  I'm not sure why
 you would pair the bison with Mentos."  He then turns to Stephen.
 "Steve.  The lamb was just overcooked."

 "And who were our favorites?," Padma asks.  "Violet," he says.  "You
 really got an amazing amount of flavor from that chicken in such a
 short time, and the sour cream was a nice contrast with the spice.
 And... Andre.  The deconstructed potato skin was a pretty clever
 idea."

 Oh well.  At least you weren't on the bottom.  Oh hey, Violet wins.
 Good for her.  After everyone settles down, Padma begins again.  "And
 now for this week's Elimination Challenge: it's what you've all been
 waiting for."  She winds and delivers: <span class="floydstyle i">"Restaurant Wars!</span>"

 "Don't forget," your mother said, "your Granny's arthritis has been
 acting up since the weather last week. She's been in bed since
 Thursday. I need you to take her this basket first thing. When you get
 back, you can play Nintendo or whatever until I get home from work."

 You grunted something like "ok," and she drove off, leaving you
 standing there with a basket.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Your Home</span>
 You're outside the late model singlewide you now call home. Everyone
 else you know lives in actual houses, or at least trailer parks, but
 you moved here last year because your mother wanted to be near Granny.
 Not that she's even that close by foot.

 The highway is west, your home is north, and Granny's is an
 unreasonably long walk down the forest path to the southeast.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   the basket
     a bottle of moscato
     a box of coffee cake
   a red hoodie (being worn)

 Only the finest from the discount sporting goods warehouse near your
 old house.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Small Clearing</span>
 It's a small clearing in the trees where an old abandoned van is

 A small boat is chained up here.

>examine boat

 It's old but riverworthy, and it's chained up to an old log.

 You get into the small boat.

>examine chain

 It connects the boat to an old log, and it's secured by a padlock.

>unlock padlock with key

 (first taking the brass key)
 You open the padlock and the boat drifts away from the shore.

 The current takes the boat, and you jump out when it comes close to
 the far bank. Then the current grabs it again, and the boat is gone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fork in the Path</span>
 You're near where a bridge used cross the river. A stand of bamboo is
 still here.

 Your home is back across the missing bridge to the northwest, and
 you're pretty sure both the east and south paths will take you to
 Granny's.

 You can see a handsome hunter here.

 "Well hello there, Red," says the hunter.

>examine hunter

 The hunter is very handsome, but he's is the hairiest man you've ever
 seen. His face is wolflike, and his hair is black, but his thick beard
 and bushy eyebrows are silver gray. He's dressed in a blaze vest and
 cap.

>examine stand

 Obviously not native to the forest. The bamboo is tall and about an
 inch thick.

>talk to hunter

 "Hello. My name isn't Red."

 "And where are you going, my pretty one, with your little basket on
 your arm?" he asks.

 (You could refuse to answer; or tell him about Granny.)

>refuse

 "Never mind," he says creepily, "I know just who you are. You're going
 to visit your Granny, and that's just where I'm going too. I'll get
 there before you and tell her that you're coming to see her."

 And with that, he lopes off.

>cut bamboo with knife

 (first taking the pocket knife)
 You hack at the bamboo for a minute before remembering that your knife
 has a saw blade. It takes a few more minutes, but you cut a nice
 bamboo pole almost as tall as you are.

>saw bamboo

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine bamboo

 (the bamboo pole)
 It's green and thick and almost as tall as you are.

>take it

 You already have that.

 (first taking the shotgun shell)

 Taken.

>se

 Your home is northwest and paths lead south and east. The river runs
 northeast to southwest.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stones</span>
 You're surrounded by oak trees. The river is just north of here. Your
 Granny's house is uphill to the east. Unfortunately, it's up a steep
 hill of loose stones. Some squirrels scramble across the path every
 now and then as they hunt for acorns.

>examine squirrels

 What can you say? They're squirrels.

>search stones

 You grab a stone from the hill.

>go east

 With the bamboo pole as a walking stick, you're able to make it up the
 hill of stones.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lovely Meadow</span>
 The ground is covered with beautiful flowers of all colors.

 Granny's is east, and you can enter the forest to the north, south,
 and west.

>smell flowers

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>take flowers

 You pick a lovely bouquet of meadow flowers.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Granny's House</span>
 Granny's house is a one-room shack on the north side of the yard. Her
 shed is an even smaller building to the south. The road is east the
 path to the west leads back to your home.

>enter house


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside Granny's House</span>
 Granny's house is pretty much what you expect from a one room shack.
 There's a night table and a bed.

 The hunter is lounging on your Granny's bed. He's wearing her
 nightgown and nightcap, but fooling nobody.

>talk to hunter

 "Hello, my dear," he says, "come give your Granny a kiss."

 You have nothing specific in mind to discuss with hunter just now.

>SAVE
>cf2
 %% Enter a save filename to write:

>kiss granny

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine table

 A small rustic table.

 You notice that, unlike your Granny, the hunter has very muscular
 arms. You say "Granny, what big arms you have!"

 "All the better to hug you with, my dear," he answers.

>look under bed

 You find nothing of interest.

 You notice that, unlike your Granny, the hunter has big pointy ears.
 You say "Granny, what big ears you have!"

 "All the better to hear you with, my child," he answers.

 You think you should take a closer look at the hunter.

>examine hunter

 The hunter has swapped his blaze vest and hat for your Granny's
 nightclothes. You're more than a bit concerned about what he's done
 with her. Also, now that you get a good look, he looks a lot more like
 a wolf than the man you saw before.

 Unlike your Granny, the wolf has large black eyes. You say "Granny,
 what big eyes you have!"

 "All the better to see you with, my child," he answers.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Granny's House</span>
 Granny's house is a one-room shack on the north side of the yard. Her
 shed is an even smaller building to the south. The road is east the
 path to the west leads back to your home.

>examine shed

 A tiny shed where she stores things.


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>enter shed

 (first opening the shed door)
 It seems to be locked.

 Granny walks in from the east.

 "Hello dear," she says, "what are you doing here?"

 (You could ask her about where she was; or tell her about the wolf or
 the basket.)

>tell about wolf

 You can't see any such thing.

>tell granny about wolf

 "I met a hunter in the woods and now he's in your bed wearing your
 clothes. I thought he had done something unspeakable to you."

 "I see," she says. "Let's take care of that wolf together. I'll watch
 the house. You go find me a weapon in the shed."

>unlock shed with key

 You can't see any such thing.

 good weapon from the shed."

>enter shed

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Granny's Shed</span>
 The shed is even smaller than the house.

 You can see a gas can, a flower pot, and a double barrel shotgun here.

>enter shed


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Granny's House</span>

 Your granny takes the double barrel shotgun.

 "Thanks, dear. Can you find us a shell?" she asks.

>give shell to granny

 Your granny takes the shotgun shell.

 "Thanks, dear."

 "Wait here a minute," Granny requests.

 She walks into her house and you hear a very short discussion
 punctuated by a shotgun blast.

 After the magical wall was erected around the kingdom, the cost of
 farm labor skyrocketed as workers from the enchanted forest and fairy
 prairie were no longer able to cross the border to find jobs. You and
 your mom were squeaking by until she became sick. Unable to afford
 insurance, you have had to sell off your assets one by one to keep the
 farm going.

 Now you are down to your final cow, good old Bessy.

 The Bean Stalker
 by Jack Welch
 Release 2 / Serial number 180108 / ZILF 0.8 lib J4

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Family Farm</span>
 Not much is left of the farm, just the tumble down shack you call home

 Bessy the cow anxiously chews her last wad of cud.

>inventory


 You are empty-handed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yagmar's Olde Pawn Shoppe</span>
 On the seedier side of town, the windows of the pawn shop are
 plastered with signs: Paychecks Cashed, BUY AND SELL GOLD, Top Price
 for Cows! Your farm is back to the east.

 Greasy and perpetually hung over, the proprietor of the pawnshop,
 Yagmar the Barbarian, stands behind a counter and brims with avarice.

>examine yagmar


 Seven foot four and 520 pounds. Obey.

>kiss yagmar


 How is that in the least bit a desirable thing to do?

>xyzzy


 I don't know the word "xyzzy".

>talk to yagmar


 "You got stuff to trade? Give it to me. Then I give you stuff. Then
 you leave. That's how it works."

>examine daughter


 I don't know the word "daughter".

>give cow to yagmar


 Yagmar looks sideways at the pint-sized cow.

 "Kind of scrawny, but I'll take it. Let's see. Here, take one of
 these. Now scram."

 He hands you a somewhat shriveled but vaguely magical legume.

>examine bean


 The bean glows faintly. It is either magical or radioactive.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Family Farm</span>

 I don't know the word "earth".

 Verbose descriptions.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Family Farm</span>

 and an old stable. The town is off to the west.

>examine stable


 That's not something you need to worry about in this game.

>in


 You can't go that way.

>plant bean


 When the bean touches the soil, it burrows in furiously, ejecting dirt
 in all directions. After a moment, the ground shakes and a massive
 beanstalk shoots upward.

>examine stalk


 The beanstalk towers over your farm and for that matter, the town as
 well.

 Down the road, you expect you'll be getting some angry letters from
 the homeowner's association.

>go up


 You climb up the bean stalk, which goes on and on. Eventually, you
 push through the clouds and find yourself poking through a lawn.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Golf Course</span>
 A lush and rambling golf course with a red-carpeted cloud-top path

 A doddering ogre, covered in cheddar powder and sporting a bad comb

>examine ogre


 The ogre stands awkwardly just outside the casino, trying to look
 important.

>talk to ogre


 "Let me give you some advice, do you want some advice? Of course you
 do, you're saying, I wonder what advice he has to give me, and now I'm
 giving it to you, so you should listen because they say my advice is
 the best advice. I give the best advice, because when I am telling
 people things, about advice, they all say, he has the best advice. So,
 my advice is that you get those birds, those horrible, they're not
 ducks, you know. Ducks are patriotic. There are television shows about
 ducks, and I saw one last week, so this is not at all about ducks.
 Those birds are geese, and I have had it up to here, right here, with
 them. So, if you get rid of them, then maybe we can talk."

>throw turd at ogre


 I don't think the orange ogre would appreciate that.

 A lush and rambling golf course with a red-carpeted cloud-top path
 leading west to the casino. Off to the east, the golf course is
 surrounded by luscious cumulus clouds.

 Some immigrant geese wander the carefully tended lawn brazenly.

>examine geese


 Lounging about on the lush, well-manicured lawn, the geese go about
 their business (in every sense), ignoring you.

>deport geese


 I don't know the word "deport".

>take geese


 The geese flutter about clearly avoiding you.

>go east


 As there are no safety nets in the kingdom, you fall through the
 fluffy clouds and land right where you started: in the dirt.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Family Farm</span>
 Not much is left of the farm, just the tumble down shack you call home

 A humongous green beanstalk with broad, leathery leaves reaches up

 Greasy and perpetually hung over, the proprietor of the pawnshop,
 Yagmar the Barbarian, stands behind a counter and brims with avarice.

>give turd to yagmar


 Yagmar squints at the ignoble lump of goose excrement on the counter
 and raises an eyebrow.

 "And what exactly am I supposed to do with *that*?" he inquires,
 pointing towards it with an accusatory index finger.

 "It's a souvenir from the casino," you say, trying to sound upbeat.
 "It's worth it's weight..."

 Before you can finish, the barbarian swipes the turd from his counter
 top and produces Bessy. "Whatever it is, it's guaranteed to be worth
 more than this viscious miniature cow of yours, which eats like a
 horse. Here. Take it and get out of here."

 Some immigrant geese wander the carefully tended lawn brazenly.

>drop cow


 As the diminutive cow lands on her spindly legs, she emits a yappy
 "moo".

 Driven by the sort of blood lust that one rarely sees in cows, Bessy
 rips across the lawn after the geese. The geese erupt into flight and
 settle a short distance away on a cloud bank. From that safe harbor,
 they honk mockingly at Bessy, who stands at the very edge of the lawn
 vibrating with anger and yapping madly at them.

 A glitzy casino entirely covered in gold leaf and flashing neon. The

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Golf Course</span>
 A lush and rambling golf course with a red-carpeted cloud-top path
 leading west to the casino. Off to the east, the golf course is
 surrounded by luscious cumulus clouds.

 Accustomed to starvation, the jittery cow stares unblinkingly into
 space.

 The non-indigenous fowl cluck and bristle with indignity from atop the
 neighboring clouds, while they keep a suspicious eye on your cow.

>get gow


 I don't know the word "gow".

 Now obsessed with her mortal enemies, the geese, Bessy snaps at you
 menacingly as you get near her. Since you value your hands, you let
 the murderous cow be. She growls at the birds, her rage barely
 contained.

>go down


 You can't find the spot where you had climbed up from the beanstalk.
 The incredibly vigorous lawn must have grown back over the hole.

>examine lawn


 That's not something you need to worry about in this game.

>go east


 As there are no safety nets in the kingdom, you fall through the
 fluffy clouds and land right where you started: in the dirt.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Family Farm</span>
 Not much is left of the farm, just the tumble down shack you call home
 and an old stable. The town is off to the west.

 You haven't seen your mom out of her sick bed in years, but there she
 is carving furrows in the soil with the stub of a twisted stick,
 literally scratching out a meager existence.

 A humongous green beanstalk with broad, leathery leaves reaches up
 through the clouds.

>examine mum


 I don't know the word "mum".

>examine mom


 She seems to be doing a good job, although she isn't moving as quickly
 as she used to.

 She can't stop talking about how miraculous it is that just as she was
 praying for better crop yields, it began to rain fertilizer.

 You pick her up like a bundle of kindling.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yagmar's Olde Pawn Shoppe</span>
 On the seedier side of town, the windows of the pawn shop are
 plastered with signs: Paychecks Cashed, BUY AND SELL GOLD, Top Price
 for Cows! Your farm is back to the east.

 Greasy and perpetually hung over, the proprietor of the pawnshop,
 Yagmar the Barbarian, stands behind a counter and brims with avarice.

>sell mom


 [to Yagmar]
 Yagmar looks her over appraisingly, pokes at her a bit with a soup
 spoon, and shoves her in a sack.

 "Done and done," he says, rubbing his hands together. "Haven't had one
 of these in a while, so tell you what I'm going to do."

 He reaches around the back of the counter and pulls out a fine Italian
 three-piece suit with fine pinstripes. Very chic. Stunned, you try it
 on immediately. It fits to a tee. No one will ever mistake you for a
 lowly farm hand again, by God.

>examine suit


 A fancy business suit, sharply tailored and top quality.

 You already have that.

>talk to ogre


 "Hang on a minute," the ogre says, holding up a tiny finger as he
 talks into his cell phone. "His own mother? Fantastic. Absolutely
 fantastic. He's here now. Talk later, Yagmar."

 The ogre pats you on the head, leaving a orange powdery outline of his
 palm on your forehead. "Just want to say, what you did, I am so, so
 impressed. Hugely. Impressed. You're one of us now, come right on in,
 just over there, to the west. See the door? To the casino? That way."

>go west


 Having impressed the ogre by literally selling your own mother, you
 walk triumphantly towards the casino. A smartly dressed steward comes
 out to greet you and leads you towards the building.

 But he keeps walking: around the entrance to the game floor, back
 behind the parking ramp, down past the laundry area, and finally into
 the hotel through a rusty door at the rear of the building.

 "Congratulations," he says gleefully, handing you a dish towel, "and
 welcome to senior management."

 A tower of dirty dishes looms next to you, tilting precariously
 alongside an industrial-sized sink fully of opaque, gray water in the
 steamy hotel kitchen.

 You are Pia, wielding a sharp blade, and wearing some well-made armor
 crafted by your brother Piet. Piet who, unfortunately, is facing you
 right now in combat, wielding the accursed Thornblade - the weapon
 that you found abandoned, that you suggested Piet could wield, that
 you should have recognized as a tool of corruption. This is all your
 fault.


 In the last moment, you hesitate, the realization of what you are
 about to do weighing you down. Are you really going to kill your
 brother? Though you have convinced yourself that it would be
 deliverance, with that accursed blade having corrupted him, part of
 you still wonders whether you really did your best trying to save him
 from the Thornblade's curse...

 Piet, it turns out, has no qualms. He lunges at you, and as your
 vision turns to red, you see the Thornblade sticking out of a weak
 spot of your armor. ... of course... he was the one who forged it...

 Your brother wields the evil, cursed Thornblade. Its corruption has
 taken a clear toll on him. His eyes shine with hatred, his face
 twisted into a seemingly permanent snarl. He wears some crudely-made
 ring mail, something he would have never done before his corruption.

 In the last moment, you hesitate, the realization of what you are
 about to do weighing you down. Are you really going to kill your

 Gritting your teeth, you rush at Piet. Almost as if it had its own
 mind, your blade moves, and with a sickening sound, it finds your
 brother's stomach. He looks at you in surprise, his eyes free from the
 corruption that had taken him. "Why, Pia?" he whispers as his blood
 stains your hands. "Was there no other way?" These words echo in your
 head much louder than Piet spoke them.

 You give Piet a shove with more whomp than you intended, and of
 course, Piet falls backwards and starts to bawl. "Mommy!" he shouts,
 "Pia pushed me!"
 "What the?!" To say mother is angry when she hears what happened is
 putting it mildly. "You two promised me that you wouldn't play in the
 old yard! And especially not pushing each other around! I thought I
 could trust you! C'mere, Piet, let me look at that. Doesn't look too
 bad, but we're driving to the doctor's just in case. And you, young
 lady, are grounded for four weeks. Think about what you've done."

 (Did you know?) There are three foes that you might face after
 (re)starting.

>xyzzy

 You mutter the ancient words that you've learned from the strange
 hermit, not expecting a whole lot, but your surroundings fade away,
 leaving you and your brother in a strange gray void along with a third
 figure, hulking, thorny, towering. The curse of the Thornblade
 incarnate. Alone, you would not be able to defeat it. But in this
 realm, your brother is free. You two make quick eye contact, nod, and
 explode into teamwork that you thought long forgotten. It is another
 long battle, but you two end up victorious, the curse of the
 Thornblade fading with the gray realm.
 Back in the real world, Piet tosses the blade down, trampling it until
 it breaks like wood, and looks at his hand. "I'll bring you to a
 priest who'll heal those wounds, brother." you promise, but he shakes
 his head. "Those wounds run deep. I'm not sure there is a healer
 strong enough to treat them within a few days' travel." - "There is. I
 brought her with me."

>take blade

 (the Thornblade)
 A quick feint and a step towards your brother. Piet doesn't step away
 as you draw closer, so you strike another feint that your brother
 tries to parry with the Thornblade - which is exactly what you were
 hoping for. You catch it with your other hand, its thorns burying deep
 into your flesh, its curse flowing into your veins. "Pia? What are
 you..."
 "Piet." you interrupt his brief moment of clarity. "Together, we're
 stronger. Stronger than the curse. Right?"

 Of course, you aren't. Over the next few days, the Thornblade reshapes
 itself back into a blade held by the two of you. The blade's terror
 though has more than doubled.

 (Have you tried?) You can refer to the shovel as a spade. Pia doesn't
 like that much, but obliges anyway.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Old Yard</span>
 The old yard of your family, spacious, and overgrown with weed. No one
 has tended it in ages. Seeing it in this condition almost makes you
 weep.

 Abandoned when your family broke up, an old shovel lies nearby.

 Your foe, your brother, Piet... he is standing there, the Thornblade
 grown into his hand. His eyes betray his irreversible corruption... or
 do they?

 In the last moment, you hesitate, the realization of what you are
 about to do weighing you down. Are you really going to kill your
 brother? Though you have convinced yourself that it would be
 deliverance, with that accursed blade having corrupted him, part of
 you still wonders whether you really did your best trying to save him

>attack blade

 (the Thornblade)
 Yes, maybe that's the right move. It is the Thornblade's dark curse
 that had caused you so much trouble. And it's your fault that Piet is
 wielding that dreadful weapon. Yes, a quick swing at the blade
 should... splinter it like wood? No, it splintered rather like bone,
 you realize, and see it bleeding. Piet's face pales fast and he
 collapses, and you guess the tragic truth - the Thornblade didn't just
 grow into your brother's hand. It became a part of his body, an
 extension. Destroying the blade was rather like cutting off Piet's
 hand, and here and now, this is a death sentence for him. "Pia." he
 manages to whisper. He doesn't have the power for more.

 (Did you know?) You can refer to your foe as "foe!". There are four
 short lines of text dedicated to stripping out the exclamation sign.

>take spade

 (No, shovel.)

 Taken.

 "I don't wanna play fighters, I wanna play pirates!" you shout, shovel
 in hand, and Piet yells excitedly. The two of you dig a few small
 holes, excited about every little bit of rubbish you manage to find,
 and especially about the few coins that managed to find their way into
 the old yard. Sharing fairly, both of you manage about two dollars,
 and remain tight-lipped about your windfall. After all, you promised

>sing

 The ancient tune you've learned demands to be sung, so you begin to
 hum it. Uncertain, your brother takes a few steps back, holding the
 Thornblade in front of his as if it were a shield. The song has risen
 to a chant, and the world beyond the yard seems to fade away.
 Realizing what you must be planning, Piet begins to charge, but your
 voice rises to the level of a chorus and keeps him at bay, even
 pushing him back. You try to whisper an apology in between verses, but
 it remains a thought as the yard in front of you, Piet in front of
 you, fades beyond black. The song reaches its climax as you fall back
 into reality with half of the old yard, and the rest falls into
 another plane. No longer holding back your tears, you say your
 goodbyes.

 "This is stupid!" you shout. "I want out of this stupid game! I want
 out of this stupid armor!" You begin tearing up the cardboard armor
 with a mixture of malicious glee and shameful guilt. After all, he
 made it for you, and made it quite well - it almost looked like real
 armor before you began tearing it. Piet watches you open-mouthed, and
 quickly starts bawling as he runs home.
 Mother is soon chewing you out. Not only did you destroy the armor
 Piet created for you, you were playing in the old yard, which you had
 promised not to do. You'll be grounded for a while. Piet, too, but not
 for as long. That's good. It wasn't his fault, after all. It was

 Gritting your teeth, you rush at Piet, vaulting at him at the last
 second and closing your eyes. As you bring down your blade where
 Piet's head should be, you feel searing, horrifying pain - your

>kill mom

 You can't see any such thing.

>kiss piet

 You feint, dodge, and weave until you are close to Piet. Your plan is
 a desperate one, inspired by the stories you heard as a kid, what
 feels like eons ago. But when everything else has failed, what else
 can you try than the old, seemingly outlandish ideas? The power of
 love, the power of the kiss, it is your last hope. You grab the wrist
 of the hand holding the Thornblade to keep Piet from using it, and
 kiss your brother on the forehead, on the cheek, even on the lips, and
 take a few steps back. Piet blinks a bit, smiles, and beckons you
 closer. Did you do it? You step closer full of hope, until Piet
 quickly moves to stab you, barely dodging out of the way in time. Your
 brother's face has turned into a grimace of rage, and you run, fast,
 fighting back the tears and the realization that your last hope of
 saving your brother has failed.

>go east

 You quickly take a step aside, beginning to circle around Piet, and he
 does likewise. A feint quick causes your brother to stumble. This
 should be your chance - a quick stab, and the tyranny of the cursed
 blade is over. One step... backwards. You just can't do it. Even
 though all this is your fault. Especially because all this your fault.
 Another step backwards changes into you quickly turning around,
 running away from the old yard and from your brother.

 (the blade at your brother)
 Gritting your teeth, you rush at Piet. Almost as if it had its own
 mind, your blade moves, and with a sickening sound, it finds your
 brother's stomach. He looks at you in surprise, his eyes free from the
 corruption that had taken him. "Why, Pia?" he whispers as his blood
 stains your hands. "Was there no other way?" These words echo in your
 head much louder than Piet spoke them.

>fly

>plugh

 You mutter the ancient words that you've learned from the strange
 hermit, not expecting a whole lot, but your surroundings fade away,
 leaving you and your brother in a strange gray void along with a third
 figure, hulking, thorny, towering. The curse of the Thornblade
 incarnate. Alone, you would not be able to defeat it. But in this
 realm, your brother is free. You two make quick eye contact, nod, and
 explode into teamwork that you thought long forgotten. It is another
 long battle, but you two end up victorious, the curse of the
 Thornblade fading with the gray realm.
 Back in the real world, Piet tosses the blade down, trampling it until
 it breaks like wood, and looks at his hand. "I'll bring you to a
 priest who'll heal those wounds, brother." you promise, but he shakes
 his head. "Those wounds run deep. I'm not sure there is a healer
 strong enough to treat them within a few days' travel." - "There is. I
 brought her with me."

 "I don't want to play." you mutter, sitting down by the weeds. You
 think about how your family lost the yard in the first place, how
 uncle screwed you all over. And once again, you come to the conclusion
 that it is, ultimately, your fault. If you hadn't blabbed, uncle would
 never have gotten the idea, you're sure. Piet sits down next to you,
 putting his arm around your shoulder and again tries to tell you that
 it isn't your fault.

 Piet and you stare each other in the eyes, each of you determined to
 not show any weakness. It is your brother - or what's left of him -
 who breaks eye contact as he rushes at you. You're prepared. You dodge
 out of his way, letting yourself fall, and slash at his legs. Quickly,
 you get back to your feet, hold your blade in both hands to deliver
 the coup de grace... and you look down at your brother, grimacing in
 pain. You can't do it. You just can't. Your feet carry you away from
 the old yard, away from your brother, away from the chance to end the
 threat of the Thornblade.

 should... splinter it like wood? No, it splintered rather like bone,
 you realize, and see it bleeding. Piet's face pales fast and he
 collapses, and you guess the tragic truth - the Thornblade didn't just
 grow into your brother's hand. It became a part of his body, an
 extension. Destroying the blade was rather like cutting off Piet's
 hand, and here and now, this is a death sentence for him. "Pia." he

 A tall, deathly pale woman with flowing red hair and sharp, long
 canines. This creature is a vampire, and not just any vampire. The red
 queen is an ancient affront to Hielon, god of the sun. Not only is she
 one of the vampires capable of surviving his gaze, she once was his
 high priest before her betrayal. She is wearing a red dress that,
 though you've struck many wounds on the red queen (that have quickly
 mended), shows no signs of gashes.

 As you continue looking around, your disgust with your environment
 wells up to unexpected heights. It is enough to cause you physical
 pain and nausea. Nausea strong enough to cause you to vomit. Falling
 to your knees, you hear the laughter of the red queen as she draws a
 dagger from Hielon knows where and slits your throat.

 Beginning with a hum, you begin a liturgy that has been sealed for an
 eternity, and for good reason. It may have been an important
 contributor to the Chaos Age, and using it runs the risk of repeating
 that dark age. But it has been unsealed somehow, and you feel that it
 may have been for this fight specifically. As your liturgy reaches its
 climax, it seems that the red queen realizes what this liturgy will
 do, even if it predates her by ages. "Fool! Stop this at once! This
 will destroy..."
 But it is too late. Hielon enters this world, in violation of the
 Covenant of Eternity, and light obliterates you, and your immediate
 surroundings.

 (Did you know?) There are three foes that you might face after
 (re)starting.

>xyzzy

 With a hollow voice, you intone a magical word.

 As you continue looking around, your disgust with your environment
 wells up to unexpected heights. It is enough to cause you physical
 pain and nausea. Nausea strong enough to cause you to vomit. Falling
 to your knees, you hear the laughter of the red queen as she draws a
 dagger from Hielon knows where and slits your throat.

>kiss queen

 An aura of temptation washes over you, and the red queen asks with a
 smile "You are a mighty warrior indeed, but is war not such a dreadful
 business? Would you not rather be a lover?" She really must have a low
 opinion of the followers of her former church. The wave of temptation
 was nowhere strong enough to even make a dent in your willpower.
 "You are by far less fair than my husband, by far less passionate than
 my wife, by far less adorable than our children. There is nothing you
 can offer to me to replace even one of them, let alone all five of
 them." As you speak, the red queen's face becomes more and more
 distorted with anger and hatred, and she dives at you. You
 instinctively throw a punch, and are surprised to actually see a
 bruise developing on your foe's face, and before you can react to
 figure out what caused the bruise, the red queen has muttered a word
 and fades to another location.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blood Tower</span>
 The throne room of the Blood Tower is a mockery to your god Hielon.
 Open to the sky, as if its inhabitant weren't the vilest of vampires,
 and a throne made of skulls and bones with rays much like those of the
 sun symbols your church uses.

 Floating near the dark throne is your foe, the mockery of your god,
 the red queen.

>sit on throne

 Barreling past the red queen, you approach her throne. Your first
 inclination is to destroy it as you feel a wave of disgust. But you
 quickly recognize the disgust as the result of an incantation, surely
 intended to make you attack the throne. So instead, you sit on it.


 ...


 Instantly, you recognize the truth. The red queen has been right all
 along. You have been but a slave to Hielon, the other gods, the
 church, and your family, even. You eagerly accept a place at the red
 queen side.

 (Did you know?) You can refer to your foe as "foe!". There are four
 short lines of text dedicated to stripping out the exclamation sign.

 Even though the red queen seems unimpressed by your attacks, it is the
 only option you truly have at this moment. You have basically no
 orisons or smites left to call upon, no vials of holy water to toss at
 the vampiric blaphemy. Nothing but your blade... and that one orison

>destroy throne

 It seems clear that the dark throne holds dread power. Perhaps it
 holds the power that protects the red queen from your blade's attacks.
 You rush past her, striking and severing one of the rib-crafted sun
 rays, and another, then jump backwards as the red queen dives at you.
 Instinctively, you hit her with your sword, and with grim
 satisfaction, you see a small wound on her cheek, smaller than you
 would normally expect, but it is there.
 "You do not know what powers you are toying with, mortal worm!" the
 red queen shouts. "By damaging the throne, you have allowed a creature
 more powerful and destructive than me access to our world, and it is
 on its way already." Paying no heed to what you think a transparent
 attempt to save her life, you continue to damage the throne, and when
 it is nearly completely destroyed, the red queen dies to your sword,
 and you return home triumphantly.

>turn throne

 Though you are no priest, you do have a weak ability to harm the
 undead. Vampires are usually too powerful to be affected, but perhaps
 if you concentrate on the dark throne, you might be able to destroy it
 and whatever vile influence it provides. You channel your devotion to
 Hielon and direct it at the dark throne, but you feel that it is
 absorbed by the throne rather than harming it. Before you can react, a
 pulse of vile energy radiates from the throne, and disgust overcomes
 you. You fall to your knees and vomit, and the red witch approaches
 with a dagger, cackling evilly, dagger in hand.

           <span class="floydstyle i">*** Your blessings have turned into a curse. ***</span>

>examine queen

 A tall, deathly pale woman with flowing red hair and sharp, long
 canines. This creature is a vampire, and not just any vampire. The red
 queen is an ancient affront to Hielon, god of the sun. Not only is she
 one of the vampires capable of surviving his gaze, she once was his
 high priest before her betrayal. She is wearing a red dress that,
 though you've struck many wounds on the red queen (that have quickly
 mended), shows no signs of gashes.

 As you continue looking around, your disgust with your environment
 wells up to unexpected heights. It is enough to cause you physical
 pain and nausea. Nausea strong enough to cause you to vomit. Falling
 to your knees, you hear the laughter of the red queen as she draws a
 dagger from Hielon knows where and slits your throat.

 It feels silly, but you start the dance that you were taught. It is a
 fluid one, seamlessly allowing you to dodge away from the red queen's
 assaults. It is a long dance, though, and exhaustion begins to set in,
 and the red queen pins you down right at the end. She rips apart your
 gorget and is about to tear your throat as the tower shakes and it
 appears over the walls. The elder treant with a vast vendetta against
 the red queen. It grabs her, instantly sealing her head in resin. You

 my wife, by far less adorable than our children. There is nothing you
 can offer to me to replace even one of them, let alone all five of
 them." As you speak, the red queen's face becomes more and more
 distorted with anger and hatred, and she dives at you. You
 instinctively throw a punch, and are surprised to actually see a
 bruise developing on your foe's face, and before you can react to
 figure out what caused the bruise, the red queen has muttered a word
 and fades to another location.

 Maybe things could have gone differently...

 The noon sun burns hot even with the wind rushing through your hair.
 Catching a quick glance of your reflection in your sword, you quickly
 return your attention to the important matter at hand - your foe. It
 has been a long battle, but now the advantage is yours. It is time to

 The rays of the morning sun tickle your face, waking you up. That's a
 pleasant surprise - the forecast said it would be rainy for days.
 However, looking out of the window, you see that there are no clouds
 in the sky. How did they get it so wrong?

 It's quiet and peaceful. Out of habit, you reach for your mobile
 phone on the nightstand to browse through the morning headlines. Still
 lying down in your bed, covering your eyes from the sun with one hand,
 you start scrolling down the newsfeed when a headline catches your
 attention: "Half-Life 3 Confirmed!"

 Quickly, you sit  up.  For a moment you feel a huge sense of
 happiness. The long-awaited sequel of your favourite action game is
 finally going to come true. More monsters to shoot! More headcrabs to
 bash with your crowbar! Finally expel the <span class="floydstyle em">Combine</span> from the
 face of the Earth? Soon afterwards, however, you come to your senses.
 No way is any of that going to happen. Reality, you realize with
 sudden alarm, must be seriously warped.

 You become fully awake and alert. This is no laughing matter. Your
 primary task is to get safely - or at least alive - out of the
 building. And if you're lucky enough, maybe sort out this reality
 enwarpment and restore matters to normal.

  You get up and dressed quickly. There is no time to lose.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 Your bedroom looks normal enough. Well, now that you take a second
 look, maybe that black hole in the floor shouldn't really be there.
 Beside your bed is a small nightstand. A wardrobe stands opposite your
 bed and there's a writing desk by the window. There is a door in the
 northeastern corner of the room, leading to the hallway.

>examine me


 Thankfully, you notice nothing out of the ordinary.

>examine hole


 It seems to be some kind of vortex that you might try to enter. The
 question is - would that be a wise thing to do?

>get hole


 That's hardly portable.

>open wardrone


 You can't see any such thing.

>open wardrone


 You can't see any such thing.

>open wardrobe


 You see a snowy landscape behind the clothes hanging inside the
 wardrobe. No, it's just the back wall, after all.

 You close the wardrobe.

> x nightstand


 The small white-painted nightstand has one drawer in it.

>open drawer


 It's locked.
 Strange; you usually keep it open, with the key in the lock. But the
 key is not in the lock presently.

>inventory


 You're carrying a mobile phone.

>call gabe newell


 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine desk


 Ordinarily nothing special. But today somebody has drawn a treasure
 map on it.

>examine map


 There is a big X on the right side, or the east side, of an irregular
 line which you take to be a river or a road. The X is inside a circle,
 but it is impossible to guess what the circle represents. The whole
 map is probably a hoax.

>get map


 That's hardly portable. Instead, you memorize the map. (To refer to
 the map, RECALL it.)

>look under bed


 You find nothing of interest.

>look under desk

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The hallway</span>
 The hallway connects all the rooms in your apartment. The living-room
 is to the east while the kitchen is to the west and your bedroom is to
 the southwest.  Rather unnervingly, the front door leading out, to the
 south, seems to have disappeared completely. Somewhat unexpectedly,
 there seems to be an extra room to the north.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The kitchen</span>
 On the kitchen table are some leftovers of the pizza that you ordered
 last night but couldn't finish. The hallway is to the east.

 A pig is standing on its hind legs, leaning against the kitchen table
 and eating the leftovers of the pizza.

 A stove stands in the corner.

 You can also see a fridge (closed) here.

>examine pig


 A fat pig is standing on its hind legs, leaning against the kitchen
 table and eating away. Too bad you didn't bother putting the leftover
 bits of last night's pizza into the fridge. Then again, you didn't
 expect a pig.

 with somebody.

 You cannot reach the fridge presently - the fat pig blocks the way. It
 makes an angry squeal when you make a gesture of approaching it.

>examine pizza


 You see nothing special about the leftovers.

>examine stove


 The four burners flash in bright neon colours - red, blue, green and
 orange. It is rather unsettling.

>ride pig


 That's not a verb I recognise.

 There are some pizza leftovers on the table.

>open stove


 It isn't something you can open.

 Normally it is of course a charming living-room. You see a sofa, a

 On the table is a small key.

 You can also see a mud monster here.

>examine monster


 It's little more than a pile of mud. It has no legs but  you are able
 to distinguish a pair of limbs that might pass as arms. It has a
 barely discernible face but you are not sure if it has eyes. It
 loiters silently in the middle of the room. Drops of mud are dripping
 from it onto your exquisite carpet. So not cool.

 on the screen, accompanied by good old-style march music. Is that
 Sousa?

 You try to turn off the television but can't.

 There's a time to relax and a time to save the world. This is the
 latter, and the sofa is not needed for that.

>examine window


 Through the tenth-floor window, you make out the outline of the city
 and its numerous high-rises, similar to the one you live in. The city
 looks the same as usual - well, not quite. There are a couple of tall
 buildings in the distance that weren't there yesterday. It's eerily
 quiet - no sounds of traffic.

 It isn't something you can open.

 Something tells you it's not the time yet. You need to prepare

>take leftovers.


 On second thought, you decide not to.

>kill pig


 The pig turns to you angrily and flashes its fierce red eyes at you.
 Then it notices the tail of your T-shirt where you wiped your fingers
 last night - you ate a chocolate bar and wiped your messy fingers on
 the shirt. The pig smells the chocolate and starts tugging at your
 shirt. Ecch. Should have put on a clean shirt today.

 You give a slap to the irritating creature, but it just starts tugging
 your shirt again. Now isn't that sweet.

 You don't dare to open the fridge while the pig is in the kitchen. If

 There is an automatic message: "Sorry, I cannot take your call right
 now. Please leave a message after the beep. If you're one of my
 students making a prank call, please leave your message after the
 second beep." There's a beep. You wait for a while, but the second
 beep never comes. He got you alright.

 Chuck Norris is not afraid of warped realities. On the contrary, if
 Chuck Norris is unsatisfied with reality, he warps it himself until
 he's happy with it.

 Encouraged by remembering this, you dial his number, but there is no
 answer. Then you remember that Chuck Norris doesn't need to answer the
 phone. He already knows what you'd be going to say.

 "Sorry, closed due to reality enwarpment." At least they're up to date
 with things. (And seems like "enwarpment" indeed is a word now.)

 Your white, exquisite living-room carpet is stained with mud that has
 been dripping from the monster.

>pull carpet


 You pull the carpet forcefully. The mud monster loses its balance and
 form. Soon there is nothing else left but a puddle of mud on the
 floor. That was handled elegantly -- well, almost. You can't really be
 happy with the floor all covered in brown sludge.

 You can't see any such thing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The hallway</span>
 The hallway connects all the rooms in your apartment. The living-room
 is to the east while the kitchen is to the west and your bedroom is to

 south, seems to have disappeared completely. Somewhat unexpectedly,
 there seems to be an extra room to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The kitchen</span>
 On the kitchen table are some leftovers of the pizza that you ordered
 last night but couldn't finish. The hallway is to the east.

 A pig is standing on its hind legs, leaning against the kitchen table
 and eating the leftovers of the pizza.

 A stove stands in the corner.

 You can also see a fridge (closed) here.

>attack pig


 The pig turns to you angrily and flashes its fierce red eyes at you.
 Then it notices the tail of your T-shirt where you wiped your fingers
 last night - you ate a chocolate bar and wiped your messy fingers on
 the shirt. The pig smells the chocolate and starts tugging at your
 shirt. Ecch. Should have put on a clean shirt today.

 There is a big puddle of mud on the floor.

 On the table is a small key.

 The pig follows you, tugging at your T-shirt.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Jazz Club</span>
 You live in a normal condominium building with definitely no jazz club
 anywhere in it. Anyway, here you are, in a smoky, atmospheric club
 with a lazy crowd in murky tables - murky because of the thick
 cigarette smoke present. From here you can go down, back to your
 apartment.

 Three accordion players are performing on a small stage.

 A small birdcage stands near the stage.

 It's a small metal cage.

 In the cage is a canary bird.

 of whiskey in exchange. Fair, ha?"

>give whiskey to player


 You give the bottle of whiskey to the band. They thank you and one of
 them says:

 "Here, have this bird as a token of our gratitude. Take good care of
 it; it has accompanied us in some very dark places. May it bring you
 luck in your times of distress, too."

  They hand the cage to you.

>enter hole


 You feel now that you ready to enter the vortex. With the small bird
 as your companion, what harm could possibly happen to you?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tenth floor landing</span>
 You're standing outside your apartment, on the tenth floor landing of
 the condominium.  In a way, finding yourself here is a sort of
 anticlimax; on the other hand, you're happy that you managed to escape
 from your apartment. Some doors leading to other apartments on this
 floor are visible, but the front door of your apartment is still
 nowhere to be seen. Ordinarily a flight of stairs, to the left of the
 elevator, leads down and another one, to the right of the elevator,
 leads up. Presently, however, both flights of stairs have disappeared
 and there are just two abysses that you feel dizzy gazing into. Well,
 there's always the elevator. Conveniently, it happens to be right
 here.

>examine elevator


 The elevator is empty.

>enter elevator


 Finding no other sensible alternative, you decide to enter the
 elevator.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the elevator</span>
 You're inside the elevator. There are only two buttons, up and down.
 That should make things simple.

>push up


 (the up button)
 Nothing happens.

>push down


 (the down button)
 The floor opens and you fall down!  Taken by surprise, you lose hold
 of the birdcage.

 You fall down helplessly. Soon enough, you plunge in deep water.

 The bottom of the shaft seems to be filled with water.  After a short
 while, you manage to swim up to the surface.  The cage is floating on
 the water and you grab it again. Seems the bird survived the fall
 relatively unharmed. However, you notice that you've lost your other
 belongings.

 There is an open doorway between the elevator shaft and the ground
 floor corridor - the door itself seems to have disappeared. You swim
 to the doorway and get out of the shaft.

 Even in the ground floor corridor, the floor is wet. You walk out of
 the front door and leave the building.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the condominium high-rise</span>
 You  are standing outside your condominium building, knee-deep in
 water. No streets are visible; the water covers the entire
 landscape.The surrounding high-rises sway high above like giant reeds
 in the wind.

>go west


 You deem it not worth starting to walk randomly in the knee-deep
 water. Also, entering any of the buildings around you looks highly
 unsafe.

 Out of nowhere, a small boat without any oars floats into your reach.

>enter boat


 You get into the boat.

 A strong current leads the boat forward between the towering
 buildings. Soon you're out of town. Even the highest buildings
 disappear into the horizon, and there's nothing but water in sight.

 The current pushes the boat northward.

>wait


 Time passes.

 The current pushes the boat northward.

>examine cage


 It's a small metal cage.

 In the cage is a canary bird.

 The current pushes the boat northward.

 You see a tiny island looming in the horizon, to the north.

 A wedge of pigs, in a perfect V-formation, flies past far above your
 head and disappears into the horizon.

>wait


 Time passes.

 The current pushes the boat northward.

 The island is getting closer.

>wait


 Time passes.

 The current pushes the boat northward.

 The island is getting closer.

 Your boat reaches the island which now looks rather big; it must be
 over a mile wide. When the boat touches the ground, you get off it and
 wade to the shore.  A yawning hippopotamus appears from nowhere. The
 boat disappears in its huge jaws and the hippopotamus swims away.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Island shore</span>
 You are standing on the shore of an island. A path leads up the
 slightly ascending cliff to a wide red curtain, the kind you might see
 in a theatre.  The shore continues to the west and to the east.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">At a boat wreck</span>
 This is a particulary stony part of the shoreline. You can go back to
 the west to where you originally landed on the island, but the
 landscape becomes impassable in other direction due to thick
 vegetation.

 The wreck of a small cargo ship lies on the stones here.

 You can also see a crowbar here.

>get crowbar


 Taken.

>examine it


 It is a rusty old crowbar.

>examine wreck


 It is an old cargo vessel.  Some gunnysacks lie on the rocks around
 the wreck.

 You're carrying some sunflower seeds, a crowbar and a cage.

 You can also recall a map drawn on your bedroom desk.

>recall map


 You think about the treasure map you found drawn on your bedroom desk.
 There was an irregular line (a river or a road) going across the map ,
 and to the right, or east, of it was a big X. The X was inside a
 circle, but it was difficult to guess what the circle could represent.

 This is a small sandy stretch of the island shore. There's various
 flotsam and jetsam here. You can go back to the east to where you
 originally landed on the island, but the landscape becomes impassable
 in other directions due to steep cliffs.

 You can see a bowler hat here.

 You find a gap in the wide, red curtain and enter it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Theatre stage</span>
 You're standing alone on a large theatre stage. The house is full,
 with the audience waiting for your next move in the dark auditorium.
 Even the balconies, to the second and third floors, are seated to the
 last place. A fat, wealthy man sitting in one of the boxes eyes you
 through a pair of opera glasses. The red curtain is behind you.

 The audience bursts into a wild applause seeing you. You feel you have
 to give them your best shot. Now, let's see... you can sing, dance and
 whistle. Or at least you think you can.

 The audience shifts restlessly, waiting for your next move.

>dance


 You start your Vaudeville act. Wearing the bowler hat and using the
 crowbar as a makeshift cane, you manage to convince the crowd to an
 extent, in spite of your lacking dancing abilities. However, you
 shouldn't have opened your mouth; your singing and whistling are still
 abominable. Maybe you should find someone who is better at it than you
 are.

 You stop as the crowd boos angrily.

 The audience shifts restlessly, waiting for your next move.

>open cage


 You open the cage carefully and give some seeds for the canary bird to
 eat. It pecks them for a while and starts then chirping happily from
 its heart's content.

 The audience is stunned by the performance and is now waiting for you
 to complete the show.

 The audience shifts restlessly, waiting for your next move.

>whistle


 You start your Vaudeville act to the chirping of the bird. As it takes
 care of the singing/whistling part of the performance, your job is
 just to dance. Wearing the bowler hat and using the crowbar as a
 makeshift cane, you manage to convince the crowd in spite of your
 lacking dancing abilities. In fact, they are quite charmed, and the
 applause at the end of your one-man and one-bird show is deafening.

 Someone who looks like the theatre manager comes to the stage and
 shakes your hand.

 "That was absolutely fantastic", he congratulates, "now, please, let
 us escort you out."

 A horse-drawn carriage drawn by two white horses appears from the
 backstage and you enter it. The horses then lead the carriage down a
 ramp from the stage and pull the carriage through the central aisle of
 the auditorium while the crowd on both sides of the aisle claps in a
 standing ovation and shouts bravo.

 Once you're out of the main doors, you step out of the carriage. The
 horses disappear back into the theatre and the main doors close with a
 bang. Gosh, was that weird or what. Again, you're on your own.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Forest</span>
 You're on a north-south path in a forest. To the south is a theatre
 while to the north the path disappears into the trees. The theatre
 itself seems to be in the middle of the forest, a cultural oddity in
 the general wilderness of things.

 Someone has left a shovel here.

>get shovel


 You try to pull the shovel out of the ground, but it is stuck
 surprisingly stubbornly. The task is made the more difficult as the
 handle is missing. As you keep pulling, the shaft of the shovel comes
 loose. The blade remains in the soil and cannot be retrieved. You take
 a look at the dark shaft you're holding. It has a white end that was
 not visible when the shovel still was intact. Hey, it's a magic wand!

 There is a loud sound, and the ground is shaking. Somewhere nearby, a
 meteorite must have hit the ground.

>examine wand


 It is magic wand with a black shaft and a white end.

>wave wand


 Nothing happens.

 A bright ball of fire is seen falling from the sky in the distance and
 splashing into the sea far away from here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Near a tree by a river</span>
 This is a grassy stretch of land, near a lonely tree. To the south is
 a forest and to the northwest you see a small bare hill. A river flows
 from the north to the south, to your east. A path leads south. In
 other directions, the landscape becomes more difficult to pass.

 A meteorite shoots across the sky and disappears into the horizon.

>go northwest


 Before going anywhere from here, you feel you need to examine this
 place a bit closer.

 It's a thin, leafy tree; you can't recognize the species. There is a
 small nest on one of the lower branches.

>examine nest


 The small nest, made of grass and leaves, is empty.

 The canary bird starts chirping excitedly when you go nearer the nest.

 A meteorite shoots across the sky and disappears into the horizon.

>open cage


 You open the cage. The small canary bird flies into the nest. After a
 moment you notice that it has started to hatch an egg. The egg grows
 abnormally big. A strong, sudden gust of wind blows the egg out of the
 nest and it falls onto the ground, breaking and revealing a human
 head. The small bird is startled and flies to the top of the tree. The
 head is that of an old man with orange hair and an orange beard. It
 quickly grows to a natural size and, jutting on the ground, starts to
 orate with a loud, pealing voice:

 "Beware. These are perilous times. The asteroid belt is colliding
 with the orbit of the Earth, and consequently the stars are falling.
 Only when the green crystal of Drunral is retrieved and returned to
 the pedestal on top of Mount Ganerva, can peace and order be restored.
 Go, fool!" the head almost screams. "There's no time to lose!"

 The head stops talking. A passing eagle grabs it and as it is flying
 away, the head shouts: "Doom! Doom!" before disappearing altogether.

>go northeast


 You can't go that way.

 In the bright daylight, you see a shooting star in the sky as a big
 meteor enters the atmosphere and burns.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mount Ganerva</span>
 You're standing on the top of a small hill. This must be "Mount
 Ganerva" referred to by the talking head, as there are no other
 elevated places on the whole island. You can go southeast, down the
 slope. In other directions the slope is too difficult to climb down.
 In all directions you see a forested island, at least three miles
 wide.You see a couple of deep craters in the distance, billowing
 smoke.

 A pedestal stands empty on top the hill.

 You pick up the crystal from the ground and admire its brightness
 against the sunlight.

>examine crystal


 It is a beautiful crystal emanating green light.

 In the bright daylight, you see a shooting star in the sky as a big
 meteor enters the atmosphere and burns.

>out



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the circus arena</span>
 You are standing just outside an outdoor circus ring. There are low
 wooden railings, up to the height of one meter, around the arena, so
 it is rather easy to enter.  From here you can go northwest to the
 river crossing, or you could try to enter the arena proper.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the eastern bank of the river</span>
 The grassy stretch of land continues here. The forest is some way off
 in all directions except to the west where you see open grassland and
 a lone tree across the river. There is a hut a short way to the north
 and a round structure to the southeast.

 A narrow plank spans the river.

 A bright ball of fire is seen falling from the sky in the distance and
 splashing into the sea far away from here.

>go west


 You walk across the plank.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Near a tree by a river</span>
 This is a grassy stretch of land, near a lonely tree. To the south is
 a forest and to the northwest you see a small bare hill. A river flows
 from the north to the south, to your east. A path leads south. In
 other directions, the landscape becomes more difficult to pass.

 The canary bird is singing happily in the tree.

 A narrow plank now spans the river.

>go west


 You can't go that way.

 A meteorite shoots across the sky and disappears into the horizon.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mount Ganerva</span>
 You're standing on the top of a small hill. This must be "Mount
 Ganerva" referred to by the talking head, as there are no other
 elevated places on the whole island. You can go southeast, down the
 slope. In other directions the slope is too difficult to climb down.
 In all directions you see a forested island, at least three miles
 wide.You see a couple of deep craters in the distance, billowing
 smoke.

 A pedestal stands empty on top the hill.

>put crystal on pedestal


 You place the crystal onto the pedestal. It fits perfectly into a
 small, almost unnoticeable dent in it. Something clicks, and the
 crystal starts to glow a bright green light.

 Soon, an alien vessel descends from the sky, zapping a couple of
 passing meteorites into dust as it approaches. A platform is lowered
 from the bottom of the craft, and two figures clad in grey costumes
 walk out.

 "Greetings, earthling!" they say, "greetings from Drunral. You have
 summoned us and we have come. Our fleet will protect the Earth from
 further asteroids and meteorites; worry not. And as you did the heroic
 deed of summoning us, how about a cruise to our planet? We might be
 boring-looking but we sure know how to party! Oh, the endless disco
 nights and hot beach holidays! The unbelievable student bacchanals!
 We'll bring you back in a year's time. Don't you think you've deserved
 a break?!"

 You can't argue that. Stepping onto the platform and ascending into
 the ship, you walk amidst the two strangers, putting your arms around
 their shoulders.

 "Gentlemen," you say, "I think this the beginning of a beautiful
 friendship."

 Man, what a relief. The Time Rangers finally reset all that damage
 that you and Paul and basically everyone did to the timeline faster
 than you can say "soft reboot". Now you and him are living back in
 your old house without having to worry about anything. (Well, Uncle
 Wally is still on the loose "somewhen"). So things have been mundane,
 kind of, but now it's Paul's birthday coming up and he wishes for a
 Neptunian deathhound (So I guess they didn't reset the whole alien
 encounter thing? Let's, uh, just roll with it). You've ordered one
 through the transmat delivery service. It's just one button press

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living room</span>
 This is a spacious, cozy room, which one of those big, expensive TV.
 The two couches have been moved to the wall to make room for the
 teleportation pad.

 One of Paul's romance novels is lying on one of the couch.

>examine novel

 Ugh. Paul bought another of these self-published amazon novels - "The
 candlemaker's son". Fiargo, the handsome and shirtless candlemaker's
 son is supposed to marry dull but reliable banker Otuso. Then the
 travelling artist Blaskeci comes to town and decides Fiagro deserves
 something better, fights for his love. Sounds like he's trying to
 steal him from Otuso? But for some reason you're supposed to root for
 Blaskeci? Not your kind of thing in any case. The cover depicts a
 pretty exciting swordfight at the opera. Man, you wish you could VISIT
 to watch it first hand.

>examine tv

 The TV is currently switched off.

>examine pad

 You see nothing special about the teleportation pad.

>turn on tv

 As you switch on the TV, you see the president. Oh man!

 You remember how the Time Rangers made a last, minor change to the
 timeline, as a thank you. You don't envy the poor suckers in the other
 timeline.

>examine president

 You can't see any such thing.

>visit novel

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>visit fiargo

>visit opera

 You touch the book cover and get sucked into it.
 Or, I guess, you remember the cover.
 (Magic? This universe has magic now? Whatever.)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Opera</span>
 You are  in an opera box with direct view of the stage. However,
 nobody is paying any attention to the play because there is a sword
 fight going on in the box to the left, while someone you take to be
 Fiargo (why is he shirtless at the opera?) is in a box to the right.

 A magnificient chandelier hangs a few feet from your box, perfectly
 between the other two, filling the whole building with warm, golden
 light.

 He is kind of handsome and looks a bit like you. That makes you happy.
 To bad he isn't better implemented.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Glass savannah</span>
 Black glass as far as the eye can see makes up the surface of this
 planet. (It really doesn't, though, you're just in the savannah part
 of Alpha Centauri). You are standing behind some crates, out of view.

 A small cage of black steel is standing here, housing a Centaurian
 flopperglomper.

 A figure stands here, it's shape not easily understandable by your
 eyes.

 A plasma rifle is lying on one of the crates.

>take rifle

 Oh no! You gave up killing people for lent. Better not tempt yourself.

>examine rifle

 Oh, it's one of those duracellium powered ones, with the funny off
 switch.

 The plasma rifle is currently switched on.

>turn off rifle

 Click. The plasma rifle powers down with a barely audible beep and the
 ammo counter displays a frowny face for a second.

 You switch the plasma rifle off.

>take rifle

 Oh no! You gave up killing people for lent. Better not tempt yourself.

>examine figure

 You do that thing you learnt from that watchmojo "Top 10 weirdest
 alien races you can actually meet" video: Look at him out of the
 corner of your eye. Oh, judgeing by the size of his ears he is a
 Tadmorian. Oh, these guys are all ruthless Game hunters. Well, you
 guess they must have scientists and nannies and stuff, but who cares
 about those. Anyway, this guy seems to be a Game hunter and pretty
 pleases with himself. That looks the same all around the universe.

>examine cage

 A firm steel cage, big enough for say, uh, a Neptunian death hound.
 (Apologies if this is an insulting level of hinting - better safe than
 sorry!). It can be bolted to the floor, if necessary, but it seems to
 miss its screws.

 In the steel cage is a centaurian flopperglomper.

>examine flopperglomper

 It's a ball, beachball-sized, brown with rust-colored spikes, and
 adorable little eyes that dart around constantly. It's so ridiculously
 ugly it's cute again, like a marabou. You're pretty sure they're
 supposed to have all died out, so this may be the last one in
 existence.

>open cage

 The flopperglomper rolls out of the cage and away into the distance.
 The Game Hunter shouts angrily in Tradmorian and grabs the rifle, aims
 it and -*click*
 You smirk as the Centauriam flopperglomper rolls towards the Game
 Hunter and impales him.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Ah, but little do you know that the Game hunter was also the last</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of his kind. Man, you are really impressed by how artfully this game</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">tackles ethical questions, and how craftily it elicts emotional</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">responses. It's almost like it's written in Twine.</span>

 With an anticlimatic *blop*, the Neptunian death hound has travelled
 the 2.7 billion miles from his home planet to here. Your joy about
 this is short lived, however, as the small, squat, pink and incredibly
 ugly beast jumps at you with a snarl. Not only does it's terrifying
 mouth open in four directions, revealing rows and rows of somewhat
 sharpish teeth, but as it jumps off the platform and bites off your
 face, you realize that its bite is fourth dimensional (and thus not
 covered by your health insurance). It not only eats you physically,
 but also metaphysically, and just for kicks deletes your twitter
 account.

 begins to drop and swing, so you decide to jump back to safety.
 You grab the edge of your box and pull yourself up, as behind you
 Baskeci feints and then jumps to the chandelier, shouting: "Fiargo!
 Let us be together!"
 Unfortunately, the last screws are not enough to carry the artist AND
 his ego, and the whole mess crashes down into the ranks, killing some
 people. Luckily, they were fictional.
 Otuso shouts : "Fiagro! Finally we can be together!"

 The ghost bites an Lipperheyians nose off. They grow back rather
 quickly, but how does he smell in the mean time?

>photograph ghost

 You take a nice picture of the ghost.

 The ghost claws a Taphao Thongian in half. You probably expect some
 joke here, but it's a quite horrifying mess.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The great Mausoleum of the 140th king</span>
 You are in the midst of the Venusian jungles. The great mauseoleum is
 roughly pyramid shaped and made from grey, mossy rock. And entryway
 leads inside to the southwest.

 The blackish, fuzzy form of a Venusian ghost looms here.

 Some alien tourists (just like yourself) mingle about.

 The ghost finally turns its horrifying visage towards you. *gulp*


     *** You have died (not pleasantly). ***

 Ok.

>examine rock

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gate

 A huge stone gate.You think you hear a faint voice from inside: "Alex?
 Alex, let me out."

 The ghost runs towards one of the scared tourists and bites off his
 head! Luckily, HD 219134b'ians have at least three. Nevertheless, they
 dropped their camera in shock.

>push triangle

 You can't reach that from here.

 The ghost jumps on top of a Dimidiumian and claws into her fiercely!
 Luckily, they are made of what scientists call "some sort of Jelly"
 and it doesn't hurt her that bad.

>examine triangle

 Ah, the symbol of the Venusian Illuminati. Legend goes it's the symbol
 of Ancient Aliens who visited Venus, sharing technology so ancient
 aliens from Venus could go to Earth and invent the pyramids, or
 something?

 The ghost bites an Lipperheyians nose off. They grow back rather
 quickly, but how does he smell in the mean time?

>open gate

 It isn't something you can open.

 The ghost claws a Taphao Thongian in half. You probably expect some

 Oh, it's from your old friend the Venusian warrior woman! (She was in
 "The Day I died", remember? No? Oh well.) She lived with your for a
 while and the moved back to Venus to become a tour guide at the
 Mausoleum of the 140th. You and Paul agreed you should VISIT her some
 day.

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

 The ghost bites an Lipperheyians nose off. They grow back rather

>examine camera

 It take a moment to get your head around a camera made for at least
 three heads, but then you realize they didn't take a photo of
 anywhere. No place new to visit. Nowhere to go.

 The ghost claws a Taphao Thongian in half. You probably expect some

>put camera on ghost

 Putting things on the ghost would achieve nothing.

>throw camera at ghost

 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

 You wave sarcastically at the ghost as you disappear. Good job! (We'll
 leave the ethical implications of leaving an "aware" being in eternal
 nothingness for the reviews.)

 That was easy!
 The stone gate opens. Amids a pile of slain guard ghosts stand the
 Venusian Warrior Woman, her body covered in scratches and wounds,
 breathing heavily, but alive!
 "How ... how did you defeat them?"
 "Please" she scoffs. "They were only men."
 You shrug. "Makes sense. So, I trust you can take care of things
 here?"
 "Sure, give my best to Paul. Oh, here." She hands you a small bone.
 "As a keepsake."
 "That's a very unarcheological thing to do."
 "What, you think that's from the crypt? It's from my dinner. I'm just
 messing with you." She hugs you goodbye and you get onto the space
 elevator.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living room</span>
 This is a spacious, cozy room, which one of those big, expensive TV.
 The two couches have been moved to the wall to make room for the
 teleportation pad.

 You can see a steel cage (closed) (in which are a brochure and a
 romance novel) here.

>examine bone

 A small bone, probably from a Venusian snail. Those are delicious.

>open cage

 You open the steel cage.

>put bone in cage

 You put the bone into the steel cage.

>close cage

 You close the steel cage.

>push button

 With an anticlimatic *blop*, the Neptunian death hound has travelled
 the 2.7 billion miles from his home planet to here. Your joy about
 this is short lived, however, as the small, squat, pink and incredibly
 ugly beast jumps at you with a snarl. Luckily it's in the steel cage.
 Even more lucky, it's bolted down so the dog is reduced to snarling
 constantly. It discovers the bone and chews on it happily. Aw, the
 first step on a long way to tame Neptune's apex predator.

 You luck up as something darkens the large display window of your
 living room. (Has that been there all the time? You haven't noticed it
 in 11 years.) Your musing are cut short as golf cart crushes through
 the window, you duck for cover as it screeches to a halt just inches
 from the cage.
 "Paul? What are you doing?"
 "Alex! Wait, is that a Neptunian death hound? Aww. But you shouldn't
 give pets as gifts."
 "WHY ARE YOU CRASHING A GOLF CART INTO OUR LIVING ROOM?"
 "So, remember that epilogue from the last game about Wally possessing
 Fenris?"
 The Neptunian death hound perks up as a wolf howls in the distance. Uh
 oh.
