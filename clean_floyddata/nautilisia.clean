 I know, I know I know, we're gonna be late. But here's the thing: I'm
 in a coma. Yeah.

 And my brain has put together this bizarre fantasy world, to try and
 keep me sane, or protect my fragile psyche from the trauma ofâ¦
 whatever the coma is about, and I can't wake up until I escape from
 the dream-world. And that's gonna take a while, because I am really
 comfortable. I mean in the dream-world and also in the real world,
 right here.

 So I don't have a lot of incentive. To wake up, I mean.
 So I don't have a lot of incentive. To wake up, I mean.Well, if you're
 gonna be so stubborn about it, you can come in the dream-world and
 solve all the extremely symbolic puzzles and "rescue" me from my
 delusions. I guess it's only fair to let you try.
 delusions. I guess it's only fair to let you try.But hold on. I said
 hold on! Let me think of a name. For the dream-world. It has to be
 sufficiently fantasy-sounding, but it also has to be obviously
 symbolic of something. Hmm.
 symbolic of something. Hmm.Okay, I've got it.

 symbolism, by Ryan Veeder
 Release 2 / Serial number 120519 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Yeah, it's a stupid name, but it's the best I can come up with.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stately Manor</span>
 Okay, so you start out in this stately manor. It's like stately Wayne
 manor, in that it's on top of a hill, and it's very expansive and full
 of expensive things, but there's no labyrinthine cave system
 underneath it. There's even a big grandfather clock in here, that
 symbolizes punctuality, but it doesn't tell the time. Because it's a
 dream!

 You can go outside by going south. Just because it's a dream doesn't
 mean there aren't still compass directions. Work with me.

>examine me


 You look like yourself. Don't overthink it.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>examine clock


 There aren't even any hands! Or numbers! The face of the clock is just
 a spinning, spiraling shape, and when you look at it you realize that
 time is meaningless.

 There's also that chamber underneath the face, where they keep the
 pendulums.

 In the big grandfather clock are some zig-zaggy pendulums.

>examine pendulums


 There's two of them, and they're made out of this white iridescent
 substance. And they're in a weird shape, like, a zig-zag shape.
 They're basically two long white zig-zags.

 They're just hanging there inside the clock.

>take them


 The big grandfather clock isn't open.

>open clock


 Okay so you open up the clock and there are these two pendulums
 inside. I don't know how they work.

>take pendulums


 You pick up the zig-zaggy pendulums.

>wear pendulums


 You can't wear those!

>wave them


 You look ridiculous waving the zig-zaggy pendulums.

>push them


 Pushing the zig-zaggy pendulums is not very effective.

>feel pendulums


 The pendulums have a mechanical smoothless and angularity.

>straighten them


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>taste pendulums


 Man, how does eating stuff even work in dreams? Can you taste in a
 dream?

 This reminds me of that joke about the guy who dreamed he was eating a
 big marshmallow and when he woke up his pillow was gone. But I don't
 think there's any actual food items in this dream.

 Actually, that gives me an idea. Here: You taste the zig-zaggy
 pendulums, and in accordance with the deranged dream-logic of tastes,
 the zig-zaggy pendulums taste like bananas.

>put pendulums in clock


 You put the zig-zaggy pendulums into the big grandfather clock.

>examine pendulums


 There's two of them, and they're made out of this white iridescent
 substance. And they're in a weird shape, like, a zig-zag shape.
 They're basically two long white zig-zags.

>push pendulums


 Pushing the zig-zaggy pendulums is not very effective.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 clock in here, that symbolizes punctuality, but it doesn't tell the

 You can go outside by going south.

>pull pendulums


 You pull on the pendulums and they detach, almost as if you were meant
 to carry them around with you.

>take them


 You already have those.

>take expensive things


 You better not screw around with those expensive things too much.
 They're pretty expensive.

>go north

>take clock

 No, you can't go running around the stately manor. I don't have the
 creative energy to decide what's in there. Just pretend there's a
 curse or something on the rest of the manor, and the curse is keeping
 you from going to any rooms other than the one you're in. If you want
 to leave, you can go south.



 No, you don't get it. This clock is huge.

>shrink clock


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>enter clock


 That's not something you can enter.

>break curse


 You can't see any such thing.

>swing pendulums


 There's nothing sensible to swing here.

>swing partner


 You can't see any such thing.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hill</span>
 As you exit the manor and symbolically shed the shackles of
 civilization, the sweet summer wind blows like a piccolo song across
 your weathered brow.

 So, from up here in front of the stately manor, you can see all the
 rest of the island, which I don't know if I've mentioned this yet but
 my dream world has taken the form of an island. To your right, which
 is west of you if you're facing south, is a thick jungle, with leaves
 that are deep greens and purples in their colors. It symbolizes the
 terror and the wonderment of the unknown. But it is impenetrable to
 you from where you're standing.

 Down the hill to the southwest is a white sandy beach. I'll tell you
 what it symbolizes when you get there.

>examine wind


 You can't see any such thing.

>taste wind

>listen

 You can't see any such thing.



 The sweet summer wind is still blowing like a piccolo song.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Enchanted Gulf</span>
 The gulf that this enchanted beach envelops is itself enchanted, or
 <span class="floydstyle em">ensorcelled,</span> with a magical <span class="floydstyle em">glamour</span> which makes
 everyone who sees it want to just sit around and take a break for once
 in their lives. It symbolizes taking a break for once in your life.
 Only you are able to resist this enchantment, because you alone are so
 incredibly uptight about getting stuff done all the time and being on
 time for things.

 Back to the northeast is the hill, and over to the west is that dark,
 scary jungle.

 A little ways out into the water is a white ship, pitching and yawing
 on the restless sea.

 A Siren is here, sitting and singing on a coral reef.

>examine jungle


 The jungle is thick, and leafy. It represents... what did I say it
 represented? Maybe danger?

>HELLO SAILOR


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine siren


 A Siren is actually supposed to be a bird-woman, I guess, but I want
 this sea-maid to be more like a mermaid. From the hips down she is one
 hundred percent fish, but from the fish up she is one hundred percent
 woman, with long, streaming hair.

 And she's singing a song, but it's not like she's gonna hypnotize you
 or anything. She's not evil. She symbolizes the beauty that can be
 found in life if you don't take everything so seriously all the time

 She's wearing a girdle, which is kind of a curvy belt kind of thing.

>xyzzy


 A hollow voice puts its hand over your mouth and says "Shush!"

>examine girdle


 The Siren's girdle is a pale, opalescent belt thing, pulled snug
 around her waist. It is the only thing she's wearing.

>examine belt


 The Siren's girdle is a pale, opalescent belt thing, pulled snug
 around her waist. It is the only thing she's wearing.

>examine boat


 Apparently wrecked here on the shallow reef. It's white, and shiny,
 like something out of a dream. I mean, it literally is in this dream
 that I'm describing to you right now. It symbolizes... Actually, go in
 there first; give me a second to think about this.

>listen


 The Siren sings in what might be a Romance language, or might be
 random dream-syllables: <span class="floydstyle em">"SerÃ© una ola. SerÃ© la luna. He sido</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">todo,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">soy yo."</span>

>swim


 You paddle out toward the white ship.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ship of Pearl</span>
 When you are inside the ship, you realize that it symbolizes
 loneliness. Specifically, loneliness brought on by being an artist,
 which all artists suffer from deep inside their souls. This is the
 ship of pearl, which painters sail into the seas of paint, and which
 sculptors sail across seas of clay, and of marble, searching for the
 distant moorages of inspiration. I could keep going, but you don't
 seem to be as into this as I am so I guess I'll stop.

 The interior of the ship is lit by a pale, eerie luminescence.

 It looks like whatever painter or poet who piloted this craft last
 left their leather trunk in here.

>examine trunk


 A large leather trunk, scratched and pitted by the slings and arrows
 of being lugged all over the place for years and years. It symbolizes
 mystery. The mysterious initials OWH are inscribed on top.

 It has a big lock thing on it, but no keyhole: Instead, there's just
 two depressions in the front, in the shape of the astrological symbol
 for Aquarius. See? Symbolism.

>open trunk


 It seems to be locked.

>push depressions


 Just pushing on the depressions doesn't do anything. Your hand is not
 the right shape for these zig-zaggy depressions.

>put pendulums in depressions


 You insert the pendulums into the depressions, and they click into
 place. The pendulums were the symbol for Aquarius all along, and the
 symbol was the key to the trunk! You solved the mystery!

 The trunk opens, revealing a wreathÃ¨d horn.

>take horn


 You pick up the horn from the trunk; it has a strange weight to it.

>look in horn
>examine horn


 You find nothing of interest.



 It's a huge conical, spiral shell of the type you often find on
 islands, like in that book, <span class="floydstyle em">Animal Farm.</span> Wait, that's not it.
 That wasn't even on an island. What book am I thinking of?

 It looks like somebody has already drilled a hole in it for you to
 blow into.

>listen to horn


 You put your ear up to the wreathÃ¨d horn, and as if by magic you hear
 the soft sighing of a person in a coma, waiting to be awoken. Or maybe
 you're just hearing the noise of your own blood vessels, multiplied in
 the conical natural echo chamber. Since this is a magical dream world,
 it could be either one.

>taste horn


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the wreathÃ¨d horn tastes like
 Bavarian cream.

>examine horn


 It's a huge conical, spiral shell of the type you often find on
 islands, like in that book I can't remember. Shoot, what was it?

 It looks like somebody has already drilled a hole in it for you to
 blow into.

>examine horn


 It's a huge conical, spiral shell of the type you often find on
 islands, like in... Oh! <span class="floydstyle em">Lord of the Flies.</span> I knew I'd
 remember it eventually.

 It looks like somebody has already drilled a hole in it for you to
 blow into.

>blow horn


 You start to blow into the horn, but the tremendous sound that emerges
 is too much for you to handle. It symbolizes the conclusion of the
 individuation process, which, if attained prematurely, would result in
 a psychological short-circuit. What I'm saying is, this is not the
 time or place for unleashing the power of the horn.

>swim


 You leave the ship and swim back toward the shore.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Enchanted Gulf</span>
 The gulf that this enchanted beach envelops is itself enchanted, or
 <span class="floydstyle em">ensorcelled,</span> with a magical <span class="floydstyle em">glamour</span> which makes

 scary jungle.

 A little ways out into the water is a white ship, pitching and yawing
 on the restless sea.

 A Siren is here, sitting and singing on a coral reef.

>talk to siren
>listen siren


 The Siren smiles and says hello. She is extremely helpful and would
 love to tell you about anything you want to ask her about.



 I only understood you as far as wanting to listen.

>ask siren about jungle


 She says that she is a fan of the jungle, but can't hang out there as
 much as she'd like, because her legs are a fish.

>ask siren about herself


 She smiles. She says she's doing just fine, thanks for asking.

>ask siren about nautilisia


 "You have to understand," explains the Siren, "After you solve all the
 puzzles, the dream will be over. It's in the nature of dreams, to end.
 And when the sleeper awakens, Nautilisia will be gone... only the
 memory of this dream land will exist in the waking world.

 "But someday, you might recall this island... That memory must be the
 real Nautilisia."

 She smiles. "I stole that speech from a video game."

>ask siren about sleeper


 The Siren doesn't have anything interesting to say about that.

>ask siren about girdle


 "Do you like it?" she asks. "I got it on Etsy for like sixteen bucks."

>ask siren about horn


 When you bring up the wreathÃ¨d horn, the Siren's eyes go wide. "That
 horn is an artifact of tremendous psychic potential!" she whispers.
 "Either that, or it symbolizes psychic potential."

>ask siren about batman


 The Siren doesn't have anything interesting to say about that.

>ask siren about beach


 The Siren says she isn't crazy about sand. You can't blame her,
 really. Sand is annoying sometime.

>dig


 The Siren sees you digging and freaks out. "Great!" she yells. "Dig
 it! Dig it! Dig to the center of the earth!!"

>dig


 The Siren sees you digging and freaks out. "Great!" she yells. "Dig
 it! Dig it! Dig to the center of the earth!!"

>Dig to the center of the earth

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Enchanted Gulf</span>

 Back to the northeast is the hill, and over to the west is that dark,
 scary jungle.

 A little ways out into the water is a white ship, pitching and yawing
 on the restless sea.

 A Siren is here, sitting and singing on a coral reef.

>examine coral


 Coral is super scratchy, you know that? It cuts you open and then the
 saltwater gets in there and it stings like a mother. This dream coral
 symbolizes the fundamental painfulness of existence.

 I guess I don't know why the Siren is sitting on it then.

>ask siren about gulf


 The Siren looks out to the sea and sighs. "This island symbolizes a
 lot of things," she says. "A lot of things." She sighs again.

>take coral


 That's hardly portable.

>break coral


 Don't start with that stuff. Nautilisia is a safe place, a peaceful
 place. Play along a little.

>sing


 When you start singing, the Siren glares at you and starts singing
 louder. So you stop singing.

>fly


 You hop up in the air, but are unable to stay aloft. I've never been
 able to fly in a dream, so I'm deciding you can't fly either.

>dance


 Your dancing is abominable! Quit ruining my dream-world!

>sleep


 No, I'm already asleep. A person in a coma is always asleep basically.

>kiss siren


 The Siren isn't the type to get all sexy on you unprovoked, but since
 you decided to initiate things, the Siren goes ahead and <span class="floydstyle em">rocks</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">your world</span>.

>pick up siren


 I don't suppose the Siren would care for that.

>kiss siren


 When you move in for some more action, the Siren does that thing where
 she pulls her head away at the last moment. So annoying.

>examine hair


 (the long streaming hair)
 Her hair is black. Long and black and wet. It's all the more black for
 its being wet.The strands are all tangled up after a long day of
 swimming around, though, and she seems a bit frustrated at this.

 But I can't decide whether her hair should cover up her boobs or not.
 I mean, maybe it's not very important, but I'm getting hung up on it
 anyway. For now I'm gonna say it covers up... neither boob.

>examine boobs


 As you gaze upon the Siren's boobs, which apparently the Siren does
 not mind you doing, I am going to decide whether they're covered up by
 her hair or not. It's not a completely arbitrary question, you know.
 This kind of detail does a lot to determine the overall tone of my
 dream world.

 I'm gonna say... just the left boob is covered up.

>examine left breast


 Oh, come on. Let's be mature, okay? Just say "boobs."

>examine boobs


 As you gaze upon the Siren's boobs, which apparently the Siren does
 not mind you doing, I am going to decide whether they're covered up by
 her hair or not. It's not a completely arbitrary question, you know.
 This kind of detail does a lot to determine the overall tone of my
 dream world.

 I'm gonna say... both boobs are covered up.

>brush hair


 Which do you mean, your hair or the long streaming hair?

>long streaming hair


 You don't have a combing-instrument with you, do you?

>yes


 Yeah! Yeah, exactly.

>no


 No?

>maybe


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>perhaps


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Jungle</span>
 I keep forgetting what this jungle is supposed to symbolize. I think
 it was intrigue. The branches, heavy with purple leaves, lean down
 toward you in a vaguely threatening way. It's a scary experience, but
 it's also kind of exciting. That's the fun of being in a coma-induced
 dream world.

 A rough path through the vegetation leads from the gulf to the east to
 a clearing in the northwest.

 A long vine hangs from the trees, swaying like a snake in front of
 your face.

>examine vine


 It dances hypnotically before your vision. It's a symbol of risk. You
 have to take risks, see? Otherwise you can't get anywhere in life.

>climb vine


 After giving a little resistance, the vine falls to the ground,
 dislodging something from the branches in the process.

 When the entire length of the vine has fallen, it turns into a giant
 green snake, which slithers off into the jungle. That snake symbolizes
 the horrible things that can happen when you take risks.

 The thing you dislodged finally hits the ground. It's a shell, a venus
 comb. That thing could have killed you!

 You see what happens when you take risks?

>examine comb


 It's a seashell, spiral in shape and conical in form, but it's covered
 in dozens of long, skinny spines, like a hairbrush designed by H.R.
 Giger. It symbolizes beauty as a desirable but fundamentally dangerous
 aspect of experience.

>get shell


 (the venus comb)
 Taken.

>comb hair


 The venus comb pokes your hand something fierce, but it straightens
 your hair out nicely. When I say "your hand" and "your hair" I mean
 "your dream-hand" and "your dream-hair," obviously.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Enchanted Gulf</span>

 Back to the northeast is the hill, and over to the west is that dark,
 scary jungle.

 A little ways out into the water is a white ship, pitching and yawing
 on the restless sea.

 A Siren is here, sitting and singing on a coral reef.

>comb long hair


 As you approach her hair with the dangerous shell, the Siren's eyes go
 wide.

 "Is this what I think it is? Where on earth did you find this? Well,
 anyway, thank you."

 She takes the comb from you and immediately starts brushing her hair.

 "I suppose it's customary to repay you somehow, right? Well, here."

 She takes off her girdle, which dream-logically turns into...
 something else, I guess, and hands it to you.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a Siren's girdle
   a wreathÃ¨d horn

>examine girdle


 Now that she's not wearing it, the Siren's girdle has turned into more
 of a two-dimensional curvy H shape, like a crude drawing of a girdle
 being worn around an hourglass waist. It's still pale and opalescent,
 though.

>wear girdle


 I'm not saying you don't have the figure for it, but that's not how
 you're supposed to use the girdle.

>put girdle on head


 You can't see any such thing.

>gird loins


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Jungle</span>
 I keep forgetting what this jungle is supposed to symbolize. I think
 it was the unknown. The branches, heavy with purple leaves, lean down
 toward you in a vaguely threatening way. It's a scary experience, but
 it's also kind of exciting. That's the fun of being in a coma-induced
 dream world.

 A rough path through the vegetation leads from the gulf to the east to
 a clearing in the northwest.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 This is an open area in the jungle, symbolizing the <span class="floydstyle em">eye of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">storm</span>. It isn't the center of the jungle, but it's the center of
 your experience at this point in time. It's like the guy says:
 Wherever you go, there you are.

 The path leading back into the jungle is southeast of here, but to
 your north is a rock wall, carved with a curious design.

>examine design


 It's a carving, a depression kind of thing, in the shape of the
 astrological symbol for Pisces.

>put girdle in carving


 The girdle, which was all along the symbol for Pisces, fits perfectly
 into the slot on the wall. Both of them dissolve into a silver mist.
 You overcame the dream logic and defeated the puzzle!

 This is my favorite one, by the way. Because I'm a Pisces. Anyway,
 good job.

 It turns out that behind the rock is a huge cave.

>look

 The path leading back into the jungle is southeast of here, but to
 your north is the mouth of an awesome-looking cave.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Caves of Thought</span>
 You have finally found your way to the Caves of Thought. This cave
 represents thought, and thinking. There are stalactites and
 stalagmites and that kind of thing, but the area has been kept mostly
 empty, so as not to distract from your meditations as you approach the
 center of the island.

 The tunnel continues to the northeast, but if you want you can return
 to the light and air of the clearing to the south.

>think


 Your thoughts reverberate against the walls, bouncing around and
 multiplying and colliding and eventually canceling each other out.

>meditate


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>premeditate


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>taste cave


 You can't see any such thing.

 There is no reply.

>yell

>echo

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deep Caves of Thought</span>
 This cave represents deep thought. See, there are always deeper levels
 of thought. Getting really deep in thought is a necessary step on the
 path to self-attainment. So, keep going.

 The way out is southwest, but the deeper caves are to the east.

>examine stalactites


 I actually don't remember the difference. Stalagmites might... They
 might something. Man, this is gonna keep me up all night. Or it would,
 if I wasn't in a coma.

>taste stalactites


 Don't be distracted by the beautiful cave formations!

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deeper Caves of Thought</span>
 I know, it probably seems like there are too many sections in this
 cave. I totally understand why you would feel that way. But having a
 bunch of caves like this is a <span class="floydstyle em">necessity.</span> It's called
 "pacing." Just trust me.

 Even deeper caves are to the south; the less deep caves are west of
 here.

>pace around


 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Your thoughts reverberate against the walls, bouncing around and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Very Deep Caves of Thought</span>
 Okay, okay, here for once is something more interesting than just more
 caves.

 At this curve in the tunnel, the east wall is made up of a bunch of
 rocks. I mean, the whole place is made out of rocks, but these rocks
 are smaller and... rubblier.

 The cave continues to the north and southwest.

>clear rubble


 You can't see any such thing.

>move rocks


 Apparently pushing on the wall of rocks doesn't do anything.

>taste rocks


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the wall of rocks tastes like
 glue.

>take rocks


 You pull out one of the rocks from the wall. The rest of the rocks
 immediately fall down in a big pile.

 But then: a rush of air! A shaft of light! You've uncovered a path to
 the surface. Nice job!

 Let's say this symbolizes an act of mutual recognition between your
 conscious and unconscious minds. I mean, my conscious and unconscious
 minds. Either way, good going.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Very Deep Caves of Thought</span>
 Here's the place in the tunnel where there's an exit to the surface
 instead of an east wall.

 The cave continues to the north and southwest.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hill</span>
 So, from up here in front of the stately manor, you can see all the
 rest of the island. An entrance has opened into the caves beneath the
 jungle to the west of you.

 Down the hill to the southwest is a white sandy beach.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stately Manor</span>
 It's like stately Wayne manor, in that it's on top of a hill, and it's
 very expansive and full of expensive things, but there's no
 labyrinthine cave system underneath it. Well okay, I guess actually
 there turned out to be a labyrinthine cave system underneath it,
 <span class="floydstyle em">sorry to disappoint you.</span>

 There's even a big grandfather clock in here, that symbolizes
 punctuality, but it doesn't tell the time. Because it's a dream!

 You can go outside by going south.

 rest of the island. An entrance has opened into the caves beneath the
 jungle to the west of you.

 Down the hill to the southwest is a white sandy beach.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Very Deep Caves of Thought</span>
 Here's the place in the tunnel where there's an exit to the surface
 instead of an east wall.

 The cave continues to the north and southwest.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Incredibly Deep Caves of Thought</span>
 Sorry, this is another room where there isn't really anything going
 on. I swear I'm not doing this just to frustrate you.

 I know sometimes it seems like I'm doing stuff just to be annoying,
 but I always have a good reason. I mean, I always <span class="floydstyle em">think</span> I
 have a good reason. Sometimes it turns out later that I didn't
 actually have a good reason, but I never start out with the intention
 of doing nothing but screwing with you.

 The caves go northeast and northwest from here.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Uttermost Depths of Caves of Thought</span>
 This is it. You have reached the deepest part of the caves. From here
 on out, you've still got underground rooms, but it's more like an
 ancient underground shrine than a plain old cave.

 From here you can go back southeast, or you can go northeast, in which
 direction you can discern an unearthly glow.

 But first, gaze into that pool of still water, and see the face of
 your destiny.

>examine pool


 In the pool is a goat-fish.

>examine goat-fish


 It's a baby goat-fish. Maybe more of a kid-fish. It only has little
 nubby horns, and the fish end of it wriggles around energetically.
 This baby goat-fish represents youthful idealism, or youthful
 ignorance. I guess those are kind of the same thing.

>taste goat-fish


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the goat-fish tastes like
 pickles.

>ask goat-fish about itself


 You can only do that to something animate.

>swim


 The pool is too small for you to swim in, so you shrink down to the
 size of a frog and swim around in it for a while. Then you return to
 your normal size.

>pet goat-fish


 The goat-fish bleats contentedly as you nuzzle its goaty little face.

>take goat-fish


 It takes a couple tries, but eventually you scoop the baby goat-fish
 up out of the pool. It emits a few high-pitched bleats and then it
 calms down in your comforting grasp.

 The goat-fish bleats a little bleating song.

>squeeze it


 You achieve nothing by this.

 The goat-fish nibbles on your finger.

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Uttermost Depths of Caves of Thought</span>
 This is it. You have reached the deepest part of the caves.

 From here you can go back southeast, or you can go northeast, in which
 direction you can discern an unearthly glow.

 The baby goat-fish wriggles its way up your arm.

>examine glow


 It glimmers, or glistens, or maybe even <span class="floydstyle em">glisters</span>--no, I'd
 better stick with glistens--with a radiance you find very slightly
 unnerving.

 The kid-fish crawls up to your shoulder and tries to headbutt you in
 the neck.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shining Archway</span>
 This room is awash in light: In the south wall, an archway towers over
 you, glowing as if reflecting the brightness of a distant galaxy.

 The room with the pool is back to the southwest, and it looks like
 there's a shortcut to the east. I put that shortcut there just for
 you.

 The baby goat-fish almost falls to the ground, but you catch it.

>examine archway


 This archway is a symbol of the ultimate, I mean the penultimate
 barrier between my comatose mind and the outside world. It literally
 is that, but it's also symbolically that. <span class="floydstyle em">The lines are beginning</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to blur.</span>

 The path through the arch is blocked by a big door.

 All of a sudden, the baby goat-fish yawns and falls asleep.

>examine door


 This idle door is actually the barrier you have to worry about. I
 guess if the arch is the symbolic barrier, then this door is the
 literal barrier. By "literal" here I mean
 "literal-within-the-dream-world."

 In the door is another keyhole-depression, this one in the shape of,
 like, a V with a ridiculous curly thing attached to it.

>taste fish


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the goat-fish tastes like
 pickles.

>put it in door


 See, that would make sense, but the goat-fish is a literal
 (dream-)goat-fish, not a Capricorn <span class="floydstyle em">symbol.</span> You've got a
 classic confusion between signifier and signified on your hands.

>put horn in door


 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

>shake fish


 Aw, but it's so cute when it's sleeping! Just let it rest.

>symbolize goatfish


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine capricorn


 (the goat-fish)
 It's a baby goat-fish. Maybe more of a kid-fish. It only has little
 nubby horns, and the fish end of it wriggles around energetically.
 This baby goat-fish represents youthful idealism, or youthful
 ignorance. I guess those are kind of the same thing.

>put capricorn in depression


 (the goat-fish in the keyhole-depression)
 See, that would make sense, but the goat-fish is a literal
 (dream-)goat-fish, not a Capricorn <span class="floydstyle em">symbol.</span> You've got a
 classic confusion between signifier and signified on your hands.

 The baby goat-fish snores a little bleating snore.

>blow horn


 You start to blow into the horn, but the tremendous sound that emerges
 is too much for you to handle. It symbolizes the conclusion of the
 individuation process, which, if attained prematurely, would result in
 a psychological short-circuit. What I'm saying is, this is not the
 time or place for unleashing the power of the horn.

>blow capricorn


 (the goat-fish)
 That's not something you can blow into. Or, at any rate, you don't
 need to blow into it. Let's do something else.

>shake it


 Aw, but it's so cute when it's sleeping! Just let it rest.

>drop it


 No, no! You can't leave it here alone! It can't fend for itself!

>examine fish


 It's a baby goat-fish. Maybe more of a kid-fish. It only has little
 nubby horns, and the fish end of it wriggles around energetically.
 This baby goat-fish represents youthful idealism, or youthful
 ignorance. I guess those are kind of the same thing.

>open door


 There's no handle in the door, just that goofy-looking depression.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Very Deep Caves of Thought</span>
 Here's the place in the tunnel where there's an exit to the surface
 instead of an east wall.

 The cave continues to the north and southwest, and there's that tiny
 shortcut to the shining archway to the west.

>f e


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hill</span>
 So, from up here in front of the stately manor, you can see all the
 rest of the island. An entrance has opened into the caves beneath the
 jungle to the west of you.

 Down the hill to the southwest is a white sandy beach.

 The goat-fish burps in its sleep.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Enchanted Gulf</span>
 The gulf that this enchanted beach envelops is itself enchanted, or
 <span class="floydstyle em">ensorcelled,</span> with a magical <span class="floydstyle em">glamour</span> which makes
 everyone who sees it want to just sit around and take a break for once
 in their lives. It symbolizes taking a break for once in your life.
 Only you are able to resist this enchantment, because you alone are so
 incredibly uptight about getting stuff done all the time and being on
 time for things.

 Back to the northeast is the hill, and over to the west is that dark,
 scary jungle.

 A little ways out into the water is a white ship, pitching and yawing
 on the restless sea.

 A Siren is here, sitting and singing on a coral reef.

>ask siren about goat-fish


 The Siren tells you she is extremely worried about the well-being of
 her little goat-fish Tarin, who got lost in a cave.

>feel streaming hair


 The Siren is totally cool with your feeling her hair, which falls away
 like bashful silk through your fingers. She must use one heck of a
 conditioner.

>give tarin to siren


 Her jaw drops. "Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh. You brought Tarin!"

 The goat-fish leaps into the Siren's arms with a triumphant bleat and
 she immediately begins cooing over it.

 "You know, I actually have the perfect reward for you. Check this
 out:" She produces a piece of pearlescent material from an invisible
 drawer or something.

 "Do you recognize this? It's the symbol for Capricorn. It's
 thematically appropriate, because Tarin here is a goat-fish, right?
 Anyway, I want you to have it." She hands it to you.

>thank siren


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>taste flowing hair


 You can't see any such thing.

>taste streaming hair


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the long streaming hair tastes
 like finely-shredded dark chocolate.

>taste streaming hair

>put capricorn in door


 (the Capricorn symbol in the idle door)
 The Capricorn symbol slides into place with a click. The door
 dematerializes, its constituent dream-atoms disappearing into the
 dream-aether.

 Nice job! The path to the final challenge is now open.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunless Crypt</span>
 You have reached the end of your quest. Here, at the center of
 Nautilisia, is the sunless crypt that symbolizes the spiritual and
 psychological profundity of the coma that I've been in all this time.

 The ceiling above roils with irisdescent turmoil, symbolizing the
 conflux of emotions that are going on in my brain. A spiral design on
 the floor leads your gaze toward the center of the room, which is the
 center of the center of Nautilisia:

 Lying prostrate on a dais of nacreous stone and wrapped in webs of
 gauze is my own comatose body.

>examine body


 That's definitely me. You'd know my face anywhere. And I'm definitely,
 definitely in a coma. This symbolizes the fact that I'm in a coma
 right now.

 So, this is the final puzzle! How can you possibly wake me up, and
 release my mind from this nice nap? I mean, this coma?

>examine spiral


 You're gonna have to take my word for it, but the spiral on the floor
 is a logarithmic spiral with a growth factor of about 1.6180339887.
 This symbolizes <span class="floydstyle em">the mathematical perfection of pure thought</span>.

>taste body


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the comatose body tastes like
 a comatose person. What is wrong with you.

>examine dais


 The word "nacreous" looks like it means "gross," but it actually
 refers to the texture of nacre, i.e. mother-of-pearl. So you can
 imagine this dais as like a great big pearl growing out of the floor.

 I guess when I put it that way it sounds kind of gross anyway.

>taste dais


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the dais of nacreous stone
 tastes like asay Kleenex.

>examine ceiling


 The irised ceiling of the crypt casts all kinds of weird colored
 lights across the room, symbolizing the blurring of self, shadow,
 anima, and animus. It also symbolizes emotional turmoil. It symbolizes
 both things at the same time. That's part of the blurring.

>taste ceiling


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, the irised ceiling tastes like
 the candy coating of an M&M.

>taste me


 According to the dream-logic of tastes, yourself taste like vanilla
 ice cream.

>blow horn


 When you put your lips to the wreathÃ¨d horn, it emits a huge, deep
 moan like a mob of whales singing in unison. The ceiling rumbles. The
 sleeper stirs.

 I'm trying to decide how many times you should have to blow the horn
 to make me wake up. How about nine?

>blow horn

>no
>no

 The conch blasts again, like waves crashing on a glass beach. The
 vibrations shake the irised ceiling.

 Yeah, nine is probably too many. How about seven?

 Fine. Because I like you: three times. Just one more time.



 No?



 No?

>blow horn


 You blow into the wreathÃ¨d horn again, with a tone like a hurricane
 inside a crystal bell.

 Then the ceiling cracks, and shatters, and the light of the sun,
 symbolizing <span class="floydstyle em">the clarity of conscious thought,</span> shines into the
 previously sunless crypt, which symbolizes <span class="floydstyle em">the stagnancy of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">absolute introspection,</span> right onto my unconscious body, which
 symbolizes me.


 And then everything goes white.

 And now I'm awake. Look, see? I'm awake. We can get going now.


 Anyway, thanks for putting up with all that nonsense. I know I
 probably goof off too much, and it gets to be a pain some of the time.
 I really do want both of us to have fun, even if some of the time the
 only one having any fun is me. So I really appreciate your tolerance.
 I guess "tolerance" isn't the right word. You know what I mean.



     <span class="floydstyle i">*** No, seriously. Thank you. ***</span>

 See? Nothing is urgent. Everything will happen when it needs to
