 Fleeting glimpses of faces half-remembered in the gloom. Screams, the
 sound of squealing tires, a sudden thump, a sickening crunch and a
 violent jolt followed by a sense of weightlessness and disassociation.
 The last thing you remember is an overwhelming feeling of guilt and
 regret, forcing its way through the chaos that surrounds you and then
 there is...

 Nothing
 Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are
 opened or closed. Concepts like time and place have no meaning here.
 Your mind attempts to impose something, some order, some structure,
 upon the space in which you exist, and fails. There is only the void.
 For all you know, that is all there ever was.

>scream
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 There is only Nothing.

>wake up
 There is only Nothing.

 No, wait. There is ... something, moving in the darkness. It dances at
 the edge of your new-found vision, teasing you. You turn your head
 toward the shape, when your neck suddenly gives out and your head lolls
 backward. Blinding pain explodes from the back of your head.

 Your eyes flutter open...

 White Room
 A small room, with circular walls and a floor of pale white stone.
 There are no apparent exits, other than a small slit of a window off to
 one side.

 An angelic-looking young man looks upon you with concern.

 Along the far wall opposite the window hangs a tapestry.

 The young man smiles.

 "Ah, you are all right. You had me worried, my friend," he says.

>examine man
 A face almost harsh in its perfection, with crystal-clear blue eyes
 half-covered by a flowing mane of gold. He wears a gown of white, about
 his neck is a silver pendant, and in his left hand he carries the long
 graceful curve of an ivory torch.

>examine me
 From what you can tell, you're as you've always been.

 The young man's smile suddenly fades and he sighs.

 "There is much we must speak of my friend," he says. He turns and
 points at the tapestry. "And there are choices which must be made."

>ask man about man
 "I fear I cannot help you with that, my friend."

>ask man about me
 "Ah, yes ... you have no memory of yourself."  The young man pauses a
 moment. "You, lost traveler, are Timothy Hunter, recently a mortal, now
 dead. Because of your actions in life and what has just happened at the
 moment of your death, the fate of your soul is in doubt."

 "But here, I have not even introduced myself. Forgive me," he says,
 bowing with a flourish. "I am ... Morningstar."

>ask man about xyzzy
 "I fear I cannot help you with that, my friend."

>xyzzy
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kiss man
 That would be pointless.

 Morningstar turns to the window and looks out it.

>examine window
 Approaching the opening, you realize it is hardly more than a slit in
 the wall. Peering through it, you see the night sky, brilliant with
 innumerable stars. Straining your vision, you can make out the
 landscape, far below, covered with trees. You are in a tower of some
 sort, in the center of a forest that goes on for as far as the eye can
 see.

 Running your hand against the wall you realize that it is not the stone
 you took it for. It is far too smooth, and feels warm to the touch. For
 a moment, the confused image of your hands running over piano keys runs
 through your mind. And then it hits you: you've felt this before. It's
 ivory. An ivory tower...

>ask man about death
 "What is there to say that you already do not know, Timothy?  You are
 dead, and your soul is in jeopardy."

>push morningsar
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask man about morningstar
 "I am no one of consequence. All you need know is that I am your friend
 and guide, and I shall do all in my power to help you."

>ask man about soul
 "What is there to say that you already do not know, Timothy?  You are
 dead, and your soul is in jeopardy."

 He stares at you for a short while, his eyes shining in the
 near-darkness, then he seems to reach a decision and takes you by the
 hand.

 "Come Timothy," he says, leading you toward the tapestry. "There is
 much I must show you, and I fear there will be much you do not wish to
 see."

>push morningstar
 That would be less than courteous.

>examine tapestry
 A large, intricately woven tapestry which depicts three tableaus on
 three different panels.

 You stare at the swirling colors of the wall-hanging as Morningstar
 places the torch in his right hand while still clinging to your own,
 and then places his left upon the tapestry. His hand, pale as the ivory
 of the torch he carries, caresses the first panel, running up and down
 its length.

 "Come Timothy, your destiny, past, present, and future, awaits."

>examine first panel
 Upon the first panel is a scene of an elderly woman in a hospital, with
 a doctor looking sadly down upon her.

>examine second panel
 Upon the second panel is a scene of a middle-aged woman lying in a bed,
 with what appears to be her soul halfway in and half-way out of her
 body.

 The rumbling shakes you from your contemplation of the tapestry. At
 first, you can feel it more than hear it, but as the vibration of
 everything around you increases, so does the volume of the noise behind
 it. The room, the tapestry, the young man at your side, everything
 begins to sway and shake at the behest of the ferocious sound. You try
 to wrest your hands from Morningstar's and clamp them against your
 skull, anything to blot out the terrible song which fills your ears and
 shakes your bones, but he holds fast.

 Then, with a sudden forward rush, a universe of multi-colored threads
 leaps from the hanging, flooding your vision. They wrap themselves
 about you in a spinning dance that, combined with the noise, threatens
 to overwhelm your senses. Just when you think the din will drive you
 mad, there is a flash of light, again the sense of weightlessness, as
 if you have been separated from the rest of the world, and then,
 somehow, you are somewhere else...

 A hospital room
 Another room of white walls, but where the walls of the Ivory Tower
 seemed to contain a vitality, these walls are cold and dead. A patina
 of sickness and decay stains everything and the room reeks of hospital
 disinfectant. This place is clean, yes, but a manmade clean, a futile
 attempt to wash away the odor of sickness and death which will
 inevitably return.

 An elderly woman lies here in a hospital bed. A doctor looking down
 upon her.

 Morningstar is here.

 "Mercy Hospital," he says, "where you left her, Timothy, for all those
 months. Where you left her to forget her."

>examine woman
 The old woman lies still in the bed, her eyes closed. Her grey hair
 falls in long locks over her face and from her arm protrudes the clear
 line of an IV-tube, leading to a machine which stands at the bedside.
 There is something vaguely familiar about her.

>examine machine
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask morningstar about woman
 "Alicia, your mother, Timothy. She'd been ill for a very long time,
 and, I suppose, you could not deal with it any longer. You'd taken care
 of her for so long, and it seemed as though she'd never bow out
 gracefully. So, you sent her here. Out of sight, out of mind. You could
 finally get on with your life."

 Morningstar sighs deeply.

>kiss mother
 She is motionless. At first, you thing she is asleep, but then you see
 that the doctor does not move either. It would appear that time has
 somehow stopped.

 "Except, it didn't work out that way, did it Timothy?  When the doctor
 called you, told you that she had died, crying for you, it all came
 flooding back. The guilt at leaving her, at abandoning her finally
 overtook you. And then the final insult of not being there when she
 died."  He shakes his head.

>examine doctor
 A middle aged man, in the obvious uniform of a doctor, looks down upon
 your mother. He stands frozen with a look of pity on his face. About
 his neck is a silver pendant.

 "You were working with a major client at the time, just about to leave
 for an important meeting, when you got the call. You'd been working so
 hard, so caught up in your own life, forgetting her had been so easy."

>examine pendant
 A pendant in the shape of a silver sunburst hanging from a silver
 chain.

>remember
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask morningstar about pendant
 Morningstar looks at you with incomprehension for a moment and then
 looks from his own pendant to the other. He stares at you.

 "You can see this?" he whispers.

 You nod dumbly. He stands in shock for a moment, then seems to recover
 his wits.
 "It is nothing, Timothy. A symbol, perhaps, nothing more."

 Morningstar looks at the figure on the bed, then up to you.

 "Come," he says, taking you by the hand again. "There is more to
 see..."

>hug mother

 Bedroom
 A sense of recognition fills you, but you cannot say where you have
 seen this room before. Again, white walls, and again sickness and
 death. And guilt...

 A young woman lies propped up on the large double-sized bed here. Her
 face lies tilted against her shoulder, her long auburn hair covering
 her face.

 Morningstar is here.

 He looks about the room in a moment of silent contemplation, then looks
 to you.

 "Your bedroom, Timothy" he whispers, "where you murdered her."

>examine corpse
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine woman
 You brush the hair lightly from the woman's face.  Her eyes are closed,
 but for some reason you know her eyes are the most beautiful jade
 green. Her expression is locked in one of grimacing pain. You know her,
 no, that's wrong ... you SHOULD know her.

 Morningstar sees the look of shock on your face. He sighs.

 "So you have forgotten even her ... her whom you promised you never
 would forget."

>open her eyes
 I only understood you as far as wanting to open the young woman.

>open eyes
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask morningstar about woman
 Morningstar pointedly ignores you.

 "Yes, Timothy ... murder. Oh you may have other names for it:
 mercy-killing, euthanasia. There have always been words to soothe the
 conscience. But you know them for what they are. Excuses,
 rationalizations. You've always known you murdered her. Your Sarah,
 your beloved wife. But perhaps not so beloved when she became a
 burden?"

>wake woman
 There is no response. In fact, you notice for the first time that
 nothing moves. Time has stopped.

 "She'd been ill for so long, hadn't she?"  He runs the back of his hand
 delicately along her cheek. "It seemed as if it never would end, the
 doctor's visits, the second opinions, all of them useless. And she just
 kept clinging to this vague existence she called life, refusing to bow
 out gracefully ... just like your mother. Oh how like her she was!"

>start time
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>hit morningstar
 And what would that accomplish?

 "And so, going financially bankrupt from the bills and emotionally
 bankrupt from the constant strain of taking care of her, you decided to
 take the path of least resistance."

>morningstar, shut up
 Morningstar has better things to do.

 "It was easy. You remember that much, do you not?  The pills to cloud
 her mind, the whispering of nonsense in her ear to calm her, and then
 the pillow. It was as simple as snuffing out a candle, was it not?  But
 the words you placed upon the act afterward did nothing to release you
 from the guilt of what you'd done."

>touch woman
 Keep your hands to yourself.

 "Come," he says, taking you by the hand once again. "The story does not
 end here..."

 Night Scene
 A darkened street, a snapshot of a city held frozen for a brief
 instant. Streetlamps line the walk you stand upon, lighting the night
 with their blinding shafts of radiance. In the surrounding gloom, you
 can make out dim figures frozen mid-step.

 The sudden halt in the flow of time has caught a car in midair, about
 to strike a young woman who has stumbled into its path.

 Morningstar is here.

 "But it does end here," he says, "where you died."  He surveys the
 scene. "Ignominious, is it not?"

>examine woman
 The poor thing is barely an adult, her face still scarred by the rigors
 of adolescence. Her eyes are turned upward into the lights of the car
 bearing down upon her, just realizing its existence. One hand has
 dropped before her, trying to stop her fall, while her other is
 outstretched back. Looking behind her, you catch a glimpse of a figure
 standing on the sidewalk ... a figure that looks as if it's pushed her.

 "You were trying to run away from it all, the memories, the guilt.
 You'd been running away for so long that it seemed second nature."

>examine figure
 A young man with raven black hair. He has apparently just shoved the
 young woman into the street, his silver pendant flying backwards as he
 stumbles back to view the result of his actions.

 "It affected everything. First you lost her, then you lost your faith
 in life and yourself, you lost your dignity, your self-respect. Then
 your job."

>examine pendant
 A pendant in the shape of a silver sunburst hanging from a silver
 chain.

 "And so it all came to this night, when you went driving for no reason
 at all."

>ask morningstar about pendant
 "I have already told you, mortal. It is nothing you need concern
 yourself with."

 "And it seemed that perhaps you weren't content to leave this world
 alone. You had to drag an innocent along with you."

>ask morningstar about figure
 Morningstar looks to the figure, then back to you. He shrugs. "What of
 him?"

 Morningstar turns to you, a mask of mixed pity and disgust.

 "And so this is your legacy."  He smirks, then sighs deeply. "Look ye
 on your works and despair."

>examine driver
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine car
 Looking more closely, you recognize it as an old Dodge, almost falling
 apart. It has apparently struck the curb, which is what caused it to go
 flying. A streetlamp's beam strikes the windshield squarely. cutting
 off your view of the interior. Shifting over and squinting, you can
 make out a figure in the driver's seat. Wait a minute, it can't be ...
 it's ... it's ...

      ...you.

 Again the rumbling and the threads throw you into their heaving
 embrace, and leave you gasping on another strange and distant shore...

 Ruined Tower
 The Ivory Tower, where you started this strange adventure, now lies in
 ruins. Its walls lie scorched about you, the roof rent to the open sky.
 The stars, in their impassive brilliance, illuminate the devastation
 below. Over the Tower's remains you catch glimpses of the fires below,
 trees smoldering in the darkness.

 The Tapestry seems to have survived the Tower's destruction intact.

 Morningstar is here.

 He stands motionless, a statue in white ice, his eyes glowing in the
 near-darkness.

>examine stars
 Whatever apocalypse destroyed the Tower has rent the ceiling from the
 room. Above, you see innumerable stars in strange constellations.

 An ethereal chuckle erupts from nowhere and everywhere. A low, female
 voice follows it, the hint of the laughter still in its voice.

 "And so you would leave him here, Phosphoros?  With the tale
 half-finished, as is your wont?"

>fires
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine third panel
 The third panel is a scene of a young woman, hardly a child, stumbling
 into a road, arms flailing, eyes open in shock at the sight of your car
 barreling down upon her.

 Morningstar seems as startled as you, but quickly recovers. He smiles
 and speaks to the air.

 "You find me an inadequate storyteller, Parcae?" he says, bowing
 deeply. "What more would you have him know?"

>examine fires
 The woods that blanket the landscape for miles around are apparently on
 fire. Plumes of smoke fill the sky as the fires slowly spread outward
 from the Tower.

 The voice speaks again, but this time all frivolity from it is lost.
 You catch an odd echo in it, as if it were multiple voices speaking in
 chorus.

 "You know that is not Our way, do not think to mock Us."

>listen
 Morningstar motions to you to be still and silent.

 "I, Lady of the Skein, you think I would mock you?"  Morningstar places
 his hand to his heart, all innocence.

>ask voice about morningstar
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask lady about morningstar
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine voice
 You can't see any such thing.

>listen
 Morningstar motions to you to be still and silent.

 "There is many a thing We would put past you not, Son of the Morning,
 but We come here not to speak of you..."

 A gust of wind startles you and you turn to see a shining filament
 suspended in midair. Its light falters for a brief moment, rendering it
 immaterial, and then begins to solidify.

 A shimmering pattern of webs begins to weave itself into being from the
 central thread, its beams crisscrossing in increasingly complex shapes.
 At its apex, a brighter light begins to shine: a small, slender spider,
 also made of light, with an hourglass symbol etched in golden radiance
 upon its back.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine webs
 The spider flickers at it moves down the web, one moment solid, the
 next, insubstantial.

 The arachnid slowly makes its way down the web, its delicate legs
 running over the threads. As it descends, its light begins to pulse,
 masking it from view, then reappearing. Their rate increases as it
 continues its course, its shape becoming more and more indistinct. One
 moment the legs look like tiny human arms, hands grasping at the
 threads, the next, immaterial shafts of light. As the spider touches
 the ground, there is a blinding flash, and a human figure stands in its
 place.

>examine parcae
 The figure is made of an ever-shifting pattern of golden light, its
 face constantly changing.

 The figure's face shimmers, revealing a middle-aged woman.

 "Greetings, traveler," she says in the same odd voice, bowing slightly.
 She turns her attention to Morningstar. "To you as well, King of Tyre."
 Morningstar returns her greeting with a nod of his head.

>examine her
 The figure is made of an ever-shifting pattern of golden light, its
 face constantly changing.

 The figure's shimmering reveals the visage of an old hag.

 "Know, mortal, that we are Fate, the Parcae, alloters of Man's destiny.
 I am Atropos, the inflexible Cutter, who did sever the thread of your
 life at the moment of your death."  The figure shimmers again,
 revealing a very young-looking woman. She smiles at you shyly.

 "I am Clotho, the Spinner, who spun your destiny thread at the moment
 of your birth."  Another shimmer and the middle-aged woman appears
 again.

 "Lachesis," she says, "the Alloter. It was I who did measure the length
 of your thread, and with it, your life."

>punch pacae
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask her about thread
 Clotho appears, looking pained. "Please, you must listen to Us."

 Atropos reappears.

 "The Lightbringer speaks truthfully when he says you are in a
 precarious position, Timothy, but not for the reasons he gives."  You
 see Morningstar scowl at this. "Your destiny is finished mortal, its
 threads played out upon the skein of Fate, but powers beyond your
 comprehension have thrown this foregone conclusion into doubt. The
 offer the Angel of Light has given you denies the rules of Moira."
 Lachesis appears and watches your confused expression with interest,
 then turns her attention to Morningstar.

 "I have not had time to tell the mortal my offer," he growls through
 gritted teeth. "You have not even given me the chance."  Lachesis grins
 broadly.

 "Then do so, Son of the Dawn," she offers graciously.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Morningstar turns to you and looks deep into your eyes.

 "Timothy Hunter, you have seen the pain and suffering your actions have
 wrought. You have seen the anguish you have caused in those around you,
 and you have seen how the guilt of what you have done has eaten away at
 you. Knowing this, I offer you something which very few are given, yet
 many hope for ... a second chance. You have the opportunity to go back
 and change the past. This I offer to you before you leave the world you
 know forever."

>ask parcae about rules of moira
 "You must keep quiet, Timothy, please!" says Clotho.

 Atropos frowns.

 "But know mortal, that defying your Moira, your fate, is not without
 its price. Perhaps Morningstar is willing to pay it, but are you?  The
 boundaries of your Moira have we clearly marked, and it is not proper
 that you exceed them. Your destiny has been shaped by your choices, and
 this fate you have seen is the destiny you have chosen. But again, your
 choices are everything, and it shall be yours to decide if you shall
 follow Morningstar's path or mine."

 "But Morningstar is correct in that this will be your only opportunity
 to change your Moira, Timothy," says Lachesis. "If you refuse this,
 there will never be another chance."

>wait
 Time passes.

 "But this, still, is not the whole tale, Timothy," says Clotho. "While
 I do concur with Atropos that your choices should remain the same,
 however difficult they are, your choices now can be more than a mere
 replaying of events as you know them. Perhaps this second chance will
 allow you to examine the pain and guilt you have felt, and, if you have
 strength enough, perhaps to face them. But, as always, the choice is
 yours to make."

>wait
 Time passes.

 The rumbling returns suddenly and without warning and with it the
 threads. You flail madly, trying to find your way. The voice of the
 Parcae cuts through the sound, echoing around you. "Look to the
 Tapestry, Timothy. With it, you shall weave your Destiny."  The threads
 heave a final time...

>ask him about choice

 Den
 The living room of your small home lies in disarray, as usual. Between
 work and your mother's condition, you haven't had much time to think
 about house cleaning. To the west is your bedroom; the doorway to the
 north leads to the driveway. The workroom lies to the south.

 Off to one side lies the old fireplace, its soot rolling out onto the
 dirty carpet.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine tapestry
 The tapestry's single panel depicts an old woman in a long flowing
 gown. In one hand, she holds a long thread which she prepares to cut
 with the large pair of scissors she holds in the other.

>examine fireplace
 The chimney being totally clogged with soot, you haven't used it in
 ages. You've been so busy at work lately, you haven't given much
 thought to it. You haven't given much thought to anything...

>examine soot
 It's spilled all over the floor, making a mess of the carpet. You've
 really got to clean this place up sometime.

>clean soot

>clean fireplace

 gown. In one hand, she holds a long thread which she prepares to cut
 with the large pair of scissors she holds in the other.

>pick up carpet

>roll it

>ask woman about thread
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine carpet
 It's a total mess. You've been thinking about replacing it lately, but
 just haven't had the time.

>go west

 Bedroom
 The bedroom isn't much cleaner than the den, with piles of clothes
 covering most of the floor. You wish you had the time to even try to
 make the place look like a human being lives here, but you just never
 seem to. To the east is the den and a small bathroom lies to the south.

 The bed is unmade, as usual.

>make bed

 A quick peek into the bathroom tells you there's nothing of use there.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>go east

 Den

 Off to one side lies the old fireplace, its soot rolling out onto the
 dirty carpet.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

>verbose
 TAPESTRY is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long
 descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>go south

 Work Room
 You've only recently converted this spare room to a workroom to try and
 play catch-up in the evenings and on the weekends. "Converted" isn't
 exactly the right word, since all you did was stick a small table in
 it. The way back to the den lies to the north.

 Your work papers lie in disarray beside the telephone.

 Also on the desk is a small appointment/address book.

>examine papers
 The unorganized heap covers most of the table, some of it even
 extending over the edge, threatening to fall at any moment. You've had
 such a backlog of things to do that it's become harder and harder just
 to keep up and not fall even further behind.

>searchpapers
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>search papers
 You find nothing of interest.

>push papers
 It is fixed in place.

>read papers
 The papers cover a variety of cases. You have no idea where to begin.

>examine telephone
 A standard push-button telephone.

>call 911
 You don't know that phone number.

>take book
 Taken.

>examine it
 Flipping through the address book you see that you've only had time to
 write in two well-used numbers:  Mike Stevens at work and Dr. Hughes at
 Mercy Hospital, the doctor who's handling your mother's care. The only
 information of any importance in the appointment section appears to be
 a notice reading: "Thompson account MUST BE CLOSED BY THIS MONDAY."
 It's written in red ink and underlined five times.

 The Thompson account?  What on Earth is that?  You try and remember,
 but for the life of you you can't recall ever writing down this notice.
 And today's Sunday...

>SAVE
>cf4
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>call mike stevens
 The phone rings for a moment, then Mike's secretary answers.

 "Hello, Foley Consultants, can I help you?"

 "Can I speak with Mr. Stevens please?"

 "Sure Tim, hold on a second."  You hear the click of the line being
 switched over, then Mike picks up.

 "Yeah Tim?  What can I do for you?"

>ask mike about thompson
 Mike sounds shocked.

 "The THOMPSON account?  You mean the charity bit?"

 You have no idea what he's talking about and tell him so.

 "The charity bit!  Come on, you couldn't have FORGOTTEN that?  It was
 your freakin' idea!  The whole problem with the firm's bad press last
 year about the orphanage foreclosure?  So we were going to do a few
 cases for charity ... people who couldn't normally afford us..."

 "...and I offered to take the Thompson account."

 "'xactly, Tim, where's your head BEEN, man?"

 "Oh my God, I totally forgot about it."

 You hear Mike sigh and then a shuffle of papers.

 "Hmm ... let's see. Standard blahblahblahblah, it doesn't look more
 than a two or three day thing. No real need to wo..."  He cuts off.
 "MONDAY Tim?  It's due MONDAY?!  Are you crazy?  Have you even STARTED
 it?!"

 "I've ... I've had a lot on my mind, Mike."

 "Damn, Tim, we all know that, but ... if you couldn't handle it you
 should have said so!  You're the only one who knows anything about the
 account, and you've got all the important papers there!"

 "But, Mike, I've got ... I've got stuff I have to do here."

 "Yeah, like the Thompson account!  Look Tim, I'm not going to tell you
 what to do, and I know that your job's not in the balance here; you've
 been doing too good a job for too long for one little screw up to ruin
 you, especially under these circumstances. But the Thompson's are
 totally depending on the firm here. Don't you realize the reason we
 took the case?  They'll lose everything unless YOU can find a loophole
 that'll at least delay the foreclosure for a while."

 "But couldn't someone ... could you...?"

 "Look Tim, I can't, I've got so much work here that I couldn't even
 look at the account if I wanted to. Not to mention the fact that all
 the important stuff is THERE. No Tim, it's going to be you or no one."
 He pauses. "Look, I've got to go. Call again if you need help with
 something, but the ball's in your court now."  He hangs up.

 You hang up the phone.

>call doctor
 The phone rings a moment and then a female voice answers the phone.

 "Mercy Hospital, how may I help you?"

 "Dr. Hughes please."

 "May I ask who's calling?"

 "Timothy Hunter."

 "One moment, please."  You're put on hold. After a moment, the line
 picks up again.

 "Yes Tim?  How can I help you?"

>ask doctor about mom
 Dr. Hughes laughs.

 "For the millionth time, Tim, she's fine. Seriously, I'm starting to
 think you don't have any faith in us. What is this, the second week in
 a row you've called at least once a day?  You've got to stop worrying.
 Your mother's condition is stable and there's been no sign that would
 lead us to believe we should expect any change. If there were, we'd
 call you."  He pauses. "Look Tim, I'm busy here. Just trust me and
 relax, OK?"

 Amid your protests, he gently hangs up.

 You hang up the phone.

>consult papers about thompson
 You spread the papers out and try to get them organized. You vaguely
 remember that the Thompson account deals with a small family business
 that might be going under. Apparently they don't have enough money to
 hire someone to handle the backlog of taxes that they've been
 accumulating and can't handle it themselves. The papers are broken up
 into several sections: the back records, this year's intake, and the
 forms which need to be filled out.

>call mike
 The phone rings for a moment, then Mike's secretary answers.

 "Hello, Foley Consultants, can I help you?"

 "Can I speak with Mr. Stevens please?"

 "Sure Tim, hold on a second."  You hear the click of the line being
 switched over, then Mike picks up.

 "Yeah, Tim?" Mike says, "What do ya need?"

 Work Room
 You've only recently converted this spare room to a workroom to try and
 play catch-up in the evenings and on the weekends. "Converted" isn't
 exactly the right word, since all you did was stick a small table in
 it. The way back to the den lies to the north.

 Your work papers lie in disarray beside the telephone.

>go north

 Den
 The living room of your small home lies in disarray, as usual. Between
 work and your mother's condition, you haven't had much time to think
 about house cleaning. To the west is your bedroom; the doorway to the

 Off to one side lies the old fireplace, its soot rolling out onto the
 dirty carpet.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

 It's a beautiful spring day, the sun is shining and a soft breeze

 pressures on you; to forget, if for the briefest of moments, your

>examine book
 Flipping through the address book you see that you've only had time to
 write in two well-used numbers:  Mike Stevens at work and Dr. Hughes at
 Mercy Hospital, the doctor who's handling your mother's care. The only
 information of any importance in the appointment section appears to be
 a notice reading: "Thompson account MUST BE CLOSED BY THIS MONDAY."
 It's written in red ink and underlined five times.

>examine forms
 You start flipping through the forms when you realize you don't have
 any of the information required to fill them out.

>examine back records
 The records go back quite a few years. You start reading through them,
 trying to get an impression of what needs to be done. The Thompson's
 have obviously been trying to keep on top of the paperwork, but they
 just didn't have the expertise. Although there's a lot, you realize
 that Mike was right, it's a routine job.

 Several hours later and almost finished with the back-paperwork, you
 realize that an entire year is missing from the records. You can't
 finish the forms without it!

>call mike
 The phone rings for a moment, then Mike's secretary answers.

 "Hello, Foley Consultants, can I help you?"

 "Can I speak with Mr. Stevens please?"

 "Sure Tim, hold on a second."  You hear the click of the line being

 "Yeah, Tim?" Mike says, "What do ya need?"

>ask mike about records
 You explain about the missing records from the papers you have for the
 Thompson account.

 "Hmm ... ok, hold on, let me see if they're up here."  You hear Mike
 put down the phone and then a few minutes of silence. Suddenly, he's
 back on the line. "Yeah Tim, got 'em right here. I don't know how they
 got muffed up like that. Here, let me give you the numbers."  He
 proceeds to help you update the records you need.

 "Thanks Mike, you're a lifesaver."

 "No prob, and good luck on the account!"

 You hang up the phone.

>fill out forms
 You can't see any such thing.

>fill in forms
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine forms
 You start flipping through the forms when you realize that while you
 have the back records done, you haven't completed the intake for the
 current year.

>examine intake
 You begin scanning on the records for the current year, on which the
 Thompsons have done no work at all. You sigh deeply and get to work.

 It seems to take forever, the numbers just don't want to work out.
 Finally, after scanning your work for errors a third time, you decide
 you've got it done as well as you'll ever get it.

>examine forms
 With the completed records in hand, you begin filling out the forms. By
 this point, you're so sick of numbers you find it harder and harder not
 to give up. As you press on, you become worried. You've got to stay
 awake, aware, because any mistakes at this point could be disastrous...

 Four hours later, you're finished. Your hands are cramped from all the
 writing, your mind spinning from the columns of data, but it's done.
 You separate the forms from the rest of papers with a sigh of relief.

 Suddenly you stop short. You forgot about the signatures!  You
 frantically begin scanning the bottom of the forms, praying you won't
 find that they have to be signed with a witness...

 ...and you find that they do. What the hell are you going to do?  It's
 Sunday!  How on Earth are you going to get in touch with a notary
 public this late on a Sunday afternoon?

>call doctor
 The phone rings a moment and then a female voice answers the phone.

 "Mercy Hospital, how may I help you?"

 "Dr. Hughes please."

 "May I ask who's calling?"

 "Timothy Hunter."

 "One moment, please."  You're put on hold. After a moment, the line
 picks up again.

 "Look Tim, I told you I'm very busy here. Is there something you need
 to ask?"

>ask doctor about mom
 The laughter is gone from Dr. Hughes's voice.

 "Look Tim, we've been through this too many times. She's fine. I have
 more important things to deal with right now than getting that through
 that thick skull of yours. Goodbye."

 You hang up the phone.

>call mike
 The phone rings for a moment, then Mike's secretary answers.

 "Hello, Foley Consultants, can I help you?"

 "Can I speak with Mr. Stevens please?"

 "Sure Tim, hold on a second."  You hear the click of the line being

 "Yeah, Tim?" Mike says, "What do ya need?"

>ask mike about notary
 You frantically tell Mike about the signatures you need and that you
 have no idea how to get in touch with the notary public.

 "God-damnit Tim ... I'd totally forgotten. And it's Sunday, shit..."

 "What'r we gonna do, Mike?"

 Silence.

 "No, wait a minute!  I got it!  Look, I've got a friend down a City
 Hall, owes me a couple of favors. I bet I can get the public down in
 his office long enough to get the stuff signed. Listen, I'll call up
 the Thompsons, and my friend. I'll tell 'em to meet you down there in
 one hour. You got that?  Anything over that and we're screwed."

 "Got it, Mike. Oh, and thanks again. You really saved me."

 "No prob, just remember you owe me one."

 "Sure," you say, "I'll see them down there in an hour."

 You hang up the phone.

 As suddenly as you place the receiver back in the cradle, the phone
 rings. You hastily lift the receiver to your ear.

 "Hello?"

 "Yes, hello, may I please speak to Mr. Timothy Hunter?"

 "This is he."

 "Mr. Hunter?  I'm Doctor Feiner, an associate of Doctor Hughes?"

 "Yes, Doctor Feiner, what can I do for you?"

 "Well, Mr. Hunter, it's ... it's about your mother."  A sick certainty
 overcomes you.

 "She's dying," you whisper.

 "Yes, Mr. Hunter, and I'm afraid she won't be lasting much longer. Not
 more than an hour..."

 "Oh God... I'll, I'll..."

 "Whatever you do, Mr. Hunter, please do it quickly. There's not much
 time."

 With trembling hands, you put the phone back down.

 Inside a Taxi Cab
 You're sitting in the back seat of an old and dirty taxi cab. The seat
 springs squeak rustily beneath you, litter covers the floor and the
 windows are covered with grime.

 In the front seat, a cabbie sits waiting impatiently.

 "Where ya wanna go, mac?" he asks as you slip inside.

 The trip seems interminable, the cabbie babbling throughout it. Talk of
 nothing: the weather, the ball game on television last night. You
 hardly hear him. All you can think about is your mother in that vile
 smelling white room, breathing her last. You close your eyes and hope
 you'll get there in time.

 The sunlight flickers over your closed eyelids, making a shadow-dance
 beneath, and you pause, lost for a moment in their flickering patterns.
 Let her be ok ... please, just let her be ok.

 The sudden stop in front of Mercy rudely breaks your reverie.

 "That'll be 15 bucks," says the cabbie, hitting the meter's flag.

 "I'm sorry," you say, handing him your last fifteen dollars, "I don't
 have enough for a tip."

 The cabbie looks at you for a moment, and then slowly smiles.

 "Forget it, buddy. You look like you could use a break."  You profusely
 thank him as you open the taxi's door and rush into the building...

 You rush past the front desk, running for the elevators and slip
 between the doors just as they're closing. You frantically stab at the
 buttons, and then slump against the back wall. First, second, third,
 fourth, hurry god-damn you hurry ... please ... please ... fourth, come
 on ... come on you ... fifth!   The doors slide back and you rush down
 the corridor, almost slipping on the tiles and finally come to a
 screeching halt at the door to your mother's room...

 Hospital Room
 Like a horribly cycling nightmare, you find yourself back in this white
 room stinking of disinfectant. How many times have you been here
 before, in your mind, replaying this possible scene of being here with
 your mother when she died?  And now, it looks as if perhaps you'll get
 your second chance after all...

 Here, unmoving on the hospital bed, lies your mother.
>examine mother
 She lies still in the bed, her eyes closed. Her grey hair falls in long
 locks over her face and from her arm protrudes the clear line of an
 IV-tube, leading to a machine which stands at the bedside.

 For a brief, horrible moment, you think that you're too late ... she's
 gone. But then, you see her chest slowly lift, then lower. She's
 breathing ... she's alive.

 Her eyes flutter for a moment, then slowly open. Her pupils unfocused,
 she looks around the room, finally catching sight of you. She pauses,
 then smiles.
 "Oh Timmy..." she says. You heart catches in your throat as you hear
 how weak her voice is; barely a whisper, hardly stronger than a soft
 breeze. You must have flinched, because her brow furrows and she looks
 at you, concerned. "What's wrong...?"

 Wrong!  Everything, everything's wrong. You're dying and I don't know
 what to do, you're leaving and I don't know how to say goodbye...

 "Nothing, Mama."  You slowly approach the bed and grasp her hand. It's
 cold, and her skin is almost translucent, revealing her tiny bones
 beneath. She's so fragile and so helpless. And she was such a vibrant
 woman, so full of life ... just like Sarah.

 Sarah. The thought makes you pause. Why?  Why did this happen?  They
 were both so wonderful, so caring. They didn't deserve this. She had so
 many years ahead of her, so much to live for.

 She smiles again. "Oh. That's good. You know I worry..." she pauses,
 catching her breath. "You know I worry so much about you..."

 You stroke her hand, biting your lip to stop from crying. "Yeah, yeah I
 know."

 She lifts her head to look up at you, and suddenly you can see a little
 bit of a glint in her eye, a hint at the vibrance that she was so known
 for. She peers at you. "Why ... why aren't you at work?  Aren't you
 always busy at..." The rest is lost in a wheeze as she sags back into
 her pillow.

 "Don't worry, Mom. It's fine. I just thought ... I, I just wanted to
 visit you."

 She smiles. "Well, that's ok, but you've got to take..."  She suddenly
 stops.

 "Mom?  Mama?  Can you hear me?  Are you all..."  Oh no please ...
 please ...

 Her jaw goes slack, then she blinks once or twice. "Oh, oh Timmy ... I
 think ... I think it's time..."

 You begin babbling, not even realizing what you're saying. "No, no
 please. No!  No, you're fine, everything's fine, you'll be ok. Please,
 please!  You're fine!"  Hands grasp your shoulders and begin pulling
 you backwards, you can vaguely hear Doctor Hughes's voice telling you
 that there's nothing you can do, that it's her time, but you don't
 listen to him. You can't. You struggle forwards, trying to get closer
 to the bed. "Please ... please, you're all right, aren't you?  Tell me
 you're all right!"

 She looks up to you serenely, seemingly unaware of your panic. "Shhh.
 It'll be ok, Timmy. Everything will be ok."  She pauses again, then
 closes her eyes, and whispers "I love you Timmy..."

 And then she's gone. You can feel it, she's gone...the room's empty
 now. And then you're falling, clutching her cold form against you and
 crying, lost and alone.

 [Press SPACE to continue]








 You don't know how long you've been lying there crying when the hand
 touches you gently on the shoulder. You look up, about to angrily
 berate Dr. Hughes for telling you that she was all right when she
 wasn't, when you see that it's not the doctor at all...

 "Well done, Timothy," says Morningstar. "You have changed your path,
 and found a way to be here for your mother when she needed you. Leave
 her be now, she goes to a better place."  He gently helps you get to
 your feet.

 He sighs. "But this is only the first step on my path, Timothy. There
 are dangers which still lie ahead. But fear not. You have begun my
 path, and you shall not leave it until it is complete. I shall be here
 to guide you, as you need me."

 The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
 their heaving embrace. They leave you, gasping, back in the Tower...

 Ruined Tower
 The Ivory Tower, where you started this strange adventure, now lies in
 ruins. Its walls lie scorched about you, the roof rent to the open sky.
 The stars, in their impassive brilliance, illuminate the devastation
 below. Over the Tower's remains you catch glimpses of the fires below,
 trees smoldering in the darkness.

 The Tapestry seems to have survived the Tower's destruction intact.

 barreling down upon her.

 Den
 The living room of your small home has changed little since your
 bachelor days, although Sarah's being here has altered it in some small
 ways. She keeps saying how the place needs more of "a woman's touch,"
 but for all her talk, her work kept her too busy to do much, and now
 ... well, she can't do much at all. To the south lies your office, and
 to the west is the bedroom. The doorway to the north leads outside to
 the driveway.

 Off to one side, built into the wall, is a small fireplace.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

>examine fireplace
 You remember the innumerable winter nights you and Sarah sat curled up
 in front of it as you gazed into the fire. God, when was the last time
 you did that?  It's so hard to remember a time before her being
 bedridden.

 On the mantel you notice a small snapshot in a frame.

>examine snapshot
 It's a photograph of you and Sarah out on the lake. She's got her arms
 wrapped around your neck while the two of you grin like maniacs at the
 camera from the little boat you're in. You remember when it was taken.
 Five seconds later, the boat capsized and you and she laughed so hard
 about it you nearly drowned. God, it's been at least a year since last
 you were up there.

>examine tapestry
 The tapestry's single panel depicts a middle-aged woman in a long
 flowing gown. In one hand she holds a slender black rod, which she
 holds up to a long thread which she holds in the other.

 Morningstar, and have taken a single step along it.

 From what you can tell, you're as you've always been.

>go west

 Bedroom
 Your bedroom has been one of the few areas where Sarah's influence has
 been at work. You felt the presence of her long after she had gone, and
 a few months after her death put it back the way it had been. A door to
 the east leads back to the den and to the south is the bathroom.

 Somehow, in this strange world of the past, Sarah still lives. She's
 lying, half asleep, in bed.

 Beside the bed is a small endtable.

>examine sarah
 Your slowly-returning memories do little justice to her. You'd almost
 forgotten how achingly beautiful she was ... is. God, this is so
 confusing. The illness she's battling has taken its toll, but with her
 resting like that, it's almost possible to believe she'll be ok.

 Beside her on the bed, unused, is a large pillow.

>examine pillow
 A large, white pillow. Apparently Sarah doesn't need this one.

>get pillow
 Taken.

>examine endtable
 A small endtable that used to hold Sarah's endless supply of medicines.
 None of them did any good, though. Some may have eased the pain she's
 going through, but the doctors have told you again and again there's no
 cure.

 Built into the endtable is a small drawer.

>open drawer
 Sarah suddenly becomes animated.

 "Timothy, please ... don't do that, ok?  For me?  Just don't open it,
 ok?"  She seems so worried. You nod and she relaxes.

>ask sarah about herself
 Sarah stirs as you approach. She smiles faintly.

 "Hi honey. I'm feeling ok, I guess. I'm just having trouble getting to
 sleep. It's just really hard to go on sometimes."  She pauses, takes
 your hand and looks at you, concerned. "Are you all right?" she asks.
 You nod, and she smiles again.

>ask her about drawer
 "Please Timothy," she begs. "Please, just humor me...?"

>ask sarah about future
 Sarah looks at you, confused. She yawns. Poor thing, better not tax her
 too much.

>humor her
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask sarah about pain
 Sarah looks at you, confused. She yawns. Poor thing, better not tax her
 too much.

>ask sarah about illness
 She opens her eyes and shrugs.

 "It comes and goes. Some days I feel better than others, but..." she
 pauses. "I'm ok, I guess."  She sees the concern in your eyes. "Now
 don't you worry about me," she says, smiling. "I'll be just fine."

 She closes her eyes again.

>look under bed
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine bed
 Your slowly-returning memories do little justice to her. You'd almost
 forgotten how achingly beautiful she was ... is. God, this is so

 resting like that, it's almost possible to believe she'll be ok.

>examine clothes
 You can't see any such thing.

>kiss her
 Sarah grins and tweaks your nose. "I love you."

 "I love you too." you whisper back.

>go south

 Bathroom
 This small bathroom lies to the south of your bedroom. Ever since Sarah
 fell ill, it's been a storehouse of false hopes. Every miracle the
 doctors said might have helped, every drug that might have eased her
 pain has been kept here. And each and every one did nothing.

 Over the sink is a small, mirrored medicine cabinet.

>examine cabinet
 As you approach the cabinet, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the
 mirror. God, is that really you?  You haven't slept well in weeks and
 your pale, haggard reflection looks like a stranger to you.

 The cabinet has a hinged door which is closed.

>open cabinet
 You open the medicine cabinet, revealing a small bottle of pills.

>get pills
 Taken.

>examine pills
 The majority of Sarah's supply of drugs is gone. The doctors have
 pretty much given up by this point, as nothing they've tried has been
 of any use. All that remains is this solitary bottle of pills Sarah
 uses to help her sleep.

>open pills
 That's not something you can open.

>give glass to sarah
 Sarah looks up at you and smiles.

 "Aww ... how sweet, my knight in shining armor come to take me to
 dreamland?"  You help her up and she swallows the pills with a sip of
 water. She takes hold of your hand. You see her lower lip trembling
 slightly. "Thank you Timmy," she whispers, "for everything."

 She lies back down and closes her eyes, but she still has trouble
 falling asleep. God, you wish she could sleep forever, away from the
 sickness and the pain.

 Sarah becomes severely agitated this time.

 "Please, please ... don't ... please."  You can't understand what about
 the drawer has gotten her so worked up. To keep her calm, you agree not

 Den
 The living room of your small home has changed little since your

 ways. She keeps saying how the place needs more of "a woman's touch,"
 but for all her talk, her work kept her too busy to do much, and now

 Office
 You've had a place to do work for years, but only recently have you
 used it enough to actually call it an office. Even at that, it's not
 much of one, with your desk as the only furniture. The door to the
 north leads into the living room.

 The remainder of your work papers lie on your desk, next to the
 telephone.

 Built into your desk is a small desk drawer.

>open drawer
 You open the desk drawer, revealing an address book.

>examine address book
 You just recently got this address book and for the most part, it's
 empty. There are a few numbers of family and friends, and a few work
 numbers. The most important one you notice as you scan through the book
 is Sarah's doctor, Dr. Albero at Mercy Hospital.

>get it
 Taken.

>call albero
 The phone rings a moment and then a female voice answers the phone.

 "Mercy Hospital, how may I help you?"

 "Dr. Albero please."

 "May I ask who's calling?"

 "Timothy Hunter."

 "One moment, please."  You're put on hold. After a moment, the line
 picks up again.

 "Yes Tim?  How can I help you?"

>ask albero about sarah
 "No change in her condition?  I'm not surprised, Tim. We've been
 through this before and I've told you again and again: there's nothing
 we can do for her now."

>ask albero about cancer

 "Look Tim, I've very busy here. Is there something you wanted?"

>no
 That was a rhetorical question.

 Dr. Albero's voice turns angry. "I know you're under a lot of stress
 here, Tim, but this is inexcusable."  He hangs up.

 You hang up the phone.

>examine papers
 These papers are the remainder for you work for this week. You've been
 working on a couple of different cases for the firm, mostly taking care
 of backlog paperwork. Mind-numbing stuff to be sure, but at least it's
 the kind you can do at home. The last case left is for, of all places,
 Mercy Hospital.

>consult papers about mercy hospital
 You find nothing on that subject in Mercy Hospital's financial papers.

 You don't see any such thing.

 You don't see any such thing.

>fill out forms
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine financial papers
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the budget.

>examine budget
 You flip through the project papers and find the budget proposal for
 the experimental research project. Looking at it, everything seems to
 be in order, but then something odd catches your eye. The funding
 request is exceedingly large, but then again, that's expected for so
 important a project. The oddity comes out in the net results. There's a
 huge difference between what they're spending on equipment and the like
 and what's being given to the good doctor for costs. Checking further,
 you find that he in fact has cut out a good portion of the subjects for
 the test, no reason given. And yet the money for those subjects is
 still figured in the budget. Where the hell did the money go?

>call mike
 You don't know that phone number.

>examine family
 You can't see any such thing.

>call work
 You don't know that phone number.

 You discover nothing of interest in the address book.

 "Dr. Albero please."

 "May I ask who's calling?"

 "Timothy Hunter."

 "One moment, please."  You're put on hold. After a moment, the line
 picks up again.

 "Yes Tim?  How can I help you?"


 Dr. Albero remains silent as you point out the differences in his
 project's budget and doesn't answer when you ask about what happened to
 the money for the additional subjects. Without warning, he begins
 shouting at you.

 "Bastard," he hisses. "What the hell is this?!  I'm handling the
 project as I see fit. Who the hell are you to question what I'm doing
 with the funding?!  Who told you to do this, tell me!"

 You don't answer.

 "Damn you!  Why are you doing this?!  What the hell do you want?"

>ask alberto about sarah
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask albero about sarah
 Dr. Albero is silent for a moment.

 "What the hell does Sarah have to do with the project's budget?" he
 asks.

>ask albero about treatment

 "So it's to be blackmail, is it?  You want Sarah on that list.
 God-damnit, I never expected this of you, Tim."  He pauses, thinking.
 "Fine!" he says, "I'll pull something off. Bring her down here to sign
 the release forms and she'll be in. And in return, you tell no one
 about what you know, agreed?"

 "Agreed, and no placebos."

 "Fine, fine, but I warn you Tim, no doublecrossing, or you'll regret
 it. Accidents have a way of happening in experiments like this."  He
 hangs up.

 You hang up the phone.

 Sarah sits up as you approach. She sees how excited you are.

 "What is it, Tim?"  Excitedly, you tell her about the program at Mercy
 Hospital and how Dr. Albero has agreed to let her on the subject list
 as one of the ones who will really receive the treatment. You omit how
 you got him to agree to this.

 Sarah's reaction surprises you. Rather than being happy, she seems sad.

 "Really?  A possible cure. I never thought of that."  She shakes her
 head. "No, Timmy, I don't think I could go through that. Not another
 false hope. You said yourself it's experimental, they don't even know
 how it would affect me."  She seems to reach a decision. "No Timmy,
 thank you, but it's too late for me."

 You sigh. You wish there was some way you could convince her that life
 was worth living.

 hand. "We had some pretty good times, didn't we?  Tell me a story,
 Timmy." she says, "tell me about the lake.

>tell sarah about lake
 You tell Sarah the story, embellishing what really happened. That
 always made her laugh, the way you used to exaggerate everything until
 it became bigger than life. She smiles, remembering.

 "Oh, we had so much fun, didn't we?"  She yawns, then pats your hand.
 "I think I've had enough excitement for one day, I'm going to take a

 MERCY HOSPITAL TO BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PROGRAM

 Yesterday in a press conference, Dr. Robert Albero announced that Mercy
 Hospital has been chosen to head a newly implemented experimental
 program for the possible treatment of Apentrylic Syndrome. The
 program's main component is phenylhydroxythiol (Phenotol), a drug newly
 developed at Ciba-Gigey Laboratories with government funding. Dr.
 Albero will head the experiment that will give pre-selected groups the
 treatment over a period of six weeks to gauge its effectiveness on
 human subjects.

 The drug has been shown to successfully combat the disease in
 laboratory animals, and, if the current experiments are successful, Dr.
 Albero hopes to see FDA approval for distribution by as early as next
 year. Subjects for the experiment have been chosen with specific
 criteria used to test the treatment's effectiveness on humans of
 varying characteristics such as sex and age. Several groups will be
 tested, with certain groups given placebos as a control.

 However, not all of Dr. Albero's associates are as optimistic about the
 results. "There's absolutely no reason to assume the treatment will be
 as effective on humans as it has been on laboratory animals," said one
 who asked to remain anonymous. "He's putting it totally out of
 proportion to say that it'll be approved by next year. I'd be surprised
 if it's available within the next five. There still remains an
 extensive amount of research to be done."

 Inside a Taxi Cab
 You're sitting in the back seat of an old and dirty taxi cab. The seat
 springs squeak rustily beneath you, litter covers the floor and the
 windows are covered with grime.

 In the front seat, a cabbie sits waiting impatiently.

>examine cabbie
 A non-descript man who seems almost as old and decrepit as the car he
 drives. He drums the steering wheel in an angry rhythm, obviously
 impatient at having to wait.

>ask cabbie about hospital
 "You got it, mac" says the cabbie as he hits starts the meter and pulls
 out of the driveway...

 [Press SPACE to continue]








 The trip seems interminable, the cabbie babbling throughout it. Talk of
 nothing: the weather, the ball game on television last night. You
 hardly hear him. All you can think about is your mother in that vile
 smelling white room, breathing her last. You close your eyes and hope
 you'll get there in time.

 The sunlight flickers over your closed eyelids, making a shadow-dance
 beneath, and you pause, lost for a moment in their flickering patterns.
 Let her be ok ... please, just let her be ok.

 The sudden stop in front of Mercy rudely breaks your reverie.

 "That'll be 15 bucks," says the cabbie, hitting the meter's flag.

 "I'm sorry," you say, handing him your last fifteen dollars, "I don't
 have enough for a tip."

 The cabbie looks at you for a moment, and then slowly smiles.

 "Forget it, buddy. You look like you could use a break."  You profusely
 thank him as you open the taxi's door and rush into the building...

 You rush past the front desk, running for the elevators and slip
 between the doors just as they're closing. You frantically stab at the
 buttons, and then slump against the back wall. First, second, third,
 fourth, hurry god-damn you hurry ... please ... please ... fourth, come
 on ... come on you ... fifth!   The doors slide back and you rush down
 the corridor, almost slipping on the tiles and finally come to a
 screeching halt at the door to your mother's room...

 Hospital Room
 Like a horribly cycling nightmare, you find yourself back in this white
 room stinking of disinfectant. How many times have you been here
 before, in your mind, replaying this possible scene of being here with
 your mother when she died?  And now, it looks as if perhaps you'll get
 your second chance after all...

 Here, unmoving on the hospital bed, lies your mother.
>examine mother
 She lies still in the bed, her eyes closed. Her grey hair falls in long
 locks over her face and from her arm protrudes the clear line of an
 IV-tube, leading to a machine which stands at the bedside.

 For a brief, horrible moment, you think that you're too late ... she's
 gone. But then, you see her chest slowly lift, then lower. She's
 breathing ... she's alive.

 Her eyes flutter for a moment, then slowly open. Her pupils unfocused,
 she looks around the room, finally catching sight of you. She pauses,
 then smiles.
 "Oh Timmy..." she says. You heart catches in your throat as you hear
 how weak her voice is; barely a whisper, hardly stronger than a soft
 breeze. You must have flinched, because her brow furrows and she looks
 at you, concerned. "What's wrong...?"

 Wrong!  Everything, everything's wrong. You're dying and I don't know
 what to do, you're leaving and I don't know how to say goodbye...

 "Nothing, Mama."  You slowly approach the bed and grasp her hand. It's
 cold, and her skin is almost translucent, revealing her tiny bones
 beneath. She's so fragile and so helpless. And she was such a vibrant
 woman, so full of life ... just like Sarah.

 Sarah. The thought makes you pause. Why?  Why did this happen?  They
 were both so wonderful, so caring. They didn't deserve this. She had so
 many years ahead of her, so much to live for.

 She smiles again. "Oh. That's good. You know I worry..." she pauses,
 catching her breath. "You know I worry so much about you..."

 You stroke her hand, biting your lip to stop from crying. "Yeah, yeah I
 know."

 She lifts her head to look up at you, and suddenly you can see a little
 bit of a glint in her eye, a hint at the vibrance that she was so known
 for. She peers at you. "Why ... why aren't you at work?  Aren't you
 always busy at..." The rest is lost in a wheeze as she sags back into
 her pillow.

 "Don't worry, Mom. It's fine. I just thought ... I, I just wanted to
 visit you."

 She smiles. "Well, that's ok, but you've got to take..."  She suddenly
 stops.

 "Mom?  Mama?  Can you hear me?  Are you all..."  Oh no please ...
 please ...

 Her jaw goes slack, then she blinks once or twice. "Oh, oh Timmy ... I
 think ... I think it's time..."

 You begin babbling, not even realizing what you're saying. "No, no
 please. No!  No, you're fine, everything's fine, you'll be ok. Please,
 please!  You're fine!"  Hands grasp your shoulders and begin pulling
 you backwards, you can vaguely hear Doctor Hughes's voice telling you
 that there's nothing you can do, that it's her time, but you don't
 listen to him. You can't. You struggle forwards, trying to get closer
 to the bed. "Please ... please, you're all right, aren't you?  Tell me
 you're all right!"

 She looks up to you serenely, seemingly unaware of your panic. "Shhh.
 It'll be ok, Timmy. Everything will be ok."  She pauses again, then
 closes her eyes, and whispers "I love you Timmy..."

 And then she's gone. You can feel it, she's gone...the room's empty
 now. And then you're falling, clutching her cold form against you and
 crying, lost and alone.

 [Press SPACE to continue]








 You don't know how long you've been lying there crying when the hand
 touches you gently on the shoulder. You look up, about to angrily
 berate Dr. Hughes for telling you that she was all right when she
 wasn't, when you see that it's not the doctor at all...

 "Well done, Timothy," says Morningstar. "You have changed your path,
 and found a way to be here for your mother when she needed you. Leave
 her be now, she goes to a better place."  He gently helps you get to
 your feet.

 He sighs. "But this is only the first step on my path, Timothy. There
 are dangers which still lie ahead. But fear not. You have begun my
 path, and you shall not leave it until it is complete. I shall be here
 to guide you, as you need me."

 The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
 their heaving embrace. They leave you, gasping, back in the Tower...

 Ruined Tower
 The Ivory Tower, where you started this strange adventure, now lies in
 ruins. Its walls lie scorched about you, the roof rent to the open sky.
 The stars, in their impassive brilliance, illuminate the devastation

 trees smoldering in the darkness.

 The Tapestry seems to have survived the Tower's destruction intact.

 Suddenly the rumbling returns, and the threads throw you into their

 The living room of your small home has changed little since your
 bachelor days, although Sarah's being here has altered it in some small
 ways. She keeps saying how the place needs more of "a woman's touch,"
 but for all her talk, her work kept her too busy to do much, and now
 ... well, she can't do much at all. To the south lies your office, and
 to the west is the bedroom. The doorway to the north leads outside to

 Off to one side, built into the wall, is a small fireplace.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the

 Driveway
 The driveway you stand in is somewhat useless, as neither you nor Sarah
 own a car. Still, it's nice to get out of the house for a moment. The
 gloom that seems to have settled over the house since Sarah's falling
 ill is lessened slightly here. You can almost fool yourself into
 thinking she's well again. The entrance to the house lies to the south.

 You can see today's newspaper here.

 MERCY HOSPITAL TO BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PROGRAM

 Yesterday in a press conference, Dr. Robert Albero announced that Mercy
 Hospital has been chosen to head a newly implemented experimental
 program for the possible treatment of Apentrylic Syndrome. The
 program's main component is phenylhydroxythiol (Phenotol), a drug newly
 developed at Ciba-Gigey Laboratories with government funding. Dr.
 Albero will head the experiment that will give pre-selected groups the
 treatment over a period of six weeks to gauge its effectiveness on
 human subjects.

 The drug has been shown to successfully combat the disease in
 laboratory animals, and, if the current experiments are successful, Dr.
 Albero hopes to see FDA approval for distribution by as early as next
 year. Subjects for the experiment have been chosen with specific
 criteria used to test the treatment's effectiveness on humans of
 varying characteristics such as sex and age. Several groups will be
 tested, with certain groups given placebos as a control.

 However, not all of Dr. Albero's associates are as optimistic about the
 results. "There's absolutely no reason to assume the treatment will be
 as effective on humans as it has been on laboratory animals," said one
 who asked to remain anonymous. "He's putting it totally out of
 proportion to say that it'll be approved by next year. I'd be surprised
 if it's available within the next five. There still remains an
 extensive amount of research to be done."

 Office
 You've had a place to do work for years, but only recently have you
 used it enough to actually call it an office. Even at that, it's not
 much of one, with your desk as the only furniture. The door to the
 north leads into the living room.

 The remainder of your work papers lie on your desk, next to the
 telephone.

 Built into your desk is a small desk drawer.

>call albero
 The phone rings a moment and then a female voice answers the phone.

 "Mercy Hospital, how may I help you?"

 "Dr. Albero please."

 "May I ask who's calling?"

 "Timothy Hunter."

 "One moment, please."  You're put on hold. After a moment, the line
 picks up again.

 "Yes Tim?  How can I help you?"

>ask him about experimental treatment program

 Dr. Albero seems in shock that you know about the treatment. He listens
 silently as you angrily berate him for not telling you about it, or
 putting Sarah on the test list. After a moment, he speaks.

 "I'm sorry Tim, I really am, but we checked her out against the
 criteria for the program and she just didn't fit. That's why I didn't
 tell you about it. I knew you'd be upset. There isn't even a guarantee
 that it will work; it's experimental, after all. And even if I did get
 her in the program, there's a good chance she'd have been in the group
 receiving the placebo. I'm sorry, but I just can't help you."

 Amid your protests, Dr. Albero gently hangs up.

 You hang up the phone.

>look up albero in papers
 You flip through the papers until you find Dr. Albero's section.
 Apparently he's quite prominent at the hospital, since he's done quite
 a few projects over the years. They're listed in chronological order,
 and the most recent one, an experimental drug treatment program,
 catches your eye.

>read about program
 What do you want to read about that in?

>papers
 The treatment program is the same one that you read about in today's
 newspaper. The papers contain information on the proposed method, the
 budget proposal, and the expected results.

>read method in papers
 You flip through the section several times, but find nothing
 noteworthy.

>read results in papers
 You flip through the section several times, but find nothing
 noteworthy.

>read budget in papers
 You flip through the project papers and find the budget proposal for
 the experimental research project. Looking at it, everything seems to
 be in order, but then something odd catches your eye. The funding
 request is exceedingly large, but then again, that's expected for so
 important a project. The oddity comes out in the net results. There's a
 huge difference between what they're spending on equipment and the like
 and what's being given to the good doctor for costs. Checking further,
 you find that he in fact has cut out a good portion of the subjects for
 the test, no reason given. And yet the money for those subjects is
 still figured in the budget. Where the hell did the money go?

>call albero
 The phone rings a moment and then a female voice answers the phone.

 "Mercy Hospital, how may I help you?"

 "Dr. Albero please."

 "May I ask who's calling?"

 "Timothy Hunter."

 "One moment, please."  You're put on hold. After a moment, the line
 picks up again.

 "I told you Tim, I can't help you. Is there something else you wanted
 to ask about?"

>ask him about budget

 Dr. Albero remains silent as you point out the differences in his
 project's budget and doesn't answer when you ask about what happened to
 the money for the additional subjects. Without warning, he begins
 shouting at you.

 "Bastard," he hisses. "What the hell is this?!  I'm handling the
 project as I see fit. Who the hell are you to question what I'm doing
 with the funding?!  Who told you to do this, tell me!"

 You don't answer.

 "Damn you!  Why are you doing this?!  What the hell do you want?"

>ask him about sarah
 Dr. Albero is silent for a moment.

 "What the hell does Sarah have to do with the project's budget?" he
 asks.

>ask him about project

 "So it's to be blackmail, is it?  You want Sarah on that list.
 God-damnit, I never expected this of you, Tim."  He pauses, thinking.
 "Fine!" he says, "I'll pull something off. Bring her down here to sign
 the release forms and she'll be in. And in return, you tell no one
 about what you know, agreed?"

 "Agreed, and no placebos."

 "Fine, fine, but I warn you Tim, no doublecrossing, or you'll regret
 it. Accidents have a way of happening in experiments like this."  He
 hangs up.

 You hang up the phone.

 Bedroom
 Your bedroom has been one of the few areas where Sarah's influence has
 been at work. You felt the presence of her long after she had gone, and
 a few months after her death put it back the way it had been. A door to
 the east leads back to the den and to the south is the bathroom.

 Somehow, in this strange world of the past, Sarah still lives. She's
 lying, half asleep, in bed.

 Beside the bed is a small endtable.

>show newspaper to sarah
 Sarah sits up as you approach. She sees how excited you are.

 "What is it, Tim?"  Excitedly, you tell her about the program at Mercy
 Hospital and how Dr. Albero has agreed to let her on the subject list
 as one of the ones who will really receive the treatment. You omit how
 you got him to agree to this.

 Sarah's reaction surprises you. Rather than being happy, she seems sad.

 "Really?  A possible cure. I never thought of that."  She shakes her
 head. "No, Timmy, I don't think I could go through that. Not another
 false hope. You said yourself it's experimental, they don't even know
 how it would affect me."  She seems to reach a decision. "No Timmy,
 thank you, but it's too late for me."

 You sigh. You wish there was some way you could convince her that life
 was worth living.

 (to Sarah)
 "Oh Timmy. We had so much fun up there, didn't we?  'The Sweet
 Audrina.'"  She laughs. God, we we almost drowned, didn't we?"  You
 laugh with her for a moment, then you both fall silent. She takes your
 hand. "We had some pretty good times, didn't we?  Tell me a story,
 Timmy." she says, "tell me about the lake.

>tell her about lake
 You can't see "her" (the mother) at the moment.

>tell sarah about lake
 You tell Sarah the story, embellishing what really happened. That
 always made her laugh, the way you used to exaggerate everything until
 it became bigger than life. She smiles, remembering.

 "Oh, we had so much fun, didn't we?"  You nod.

 "Remember when we were happy, Sarah?  Remember how it was before all of
 this?  We can be like that again, I swear it ... please ..."

 Sarah seems lost in thought, her feelings torn between the hopelessness
 she has felt for so long and the possible release that lies before her.
 She pauses, sighs, and then look up to you.

 "Ok, Timothy. For you .. for you, I'll try one last time."

 You smile and kiss her. "This will work, Sarah, I swear it ... you'll
 see."

 Sarah looks at you oddly for a moment, then closes her eyes.

 "I know, Tim, I know ... now, let me get some sleep, ok?  We'll go to
 the hospital later."

 You sneak out of the room, and close the door silently. Morningstar is
 waiting for you in the living room. He smiles broadly.

 "Well done, my friend. You have fought the evil that you planted so
 long ago in the past. You have saved your wife's life, and your own
 soul."

 "Two steps now, Timothy, along my path. You have done well, and a
 greater challenge still lies ahead. But I have faith in you Timothy,

 You turn the corner with a sigh, glancing at the street sign in a
 feeble, half-hearted attempt to figure out where you are. You've left
 the old familiar neighborhood far behind you tonight, as you have
 almost every night. Each outing seems to take you a little further, to
 an area a little stranger and more dangerous.

 Tonight, you didn't even bother giving yourself an excuse. Before, it
 had been that you had somewhere to go, something to do. Not tonight.
 Some indeterminate time ago, you stumbled out of the house, stuck the
 key in the ignition, and just started driving.

 The sharp honk of a nearby car breaks your musings. You glance upward
 to see a pair of girls, jump ropes under their arms, pigtails flying
 behind them, run across the street, right in front of your car...

 Time slows as you slam down on your brakes. For a moment, you don't
 think you'll make it, but with a squeal of the tires, your old Dodge
 manages to grind to a halt in time. The girls make it across, laughing
 all the while, unaware of how close death has come.

 Your Car
 The old hunk of junk has served you pretty well in the past few years.
 You could probably afford something better, but why bother?  It runs,
 it gets you to work and back. What more could you want?  What more do
 you need?

 The buildings outside seem mostly tenements, their residents escaping
 the sweltering evening by sitting outside on the stone porches, the
 sidewalks. The girls continue on their way, and soon enter a tenement.

 With a sigh a relief, you step on the gas and continue on your way.

>examine car

 The further you go, the more convinced you're only getting yourself
 more lost. If anything, the neighborhoods are getting worse. The
 homeless are more and visible, and the buildings are more decrepit.

>drive
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 As your mind begins to wander, your attention to the road slips. It's
 been so long since you've been able to just stop; to put all that's
 happened and all you've done behind. The scars that are left won't fade
 that easily.

>push brake
 You attempt to stop the car, but you find that you can't move your feet
 to the break. What's going on here?  They told you you had a choice,
 that you had some control over what was happening!

 You withdraw even further into yourself and soon lose all track of time
 and place. Wandering the ruin of your life and the wreckage of your
 past, you find yourself lost in more than one way.

>push brake
 You attempt to stop the car, but you find that you can't move your feet
 to the break. What's going on here?  They told you you had a choice,
 that you had some control over what was happening!

 "Now..."

 A whisper calls you back, breaking your reverie. Your eyes focus again,
 seeing through the window.

 "No..."

 It's all you can get out before the flash. Yet in that instant you see
 the scene with perfect clarity: the curb, far too close, the front
 wheels about to strike it. And there, a little further: the young woman
 falling. She's still looking downward, still unaware of her impending
 death.

 And then the flash, and time slows. The few seconds left before your
 death stretch, lengthen, and twist about on themselves. It seems you
 have a moment of reprieve ... but a single moment only.

>push brake
 It's too late now. Stepping on the brakes would only prolong the
 inevitable, and possibly only succeed in flipping the car completely
 over.

 The car inches closer to the curb, striking it. You see the car dip,
 sparks flashing out onto the pavement, yet you feel nothing. You are
 detached, separated somehow. And still the girl sees nothing.

>push horn
 You can't see any such thing.

>honk
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>turn wheel
 The wheel spins in your hands wildly as you futilely attempt to control
 it.

 You rebound, sending the car into the air. Closer now, you see her
 slowly lifting her head, about to realize the flying mass of metal that
 will end her life. Beyond, on the curb, you can make out the figure you
 saw in the tableau, eyes ablaze and mouth agape, attempting to scramble
 to its feet.

>examine figure
 He's terrified for some reason, while crawling his way across the
 pavement towards the helpless girl.

 The car strikes the pavement with a resounding force, the tires
 squealing as they touch ground. Your headlights strike the girl full in
 the face, illuminating her in a blinding halo.

>turn wheel
 The tires spin and squeal wildly as you turn the wheel sharply, sending
 the car into a tailspin. Somehow, by some miracle, it's enough.
 Practically flipping over, the car somehow manages to swerve around the
 girl.

 But it's too much, the car is listing dangerously to the right, and in
 an attempt to stop from tipping over, you turn the wheel sharply to the
 left.

 Before you can react, the light flashes again, and time contracts to
 its normal pace, just as the car spins out of control, heading directly
 for the figure on the sidewalk...

 The last thing you remember is an overwhelming feeling of guilt and
 regret, forcing its way through the chaos that surrounds you and then
 there is...

 Everything
 Chaos, complete and utter. While the threads of the Tapestry gave you
 some sense of closure, of being contained, the place where you are now
 is paradoxically vast and empty, and yet somehow filled. Filled with
 images and sound, form and motion, a shifting menagerie with neither
 rhyme nor reason. A filled void, an ever-changing structure whose
 bounds you can not even begin to imagine. Your senses reel at the
 assault from every angle.

 You know yourself and your past. You have chosen the Path of
 Morningstar, and have taken two steps along it.

>look

 "Well done..."

 The voice behind you startles you, causing you to swiftly turn around.
 Your vision blurs sickeningly for a moment, as you take in the chaotic
 panorama that surrounds you. Then, your eyes clearing, you see
 Morningstar standing before you, smiling and obviously unaffected by
 the confusion that he is at the center of.

 "Beautiful, is it not?" he asks, looking about. "The whole of creation
 is here, Timothy, all existence, all possibility. Pure change lies
 here, mortal, for to be all forms at all times is to be no form at all.
 It is from here that the threads of creation are woven, from whence the
 Tapestry of your life springs. It is here that we are able to bend
 those threads to our whim, to change your destiny for the better."  He
 pauses, then smiles. "Forgive me," he says. "I merely wished you to see
 this, to understand some part of the great work we do."

 "And with this, we are finished. Well done, traveler!  You have looked
 upon the evil of your ways and done your best to mend them and you have
 wisely taken advantage of your second chance. The Path you have
 followed is now at an end; the Tapestry is finished, its threads
 rewoven. And now, the time has come to leave this place of indecision,
 and face whatever destiny lies before you. I wish you well."

 Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are

 Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died.

 This was only natural, being mortal. The life he led was probably most
 unusual in its normalcy; his childhood so much so as to be mundane.
 Neither praised nor reviled, neither a leader nor an outcast, he was
 simply another face in the crowd. He went to school, he studied, he did
 well enough to get by. After graduation he found a job he was good at
 and paid well enough. He bought a little house and lived there, a
 bother to no one, and the days just flowed one into the other...

 In fact, the first event of any importance in his life was the death of
 his mother.

 She had been ill for some time, but Timothy tried not to think about
 it. He'd placed her in Mercy Hospital mostly to forget about her, to
 get on with his life. Apparently, however, it wasn't good enough. His
 work suffered, his productivity slipped. On the Sunday that she died,
 he realized that the charity case he had been doing for the firm wasn't
 yet finished. Half-way through his frantic working, he received a phone
 call from Mercy Hospital. They gave her an hour at the most.

 Something must have happened then; the guilt that Timothy had felt at
 putting her in the Hospital must have caught up with him. On the spot,
 he decided that he couldn't finish the Thompson account.

 Calling his friend Mike at the firm, he quickly described his mother's
 condition and that the Thompson account would not be finished on time.
 Racing to his mother's side, he was there in her final moments,
 comforting her as best he could, apologizing for what he had done.

 The Thompson's lost everything they had ever worked for.

 The time after his mother's death was a lonely one for Timothy, perhaps
 because, for the first time, he realized he was truly alone. Then, he
 met Sarah, and everything changed. She was so loving, so full of life,
 so willing to drag him from the small, empty world he had built for
 himself. They complemented each other so well: her spontaneity to his
 structure, her boundless energy to his complacency. Their whirlwind
 romance caught him totally unawares, and when she accepted his proposal
 of marriage, he thought himself the happiest man on earth.

 Truly, their first five years together were the happiest time of his
 life. The experience of having his life so intricately tied to another
 was exhiliarating; he built his entire existence around her.

 Which is why her falling ill struck him so hard.

 It was agonizing for Timothy to see her wasting away. "Apentrylic
 Syndrome" they called it, a metabolic disorder carried in a recessive
 gene. There wasn't a cure, they told him, and they didn't think she'd
 last more than a year.

 They were wrong. For five years, Timothy watched his wife slowly
 rotting away from the inside. Her energy faded, her strength tapped
 away. The similarity to his mother was horrifying, both women clinging
 to life in a way that was almost unnatural. The strain on Timothy was
 telling, and when he happened upon the article discussing a possible
 cure to the Syndrome, he was overjoyed.

 But, upon realizing it was Dr. Albero who was running the program, he
 fell into a rage. Calling the hospital, he angrily demanded why Sarah
 had not been entered into the program. The doctor's excuses of placebos
 and control groups meant nothing to him and, in an attempt to make the
 bastard agree to let her in the program, happened upon the project's
 budget. Calling the good doctor back, he causally mentioned the
 discrepancy in the monies.

 Under the threat of blackmail, Albero agreed to allow Sarah the
 treatment. And, miraculously, it worked. Sarah got better, although she
 was never again the vibrant woman Timothy remembered.

 Halfway through the program, Dr. Albero mysteriously committed suicide,
 for reasons unknown.

 The time after Sarah's crisis was much like it had been before his
 mother's death; his life mundane, his existence centered around his
 work. The disease had taken away much of Sarah's vitality, and her zest
 for life was never the same. His time devoted more and more to himself
 and his work, he began to withdraw more and more from the world at
 large. At night, he drove around the city alone, trying to find the
 meaning of what had happened to him, of why such things had happened to
 him.

 The night he died was such a night. He had been driving for hours, only
 half paying attention to what was going on. Then, from nowhere, a young
 girl ran into the middle of the road. With a cry and acting purely on
 what must have been instinct, he wrenched the wheel to the right,
 narrowly missing the young woman and almost flipping the car over. In
 an attempt to right himself, he swerved to the left ... and struck a
 young man standing on the sidewalk. Both he and Timothy were killed on
 impact. Afterwards, it was revealed that the young man was the woman's
 boyfriend. They had had an argument and in an attempt to get away from
 him, she had half pushed, half been pushed into the the road. Timothy's
 quick thinking had merely exchanged the death of one of the lovers for
 the other.

 Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died. To say anything more would
 be futile speculation.

 Congratulations. You have completed the story of TAPESTRY. You have
 chosen the Path of Morningstar, and have followed it to its conclusion.

 TAPESTRY contains three mutually-exclusive endings. If you wish, you
 can play again, choose a different Path, and see how your actions

 First, I would like to thank the following people for their invaluable
 help:

      Timothy "Hunter" Evanson -- for being there at the story's
 conception.
           It wouldn't be half the game it became without him.
      Sabrina "Stinky" Ravipinto -- for love, support, and MORE patience
           than any human being could possibly require.
      Steph "Psych-o" Barnett -- for story ideas and all that important
           rat-training info.
      David "Astro" Walton -- for nitpicking above and beyond the call
 of duty.
      David "OG" Learn -- for makin' Astro's nitpickin' look like
 nothin'.
      Allison "Squeaky" Tumarkin -- for writing something even odder
 than
           TAPESTRY.
      Niki "Willow" Hinson -- for smartening up the parser by whining
 that
           it was stupid.
      Andy "The Boy" Olson -- for a million-and-one Bible references.
      Audra "Oh I Had A Little Chicken" Senato -- for alpha-testing and
           backup-singing.
      Mike "Milk" Shultz -- for fitting me into his ever-busy schedule.
      Erika "Erika" Stoll -- for putting up with my eccentricities long
           enough to beta-test.


 A BIG thank you to the IF Competition Betatesters:

      Michael "The Legend" Kinyon -- Simply the best tester I've ever
 had the
            pleasure to work with. Period.
      "V. BALAVAGE" -- for great comments and a ton of information for
            my NEXT game.
      Also thanks to Charles Carr and Jarrod Henry.


 This game was an attempt to see if a serious and interesting story
 could be merged with traditional IF 'puzzle' elements without one
 overshadowing the other. Also, I attempted to tackle a few of the
 issues that have been discussed recently on r.a.i-f, including
 mutually-exclusive paths, a pre-defined main character, moral dilemmas,
 'puzzle-less' IF, and semi-realistic NPCs.

 I hope that I've come close to achieving my goals and have entertained
 you in the process. I would love to hear any and all comments or
 constructive criticism you may have. My current e-mail address can be
 found by using the 'AUTHOR' command.

 Thanks!  -d

 Fleeting glimpses of faces half-remembered in the gloom. Screams, the
 sound of squealing tires, a sudden thump, a sickening crunch and a
 violent jolt followed by a sense of weightlessness and disassociation.
 The last thing you remember is an overwhelming feeling of guilt and
 regret, forcing its way through the chaos that surrounds you and then
 there is...

 Nothing
 Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are
 opened or closed. Concepts like time and place have no meaning here.
 Your mind attempts to impose something, some order, some structure,
 upon the space in which you exist, and fails. There is only the void.
 For all you know, that is all there ever was.

 Ruined Tower
 The Ivory Tower, where you started this strange adventure, now lies in
 ruins. Its walls lie scorched about you, the roof rent to the open sky.
 The stars, in their impassive brilliance, illuminate the devastation
 below. Over the Tower's remains you catch glimpses of the fires below,
 trees smoldering in the darkness.

 The Tapestry seems to have survived the Tower's destruction intact.

 Den
 The living room of your small home lies in disarray, as usual. Between
 work and your mother's condition, you haven't had much time to think
 about house cleaning. To the west is your bedroom; the doorway to the
 north leads to the driveway. The workroom lies to the south.

 Off to one side lies the old fireplace, its soot rolling out onto the
 dirty carpet.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

>go south

 Work Room
 You've only recently converted this spare room to a workroom to try and
 play catch-up in the evenings and on the weekends. "Converted" isn't
 exactly the right word, since all you did was stick a small table in
 it. The way back to the den lies to the north.

 Your work papers lie in disarray beside the telephone.

 Also on the desk is a small appointment/address book.

>read book
 Flipping through the address book you see that you've only had time to
 write in two well-used numbers:  Mike Stevens at work and Dr. Hughes at
 Mercy Hospital, the doctor who's handling your mother's care. The only
 information of any importance in the appointment section appears to be
 a notice reading: "Thompson account MUST BE CLOSED BY THIS MONDAY."
 It's written in red ink and underlined five times.

 The Thompson account?  What on Earth is that?  You try and remember,
 but for the life of you you can't recall ever writing down this notice.
 And today's Sunday...

>open drawer
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine paper
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine table
 You shoved it in here when you convered this into a work room. It's
 overflowing with your workpapers, almost completely covering the
 telephone.

>examine papers
 The unorganized heap covers most of the table, some of it even
 extending over the edge, threatening to fall at any moment. You've had
 such a backlog of things to do that it's become harder and harder just
 to keep up and not fall even further behind.

>examine desk
 You shoved it in here when you convered this into a work room. It's
 overflowing with your workpapers, almost completely covering the
 telephone.

>get book
 Taken.

>read book
 Flipping through the address book you see that you've only had time to
 write in two well-used numbers:  Mike Stevens at work and Dr. Hughes at
 Mercy Hospital, the doctor who's handling your mother's care. The only
 information of any importance in the appointment section appears to be
 a notice reading: "Thompson account MUST BE CLOSED BY THIS MONDAY."
 It's written in red ink and underlined five times.

>consult papers about thompson
 You begin searching through the work papers for information about the
 Thompson account, but since you don't even know what the account deals
 with, you don't know where to begin.

>call mike
 The phone rings for a moment, then Mike's secretary answers.

 "Hello, Foley Consultants, can I help you?"

 "Can I speak with Mr. Stevens please?"

 "Sure Tim, hold on a second."  You hear the click of the line being
 switched over, then Mike picks up.

 "Yeah Tim?  What can I do for you?"

>ask mike about thompson
 Mike sounds shocked.

 "The THOMPSON account?  You mean the charity bit?"

 You have no idea what he's talking about and tell him so.

 "The charity bit!  Come on, you couldn't have FORGOTTEN that?  It was
 your freakin' idea!  The whole problem with the firm's bad press last
 year about the orphanage foreclosure?  So we were going to do a few
 cases for charity ... people who couldn't normally afford us..."

 "...and I offered to take the Thompson account."

 "'xactly, Tim, where's your head BEEN, man?"

 "Oh my God, I totally forgot about it."

 You hear Mike sigh and then a shuffle of papers.

 "Hmm ... let's see. Standard blahblahblahblah, it doesn't look more
 than a two or three day thing. No real need to wo..."  He cuts off.
 "MONDAY Tim?  It's due MONDAY?!  Are you crazy?  Have you even STARTED
 it?!"

 "I've ... I've had a lot on my mind, Mike."

 "Damn, Tim, we all know that, but ... if you couldn't handle it you
 should have said so!  You're the only one who knows anything about the
 account, and you've got all the important papers there!"

 "But, Mike, I've got ... I've got stuff I have to do here."

 "Yeah, like the Thompson account!  Look Tim, I'm not going to tell you
 what to do, and I know that your job's not in the balance here; you've
 been doing too good a job for too long for one little screw up to ruin
 you, especially under these circumstances. But the Thompson's are
 totally depending on the firm here. Don't you realize the reason we
 took the case?  They'll lose everything unless YOU can find a loophole
 that'll at least delay the foreclosure for a while."

 "But couldn't someone ... could you...?"

 "Look Tim, I can't, I've got so much work here that I couldn't even
 look at the account if I wanted to. Not to mention the fact that all
 the important stuff is THERE. No Tim, it's going to be you or no one."
 He pauses. "Look, I've got to go. Call again if you need help with
 something, but the ball's in your court now."  He hangs up.

 You hang up the phone.

>consult papers about thompson
 You spread the papers out and try to get them organized. You vaguely
 remember that the Thompson account deals with a small family business
 that might be going under. Apparently they don't have enough money to
 hire someone to handle the backlog of taxes that they've been
 accumulating and can't handle it themselves. The papers are broken up
 into several sections: the back records, this year's intake, and the
 forms which need to be filled out.

>examine records
 The records go back quite a few years. You start reading through them,
 trying to get an impression of what needs to be done. The Thompson's
 have obviously been trying to keep on top of the paperwork, but they
 just didn't have the expertise. Although there's a lot, you realize
 that Mike was right, it's a routine job.

 Several hours later and almost finished with the back-paperwork, you
 realize that an entire year is missing from the records. You can't
 finish the forms without it!

>call mike
 The phone rings for a moment, then Mike's secretary answers.

 "Hello, Foley Consultants, can I help you?"

 "Can I speak with Mr. Stevens please?"

 "Sure Tim, hold on a second."  You hear the click of the line being
 switched over, then Mike picks up.

 "Yeah, Tim?" Mike says, "What do ya need?"

>ask mike about year
 You explain about the missing records from the papers you have for the
 Thompson account.

 "Hmm ... ok, hold on, let me see if they're up here."  You hear Mike
 put down the phone and then a few minutes of silence. Suddenly, he's
 back on the line. "Yeah Tim, got 'em right here. I don't know how they
 got muffed up like that. Here, let me give you the numbers."  He
 proceeds to help you update the records you need.

 "Thanks Mike, you're a lifesaver."

 "No prob, and good luck on the account!"

 You hang up the phone.

>examine forms
 You start flipping through the forms when you realize that while you
 have the back records done, you haven't completed the intake for the
 current year.

>examine intake
 You begin scanning on the records for the current year, on which the
 Thompsons have done no work at all. You sigh deeply and get to work.

 It seems to take forever, the numbers just don't want to work out.
 Finally, after scanning your work for errors a third time, you decide
 you've got it done as well as you'll ever get it.

>examine intake
 But you've already completed the Thompson's records for this year's
 intake.

>examine forms
 With the completed records in hand, you begin filling out the forms. By
 this point, you're so sick of numbers you find it harder and harder not
 to give up. As you press on, you become worried. You've got to stay
 awake, aware, because any mistakes at this point could be disastrous...

 Four hours later, you're finished. Your hands are cramped from all the
 writing, your mind spinning from the columns of data, but it's done.
 You separate the forms from the rest of papers with a sigh of relief.

 Suddenly you stop short. You forgot about the signatures!  You
 frantically begin scanning the bottom of the forms, praying you won't
 find that they have to be signed with a witness...

 ...and you find that they do. What the hell are you going to do?  It's
 Sunday!  How on Earth are you going to get in touch with a notary
 public this late on a Sunday afternoon?

>call mike
 The phone rings for a moment, then Mike's secretary answers.

 "Hello, Foley Consultants, can I help you?"

 "Can I speak with Mr. Stevens please?"

 "Sure Tim, hold on a second."  You hear the click of the line being
 switched over, then Mike picks up.

 "Yeah, Tim?" Mike says, "What do ya need?"

>ask mike about witness
 You frantically tell Mike about the signatures you need and that you
 have no idea how to get in touch with the notary public.

 "God-damnit Tim ... I'd totally forgotten. And it's Sunday, shit..."

 "What'r we gonna do, Mike?"

 Silence.

 "No, wait a minute!  I got it!  Look, I've got a friend down a City
 Hall, owes me a couple of favors. I bet I can get the public down in
 his office long enough to get the stuff signed. Listen, I'll call up
 the Thompsons, and my friend. I'll tell 'em to meet you down there in
 one hour. You got that?  Anything over that and we're screwed."

 "Got it, Mike. Oh, and thanks again. You really saved me."

 "No prob, just remember you owe me one."

 "Sure," you say, "I'll see them down there in an hour."

 You hang up the phone.

 As suddenly as you place the receiver back in the cradle, the phone
 rings. You hastily lift the receiver to your ear.

 "Hello?"

 "Yes, hello, may I please speak to Mr. Timothy Hunter?"

 "This is he."

 "Mr. Hunter?  I'm Doctor Feiner, an associate of Doctor Hughes?"

 "Yes, Doctor Feiner, what can I do for you?"

 "Well, Mr. Hunter, it's ... it's about your mother."  A sick certainty
 overcomes you.

 "She's dying," you whisper.

 "Yes, Mr. Hunter, and I'm afraid she won't be lasting much longer. Not
 more than an hour..."

 "Oh God... I'll, I'll..."

 "Whatever you do, Mr. Hunter, please do it quickly. There's not much
 time."

 With trembling hands, you put the phone back down.

>go north

 Den

 Off to one side lies the old fireplace, its soot rolling out onto the
 dirty carpet.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

>go west

 Bedroom
 The bedroom isn't much cleaner than the den, with piles of clothes
 covering most of the floor. You wish you had the time to even try to
 make the place look like a human being lives here, but you just never
 seem to. To the east is the den and a small bathroom lies to the south.

 The bed is unmade, as usual.

>examine bed
 It's hard to believe this will be the bed on which Sarah will spend all
 that time, dying. WAS the bed where she SPENT all that time ... this is
 so confusing. It's in a shambles, the sheets hidden under one of the
 numerous piles of clothing scattered about the room.

 On the bed you see your wallet.

>get wallet
 Taken.

>open wallet. x card
 You peek inside your wallet and see some money and a small, white
 business card.

 It's a business card from a local taxi agency complete with their
 telephone number.

>go east

 Off to one side lies the old fireplace, its soot rolling out onto the

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the

 Your work papers lie in disarray beside the telephone.

>call taxi
 The phone rings several times, and then the line picks up.

 "Hello, BK Taxi, can I help you?"

 You quickly explain that you need a taxi sent around to your house as
 soon as possible.

 "Certainly sir, it'll be there as soon as possible."

 You hang up the phone.

>go north

 Den

 Off to one side lies the old fireplace, its soot rolling out onto the
 dirty carpet.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

>go north

 Driveway
 It's a beautiful spring day, the sun is shining and a soft breeze
 blows. Taking in the idyllic scene, it's easy to forget all the
 pressures on you; to forget, if for the briefest of moments, your
 mother's illness and the work you have to do. The front door back into
 the house lies to the south.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You notice a cab slowly making its way up the street, its driver
 peering at house numbers. Apparently seeing yours, the cab quickly
 pulls into your driveway and the driver gives the horn three quick
 blasts.

>enter cab

 Inside a Taxi Cab
 You're sitting in the back seat of an old and dirty taxi cab. The seat
 springs squeak rustily beneath you, litter covers the floor and the
 windows are covered with grime.

 In the front seat, a cabbie sits waiting impatiently.

 "Where ya wanna go, mac?" he asks as you slip inside.

>examine cabbie
 A non-descript man who seems almost as old and decrepit as the car he
 drives. He drums the steering wheel in an angry rhythm, obviously
 impatient at having to wait.

>ask cabbie about city hall
 "You got it, mac" says the cabbie as he hits starts the meter and pulls
 out of the driveway.

>examine litter
 [Press SPACE to continue]








 The trip seems interminable, the cabbie babbling throughout it. Talk of
 nothing: the weather, the ball game on television last night. You
 hardly hear him. All you can think about is your mother in that vile
 smelling white room, breathing her last. You close your eyes and hope
 you'll be finished with this in time.

 The sunlight flickers over your closed eyelids, making a shadow-dance
 beneath, and you pause, lost for a moment in their flickering patterns.
 Let her be ok ... please, just let her be ok.

 The sudden stop in front of the Hall rudely breaks your reverie.
 "That'll be 15, bucks", says the cabbie, hitting the meter's flag.

 "I'm sorry," you say, handing him your last fifteen dollars, "I don't
 have enough for a tip."

 The cabbie looks at you for a moment, and then a smile breaks slowly
 across his face. He sighs. "Forget it, buddy. You look like you could
 use a break."  You profusely thank him as you open the taxi's door and
 rush up the long marble steps into the building...


 [Press SPACE to continue]








 City Hall is a veritable labyrynth of cold, marble corridors and your
 breathing echoes about you as you run, searching for the notary
 public's office. You almost miss it when the writing on the door
 catches your attention out of the corner of your eye. Practically
 knocking it down, you rush into the office.

 "... and here he is!" Mike says, seeing you. "Come on, Timmy-boy, let's
 get this show on the road!"  He quickly introduces you to Mrs.
 Thompson, a middle-aged woman with graying hair, and the notary public.
 The signatures are done in a flash, with Mrs. Thompson thanking your
 profusely the entire time, telling you how much this means to them,
 that they won't be losing the family business, about how afraid they
 were.

 You hardly hear her. All you can think about is your mother, lying
 there in that room.

 "... Mr. Hunter?  Are you all right?"  Mrs. Thompson's question snaps
 you back to reality.

 "Mike, Mike ... did you bring your car?" you ask him frantically.

 Your fear suddenly breaks through his bravado.

 "Yeah, Tim. It's out back. What's the matter?"

 "It's, it's my mom, we ... I've got to get to the hospital..."

 Mike grabs you by the shoulder and the next thing you know, you're
 running down the corridor again, heading for the back parking lot.
 Behind you, you can hear Mrs. Thompson calling.

 "Thank you again, Mr. Hunter!  I hope your mom's all right...!"

 [Press SPACE to continue]








 You remember nightmares as a child like this, where no matter how fast
 you went, you knew it was never quite fast enough...

 Mike's driving like a maniac, but some part of you already knows that
 it's too late. You've already been through this and it's too late. And
 yet...

 And yet there's some part of you that's hoping that somehow, someway,
 she'll be ok, that it won't be the same this time ... it won't ... just
 somehow.

 Mike pulls up in front of Mercy with a screech, yelling at you as you
 slam into the front doors to go ahead, he'll be up right behind you.

 You rush past the front desk, running for the elevators and slip
 between the doors just as they're closing. You frantically stab at the
 buttons, and then slump against the back wall. First, second, third,
 fourth, hurry god-damn you hurry ... please ... please ... fourth, come
 on ... come on you ... fifth!   The doors slide back and you rush down
 the corridor, almost slipping on the tiles and finally come to a
 screetching halt at the door to your mother's room.

 [Press SPACE to continue]








 "I'm sorry, Tim," says Doctor Hughes. He's standing in over your
 mother's bed ... just like in the Tapestry.

 "No!"  But it's too late. She's dead. It takes a moment for you to
 comprehend this. And then you're rushing forward, falling on your knees
 next to her, clutching her hand and crying out that you didn't mean to.
 You didn't mean to abandon her. You wanted to be here...

 But now it's too late.

>examine doctor
 [Press SPACE to continue]








 ONE WEEK LATER...

 The past few days have been a blur; the funeral arrangements, the
 reading of the will, the unending visits by family and friends,
 offering their condolences, all of it running and smearing together in
 a confused muddle...

 Funeral Parlor
 Your mother specified in her will exactly how she wanted everything:
 the open-casket viewing, whom she wanted to speak the eulogies. It's
 almost over now, the last of the remaining mourners (mostly old friends
 of your mother's you haven't seen in years) having already spoken with
 you. Some stragglers are still making their way past the coffin. As for
 you, you've been in the back of the room, shaking hands, saying thanks
 for their condolences, and feeling utterly numb. You haven't had the
 courage all afternoon to head to the north end of the parlor and see
 your mother lying there...

>go north
 A cold gust of wind arises from nowhere as you attempt to cross the
 room. The wind rises in intensity and a swirling smoke begins to rise
 from the ground. A dark writing cloud forms before you and from it a
 cloaked figure emerges. Its face lost in the swirling mists behind its
 hood, the figure speaks:

 "Hail mortal!  We know each other well, though perhaps you remember me
 not. I have been at your side for many a year, your closest friend,
 your worst enemy. Familiar lover and bitter adversary. You know me!
 You sense it deep inside where your guilt grows in the darkness like
 the twisted weed it is!" he laughs. "And now!  After all this time!  At
 last, a reckoning!  Will you face me?  Have you hubris enough to commit
 the breaking of your Moira?  Are you fool enough to face your crimes?

>examine figure
 The Wraith is a fearsome figure, indeed. Draped in a cloak of darkest
 night, its face hidden from sight, its hands lost in the folds of its
 cloak, what is not seen is far more frightening than what might be.

>ask wraith about moira
 "Answer, fool!  Hast thou courage enough to face me?"

>yes
 "Fool!  You dare deny me?!  You, mere mortal, dare to sunder the Moira
 set for you?  How can you deny what you have done?!"

 "Admit defeat, fool!  Admit the evil you have done!"

>no
 "How CAN YOU?!  You KILLED her, your MOTHER, whom you owe your life to!
 MURDERER!  What rationalization do you have this time??"

 "What excuse have you?!"

>tell wraith about thompsons
 You tell the Wraith about the Thompson account, about how badly they
 needed your help and of how they would have gone bankrupt without it.
 You tell it of Mrs. Thompson's tears, of her thanks.

 "LIES!  You care for no one but YOURSELF!  How DARE you lie as such, to
 make me believe that you would care for another so much!  You left her
 there!"

 "You abandoned her, monster, left her for dead!"

>go north
 The Wraith silently glides between you and the casket, blocking you
 from approaching it.

 "You abandoned her, monster, left her for dead!"

>no
 "BASTARD!  LIAR!  Your golden tongue shall not save you!"

 "Why were you not there for her at the last?  Where WERE you?"

>tell wraith about doctor

 "Why were you not there for her at the last?  Where WERE you?"

>tell wraith about city hall
 Crying, half-reliving it, you tell the Wraith of the trip to City Hall,
 of how you wished you could have been in two places at once, of the
 nightmare trip back, only to find out it was too late.

 There is no response...

 As suddenly as it appeared, the Wraith vanishes, and in its place
 stands Clotho of the Parcae.

 "You have chosen well, Timothy," she says. "You have learned of your
 Moira and chosen, as you should, to live within it. You have learned to
 stand by your decisions, and you have faced your fears with strength
 and courage."

 She gently takes you by the hand and leads you through the frozen crowd
 towards the casket. Once there, she steps back, waiting. You step
 forwards, fearful of what you're about to face, but take a deep breath
 and peer inside.

 She looks beautiful. Her hair falls across her face, just covering her
 eyes, and the dress she wears was always one of her favorites. "I'm
 sorry, Mom, I'm sorry..." you whisper. And suddenly, somehow, you know.
 You know that she understands, that it wasn't your fault. She knows
 that you didn't abandon her, that you were trying to help. You turn to
 Clotho, eyes bright with tears, and she nods.

 "Yes, Timothy. She always knew. And, perhaps in a way, you did as well.
 But your fear, your irrational guilt, blocked that, stopped you from
 seeing the truth. And now, now that your Moira has changed, now that
 you have faced the Wraith, you have stopped what happened before."

 Memory floods back. The funeral. How you fled, how you couldn't face
 seeing her after what had happened ... it's changed.

 Clotho nods once more. "Yes, Timothy. Well done."

 "You have taken the first step along my path, Timothy. Once chosen, it
 cannot be abandoned. You shall follow it to its conclusion, with the
 choices you shall make elsewhere. I shall be near, to guide you as you
 shall need."

 The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
 their heaving embrace. They leave you, gasping, back in the Tower...

 The Ivory Tower, where you started this strange adventure, now lies in

 trees smoldering in the darkness.

 The Tapestry seems to have survived the Tower's destruction intact.

 "Answer, fool!  Hast thou courage enough to face me?"

>no
 Without a face, the Spectre nonetheless grins. "Victory!  You are wise
 to know when you are outmatched. To know that your guilt is not without
 cause, and that to live with it is your course. Your Moira remains
 unbroken, the path you chose so long ago remains unchanged. Farewell,
 mortal, for we shall meet again..."

 As suddenly as it appeared, the Wraith vanishes, and in its place
 stands Atropos of the Parcae.

 "You have chosen well, Timothy," she says. "You have faced the
 temptation of hubris and not committed excess. You have learned of your
 Moira and chosen, as you should, to live within it. You have stood by
 your decisions and not dared to face the Spectre of your guilt."

 She turns and looks towards the waiting casket. "There are some things
 that simply cannot be faced, Timothy. Remember this."

 Atropos turns back to you. "You have taken the first step along my
 path, Timothy. Once chosen, it cannot be abandoned. You shall follow it
 to its conclusion, with the choices you shall make elsewhere. I shall
 be near, to guide you as you shall need."

 Den
 The living room of your small home has changed little since your
 bachelor days, although Sarah's being here has altered it in some small
 ways. She keeps saying how the place needs more of "a woman's touch,"
 but for all her talk, her work kept her too busy to do much, and now
 ... well, she can't do much at all. To the south lies your office, and
 to the west is the bedroom. The doorway to the north leads outside to
 the driveway.

 Off to one side, built into the wall, is a small fireplace.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

>go south

 Office
 You've had a place to do work for years, but only recently have you
 used it enough to actually call it an office. Even at that, it's not
 much of one, with your desk as the only furniture. The door to the
 north leads into the living room.

 The remainder of your work papers lie on your desk, next to the
 telephone.

 Built into your desk is a small desk drawer.

 Bedroom
 Your bedroom has been one of the few areas where Sarah's influence has
 been at work. You felt the presence of her long after she had gone, and
 a few months after her death put it back the way it had been. A door to
 the east leads back to the den and to the south is the bathroom.

 Somehow, in this strange world of the past, Sarah still lives. She's
 lying, half asleep, in bed.

 Beside the bed is a small endtable.

>smother sarah with pillow
 I only understood you as far as wanting to smother Sarah.

>smother sarah
 Clutching the pillow, you consider it. It would be so simple. She would
 die in her sleep, painless, quiet. And she'd be free of it forever.
 Your hands tremble as you think of it...

 Sarah looks up at you with wide open eyes. You turn away horrified. You
 can't do it, you just can't do it. You take a deep breath and try and
 calm yourself.

>go south

 Bathroom
 This small bathroom lies to the south of your bedroom. Ever since Sarah
 fell ill, it's been a storehouse of false hopes. Every miracle the
 doctors said might have helped, every drug that might have eased her
 pain has been kept here. And each and every one did nothing.

 Over the sink is a small, mirrored medicine cabinet.

 It's a photograph of you and Sarah out on the lake. She's got her arms
 wrapped around your neck while the two of you grin like maniacs at the
 camera from the little boat you're in. You remember when it was taken.
 Five seconds later, the boat capsized and you and she laughed so hard
 about it you nearly drowned. God, it's been at least a year since last
 you were up there.

 Sarah looks up at you and smiles.

 "Aww ... how sweet, my knight in shining armor come to take me to
 dreamland?"  You help her up and she swallows the pills with a sip of
 water. She takes hold of your hand. You see her lower lip trembling
 slightly. "Thank you Timmy," she whispers, "for everything."

 She lies back down and closes her eyes, but she still has trouble
 falling asleep. God, you wish she could sleep forever, away from the
 sickness and the pain.

>show photo to sarah
 "Oh Timmy. We had so much fun up there, didn't we?  'The Sweet
 Audrina.'"  She laughs. God, we we almost drowned, didn't we?"  You
 laugh with her for a moment, then you both fall silent. She takes your
 hand. "We had some pretty good times, didn't we?  Tell me a story,
 Timmy." she says, "tell me about the lake.

>tell sarah about lake
 You tell Sarah the story, embellishing what really happened. That
 always made her laugh, the way you used to exaggerate everything until
 it became bigger than life. She smiles, remembering.

 "Oh, we had so much fun, didn't we?"  She yawns, then pats your hand.
 "I think I've had enough excitement for one day, I'm going to take a
 nap, ok?"  You nod, and tuck her in as her breathing becomes slow and
 regular.

>smother sarah
 Clutching the pillow, you consider it. It would be so simple. She would
 die in her sleep, painless, quiet. And she'd be free of it forever.
 Your hands tremble as you think of it...

 Gently, tenderly, you stroke her cheek and kiss her forehead. Then, you
 silently place the pillow over her face and wait. Nothing happens for a
 few moments, then Sarah's breathing suddenly becomes irregular. For a
 brief moment you're seized with panic. You want to take the pillow
 away, make her breathe again.

 You bite your lip painfully and take a deep breath. Sarah's breathing
 is still irregular. She gasps once, and then her breathing slows.
 Slower and slower the breaths come, until, at last they stop
 altogether.

 You gently remove the pillow. Her eyes are closed and her face is, for
 the first time since the illness, peaceful. Your vision blurs as tears
 fill your eyes and you collapse, crying unashamedly. You go on and on,
 all the pain and sorrow of what has happened pouring out of you. After
 what seems an eternity, you recover enough to stand again.

>open drawer
 A cold gust of wind arises from nowhere and your hand is violently
 forced back from the endtable. The wind rises in intensity and a
 swirling smoke begins to rise from the ground. A dark writing cloud
 forms before you and from it a cloaked figure emerges. Its face lost in
 the swirling mists behind its hood, the figure speaks:

 The wraith laughs coldly. "So, we meet again!"

 "And, so again, you flee before me!  Know you now well enough that it
 is folly to face MY likes!  Get you gone, you have no more business
 here!"

 Again, the Wraith vanishes, and Atropos of the Parcae stands before
 you.

 "Once again, you have chosen rightly, mortal. Hubris discarded, you
 have followed you Moira, as well you should. The Spectre of your guilt
 stays appeased."

 She turns and looks at the endtable. "What is there shall remain
 unknown, as it should be."

 Atropos turns back to you. "The second step is now complete, Timothy.
 One more along my path remains, once more along the threads of your
 Moira you must travel. Go now."

 The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
 their heaving embrace. They leave you, gasping, back in the Tower...

 You turn the corner with a sigh, glancing at the street sign in a
 feeble, half-hearted attempt to figure out where you are. You've left
 the old familiar neighborhood far behind you tonight, as you have
 almost every night. Each outing seems to take you a little further, to
 an area a little stranger and more dangerous.

 Tonight, you didn't even bother giving yourself an excuse. Before, it
 had been that you had somewhere to go, something to do. Not tonight.
 Some indeterminate time ago, you stumbled out of the house, stuck the
 key in the ignition, and just started driving.

 The sharp honk of a nearby car breaks your musings. You glance upward
 to see a pair of girls, jump ropes under their arms, pigtails flying
 behind them, run across the street, right in front of your car...

 Time slows as you slam down on your brakes. For a moment, you don't
 think you'll make it, but with a squeal of the tires, your old Dodge
 manages to grind to a halt in time. The girls make it across, laughing
 all the while, unaware of how close death has come.

 Your Car
 The old hunk of junk has served you pretty well in the past few years.
 You could probably afford something better, but why bother?  It runs,
 it gets you to work and back. What more could you want?  What more do
 you need?

 The buildings outside seem mostly tenements, their residents escaping
 the sweltering evening by sitting outside on the stone porches, the
 sidewalks. The girls continue on their way, and soon enter a tenement.

 With a sigh a relief, you step on the gas and continue on your way.

>honk
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>push accelerator
 You can't see any such thing.

>push gas
 You attempt to step on the gas when you find your feet won't move. At
 least, they won't move to push down on the gas pedal. What's going on
 here?  They told you you had a choice; that you had some control over
 what was happening!

 The further you go, the more convinced you're only getting yourself
 more lost. If anything, the neighborhoods are getting worse. The
 homeless are more and visible, and the buildings are more decrepit.

>wait
 Time passes.

 As your mind begins to wander, your attention to the road slips. It's
 been so long since you've been able to just stop; to put all that's
 happened and all you've done behind. The scars that are left won't fade
 that easily.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You withdraw even further into yourself and soon lose all track of time
 and place. Wandering the ruin of your life and the wreckage of your
 past, you find yourself lost in more than one way.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Now..."

 A whisper calls you back, breaking your reverie. Your eyes focus again,
 seeing through the window.

 "No..."

 It's all you can get out before the flash. Yet in that instant you see
 the scene with perfect clarity: the curb, far too close, the front
 wheels about to strike it. And there, a little further: the young woman
 falling. She's still looking downward, still unaware of her impending
 death.

 And then the flash, and time slows. The few seconds left before your
 death stretch, lengthen, and twist about on themselves. It seems you
 have a moment of reprieve ... but a single moment only.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The car inches closer to the curb, striking it. You see the car dip,
 sparks flashing out onto the pavement, yet you feel nothing. You are
 detached, separated somehow. And still the girl sees nothing.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You rebound, sending the car into the air. Closer now, you see her
 slowly lifting her head, about to realize the flying mass of metal that
 will end her life. Beyond, on the curb, you can make out the figure you
 saw in the tableau, eyes ablaze and mouth agape, attempting to scramble
 to its feet.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The car strikes the pavement with a resounding force, the tires
 squealing as they touch ground. Your headlights strike the girl full in
 the face, illuminating her in a blinding halo.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The car continues its lurch forward, carried by its momentum. Both your
 ends are a heartbeat away.

>wait
 Time passes.

 It's too late. Tumbling out of control, the last thing you see is the
 car's headlights inches in front of the young woman's face...

>wait
 [Press SPACE to continue...]








 Fleeting glimpses of faces half-remembered in the gloom. Screams, the
 sound of squealing tires, a sudden thump, a sickening crunch and a
 violent jolt, followed by a sense of weightlessness and disassociation.
 The last thing you remember is an overwhelming feeling of guilt and
 regret, forcing its way through the chaos that surrounds you and then
 there is...

 Fearscape
 A dark cliff overlooking an even darker landscape. Above, a full,
 sullen moon hangs, half-hidden by a mass of dark clouds; below, jagged
 rocks cover the bank of a black river which flows from a fount in the
 hillside. You know this place instinctively, the image of it frozen in
 some primal memory, hidden from view. You realize you've been here
 before ... in your nightmares.

>examine river
 It's too hard to make out the river from here...

>examine moon
 The moonlight is the only source of illumination here, not a star hangs
 in the sky.

>examine cliff
 As you peer down the cliff-side, your heart begins to beat wildly.
 You've always had a fear of heights, and you've had this nightmare many
 times. You know there's no way to leave short of jumping ... yet you're
 terrified to.

>climb down
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>jump
 Taking a deep breath and, closing your eyes, you attempt to overcome
 your panic. Slowly, you step to where you know the cliff edge lies.
 Standing straight, arms akimbo, you steady yourself and then hurl your
 body forward with all your might.

 For the briefest of moments, you feel like you're floating, flying, but
 then gravity asserts itself and you're tumbling out of control. You
 force your eyes open against the driving wind and see the dark
 landscape come rushing forward, the stones of the lake shore ready to
 catch you and break your bones.

 You scream incoherently as you're about to hit...

 ...when a sudden upward rush of air slows your fall and gently leaves
 you on the bank of the dark river.

 Cliff Bottom
 The moon is brighter here, lighting the scene with an eerie, surreal
 glow. From a fount in the hillside, a river of black, brackish liquid
 flows, forming the source of a river which flows out into the distance.

>examine river
 The black, oily liquid flows sluggishly downward from the fount in the
 cliff-side, spilling onto the ground and out into the distance.

>drink river
 As your thrust your hands under the fount and the waters flow over
 them, you are struck by how frigid it is. Then, in horror, you watch as
 the waters begin reaching outwards, climbing over your arms and making
 their way towards your face.

 You scream, attempting to wrest your way free, and as the foul material
 continues its progress, you realize that the invasion is mental as well
 as physical. You can feel the waters reaching deep into your mind,
 freeing the dark counterparts they find there: fear, guilt, hate and
 self-loathing.

 With a cry, you wrench yourself backwards, falling upon the soft river
 bank. But the waters do not give up so easily, and the psychic pull
 continues for a moment afterwards before releasing you. Left numb and
 empty, you resolve never to touch the foul stuff again.

>wake up
 The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

>touch moon
 Your hand tingles strangely as you pass it in front of your view of the
 moon...

>get moon
 Feeling foolish, you raise your hands, trying to catch the moon between
 them. You remember how, as a child, you used to think that if you stood
 tall enough, you could catch it like a ball and hold it in your arms.
 You strain further and further, reaching upwards ... and then you catch
 hold. Gently, unbelieving, you pull the orb down from the now-darkened
 skies.

>examine moon
 The silvery orb glows brightly in your hands, a small but perfect
 replica of the moon.

>moon moon
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put moon in river
 As you approach the river with the sphere, you notice it shining even
 more brightly, even as the river begins to bubble and swirl. Gently,
 carefully, you toss the moon onto the river's surface. It floats
 serenely for a moment, then begins to sink into the mire. The waters
 roil and twist about it, trying to pull it downwards, and for a moment
 they appear to be succeeding. But then a shining beam of light flies
 upwards, fighting against the current and eddies and the orb makes its
 way to the surface again.

 As darkness and light continue their struggle, you notice streams of
 ichor flying upwards from the river, swirling over the surface. A
 hideous keening noise fills the air as these ghost shapes surround you,
 flowing upwards and out, screaming into the night. Before you, between
 you and the banks of the now violent flow, a swirling mass of darkness
 forms itself into a cloaked figure. Standing forth, it speaks:

 The wraith laughs coldly. "So, we meet again!"

 "Three times have me met, mortal, and three times have you fled!  Know
 you the master of your Moira, know you the Spectre of your guilt!"  The
 creature throws back its hidden head and laughs, the sound chilling
 your blood. Still laughing, it vanishes, and a Atropos of the Parcae
 stands before you.

 "The circle is now complete, Timothy. You have acted rightly, and the
 end of your journey along my Path draws near. Your Moira remains whole
 and intact, and your destiny within its boundaries firmly set. The
 crisis is past, disaster no longer looms near."

 She turns and looks towards the churning waters. As she does so, the
 orb's light fades, and the black waters rise. Sinking from sight, the
 now-dead moon vanishes, and the waters are quiet, still and dark.

 "Some places should stay hidden in darkness, Timothy," she whispers.
 "Illumination is not always a good thing."

 Atropos turns back to you. "The final step has been taken, Timothy. The
 Tapestry is finished, your Moira secure. The time has come to leave
 this place of indecision, mortal, and face whatever destiny lies before
 you. I wish you well."

 The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
 their heaving embrace...

 Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are

 Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died.

 This was only natural, being mortal. The life he led was probably most
 unusual in its normalcy; his childhood so much so as to be mundane.
 Neither praised nor reviled, neither a leader nor an outcast, he was
 simply another face in the crowd. He went to school, he studied, he did
 well enough to get by. After graduation he found a job he was good at
 and paid well enough. He bought a little house and lived there, a
 bother to no one, and the days just flowed one into the other...

 In fact, the first event of any importance in his life was the death of
 his mother.

 She had been ill for quite a while, and during this time, Timothy was
 under a great deal of stress. His small, comfortable world fell apart
 around him as he realized that something had ended; an innocent part of
 his life where he had thought she would always be with him was over.

 The Thompson account had totally slipped his mind, and he had been
 frantically trying to finish it when he heard the news that she was
 dying. An hour they gave her at the most. Faced with the agonizing
 choice of being with her in her final moments on this earth, or helping
 the Thompson from losing everything they had, he chose to go to City
 Hall to get the papers that were necessary signed.

 His frantic attempt to arrive at the Hospital afterwards was too late,
 and he never forgave himself for that. Ever afterward, he imagined his
 mother slowly dying in that horrible white room, the worst part of her
 death knowing that her son had abandoned her.

 The funeral was too much for Timothy. Faced with the tremendous guilt
 at betraying his mother, he fled the service, forever missing the
 chance to see his mother's face one last time.

 The time after his mother's death was a lonely one for Timothy, perhaps
 because, for the first time, he realized he was truly alone. Then, he
 met Sarah, and everything changed. She was so loving, so full of life,
 so willing to drag him from the small, empty world he had built for
 himself. They complemented each other so well: her spontaneity to his
 structure, her boundless energy to his complacency. Their whirlwind
 romance caught him totally unawares, and when she accepted his proposal
 of marriage, he thought himself the happiest man on earth.

 Truly, their first five years together were the happiest time of his
 life. The experience of having his life so intricately tied to another
 was exhiliarating; he built his entire existence around her.

 Which is why her falling ill struck him so hard.

 It was agonizing for Timothy to see her wasting away. "Apentrylic
 Syndrome" they called it, a metabolic disorder carried in a recessive
 gene. There wasn't a cure, they told him, and they didn't think she'd
 last more than a year.

 They were wrong. For five years, Timothy watched his wife slowly
 rotting away from the inside. Her energy faded, her strength tapped
 away. The woman who had filled his life with motion and vitality now
 could barely lift her head to take the countless pills the doctors
 prescribed. But she never complained, she never once told him how much
 pain she was in, how tired she was. But Timothy knew just the same.

 After five years, it seemed as though it would never end. Not wishing
 to see her suffer further, not understanding why she had to continue
 such an agonized existence, he tried his best to help her. Putting her
 to sleep, he smothered her, praying that her death had been peaceful
 and painless. There was never any investigation of her death, the
 report said she died in her sleep.

 Ironically, on the day Sarah died, her doctor announced that a new
 treatment program was to be instituted that would test an experimental
 drug touted as the cure for Apentrylic Syndrome. Timothy, still
 suffering from the guilt he felt for killing Sarah, was overwhelmed. It
 didn't matter that the doctor told him she wouldn't have been let into
 the program anyway, he knew he should have found a way to do it. The
 guilt of what he had done never left him, and ate away at him with an
 intensity mirroring the Syndrome from which his wife suffered for so
 long.

 The time after Sarah's death was much like it had been before his
 mother's; his life mundane, his existence centered around his work. But
 Timothy's experiences and the guilt he felt for his actions irrevocably
 changed him. He was no longer the same man. Haunted and ill at ease, he
 slept less and less, and found himself driving the streets at night in
 attempt to escape something not even he could put a name to.

 The night he died he had been driving for hours in a trance-like state,
 hardly aware of the world around him. When the young girl came flailing
 into the middle of the street, it was too late. Timothy had already
 been dead years before.

 It turned out that the young woman had been arguing with her boyfriend,
 and in a struggle, had half been was pushed, half pushed herself into
 the road. If Timothy had survived the accident, that knowledge would
 have meant nothing to him. He probably would have blamed himself
 anyway...

 Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died. To say anything more would
 be futile speculation.

 Den
 The living room of your small home has changed little since your
 bachelor days, although Sarah's being here has altered it in some small
 ways. She keeps saying how the place needs more of "a woman's touch,"
 but for all her talk, her work kept her too busy to do much, and now
 ... well, she can't do much at all. To the south lies your office, and
 to the west is the bedroom. The doorway to the north leads outside to
 the driveway.

 Off to one side, built into the wall, is a small fireplace.

 A strange new addition to the room is the small tapestry hanging on the
 eastern wall.

 Bedroom
 Your bedroom has been one of the few areas where Sarah's influence has
 been at work. You felt the presence of her long after she had gone, and
 a few months after her death put it back the way it had been. A door to
 the east leads back to the den and to the south is the bathroom.

 Somehow, in this strange world of the past, Sarah still lives. She's
 lying, half asleep, in bed.

 Beside the bed is a small endtable.

 Driveway
 The driveway you stand in is somewhat useless, as neither you nor Sarah
 own a car. Still, it's nice to get out of the house for a moment. The
 gloom that seems to have settled over the house since Sarah's falling
 ill is lessened slightly here. You can almost fool yourself into
 thinking she's well again. The entrance to the house lies to the south.

 You can see today's newspaper here.

 Nothing new ... a riot at the downtown picket lines yesterday, national
 tension over the budget settlements, yet another war breaking out
 somewhere abroad... You've lost track of the world outside for a long
 time now. The whole thing seems like some far-away dream.

 You're about to fold the paper back up when a familiar name catches
 your eye...

 MERCY HOSPITAL TO BEGIN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PROGRAM

 Yesterday in a press conference, Dr. Robert Albero announced that Mercy
 Hospital has been chosen to head a newly implemented experimental
 program for the possible treatment of Apentrylic Syndrome. The
 program's main component is phenylhydroxythiol (Phenotol), a drug newly
 developed at Ciba-Gigey Laboratories with government funding. Dr.
 Albero will head the experiment that will give pre-selected groups the
 treatment over a period of six weeks to gauge its effectiveness on
 human subjects.

 The drug has been shown to successfully combat the disease in
 laboratory animals, and, if the current experiments are successful, Dr.
 Albero hopes to see FDA approval for distribution by as early as next
 year. Subjects for the experiment have been chosen with specific
 criteria used to test the treatment's effectiveness on humans of
 varying characteristics such as sex and age. Several groups will be
 tested, with certain groups given placebos as a control.

 However, not all of Dr. Albero's associates are as optimistic about the
 results. "There's absolutely no reason to assume the treatment will be
 as effective on humans as it has been on laboratory animals," said one
 who asked to remain anonymous. "He's putting it totally out of
 proportion to say that it'll be approved by next year. I'd be surprised
 if it's available within the next five. There still remains an
 extensive amount of research to be done."

 This small bathroom lies to the south of your bedroom. Ever since Sarah
 fell ill, it's been a storehouse of false hopes. Every miracle the
 doctors said might have helped, every drug that might have eased her
 pain has been kept here. And each and every one did nothing.

 Over the sink is a small, mirrored medicine cabinet.

 You open the medicine cabinet, revealing a small bottle of pills.

 You're about to tell Sarah about the experiment, but then think better
 of it. What's the point of depressing her?  She'll never get in it.

>give pills to sarah
 Sarah looks up at you and smiles.

 "Aww ... how sweet, my knight in shining armor come to take me to
 dreamland?"  You help her up and she swallows the pills with a sip of
 water. She takes hold of your hand. You see her lower lip trembling
 slightly. "Thank you Timmy," she whispers, "for everything."

 She lies back down and closes her eyes, but she still has trouble
 falling asleep. God, you wish she could sleep forever, away from the
 sickness and the pain.

>show photo to sarah
 "Oh Timmy. We had so much fun up there, didn't we?  'The Sweet
 Audrina.'"  She laughs. God, we we almost drowned, didn't we?"  You
 laugh with her for a moment, then you both fall silent. She takes your
 hand. "We had some pretty good times, didn't we?  Tell me a story,
 Timmy." she says, "tell me about the lake.

>tell sarah about lake
 You tell Sarah the story, embellishing what really happened. That
 always made her laugh, the way you used to exaggerate everything until
 it became bigger than life. She smiles, remembering.

 "Oh, we had so much fun, didn't we?"  She yawns, then pats your hand.
 "I think I've had enough excitement for one day, I'm going to take a
 nap, ok?"  You nod, and tuck her in as her breathing becomes slow and
 regular.

>open drawer
 Worry about the drawer later. You have more important things to do now.

>get pillow
 Taken.

>smother sarah
 Clutching the pillow, you consider it. It would be so simple. She would
 die in her sleep, painless, quiet. And she'd be free of it forever.
 Your hands tremble as you think of it...

 Gently, tenderly, you stroke her cheek and kiss her forehead. Then, you
 silently place the pillow over her face and wait. Nothing happens for a
 few moments, then Sarah's breathing suddenly becomes irregular. For a
 brief moment you're seized with panic. You want to take the pillow
 away, make her breathe again.

 You bite your lip painfully and take a deep breath. Sarah's breathing
 is still irregular. She gasps once, and then her breathing slows.
 Slower and slower the breaths come, until, at last they stop
 altogether.

 You gently remove the pillow. Her eyes are closed and her face is, for
 the first time since the illness, peaceful. Your vision blurs as tears
 fill your eyes and you collapse, crying unashamedly. You go on and on,
 all the pain and sorrow of what has happened pouring out of you. After
 what seems an eternity, you recover enough to stand again.

>open drawer
 A cold gust of wind arises from nowhere and your hand is violently
 forced back from the endtable. The wind rises in intensity and a
 swirling smoke begins to rise from the ground. A dark writing cloud
 forms before you and from it a cloaked figure emerges. Its face lost in
 the swirling mists behind its hood, the figure speaks:

 The wraith laughs coldly. "So, we meet again!"

 "And again, you dare to defy me?  I shall destroy you, fool!"

 "Admit defeat, Timothy!  Admit that you never loved her!"

>no

 "Liar!  Admit that she never loved you!"

>no
 "You dare to still say this be love after her murder?!  How can you?
 Tell me of her, this one you murdered!"

 "Tell me of Sarah!"

>tell wraith about lake

 "Tell me of Sarah!"

>tell wraith about sarah
 Mortally afraid and shaking, you nonetheless face the Wraith. You tell
 it of Sarah's sickness, of her suffering. You explain that you wished
 to free her from all of it, that she herself found living impossible.
 You tell the Spectre that your act was one of love.

 "You LIE!  You cannot prove you were even ONCE happy together!"

>tell wraith about lake
 "Proof, fool!  Your words are not enough!"

 "You LIE!  You cannot prove you were even ONCE happy together!"

>show photo to wraith
 The Wraith listens, a silent judge, as you tell him of your marriage.
 Of the happy times you had together, of the story of the lake, and how
 happy Sarah was then, and how happy she was when you shared it with her
 now.

 There is no response...

 As suddenly as it appeared, the Wraith vanishes,and in its place stands
 Clotho of the Parcae.

 "Well done, Timothy!  Once again, you have faced your fears and been
 victorious!"

 Clotho turns from you and approaches the endtable. Silently, she opens
 the drawer within it, rather anticlimactically revealing a small,
 folded note. She retrieves it and hands it to you. You see that it
 bears your name written on the front in Sarah's hand.

 It reads:

 My Dearest Timothy,

      If you are reading this then either I have taken my own life, or
 you have helped me to. In either case, there are things I wish you to
 understand. Please do not think me selfish, my love, to do this. The
 pain we have both suffered is needless and my choice was to relieve us
 both of it. [9]If you have helped me to do this, then I know you have
 done so out of love. Do not let guilt get in the way of your knowing
 this, for I go to a better place, where I know someday you will join
 me. I will always love you, dearest, as I know you love me.

 Yours always,
 Sarah

 You stand there, silent for a moment. You don't remember ever reading
 this note. Maybe your facing the Wraith changed something.

 Clotho nods, as if reading your thoughts. "Yes, Timothy. While you have
 followed your choices for the most part, your Moira has, in fact, been
 changed. Your confrontation with your guilt has allowed you to see the
 truth. To see that Sarah was in pain and she wanted you to do this."

 "And so, you have taken the second path along your altered Moira. The
 threads of your Destiny are changing Timothy ... do not falter now. Be
 brave, for the final step you do not take alone."

 The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
 their heaving embrace. They leave you, gasping, back in the Tower...

 Ruined Tower
 The Ivory Tower, where you started this strange adventure, now lies in

 trees smoldering in the darkness.

 You turn the corner with a sigh, glancing at the street sign in a
 feeble, half-hearted attempt to figure out where you are. You've left
 the old familiar neighborhood far behind you tonight, as you have
 almost every night. Each outing seems to take you a little further, to
 an area a little stranger and more dangerous.

 Tonight, you didn't even bother giving yourself an excuse. Before, it
 had been that you had somewhere to go, something to do. Not tonight.
 Some indeterminate time ago, you stumbled out of the house, stuck the
 key in the ignition, and just started driving.

 The sharp honk of a nearby car breaks your musings. You glance upward
 to see a pair of girls, jump ropes under their arms, pigtails flying
 behind them, run across the street, right in front of your car...

 Time slows as you slam down on your brakes. For a moment, you don't
 think you'll make it, but with a squeal of the tires, your old Dodge
 manages to grind to a halt in time. The girls make it across, laughing
 all the while, unaware of how close death has come.

 Your Car
 The old hunk of junk has served you pretty well in the past few years.
 You could probably afford something better, but why bother?  It runs,
 it gets you to work and back. What more could you want?  What more do
 you need?

 The buildings outside seem mostly tenements, their residents escaping
 the sweltering evening by sitting outside on the stone porches, the
 sidewalks. The girls continue on their way, and soon enter a tenement.

 With a sigh a relief, you step on the gas and continue on your way.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The further you go, the more convinced you're only getting yourself
 more lost. If anything, the neighborhoods are getting worse. The
 homeless are more and visible, and the buildings are more decrepit.

>wait
 Time passes.

 As your mind begins to wander, your attention to the road slips. It's
 been so long since you've been able to just stop; to put all that's
 happened and all you've done behind. The scars that are left won't fade
 that easily.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You withdraw even further into yourself and soon lose all track of time
 and place. Wandering the ruin of your life and the wreckage of your
 past, you find yourself lost in more than one way.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Now..."

 A whisper calls you back, breaking your reverie. Your eyes focus again,
 seeing through the window.

 "No..."

 It's all you can get out before the flash. Yet in that instant you see
 the scene with perfect clarity: the curb, far too close, the front
 wheels about to strike it. And there, a little further: the young woman
 falling. She's still looking downward, still unaware of her impending
 death.

 And then the flash, and time slows. The few seconds left before your
 death stretch, lengthen, and twist about on themselves. It seems you
 have a moment of reprieve ... but a single moment only.

>pull parking brake
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull emergency brake
 You can't see any such thing.

>turn on radio
 You can't see any such thing.

>honk
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>push brake
 It's too late now. Stepping on the brakes would only prolong the
 inevitable, and possibly only succeed in flipping the car completely
 over.

 The car inches closer to the curb, striking it. You see the car dip,
 sparks flashing out onto the pavement, yet you feel nothing. You are
 detached, separated somehow. And still the girl sees nothing.

>yell
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>push horn
 You can't see any such thing.

>turn wheel
 Morningstar's laughter echoes about you.

 "I am afraid not, my friend. You were foolish enough not to take my
 offer and that is one choice you must live with."

 You rebound, sending the car into the air. Closer now, you see her
 slowly lifting her head, about to realize the flying mass of metal that
 will end her life. Beyond, on the curb, you can make out the figure you
 saw in the tableau, eyes ablaze and mouth agape, attempting to scramble
 to its feet.

>push gas
 Stepping on the gas now would accomplish nothing more than hitting that
 poor girl even harder.

 The car strikes the pavement with a resounding force, the tires
 squealing as they touch ground. Your headlights strike the girl full in
 the face, illuminating her in a blinding halo.

>push brake
 It's too late now. Stepping on the brakes would only prolong the
 inevitable, and possibly only succeed in flipping the car completely
 over.

 The car continues its lurch forward, carried by its momentum. Both your
 ends are a heartbeat away.

>push gas
 Stepping on the gas now would accomplish nothing more than hitting that
 poor girl even harder.

 It's too late. Tumbling out of control, the last thing you see is the
 car's headlights inches in front of the young woman's face...

 [Press SPACE to continue...]








 Fleeting glimpses of faces half-remembered in the gloom. Screams, the
 sound of squealing tires, a sudden thump, a sickening crunch and a
 violent jolt, followed by a sense of weightlessness and disassociation.
 The last thing you remember is an overwhelming feeling of guilt and
 regret, forcing its way through the chaos that surrounds you and then
 there is...

 Fearscape
 A dark cliff overlooking an even darker landscape. Above, a full,
 sullen moon hangs, half-hidden by a mass of dark clouds; below, jagged
 rocks cover the bank of a black river which flows from a fount in the
 hillside. You know this place instinctively, the image of it frozen in
 some primal memory, hidden from view. You realize you've been here
 before ... in your nightmares.

>examine moon
 The moonlight is the only source of illumination here, not a star hangs
 in the sky.

>examine clouds
 The moonlight is the only source of illumination here, not a star hangs
 in the sky.

>examine rocks
 You can't see any such thing.

>wake up
 The dreadful truth is, this is not a dream.

>jump
 Taking a deep breath and, closing your eyes, you attempt to overcome
 your panic. Slowly, you step to where you know the cliff edge lies.
 Standing straight, arms akimbo, you steady yourself and then hurl your
 body forward with all your might.

 For the briefest of moments, you feel like you're floating, flying, but
 then gravity asserts itself and you're tumbling out of control. You
 force your eyes open against the driving wind and see the dark
 landscape come rushing forward, the stones of the lake shore ready to
 catch you and break your bones.

 You scream incoherently as you're about to hit...

 ...when a sudden upward rush of air slows your fall and gently leaves
 you on the bank of the dark river.

 Cliff Bottom
 The moon is brighter here, lighting the scene with an eerie, surreal
 glow. From a fount in the hillside, a river of black, brackish liquid
 flows, forming the source of a river which flows out into the distance.

>examine river
 The black, oily liquid flows sluggishly downward from the fount in the
 cliff-side, spilling onto the ground and out into the distance.

>touch it
 As your thrust your hands under the fount and the waters flow over
 them, you are struck by how frigid it is. Then, in horror, you watch as
 the waters begin reaching outwards, climbing over your arms and making
 their way towards your face.

 You scream, attempting to wrest your way free, and as the foul material
 continues its progress, you realize that the invasion is mental as well
 as physical. You can feel the waters reaching deep into your mind,
 freeing the dark counterparts they find there: fear, guilt, hate and
 self-loathing.

 With a cry, you wrench yourself backwards, falling upon the soft river
 bank. But the waters do not give up so easily, and the psychic pull
 continues for a moment afterwards before releasing you. Left numb and
 empty, you resolve never to touch the foul stuff again.

>examine moon
 The moon seems closer here than it did on the cliff top. Somehow, you
 feel as if you could just reach out and touch it...

>take it
 Feeling foolish, you raise your hands, trying to catch the moon between
 them. You remember how, as a child, you used to think that if you stood
 tall enough, you could catch it like a ball and hold it in your arms.
 You strain further and further, reaching upwards ... and then you catch
 hold. Gently, unbelieving, you pull the orb down from the now-darkened
 skies.

>examine it
 The silvery orb glows brightly in your hands, a small but perfect
 replica of the moon.

>rub it
 You achieve nothing by this.

>put moon in river
 As you approach the river with the sphere, you notice it shining even
 more brightly, even as the river begins to bubble and swirl. Gently,
 carefully, you toss the moon onto the river's surface. It floats
 serenely for a moment, then begins to sink into the mire. The waters
 roil and twist about it, trying to pull it downwards, and for a moment
 they appear to be succeeding. But then a shining beam of light flies
 upwards, fighting against the current and eddies and the orb makes its
 way to the surface again.

 As darkness and light continue their struggle, you notice streams of
 ichor flying upwards from the river, swirling over the surface. A
 hideous keening noise fills the air as these ghost shapes surround you,
 flowing upwards and out, screaming into the night. Before you, between
 you and the banks of the now violent flow, a swirling mass of darkness
 forms itself into a cloaked figure. Standing forth, it speaks:

 The wraith laughs coldly. "So, we meet again!"

 "And it shall be for the FINAL time!  You shall not escape me so
 easily!"

 "MURDERER!  So you kill again!  Slaughtering an innocent in cold
 blood!"

>tell wraith about accident

 "MURDERER!  So you kill again!  Slaughtering an innocent in cold
 blood!"

>no
 "How say you so?!  Not murder?!"

 "How do you explain away your action?!"

>accident
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tell wraith about car
 "An accident?  HA!  You killed that poor child in your haste to flee!
 You butchered in your panicked flight from the guilt of your evil!"

 "You are a fool and a coward!"

>tell wraith about figure

 "You are a fool and a coward!"

>tell wraith about girl

 "You are a fool and a coward!"

 "You are a fool and a coward!"

>no
 "Liar!  What bravery have you shown?!"

 "What adversary have YOU stood against!?"

>you
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tell wraith about wraith
 The wraith stands silent as you shout that you have have bravery enough
 to stand against it and the fear and guilt you have felt. Then, as
 suddenly as it appeared, the Wraith vanishes, and in its place stands
 Clotho of the Parcae.

 "You have done it!" she cries, her face and eyes bright with tears. "Oh
 Timothy, you have defeated the Wraith, the guilt and darkness within
 yourself, the embodiment of all you feared ... "

 She turns and faces the battling forces behind her. As you both watch,
 the glow from the orb slowly begins to increase in intensity, flooding
 the buckling waters with shafts of brilliant light. Wailing in pain and
 defeat, the blackness begins to subside, and the river begin to
 brighten. In moments, there is nothing left of the foul substance, and
 the waters flowing outward from the font are crystal-clear.

 Approaching the edge of the bank, Clotho reaches out and grasps the orb
 in both hands. With a sly smile, she places it in her robes, where it
 vanishes between the folds.

 "Come Timothy," she says as she motions you towards the fount. "Come
 drink..."

 The water is cold as it passes your lips and after drinking deeply, you
 find the water quenching a deep thirst you never knew you had. As you
 continue, gulping draught after draught, you find your mind opening,
 the light of the illuminating water brightening some hidden darkness
 deep within you. As you stand and turn back to Clotho, you reach an
 epiphany: that the guilt you felt for the accident was unwarranted.
 Certainly, you should have paid more attention, but that would not have
 saved the girl. Attention or not, her sudden appearance in the middle
 of the road is what caught you by surprise.

 Clotho nods. "Yes Timothy, the light you have drawn down from the skies
 has illuminated the the secrets you have kept from yourself. Well
 done."

 "The final step has been taken, Timothy. The Tapestry is finished, your
 Moira secure. The fear and guilt of your past you have faced bravely,
 and perhaps this fate you have woven for yourself is better then the
 one We originally wove for you. The time has come to leave this place
 of indecision, mortal, and face whatever destiny lies before you. I
 wish you well."

 The whirling threads appear, and tear you from where you stand into
 their heaving embrace...

 Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died.

 This was only natural, being mortal. The life he led was probably most
 unusual in its normalcy; his childhood so much so as to be mundane.
 Neither praised nor reviled, neither a leader nor an outcast, he was
 simply another face in the crowd. He went to school, he studied, he did
 well enough to get by. After graduation he found a job he was good at
 and paid well enough. He bought a little house and lived there, a
 bother to no one, and the days just flowed one into the other...

 In fact, the first event of any importance in his life was the death of
 his mother.

 She had been ill for quite a while, and during this time, Timothy was
 under a great deal of stress. His small, comfortable world fell apart
 around him as he realized that something had ended; an innocent part of
 his life where he had thought she would always be with him was over.

 The Thompson account had totally slipped his mind, and he had been
 frantically trying to finish it when he heard the news that she was
 dying. An hour they gave her at the most. Faced with the agonizing
 choice of being with her in her final moments on this earth, or helping
 the Thompson's from losing everything they had, he chose to go to City
 Hall to get the papers that were necessary signed.

 As quickly as he could, he rushed to his mother's side, only to realize
 it was to late. The guilt and self-loathing he felt for what he thought
 to be abandoning her were terrible. It took him a long time to realize
 that it was probably what his mother would have wanted him to do. He
 had stayed with her as much as he could when she was alive, had checked
 up on her at every opportunity, and the Thompsons had a great deal more
 to lose than she. He was very glad that he had a last opportunity to
 say farewell to her at the funeral. He knew she understood.

 The time after his mother's death was a lonely one for Timothy, perhaps
 because, for the first time, he realized he was truly alone. Then, he
 met Sarah, and everything changed. She was so loving, so full of life,
 so willing to drag him from the small, empty world he had built for
 himself. They complemented each other so well: her spontaneity to his
 structure, her boundless energy to his complacency. Their whirlwind
 romance caught him totally unawares, and when she accepted his proposal
 of marriage, he thought himself the happiest man on earth.

 Truly, their first five years together were the happiest time of his
 life. The experience of having his life so intricately tied to another
 was exhiliarating; he built his entire existence around her.

 Which is why her falling ill struck him so hard.

 It was agonizing for Timothy to see her wasting away. "Apentrylic
 Syndrome" they called it, a metabolic disorder carried in a recessive
 gene. There wasn't a cure, they told him, and they didn't think she'd
 last more than a year.

 They were wrong. For five years, Timothy watched his wife slowly
 rotting away from the inside. Her energy faded, her strength tapped
 away. The woman who had filled his life with motion and vitality now
 could barely lift her head to take the countless pills the doctors
 prescribed. But she never complained, she never once told him how much
 pain she was in, how tired she was. But Timothy knew just the same.

 After five years, it seemed as though it would never end. Not wishing
 to see her suffer further, not understanding why she had to continue
 such an agonized existence, he tried his best to help her. Putting her
 to sleep, he smothered her, praying that her death had been peaceful
 and painless. There was never any investigation of her death, the
 report said she died in her sleep.

 The guilt of Sarah's death on his hands was horrible for Timothy,
 especially in the face of a possible cure. Facing his fears and his
 guilt, Timothy forced himself to face his wife's suffering, to realize
 that he had helped her in the best way he knew how, and that he hoped
 she would understand why he had done it. When he found a final note
 among Sarah's possessions, he knew she had.

 The time after Sarah's death was much like it had been before his
 mother's; his life mundane, his existence centered around his work. But
 Timothy's experiences irrevocably changed him; he was no longer the
 same man. Timothy thought a great deal of his life, of what he'd seen
 and what he had done. It seemed so unfair that bad things happened
 again and again to good people. Some nights he would go driving, trying
 to ease his mind, trying to find an answer to a question he couldn't
 formulate.

 The night he died he had been driving for hours, hardly aware of the
 world around him. When the young girl came flailing into the middle of
 the street, it was too late to stop in time. Both of them were killed
 instantly.

 It turned out that the young woman had been arguing with her boyfriend,
 and in a struggle, had half been pushed, half pushed herself into the
 road.

 Timothy Hunter was born, he lived, he died. To say anything more would

     *** You have completed the Tapestry ***


 Congratulations. You have completed the story of TAPESTRY. You have
 chosen the Path of Clotho, and have followed it to its conclusion.

 TAPESTRY contains three mutually-exclusive endings. If you wish, you
 can play again, choose a different Path, and see how your actions
 effect the outcome.

 First, I would like to thank the following people for their invaluable
 help:

      Timothy "Hunter" Evanson -- for being there at the story's
 conception.
           It wouldn't be half the game it became without him.
      Sabrina "Stinky" Ravipinto -- for love, support, and MORE patience
           than any human being could possibly require.
      Steph "Psych-o" Barnett -- for story ideas and all that important
           rat-training info.
      David "Astro" Walton -- for nitpicking above and beyond the call
 of duty.
      David "OG" Learn -- for makin' Astro's nitpickin' look like
 nothin'.
      Allison "Squeaky" Tumarkin -- for writing something even odder
 than
           TAPESTRY.
      Niki "Willow" Hinson -- for smartening up the parser by whining
 that
           it was stupid.
      Andy "The Boy" Olson -- for a million-and-one Bible references.
      Audra "Oh I Had A Little Chicken" Senato -- for alpha-testing and
           backup-singing.
      Mike "Milk" Shultz -- for fitting me into his ever-busy schedule.
      Erika "Erika" Stoll -- for putting up with my eccentricities long
           enough to beta-test.


 A BIG thank you to the IF Competition Betatesters:

      Michael "The Legend" Kinyon -- Simply the best tester I've ever
 had the
            pleasure to work with. Period.
      "V. BALAVAGE" -- for great comments and a ton of information for
            my NEXT game.
      Also thanks to Charles Carr and Jarrod Henry.


 This game was an attempt to see if a serious and interesting story
 could be merged with traditional IF 'puzzle' elements without one
 overshadowing the other. Also, I attempted to tackle a few of the
 issues that have been discussed recently on r.a.i-f, including
 mutually-exclusive paths, a pre-defined main character, moral dilemmas,
 'puzzle-less' IF, and semi-realistic NPCs.

 I hope that I've come close to achieving my goals and have entertained
 you in the process. I would love to hear any and all comments or
 constructive criticism you may have. My current e-mail address can be
 found by using the 'AUTHOR' command.

 Thanks!  -d

 Fleeting glimpses of faces half-remembered in the gloom. Screams, the
 sound of squealing tires, a sudden thump, a sickening crunch and a
 violent jolt followed by a sense of weightlessness and disassociation.
 The last thing you remember is an overwhelming feeling of guilt and
 regret, forcing its way through the chaos that surrounds you and then
 there is...

 Nothing
 Your sight fails you. For that matter, you don't know if your eyes are
 opened or closed. Concepts like time and place have no meaning here.
 Your mind attempts to impose something, some order, some structure,
 upon the space in which you exist, and fails. There is only the void.
 For all you know, that is all there ever was.

>wait
 There is only Nothing.

>wait
 There is only Nothing.

 No, wait. There is ... something, moving in the darkness. It dances at
 the edge of your new-found vision, teasing you. You turn your head
 toward the shape, when your neck suddenly gives out and your head lolls
 backward. Blinding pain explodes from the back of your head.

 Your eyes flutter open...

 White Room
 A small room, with circular walls and a floor of pale white stone.
 There are no apparent exits, other than a small slit of a window off to
 one side.

 An angelic-looking young man looks upon you with concern.

 Along the far wall opposite the window hangs a tapestry.

 The young man smiles.

 "Ah, you are all right. You had me worried, my friend," he says.

>examine man
 A face almost harsh in its perfection, with crystal-clear blue eyes
 half-covered by a flowing mane of gold. He wears a gown of white, about
 his neck is a silver pendant, and in his left hand he carries the long
 graceful curve of an ivory torch.

>ask man about man
 "I fear I cannot help you with that, my friend."

 The young man's smile suddenly fades and he sighs.

 "There is much we must speak of my friend," he says. He turns and
 points at the tapestry. "And there are choices which must be made."

>examine tapestry
 A large, intricately woven tapestry which depicts three tableaus on
 three different panels.

>examine torch
 A torch made of pure ivory, with three silver rings up its length.

 "But here, I have not even introduced myself. Forgive me," he says,
 bowing with a flourish. "I am ... Morningstar."

>examine first
 Upon the first panel is a scene of an elderly woman in a hospital, with
 a doctor looking sadly down upon her.

>examine lucifer
 A voice in your ear remarks, "So educated."

 Morningstar looks away from you for a moment.

 "Know now, mortal, that your life is over. You no longer are counted
 among the living, but you are not yet among the dead. Know thyself,
 Timothy Hunter, and know that because of your actions in life and what
 has just happened at the moment of your death, the fate of your soul is
 in doubt."

>examine satan
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine samhain
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine samuel
 You can't see any such thing.

>take pendant
 Morningstar watches you reaching out for the pendant in shock. Just as
 you are about to take it, he grasps your hand in an iron grip.

 "What are you doing?" he whispers. He stares at the pendant for a
 moment, his face blank.

 "You can see this?" he whispers to you. You can only no dumbly. He
 suddenly recovers himself.

 "It is unimportant, Timothy. Pay attention to matters of more import."

>pickpocket pendant
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>break pendant
 And what would that accomplish?

>steal pendant
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>eat pendant
 (first taking the Morningstar's silver pendant)
 "I told you that was unimportant, mortal," Morningstar growls. "Leave
 it be."

>purloin pendant
 That's not a verb I recognise.
