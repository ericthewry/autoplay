 "Hello.  You have reached the Frobozz Magic Support Company hotglyph.
 All our adepts are busy at present, but if you keep chanting the

 FROBOZZ MAGIC SUPPORT
 An Interactive Short Fantasy
 by Nate Cull, culln@xtra.co.nz
 Release 4, February 1997.  HELP for instructions.

 Inside the White Cube
 The six interior walls of this perfectly cubical room are perfectly
 white and featureless.  A single silver compass rose, balancing a
 delicate crystal sphere on its bloom, floats like a pedestal above the
 floor.

>examine me
 You look like the novice glyph support clerk that you are.

>inventory
 You have a granola bar and a log book.

>examine bar
 It's a bar of everyone's favourite snack food, granola.  Stamped into
 its side are the words "Product of the Frobozz Magic Granola Mining
 Company Antharia."

>book
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine book
 The book is leather-bound and bears the title "My Log Book" in flowing
 gilt lettering.  It is currently closed.

>xyzzy
 Unfortunately, you never quite finished Elementary Enchanting 101, so
 you have no idea how to cast, or even learn, that spell.  If indeed it
 is a spell.

>plugh
 Unfortunately, you never quite finished Elementary Enchanting 101, so
 you have no idea how to cast, or even learn, that spell.  If indeed it
 is a spell.

>spells
 You have no spells memorised.

>open book
 As you open the log book, an animated burin flutters out.

 "Hi there," says the burin cheerfully.  "You must be the new support
 clerk everyone's been talking about.  No, don't say it, I know what
 you're going to ask.  What's such a smart and attractive burin like me
 doing in a low paid job like Magic Support?  Well, I've asked myself
 that same question many times, believe me, and the best answer I've
 come up with is that I love my work.  Yes sir, I just love task
 logging.  Give me a task to log, any task, and I'll have it written
 down before you can say Zebulon's your uncle!"

>ZOG

>no

>Zog the Mighty

>yes

 "Great!  I can see we're going to get along famously, Zog the mighty."
 The burin buzzes around excitedly, then settles into a casual hovering
 pattern over your head.

>examine burin
 This burin looks much every other burin you've seen, except for the
 small wings protruding from its pen-like body, and the tiny glowing
 eyes on its nib.

>burin, log task
 The burin blinks at you.  "I don't see any task worth logging here."

 "This reminds me of Old Quendor," muses the burin to itself.  "Or was
 it Kroz?  Anyways, thems were the days, they had real adventurers back
 then, yessiree."

>examine sphere
 You see an image of a novice glyph support clerk peering into the
 future.

>examine pedestal
 The compass rose is so beautiful it would bring tears to the eyes of a
 grue.  Oddly enough, it seems to float perfectly centred in the middle
 of the room.

>examine rose
 The compass rose is so beautiful it would bring tears to the eyes of a
 grue.  Oddly enough, it seems to float perfectly centred in the middle
 of the room.

>read log
 The opened log book contains a list of previous magic support problems
 and solutions, signed and dated by the clerk on duty at the time.

 24/4   Malyon spell backfired; burin accidentally animated.  Oops.
 Zuzvuz.
 27/4   Adventurer eaten by stray grues.  Resurrected with gaspar.
 Zuzvuz.
 32/4   Trolls ravaging village.  Applied two-handed axe; resolved.
 Felenar.
 6/5    Some trouble communicating with cyclops.  See legend 2001.
 Zuzvuz.
 13/5   Adventurer llepsed gaspar.  Summoned Implementors.  Zuzvuz.
 17/5   Implementors de-implemented Zuzvuz.  Attempted blorple to Old
        Quendor.  Felenar.
 20/5   Felenar and Zuzvuz missing.  Sent replacement job application to
        GUE Tech.  Sorkin.
 23/5   GUE Tech gated to Old Quendor.  Llepsed golmac might work.
 Sorkin.
 29/5   Two words: why me?  New support clerk arrives tomorrow.  Must
 train
        before (after) breaking Sorkin's time loop.  Assuming
 counterspell
        exists, if not...  Helistar.

>ask burin about sorkin
 The burin launches into a lengthy exposition on the meaning of life,
 with special consideration to the role of sentient burins as its prime
 representatives.  After discussing and refuting all imaginable
 challenges to this thesis, the burin abruptly stops and says, "I'm
 sorry, what was the question again?"

 The burin practises its penthingship.

>ask burin about spells
 But you don't know anything worth mentioning about any spells yet.

>ask burin about log
 "It's a log book," explains the burin patiently.  "Used for logging
 Magic Support tasks.  When you finish a task, just tell me to log it
 and I'll write all the details up for you.  I'm really very good at it.
 It's almost as if I were born to log tasks, and nothing else."

>ask burin about job
 The burin thinks for a moment and replies, "Tuesday."

>ask burin about rose
 The burin flaps thoughtfully and replies, "According to the traditional
 Thardon the Deep interpretation of Blorbaz the Seer, which was of
 course completely rejected by Antrodon, advisor to Duncanthrax himself,
 there are such an infinite number of potential frames of reference that
 it is quite impossible for two individuals to discourse intelligently
 about a compass rose without losing all touch with reality.  But I
 don't believe a word of that myself."

>take burin
 The burin flits out of reach.

>ask burin about helistar
 The burin thinks for a moment and replies, "The butler, in the Double
 Fanucci room, with the wand of polymorphism."

>ask burin about zuzvuz
 The burin thinks for a moment and replies, "No."

 The burin nibbles softly at your ear.

>search rose
 You find nothing of interest.

>turn rose
 You feel a strong desire to go somewhere, anywhere.

>touch rose
 You feel a strong desire to go somewhere, anywhere.

>ask burin about me
 The burin stretches its wings and preens.  "Of course, I'm sure I could
 tell you everything ever written about yourself, but that would spoil
 all the fun, wouldn't it?"

 The burin flies a slow loop around your shoulder.

>look in sphere
 You see an image of a novice glyph support clerk peering into the
 future.

>take sphere
 A warning nymph appears before you, writes "You do know you're not
 allowed to take company property, don't you?" in the air with her
 finger, then vanishes with a broad wink.

>go north
 Oddly enough, you find your way blocked by an invisible barrier.

 "Isn't this fun?" giggles the burin.  "By the Quill, 'twill make a tall
 tale to tell thy tykes."

>examine barrier
 I don't know the word "barrier".

>turn sphere
 Turning the crystal ball doesn't have any effect.

>examine rose
 The compass rose is so beautiful it would bring tears to the eyes of a
 grue.  Oddly enough, it seems to float perfectly centred in the middle
 of the room.

>push rose north
 You can't seem to do that.

>push rose
 Pushing the compass rose doesn't do anything.

>touch sphere
 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your
 mind:

 You are standing on a barren, windswept plain.  A knight in black
 armour clatters past toward a foreboding stone tower, and from the
 distance, a beautiful maiden's voice calls out.  "Help me!  My rezrov
 scroll is gone and I must flee before the Dark Lord comes!"

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

>go north
 As you move in that direction, the universe abruptly turns itself
 inside out.

 Crossroads
 The road bends here, running northwest to a distant tower and south to
 the mountains.  Across a barren plain to the east, a wide rutted cart
 track bears the scars of recent heavy troop movements.

 You see a white cube here.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

 "You aren't lost, are you?" quips the burin worriedly.

>burin, log task
 The burin blinks at you.  "I don't see any task worth logging here."

>go east
 Army Camp
 You have stumbled into the camp of some invading army.  Tents,
 battering rams and hand weapons are stacked neatly all around, awaiting
 the coming attack.  Nobody appears to have noticed you yet, but you
 have the distinct feeling that novice magic support clerks are not
 highly regarded around here.  The plain opens to the west.

 You see a black cube here.

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

 The burin gives a screech of agony and dives back into the log book,
 which snaps closed after it.

>examine cube
 The cube is about an inch on a side, and is featureless black, apart
 from a tiny legend embossed on one face.

>examine legend
 "Frobozz Magic Defence Research Company Weapons Grade Antimagic."

>get cube
 Taken.

>examine tents
 The army supplies look extremely dangerous, and extremely not yours.

>examine rams

 As you touch the cube, the universe abruptly turns itself inside out.

 Inside the White Cube
 The six interior walls of this perfectly cubical room are perfectly
 white and featureless.  A single silver compass rose, balancing a
 delicate crystal sphere on its bloom, floats like a pedestal above the
 floor.

 The black cube vaporises instantly!
 The crystal sphere tumbles to the floor!
 The compass rose bursts into a flower of flame!

>undo

 You see a white cube here.

>go northwest
 Outside the Tower
 You are standing beneath a menacing black stone tower.  The only
 entrance at ground level seems to be a sturdy oak door which is shut
 and bolted fast.  However, rough stone steps wind up around the outside
 and vanish somewhere near the top.  The road leads back across a barren
 plain to the southeast.

 It's firmly shut, and plans to stay that way.

>open door
 Not without magic or a battering ram you won't.

>knock on door
 I don't know the word "knock".

 It looks like a Frobozz Magic Castle Company Princess Peril (TM) Tower
 For Her, as advertised in last month's catalog edition of "Better Keeps
 and Dungeons".

>examine window
 I don't know the word "window".

 The steps lead upward.

>go up
 (climbing the steps)
 Atop the Tower
 You are crouched on a minnaret at the top of a menacing stone tower.
 Rough stone steps lead down around the outside and vanish somewhere
 near the ground.  A dark chimney opening to the northwest seems the
 only way in - but once inside, you could not climb back out.

>examine chimney
 You could enter the chimney to the northwest.

 There's nothing on the ground.

 You are swimming in the depths of an unfathomable ocean.  A dark shape
 with sleek fins and hundreds of shiny white teeth looms toward you and

 snavig spell appears to have jammed on.  Could you possibly help?"

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

 You are standing on a tiny rock islet, barely more than a few feet

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

 You are in pitch darkness.  From all around you can hear horrible

 I don't see any grue here.

 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your

 You are standing on the peak of a mountain reaching high above the rim
 of the world.  Dazzling light fills your eyes, and a hollow voice booms
 down:
 "Don't try to match wits with us, Zuzvuz.  We'll consider your request
 for reimplementation in the next beta release, not a single compile
 before."

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

 The burin preens itself, licking traces of ink from its nib.

 Outside Temple
 You are standing on the apex of a towering rock pinnacle high in the

 unfinished shell of a building, presumably a temple of some kind.

 An animated burin is perched on your head.

 The temple, or what parts of have been built, appears to have been

 You are inside the temple, which seems to be built roughly in a square;
 the roof, still unfinished, is open to the sky.  In the centre of the

 You are clinging to the edge of a bridge above a vast chasm.  A
 thundering waterfall cascades through a rainbow below, while from

 gold?"

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

 End of path
 You are standing at the end of a path running north into dense forest.
 A small sign casts a shadow beside the path, while just to the south, a
 wooden bridge leads across a massive chasm.

 deep shadow beside the footprint-covered path.

>examine shadow
 The shadow points due north, into the forest.  A small clump of moss is
 growing in the shadow, at the base of the sign.

>examine sun
 The sun is visible to the south of here.

 The moss is on the north side of the sign.

 "Make sure you get a good look at everything," cheeps the burin
 helpfully.

>go south
 Chasm, on the bridge
 You are standing on a wooden bridge, which stretches halfway across a
 vast chasm to the south.  Beyond the bridge, a rainbow arcs across the
 chasm through clouds of mist from a spectacular waterfall.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

>go north
 End of path
 You are standing at the end of a path running north into dense forest.
 A small sign casts a shadow beside the path, while just to the south, a
 wooden bridge leads across a massive chasm.

 You see a white cube here.

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

>go north
 The forest seems to change subtly as you enter it.

 Forest
 You are deep in the forest, surrounded by towering trees and sticky
 clinging vines.  A trail winds through the trees at this point, but
 then seems to fade into the undergrowth without a trace.  Your sense of

 A bored tourist wanders around looking lost.

 The tourist looks up at you with a faint flicker of interest.  "Frobozz
 Magic Support?  At least something works around here.  Look, I'll do
 anything you ask, just get me out of this stupid forest!"

 The burin preens itself, licking traces of ink from its nib.

>tourist, follow me
 "Huh?" says the tourist.

 The tourist wears a gaudy flower print T-shirt and a pair of shorts,
 and is carrying nothing.  He scratches his head and yawns every few
 minutes.

 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your

 You are at the bottom of an immense smouldering crater gashed out of
 bare rock. Stars flicker slowly in a midnight sky, and through the
 eerie silence a single voice wails over and over again, "Yek wen eht

 Moments earlier, you find yourself falling backward through a strangely
 familiar college campus.  A vague premonition tugs at your mind about
 some great deed left undone - or was it a memory?  As you watch,
 buildings dismantle and shed moss, spells implode on their casters, and
 stars spin down across the oscillating sky.

 A woman in a senior Enchanter's robe steps away from you, gathers a
 cloud of green lightning with a wave of her hands, and runs into the
 distance saying "Nialpxe ot emit on.  Tfel evah I cigam ylno eht si

 northeast.

 You are standing at the entrance to a large, familiar college campus.
 At least, it would be large and familiar if it existed, which it

 Outside the Tower
 You are standing beneath a menacing black stone tower.  The only
 entrance at ground level seems to be a sturdy oak door which is shut

 plain to the southeast.

 An animated burin is perched on your head.

 Atop the Tower
 You are crouched on a minnaret at the top of a menacing stone tower.
 Rough stone steps lead down around the outside and vanish somewhere

 only way in - but once inside, you could not climb back out.

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

 "Come on! Let's go exploring!" chirps the burin excitedly.

 Very well.  You scramble into the chimney, sliding down and landing
 heavily...

 Inside the Tower
 This circular room at the base of the tower is surprisingly small for
 its size. An unlit fireplace to the northwest, and a sturdy oak door to
 the southeast, (which is shut and bolted), are its only points of
 interest.

 A captive princess paces around the room impatiently.

 A white cotton blindfold, apparently flung off by the princess after
 she arrived here, lies crumpled in a corner.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

 The princess jumps as you stumble clumsily out of the fireplace.  "With
 an entrance like that, you've got to be Frobozz Magic Support," she
 laughs.  "Hope you brought that rezrov scroll.  We don't have any time
 to waste."

>get blindfold

 "Hurry up!" says the princess.  "The Dark Lord will be coming soon."

 looks for a weapon.

 The princess takes the scroll, reads it, and flashes you a beaming
 smile.  "That's just what I wanted," she says, and begins reading it
 aloud.

 The door explodes outwards in a blast of luminous energy.  Waving a

 Deciding that discretion is the better part of valour, you beat a

 End of path
 You are standing at the end of a path running north into dense forest.
 A small sign casts a shadow beside the path, while just to the south, a
 wooden bridge leads across a massive chasm.

 You see a white cube here.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

>get cube
 As you touch the cube, the universe abruptly turns itself inside out.

 Inside the White Cube
 The six interior walls of this perfectly cubical room are perfectly
 white and featureless.  A single silver compass rose, balancing a
 delicate crystal sphere on its bloom, floats like a pedestal above the
 floor.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

 "Isn't this fun?" giggles the burin.  "By the Quill, 'twill make a tall
 tale to tell thy tykes."

>touch sphere
 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your
 mind:

 You are at the bottom of an immense smouldering crater gashed out of
 bare rock. Stars flicker slowly in a midnight sky, and through the
 eerie silence a single voice wails over and over again, "Yek wen eht
 ton!  Yek dlo eht esu!"

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

>touch sphere
 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your

 You are standing on a barren, windswept plain.  A knight in black
 armour clatters past toward a foreboding stone tower, and from the

 scroll is gone and I must flee before the Dark Lord comes!"

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

 The burin flutters around your head.

>touch sphere
 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your

 You are swimming in the depths of an unfathomable ocean.  A dark shape
 with sleek fins and hundreds of shiny white teeth looms toward you and

 snavig spell appears to have jammed on.  Could you possibly help?"

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

>touch sphere
 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your

 Corridor
 You are in a gently sloping underground passage which curves upwards to
 the west, and down into darkness to the south.  A dim light filters in
 through cracked timbers overhead.

 You see a white cube here.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

 "If you can pick it up, it's yours," the burin sniggers sagely.

>go west
 Dead end
 The eastern passage ends here in a sizeable chamber carved out of solid
 bedrock.  A dull orange glow (probably the natural phosphorescence of
 rich granola seams nearby) fills the room with memories of sulphur and
 smelting flames, long consigned to history.

 A dented vending machine still sits proudly against one wall.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

 "Oooh!" squeals the burin, darting toward the vending machine.  "A
 genuine Frotzen Vend-O-Magic!  I've always wanted to play with one of
 these vintage originals.  They really push my buttons, y'know?"

>examine machine
 The machine is about twice your height, dull metallic gold in tone,
 crusted with years of neglect.  It seems to have a slot, a red button,
 a black button, a plaque, and two chutes near its base.

 You are standing on a tiny rock islet, barely more than a few feet

 You are swimming, or to be more precise, sinking, in a vast ocean.  The

 A blue shark glides past.

 Unfortunately, you have no time to enjoy the experience, as a misplaced

 Inside the White Cube
 The six interior walls of this perfectly cubical room are perfectly

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

 Deciding that discretion is the better part of valour, you beat a
 tactical withdrawal to the west.

 As you move in that direction, the universe abruptly turns itself
 inside out.

 Ocean
 You are standing on a tiny rock islet, barely more than a few feet
 across, in the middle of a vast ocean.  No land is visible in any
 direction, and the water swirls threateningly about your feet.

 You see a white cube here.

 An animated burin flies in small circles around your head.

 Saved.

>put grey cube in water
 The grey cube falls into the water, and immediately is engulfed in a
 mass of swirling foam, undulating higher and higher until it seems
 certain to smother you.  But the foam storm eventually subsides, to
 reveal a single giant bubble.

>enter bubble
 The bubble rocks slightly as you squeeze inside, but remains intact.

 Ocean, in the giant bubble
 You are floating in a giant soap bubble, on the surface of a vast
 ocean.  Apart from a tiny rock islet, barely more than a few feet
 across, no land is visible in any direction.

 You see a white cube here.

 An animated burin is perched on your head.

>go down
 At your touch, the bubble glides gently downward.

 Under the Ocean, in the giant bubble
 You are floating in a vast ocean, surrounded by a giant soap bubble
 full of damp but breathable air.  Faint light from the distant surface
 overhead refracts off the bubble's walls into the mysterious depths
 beyond.

 A blue shark glides past.

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

>examine shark
 The shark gives you a fishy, toothy, kind of stare which you somehow
 find vaguely disturbing.

 The burin flutters around your head.

>go down
 The bubble bobs, but descends no further.

>open envelope
 Opening the red envelope reveals a packing slip and a black cube.

 The burin gives a screech of agony and dives back into the log book,
 which snaps closed after it.

 The bubble shimmers soapily.

>get cube
 Taken.

>give cube to shark
 The black cube slips through the bubble's wall and into the water.  In
 a single smooth movement, the shark darts forward and swallows it.

 A dull black glow shimmers over the shark's body for a moment, and in
 its place a surprised-looking enchanter appears.  He waves at you
 briefly and swims up toward the light.

 The bubble's walls tremble softly.

>go up
 At your touch, the bubble glides gently upward.

 Ocean, in the giant bubble
 You are floating in a giant soap bubble, on the surface of a vast
 ocean.  Apart from a tiny rock islet, barely more than a few feet
 across, no land is visible in any direction.

 You see a white cube here.

 A man in enchanter's robes stands on the islet, drying himself off.

 The bubble's walls tremble softly.

>examine man
 The enchanter looks about as old as you are young, with the
 profession's typical air of lofty mystique, but he seems to be having a
 bad day so far.

 With a liquid 'thwap', the bubble bursts, tossing you back onto the
 islet.

 Ocean
 You are standing on a tiny rock islet, barely more than a few feet

 direction, and the water swirls threateningly about your feet.

 You see a white cube here.

 A man in enchanter's robes stands on the islet, drying himself off.

>ask man about shark
 The enchanter, deep in thought, doesn't respond.

 The enchanter raises a hand in greeting.  "Well met, young clerk.  I
 see you face a dangerous puzzle, and you must not do that unaided."  He
 hands you back the black cube, which appears from thin air, and frowns
 in deep concentration.

>put cube in envelope
 Done.

 The enchanter stares into the distance, brow furrowed.  "But no, that
 would be utter foolishness.  Such an ancient power in the hands of..."
 he breaks off and studies you thoughtfully.

>close envelope
 Closed.

 The enchanter shakes his head.  "It is decided.  What was, must be.
 Listen to me carefully.  I shall grant you one spell, only one, the
 oldest and most sacred of all the lore of Quendor.  I dare not speak
 its name or tell you its purpose.  That, you alone must discover.  Look
 at me now, and steel your heart with virtue."

>examine enchanter
 You feel the enchanter's eyes boring deep into your soul.  A burst of
 power fills you, and a single spell leaps into existence at the back of
 your mind.  The enchanter smiles, swirls his cloak, and is gone.

 [You can now use the word SPELLS to check what spells you know.]

>spells
 You have the qwerty spell (whatever that is), stamped indelibly on your
 mind.

>open book
 Opened.  The burin flutters out again.

>burin, log task
 The burin scribbles something into the logbook.

 "Isn't this fun?" giggles the burin.  "By the Quill, 'twill make a tall
 tale to tell thy tykes."

>get cube
 As you touch the cube, the universe abruptly turns itself inside out.

 Inside the White Cube
 The six interior walls of this perfectly cubical room are perfectly
 white and featureless.  A single silver compass rose, balancing a
 delicate crystal sphere on its bloom, floats like a pedestal above the
 floor.

 An animated burin is perched on your head.

>touch sphere
 The sphere vibrates in your hands, and an image takes form in your
 mind:

 You are in pitch darkness.  From all around you can hear horrible
 lurking droolings, and a single sudden metallic clatter.  A nervous
 voice says, "Hello? Can you bring a new battery?  I don't know for
 sure, but I think these might be gr - "

 Slowly, the vision fades.  You feel vaguely disoriented for a moment.

>open envelope
 Opening the red envelope reveals a packing slip and a black cube.

 The burin gives a screech of agony and dives back into the log book,
 which snaps closed after it.

 The black cube trembles briefly inside the unsealed envelope, then
 vaporises!
 The crystal sphere tumbles to the floor!
 The compass rose bursts into a flower of flame!

>get rose
 Taken.

 The room shudders violently, rocked by explosions all around.
 The crystal sphere vibrates ominously.

>go down
 As you move in that direction, the universe abruptly turns itself
 inside out.

 Corridor
 You are in a gently sloping underground passage which curves upwards to
 the west, and down into darkness to the south.  A dim light filters in
 through cracked timbers overhead.

 You see a white cube here.

 The compass rose continues to burn.

 The white cube trembles softly.

>go south
 Curving passage
 The flickering light of the compass rose picks out the curve of this
 grimy corridor as it twists from north to southeast.

 The compass rose continues to burn.

 A dank, rancid breeze wafts up the corridor.

>se
 Dark chamber
 A narrow crawl to the northwest opens here into a wide natural chamber,
 showing signs of later excavation and even later collapse.  Tortured
 fragments of rock and rusted equipment lie scattered among piles of
 human-looking bones that crunch horribly underfoot.

 A terrified adventurer crouches among the rubble, frantically waving a
 pair of unlit brass lanterns.

 The compass rose continues to burn.

>give battery to adventurer
 The adventurer takes the battery with trembling hands, and fumbles it
 into the shiny new lantern.  As the lamp switches on, he wipes the
 sweat from his brow and relaxes visibly.  Tossing the battered old
 lantern aside, he starts walking around the chamber examining objects.

 The compass rose continues to burn.

 The adventurer tries to turn the collection of rocks.

>open book
 Opened.  The burin flutters out again.

 The compass rose continues to burn.

 The adventurer listens to the collection of rocks.

>burin, log task
 The burin scribbles something into the logbook.

 The compass rose continues to burn.

 The adventurer mutters an incantation over the collection of rocks.

 The adventurer tries to turn the scrawled lettering.

 The burin practises its penthingship.

 As you touch the cube, the universe abruptly turns itself inside out.

 Inside the White Cube
 The six interior walls of this white cubical room are shaking and
 disintegrating as you watch.

 You see a crystal ball here.

 The compass rose blows apart in a soft shower of petals.

 The walls sway with terrifying disregard for physics.
 The sphere spits out several tiny shards with a crystalline -ping-.

 An animated burin is perched on your head.

>touch sphere
 As you touch the sphere, a faint, flickering image forms in your mind:

 You are standing on the peak of a mountain reaching high above the rim
 of the world.  Dazzling light fills your eyes, and a hollow voice booms
 down:
 "Don't try to match wits with us, Zuzvuz.  We'll consider your request
 for reimplementation in the next beta release, not a single compile
 before."

 The vision abruptly cuts to black, as the crystal sphere explodes into
 a thousand splinters!

 Black writhing cracks appear in the walls, with endless night beyond.

>go up
 As you move in that direction, the universe abruptly turns itself
 inside out.

 Outside Temple
 You are standing on the apex of a towering rock pinnacle high in the
 southern mountains.  Before you, to the northeast, stands the
 unfinished shell of a building, presumably a temple of some kind.

 You see a white cube here.

 The white cube vaporises in a miniature thunderclap.

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

>read logbook
 The opened log book contains a list of previous magic support problems
 and solutions, signed and dated by the clerk on duty at the time.

 24/4   Malyon spell backfired; burin accidentally animated.  Oops.
 Zuzvuz.
 27/4   Adventurer eaten by stray grues.  Resurrected with gaspar.

        Krosk lord of blood.
 30/5   Adventurer low on batteries.  Improvised with vending machine.
        Krosk lord of blood.

 The burin recites a few choice passages from the Rites of the
 Implementors, then laughs at them.

>go northwest
 There is no apparent way down the pinnacle.

>go north
 There is no apparent way down the pinnacle.

>enter temple
 In the Temple
 You are inside the temple, which seems to be built roughly in a square;
 the roof, still unfinished, is open to the sky.  In the centre of the
 room stands a transparent crystalline cube, about a metre a side.  A
 doorless archway leads out to the southwest.

 An animated burin hovers over your head.

>put lamp on cube
 As you put the battered old brass lantern on the crystal cube, it glows
 white and vanishes.

>put ruler on cube
 As you put the silver slide rule on the crystal cube, it glows white
 and vanishes.

>put coin on cube
 As you put the gold zorkmid on the crystal cube, it glows white and
 vanishes.

 The burin makes a lunge at its shadow, and misses.

>put book on cube
 As you put the log book on the crystal cube, it glows white and
 vanishes.

 The burin vanishes in a flurry of white sparkles.

>qwerty
 A bolt of thunder rumbles overhead.

>qwerty
 The sky darkens, and thunder rolls again.

>qwerty
 Jagged forks of lightning crackle through the swollen sky.

>qwerty
 A single lurid sheet of blue lightning arcs through the roof and
 strikes the crystal cube.  The universe turns white.

 Inside the Tesseract
 You are standing inside a very strangely dimensioned room, which
 appears to be composed of the plane surfaces between sixteen white
 cubes arranged at right angles to each other.  It's the sort of thing
 you've had nightmares about while sleeping through Elementary
 Hyperspatial Topology 101.  There are no visible exits.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

 A white-shadowed figure walks through a wall that isn't there, looks
 you up and down absently, and speaks to someone who patently doesn't
 exist.

 "Dave?  Looks like one of the NPCs has gone and tripped the invocation
 subroutine again.  I'd better comment it out before...  No, it can't be
 a player, we haven't had anyone get to the temple since we added the
 forest puzzle in the last beta.  Maybe we should put in some more...
 okay, okay, I'll check.  I'm telling you, though, there's not the
 slightest chance..."

>figure
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine figure
 The Implementor looks vaguely author-shaped.

 The Implementor continues talking to his unseen partner.

 "Hey, what do you know?  It's got the whole invocation right, and even
 logged all the support jobs!  That's one smart NPC.  Maybe we should
 take a copy of the object code and...  yeah, okay, so it might be a
 player after all.  Sure, hang on, I'll just check the trace file."

>qwerty
 A bolt of thunder rumbles overhead.

 "Oops.  Looks like deleting Zuzvuz broke the whole GUE Tech timewarp
 simulation.  It's running in an endless loop now.  No, there's no way
 I'm coding that up again, there's some really hairy hacks in there.
 Easiest thing's just to put Zuzvuz back in and recompile from the last
 source backup.  That should fix...  oh, yeah, sure, I think I can
 reward the player somehow.  Just give me a moment..."

 Abruptly, the universe goes dark.

 Blackness and Void
 Nothing happens.  It would seem that you are dead.

>wait
 Abruptly, the universe returns.

 GUE Tech, Modern Quendor
 You are walking through a familiar college campus.  Enchanters and
 students mingle around the ancient moss-covered buildings, and every
 few minutes you hear the thumps and yelps of spells misfiring in the
 labs.  Bright sunlight shines down from a cloudless blue sky.

>go west
 You enter the Interactive Mythology lab.

 A woman in senior Enchanter's robes runs up to you, gives you an
 informal hug, and grins.  "Well done, Krosk lord of blood.  You've
 saved the entire known universe with a single spell.  That's a tale
 which will be long remembered in the Encyclopedia Frobozzica.  Oh, but
 before I forget, this just came for you."

 Helistar hands you an envelope marked "Hero, Inc. Special Introductory
 Offer."  With trembling hands, you eagerly tear it open...

 But that's another story.

 *** The adventure is now over ***

 I understand there is ABSOLUTELY NO OBLIGATION and that I can withdraw
 from the contest at any time if I am in any way disappointed.

 (There is a large box about 1 inch square beside this statement).

 NO, I AM A WIMP.  I don't even want to think about heroic deeds, let
 alone try something I know I'm going to fail at horribly.  In fact, I
 think I'll jump off the Post Office Tower right now and end my
 miserable life.  I'm not signing anything.  Just go away and leave me
 alone.

 Bedroom
 This is your bedroom.  It would be hard to find a more ordinary room,

 You carefully tick the large box with the ballpoint pen.  No sooner is

 shrinks, warps, and turns itself inside out, sealing the enclosed
 Special Introductory Offer form into a cleverly pre-printed envelope.

 Hallway
 This hallway connects the various rooms which make up your perfectly
 ordinary house.  Your bedroom is south, the bathroom is east, the
 kitchen is north, and the lounge is west.

 Lounge
 The lounge is the most impressive room in your house.  A giant
 large-screen TV takes pride of place against one wall, and an equally
 imposing soft and comfy sofa sits facing it.  To the west is your front
 door (closed), and smaller doors lead northeast to the kitchen and east
 to the hall.

 Sitting on the TV set is a video cassette.

 With a sudden pang of terrible guilt, you remember that the videotape
 is overdue.  You move unconsciously to pick the cursed thing up before
 you forget it again.

 You are outside your ordinary house, the front door of which is open to

 Post Office Park
 You are walking in Post Office Park, a quaint old grassy field
 extending to the road in all directions.  In the distance you can see
 your house, a garage, some stores, the library and school, and of

 you, in the centre of the park, is a dingy old dribbling fountain.

 A child runs past, laughing.

 This large, bustling room must be the new Post Office.  A steady flow

 stands ready to serve them.  The sleek, ultra-modern lift opens to the
 north.

 The mail clerk shuffles some papers.

 You see a parcel and a ballpoint pen here.  The parcel seems to contain
 a packing slip.

 The sofa is surrounded by a crackling red glow.  You feel a strong
 static force pulling you towards it.

 "Hey there, this is Drac Thornwood telling YOU to watch NYTV, The
 Nytemare Channel.  Don't even THINK of touching that dial, 'cos have we
 got one HELL of a great lineup for you tonight!  But first, a word from
 our sponsor!"

 The screen goes to an ad break.

 "When you see crime, pollution, toxic waste, social breakdown, and
 nuclear Armageddon, who do you think of?  The Nytemare Corporation,
 that's who.  We're the world leader in all these fields and more.  So
 remember, next time you need a disaster of Biblical proportions in your
 neighbourhood, call us.  The Nytemare Corporation.  Because we know
 where you live."

 Hallway
 This hallway connects the various rooms which make up your perfectly

 You hear the TV playing in the lounge.

>go east
 Bathroom
 The bathroom seems normal enough.  There's a sink, toilet, and shower,
 and two doors leading west to the hall and north to the laundry.

 There is a very strange creature in the room.  It is a huge bloated
 balloon of a thing, covered in translucent black skin, with a puffy
 face and watery, bloodshot eyes which try to focus on you with some
 difficulty.  The creature yawns and waddles drunkenly.  It appears to
 be filling the entire laundry and most of the bathroom, as only its
 head and upper body is visible here.  A bright red glow surrounds it.

 The watch beeps and displays: "HYDROPHOBIA".

 The Sword of Virtue tingles in your hands.

 The Hydrophobia slurps noisily and bangs on a nearby waterpipe.

 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Hydrophobia.  The sword's
 blade strikes the creature in a shower of yellow sparks.

 The Hydrophobia does a double take.

 "'Ullo, wot's this ere?  An 'Ero with a bloomin' Sword of Virtue?
 Well, I was just leaving anyway.  I'll be seein' you around, matey.
 Next time, MY place."

 The creature oozes at you for a moment then shrinks into the laundry
 and gurgles down a pipe.  There is a burp from somewhere underground,
 followed by silence.  The laundry door slowly swings open.

 You hear the TV playing in the lounge.

>go north
 Laundry
 The laundry is one of the least-visited rooms in your house, and it's
 not hard to see why.  The single washing machine (glowing yellow) is
 nearly buried under a huge pile of unwashed clothes.  Doors lead out to
 the west and south.

 You hear the TV playing in the lounge.

 Lounge
 The lounge is the most impressive room in your house.  A giant
 large-screen TV takes pride of place against one wall, and an equally
 imposing soft and comfy sofa sits facing it.  To the west is your front
 door (closed), and smaller doors lead northeast to the kitchen and east
 to the hall.

 You see a parcel here.  The parcel seems to contain a packing slip.

 The sofa is surrounded by a crackling red glow.  You feel a strong
 static force pulling you towards it.

 "Drac Thornwood back again.  Just take a look at this season's new
 offerings, and I do mean OFFERINGS!  We've got the Wall to Wall Horror
 Movie Festival, the crazy Slash 'n Chop Song Show, and of course our
 old favourite, the Genocide Game!  All that and more, beamed right to
 your homes on The Nytemare Channel!  But now, a bulletin from the NYTV
 newsroom."

>go west
 You try to reach the door, but can't.  The static force from the sofa
 is too strong.  The presenter laughs.

 "Isn't it great to stay indoors and watch your favourite channel, NYTV!
 We'll be here to keep you company right through till midnight."

 "Yes, Drac, the rumours from Fairhaven have been confirmed.  Apparently
 a major Hero Convention is being held in that town as we speak.  Our
 sources are still vague but we believe this may pose the first real
 threat to Nytemare Corp's operations in several years.  Over to you,
 Drac."

>spray sofa with bottle
 You spray some Whito onto the sofa and it begins to smoke!  Years of
 built-up static electricity absorbed from the TV set are released in an
 explosion of sparks and flames!  Finally it cools down, a little singed
 but looking much cleaner.

 "Well, scary stuff there indeed.  We'll certainly be bringing you the
 latest on this story as it continues to develop.  But I'm sure the
 Corporation will be quite able to handle this new challenge.  Stay
 glued to your seats, viewers, while we take a short break."

>go west
 As you reach the door, a gust of freezing wind and rain comes blasting
 in!  The television image flickers.

 "Hey, you folks down in Fairhaven better not go too far away from your
 nice comfortable houses, 'cos when that storm hits it's gonna blow - "

 A thunderclap drowns his words, as a bolt of lightning strikes the TV
 aerial on top of your house.  You hear the sound of shattering glass,
 then an impossibly loud explosion.  Diving to the ground, you narrowly
 avoid being hit by shards of brick and burning wood.  When you get up
 and look back, you see that your house has been completely demolished.

 Yard
 You are outside your formerly ordinary house, which is now a
 smouldering pile of rubble to the east.  Clouds gather ominously in the
 sky overhead.  Maple Drive leads north and south from here, and Post
 Office Park is to the west.

 Post Office Park
 You are walking in Post Office Park, a quaint old grassy field
 extending to the road in all directions.  In the distance you can see
 the ruins of your house, a garage, some stores, the library and school,
 and of course the very new and modern Post Office Tower to the north.
 Before you, in the centre of the park, is a dingy old dribbling
 fountain.

>examine fountain
 It's disgustingly old and dingy, and hardly even dribbling.  Just
 looking at the stagnant water flow sends strange shivers of fear down
 your spine.  In the fountain you see a glowing green Magic Marker.

 green Magic Marker?

 It's green.  A message is engraved on the side:

 The Magic Marker shines with a pale green glow.

>get it
 The fountain is really icky and horrible.  As you touch the dirty water
 you feel a sudden overwhelming sense of terror which makes you draw
 back your hand in disgust.  You can hardly bring yourself to look at it
 again, let alone reach into it.

 Dark clouds roll across the sky.

 scanner.  A stack of bookshelves is lost in deep shadow, while the main
 doorway opens east out to the street.  The librarian sits behind his
 counter, reading.

 The librarian jumps to his feet as you enter, and points to something
 you're carrying.  "Get that accursed thing out of here!", he roars,
 pushing you towards the door.  "Can't you see it's a hazard to
 literacy?"

 Nytemare Video Plaza
 You are inside the new Nytemare Video Plaza.  The walls are lined with
 recent hit movies, mostly dark fantasy and thriller titles.  The clerk
 is nowhere to be seen, but a small drop box, nearly hidden behind a
 life-size cardboard cutout of an action superhero, bears the words
 RETURN VIDEOS HERE.  The door to the street opens to the southeast.

 Before your eyes, the cardboard cutout comes alive, transforming into a
 strange creature!  It seems to be part man, part machine, and all
 monster, wearing a black gangster suit and metallic sunglasses.  A
 gleam of red comes from one eye, and instead of hands it has metallic
 claws, in which it holds an arsenal of lethal weapons and a strangely
 sparking video camera.  A bright red glow surrounds it.

 The watch beeps and displays: "VIDEO NASTY".

 The Whito bottle gives a pulse of yellow light.

 The Sword of Virtue tingles in your hands.

 The Video Nasty brandishes its weapons fearsomely.

 ducks, and your blow goes wide.

 The Video Nasty yawns and tosses a grenade at you.  "Wanna play catch?"

>spray nasty with bottle
 You spray some Whito onto the Video Nasty and it begins to spark!  An
 invisible static force field generated by the video camera collapses,
 exploding in flashes of red lightning.  Finally the effect dies down,
 leaving the Video Nasty still standing.  With a VERY annoyed look in
 its eyes.

>attack nasty with sword
 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Video Nasty.  The sword's

 The Video Nasty gasps at you.  "I'm hit!  You hit me!  Arrgghh!  You'll
 never take me alive!  I'll be back!  See you in the re-runs, sucker!"
 Overacting wildly, it flips open an arm panel and pushes a secret
 button.

 The Video Nasty fades away in a blaze of yellow light!

 The watch beeps and displays: "NICE GOING".

 The Fairhaven Savings & Investment Bank has a much more sober and

 Expensively-dressed Assistant Branch Managers stride around making
 important decisions, and ignoring you.  A cash-card machine on one wall
 offers instant withdrawals, and the sleek, ultra-modern lift opens to
 the north.

 There is a very strange creature in the room.  It seems to be nothing
 more than a hat, tie and business suit floating in midair; the thing
 has no face or hands, yet somehow manages to move and act like a
 person.  A briefcase, stuffed full of papers, floats at one side.
 Despite its apparent lack of substance, the creature manages to make
 you feel insignificant.  A bright red glow surrounds it.

 This vacant lot is presumably the Oak Street Garage wrecking yard.

 Sitting on the car body is a water valve.

 is such a respectable organisation that there is absolutely no chance
 of fraud.

 Serious Fraud Suspected In Fairhaven Bank!

 Rumours are spreading that the Fairhaven Savings and Investment Bank is
 under investigation for serious fraud.  Many customers are complaining
 that their bank balances have mysteriously run into overdraft.  Bank
 officials are hotly denying the rumours, blaming them on mass hysteria
 caused by the water shortage.

 Bedlam in School!

 Teachers from the Fairhaven Public School are complaining that
 shrinking budgets and lack of resources have turned classes into a
 nightmare.  "I don't know what to say," said the teachers'
 spokesperson, Sally Knight.  "I can't control my students, and it's
 getting worse.  We need help desperately!"

 'Hydrophobia' Grows As Water Shortage Worsens!

 Fairhaven is heading into the third dry week of the longest-running
 water shortage in town history.  The Council met today to decide urgent
 solutions to the problem which has their best experts baffled.  "We
 have no idea what's happening," observed the Mayor.  "All our pumping
 equipment seems to be breaking down for no reason.  It's just plain
 bizarre."

 Feed", and it is currently turned off.  A nearby pipe is open to the
 air, and appears to be missing a valve.  The pump room door (open)
 leads up to the northwest.

 The Hydrophobia is here.  It is a huge bloated balloon of a thing,
 covered in translucent black skin, with a puffy face and watery,
 bloodshot eyes which try to focus on you with some difficulty.  The
 creature yawns and waddles drunkenly.  It is much larger than it
 appeared on your first encounter, and seems to fill the entire pump
 room.  A bright red glow surrounds it.

 The Sword of Virtue tingles in your hands.

 impressive," he sighs, "but I'm afraid it's not quite good enough.
 Come back when you've got some more experience."  He hands the card
 back regretfully.

>go east
 Outside Fairhaven Library
 You are outside the Fairhaven Library, a worn-down old brick building
 with a faded billboard outside.  A door leads in to the west.  Beech
 Avenue continues north and south of here, and you can see Post Office
 Park to the east.

 A cold wind blows briefly.

>go north
 Outside Nytemare Video
 You are on the pavement outside the Nytemare Video Plaza, one of a
 chain of stores which has moved into Fairhaven recently.  The window is
 full of movie posters, and a door leads in to the northwest.  Beech
 Avenue runs off to the south, and Elm Street to the east of here.

>go east
 Outside Post Office Tower
 You are standing outside the very new and extremely modern Post Office
 Tower, a shining monument to Fairhaven's progress, standing a full
 fifteen stories tall. You can enter the lobby to the north, or walk
 into the equally famous (though much older) Post Office Park to the
 south.  Elm Street continues east and west.

>go north
 Post Office Tower, lobby
 You are in the shining new ground-floor lobby of the Post Office Tower.
 The sheer size and architectural elegance of this room takes your
 breath away.  A plaque and call button are mounted on the north wall,
 next to the lift doors (which are open).  The grand entrance doors to
 the south lead back out to the street.

>go north
 Lift Car
 You are in the Post Office Tower's sleek, ultra-modern lift car.
 Beside the doors to the south (currently open) is a sleek, futuristic
 keypad and display.

>push 8
 (on the keypad)
 A pleasant female voice announces: "Floor 8 selected."

 The lift accelerates briefly upward, then stops.  With a soft bleep,
 the doors slide open.

>go south
 Post Office Tower, Floor 8
 The Fairhaven Savings & Investment Bank has a much more sober and
 reserved atmosphere than the rest of the Post Office Tower.
 Expensively-dressed Assistant Branch Managers stride around making
 important decisions, and ignoring you.  A cash-card machine on one wall
 offers instant withdrawals, and the sleek, ultra-modern lift opens to
 the north.

 There is a Serious Fraud here.

 The Serious Fraud murmurs that the Mayor is taking bribes.

>attack fraud
 (with the shining yellow sword)
 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Serious Fraud.  The creature
 ducks, and your blow goes wide.

 The Serious Fraud sues you for libel, slander, and wilful misguided
 heroism.

>attack fraud
 (with the shining yellow sword)
 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Serious Fraud.  The creature
 ducks, and your blow goes wide.

 The Serious Fraud hands you a High Court summons, dated yesterday.

>attack fraud
 (with the shining yellow sword)
 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Serious Fraud.  The creature
 ducks, and your blow goes wide.

 The Serious Fraud indignantly writes an angry letter to the Mayor.

 Overcome by the force of the creature's logic, you stumble from the
 room.

 The watch beeps and displays: "DONT QUIT".

 Lift Car
 You are in the Post Office Tower's sleek, ultra-modern lift car.
 Beside the doors to the south (currently open) is a sleek, futuristic
 keypad and display.

>go south
 Post Office Tower, Floor 8
 The Fairhaven Savings & Investment Bank has a much more sober and
 reserved atmosphere than the rest of the Post Office Tower.
 Expensively-dressed Assistant Branch Managers stride around making
 important decisions, and ignoring you.  A cash-card machine on one wall
 offers instant withdrawals, and the sleek, ultra-modern lift opens to
 the north.

 There is a Serious Fraud here.

 The Serious Fraud solemnly stuffs a quantity of banknotes into its
 briefcase.

>attack fraud
 (with the shining yellow sword)
 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Serious Fraud.  The sword's
 blade strikes the creature in a shower of yellow sparks!

 The Serious Fraud takes a cautious step backwards.

>attack fraud

 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Serious Fraud.  The sword's
 blade strikes the creature in a shower of yellow sparks!

 The Serious Fraud anxiously checks its suit for rips.

 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Serious Fraud.  The sword's
 blade strikes the creature in a shower of yellow sparks!

 The Serious Fraud takes a cautious step backwards.

>attack fraud
 (with the shining yellow sword)
 You swing the shining yellow sword at the Serious Fraud.

 A cold wind suddenly whips through the room, unravelling the creature's
 clothing stitch by stitch.  As the serious business suit falls into a
 heap on the floor, the air inside it begins to glow with an ominous red
 tinge.  It moulds itself into a looming, shapeless black shadow which
 fills the entire room.  Two blazing red eyes stare down at you.

 "You think you can defeat ME?"  screams the Serious Fraud's voice,
 somewhat hysterically.  "You don't know NOTHING, Hero, do ya?  I'm not
 going down alone. I got friends in high places, I got connections.
 You're dead, man!  You're dead!  You're..."

 There is a sudden explosion from the lift shaft, and then silence.  The
 shadow dissipates in a soft glow of yellow light which reluctantly
 fades.

 The watch beeps and displays: "ONE DOWN".

 Lift Car
 You are in the Post Office Tower's sleek, ultra-modern lift car.
 Beside the doors to the south (currently open) is a sleek, futuristic
 keypad and display.

>push 1
 (on the keypad)
 The keypad shorts out in a puff of sparks and electrical smoke!

 A pleasant female voice announces: "Floor 15 selected."

 The lift accelerates briefly upward, then stops.  With a soft bleep,
 the doors slide open.

>go south
 As you step out of the lift car, there is an explosion from inside and
 the doors slam shut!  You narrowly avoid being crushed!

 Post Office Tower, Observation Deck
 You are standing on the roof of the fifteen-storey Post Office Tower,
 with a breathtaking view of the entire town of Fairhaven.  A guardrail
 on the edge is all that stands between you and the Post Office Park far
 below.  High-altitude winds buffet you as you peer over.  The lift
 doors (closed) to the north are the only way down.

 Dark thunderclouds swirl menacingly overhead, and rain splatters loudly
 on the roof.

>SAVE

 Saved.

>examine thunderclouds
 For your safety and convenience, the word "thunderclouds" does not
 appear in this story.

>go north
 The lift doors are closed.

 The storm seems to be growing more intense every second.  Lightning
 arcs skywards all around you.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Huge gusts of wind and rain are making it difficult to walk upright.
 The roof seems to be sloping downwards toward the guardrail.

>examine guardrail
 It looks like an ordinary guardrail to me.

 A sudden bolt of lightning smashes into the guardrail, burning a jagged
 hole in it.  Hurricane winds hurl you off balance, pushing you closer
 to the edge.  Hail and sleet beat down on your back.

>jump
 Uh...  is that a good idea?  But before you can change your mind, a
 freak gust of wind catches you and sends you tumbling over the side of
 the roof...

 Mid-air
 You're falling in mid-air, high above the sleepy little town of
 Fairhaven.  The air is clear, the view is stunning, and you feel light,
 boyant and suprisingly peaceful, given that you're about to be
 splattered on the pavement in a few seconds.

 The suddenness of your descent takes your breath away.

>fly
 For your safety and convenience, the word "fly" does not appear in this
 story.

>yell
 Your throat is a bit sore now.

 Your cape begins to billow out in the slipstream.

>wait
 Time passes...

 You seem to be falling less swiftly now.

>wait
 Time passes...

 You drift gently down towards the Post Office Park.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Your cape puffs out like a parachute as you touch down in the middle of
 the Post Office Park.  As soon as your feet are on the ground, it folds
 away again. Hmm, wonder what else this Cape of Many Things does?

 Post Office Park
 You are walking in Post Office Park, a quaint old grassy field
 extending to the road in all directions.  In the distance you can see
 the ruins of your house, a garage, some stores, the library and school,
 and of course the very new and modern Post Office Tower to the north.
 Before you, in the centre of the park, is a clear bubbling fountain.

>examine cape
 It's a cape made of some thin transparent material that feels strangely
 light yet tougher than steel.  It sparkles with an iridescent yellow
 glow, and hugs your body like a glove, but your hands feel free and
 unencumbered.  The cape seems to attract any objects you're holding, so
 they remain within easy reach at all times.

 People scurry indoors for shelter.

>go west
 Outside Fairhaven Library
 You are outside the Fairhaven Library, a worn-down old brick building
 with a faded billboard outside.  A door leads in to the west.  Beech
 Avenue continues north and south of here, and you can see Post Office
 Park to the east.

>go west
 Fairhaven Library
 You are inside the Fairhaven library, which seems to be a refuge from
 another time.  An electric chandelier hangs from Victorian rafters,
 lighting a wooden counter on which sits a computer terminal and card
 scanner.  A stack of bookshelves is lost in deep shadow, while the main
 doorway opens east out to the street.  The librarian sits behind his
 counter, reading.

 The librarian looks up expectantly as you approach, as if waiting for
 something.

>examine card
 Which card do you mean, the cash card, or the report card?

>give it to librarian
 The librarian takes the card and examines it closely.  "Excellent," he
 announces.  "That's exactly what we need."  He pockets the card and
 stands up.  "Congratulations.  You're Hero, Inc's next lucky
 contestant."

 The old man pauses for a moment and scratches his head.  "Actually,
 you're our only contestant at the moment.  And I'm not so sure that
 you're lucky, either.  You see, this competition isn't just for fun.
 The Nytemare Corporation is moving into town.  You've probably seen the
 signs.  Well, Hero, Inc is looking for adventurers to try and stop Drac
 Thornwood and his minions.  If you fail... but we mustn't even think
 about that.  Not until it's over."

 A sudden gust of wind and rain smashes into the frail old building.
 The librarian glances up with a faint shudder.  "Yes," he murmurs.
 "Time is running out.  And now it has begun..."
