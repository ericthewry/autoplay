 "That'll be twenty five cents, Miss," says the driver as he helps you
 down from the carriage. You hand him a quarter and two nickels.

 "Mighty lonely out here this time of year," he continues, slipping the
 coins into his coat pocket. "Are you sure you won't be wanting me to
 stick around? I'd hate to see such a fine young lady get herself
 stranded, especially with that storm blowin' in."

 "Thank you, but I'll be fine," you assure him. "My fiance...," you
 start, then look away, unable to finish the lie.

 "Ah, I see," he chuckles. "Well, then I wish you a pleasant afternoon.
 Just keep your eye on those clouds, ya hear?" Grinning broadly, he
 jumps up into the driver's box and releases the brake. Then with a
 flick of the reins he sends the carriage lurching forward, back down
 the rutted road between the cypress trees.

 Finally, you're alone.

 Rocky Point
 High above the surf, Rocky Point offers a sweeping view of the western
 sea. From this lofty vantage point, looking south across a narrow
 strip of sand, you can clearly see the fractured granite cliffs that
 back the small cove below. To the north, the rugged coastline is
 dotted with offshore rocks and barren beaches, swept clear of sand by
 winter storms.

 Turning toward the sea, you take a moment to soak up the last few rays
 of sunlight before the clouds roll in.

>examine me
 You didn't mean to come here. You had packed your bags and donned your
 best dress, fully intending to uphold your end of the bargain. When
 the coach arrived and you stepped on board, you were actually looking
 forward to the journey. A chance to see new things, new people, a new
 land.

 So how did you end up here, high on this cliff, miles from the train
 station, at a place you hadn't thought about in years? You shake your
 head in amazement, the answer still eluding you.

 You find your mind drifting back over old memories of this place.

>remember
 When was the last time you where here? It must be going on six years
 now. You remember everything about that day; how lovely it was in the
 morning, how clear the skies and sea were, how much you had been
 looking foward to it. A tear forms in the corner of your eye only to
 be whisked away by a sudden gust of wind. If only memories could be as
 easily removed.

 A flock of sea gulls flies over the point and alights on the beach
 below.

>examine gulls
 Masters of the air, these snowy white and gray birds seem to float
 effortlessly near the cliff walls, sometimes coming within inches of
 each other, without moving a feather.

>examine cliff
 Rising sixty feet above the sea, the cliffs are formed from heavily
 fractured granite. Though nearly vertical is most places, a small
 portion to the south has crumbled away, creating a narrow but walkable
 route down to the beach.

 A flock of sea gulls flies over the point and alights on the beach
 below.

>exits
 There are exits to the south, to the east, to the southeast, and down.

>examine sand
 Smooth and pale, it starts at the base of the cliffs and descends
 gradually into the sea. A darker shading marks the water line, which
 is quite low right now.

 A flock of sea gulls rises from the beach, circle the cove once, then
 head out to sea.

>examine sea
 In deeper waters, outside the cove, the sea is a deep, rich blue that
 sparkles in the sunlight. But in the shallows, as the waves curl
 toward the shore, it abruptly changes to a pale translucent green and
 is covered in a fine netting of foam.

>examine foam
 The foam varies from tracings as fine as spiders web, to heavy patches
 completely obscuring the water underneath.

>examine shallows
 In deeper waters, outside the cove, the sea is a deep, rich blue that
 sparkles in the sunlight. But in the shallows, as the waves curl
 toward the shore, it abruptly changes to a pale translucent green and
 is covered in a fine netting of foam.

>examine cove
 Tucked between two granite headlands, the cove sports a gently sloping
 beach and crystal clear water. Small shore birds follow the surf up
 and down the sand. Further out, in deeper water, you can just make out
 a sea otter bobbing in a raft of kelp.

 Though a favorite spot for small fishing boats that come here seeking
 abalone, the cove is completely deserted now. Perhaps the oncoming
 storm has sent the fishermen back to the safety of their docks.

 below.

 You are carrying a purse. You are wearing an engagement ring, a silk
 dress, a pair of shoes and a pair of stockings.

 A flock of sea gulls rises from the beach, circle the cove once, then
 head out to sea.

>go down
 You hesitate, as it seems a shame to come all this way and not enjoy
 the view.

>enjoy view
 The view is always breathtaking here, but with the heavy clouds of the
 approaching storm providing a dark backdrop to the sun-drenched
 cliffs, you find it even more striking. Then again, perhaps you simply
 need it to be at its best this day.

 As you continue to gaze out at the sea, you find yourself wondering if
 England can lay claim to any place quite like this, then quickly chase
 the thought from your mind. All too soon you will find out, and there
 is little point wasting this day worrying about another.

>go down
 Lifting your skirt, you start down the cliffs, but find the soles of
 your shoes too slippery to make a safe descent.

>take off shoes
 You take off your shoes and stockings, setting them aside.

>go down
 Lifting your skirt, you carefully pick your way down to the beach
 below.

 Stepping out onto the sand, you are immediately hit with a rush of
 memories; memories of time spent clambering over these rocks, of
 splashing in the water, and of being here with Jason. You shut your
 eyes and for an instant you can almost touch the past, hold it close,
 be part of it again, and then it's gone.

 Opening your eyes, you wrap your arms around yourself and squint out
 toward the sea.

 Beach
 Surrounded by granite cliffs on three sides, this narrow strip of sand
 curves from north to south and faces a small cove to the west. With
 the tide this low, a marine terrace to the southwest lies exposed and
 accessible, though currently occupied by a large sea lion. To the
 north, the sea has dug a narrow, twisting tunnel through the headland.

 Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge
 of the surf at a quarter of the way up the beach. Additional clumps,
 dried and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of
 the cliffs -- a warning of the sea's intentions.

 A long, slender piece of driftwood lies half buried in the sand.

 A plover hurries by, ignoring you completely.

>examine plover
 The small white birds with their crisp brown markings follow the water
 up and down the beach, pecking at the sand.

 The sea lion pulls a hind flipper up and lazily scratches his side. A
 sea otter pops up amongst the kelp, and sets to work grooming its fur.
 A flock of sea gulls rises from the beach, circle the cove once, then
 head out to sea.

>examine lion
 The male sea lion is basking in the sun on the exposed marine terrace.
 Resting on his front flippers with hind ones dangling over the edge of
 the rock, he points his nose skyward as if to show off his impressive
 mane of fur. Fully seven feet long and well over 600 pounds, he is
 definitly not an animal to trifle with.

 The sea otter slips below the surface of the sea.

>wave at lion
 You look around but are unable to find that which you seek.

>twirl moustache
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>examine wood
 Six feet long and weathered to a pale gray, the piece of driftwood
 probably started life as a cypress branch.

 The sea lion pulls a hind flipper up and lazily scratches his side.
 The sea otter pops up amongst the kelp with a spiny sea urchin held
 tight between its paws. Using its stomach as a table, it quickly
 consumes its bristly meal then rolls over once to clear away the
 remains.

>take wood
 You pull the driftwood out of the sand.

>inventory
 You are carrying a piece of driftwood and a purse. You are wearing an
 engagement ring and a silk dress.

 As a wave passes by, the sea lion raises his rear flippers just high
 enough to keep them dry, then lowers them again. The sea otter rolls
 over once, and goes back to work grooming its fur. Sea gulls float by
 on the breeze, their wing tips within inches of each other.

>weigh wood
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>examine ring
 A shining band of gold. It bears the inscription "EL & AK - 1876". You
 spin it nervously about your finger, unaccustomed to its weight and
 feel.

 The sea otter swipes a thick, furry paw over its stubby furry face.

>give ring to otter
 The sea otter doesn't seem interested.

 The sea lion swings his head around to gaze at you with large brown
 eyes. Unimpressed, he soon returns to his nap. A flock of sea gulls
 rises from the beach, circle the cove once, then head out to sea. A
 few small plovers scurry up the beach, just in front of the the next
 wave.

>examine wod
 You look around but are unable to find that which you seek.

>swing wood
 You look around, but can find nothing worth swinging.

 The sea otter ruffles through the fur on its tummy. A few small
 plovers scurry up the beach, just in front of the the next wave.

>enter cave
 You mumble something incomprehensible...

>exits
 There are exits to the north, to the east, to the west, to the
 southwest, and up.

>examine cave
 You look around but are unable to find that which you seek.

>go southwest
 As you start toward the terrace, the sea lion lumbers to the edge of
 the rock and dives into the water. Surfacing again some distance from
 his former roost he barks his disapproval, then disappears into the
 sea. You stand there on the beach for several moments, staring out
 across the cove, but he does not resurface.

 Turning your attention back to the terrace, you walk out across the
 sand bar, exposed by the low tide, and clamber up onto the rock.

 Marine Terrace
 Standing in the lee of the southern cliffs, this narrow shelf of
 pitted rock has been exposed by the low tide and contains numerous
 tide pools large and small. Though the beach is still accessible to
 the east, the rest of the terrace is surrounded by sea.

 A wave strikes the western edge, showering that portion of the rock
 with a heavy spray that replenishes the tide pools.

 The leading edge of the storm clouds reaches the cove, blotting out
 the sun.

>examine pools
 You crouch down and peer into the closest one. Though its opening is
 no larger than a dinner plate, it is surprisingly deep, with many
 nooks and crannies for small creatures to hide in. Near the bottom are
 several sea anemones clustered together like undersea flowers, and a
 spiney sea urchin. Closer to the surface of the pool is a small clump
 of mussels and an assortment of limpets. Clinging to the side of the
 rock is an orange sea star.

 A flock of sea gulls flies over the point and alights on the beach
 below.

>examine star
 It has five fat legs and a central core nearly as wide as your palm.

 Sea gulls float by on the breeze, their wing tips within inches of
 each other.

>examine limpets
 Clustered together on the rocks, they look like tiny volcanoes about
 ready to blow.

>lick limpet
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>get star
 You pull the sea star off the rocks and hold it gently in your hand.

>examine
 What do you want to examine?

>look

 This was always one of your favorite spots, especially on a hot day
 when the spray was always quite refreshing.

>feel spray
 You feel nothing unexpected.

 A sea gull's strident call echos off the cliffs.

>swim
 You sigh wistfully, wishing you knew how.

>sigh
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>go east
 You find it impossible to safely climb down the rocks while cradling
 the sea star in your hands.

 The sea otter pops up amongst the kelp with a spiny sea urchin held
 tight between its paws. Using its stomach as a table, it quickly
 consumes its bristly meal then rolls over once to clear away the
 remains. A sea gull's strident call echos off the cliffs.

>give star to otter
 You find you haven't the heart to pester the sea star.

>drop star
 You toss the sea star into the sea, where it quickly sinks below the
 surface.

 The sea otter swipes a thick, furry paw over its stubby furry face. A
 sea gull's strident call echos off the cliffs.

>go east
 You climb over the edge and scramble across the sandbar to the beach,
 apparently just in time as a particularly large wave crashes into the
 terrace sending a foot of water shooting all the way across its
 surface.


 Beach
 Surrounded by cliffs on three sides, this narrow strip of sand curves
 from north to south and faces a small cove to the west. With the tide
 half in, the marine terrace to the southwest is beginning to take on
 water. To the north, the sea has dug a narrow, twisting tunnel through
 the headland.

 Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge
 of the surf at about half way up the beach. Additional clumps, dried
 and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of the
 cliffs; a warning of the sea's intentions.

 The clouds close ranks overhead, blotting out the sun completely and
 turning the sea from blue to gray. Outside the cove the wind is
 beginning to kick up whitecaps and push the swells up even further up
 the shore.

>take seaweed
 You can't actually bring yourself to touch the rotting seaweed.

 The sea otter ruffles through the fur on its tummy.

>greet otter
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>otter, hi
 The sea otter ignores you completely.

 You hear, more than feel, the first few hesitant drops of rain as they
 strike against the stones and create tiny craters in the sand. Moments
 later the storm catches its stride and it begins to rain in earnest.

>pet otter.
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>pet otter
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>go south
 After a moments thought, you realize that you can't go that way.

 You turn your face aside in a futile attempt to avoid the rain.

>inventory
 You are carrying a piece of driftwood and a purse. You are wearing an
 engagement ring and a silk dress.

 You pass your hands over your face to clear the rain away.

>remove dress
 As you go to remove the silk dress, a chilling wind causes you to
 think better of it.

 The rain runs down your neck in rivulets.

>hold purse over head
 Your voice trails off after saying you were wanting to hold the purse.

>throw ring in sea
 (first taking it off)

 You stare at the ring, suprised to find yourself reluctant to remove
 it. It's not like it means anything to you, not really. In fact, you
 hardly know the gentleman to whom it holds you bound. Still, as it is
 a costly thing, far more than you can afford to replace at the moment,
 and as you have little doubt that its true owner would expect every
 last penny of it reimbursed, you decide to leave it where it is.

 You turn your face aside in a futile attempt to avoid the rain.

>open purse
 You loosen the shimmering gold cord, opening the purse. Inside the
 open purse you see a faded white rose bud.

 You turn your face aside in a futile attempt to avoid the rain.

>examine bud
 It was as white as snow when you slipped it from the bouquet six years
 ago, though it soon dried to a dingy yellow brown and became so
 brittle that you had to tuck it away in a cigar box for safe keeping.
 There it laid, alone and forgotten, until today when you pulled it out
 and placed it in your purse, unwilling to leave it behind, no room
 remaining to put it anywhere else.

 You turn your face aside in a futile attempt to avoid the rain.

 cliffs; a warning of the sea's intentions.

 The rain runs down your neck in rivulets.

>go west
 Gathering up your skirt, you walk down the beach and gingerly step
 into the sea. Unfortunately it's quite cold and your ankles
 immediately start to ache. So after giving a few kicks in the water
 for old time's sake, you find you are forced to retreat back up to dry
 sand.

 You turn your face aside in a futile attempt to avoid the rain.

>go north
 You glance at the tunnel's entrance, narrow and twisting with a low
 ceiling, and conclude the piece of driftwood is simply too big to fit
 through it.

 The rain runs down your neck in rivulets.

>drop wood
 You drop the driftwood on the ground.

 You turn your face aside in a futile attempt to avoid the rain.

>go north
 You eye the still dry tunnel nervously. Carved by wind and waves, the
 sea tunnel burrows through the headland about half the way up the
 beach. It is unreachable when the tide is high, both to those wanting
 in... and out. And in your childhood dreams you often found yourself
 trapped inside as the waves grew ever higher, your screams for help
 being carried out to sea. Moments later the water would come rushing
 through the tunnel and do the same to you.

 You  glance up at the clouds. Though it's pouring rain now, it seems
 the clouds are thinning to the west. Perhaps this will all blow over
 soon, but until it does there is nowhere else dry to go. So summoning
 your courage, you dash between the waves, scramble up the rocks, and
 enter the tunnel.

 Tunnel's Entrance
 The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks southward across the beach
 and to the granite cliffs beyond. From here, by craning your head
 around the rocks to the east, you are just able to make out the tips
 of the cypress trees, looking like ghostly shadows as the clouds pass
 by.

 Waves rolling in from the west tumble over the rocks below, sending up
 a heavy shower of spray and then move on.

 After a few moments it becomes clear that this spot offers little in
 the way of protection from the driving rain, and the cold sea spray is
 actually making things worse. As fears of the past are swept away by
 the realities of the present, you make your way further into the
 tunnel, squeezing past its narrowest point, then hurrying on to the
 northern end.

 Tunnel's End
 The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to
 the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough
 light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures
 in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that
 makes the footing treacherous.

 Near the opening, half covered in algae, is a flattened stone standing
 somewhat apart from the rest.

>examine stone
 You scrap off the algae from the flattened stone, revealing a heavily
 eroded outline of a heart cut into the rock. Inside the heart, carved
 in a childish hand, is the faded inscription "JS & AK". A lump forms
 in your throat and you swallow hard, trying in vain to shut your mind
 on old memories, still painful to recall.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up
 high into the air. You watch as the rest of the wave continues its
 course toward the coast, past jagged offshore rocks jutting up from
 the sea, only to die upon the barren shore.

>inventory
 You are carrying a purse (which is open), inside which is a faded
 white rose bud. You are wearing an engagement ring and a silk dress.

 The skies open up and it begins to pour, sending water streaming down
 the sides of the tunnel and splattering against you no matter where
 you stand.

>remember
 You remember back to the last time you were here, six long years ago.
 It seems like yesterday. You almost expect to see Jason come running
 through the tunnel, hair tossled by the wind. "Hey Amy," he would say,
 "look what I found!" Then he'd open his hand and show you some small
 treasure from the sea. They were worthless, they were beautiful, and
 they always made you smile. He always made you smile.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>climb
 What do you want to climb?

>climb rocks
 You curl your fingers around the pitted stone and start a slow ascent
 of the rock wall. But after just a foot or two you find yourself out
 of hand holds, with the rock curving ever more over your head. You
 hang there for a moment, fingers aching, then drop back down to the
 tunnel floor.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up
 high into the air.

>touch barnacles
 You find the larger scales near the end of the barnacle to be smooth
 to the touch, but the stalk is covered in tiny spines.

>look

 Tunnel's End

>examine algae
 Mostly deep green, though some patches are nearly black while others
 are a deep shade of red.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up
 high into the air.

>sit on stone
 After a moment's thought, you decide the flattened stone isn't
 something you can sit on.

>go down
 You examine the ground closely, finding it perfectly solid and quite
 impenetrable.

>take flat rock
 Your voice trails off after saying you were wanting to take the
 flattened stone.

>take flat
 You find the flattened stone to be one with the tunnel.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up
 high into the air.

>go south
 Holding your breath, you turn sideways and squeeze past the tunnel's
 narrowest point to check on the tide. Finding the way to the beach
 still free, but not anxious to go back out into the rain, you
 reluctantly return to the northern end of the tunnel where you can
 stay somewhat drier.

>get pneumonia
 You look around but are unable to find that which you seek.

>exits
 There are exits to the south and up.

>go up
 You curl your fingers around the pitted stone and start a slow ascent
 of the rock wall. But after just a foot or two you find yourself out

 Though probably solid at one point, it has collapsed near the end and
 allows in a fair amount of light.

>remember up
 Your voice trails off after saying you were wanting to remember.

>wait
 You pause for a moment of silent reflection.

>dig
 You glance at the ground but it seems much to solid to dig through.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up
 high into the air. You watch as the rest of the wave continues its
 course toward the coast, past jagged offshore rocks jutting up from

 A bizarre number floats through your mind, and then is gone.

 dragged down to the bottom by the current and the weight of your
 lovely silk dress.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up

 A shining band of gold. It bears the inscription "EL & AK - 1876". You

>throw ring into sea
 (first taking it off)

 You stare at the ring, suprised to find yourself reluctant to remove
 it. It's not like it means anything to you, not really. In fact, you
 hardly know the gentleman to whom it holds you bound. Still, as it is
 a costly thing, far more than you can afford to replace at the moment,
 and as you have little doubt that its true owner would expect every
 last penny of it reimbursed, you decide to leave it where it is.

 You are carrying a purse (which is open), inside which is a faded
 white rose bud. You are wearing an engagement ring and a silk dress.

 You contemplating eating, but find you aren't hungry for an engagement
 ring.

>examine dress
 While not at all appropriate for visiting the beach, the emerald green
 and white stripped silk dress with its solid green overshirt,
 tastefully bustled, is just the thing for going visiting - or going
 away - which is exactly what you should be doing right now. The silk
 dress is soaked.

>shake
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

 As you go to remove the silk dress, a chilling wind causes you to
 think better of it.

 Tunnel's End
 The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to
 the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough
 light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures
 in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that
 makes the footing treacherous.

 Near the opening is a flattened stone standing somewhat apart from the
 rest.

 You need to be holding the faded white rose bud before you can put it

>out
 You blush when you realize that you aren't actually in anything.

>go south
 Holding your breath, you turn sideways and squeeze past the tunnel's
 narrowest point to check on the tide. Finding the way to the beach
 still free, but not anxious to go back out into the rain, you
 reluctantly return to the northern end of the tunnel where you can
 stay somewhat drier.

>go up
 You curl your fingers around the pitted stone and start a slow ascent
 of the rock wall. But after just a foot or two you find yourself out
 of hand holds, with the rock curving ever more over your head. You
 hang there for a moment, fingers aching, then drop back down to the
 tunnel floor.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up

 You take the faded white rose bud out of the purse.

 You gently kiss the faded blossom then toss it out onto the sea. "Rest
 in peace, Jason," you whisper as you watch it bob upon the water.
 Moments later it's caught up in the churning waves and pulled beneath
 the surface.

 "Amelia!" comes a cry from far above, barely audible over a sudden
 rush of water to the south. How long have you been in here? Looking up
 toward the cliffs you are surprised to see a familiar coach and four
 standing precariously close to the edge.

 "Ethan, get the horses back," you yell, cupping your hands around your
 mouth in a futile attempt to be heard. How did he know where to find
 you?

 "Amelia!" comes the cry again, this time more frantic.

 Tunnel's End
 The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to

 Near the opening is a flattened stone standing somewhat apart from the

>go south

 Tunnel's Entrance
 The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks out upon the beach, or what
 is left of it, for the tide has come in so far that some of the larger
 waves are spilling over the small rocks at the base of the cliffs.

 Your voice trails off after saying you were wanting to remember.

>go south
 Standing at the edge of the tunnel, peering down at the sea as it
 surges past, you quickly realize the only way out this direction is to
 jump.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up
 high into the air. You watch as the rest of the wave continues its
 course toward the shore.

>SAVE
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go north
 Holding your breath, you turn sideways and squeeze past the tunnel's
 narrowest point, then hurry on to its northern end with the sea
 lapping at your heels.

 "Ethan, I'm here!" you scream as a wave enters the southern end of the
 tunnel, sweeping over your feet and pour out the northern end.

 Tunnel's End
 The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to

>stand on stone
 After a moment's thought, you decide the flattened stone isn't
 something you can stand on.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up
 high into the air. You watch as the rest of the wave continues its
 course toward the coast, past jagged offshore rocks jutting up from

>go up
 Just as you did six years before, you curl your finger around the
 pitted stone and attempt to haul yourself up the rocks. But this time
 Jason isn't there to push you the rest of the way up, and you slide
 back down.

 While you are preparing to try again, your hand is hit by a sturdy
 strap of leather tossed down from above.

 "Amelia, grab the rein," calls Ethan, his voice barely audible over
 the sound of the waves.

 Wrapping the rein around your hand, you once again scramble up the
 rocks. A moment later you find yourself standing on the rim of the
 tunnel, caught up in Ethans arms as he wraps his thick black cloak
 around you. Another wave sweeps through the tunnel at your feet,
 sending a shower of spray up high above your head. But the sea has no
 power over you now. This time there is no one left behind for it to
 claim.

 "That'll be twenty five cents, Miss," says the driver as he helps you
 down from the carriage. You hand him a quarter and two nickels.

 "Mighty lonely out here this time of year," he continues, slipping the
 coins into his coat pocket. "Are you sure you won't be wanting me to
 stick around? I'd hate to see such a fine young lady get herself
 stranded, especially with that storm blowin' in."

 "Thank you, but I'll be fine," you assure him. "My fiance...," you
 start, then look away, unable to finish the lie.

 "Ah, I see," he chuckles. "Well, then I wish you a pleasant afternoon.
 Just keep your eye on those clouds, ya hear?" Grinning broadly, he
 jumps up into the driver's box and releases the brake. Then with a
 flick of the reins he sends the carriage lurching forward, back down
 the rutted road between the cypress trees.

 Finally, you're alone.

 Rocky Point
 High above the surf, Rocky Point offers a sweeping view of the western
 sea. From this lofty vantage point, looking south across a narrow
 strip of sand, you can clearly see the fractured granite cliffs that
 back the small cove below. To the north, the rugged coastline is
 dotted with offshore rocks and barren beaches, swept clear of sand by
 winter storms.

 Turning toward the sea, you take a moment to soak up the last few rays
 of sunlight before the clouds roll in.

>remember
 When was the last time you where here? It must be going on six years
 now. You remember everything about that day; how lovely it was in the
 morning, how clear the skies and sea were, how much you had been
 looking foward to it. A tear forms in the corner of your eye only to
 be whisked away by a sudden gust of wind. If only memories could be as
 easily removed.

>examine sea
 In deeper waters, outside the cove, the sea is a deep, rich blue that
 sparkles in the sunlight. But in the shallows, as the waves curl
 toward the shore, it abruptly changes to a pale translucent green and
 is covered in a fine netting of foam.

>exits
 There are exits to the south, to the east, to the southeast, and down.

 A flock of sea gulls rises from the beach and flies off into the
 clouds.

>examine gulls
 Masters of the air, these snowy white and gray birds seem to float
 effortlessly near the cliff walls, sometimes coming within inches of
 each other, without moving a feather.

>score
 You have so far scored 2 out of a possible 28, in 5 turns.

>se
 You turn your back on the sea, beginning the long dusty walk back to
 the city.

>enjoy view
 The view is always breathtaking here, but with the heavy clouds of the
 approaching storm providing a dark backdrop to the sun-drenched
 cliffs, you find it even more striking. Then again, perhaps you simply
 need it to be at its best this day.

 As you continue to gaze out at the sea, you find yourself wondering if
 England can lay claim to any place quite like this, then quickly chase
 the thought from your mind. All too soon you will find out, and there
 is little point wasting this day worrying about another.

 Your voice trails off after saying you were wanting to call.

>whistle
 You mutter something incomprehensible.

>go south
 Lifting your skirt, you start down the cliffs, but find the soles of
 your shoes too slippery to make a safe descent.

 The sea gulls stay far out of reach.

 You are carrying a purse. You are wearing an engagement ring, a silk
 dress, a pair of shoes and a pair of stockings.

 You take off your shoes and stockings, setting them aside.

 Lifting your skirt, you carefully pick your way down to the beach
 below.

 Stepping out onto the sand, you are immediately hit with a rush of
 memories; memories of time spent clambering over these rocks, of
 splashing in the water, and of being here with Jason. You shut your
 eyes and for an instant you can almost touch the past, hold it close,
 be part of it again, and then it's gone.

 Opening your eyes, you wrap your arms around yourself and squint out
 toward the sea.

 Beach
 Surrounded by granite cliffs on three sides, this narrow strip of sand
 curves from north to south and faces a small cove to the west. With
 the tide this low, a marine terrace to the southwest lies exposed and
 accessible, though currently occupied by a large sea lion. To the
 north, the sea has dug a narrow, twisting tunnel through the headland.

 Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge
 of the surf at a quarter of the way up the beach. Additional clumps,
 dried and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of
 the cliffs -- a warning of the sea's intentions.

 A long, slender piece of driftwood lies half buried in the sand.

>examine driftwood
 Six feet long and weathered to a pale gray, the piece of driftwood
 probably started life as a cypress branch.

 The sea lion swings his head around to gaze at you with large brown
 eyes. Unimpressed, he soon returns to his nap. A sea otter pops up
 amongst the kelp, and sets to work grooming its fur. Sea gulls float
 by on the breeze, their wing tips within inches of each other.

>remember
 Your memories are of happy times, of playing in the sea and on the
 sand. All happy times, save one. You swallow hard and push those
 thoughts away. Your time here is too short, too precious, to spend it
 on things you can not change, whether they be in the past or in the
 future.

 The sea lion pulls a hind flipper up and lazily scratches his side.
 The sea otter slips below the surface of the sea. A sea gull's
 strident call echos off the cliffs.

>examine lion
 The male sea lion is basking in the sun on the exposed marine terrace.
 Resting on his front flippers with hind ones dangling over the edge of
 the rock, he points his nose skyward as if to show off his impressive
 mane of fur. Fully seven feet long and well over 600 pounds, he is
 definitly not an animal to trifle with.

>examine otter
 You look around but are unable to find that which you seek.

 The sea lion swings his head around to gaze at you with large brown

 scurry up the beach, just in front of the the next wave.

>examine plover
 The small white birds with their crisp brown markings follow the water
 up and down the beach, pecking at the sand.

 The sea lion pulls a hind flipper up and lazily scratches his side.
 The sea otter pops up amongst the kelp with a spiny sea urchin held
 tight between its paws. Using its stomach as a table, it quickly
 consumes its bristly meal then rolls over once to clear away the
 remains.

>examine urchin
 You look around but are unable to find that which you seek.

>examine sea urchin
 Your voice trails off after saying you were wanting to examine the
 sea.

>examine otter
 Bobbing amidst a raft of kelp, the sea otter busily grooms its fur
 with thick stubby paws. After every few swipes it rolls completely
 over, then begins to groom again.

 As a wave passes by, the sea lion raises his rear flippers just high
 enough to keep them dry, then lowers them again.

>examine kelp
 Ripped from their holdfasts during heavy seas, the long strands of
 seaweed are pushed along by wind and tides until they are at last
 flung up upon the shore. There they form tangled mophead heaps, a
 haven for the small flies, crabs, and the like who feed upon the
 decaying fronds.

 A flock of sea gulls rises from the beach and flies off into the
 clouds. A long legged plover chases after the waves, pecking at the
 sand as it goes.

 You find nothing of interest.

 The sea otter swipes a thick, furry paw over its stubby furry face.
 Plovers follow the water up and down the beach, pecking at the sand.

>examine flies
 The annoying little flies buzz continually amongst the piles of
 beached kelp and within inches of the sand.

 A small group of plovers pokes about the sea weed.

>examine crabs
 About two inches long and nearly as round, the purple crab has a
 lovely deep purple shell and a pair of pale lavender pinchers covered
 in small purple spots.

 A small group of plovers pokes about the sea weed.

>eat crab
 Just looking at the crabs is enough to make your mouth water, though
 these little fellows are too small to make much of a meal.

 The sea otter rolls over once, and goes back to work grooming its fur.
 Plovers follow the water up and down the beach, pecking at the sand.

>eat plover
 You idly wonder if plovers taste anything like chicken, but realize
 you have little chance of catching one to find out.

 As a wave passes by, the sea lion raises his rear flippers just high
 enough to keep them dry, then lowers them again.

>eat otter
 You grimace at the thought.

 The sea lion pulls a hind flipper up and lazily scratches his side.

>eat lion
 You grimace at the thought.

>hit lion with wood
 (first taking the driftwood)
 You pull the driftwood out of the sand.

 The sea otter rolls over once, and goes back to work grooming its fur.

>hit lion
 With surprising speed, the sea lion lumbers to the edge of the rock
 and dives into the water. Surfacing again some distance from his
 former roost he barks his disapproval, then disappears into the sea.

 With the tide low, you are able to walk out across the narrow sand bar

 Marine Terrace
 Standing in the lee of the southern cliffs, this narrow shelf of
 pitted rock has been exposed by the low tide and contains numerous
 tide pools large and small. Though the beach is still accessible to
 the east, the rest of the terrace is surrounded by sea.

 A wave strikes the western edge, showering that portion of the rock
 with a heavy spray that replenishes the tide pools.

 The leading edge of the storm clouds reaches the cove, blotting out
 the sun.

 A flock of sea gulls rises from the beach and flies off into the

>examine tide pools
 You crouch down and peer into the closest one. Though its opening is
 no larger than a dinner plate, it is surprisingly deep, with many
 nooks and crannies for small creatures to hide in. Near the bottom are
 several sea anemones clustered together like undersea flowers, and a
 spiney sea urchin. Closer to the surface of the pool is a small clump
 of mussels and an assortment of limpets. Clinging to the side of the
 rock is an orange sea star.

>examine anenome
 You look around but are unable to find that which you seek.

>examine anemone
 Looking like an exotic flower, the anemone's numerous inch long
 tenticles move almost imperceptably beneath the still water of the
 tide pool.

>examine mussels
 Gray near the base, turning black at the tips, the mussles are
 actually quite pretty... as well as being very tasty.

>examine urchin
 You find it hard to believe that something so spiny can actually be
 alive.

 Sea gulls float by on the breeze, their wing tips within inches of
 each other.

>touch urchin
 You find you haven't the heart to pester the sea urchin.

>examine limpets
 Clustered together on the rocks, they look like tiny volcanoes about
 ready to blow.

 The only obvious exit is to the east.

 You loosen the shimmering gold cord, opening the purse. Inside the
 open purse you see a faded white rose bud.

>examine bud
 It was as white as snow when you slipped it from the bouquet six years
 ago, though it soon dried to a dingy yellow brown and became so
 brittle that you had to tuck it away in a cigar box for safe keeping.
 There it laid, alone and forgotten, until today when you pulled it out
 and placed it in your purse, unwilling to leave it behind, no room
 remaining to put it anywhere else.

 A flock of sea gulls flies over the point and alights on the beach
 below.

>take star
 You pull the sea star off the rocks and hold it gently in your hand.

>put star in purse
 You find you haven't the heart to pester the sea star.

>throw star
 You toss the sea star into the sea, where it quickly sinks below the
 surface.

>take all
 There are none at all available!

 Your voice trails off after saying you were wanting to remember.

>go east
 You climb over the edge and scramble across the sandbar to the beach,
 apparently just in time as a particularly large wave crashes into the
 terrace sending a foot of water shooting all the way across its
 surface.


 Beach
 Surrounded by cliffs on three sides, this narrow strip of sand curves
 from north to south and faces a small cove to the west. With the tide
 half in, the marine terrace to the southwest is beginning to take on
 water. To the north, the sea has dug a narrow, twisting tunnel through
 the headland.

 Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge
 of the surf at about half way up the beach. Additional clumps, dried
 and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of the
 cliffs; a warning of the sea's intentions.

 The clouds close ranks overhead, blotting out the sun completely and
 turning the sea from blue to gray. Outside the cove the wind is
 beginning to kick up whitecaps and push the swells up even further up
 the shore.

 Your memories are of happy times, of playing in the sea and on the
 sand. All happy times, save one. You swallow hard and push those
 thoughts away. Your time here is too short, too precious, to spend it
 on things you can not change, whether they be in the past or in the
 future.

>go southwest
 Raising your skirt to your knees, you wade through the shallow water
 that now covering the sand bar and gingerly step up onto the terrace.
 Moments later a large wave crashes over its northern end, sending you
 scurrying back up on the beach as the entire rock briefly disappears
 under a thick layer of foam and water.

 You hear, more than feel, the first few hesitant drops of rain as they
 strike against the stones and create tiny craters in the sand. Moments
 later the storm catches its stride and it begins to rain in earnest.

 You crouch down and peer into the closest one. Though its opening is
 no larger than a dinner plate, it is surprisingly deep, with many
 nooks and crannies for small creatures to hide in. Near the bottom are
 several sea anemones clustered together like undersea flowers, and a
 spiney sea urchin. Closer to the surface of the pool is a small clump
 of mussels and an assortment of limpets.

 Clustered together on the rocks, they look like tiny volcanoes about

 You stare at the ring, suprised to find yourself reluctant to remove
 it. It's not like it means anything to you, not really. In fact, you
 hardly know the gentleman to whom it holds you bound. Still, as it is
 a costly thing, far more than you can afford to replace at the moment,
 and as you have little doubt that its true owner would expect every
 last penny of it reimbursed, you decide to leave it where it is.

 Beach
 Surrounded by cliffs on three sides, this narrow strip of sand curves
 from north to south and faces a small cove to the west. With the tide
 half in, the marine terrace to the southwest is beginning to take on
 water. To the north, the sea has dug a narrow, twisting tunnel through
 the headland.

 Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge
 of the surf at about half way up the beach. Additional clumps, dried
 and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of the
 cliffs; a warning of the sea's intentions.

 The clouds close ranks overhead, blotting out the sun completely and
 turning the sea from blue to gray. Outside the cove the wind is
 beginning to kick up whitecaps and push the swells up even further up
 the shore.

>remember
 Your memories are of happy times, of playing in the sea and on the
 sand. All happy times, save one. You swallow hard and push those
 thoughts away. Your time here is too short, too precious, to spend it
 on things you can not change, whether they be in the past or in the
 future.

 You can't actually bring yourself to touch the rotting seaweed.

 You hear, more than feel, the first few hesitant drops of rain as they

>go north
 You eye the still dry tunnel nervously. Carved by wind and waves, the
 sea tunnel burrows through the headland about half the way up the
 beach. It is unreachable when the tide is high, both to those wanting
 in... and out. And in your childhood dreams you often found yourself
 trapped inside as the waves grew ever higher, your screams for help
 being carried out to sea. Moments later the water would come rushing
 through the tunnel and do the same to you.

 You  glance up at the clouds. Though it's pouring rain now, it seems
 the clouds are thinning to the west. Perhaps this will all blow over
 soon, but until it does there is nowhere else dry to go. So summoning
 your courage, you dash between the waves, scramble up the rocks, and
 enter the tunnel.

 Tunnel's Entrance
 The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks southward across the beach
 and to the granite cliffs beyond. From here, by craning your head
 around the rocks to the east, you are just able to make out the tips
 of the cypress trees, looking like ghostly shadows as the clouds pass
 by.

 Waves rolling in from the west tumble over the rocks below, sending up
 a heavy shower of spray and then move on.

 After a few moments it becomes clear that this spot offers little in
 the way of protection from the driving rain, and the cold sea spray is
 actually making things worse. As fears of the past are swept away by
 the realities of the present, you make your way further into the
 tunnel, squeezing past its narrowest point, then hurrying on to the
 northern end.

 Tunnel's End
 The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to
 the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough
 light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures
 in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that
 makes the footing treacherous.

 Near the opening, half covered in algae, is a flattened stone standing
 somewhat apart from the rest.

 You remember back to the last time you were here, six long years ago.
 It seems like yesterday. You almost expect to see Jason come running
 through the tunnel, hair tossled by the wind. "Hey Amy," he would say,
 "look what I found!" Then he'd open his hand and show you some small
 treasure from the sea. They were worthless, they were beautiful, and
 they always made you smile. He always made you smile.

 A wave crashes against the rocks below sending a shower of spray up

 Mostly deep green, though some patches are nearly black while others
 are a deep shade of red.

 The skies open up and it begins to pour, sending water streaming down

 Holding your breath, you turn sideways and squeeze past the tunnel's

 still free, but not anxious to go back out into the rain, you
 reluctantly return to the northern end of the tunnel where you can
 stay somewhat drier.

 This game was written as a Landscape/Scenery entry for the Interactive
 Fiction Art Show. Almost all nouns in the text should be fair game for
 examining, with the other senses (listen, touch, taste, smell)
 supplied when I thought it was appropriate. Although the number of
 takeable objects has been kept to a minimum as per the rules of the
 show, there are a few so feel free to try it.

 Note: Players might find it useful to REMEMBER from time to time,
 especially at changes in scenery or situation.

 Though I set out to make it plotless, I quickly realized I couldn't
 write that way. We all approach a scene with our own set of memories,
 likes, dislikes, etc., and the PC (player character - you) is no
 different. As soon as I created a particular PC to be viewing these
 things, a plot crept in, and with a plot came a puzzle or two. They
 aren't meant to be confusing, and I hope you don't find them to be so.

 I want to acknowledge all those who have given help to me in the past;
 Andrew Plotkin, Gareth Rees, Marnie Parker, Magnus Olsen, Adam Cadre
 (for flags.h), Graham Nelson (for Inform, the language this is written
 in)... I wish I had kept better records so I could list you all. And
 to my husband, who gracefully accepted being a computer widower most
 of the time, and wisely dragged me away from the keyboard the rest of
 the time.

 A very special thank you to Irene Callaci, who, for the past year and
 half has been the reason I have kept writing every day, both recently
 on this little game, and on my REAL game (still in progress). Her
 daily question of: "So, what did you do last night?" and her limitless
 patience analyzing the answer, has kept me going though dreadful bugs
 and writers block, bad plots and worse writing. She has been as free
 with her wonderful ideas as with her code, and she is entirely to
 blame for the fact that I finally finished a game.

 Along with Irene, Jim Aikin and David Glasser and David Myers agreed
 to subject themselves to a beta version of this game, and all
 dutifully (gleefully?) reported my grammatical blunders, persistant
 failure to correctly use Mr. Apostrophe, repetitious code, plot holes,
 RAM errors (Read-Authors-Mind) and the like. Many thanks!

 Finally, I should note that as this is my first (released) game, I
 would dearly love to hear any thoughts/questions/opinions/suggestions
 you might have. I can be reached at mfischer5@aol.com or you can post
 to rec.arts.int-fiction or rec.games.int-fiction (the former for
 programming issues, the later for game play).

 You gently kiss the faded blossom then toss it out onto the sea. "Rest
 in peace, Jason," you whisper as you watch it bob upon the water.
 Moments later it's caught up in the churning waves and pulled beneath
 the surface.

 "Amelia!" comes a cry from far above, barely audible over a sudden
 rush of water to the south. How long have you been in here? Looking up
 toward the cliffs you are surprised to see a familiar coach and four
 standing precariously close to the edge.

 "Ethan, get the horses back," you yell, cupping your hands around your
 mouth in a futile attempt to be heard. How did he know where to find
 you?

 "Amelia!" comes the cry again, this time more frantic.

 It's happening all over again, just like before, only this time Jason
 isn't here to help. What was he trying to tell you that day? You never
 could figure it out. The wind had been so strong, ripping the words
 out of his mouth and blowing them away. He finally grabbed your hand
 and gave it a squeeze, pointing up toward the narrow gap in the
 ceiling. You look up at the ceiling now, the gap seeming as
 unreachable as ever.

 Just as you did six years before, you curl your finger around the
 pitted stone and attempt to haul yourself up the rocks. But this time
 Jason isn't there to push you the rest of the way up, and you slide
 back down.

 While you are preparing to try again, your hand is hit by a sturdy
 strap of leather tossed down from above.

 "Amelia, grab the rein," calls Ethan, his voice barely audible over
 the sound of the waves.

 Wrapping the rein around your hand, you once again scramble up the
 rocks. A moment later you find yourself standing on the rim of the
 tunnel, caught up in Ethans arms as he wraps his thick black cloak
 around you. Another wave sweeps through the tunnel at your feet,
 sending a shower of spray up high above your head. But the sea has no
 power over you now. This time there is no one left behind for it to
 claim.
