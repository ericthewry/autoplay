 Book and Volume
 by Nick Montfort

 Release 8, 2005-12-25
 Written in Inform 6.30 with library 6/11

 I greatly appreciate the help I've received from the interactive
 fiction community (particularly those who have discussed IF with me on
 ifMUD), the broader electronic literature community, and my literary
 collaborators. Thanks to all the authors, players, poets, reviewers,
 and others who have led me to think about writing, computing, and
 interactive fiction in new ways.

 Book and Volume was written in Inform, a language for IF development
 created by Graham Nelson. It runs on the Z-Machine, a software
 computer developed by Joel Berez and Marc Blank.

 I particularly want to thank the following people, who played
 pre-release versions of Book and Volume and who offered their thoughts
 and transcripts:

 Ian Bogost
 Jeremy Douglass
 Josh Kellar
 Ryan McDonald
 Scott Rettberg
 Dan Shiovitz
 Emily Short
 Dirk Stratton
 Jill Walker
 Hanna Wallach
 Noah Wardrip-Fruin

 Thanks to Andrew Suffield, Brian Rapp, Jose Manuel Garcia, Brian Kerr,
 Jeremy Rogers, and Andrew Plotkin for post-release bug reports.

 Also, I'm very grateful that I was given the opportunity to read from
 pre-release versions of Book and Volume at The Richard Stockton
 College, at The Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania,
 and at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the
 University of Maryland.

 Finally, thanks go to these Philadelphia coffeehouses, in which much
 of Book and Volume was written: Intermezzo, Crimson Moon, Capriccio,
 and The Last Drop.

 Your pager tickles you awake.

 Upstairs in the house of your childhood, in your room, and it must be
 time for school because -- no, it's the weekend, you remember, but
 your alarm is going off anyway. You should have been awake already.
 You're going to miss the bus. Your mother climbs in the window. You're
 dreaming.

 You're a grown-up: It opens to you again, a sluggish window summoned
 by a mouse click. Waking up now in your own apartment, your new
 apartment. Your pager is buzzing and vibrating both, serious. It is in
 fact the weekend, but you're not in elementary school. No one is
 crawling in through the window. You're a system administrator for
 nWare. Waking up urgently, here in nTopia.




 Home
 The constellations on the ceiling are as you left them: Pisces, Cetus,
 Aquarius, and the ones without celestial referent, left by some crazed
 astronomer in residence here before you. What could you call them? The
 Cradle, The Way, The Burning Book...

 They're still glowing, too. Must not have napped for long.

>examine pisces
 If your milky memories of astronomy class serve, the glow-in-the-dark
 stars seem not just slapped on at random but willfully misconfigured.
 They lend the place some sort of character, though an Escher poster
 would be hip in comparison.

 The pager buzzes and jars you, its motor driven to disrupt and demand
 attention. This is no Harry Potter broomstick.

>get up
 You get off the couch.

 The pager vibrates like it's repeatedly tapping you to get your
 attention, and it buzzes gratingly.

>answer pager
 You can't help but listen to the buzzing. As for listening to
 messages, you usually do that by manipulating the pager's elegant user
 interface.

 The buzzing of the pager continues. You are tooth to the dental drill
 of the device.

>examine pager
 It's too dark too see, like inside of a dog.

 MUEAAAAAHA THE PAGER THE PAGER THE PAGER MAKE IT STOP

>examine pager
 It's too dark too see, like inside of a dog.

 You return to lucidity for what is going to be a very brief moment,
 unless you make the pager stop buzzing and vibrating.

>turn on light
 You switch the light on.

 THE PAGER IT HURTS US IT HURTS US AAAAAHEHEHEE

 Home
 Although almost unfurnished, since you've been here only a few days
 and haven't had time to settle in, the place is more Fight Club than
 Shade: young, urbane, professional. It's yours, though. It's your
 residential canister. Your lime-green couch is against the longest
 wall. And it looks like we also have your nLap 500 and a heap of
 clothes.

>examine pager
 Cell phones are ubiquitous in nTopia, and your pager is a sort of
 funky, retro sheriff's badge among them. Press the gray button there,
 and any voice messages you have will play; hold the button to erase
 them. The vibration and buzzing mean that an urgent message, or one
 the sender thought was urgent, has arrived and has not yet been
 played.

 Your nRich cybercash chip is installed in your pager, along with your
 nPediment identifier tag for keyless entry, the same one that most of
 your co-workers have installed in their phones, wallets, or upper
 arms.

 The pager's buzzing and vibration seems to have set up a sort of
 resonance in your body, which reacts like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.


     *** So it goes ***

>press gray
 Something that you're trying to refer to either hasn't ever been

>press button

 A beep issues from the pager, then a voice:

 Net extremely hoseled. Engine team being hideously masticated by this
 outage. Demo rapidly approaching. Get to the cages. Reboot the
 servers. Hasten. Do not rest. Please. All five of them. Email me to
 confirm you're heading out to do this. Please. Engine boys are going
 to run off and leap the railing if the network isn't restored.

 The frenetic voice is definitely that of your boss, Wilbur.

>look

 Home
 It's your residential canister. Your lime-green couch is against the
 longest wall. And it looks like we also have your nLap 500 and a heap
 of clothes.

>turn on nlap
 It is already on, although it's in sleep mode.

>examine nlap
 It's the nLap 500, tool of legend. Built-in Blacktooth and 811.02,
 twelve hours of battery life, Optidrive, ten-inch Crispicleer display
 and a tasty butterfly keyboard. Best to not even think about the
 processor and memory, since you'd rather not fall to your knees
 immediately in grateful tears.

 Your computer is ergonomically closed.

>wake nlap
 That can only be done to a higher organism.

>open computer
 You open the nLap 500, which wakes the moment it begins to unfold. A
 window slams open. Ass. Complete ass. The red stapler appears.

 Welcome to nSys! I'm Stan! Oop, I don't know your name yet! Please
 tell me your first name!

 :
>Floyd Montfort

 The desktop flashes light blue for a moment.

 Good to meet you, Floyd! I'm here to help you work different! With
 nWare's nSys operating system, you don't have to think! You can just
 USE THE COMPUTER! Don't fret about what to click and what to type,
 just work better, faster, and more limberly! Just USE THE COMPUTER!
 I'll be back if you need help!

 "Stan" steadies his metal jaw and winks out of sight.

 Your boon companion "Stan" has somehow reset himself like that three
 times already. Fortunately he -- it -- only forgets your name in the
 process.

>use computer
 You dash off a quick and reassuring email to Wilbur.

 A compulsive glance at the text file that holds your notes reassures
 you about the locations of the five servers: Wendy, at RelOfCoTn,
 Abalone and Second; Nora, in the airport; Ester, in the East Berm;
 Sophie, in City Hall, on the south end of Main; and Cindy, in F7 on
 the main campus.

 Not that you have a great sense of direction and remember exactly how
 to get to all of those places, but nTopia is pretty small -- you'll
 find them.

>get up
 You switch the light off as you leave. The door swings shut after you.

 Hallway
 The palate-cleansing corridor that leads to your apartment.

 Since you've changed clothes today, and don't enjoy the

 From here, it looks like it's possible to go down, north and in.

>go down

 Your Apartment Building's Lobby
 Clean, if not homey. The doorman waits in a Plexiglas cube that looks
 curiously bulletproof.

>examine doorman
 You've seen him here before. An intensely distracted and
 friendly-looking guy of middle age, probably of New Mexican or Mexican
 ancestry.

>examine doorman
 He's staring at the far wall intently, as if deciphering SETI data.

>talk to doorman
 Since you know less about small talk than about Smalltalk -- and that
 isn't saying much -- it would be best to specify what you want to
 discuss.

>ask doorman about me

 Your attempt to talk to the doorman either doesn't make it through the
 Plexiglas or doesn't make it into his head.

>go northeast
 Onward, into the intentional city. nWare crafted it well -- built from
 the ground up with security and scalability in mind, it's fully
 pedestrianized but hums, almost full-size, like a city center.

 The night sky is completely cloudless. The dry warmth of the air hints
 at the desert that surrounds nTopia.

 Abalone & Fifth
 Your apartment building is on the southwest corner. Opposite it is a
 windowless, blocky building. On the southeast corner Pharmicopia
 sprawls. Otto's Automat is to the northwest.

 A window pops up in the lower right corner of your nLap. In it, the
 uncanny red stapler wiggles its hinged head to the accompaniment of a
 cheery robot voice:

 I see you're outside! Hey, the nice thing about this city is that it
 uses the grid system, so you can just go NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, or WEST,
 and you'll pretty much always end up somewhere else!

 The window winks away.

>go north
 You head north on Abalone...

 Abalone & Fourth
 Parts of the city like this one give you a special tingle and suggest
 that Santa Claus and Jesus will be able to coexist in peace. The
 styling retail space on the northeast corner, nTune, is almost bare.
 To the southeast is the nTopia All-Faiths Chapel Complex. Unmistakable
 typography announces The Gap to the southwest, while the remaining
 corner features the smaller but less restrained posters of Comics
 Command.

 One guy on Rollerblades and one in a racing wheelchair whisper past,
 both with hockey sticks.

>go north
 You head north on Abalone...

 Abalone & Third
 A multi-level grocery store dominates the northeast corner, occupying
 the whole side of the block from here to Second. A windowless
 building, this one with a logo like a fork of lightning, is southeast.
 A shrouded establishment called "Gelatinous Cube" is southwest. On the
 final corner is a Starbucks.

>go north
 You head north on Abalone...

 Abalone & Second
 A familiar whiff rustles a flood of memories free.

 Well, not a flood, maybe. But there was that pepperoni and mushroom
 thin-crust you consumed right after moving in, after solving the
 difficult solid geometry puzzle posed by your doorway and your one
 piece of legacy, non-flat-pack furniture. The movers went away shaking
 their heads that afternoon. You did the Snoopy dance of triumph.

 Proud Pie is on the northeast corner. The multi-level grocery store to
 the southeast spans the block down Abalone. To the southwest is the
 concrete RelOfCoTn building, a typical nWare structure. An apartment
 building, The Peachtree, is northwest.

 A bicyclist hurtles by, speaking Spanish on a hands-free phone.

>go southwest
 You head into the building and over to the server room.

 RelOfCoTn Server Room
 There are racks and racks, with the usual drop ceiling and raised
 floor one finds in the upscale server room. And it looks like we also
 have Wendy.

>examine wendy
 It's a box that powers Engine's network, an nSure 3000. Bristling like
 a brain in a vat, this 10U monster can perform the functions of a few
 racks full of specialized Crisco hardware with herculean ease. Except
 it can't do that after it has crashed. A red button, deeply recessed
 to avoid accidental activation, is the only visible control.

>examine button
 ( That is, "examine the server's red button." )

 Just as the trash can is the one essential piece of office furniture,
 the reset switch is the one essential feature of an nWare server.

>press button
 ( That is, "press the server's red button." )

 The button clicks in. As you release it, the box falls silent and dark
 for a moment, then begins to power back up.

 You get that satisfied feeling that you usually get after
 accomplishing a work-related task.

>examine wendy
 This is an nSure 3000, one of five that powers Engine's network. It's
 got a red button on it.

>go northeast

 Abalone & Second
 Proud Pie is on the northeast corner. The multi-level grocery store to
 the southeast spans the block down Abalone. To the southwest is the
 concrete RelOfCoTn building, a typical nWare structure. An apartment
 building, The Peachtree, is northwest.

>go north
 You head north on Abalone...

 Abalone & First
 The clothing store Niche Threads is to the northeast, while a fire
 station, sporting the double oddity of two garage doors, is across
 from it on the southeast corner. To the southwest is the tall,
 cylindrical, and multicolored Medical Center Plaza. What dominates the
 intersection, though, is that even more striking and unusual pushpin
 of the swooping MuseRoom, to the northwest.

>go north
 You head north on Abalone...

 Abalone & Front
 You haven't been missing anything in this corner of town. The earth of
 the West Berm is heaped right up against the tall airport wall to the
 north, making this just a big dead-end alley.

 Two indistinguishable warehouses flank Abalone Street to the south.

 Carrie Fisher appears more or less in front of you, in flowing robes,
 and begins to crouch down.

>examine carrie
 To all appearances, it's actually Carrie Fisher.

 Carrie Fisher seems to go out of tune for a moment. Quite suddenly,
 she's wearing a slave-girl costume and looking rather surprised.

>kiss carrie
 This occurrence is absolutely stunning.

 Carrie Fisher flickers and disappears.

 A woman wearing some small display on her glasses pushes herself past
 on a Razor scooter, dictating Python into a headset.

>go north
 The immense metal wall of the airport is interposed as if there were
 Palestinians on the other side. Or perhaps you're the Palestinian. You
 won't get over it.

>go east
 You head east on Front Street...

 Eel & Front
 It's the gateway to nTopia. The airport is north through a tall
 rectangular arch that is topped with red flashing lights. On the
 southeast corner is the visitor center. Southwest is a Starbucks.

 A window pops up in the lower right corner of your nLap. In it, the
 uncanny red stapler wiggles its hinged head to the accompaniment of a
 cheery robot voice:

 Hey! Just letting you know! If you're not tickling the user interface
 or doing something like compiling a program, you can, you know, close
 the computer and save the battery a bit.

 The window winks away.

>examine nlap
 Your computer is ergonomically open and awake.

>close computer
 You close the nLap 500.

>go north

 Airport
 nAir flies direct from here to Seattle, San Jose, Austin, and Boston,
 with trips to less geeky destinations being more circuitous. They seem
 to have forgotten to give this place the air of a big-city airport. It
 looks more like a large metal barn, with little but a kiosk in this
 main space.

 Past security, to the north, you can see a handful of gates, which are
 actually gates in a fence. A subtle door to the east leads to the
 Airport's server room.

>go east
 You head through the door and into the server room.

 Airport Server Room
 Raised floor, drop ceiling, and racks all around instead of walls make
 this place seem pretty comfy, at least if you're a patch cable. And it
 looks like we also have Nora.

>examine nora
 This nSure 3000 looks a lot like Wendy.

>push button
 ( That is, "push the server's red button." )

 The button clicks in. As you release it, the box falls silent and dark

 It's the gateway to nTopia. The airport is north through a tall
 rectangular arch that is topped with red flashing lights. On the
 southeast corner is the visitor center. Southwest is a Starbucks.

 An enormous but rather well-behaved gorilla strides to the middle of
 the area, brandishing what looks like a giant can of Jolt Cola.

>go east
 You head east on Front Street...

 Main & Front
 Even Main Street has nothing but a pair of warehouses on this end,
 where it meets Front Street. The airport wall is north.

 A bicyclist hurtles by, speaking Spanish on a hands-free phone.

>go east
 You head east on Front Street...

 Octopus & Front
 Front Street continues its run alongside the airport. There is a
 warehouse on the southwest corner. Excitement is in store on the
 southeast corner, where a walled-off construction site is plastered
 with "Coming Soon: Mall of nTopia!" signs.

>go east
 You head east on Front Street...

 Urchin & Front
 Ghetto, hood, barrio -- they all seem a lot catchier than "housing for
 construction and infrastructure employees." If your skill at rebooting
 computers had been classified differently, you might have ended up
 living in this part of town. With the empty strip of sand there. And
 so much farther away from the arcade.

 In a seedier version of this city, a version of you that was skilled
 in martial arts might come here for some practice before tournaments.
 The city goes no further north or east. There's just Front Lodge to
 the southwest.

>go east
 There's nowhere to go. Past a small patch of desert that is no doubt
 reserved for future construction, the city ends at the East Berm.

>go south
 You head south on Urchin...

 Urchin & First
 First Lodge is on the northwest corner. The nWare Media Campus is
 southwest of here, but there's no way onto campus from this
 intersection.

>go northwest
 The door, not recognizing you as a resident or previously cleared
 guest, politely turns you away.

>go south
 You head south on Urchin...

 Urchin Behind Campus North
 The path to the west looks as nice as all the other campus walkways,
 but this is clearly an alley at the edge of town.

>go south
 You head south on Urchin...

 Urchin Behind Campus South
 The eastern edge of the city looks like a long, empty parking lot. The
 path onto campus to the west is typically impressive, though. There's
 a subtle brown door to the east here, set right in the dirt of the
 East Berm.

>go east
 You head through the door and into the server room.

 East Berm Server Room
 Much like other server rooms in this world of ours: racks, raised
 floor, drop ceiling. It seems to have been made a bit more spacious
 than it needs to be. Perhaps that was done to keep you from thinking
 about the fact that the room is buried in a large heap of earth for no
 apparent reason. And it looks like we also have Ester.

>examine ester
 This nSure 3000 looks a lot like Wendy.

>go south
 You head south on Urchin...

 Urchin & Fourth
 This particularly desolate spot on the eastern edge of town has an
 empty lot to the southwest and the boundary of the nWare Media Campus,
 offering no entrance, to the northwest. The lot has a chain link fence
 around it.

>go south
 You head south on Urchin...

 Urchin & Fifth
 A convenience store, ShopLite, is on the southwest corner, here at the
 eastern end of nTopia. There's an empty lot, ringed with a chain-link
 fence, to the northwest.

 A bearded figure wearing glasses and a Hawaiian shirt is very suddenly
 standing aways to your left, as if he just appeared there.

>examine figure
 To all appearances, it's actually a bearded guy.

 At the second glance, there's no mistaking it. You recognize him from
 that Con however many years ago. It's Gary Gygax.

>hit gygax
 This occurrence is absolutely stunning.

 Gary Gygax twists one hand over the other and, somehow, vanishes.

>go west
 You head west on Fifth Street...

 Octopus & Fifth
 The eastern corners are occupied by the two nicest residential options
 in town, The Maple Copse and Yew Village. City Hall has a face turned
 this way to the southwest. On the northwest corner are the colors and
 leafy tufts of the city gardens.

>go southwest

 City Hall
 The interior walls are of parquet hardwood, which would be the most
 remarkable thing about most city halls, but here we have this
 full-size diorama in the middle of the lobby with animatrons of
 Benjamin Franklin, John von Neumann, and nWare's monarchically wealthy
 founder, shellf.

 There's also a subtle door here to the southeast, which wouldn't be
 noticeable to an onlooker who wasn't in the know.

>se
 You head through the door and into the server room.

 City Hall Server Room
 There are just the usual racks here. The rest of the room is bare,
 with the usual drop ceilings and the usual raised floor providing a
 contrast to the unusual wooden walls outside. And it looks like we
 also have Sophie.

 You notice that it has a brass button on it.

>push button

 button?

>push diorama
 You can't.

>push brass
 Something that you're trying to refer to either hasn't ever been
 mentioned or is not currently in the area.

>push brass button
 Ben Franklin twitches a bit for a moment, but then grinds to a halt. A
 hollow voice says "nSys for Diorama error number n plus one.
 Attempting reboot." And then nothing else seems to happen.

 Except that a small brass stick slowly juts out from near where the
 button is, in a sort of juvenile way.

>examine stick
 It's an nStick, a proprietary memory storage device. You haven't seen
 this particular sort before, and it's not going to fit into any of the
 usual computer suspects -- your nLap or the servers you manage.

>take stick
 As you remove the stick from the diorama, the slot or plug or whatever
 this thing was in unhelpfully seals itself closed.

>go northwest

 Main & Fifth
 The building to the northeast houses "Scales," a restaurant. The
 government-looking neo-something architecture of City Hall offers an
 entryway to the southeast. On the southwest corner is "Wheel-Man," a
 personal transportation dealer. The final business here, to the
 northwest, is Mailboxes Ultra.

 A blue-white cloud rapidly coalesces in the middle of the
 intersection. As it dissipates, an elegant yet thuggish man steps from
 it, casually wielding a huge sword.

>examine man
 ( That is, "examine the elegant thug." )

 To all appearances, it's actually an elegant thug.

 As the thug looks around without seeming to see you or anything else,
 something assures you, as blatantly as a Queen soundtrack would, that
 this is Christopher Lambert.

>examine lambert
 To all appearances, it's actually Christopher Lambert.

 A tremendous lightning strike suddenly intersects Christopher Lambert
 and either toasts him, or, if you're inclined to a more generous
 interpretation of the event, teleports him away.

>time
 That verb doesn't seem to be part of your API, metaphorically
 speaking. That is, that verb won't be understood. Try something else,
 or phrase that command differently.

>go north
 You head north on Main...

 Main & Fourth
 One corner of the nWare Media Campus is to the northeast, where a path
 affords entrance. A Starbucks is on the southeast corner. There is a
 coffeehouse called "Independent Grounds" to the southwest. Another
 Starbucks is on the northwest corner.

>go northeast

 Campus South
 The south part of the campus is deceptively pleasant, with nWare Media
 buildings scattered about. You particularly note F7, which you're
 cleared to enter, to the northwest.

 Your stomach speaks to you in twangs of pain. Although you don't know
 Morse code, the jist of the message is that it would be a good idea to
 get something to eat soon.

>go northwest

 F7 Server Room
 The raised floor is charcoal in color -- it's the sort seen in all
 nWare buildings that house really official business. The racks all
 around are also especially businesslike. And it looks like we also
 have Cindy.

>push button
 ( That is, "push the server's red button." )

 The button clicks in. As you release it, the box falls silent and dark
 for a moment, then begins to power back up.

 You get that satisfied feeling that you usually get after
 accomplishing a work-related task.

 "Hey! You gotta hear this!"

 You whirl around for a moment, then keep whirling around, and finally,
 when you hear a "What?" in reply, realize that this snippet of speech
 is being carried to you through some ventilation system or other
 unseen passageway.

 "You know how I was saying that this nonsense we're working on has got
 to be a cover for something? Check this out --"

 There is a rustle of pages.

 "They have one of these for congressmen, see, in case of nuclear war.
 I bet this whole site was just put together as a bunker like this, so
 the execs can get away in case the terrorists start opening up on the
 real cities."

 "Really?"

 "Well, yeah."

 The voices drift away, leaving you disappointed at your own lack of
 inane workplace prattle.

 A metallic sound, a twinkling like a dozen will-o-the-wisps, and then
 Leonard Nimoy is standing about three feet above the ground, wearing
 jeans and a black turtleneck.

 A window pops up in the lower right corner of your nLap. In it, the
 uncanny red stapler wiggles its hinged head to the accompaniment of a
 cheery robot voice:

 Hey, this looks like the nWare media campus! This place is where other
 helpful entities like me are being developed, along with a lot of
 other really cool stuff!

 The window winks away.

>use computer
 Complete ass. An automated email tells you that a new very critical
 internal intensive update has been issued, which means you'll have to
 download it, compile it here on the nLap -- the only place you've got
 the build environment set up -- and then apply it to all five servers.
 Fortunately you can do that remotely. Unfortunately this thing will
 probably take ten minutes to download and four hours to compile.

 Okay, that's an exaggeration. It will probably take eight minutes to
 download and maybe two and a half hours to compile.

 You start the download.

 Leonard Nimoy looks around calmly and raises an eyebrow. His whole
 body raises and lowers itself, too, finally coming to rest on the
 ground.

 Since you were here last, they seem to have installed a man-sized
 stuffed mouse in one corner.

>examine mouse
 After you pull your attention away from the hideous rictus the mouse
 wears, you notice that there's a panel on the creature's back that is
 open and streaming with wires. It must be some sort of robot
 entertainer.

 "Man, we ordered DDR and they sent that thing," some guy calls from

 That must have been a rhetorical question, as the guy proceeds to slip

>buy food
 Food does seem like a good idea. You order some and prepare to focus
 completely on the meal, like Martha Stewart on her salad...

 A guy you met during new employee reorientation -- Knut, you think his
 name is -- furtively joins you as you're dining. He looks even more
 feverish and high-strung than he did a few days ago.

 "Hi. Hi again. Gotta tell. Tell you something."

 "Reality. Illusion. Theme is reality versus illusion. Must discern
 reality. And illusion."

 "Behind a small plate I have placed it. In F2, the downstairs lab.
 Hopefully you can get into F2. I have placed the device. The device
 you will need. The magic helmet."

 Knut tilts forward as if he was going to relate to you some ultimate
 secret, then, surprisingly, bolts away and out the door. He's long
 gone before you even manage to conceive of pursuing him, so you turn
 back to your meal.

 You conclude your culinary experience.

 Something that you're trying to refer to either hasn't ever been

>intro
 ( Interactive fiction provides a world, complete with a setting that
 is a simulated space, objects and characters that exist within that
 space, and even unusual physical laws.

 This world and the things that happen in it are described to you, the
 player, in text. You control a character, the "player character," by
 typing short commands that express what you want the character to do
 next. Many simple commands that you could give to an actor, standing
 on stage with the appropriate props around, should be understood.

 something, for instance:


 The first of these is only a sensible command when there is a CD case
 in the player character's possession or in the area; the second can
 only be expected to work if the player character has money and is
 somewhere where widgets are sold; and the last command will only be
 meaningful if there is a goon nearby or otherwise available for
 communication.

 Headings, shown in bold, indicate the current location of the player
 character.

 The current location is also named in the upper right; the obvious
 ways to leave are indicated in the upper left. The command EXITS will
 result in the obvious ways to leave being named explicitly.

 Upon entering a location, the area will be described. To take a closer
 look at something in the location or in the player character's
 possession, you can EXAMINE or LOOK AT it. In Book and Volume, the
 first description may provide more commentary or reminisces than later
 descriptions.

 You can command the player character to manipulate things in the
 world, too: to pick up certain things, turn some devices on and off,
 and eat food, for instance. The player character can also be commanded
 to talk to some other characters.

 SCORE and FULL SCORE provide some information about how you are
 progressing at some tasks.

 First-time players are sometimes frustrated that certain commands will
 not work, but there is some sort of system to interactive fiction. The
 sort of commands that usually don't work include:



 Unless the player character has just been presented with a blank organ
 donor card, there would be no obvious way to do this. Even in that
 case, something more specific and concrete, such as CHECK THE TOP BOX,
 might be more effective. Commands should generally have something to
 do with concrete things in the immediate area, although conversations
 with other characters might be about abstract topics.



 The player character is usually only able to move around locally,
 following such commands as GO NORTH, LEAVE, and GO TO THE RESTAURANT
 (when there is a single restaurant in the immediate area). An
 indicator in the upper left shows what directions the player character
 can move in. You can also type EXITS to see these directions listed.

 More generally, complex actions that involve numerous steps
 (purchasing a plane ticket, booking a hotel room, packing for a trip,
 arranging ground transportation to the airport, waiting in line at
 security, and so on) cannot usually be accomplished with a single
 command. Some actions of moderate complexity might be possible with
 single commands, however, if they are routine ones for the player
 character.



 If there's a coffee table in the room, you can just directly command
 the player character to do several things: look at it, take things off
 it, put things on it, and so forth. There's usually no need to move
 the player character around in front of specific pieces of furniture;
 just specifying what is to be done is enough.



 One problem is that the command does not specify where to run to or
 what direction to run in. Also, the adverbs will not be understood.
 Generally, adverbs are unnecessary. You are asked to choose what basic
 things the player character does, not the very fine details of how
 those actions are accomplished.


 You may want to take some notes as you play interactive fiction.
 Traditionally, players have drawn a map as they progress through a
 particular interactive fiction world; this may or may not be necessary
 for particular people playing particular pieces of interactive
 fiction.

 Finally, playing interactive fiction with others, in person or online,
 is probably the best introduction. Even if your fellow players are not
 interactive fiction experts, different people will have different good
 ideas about how to make progress, and working together can be fun. )

 The white, high-ceilinged place is run through with cliffs of boxed-up

 Ringed within these are household and personal supplies, while nearest
 the core -- by the enclosure where the pharmacists and their
 attendants no doubt circulate -- are the brand-name over-the-counter
 philters of vibrant color, along with the alternatives: vitamins,
 herbs, and homeopathic dilutions.

 As you walk in, some punky-looking teenagers file out past you.

 "That is totally what my mom has been doing," one of them says, "Crazy

 "... tests were, again, all just fine," some woman in a doctor costume

 uncanny red stapler wiggles its hinged head to the accompaniment of a
 cheery robot voice:

 Hey, this looks like the hospital! This is where you can go if you're
 sick! If you're really sick, sometimes emergency medical workers will
 helpfully bring you here!

 The window winks away.

 A beep issues from the pager, then a voice:

 Gus needs his password reset now. Immediately. At the current time.
 Sorry it's so early. Also, be nice to him when you walk over and
 deliver his new password, since this weekend has been rough on
 everyone. He's in F2 and I'm now having your nPediment privileges set
 so you can walk right in there and find him. Thanks for rebooting the
 machines, by the way.

 It is, of course, Wilbur.

 A beep issues from the pager, then a voice:

 This is an automatic report about how you got owned, champ. That's
 right, one of your machines is puking out denial of service packets
 and needs to be offlined immediately. Better get it off your network
 before somebody other than a robot tells you about it. The victim is
 Nora.

 It sounds like the perky cousin of that stupid stapler.

 You close the nLap 500.

 F2 Main Floor
 This is a large, open, and curiously empty workspace. Presumably
 employees come in here with their own laptops and work in some sort of
 hoteling arrangement, but the place seems rather desolate at the
 moment. Perhaps the team that uses this space isn't working feverishly
 for the demo, the way Engine team is. Or perhaps they're just
 elsewhere, who knows?

 There are racks all around the place. And it looks like we also have
 the F2 server.

>examine server
 This nSure 3000 looks a lot like Wendy.

 One thing seems pretty funny, though. The machine is hooked up in a
 completely ass-reversed fashion, or, actually, in a way that's even
 worse. It just seems to be plugged into itself all over the place. It
 couldn't actually be doing anything useful, set up like this. This is
 a fake server, the equivalent of a blank book that is used for
 interior decorating purposes.

>connect server
 That verb doesn't seem to be part of your API, metaphorically

 You pull the server towards you a bit and then release it. It falls

 West End of Colossal Cave
 You are at one end of a vast hall stretching out of sight to the east.

 The orange pulsing walls and sadomasochistic ripples of mist that so

 white, shaped like a giant Bose speaker. One notable feature is the
 large black button with a right-pointing triangle on it. Curiously,
 you also notice a small plate on one of the walls here -- there must
 have been some method to Knut's madness.

 Ah, yes. The black button. There it is.

 The floor suddenly takes on the appearance of a street. And that's not

 A bearded figure wearing glasses and a Hawaiian shirt is very suddenly

 Oh, yeah. Gary Gygax again.

 Gary Gygax twists one hand over the other and, somehow, vanishes.

 The plate can basically be opened, if it's closed, or can be closed,
 if it's open. Other sorts of struggles with the plate are not likely
 to be efficacious.

>open plate
 You open the plate, revealing a futuristic helmet.

>examine helmet
 It's a head-enclosing helmet, mirrored on the front. Not the thing
 you'd want to wear to a formal dinner. Here in nTopia, though, it
 would probably be a perfectly acceptable accessory. It's discretely
 labeled "SimulacCam."

>wear helmet
 You enclose your head in the blackness of the helmet. An instant and a
 soft beep later, you can somehow see and hear again. You don't seem to
 have any trouble breathing in the strange device, and it isn't as
 uncomfortable as one would imagine.

 The building seems to be almost completely occupied by this one huge

 server room might be.

>examine screen
 You read a curious message there: "All 'sensitives' on the Book Team
 should have been evacuated by now! If any are left consult the
 appropriate contact regarding evacuation ASAP IKYN!"

 A superannuated manager rushes in, fiddling with some sort of
 extremely advanced laser pointer. He casts an embarrassed glance at
 the flat panel and manipulates the laser pointer; the screen blinks
 off. With some other twist or twiddle of the device, the east wall
 slides open, and the flat panel moves with it, out of sight.

 "Come. In here."

 He ushers you east.

 The sudden clamor and rush of a crowd sends you helplessly to the

 You stand, finally, unsure about what you seem to have witnessed,

 Southwest, the bad Southwestern art of the Coyote and Crown howls from
 the northwest corner. A pleasant absence of city is southeast, where
 the fake hills of nTopia's park roll.

>go east
 You head east on Second Street...

 Main & Second
 Main runs along the west edge of the nWare Media Campus. To the
 northwest is a Starbucks. The glass cube of the nWare Store sits on a
 park-like plot to the southwest.

>go east
 You head east on Second Street...

 Campus North
 The north part of the campus is deceptively pleasant, with nWare Media
 buildings scattered about. Specifically, F2 is to the northeast.

 A bald man runs screaming past you, pants on fire, pursued by a man
 without pants whose hair is on fire. They disappear around a corner.

>go east
 You head east on Second Street...

 Urchin Behind Campus North
 The path to the west looks as nice as all the other campus walkways,
 but this is clearly an alley at the edge of town.

 You've barely noticed it, thanks to the way the streetlights have
 gradually filled in for the departing sun, but night has fallen.

>go south
 You head south on Urchin...

 Urchin Behind Campus South
 The eastern edge of the city looks like a long, empty parking lot. The
 path onto campus to the west is typically impressive, though. There's
 a subtle brown door to the east here, set right in the dirt of the
 East Berm.

>go east
 You head through the door and into the server room.

 East Berm Server Room
 Much like other server rooms in this world of ours: racks, raised
 floor, drop ceiling. It seems to have been made a bit more spacious
 than it needs to be. And it looks like we also have Ester.

>open floor
 Using the double-cup panel lifter somewhat more strenuously than you
 really should have to, you wiggle part of the floor open.

>enter floor
 There's no way you're going to be able to get into the raised floor
 wearing the SimulacCam.

 There's a loud and sudden microphone-tapping sound, followed by the
 shriek of feedback.

 ATTENTION, this is not an emergency. But there will be a demonstration
 of a project involving new technologies in just a few minutes. It may
 possibly result in some unusual irregularities. Don't be alarmed.
 Thank you.

 The civil alert system crackles back into silence.

>SAVE

>doff helmet
 You take off the SimulacCam.

>go down
 You muddle around under the raised floor a bit, encountering only
 conduits and claustrophobia, not really even needing a lamp for the
 full experience. Then you get back out of there.

>wear helmet
 You once again don the strange helmet.








 A warning shriek sounds, almost inside your head -- it's the helmet.
 "OVERLOAD," a stupidly calm voice says. The SimulacCam splits right
 down the middle, along the line of your nose, and falls, shattering on
 the ground.

 A coming screams across the ceiling.

 All that you can see flickers into reverse video; even worse is the
 reverse audio, pure sound everywhere except for the globs of silence
 shrieked from innumerable mouths, your own one of these. The tongue
 cannot say what tastes and smells visit you. Your skin is crawling all
 over the ants. The round is world.

 Sixteen years later you arise from catatonia to play a single game of
 ping pong against a silentious Native American. It is a moment that
 Oliver Sacks would have written touchingly about. But the moment does
 not last.

 The south part of the campus is deceptively pleasant, with nWare Media
 buildings scattered about. You particularly note F7, which you're
 cleared to enter, to the northwest. And to the southeast is the
 enigmatic F9.

>go west
 You head west on Third Street...

 Main & Third
 Main runs along the western edge of the nWare Media Campus. Northwest
 of here, a bit of parkland holds the nWare store, a multi-story glass
 cube. The concrete structure to the southwest, labeled "Supreme Food
 Court," is less impressive.

 A man plods down the street and away from you, carrying an elderly man
 on his back and a Cabbage Patch doll in his arms.

>go northwest

 nWare Store
 The products are incidentally on hand here. Usually nGeniuses are
 about to discuss tips and tricks that further enhance the virtues of
 nWare hardware and software, preaching to the clergy. Today, perhaps
 because of the impending demo, the place seems barren.

 A shrouded establishment called "Gelatinous Cube" is southwest. On the

 Abalone & Fourth
 The styling retail space on the northeast corner, nTune, is almost
 bare. To the southeast is the nTopia All-Faiths Chapel Complex.
 Unmistakable typography announces The Gap to the southwest, while the
 remaining corner features the smaller but less restrained posters of
 Comics Command.

 Comics Command
 Airy, clean, but otherwise rather like those indigenous comics stores
 that appear in American basements here and there, those cozy bunkers.

>buy watchmen
 You check all over for Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's Watchmena graphic
 novel you happen to really like, in which a sinister conspiracy is at
 work in an alternate but recognizable reality -- but there doesn't
 seem to be a copy anywhere around here. Too bad.

>examine comics
 Something that you're trying to refer to either hasn't ever been
 mentioned or is not currently in the area.

 Eel & Fourth
 The local elementary school sits beside a gated playground to the
 northeast. Plywood closes off the site on the southeast corner, hiding
 whatever is being built there. The Pine and Elm is southwest. On the
 northwest corner is an upscale variety store, MarMart.
 You head east on Fourth Street...

 The sudden clamor and rush of a crowd sends you helplessly to the
 ground. With a grinding pull, a battalion in green aprons hurls itself
 over you and into the structure on the southwest corner. Perhaps you
 glimpse a pair of stunned figures in black T-shirts inside, shivering
 behind a counter. Your vision seems to be obscured for a moment by a
 milky steam.

 You stand, finally, unsure about what you seem to have witnessed,
 unsure about whether or not to hope it was real.

 Main & Fourth
 One corner of the nWare Media Campus is to the northeast, where a path
 affords entrance. There are Starbuckses on the other three corners.

 A sizable crowd of people wearing tye-dyed bedsheets babbles loudly,
 running past and away from you.
 You head south on Main...

 Main & Fifth
 The building to the northeast houses "Scales," a restaurant. The
 government-looking neo-something architecture of City Hall offers an
 entryway to the southeast. On the southwest corner is "Wheel-Man," a
 personal transportation dealer. The final business here, to the
 northwest, is Mailboxes Ultra.

 City Hall
 The interior walls are of parquet hardwood, which would be the most
 remarkable thing about most city halls, but here we have this
 full-size diorama in the middle of the lobby with animatrons of
 Benjamin Franklin, John von Neumann, and shellf.

 There's also a subtle door here to the southeast, which wouldn't be
 noticeable to an onlooker who wasn't in the know.

 Back Street runs east behind City Hall here at the south end of
 nTopia. Eel is to the west. A warehouse is on the northwest corner.

 You have come to the edge of the plateau on which nTopia is built. Far
 below, past the railing, is the desert plain, stretching from reddish
 white to white, scraggled here and there with gray. The sky is lapis
 lazuli. Some highway stretches far off from east to west, as if it
 were an imperfect reflection of a line on a map.

 Two uncannily clean but industrial-looking buildings sit on either

 Airport
 nAir flies direct from here to Seattle, San Jose, Austin, and Boston,
 with trips to less geeky destinations being more circuitous. They seem

 You head south on Urchin...

 Urchin Behind Campus South
 The eastern edge of the city looks like a long, empty parking lot. The
 path onto campus to the west is typically impressive, though. There's
 a subtle brown door to the east here, set right in the dirt of the
 East Berm.

>go east
 You head through the door and into the server room.

 East Berm Server Room
 Much like other server rooms in this world of ours: racks, raised
 floor, drop ceiling. It seems to have been made a bit more spacious
 than it needs to be. And it looks like we also have Ester.

>examine ceiling
 There's the ceiling. Right up there.

 Using the double-cup panel lifter somewhat more strenuously than you

 There's no way you're going to be able to get into the raised floor
 wearing the SimulacCam.

>take off helmet
 You take off the SimulacCam.

 You muddle around under the raised floor a bit, encountering only
 conduits and claustrophobia, not really even needing a lamp for the

 nAir flies direct from here to Seattle, San Jose, Austin, and Boston,

 northwest.

>examine museroom
 Cultural hub of nTopia, this peripheral building holds both the city's
 museum and the only library. Like the Medical and Professional Center
 across from it, it is radially symmetric. While lacking colored
 stripes, it does have the shape of an alien chesspiece and a facade
 entirely made of rose-colored glass. Someone very famous designed it
 and cackled gleefully when it was completed.

 Proud Pie is on the northeast corner. The multi-level grocery store to

 concrete RelOfCoTn building, a typical nWare structure. An apartment
 building, The Peachtree, is northwest.

>go south
 You head south on Abalone...

 Abalone & Third
 A multi-level grocery store dominates the northeast corner, occupying
 the whole side of the block from here to Second. A windowless

 A shrouded establishment called "Gelatinous Cube" is southwest. On the
 final corner is a Starbucks.








 A warning shriek sounds, almost inside your head -- it's the helmet.
 "OVERLOAD," a stupidly calm voice says. The SimulacCam splits right
 down the middle, along the line of your nose, and falls, shattering on
 the ground.

 A coming screams across the sky.

 All that you can see flickers into reverse video; even worse is the
 reverse audio, pure sound everywhere except for the globs of silence
 shrieked from innumerable mouths, your own one of these. The tongue
 cannot say what tastes and smells visit you. Your skin is crawling all
 over the ants. The round is world.

 Sixteen years later you arise from catatonia to play a single game of
 ping pong against a silentious Native American. It is a moment that
 Oliver Sacks would have written touchingly about. But the moment does
 not last.

 This is an automatic report about how you got owned, champ. That's
 right, one of your machines is puking out denial of service packets

 You read a curious message there: "All 'sensitives' on the Book Team
 should have been evacuated by now! If any are left consult the
 appropriate contact regarding evacuation ASAP IKYN!"

 A superannuated manager rushes in, fiddling with some sort of
 extremely advanced laser pointer. He casts an embarrassed glance at
 the flat panel and manipulates the laser pointer; the screen blinks
 off. With some other twist or twiddle of the device, the east wall
 slides open, and the flat panel moves with it, out of sight.

 "Come. In here."

 He ushers you east.

 It's all orange inside, too, with rounded booths of different sizes

 A warning shriek sounds, almost inside your head -- it's the helmet.
 "OVERLOAD," a stupidly calm voice says. The SimulacCam splits right
 down the middle, along the line of your nose, and falls, shattering on
 the ground.

 A coming screams across the ceiling.

 All that you can see flickers into reverse video; even worse is the
 reverse audio, pure sound everywhere except for the globs of silence
 shrieked from innumerable mouths, your own one of these. The tongue
 cannot say what tastes and smells visit you. Your skin is crawling all

 This panel really looks a lot like the rest of the wall, but close

 apparently painted on using some pigment that isn't quite in the

 In the center of the token panel you notice a small, dark maw.

 Just as the first fight is about to begin, some twelve-year-old kid

 "Perhaps you are wondering what the purpose of all this is," the kid
 says calmly.

>play game

 You're just barely able to crouch and block as Floofta powers into a

 "Governments are pesky," the kid says. "Sure, corporations are

 Floofta executes a swift axe hoof, which you barely parry, using the
 Calf Worshipping Goddess technique.

 "As you may remember from history, overthrowing regimes is a messy
 business," the kid says.

>play game

 You manage to land a feeble punch. Then, Floofta grapples you and
 throws you painfully to the ground.

 "But if you could simulate political leaders, simulate appreciative
 crowds," the kid muses, "have your doppelgangers move among the
 people, sowing confusion..."

>examine kid
 The kid stands impassively facing his side of the arcade cabinet, face
 lit by the psychedelic glow of the machine.

 Floofta hurls an enormous hairball which flattens and stupefies you.

 "You get the idea," the kid says. "That's what everyone is working on
 here. That's what you're working on, although you almost certainly
 don't know it."

>play game
 You're playing it, oh yeah.

 You rally. It's like Ali in round eight against Foreman. You're
 landing all sorts of kicks and punches on Floofta.

 "Rallies, meetings, the State of the Union address -- it will all be
 simulated," the kid, still oddly calm, tells you. "And nWare will run
 it all."

>play game
 You're playing it, oh yeah.

 Floofta spins around and answers with a series of punishing blows that
 prove decisive.

 "FINISH HIM!" the game proclaims, as poor Llamo wobbles there
 non-interactively.

 "I'm not telling you that you should do anything differently, that you
 should try to look around and stop what's going on," they kid says.
 "No, no. But just so you know what you've gotten yourself into."

>play game
 You're playing it, oh yeah.

 Rather than delivering the coup de grace, the kid slaps a token down
 on the machine and runs off, disappearing.

 "GAME OVER," the machine says. Even the winner doesn't get to continue
 after a game in smackdown mode. Just like in real life.

>examine token
 Actually, how could you have mistaken this for a token, even though
 that's the only thing that a normal person would slap down on a video
 game cabinet? It's not a token at all. It's some sort of high
 proprietary Allen wrench.

 park. On the southeast corner is the police station. A Starbucks is on
 the southwest corner. Neon signs and flashing screens glint from the
 establishment to the northwest, Arcadia Ego.

>go south
 You head south on Eel...

 Eel & Fourth
 The local elementary school sits beside a gated playground to the
 northeast. Plywood closes off the site on the southeast corner, hiding
 whatever is being built there. The Pine and Elm is southwest. On the
 northwest corner is an upscale variety store, MarMart.

>go south
 You head south on Eel...

 Eel & Fifth
 To the northeast is Public Char. A Starbucks is on the southeast
 corner. A complex of tall apartment buildings, The Planar Forest, is
 southwest. To the northwest is a shoe store.

 A miniature ambulance whisks by at a frightening speed, doing a donut
 before it peals out of sight.

>go south
 You head south on Eel...

 Eel & Back
 Two uncannily clean but industrial-looking buildings sit on either
 side of Eel to the north. Back Street runs right along the railing
 that bounds the city to the south.

 You have come to the edge of the plateau on which nTopia is built. Far
 below, past the railing, is the desert plain, stretching from reddish
 white to white, scraggled here and there with gray. The sky is lapis
 lazuli. Some highway stretches far off from east to west, as if it
 were an imperfect reflection of a line on a map.

>full score
 You have so far completed 8 of the 10 tasks assigned you.

 You have accomplished these important job-related tasks:

 - Offlining the rooted server.

 These labors remain:

 - Replacing the defective disk.
 - Destroying the defective disk.

>go northwest

 Incinerator
 There's some corrugated steel-with-cinderblock-accents thing going on
 here. The floor ends to the west, where smoke and wailing rise from a
 pit. And it looks like we also have a double-cup panel lifter.

>take lifter
 You conduct the acquisition.

 You can't go that way.

 Eel & Back
 Two uncannily clean but industrial-looking buildings sit on either

 While there is a great view over there, the sheer drop of a hundred
 feet or so makes it impossible to go in that direction, except
 fatally.

>go north

 To the northeast is Public Char. A Starbucks is on the southeast

>go east
 You head east on Fifth Street...

 Main & Fifth
 The building to the northeast houses "Scales," a restaurant. The
 government-looking neo-something architecture of City Hall offers an
 entryway to the southeast. On the southwest corner is "Wheel-Man," a
 personal transportation dealer. The final business here, to the
 northwest, is Mailboxes Ultra.

 A sizable crowd of people wearing tye-dyed bedsheets babbles loudly,
 running past and away from you.

>se

 City Hall
 The interior walls are of parquet hardwood, which would be the most
 remarkable thing about most city halls, but here we have this
 full-size diorama in the middle of the lobby with animatrons of
 Benjamin Franklin, John von Neumann, and shellf.

 There's also a subtle door here to the southeast, which wouldn't be
 noticeable to an onlooker who wasn't in the know.

>se
 You head through the door and into the server room.

 City Hall Server Room
 There are just the usual racks here. The rest of the room is bare,
 with the usual drop ceilings and the usual raised floor providing a
 contrast to the unusual wooden walls outside. And it looks like we
 also have Sophie.

>lift floor
 Using the double-cup panel lifter somewhat more strenuously than you
 really should have to, you wiggle part of the floor open.

>take off helmet
 You take off the SimulacCam.

>go down
 There's a curious amount of space under the floor to the north. You
 scoot into it.

 Darkness
 The darkness here may be the only profound thing in nTopia.

>open computer
 You open the nLap 500, which wakes the moment it begins to unfold.

 Passage
 Sometimes a horrifying conspiracy lives beneath the surface of
 reality. Sometimes, just a cramped crawlspace like this one, lacking
 even the dust that most such spaces have. And it looks like we also
 have an overhead ventilation grill.

>examine grill
 It seems to be fastened with some screws or bolts, whatever the
 difference is, that are of surreal or alien design. No mass-market
 device is going to open this.

>open grill with wrench
 You wield the highly proprietary Allen wrench for a while, alternating
 between hope and frustration, and finally manage to open the grill.

>enter grill
 You break into the office above like a tech support commando. Time to
 fix those wiretaps so the boss can figure out what the Democrats have
 been up to! Or, time to steal back that list of Resistance members'
 names! Or, time to enter yet another uninteresting commercial, retail,
 or institutional space!

 Office
 This would be an impressive and luxurious office, if it had some
 furniture and stuff in it. It doesn't look like the place is occupied
 -- except, occasionally, by trespassers. There's an exit underneath
 you and a door through which a bit of light filters in. Disturbing the
 minimalist appearance of the room is a garish fake bookcase.

>examine bookcase
 Upon closer inspection, the fake bookcase is definitely fake, as if it
 were designed to reassure people that the occupant of this office
 doesn't spend his or her time reading.

 This would be an impressive and luxurious office, if it had some

 -- except, occasionally, by trespassers. There's an exit underneath
 you and a door through which a bit of light filters in. Where the
 bookcase used to be is a person-sized cylinder, open on the front.

>examine cylinder
 The sight awakens one of your few pleasant childhood memories: Sitting
 in comfort in the forward-facing car seat on the passenger side, you
 went to the drive-through bank and received a delicious blue candy,
 which arrived in a pneumatic tube that looked like a smaller version
 of this cylinder.

 Anyway. If this is where the Controller is supposed to reside in
 suspended animation, directing the city, then the genie is out of the
 bottle -- the lunatics are running the asylum -- there is no man
 behind the curtain.

>take cylinder
 That's not detachable.

>enter cylinder
 You enter the cylinder. A voice is cued: "Escape canister will be
 ready for departure at approximately NINETEEN FORTY FIVE."

>wait
 Time goes by.

>close canister
 That's not something you can close.

>wait until 19:45

 A window pops up in the lower right corner of your nLap. In it, the
 uncanny red stapler wiggles its hinged head to the accompaniment of a
 cheery robot voice:

 I need to sleep now to preserve your valuable data and the integrity
 of your application state! Please recharge me soon!

 The window, and in fact the whole screen, winks to black.

 This is actually really bad, because you now realize that you lost the
 transformer for the nLap at some point on Friday.

>wait until 7:45 pm
 Time goes by.

 The room is suddenly sealed off from you -- the cylinder has closed.
 You feel the cylinder, and yourself, make a thumpy squiggle.

 You seem to be moving.

 -- you've been jarred from your idle waiting.

>look

 Cylinder
 So much depends upon a featureless cylinder, filled with you, moving
 through some indeterminate location.

>wait

 A few verses from the Yoyodyne Songbook well outward from your being
 and into the air, which surprises even you.

>jump
 You jump a good half inch, which is all there's room for.

>close nlap
 You close the nLap 500.

 The cylinder shudders as if coming to a halt. It does something a bit
 less graceful than sliding open and a bit more graceful than blowing
 open.

>pray
 Seems like as good a time as any to embrace the supernatural. You
 mutter a quick petition to Azathoth.

 The floor-part of this cylinder tips, urging you to exit. So you trip
 out of the canister.

 Once you've extricated yourself, the cylinder, bereft of payload,
 seals itself again. It wooshes away, perhaps so as to be ready for
 another very important passenger.

 The Desert
 You learned in college geography that the desert is actually teeming
 with life. Except that isn't true of this place, which is simply a
 plain of white, barren sand. The desert is exceedingly empty. It seems
 that in the whole expanse there is nothing but one rock.

 On the rock is one man.

 Maybe he brought the rock himself.

 "Hi," says the man. He gestures to your head. "Do you mind? That's a
 bit threatening."

>take off helmet
 You take off the SimulacCam.

 "I suppose you're the only one who made it out this way," the man
 says. He shrugs. "Maybe the others will cope."

>SAVE

>ask man about ntopia

 "Save the questions," he says.

>examine man
 He is wearing a Hugo Boss suit, legs crossed, fingers steepled in
 front of him. He looks at you with care. His features and complexion
 suggest that his ancestors lived in this country thousands of years
 ago.








 You feel a tug within you, a subtle but literal reconfiguration of
 your system. Whatever it is that gripped you cannot hold you from
 here, however.

 On the high and far plateau nTopia pulses and swarms with realities, a
 time-lapse, space-lapse sculpture, root and rhizome. The city does not
 shape itself into some urban battlefield for the pleasure of unseen
 generals, or into some all-maddening hilarious face to be put on by
 warfighter and advertiser alike. No bread, no circuses, no clockwork
 demagogues can be discerned. If these are to be the true products of
 the nWare Media Division, the demo that transpires does not appear to
 promote them.

 Instead, the chessboard of the city sets itself into positions, the
 brick and mortar structures at play with ones more liquid. There are
 sprawling markets and office buildings like Jehovas, but also slums
 and huge estates, parks and wastes, a stadium and churches, water
 treatment plants, jails and prisons, pyramids, military bases,
 factories, all cities the city, one Babel of configurations, as if
 some intellect or algorithm, or both, were looking through them all to
 find the one most perfect.

 "Come on," the business-shaman says, "my car's at the Dairy Queen.
 Keep up a decent pace and we'll get there by nine, before they close.
 I'll buy you a Blizzard."

 Pisces, Cetus, Aquarius -- above nTopia churning are the
 constellations as you have seen them many times before. One moment of
 hesitation before turning to go, and the sky shudders. With that, the
 final touch is added, the augmentation complete. The dark has been
 pierced through again by some artist, some fellow employee, and you
 see them just as you saw them laid out before: The Cradle, The Way,
 The Burning Book.

 Without standing, the man reaches inside his suit coat and immediately

 Several hours later you awaken in this same spot, alone and quite
 uncertain about your future.

 Airport
 nAir flies direct from here to Seattle, San Jose, Austin, and Boston,
 with trips to less geeky destinations being more circuitous. They seem
 to have forgotten to give this place the air of a big-city airport. It
 looks more like a large metal barn, with little but a kiosk in this
 main space.

 Past security, to the north, you can see a handful of gates, which are
 actually gates in a fence. A subtle door to the east leads to the
 Airport's server room.

 A window pops up in the lower right corner of your nLap. In it, the
 uncanny red stapler wiggles its hinged head to the accompaniment of a
 cheery robot voice:

 Hey, this looks like the airport! You can get on a plane here and go
 somewhere else! After you purchase a ticket, after you get your
 manager's approval for vacation time, and so forth!

 The window winks away.

>go south

 Eel & Front
 It's the gateway to nTopia. The airport is north through a tall
 rectangular arch that is topped with red flashing lights. On the
 southeast corner is the visitor center. Southwest is a Starbucks.

 There seems to be no trace of whatever sand was blowing all around,
 unless some of the buildings now have a slightly glossier finish.

>go west
 You head west on Front Street...

 Abalone & Front
 Front Street is wide here, at the edge of nTopia. The airport is
 north, while two indistinguishable warehouses flank Abalone Street to
 the south.

>close nlap
 You close the nLap 500.

 A gang of perhaps twenty people on souped-up Segways powers past and
 disappears.

 You are carrying the SimulacCam (being worn), an nStick, your nLap

>go south
 You head south on Abalone...

 Abalone & First
 The clothing store Niche Threads is to the northeast, while a fire
 station is across from it on the southeast corner. To the southwest is
 the tall, cylindrical, and multicolored Medical Center Plaza. What
 dominates the intersection, though, is the swooping MuseRoom, to the
 northwest.

>go south
 You head south on Abalone...

 Abalone & Second
 Proud Pie is on the northeast corner. The multi-level grocery store to

 concrete RelOfCoTn building, a typical nWare structure. An apartment
 building, The Peachtree, is northwest.

>go northeast

 Proud Pie
 So, it's a pizza place. With a huge fake mouse in one corner. And it
 smells pretty nice.

 You head east on Second Street...

 Eel & Second
 The marquee of the Bastion Theater is northeast and the blank stare of
 0th Bank diagonally across to the southwest. Speaking of the
 Southwest, the bad Southwestern art of the Coyote and Crown howls from
 the northwest corner. A pleasant absence of city is southeast, where
 the fake hills of nTopia's park roll.

>go east
 You head east on Second Street...

 Main runs along the west edge of the nWare Media Campus. To the

>go south
 You head south on Main...

 Main & Third
 Main runs along the western edge of the nWare Media Campus. Northwest
 of here, a bit of parkland holds the nWare store, a multi-story glass
 cube. The concrete structure to the southwest, labeled "Supreme Food
 Court," is less impressive.

>go south
 You head south on Main...

 The sudden clamor and rush of a crowd sends you helplessly to the
 ground. With a grinding pull, a battalion in green aprons hurls itself
 over you and into the structure on the southwest corner. Perhaps you
 glimpse a pair of stunned figures in black T-shirts inside, shivering
 behind a counter. Your vision seems to be obscured for a moment by a
 milky steam.

 You stand, finally, unsure about what you seem to have witnessed,
 unsure about whether or not to hope it was real.

 Main & Fourth
 One corner of the nWare Media Campus is to the northeast, where a path
 affords entrance. There are Starbuckses on the other three corners.

 The sun beats down mercilessly, straining against nTopia's municipal

 Independent Grounds
 A bunch of overstuffed furniture, shipped in from somewhere other than
 Sweden, sits askew in here. There's a big sculptural object toward one
 corner that must be used for roasting coffee beans or something.

>sit
 You take a comfy seat.

 As you sat down you noticed a woman in a smart suit and guy who is
 wearing a trucker cap, apparently ironically. You can't see them now,
 but you catch a snippet of their conversation.

 "Apparently there's an escape system for government officials. The
 mayor and so on."

 "We don't have any government officials here."

 "Right. I bet they all escaped."

 Involuntarily, you turn to look at the pair. They are already
 standing, and quickly head outside and out of sight.

>use computer
 Righteous. Everything actually compiled and built successfully. You
 install the update.

 You get that satisfied feeling that you usually get after

>use computer
 Deftly you request a photo of Gus for purposes of positive ID, reset
 his account, and store in your short-term memory his
 cryptic-yet-memorable temporary password. Now you just need to share
 this important bit of information with Gus, and you'll have executed
 your responsibilities most gloriously.

 Gus stands here. He laughs at your puny gesture.

>tell gus about password
 You tell Gus his cryptic-yet-memorable temporary password.

 His face lights up with some combination of relief and prophetic
 rapture. He pulls a miniscule PDA from one of the pockets on his
 photographer's vest and taps happily, presumably gaining access.

 You get that satisfied feeling that you usually get after
 accomplishing a work-related task.

 Some glitch, neurological or digital, causes Gus to scream "ODYSSEUS"
 and run toward the exit. This involves his running right over you,
 knocking you down. Your head strikes the floor in a painless and
 consciousness-eliminating way.








 "... tests were, again, all just fine," some woman in a doctor costume
 tells you. Or maybe she is a doctor. You're both walking along an
 aqua-colored corridor now. There are pictures of semi-rigid airships
 on the walls. "You shouldn't have any problems except perhaps for a
 bit of short-term memory loss, but if you do have any other trouble,
 come back and tell it to the kiosk. Oh, and you'll want this back."
 She hands you your pager, which, annoyingly, is buzzing and vibrating.
 "Take care!"

 You find yourself here in the lobby.


 Torres Quevedo Memorial Hospital
 The shuffling of those in despair, the rapid, professional pace of the
 strained nurses and assistants, the occasional groan -- all of these
 are absent, since this pale green lobby, curiously, holds no one
 besides yourself. It's also completely without furnishings, except for
 a kiosk, placed dead center.

 Remembering the menu of health insurance options that you were
 presented, you congratulate yourself on buying the extended warranty
 on yourself.

 The pager buzzes and jars you, its motor driven to disrupt and demand
 attention.

 A window pops up in the lower right corner of your nLap. In it, the
 uncanny red stapler wiggles its hinged head to the accompaniment of a
 cheery robot voice:

 Hey, this looks like the hospital! This is where you can go if you're
 sick! If you're really sick, sometimes emergency medical workers will
 helpfully bring you here!

 The window winks away.

>touch kiosk
 As you approach, the kiosk says "If you are here because of an
 emergency, say 'EMERGENCY' or press the corresponding button."

 You touch the screen to get started, and a progression of several
 dozen windows pop up over each each other, as if you've just won a
 game of nSolitare. The one that freezes on top for a moment says "nSys
 for Kiosk Error Number n + 7. Rebooting."

 The machine blinks and returns to its original state.

 The pager vibrates like it's repeatedly tapping you to get your
 attention, and it buzzes gratingly.

>push button

 A beep issues from the pager, then a voice:

 Gus needs his password reset now. Immediately. At the current time.
 Sorry it's so early. Also, be nice to him when you walk over and
 deliver his new password, since this weekend has been rough on
 everyone. He's in F2 and I'm now having your nPediment privileges set
 so you can walk right in there and find him. Thanks for rebooting the
 machines, by the way.

 It is, of course, Wilbur.

 A beep issues from the pager, then a voice:

 This is an automatic report about how you got owned, champ. That's
 right, one of your machines is puking out denial of service packets
 and needs to be offlined immediately. Better get it off your network
 before somebody other than a robot tells you about it. The victim is
 Sophie.

 It sounds like the perky cousin of that stupid stapler.

>hold button
 The pager emits a low beep after you hold the button down for about a
 second and a half.

>examine text file
 A compulsive glance at the text file that holds your notes reassures
 you about the locations of the five servers: Wendy, at RelOfCoTn,
 Abalone and Second; Nora, in the airport; Ester, in the East Berm;
 Sophie, in City Hall, on the south end of Main; and Cindy, in F7 on
 the main campus.

 The Gap gapes on the northeast corner. A place called "Ice Planet" is
 southeast. To the southwest is a convenience store, ShopLite. The
 cheerful block of the nTopia Hospital occupies the remaining corner,
 to the northwest.

>go east
 You head east on First Street...

 Main & First
 A Starbucks is to the northeast. The post office on the southwest
 corner looks as distinguished as a mausoleum. The urban idiom fails on
 the northwest corner, where a restaurant sits like a ranch house on a
 little plot of desert. Opposite it, a path leads onto the nWare Media
 Campus.

>go south
 You head south on Main...

 Main & Second
 Main runs along the west edge of the nWare Media Campus. To the
 northwest is a Starbucks. The glass cube of the nWare Store sits on a
 park-like plot to the southwest.

>go south
 You head south on Main...

 Main & Third
 Main runs along the western edge of the nWare Media Campus. Northwest
 of here, a bit of parkland holds the nWare store, a multi-story glass
 cube. The concrete structure to the southwest, labeled "Supreme Food
 Court," is less impressive.

 A woman on an oversized skateboard zooms past, pulling a Jack Russell
 terrier on a normal-sized skateboard.

>go south
 You head south on Main...

 The sudden clamor and rush of a crowd sends you helplessly to the
 ground. With a grinding pull, a battalion in green aprons hurls itself
 over you and into the structure on the southwest corner. Perhaps you
 glimpse a pair of stunned figures in black T-shirts inside, shivering
 behind a counter. Your vision seems to be obscured for a moment by a
 milky steam.

 You stand, finally, unsure about what you seem to have witnessed,
 unsure about whether or not to hope it was real.

 Main & Fourth
 One corner of the nWare Media Campus is to the northeast, where a path
 affords entrance. There are Starbuckses on the other three corners.

>go south
 You head south on Main...

 Main & Fifth
 The building to the northeast houses "Scales," a restaurant. The
 government-looking neo-something architecture of City Hall offers an
 entryway to the southeast. On the southwest corner is "Wheel-Man," a
 personal transportation dealer. The final business here, to the
 northwest, is Mailboxes Ultra.

>se

 City Hall
 The interior walls are of parquet hardwood, which would be the most
 remarkable thing about most city halls, but here we have this
 full-size diorama in the middle of the lobby with animatrons of
 Benjamin Franklin, John von Neumann, and shellf.

 There's also a subtle door here to the southeast, which wouldn't be
 noticeable to an onlooker who wasn't in the know.

>se
 You head through the door and into the server room.

 City Hall Server Room
 There are just the usual racks here. The rest of the room is bare,
 with the usual drop ceilings and the usual raised floor providing a
 contrast to the unusual wooden walls outside. And it looks like we
 also have Sophie.

>hold button
 ( That is, "hold the server's red button." )

 You hold the server's button in a for a while, and the box whines to a
 halt, falling silent. When you release the button, the server remains
 lifeless.

 You get that satisfied feeling that you usually get after
 accomplishing a work-related task.

>go northwest
 You head out through the door.

 Court," is less impressive.

>go southwest

 Supreme Food Court
 The food court is of the same vintage as the other buildings in
 nTopia, and seems not yet drinkable. Product and process have been
 licensed all around the main chamber, where people can sit, mostly
 alone, engaging their oral arguments.

>buy food
 Food does seem like a good idea. You order some and prepare to focus
 completely on the meal, like Martha Stewart on her salad...

 A crackling sound comes, somehow, from all around.

 This is a test of the nTopia civil alert system. If this were actually
 a --

 The recorded voice breaks off.

 ATTENTION. This is actually not a test. This is an alert. Severe dust
 and wind conditions are anticipated. In a calm and orderly fashion,
 please find shelter indoors, or remain indoors if you are there
 already, and refer from going outside until further notice. Refrain.
 Refrain from going outside. Don't be nervous. High risk of death if
 you don't get indoors. Calmly. Get indoors. Immediately.

 Then there is quiet.

 You conclude your culinary experience.

 There's a granular howl from outside.

>wear helmet
 Something that you're trying to refer to either hasn't ever been
 mentioned or is not currently in the area.

>wait
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 An intriguing stranger dressed in black suddenly appears next to you
 and begins whispering, without turning to face you.

 "Don't look over. They'll see us talking."

>wait
 Time goes by.

 ( You can also use commands such as WAIT 10 MINUTES and WAIT UNTIL 10
 AM. )

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "Now, listen closely. This is important. You're new here, still not
 too damaged. I must tell you the terrible secret of nTopia."

>again
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "This whole place was built on military land -- some missile testing
 range or something."

>again
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "You've probably noticed what's going on. They're driving us insane.
 We're here as mental crash test dummies."

>again
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "It's part of the business model. Goes along with the painfully
 designed end-user application, the self-molesting hardware that calls
 the mother ship when it manages to break itself."

>again
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "They're using more advanced annoyances now. Monitoring you at all
 times to maximally bother you. Broadcasting on certain electromagnetic
 frequencies..."

 You glance over at your interlocutor and notice, for just a moment, a
 sheet of something shiny and silvery poking out from beneath the
 trendy black cap that she wears.

>examine silvery
 Something that you're trying to refer to either hasn't ever been
 mentioned or is not currently in the area.

>examine sheet
 Something that you're trying to refer to either hasn't ever been
 mentioned or is not currently in the area.

>examine cap

 "Hey, hey. Stop looking at me. They'll notice."

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "Systematically, they're figuring out how to drive us crazy.
 Non-lethal warfare. Market domination. All sorts of ways to use this
 to increase shareholder value."

>wait
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "I'm too far gone to help out on this one. I just gotta get out. Gotta
 escape. I think I have a way, but I can't take anyone with me."

>wait
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "I had to tell you about it before I went, though. Had to track you
 down. You're the last hope."

>again
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 "Save the planet, kid! The city! Company! Neighborhood! Save your
 profit center! Shut 'em down somehow!"

>again
 Time goes by.

 The harsh whistling sound continues.

 The civil alert system huffs on again.

 ATTENTION, the adverse weather conditions are over. It is safe to go
 outside now. Have fun.

 The announcer clears his throat, even though the announcement is over,
 and the speakers go silent.

 The mysterious individual rushes out, and out of sight.

>out

 Main runs along the western edge of the nWare Media Campus. Northwest
 of here, a bit of parkland holds the nWare store, a multi-story glass
 cube. The concrete structure to the southwest, labeled "Supreme Food
 Court," is less impressive. And it looks like we also have an
 enigmatic person in black.

 There seems to be no trace of whatever sand was blowing all around,
 unless some of the buildings now have a slightly glossier finish.

 The strange person who spoke to you rushes away to the south.

>go south
 You head south on Main...

 Main & Back
 Back Street runs east behind City Hall here at the south end of
 nTopia. Eel is to the west. A warehouse is on the northwest corner.

 You have come to the edge of the plateau on which nTopia is built. Far
 below, past the railing, is the desert plain, stretching from reddish
 white to white, scraggled here and there with gray. The sky is lapis
 lazuli. Some highway stretches far off from east to west, as if it
 were an imperfect reflection of a line on a map. And it looks like we
 also have an enigmatic person in black.

 The strange person who spoke to you picks up an odd-looking parcel
 from somewhere. It instantly inflates around her and forms a sort of
 giant, clear hamster-ball. Your informant moves a bit and the curious
 conveyance tips over the railing. When you look down after it -- after
 her -- there is nothing there to be seen.

>jump
 You swing yourself over, like the distinguished gymnast you once were
 in your youth, to your parents' pride. Fortunately for your shattered
 corpse, the final destructive arc of your pager leads a search team to
 what used to be you, and, thanks to the marvels of technology, those
 remnants are given a proper burial.


     *** So it goes ***


 On the last day of your working life you accomplished 8 of the 8 tasks
 assigned you.

 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score
 for that game or QUIT?
>undo
 Main & Back
 ( Very well -- we're pretending that that last command never happened.
 )

>examine sky
 The sky is a pure dome, like a clear day on The Truman Show.
