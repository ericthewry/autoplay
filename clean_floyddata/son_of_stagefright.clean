 INSTRUCTIONS:
 Welcome to S O S, Son Of Stagefright - The Sequel.  If you missed
 Stagefright, I'm not surprised.  It was written in SmartBasic to run
 on the Coleco Adam computer (5 extra points if you remember the Adam -
 10 if you owned one).  This version was completely recoded in AGT -
 which I highly recommend - and the plot redeveloped and rewritten make
 it more enjoyable.

 The object of the game is to find your way out of an old abandoned
 theater. Along the way you'll run into creaky catwalks, raging rivers,
 mini mazes, rogues, royalty, rats and a zoo keeper. You will endure
 puns, perils, pratfalls, word play, bad jokes, and a mild innuendo or
 two.  The screen will show a running account of your predicament, and
 you will enter your wishes on the keyboard.  For instance, if you are
 told that there is a wild man-eating kumquat behind the door, you
 might enter:  CLOSE THE DOOR.

 Phrase commands in a verb-noun-preposition-object order, such as THROW
 (verb) THE LITTLE BOOK (noun) AT (preposition) THE FLAMING DUCK
 (object).  DON'T use periods, question marks, etc. at the end of the
 sentence.  Commands can be combined and pronouns used for repeated
 references to the same thing:  LIGHT THE LAMP THEN GIVE IT TO THE
 BARTENDER.  If something doesn't seem to work, try re-phrasing it.
 (AND, THEN, "," and ";" can link commands)

 Pressing "?" brings up information on key assignments.  Use the
 BACKSPACE key to edit your commands.  (The LEFT ARROW key is shorthand
 for "WEST")

 Here are a few special commands:

 AGAIN, G    - REPEAT LAST COMMAND
 BRIEF       - GIVE SHORT ROOM DESCRIPTIONS
 COMMANDS    - SHOW THIS LIST AGAIN
 HELP, H     - HINTS (IF AVAILABLE)
 INVENTORY, I- SHOW INVENTORY
 LIST EXITS  - SHOW THE "ROOM'S" EXITS
 LOOK, L     - DESCRIBE "ROOM"
 QUIT, Q     - END THE GAME
 RESTORE     - RESTORE SAVED GAME
 SAVE        - SAVE GAME
 SCORE       - SHOW SCORE
 SCRIPT      - SEND MESSAGES TO PRINTER
 SHOUT       - TOGGLES SOUND ON/OFF
 UNSCRIPT    - STOP SENDING TO PRINTER
 VERBOSE     - GIVE FULL DESCRIPTIONS
 ?           - LIST OF KEY ASSIGNMENTS

 Explore and have fun with the game.  PUSH, PULL, TURN, PLAY, EXAMINE
 and READ any and everything.  There is no telling where I might have
 hidden some perverse little goodie.  Watch your score.  A jump upward
 means you're doing well.  A sudden drop probably means you just did
 something that will prevent you from completing the game.  SAVE the
 game frequently and you will be able to "backtrack" and try different
 strategies.

 If you do want to check on some point, a $5.00, one time registration
 fee will give me all the incentive I need to send a map and correspond
 on any and all aspects of the game.

 Relax and enjoy.  By my count, there are only 28 ways to die.
 (Nothing serious though, I assure you.  Only little things like falls,
 explosions, drowning, transmutations, liquification, broken heart,
 embarrassment, old age, fire, mincing and the ever popular collapsing
 room.) BREAK A LEG!

 This is your big day.  You've studied method acting, improv, mime,
 dance, movement, CPR and all the rest and now you're itching to take
 your place down center like all the famous actors and actresses before
 you.  You've heard about an audition down at the old theater at the
 lower end of the far reaches of the wrong side of...

 -Well, anyway, you thought that it had been closed after a series of
 very mysterious accidents and disappearances following their 13 week
 run of the `Scottish Tragedy'.  (If you don't know that one, just ask
 any actor.)

 When you arrive, the line of hopefuls wraps around the block. By the
 time you get signed in, the only seat left is up in the balcony.

    Hour after hour the readings drone on and on and on and   on
 and
 on                                                  *

                *                                             *

 You wake with a start.  What time is it?  Did you miss the call for
 your reading?   You hear what sounds like muffled laughter somewhere.
 Looking around for its source, it occurs to you that something is
 disturbingly wrong.

 Finally it sinks in.  There isn't a living soul in sight.  Dust and
 cobwebs are everywhere.  There is only one thought racing through your
 little brain...
                              "I WANT OUT!"

 This game was created using the Adventure Game Toolkit.

 A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 The ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) is designed to allow a game
 designer/writer to create and play his/her own high-quality text
 adventure games.  Once created, these adventure games can be shared
 with and enjoyed by others -- even if they do not have a copy of the
 Adventure Game Toolkit themselves.  Using AGT the game developer can
 create two distinct levels of adventure games:

 STANDARD LEVEL games that require no programming experience
 (honestly!!), only a fertile imagination.  These Standard Level games
 only require that the game designer/writer generates the game using a
 word processor or text editor to describe the various locations,
 objects and results of actions that collectively make up the game.

 PROFESSIONAL LEVEL games that also make use of AGT's special adventure
 game metalanguage to create games as complex and rich as the game
 designer's imagination and prose style will allow.  These games should
 be technically comparable with the published text adventure games from
 firms like Infocom.

 FEATURES OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 AGT has a number of features that make it a very comprehensive
 adventure game creation product.  Some of these key features are:

    *     "Look and feel" of Infocom adventure games with similar
 screen layout
          and standard vocabulary and routines.

    *     Large standard vocabulary with potential to define many more
 words
          unique to a specific adventure.  Typical games can have a
 vocabulary
          of 500 words or more.

    *     Sophisticated parser that can understand (1) complex input
 commands
          including pronouns (IT, HIM, HER, THEM, MY and ITS), and (2)
 compound
          commands separated by AND or THEN or punctuation symbols, and
 (3)
          commands addressed to characters within the game.  Here are a
 few
          examples of commands AGT can handle with ease:

               GET THE FLASH LIGHT AND THEN SWITCH IT ON
               PUT ON THE CLOAK, THEN EXAMINE IT; READ ITS LABEL
               PLACE THE GREEN ROCK AND THE SMALL PEBBLE BEHIND THE
 TREE
               ENTER THE HOUSE; GET ALL; EXIT; SOUTH; SOUTH THEN DOWN
               SULU, SET A COURSE FOR ALPHA 14
               SCOTTY, BEAM DOWN A TRICORDER AND THE QWERTY MODULE
               DROP THE FOOD, THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE THEN UNLOCK THE
 DOOR WITH
                    THE BRASS KEY AND THEN LEAVE

    *     Function and cursor keys predefined to input frequently used
 commands
          and move directions.

    *     SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT commands to echo game output to printer.

 WHAT THE REVIEWERS HAVE SAID ABOUT THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 "Using the Adventure Game Toolkit, anyone with an ounce of imagination
 can create a text adventure game ... similar in layout and
 sophistication to those made by Infocom and other commercial
 developers."

         -- Donald B. Trivette in PC Magazine (January 17, 1989)

 "The Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) acts as a compiler which allows for
 creating remarkably complex and sophisticated games in a fairly simple
 way .... AGT's parser reminds me of Infocom's."

         -- Scorpia in Computer Gaming World (February 1989)

 "If you have ever wondered what it is like to create your own
 adventure games, but didn't have the programming knowledge to do it,
 this product is for you .... The process is easy ... and you'll have
 hours of fun doing it."

         -- Resul DeMaria in Public Domain Software & Shareware

 "The Adventure Game Toolkit from Softworks ... provides all the tools
 you need to build your own text based adventure games .... The
 Adventure Game Toolkit is an extrememely powerful development
 package."

         -- Bob Napp in Big Blue Disk #30

 This is your big day.  You've studied method acting, improv, mime,

 your place down center like all the famous actors and actresses before

 -Well, anyway, you thought that it had been closed after a series of
 very mysterious accidents and disappearances following their 13 week
 run of the `Scottish Tragedy'.  (If you don't know that one, just ask
 any actor.)

 your reading?   You hear what sounds like muffled laughter somewhere.
 Looking around for its source, it occurs to you that something is

 Finally it sinks in.  There isn't a living soul in sight.  Dust and

 it more enjoyable.

 The object of the game is to find your way out of an old abandoned
 theater. Along the way you'll run into creaky catwalks, raging rivers,
 mini mazes, rogues, royalty, rats and a zoo keeper. You will endure
 puns, perils, pratfalls, word play, bad jokes, and a mild innuendo or
 two.  The screen will show a running account of your predicament, and
 you will enter your wishes on the keyboard.  For instance, if you are
 told that there is a wild man-eating kumquat behind the door, you
 might enter:  CLOSE THE DOOR.

 Phrase commands in a verb-noun-preposition-object order, such as THROW
 (verb) THE LITTLE BOOK (noun) AT (preposition) THE FLAMING DUCK
 (object).  DON'T use periods, question marks, etc. at the end of the
 sentence.  Commands can be combined and pronouns used for repeated
 references to the same thing:  LIGHT THE LAMP THEN GIVE IT TO THE
 BARTENDER.  If something doesn't seem to work, try re-phrasing it.
 (AND, THEN, "," and ";" can link commands)

 Pressing "?" brings up information on key assignments.  Use the
 BACKSPACE key to edit your commands.  (The LEFT ARROW key is shorthand
 for "WEST")

 Here are a few special commands:

 AGAIN, G    - REPEAT LAST COMMAND
 BRIEF       - GIVE SHORT ROOM DESCRIPTIONS
 COMMANDS    - SHOW THIS LIST AGAIN
 HELP, H     - HINTS (IF AVAILABLE)
 INVENTORY, I- SHOW INVENTORY
 LIST EXITS  - SHOW THE "ROOM'S" EXITS
 LOOK, L     - DESCRIBE "ROOM"
 QUIT, Q     - END THE GAME
 RESTORE     - RESTORE SAVED GAME

 SHOUT       - TOGGLES SOUND ON/OFF
 UNSCRIPT    - STOP SENDING TO PRINTER
 VERBOSE     - GIVE FULL DESCRIPTIONS
 ?           - LIST OF KEY ASSIGNMENTS

 Explore and have fun with the game.  PUSH, PULL, TURN, PLAY, EXAMINE
 and READ any and everything.  There is no telling where I might have
 hidden some perverse little goodie.  Watch your score.  A jump upward
 means you're doing well.  A sudden drop probably means you just did
 something that will prevent you from completing the game.  SAVE the
 game frequently and you will be able to "backtrack" and try different
 strategies.

 If you do want to check on some point, a $5.00, one time registration
 fee will give me all the incentive I need to send a map and correspond
 on any and all aspects of the game.

                               c 1989 Mike McCauley Distributed as
 ShareWare  -  Not Public Domain

 This is your big day.  You've studied method acting, improv, mime,
 dance, movement, CPR and all the rest and now you're itching to take
 your place down center like all the famous actors and actresses before
 you.  You've heard about an audition down at the old theater at the
 lower end of the far reaches of the wrong side of...

 -Well, anyway, you thought that it had been closed after a series of
 very mysterious accidents and disappearances following their 13 week
 run of the `Scottish Tragedy'.  (If you don't know that one, just ask
 any actor.)

 When you arrive, the line of hopefuls wraps around the block. By the
 time you get signed in, the only seat left is up in the balcony.

    Hour after hour the readings drone on and on and on and   on
 and
 on                                                  *
            and       *

                *                                             *

 You wake with a start.  What time is it?  Did you miss the call for
 your reading?   You hear what sounds like muffled laughter somewhere.
 Looking around for its source, it occurs to you that something is
 disturbingly wrong.

 Finally it sinks in.  There isn't a living soul in sight.  Dust and
 cobwebs are everywhere.  There is only one thought racing through your
 little brain...
                              "I WANT OUT!"

 This game was created using the Adventure Game Toolkit.

 A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 The ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) is designed to allow a game
 designer/writer to create and play his/her own high-quality text
 adventure games.  Once created, these adventure games can be shared
 with and enjoyed by others -- even if they do not have a copy of the
 Adventure Game Toolkit themselves.  Using AGT the game developer can
 create two distinct levels of adventure games:

 STANDARD LEVEL games that require no programming experience
 (honestly!!), only a fertile imagination.  These Standard Level games
 only require that the game designer/writer generates the game using a
 word processor or text editor to describe the various locations,
 objects and results of actions that collectively make up the game.

 PROFESSIONAL LEVEL games that also make use of AGT's special adventure
 game metalanguage to create games as complex and rich as the game
 designer's imagination and prose style will allow.  These games should
 be technically comparable with the published text adventure games from
 firms like Infocom.

 FEATURES OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 AGT has a number of features that make it a very comprehensive
 adventure game creation product.  Some of these key features are:

    *     "Look and feel" of Infocom adventure games with similar
 screen layout
          and standard vocabulary and routines.

    *     Large standard vocabulary with potential to define many more
 words
          unique to a specific adventure.  Typical games can have a
 vocabulary
          of 500 words or more.

    *     Sophisticated parser that can understand (1) complex input
 commands
          including pronouns (IT, HIM, HER, THEM, MY and ITS), and (2)
 compound
          commands separated by AND or THEN or punctuation symbols, and
 (3)
          commands addressed to characters within the game.  Here are a
 few
          examples of commands AGT can handle with ease:

               GET THE FLASH LIGHT AND THEN SWITCH IT ON
               PUT ON THE CLOAK, THEN EXAMINE IT; READ ITS LABEL
               PLACE THE GREEN ROCK AND THE SMALL PEBBLE BEHIND THE
 TREE
               ENTER THE HOUSE; GET ALL; EXIT; SOUTH; SOUTH THEN DOWN
               SULU, SET A COURSE FOR ALPHA 14
               SCOTTY, BEAM DOWN A TRICORDER AND THE QWERTY MODULE
               DROP THE FOOD, THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE THEN UNLOCK THE
 DOOR WITH
                    THE BRASS KEY AND THEN LEAVE

    *     Function and cursor keys predefined to input frequently used
 commands
          and move directions.

    *     SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT commands to echo game output to printer.

 WHAT THE REVIEWERS HAVE SAID ABOUT THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 "Using the Adventure Game Toolkit, anyone with an ounce of imagination
 can create a text adventure game ... similar in layout and
 sophistication to those made by Infocom and other commercial
 developers."

         -- Donald B. Trivette in PC Magazine (January 17, 1989)

 "The Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) acts as a compiler which allows for
 creating remarkably complex and sophisticated games in a fairly simple
 way .... AGT's parser reminds me of Infocom's."

         -- Scorpia in Computer Gaming World (February 1989)

 "If you have ever wondered what it is like to create your own
 adventure games, but didn't have the programming knowledge to do it,
 this product is for you .... The process is easy ... and you'll have
 hours of fun doing it."

         -- Resul DeMaria in Public Domain Software & Shareware

 "The Adventure Game Toolkit from Softworks ... provides all the tools
 you need to build your own text based adventure games .... The
 Adventure Game Toolkit is an extrememely powerful development
 package."

         -- Bob Napp in Big Blue Disk #30

 The packrat carefully inspects the PAPER that you offer, then somehow

>light lamp
  Finding a convenient wall outlet, you plug the lamp in and switch it

 and flame shoots upward, ricochets off the ceiling and back to the
 floor.  In the midst of the fire and brimstone a genie appears,
 franticly slapping out the flames on the seat of his silk pants.
 Killing the last of the embers, he turns his attention toward
 you...and to your fingers still grasping the on/off switch, then to
 you, then to his pants, then to your fingers...  Then, eyes narrowing
 to glowing red slits, he draws up to his full 5 foot 95 inch height to
 hurl a mighty thunderbolt.  And that, dear child, is how you became a
 three-headed, crab-sucking throat-warbler mangrove, and why the game
 must be terminated at this point.  You can no longer use the keyboard

 This is your big day.  You've studied method acting, improv, mime,
 dance, movement, CPR and all the rest and now you're itching to take
 your place down center like all the famous actors and actresses before
 you.  You've heard about an audition down at the old theater at the
 lower end of the far reaches of the wrong side of...

 -Well, anyway, you thought that it had been closed after a series of
 very mysterious accidents and disappearances following their 13 week
 run of the `Scottish Tragedy'.  (If you don't know that one, just ask
 any actor.)

 When you arrive, the line of hopefuls wraps around the block. By the
 time you get signed in, the only seat left is up in the balcony.

    Hour after hour the readings drone on and on and on and   on
 and
 on                                                  *
            and       *

                *                                             *

 You wake with a start.  What time is it?  Did you miss the call for
 your reading?   You hear what sounds like muffled laughter somewhere.
 Looking around for its source, it occurs to you that something is
 disturbingly wrong.

 Finally it sinks in.  There isn't a living soul in sight.  Dust and
 cobwebs are everywhere.  There is only one thought racing through your
 little brain...
                              "I WANT OUT!"

 fix it... OK. Everythink is bAc/k to nornal no w.  You can co&tinue
 wiFth the Game.

 At the East end of the catwalk you find a short ladder leading up to
 the roof.

 Suddenly, a wispy figure materializes before you dressed entirely in
 grey.  It looks you straight in the eye and whispers hoarsely , "I am
 your conscience. Aren't there other things you should be doing instead
 of wasting time on this silly game?"  With that it turns and
 dissipates before your guilt-ridden eyes.

 You suddenly bolt for the roof edge and freedom!  With a graceful
 Grande Jete', you succeed, alighting daintily on the street below.
 Looking around, you realize that you are in a dark, featureless void
 with nothing substantial beneath your feet.  Realizing that you have
 just gone outside the programed area of the game, you meekly climb
 back to "Room 56 - Theater Roof"

 You've reached the roof over the wings.  The hot sun makes you neck
 prickly. You see the top of an air shaft with a ladder leading down.

 As your fingers touch the organ stop labelled "4", you hear a scraping

 small panel has opened in the wall behind you and is already starting

 succeed in falling in a heap, jamming your head between the wall and
 the almost-closed panel.  This, however, stops its forward motion
 allowing you to pry it back enough to free your bruised scalp and
 crawl unceremoniously through before it once more hisses shut.

 This game was created using the Adventure Game Toolkit.

 A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 The ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) is designed to allow a game
 designer/writer to create and play his/her own high-quality text
 adventure games.  Once created, these adventure games can be shared
 with and enjoyed by others -- even if they do not have a copy of the
 Adventure Game Toolkit themselves.  Using AGT the game developer can
 create two distinct levels of adventure games:

 STANDARD LEVEL games that require no programming experience
 (honestly!!), only a fertile imagination.  These Standard Level games
 only require that the game designer/writer generates the game using a
 word processor or text editor to describe the various locations,
 objects and results of actions that collectively make up the game.

 PROFESSIONAL LEVEL games that also make use of AGT's special adventure
 game metalanguage to create games as complex and rich as the game
 designer's imagination and prose style will allow.  These games should
 be technically comparable with the published text adventure games from
 firms like Infocom.

 FEATURES OF THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 AGT has a number of features that make it a very comprehensive
 adventure game creation product.  Some of these key features are:

    *     "Look and feel" of Infocom adventure games with similar
 screen layout
          and standard vocabulary and routines.

    *     Large standard vocabulary with potential to define many more
 words
          unique to a specific adventure.  Typical games can have a
 vocabulary
          of 500 words or more.

    *     Sophisticated parser that can understand (1) complex input
 commands
          including pronouns (IT, HIM, HER, THEM, MY and ITS), and (2)
 compound
          commands separated by AND or THEN or punctuation symbols, and
 (3)
          commands addressed to characters within the game.  Here are a
 few
          examples of commands AGT can handle with ease:

               GET THE FLASH LIGHT AND THEN SWITCH IT ON
               PUT ON THE CLOAK, THEN EXAMINE IT; READ ITS LABEL
               PLACE THE GREEN ROCK AND THE SMALL PEBBLE BEHIND THE
 TREE
               ENTER THE HOUSE; GET ALL; EXIT; SOUTH; SOUTH THEN DOWN
               SULU, SET A COURSE FOR ALPHA 14
               SCOTTY, BEAM DOWN A TRICORDER AND THE QWERTY MODULE
               DROP THE FOOD, THE KEY AND THE BOTTLE THEN UNLOCK THE
 DOOR WITH
                    THE BRASS KEY AND THEN LEAVE

    *     Function and cursor keys predefined to input frequently used
 commands
          and move directions.

    *     SCRIPT and UNSCRIPT commands to echo game output to printer.

 WHAT THE REVIEWERS HAVE SAID ABOUT THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT

 "Using the Adventure Game Toolkit, anyone with an ounce of imagination
 can create a text adventure game ... similar in layout and
 sophistication to those made by Infocom and other commercial
 developers."

         -- Donald B. Trivette in PC Magazine (January 17, 1989)

 "The Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) acts as a compiler which allows for
 creating remarkably complex and sophisticated games in a fairly simple
 way .... AGT's parser reminds me of Infocom's."

         -- Scorpia in Computer Gaming World (February 1989)

 "If you have ever wondered what it is like to create your own
 adventure games, but didn't have the programming knowledge to do it,
 this product is for you .... The process is easy ... and you'll have
 hours of fun doing it."

         -- Resul DeMaria in Public Domain Software & Shareware

 "The Adventure Game Toolkit from Softworks ... provides all the tools
 you need to build your own text based adventure games .... The
 Adventure Game Toolkit is an extrememely powerful development
 package."

         -- Bob Napp in Big Blue Disk #30

 You READ the secret that you've been so carefully keeping under your
 hat. There is an almost imperceptible darkening of the small lens in
 the center of the wall, and with a soft whoosh, a panel swings open
 allowing you to pass.

 The hall continues South.  To the East is the one-way passage back to
 the pit.
    A deep gap looms ahead to the South.

 You inch up to the edge of the gap.  A quick check shows that your
 pulse is holding steady at its usual 72 beats per minute, so you use
 this to time the echo from a fluttering yodel.  Multiplying by the
 speed of sound in basement hallways, you easily determine that the gap
 is only 11.432 feet across and can be spanned by using the 12 foot
 plank.  You confidently plant one end of the plank in the dirt near
 your feet and let it fall until the other end hits and wedges into the
 far side, then proceed South.  You're so clever!

 You are balancing precariously on the plank over the deep gap.  Under
 your weight, the ends slip and settle into the ground, wedging them
 tighter.

 You have come to the Northern edge of the roof.  Most of the way to
 the North is blocked by the wall that encloses the high flyloft over
 the main stage area. There is a short set of steps (also North) that
 lead to a narrow upper roof.

 The afternoon sun bakes the theater roof.  Looking over the sides, you
 see nothing but deserted streets in all directions.  There is an open
 hatchway.
    You see a rainsoaked page from some book lying on the roof.

 At the East end of the catwalk you find a short ladder leading up to
 the roof.

 Suddenly, a wispy figure materializes before you in opera cloak and
 top hat. Doffing the hat in a sweeping bow, he whispers hoarsely,
 "Good evening.  I am the ghost that haunts this theater.  I actually
 have no part in this game, but I felt you would be disappointed were I
 not to put in an appearance or two." With that he stands up and
 dissipates before your incredulous eyes.

 The catwalk continues West and East.  There is a firm BULGE in the
 boards, and a mysterious wisp of GAS just dissipating above.

 The catwalk allows the techs access to the stage lighting hung above
 the audience ceiling.  You bend low to crawl along, trying not to
 think about the 30 foot drop through the flimsy structure if you
 should loose your footing.

 The hall ends with doorways to the South and the West and a ladder
 built into the East wall leads up through an access hatch into the

 The center of the vast open stage area is strangely silent.  It almost
 seems you can hear faint echoes of past performers.  There is an
 elevator built into the stage floor.  Luckily it is in the "UP"
 position now.

 You find yourself in a cramped little room with curved walls.
 Something massive occupies almost the entire area.  As you make your
 way around to the far side, you see this is the theater organ.  The
 controls for raising the entire assembly up to stage level for
 performances have been gutted and are completely unusable.  You can
 still see the narrow passage to the East.

  [ Orchestra Pit                                     Score: 9900
 Moves: 2353 ]
 As your fingers touch the organ stop labelled "4", you hear a scraping
 sound behind you.  Twisting around on the organ bench you see that a
 small panel has opened in the wall behind you and is already starting
 to re-close.  Hastily you turn to vault over the bench but only
 succeed in falling in a heap, jamming your head between the wall and
 the almost-closed panel.  This, however, stops its forward motion
 allowing you to pry it back enough to free your bruised scalp and
 crawl unceremoniously through before it once more hisses shut.

 You find yourself near the podium in the orchestra pit.  The pit
 extends to the West and there is a small, almost hidden crawl way to
 the North.
    The door to the East is securely locked.

 You arrive at a small cranny (or is it a nook?  I never know) at the
 West side of the pit.  You see, "Our Secret Place" inscribed above a
 small lens.  Looking into it, you see nothing and decide it must be
 some sort of electric eye.

 You READ the secret that you've been so carefully keeping under your
 hat. There is an almost imperceptible darkening of the small lens in
 the center of the wall, and with a soft whoosh, a panel swings open
 allowing you to pass.

 The hall continues South.  To the East is the one-way passage back to
 the pit.
    A deep gap looms ahead to the South.

 You have a small problem.  The hall narrows to the East and jammed
 into the tightest spot is a very genuine-looking guillotine.  Its
 heavy frame extends from wall to wall and from ceiling to floor.  The
 razor-sharp blade is poised high above an ominous wicker basket.  The
 only way East is through the frame.

 Watch out!  Boy, it's a good thing I warned you in time.  You would
 have been sliced in half by that blade as it fell.  I really do
 apologize.  I was so sure it was securely nailed in place.  Now you
 can't get through to the East.
