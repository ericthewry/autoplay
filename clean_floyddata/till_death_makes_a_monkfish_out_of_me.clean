 Machine Room
    The floor is a tangle of cables running from the bank of heavy
 machinery to the man-sized glass cylinder in the corner; it's like a
 blender plugged into a car-battery in a giant's world.  The whole
 arrangement looks suspiciously haphazard.

 Dr. Kurner is already here, looking like he only just got out of bed.

 The others enter behind you.  "All set, Professor?" asks Zak, clapping
 you on the back.  Taking your arm he helps you into the glass tube.
 You don't need help, but this is a Momentous Occasion.

 Inside the glass cylinder
    Cables feed away from the base of the glass to the bank of machinery
 outside, around which the scientists huddle and confer.  Inside is your
 own little fish-tank; there's a grille to put your feet on, and some
 machinery at the top, and the Emergency Door Release Switch just about
 where your left hand is.  They're all looking at you expectantly,
 perhaps waiting for a final speech before the glass slides shut...

>say
 What do you want to say?

>talk
 "Friends!  This is a momentous day!  I have prepared just a few words
 to be said on this occasion, if you will bear with me.  There is a
 saying in my country: he who eats of the plum tree must wonder why he
 ..."

 The glass door slides quickly shut.  Your view of the scientists is
 somewhat obscured by a note, taped to the inside.

>examine note
 (first taking the note)
 "Well, Professor.  I suspect that from now on you will not prove a
 problem in my life any more.  Your machine is under my control.  Shall
 we say: if you are reading this, you are already dead."

 "FIVE," booms the automated countdown voice.

>about

 Written over several months, hundreds of emails, a good few feet of
 bandwidth, and a distance of several thousand miles, this is Mike's
 second collaboration (the first was "No Time To Squeal", written with
 Robb Sherwin) and Jon's third IFcomp game.  Inspired by Roger Corman,
 Isaac Asimov and Evans' the Fishmongers; it was written "on location",
 in Cambridge, Istanbul, Galway, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, with the
 programming mostly done on a laptop in Massachusetts.

 Bugs and feedback should be emailed to jonnyingold@netscape.net and

 A huge thanks to John Bichard, tester extraordinaire.  His timely
 reports and incredible attention to detail has made this game so much
 better.  Thank you!

 Any bugs, typos, grammar gaffes or run-time errors are solely my fault.
 I probably added some "finishing touches" and neglected to have
 somebody else take a look.

 Special thanks to Mike Roberts for TADS.  I am so looking forward to
 working with T3.

 A big thank you to Stephen Granade -- I can't envision the comp without
 him.

 Most of the code is home grown, or taken from my other works.  I did
 need to borrow a couple of modules so thanks to Dan Schmidt for his
 disambig.t module.

 Because this was the first game that required some parsing hacks, I
 needed to borrow code there too.  A very big thanks to Suzanne Britton
 for her Chatter library.  Her parseAskobjIndirect routine saved me a
 lot of time and frustration.

 Last, but definitely not least, thanks Jon.  You were a pleasure to
 work with -- I'm in awe of your uncanny ability to write, create and
 problem solve.  I hope I didn't ruin the writing by adding some default
 responses here and there.  :)

 Release 2 notes

 Thanks to Paul O'Brian for his insigtful script file(s) -- numerous
 typos and default responses tweaked.  Thanks to Andrew Plotkin for
 providing different options for manipulating the Metal Rod.

>inventory
 You have a note.

>push release switch
 It's a pull switch.

 Outside all the scientists gather around the machinery, intent; tapping
 gauges and nodding seriously.  All except Dr. Kurner, that is, who
 stands off to one side, leaning heavily on a counter, staring at you.

 "FOUR."  There's a slight snigger sound just at the end; you remember
 laughing when you recorded that last week.

>pull release switch
 You tug the release.  Nothing results but a grating noise.  It's
 broken!

 "Hey - do you suppose it should be sparking like that?" Zak pipes up.
 The others tut and mutter.

 "THREE."  Power begins to build.

>examine kurner
 A sour man, five years your senior, but lower than you in rank.  You
 vaguely remember him from college but don't think you ever spoke.
 Otherwise - he was down here when you arrived.

 "And then there's quite a bit of smoke too, isn't there?"

 "TWO."  The cables on the floor wriggle like a squid.

>pull cables
 The cables aren't important.

 "Maybe we should open it up and take a look?"

 Dr. Kurner's attention is taken briefly by a school of fish passing by
 the window.  No dedication, that man.

 "ONE."  The coils at the top of the cylinder make a searing noise.

>scream
 Your words are muffled by the glass; which steams up as you shout.  You
 could probably write in the condensation with a fingertip, though.

 "Anyone got a screwdriver?"  A few pat their pockets, and shrug.

 "ZER-OH!"  The machine blasts a spurt of searing white light, as though
 your head has come off.  The scientists outside barely seem to notice
 as they hunt around for a coin to use in the screw-head.  Just as
 everything fades fuzzily to black, you see Kurner stumble himself; then
 the world slides away...








 Consciousness projection.  They'd not said it couldn't be done, but
 they had said it was pretty unlikely.  They'd not said you were mad,
 but they had said you were a little unusual, especially in your taste
 for sushi.  But you knew, if anyone down in AtlantisLab needs anything,
 it's a holiday on the surface.  Preferably a holiday as a
 twenty-two-year-old beach dweller.

 Which is where you should be right now.  It feels colder than Hawaii
 should this time of year.  You have a slight headache.  It's dark - so
 you open your eyes.

>write in condensation
 When typing or writing, you need to surround the target word in quotes;
 ie, write "in".

>write "help"
 (on the glass door)
 You write "help".

 Zak notices your message.  "I think he's talking to you, Dr. Kurner,"
 he says.  "Do you fancy lending a hand here?"

 "Hey - do you suppose it should be sparking like that?" Zak pipes up.
 The others tut and mutter.

 "THREE."  Power begins to build.

 The condensation on the glass door evaporates away.

>write "kurner"
 (on the glass door)
 You breathe on the glass door and a pool of condensation forms.  Your
 previous message "help" is now visible on the glass door.
 You write "kurner" instead.

 "And then there's quite a bit of smoke too, isn't there?"

 "TWO."  The cables on the floor wriggle like a squid.

>write "get me out"
 [One word at a time please]

>write "redrum"
 (on the glass door)
 You write "redrum" instead.

 Zak notices your message.  "Hey, guys!  I'm guessing the problem's with
 the Redrummation Mechanism!"  He winks at you.  "I learnt to read
 mirror writing in the Army, you know."

 "Maybe we should open it up and take a look?"

 Dr. Kurner's attention is taken briefly by a school of fish passing by
 the window.  No dedication, that man.

 it's a holiday on the surface.  Preferably a holiday as a
 twenty-two-year-old beach dweller.

 Which is where you should be right now.  It feels colder than Hawaii
 should this time of year.  You have a slight headache.  It's dark - so
 you open your eyes.

>look
 In a drawer, sitting up
    You are sitting up in a long metal drawer, halfway up a large wall
 of metal drawers.  Most of the others are closed; yours is open.  Below
 - about ten feet or so - is the floor of an unfamiliar room, with a
 door at the far end.  The main features seem to be metal:  metal
 ceiling, metal walls, metal piping along one side.  Coupled with the
 dim lighting, this is definitely not Waikiki Beach, by any stretch of
 the imagination.

 Your foot is itching.

>examine foot
 Tied tightly around your big toe is a tag.  It reads "John Doe."  Well,
 at least you know what name you should answer to.

>remove tag
 The toe tag is firmly attached.

>examine me
 Well, you seem to be naked.  This isn't your body either.  So
 everything's gone to plan; except this doesn't look a lot like Hawaii.

 Tied around your toe is a tag.

>get up
 You stand up.

>examine drawers
 Your drawer is empty bar you, without even a sheet, and is labelled
 "John Doe" at the front.  Looking around the others you see they're all
 labelled too - there's Jeremy Doe off to one side; Jack Doe a few
>inventory
 levels up, and the lowest down you can read is Ms. Jenny Doe; who's
 about halfway to the ground.  The surrounding drawers are all closed.

 You have nothing, absolutely nothing.  And you're cold as a
 consequence.

>open drawer
 Your drawer is already open.

>out
 The ground is too far to jump!

>open drawers
 One at a time, please.

>open jenny
 It's too far below for you to reach the handle.

>open jeremy
 You slide open Jeremy's drawer.  He's inside, asleep.  He seems to have
 a peg-leg.

>examine peg-leg
 The peg-leg is a tapering pole the length of one leg - more like a
 strut, really, or half a flamingo.

>get leg
 Taken.

>examine jeremy
 Jeremy is a large round-faced man, almost tubby, almost jovial in fact;
 apart from the missing leg which adds a sinister touch to the
 proceedings.  He is naked, and asleep, and looks very comfortable
 somehow.

>open jack
 You stand up, and can easily reach Jack's drawer to slide it open.
 Jack is inside, but he appears to be asleep.

>examine jack
 You can only really make out his feet from down here, but they're very
 still, so he must be fast asleep.

>wake jack
 Don't wake him.  He looks like he's sleeping real deeply.

>examine leg
 The peg-leg is a tapering pole the length of one leg - more like a
 strut, really, or half a flamingo.

>poke jeremy
 Poking Jeremy Doe doesn't seem to have any effect.

>open jenny
 (with the peg-leg)
 Hooking the drawer with Jeremy's leg, you slide it open.  Poor old
 Jenny rolls into view.  She looks positively knackered.

>wake jeremy
 Don't wake him.  He looks like he's sleeping real deeply.

>examine jenny
 Jenny is a red-head, and a good-looking one too.  If you weren't both
 naked, and lying in cold metal drawers halfway up a wall, you'd
 consider asking her out; just to irritate your wife.

>get in jenny's drawer
 The peg is far too cumbersome for this manoeuvre, so you first give it
 back to good old Jeremy next door.

 It's a fair way down - so first you get a solid grip on the edge of
 your pallet, and then very gradually you slide off it.  There's a
 moment of flailing before one toe meets her drawer.  Slight kick in the
 ribs - you freeze - but she hasn't noticed.  Lucky.  Next foot, you
 can't see where it's going - oops, that felt like her head; you feel
 certain her eyes must open any second, you'll hear a complaint... no,
 no, somehow you get away with it.  The next time you put it down it's
 more or less onto a clear space - bar some hair.

 You let go of your drawer, now firmly astride Jenny's, and rub your
 hands.  There's a deep shadowed groove in either palm from holding up
 your weight.

>search jenny
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine jenny
 Jenny is a red-head, and a good-looking one too.

>examine floor
 It lies beneath you.

>kiss jenny
 She'd no doubt appreciate it, of course, given that she's probably
 quite lonely here.  But you refrain, on grounds of hygiene.

>go down
 You make the final fall to the ground.

 Bottom of ramp
    This is a thin room then, between the wall of square drawers like a
 tiling and another side of sheer metal, east and west respectively.
 The floor is split-level; from where you stand a ramp leads up and
 northward, and light from a window there tumbles back down.

 The drawers stop about five feet from ground-level; below are four
 compartments.

 There is a smooth hatch set into the south wall.

>examine window
 You can't see much from here.

>examine hatch
 The hatch is about three foot square and flush with the floor.  Just by
 it is a circular recess in the wall.

>examine compartments
 The names read: Kathleen, Victoria, Charlotte and Rosalind.

>examine recess
 It's roughly ten centimeters wide and deep, and is barely a meter off
 the floor.

>look in recess
 There is nothing in there.

>open kathleen
 You slide open the compartment.  Inside is a trolley on which lies what
 is clearly a corpse.  A transparent sheet covers face down to ankles,
 like it was wrapped in cling-film.  Only the feet protrude - no tag.  A
 little horrified, you slam the compartment closed.

>open Victoria
 You quickly slide it open and shut -- same story as the other
 compartment.

>open charlotte
 You quickly slide it open and shut -- same story as the other
 compartment.

>open rosalind
 Inside the compartment is an empty trolley.

>examine trolley
 The trolley is inside the compartment.

>take trolley
>take trolley
 You can't reach it from here.

 You can't reach it from here.

>enter rosalind
 You enter Rosalind's compartment.

 Inside Rosalind's compartment
    A metal box, seven foot by four foot by five, arranged such that you
 could lie down spread-eagled but stoop when you stand.  The west wall
 is missing.  In the middle of the floor is a low flat trolley.

>enter rosalind
 You're already in the compartment.

>look west
 I don't understand that sentence.

>exits
 I don't know the word "exits".

>examine trolley
 Six feet long, three feet wide, it is essentially a tray on wheels.
 The only additions are a rubber bumper at one end and a flat metal
 rectangle at the other.  This is like the registration plate of a car,
 only blank.

>push trolley west
>examine bumper
 You push the trolley west.

 There is a smooth hatch set into the south wall.

 An arc of thick rubber, designed for shock absorbance.

>examine rectangle
 It is just smooth metal.

>touch rectangle
 It is just smooth metal.

>examine window
 You can't see much from here.

>examine hatch
 The hatch is about three foot square and flush with the floor.  Just by
 it is a circular recess in the wall.

>open hatch
>push trolley n
 The hatchway will not open, will not budge and will not slide either.

 You start pushing, but with the trolley so heavy it rolls back, and
 with it so low it's hard to get more weight behind.  In the end, you
 give up.

>get on trolley
 You lie on the trolley.  It's cold.

>look
 Bottom of ramp, on the trolley
    This is a thin room then, between the wall of square drawers like a
 tiling and another side of sheer metal, east and west respectively.

 Top of ramp
    This is a small stage, facing the stalls below down a ramp to the
 south, with the royal boxes on the wall above, reserved it seems for
 the Doe family.  You could take your bow, lit by the spotlight-glow
 through the window, or slip offstage through the door just beside it.
 Just left of the door is a small device.

>take a bow
 An article must be followed by a noun.

>bow
 Anything for a little credit.

>examine window
 Across the glass in arcing letters is emblazoned:  "YRAUTROM" (though
 the R's are a little strange).  Which is - you're quite sure - a place
 in Jordan; and not a place in Hawaii.

 It is bright in the corridor beyond, which smarts your eyes a little.

>examine device
 It's rectangular in shape and the words

 ** ERROR - Reset Required **

 are printed on the tiny display.  Near the display is a button.

 The robot positions its hexagonal tube by the trolley base with a
 muffled clang.  It then powers away up the ramp, pushing the trolley
 ahead of it.

 It's too far away.

 At the top of the ramp, the robot does something to make the door open,
 and slips through, pushing the trolley in front of it.  Then the door
 slams shut.

 At the bottom of the ramp, a robot appears through the hatch.

>examine door
 It is locked, it seems.  By the side, at shoulder height, is a black
 glass palm-scanner.  Three feet below is a circular recess and to the
 left is a small device.

 The robot - whose name appears to be Kathleen - rumbles up the ramp.

>examine robot
 This Hansome is Kathleen.  It is shaped like a square coffee-table
 resting on one side.  The two legs - or rather, arms - at the top each
 boast a shining disc, like eyes; though only one is a camera lens and
 the other is a stubby protrusion like a hockey puck.  The two bottom
 prongs are run with caterpillar tracks.  Slung between them is brown
 hexagonal tube.

 The robot inserts its hockey puck into the circular recess and opens
 the door long enough for it to power through.  Then the door slams
 shut.

 Just left of the door is a small device.

 Through the hatch appears first a trolley, then a robot shepherd.  In a
 deft volley of whirrs and flicks, it opens the Charlotte compartment
 with its extending arm and shoves the trolley inside, moving forward
 itself.  The trolley bounces off the one already inside the compartment
 and comes to a rest in the room, behind the robot.  The compartment
 door swings shut.

 The robot extends its hockey puck to an absurd length, reaching over
 the trolley in front, to clip into the recess by the door.  The
 entrance slides open, and it passes through, taking you with it.

 Once in the corridor outside, you leap from the trolley before it, and
 the robot, power away.

 Corridor
    The corridor curves southeast to southwest, smooth metal walls low
 and merging over your head.  Portholes splatter the north side like
 bullet-holes.  A neon striplight runs the length of the corridor,
 lighting round the bends on either hand, but right now your eyes are
 elsewhere - drawn to the window of the room you have just left.

>examine window
 Here it is light, and there it is dark, and the glass acts as a mirror
 over which your haggard face looms.  Only it is not your face.  It is
 the face of Dr. Kurner.  A moment of staring is not enough, and you
 stare some more.  His nose is your nose, his eyes, wet and squinting,
 are your eyes, they move as you look over them.  You feel the tightness
 of his skin around your mouth and cheekbones.  And worse: his face is
 framed, like an advert for a circus clown, by an arcing title in large
 letters:

 MORTUARY

 Dead!  Ridiculous!  You're not dead!  You're standing upright.  Indeed,
 you're breathing!  Aren't you?  There - you blow a long breath onto the
 glass, and a pool of condensation smokes it over.  Alive.  You're
 alive.  And the sooner you can get back to your machine and get
 yourself back into your own skin, the better.

 The robot pushes the trolley through the hatch in the southwest wall
 and disappears.

>examine portholes
 Through the portholes swim a variety of underwater fish, lit in the
 half-glow leaking from this dome.

 The condensation on the window evaporates away.

>write "fuck"
 What do you want to write it on?

>write "fuck" on window
 You breathe on the window and a pool of condensation forms.  You write
 "fuck".

>go west
 The robot's hatch is closed.

 The condensation on the window evaporates away.

>go east
 The airlock is closed.  And it doesn't look in good repair, either.

 Through the door appears Victoria.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 The robot opens the hatch and rumbles through.

>examine airlock
 The airlock is circular, and damaged, with loose wiring hanging from
 the frame. Set in the centre is the access mechanism, above is a small
 square spyhole.  The sight beyond it is not good - you can make out
 twisted metal, bent panels and wiring dripping from the ceiling like
 thick seaweed.  It appears not to have been breached, though, as there
 is no water.  Something moves about within: something large and orange.

>mechanism
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine mechanism
 The mechanism is a large button marked ACCESS MECHANISM.  Its functions
 are probably impaired by the sparking wiring hanging from the
 doorframe.

>examine wiring
 Two wires, crudely torn.  They spark occasionally - and are quite
 possibly live!

>connect wiring
 Of course!  If you electrocute yourself - if you die - then your
 consciousness will flip back to your original body!  It's bound to,
 after all!  And then your problem is solved! ... Though you'll still
 have to help Dr. Kurner, somehow, wherever he is.  Excellent idea.

 You steel your courage, raise your hand... and have a moment of doubt.
 Are you sure you want to do this?

>yez
 I don't know the word "yez".

>yes
 You close your eyes, and close your hand around the two ends of the
 wires.  There is a terrible sparking as electricity leaps between them,
 flowing blue lightning between your fingers, along your skin, down your
 palm!

 However, due to Dr. Kurner's plastic prosthetic wrist replacement, it
 doesn't get much further than that.  Your hand comes away, a little
 blackened.

 The airlock door slides open.

 The robot opens the hatch and rumbles through.

>yes
 It's good that you're feeling so positive.

>examine hand
 Your hand is the colour of your wife's baked potatoes.

>lick wiring
 I don't know the word "lick".

>lick hand
 I don't know the word "lick".

>taste wiring
 I don't know the word "taste".

>eat wiring
 The wires don't appear appetizing.

>examine orange
 I don't see any orange here.

>go east
 You slip through the airlock, into a mangle of metal.

 Collapsed Corridor
    This was the eastern quadrant of the dome, but something has fallen
 away and it is now a mangle of sheets of metal, intersecting skew-like.
 About halfway along, the roof is so low to the floor as to admit a mere
 few centimeters of space between.  Wiring hangs from the neon light,
 but only the first segment is still lit.  Where the corridor is most
 crumpled, one of the panels underfoot is loose, rippling out from the
 floor.  A large orange robot is whirring back and forth here.  It is
 Rosalind.

 You hear the rumbling sound of another robot in the corridor.

>examine panel
 One of the panels of flooring at the southern end of this area has
 stuck up from the floor, like the bone protruding from a broken leg;
 like a wafer in an ice-cream.

 From the corridor outside you hear the swish-snap of the robot hatch.

 Rosalind edges forward once more, away from the airlock.

>look under panel
 There's nothing under the panel.

 The robot moves on down the corridor, until it hits the fallen roof.

>examine rosalind
 She has not survived the impact, either.  Poor thing - you wonder how
 long she has been trapped here, whirring forward along the corridor
 until she can go no further, then back until caught in the pinched
 walls by the airlock.

 Rosalind whirrs slowly across the corridor.

>examine puck
 I don't see any puck here.

>get panel
 The panel is heavy, and one end is stuck in a pinch of metal, but this
 acts neatly as a hinge.  You prop it with a clang against the wall.

 Beyond is a dark hole in the flooring.  Who knows how far a drop it
 might be, how long one might tumble before finally crunching to certain
 death on the floor?

 The robot reaches the airlock, but cannot quite fit through the gap.

>enter hole
 You cross yourself once.  This is it - a long jump - air whipped from
 your mouth - certain death on a solid flooring, who knows how far down.
 You can see nothing in there, it is black.  Will they ever find this
 body?  Who can say?  You close your eyes and leap into the dark.

 And land, an instant later, in a waist-deep hole.

 In a Hole
    You are waist-high in a hole in the floor, in the middle of a
 corridor of mangled metal walls.

 You hear Rosalind's trudging footsteps.

>go down
 The only exit is up.

 You hear Rosalind's trudging footsteps.

>search hole
 You find nothing of interest.

 You hear Rosalind's trudging footsteps.  With a loud rumble, the robot
 looms over your head, filling your vision the way a cloud can blot out
 the sun.  You cower, raising your arms instinctively over your eyes, as
 Rosalind pitches forward into the hole...

 But it seems the centre of those robots is just a sheet of orange
 paper, as it rips easily when it hits your head.  A crash-smash later,
 you are standing in the debris of shattered robot, half filling the
 pit.

>examine robot
 Rosalind is in at least twelve parts, most bright orange, a few black,
 with wires spilling from several fissures.  The debris is four inches
 deep.

>examine orange paper
 I don't see any orange paper here.

>search debris
 Amongst the orange parts you find the robot's hockey-puck arm, which
 you take.

>mourn rosalind
 I don't know the word "mourn".

>examine arm
 It's a two-inch long black cylinder, as wide as your prosthetic wrist.
 One end is marked with concentric ridges - that's the end that fits the
 hatch-locks.  It must be telescopic, somehow, but you can't see a
 mechanism.

>repair rosalind
 I don't see any rosalind here.

>repair debris
 You're not skilled enough.

>pray
 You pray and feel a bit better.

>die
 I don't know the word "die".

>go up
 You scramble out of the hole.

 against the wall, revealing a promising, deep hole into the bowels of
 the dome.

>examine wrist
 I don't know the word "wrist".

>examine wiring
 The wiring is dark and dead, like the hair of a drowned mermaid.

>pull it
 The wires slip through your hands.

 You hear the rumbling sound of another robot in the corridor.

 leaking round the bends until it is cut on the west side by a
 robot-hatch, and on the east by an airlock door, which is open.

 To the south is the door back to the mortuary, a black glass panel by
 its side.

>go west
 The robot's hatch is closed.

>open hatch with pole
 I don't see any pole here.

>open hatch with stick

>open hatch
 The hatchway will not open, will not budge and will not slide either.

 Through the door appears Victoria.

>put arm in recess
 The hatch slides open for a brief moment, then slams shut.  You put the
 arm in once more, and this time, slip through.

 Curving Corridor
    The western side of the dome, and an area not designed for human
 personnel.  Robot hatches stand secure at the north and southern ends,
 the latter a little dented, perhaps in the same explosion that damaged
 the east side.  Portholes peer out in the dark, their ring broken by a
 passage to the west, opposite an open archway to the east.

 The norhern hatch flips open and out pops Victoria.  She slowly lumbers
 southward, disappearing through the southern hatch.

>go north
 The hatch is shut.

 There is a dull click.  It seems not to want to work.  There could be a
 hundred finicky mechanical reasons why.

>w#
 I don't understand the punctuation "#".

>go west
 By Airlock
    This is just a short vestibule, from the airlock to the west to the
 main corridor back east.  The airlock door is sealed, but looking
 through its panel, you can see a long corridor, leading off into the
 distance.  This must be the umbilical to the rest of the lab.

 You spot a robot trudging along the curving corridor, disappearing
 through the southern hatch.

>open airlock
 You can't quite reach the catch.

>examine airlock
 The door is sealed shut.  You can make out the opening mechanism - on
 this door it's near the top, out of reach for stumpy Dr.  Kurner and
 probably your old self too.  Set into the centre of the door is a
 viewing panel.

>examine mechanism
 Nothing fancy, just a large button that you'd need to jab.  You just
 can't reach it, that's all.

>push button with arm
 The catch is a little embedded into the wall, so the arm hits spot on
 but it isn't able to push it.

>go east
 Without something to poke that catch with - a broom handle, or
 something - there's no way through that airlock.  Hopefully you can
 find something, though; as that's the way back to the lab.

 It is locked, it seems.  By the side, at shoulder height, is a black
 glass palm-scanner.

 The robot opens the hatch and rumbles through.

>examine scanner
 Flat black glass, a panel that uses all manner of fancy beams to read
 over your palm-print and check you are who you think you are.
 Unfortunately, it's not clever enough to realise you now think you are
 someone that you actually aren't.  Or you think you are someone who
 you're not, but really are.  Or something like that.  Anyway, it's a
 pig-ignorant machine.

 Computer Core And Coffin Room
    This appears to be the hub of the Hansome's world.  Along one wall
 runs a large computer bank, over which soft lights play in colours
 tailored for electric eyes.  The far corner of the room contains a
 large glass cylinder that disappears through the ceiling; it is open at
 the bottom, where a coffin waits. The centre of the floor is taken up
 by a circular hatch marked "Waste Disposal".  The juxtaposition is
 quite unpleasant, and if too much so, you could leave back west.

>examine coffin
 The coffin is a smart black number of regular height.  It is unmarked,
 open, and waiting with a depressing certitude.

 From the corridor, you hear the sound of the robot hatch opening and
 closing.

>examine computer
 The computer has one main screen, a circular recess to serve as a
 monodigital keyboard, and a flat black palm scanner.  However, your
 gaze is taken by one larger switch, marked with beautiful portent:
 PERSONAL DETONATION DISPENSEMENT.

>inventory
 You have a robot arm.

>look in coffin

>examine cylinder
 It's glass, and stretches upwards.  During a funeral, the base seals,
 it fills with water and coffins are flushed out to be found and buried
 on land.  You'd seen it before on the designs for this place, but never
 realised they'd been so heartless as to actually build the thing.

>examine hatch
 Ah, the eco-friendly waste system.  A hatch, with a short tunnel,
 another hatch, and then the sea.  Waste goes into through one door and
 is ejected into the water.  Simple, effective, and self-cleaning.  The
 waste disposal hatch is closed, and there is no immediately obvious
 control to change that.

 setting a PERSONAL.

 Of course, it probably won't be happy with your print.  But you put
 your palm on the glass anyway.

 The computer heaves and splats.  You barely notice a squat oblong fire
 out from its base, because of a searing pain that shoots across your
 palm.  You pull back your hand, to find you have been branded!

>examine palm
 Your palm contains a brand.  Beneath it is inscribed "Press for
 detonation."

 From the corridor outside you hear the swish-snap of the robot hatch.

>press hand
 Pushing your hand doesn't do anything.

>press brand
 Your finger hovers over the contact.  Eyes to palm, eyes to bomb.  You
 can't help feeling it's a slightly extreme way to go.  But you press
 the button anyway.

 "!ERROR - PERSONAL WITHIN BLAST RADIUS!" screams a siren from just
 above your wrist.

 Of course, "black oblong" is a marketing euphemism.  It means
 "container capable of violent explosive self-destruction" or "Bomb".

 It's small, black, and judging by the way it slid across the floor,
 very heavy. There is a single red light on top which blinks
 intermittently.

 It's small, but it's heavy, and flat on the flat floor so you can't get
 your fingers underneath.  (That's not helped, of course, by the fact
 you can barely bend your left palm thanks to the brand.)

>examine parts
 Rosalind is in at least twelve parts, most bright orange, a few black,
 with wires spilling from several fissures.  The debris is four inches
 deep.

>examine arm
 It's a two-inch long black cylinder, as wide as your prosthetic wrist.
 One end is marked with concentric ridges - that's the end that fits the
 hatch-locks.  It must be telescopic, somehow, but you can't see a
 mechanism.

>twist arm

 Collapsed Corridor
    This was the eastern quadrant of the dome, but something has fallen
 away and it is now a mangle of sheets of metal, intersecting skew-like.
 About halfway along, the roof is so low to the floor as to admit a mere
 few centimeters of space between.  Wiring hangs from the neon light,
 but only the first segment is still lit.  The loose panel is propped
 against the wall, revealing a promising, deep hole into the bowels of
 the dome.

>go west
 Corridor
    The corridor curves southeast to southwest, smooth metal walls low
 and merging over your head.  Portholes splatter the north side like
 bullet-holes.  A neon striplight runs the length of the corridor, light
 leaking round the bends until it is cut on the west side by a
 robot-hatch, and on the east by an airlock door, which is open.

 To the south is the door back to the mortuary, a black glass panel by
 its side.

>examine door
 It is locked, it seems.  By the side, at shoulder height, is a black
 glass palm-scanner.

>touch palm-scanner
 It bleeps red, displaying "PATTERN NOT IN DATABANK".

 Through the door appears Victoria.

>go south
 The door is closed and locked.

 The robot opens the hatch and rumbles through.

>go west
 The robot's hatch is closed.

>put arm in recess
 The hatch opens; you dart through.

 Curving Corridor
    The western side of the dome, and an area not designed for human
 personnel.  Robot hatches stand secure at the north and southern ends,
 the latter a little dented, perhaps in the same explosion that damaged
 the east side.  Portholes peer out in the dark, their ring broken by a
 passage to the west, opposite an open archway to the east.

>examine portholes
 Through the portholes swim a variety of underwater fish, lit in the
 half-glow leaking from this dome.

 Computer Core And Coffin Room
    This appears to be the hub of the Hansome's world.  Along one wall
 runs a large computer bank, over which soft lights play in colours
 tailored for electric eyes.  The far corner of the room contains a
 large glass cylinder that disappears through the ceiling; it is open at
 the bottom, where a coffin waits. The centre of the floor is taken up
 by a circular hatch marked "Waste Disposal".  The juxtaposition is
 quite unpleasant, and if too much so, you could leave back west.

 Sitting in the middle of the floor is a black oblong, with a single red
 light on top which blinks intermittently.

>break cylinder
 You'll have to tell me how to do that.

 From the corridor outside you hear the swish-snap of the robot hatch.

>examine computer
 The computer has one main screen, a circular recess to serve as a
 monodigital keyboard, and a flat black palm scanner, slightly stained
 with your blood.  The switch for the PDD is stuck half-way down.  The
 screen is blank.

>examine recess
 Much like the others you've seen.  Around the circumference are marked
 small lines.

>put arm in recess
 You clip the robot arm into the circular recess.  The screen lights up

 Kathleen enters the room, pushing a trolley in front of it.  On the

 You clip the robot arm into the circular recess.  The screen lights up

 The robot pushes the trolley over to the coffin, performs an ingenious
 twist, and the body slides in.

>pull switch
 It doesn't budge.

 The robot flips the coffin shut.  The glass cylinder seals, and in a
 great spiral of water rather too much like a submarine toilet, the
 coffin is ejected outwards and upwards.  You can't help noticing its
 panel was never engraved.  An empty coffin slides into place, by some
 mechanism too fast for your watery eyes to follow.

 Kathleen turns tail and leaves the room, pushing its empty trolley

>examine trolley

>wait
 Time passes...

 Victoria enters the room, pushing a trolley in front of it, on which
 lies Jeremy and Jeremy's peg-leg.  It is heading for the coffin, but
 there is a sudden loud grumbling from under the floor and the robot
 stops dead.  Before you spot the connection between the trolley's
 position and the waste-disposal hatch, the trolley has been tipped up
 by a neat shudder of Victoria's lower limbs and Jeremy has slid down in
 the compartment in the floor.  The coffin remains empty, and appears
 not to have noticed that's its snack has been thrown away by the
 waiter.

 The robot motors quietly out of the room westward, leaving the trolley
 behind, lolling flat on the floor once more.  The waste-disposal hatch
 slides shut.  Or, well, almost shut.  Jeremy's peg-leg protrudes,
 obstructing the closing of the cover.

>get leg
 The hatch has gripped it obliquely, and it's trapped on something
 inside the compartment (an armpit, perhaps).

>leg it
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>open hatch
 You pull at the hatch, but don't have quite enough strength to move it
 with your hands.  Jeremy's peg-leg slides a bit toward you.

>get leg
 You lever open the hatch with the peg-leg, which finally comes free in
 your hands.

 Inside, your eyes are met by an appalling sight.  Jeremy is crumpled in
 the bottom of the compartment, whose lower door is not sealed, but
 rather filled by a thick green sludge, which oozes between his splayed
 limbs.

 And as you look down, the sludge looks up.  You leap back.

>examine sludge
 You lean back toward the hole.

 There is a surge of movement from inside the hatch, and then an
 eruption of cobalt goop as a tentacle surges out.  It feels at the air,
 back and forth like the foil of a fencer, swiping toward your face.
 You recoil, stumble, fall back flat upon the trolley.  The suckers,
 blood-tipped already, follow the sound, soon hovering mere inches from
 your face.

>push tolley
 I don't know the word "tolley".

>push trolley
 You try to jerk the trolley to move, but to do so without moving nearer
 the squid.  The net effect - fear and no motion.

 From the corner of your eye you see water bubbling in through the
 hatch, the tunnel beneath which is now held open on both ends by the
 enormous arm of the squid.  This arm sweeps the room, an inch from your
 nose, unable to find you.

 enormous arm of the squid.  This arm sweeps the room, an inch from your
 nose, unable to find you.

>get in coffin
 You are flat out on the trolley and not moving an inch higher.

>push floor with leg
 That has no effect.

 The tentacle swoops back a little, like a hawk soaring to survey.  It
 seems to have lost you.

>push trolley with leg
 You'll have to get off of the trolley first.

 The light on the black oblong winks.

 In a flash the tentacle has descended, enfolding and embracing the bomb
 and dragging it down through the hatch with it.  You breath a sigh of
 relief as it slides out of sight.

 But the waste hatch is still open, still broken, and as the tentacle
 leaves the only obstacle between the room and the sea has left too.  A
 fountain jets up into the room, catching the trolley as it splashes
 down.  You start to roll, out of the door westwards.

 Curving Corridor
    You are flat out on the trolley, which is building speed as the
 crashing water from the computer room powers behind.  You clutch
 Jeremy's peg-leg for comfort, as though it'll steer you, though you're
 clearly in the lap of luck now.

>push button
 You press the small black button.

 "!ERROR - EXPLOSIVE OUT OF RANGE!" screams a siren from just above your
 wrist.

 From the computer room comes a roar, and you see the trunk of the
 tentacle erupt once more, heading toward the only moving object it can
 find - you.

 The trolley fires further.

 By Airlock
    The trolley is cannoning westward.  The sealed airlock door
 approaches like the last view of a crash-test dummy.  You can just spot
 the opening catch, way out of reach, waiting to be pushed.

 The squid is hot on your tail, a huntsman with the waves his hounds.

>push catch with leg
 You jab wildly for the opening catch with the peg-leg as you approach
 it.  The airlock hisses, and slides open just in time for the head of
 the trolley to shoot through.

 Long Tunnel
    This is a tunnel joining the modules of the lab.  It is long,
 unmarked, a solid steel umbilical with dim lighting and no windows.
 And the floor slopes downward.

 You accelerate.  Sirens wind into life all about the corridor, and far
 ahead a flood door is beginning to lower.

 Hmm.  Someone's left a computer hotwired into a wall panel, just lying
 around in the corridor.  That's no way to access, at a guess, the
 robot's systems stored in the Mortuary block.

 You just notice these things, that's all.

>use computer
 Trolley-very-fast-squid-flood, remember?

 Behind you the tentacle is still coming.  It's almost upon you.  The
 flood door is now half-way to the floor.

 In a final surge, you crash toward the flood door, and sweep through
 just before it rams home.  There is a colossal thud from behind as the
 squid hammers into it.  But it holds.  The trolley rockets calmly into
 a wall, and you are thrown painfully, rolling further down the corridor
 where it bends to the north, head spinning with legs.  It is a while
 before you take in your surroundings once more.

 Intersection
    You're in the main module, and that means you know your way around
 with your eyes shut.  With your eyes open you can also comment on the
 decor; and note that it improves substantially to the east where the
 General has his office, to the west it probably disimproves (Kurner's
 hole is over there) and north leads toward the centre of the dome which
 means one thing - toward the room with your machine.

 Back south is a long corridor.

 Outside Kurner's Room
    The corridor continues around the curve of the base to the
 northwest, to the rooms of the various scientists.  This one is of
 interest though, perhaps - it is the door to Kurner's room - chosen by
 lottery, it is the nearest to all the machinery and so the loudest to
 be in.

 The door itself is quite a sight if you like hybridised tech - Kurner
 being the paranoiac he is has fitted it with a Russian retinal scanner,
 a thumb-reader and a voice tag detector.

 Just a microphone to read in a code-word.  Known to be temperamental
 most people don't trust these to anything you actually want to be able
 to get into.  Kurner himself always has problems because he insists on
 whispering his password.  Eventually he'll just yell "SCARECROW" and
 pretend it was a curse at the door's failures.

 Dr. Kurner's Office
    - is also his room, and it's a tip.  A bed in one corner looks
 utterly pristine, under forty or fifty large books.  The desk, facing
 onto a ubiquitous porthole, has a computer screen and keyboard set into
 it but is otherwise empty.  The floor is a seaweed-sludge of screwed-up
 paper and dirty clothing.  A door leads out south, and there's a
 bathroom annex to the west.

 From the floor one fragment of paper catches your eye.  It reads: "If

 all that electro-plasma and virus engineering was for when you'd mooted
 your Project and been booted into a whole new department.  Just goes to
 show, it seems, that even the most dedicated people need a holiday, and

 Bottom of Spiral
    The designers of this place clearly had something to prove to the
 gods of pressure - this room, unlike the cramped corridors and tight
 bunkrooms, is a wide cathedral-like dome, held up by one fat pillar in
 the centre of the floor. A smooth ramp snakes around it on a gentle
 incline up to the higher levels - no stairs here, the robots not being
 that adept - and on a normal day the floor around would be crowded with
 scientists, like worshippers at a standing stone.  However today - for
 some reason, it seems - is not a normal day.  Where is everyone?

 Corridors leave the space in all directions - Kurner's room is down the
 passage further south.

 Floor One
    You know you're in favour when your personal lab is put on the first
 level of the building.  It's behind that door to the south, the one
 only you have the key to.  Except, of course, you haven't got it,
 because you're inside the room. Or you might be.  Anyway, the door
 seems to still be open, which is handy.

 A loose panel hangs from the doorframe - it seems it's incurred some
 damage since you were last here.

 The ramp which leads back down to the main room is north.

 There's a screwdriver lying on the floor.

 A lab coat is crumpled in the corner.  You're shivering, and quickly
 put it on.

>get screwdriver
 You pick it up, noting the yellow plastic handle seems to be slightly
 charred at one end.

>examine coat
 It's pretty standard, though you note one cuff is heavily blackened and
 burnt, and there's a long slash along the back as though it had once
 been removed by a pathologist.

>examine handle
 The yellow plastic handle is charred, and a little deformed.

>examine panel
 The panel is about two inches by four, and hangs from one screw
 revealing the wiring inside.  Which, now you look, is certainly not how
 is should be.

>examine wiring
 There are two wires running under the panel, down to the keyhole.  They
 have been ripped up from their sockets, the ends bared; presumably they
 were then twisted together to make the door unlock.

 Whoever did this has since tried to repair the damage - the first wire
 is jammed back into their socket.  But with one wire connected the
 other would have been sparking with a lot of electricity.  It's
 strangely dead, now.  Perhaps the fuse was blown by a surge.

 More importantly though, someone has hotwired your door whilst you've
 been away.

>review
 (Review mode - time does not pass)

 Floor One
    You know you're in favour when your personal lab is put on the first
 level of the building.  It's behind that door to the south, the one
 only you have the key to.  Except, of course, you haven't got it,
 because you're inside the room. Or you might be.  Anyway, the door
 seems to still be open, which is handy.

 A loose panel hangs from the doorframe - it seems it's incurred some
 damage since you were last here.

 The ramp which leads back down to the main room is north.

>go south
 You enter your lab.

 Machine Room
    The room is much as you left it; a porthole above a bank of heavy
 machinery. The glass cylinder stands in one corner, aloof and empty.

 You can't help noticing with something verging on a nervous tick above
 one eye that a terminal case has had its lock smashed open.

>examine terminal
 The terminal lock has been broken, shattered off, with a few dents in
 the metal left behind.  These dents are about a half-centimeter long,
 and thin, like the blade of a screwdriver.

>look in it
 (opening the case first)
 Inside the case is all the familiar circuitry and wiring - and then one
 addition to the family.  A black plastic box sits on the base of the
 terminal, with a multi-strand wire coming out of the side, its
 connections soldered onto the circuit boards.  You recognise the
 manufacture.  It's exactly like the modules Dr.  Kurner was building
 for you, it's his characteristic habit of hiding all his work inside
 moulded boxes so no-one can see it and criticise.

 But what's it doing here?  You last checked over the machine last
 night, it wasn't here then.  In the morning - well, Kurner was already
 here, wasn't he?  So whatever happened to your machine - whatever
 you're doing in this non-sunshine state - it's his doing.  And you're
 not going to be able to get back to your own body with this machine
 unless you find out what he's done.

>get box
 The box is firmly soldered into the machine.  You'd need proper tools
 if you were going to remove it.  Probably easier, then, to get it open
 and rewire it inside.

>open it with screwdriver
 I don't know how to open the black box.

>examine cylinder
 The cylinder is all rigged up and ready from the experiment, the door
 open.

>examine box
 The box gives no clues, it's a smooth firm black.  They'll be a catch
 on it, somewhere, that's how Kurner designs these things, but quite
 where - well.  You could hunt for several hours or you could go and
 find a design plan and work it out.  That'd tell you what it was for,
 too.

>examine cylinder
 The cylinder is all rigged up and ready from the experiment, the door
 open.

>enter cylinder
 You step inside the cylinder.

 Inside the glass cylinder
    Cables feed away from the base of the cylinder.  Inside, there's the
 grille for your feet, and the Emergency Door Release Switch.

>examine grille
 The grille has no functional purpose.

>examine switch
 The Emergency Release Switch - provided in the terrible off-chance that
 the door release cover might fail, or be sabotaged, or any such.

>pull switch
 The switch does nothing - the door does not slide shut.

>out
 You step out of the cylinder.

 Machine Room
    The room is much as you left it; a porthole above a bank of heavy
 machinery. The glass cylinder stands in one corner, aloof and empty.

 One terminal case is violently unlocked.

 The ramp which leads back down to the main room is north.

>go down
 You make your way down the ramp...

 Bottom of Spiral
    The designers of this place clearly had something to prove to the
 gods of pressure - this room, unlike the cramped corridors and tight
 bunkrooms, is a wide cathedral-like dome, held up by one fat pillar in
 the centre of the floor. A smooth ramp snakes around it on a gentle
 incline up to the higher levels - no stairs here, the robots not being
 that adept - and on a normal day the floor around would be crowded with
 scientists, like worshippers at a standing stone.  However today - for
 some reason, it seems - is not a normal day.  Where is everyone?

 Corridors leave the space in all directions - Kurner's room is down the
 passage further south.

>go south
 You walk back down the corridor.

    You're in the main module, and that means you know your way around

 Back south is a long corridor.

    The corridor continues around the curve of the base to the

 lottery, it is the nearest to all the machinery and so the loudest to
 be in.

 The door itself is quite a sight if you like hybridised tech - Kurner
 being the paranoiac he is has fitted it with a Russian retinal scanner,
 a thumb-reader and a voice tag detector.

 paper and dirty clothing.  A door leads out south, and there's a

 there used to stand a potted plant, but as budget cuts meant saving on
 electricity it quickly died in the glow of forty-watt bulbs.

 In place of the plant is a Stat machine.

 On the screen is a collection of Dr.  Kurner's documents - mostly
 uninteresting; work reports, one is apparently the first draft of a
 novel called "Vengeance is my Sister".  There is one open already - and
 it catches your eye.

 It is the design for a black-box module with a multistrand wire feed
 that looks not a whole lot unlike the one plugged into your beloved
 upstairs.  You skim over the opening mechanism and make a note of it,
 before ploughing into the circuits themselves.

 Quickly the patterns form.  The search processes have been altered - no
 longer the first-mind-in-set-location pattern you'd programmed, but
 rather a nearest-to-base scan.  And the criteria - you'd demanded a
 certain age, fitness, and suntan level for your subject.  Kurner's
 level is set for ... good grief...

 That explains it then.  That box must have been in place this morning,
 when you stepped into the machine.  It's set up to find the nearest
 dead body it can and transfer.  Thinking back - didn't Kurner collapse
 when the machine fired?  Maybe he had a heart attack or something, then
 machine transferred you in.

 Only one thing to do then.  Get back to the machine, and reprogram that
 box to get you back.

 Joe the janitor saunters in from the east corridor.  "Well, there it
 is!" he exclaims.  "I've been looking for that."  He removes the
 Cosmetic from your hand with a frown of reproach.  "I know you
 scientists are the bigwigs here, but I wish you'd ask first."

 "Say, Dr. Kurner, are you ill?"  He smiles.  "I guess you're nervous
 about the Big Day.  I'll let you get on."  With that - and with the
 metal detector - he whistles his way off westwards.

 Big Day?

>go north
 You walk along a fairly long stretch of corridor, until it opens out.

 Bottom of Spiral
    The designers of this place clearly had something to prove to the
 gods of pressure - this room, unlike the cramped corridors and tight
 bunkrooms, is a wide cathedral-like dome, held up by one fat pillar in
 the centre of the floor. A smooth ramp snakes around it on a gentle
 incline up to the higher levels - no stairs here, the robots not being
 that adept - and on a normal day the floor around would be crowded with
 scientists, like worshippers at a standing stone.  However today - for
 some reason, it seems - is not a normal day.  Where is everyone?

 Corridors leave the space in all directions - Kurner's room is down the
 passage further south.

>go south
 You walk back down the corridor.

 Intersection
    You're in the main module, and that means you know your way around
 with your eyes shut.  With your eyes open you can also comment on the
 decor; and note that it improves substantially to the east where the
 General has his office, to the west it probably disimproves (Kurner's
 hole is over there) and north leads toward the centre of the dome which
 means one thing - toward the room with your machine.

 Back south is a long corridor.

>go west
 Outside Kurner's Room
    The corridor continues around the curve of the base to the
 northwest, to the rooms of the various scientists.  This one is of
 interest though, perhaps - it is the door to Kurner's room - chosen by
 lottery, it is the nearest to all the machinery and so the loudest to
 be in.

 The door itself is quite a sight if you like hybridised tech - Kurner
 being the paranoiac he is has fitted it with a Russian retinal scanner,
 a thumb-reader and a voice tag detector.

 The corridor continues northwest and Kurner's room is directly north.
 The intersection lies east.

 You climb the great spiral of the ramp, round and round until you're
 sure the ground is screwing in and you're not going anywhere...

 Floor One
    You know you're in favour when your personal lab is put on the first
 level of the building.  It's behind that door to the south, the one
 only you have the key to.  Except, of course, you haven't got it,
 because you're inside the room. Or you might be.  Anyway, the door
 seems to still be open, which is handy.

 A loose panel hangs from the doorframe - it seems it's incurred some
 damage since you were last here.

 The ramp which leads back down to the main room is north.

>go south
 You enter your lab.

 Machine Room
    The room is much as you left it; a porthole above a bank of heavy
 machinery. The glass cylinder stands in one corner, aloof and empty.

 One terminal case is violently unlocked.

>examine box
 You kneel down by the terminal case and begin to feel for the various
 catches which control the opening mechanism.  There's one - the next -
 you feel one side start to pivot round, which is a good sign.

 Suddenly there is a noise from the door.  You stand up sharply, wheel
 around.

 "Oh, hi there, Dr. Kurner!" exclaims Zak cheerily, from the doorway.
 He has a screwdriver held between his teeth and is working on something
 in the doorframe.  "Something went wrong with the door; I'm just
 refusing it.  Be with you in a second."

>ask zak about big day
 I don't know the word "big".

>ask zak about today
 I don't know the word "today".

>tell zak about me
 "Hold on a sec Doc -- almost done here," says Zak.

>ask zak about experiment
 I don't know the word "experiment".

>open box

 You freeze as Zak shouts "Morning, Professor!"  And sure enough,
 through the door enters yourself, looking spritely, excited, well.  You
 stagger back in shock against the machine, in front of the damaged
 terminal case.  There is a moment of eye-contact, but the Professor -
 you - don't seem to react.

 The others on the project enter the room and start to fiddle with the
 machinery.  As the Professor pauses to gaze in proud awe at his
 construction, Zak winks your way and whispers "Good thing I got that
 door fixed, eh?"

 "All set, Professor?"  Zak takes his arm - your arm is supporting your
 weight against the terminal due to the weakness entering your body as
 suddenly it all comes become clear.  "Nearest-search".  Any physicist
 knows "near" isn't just a three-dimensional concept.

 "FIVE".  "FOUR".

 "Hey - do you suppose it should be sparking like that?"  Zak pipes up.

 It is sparking, too, but you're not thinking about that, you're
 desperately trying to work out what happens next.

 "And then there's quite a bit of smoke too, isn't there?"

 Dr. Kurner's box wasn't well programmed enough to cope with this - with
 an empty mind-sack next to a host containing its mind.  Not only that
 but the machine is still performing it's primary search too, just
 secondary to Kurner's implanted approach.

 "Maybe we should open it up and take a look?"

 And to cap it all - you've just seen a cable at the top of the machine
 which is plugged into completely the wrong socket.

 A school of fish swims past the window.

 "Anyone got a screwdriver?"  A few pat their pockets, and shrug.

 "ZERO."








 Your eyes flip open, to a flash of your face in glass.  Then the air
 sears once more.  Bug in my program, you think.  What happens now?








 Blue
    No other way to put it.  Our myriad eyes see it a hundred different
 ways; a million little angles on the same rocks below, the same lights
 distant and near.  It all spins sickly, too much information, too much
 speed, every bit of changing direction constantly.  We are swimming,
 around in and about each other.

 heaving darkness.

 Our motion sets a rustle in the water like the waving of seaweed and
 some of the shoal tries to leave in a panic.  The darkness below is
 moving.  It's coming nearer.  It's rushing from the seabed in a motion
 like the unfolding of the earth.  It is a giant, wrapping hand, that
 our kaleidoscope eyes see from all sides and form into a huge rounded
 trunk in our mind.  The whole object encompasses us until a mouth is
 doing the same.  The rest try to swim away, finning back madly over the
 corridor toward the dome.  The shadow follows, boiling out of the sand,
 revealing its shadow full.  Sweeps over the corridor, more of us are
 lost.  We try to out-shake it.  We fail.  Flitter, flurry, fade, in
 blackness.








 Eyes open.  You feel somewhat dizzy.  You can't remember how to tie a

 Inside the Cylinder
    The glass door has slid open.  Outside, the room is empty bar for

 You step out of the cylinder.  From here you can see the screen in the
 corner of the room, which shows a giant multi-tentacled creature
 growing from over the mortuary dome, coming closer.

 Machine Room
    Your machine is in one corner, forgotten.  Dr. Kurner slumps on the
 floor, quite dead, almost forgotten too.

 The alarm is blaring.  A voice over the intercom shrieks "What are we
 going to do?  General?  WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?"

>examine screen
 The squid is coming closer, ever closer.  In a matter of minutes it
 will crush the lab.

>push button
 You jab the button on Dr. Kurner's palm and for two seconds everything
 shakes.  A stream of bubbles, like a jet passing, rips outside the
 window.  The water there turns deep red, then slowly back to blue, and
 the room falls still.

 Moments later Zak dives in.  "Professor!  You're awake!  You'd never
 believe what happened!"

 "Attacked by a giant squid?"

 "Yeah!  Um."  He frowns a bit.  "I guess you saw it on the screen.
 Hey!  Is Dr. Kurner alright?  What happened to him?"

 "He laid down his life," is your reply.  "To save the lab."

 Zak hears this, and his frown deepens.  "I guess you'd know," he
 replies uncertainly.

 *** All's well that ends well ***

    AUTHOR      - Collaboration emails between Jon and I

>author
 Don't you mean "NOTES"?  I thought so...
 From Here to There -- a Brief Time-Line

    The collaboration between Jon and I started on November 21, 2001
 when Jon responded to my personal ad on RAIF.  For the next two weeks,
 we bounced ideas back and forth and on December 11, 2001, Jon sent over
 the first script (opening scene).  By this time, we already had signed
 up for Adam Cadre's Spring Thing, with the full intention of finishing
 up this game for that comp.  We never made it.

    I started coding on 12/11/01 and we worked through the holidays.  By
 mid January we had 3 written scripts -- and two weeks later, the first
 version of the game was sent to Jon for review/testing.  It ended with
 the PC leaving the mortuary.  Apart from a small post-holiday lag, we
 were firing on all cylinders.

    Both Jon and I then, inexplicably, stopped.  We stopped emailing,
 writing and coding.  Weird.  On April 16, 2002, I sent Jon a note that
 said we should scrap the Spring Thing and possibly re-focus for the
 fall comp.  Jon agreed.  We decided to touch base in a month or so.
 For those of you keeping score, there were things going on, in both our
 worlds, that caused delays -- so we did understand how we ended up
 missing the May deadline.  Anyway...

    Did I say a month?  I meant three.  In early July, Jon and I hooked
 up again and came up with a game plan to finish this.  It had been a
 long time since the original story was discussed/created and we needed
 to re-acquaint ourselves with the premise.  I had finished
 coding/testing the game which at that point, ended with the "chase"
 scene near the computer room.  The end script was all that was left --
 well, what I thought was the end script.  Unbeknownst to me, there was
 a lot of game left to be written/coded.

    By mid July, I lined up some beta testers so that we could get a
 head start on the testing.  John Bichard and Dave Gatewood helped quite
 a bit at this point.  While waiting for Jon's final script, I was busy
 fixing bugs, typos and errant daemons.  They also questioned some of
 the story which allowed Jon to make some changes with the final script.
 They were invaluable.

    By early August, Jon had sent over the script containing Kurner's
 Office followed by the end script.  Yikes.  I had a lot of coding to
 do.  On 9/1, I finished coding the end script supplied by Jon.  For the
 next 3 1/2 weeks, we tested, tested and tested.  The hint system was
 added as an afterthought and didn't get much testing, or in the very
 least, read by the grammar police.  :)

    So there you have it -- an abridged version of how a comp game came
 to be.  Definitely took a bit longer in duration, but thinking back,
 the effort seemed about right.

 (Note that the following emails have been slightly edited so that they
 contain only references to the collaboration -- I doubt anyone is
 interested in Jon's and I personal thoughts on sex, drugs and rock &
 roll.)

 Hi Mike -

 I'm a stupidly busy person at present, but one with a hankering to
 Write Stuff, and I read that your collaboration with Robb was a
 writer/programmer split...  which I find kinda tempting, so if you'll
 have me I'd be interested.

 If you say a "storyboard", how much work is there left for writing?
 Just get the text to fill the gap, or is there design still to do?

 Cheers,
 Jon

 Jon,

 Where to begin...heh...

 With that said, how's Make It Good and your other puzzle game going?  I
 wouldn't want conflicts skewing your schedule with those games --
 that's if you had a timetable in mind.  I was looking for a spring
 release and just like that, Adam announces his Spring Thing.

 During the first collaboration note (which ended up being the NTTS
 project), I had come up with several rules of engagement that was
 needed for the project (in terms of my part) to be successful.

 I had to code it.  Writing is not my thing so what else would I do if I
 didn't code it?  The other author did most/all of the writing -- see
 point one.  It had to be in TADS.  I don't know Inform, nor do I care
 to learn another language -- I'm sorta saving that for TADS 3.  It had
 to be NTTS because it was inspired by my daughter.

 Other than that, the collaboration just grew and came to be pretty
 successful.

 With this collaboration, point 1, 2 and 3 will still be true.  I
 obviously have a different game in mind and would like to implement it,
 but I'm not closing any doors with other ideas.  And my idea of a
 storyboard is probably a lot different from that of a good writer.  I
 have a plot/theme (a hook, if you will) along with several puzzles.  I
 have an ending, but I don't care for it and it will probably change.
 It's a puzzle game.  The storyboard probably fits on one sheet of a
 legal pad.  Heh...  Are you still interested?

 Cheers,
 -- Mike

 (by the by, I can't believe you wrote AR in the time it takes my three
 year old daughter to eat a piece of toast...  That timeline couldn't
 possibly happen for this one, Jon.  I have a full time job, a wife and
 twin daughters...  ..  :)

 Hi Mike -

 I

 Hmm...  I don't have a vast amount of time, and I do have several
 projects; but that said, I am interested.  I guess the next question is
 - how long do you expect the game to be?  If we're talking Comp length
 then yeah, okay, let's do it, I can commit myself to that.  If we're
 talking longer, it might be a good idea if I pull out.  But -- but I've
 had a terrible desire to write a puzzle game ever since Mulldoon ended,
 and although I'm sort of working on one at the moment it's still
 gestating.  So having some worked out I've no objection to.

 Yes, I'm thinking/planning Comp length game that would be entered into
 this year's Spring Thing, so that's the timeline.  I just didn't want
 to give you the impression that I could manage an aggressive schedule
 (like AR) and I didn't want multiple projects impacting everything.
 So, I guess we're ready for the next step?

 I have to do a couple of things.  One, is get through this Thanksgiving
 holiday (it's today, and for a lot of my family, tomorrow as well).
 Then I need to put the storyboard in an email and shoot it off to you
 (it's currently scribbled across several pieces of paper in my work
 folder).  Once you get the plot/theme and what I'm trying to
 accomplish, we can then see if it's a match.  (Maybe you'll hate the
 idea...heh...)

 Sound like a plan?

 Hi Mike -

 Right, yes.  That's the only other sticking point as I see it - if it's
 something I *can* write, and something I *want* to write.  Otherwise,
 this sounds like fun!

 Things I should perhaps note - no aggressive schedule is likely.  AR
 was an accident like that; not one I intend to repeat if I can help it.
 The chances are you'll receive text from me in binges - great piles and
 lulls - because that's how I do things, hopefully there'll always be
 enough for you to keep to your schedule.  I usually do half of the
 writing by playing back the game-so-far and seeing what's missing (that
 is, I play like a player, to try and see what players are likely to do)
 so I'd appreciate mid-versions as they appear.  I don't know TADS at
 all, so I may miss a few verbs completely.  ;)

 But I look forward to seeing your idea and if we can make a go of this!

 Cheers, and have a good Thanksgiving,
 Jon

 From:  Mike Sousa
 To:  ji207@cam.

 Okay, here I go.  Before I get into the story, let me shed some light
 as to how I came up with the idea.  Also, I *hope* it's sorta unique --
 I've only been around for less than two years and haven't played all
 the recent games.  I've also written three and that has taken up a lot
 of 'play time' so to speak, so I typically give a game a short spin but
 rarely do I finish it.  Case in point, I *still* haven't finished
 Anchorhead, even though I've been playing it for over a year.  But
 anyway...

 I think I was playing the opening of Hunt the Wumpus and kept dying.  I
 then thought about all the games I wrote and how dying was to be
 avoided at all risk -- it was, in fact, a failure that needed to be
 undone/restored.  (heh, NTTS -- scene 1, aside).  I then thought that
 certain games won't allow you to die (you do a good job of this, by the
 way, at least from what I've seen) and come up with clever messages to
 keep the player from reaching the dreaded "You have died" screen.

 That's when I thought of a game that its primary goal was to try and
 kill yourself (and fail, multiple times).  Now, I don't want a suicide
 type of game -- that is not me, I'm an optimist by nature.  But I
 struggled to find the hook.  Why would the player want the PC to kill
 himself?  It needs to be worthwhile, because why would a player want to
 continue to try to harm the PC?  By the by, the 'puzzle' aspect comes
 in with different ways the PC tries to kill himself and because of
 Murphy's Law, he fails.  A simple example is taking sleeping pills but
 because of food poisoning (from the lunch he had several hours ago), he
 ends up throwing everything up and the suicide attempt fails.  The
 writing needs to be upbeat and have humor sprinkled in (including the
 puzzles) to keep it going.

 The hook is this:  (or some variation -- this was just the first
 attempt)

 The player character was part of a science project to clone
 consciousness.  He was supposed to go back into his own body, but the
 project was sabotaged and he was sent to the body of a corpse instead
 (with The Bad Guy presuming that would kill him).  You awake from the
 morgue / whatever and need to kill yourself in order to shunt yourself
 back to where you belong.  So starts the journey of returning to your
 body -- your wife and kids miss you, ya know!

 Here's how the story lays out:

 Opening text (needs to be well done in order for the player to 'want'
 to kill the PC so that he can return to whatever and know that the PC
 is really the consciousness and not the 'body' of the PC.)

 First puzzle is the only puzzle to the player.  Should be easy, well
 clued and set the tone for the rest of the game.

 Middle game consists of x number of puzzles (death attempts, if you
 will) that will lead to solving the final puzzle in the end.  This can
 be inventory items that appear from failed attempts or just wisdom
 gained from the failed attempts.  All puzzles can/should be accessed by
 the PC at the same time -- avoiding the linear 'thing'.

 End game is the final puzzle that gets you 'back'.  I want it to be
 elaborate, multi-staged and fit into the overall theme of the game.

 Well, there you have it.  Again, it's not a 'Jump' type of game.
 Suicide is not the message and that's an important distinction.  I just
 wanted to play with the standard 'avoid death at all costs, because
 that means you failed!'.  In this game, 'avoid staying alive at all
 costs, that means you failed!'.

 I haven't written anything yet nor do I have 1 line of code written.
 What I do have is this email and 3 or 4 death attempts with solutions
 as to how they fail along with a list of other ways that the PC could
 try and kill himself -- it just needs a solution to the 'puzzle'.

 Now, before you respond, please note that I have extremely thick skin.
 I take criticism the way it should be taken -- use it to one's
 advantage.  If you don't like the idea, the theme, or the direction, a
 simple "Not what I had in mind" can do.  Obviously, I'm interested in
 what you think and whether you see the need for any subtle/drastic
 changes to the plot or if you have something totally different in mind.
 I guess what I'm saying is that just speak what you feel and it'll be
 put to good use.

 Have a good weekend, Jon.

 As with Robb, I'll send you the complete source code directory when the
 game is released.  It'll be copyright Jon Ingold and Mike Sousa.  I'll
 probably come up with a rough project plan so we can both see the
 milestone dates and have targets to shoot for.  I like/agree with your
 playing/writing approach and that's how it worked for NTTS.

 Hi Jon.

 I gave more though to the zombie like example you had below and I don't
 know if the 'kill' yourself theme can survive the whole game.  My
 original thought was that the PC's consciousness (known as spirit going
 forward -- much easier to type) was transferred to somebody who was
 freshly dead, so to speak.  So I had visions of laying on a metal
 table, naked (save for a sheet), prep'd for an autopsy, with a tag on
 your toe that read "Jon Doe", uh, I mean, "John Doe", time of death, nn
 hours.  By taking this body over you could then be bound by 'normal'
 rules of physics when it came to attempting death.  I still like/want
 the morbid humor that can be brought, though.  So the first puzzle, as
 you mentioned, was escape from the coroner's 'office', but the
 puzzle(s) would be concentrating on finding out who you are/were
 (maybe), getting some clothes, and exiting the building without being
 noticed.  During this 'stage', a daemon/timer/trigger/whatever would
 unfold more of the story and set your goal. End this life so that your
 consci, uh, spirit can be channeled back to your body.

 Now, the framing of being murdered is good (best friend/arch rival) and
 if done by the spirit transfer science project, it lends itself to a
 happy ending because you can go back to your original body --- and it
 allows us to contemplate alternate endings in which you go back to the
 body of your arch rival or something...

 Anyway, once you leave the building, you start your journey of trying
 to kill yourself (sorta like the 9 lives things) except each death
 attempt fails because of some silly/stupid reason of murphy's law.
 That's how we (um, you) can keep the writing light and not let the
 'suicide' theme ever enter anybody's mind.

 In this scenario, the big part missing is how do you go back to your
 body.  Do you finally succeed in a suicide attempt?  Do you consult a
 psychic?  Do you find a way to send a message to your lab partner or do
 you end up visiting your 'lab' and figure it out yourself?  (yeah, just
 throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks)

 But, if you think the only way this can be pulled off is the unreal
 nature (losing limbs, macabre plot that bring teh funny, etc...)  then
 we'll need to come up with a different middle game because if the
 player knows the PC is already 'dead', they probably wouldn't want to
 continue killing it...  maybe?

 Anyway, we should decide on the angle and the resulting end story for
 it.  Then we can figure out what's the best way to work together and
 start working on the opening text/scene with the flow of the first
 puzzle(s).

 Sound like a plan?

 Jon comes up with time travel twist...

 To:
 Fr:  Jon
 Subject:  Game plans

 Hi Mike -

 Bouncing ideas back and forth is good - generates good games, generates
 *enthusiasm*.  So here are a few more.

 I like the metal table vision - actually, I like the tag-on-the-toe
 vision, that's funny; especially if we don't tell the player they've
 woken up as a corpse.  At some point maybe we could have a puzzle where
 teh PC needs to sign in somewhere/rent a car/that sort of thing, but he
 can't speak (because dead people don't breathe) so he hands over the
 tag with his name on.  Or rather, he sticks his foot on the counter
 because he can't untie the string.

 One thought I had which would be nice design wise, was a gradual shift
 in what how the player sees the game; so, to start with, he sees a
 guillotine and sticks his head inside, hoping to lop his block off
 (which fails, but somehow opens up a door somewhere else).  However,
 our player will soon realise each time is going to fail which leads to
 the nice situation of the player having to convince the PC that what
 he's being asked to do is actually a suicide attempt, when in truth the
 player doesn't expect it to work.  (so, the hook-and-noose example from
 earlier).  I think that would be nicely comic.

 I quite like the idea of coming back as the arch-rival; in fact, I was
 thinking - if we have the PC wake up as a freshly dead body, and
 scatter through the game (and maybe a short intro sequence in which the
 experiment happens, I'm a fan of run-in's in games) clues (conflicting
 + red herrings) as to who the body is.  Eventually it is revealed that
 you've woken up as who died, say, two days ago; and you have in fact
 gone back in time slightly.  You reverse your experiment, land up in te
 body of your arch rival, just in time to heft a hatchet and swing it
 into the machinery before the experiment starts...  (actually, I liked
 having a straight ghost/murder idea, just because I like the idea of
 the game ending with the PC 'coming to' dizzyily, looking around,
 seeing his former self enter the room, spotting the fire-axe on the
 wall...  game stops.  It's a cheeky ending, but quite fun.)  This would
 also open standard time-travel riffs:- our PC must fix the final step
 of the machinery which no-one knew needed doing, because when they
 arrived teh next morning it'd just been done by the PC, that sort of
 thing.  Which is to say - I'd like the time travel idea just so the
 game can end neatly, happily, but not-so-happily.  Bad guy (arch-rival)
 gets his comeuppance; only he's not really such a bad guy, as he didn't
 really do anything (we could sprinkle the game with the PC remembering
 what the arch-rival did actually do, and they could be a series of
 pathetic attacks, which have left the PC rather surprised by being
 murdered).

 Trying to gather my arms around it...

 To:  "J.  Ingold"

 Subject:  Re:  Game plans

 Let me see if I can try to recap/extrapolate what the story looks like
 now, it's probably wrong, but it's a starting point...  :)

 Short intro scene where the spirit experiment fails.  You see 'stuff',
 hints of what to do.  Your spirit is sent backwards in time to a dead
 body.  We need to validate this with some date doc in the game -- some
 world event in the newspaper or something.

 Opening scene is now limited, you wake up on the metal table with a toe
 tag.  The Player will most likely think "heh, they *thought* I was
 dead, but I'm apparently not, but who am I?"  PC solves some easy
 puzzle(s) to get into the game (editorial to start -- I'm a huge fan of
 rewarding the player right away in the opening scene so that they feel
 as if they've accomplished something and gives them an edge to continue
 playing -- nothing turns me off more than wandering around in nn rooms,
 accomplishing nothing for 30 minutes -- maybe it's just my short
 attention span.  editorial ends)

 Once the first puzzle(s) are done, the game opens up and the Player
 should know that he needs to (get back?  kill himself?  unknown -- go
 figure stuff out?)

 The middle game will consist of attempts to end one's life that fails
 or did we switch gears to something else?  (I'm trying to stay with you
 but I'm getting the feeling I drive at 80KPH and you're approaching
 100KPH!)

 The end solution is to get back to the experiment and sabotage the
 machine that sent you back.  But if this is the goal, why would the
 Player (or PC) want to continually try and kill the PC?

 I like your last paragraph in your last email, about the PC figuring
 out what to do, sorta gives the Player the "aha" moment which is one of
 the coolest things us authors can make the Player do.

 See if you can lay down the plot in terms of intro text/sequence,
 'opening scene', middle game and how it all ties up at the end.  I've
 tried to do it here but there's some confusion on my part.  Before I
 can start contributing to a story, I need to have a firm grasp of the
 story -- call it a character flaw...  :)

 Great stuff, Jon...

 The Plot Takes Shape

 An email from Jon which is the genesis of script 1

 Sent by:  jon
 To:  sousa
 Subject:  Re:  Game plans

 Hi Mike -

 Right, I was thinking this through, here's where I'm at.  I have an
 idea for something building in my head, here's the backstory but below
 I explain how it's drip-fed to the player.  You may need to print this
 out and read it carefully, I think it's quite dense, and it's pretty
 long.

 The body the PC transfers into is that of his arch-rival.  There is
 time-travel as before, but the arch-rival has died, unbeknownst to the
 player, before the start of the game.  The events run:

 The experiment proceeds.  Just as the player enters we see the
 Arch-rival putting down a fire-axe.  The experiment goes wrong.  The
 player is zapped [to the evening of the previous day] into the body of
 the arch-rival-saboteur.  He breaks into the machine's room, in time to
 sabotage the machine just as the ORIGINAL PLAYER enters.  As the
 machine kicks in, the man in the machine slumps, you slump, and you
 wake up back in your own body.  The technicians look around in a panic
 as [it seems to them that] the Arch-rival has just dropped dead
 spontaneously (because they weren't aware of the fact he was a dead guy
 wandering around).  In fact, it seems to them that the machine
 malfunctioned and killed him.  So - the player succeeds in killing the
 BODY as we originally claimed he should.  We have a happy ending.  We
 have someone, a little confused by the fact one body has died twice.
 We end the game.

 Follows a more detailed series of events/puzzles.

 ---

 Game begins with the doors sliding shut on the player's
 machine-experiment thing.  As it hisses closed an irreversible
 countdown is begun ("5...  4...")  There is a note taped to the inside
 of the (transparent) door.  The note, when the player examines it
 reads:  "I'll get you now" or somesuch.  [If we run with the plot
 detailed above, there are two choices at this point - one, we craft a
 note which can be read two ways, one is "I'll get you sonny" but it can
 also be read in its intended way; and it wasn't in fact written by any
 enemy at all.  This may be impossible, but then, it would be very neat
 if such a phrasing exists.  Two - the note was pinned before, by the
 rival himself, before he was killed.  This is a little unlikely, as why
 would he do that _before_ sabotaging the machine?  Maybe he did
 sabotage it, before he is killed, just not very well.  This is fine,
 and can be easily told to the player near the end.]  The player tries
 to escape, but cannot, tries to talk to his lab-technicians, but they
 can't hear.  If he bangs on the glass they wave excitedly.

 On count of four a lab boy says "Hey, look at this."  They all gather
 round, and very stupidly, and very slowly, speak in obvious sentences
 "Do you suppose that wire is supposed to be hanging out and sparking
 like that?".  It is made clear that some damage has been made to the
 machine, but that they're unable to do anything about it.  The player
 is forced to sit and watch, looking at his taped note, with no way out
 until he is ZAPPED.  (I think this sequence could be very funny.  I
 like the doors sliding shut with a polite note saying "You're about to
 die" -- ooh, better "If you are reading this, you are already dead.").

 Player comes to, lying in a long metal drawer in a wall of 'filing'
 cabinets (mortuary slabs, freezers, think the X-Files or that bit in
 Men In Black), where the corpse he's now in has been stored away.  On
 his toe-tag is written "Jack Doe".  We are several feet up from the
 floor, and attempting to jump down responds that it's far too far.  If
 you look around the cabinets, a few other drawers are labelled and
 mentioned:  "John Doe", "Jim Doe", "Jenny Doe"; just a handful though
 (we're not modelling an entire cabinet here, there's no need, just
 enough for the absurd image of a wall of Doe-family metal-pallets).

 The solution to getting to the ground is to pull open Jenny's cabinet
 which is below you, climb onto that, and then drop to the floor.  When
 you do, the PC comments that Jenny appears to be fast asleep, and you
 are "very careful" when you climb onto her pallet; only accidentally
 kicking her in the head when your foot slips and sitting on her chest.
 However, you stands gingerly, and "you don't seem to have woken her up.
 Phew!"  Of course, our player will quickly realise he is dead, she is
 dead, everybody's dead; but the PC continues to chatter about how they
 must have moved him here for observation after the experiment went a
 bit wrong.  (Our PC is dense, for comic value).

 We end up on the floor of the room - one wall is filing cabinet
 drawers; there's a door and a large window.  The corridor beyond the
 window is dark, so the glass acts as a mirror - and you see your
 reflection - fat, old, long grey hair.  Crucially - not as you were
 (indeed, much as your arch-rival appeared in fact.  Those players who
 recognise this similarity will smile knowingly, the rest will not have
 the resemblance pointed out.  I think it's fair to have the PC not
 comment; or perhaps just say "you look a lot like someone, but can't
 put your finger on who".  Or maybe we should just say:  "You are your
 arch-rival's clone!!!").  The PC is a little confused by this generally
 though (see note below about What The Machine Does Anyway).  At the top
 of the window is written, as spelt out by the PC, YRAUTROM.  The PC
 comments that he thought this was a place in Brazil.

 So we escape from the room, by some device available - maybe smash the
 window with something, maybe just tug the door open, something simple
 anyway (I'm tempted by a finger-print scanner and a jar of pickled
 fingers, but it's a little too-sick I think).  He leaves, the door
 swings to behind him, and he reads "Oh - MORTUARY.  That would explain
 the large bullet-hole in your chest, then."  (Or however the PC's body
 died, see note below Slight Logical Flaw).

 Now we find ourselves in a room, with an obvious device of lethal
 capability - say, an extremely large pounding machine, with a circular
 pad and a touch button that makes it go, right next to the pad.  You
 can't touch the button from the ground (it's on the other side), player
 types "Stand on pad", we move the player to the pad and have him look
 up and take a look at the incredibly large metal smashing ball hovering
 a fair distance above your head.  Any player worth his salt is going to
 push the button, there and then.  The ball is deflected somehow,
 smashing open a wall through which you can go.  But the PC comments (as
 I said before in previous email) that "maybe if you destroy this body,
 you'll go back!"

 There's a problem here though; in that I'd rather have the player
 _want_ to kill himself already, not because he is led to believe it
 will wrap up the plot, but rather he is led to believe it will take him
 somewhere new (no player will fall for the idea of such a short game as
 the "here's the shotgun.  Kill yourself and win"; but if we convince
 the player he's about to leap somewhere new, then the Murphy's-Law
 effect will be a surprise when it occurs, and funny).  To this end, we
 make the map look like it's a dead-end, so that players don't wonder
 "what's through this door, along this corridor, up this air vent?", and
 decide that exploration is reversible and death is not.  The problem
 here is suggesting that killing yourself will do anything at all
 positive, though.  I've not got an answer to that yet, something
 clue/info needs to be dropped but I don't know what.

 So an attempt fails, and the player is offered another (similarly
 restricted, we are still linear here).  On the third, I think our
 player will have realised that killing himself is not going to happen;
 and that he is being toyed with, so on the third failure we open the
 game world up and let the player into a larger area to explore.

 Now; the rules have shifted - the PC is quite convinced that he wants
 to do nothing so much as stick his head in an oven, but the player will
 be certain that it's not going to work (after all, why should it work
 now, why would the author allow it _now_, when he didn't earlier?)  So
 the aim here is for the player to come up with solutions to problems
 under the rule that they involve certain death - eg.  the gun-corridor:
 the player wants to solve it just to get through.  The PC wants to die.
 Together, we have a puzzle.  This area should be nice and wide,
 puzzle-wise, and now we drop some information as to where you are, who
 you are, and when you are.  Somewhere along the way you acquire a
 lab-coat to cover your (a) nakedness and (b) gaping hole in chest.

 The main feature of this area is a window, through which you can see
 the Experimental Machine - you are in the basement of your own lab,
 which the PC can comment he did know about, he had heard rumours they
 kept bodies for inspection here, but only ones they'd caused to be die.
 --- So we mention that the PC had heard a rumour that ARCH-RIVAL had
 been killed but he didn't believe it, especially what with him being in
 the experiment room at the start of the game.  We drop a load of hints
 about time-travel:  the day of the week, maybe, or the world event like
 you said:  someone mentions something in the first scene (and the PC
 mentions it again in passing, "Like that carnival yesterday night")
 which contrasts with a newspaper headline somewhere in the game ("The
 carnival planned for tonight...")  As before - the game tells us, but
 it is never stated.  --- I always feel, as soon as you state stuff, it
 becomes cheesier.  But then, I'm a little pathological like that, I'm
 told.  ;) Anyway, the player may realise that he is the ARCH-RIVAL'S
 dead Body, but the PC does not realise this for a second, he just
 carries merrily along, eyeing everything up in terms of its lethal
 capacity.  (eg.  "The newspaper is made of glossy paper, with almost
 razor-sharp edges".)  b Anyway, this gives the player something to aim
 for - that room with the machine in.  We have a succession of problems
 which come together to get you there; and then once there you are on a
 tight timer:

 The PC comments that one of the major circuit boards is gone - "Someone
 must have sabotaged it!  ...  but it's okay, that board is backed up
 elsewhere..."  People are arriving through the door; people including
 your former self.  There is a fire-axe against the wall.

 I don't know how we convince the player to smash the machine with the
 axe.  If he remembers the beginning like a true time-travel junkie
 he'll do it on instinct, and it'll be a nice
 player-guesses-random-thing-that-works-moment.  Otherwise, we could
 contrive something:- the people open the door, you instinctively duck
 to hide, knocking the fire axe off the wall.  It hits the machine,
 breaking it, bounces and as you pick it up they enter, seeing you with
 axe.  Then the machine is operated (in a chunk of text, there's nothing
 left for the player to do) and we have our ending.

 So, how does this hold up?  Problems?  Things you don't like?  The
 important design ideas are:  We drip-feed information to the player and
 change his view throughout, rather than setting up a "here's the idea.
 go play" situation.  We make the PC quite dumb, for comic value.  We
 pull a last punch.  ;)

 Main problems I see:  How do we insinuate that suicide might prove
 useful in a continuation-sense rather than a concluding-sense?  How do
 we make the player want to sabotage his own machine at the end?

 Jon

 -----

 A few further notes:

 What The Machine Does Anyway:- I'd like the player not to be told what
 the experimental machine is actually _for_.  There's no reason to
 include it in the intro - it can just be a "generic science artefact"
 and then come the end the player will have assumed we have conciousness
 transferal going on.  Then we could have a nice joke with PC casually
 mentioning toward the end that the machine's purpose is much more
 mundane - say, it fixes colour-blindness, perhaps.  Whatever.  It need
 not make too much sense; it's effectively just a one-liner.  There's no
 reason to be too pedantic on "realism"/"explanation", so long as the
 player is given adequate guidance at each stage of the game.

 Slight Logical Flaw:- The player wakes up in a body which has died.
 Now, we ask what's killed it?  If it's anything external (so, as above,
 a bullet-wound in the heart) then the player is not going to think of
 killing the body because the body is clearly _not alive anyway_.  He's
 only going to consider hanging himself/poisoning himself/etc if the
 body actually has some appearance of functioning biologically.  In
 which case, what the hell did our body die of?  It ought to be clear
 that it _was dead at some point_ I think.  Perhaps we have a bullet
 wound, with the rest of the body "alive around it - you can feel a
 pulse, you're breathing, it's just that at some point in your chest
 pink fades to grey and there's this ragged hole.  Weird."

 The setting is, uhm, set.

 Sorry for the duplicate email, server issues at work...

 We never did brainstorm on the title of the game.  It stands now as

 Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish out of Me (or, TDMAMOOM).

 I'm thinking the game needs a smaller title.  No, I don't have one ;)
 -- but I could start thinking of one.  I'm thinking about the last 5

 Wonderland, Photopia, The Edifice) -- okay, that has *nothing* to do
 with them winning, but still...

 I guess it goes to how our game will be reference in short (TDMAMOOM,
