 The staticky voice on the PA was wrong - you should have sheltered in
 place.  Moving your students wasn't easy, even before Jude yelled "Mr.
 Bunny!", dropped Samir's hand, and went scrambling back down the
 hallway.  You slipped up and swore, but no one heard it in the chaos.

 Overhead, the inbound planes were unleashing chaos of their own.
 There were seals against airbornes in most of the installation, but
 not in the school.  Emily was ahead of you, so the toxin hit her
 first.  She doubled over retching and then fell down.  You inhaled to
 call out to your students, but then the toxin was in your lungs.

 Burning in your lungs.  Throwing up as if you would never stop.
 Children screaming, scattering.

 The ground shaking.  You wrenched your head up to see the wall
 collapse.  A wave of heat and light.  Wasn't the gas enough?  Why did
 they need incendiaries too?

 Adam must be up there somewhere, scrambling to respond.  As above, so
 below - unless he was puking his guts out too, unless he couldn't
 breathe either -

 It was a good time to pass out, so you did.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 You open your eyes.  Everything aches, but the hallway eventually
 comes into focus.

 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hall</span>
 This was the approved route to shelter, before the bombs hit and the
 ceiling collapsed.  Now, shards of plastic and glass jut from the
 rubble, and more than one corpse lies buried beneath the weight of
 stone.  Heavy debris lies half-propped upon long pieces of rebar,
 creating a hazardous barrier that blocks the way north.  The way south
 remains open.

 To the west, more debris blocks off the door to Avery Thomas's
 classroom.

 The air raid sirens have stopped, but fire alarms still flash and
 shrill through the wreckage.  It's not much of an improvement.

 You have to find your students.

>examine

 What do you want to examine?

>examine me

 You feel, unsurprisingly, like a building fell on you, and you're sure
 that your appearance matches the feeling.  Constant tremors run
 through your hands, and it's an effort just to stay standing.  But
 there doesn't seem to be any blood, and that's something.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(You can also think about many things, such as THINK ABOUT</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">yourself.)</span>

 You are wearing a striped red tie, a rumpled white shirt, some pair of
 black slacks, and a gold wedding band.

>think about me

 You feel worse than you've ever felt, including the time when you were
 seventeen and three guys kicked the shit out of you just for existing.
 Maybe now hurts more because it's happening right now... but it's a
 bad sign.

>inventory

 You are wearing a striped red tie, a rumpled white shirt, some pair of
 black slacks, and a gold wedding band.

>think about ring

 You don't want to think about that right now.

>think about spouse

 You don't want to think about that right now.

>think about wife

 You don't want to think about that right now.

>think about avery

 The kids love Avery Thomas, but he doesn't deserve it.  He hates
 teaching elementary, and he mutters in the teacher's lounge about how
 kids are only worthwhile once they grow up.  He probably daydreams
 about beaning a kid with a chunk of rock quartz someday.

>examine band

 It's a thin gold band, a little scratched, unobtrusive.  And very
 important.

>think about band

 You wanted a custom ring, but Adam talked you out of it.  "We'll get
 something simple, classic," he said.  Unspoken: something it would be
 safer to wear.

>shout

 You shout, "Hello!  Can anyone hear me?"

 You hear a crash from the direction of Mr. Thomas's classroom,
 followed by silence.

>examine debris

 You take a closer look at the pile of debris, but what you see only
 makes your spirits sink.  The pile of debris blocking the door is
 unstable and heavy, definitely too dangerous for you to shift it.

>examine corpse

 There's no room for doubt: the closest body is Emily Wagner.  Her
 torso is completely obscured, but you can see the patterned edge of
 her skirt, and you recognize the strappy sandals she was wearing.

>search corpse

 You find nothing of interest.

>heternormativity off

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine shards

 Which do you mean, the plastic shard or the glass shard?

>glass

 The glass shards look like they came from a door's broken windowpane.

>get it

 You don't need it, and you might hurt yourself trying to pull it out.

>examine plastic

 The plastic shards look like they came from the shattered panel on a
 light fixture.

>get it

 You don't need it, and you might hurt yourself trying to pull it out.

>talk to door

 You can only do that to something animate.

>go west

 You try to stand up, but misjudge your own weakness and almost fall
 into the rubble.

 You remain still for a moment, breath burning in your throat, and wait
 for the strength to try again.

>again

 You grit your teeth and get successfully to your feet.  You've never
 been so proud of just standing before... well, maybe after that fourth
 JÃ¤ger Bomb at Nellie's.  But it feels like college was about a hundred
 years ago.

 The pile of debris blocking the door is too dangerous to shift.

>think about school

 Seeing the school in ruins makes you feel very fragile.  You didn't
 love the place - the architecture was weird, and the administration
 was frustrating, and the mural at the hallway junction was seriously
 ugly.  But now it's been destroyed, and perversely, you feel
 abandoned.

>think about emily

 Emily Wagner was in your classroom when the warning siren went off.
 She was helping to get your kids out when the bombs hit.  She didn't
 approve of you, and you didn't approve of her methods all the time,
 and you bitched about her behind her back - but she was good with kids
 and she gave a damn.  You don't want her to be dead.

 You shout, "I have to be away for a moment, but I'll come back soon."

 Samir yells, "Go away, leave me alone!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall Junction</span>
 Fire alarm lights strobe across a painfully cheerful mural on the east
 wall, positioned exactly opposite the west-facing hallway.  The
 classrooms and the gymnasium are off to the west, the science and
 computer labs are north, and the cafeteria is off to the south, but
 you can see from here that no part of the building went unravaged.  At
 least it looks like most of the kids made it out.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 There's a bulletin board lying face-down on the floor.

>think about Samir

 One day, he's helping Dylan cement his reign of terror, and the next,
 he's helping George build the ISS out of Tinkertoys.

 Left to his own devices, you think he might be a bit of a bookworm,
 but it's hard to tell.  Despite your best efforts, school is a poor
 place for self-discovery.

>examine board

 This bulletin board was once mounted on the north corner, but the
 explosions jarred it loose.  It's not much of a loss.

 It's one of those multiracial sunshine-and-handholding jobs that
 school administrators particularly love, even at a base school.  The
 colors are particularly toxic under the flickering fire alarm lights.

 As always, I would like to thank my playtesters for their intensive
 support, including Danielle Church, Brie Frame, Jason Hoggatt, Emma
 Joyce, Colin Sandel, and one additional party who prefers to remain
 anonymous.

 Special thanks go to Wendy Misuinas for answering my questions about
 the military brat experience and for pointing me in the direction of
 additional research material.  Any errors here are assuredly mine
 rather than hers.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Ollie Ollie Oxen Free</span> is an interactive fiction game by
 Carolyn VanEseltine.

 In this game, you take the role of a story's protagonist.  The
 computer provides the game world; it will inform you about what you
 can see, hear, smell, feel, and sense in any other ways.  You can
 respond to the game's environment by typing commands into the parser.
 For example, you can:

 - move around (WEST, GO DOOR, STAND ON TABLE, etc.)
 - investigate yourself (INVENTORY, EXAMINE ME, etc.)
 - investigate your environment (EXAMINE DEBRIS, LOOK ON DESK, LISTEN,
 SMELL, etc.)
 - interact with objects (GET PAPER CLIP, OPEN DRAWER, PUSH TABLE,
 etc.)
 - ask people to perform tasks for you (example: TYRONE, OPEN DOOR)
 - and perform important out-of-game functions (SAVE, UNDO, RESTORE,
 HELP, etc.)

 The OOxF command cueing system will attempt to provide timely,
 non-spoilery indicators about game syntax as you play.  Other commands
 that may be of use:

 ABOUT - Provides more information about the history and creation of
 the game.
 VERBS - Provides a list of verbs recognized by this game.
 HINT - If you're having trouble, type HINT to get a hint.
 WALKTHROUGH - In extremis, you can use WALKTHROUGH to get a solution
 for your specific situation.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cafeteria Hall</span>
 This part of the hall has been plastered with signs in unsubtle red,
 white, and blue, occasionally accented with yellow smiley-face
 stickers.  The overhead lights are flickering weakly here, and the
 power probably won't last long.  The hall continues south toward the
 school kitchen and north toward the classrooms.

 The cafeteria doors are to the east, but they're closed and probably
 locked, since lunch ended a good two hours ago.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>examine signs

 The patriotic virtues extolled here include playing nicely with others
 and never running in the hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Cafeteria Hall</span>
 With the overhead fluorescents out, it's particularly dim at this end
 of the hallway, but the flashing fire alarms illuminate the door
 labelled "KITCHEN STAFF - NO STUDENTS".  To your surprise, it's partly
 open.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>examine door

 The school kitchen door is unusually wide, perhaps because there's no
 alternate loading door for the kitchens.

 Looking down, you see a plastic tray wedging the door.

>examine tray

 This is one of the orange plastic trays that the kids use to carry
 lunch to their tables.

>get tray

 You're not sure whether the kitchen door locks automatically.  It's
 probably better to leave it propped open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">School Kitchen</span>
 You've never been in the school kitchen before.  The kitchen has no
 windows, and without the overhead lights, it's seriously dark here.
 Counters and shelves are barely discernable glints in the blackness.

 Why isn't there a fire alarm in the kitchen?  It would make sense -
 and it would mean you could see, no matter how poorly.  But there are
 only flickering reflections from the west doorway, almost worse than
 nothing in the darkness.

>exits

 From here, you can try going north into the cafeteria, west into the
 hallway, or up down the big dark tunnel.

>examine shelves

 The shelves are barely a glint of steel in the darkness.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Locker Hallway</span>
 The locker-lined hallway stretches from east to west.  Pictures of
 famous Americans gaze starchily down from above the dull brown
 lockers, almost successfully concealing the old water damage on the
 walls.  You can smell something burning.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>examine lockers

 The lockers are narrow, brown, and about four feet tall.  Every
 student gets a locker on their first day, along with a lecture about
 how they are strictly forbidden to decorate the lockers or change
 their locker combinations.

>open lockers

 You check one of the lockers, but, as you suspected, the locker is
 locked.

 There's a combination lock that could be used to enter a combination,
 if you knew any of the locker combinations - which you don't right
 now.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Emily's classroom is - was - to the north, marked with a construction
 paper sign reading "Ms. Wagner's room - Come In!"  To the south,
 there's an alcove that splits off toward the bathrooms.  The hallway
 continues to the east and west, decorated with inexpertly drawn
 posters about When I Grow Up.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>examine posters

 The posters are from Emily Wagner's class.  At the top, each one bears
 the crooked heading, "When I Grow Up, I Will Be A...." followed by a
 crayon-and-marker drawing to represent the aspired profession.
 Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of airplanes and little stick figures
 with carefully drawn insignia, including an unlikely number of
 generals and chief master sergeants.  However, you also see a
 ballerina, a firefighter, a teacher (William Bradley is a notorious
 suckup), and a unicorn rancher.

>think about william

 William Bradley, notorious suckup.  Either he'll grow an opinion of
 his own someday, or he has a glowing future ahead as President of the
 United States.

>think about samir

 One day, he's helping Dylan cement his reign of terror, and the next,
 he's helping George build the ISS out of Tinkertoys.

 Left to his own devices, you think he might be a bit of a bookworm,
 but it's hard to tell.  Despite your best efforts, school is a poor
 place for self-discovery.

>think about dylan

 It would be an easier world if the bullies all had names like Biff and
 Brick and Grunt.  Dylan Rierson is your least favorite kid in school
 right now, and you predict a round in juvie for him before he's
 sixteen.

>think about george

 His mom was an astronaut candidate.  She died in a car crash, which is
 why George lives on base with his dad, but George either forgets that
 or won't admit it most of the time.  His art projects are littered
 with women with recognizable cornrows waving hello out of rocket ship
 windows.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ms. Wagner's Room</span>
 This classroom is reasonably undamaged, apart from a fallen ceiling
 tile.  The decorations are straight out of the 70's, all giant
 cardboard apples and smiling cartoon children, occupying not only the
 walls but the front of Ms. Wagner's desk.  The air smells of markers
 and chalk dust.

 You can see a closet door and an enormous blackboard here.

>open closet

 It seems to be locked.

>exits

 From here, you can try going north into the supply closet or south to
 the hallway.

>examine desk

 This desk is smaller than most teacher desks at the school, but it's
 sturdy and well-made, which is more than can be said for a lot of the
 furnishings.  Also, it's possible to remove the desk from the room
 without disassembling it.

 On Ms. Wagner's desk are a decorated mug (in which are some pens and
 pencils) and a round blue tray (in which is a tangle of paper clips).

>take paperclip

 You fish a striped green paper clip out of the tangle.

>unlock closet with paperclip

 (the striped green paper clip)
 There's no way you can pick a lock.  Your hands are trembling far too
 much.

 The striped green paper clip falls from your shaking hands to the
 floor.

>take paperclip

 (the striped green paper clip)
 Taken.

>put paperclip in pocket

 (the striped green paper clip in the left pocket of your slacks)
 You put the striped green paper clip into the left pocket of your
 slacks.

>open desk

 That's not something you can open.

>examine board

 The blackboard currently contains a list of countries in Western
 Europe, with extra notes about Luxembourg (capital - Luxembourg,
 largest city - Luxembourg, official languages - French, German, and
 Luxembourgish).

>write on board

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>draw on board

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine pockets

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine pocket

 These aren't very good pants - they're a little faded from repeated
 washing, and there's a hole that makes the right pocket unusable.  You
 still wear them because at least the hole isn't visible.

>examine mug

 The red and blue lettering proclaims "#1 Teacher!"  It's full of pens
 and pencils.

 rubble, and more than one corpse lies buried beneath the weight of
 stone.  Heavy debris lies half-propped upon long pieces of rebar,
 creating a hazardous barrier that blocks the way north.  The way south
 remains open.

 To the west, more debris blocks off the door to Avery Thomas's
 classroom.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fountain Alcove</span>
 The failing fluorescent lights illuminate a kid-height drinking
 fountain in the south wall.  The boys' bathroom is to the east and the
 girls' bathroom is to the west, both marked with Happy Hygiene signs
 reminding everyone about handwashing.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 It's hard to be sure in this light, but it looks like there's a wet
 spot on the carpet by the door to the girls' room.

>examine happy hygience

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the Happy Hygiene
 sign.

>examine wet spot

 That spot is definitely wet.

>examine happy hygiene

 It's in the style of those old recruitment posters - "Harry the Happy
 Hand wants YOU to wash your hands!"  There are happy girls waving at
 Harry on the girls' room sign and happy boys waving at Harry on the
 boys' room sign, just to avoid any mixups.

>touch spot

 That spot is definitely wet.

>smell spot

 It's actually hard to inhale on purpose - memories of the toxic gas,
 probably.

 A burning, acrid smell overlays the usual odors of the school.

>shout

 You call, "Hey, can anyone hear me?"

 A student calls back from the girls' bathroom.  "Mr. Ginsberg! I can't
 get up!"  It's Keiko, and her voice sounds tight and strange.

 You also get a response from the boys' bathroom.  "Help me!" a boy
 calls, "That asshole Dustin wedged me in here!"  It sounds like Tyrone
 - he's supposed to be in Emily Wagner's class, not yours.

 (<span class="floydstyle em">You can ask students to perform tasks with [student], [command].</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">For example, KEIKO, LOOK will ask Keiko to tell you what she can see</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">right now.)</span>

>think about keiko

 Keiko is the oldest of your students.  She's been held back twice now,
 not because she's stupid, but because the school isn't prepared to
 handle a kid with dyslexia.  They're moving her up this year come hell
 or high water... or so you would have said, before the school was
 bombed.  Right now, you don't even know who's alive, let alone who's
 graduating.

>think about tyrone

 Tyrone isn't one of your students.  You know him because he's been
 giving Emily a headache and a half, not to mention the recess
 monitors.  He's bright enough to get pissed off and destructive in a
 classroom geared to the lowest common denominator, and he pounds back
 on the kids who try to pound him, which doesn't help anything much.
 He's pretty well-behaved in detention, though.

>think about dustin

 If Dustin weren't so quick to help beat people up, he'd be the one
 getting beat up.  You try to keep this in mind, but you still don't
 feel much sympathy.

>keiko, look

 You call, "What can you see, Keiko?"

 Keiko shouts back, "Can't you just come in here?  The door's open!"

>enter girl's room

 You can't see any such thing.

>go west

 You call, "I need to do something, but I'll be back as soon as I can."

 "Come back soon!" Keiko calls.  Tyrone doesn't answer.

 (first opening the girls' door)
 The door has a push panel, so you lean on the door, but nothing
 happens.  Briefly, you wonder if the door is blocked - but it's just a
 measure of your weakness.  The hinges yield a moment later, and the
 door opens.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Girls' Bathroom</span>
 You've never actually been in the girls' bathroom before, but it has
 the same ugly cream-and-black tile as the boys' room does, plus all
 the accoutrements you'd expect - sinks, a mirror, stalls, the works.
 Or so you surmise, because half the back wall collapsed in, and
 there's now water spraying across the room from a burst pipe and
 pooling on the floor.

 Keiko is sitting on the bathroom floor.  Her hair and clothing are
 soaked from the spraying water.

 Keiko looks up at you miserably.  "I got out from under the bricks,
 but I can't get up.  I tried, but my leg won't work.  It hurts so
 bad."  She points to her right leg.

 You say inarticulately, "Keiko.  It's going to be okay, I promise."
 But you don't know how, because you're pretty sure her leg is broken.

>examine bricks

 This morning, there was a solid, sturdy wall here, and now it's a
 shattered heap of masonry.  It hardly seems real.

 The girls' room door hisses closed on its hinge.

>examine leg

 Which do you mean, Keiko's right leg or Keiko's left leg?

>examine right leg

 There's a nasty scrape partway down Keiko's right shin, and a gruesome
 bulge in the flesh beneath it.  You're not well versed in first aid,
 but you're pretty sure that it's broken.

 Keiko breathes through her teeth for a moment.

>amputate right leg

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to emily

 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to keiko

 What do you want to talk to Keiko about?

>leg

 Which do you mean, Keiko's right leg or Keiko's left leg?

>right leg

 You ask, "Keiko, what happened to your leg?"

 Keiko says, "I tried to hide in here, like during a tornado drill, but
 the ceiling fell on me.  I got my leg out, but it really hurts and I
 think something's really wrong."

>talk to keiko about break

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>talk to keiko about amputation

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>talk to keiko about death

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>talk to keiko about bomb

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>ask keiko about teacher

 Which do you mean, the half-buried corpse or the teacher desk?

>ask keiko about desk

 Which do you mean, the cheap wooden desk, the massive steel desk, the
 teacher desk, Ms. Wagner's desk, or the desk drawer?

>get keiko

 You take Keiko's hand, squeeze it reassuringly, and then let go again.

 Keiko breathes through her teeth for a moment.

>drag keiko

 In the movies, people always pull the leg straight before splinting
 it.  In real life, you're not so sure about this at all.  You'll need
 something long and straight (a broom, maybe?), and something to fasten
 it in place.  You also need something to use for a crutch, because
 Keiko is the biggest of your students, and you're too weak to support
 her yourself.
>go east

 (first opening the girls' door)
 With a massive effort of will, you pull open the door to the girls'
 room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fountain Alcove</span>
 The failing fluorescent lights illuminate a kid-height drinking
 fountain in the south wall.  The boys' bathroom is to the east and the
 girls' bathroom is to the west, both marked with Happy Hygiene signs
 reminding everyone about handwashing.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 There's a wet spot growing on the carpet near the door to the girls'
 room.

>go east

 (first opening the boys' door)
 You pull, but the door won't open.  Looking down, you see a small
 rubber wedge jammed under the door.

>take wedge

 The small rubber wedge is jammed tightly under the door, and your
 shaking fingers don't have the strength to pull it out.

 You hear a hard thump from the boys' bathroom door, suggestive of
 someone kicking it from the other side.

 You shout, "And lay off kicking the door!"

 Tyrone says unrepentantly, "Yes, Mr. Ginsberg."

>kick wedge

 You think dark and terrible thoughts about the small rubber wedge.

>tyrone, get wedge

 You shout, "Tyrone, can you please grab that wedge?"

 Tyrone calls, "How'm I supposed to get it from this side?  It's on
 your side of the door!"

>tyrone, look

 You call, "Tyrone, tell me what you can see around you?"

 Tyrone yells back, "I see a wedge!  A wedge that won't let me get this
 damn door open!"

>tyrone, push wedge

 You shout, "Tyrone, can you push the wedge out from your side of the
 door?"

 Tyrone calls back, "I tried, but I can't get it to move!"

>Tyrone, inventory

 You call, "Tyrone, what have you got with you?"

 Tyrone calls, "I don't think I have anything."

 You call back, "Okay, that's fine.  Let me think for a minute."

>tie tie to wedge

 You'd give a lot for some rope right now.  But lacking any, you'll
 have to proceed without it.

>remove tie

 You struggle with the knot, but your hands are shaking so much that
 you can't loosen it.  You give it up as a bad job.

>give paperclip to tyrone

 (first taking the striped green paper clip)
 You give the striped green paper clip to Tyrone.

>tyrone, push wedge with paperclip
>tyrone, push wedge with paperclip

 Tyrone shouts, "I don't know how to do that, the wedge is bad for
 pushing!"


 Tyrone calls, "I don't know how to do that, the wedge is bad for
 pushing!"

>tyrone, give clip to me

 Tyrone won't understand those instructions.  You need to rethink your
 strategy.

>tyrone, look

 You call, "Is anything broken, or leaking, or on fire?"

 Tyrone calls back, "No, nothing like that.  Just the wedge." He sounds
 worried now.  "Is there, like, fire and stuff out there?"

 You call, "I'm going to get you out safe.  Hang on."  It seems better
 than answering his question.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Emily's former classroom is to the north, marked with a construction
 paper sign reading "Ms. Wagner's room - Come In!"  To the south,
 there's an alcove that splits off toward the bathrooms.  The hallway
 continues to the east and west, decorated with inexpertly drawn
 posters about When I Grow Up.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The wall buckled a bit here, but didn't collapse entirely - unlike to
 the west, where outright wreckage is visible by the gym entrance.
 Colorful leaf rubbings and magazine mosaics hang drunkenly off their
 moorings.

 The door to the art classroom - your classroom -  hangs open on its
 twisted doorframe.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>exits

 From here, you can try going north into the art room, east along the
 hall, or west toward the gym.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Art Room</span>
 This was your classroom - the art room, mostly, but also where you had
 homeroom and study hall and sometimes detention.  A gaping hole in the
 wall provides unexpected access to Mrs. McCaskill's room, where it
 looks like the sprinklers are going off.  Tissue paper trees line the
 intact east wall of this room, striving to brighten the desolation.

 You left a long table shoved up against the west wall.  Now, that
 table supports half the rubble from the collapsed wall and partially
 blocks your access to the gaping hole.

 The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

 Jude sits on the ground beside the rubble-strewn table, peering
 miserably into the darkness underneath.

 Jude looks up at you tearfully.  "I can't get him out, Mr. Ginsberg!
 He's stuck under the table!"

>think about jude

 Like several of your other kids, Jude is "suddenly military", and she
 hasn't taken the change well.  Her mom has been at wits' end dealing
 with her, which is why she's allowed to keep her bunny in class for
 now.

>examine jude

 Misery crinkles Jude's face like an old woman's.  Her dark eyes have
 swollen from tears, and her nose is smeared with mucus.

 Jude is wearing a lime green shirt, a brilliantly colored My Little
 Pony backpack, and a pair of flower-embroidered overalls.

>ask jude about bunny

 You ask, "Jude, tell me about your bunny?"

 Jude sniffs, "His name is Mr. Bunny!  He's very important, my dad gave
 him to me, and I really need him back!"

>examine bunny

 Jude's favorite stuffed animal is awkwardly big, purple, furry, and
 rather in need of a wash.  He always reminds you of a prize from the
 fair.

>look under table

 Jude's Mr. Bunny is wedged far back under the table.

 It's easy enough to put two and two together - you told the students
 yesterday that there would be painting today, so she put Mr. Bunny
 somewhere safe.  And then the wall collapsed over the table, and now
 it'll be a serious problem getting him out.

>lift table

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>jude, follow me

 You ask, "Jude, would you please hold hands with me?"

 Jude takes your hand.
 <span class="floydstyle em">(To stop leading a student around, RELEASE that student.)</span>

>examine desk

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine trees

 It's not a complicated project - cut out brown construction paper
 trees, draw bark on them in black marker, and then glue colorful
 tissue paper leaves on the branches.

>think about mccaskill

 Jenny McCaskill teaches English to kids being raised by TV.  It's a
 thankless job and it's probably killing her soul, but she dutifully
 hauls out the latest Macmillan recommendations every year.  She also
 performs a number of quasi-administrative tasks, such as collecting
 roll call sheets and handing out locker combinations.

>open backpack

 You say, "Jude, I need to see your backpack for a moment."

 You open the brilliantly colored My Little Pony backpack.

>look in backpack

 You say, "Jude, hold still so I can look at your backpack."

 The brilliantly colored My Little Pony backpack is empty.

>examine hole

 You see nothing special about the gaping hole.

>look through hole

 You find nothing of interest.

>crawl through hole

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>exits

 From here, you can try going south to the hallway or west through the
 hole into Mrs. McCaskill's room.

>go west

 You say, "I'm going to need both of my hands for this," and drop
 Jude's hand.

 Despite your trembling hands, you scramble successfully over the table
 and through the gap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mrs. McCaskill's Room</span>
 Half the ceiling has fallen, crushing the west side of the room
 beneath debris and blocking the door entirely.  The water sprinklers
 spew frantically, turning papers and decorations to mush, but it
 doesn't do much good - despite the acrid stench, whatever's burning
 isn't actually in this room.  Still, the water might be reducing the
 smoke.

 A gaping hole in the east wall allows you back into your classroom, if
 you scramble over the rubble-strewn table in the way.  The north wall
 is in similarly poor state, and you might be able to go that way.

 A crumpled poster projects from the rubble, mostly sheltered from the
 sprinklers by a fallen corkboard.

 Water flows down the legs of the cheap wooden teacher's desk to the
 growing puddle on the floor.

>examine poster

 It depicts all the past presidents of the United States.  So far, the
 presidents have avoided death by water, but the delay of sentence is
 only temporary.  Rutherford B. Hayes looks worriedly at the coursing
 droplets.

>examine desk

 Jenny McCaskill's desk is a cheap wooden affair.  The locking metal
 drawer bolted onto the right side was clearly an afterthought, but
 it's all that saves her from having no drawers at all.

>examine bunny

 Jude's favorite stuffed animal is awkwardly big, purple, furry, and
 rather in need of a wash.  He always reminds you of a prize from the
 fair.

>take bunny

 There's too much debris in the way, and you can't fit your arm through
 the gap.  Mr. Bunny is still out of reach.

>open drawer

 It's either locked, or jammed beyond your current strength to unjam.
 Locked seems more likely.

>pick lock

 What do you want to pick the metal drawer with?

>papercli

 You can't see any such thing.

>pick lock with paperclip

 (first taking the striped green paper clip)
 There's no way you can pick a lock.  Your hands are trembling far too
 much.

>put paperclip in pocket

 You put the striped green paper clip into the left pocket of your
 slacks.

>scream

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>pray

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>xyzzy

 Teleportation would be fantastic right about now.

>go north

 You lean through the gap into the north room - Mr. DeWitt's room, you
 think, but the chokingly thick smoke makes it hard to tell.  The
 sprinklers aren't working in here, and there's even greater structural
 damage than you've already seen.  This isn't a viable exit.

 You retreat back to Mrs. McCaskill's room.

>think about dewitt

 Paul "Do It" DeWitt teaches basic math at the elementary, and his wife
 Marianne teaches trig and calculus at the elementary.

>think about me

 You feel worse than you've ever felt, including the time when you were
 seventeen and three guys kicked the shit out of you just for existing.
 Maybe now hurts more because it's happening right now... but it's a
 bad sign.

>think about adam

 Thinking of your husband is both comforting and painful.  He must be
 up in the air right now, raining righteous fury over whichever bastard
 was in that plane.  He'll keep you safe, just like you'll keep your
 kids safe.

>examine corkboard

 The sprinklers have destroyed whatever was pinned to this corkboard,
 leaving disintegrating pages and illegible smears of ink behind.

>examine puddle

 The puddle on the floor is growing by the minute.

>move poster

 It's not worth it.

>go east

 Despite your weakened muscles, you scramble successfully over the
 table and through the gap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Art Room</span>
 This was your classroom.  A gaping hole in the wall provides
 unexpected access to Mrs. McCaskill's room.  Tissue paper trees line
 the intact east wall, striving to brighten the desolation.

 You left a long table shoved up against the west wall.  Now, that
 table supports half the rubble from the collapsed wall and partially

 The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

 Jude sits on the ground beside the rubble-strewn table, peering

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The wall buckled a bit here, but didn't collapse entirely - unlike to
 the west, where outright wreckage is visible by the gym entrance.
 Colorful leaf rubbings and magazine mosaics hang drunkenly off their
 moorings.

 The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The air reeks of smoke and chemicals.  To the south, two large double
 doors lead into the gymnasium.  Mrs. McCaskill's classroom used to be
 accessible to the north, but there's no going that way now.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>exits

 From here, you can try going south into the gym or east along the
 hall.

>go south

 Thankfully, one of the double doors is open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gymnasium</span>
 The elderly gymnasium looks relatively unscathed.  Since this room
 doubles as an auditorium, stacked bleachers line the north wall.  The
 door to the equipment room is west, and the locker room is south.  The
 double doors leading back to the hallway are north.

 Blue exercise mats are piled to one side.  Two have been separated
 from the pile and layered over the base of a pommel horse, and others
 are arranged around a balance beam.

>examine mats

 They're standard exercise mats, designed to protect kids when they
 fall down in gym class.

>examine horse

 It's a standard pommel horse - two handles, two poles, and broad metal
 feet at the bottom to keep it from falling over when it's being used.

>examine beam

 It's a standard gymnastics balance beam, with a slightly roughened,
 non-slip surface.

>examine bleachers

 Stacked up the way they are, the bleachers form a solid extension of
 the wall.  There aren't even any sizeable gaps between the bleachers.

>examine poles

 It's a standard pommel horse - two handles, two poles, and broad metal
 feet at the bottom to keep it from falling over when it's being used.

>pull poles

>take poles
>get poles

 Lifting the pommel horse would be far too taxing for you.  However,
 it's narrow enough to go through the doorway, so if you got at least
 two students together, they might be able to drag it out of the room.

 <span class="floydstyle em">around.)</span>


 Lifting the pommel horse would be far too taxing for you.  However,

>mount horse

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Locker Room</span>
 Heavy wooden benches separate long rows of battered green gym lockers.
 Everything smells like old socks in here.  The coach's office is over
 to the east, and the gym is back to the north.

 The gym office door is closed.

 A old boombox sits quietly on one of the wooden benches.

>examine boombox

 (the boombox)
 Straight out of the 80's - make that the 90's, since it has a CD
 player instead of a cassette tape.  There's a battery compartment on
 the back.

 The boombox is currently switched off.

>shout

 You shout, "Hello!  Can anyone hear me?"

 A shaggy boy's head pops up at the window of the gym office door,
 "It's me, George!" he hollers through the door.  "I'm here!"  His
 voice is a little muffled, but still quite audible.

 You say, "Let's get you out of there, George."

>open door

 It seems to be locked.

>think about george

 His mom was an astronaut candidate.  She died in a car crash, which is
 why George lives on base with his dad, but George either forgets that
 or won't admit it most of the time.  His art projects are littered
 with women with recognizable cornrows waving hello out of rocket ship
 windows.

>ask george about door

 (the gym office door)
 You shout, "George, tell me about the door."

 George shouts through the door, "Um... I don't know what you mean...
 it's just a door."

>george, look

 You call, "Hey, George?  What can you see in there?"

 George sounds puzzled.  "It's Mr. Lewis's office."

>think about lewis

 Jack Lewis is the gym coach.  He won't give you the time of day, but
 he cares about sportsmanship and he cares about his kids, and that's
 why you only ever call him Jackass Lewis in private with Adam.  (Well,
 that and a strong desire to keep your job.)

>george, unlock door

 (with the oversized T-shirt)
 George might have trouble fitting the oversized T-shirt into the lock
 on the gym office door.

>george, i

 You call, "George, do you have anything useful?"

 George hollers through the door, "I don't think I have anything."

 You shout back, "Okay, that's fine.  Let me think for a minute."

>george, take off shirt

 Some people are confused about the difference between gay people and
 pedophiles.  That confusion leads to good teachers being fired every
 day.  There must be a way to get your students out without feeding
 that fire.

>look in window

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine window

 There's a small window in the gym office door, through which you can
 see mostly George.

>wave

 You already have George's attention.

 You wave, feeling foolish.

>break window

 You think dark and terrible thoughts about the gym office door.

>shout

 You shout, "Stay calm, we're all getting out of here."

>george about office

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask george about office

 You shout, "George, tell me about the door."

 George shouts through the door, "Um... I don't know what you mean...

>george, break window

 There's no point in asking.  George isn't strong enough to break the
 gym office door.

>examine door

 There's a small window in the gym office door, through which you can
 see mostly George.

>george, exits

 [That command asks to do something outside of play, so it can only
 make sense from you to me. George cannot be asked to do this.]

>george, i

 You call, "George, what have you got with you?"

 George hollers through the door, "I don't think I have anything."

 You call back, "Okay, that's fine.  Let me think for a minute."

>george, s

 Running the layout of the school through your head, you don't think
 George can go south from where he is.

 You could ask him to go west to the gym lockers.

>george, w

 You shout, "George, can you open the door?"

 George shouts, "No, I need pants!   You have to bring me pants!"
 <span class="floydstyle em">(You can get more information from students by asking them about</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">things, such as ASK GEORGE ABOUT PANTS.)</span>

>ask george about pants

 (the pants)
 You call, "George, what happened to your pants?"

 George shouts through the door, "I had an accident!"

>remove pants

 No.  When the rescuers come, you want to have pants on.  God only
 knows what they'd say if you didn't.

>asj george about lockers

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask george about lockers

 (the gym locker)
 You shout, "Do you mean your gym locker or your regular locker?"

 George hollers through the door, "My regular locker!"

>ask george about combination

 You call, "George, what's your locker combination?"

 George shouts through the door, "I can't remember."

>tell george I cannot help him, then.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine lockers

 Judging by the number of dents, it's common practice for students to
 come back in here and kick the crap out of the lockers after gym.

>kick lockers

 You think dark and terrible thoughts about the gym locker.

>open compartment

 You open the battery compartment of the boombox, revealing some
 Duracell D-cell batteries.

>george, get all

 black wire wastebasket: To avoid confusing George, ask about one thing
 at a time.
 lacrosse stick: To avoid confusing George, ask about one thing at a
 time.
 soggy pants: To avoid confusing George, ask about one thing at a time.
 George: To avoid confusing George, ask about one thing at a time.

>put batteries in pocket

 The Duracell D-cell batteries doesn't fit in your pocket because the
 striped green paper clip is already in there.  (These pants never had
 much in the way of pockets.)

 (first taking the Duracell D-cell batteries)

 You pry the Duracell batteries out of the boombox.

 You put the Duracell D-cell batteries into the left pocket of your
 slacks.

>george, x pants

 You shout, "George, tell me about the soggy pants."

 George hollers through the door, "They're pretty gross."

>george, get stick

 You call, "George, would you please get that lacrosse stick?"

 George shouts through the door, "I can't reach it, the desk is in the
 way!"

>george, x desk

 You shout, "George, tell me about the desk."

 George hollers through the door, "Um... I don't know what you mean...

 You shout, "George, can you unlock the door if you use Mr. Lewis's

 After a pause, George hollers through the door, "None of these keys
 fit the lock!"

 You call back, "Okay, thanks for trying."

 You shout, "George, could you please take that lacrosse stick?"

 George lifts the lacrosse stick down from the wall.  "Got it!" he
 announces.

 You say, "All right, you can get down now."

 George slides down from the desk.


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>george, wear pants

 You can't quite picture how George would wear the soggy pants, and
 probably neither could he.

>examine door

 There's a small window in the gym office door, through which you can
 see mostly George.

>george, throw keys out window

 You shout, "George, can you throw Mr. Lewis's keys at the door?"

 George hollers through the door, "I hit the door, but nothing
 happened!"

>open lockers

 Through willpower alone, you force your hand to stop shaking long
 enough that you can grasp the gym locker's handle.  You try to lift
 the handle - and the effort sends black spots dancing in front of your
 eyes.

 You'll need someone to help you with this.

 From here, you can try going north into the gym or east into the

 You shout, "I have to be away for a moment, but I'll be right back."

 George hollers through the door after you, "Come back with pants!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gymnasium</span>
 The elderly gymnasium looks relatively unscathed.  Since this room
 doubles as an auditorium, stacked bleachers line the north wall.  The
 door to the equipment room is west, and the locker room is south.  The
 double doors leading back to the hallway are north.

 Blue exercise mats are piled to one side, arranged around a balance
 beam, and scattered over the floor.

 You can also see a pommel horse here.

>go west

 (first opening the equipment room door)
 You try to pull the equipment door open, and you can't do it.  You're
 running out of reserves.

 Your entire body aches in time with the pulses of darkness swirling
 through your vision.

>examine equipment door

 The equipment room door isn't labelled.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The air reeks of smoke and chemicals.  To the south, two large double
 doors lead into the gymnasium.  Mrs. McCaskill's classroom used to be
 accessible to the north, but there's no going that way now.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 The black spots slowly fade from your vision, but the pain remains.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The wall buckled a bit here, but didn't collapse entirely - unlike to
 the west, where outright wreckage is visible by the gym entrance.
 Colorful leaf rubbings and magazine mosaics hang drunkenly off their
 moorings.

 The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Emily's former classroom is to the north, marked with a construction
 paper sign reading "Ms. Wagner's room - Come In!"  To the south,
 there's an alcove that splits off toward the bathrooms.  The hallway
 continues to the east and west, decorated with inexpertly drawn
 posters about When I Grow Up.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ms. Wagner's Room</span>
 This classroom is reasonably undamaged, apart from a fallen ceiling
 tile.  The decorations are straight out of the 70's, all giant
 cardboard apples and smiling cartoon children, occupying not only the
 walls but the front of Ms. Wagner's desk.  The air smells of markers
 and chalk dust.

 You can see a closet door and an enormous blackboard here.

>take pencil

 You try to pick up the pens and pencils, but it seems to weigh a
 thousand pounds.  Your head swims with the effort and you have to give
 up.

 Whatever was in that gas really wrecked you.  You can't remember ever
 feeling this bad before.

>examine apples

 Most of the characters are from Family Circus, with a few highlights
 from Marmaduke and Little Orphan Annie.  It would be a surprise if any
 of these kids get a newspaper, and Little Orphan Annie was cancelled
 in 2010.

>examine chalk

 Which do you mean, the chalk tray or the white chalk?

>examine trasyu

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine tray

 Which do you mean, the chalk tray or the round blue tray?

>blue tray

 Small blue writing on the top says:

 <span class="floydstyle em">Need A Penny</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Have A Penny</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Find A Penny</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Leave A Penny</span>

 Despite this, the tray is filled with paper clips.

>examine chalk tray

 In the chalk tray are some white chalk.

>get chalk

 (the white chalk)
 You gather your energy and pick up the chalk.  You write, in large,
 shaky letters:

 <span class="floydstyle em">IF YOU FIND THIS:</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Leave the school ASAP.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">I have located Jude, Keiko, George, Samir, and Tyrone</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and we are leaving as soon as we can.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">~ Mr. Ginsberg</span>

 After a moment, you draw a rectangle around it and add, "<span class="floydstyle em">DO NOT</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">ERASE!</span>"

 Your entire arm aches as you drop the chalk back into its tray.

 Emily's former classroom is to the north, marked with a construction
 paper sign reading "Ms. Wagner's room - Come In!"  To the south,
 there's an alcove that splits off toward the bathrooms.  The hallway
 continues to the east and west, decorated with inexpertly drawn
 posters about When I Grow Up.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Locker Hallway</span>
 The locker-lined hallway stretches from east to west.  Pictures of
 famous Americans gaze starchily down from above the dull brown
 lockers, almost successfully concealing the old water damage on the
 walls.  You can smell something burning.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall Junction</span>
 Fire alarm lights strobe across a painfully cheerful mural on the east
 wall, positioned exactly opposite the west-facing hallway.  The
 classrooms and the gymnasium are off to the west, the science and
 computer labs are north, and the cafeteria is off to the south, but
 you can see from here that no part of the building went unravaged.  At
 least it looks like most of the kids made it out.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 There's a bulletin board lying face-down on the floor.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cafeteria Hall</span>
 This part of the hall has been plastered with signs in unsubtle red,
 white, and blue, occasionally accented with yellow smiley-face
 stickers.  The overhead lights are flickering weakly here, and the
 power probably won't last long.  The hall continues south toward the
 school kitchen and north toward the classrooms.

 The cafeteria doors are to the east, but they're closed and locked,
 since lunch ended hours ago.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Cafeteria Hall</span>
 With the overhead fluorescents out, it's particularly dim at this end
 of the hallway, but the flashing fire alarms illuminate the door
 labelled "KITCHEN STAFF - NO STUDENTS".  The door is partly open,
 wedged in place with a serving tray.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">School Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen has no windows, and without the overhead lights, it's
 seriously dark here.  Counters and shelves are barely discernable
 glints in the blackness.

 Reflected fire alarm light flickers in the doorway to the west.

>go north

 You feel your way carefully through the maze of counters until you
 reach the cafeteria door.

 Even pushing through the swinging door takes more effort than it
 should.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cafeteria</span>
 This is one of the few modern-day cafeterias that doesn't sport a set
 of vending machines in addition to standard cafeteria fare.  Pale
 sunlight streams down through the high bank of huge windows, shining
 carelessly over the faded tile and the ceiling-high folded lunch
 tables alike.  The kitchen door is to the south.

 The cafeteria doors are to the west, but they're completely blocked
 off behind the folded lunch tables.

 The door swings shut behind you.

>shout

 You call, "Hello!  Does anyone hear me?"

 Nobody answers.

>exits

 From here, you can try going south into the kitchen or west toward the
 hallway.

>examine windows
>examine tables

 The windows are huge, almost six feet square, and they're positioned
 so far up the wall that the bottom of the frame is roughly even with
 your chin.  You've heard Coach Lewis hypothesize that, since the kids
 aren't tall enough to see outside during lunch, it helps keep them
 focused on school during the day.  It's yet another reason why you've
 hypothesized that Coach Lewis is a jackass.

 The ground slopes away on this side of the school, so the sidewalk is
 about fifteen feet below the window.  Looking outside, you see a
 relatively untouched expanse of grass and concrete, though dark smoke
 rises from the high school across the way.  Though contrails
 crisscross the sky, there is no one in sight, either on foot or
 overhead to the sidewalk below.


 The cafeteria lunch tables are peculiar industrial affairs that have
 the seats and tables all connected together.  Unfolded, they stretch
 the entire length of the cafeteria; folded against the north wall, as
 they are now, they reach up to the ceiling.

>move tables

 The folded lunch tables are far too heavy to move in your weakened
 state.

>climb tables

 You're not up for clambering around right now.  You might climb on
 something large and flat, like a desk, but some folded lunch tables?
 No.

 You lean against the swinging door, which eventually yields.

 There's a wet spot growing on the carpet near the door to the girls'

 There's a small rubber wedge jamming the boys' room door shut.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Girls' Bathroom</span>
 Rubble and debris fill the back half of the bathroom.  At least one
 pipe burst in the collapse, and water sprays steadily across the room
 to bounce off a stall door and pool on the ugly cream-and-black tiles.

 Keiko is sitting on the bathroom floor.  Her hair and clothing are
 soaked from the spraying water, and her right leg is visibly broken.

>keiko, i

 You ask, "Keiko, do you have anything useful?"

 Keiko goes through her pockets, but comes up empty-handed.  "Nothing,"
 she says, looking worried.
 You say, "Okay, thanks for checking."

 You ask, "Keiko, what do you think of George?"

 Keiko says in a lowered tone, "Do you know his mom died?"

 Keiko says, "He doesn't tell many people.  I bet he's pretty lonely."

>ask keiko about keiko

 You ask, "Keiko, how are you doing?

 Keiko says, "It really hurts.  I'm trying to be strong, Mr. Ginsberg"

 She shouts something back, but you can't understand her response.  Her

>think about ashley

 Last year, Ashley's Cool Older Sister gave her a subscription to Teen
 Vogue, and Ashley's been in a hurry to grow up ever since.  She
 already knows that it's not cool to raise your hand in class or to sit
 with the younger girls at lunch.  Five years from now, she'll be
 holding hands with William Bradley, and she'll forget that she ever
 asked you how to become a painter.

>get white chalk

 You take a moment to update your note on the blackboard.  Your arm
 aches all the way up to your shoulder as you drop the chalk back into
 its tray.

>ashley, look

 You call through the closed door, "What do you see, Ashley?"

 From inside the supply closet, Ashley calls, "Mostly it's pretty dark.
 I can see a little bit from the light under the door, but I'm in the
 back and I can't see quite what's here.  There's, um, coat hooks, and
 shelves with paper and stuff, and a bunch of boxes.  Some of the

 Jude sits on the ground beside the rubble-strewn table, peering
 miserably into the darkness underneath.

 You say, "I'm going to need both of my hands for this," and drop
 Ashley's hand.

 Despite your trembling hands, you scramble successfully over the table
 and through the gap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mrs. McCaskill's Room</span>
 Half the ceiling has fallen, crushing the west side of the room
 beneath debris and blocking the door entirely.  The water sprinklers
 spew frantically, turning papers and decorations to mush, but
 whatever's burning isn't actually in this room.

 A gaping hole in the east wall allows you back into your classroom, if
 you scramble over the rubble-strewn table in the way.  The north wall
 is in similarly poor state, but the choking smoke on that side ensures
 it's not a viable exit.

 A crumpled poster projects from the rubble, mostly sheltered from the

 Water flows down the legs of the cheap wooden teacher's desk to the

 Ashley crawls over the rubble-strewn table and comes in through the

 You ask, "Ashley, we need to get Jude's bunny out from under the

 Ashley probes under the table with the yardstick for a moment before

 There's a wet spot growing on the carpet near the door to the girls'

 There's a small rubber wedge jamming the boys' room door shut.

 Jude lets go of your hand.

 Jude wiggles the wedge for a moment before getting it free.  "Got it!"

 Tyrone barges out of the boys' bathroom.  "Phew, it's about time you

 Ashley pulls on the small rubber wedge.  It's not very effective.

 Tyrone realizes immediately that he's the focus of your attention and

 Tyrone is wearing a black canvas backpack, a Notre Dame jersey, and a
 pair of baggy jeans.

 Ashley reluctantly follows you in.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Girls' Bathroom</span>
 Rubble and debris fill the back half of the bathroom.  At least one
 pipe burst in the collapse, and water sprays steadily across the room
 to bounce off a stall door and pool on the ugly cream-and-black tiles.

 Ashley is here, holding hands with you and carrying a yardstick.

 Keiko is sitting on the bathroom floor.  Her hair and clothing are
 soaked from the spraying water, and her right leg is visibly broken.

 Ashley cries out, "Keiko, you got hurt!" and runs to her, almost
 slipping on the wet tile.

 You shout, "Careful!", because Ashley's still carrying the yardstick

 Tyrone realizes immediately that he's the focus of your attention and
 stares back challengingly.  He doesn't even come up to your armpit,
 but he hardly seems to notice.

 Tyrone is wearing a black canvas backpack, a Notre Dame jersey, and a
 pair of baggy jeans.
 Tyrone is carrying a broken shoelace.

>tyrone, put shoelace and clip in backpack

 broken shoelace: To avoid confusing Tyrone, ask about one thing at a
 time.
 striped green paper clip: To avoid confusing Tyrone, ask about one
 thing at a time.

>put shoelace in backpack

 You say, "Tyrone, let me take a look at the shoelace."

 (first taking the broken shoelace)

 Your hands are shaking badly enough that you're afraid of dropping the
 broken shoelace, but you could ask Tyrone to get it for you.

>tyrone, put shoelace in backpack

 You ask, "Tyrone, can you put your shoelace into your backpack?"

 Tyrone puts the broken shoelace into the black canvas backpack.

>tyrone, follow me

 You ask, "Tyrone, would you please hold hands with me?"

 Tyrone takes your hand.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Art Room</span>
 This was your classroom.  A gaping hole in the wall provides
 unexpected access to Mrs. McCaskill's room.  Tissue paper trees line
 the intact east wall, striving to brighten the desolation.

 You left a long table shoved up against the west wall.  Now, that
 table supports half the rubble from the collapsed wall and partially
 blocks your access to the gaping hole.

 Tyrone is here, holding hands with you.

 The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 The wall buckled a bit here, but didn't collapse entirely - unlike to

 wall, positioned exactly opposite the west-facing hallway.  The
 classrooms and the gymnasium are off to the west, the science and
 computer labs are north, and the cafeteria is off to the south, but
 you can see from here that no part of the building went unravaged.  At

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hall</span>
 This was the approved route to shelter, before the bombs hit and the
 ceiling collapsed.  Now, shards of plastic and glass jut from the
 rubble, and more than one corpse lies buried beneath the weight of
 stone.  Heavy debris lies half-propped upon long pieces of rebar,
 creating a hazardous barrier that blocks the way north.  The way south
 remains open.

 Tyrone is here, holding hands with you.

 To the west, more debris blocks off the door to Avery Thomas's
 classroom.

 You shout, "This is Mr. Ginsberg!  If you can hear me, yell back!"

 Samir shouts, "Go away!"

 From somewhere behind the door, Samir screams, "I'm not listening!  I

>samir, open door

 It's too dangerous.  You'll have to get him out another way.

>ask tyrone about samir

 You ask, "Tyrone, what do you think of Samir?"

 Tyrone answers, "He's got some friends that he only thinks are his
 friends.  It'll get him in trouble someday."

>tyrone, move rubble

 The pile of debris blocking the door is unstable and heavy, definitely
 too dangerous for Tyrone to shift it.

 You say, "Tyrone, you need to shove that debris."

 Tyrone heaves at the pile of debris before giving up, disappointed.
 "I can't, it won't move!"

 You call, "Samir, I need you to go down the duct where it gets
 darker."

 From somewhere above the ceiling tiles, Samir hollers, "Okay, I'm
 going now!"

 Ashley picks up a piece of chalk and adds a few more details to one of
 the drawings on the board.

 Satisfied with the result, Ashley puts the chalk back in the tray.

>examine board

 The blackboard currently contains a list of countries in Western
 Europe, with extra notes about Luxembourg (capital - Luxembourg,
 largest city - Luxembourg, official languages - French, German, and
 Luxembourgish).

 Off to the side, the blackboard contains your note:

 <span class="floydstyle em">IF YOU FIND THIS:                   DO NOT ERASE!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Leave the school ASAP.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">I have located Jude, Keiko, George, Samir, Tyrone, and Ashley</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and we are leaving as soon as we can.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">~Mr. Ginsberg</span>

 Additionally, the blackboard contains a chalk drawing of a somewhat
 cross-eyed tabby cat with a dead mouse in its mouth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 Emily's former classroom is to the north, marked with a construction

 there's an alcove that splits off toward the bathrooms.  The hallway
 continues to the east and west, decorated with inexpertly drawn
 posters about When I Grow Up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Art Room</span>
 This was your classroom.  A gaping hole in the wall provides
 unexpected access to Mrs. McCaskill's room.  Tissue paper trees line
 the intact east wall, striving to brighten the desolation.

 Ashley is here, holding hands with you.

 Jude is here, holding hands with you and clinging to Mr. Bunny.

 You left a long table shoved up against the west wall.  Now, that
 table supports half the rubble from the collapsed wall and partially
 blocks your access to the gaping hole.

 The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

>samir, l

 You shout, "Samir, what do you see?"

 From somewhere above the ceiling tiles, Samir yells, "I can hardly see
 anything, and the air smells really awful, like something burning in
 the oven.  There aren't any turns again - it just goes forward and
 back."

>look at ceiling

 It's very strange seeing the wreckage of the ceiling and walls.  The
 school used to be divided into boxes, each hall and room discrete, but
 now those boxes have crunched like eggshell.

>samir, w

 You call, "Samir, please go forward down the duct."

 You hear Samir start to answer, but he starts coughing almost
 immediately, and you can't make out what he says.

>shout

 You shout, "Samir, are you there?"

 Nobody answers.

>go west

 You say, "I'm going to need both of my hands for this," and drop
 Ashley and Jude's hand.

 Despite your trembling hands, you scramble successfully over the table
 and through the gap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mrs. McCaskill's Room</span>
 Half the ceiling has fallen, crushing the west side of the room
 beneath debris and blocking the door entirely.  The water sprinklers
 spew frantically, turning papers and decorations to mush, but
 whatever's burning isn't actually in this room.

 A gaping hole in the east wall allows you back into your classroom, if
 you scramble over the rubble-strewn table in the way.  The north wall
 is in similarly poor state, but the choking smoke on that side ensures
 it's not a viable exit.

 A crumpled poster projects from the rubble, mostly sheltered from the
 sprinklers by a fallen corkboard.

 Water flows down the legs of the cheap wooden teacher's desk to the
 growing puddle on the floor.

>shout

 You shout, "Samir, can you hear me?"

 Jude doesn't answer you.

 You shout, "Samir, are you all right?"

 From somewhere in the ceiling tiles, you can hear Samir coughing.
 There is a muted bang, maybe the sound of him hitting something - you
 can't be sure.

 go, I'm sorry."

 From somewhere above the ceiling tiles, you hear a metallic banging
 that recedes to the east.

 You could ask him to go south along the hall or west into Avery's

 This classroom is reasonably undamaged, apart from a fallen ceiling

 cardboard apples and smiling cartoon children, occupying not only the
 walls but the front of Ms. Wagner's desk.  The air smells of markers
 and chalk dust.

 You can see a closet door, a pair of safety scissors, and an enormous
 blackboard here.

 There is no response.  Samir must be too far away to hear you.

 computer labs are north, and the cafeteria is off to the south, but
 you can see from here that no part of the building went unravaged.  At

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 There's a bulletin board lying face-down on the floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hall</span>
 This was the approved route to shelter, before the bombs hit and the
 ceiling collapsed.  Now, shards of plastic and glass jut from the
 rubble, and more than one corpse lies buried beneath the weight of
 stone.  Heavy debris lies half-propped upon long pieces of rebar,
 creating a hazardous barrier that blocks the way north.  The way south
 remains open.

 To the west, more debris blocks off the door to Avery Thomas's
 classroom.

 Tyrone stands with his arms folded across his pint-sized chest.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 Based on what Samir's told you so far, you don't think Samir can go

 There's no way you could support his weight - it's all too easy to see

>examine tyrone

 Tyrone realizes immediately that he's the focus of your attention and
 stares back challengingly.  He doesn't even come up to your armpit,
 but he hardly seems to notice.

 Tyrone is wearing a black canvas backpack, a Notre Dame jersey, and a
 pair of baggy jeans.
 Tyrone is carrying a broken ponytail holder and a deodorant spray
 bottle.

>tyrone, x holder

 You say, "Tyrone, tell me about the ponytail holder."

 Tyrone says, "Um... I don't know what you mean... it's just a ponytail
 holder."

>examine holder

 You examine the broken ponytail holder in Tyrone's hand.  You see
 nothing special about the broken ponytail holder.

>tyrone, give jeans to george

 You say, "Tyrone, please show the jeans to George."

 Tyrone crowds up to the small window.

 Tyrone holds the pair of baggy jeans up to the window for George's
 inspection.  "Look, it's a jeans!"

 George shouts through the door, "I don't need that, I need pants!"

 Jude grins, Ashley titters, Tyrone frowns, and Samir snorts, and
 George looks even more unhappy.

 Tyrone says, "Like you were never six," and gives Jude and Ashley a
 withering look.
 .

 You give Jude and Ashley a stern look, and they subside hurriedly.

>think about class

 The Geo Lab is Avery Thomas's classroom.  He keeps a collection of
 rocks in there that would do a museum proud, if it were a small museum
 that didn't focus much on earth science.  They're not rare, but they
 are shiny.

>think about children

 Every teacher has specific classes they teach, but every teacher gets
 a homeroom class too.  This year, you pulled the short straw, and you
 have a small class of mostly problem cases.  Some of your students
 were with Emily - but Jude, Ashley, and Samir definitely scattered,
 and you think George and Keiko were with them.

>ask george about locker

 (the gym locker)
 You shout, "Do you keep pants or shorts or something in your gym
 locker?"

 George hollers through the door, "No, the gym lockers don't lock!"

 He has a point, but you could wish he didn't.

>drop all

 There are none at all available!

>inventory

 You are wearing a striped red tie, a rumpled white shirt, some pair of
 black slacks, and a gold wedding band.

>examine my left hand

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the left pocket of
 your slacks.

>go north

 You are holding Samir's hand, so he follows you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gymnasium</span>
 The elderly gymnasium looks relatively unscathed.  Since this room
 doubles as an auditorium, stacked bleachers line the north wall.  The

 double doors leading back to the hallway are north.

 Samir is here, holding hands with you.

 Blue exercise mats are piled to one side, arranged around a balance

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Locker Hallway</span>
 The locker-lined hallway stretches from east to west.  Pictures of

 lockers, almost successfully concealing the old water damage on the

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

>examine lockers

 The lockers are narrow, brown, and about four feet tall.  Every
 student gets a locker on their first day, along with a lecture about
 how they are strictly forbidden to decorate the lockers or change
 their locker combinations.

 You check one of the lockers, but, as you suspected, the locker is

 You shout, "George, this is a really bad time to forget your locker
 combination.  Can you think really hard?"

 George hollers through the door, "I'm thinking really hard, I can't

 Samir tries not to smile, Jude snickers, Ashley grins, and Tyrone

 dial.

 You turn the dial right to 20.

 You turn the dial left to 36.

 You turn the dial right to 22.  That makes three numbers - 20 R, 36 L,

>open drawer

 Black spots pass before your eyes, and you have to steady yourself for
 a moment on the desk.  But the drawer opens.

>look indrawer

 You can't see any such thing.

>look in drawer

 In the metal drawer is a slim red notebook.

>read notebook

 This slim red notebook contains all the school locker combinations.
 The plastic cover is protecting it somewhat from the sprinklers, but
 that won't survive forever.
 White-Out lettering on the cover reads, "Locker Combinations - Mrs.
 McCaskill - Do Not Touch".  The notebook is currently closed.

>open it

 The notebook's plastic cover provides some protection from the
 sprinklers, but if you open it in here, the ink will run immediately.

>samir, take notebook

 You ask, "Samir, would you please grab the notebook from that drawer?"

 Samir picks up the slim red notebook.

>samir, e

 You say, "Samir, I need you to go into the art room."

 Samir climbs carefully over the rubble-strewn table and out through
 the gap in the wall.

>go east

 Despite your weakened muscles, you scramble successfully over the
 table and through the gap.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Art Room</span>
 This was your classroom.  A gaping hole in the wall provides
 unexpected access to Mrs. McCaskill's room.  Tissue paper trees line
 the intact east wall, striving to brighten the desolation.

 You left a long table shoved up against the west wall.  Now, that
 table supports half the rubble from the collapsed wall and partially
 blocks your access to the gaping hole.

 Samir is here, carrying a slim red notebook and a straightened striped
 green paper clip.

 The door to your classroom hangs open on its twisted doorframe.

>samir, open notebook

 You ask, "Samir, can you open the notebook?"

 Samir opens the slim red notebook.

>read notebook

 You examine the slim red notebook in Samir's hand.  This slim red
 notebook contains all the school locker combinations.  You search
 through the pages until you locate George's locker combination, which
 is 40 R, 52 L, 56 R this year.

>samir, drop notebook

 You say, "Samir, please put down the notebook."

 Samir puts the slim red notebook on the floor.

 Fire alarm lights strobe across a painfully cheerful mural on the east
 wall, positioned exactly opposite the west-facing hallway.  The
 classrooms and the gymnasium are off to the west, the science and
 computer labs are north, and the cafeteria is off to the south, but
 you can see from here that no part of the building went unravaged.  At
 least it looks like most of the kids made it out.

 You say, "Samir, please show the pair of ragged jeans to George."

 Samir crowds up to the small window.

 Samir holds the pair of ragged jeans up to the window for George's
 inspection.  "Look, it's a pair of ragged jeans!"

 With a click, the gym office door opens just far enough for George to
 stick his hand out and grab the pants away from Samir.  Before you can
 intervene, George slams the door shut again.

 You wait.

>george, open door
>knock on door

 You call, "George, can you open the door?"

 George considers his options for a moment before leaning the yardstick
 up against a wall.  One powerful stomp downward breaks the yardstick
 neatly in two, with surprisingly few splinters sticking out.

 George studies the yardstick for a moment and breaks off a few last
 splinters before showing it off to you.

 You say, "Nicely done," and George grins with pride.

 Keiko breathes through her teeth for a moment.

>splint keiko

 You try to rip off a length of the black cloth tape and discover that
 you don't have enough strength to tear it.  Before the spraying water
 can ruin the adhesive, you hurriedly wind it back onto its spool.

 No.  Ashley is just a kid - they all are.  You can't put this
 responsibility on them.

 just sets a bad precedent.

 You ask, "No, I didn't mean it.  Sorry, I don't know what I was

 pair of safety scissors: Your hands are shaking badly enough that
 you're afraid of dropping the pair of safety scissors, but you could
 ask one of the students to get it for you.

>splint keiko

 You looked at the yardstick, the scissors, and the black cloth tape -
 all carried here by a student, because you didn't have the strength to
 carry them yourself.  And you looked at your hands, which wouldn't
 stop shaking.  And then you looked at Keiko, and you picked up the
 yardstick.

 When Keiko screamed, George whimpered and wrapped his arms around
 himself as if he could hug the sound away, and Ashley went pale and
 ran out of the room,
 Afterward, you might say you prayed.  Or only that you thought of
 Adam.  Or only that you had to keep going.  But when you were done at
 last, sitting back on your heels in the spraying water and misery, you
 heard Keiko whisper, "Thank you."

 Keiko levers herself up with the lacrosse stick.  Her balance clearly
 isn't great, but between her splinted leg and the lacrosse stick, she
 should be able to get around for the time being.

 Rubble and debris fill the back half of the bathroom.  At least one
 pipe burst in the collapse, and water sprays steadily across the room
 to bounce off a stall door and pool on the ugly cream-and-black tiles.

 George stands looking miserable with his hands in the pockets of his

 Keiko hobbles into the hall.

 Keiko sits down carefully, keeping her weight entirely off her bad

 Ashley approaches Keiko with her eyes averted.  "Kiki, I'm sorry I ran
 away.  I didn't mean to, I was scared, I'm sorry."

 Keiko says, "If I could've run away, I would have run too.  It's all

 Keiko reaches up to Ashley, and they exchange a hug.

 You say, "Tyrone, let me take a look at the flashlight battery
 compartment."

 You open the battery compartment on the industrial flashlight,
 revealing some Energizer D-cell batteries.

 Your hands are shaking badly enough that you're afraid of dropping the
 Energizer D-cell batteries, but you could ask Tyrone to get it for
 you.

 You ask, "Tyrone, would you please pick up the Energizer batteries
 from that flashlight battery compartment?"

 Tyrone pries the Energizer batteries out of the flashlight.

 This is one of the few modern-day cafeterias that doesn't sport a set

 The door swings shut behind you.

>examine windows

 The windows are huge, almost six feet square, and they're positioned
 so far up the wall that the bottom of the frame is roughly even with
 your chin.

 The ground slopes away on this side of the school, so the sidewalk is
 about fifteen feet below the window.  Looking outside, you see a
 relatively untouched expanse of grass and concrete, though dark smoke
 rises from the high school across the way.  Though contrails
 crisscross the sky, there is no one in sight, either on foot or
 overhead to the sidewalk below.

>samir, open window

 The windows aren't constructed so that they can open.

>samir, break window

 Breaking the window by hand is dangerous, and it might not even be
 possible.  Samir will need something appropriately heavy even to try.

>tyrone, get on horse

 You ask, "Tyrone, can you get up on the pommel horse?"

 Tyrone pulls himself up onto the pommel horse and then stands up.

 You ask, "Tyrone, can you check on those windows and tell me what's
 there?"

 Tyrone gives you a confused look.

>tyrone, x window

 Tyrone says, "They're the cafeteria windows.  They're really big, and
 pretty high up."

 brilliantly colored My Little Pony backpack (Jude's)?

>black pbackpack

 You can't see any such thing.

>black backpack

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine black backpack

 You examine Tyrone's backpack.  It's a basic black canvas backpack,
 with all the normal zippers and accoutrements.

 In the black canvas backpack are a bobby pin and a broken shoelace.

>examine samir

 He's heavily smudged with dust and grime, but generally looks unhurt.

 Samir is wearing a bulging blue knapsack, a purple polo shirt, and a
 pair of black shorts.

>examine knapsack

 You examine Samir's knapsack.  Samir's blue knapsack is generally
 sun-faded, but there's a brighter patch on the back.  There's a
 suspicious bulge weighing down the bottom of the knapsack.

>open knapsack

 You say, "Samir, I need to see your knapsack for a moment."

 You open the bulging blue knapsack, revealing a large geode.

>examine geode

 You examine the large geode inside Samir's bulging blue knapsack.
 It's a cut geode half - boring grey on the outside, but a glittering
 mass of dense blue crystal on the inside.  This particular geode is
 almost as large as a softball.  It has almost no hollow space left,
 and no sharp points on the inside.

>samir, break window with geode

 Samir won't understand those instructions.  You need to rethink your
 strategy.

 You ask, "Samir, can you please grab the geode from that knapsack?"

 Samir picks up the large geode.

 Samir measures the distance for a moment, hefts the geode in both

 The geode sails through the elderly windowpane with a magnificent
 crash, leaving an empty window frame edged with jagged shards behind.

 stone.  Heavy debris lies half-propped upon long pieces of rebar,
 creating a hazardous barrier that blocks the way north.  The way south
 remains open.

 To the west, more debris blocks off the door to Avery Thomas's

 Fire alarm lights strobe across a painfully cheerful mural on the east
 wall, positioned exactly opposite the west-facing hallway.  The
 classrooms and the gymnasium are off to the west, the science and
 computer labs are north, and the cafeteria is off to the south, but
 you can see from here that no part of the building went unravaged.  At
 least it looks like most of the kids made it out.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 There's a bulletin board lying face-down on the floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cafeteria Hall</span>
 This part of the hall has been plastered with signs in unsubtle red,
 white, and blue, occasionally accented with yellow smiley-face
 stickers.  The overhead lights are flickering weakly here, and the
 power probably won't last long.  The hall continues south toward the
 school kitchen and north toward the classrooms.

 The cafeteria doors are to the east, but they're closed and locked,
 since lunch ended hours ago.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Cafeteria Hall</span>
 With the overhead fluorescents out, it's particularly dim at this end
 of the hallway, but the flashing fire alarms illuminate the door
 labelled "KITCHEN STAFF - NO STUDENTS".  The door is partly open,
 wedged in place with a serving tray.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">School Kitchen</span>
 It's very dark in here, since the overhead lights are out.  The
 flashlight beam paints its wavering yellow eye across a landscape of
 sterile steel.  It's not much light, but it reduces the maze of
 counters to comprehensible rows, and it's enough to illuminate the
 swinging door leading north.

 Reflected fire alarm light flickers in the doorway to the west.

 Because you know exactly where to look, you can see the ventilation
 grate against the darkened ceiling.

 An industrial flashlight sits on the ground, emitting a yellow beam of

 Even pushing through the swinging door takes more effort than it

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cafeteria</span>
 This is one of the few modern-day cafeterias that doesn't sport a set

 carelessly over the faded tile and the ceiling-high folded lunch

 The cafeteria doors are to the west, but they're completely blocked
 off behind the folded lunch tables.

 Jude is here, clinging to Mr. Bunny.

 George stands looking miserable with his hands in the pockets of his

 Tyrone gives a big, wordless whoop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sidewalk</span>
 Black smoke rises over the school, shattered glass litters the ground,

 George, Tyrone, and Jude, he'll need your help for this."

 Jude looks at Mr. Bunny, looks at the floor, and then hugs him even
 tighter.

 Jude tucks Mr. Bunny under her arm for safety.

 Samir, George, Tyrone, and Jude gather around the pommel horse and try
 to move it.  With many small-kid grunts of effort, they get the pommel
 horse moving and successfully slide it into the cafeteria.

>go north

 Even pushing through the swinging door takes more effort than it
 should.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cafeteria</span>
 This is one of the few modern-day cafeterias that doesn't sport a set
 of vending machines in addition to standard cafeteria fare.  Pale
 sunlight streams down through the high bank of huge windows, shining
 carelessly over the faded tile and the ceiling-high folded lunch
 tables alike.  The kitchen door is to the south.

 Jude is here, clinging to Mr. Bunny.

 Tyrone stands with his arms folded across his pint-sized chest.

 George stands looking miserable with his hands in the pockets of his
 too-big pants.

 Samir is standing nearby with his hands stuffed in his pockets.

 The cafeteria doors are to the west, but they're completely blocked
 off behind the folded lunch tables.

 One of the windows has been shattered, leaving an empty window frame
 edged with jagged glass shards.

 You can also see a pommel horse and a blue exercise mat here.

 The door swings shut behind you.

>samir, put mat on horse

 You say, "Samir, you can put the mat on the pommel horse."

 Samir says, "But I don't have the mat."

>samir, take mat

 It's unlikely that Samir can pick up the blue exercise mat, but
 dragging it around might be possible.

>samir, push mat e

 You ask, "Samir, can you heave that mat out the broken window?"
 With a grunt of effort, Samir hauls the blue exercise mat up onto the
 pommel horse and then onto the edge of the empty window frame,
 breaking off some of the jagged shards along the way.  In a series of
 determined heaves, he shoves it bit by bit out the window, until
 gravity takes over.

 The exercise mat smacks down on the sidewalk outside.

 You lean against the swinging door, which eventually yields.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">School Kitchen</span>
 It's very dark in here, since the overhead lights are out.  The
 flashlight beam paints its wavering yellow eye across a landscape of
 sterile steel.  It's not much light, but it reduces the maze of
 counters to comprehensible rows, and it's enough to illuminate the
 swinging door leading north.

 Reflected fire alarm light flickers in the doorway to the west.

 Because you know exactly where to look, you can see the ventilation
 grate against the darkened ceiling.

 An industrial flashlight sits on the ground, emitting a yellow beam of
 light.

 The door swings shut behind you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Cafeteria Hall</span>
 With the overhead fluorescents out, it's particularly dim at this end

 wedged in place with a serving tray.

 The fire alarms flash and shrill monotonously.

 school kitchen and north toward the classrooms.

 Fire alarm lights strobe across a painfully cheerful mural on the east

 you can see from here that no part of the building went unravaged.  At

 He successfully knocks out a few of the lower pieces of glass, but
 most of the glass is beyond his reach, and eventually he gives up.

 Keiko stares out the window for a moment, considering her options.
 Finally, she perches on the edge of the window and then throws herself
 sideways toward the mats on the ground.

 Keiko hits with her good foot, then collapses sideways onto her good
 knee and her arm.  Her wrenching scream of pain is hard to hear, but

 The fall wouldn't even faze you, if not for your physical condition.
 When your feet hit, your knees immediately buckle and you bellyflop

 There's not really an impact at all - just a full-body throb of pain,
 enough to turn the world gray and red for a long, lingering moment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sidewalk</span>
 Black smoke rises over the school, shattered glass litters the ground,

 And all the rest of you, too - scream and shout and yell, let's make

 The students start yelling as loudly as they possibly can, shrieking
 at volumes and pitches that only elementary school kids can manage.
 You're impressed - it's as good as a gym whistle.

 The tiny figures on the soccer field react to the noise.  You see one
 of them signalling to the chopper and then pointing in your direction.

 You wait.

 The chopper rises from the soccer field and approaches the school.

 cheering.

 A ladder descends from the chopper, carrying a broad figure in a
 brilliant green hazmat suit.  The figure touches down and pulls off
 her hood immediately to reveal a friendly smile.

 The hazmat suited woman says, "Hi, kids.  You're safe now.  We'll
 bring an evac team and get you out right away."  Sighting the blue
 exercise mats in the background, she asks, "Did you have to jump out
 that window?  Good thinking, laying down a mat."

 you're at the end of your strength.

 Awareness swells over you in the moment before a warm, familiar voice
 says quietly, "Hey.  Good job."

 You turn to see Adam standing nearby.  You burst out, "Thank God, you
 made it!"

 But Adam's already shaking his head.  "No," he says.  "You already
 knew that."

 Adam holds out his hand.

>examine adam

 He doesn't look hurt, which is a deep relief.

 Adam says, "Hey, Mark.  It's time to go."

>hold hand

 Whom do you want to hold hand of?

>adam

 You ask, "They're going to be all right, aren't they?"

 Adam looks over at the hazmat suited woman and the kids.  "Looks like
 it, doesn't it?"

 You say, "All right," and you take his hand.  In the moment when you
 do, everything stops hurting.

 You ask, "So... is there going to be a tunnel of white light, or
 something cliched like that?"

 Adam laughs.  "I don't know!  Let's find out."

 The wreckage across the sidewalk is too dangerous for your students,
 but danger doesn't matter any more.  Hand in hand, you and Adam walk
 along the sidewalk, climbing over small debris or veering into the
 grass as the whim strikes you.  Everything gets paler as you walk, and
 whiter, and brighter.

 You take one look back at the paramedics sliding a stretcher under
 Keiko, and then the world dissolves entirely.
