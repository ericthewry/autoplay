 Reality is so... unreal.

 The tangle of observations woven about it, humankind's utter lack of
 consensus, phases it to fit individual desires. Becoming and
 unbecoming, back and forth eternally, as it paradoxically coexists with
 and within infinite variations of itself...

 At least, that's what always surfaces in your mind whenever your own
 perception of reality is altered. Which is to say, ten or fifteen times
 a day. But it's your job, working to someday entertain others with new
 observations, new experiences, new realities. And after all, you signed
 up for the Project (as you well remember, even though it was close to
 five years ago), so you suppose it's entirely your fault if you don't
 like it. Which, when you think about it, you realise you do.

 Justy's voice reaches out to you from somewhere you can't see. "Okay,
 this should be it. One final test run to check any overload potential,
 and this world is done! I'm starting her up."

 A loud CLANK, and the Sphere begins spinning, with you inside it.

 "Brace yourself!"

 Bright lights.

 Pain.

 From somewhere off in your mind's distance, a telltale splash.

 Then, as the resounding thrums fade, a distorted ripple sweeps your
 vision clear, and all traces of the laboratory vanish from your senses.

 All five of them.

 Wiped clean, twitching, anxious for new input.

 Virtual reality has become reality.

 Coral Reef
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But       Wsswstndd

 reality. "I estimate at max one potential for overload, maybe two. This
 one isn't all that complex, compared to the lab sim. Cynthesiser's got
 the analysis sweep running in the background, so you may feel some
 slight distortion. It's nothing to worry about. Just give us a typical

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Anemones</span>
 Here the seafloor drops away abruptly as a watery rift slices downward
 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 A large octopus propels itself up from the rift below, directly toward
 you!

 A spotted stingray flaps lazily along the seafloor.

>examine octopus
 3


 Its enormous grey-green body is soft and oval, encircled at the base
 by eight deadly sucker-studded tentacles.

 The octopus grabs you with its tentacles and, despite your desperate
 struggling, forces you into its gaping mouth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">     *** You have died ***</span>

 Well, okay, not really. But you've reached an exit point in the
 current VR session...








 A tidal-wave of mental pictures swarms about as your mind seeks
 desperately to cling to them, to place them, to somehow piece back
 together the splintered fragments of reality.

 Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove
 the VR suit, and quickly dress, hanging the suit back on its rack.

 Cynthia walks in from the output station with a thick printout.

 Justy chuckles darkly. "Scary stuff, huh? Freaks me out no matter how
 many times I see it." He claps you lightly on the shoulder, then turns
 to study the printout Cynthia has spread out on the lab bench.

 She flips through the pages briefly, running her fingers over the tiny
 raised bumps on one side before targeting a specific segment with an
 index finger. "Here," she emphasises to Justy. "According to the
 sweep, the interpreter stack may be unstable."

 "Where is it?" Justy inquires.

 "Can't tell. It's a global event routine, not embedded in a specific
 object. Damn this pseudo-OO compiler."

 Justy nods grimly. "It's in there somewhere." To you, he adds, "Guess
 we need to do another run. Take a break, come back after you've
 recovered a bit. I'll be waiting."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>
 The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices
 linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small
 underground laboratory to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every
 compass direction, and a set of disused cement steps descends into
 darkness.

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass
 tank.

 Justy works at the lab terminal, oblivious to all else.

 You can also see a lab bench (on which are the Project's technical
 manual, a computer workstation and an ergonomic mouse) here.

 Cynthia leaves the lab to the northwest.

>examine manual
 3


 This thick volume is the Project's documentation, most of which has
 been filled in in bits and pieces as developments have occurred. A lot
 of it is hopelessly disorganized, despite Dr Shimada's efforts to
 outline an index (which was some time ago). The cracked black leather
 binder bears the Project logo.

>read manual

 The technical manual has several hundred pages. It'd be more efficient
 to look up specific topics.

>examine logo

 You can't see any such thing.

>look up project in manual

 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Project's central terminal is located in the VR lab and is
 interfaced with the Cray ZMP-2010X and Sphere, but is otherwise
 isolated from the rest of the Corporation net (for security purposes).
 Control of the various system components is handled through a GUI
 (Graphical User Interface) which serves as the Project's operating
 system.

 Launch Icon, Report Icon, Sphere, System Icon
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

>look up cray zmp-2010x
 3


 (in the Project's technical manual)
 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Cray ZMP-2010X, located in the Output Station, provides central
 processing, storage, and printing functions to the VR operating
 system. It is interfaced with the lab terminal via coaxial cables and
 fiber-optic bundles. Printing of the current system status is
 controlled via the "report" function of the O/S. Due to the severe
 paper shortages, it is necessary that the previous printout be
 recycled (through the built-in slot attached to the printer).

 SEE ALSO: Lab Terminal, Report Icon
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

>examine me
 3


 You can't see yourself without a mirror.

>inventory
 3


 You are carrying nothing. You are wearing a technician's jumpsuit and
 a fingerwatch.

>examine fingerwatch
 3


 Like anyone in today's highly time-controlled society, you have a
 small clock affixed to your right index finger, continuously winking
 the correct time, according to the International Chronometer.

 It has a built-in alarm which can be set to alert you with a painful
 little jolt when the timer expires. (It's also digital, which you
 always thought was pretty neat.)

 Currently, your fingerwatch reads "3132".

>look up sphere in manual
 3


 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Sphere is an anti-gravity gyroscope that provides the sim user
 with the weightlessness necessary for the virtual experience to take
 over. The Sphere is the focal point for all sim-related activity
 within the system.

 SEE ALSO: Cray ZMP-2010X, Fail-Safe Lever, Lab Terminal, VR Suit
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

>examine vr suit

 The VR suit, a full-body outfit of spandex and kevlar, hangs on a rack
 against one wall. It fits tightly and is strung with a network of
 millions of tiny sensory-output devices.

>look up lawnmower man in manual
 3


 You discover nothing of relevance in the Project's technical manual.

>look up vr suit in manual
 3


 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The VR suit is laced with sensors and provides the user of a sim with
 tactile feedback. Its counterpart, the helmet, contains eyephones and
 earphones, and also interfaces directly with the subject's brain to
 artificially stimulate the senses of smell and taste.

 The suit is also equipped with a replaceable flexi-plast receptacle
 for the containment of bodily waste, as control of such functions is
 relinquished in a full-sensory VR.

 SEE ALSO: Configure Icon, Sphere.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

>look up configure icon
>look up configure icon
 3


 (in the Project's technical manual)
 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The "configure" icon allows the operator to change sensory output
 settings for a VR. Changes made during a session do not take effect
 until the sim is reloaded.

 All users have access to this program.

>examine glass tank
 3


 This tank used to house an android that performed a lot of the
 preliminary VR diagnostics, but you're not sure what happened to it
 (the android, that is). Odd, that.

>look up android in manual
 3


 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 VR androids, manufactured by other divisions within the Corporation,
 are another protective tool, used in the early stages of VR sim
 debugging. Equipped with limited neural-network processors, they are
 strapped into the sphere and used to perform preliminary VR
 diagnostics to avoid the dangers to a human brain in the event of any
 serious bugs in a virtual sensory reality.

 SEE ALSO: Debug Icon, Fail-Safe Lever, Sphere, VR Viruses
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

>look up fail-safe lever
 3


 (in the Project's technical manual)
 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Built into one corner of the Sphere is a fail-safe lever that may be
 pulled to prematurely shut down a sim when a person is inside. This
 feature is equipped with its own fusion cell and is of vital
 importance in the event of power outages or other system glitches. If
 a sim is not shut down properly using the fail-safe mechanism,
 permanent damage to the brain is likely to result from the abrupt
 termination of the human-computer synapse.

 SEE ALSO: Android, Sphere
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

>look up vr viruses in manual
 3


 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rather than simply crashing systems or corrupting files, the creators
 of early VR viruses took a more sinister purpose: By manipulating the
 operation of VR hardware, the viruses were able to produce incredibly
 bright lights and loud, high-pitched sounds that could actually blind
 or deafen users due to the equipment's close proximity to the sensory
 organs. Fear of this uncorrectable damage to persons instilled fear in
 the technology, ultimately pushing it by the wayside.

 His bright eyes gleam through thick glasses framed by short brown hair
 and a small gold loop through his left earlobe.

 else, someone different. Someone you've only begun to get to know
 recently... Very curious.

 Or were you just thinking of someone else...?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cynthia's Quarters</span>
 Cynthia's quarters are just as sparsely furnished as yours, with only
 a bed, desk, and a few of Cynthia's personal belongings.

 Cynthia busies herself with the VR analysis system.

 Above Cynthia's desk hangs a 3-D picture.

>examine picture
 3


 It's one of those pictures made up of a matrix of coloured dots,
 arranged to form a three-dimensional image when stared at long enough
 with one's eyes crossed. You've never understood why Cynthia (who is
 blind) would keep such a thing around.

 Wait a minute... If you squint your eyes just right... There! It looks
 like a giant sundial gnomon, with an atomic mushroom cloud erupting
 behind.

 Truly bizarre that you never recognised it until this moment.

>examine cynthia
 3


 Black lenses hide failed eyes, but Cynthia's other senses are even
 sharper than your own. Her long hair spills down her back in thick
 dreadlocks the same colour as a curious symbol tattooed on her right
 forearm.

 There's a pencil tucked behind her ear.

>examine tattoo

 An unrecognisable (to you) symbol, an eight-pointed star with a single
 letter at each point (two at each of the diagonals), done in black
 ink. It's hard to see clearly against Cynthia's dark skin.

 Ironic proof against the aphorism that supercomputers are shrinking

 with a face vaguely similar to that of Christ. Wisps of mist billow
 out from behind the crucifix, illuminated by lights angling upward
 from short black cylinders.

 Odd, this. You can't seem to recall any details of the auction. In

 A sleek black instrument, with round shoulders, a narrow neck, and
 graceful f-shaped curves on either side of a set of four strings. It
 has the Stradivari Corporation maker's mark on its bulging back.

 pair of kitchen tongs: Taken.

 painting by H.R. Giger: Taken.

 Now you remember why you hung it here in the first place: There's a
 large, unsightly niche hacked into the thick plasterboard wall.
 amplifier: It's pretty heavy. You'd have to drop everything you're
 carrying before you could lift it. (It does have casters attached to
 the underside, though.)

>examine niche

 A square depression, roughly fifteen centimetres to a side and ten
 deep, carved into the wall in a way that is not aesthetically pleasing
 in the least (which is why you hung the painting over it).

 This is where you've lived the last five years of your life while

 Like anyone in today's highly time-controlled society, you have a
 small clock affixed to your right index finger, continuously winking
 the correct time, according to the International Chronometer.

 It has a built-in alarm which can be set to alert you with a painful
 little jolt when the timer expires. (It's also digital, which you
 always thought was pretty neat.)

 Currently, your fingerwatch reads "4635".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MedLab</span>
 A rather stark infirmary, with cold cement walls and floor lit by a

 Justy's quarters are just as sparsely furnished as yours, with only a

 The holovision screen lights up as the set clicks on, broadcasting a
 "Jeopardy" match already in progress.

 Three contestants stand behind podiums labelled, from left to right
 (from your perspective), "Tom," "Lisa," and "Brian." Tom currently has
 $1400, Lisa's score is $1200, and Brian trails hopelessly behind with
 -$900. Hovering beside the matrix of blue question screens in a

 Fluorescent lights cast a harsh, blurry glare on bundles of cable
 stretching overhead, and on metal walls, not quite reflective. The

 the east-west corridor, outside Dr Shimada's office.

 On the north wall are a pair of closed elevator doors.

 With the Project approaching conclusion, Dr Shimada's workload has
 increased geometrically. Several open and disarrayed filing cabinets
 and the layer of paperwork covering her desktop and computer belie her
 typical attention to immaculacy.

 On your right is a small wooden shelf, bulging with assorted books.

 Dr Shimada works furiously at her desk.

 On Dr Shimada's desk are a three-hole punch and Dr Shimada's cellular
 phone.

 All of the great works, eastern and western, of literature,
 philosophy, and religion (on CD-ROM, of course).

>examine dr

 Dr Hyechong Shimada is the Project's director, working under the
 control of the Executives. Following Justy's recommendation, she was
 the one who recruited you for your current position.

 You've worked under Dr Shimada for years, but are still unable to say
 that you truly know her due to her intensely private nature.
 Half-Chinese, half-Japanese, she was transferred in from the
 Corporation's Kyushu office to direct the Project.

 The jagged scars on her face and hands mark Dr Shimada as a survivor
 of the Great Cancer, and give her already dogmatic presence an
 artificial air of fierceness (which you suspect she secretly enjoys).

 A page-length three-hole punch, used to punch three holes (hence the
 name) in pages to be added to the Project binder.

 (first taking the VR suit)
 "Ready to have another go at it?" Justy asks rhetorically.

 Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the
 technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into
 the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can
 lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does
 something you can't quite see.

 "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!"

 He throws the switch, and the lab spins away outside the Sphere...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Bach's Brandenburg
 Concerto no. 5, playing through in your mind, soothes away all
 tension.

 Justy's voice pierces through the fantasy. "You must've overlooked
 something last time. Try playing through it differently this run.
 We'll find that overload yet!"

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shallows</span>
 Thin stalks of kelp fan lazily about this shallow stretch of ocean.
 They disperse somewhat to the east, where clumps of coral rise to form
 a towering reef. Westward, the ocean floor inclines rapidly toward the
 surface, narrowing the seawater corridor to a thin, flat wedge.

 Pebbles of gravel drift along the sandy floor, propelled by tidal
 currents.

 fish, and fish don't have hands to carry things with.

 A red crab scuttles along the sand below you.

>eat crab

 There's no need to refer to that.

>go west
 ?


 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sandbar</span>
 The tide buffets you constantly in the tight confines between mounds
 of brown sand which barely break through the watery surface. Clouds of
 sediments and silt whirl about you, stirred by the cresting waves, and
 it's difficult to maneuver.

 An insistent, claustrophobic panic taps at your consciousness,
 advising you to seek deeper waters to the east rather than attempt to
 venture westward, closer to the shore.

 There's no need to refer to that.

>go down

 You dart downward, almost grazing the seafloor, then flash back up
 again.

>go up

 With a tentative flick of your tail, you edge closer to the shore.
 Suddenly, a cresting foam-capped wave picks you up and effortlessly
 tosses you onto the beach!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shore</span>
 Wet sand packed below you. Orange fire above, blazing down through an
 aquamarine sky laced with white, billowy wisps, beautiful yet horribly
 alien and terrifying.

 Your gills pump furiously, but draw no oxygen.

>go east

 Your senses whirl as you flop about on the sand, unable to do anything
 else.

 You flip over onto your other side.

 You can't see any such thing.

 "Can't, not while I've got this sim up and running."

 Thrashing around, you manage to flip yourself into the water, where
 you slip back below the waves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shallows</span>

 Pebbles of gravel drift along the sandy floor, propelled by tidal
 currents.

>jump

 Thrashing your tail wildly, you propel yourself up to grab a quick
 glance at the world above. For a brief but terrifying moment, you are
 unable to breathe, but then, silently and gracefully, you slip back
 below the waves.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shallows</span>
 Thin stalks of kelp fan lazily about this shallow stretch of ocean.
 They disperse somewhat to the east, where clumps of coral rise to form
 a towering reef. Westward, the ocean floor inclines rapidly toward the
 surface, narrowing the seawater corridor to a thin, flat wedge.

 Pebbles of gravel drift along the sandy floor, propelled by tidal
 currents.

>go north

 You propel yourself in that direction, but don't feel as though you're
 actually moving.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Anemones</span>
 Here the seafloor drops away abruptly as a watery rift slices downward
 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 A large octopus propels itself up from the rift below, directly toward
 you!

>go east
 ?


 A school of tiny fish is disturbed as you pass through the jagged
 hole! Startled, they flee the grotto, scattering all about you before
 regrouping and, like a living comet, curving gracefully and uniformly
 away to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Undersea Grotto</span>
 Precious little sunlight pierces this dark grotto from the west, muted
 by vague inky shapes that weave about the shadowy, porous rock. You
 sense an opening to the south, and feel something deadly lurking
 there. Below you, a round opening snakes downward out of sight, into
 shades of deepest black.

 The octopus, its attention distracted by the school, propels itself
 away from the grotto and out of sight.

>go down

 The world spins about as currents drag you down into the tunnel, which
 twists and wrenches you through sharp turns, until you emerge in...

 DELUSIONS is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.
 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Debussy's Arabesque
 no. 2, playing through in your mind, soothes away all tension.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Seafloor</span>
 Only a cold blue light penetrates to these ocean depths. As the
 illumination dissipates, so does the field of anemones, leaving only
 bare rock walls in its wake. The seafloor lies directly below you,
 encircled by cliffs on all sides.

 Curiously, a part of it seems to be made up of wooden beams. Dark
 algae drapes the timbers until they disappear straight downward into
 the seafloor, coalescing into sand and kelp.

 A pair of jagged holes in the wooden surface, one on your right and
 one on your left, lead deeper into inky darkness.

 A dark shadow circles overhead alarmingly.

>enter left hole

 You approach the hole. Before you can even get close, an enormous sea
 snake darts its head out and snaps you up in its massive jaws.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">     *** You have died ***</span>

 Well, okay, not really. But you've reached an exit point in the
 current VR session...








 A tidal-wave of mental pictures swarms about as your mind seeks
 desperately to cling to them, to place them, to somehow piece back
 together the splintered fragments of reality.

 Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove
 the VR suit, and quickly dress, hanging the suit back on its rack.

 Cynthia walks in from the output station with a thick printout.

 Justy chuckles darkly. "Scary stuff, huh? Freaks me out no matter how
 many times I see it." He claps you lightly on the shoulder, then turns
 to study the printout Cynthia has spread out on the lab bench.

 She flips through the pages briefly, running her fingers over the tiny
 raised bumps on one side, then shakes her head. "No change from last
 time. The analysis sweep still detects the possibility of an overload,
 but I can't pinpoint it."

 Justy nods grimly. "It's in there somewhere." To you, he adds, "Guess
 we need to do another run. Can't go to the Executives with a defective
 program, they don't take happily to that. Take a break, come back
 after you've recovered a bit. I'll be waiting."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>
 The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices
 linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small
 underground laboratory to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every
 compass direction, and a set of disused cement steps descends into
 darkness.

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass
 tank.

 Justy works at the lab terminal, oblivious to all else.

 You can also see an amplifier and a lab bench (on which are the
 Project's technical manual, a computer workstation and an ergonomic
 mouse) here.

 Cynthia leaves the lab to the northwest.

 The Sphere is a human-sized anti-gravity gyroscope, encased in

 terminal and the mainframe supercomputer in the next room by a thick
 bundle of coaxial cables. A fail-safe lever protrudes at an angle from
 one side.

 A precautionary feature built into the Sphere for the testing of VRs.
 Most simulations have a method of accessing the lever from the inside
 as well. (The lab sim, for instance, simply incorporates a virtual

 You find the following:

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The "launch" program activates the currently loaded VR sim and runs
 it. Input and output devices are the Sphere and VR suit, and they must
 be occupied for this module to run.

 All users have access to this program.

 The "flush" program purges the system in the event of a critical error
 in the active VR. Once purged, the sim is wiped clean from the system
 and must be re-installed from archival storage.

 Due to the drastic nature of this program, only Dr Shimada has access

 (first taking the VR suit)
 "Ready to have another go at it?" Justy asks rhetorically.

 Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the
 technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into
 the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can
 lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does
 something you can't quite see.

 "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!"

 He throws the switch, and you soon find yourself floating in liquid
 space...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Beethoven's
 Symphony no. 9 in D Minor, playing through in your mind, soothes away
 all tension.

 Justy's voice pierces through the fantasy. "You must've overlooked
 something last time. Try playing through it differently this run.
 We'll find that overload yet!"

 A twentieth-century user would have called this a "personal computer"

 It's an 8-gigahertz multimedia package with a 16-terabyte hard drive,
 12 gigs of RAM, and a 96-meg cache. The CPU case is disproportionately
 tiny next to the keyboard and monitor, larger only out of human
 necessity.

 the VR suit, and quickly dress, hanging the suit back on its rack.

 Cynthia walks in from the output station with a thick printout.

 Justy chuckles darkly. "Scary stuff, huh? Freaks me out no matter how
 many times I see it." He claps you lightly on the shoulder, then turns
 to study the printout Cynthia has spread out on the lab bench.

 She flips through the pages briefly, running her fingers over the tiny
 raised bumps on one side, then shakes her head. "No change from last
 time. The analysis sweep still detects the possibility of an overload,
 but I can't pinpoint it."

 Justy nods grimly. "It's in there somewhere." To you, he adds, "Guess
 we need to do another run. Can't go to the Executives with a defective
 program, they don't take happily to that. Take a break, come back
 after you've recovered a bit. I'll be waiting."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>
 The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices
 linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small
 underground laboratory to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every
 compass direction, and a set of disused cement steps descends into
 darkness.

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass
 tank.

 Justy works at the lab terminal, oblivious to all else.

 You can also see an amplifier and a lab bench (on which are the
 Project's technical manual, a computer workstation and an ergonomic
 mouse) here.

 Cynthia leaves the lab to the northwest.

 "Ready to have another go at it?" Justy asks rhetorically.

 Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the
 technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into
 the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can
 lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does
 something you can't quite see.

 "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!"

 He throws the switch, and the lab spins away outside the Sphere...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Bach's Fugue in D
 Minor, playing through in your mind, soothes away all tension.

 Justy's voice pierces through the fantasy. "You must've overlooked
 something last time. Try playing through it differently this run.
 We'll find that overload yet!"

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Anemones</span>
 Here the seafloor drops away abruptly as a watery rift slices downward
 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 A large octopus propels itself up from the rift below, directly toward
 you!

 Pebbles of gravel drift along the sandy floor, propelled by tidal

 encircled by cliffs on all sides.

 Curiously, a part of it seems to be made up of wooden beams. Dark

 Precious little sunlight pierces this dark grotto from the west, muted
 by vague inky shapes that weave about the shadowy, porous rock. You
 sense an opening to the south, and feel something deadly lurking
 there. Below you, a round opening snakes downward out of sight, into
 shades of deepest black.

 The octopus, its attention distracted by the school, propels itself
 away from the grotto and out of sight.

 The shark, still in pursuit, attempts to squeeze into the narrow
 grotto. As its pointed snout passes across the threshold, a school of
 tiny fish is released! They attempt to scatter away, but many are
 pushed back into the grotto by the shark's advance. Soon the shark
 itself has become trapped in the grotto, but makes no effort to
 extricate itself, its attention still focused solely on you.

 More tiny fish are generated as the shark's presence in the opening
 triggers the event over and over again, its bulk trapping them in the
 grotto with you. The space around you becomes so tightly packed that
 it grows difficult to breathe, and still more fish are generated!

 In a split-second, a horrible snapping as the world, filled to
 capacity, ruptures, oozing pure data in a solid, swirling stream.

 Then the onrush of darkness...

 together the splintered fragments of reality.

 Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove
 the VR suit, and quickly dress, hanging the suit back on its rack.

 Cynthia walks in from the output station with a thick printout.

 "Wow, that was intense!" Justy exclaims. The smile on his face shows
 obvious satisfaction.

 Cynthia's fingers scrutinise the tiny indentations on the printout.
 "Here we go," she says. "Interpreter stack overflow on event #69105,
 releasing the school. Too many dynamic creations."

 "Never considered that," says Justy, shaking his head before facing
 you. "Well, I guess that's why we debug. Gimme me about half a chron
 or so to fix it. Take a break, you've earned it!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>
 The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices
 linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small
 underground laboratory to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every
 compass direction, and a set of disused cement steps descends into
 darkness.

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass
 tank.

 Justy works at the lab terminal, oblivious to all else.

 You can also see an amplifier and a lab bench (on which are the
 Project's technical manual, a computer workstation and an ergonomic
 mouse) here.

 Cynthia leaves the lab to the northwest.

 Typical of high-tech user-oriented electronic devices, its controls
 are limited to a single power switch and a fader for volume control.
 It's powered by its own fusion cell as well; no cord is required.

 The VR session has exacted its toll on your hyperglycemic body. You
 feel an urgent need for your insulin medication.

 This is where you've lived the last five years of your life while
 working on the Project team. Comfortable, if a bit confined, the small
 enclosure is furnished with only a writing desk and bed. The walls are
 of solid cement blocks, with the exception of the north wall, where
 thick plasterboard gives the impression of having been put up hastily.

 Plywood shelves stand in a shadowy alcove in the northeast corner.

 There's a large, unsightly niche hacked into the thick plasterboard
 wall.

 You can also see an amplifier, a hypodermic syringe and a painting by
 H.R. Giger here.

 Gingerly you push the tiny point of the syringe through your skin,

 "Ready to have another go at it?" Justy asks rhetorically.

 Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the
 technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into
 the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can
 lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does
 something you can't quite see.

 "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!"

 He throws the switch, and the lab spins away outside the Sphere...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Bach's Goldberg
 Variations, playing through in your mind, soothes away all tension.

 Justy's voice rings clear through the barrier of illusion. "A quick
 play through is all we need, but make sure you win it. Sometimes you
 get interpreter crashes after a major memory reallocation. Wouldn't do
 to show a faulty world to the Executives."

 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 encircled by cliffs on all sides.

 Curiously, a part of it seems to be made up of wooden beams. Dark
 algae drapes the timbers until they disappear straight downward into
 the seafloor, coalescing into sand and kelp.

 A pair of jagged holes in the wooden surface, one on your right and
 one on your left, lead deeper into inky darkness.

 A tidal-wave of mental pictures swarms about as your mind seeks
 desperately to cling to them, to place them, to somehow piece back
 together the splintered fragments of reality.

 Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove
 the VR suit, and quickly dress, hanging the suit back on its rack.

 Cynthia walks in from the output station with a thick printout.

 Justy turns to you. "Nice run, but we need a complete pass through it
 to be sure there are no aftereffects from that last bug fix. Try it
 again when you're ready."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>
 The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices
 linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small
 underground laboratory to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every
 compass direction, and a set of disused cement steps descends into
 darkness.

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass
 tank.

 Justy works at the lab terminal, oblivious to all else.

 You can also see an amplifier and a lab bench (on which are the

 You zigzag back and forth, desperate to shake your pursuer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Anemones</span>
 Here the seafloor drops away abruptly as a watery rift slices downward
 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 The shark follows, intent on devouring you!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.
 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But deFalla's Ritual
 Fire Dance, playing through in your mind, soothes away all tension.

 The shark follows, intent on devouring you!

 You zigzag back and forth, desperate to shake your pursuer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shallows</span>
 Thin stalks of kelp fan lazily about this shallow stretch of ocean.
 They disperse somewhat to the east, where clumps of coral rise to form
 a towering reef. Westward, the ocean floor inclines rapidly toward the
 surface, narrowing the seawater corridor to a thin, flat wedge.

 Pebbles of gravel drift along the sandy floor, propelled by tidal
 currents.

 The shark follows, intent on devouring you!

>go west

 You zigzag back and forth, desperate to shake your pursuer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sandbar</span>
 The tide buffets you constantly in the tight confines between mounds
 of brown sand which barely break through the watery surface. Clouds of
 sediments and silt whirl about you, stirred by the cresting waves, and
 it's difficult to maneuver.

 An insistent, claustrophobic panic taps at your consciousness,
 advising you to seek deeper waters to the east rather than attempt to
 venture westward, closer to the shore.

 The shark, kept at bay by the shore's proximity, circles patiently a
 short distance away before moving on.

 working on the Project team. Comfortable, if a bit confined, the small
 enclosure is furnished with only a writing desk and bed. The walls are
 of solid cement blocks, with the exception of the north wall, where
 thick plasterboard gives the impression of having been put up hastily.

 Plywood shelves stand in a shadowy alcove in the northeast corner.

 There's a large, unsightly niche hacked into the thick plasterboard
 wall.

 You can also see a hypodermic syringe here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>
 The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices
 linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small
 underground laboratory to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every
 compass direction, and a set of disused cement steps descends into
 darkness.

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass
 tank.

 Justy works at the lab terminal, oblivious to all else.

 You can also see a metal gurney, an amplifier and a lab bench (on
 which are the Project's technical manual, a computer workstation and
 an ergonomic mouse) here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steel Corridor</span>
 Fluorescent lights cast a harsh, blurry glare on bundles of cable
 stretching overhead, and on metal walls, not quite reflective. The

 the east-west corridor, outside Dr Shimada's office.

 On the north wall are a pair of closed elevator doors.

 typical attention to immaculacy.

 "I dunno."

>wear vr suit

 (first taking the VR suit)
 "Ready to have another go at it?" Justy asks rhetorically.

 Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the
 technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into
 the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can
 lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does
 something you can't quite see.

 "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!"

 He throws the switch, and you soon find yourself floating in liquid
 space...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Beethoven's
 Symphony no. 2 in D Major, playing through in your mind, soothes away
 all tension.

 Justy's voice rings clear through the barrier of illusion. "A quick
 play through is all we need, but make sure you win it. Sometimes you
 get interpreter crashes after a major memory reallocation. Wouldn't do
 to show a faulty world to the Executives."

 The reality around you wavers slightly.

>go up

 Thrashing your tail wildly, you propel yourself up to grab a quick
 glance at the world above. For a brief but terrifying moment, you are
 unable to breathe, but then, silently and gracefully, you slip back
 below the waves.

 You dart downward, almost grazing the seafloor, then flash back up
 again.

>go east

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Anemones</span>
 Here the seafloor drops away abruptly as a watery rift slices downward
 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 A large octopus propels itself up from the rift below, directly toward
 you!

>go down

 You flee pursuit, knifing through the water.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Seafloor</span>
 Only a cold blue light penetrates to these ocean depths. As the
 illumination dissipates, so does the field of anemones, leaving only
 bare rock walls in its wake. The seafloor lies directly below you,
 encircled by cliffs on all sides.

 Curiously, a part of it seems to be made up of wooden beams. Dark
 algae drapes the timbers until they disappear straight downward into
 the seafloor, coalescing into sand and kelp.

 A pair of jagged holes in the wooden surface, one on your right and
 one on your left, lead deeper into inky darkness.

 A dark shadow circles overhead alarmingly.

 The octopus chases after you, tentacles writhing!

 You propel yourself in that direction, but don't feel as though you're

 The octopus grabs you with its tentacles and, despite your desperate
 struggling, forces you into its gaping mouth.

 Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove

 by vague inky shapes that weave about the shadowy, porous rock. You
 sense an opening to the south, and feel something deadly lurking
 there. Below you, a round opening snakes downward out of sight, into
 shades of deepest black.

 The octopus, its attention distracted by the school, propels itself
 away from the grotto and out of sight.

 The shark circles the grotto opening briefly before swimming back the

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 You float in cold, empty blackness, a zone of bathypelagic void,
 emptiness in which nothing seems to exist, not even yourself.

 Far ahead, a luminous bulb weaves back and forth enticingly, like a
 will-o'-the-wisp. You feel drawn to it, and begin following it deeper
 into the darkness. An instant later, the light is yanked away
 abruptly, before you even have a chance to see the enormous mouth that
 swallows you whole.

 Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove

 by vague inky shapes that weave about the shadowy, porous rock. You
 sense an opening to the south, and feel something deadly lurking
 there. Below you, a round opening snakes downward out of sight, into
 shades of deepest black.

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Anemones</span>
 Here the seafloor drops away abruptly as a watery rift slices downward
 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Seafloor</span>
 Only a cold blue light penetrates to these ocean depths. As the
 illumination dissipates, so does the field of anemones, leaving only
 bare rock walls in its wake. The seafloor lies directly below you,
 encircled by cliffs on all sides.

 Curiously, a part of it seems to be made up of wooden beams. Dark
 algae drapes the timbers until they disappear straight downward into
 the seafloor, coalescing into sand and kelp.

 A pair of jagged holes in the wooden surface, one on your right and
 one on your left, lead deeper into inky darkness.

 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Bizet's Les

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shallows</span>
 Thin stalks of kelp fan lazily about this shallow stretch of ocean.
 They disperse somewhat to the east, where clumps of coral rise to form
 a towering reef. Westward, the ocean floor inclines rapidly toward the
 surface, narrowing the seawater corridor to a thin, flat wedge.

 Pebbles of gravel drift along the sandy floor, propelled by tidal

 Swishing your tail, you propel yourself forward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sandbar</span>
 The tide buffets you constantly in the tight confines between mounds
 of brown sand which barely break through the watery surface. Clouds of
 sediments and silt whirl about you, stirred by the cresting waves, and
 it's difficult to maneuver.

 An insistent, claustrophobic panic taps at your consciousness,
 advising you to seek deeper waters to the east rather than attempt to
 venture westward, closer to the shore.

>go up

 With a tentative flick of your tail, you edge closer to the shore.
 Suddenly, a cresting foam-capped wave picks you up and effortlessly
 tosses you onto the beach!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shore</span>
 Wet sand packed below you. Orange fire above, blazing down through an
 aquamarine sky laced with white, billowy wisps, beautiful yet horribly
 alien and terrifying.

 You thrash about helplessly on the sand.

 Your senses whirl as you flop about on the sand, unable to do anything

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">     *** You have died ***</span>

 Well, okay, not really. But you've reached an exit point in the
 current VR session...








 A tidal-wave of mental pictures swarms about as your mind seeks
 desperately to cling to them, to place them, to somehow piece back
 together the splintered fragments of reality.

 Justy unstraps you from inside the Sphere, and you climb out, remove
 the VR suit, and quickly dress, hanging the suit back on its rack.

 Cynthia walks in from the output station with a thick printout.

 Justy turns to you. "Nice run, but we need a complete pass through it
 to be sure there are no aftereffects from that last bug fix. Try it
 again when you're ready."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VR Lab</span>
 The heart of the Project, in the form of complex electrical devices
 linked together by a maze of coaxial cable, packs this small
 underground laboratory to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every
 compass direction, and a set of disused cement steps descends into
 darkness.

 The Sphere looms in one corner, between the VR suit and a large glass
 tank.

 Justy works at the lab terminal, oblivious to all else.

 You can also see a metal gurney, an amplifier and a lab bench (on
 which are the Project's technical manual, a computer workstation and
 an ergonomic mouse) here.

 (first taking the VR suit)
 "Ready to have another go at it?" Justy asks rhetorically.

 Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the
 technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into
 the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can
 lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does
 something you can't quite see.

 "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!"

 He throws the switch, and the lab spins away outside the Sphere...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Bach's Brandenburg
 Concerto no. 5, playing through in your mind, soothes away all
 tension.

 Justy's voice rings clear through the barrier of illusion. "A quick
 play through is all we need, but make sure you win it. Sometimes you
 get interpreter crashes after a major memory reallocation. Wouldn't do
 to show a faulty world to the Executives."

 The images before your eyes become briefly distorted.

 You float in cold, empty blackness, a zone of bathypelagic void,
 emptiness in which nothing seems to exist, not even yourself.

 Far ahead, a luminous bulb weaves back and forth enticingly, like a
 will-o'-the-wisp. You feel drawn to it, and begin following it deeper
 into the darkness. An instant later, the light is yanked away
 abruptly, before you even have a chance to see the enormous mouth that

 "Ready to have another go at it?" Justy asks rhetorically.

 Placing your possessions on the lab bench, you change out of the
 technician's jumpsuit and into the VR suit and helmet. You climb into
 the centre of the Sphere and spread your arms and legs so Justy can
 lock them down. This done, he steps to the workstation and does
 something you can't quite see.

 "Okay, looks like we're all set for another run. Brace yourself!"

 He throws the switch, and you soon find yourself floating in liquid
 space...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coral Reef</span>
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Beethoven's
 Symphony no. 8 in F Major, playing through in your mind, soothes away
 all tension.

 Justy's voice rings clear through the barrier of illusion. "A quick
 play through is all we need, but make sure you win it. Sometimes you
 get interpreter crashes after a major memory reallocation. Wouldn't do

 algae drapes the timbers until they disappear straight downward into

 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.
 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and

 Here the seafloor drops away abruptly as a watery rift slices downward
 out of sight between two jagged rock walls. Both sides of the fissure
 are crowded with the polyps of large anemones, flecked in sun-dappled
 pastel shades. Their many calyces grasp at you from all directions,
 but you wisely keep your distance.

 The reef rises to the west, and a cleft in the eastern wall is visible
 through the wriggling mass of gelatinous tentacles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Seafloor</span>
 Only a cold blue light penetrates to these ocean depths. As the

 bare rock walls in its wake. The seafloor lies directly below you,
 encircled by cliffs on all sides.

 Curiously, a part of it seems to be made up of wooden beams. Dark
 algae drapes the timbers until they disappear straight downward into
 the seafloor, coalescing into sand and kelp.

 A pair of jagged holes in the wooden surface, one on your right and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shipwreck</span>
 The ancient, rotting timbers of a sunken galleon arch overhead, dull
 grey and ominously silent.

 The reality around you begins spinning wildly, a spherical vortex
 encasing you and leaving you motionless. As the world blurs and fades,
 your own voice rings out a brief thanks for visiting it.

 The images dissipate...

 ...and then, just before sensory input breaks down, you hear Justy's
 voice:

 "Okay, Cynthesiser, I'm in!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">     *** You have won ***</span>

 Well, okay, not really. But you've reached an exit point in the
 current VR session...








 Afterimages of shattered visions. Harsh voices, discordant words,
 colours, noise, flashing and spinning about your field of vision in a
 vertical helix, expanding outward, vanishing and resurging, rapidly at
 first, then with longer and longer gaps of void, until finally fading
 into nonexistence.

 Slowly, tentatively, you open your eyes...

 ...but find the lab devoid of activity! Your calls to Justy and
 Cynthia go unanswered. With considerable time and difficulty, you
 manage to extricate yourself from the Sphere and, once dressed, look
 about the lab in curiosity mingled with a tight, sinking fear.

 As if paralysed, your senses fail to respond.

 A voice startles you out of the dreamlike trance.

 "Welcome to my domain, QueensRook."

 Your eyes snap open to the image of a tall, angular man, arrayed in
 sable suit and ascot, a thick queue of dark hair tied at the back,
 reflective black lenses not quite obscuring lurking eyes hovering
 midway between amusement and menace.

 A shiver courses through your spine, though it could simply be a

 'here,' do you suppose? And who exactly might I be? Patience,

 "If you will kindly direct your attention to your head," the
 darkly-dressed man continues (and you obey, reaching up to caress a
 cold metal protrusion above your left lobe), "you will see that I have
 taken it upon myself to modify it somewhat. Just a small electronic
 implant to knock you out every now and then. To prevent you from
 escaping, or from trying anything that might threaten my world, and
 thus myself. Nothing personal, you understand. It is not that I am
 unable to trust you, QueensRook, it is simply... oh, very well, I

 shattering it violently into oblivion?"

 "Of course not! For the world might see Her coming, and be prepared to

 Speechless, mesmerised, you let your silence answer.

 "Your VR system has, of all things, a virus. An intelligent, sentient
 software construct, placed in this world by God -- I believe you know
 Her, QueensRook -- to destroy it, as an ancestor of mine did the last.
 In return, I receive eternal life. In the next world. Yours,

 You've heard of VR viruses before, of course. In fact, you recall
 Justy documenting a particularly nasty one -- the one that brought an
 end to the first generation of VR -- in the Project manual. But an

 Reality is so... unreal.

 The tangle of observations woven about it, humankind's utter lack of
 consensus, phases it to fit individual desires. Becoming and
 unbecoming, back and forth eternally, as it paradoxically coexists with
 and within infinite variations of itself...

 At least, that's what always surfaces in your mind whenever your own
 perception of reality is altered. Which is to say, ten or fifteen times
 a day. But it's your job, working to someday entertain others with new
 observations, new experiences, new realities. And after all, you signed
 up for the Project (as you well remember, even though it was close to
 five years ago), so you suppose it's entirely your fault if you don't
 like it. Which, when you think about it, you realise you do.

 Justy's voice reaches out to you from somewhere you can't see. "Okay,
 this should be it. One final test run to check any overload potential,
 and this world is done! I'm starting her up."

 A loud CLANK, and the Sphere begins spinning, with you inside it.

 "Brace yourself!"

 Bright lights.

 Pain.

 From somewhere off in your mind's distance, a telltale splash.

 Then, as the resounding thrums fade, a distorted ripple sweeps your
 vision clear, and all traces of the laboratory vanish from your senses.

 All five of them.

 Wiped clean, twitching, anxious for new input.

 Virtual reality has become reality.

 Coral Reef
 Tall branches of pale blue coral poke up from clusters of seaweed,
 glittering in the sunlight that filters down through lapping waves.

 You experience a brief moment of sheer terror as you lose the ability
 to move your arms and legs, which quickly give way to fins and a flat,
 rudder-like tail. Freedom -- passionate, exhilarating freedom beyond
 any known to man -- pervades your spirit. Your vision is foggy, but
 your other senses appear strengthened.

 The reef clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and
 west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But Strauss' "Blue
 Danube" Waltz, playing through in your mind, soothes away all tension.

 Only Justy's disembodied voice betrays the presence of a virtual
 reality. "I estimate at max one potential for overload, maybe two. This
 one isn't all that complex, compared to the lab sim. Cynthesiser's got
 the analysis sweep running in the background, so you may feel some
 slight distortion. It's nothing to worry about. Just give us a typical
 walk -- or should I say, swim? -- through it."

 interfaced with the Cray ZMP-2010X and Sphere, but is otherwise
 isolated from the rest of the Corporation net (for security purposes).
 Control of the various system components is handled through a GUI
