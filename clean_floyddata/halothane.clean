            [depress SPACE......]








 You'll never really know how it all started.

 That's not surprising, because you're not even sure what happened in
 the first place. If it had been anything else, you would have dismissed
 it as ninety-nine per cent bad digestion and one percent fancy, much as
 Ebenezer Scrooge would have. Somehow, in this case, that explanation
 doesn't really grab you. Did it really mean anything? Or was it, as the
 physiologists would say, just a matter of a few neurons in your
 brainstem working overtime?

 But life is strange. It's almost impossible to predict - as Heisenberg
 pointed out - where exactly you might end up, even when you start in as
 mundane a place as your own home....

 Your Bedroom
 This is hardly the place for an adventure to begin. You know the
 furniture of this room - desk, chair, bed and bookcase - almost as well
 as the contents of your pockets.

 On the wooden desk is a dusty manuscript.

>Oh, yeah, the british
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>about
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine me
 Harold Banks, auteur manqu?.

>xyzzy
 A hollow voice says, "Nice try, but no cigar!"

>examine manuscript
 A pile of false starts to the Great Global Novel that you plan to
 complete someday. It deals with 25th century people who try to
 understand the lunacy of the 20th century by travelling in time to the
 28th. It also includes no gratuitous sex or violence, which explains
 why no publisher's ever been interested in it.

 The manuscript is in a state of disarray, which is strange considering
 that - since you live alone - no one else but you could have touched
 it. Pages 102 to 205 are spreadeagled, and you fancy you can see
 something buried under it - but you're not sure what.

>look under it
 You rootle among the papers for a few seconds, and find a flower and a
 note buried amongst them. Funny, you don't remember putting them
 there....

 [Your score has just gone up by four points.]

>examine flower
 It's unlike any flower you've ever seen before; it has, in blatant
 defiance of whatever the botanists say, an outer whorl containing six
 yellow petals, and an inner whorl of four pointed, unnatural-looking
 pink petals. You're sure you've seen it before, but you can't remember
 where...

>examine note
 A small, nondescript scrap of paper. Strangely, though the paper itself
 looks like it was torn from one of your numerous notepads, the words on
 it are printed, rather than written in your sprawling hand.
 You can't help but feel that there's a purpose to all this.....

>remember flower
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>read note

 In a slanting, Old-World style font, the following words are printed -
 Fran?ois, Ch 1. Lines 34 - 39.

 "Let there be light", a Voice said. "But before there can be light", it
 continued, "there must be a source of light".

 "And", added the Author, "a light producer".

 "That might be a little difficult for the future generations to
 understand", the Voice rebuked.

 "Very well", replied the Author. "We shall use an ancient word - the
 Greek halogenos, the light producer.

 "That is good", the Voice sighed. "But things have a knack of getting
 lost in transl....."
 [Here the line ends in mid-sentence, as if the printing process was
 suddenly interrupted.]

>examine pockets
 Empty as usual.

>touch petals
>inventory
>smell flower
 You feel nothing unexpected.

 You are carrying nothing.

 You take a deep breath - but smell absolutely nothing. Bizarre...

>take note, flower, manuscript
 small note: Taken.
 yellow flower: Taken.
 dusty manuscript: It's too late to work on them; you'd merely make a
 lot of embarrassing spelling mistakes if you did.

>eat flower
 Your keen nutritional sense tells you that this flower probably isn't
 too high on vitamins, so you give it a skip.

>examine desk
 It's supposed to be a desk, but it's just the place you dump all your
 half-completed manuscripts on. Simple, functional - it doesn't even
 have drawers or anything like that.

>look under desk
 Ah, your trusty fan. You pull it out, anticipating a rather high
 nocturnal temperature.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>examine fan
 A device to ensure that you get enough breeze to enable you to fall
 asleep without Valium, security blankets, or air-conditioning.
 Battery-powered, too, so you don't have to worry about tripping through
 wires.
 The fan is currently switched off.

>open it
 That's not something you can open.

>l in it
 You find nothing of interest.

>take fan
 You already have that.

>bookcases
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine bookcases
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine bookcase
 Until about five years ago, other people could approach this bookcase
 with impunity, as it was cluttered with other people's writings.
 Currently, however, it is solely used to store your own. It's currently
 closed.

>open it
 You open the bookcase, revealing a copy of your first novel.

>examine copy
 It's a copy of your first novel, "Before Our Time", which deals with
 people of the 25th Century trying to understand the 20th Century by
 searching for the lost archives of the 22nd Century. It sold exactly
 forty copies (strange - the last time you counted your family members,
 there were only twenty-six), but you've given away about ten times that
 number as birthday presents.

>read it
 You know this one even more in detail than your untitled current
 effort. You even mumble the characters' names in your sleep, until
 people wonder whether you're a paranoid schizophrenic.

>what is my obsession with the 20th century?
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take copy
 Taken.

>open it
 That's not something you can open.

 This is hardly the place for an adventure to begin. You know the
 furniture of this room - desk, chair, bed and bookcase - almost as well
 as the contents of your pockets.

 On the wooden desk is a dusty manuscript.

>examine chair
 It's not exactly ergonomic, but it sure is comfortable. It's propped up
 right next to your bed, as usual, just in case you feel like a spot of
 night-time reading.

>write a new novel about a sexy harlot
 What do you want to write on?

>examine bed
 A nice model, or at least it was when you bought it twenty years ago.
 It looks as inviting as it always does after 11 p.m. on an average
 weekday.

>look under bed
 Nothing but dust. There used to be pages of your manuscript flying
 around there before, but ever since you had a brainwave and strung them
 together, that doesn't happen often.

>examine pen
 You can't see any such thing.

>search for a pen
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine find pen
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine pages
 A pile of false starts to the Great Global Novel that you plan to
 complete someday. It deals with 25th century people who try to
 understand the lunacy of the 20th century by travelling in time to the

 why no publisher's ever been interested in it.

>stand
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>leave
 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>go north
 It's way past your bedtime, and you're feeling too sleepy to do
 anything except get into bed.

>exits
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>enter bed
 You get onto the old bed.

>sleep
 It's way too hot for you to fall asleep. Maybe if you had some
 ventilation.....

>turn on fan

 This is hardly the place for an adventure to begin. You know the
 furniture of this room - desk, chair, bed and bookcase - almost as well
 as the contents of your pockets.

 On the wooden desk is a dusty manuscript.

>put fan on chair
 You put the fan on the chair; it's now pointing more or less towards
 your bed.

 [Your score has just gone up by four points.]

>put fan on chair
 You need to be holding the fan before you can put it on top of
 something else.

>get in bed
 You get onto the old bed.

>turn on fan
 You switch the fan on.

>sleep
 You feel yourself drifting slowly into sleep. Strangely enough, the
 breeze from the fan doesn't quite smell like night air, or even like
 yesterday's leftovers...Your back touches cold metal, and your level of
 consciousness wavers. A voice floats around your head, in one ear
 first, the other next...

 "Welcome to your world."

 Chapter One - Respiratory Distress

 Operating Room (on the operating table)
 This looks suspiciously like the operating room they took you to when
 you were much, much younger, to have your tonsils taken out. However,
 it's strangely empty. The only obvious exit is through a door to the
 west.

 Standing near the bed is a slightly broken trolley.

 A small gauze face mask, of the type worn by surgeons during an
 operation, lies discarded on the floor.

 A simple mask, disposable, and meant to cover the mouth and nose of all
 those who enter the O.R. It looks as if it hasn't been used, but - if
 so - why was it thrown here?

 Instrument Room
 A small, narrow annexe to the O.R., where scalpels, forceps and the

 east, back to the O.R., there are only four walls around you, that
 don't look very interesting, and an LCD display panel facing you.
 There is a faint suggestion of disinfectant in the air.

 Strangely, there are no instruments here, just a blue cylinder.

>examine lcd
 The LCD display panel - judging by the fact that there are no switches,
 power lines or knobs in the vicinity, its supply source is a mystery to
 you. It seems to work just like it's meant to, displaying letters and
 numbers. (How exciting.)
 It currently has nothing to say.

 A blue cylinder with a valve attached to it, with a black mark across
 one side indicating that it's been marked for disposal. One side bears
 a single word in red letters, with some smaller print underneath:

 First Interposition - Invasion of Privacy

 Driveway, Outside House
 You stand, hesitantly, on a futuristic-looking driveway, feeling that
 you've somehow been here before. There is nothing to guide you, except
 a door standing east of you, and a sign next to it.

 Even the name on the sign sounds familiar, though you can't remember
 why.

 The door to the house, not at all imposing, is closed.

 [Your score has just gone up by six points.]

>read sign
 A plaque built into one of the walls, serving the function of a
 nameplate and little else, glowing with a dim light. It only bears the
 surname "Franklin", and a quotation, which seems to have been added to
 the plaque later:

 "Your Excellency has perhaps erred in trying to fight fire with fire;
 sometimes the simple bucket of water is as effective."

 You recoil in wonder, recognizing the quote as your own.

 Strangely, the driveway doesn't bear the stigmas of repeated driving,
 but there are scorch marks in an odd distribution, as if some other
 vehicle habitually passed along it.

 A simple, tasteful wooden door, which is strange if you assume that
 this is, indeed, the future. Even the pattern with which it is

 you've somehow been here before. There is nothing to guide you, except
 a door standing east of you, and a sign next to it.

 The door to the house, not at all imposing, is closed.

>go east
 (opening the door first)

 Front Hall, in the house
 The front hall is large, spacious and exudes an air of good taste. A
 tall archway leads north from it to the rest of the house (which is
 dark), and a large sofa, forming a rectangular C, fills the room. In
 one corner is an ornamental shelf.

 The front door stands wide open.

 There's a blue shawl draped over the sofa.

 On the large plush sofa is a small piece of paper.

 You can also see a small memo here.

>examine shawl
 A simple blue shawl, with a frilled border - or at least you assume
 it's frilled; you're not sure what quirks fashion has acquired in time
 to come. Stripes of paler blue, that can only be discerned when you
 look closely, run diagonally across it. In one corner, in letters that
 glow eerily when you look at them at an angle, is a dedication : "From
 Edward". You assume it's a woman's garment, but - knowing fashion as
 you do - you're not sure.

>examine paper
 (the small note)
 A small, nondescript scrap of paper. Strangely, though the paper itself
 looks like it was torn from one of your numerous notepads, the words on
 it are printed, rather than written in your sprawling hand.

>read paper
 (the small note)

 In a slanting, Old-World style font, the following words are printed -
 Fran?ois, Ch 1. Lines 34 - 39.

 "Let there be light", a Voice said. "But before there can be light", it
 continued, "there must be a source of light".

 "And", added the Author, "a light producer".

 "That might be a little difficult for the future generations to
 understand", the Voice rebuked.

 "Very well", replied the Author. "We shall use an ancient word - the
 Greek halogenos, the light producer.

 A small scrap of paper, torn from some sort of notebook, with a small
 diagram and a few words written on it in a firm, slanting hand.

>make a paper airplane
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Though it certainly is elegant enough at first glance, the sofa has a
 warm, lived-in look about it, as if it were the seat of choice of a
 close-knit family.

 A small memorandum form - or fiche or whatever the accursed term is,
 with some words on it, printed the same way as those on the note you
 found in your bedroom.

>read memo

 Fran?ois, Ch.1, Lines 40 - 50.

 "Life is strange", the Voice observed, in a doomy voice.

 "Well, we have no one to blame for that", the Author replied,
 assertively. "After all, we have created this strangeness by
 ourselves."

 "I drown in depths", the Voice complained, obviously annoyed by the
 Author's cocky replies. "We create a character, and he creates another.
 But we have never attempted to interfere in his life..."

 "Except until now", the Author reminded him.

 "Very well, except until now. But can we allow him to interfere with
 his own creation?"

 The Author laughed. "He doesn't yet appreciate the value of his own
 creations. Perhaps now he will".

 "D?ja vu", the Voice replied, irritably. "Are you trying to tell me we
 have created an insecure, neurotic protagonist, after all this time?
 After all our endeavours? All our - er - programming?"

 "Wait and see", the Author replied, and.......
 [Here the printing stops suddenly.]

 Front Hall, in the house
 The front hall is large, spacious and exudes an air of good taste. A
 tall archway leads north from it to the rest of the house (which is
 dark), and a large sofa, forming a rectangular C, fills the room. In
 one corner is an ornamental shelf.

 The front door stands wide open.

 There's a blue shawl draped over the sofa.

 On the large plush sofa is a small piece of paper.

>read small piece of paper
 The diagram is a small graph, whose exact meaning is not obvious. It's
 a bell-shaped curve, like the statistician's Gaussian distribution, but
 with the words "Age" and "Stability" written along the X- and Y-axes
 respectively. Names of nations (you assume) - all of them familiar to
 you from your works - are written along the curve as it progresses, in
 the following order: "Provinces, Kingdoms, Europe, China, Colonies".
 You wonder if - possibly? - your semi-fictitious theories have actually
 taken root in the far, far future. Somehow, the idea does grab you.

>take it
 Taken.

>close door
 Which do you mean, the door to the house or the small, ornamental
 shelf?

>close front door
 You close the door to the house.

>examine front door
 A simple, tasteful wooden door, which is strange if you assume that
 this is, indeed, the future. Even the pattern with which it is
 decorated looks more Victorian than post-apocalyptic.

>examine shelf
 The shelf is not exactly part of the wall, but seems joined to it in an
 intriguing manner. It's filled, quite as you would expect, with
 well-worn copies of various texts. It is currently closed off by a thin
 glass door, which seems to be quite easily openable.

>open shelf
 You open the small, ornamental shelf.

>look on shelf
>open glass door
 In the small, ornamental shelf are a row of critical texts.

 That's already open.

>examine texts
 The books in the shelf are a series of scholarly-looking treatises,
 ranging from "The Memoir As Discovery" by Stephen Gilmour to "Literary
 Classes and Categories" by Julia Franklin. Obviously, someone in this
 house is a literary critic.

>examine memoir
 You can't see any such thing.

>read texts
 Curiosity gets the better of you. You pull out a text at random and
 flip through the pages. The book is written far more lucidly than
 criticism ever was in your days, and you note with an air of approval
 that at last, a woman can write a straight story without being
 considered a traitor to the Feminist Cause.
 Finally, after a few enjoyable minutes, you replace the book.

>wear shawl
 (first taking the blue shawl)
 You try on the shawl, but you can't seriously see yourself - or a man
 of the 29th Century for that matter - wearing it. It is, beyond doubt,
 a woman's shawl.

>search sofa
 There is nothing on the large plush sofa.

>look under shelf
 Nothing here, I'm afraid.

>go north

 Under the Arch
 Currently, you are standing underneath a tall and imposing arch, that
 serves as a line of demarcation between the wide hall and the more
 residential portion of the house. This small passageway leads further
 north, south back into the hall, and runs on either side to the smaller
 wings of the house.
 The sense of familiarity you felt when you first stood outside the
 house grows even stronger.

>examine arch
 Made of polished marble, the arch seems to emit a dim, warm glow whose
 origin you are uncertain of.

>touch arch
 Good attempt. The game you're thinking of, though, was already written
 two competitions back. And, anyway, there's nothing scientific about
 this house.

>go north
 You have the strange feeling that the north end of the house - probably
 the kitchen and dining-hall - are not exactly germane to your current
 situation.

>relevant
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west

 Corridor, Down the West Wing
 A small corridor, leading from the vertical corridor down the middle of
 the house to a darkened room.
 You can hear voices coming from the west.

>listen
 A man's voice and a woman's voice, engaged in rational discussion, but
 with a faint tremor of nervousness nonetheless. You listen harder....

 "Mr. Author", the woman's voice says, pensively. "It's a curious name,
 but then it takes all kinds, I suppose."

>wait
 Time passes.

>listen
 "Curious or not", the man's voice replies, "I'm inclined to believe
 what he says - knowing what I do. Remember the Congress?"

>listen
 The woman laughs lightly. "How could I forget, Edward? But it is a
 sobering thought to know that you are - in the end - under the control
 of someone who never really knew you....."

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go west

 Master Bedroom
 You can't see much of the master bedroom, since it's dark; you can make
 out the vague shadows of a writing-table and a dresser (how can you be
 sure that that's what they are?), and a stately four-poster. Are there
 two people in the bed, or are you imagining things? Only light can help
 you here, I'm afraid.

 There's a small switch on the west wall.

>push switch

 As you throw the switch, the two people in the bed stir slightly, and
 sit upright.....

 They look even more familiar to you now, so familiar that you feel your
 memory will return any moment. A man of slight build, academic in
 appearance, in his late forties; a quiet- looking and intelligent woman
 of about the same age. You know them......but you're not sure how..

 "Would you mind", the man says indignantly, "explaining to us what
 you're doing here?"
 "Perhaps he's come from Mr. Author, Edward", the woman replies.

 And then you suddenly remember, with an almost painful clarity. Edward
 and Laura. Literary critics. Thermoconditioners. Their
 thirteen-year-old daughter, Simone. Familiar - of course.

 You created them......they're your characters. Characters in the
 prologue of.......The Decline and Fall......

 And suddenly, before you can even speak, the floor seems to crumble
 beneath your feet...

 Chapter Two - Errare Humanum Est

 Study
 Though you've never seen this room in your life, you can't help but
 feel a strong sense of d?ja vu about the entire place, as if you've
 either lived here once or will live here at some time in the future.

 Under the Arch
 Currently, you are standing underneath a tall and imposing arch, that
 serves as a line of demarcation between the wide hall and the more
 residential portion of the house. This small passageway leads further
 north, south back into the hall, and runs on either side to the smaller
 wings of the house.
 There are no lights burning anywhere, except a dim glow off to the

 Nursery
 Though it hardly looks like the kind of room you spent your childhood
 in, your sixth sense tags this room as a nursery. It's hard to find a
 logical reason for your flight of fancy though; there's a table, chair,
 and a small but comfortable bed, but there are no bars on the solitary
 window, and certainly few things that look like toys. Unless they're
 all inside that wardrobe or the dresser over there, that is.
 You feel a sudden sense of disquietude, as if - this is probably sick
 fancy - an old friend of yours was missing from the room.

 On the metal table is a brief letter.

>read letter
 In an old-fashioned, sloping, schoolgirl's hand, you can read the
 following:

 Dear Father and Mother,
 Something very unusual has happened - I think it's related to what you
 were telling me about the other day, but I'm not sure - but I have to
 leave for a short time, at least. Don't worry about me. As far as I
 know, I'm in safe hands. If you need to get in touch with me at any
 time, contact Mr. Author.

 Your loving daughter,
 Simone.

 Master Bedroom
 You can't see much of the master bedroom, since it's dark; you can make
 out the vague shadows of a writing-table and a dresser (how can you be
 sure that that's what they are?), and a stately four-poster. Are there
 two people in the bed, or are you imagining things? Only light can help
 you here, I'm afraid.

 There's a small switch on the west wall.

>examine bed
 A very stately piece of furniture, that would have been commonplace
 about ten centuries ago. You can make out two figures in it, but
 nothing else.

 The presumed writing table is just a dark blot in one corner of the the
 room, but it seems to have stacks of books on it.

>push switch

 As you throw the switch, the two people in the bed stir slightly, and
 sit upright.....

 They look even more familiar to you now, so familiar that you feel your
 memory will return any moment. A man of slight build, academic in
 appearance, in his late forties; a quiet- looking and intelligent woman
 of about the same age. You know them......but you're not sure how..

 "Would you mind", the man says indignantly, "explaining to us what
 you're doing here?"
 "Perhaps he's come from Mr. Author, Edward", the woman replies.

 And then you suddenly remember, with an almost painful clarity. Edward
 and Laura. Literary critics. Thermoconditioners. Their
 thirteen-year-old daughter, Simone. Familiar - of course.

 You created them......they're your characters. Characters in the
 prologue of.......The Decline and Fall......

 And suddenly, before you can even speak, the floor seems to crumble
 beneath your feet...

 Well, at least it's over. But you can't help but feel it's far, far
 worse than your previous novel; it seems poorly written and
 over-ambitious, and all the characters seem to have escaped from a
 Reader's Digest back-issue. You know that's partly intentional - you
 were trying to write a little positively, just for the heck of it - but
 it still sets your teeth on edge.

 On second thoughts, perhaps a decent burial? You're not sure.

 You strain to hear the drivers' voices.

 "Ah, yes, you're the Author. You presume to know everything", one voice
 says - an elderly voice, rebuking in tone, probably a man's. "But you
 still have to convince me."

>listen
>again
 You strain to hear the drivers' voices.

 "What convincing?" the man addressed as the Author says with a swagger.
 "Trouble with these chaps is, they can't handle reality. They create
 something, and are content to leave it at that - they don't realise the
 magnitude of the responsibility they have assumed. Creation is not
 static, as you know."

 You strain to hear the drivers' voices.

 "Reality?" The older man sounds puzzled. "I wonder what you mean by
 that, my friend. To the people I meet every day - those I preside over,
 in fact, this is reality. It's all a question of one's point of view."

>examine me
 Harold Banks, auteur manqu?.

 "Exactly what I do. The way I see it, friend, all of us are characters
 at one level or the other. We make up one level; the people we create
 make up the next level; and so on. You don't fit into that scheme, of
 course - shall we say you are above such things?"

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

 "Quite right. I was years in the making. I have changed forms, assumed
 different identities, occupied different places, both physical and in
 the minds of our citizens, based on the imaginations of all those who
 shaped me. My essence has not changed - it is only the popular
 perception of me that has."

 "There is such a thing as want of confidence.....Here, that 's enough!

 though. Not now."

 With these words, the old man - you cannot see him, still, as he shines
 a light in your eyes - unties your bonds, and gently but firmly escorts
 you out of the vehicle. You hear a faint hum of engines, and the car
 drives away. You now find yourself...

 Open Field
 A pleasant expanse of grass, limited in extent; to your east, west and
 south you see high granite walls, but a footpath leads north. The sun
 beams down upon you.

 Exactly what you'd expect from the field, the meadow looks like an

 you. A footpath leads further north, but a barbed-wire fence blocks
 your progress in other directions, except the way you came from, south.
 The shadow that the fence casts forms, strangely enough, a handsome
 border to the meadow. A single thin tree with a sign on it lies to your
 immediate north, just before the footpath.

>go north

 You move to the north, and can make out the dim outline of a tribal
 village - or something of the sort - in the distance, but before you
 can move any further, you stop dead in your tracks, halted by the
 apparition in front of you.....

            [depress SPACE......]

 It's a small tin figurine. Staring at it in profile, it looks like a
 10p coin; but from the front it is indubitably a human likeness.

 "Not yet", the apparition admonishes you. "You are not ready to enter
 the Village. You do not understand what lies ahead; and yet you once
 knew......" Its head seems to nod briefly. Its voice is the same as
 that of the older man in the car.....or are you imagining things?

            [depress SPACE......]

 "Yes, you did", it goes on, before you can reply. "Perhaps what you
 need, then, is to be shown the consequences of your actions. It is all
 too easy, in your world as in mine, to see some of the consequences
 without seeing the structure as a whole, to miss the wood for the
 trees. But that is no excuse. Follow me, then....."

 Too numbed to reply, you follow the voice to the north; as you do so,
 the village seems to disappear, and you walk down countless
 intersections, until you reach your destination......

 Chapter Four - Everything Can Change

 Cold city street, outside a house
 You find yourself standing on the street of what seems to be a fairly
 typical metropolis, with narrow alleys leading north, south and west.
 It's bitterly cold - the temperature must be fairly close to freezing
 point - and the threat of snow seems to increase with every passing
 second. The only thing that brings an ounce of comfort to the scene is
 the wall of the house you're standing outside, on which is a frosted
 window (through which a light, albeit a dim one, escapes) to your east.

>examine window
 It's a large, old-fashioned, frosted window, which time hasn't been
 very kind to. The windowsill looks dusty and neglected, and there seems
 to be no locking mechanism attached to the window itself. Behind the
 window you can make out a low light - nothing else.

>look through window
 Sorry, but it's closed.

>open window
 As you open the window you can make out the shadows cast by a fireplace
 on a wall, tracing out a sofa, a table, and a stooped figure in the
 sofa itself.

 Peering into the window, you can make out that the figure is a
 middle-aged woman; nothing more.

 Living-room, inside the house
 The room is dark, which is more a consequence of its size than of
 anything else; certainly the fireplace in the far corner is doing its
 best to illuminate its surroundings. Shadows loom around you - a table,
 an unlit chandelier, a sofa, a figure - and, in spite of the actual
 physical warmth of your surroundings, you feel a palpable chill. The
 rest of the room lies to your east, where the sofa casting the shadow
 actually lies.

>examine woman
 Peering closely at the shadow of the figure on the sofa, you can see
 that it is the figure of a tall woman.

>touch shadow
 Which do you mean, the circular shadow, the sofa's shadow, the table's
 shadow or the woman's shadow?

>woman's

 and go in fits and starts, instead of flowing on evenly.

>wake up woman

 You feel nothing unexpected.

 sitting in it is out of your sight.

>sit

>sofa
 To sit on the sofa, you'll have to move to the east.

>go east
 Hesitantly, you move to the east....

 By The Fireside
 The east end of the hall receives considerably greater illumination
 from the fireplace, with the result that the impression of obscurity
 seems to have been momentarily dispelled. Apart from the other side of
 the hall, though, there are no visible exits. Of course, there are
 doors to the north and south, but they're both boarded up, and will
 probably never be opened again.

 "Good evening, Mr. Banks", the woman says quietly. "I've been expecting
 you. Do take a seat", she says, motioning you towards the sofa.

>sit
 What do you want to sit on top of?

>woman
 That's not something you can enter.
 "Don't be afraid", she goes on. "My sole purpose in being here was to
 answer your questions - assuming you have any."

>sit on sofa
 You sit down on the sofa, next to Simone.

>ask woman about author
 "I only saw him once, on the night I had to make my escape from our
 house in Europe. He was, I should say, in his late thirties, and by no
 means lacking in confidence."

>ask woman about parents
 "Fortunately", Simone sighs, "my father didn't have to be put through
 all this - he was dead at the end of your novel. My mother, however,
 was instrumental in bringing you here, so that you might help us
 escape."
 "Perhaps you're wondering what I'm doing here, Mr. Banks, and that's a
 natural question. But I'm afraid that you might not take my answer very
 seriously."

 She laughs gently.

 "You see, Mr. Banks, what most authors don't realise is that the
 characters they create actually do take on a life of their own. I mean
 this not theoretically, but literally. We exist in a parallel
 dimension; we lead the lives that you outline for us - and I must thank
 you for doing a commendable job there. However, when a work in
 progress, a work nearing completion, is abandoned......things begin to
 change. We become.......reassigned. To new writers. We take on new
 identities - superficially, that is, for we retain the personalities
 with which we were originally created - and end up in places like this.
 Unlike many people, however, we were warned of the oncoming disaster,
 and managed to lessen the blow in time. All of our creations - those
 from your novel about the Empire, at least - have been relocated. And"
 - she laughs, ironically - "knowing what passes for writing in your
 days, Mr. Banks, you can imagine the roles we have to play.
 Fortunately, there is a solution to all this."

>ask woman about solution
 "It's a little difficult to explain, Mr. Banks, simply because I don't
 really know everything - but what it amounts to is that your presence
 here will serve to reverse the actions of those who've been taking your
 place."

>ask woman about date
 "I'm sorry, Mr. Banks", Simone says, regretfully, "but I can't help you
 with that."

>ask woman about me
 "You did excellently, Mr. Banks", Simone says appreciatively. "In an
 age when everyone was sunk in gloom, you created a world which could
 actually be enjoyed by its inhabitants. You had no reason to stop."

 Simone glances at you surreptitiously, with something of an air of
 wonder.

>ask woman about old mAN

>ask woman about old xyzzy
 "I'm sorry, Mr. Banks", Simone says, regretfully, "but I can't help you
 with that."

 "You seem a little uncertain as to how to proceed", Simone says,
 calmly. "Never mind that - you'll find out in good time.

>ask woman about xyzzy
 "I'm sorry, Mr. Banks", Simone says, regretfully, "but I can't help you

>ask woman about manuscript
 "I really find it hard to understand why you destroyed it, Mr. Banks.
 Of course, you didn't know what you were doing then."

>ask woman about book
 "I really find it hard to understand why you destroyed it, Mr. Banks.
 Of course, you didn't know what you were doing then."

>tell her about book
 "No matter what your opinion of it, Mr. Banks", Simone replies, "you
 shouldn't have done that. In a way...."

 She pauses.

 "You see - this takes some explaining, but I'm glad you brought it up.
 As long as at least one author continues to develop his stories, his
 characters in a particular style, that particular - how shall I put it
 - strain continues to exist in this dimension, and - under suitable
 circumstances - influences the others, including your world. By
 finishing your novel, Mr. Banks, you could have tipped the scales in
 our favour."

 "Strange as this world seems, it is real, Mr. Banks", Simone replies.
 "We do have a parallel world of our own - one that fluctuates and
 changes according to the whims of the authors in your dimension, where
 only those social structures that prove to be stable actually survive."
 She smiles. "That's something to be proud of. And the very fact that
 you're here proves that we can actually interact with your dimension,
 and even change it."

>tell her about world
 Simone listens attentively while you tell her some of the plot points
 of your future works. "They sound excellent, Mr. Banks, just like your
 last book."

>tell her about me
 I don't think Simone, patient as she is, really wants to hear your life
 story.

>tell her about her
 Simone listens to you, but does not reply.

>kiss her
 Whether or not she resembles Galatea, you're no Pygmalion.

>attack her
 A cowardly and unprovoked act.

>ask her about her
 "I'm sorry, Mr. Banks", Simone says, regretfully, "but I can't help you
 with that."

 "Enough time has passed, Mr. Banks", Simone says, getting up from the
 sofa. "It is time for you to move on." She hands you a small black
 object, which on examination turns out to be a fountain-pen.

 "This may sound ridiculous", she goes on, smiling, "but you may find
 this pen far, far more useful than you can ever imagine. I am not sure
 what is in store for you - I know some of the details, but I can't
 explain them to you now. Whatever dangers may await you, I am quite
 sure that you'll succeed."

 The whole room seems to dissolve, and you can just make out two more
 words: "Good luck" - before the voice that was speaking to you all the
 time is replaced by silence.....You find yourself floating, not in
 space, but in a liquid of some sort.....

 Laboratory
 The sights inside the tower are nothing less than breath-taking. They
 remind you in some eerie manner of an alchemist's laboratory, with
 glass tubes and bulbs, filled with liquids of every conceivable colour,
 arrayed along the four walls. In one corner of the room, a huge brass
 pot is boiling, and emits multicoloured fumes; in another lies a crude
 stone table. There seems to be no way to reach the lower levels of the
 tower, and the only exit is to the west.

 On the crude stone table is a small glass bottle.

 say was about the letters. Sorry if I pinched dear Margot's letters

 THE JOURNAL OF A SOUR KRAUT

 January 11th.
 Another miserable day. My physician - who comes from a hundred years in
 the future - has prescribed some vile physic, by the name of Paxil, to
 raise my spirits. Its efficacy, to say the least, is nil. Seriously
 considering trip to France - it's such a romantic spot to commit
 suicide in.

 January 16th.
 My dear daughter, for mysterious reasons, insists on following me to
 France. Why should she? I don't need her help to kill myself - I'm not
 yet that senile. Well, I must indulge her. She's never really forgiven
 me for breaking it off between her and that nihilistic Russian
 musician......

 January 25th.
 Arrived in France. A fine day, though my dear Konnie has already
 started drawing all the gentlemen's looks. Bother.

 January 26th.
 Am besides myself with fury. My suicide plan went kaputt thanks to an
 officious little priest from England. I tell you, it's things like this
 that drive us to World War. Besides, he (the priest, not Herr Hitler)
 is now mooning round my whelp in the most sheepish fashion. I could
 tell him it wasn't worth it, but he wouldn't listen.

 January 27th. (Evening.)
 Was spared having a son-in-law older than myself; my daughter finally
 fell for some longhair, anti-establishment artist. In eighty years,
 that fellow's descendants will be playing at Woodstock. Am strongly
 considering disposing of my execrable physician and taking up the
 proposal of Dreamscapes Incorporated. They promise 'historical

 and lead. It is contraindicated in mercury and other metal poisoning
 and in inorganic intoxication, e.g. phosphorus. Side-effects are minor
 and include nausea, heartburn and mild anaemia with prolonged use. Do

 Chapter Six - The Sad Caf?

 Antechamber, in the Aviators Saloon
 From the discreet signs declaring that you are currently in the
 Aviators' Saloon, and from the general look of the furniture, this is
 obviously the reception room or antechamber of a small hotel. The doors
 of the hotel, to your north, seem to be closed, east is a dining-hall,
 and a staircase leads up. The check-in counter stands in front of you.

 You still remember the saloon from the day it was created. By you, of
 course. The jolly old receptionist, the reunion of scientist Janus
 Mbelwe with his wife Vanessa. It doesn't look the same now.

 An amiable, elderly man is standing behind the counter.

 The receptionist stares at you in amazement. "A customer? Thought I'd
 seen the last of 'em a long time ago. Welcome, son, to the Aviators
 Saloon."

 [Your score has just gone up by eight points.]

>score
 You have so far scored 114 out of a possible 360, in 343 turns, earning
 you the rank of Deserving Writer.

>examine man
 The old man looks like a receptionist of some sort, but somehow his
 expression suggests that he once held a higher position.

 Yes, it is the same man. Why does he look worried? Why is this place
 empty?

 Looking around at the room, then at you, the receptionist sighs. "This
 used to be -- well, I won't say it was the Mazina Hotel in Europe, but
 it certainly had a lot more life in it. But ever since that old story
 began, no one steps in here anymore."

>ask man about story
 "The old legend? Well, it's one way to while away time, young man. You
 see, we're a fairly - how d'you put it - rational kind of society.
 Sensible. Not superstitious. That's why, I guess, we were all so scared
 when it happened."

 He pauses, and clears his throat a tad dramatically.

 "Five years ago, son", he goes on, "- actually four and nine, but who's
 counting? - this place used to be fairly bursting with life. Not that
 it was one of those old-fashioned bawdy houses or burlesques or
 whatchamacallits - it was a nice, cosy kind of hotel, with all kinds of
 people. We used to have refugees from the Kingdoms, travellers from the
 airports, even the Director of Social Sciences and his.. - heck, that's
 how the whole story started. Janus Mbelwe - everyone used to call him
 by his first name, self included - was one of our finest scientists;
 social scientists, that is. Between him and a few of his friends, he'd
 defused a very tricky political crisis, two years ago, relying on sheer
 scientific method. All this at thirty."

 He sighs.

 "Well, he had been here two years before that; at 'round the same time,
 I guess, there was a young lady staying here. I forgot what she did - I
 gather she was a psychologist of some sort. Anyway, she and the
 Director hit it off just fine - a few of us old fogies thought
 something might come of it, but old Jan - he was myopic if there ever
 was one. Couldn't see a thing - science excluded - even when it stared
 him in the eyes. Anyway, they met again - I can't swear that it was
 coincidence - the next year, and, to use the language of the novelists,
 they just about made a match of it. There was work to be done -
 political stuff - so they decided to wait for about a year or so. The
 next year arrived, and Vanessa Clarke - that was her name - came along
 at just the usual time. Jan arrived two days later, and they were all
 set to tie the knot, if you know what I mean. On the night before they
 left for the Registry for the official ceremony, old Jan was just a
 trifle tardy, and Miss Clarke was growing impatient. I decided to go
 and ask the kid to hurry up - they'd already waited so long, y'know -
 so I went up to his room, opened the door, and there he was.
 Or rather wasn't.
 Janus Mbelwe had vanished into thin air."

 "Well, I won't insult your intelligence by telling you that Miss Clarke
 was - uh - rather broken up over the whole thing; no one ever heard of
 her to this day, and all our searches for Jan - we even had the whole
 police force scouring the globe at one stage - came to naught. Ever
 since then, son - until you, that is - no man or woman has crossed the
 threshold of this saloon. That's the whole story." The receptionist
 closes his eyes, remembering.

 "I haven't even looked through the rooms since then - they stay clean
 automatically - but if you want to stay here, there are 'bout ten rooms
 upstairs. You're welcome to any of 'em."

>go up
 "Decided to take a look anyhow? Well, good luck to you, son", the
 receptionist calls out. "If you like a room, stay there - if you find -
 um - anything - let me know...." His voice fades as you move away."

 Chambers, in the Aviators Saloon
 The landing of the Aviators Saloon opens into four rooms, one
 corresponding to each point of the compass, the doors to which (being
 of the electrical kind) are open. The stairs lead back down, and
 continue further upwards.

 And the four rooms housed the four scientists that had returned from
 the Provinces. Correction. Used to. Fairbank, Reed, Royal....who was

 Portable AutoLock Users' Manual

 1. Technical Specifications:
 AutoLock Portable Furniture uses 1024-bit technology, S3 scale
 miniaturization, and voice modulation. Two models exist: the DSX - 275
 and the DSX - 550.

 2. The DSX - 275 and 550:
 The DSX - 275, a simple and lighter model, is a low-syntax machine,
 with zero linguistic comprehension, and easy replaceability. The DSX -
 550, though far more complex, uses S2.5 scale miniature circuits. It
 understands over twenty English phrases, and can also serve as a
 timepiece.

 3. Locking and Unlocking:
 Locking and unlocking are dependent on a numerical code whose length is
 dependent on the user, though it must lie between three and seven
 self-explanatory. The DSX - 550 recognizes additional formats.

 4. Changing the Code:
 The code can only be changed with another code number, and requires
 technical assistance. This feature is not recommended for beginners.

 Below this, someone has scrawled......

 Room 4, in the Aviators Saloon
 Room 4, which was obviously meant to accomodate a couple or a small

 own.

 Covering the bed, with a primness that is almost Victorian, is a warm
 quilt of knitted wool.

 You've absolutely no sartorial sense, but it does look like a patchwork

 Chronicles of Global History

 2187
 Little is known about the world of 2187 A.D., which has given rise to
 much intriguing, though profitless, speculation. The few records that
 we do possess show little signs of the dramatic collapse that was to
 come a mere eighty years later, and - if the truth must be told - there
 were signs of a stability that was long awaited following the events of
 the preceding two centuries. Scientifically and technologically, of
 course, there was nothing but progress; and - for the first time in a
 century and a half - it seemed as if social change, that old sluggard,
 was making an effort to keep up with the advances of mere learning.

 LAWYER'S DISAPPEARANCE - UPDATE
 26th November, 2804

 Even the most complete investigations by European and Colonial police
 forces have failed to reveal the least trace of Colonial legal
 consultant Cassandra Anderson, who was last seen driving away from the
 chambers of the Regional Court of Offences at 9 p.m., about three weeks
 ago. In a statement issued to all major news services, Officer Schultz
 of the European Police Force categorically ruled out a deep political
 plot as the cause of the abduction. "We live in peaceful times
 nowadays, and even the most obdurate reactionaries have learnt the
 danger of rocking the boat", he said. "This is probably an isolated
 act, with no major backing." He added that he was sanguine about being
 able to retrieve Mrs. Anderson safely.

 the dining hall of your own large family. Since - in this age -
 everything is automatic, there is precious little clutter, barring a
 large table, twelve chairs, and a large cupboard at the back of the
 room.

>examine cupboard
 A large, ancient oak cupboard, which is precariously closed.


>open cupboard
 You open the oak cupboard, revealing some plates and spoons.

>examine spoon
 Nothing interesting here, just piles of spoons, plates and other items
 of cutlery.

 Antechamber, in the Aviators Saloon
 From the discreet signs declaring that you are currently in the
 Aviators' Saloon, and from the general look of the furniture, this is
 obviously the reception room or antechamber of a small hotel. The doors
 of the hotel, to your north, seem to be closed, east is a dining-hall,
 and a staircase leads up. The check-in counter stands in front of you.

 An amiable, elderly man is standing behind the counter.

>ask man about room seven
 "Can't help you with that, son. Too bad," he says, sympathetically.

>ask man about room 7

>ask man about key
 "It's the key to Miss Clarke's room. Go see what y'can find there,
 son."

>take key
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask man about Clarke
 "Nice young lady - almost like my own daughter, son, believe me or not;
 though she's (my daughter, I mean) not here any longer, she's a
 physician out in the East. She was just right for a chap like Jan,
 whose head was in the clouds about nine-tenths of the time. The pity of
 it."

>ask man about Jan
 "Ah, he was a fine chap, Mr. Mbelwe. The kind of person that any
 author'd be proud of putting in his books - that kind of person. There
 must be some reason for his disappearance, but it's a black mystery to
 me."

>ask man about computer
 "Ah, that old one - it's badly dated but I haven't the heart to chuck
 it out. Just put a news disc in it, and switch it on - if you've got
 one, that is."

>ask man about quilt
 "Can't help you with that, son. Too bad," he says, sympathetically.

>ask man about chip
 "Can't help you with that, son. Too bad," he says, sympathetically.

>ask man about crumpled note
 "Can't help you with that, son. Too bad," he says, sympathetically.

>ask man about simone
 The receptionist shakes his head. "I never really studied ancient
 philosophies, son", he replies.

>ask man about saloon
 "Nice place, isn't it? However, since that damned legend started, five
 years ago, the place's been kinda empty."

>ask man about legend
 "Sorry, son, I told you just 'bout all I know. There might be a clue
 hidden in yonder rooms upstairs - that's a romantic notion - but after
 five police investigations I doubt there's anything left to be found."

>examine counter
 A large wooden counter or desk, emitting a low, fluorescent glow. It's
 not a solid block, so there's a space underneath it, which is darker
 than the rest.

 And why do you get the feeling that there's something under it that you
 didn't put there in your manuscript?

>look under counter
 You look under the counter for a while, and pull out a scrap of paper.

>examine scrap of paper
 A small scrap of paper, torn at one edge, with words printed on one
 side.

>examine paper
 A small scrap of paper, torn at one edge, with words printed on one
 side.

>read it
 Fran?ois, Ch. 2, Lines 1-17:

 "Why did you suppress the first thirty-three verses?", the Author
 complained.

 "It's almost painfully obvious if you'll only apply your mind to it",
 the Voice replied, unflappably. "The first lines deal with what he has
 already lived through; to restate them would be unnecessary. Besides,
 he has already acquitted himself most honourably."

 "Not enough", the Author replied, sternly. "All he has done is to
 travel through our lands, our landscapes - call them what you will. But
 has he done anything?"

 "Well, he did open the gate", the Voice retorted.

 "After following prompts that could not bamboozle a two-year-old. The
 challenges we set him were -- elementary."

 "Well, we shall have to see. Can he bring back life into this
 place?........"
 [Here the printing stops, abruptly.]


>ask man about paper
 "Can't help you with that, son. Too bad," he says, sympathetically.

>show paper to man

 Chambers, in the Aviators Saloon

 Room 4, in the Aviators Saloon
 Room 4, which was obviously meant to accomodate a couple or a small
 family at least, is a pleasant contrast to the house you came across
 earlier in your wanderings. Even the furniture - double-bed, dresser,
 table and armchair, and the window - have a particular flavour of their
 own.

 The window is open, flooding the room with sunlight.

 Covering the bed, with a primness that is almost Victorian, is a warm
 quilt of knitted wool, which shows an unsightly bulge at one point.

 You can also see a toybox (in which is a crumpled note) here.

 An amiable, elderly man is standing behind the counter.

>show crumpled note to man
 You fail to capture the receptionist's interest.

>ask man about table
 "Used to be fashionable nowadays - old Jan's is still here, but heaven
 knows how to open it. You need two goddamned code numbers, one to open
 it, the other to lock it - and then it opens up on its own - at least
 it's meant to. It doesn't even understand proper English, son - you
 have to say something stupid like 'table, code red' or 'table, code is
 9801' to get it to work. Sloppy programming, I call it", the
 receptionist muses.

>examine quilt
 You've absolutely no sartorial sense, but it does look like a patchwork
 quilt, obviously woollen.

>take quilt
 You lift the quilt and search the bed for some time, your conscience
 pricking you all the time, but are rewarded for your efforts by a
 letter.

>look under quilt
 Uneasily conscious that you're making a mess, you shove the quilt
 around some more.

>again
 Uneasily conscious that you're making a mess, you shove the quilt
 around some more.

>examine letter
 Written on stiff notepaper not bearing any specific letterhead, it
 would probably be a love-letter if its contents weren't so startling.

>read letter
 A quick glance at the letter reveals that its contents are of a rather
 personal nature, and your sense of delicacy tells you not to read it.
 Do you still want to do so?

>yes

 Feeling rather a cad, you read the letter once through, quickly....

 Europe, July 14th, 2883.

 Dear Vanessa,
 Unforseen circumstances have forced me, without any sensible or
 honourable alternative, to leave you abruptly, without warning, without
 even the consolation - pardon my grandiosity - of a fond farewell. I
 have not been permitted to reveal more than this, even to you whom I
 could trust above anyone else, dearest - for the hand and mind that
 drive me at this moment are not my own. Rest assured that, if you still
 - regardless of your own safety - want to follow me, I have left enough
 traces. Not too explicitly, of course - Nash is a fine old man, but I
 wouldn't want to involve him in this - but I am sure you will find a
 way. The key can be revealed in the usual way: table, place. There is
 little time to say more. Four digits alone.

 Yours,
 Janus.

 After reading it, you feel strangely vindicated. At least, it was of
 some use, and could help you find a key to this enigma.

 Receptionist's room, in the Aviators Saloon
 This room - which, by its lived-in, familial appearance must belong to

 Vanessa Clarke's room, in the Aviators Saloon
 If there's anything concealed in Miss Clarke's room, it cannot be under
 a bed, since this room is without one. A wardrobe and a glass-topped
 table - charming in their simplicity - are the only adornments visible.
 There are no windows, surprisingly, except one covered by curtains,
 which is in the wrong position as far as illumination is concerned.

 A closed wardrobe stands impassively in a corner.

 On the glass-topped table is a glazed vase (in which are some dead
 flowers).

 In the glazed vase are some dead flowers.

 Who needs them? They're not even pressed. And, for some obscure reason,

>smash vase

>push vase off table

>examine vase
 A simple, glazed, ceramic vase. On one side, fairly low - strangely -
 is a small hole about the circumference of your little finger. A few
 wilting flowers are still inside it. On the other side is an
 inscription:
 "Triumph shall come here at last,
 We should ask not 'how', but 'when' -
 From a stone take then a sword,
 In this vase, place now a......."

>stick pen in hole
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put pen in hole
 You have an uncanny feeling that you'll need the pen for something
 better than that.

>put pen in vase
 As you insert the pen into the vase, a blinding light dazzles you, and
 a low haze envelops you. You struggle to find your way out of it, but
 to no avail.

 Your car has gone. But did you take it home, or did you walk? The last

 Outside your house
 Though you've been here time and time again, there is something
 comfortable and inviting about this small walk up to your house, where
 you have lived for the last twelve years. The trees move gently in the

 The sight that greets you is nothing more than shocking. All your

 face down....but, even more chillingly, though the room is empty, there
 are splashes of blood on the wall.
 What on earth has happened here?
 Trembling, you return to the corridor.

 The voice rushes into your ears again.

 "This is only the beginning, Harold. Without you, without the
 continuity you were about to provide, this world is about to undergo
 autolysis - self-destruction if you prefer. It is not a pleasant
 process."

 "Until now, you have followed the tracks we set you, followed the
 side-lanes that we planted signposts along......but now it is less
 simple. With your memories, with the one item that you were able to
 save from the deluge, Cassandra will have to - almost - begin all over
 again. All this as a result of your rash act."

 Somehow, you lack the will to protest. Maybe because you're immobile,
 maybe because you never were much good at arguing anyway, but you
 don't.

 "I can assure you, once again, Harold", the voice goes on, "that it is
 not pleasant."

 Master bedroom, in your house
 With a sigh of relief, you walk into your bedroom and look around,
 quickly. Everything seems to be normal - at a glance.
 The lighting in this room is much better than in the rest of the house,
 so that it's a welcome contrast to the dimly lit corridors. Somehow
 this room has never seemed as welcoming to you as it does now - the

 Just your average wardrobe. This one is meant exclusively for clothes,

 in here sometimes.

 You open the wardrobe in search of a change of clothing, and something
 falls out. Not a coat hanger, not even your dressing-gown.

 It's a corpse, and judging by all appearances, it hasn't been one very

 You stagger backwards, then take a few steps forward. The wardrobe has

 A second glance serves to dispel your unwarranted fears. Though the
 man's body does eerily resemble your husband, you're quite sure it
 isn't him. The man must have been nearing forty, and is greying at the
 temples. The cause of his death, as far as you can see, is a deep stab
 wound on the left side of his chest.

 THE CHARLESTOWN TIMES    -    July 28th, 1883

 ---- STUNNING EXPOS? BURIES CHARLESTOWN POLITICIANS ---
 From Our Special Correspondent
 The corrupt, brutal and unnatural orphanage of Charlestown has, through
 the miraculous intervention of Mr. Joel Sweeney, television
 personality, been all but routed. Although the sickening practices of
 the local politicians were known to many, few apart from the valiant
 Mr. Sweeney were willing to confront them face to face. "I do not give
 a cosmic egg", he told our reporter, "if the children in our
 institutions are well-treated; such yardsticks belong to the Middle
 Ages. Any system of education and development that does not liberate
 the inner self, and offer a holistic approach to spiritual development,
 is a monstrosity and a perversion." On the evidence of Mr. Sweeney,
 over 650 children - half of them orphans - were rescued from these dens
 of skepticism and placed along the right path. His close associate and
 friend, Doctor Osborne Sharma (the author of "Ingest, Assimilate,
 Absorb" and "Ageless Mind Over Ageing Matter") is actively involved in
 the process of rehabilitation.

 ANNOUNCEMENTS

 DECEASED : on July 26th, 1883, at his residence, LEON. E. GOLD,
 schoolmaster. Mr. Gold was recently under a shadow following the
 scandal in education. He is survived by his wife Judith.
 APPOINTED : as Superintendent of Education and Human Potential, ALBERT
 ROMANOV. Mr. Romanov, for years, was a tireless campaigner of Mr.
 Sweeney's causes, and his appointment comes as no surprise.

 Harold, Ch. 3, Lines 1 - 10

 "This is not what I had in mind", the Creator said, irritably. "This is
 not it at all."

 "Silence!", said the Voice, not sternly, as was its wont. "You have
 already seen the consequences of your own actions, and I hope you
 realize how totally senseless they were....."

 "No need to rub it in", the Creator replied, calmly. "But why should
 someone else pay the price?"

 "For simple proof, Harold. Proof that, even in the face of a threat,
 that someone else - who originated, after all, in your own mind - would
 be able to withstand it. If someone else stands in your place, she
 stands there so that you may prove yourself."

 "Tortuous reasoning", the Creator replied, "but you're starting to make
 sense. When, then......"

 Workhouse, in Charlestown
 From its attitude of desolation, from its decrepit appearance, you
 realize that this cannot be anything other than that despised
 institution, the workhouse. Strangely, no cries, no disturbing sounds,
 can be heard though you strain your ears, and though the place is
 deserted and disused, there are no signs of outright squalor. The
 furniture is of surprisingly good quality, though probably second-hand,
 and there is nothing creaky about the floor-boards as you tread on
 them. The passage you came through leads north, and another corridor
 seems to leads east.

 Merging with the floor is a closed wooden door, probably leading to a
 cellar, an eerie light gleaming at its edges.

 The passage to the east is blocked by a black door.

 Europe, July 14th, 2883.

 Dear Vanessa,
 Unforseen circumstances have forced me, without any sensible or
 honourable alternative, to leave you abruptly, without warning, without
 even the consolation - pardon my grandiosity - of a fond farewell. I
 have not been permitted to reveal more than this, even to you whom I
 could trust above anyone else, dearest - for the hand and mind that
 drive me at this moment are not my own. Rest assured that, if you still
 - regardless of your own safety - want to follow me, I have left enough
 traces. Not too explicitly, of course - Nash is a fine old man, but I
 wouldn't want to involve him in this - but I am sure you will find a
 way. The key can be revealed in the usual way: table, place. There is
 little time to say more. Four digits alone.

 Yours,
 Janus.

 Bizarre, indeed.

 It's unlike any flower you've ever seen before; it has a single whorl
 of four pink petals, with irregular angles that hardly look natural, as
 if they represented some strange form of origami.

 You are in a large, spacious, white-tiled passageway, illuminated

 further east almost endlessly, and seems not to have any side-passages.

 Workhouse, in Charlestown
 From its attitude of desolation, from its decrepit appearance, you
 realize that this cannot be anything other than that despised
 institution, the workhouse. Strangely, no cries, no disturbing sounds,
 can be heard though you strain your ears, and though the place is
 deserted and disused, there are no signs of outright squalor. The
 furniture is of surprisingly good quality, though probably second-hand,
 and there is nothing creaky about the floor-boards as you tread on
 them. The passage you came through leads north, and another corridor
 seems to leads east.

 The cellar door, under your feet, is open and leads into an illuminated
 passage.

 The passage to the east is blocked by a black door.

 THE CHARLESTOWN TIMES    -    July 28th, 1883

 ---- STUNNING EXPOS? BURIES CHARLESTOWN POLITICIANS ---
 From Our Special Correspondent
 The corrupt, brutal and unnatural orphanage of Charlestown has, through
 the miraculous intervention of Mr. Joel Sweeney, television
 personality, been all but routed. Although the sickening practices of
 the local politicians were known to many, few apart from the valiant
 Mr. Sweeney were willing to confront them face to face. "I do not give
 a cosmic egg", he told our reporter, "if the children in our
 institutions are well-treated; such yardsticks belong to the Middle
 Ages. Any system of education and development that does not liberate
 the inner self, and offer a holistic approach to spiritual development,
 is a monstrosity and a perversion." On the evidence of Mr. Sweeney,
 over 650 children - half of them orphans - were rescued from these dens
 of skepticism and placed along the right path. His close associate and
 friend, Doctor Osborne Sharma (the author of "Ingest, Assimilate,
 Absorb" and "Ageless Mind Over Ageing Matter") is actively involved in
 the process of rehabilitation.

 ANNOUNCEMENTS

 DECEASED : on July 26th, 1883, at his residence, LEON. E. GOLD,
 schoolmaster. Mr. Gold was recently under a shadow following the
 scandal in education. He is survived by his wife Judith.
 APPOINTED : as Superintendent of Education and Human Potential, ALBERT
 ROMANOV. Mr. Romanov, for years, was a tireless campaigner of Mr.
 Sweeney's causes, and his appointment comes as no surprise.

 Harold, Ch. 3, Lines 1 - 10

 "This is not what I had in mind", the Creator said, irritably. "This is
 not it at all."

 "Silence!", said the Voice, not sternly, as was its wont. "You have
 already seen the consequences of your own actions, and I hope you
 realize how totally senseless they were....."

 "No need to rub it in", the Creator replied, calmly. "But why should
 someone else pay the price?"

 "For simple proof, Harold. Proof that, even in the face of a threat,
 that someone else - who originated, after all, in your own mind - would
 be able to withstand it. If someone else stands in your place, she
 stands there so that you may prove yourself."

 "Tortuous reasoning", the Creator replied, "but you're starting to make
 sense. When, then......"

 Kitchen, in the underground
 This small room, with its pantry-cupboard and blackened fireplace,
 probably once served as a kitchen to the inmates of this unfortunate

 No, wait - she's not dead - but certainly dying....

 The woman looks up at you, hesitantly...."Have you.... did you receive

 A dull, dingy, dirty place, with absolutely no redeeming feature save a
 hundred years' dust and neglect. All the 29th Century aesthete in you
 revolts against it. Even assuming that you can conquer those

 in.

 A voice transmitter, as sooty as the rest of the shack, lies neglected.

 Workhouse, in Charlestown
 From its attitude of desolation, from its decrepit appearance, you
 realize that this cannot be anything other than that despised
 institution, the workhouse. Strangely, no cries, no disturbing sounds,
 can be heard though you strain your ears, and though the place is
 deserted and disused, there are no signs of outright squalor. The
 furniture is of surprisingly good quality, though probably second-hand,
 and there is nothing creaky about the floor-boards as you tread on
 them. The passage you came through leads north, and another corridor
 seems to leads east.

 The cellar door, under your feet, is open and leads into an illuminated
 passage.

 The passage to the east is blocked by a black door.

 Sweeney's Lair
 You are inside a massive room, whose walls are covered by endless rows

 you can do to try and observe what is around you.
 Your attention is immediately drawn to the man at the far corner of the
 room....

 A large box - as large as a coffin, but otherwise not unlike a mailbox
 - is pushed to one corner of the room.

 At the far end of the room, under the glare of the lights, is a steel
 armchair.

 Sitting in the armchair, a handsome man glares at you, angrily.

 "Welcome, beggar", he says, looking at your attire with a sniff. "I
 am.....Joel Sweeney. At your service."

 Legal Form 67 is what any witness in a case involving the International

 "This is not what I had in mind", the Creator said, irritably. "This is
 not it at all."

 "Silence!", said the Voice, not sternly, as was its wont. "You have
 already seen the consequences of your own actions, and I hope you
 realize how totally senseless they were....."

 "No need to rub it in", the Creator replied, calmly. "But why should
 someone else pay the price?"

 "For simple proof, Harold. Proof that, even in the face of a threat,
 that someone else - who originated, after all, in your own mind - would
 be able to withstand it. If someone else stands in your place, she
 stands there so that you may prove yourself."

 "Tortuous reasoning", the Creator replied, "but you're starting to make
 sense. When, then......"
 [Here the printing is abruptly cut short.]

 "Prepare to say farewell to your life, darling Cassandra."

>put knife in slit

 As Sweeney marches towards you, a voice rings out in the room.

 "Sweeney, I have not lost yet. You're the king of cowards, attacking a
 poor, defenceless player character in that uncouth manner. You killed
 Non-Interactive Fiction. Prepare to die, indeed. Hmph. Do it yourself."

 Sweeney cringes, falls to the ground, not moving a muscle. The coffin
 shatters........and a man steps out, walking towards you.

 "Thank you, Mrs. Anderson. I knew we could rely on you. Allow me to
 introduce myself - Janus Mbelwe, social scientist. I think you have
 something you wanted to give me......"

 Silently, you hand him the letter and he begins to read it....As he
 does so, the walls change, the odour changes......and you are no longer
 in the workhouse, but......

 Chapter Nine - Birth Of A Notion

 In a hospital corridor
 You stand in a hospital corridor, looking around, confused. A sense of
 urgency seems to drive you on, but you cannot understand why.

 [Your score has just gone up by fourteen points.]

>score
 You have so far scored 223 out of a possible 360, in 794 turns, earning

 You look at yourself uncertainly, but you're still the same - Cassandra
 Anderson, lawyer, on her way home from the Court of Appeals.


 In a hospital corridor
 A broad corridor, smelling clean and fresh, in a very modern hospital,
 leading north into an intersection.

>go north

 Intersection, in the hospital
 This is obviously a pivotal point in the hospital's geography, with
 passages leading in all four cardinal directions. A map on the wall
 offers some, but not much, promise of guidance, and there seems to be
 no one behind the hospital desk, though there is a sign on it. Above
 you, perched high on one wall, is a loudspeaker.

 On the desk is a triangular metal sign, precariously balanced.

 You can hear a clear voice issuing forth from the loudspeaker. "Mrs.
 Anderson. Please proceed immediately to Ward Number Ten. Mrs. Cassandra
 Anderson. Please proceed to Ward Number Ten."

>examine map
 It's a floor plan of the hospital, in faint lines, looking almost as if
 it were hand-drawn. Your position, near the desk, is indicated by a
 small cross. The rest of the map is as follows:

 This is a small chamber that forms part of Ward 10, which continues to

 The only other exit is back to your east.

 Standing near you, with one eye on the doorway, is a medical student,
 who was obviously asked to keep an eye on newcomers.

 yourself, most great physicians do look rather unassuming. He's wearing
 a white coat and a stethoscope, and can't be much older than twenty.

 There is a splutter and a crackle, and the speaker goes dead.

 Corridor, in the hospital
 This broad corridor is flanked by rooms to your east and west, labelled
 "Ward 1" and "Ward 3" respectively; it runs further north to its end,
 and south back to the reception desk.

>go south

 Intersection, in the hospital
 This is obviously a pivotal point in the hospital's geography, with
 passages leading in all four cardinal directions. A map on the wall
 offers some, but not much, promise of guidance, and there seems to be
 no one behind the hospital desk, though there is a sign on it. Above
 you, perched high on one wall, is a loudspeaker.

 The sign on the desk has fallen over to one side.

 You can also see a discharge sheet here.

 Records Room, in the hospital
 This small, stuffy, but not musty annexe lying west of the reception
 area houses the hospital's records, or at least the plaque on the door
 says so. Much to your surprise, there are no computers, and no ledgers
 either, on the solitary table, large as it is. There are no exits
 except the one back east.

 A pile of records sits on the table, neglected.

>examine pile
 It's a stack of medical records, written out at the time of admission
 of the various patients concerned on green sheets of paper. You could
 read a few of them if you wanted to.

 As you flip through the pages, a single sheet of paper, distinct from

 The Final Chapter
 "And so, after this, we come to the end of our story", the Voice
 replied. "It will be difficult, but I think we should be able to pull
 through."

 "You could have sent me, couldn't you?", the Creator grumbled.

 "Well, my young friend", the Voice admonished him, "you needed to be
 taught a lesson. It's strange to see that you actually feel sympathetic
 towards a person you once blithely wiped out...."

 "I didn't!", the Creator replied, angrily. "You would have. Now, with
 our intervention, you will not. And at least I have given her a
 pleasant interlude now....."

 "It's what comes after that which worries me....."

 "At least you cannot accuse me of not having a sense of humour", the

 1. Visitors to Wards 1,3,4 and 5 (General Surgery) are not allowed
 outside the allotted hours of 9 - 1 p.m and 3 - 6 p.m. They must be
 attired in aseptic outfits for patient safety, and require proof of
 identification.
 2. Visitors to Wards 2,6,7,8 and 9 (Internal Medicine) require proof of
 identification, but do not require any special attire.
 3. Visitors to Ward 10 (Maternity) should wear a disposable scrub suit
 (over their ordinary clothing) consisting of a cap, mask and gown,
 before entering the operating or recovery rooms.


 That's seldom useful.

 Slightly dated, but you've always had a soft corner for this one ever
 since the Eugenics Repeal Act went through - with your assistance - on
 the day you bought it.

 Not unlike any other ward you've seen in construction, Ward Two is
 equally empty. Where is everybody?

 Lying just at your feet is a small platinum key.

 overpowering, arc lights.

 Lying thrown across one of the hospital beds is a long green gown of
 the disposable variety.

 You stride purposefully towards the other end of the recovery room....

 At the other end is a single bed - and a small chamber, not exactly an
 incubator, but perhaps a heat chamber of sorts, which contains a very
 young girl, who is sleeping peacefully. Lying on the bed is a woman of
 about thirty or so, who looks at you gratefully.

 "Good evening, Mrs. Anderson - Cassandra - I knew you would come. I
 apologize for making you come all this way here" - she waves lightly -
 "as my own home would have been a more convenient place; but plot comes
 before all". She laughs, then looks at the heat chamber. "And, if you
 haven't yet been introduced, this is my daughter. A few hours old, but
 much calmer than any of us."

 "Absolutely", you reply, drily.

 "Well, let me come to the point. There is one more task to be
 completed, but I do not know anything about it myself. Mr. Author, I
 fear, is very discreet. All I have been instructed to do, Cassandra, is
 to give you this."

 She hands you a small object, which you stuff into a pocket without
 even examining.

 "Good luck, Cassie", she says. The little girl waves behind the glass -
 at you? - and once again the whole room dissolves...........

 The monster, if he weren't so hideous, would be positively comic. For
 all his threats he is dressed in an elegant style, and looks positively
 foppish. You're not sure what kind of monster he is - perhaps a troll.

 The monster lunges at you. "Me need weapon", it grumbles.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kill monster with pen

 As you attack the troll with all your might, using your trusty pen, it
 dissolves into a whiff of green smoke. "NOOOOOO!" it screams. "UNFAIR!
 FOUL! OFFSIDE! UNSPORTING! TROLLS KILLED ONLY WITH SWORD!"

 As you shake your head in wonder, you can see something descend from
 the sky.

 Yes, it's the family jet. The door opens, and a familiar face pops out
 - Gerald. He walks quickly up to you, and takes you by the hand.

 "Welcome back, Cassie", he says, joyously, as your two children,
 looking at you and the troll, can barely conceal their admiration.
 "We're going home."

 "You defeated him", you say, amazed.

 "No, you did. Your character. You did, Harold. You have destroyed the
 menace that was threatening our dimension. This is your victory, not
 mine.", the Author replied. The Voice - appearing in the now familiar
 guise of a man whose profile resembled a coin - agreed, as mildly as it
 could.

 "You mean...........", you say, still unable to take it in. "You mean
 I've.......But I never did...."

 "Yes, you did not destroy your manuscript. You will go on to complete
 it - but we needed you, here, to understand what was at stake - and to
 save our dimension. And each time a new menace arises, your creatures -
 your gifts to this world - shall rise up, time and time again, and
 guarantee us success. But you must leave us now."

 The palace in the clouds dissolves around you.

 "Good luck, Harold."

 You'll never really know how it all started.

 That's not surprising, because you're not even sure what happened in
 the first place. If it had been anything else, you would have dismissed
 it as ninety-nine per cent bad digestion and one percent fancy, much as
 Ebenezer Scrooge would have. Somehow, in this case, that explanation
 doesn't really grab you. Did it really mean anything? Or was it, as the
 physiologists would say, just a matter of a few neurons in your
 brainstem working overtime?

 But life is strange. It's almost impossible to predict - as Heisenberg
 pointed out - where exactly you might end up, even when you start in as
 mundane a place as your own home....

 Your Bedroom
 This is hardly the place for an adventure to begin. You know the
 furniture of this room - desk, chair, bed and bookcase - almost as well
 as the contents of your pockets.

 On the wooden desk is a dusty manuscript.

 Small Hut
 You are inside a small, cramped, dingy and dark thatched hut. You can
 see nothing but an exit to the west, slightly illuminated, but you can
 hear voices - faintly - ringing in your ears. The only exit is out to
 the west.

>go west

 Battlefield
 This vast open space, stained a lurid red that reminds you of poorly
 made lipstick, fringed by trees on all sides, seems to close in on you.
 No escape is possible.

 What you see amidst the trees almost chokes you with revulsion. The
 ugliest monster you could ever think of - dressed in a zoot suit. Ugh!

 As the monster spots you, it laughs loudly and uproariously. "That all
 they send? End of road for little lady! HA HA HA!"

>kill monster with pen

 As you attack the troll with all your might, using your trusty pen, it
 dissolves into a whiff of green smoke. "NOOOOOO!" it screams. "UNFAIR!
 FOUL! OFFSIDE! UNSPORTING! TROLLS KILLED ONLY WITH SWORD!"

 As you shake your head in wonder, you can see something descend from
 the sky.

 Yes, it's the family jet. The door opens, and a familiar face pops out
 - Gerald. He walks quickly up to you, and takes you by the hand.

 "Welcome back, Cassie", he says, joyously, as your two children,
 looking at you and the troll, can barely conceal their admiration.
 "We're going home."

 "You defeated him", you say, amazed.

 "No, you did. Your character. You did, Harold. You have destroyed the
 menace that was threatening our dimension. This is your victory, not
 mine.", the Author replied. The Voice - appearing in the now familiar
 guise of a man whose profile resembled a coin - agreed, as mildly as it
 could.

 "You mean...........", you say, still unable to take it in. "You mean
 I've.......But I never did...."

 "Yes, you did not destroy your manuscript. You will go on to complete
 it - but we needed you, here, to understand what was at stake - and to
 save our dimension. And each time a new menace arises, your creatures -
 your gifts to this world - shall rise up, time and time again, and
 guarantee us success. But you must leave us now."

 The palace in the clouds dissolves around you.

 "Good luck, Harold."

 Your Bedroom
 You wake up. Nothing has changed. It's the same room, the same bed, the
 same tired old manuscript, the same surreal dream fading from the edges
 of your mind.........

 No, something has changed. Forty-six copies be damned. Sales figures,
 faugh. After all, which author can claim to have saved an entire
 parallel dimension?
