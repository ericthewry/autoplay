 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.


 Adventurer's Consumer Guide
 You are a product tester for the Adventurer's Consumer Guide, a
 magazine that reviews all sorts of equipment an adventurer might need
 for his adventures. Your magazine is highly respected because of the
 thorough tests you put the equipment through. The tests aren't just
 done at the magazine's offices. No, the product testers go on actual
 adventures to test the equipment out in the field. Sometimes you kill
 an evil overlord; sometimes you rescue a fair maiden. Most of the time,
 like today, you just go out looking for a treasure in Treasure Cave
 Mountain, a perfect place for adventures as it contains plenty of
 caves, treasures, monsters and traps.

 As you are putting on the soon-to-be-tested magical coat, magical ring
 and magical helmet, your editor says, "On this mission you'll be having
 a helper with you."
 "Really?" you say. You usually work alone.
 "Yeah, but it's part of a test. See, there's this new agency that is
 renting out sidekicks. We are going to write a review about it. Oh,
 here he is now."
 Into your office walks a goblin: a green humanoid creature with pointy
 ears, about a meter tall. "Hi, you must be my new boss," he says to
 you.
 "I guess I am. What is it you're supposed to do, exactly?"
 "Well, I'm very brave and helpful, plus I'm a ferocious killing
 machine. If you see any kind of monster, or anything at all, and you
 want it killed, just tell me, and it's toast."
 "Okay... well, I think we should get going."

 You and your new companion are off to Treasure Cave Mountain. Your
 mission is to return with one really big treasure. Any really big
 treasure.

 If you are unfamiliar with interactive fiction, type HELP.
 If you care, type CREDITS.
 In this game you can't examine things. Instead use either "look" to see
 descriptions of the things in the room you are in, or "inventory" to
 see descriptions of what you are carrying. You also can't use "look
 But you can use "read".
 To see your inventory without the long descriptions of all you are
 carrying, type: "inventory short". Or simply: "i s". Or simply: "is".
 No time passes when you use "look" or "inventory".
 You communicate by "talk to [whatever]", or by giving commands in this
 format: "goblin, give me the cow-o-meter".
 It is possible to put this game in an unwinnable state, but you should
 be able to figure out when this has happened.
 Should you wish to re-read the above information during the game, type

 On a mountain ledge
 A narrow mountain ledge leading west (where you came from) and east. To
 the north is a tall mountain wall and to the south a long drop.
 Very far to the east, near the end of the ledge, a huge monster is
 crouching. Its green skin is scaly, its body is bloated like a balloon,
 its four feet have long terrible claws, its wide mouth has thousands of
 sharp teeth and on top of its head is a cluster of about fifty bulging
 eyes as big as your head.

 A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end. Its
 manufacturers say the staff will remove any creature that comes in
 contact with the orb. Inside the orb you can see a small unmoving
 cluster of turquoise tentacles.
 A Remmingheim Supreme crossbow, loaded with an arrow. The Supreme model
 is supposed to have a special feature. When you shoot it, the arrow
 will magically return, and the crossbow will be loaded again. The hard,
 razor-sharp arrow is protruding a good ten centimeters from the front
 of the crossbow.

 back it contains information about every single monster in the world,
 and how to defend yourself against them. It is suspiciously thin.
 A small cage. It is closed and locked with a code-lock (You know the
 code.). A gremlin, a small green humanoid creature with pointy ears, is
 trapped inside. He is wearing a tiny ring. He is smoking a tiny
 cigarette. His thin arms are sticking through the bars of the cage, and
 he is fiddling with the code-lock, trying one combination at a time.

 You are wearing:
 A Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of Invisibility, though at the moment it
 looks like an ordinary, long, brown, coat. It is supposed to turn
 invisible (or turn visible again) whenever you say the magic word
 "tango".
 A Super Champion Helmet fastened with a strap under your chin. It is
 round and made of thin metal. It is supposed to magically turn you into
 a hero.
 On your finger is a Snuffelburg & Co. Type F Magical Ring. It is red

 moving the effect of the ray away from you and onto the gremlin, which
 is wearing a smaller, magically connected, ring.
 A pair of red boxer shorts, decorated with tiny teddy-bears dressed as
 sailors. They are not something you are supposed to test; they are your
 own.

 arms and pulls you back. You hit the tentacle with your free arm and it
 lets go.

 A tentacle grabs hold of one of the eyes of the green monster and
 begins to pull. The eye is pulled away from the eye cluster, but is
 still attached with what appears to be a pink rubbery string. The
 string gets stretched pretty far, and for a moment it seems as if it is
 going to break. Then the tentacle lets go and the eye snaps back into
 the cluster. The eyes wobble like jelly. Then they blink, and the green
 monster looks a bit confused.

 The green monster's tongue shoots out and wraps itself around your
 waist. You are pulled into the monster's mouth and chewed to little
 pieces.

 In that game you scored 1 out of a possible 100, in 54 turns. You get

 thousands of sharp teeth and on top of its head is a cluster of about
 fifty bulging eyes as big as your head.

 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something

 towards you. You quickly roll to the side, and the goblin lands in the
 hay. You two get up.

 Vast cave
 This cave has an exit leading outside to the southwest. In the middle
 of the ceiling, high above you, is a round hole. On the floor, directly
 under the hole, is a pile of hay.
 A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a
 thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through.
 A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave
 floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you
 recognize the pyramid as one of the safest and least complicated
 models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly.
 This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is
 far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave.

 Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's
 Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you
 are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake
 the lever.

 You can see the goblin sidekick and a cage here.

 The sword goes even crazier and starts thrashing like a headless
 chicken on drugs.

 The sword makes the lever shake. There comes a low humming sound from
 the teleporter.

 The end of a narrow mountain ledge leading west. The tall mountain wall
 has three caves: to the northwest, north and northeast.

 The goblin comes running after you.

>go north
 Spacious cave
 This cave has an exit leading outside to the south, or you can go
 further into the mountain to the north.
 A burly barbarian is leaning against a wall, his arms crossed over his
 naked chest, a grim expression on his face. A long sabre is in his
 belt.
 A tough-looking dwarf, wearing chain mail and a helmet, is sitting on
 the floor. He is holding an axe almost as big as himself. He is smoking
 a pipe.
 A muscular white horse and a mangy donkey stand here.

 The goblin comes running after you.

>go north
 Gigantic cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is
 also an exit to the south.
 A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the
 cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and
 buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
 merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
 horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
 is written on the automat next to the buttons.
 A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy,
 bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of
 fish bones.

 The goblin comes running after you.

 You put the sluggish fish on the altar.

 The first depicts a large man punching a small man. The second a large
 man pushing a small man. The third a large man giving a small man a
 wedgie. There are many more with similar motifs. You have seen runes
 like this before. They mean that this is an altar of Snurgelfjekk, the
 cat-headed god of bullies. At the center of the altar is a larger, more
 detailed rune. It depicts the altar and two people. One of the people
 is playing a saxophone. The other is putting something on the altar;
 you can't quite make out what it is supposed to be. Lines are coming
 out in all directions from the altar, perhaps representing light or
 heat.

 A bottle of the dreaded Dante Tomato Sauce, Triple-Extra Spicy.
 Something is written on it. It is closed.
 A Huxoflux & Son healing gun. You tested one of these four years ago,
 and they are excellent. Just shoot anything that is wounded or sick.
 A nosehairscrew, a small intricate mechanism with many arms, spikes and
 pinchers. Part of the Guggensmith Portable Torturing Set that you
 refused to test some months ago. You are supposed to stuff it up
 someone's nose, and then twist it to cause horrendous pain.
 A Remmingheim Supreme crossbow, loaded with an arrow. The Supreme model
 is supposed to have a special feature. When you shoot it, the arrow
 will magically return, and the crossbow will be loaded again. The hard,
 razor-sharp arrow is protruding a good ten centimeters from the front
 of the crossbow.
 "The Ultimate Creature Manual" by Arthur Hippoman. According to the
 back it contains information about every single monster in the world,
 and how to defend yourself against them. It is suspiciously thin.
 A Super Champion Helmet. It is round and made of thin metal. It was
 supposed to magically turn you into a hero.

 You are wearing:
 A pair of mirrorshades. You could see yourself in them if you weren't

 On your finger is a Snuffelburg & Co. Type F Magical Ring. It is red

 moving the effect of the ray away from you and onto the gremlin. That
 is, if the gremlin is still wearing the smaller, magically connected,
 ring.
 A pair of red boxer shorts, decorated with tiny teddy-bears dressed as

 Prodigious and very hot cave
 An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the east.
 It is terribly hot here. The intolerable temperature is almost
 certainly caused by the red-hot stone oven standing in a corner.
 A stone table stands in the middle of the cave. Round it stands a stone
 throne with an old troll, a stone chair with a tall troll, a stone
 stool with a short troll, and a large stone. The trolls look a bit like
 humans made of stone, though with no necks, bigger jaws, smaller eyes
 and huge arms and hands. They are playing some kind of card game.
 A golem, a man crudely made from stone, is standing here unmoving. Some
 runes have been chiseled into his chest.

 Tremendous Cave
 An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the
 south.
 Some runes are written on the wall.
 A genie floats about a meter above the ground. He looks like a man made
 of ice. He is bald, but has a beard of icicles. He has no legs; his
 stomach rises from a small cloud of icy steam. He holds an ice sabre.
 A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He
 is fat, purple and has two very thick legs.
 A young angry-looking woman stands holding a large placard saying "Save
 the monsters!" She is clearly one of those monster rights activists
 that have been making your job so much harder lately.
 The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green
 humanoid creature with pointy ears. He is wearing a tiny ring and is
 smoking a tiny cigarette.
 A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is closed.
 A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very
 complex. Actually it is very easy to use. You know this because on a
 previous product-testing mission you came across a machine just like it
 and spend four hours trying to figure out how it worked. The machine is
 for sharpening tools and weapons. Just put what you want sharpened into
 it and wait.

 You can see a big tacky holy grail here.

 The goblin comes running after you.

 The woman notices you and smiles. "Hello there," she says.
 The genie nods at you.
 The hippoman says, "Welcome to my humble cave."
 "I know him," says the gremlin. "He had me trapped in a cage. He is one
 of them adventurers. He goes around killing monsters."
 "What?!" shouts the woman.
 "Yeah," says the gremlin "And he once said he thought genies were a
 bunch of overrated powerless second-class ghosts."
 "Did he now?" says the genie.
 The gremlin turns to the hippoman and says, "He also told me hippomen
 stink and that you were a tub of lard!"
 The hippoman snorts angrily. He, the woman and the genie approach you.
 The hippoman punches you in the stomach saying "You disgusting human!"
 The woman hits you in the head with her placard shouting, "Go away, you
 monster molester!" The genie lifts you up by the neck with one icy
 hand, and throws you down on the floor. The three go away from you
 muttering angrily. The gremlin giggles as you get up.

 Rocks start falling from the ceiling. A couple of small ones hit you.
 "My head! My beautiful head!" the hippoman cries as a rock hits him.
 The goblin runs around in circles in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid
 the rocks. The genie looks pretty annoyed as a big rock bounces off his
 head. "Oh, won't somebody protect my beautiful head," the hippoman
 cries as another rock hits him. The woman holds the placard over her,
 and some rocks bounce off it. The gremlin dodges a rock by quickly
 crawling horizontally along the wall.

 The hippoman sighs. "If only there existed some sort of device that
 could prevent rocks from falling on my head all the time," he says.

 around. It is the gremlin. He is stabbing his cigarette into his own
 hand. He is clearly in pain. He removes the cigarette from his hand,
 and the pain in your hand disappears. He puts the cigarette back in his
 mouth and laughs at you.

 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the west. There is

 A table made from human skulls stands near the northeast exit. On the
 table stands a shimmering pink translucent cube and a small, rusty,
 holy grail.
 A small round stage stands close to the table. It is apparently made
 from human faces frozen in terrible screams.
 A small flamingo-headed man sits behind the table in a
 comfortable-looking armchair covered in obviously fake giraffe fur. He
 is wearing a jester's suit, including a ridiculous hat with bells on.
 He is staring at the pink cube.

 crossbow. "If you were going to hide my stuff, you should at least have
 had the brains to close the garbage can," she says, before shooting you
 through the eye. You fall down the hole. You are dead before you hit

>go north
 Gigantic cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is
 also an exit to the south.
 A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the
 cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and
 buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
 merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
 horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
 is written on the automat next to the buttons.
 A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy,
 bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of
 fish bones.

 On the altar you can see:
 A sluggish fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils. It is crawling
 around.

 The goblin comes running after you.

>go north
 Huge cave
 This cave has exits to the north, east, south and west.
 A stone pedestal as tall as you stands in a corner. A knife is planted
 in it, hilt up.

 A diamond the size of your chest lies in the middle of the cave. A
 tremendous light shines out from it and fills the entire cave.

 The goblin comes running after you.

>go east
 Bumper cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the west. There is
 another exit to the northeast. Someone has chiseled gaps into the cave
 wall, forming a primitive ladder leading up to a hole in the ceiling.
 A table made from human skulls stands near the northeast exit. On the
 table stands a shimmering pink translucent cube and a small, rusty,
 holy grail.
 A small round stage stands close to the table. It is apparently made
 from human faces frozen in terrible screams.
 A small flamingo-headed man sits behind the table in a
 comfortable-looking armchair covered in obviously fake giraffe fur. He
 is wearing a jester's suit, including a ridiculous hat with bells on.
 He is staring at the pink cube.
 An armadillo-headed woman in a white toga sits next to him on a
 barstool made from green shimmering flames. She is reading a thick
 brown book called "Practical Tests of Existentialism".
 A cat-headed man sits next to her on a throne draped in black leather,
 with numerous spikes sticking out of it. He is tall, fat and dressed in
 a black leather jacket, black jeans and black leather boots.

 The goblin comes running after you.

 There is a flickering image inside the cube. The flamingo-headed man
 giggles and says, "Some guy in Russia just stepped on a beehive."

>go up
 Titanic cave
 This cave has a hole in the floor. On the south wall is a small round
 metal hatch. It is closed.
 In the middle of the room stands a stone pedestal, on which is attached
 A HUGE IMPORTANT WARNING SIGN! On top of the pedestal stands a metal
 chest. It is closed.

 The goblin comes climbing up from the hole.

>open chest
 There are five gold coins in the chest. You quickly grab them before
 running towards the ladder. You hear something behind you. With one
 foot on the ladder you turn your head. It's the hatch; it has opened,
 revealing a female goblin peeking through. She is holding your Supreme
 crossbow. It is aimed right at you. She fires. Almost instantly, before
 it has even left the crossbow completely, the arrow returns to the bow.
 "What?" says the goblin lady. She fires again. The arrow returns again.
 Startled the lady fires again and again. She begins to swear. You laugh
 and climb down.

 An armadillo-headed woman in a white toga sits next to him on a

 book called "Schrodinger's Goldfish: Confirmation of Negative Time".
 A cat-headed man sits next to her on a throne draped in black leather,
 with numerous spikes sticking out of it. He is tall, fat and dressed in
 a black leather jacket, black jeans and black leather boots.

 The goblin comes climbing down the ladder.

 There is a flickering image inside the cube. The flamingo-headed man
 giggles and says, "Some guy in Scotland just slid on a banana peel."

>go west
 Prodigious and very hot cave
 An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the east.
 It is terribly hot here. The intolerable temperature is almost
 certainly caused by the red-hot stone oven standing in a corner.
 A stone table stands in the middle of the cave. Round it stands a stone
 throne with an old troll, a stone chair with a tall troll, a stone
 stool with a short troll, and a large stone. The trolls look a bit like
 humans made of stone, though with no necks, bigger jaws, smaller eyes
 and huge arms and hands. They are playing some kind of card game.
 A golem, a man crudely made from stone, is standing here unmoving. Some
 runes have been chiseled into his chest.

 You can see a stone saxophone here.

 Huge cave
 This cave has exits to the north, east, south and west.
 A stone pedestal as tall as you stands in a corner. A knife is planted

 A diamond the size of your chest lies in the middle of the cave. A
 tremendous light shines out from it and fills the entire cave.

>go south
 Gigantic cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is
 also an exit to the south.
 A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the
 cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and
 buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
 merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
 horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
 is written on the automat next to the buttons.
 A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy,
 bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of
 fish bones.

 On the altar you can see:
 A sluggish fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils. It is crawling
 around.

>go south
 Spacious cave
 This cave has an exit leading outside to the south, or you can go

 A burly barbarian is leaning against a wall, his arms crossed over his
 naked chest, a grim expression on his face. A long sabre is in his
 belt.
 A tough-looking dwarf, wearing chain mail and a helmet, is sitting on
 the floor. He is holding an axe almost as big as himself. He is smoking
 a pipe.
 A muscular white horse and a mangy donkey stand here.

>go northwest
 Big cave
 This cave has an exit southeast to the outside, or you could go further

 A somewhat larger than life-size statue of his holiness One-Hand Jack
 stands in the middle of the cave. Jack used to be an infamous pirate,
 but later formed Hoverism, a peaceful religion. The statue holds its
 left arm out and up, the hook at the end of it just low enough to be
 reached.
 An old Hoverist is hovering about a meter above the floor. He is
 sitting in the lotus position, his head is turned towards the statue,
 and his eyes are closed. He is wearing a white loincloth.

 Though you cannot see it, you know that a Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of
 Invisibility hangs on the hook. It is supposed to turn visible (or turn
 invisible again) whenever you say the magic word "tango".

 The goblin comes running after you.

>go northwest
 Large cave
 This cave has exits to the northwest and southeast.
 A huge black safe stands here, closed. Due to the unevenness of the
 cave floor, there is a gap between the safe and the floor, big enough
 for somebody to crawl down into.
 A shoal of small fish crawls around on the floor. They look creepy.
 Their skins are white and look almost transparent. Their eyes are also
 white and don't have pupils.

 The goblin comes running after you.

>enter gap
 A tight room
 This is a tight tiny room formed between the safe and the uneven floor.
 You can barely move. Unfortunately the safe seems to be just as solid
 on the underside. The only way out is up.

 The goblin crawls in with you. Your bodies are pushed together. "This
 is uncomfortable," the goblin mutters.

>touch goblin with staff
 The goblin sidekick vanishes.

 There is a most horrible sound like two carriages filled with drum sets
 crashing at full speed, whilst a million cows pull a million feet up
 from a swamp. There is a terrible feeling of being thrown. And there is
 pain. Lots and lots of pain. You lie still, waiting for the pain to
 subside. It doesn't.

 Wearily you open your eyes. Turquoise. That's all you can see. It takes
 a moment before you realize that something covers your eyes. Slowly you
 lift your arm (pain, pain, pain) and wipe your face (pain, pain, pain).
 It is turquoise sludge that covers your face. And your arm. And, you
 notice, the rest of your body. You are lying in a pool of the stuff.
 Looking around a bit you notice you have been thrown into another cave.
 You open your mouth and spit out some sludge. It is very silent. In
 fact you cannot hear a sound. Wait a moment. You twist your head to the
 side (pain, pain, pain) and sludge pours out of your ear. You can hear
 a dripping sound coming from the southeast.

 "Note to self," you think. "Do not transport a very large monster into
 a very small space, when simultaneously occupying that space."

 You start trying to get up (PAIN, PAIN, PAIN). You stop trying to get
 up. You have noticed a piece of metal sticking out of your shoulder.
 You carefully pull it out. After a moment it dawns on you; this is a
 piece of the safe. Looking closer at your body you see quite a lot of
 other pieces of the safe sticking out from it. Enough to build a new
 small safe from, you estimate. Carefully you begin to pick out the
 pieces, one by one, and throw them away.

 You get up. You clean off the worst of the sludge. You start longing
 for a long hot bath. And a chiropractor appointment. You look around.

 Enormous cave
 The only exit from this cave is to the southeast.
 Some runes are written on the wall.
 Several fragments from the safe are lying here. Quite a bit of
 turquoise sludge is on the floor; most of it around the southeast exit.

 A pair of mirrorshades lies here. You would have been able to see
 yourself in them, except they are covered in turquoise sludge.

 Big and small pieces of the safe are spread all around this room. The
 safe door has embedded itself halfway into the cave wall. There are
 quite a lot of pieces of porcelain spread around too. Lots and lots of
 dead fish lie around, many with bits of the safe sticking out of them.
 There is some disgusting turquoise sludge covering almost everything in
 the room, including the ceiling. Now and then globs of it fall to the
 floor.

 A bottle of the dreaded Dante Tomato Sauce, Triple-Extra Spicy stands
 here. Something is written on it. It is covered in turquoise sludge. It
 is closed.

 "The Ultimate Creature Manual" by Arthur Hippoman is here. According to
 the back it contains information about every single monster in the
 world, and how to defend yourself against them. It is suspiciously
 thin.

 Some sludge drip from the ceiling.

 A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end lies here.
 It has lots of turquoise sludge on it. Its manufacturers say the staff
 will remove any creature that comes in contact with the orb. Inside the
 orb you can see the goblin sidekick. He is now tiny and unmoving.

 "What happened here?" you say.
 "There was a large noise," says the Hoverist. "Then things came from
 the northeast. Your staff almost killed me, but I hovered out of the
 way, and it destroyed the head of my statue. My cave was filled with
 sludge."
 "Sorry about that."
 "When you reach the thirty-third stage of Hoverism you will realize
 there is no need for large indoor explosions."

 A tough-looking dwarf, wearing chain mail and a helmet, is sitting on
 the floor. He is holding an axe almost as big as himself. He is smoking
 a pipe.
 A muscular white horse and a mangy donkey stand here.

>talk to barbarian
 "What are you doing?" you ask.
 "Grirgr and the dwarf were sent to look for treasures. But Grirgr not
 stupid! He thinks, why risk our lives? So we wait here until somebody
 else finds treasure! Then we buy it!"

>talk to dwarf

 donkey. It looks surprised. The barbarian says: "Look, the wound on the
 side of the donkey, the one it got from that giant slug, it is gone."

>sell healing gun to barbarian
 "That's not a proper treasure!"

>shoot barbarian with healing gun
 You pull the trigger. A white ray shoots out of the gun and hits the
 barbarian. "Huh?" he says. He looks down at himself. "Grirgr's scars!
 They are gone! Darnit, they made Grirgr look really cool!"

 On a mountain ledge
 The end of a narrow mountain ledge leading west. The tall mountain wall
 has three caves: to the northwest, north and northeast.

>go northeast
 Vast cave
 This cave has an exit leading outside to the southwest. In the middle
 of the ceiling, high above you, is a round hole. On the floor, directly
 under the hole, is a pile of hay.
 A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a
 thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through.
 A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave
 floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you
 recognize the pyramid as one of the safest and least complicated
 models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly.
 This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is
 far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave.

 You can hear a low humming coming from the teleporter.

 Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's
 Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you
 are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake
 the lever.

 You can see a cage here.

 The sword goes even crazier and starts thrashing like a headless
 chicken on drugs.

 The sword makes the lever shake. The sound from the teleporter gets
 louder.

>get on teleporter

 The sword makes the lever shake. The sound gets even louder. A few
 electrical sparks shoots up from the teleporter. Your feet tickle.

>wait

 The sword makes the lever shake. The teleporter starts shaking and
 smoking. The cave begins to fade out around you, and another cave fades
 in.

 Voluminous cave
 This cave has an exit to the east. In the middle of the floor is a
 round hole.
 A huge dead monster lies here, its four feet in the air. It has a
 stupid-looking face on a round gray hairless body. Its tiny eyes stare
 at nothing. The upper half of a dead pointy-eared elf is sticking out
 of its mouth. It looks like the monster choked on the elf. The elf is
 wearing a backpack.

 You look down at yourself. You seem unsubstantial, like a ghost. Slowly
 you begin to take on a more solid form. Now you look normal.

 the Gloov might also try to suck your blood, which would be bad,

 A burly barbarian is leaning against a wall, his arms crossed over his
 naked chest, a grim expression on his face. A long sabre is in his
 belt.
 A tough-looking dwarf, wearing chain mail and a helmet, is sitting on
 the floor. He is holding an axe almost as big as himself. He is smoking

>go north
 Gigantic cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is
 also an exit to the south.
 A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the
 cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and
 buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
 merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
 horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
 is written on the automat next to the buttons.
 A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy,
 bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of
 fish bones.

 On the altar you can see:
 A sluggish fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils. It is crawling
 around.

>go north

 tremendous light shines out from it and fills the entire cave.

>go north
 Tremendous Cave
 An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the
 south.
 Some runes are written on the wall.
 A genie floats about a meter above the ground. He looks like a man made
 of ice. He is bald, but has a beard of icicles. He has no legs; his
 stomach rises from a small cloud of icy steam. He holds an ice sabre.
 A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He
 is fat, purple and has two very thick legs. He is wearing your helmet.
 A young angry-looking woman stands holding a large placard saying "Save
 the monsters!" She is clearly one of those monster rights activists
 that have been making your job so much harder lately.
 The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green
 humanoid creature with pointy ears. He is wearing a tiny ring and is
 smoking a tiny cigarette.
 A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is closed.
 A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very
 complex. Actually it is very easy to use. You know this because on a
 previous product-testing mission you came across a machine just like it
 and spend four hours trying to figure out how it worked. The machine is
 for sharpening tools and weapons. Just put what you want sharpened into
 it and wait.

 You can see a big tacky holy grail here.

 A somewhat larger than life-size statue of his holiness One-Hand Jack

 but later formed Hoverism, a peaceful religion. The statue holds its
 left arm out and up, the hook at the end of it just low enough to be

 An old Hoverist is hovering about a meter above the floor. He is
 sitting in the lotus position, his head is turned towards the statue,

 Several fragments from the safe are lying here. Quite a lot of
 turquoise sludge is on the floor; most of it round the northwest exit.

 safe door has embedded itself halfway into the cave wall. There are

 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is
 also an exit to the south.
 A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the
 cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and
 buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
 merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
 horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
 is written on the automat next to the buttons.
 A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy,
 bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of
 fish bones.

 On the altar you can see:
 A sluggish fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils. It is crawling
 around.

 A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end. Its

 He is now tiny and unmoving.
 A fat fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils.
 A bottle of the dreaded Dante Tomato Sauce, Triple-Extra Spicy.
 Something is written on it. It is open.
 A Huxoflux & Son healing gun. You tested one of these four years ago,
 and they are excellent. Just shoot anything that is wounded or sick.
 A nosehairscrew, a small intricate mechanism with many arms, spikes and
 pinchers. Part of the Guggensmith Portable Torturing Set that you
 refused to test some months ago. You are supposed to stuff it up
 someone's nose, and then twist it to cause horrendous pain.
 "The Ultimate Creature Manual" by Arthur Hippoman. According to the
 back it contains information about every single monster in the world,
 and how to defend yourself against them. It is suspiciously thin.

 You are wearing:
 A pair of mirrorshades. You could see yourself in them if you weren't
 wearing them.
 On your finger is a Snuffelburg & Co. Type F Magical Ring. It is red
 and golden. It is supposed to protect you from any magical rays, by
 moving the effect of the ray away from you and onto the gremlin. That
 is, if the gremlin is still wearing the smaller, magically connected,
 ring.
 A pair of red boxer shorts, decorated with tiny teddy-bears dressed as
 sailors. They are not something you are supposed to test; they are your
 own.

 A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He

 A young angry-looking woman stands holding a large placard saying "Save
 the braineating parasite worm!" She is clearly one of those monster
 rights activists that have been making your job so much harder lately.
 The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green
 humanoid creature with pointy ears. He is wearing a tiny ring and is
 smoking a tiny cigarette.
 A carrot with tiny wings flies around. Its arms and legs look like
 those of a human, only much smaller. It has no head or face. A steady
 shower of shimmering sparks falls from all over its body; each spark
 disappears before hitting the ground.
 A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is open and empty.
 A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very
 complex. Actually it is very easy to use. You know this because on a
 previous product-testing mission you came across a machine just like it
 and spend four hours trying to figure out how it worked. The machine is
 for sharpening tools and weapons. Just put what you want sharpened into
 it and wait.

 You can see a big tacky holy grail here.

 hand. He is clearly in pain. He removes the cigarette from his hand,
 and the pain in your hand disappears. He puts the cigarette back in his
 mouth and laughs at you.

 The machine beeps. Suddenly the gremlin jumps down from the wall and
 into the machine. There come some strange sounds from the machine
 before the gremlin crawls back out and climbs up the wall. The machine

 holy grail.
 A small round stage stands close to the table. It is apparently made
 from human faces frozen in terrible screams.
 A small flamingo-headed man sits behind the table in a

 A cat-headed man sits next to her on a throne draped in black leather,
 with numerous spikes sticking out of it. He is tall, fat and dressed in

 A stone table stands in the middle of the cave. Round it stands a stone
 throne with an old troll, a stone chair with a tall troll, a stone
 stool with a short troll, and a large stone. The trolls look a bit like
 humans made of stone, though with no necks, bigger jaws, smaller eyes
 and huge arms and hands. They are playing some kind of card game.

 Prodigious and very hot cave
 An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the east.
 It is terribly hot here. The intolerable temperature is almost
 certainly caused by the red-hot stone oven standing in a corner.
 A stone table stands in the middle of the cave. Round it stands a stone
 throne with an old troll, a stone chair with a tall troll, a stone
 stool with a short troll, and a large stone. The trolls look a bit like
 humans made of stone, though with no necks, bigger jaws, smaller eyes
 and huge arms and hands. They are playing some kind of card game.
 A golem, a man crudely made from stone, is standing here unmoving. Some
 runes have been chiseled into his chest.

 A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end lies here.
 Its manufacturers say the staff will remove any creature that comes in
 contact with the orb. Inside the orb you can see the goblin sidekick.
 He is now tiny and unmoving.

 You notice that the fat fish is inside the orb now, tiny and unmoving.

 The goblin says, "Gee boss, I am kind of confused about what just

 Gigantic cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is
 also an exit to the south.
 A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the
 cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and
 buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
 merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
 horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
 is written on the automat next to the buttons.
 A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy,
 bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of
 fish bones.

 On the altar you can see:
 A sluggish fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils. It is crawling
 around. It is covered in tomato sauce.

 The goblin comes running after you.

 Suddenly you hear a terrible scream from the north:

 suddenly crumbles to dust.

 Bumper cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the west. There is
 another exit to the northeast. Someone has chiseled gaps into the cave
 wall, forming a primitive ladder leading up to a hole in the ceiling.
 A table made from human skulls stands near the northeast exit. On the
 table stands a shimmering pink translucent cube and a small, rusty,
 holy grail.
 A small round stage stands close to the table. It is apparently made
 from human faces frozen in terrible screams.
 A small flamingo-headed man sits behind the table in a
 comfortable-looking armchair covered in obviously fake giraffe fur. He
 is wearing a jester's suit, including a ridiculous hat with bells on.
 He is staring at the pink cube.
 An armadillo-headed woman in a white toga sits next to him on a
 barstool made from green shimmering flames. She is reading a
 heavy-looking green book called "Strategies in Controlling the
 Subconscious".
 A big pile of smoking ashes lies next to her.

 The goblin comes running after you.

 "Where on earth can the cat-headed man have gone?" you think.

>talk to comedy
 "What is the weird stage for?" you ask.
 "It's mine. It's my altar. Where my followers stand when they worship

 Suddenly you are somewhere else.

 Ballroom
 You are standing close to the center of a wonderful huge ballroom.
 There are exits in all directions, and there is an open window in the
 ceiling.
 The biggest, gaudiest chandelier you have ever seen lights the room.
 A birthday cake, which is taller than you, stands in a corner.
 A banner hangs from wall to wall.
 The fat queen of Norway stands near you. She looks rather bewildered.
 The princess of Finland is close by. She is holding a glass box with a
 small tag attached to it. Inside the box is a blue and pink bird.
 A large silver cage stands right next to you. It has quite wide gaps
 between the bars, but not wide enough for a person to go through. A
 large tag is hanging from it. Inside the cage is a bat, which is larger
 than you.
 Some guards stand in a circle around you. They are all holding
 crossbows.
 A huge crowd is spread around the room. It consists of royalty,
 ambassadors and ministers, all dressed up in their finest clothes and
 many of them holding presents. They all look rather shocked.
 The prime minister of Norway is being chased around the room by the
 hamster.

 A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end lies here.
 Its manufacturers say the staff will remove any creature that comes in
 contact with the orb. Inside the orb you can see the fat king of
 Norway. He is now tiny and unmoving.

 A huge wooden crate stands here. Stamps have been attached to it, and

>hit bat with staff

 The fat king of Norway appears inside the large cage.

 You notice that the bat is inside the orb now, tiny and unmoving.

 A man in the crowd screams "Det er revolusjonen!" Panic breaks out
 among the crowd, people shout and run away in all directions. The
 princess screams and escapes through the west exit. In her haste she
 drops the glass box, which shatters. The bird flies up and sits in the
 chandelier. The guards aim their crossbows at you.

>hit me with staff
 Suddenly you are somewhere else.

 You are standing in the middle of a small dirty cell. The only light
 comes from a small window with bars. A wooden bench is attached to a
 wall. A couple of rats are scampering around. In front of you stand two
 guards. The first is holding a crossbow aimed at you. The other is
 holding your staff. Inside the orb you can see a rat, tiny and
 unmoving.
 "Vi skj?nte nok ?ssen staven din virka!" says the first guard. "S? n?

 "Ja!" says the other. "Du m? bli her ei hel uke! Ha-ha-ha!"
 They leave through a massive iron door. It slams shut, and you can hear
 the sound of it being locked.

 The bat says, "Hey, great going buddy! Now jump up on my back, and
 let's blow this joint!"
 You climb onto the bat's back, holding onto his fur. The bat takes off,
 up towards the window. An arrow swishes past your head.
 "Ah, drat!" says the bat and flies behind the chandelier.
 Many arrows hit the chandelier. You look down. The guards have moved
 into the center of the room, right below the window, and they are
 shooting at you. The arrows keep hitting the chandelier, wich shakes.
 This apparently spooks the bird, and it takes off. For a moment it
 looks as if it is going to fly out the window, but then it starts
 flying in circles just below it.
 The bat says, "We can't make it to the window, we'll be shot to death.
 We need to get rid of them guards!"

>hit bird with staff

 The fat queen of Norway appears in the air, and immediately falls down
 right on top of the guards. They all go "Ompf!"

 The bat laughs and flies out the window.
 "Where to, buddy?" he asks.
 "You know where Treasure Cave Mountain is?"
 "Sure do, kid! Hang on!" the bat flaps his wings, and speeds up a lot.
 You really do have to hang on.

 The trip takes a day and a night. On the way you get caught up in a
 hurricane, attacked by a flock of ducks, and hit by lightning. The
 lightning causes you to drop the staff, and it falls into a lake. After
 that the trip is eventless. Finally you can see Treasure Cave Mountain.
 You must have been gone several weeks, it is covered in snow!

 The bat flies down and hovers next to the ledge on the north side of
 the mountain. You jump off.
 "Anything else I can do for you buddy?" asks the bat.
 "Well, there's this locked door..."
 "Say no more, say no more." The bat grabs the door with his massive
 claws, flaps his wings and flies backwards. There is a terrible sound
 as the door is torn from its hinges. The bat drops the door; it
 disappears far below.
 "Hey, thanks a lot!" you say.
 "Yeah, thanks to you too! And good luck!" The bat waves a claw, and
 flies away.
 You hear some moaning from the southwest.

 Over-sized cave (on the east ledge)
 This cave is almost identical to the previous, with an abyss, a west
 ledge and an east ledge.
 An exit, reachable from the west ledge, leads southwest. Another exit,
 reachable from the east ledge, goes northeast.
 A small catapult, about as tall as you, is standing on the west ledge,
 aimed towards the east ledge. You have come across this type of
 catapult before. They are very easy to use, just put something in it,
 and it will be shot out automatically before the catapult adjusts
 itself so that it is ready to shoot again. These catapults are no
 longer being sold due to the large number of accidents they have
 caused.
 A large wooden crank sticks out from the east wall above the ledge.

 Bumper cave
 An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the west. There is

 wall, forming a primitive ladder leading up to a hole in the ceiling.
 A table made from human skulls stands near the northeast exit. On the
 table stands a shimmering pink translucent cube and a small, rusty,
 holy grail.
 A small round stage stands close to the table. It is apparently made
 from human faces frozen in terrible screams.
 A small flamingo-headed man sits behind the table in a
 comfortable-looking armchair covered in obviously fake giraffe fur. He
 is wearing a Santa Claus suit. He is staring at the pink cube.
 A beautifully decorated Christmas tree stands in a corner.

 You can see the goblin sidekick here.

 buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
 merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
 horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
 have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
 who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
 is written on the automat next to the buttons.

 Prodigious and very hot cave
 An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the east.
 It is terribly hot here. The intolerable temperature is almost
 certainly caused by the red-hot stone oven standing in a corner.
 A stone table stands in the middle of the cave. Round it stands a stone
 throne with an old troll, a stone chair with a tall troll, a stone
 stool with a short troll, and a large stone. The trolls look a bit like
 humans made of stone, though with no necks, bigger jaws, smaller eyes
 and huge arms and hands. They are drinking lava from large stone mugs
 and playing some kind of card game.

 Tremendous Cave
 An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the

 Some runes are written on the wall.
 A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He
 is fat, purple and has two very thick legs. He is wearing your helmet
 and a yellow wool suit.
 A young angry-looking woman wearing a yellow wool jacket and yellow
 wool gloves, stands holding a large placard saying "Save the carrot
 fairy!" She is clearly one of those monster rights activists that have
 been making your job so much harder lately.
 The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green
 humanoid creature with pointy ears. He is wearing a tiny ring and a
 yellow woolen cap and is smoking a tiny cigarette.
 A carrot with tiny wings flies around. Its arms and legs look like
 those of a human, only much smaller. It has no head or face. It is
 wearing a yellow woolen scarf. A steady shower of shimmering sparks
 falls from all over its body; each spark disappears before hitting the
 ground.
 A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is open and empty.
 A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very
 complex. Actually it is very easy to use. You know this because on a
 previous product-testing mission you came across a machine just like it
 and spend four hours trying to figure out how it worked. The machine is
 for sharpening tools and weapons. Just put what you want sharpened into
 it and wait.

 There is quite a lot of blood here.

 Vast cave
 This cave has an exit leading outside to the southwest. In the middle
 of the ceiling, high above you, is a round hole. On the floor, directly
 under the hole, is a pile of hay.
 A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a
 thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through.
 A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave
 floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you
 recognize the pyramid as one of the safest and least complicated
 models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly.
 This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is
 far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave.

 You can hear a low humming coming from the teleporter.

 Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's
 Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you
 are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake
 the lever.

 You can see a cage here.

 The goblin comes running after you.

 The sword goes even crazier and starts thrashing like a headless
 chicken on drugs.

 The sword makes the lever shake. The sound from the teleporter gets
 louder.

>goblin, stand on teleporter

 electrical sparks shoots up from the teleporter. The goblin giggles.

 smoking. The cave begins to fade out around you, and another cave fades
 in.

 Voluminous cave

 round hole.
 A huge monster skeleton lies here, with an elf skeleton in its mouth.

 The goblin begins to fade in next to you. You look down at yourself.
 You seem unsubstantial, like a ghost. Slowly you begin to take on a

 A goblin woman is standing here. She is wearing a medallion, winter
 boots, a long fur coat and a round fur hat. She is carrying a purse.
 You are not quite sure, but with her long ears, sharp yellow teeth, and
 big feet you think she is pretty cute by goblin standards. She is
 holding your magical crossbow.

 The goblin comes running after you.

 "Well, hello there!" says the female goblin and smiles.

 "Uh, hi," says the goblin, his cheeks turning a darker shade of green.
 They seem distracted.

 shouting, "Wheeeeeee!" and you look up. The goblin is falling right

 Big cave
 This cave has an exit southeast to the outside, or you could go further
 into the mountain to the northwest.
 A somewhat larger than life-size statue of his holiness One-Hand Jack
 stands in the middle of the cave. Jack used to be an infamous pirate,
 but later formed Hoverism, a peaceful religion. The statue holds its
 left arm out and up, the hook at the end of it just low enough to be
 reached. The statue's head is gone.
 An old Hoverist is hovering about a meter above the floor. He is
 sitting in the lotus position, his head is turned towards the statue,
 and his eyes are closed. He is wearing a white loincloth. Somebody has
 hung some Christmas ornaments on him.
 Several fragments from the safe are lying here.

 Though you cannot see it, you know that a Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of
 Invisibility hangs on the hook. It is supposed to turn visible (or turn
 invisible again) whenever you say the magic word "tango".

>about
 You are a product tester for the Adventurer's Consumer Guide, a
 magazine that reviews all sorts of equipment an adventurer might need
 for his adventures. Your magazine is highly respected because of the
 thorough tests you put the equipment through. The tests aren't just
 done at the magazine's offices. No, the product testers go on actual
 adventures to test the equipment out in the field. Sometimes you kill
 an evil overlord; sometimes you rescue a fair maiden. Most of the time,
 like today, you just go out looking for a treasure in Treasure Cave
 Mountain, a perfect place for adventures as it contains plenty of
 caves, treasures, monsters and traps.

 As you are putting on the soon-to-be-tested magical coat, magical ring
 and magical helmet, your editor says, "On this mission you'll be having
 a helper with you."
 "Really?" you say. You usually work alone.
 "Yeah, but it's part of a test. See, there's this new agency that is
 renting out sidekicks. We are going to write a review about it. Oh,
 here he is now."
 Into your office walks a goblin: a green humanoid creature with pointy
 ears, about a meter tall. "Hi, you must be my new boss," he says to
 you.
 "I guess I am. What is it you're supposed to do, exactly?"
 "Well, I'm very brave and helpful, plus I'm a ferocious killing
 machine. If you see any kind of monster, or anything at all, and you
 want it killed, just tell me, and it's toast."
 "Okay... well, I think we should get going."

 You and your new companion are off to Treasure Cave Mountain. Your
 mission is to return with one really big treasure. Any really big
 treasure.

 descriptions of the things in the room you are in, or "inventory" to
 see descriptions of what you are carrying. You also can't use "look
 But you can use "read".
 To see your inventory without the long descriptions of all you are
 carrying, type: "inventory short". Or simply: "i s". Or simply: "is".
 No time passes when you use "look" or "inventory".
 You communicate by "talk to [whatever]", or by giving commands in this
 format: "goblin, give me the cow-o-meter".
 It is possible to put this game in an unwinnable state, but you should
 be able to figure out when this has happened.
