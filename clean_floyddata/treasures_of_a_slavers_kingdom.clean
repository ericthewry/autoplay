 slave-master's realm, his destiny is his own and his QUEST is clear:
 pillage upon the wealth of the kingdom, and defeat the SLAVER KING
 once and for all!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN PLAIN</span>
 A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a blood-red
 sun. There are many paths. You see mountains to the distant east. You
 feel a manly twitching in your thews, enlivened by the freedom of the
 open country.

 You can see a GLADIUS SWORD here.

>twitch thew


 I beggest thy pardon? Seek guidance with the HELP command.

>seize sword


 Seized.

>regard sword


 It reminds you of a GLADIUS SWORD from your childhood.

 Five "action commands" are the heart of the barbarian's experience:
 <span class="floydstyle i">REGARD</span> (examine, consider), <span class="floydstyle i">SEIZE</span> (take into your
 possession), <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> (make use of in some way), <span class="floydstyle i">PARLEY</span> WITH
 (converse with peaceably), and <span class="floydstyle i">ASSAIL</span> (do violence upon). These
 are verbs to be followed by a noun: PARLEY WITH ALICE; SEIZE THE IDOL;
 USE THE BANANA. For greater complexity, the <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> command can
 combine two nouns: USE THE BRIBE WITH THE MAGISTRATE, USE THE DAGGER
 ON THE ROPE. <span class="floydstyle em">All success in the SLAVER KING'S realm depends on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">these action commands.</span>

 Type a direction (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, EXIT,
 ENTER) to travel. The proper command is <span class="floydstyle i">JOURNEY</span>, but direction
 alone will suffice. Other useful commands include: PILLAGE (seize
 everything at once), DISCARD (drop a thing), SHED (drop many things at
 once), and REPOSE (pause to heal or think great thoughts).

 Some important commands are for the player rather than the barbarian.
 These include SAVE and RESTORE to preserve and return to game-states
 between sessions, QUIT to abandon play, OFFICIAL, APPRENTICE and WIMP
 to adjust battle difficulty, and reference commands such as TABULATE,
 PROWESS, and SCORE. Other commands (and shortcuts) are also provided.
 Refer to your game manual.

>use sword


 You heft the GLADIUS SWORD in your mighty hand, prepared for battle!

>inventory


 You carry only a GLADIUS SWORD (held at the ready), and your trusty
 THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG.

>examine bag


 The DUFFEL BAG is crafted of sturdy THESKIAN CANVAS. It bears the
 stains, smells, and wear of many years of broody, restless barbarian
 travel.



 Prithee pardon, barbarian? Your game manual, or the HELP command,
 might give aid and succor.

>open bag


 Striveth for wisdom in thy endeavors, barbarian. Your game manual, or
 the HELP command, might give aid and succor.

>use bag


 The THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG is practically an extension of you; you've
 carried it since you were an infant, and it does its job without
 commands.




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OLD STONE BRIDGE</span>
 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to
 the east, and disappearing into a small CULVERT at the base of a
 cliff. This cliff, and the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an icy
 shadow over the bridge. There is no path to the CASTLE from here, but
 the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

 The OLD STONE BRIDGE is guarded by a LIZARD MAIDEN, half a head taller
 than you. The LIZARD MEN rarely permit their women to become warriors,
 but this one obviously didn't seek permission! She may even be some
 kind of LIZARD-AMAZON hybrid ... you know not. She would be lovely,
 but for her green scales, cold blood, needle-like fangs and snake-like
 eyes.

 She hefts an impressive green-metal TWO-HANDED SWORD and looks you in
 the eye. "I await a worthy foe, rat-slave. Dare you challenge me?" She
 laughs a hissing laugh. "If not, you may scurry away in peace. Only
 men of mettle concern me."

>regard lizard

 "Coward!"

>assail lizard



 Sa-ho! You give the LIZARD MAIDEN a sampling of your GLADIUS SWORD,

 The LIZARD MAIDEN dances in a defensive stance, watching your
 movements, hissing, and looking for an opening.

>assail lizard



 By Huron's unavoidable odor! A miss!

 The LIZARD MAIDEN attacks!<span class="floydstyle em"> You have suffered 13 hits of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">damage!</span>

>go south



 By Huron's inscrutable Bridge partners! You try to flee, but thine
 legs fail thee in thy battered state! You must fight ... or be
 vanquished!

 With a howl of rage, the LIZARD MAIDEN strikes!<span class="floydstyle em"> You have suffered</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">9 hits of damage!</span>



     <span class="floydstyle i">*** YOU ARE NO MORE ***</span>


 In that game you scored 2 out of a possible 500, in 11 turns, earning
 you the rank of "Lout Far From Home".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SCARRED FOREST</span>
 The remains of FALLEN TREES are here, overgrown with ferns and
 surrounding a half-buried shack of once-fine metal, draped with canvas
 and pocked with rust. You are wise in the ways of these: they are the
 "space-ships" that brought men from dark places in the sky, ere they
 fell.

 You notice a hatchway hanging open; you could ENTER if you so desired.
 This remnant of a ROCKET seems abandoned, apart from a tired-looking
 metallic figure slumped against its side ...

 You can see a ROBODROID here.



 Parts of him are clearly torn open, and rust grows on his silver skin
 like the lesions snarling on some Bloodhaven beggar. Tiny lights on
 his flat display-face shine ever-so-weakly. There is life left in him,
 but precious little. He moves not.

>parley with robodroid


 Speaking - nay, even shouting - elicits no response, save for a gentle
 change in the rhythm of his facial light-display. There are sparks
 flying from some tiny moving parts on one side of his head, where the
 surface is torn open ... they are too rusted to move freely.

>assail droid


 The ROBODROID is not your foe, barbarian. In fact, he seems quite
 helpless.

>regard trees


 The "space-ship" tore many trees from their roots when it fell here.
 They lie here still, creating an unnatural clearing in the forest.
 They are now overgrown with flowers, ferns, and mosses.



 A quick visit to the ROCKET COCKPIT wouldst satisfy thy curiosity.

 By Huron's tainted tam-o'-shanter, it is good to feel freedom once
 more! After weeks of mistreatment at the hands of the SLAVER KING'S
 catchers, you are as weak as a youngling ... but as you raise your
 dark gaze toward the distant CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, you are
 invigorated not only by your freedom, but by the lusty dream of
 VENGEANCE upon him!

>in



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKET COCKPIT</span>
 Much of the shack has been stripped for pieces, no doubt to be sold in
 God City, far to the west. Only scraps remain.

 You can see an ABSORBENT SPACE-RAG and a FLASHLIGHT here.

>pillage


 ABSORBENT SPACE-RAG: Seized.
 FLASHLIGHT: Seized.

>regard rag


 The SPACE-RAG is a fine scrap of red cloth made by the "gods" who once
 traveled the stars. You can use it to mop your barbarian brow,
 perhaps.

 The FLASHLIGHT is a tool of science, used to make light. It maketh

 Rubbing a dry RAG on the rusty surface of the ROBODROID does the

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PHASIC SUMP</span>
 The forest here is mucky and warm, surrounding a sinkhole filled with
 iridescent, gently glowing water. Some huge PIPES lead from here into
 the ground, and they drip with a similar strange water. There is a
 foul electric odor here, and your vision swims. You can feel your body
 being overtaken by weakness!

 You can see a SUIT OF BURLAP ARMOR here.

 You are weakening so quickly ... Your barbarian instinct is to get far
 from here ...

 It's just about the humblest suit of armor you've ever seen, but it's

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DIZZYING CLIFFSIDE</span>
 This is the edge of a great cliff, looking over a vast CHASM to the
 south. The mists are so heavy within that you can barely detect a
 raging river far, far below.

 A tiny TREE clings tenaciously to the edge of the cliff.

 Your foot turns a small stone, and a hundred THRITAMA LARVAE squirm
 angrily, and burrow deep to avoid the light.

>regard larvae


 'Tis less than worthy of thy fearsome concern.

>regard tree


 The leaves are all gone, but a single small FRUIT hangs from the
 farthest tip of the farthest branch, out over the CHASM.

>regard chasm


 It is all mist in the deeps of the CHASM, but here at the edge, the
 orange glow of the evening sun highlights the cliffsides. You suppose
 that on the other side there lay either the EMPIRE OF DARTH VIRAXIS or
 one of the rival SLAVER KINGDOMS. These are matters you can clarify
 once the SLAVER KING of this particular realm lay dead by your
 vengeful hand.

>regard fruit


 The FRUIT is small and red.

 plain ACTION COMMANDS, marry-ed unto reasonable nouns! Sooth!

>assail tree


 The TINY TREE is not your foe, barbarian.

>seize tree


 It clings quite tenaciously. Besides, you have no use for it.



 Thou art only accustomed to ASSAILING things with a GLADIUS SWORD,
 preferably in a frothing, bloody rage filled with lusty war-oaths,
 suggestive hip-thrusts and savage leering.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PRISMATIC SPRAY</span>
 A high WATERFALL cascades down from a mountain ridge above, foaming
 and roaring into a broad POOL of clean water. The result is a
 brilliant PRISMATIC SPRAY. The setting is very peaceful.

 Swimming in the crystalline POOL is a MAGIC FISH, swimming a lazy
 figure-eight.

>regard fish


 It's just your typical MAGIC FISH. It seems to be watching you.

>catch fish


 Bedlam and disarray! Refer to your game manual for assistance.

>enter pool


 Thou hast always regarded bathing as one of those things that happens
 to other people.

>parley fish


 The dullest Planetary Ape can do better than that.

>parley with fish


 If you're going to start talking to MAGIC FISH, you may as well just
 chat with your THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG.

>parley with bag


 You while away the hours, chatting with your THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG, as
 you have so many times. But this time, something happens that never
 has before: a SPIRIT rises from the careworn canvas, and bids you
 follow ... into a long, swirling void ...

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 You find yourself in an idyllic village. In the distance, craftsmen
 work great LOOMS, producing swaths of what you know as THESKIAN
 CANVAS. The air here is sweet, and the citizens are rosy-cheeked,
 healthy, and cheerful. They welcome you with BELGIAN THESKIAN WAFFLES
 and THESKIAN BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

 The SPIRIT leads you through the streets. "I have seen lately,
 barbarian, that you are pondering the nature of your trusty THESKIAN
 DUFFEL BAG ... I am part of that nature, so I brought you here, to
 satisfy your thirst for wisdom."

 "This," he says, with a sweeping gesture, "is the town of DUFFEL
 (ANTWERP, BELGIUM) where traditional woolen-canvas fabrics are
 produced for the entire galaxy ... including the THESKIAN merchant
 ports." He smiles a sad smile. "Of course, I speak of the past, before
 our galaxy fell to ruin ... but it is the past that concerns us right
 now."

 "Your BAG," he says, "began here, on those distant LOOMS, before you
 were born. The fabric was shipped offworld, where THESKIAN LUGGAGE
 ARTISANS forged a mighty and capacious DUFFEL. Its first owner, a
 SPACEFARER, carried it to your world of VANTH, where he bedded your
 MOTHER in a night of revelry somewhere near the realm of the IRON
 DWARF KING." Rather unecessarily, you think, he summons a magic
 HOLOGRAM of these events.

 Narrating the HOLOGRAM, he continues: "It was a night of fiery and
 tender passions, with your FATHER passed out in a STABLE nearby. The
 SPACEFARER gave the DUFFEL to your MOTHER, saying that if a child
 might spring from their intense and repeated coupling (or those
 joinings that might produce children, for as you can see there was
 much variety), that the child should be granted his useful BAG, that
 he might know the gifts of a mighty SPACEFARER."

 The SPIRIT looks you in the eye. "You, of course, are that child." At
 this point, the HOLOGRAM is a series of embarassing naked-baby
 pictures, most of which also feature the THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG.

 "So you see, that is how THESKIAN DUFFEL BAGS came to be on VANTH, and
 why they are so valued. They are gifts from the stars, and your BAG,
 dear barbarian, is more than that ... it is your heritage."

 "I tell you this because the spirit of BELGIUM lives on in your BAG!
 We have no patience for despots like the SLAVER KING! Indeed, our fair
 land was ruled by conquerors for EIGHTEEN CENTURIES. The Romans, the
 Franks, the Austrians, the Burgundians and more." His voice takes on a
 deep, proud timbre. "But no more, barbarian. BELGIUM is a
 parliamentary democracy, producing wheat, fruits and sugar beets
 alongside our fine metal products and glassware ... and our tourist
 industry is not the mere joke that the 'Monty Python' would have you
 believe! Oh no. We are a lovely realm, and perhaps some day you may
 quest here ..."

 "But for now, barbarian, know ye TRUTH. Do your DUFFEL BAG proud, fine
 warrior! Defeat the SLAVER KING!"

 ... and then you feel yourself awaken, as if from a deep sleep.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in
 every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk
 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

>regard idol


 The features of the IDOL glare with stony, furious contempt, as if
 <span class="floydstyle em">daring</span> you to USE it.

 Your keen senses detect signs that a MANION DEVIL hath passed near
 here, not long ago.

 There is a sudden gurgling from the muck, and a MIRE IMP leaps out!
 The MIRE IMP unleashes its glistening claws, and glares upon on your
 barbarian countenance with naked, animal hatred!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

>use bait on bear


 You extend the STINKY BAIT toward the GRIZZLY, and the great BEAR'S
 nose twitches damply as it looks up from the fresh flowing waters of
 the stream.

 Slowly, cautiously, the GRIZZLY approaches. He sniffs at the STINKY
 BAIT, motivated by obvious hunger, but grunts sadly, and returns to
 pawing the water in hopes.



 It is a large GRIZZLY BEAR, but it seemeth lean and hungry. Its
 attempts at fishing in the MOUNTAIN STREAM are apparently bearing no
 fruit (or fish).

>examine stream


 As you look upon the BRISKLY-FLOWING STREAM, you can't escape the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FROSTED UPLANDS</span>
 Layers of frost and snow glitter on crags of ancient rock, and there
 are deep snowbanks to the north, approaching a BRIDGE made of pure
 ice, spanning a MIGHTY CREVASSE. Also seemingly made of ice is a
 beautiful CRYSTAL SPIRE, towering in the fading light, which you may

 Inside the ice-like spire, it is strangely warm, and the air is

 not. OUTSIDE, the FROSTED UPLANDS are only a fractured blur. From
 here, you can make your way UP to the EERIE PINNACLE, where strange
 lights play.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">EERIE PINNACLE</span>
 You stand in the uppermost chamber of the strange crystalline tower.
 The air here is thick with energy and flooded with light from no
 particular source. There is a blinding whiteness, as if you're in a
 vast field of snow ... but the air is hot, not cold.

 Floating in mid-air is a beautiful NECKLACE OF STARLIGHT, a dazzling
 treasure!

 But for such a prize to be unprotected ... Your barbarian instincts
 warn of unseen dangers, and something else ... an unseen rival?

>regard necklace


 Imagine if the GODS took down all the stars from the sky, and strung
 them along a fine chain of silver, and sold it in GOD CITY. With the
 money they might gain from the bargain, they could put a down-payment
 on the NECKLACE OF STARLIGHT.

 Just as your fingertips brush the scintillating surface of the

 ELECTRO-PHASIC QUASIMATTER! A deadly VOLTAIC WRAITH!

 The WRAITH attacks!<span class="floydstyle em"> You have suffered 9 hits of damage!</span>

 A SCIENTIST wouldst describe the WRAITH as a semi-corporeal arc
 construction of sapient hostile quasi-matter manifesting on a voltaic

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">CRYSTAL SPIRE</span>
 Inside the ice-like spire, it is strangely warm, and the air is
 charged with crackling energies, but magic or someting else? Know ye
 not. OUTSIDE, the FROSTED UPLANDS are only a fractured blur. From
 here, you can make your way UP to the EERIE PINNACLE, where strange
 lights play.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">EERIE PINNACLE</span>
 You stand in the uppermost chamber of the strange crystalline tower.
 The air here is thick with energy and flooded with light from no
 particular source. There is a blinding whiteness, as if you're in a
 vast field of snow ... but the air is hot, not cold.

 Floating in mid-air is a beautiful NECKLACE OF STARLIGHT, a dazzling
 treasure!

 But for such a prize to be unprotected ... Your barbarian instincts
 warn of unseen dangers, and something else ... an unseen rival?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FROSTED UPLANDS</span>
 Layers of frost and snow glitter on crags of ancient rock, and there
 are deep snowbanks to the north, approaching a BRIDGE made of pure
 ice, spanning a MIGHTY CREVASSE. Also seemingly made of ice is a
 beautiful CRYSTAL SPIRE, towering in the fading light, which you may
 ENTER.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

 You pause to take in the deep orange and red of the evening sky, heavy
 with clouds.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ABANDONED QUARRY</span>
 This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the
 east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the
 CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town.
 The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous
 and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEL PIT OF ROGUES</span>
 Sa-ho! By Huron's vacticinal cowlick, this is a party! Here in this
 GRAVEL PIT, a collection of rowdies and jackanapes have made an outlaw
 camp, with drink and music and fighting galore! The center of
 attention seems to be a GLADIATOR'S RING.

 You see a nearby CHALLENGE POST, and a PARTY OF ROGUES stands by,
 engaged in revels and high jinks.

>regard ring


 The GLADIATOR'S RING is a simple open space where the gravel has been
 flattened in an open circle, to mark a place of battle.

>regard post


 The CHALLENGE POST is a wooden pole hung with dyed banners, each
 representing a GLADIATOR willing to meet challengers. Beginning with
 the lowest, the banners are BLUE, GREEN, GOLD, and RED. There is room
 for one more banner above the others, but RED is presently the highest
 on the POST.

 A nearby rogue espies your curiosity, and sayeth "If ye wish a bout,
 barbarian, SEIZE the banner of your chosen foe, to display your
 challenge!"

>regard rogues


 The PARTY OF ROGUES seem quite the band of ne'er do wells!

>seize blue



 As you pluck the BLUE BANNER from the CHALLENGE POST, the assembled
 rowdies cheer! You are ushered into the gladiator's ring, where you
 stand face-to-face with VON DARTH THE SLY! "It's good to face a worthy
 foe, barbarian!" he shouts, and salutes you.

 You take a moment to REGARD your opponent ... VON DARTH THE SLY is a
 short, mutated human with an extra arm sticking out of his neck. In
 this third arm he holds a wicked-looking MACHETE. With his free hands
 he gestures rudely for the crowd's amusement. He stands eagerly,
 waiting for your next move.

>assail darth

 You stumble, and fall to the ground. VON DARTH THE SLY has beaten you.

 The world goes black for a moment, as VON DARTH THE SLY lays you low
 with a hard stroke from his MACHETE.

 You are drawn from the darkness by the cheering crowd, showering VON
 DARTH with ale and praise. As your eyes refocus, you see his smiling
 face above you, and his third hand extended to help you to your feet.

 "You fought well, barbarian. It might just as easily been me lying
 there in the dust. Let yourself heal, and then return to challenge me
 once more! It was a pleasure to face a man with real spirit!"

 The SLAVER KING maintains this plank-paved highway for the good of his

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SEASHORE</span>
 An elderly LIGHTHOUSE is here (you could go IN), warning ships against
 the dangers of the rocky coastline. This stretch includes some soft

 This old LIGHTHOUSE is in poor repair, but not quite abandoned. While

 You can see an ENORMOUS LAMP here.

 As you look upon the SEA, you can't escape the feeling that the SEA is

>use bait on sea


 The STINKY BAIT is truly foul, but sometimes a man just feels the urge
 to expose his skin, smear it with rotted bait, bare it to the ocean
 and see if anything interesting happens. It's how your parents met.

 For a few minutes, the only noticeable effect is a migration of all
 the seabirds, who head to the harbor where the stench is more
 civilized. But then there is a visible movement out at sea ... a
 rising darkness in the clear green waters which resolves itself to a
 speeding mountain of scaly flesh, an errant island of rippling water
 washing over green-black muscle and sudden, fire-bright yellow eyes.

 When the ENORMOUS SEA-MONSTER rises out of the water, you wonder for a
 moment how the ocean ever contained it. It's larger than the nearby
 city!

 And then it eats you.

 The floor is the squishy flesh of a monstrous gullet. The walls are

 You can see a HALF-DIGESTED CORPSE bobbing in the rising, sizzling

 a "pssst!"

 You look down and see a HOBLING. "Barbarian," he says, "I can see
 you're new here in the ALLEYWAY. I should explain a thing or two." He
 looks both ways carefully before he continues. "This ALLEYWAY here ...
 if you ever want to stash anything, there's no safer place than right
 here. Me and the boys, we look after it, see."

 He sees the doubt on your features, and smiles. "We're CRIMINALS
 around here, sure. But we don't <span class="floydstyle em">steal</span> nuffin'! We're
 adventuring types, see. Strictly delving. Open a few doors, disarm a
 few death-traps? It's a living."

 "And more important ..." he hikes a thumb toward the half-open
 doorway. "That is the business place of VESSA, who we call THE
 DELICATE DOXY. She's a very fine girl, and she's a
 <span class="floydstyle em">sweetheart,</span> see. So if we hear about you roughin' her up or

 A young WOMAN reclines on the bed, REGARDING you quietly over the edge
 of a SCROLL she's writing in. Her eyes are piercing, her grin casual
 and playful. This must be VESSA herself, the DELICATE DOXY.

 VESSA slips the SCROLL under a pillow, and looks to you to make the
 next move.

 True to her reputation, VESSA is almost too delicate for a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it
 was, it now lies in ROCKY RUIN. Poking through the remnants, you
 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 Simply walking IN, however, isn't currently an option, as a vast RUIN
 SLUG - the largest you've ever seen - is basking its slimy bulk in the
 evening sun, right near the entrance. The SLUG makes no move toward
 you, but you'd have to ASSAIL it (and survive) to find out what lay
 beyond the arch.

 You can also see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to
 the east, and disappearing into a small CULVERT at the base of a
 cliff. This cliff, and the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an icy
 shadow over the bridge. There is no path to the CASTLE from here, but
 the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

 The OLD STONE BRIDGE is guarded by a LIZARD MAIDEN, half a head taller
 than you. The LIZARD MEN rarely permit their women to become warriors,
 but this one obviously didn't seek permission! She may even be some
 kind of LIZARD-AMAZON hybrid ... you know not. She would be lovely,
 but for her green scales, cold blood, needle-like fangs and snake-like
 eyes.

 She hefts an impressive green-metal TWO-HANDED SWORD and looks you in
 the eye. "I await a worthy foe, rat-slave. Dare you challenge me?" She
 laughs a hissing laugh. "If not, you may scurry away in peace. Only
 men of mettle concern me."

 You can see the VIRAXIAN INCENSE, the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA and GINA THE

 The ACOLYTE OF TRAGA looks up from his work as you enter amid a swirl

 if you need shelter from the cold. The hospitality of our DARK DEMON
 LORD FROM BENEATH THE STYGIAN ABYSSAL PITS is no mere rumor. When you

 GINA notices the look of concern in your eyes. "Worry not, barbarian,

 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in
 every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk
 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 You can also see a PYREXIS HOUND PACK here.

 The entire PACK leaps upon you! You feel tooth and claw shredding at

 The PYREXIS HOUND PACK is defeated!

 With the last of the PYREXIS HOUNDS dead at your feet, you grab the
 strongest by the jaw and rip its head from its body. Examining the
 beast, you recall a lesson taught you by a Pioneer when you were a
 youngling: pluck out the eye of a PYREXIS HOUND, and you need never
 touch flint to steel again. You dig your finger into the socket,
 remove the prize, then cast the head aside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in

 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,

>inventory


 You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty
 THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG): a PYREXIAN EYE, a DELICATELY-OILED CLOTH, a SLAB
 OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT, a TWO-HANDED SWORD (held at the ready), an EAR
 OF CORN, a SUIT OF CHAINMAIL ARMOR (being worn), some STINKY BAIT, a
 SUIT OF BURLAP ARMOR (currently un-used), a FLASHLIGHT and a GLADIUS
 SWORD (currently un-used).

>regard pyrexian eye


 The PYREXIAN EYE, ripped from the skull of the strongest of the SLAVER
 KING'S beloved pets, is very warm to the touch, and but the slightest
 squeeze makes it flash briefly with flame. 'Tis nothing sustained
 enough to provide much light or heat for survival, but the spark is
 well-suited to lighting tinder for a campfire.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PHASIC SUMP</span>
 The forest here is mucky and warm, surrounding a sinkhole filled with
 iridescent, gently glowing water. Some huge PIPES lead from here into
 the ground, and they drip with a similar strange water. There is a
 foul electric odor here, and your vision swims. You can feel your body
 being overtaken by weakness!

 You are weakening so quickly ... Your barbarian instinct is to get far
 from here ...

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PRISMATIC SPRAY</span>
 A high WATERFALL cascades down from a mountain ridge above, foaming
 and roaring into a broad POOL of clean water. The result is a
 brilliant PRISMATIC SPRAY. The setting is very peaceful.

 Swimming in the crystalline POOL is a MAGIC FISH, playing around in
 the churning waters at the base of the WATERFALL.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DIZZYING CLIFFSIDE</span>
 This is the edge of a great cliff, looking over a vast CHASM to the
 south. The mists are so heavy within that you can barely detect a
 raging river far, far below.

 A tiny TREE clings tenaciously to the edge of the cliff.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it
 was, it now lies in ROCKY RUIN. Poking through the remnants, you
 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 Simply walking IN, however, isn't currently an option, as a vast RUIN
 SLUG - the largest you've ever seen - is basking its slimy bulk in the
 evening sun, right near the entrance. The SLUG makes no move toward
 you, but you'd have to ASSAIL it (and survive) to find out what lay
 beyond the arch.

 You can also see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">LONELY HILL</span>
 Forest surrounds this hill on all sides, but there are no trees at the
 top - only grass and a few sad flowers, bending toward the setting
 sun. You see farmland to the north, and the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING
 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SCARRED FOREST</span>
 The remains of FALLEN TREES are here, overgrown with ferns and
 surrounding a half-buried shack of once-fine metal, draped with canvas
 and pocked with rust. You are wise in the ways of these: they are the
 "space-ships" that brought men from dark places in the sky, ere they
 fell.

 You notice a hatchway hanging open; you could ENTER if you so desired.
 This remnant of a ROCKET seems abandoned, apart from a tired-looking
 metallic figure slumped against its side ...

 You can see a ROBODROID here.

>use cloth on robodroid


 Touching the cloth gently to the rusty "wounds" on the ROBODROID'S
 silver skin, the fine ANOINTING OIL allows some of the tiny parts to
 move a bit more freely for a moment. Some of the lights on his flat
 display-face begin to flutter more brightly, and the ROBODROID
 whispers in a thin, crackling voice:

 "Thank. You. Friend. Need. Repair. Cabling. Need. Repair. Power! Find.
 Cabling. Where. Robodroids. Are. There. Cabling. Power! Help. Please.
 Please. Please. Please ..."

 ... and then the ROBODROID falls silent once more.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN PLAIN</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PEAK OF MOUNT GELIDUS</span>
 The view from the summit of MOUNT GELIDUS is enough to move even you,
 to give you a moment's peace from your savage thirst for vengeance.
 But only a moment. As you look down through the mists to the farms and
 forests stretching out to the SEA, the sight of the CASTLE of the
 SLAVER KING, framed in the distant sunset, reminds you of your
 purpose.

 An enormous CLIFF GIANT is sitting here, ninety tons of drowsy, rocky
 mass. Even his beard is made of stone. He's half-looking at the scenic
 vista, half-sleeping. When he snores, it sends minor slides of pebbles
 and loose snow bouncing down the mountainside. He rests in front of
 the entrance to a CAVE.

 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he

 varied, noisy mass of people and creatures from all corners of Vanth.
 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come
 running.

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

 "Look at that lubber barbarian!" one pirate chuckles. "No pirate he;

 here, directly beneath the looming facade of the SLAVER KING'S own

 You take a moment to REGARD your opponent ... VON DARTH THE SLY is a

 VON DARTH THE SLY is defeated!

 With your final blow, VON DARTH THE SLY is cast to the dust and
 gravel, his face bloodied, and his mutant extra arm lolling lamely to
 one side of his neck.

 The crowd erupts in cheers, and you accept their ale and accolades.
 Extending the hand of fellowship to your foe, you help VON DARTH to
 his feet, and he smiles a bloody-toothed smile. "Aye, barbarian! Now
 THAT was a proper beating you gave me, and no mistake! It was a
 privilege."

 The crowd cheers again, and you nod in silent assent. VON DARTH gives
 a weak salute and limps away to heal for a while, and eventually the
 crowd returns to their revels.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEL PIT OF ROGUES</span>
 Sa-ho! By Huron's vanishing vacuoles, this is a party! Here in this
 GRAVEL PIT, a collection of rowdies and jackanapes have made an outlaw
 camp, with drink and music and fighting galore! The center of
 attention seems to be a GLADIATOR'S RING.

 You see a nearby CHALLENGE POST, and a PARTY OF ROGUES stands by,
 engaged in revels and high jinks.

>regard post


 The CHALLENGE POST is a wooden pole hung with dyed banners, each
 representing a GLADIATOR willing to meet challengers. Beginning with
 the lowest, the banners are BLUE, GREEN, GOLD, and RED. There is room
 for one more banner above the others, but RED is presently the highest
 on the POST.

 A nearby rogue espies your curiosity, and sayeth "If ye wish a bout,
 barbarian, SEIZE the banner of your chosen foe, to display your
 challenge!"

>regard ring


 The GLADIATOR'S RING is a simple open space where the gravel has been
 flattened in an open circle, to mark a place of battle.

>regard red


 The RED BANNER is an embroidered bit of dyed canvas, made perhaps of
 sailcloth. It bears the personal SIGIL of a GRAVEL-PIT GLADIATOR.

>regard sigil


 Which do you mean, the BLUE BANNER, the GREEN BANNER, the GOLD BANNER
 or the RED BANNER?

>regard green banner


 The GREEN BANNER is an embroidered bit of dyed canvas, made perhaps of
 sailcloth. It bears the personal SIGIL of a GRAVEL-PIT GLADIATOR.

>regard gold banner


 The GOLD BANNER is an embroidered bit of dyed canvas, made perhaps of
 sailcloth. It bears the personal SIGIL of a GRAVEL-PIT GLADIATOR.

>inventory


 You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty
 THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG): a PYREXIAN EYE, a DELICATELY-OILED CLOTH, a SLAB
 OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT, a TWO-HANDED SWORD (held at the ready), an EAR
 OF CORN, a SUIT OF CHAINMAIL ARMOR (being worn), some STINKY BAIT, a
 SUIT OF BURLAP ARMOR (currently un-used), a FLASHLIGHT and a GLADIUS
 SWORD (currently un-used).

>regard meat


 The SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT shines in its raw ichor. Your tribe has
 long known that the flesh of this beast, once properly ripened and
 then consumed rapidly, has magic healing properties that allow
 Warriors to defeat foes much more powerful than they. Useful, for a
 Warrior-born such as you! This slab has now ripened; the ichor swirls
 with prismatic power and the stench is comforting.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ABANDONED QUARRY</span>
 This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the
 east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the
 CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town.
 The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous
 and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

 You sure could use a good fight.

>give corn to bear


 Thou hast exceeded the limits of SCIENTIFIC TECHNO-REASONING. Refer to
 your game manual for assistance.

>use corn on bear


 You extend the EAR OF CORN toward the GRIZZLY, and the great BEAR'S
 nose twitches damply as it looks up from the fresh flowing waters of
 the stream.

 Slowly, cautiously, the GRIZZLY approaches. He sniffs at the EAR OF
 CORN, motivated by obvious hunger, but grunts sadly, and returns to
 pawing the water in hopes.

>regard stream


 It's only a BRISKLY-FLOWING STREAM, but it hath a certain charm.

>use eye on corn

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OLD STONE BRIDGE</span>
 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to

 the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

>go west

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN PLAIN</span>
 A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a blood-red

 feel a manly twitching in your thews, enlivened by the freedom of the
 open country.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FARMER'S GREEN</span>
 A humble WELL provides a centerpiece for this quiet place, surrounded
 by farmland providing food for the port town to the west. To the
 north, the shadow of the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE blots out part of the
 evening sky, but there's no path there from here.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">BUSTLING PORT</span>
 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he
 may have spies anywhere! Fortunately, the crowd here at the docks is a
 varied, noisy mass of people and creatures from all corners of Vanth.
 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come
 running.

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DARK ALLEYWAY</span>
 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air
 and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another,
 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

>in



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PERFUMED BOUDOIR</span>
 You find yourself in a soft maze of colored veils, leading to a large
 bed piled with furs and cloth pillows. There are no candles or
 oil-lamps here, but rather globes of red glass lit by magic, pulsing
 with the rhythm of soft music.

 The DELICATE DOXY reclines on the bed, REGARDING you quietly, grinning
 playfully, and chewing on a bit of her auburn hair. "Hello again,
 barbarian," she says.

>give corn to vessa


 Select with care thy endeavors, barbarian. The HELP command may offer
 some remedy.

>use corn on vessa


 VESSA smiles, and gently caresses the EAR OF CORN. "Oh, barbarian,
 that's a <span class="floydstyle em">very</span> wicked thought, and you know I'd adore taking
 you to my bed, but really, that isn't respectful payment for what I
 can offer you." Her smile brightens. "If you bring me some proper
 payment, it might be fun if you bring the EAR OF CORN along as well
 ..."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEYARD</span>
 This dismal GRAVEYARD sits on a hill cloaked in mist, overlooking the
 SLAVER KING'S seedy SEAPORT to the north. There are hundreds of
 gravestones, some cracked with centuries of age, some quite new. There
 is a single large TOMB that a brave soul might choose to ENTER.

 The breeze dies entirely; now the air is completely still.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it
 was, it now lies in ROCKY RUIN. Poking through the remnants, you
 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 Simply walking IN, however, isn't currently an option, as a vast RUIN
 SLUG - the largest you've ever seen - is basking its slimy bulk in the
 evening sun, right near the entrance. The SLUG makes no move toward
 you, but you'd have to ASSAIL it (and survive) to find out what lay
 beyond the arch.

 You can also see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

>use eye on slug


 You waggle the PYREXIAN EYE at the RUIN SLUG, making gurgly noises.
 The RUIN SLUG looks at you like you're an idiot.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DIZZYING CLIFFSIDE</span>
 This is the edge of a great cliff, looking over a vast CHASM to the
 south. The mists are so heavy within that you can barely detect a
 raging river far, far below.

 A tiny TREE clings tenaciously to the edge of the cliff.

>use eye on tree


 I know you want to set the world on fire, barbarian, but try

 SUIT OF BURLAP ARMOR (currently un-used), a FLASHLIGHT and a GLADIUS
 SWORD (currently un-used).

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PRISMATIC SPRAY</span>
 A high WATERFALL cascades down from a mountain ridge above, foaming
 and roaring into a broad POOL of clean water. The result is a
 brilliant PRISMATIC SPRAY. The setting is very peaceful.

 Swimming in the crystalline POOL is a MAGIC FISH, chasing glittering
 insects that hover near the water's surface.

>use bait on fish


 You lower the STINKY BAIT to tempt the MAGIC FISH, but the FISH darts
 away rapidly. It seems that MAGIC FISH have better taste in BAIT than
 your average MIRE IMP.

>use corn on fish


 The MAGIC FISH just swims deeper into the POOL, ignoring you.



 The PYREXIAN EYE, ripped from the skull of the strongest of the SLAVER
 KING'S beloved pets, is very warm to the touch, and but the slightest
 squeeze makes it flash briefly with flame. 'Tis nothing sustained
 enough to provide much light or heat for survival, but the spark is
 well-suited to lighting tinder for a campfire.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PHASIC SUMP</span>
 The forest here is mucky and warm, surrounding a sinkhole filled with
 iridescent, gently glowing water. Some huge PIPES lead from here into
 the ground, and they drip with a similar strange water. There is a
 foul electric odor here, and your vision swims. You can feel your body
 being overtaken by weakness!

 You are weakening so quickly ... Your barbarian instinct is to get far

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in

 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 The VOLTAIC WRAITH hisses and pops, and evaporates in a puff of acrid

 "BARBARIAN! I WILL ... RETURN ... FOR VENGEANCE!"

 Then, you hear the gentle report of girlish laughter. A very beautiful
 ELF girl, dressed in a tight white body-suit, calls out to you from
 high above, where she clings to the slick crystalline ceiling by some
 unknown magic!

 "Thank you, fair barbarian, for defeating the VOLTAIC WRAITH! I never
 could have done so on my own, and so, without you, I never could have
 obtained this NECKLACE OF STARLIGHT!"

 With a wink, she squirms out through a venting-hole in the crystal,

 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DARK ALLEYWAY</span>
 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air
 and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another,
 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PERFUMED BOUDOIR</span>
 You find yourself in a soft maze of colored veils, leading to a large
 bed piled with furs and cloth pillows. There are no candles or
 oil-lamps here, but rather globes of red glass lit by magic, pulsing
 with the rhythm of soft music.

 The DELICATE DOXY reclines on the bed, REGARDING you quietly, grinning
 playfully, and chewing on a bit of her auburn hair. "Hello again,
 barbarian," she says.

 "Oh, barbarian!" the lass coos, running her finger across the surface
 of the gem, inspiring sparks to coil beneath its surface. "'Tis none
 other than a Vulkin Amber Sapphire! Long have I coveted such a thing!"
 She looks you up and down, and quietly closes the boudoir door. "This
 will buy you many unusual pleasures ..."

 ... Many hours (and many unusual pleasures) later, VESSA THE DELICATE
 DOXY lay naked beside you, tracing a finger along your corded neck and
 regarding your physique with silent amusement. After a time, she
 speaks:

 "Barbarian, your mien leaves no mistake and while I am but young, I am
 wise in the ways of the court, for many of the SLAVER KING'S lords do
 visit to play in my PERFUMED BOUDOIR. I have heard tell of a barbarian
 who escaped from the slave-caravan, a barbarian with fire in his eyes
 ... eyes that might look eagerly toward bloody vengeance on the SLAVER
 KING. What say you?"

 Reading your silence, the DOXY draws out a SCROLL from beneath her
 pillow. "Here are some notes I've kept, young lion, young panther,
 young upland ecru-spotted lynx, some other ... rumors ... that may be
 of use to one brave enough to challenge a kingdom." She stares into
 your eyes. "I believe that such a man as you (she says this with a
 growling purr) may indeed be a threat to the SLAVER KING, and the
 SLAVER KING treats Doxies most cruelly. I would love to see him
 punished."

 ... Many more hours (and etc) later, you emerge from the DOXY's
 chambers, sated and well-pleased, and scented with jasmine and
 feminine ardour.

 The SCROLL is perfumed with a delicate touch, gilt at the edges, and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEYARD</span>
 This dismal GRAVEYARD sits on a hill cloaked in mist, overlooking the
 SLAVER KING'S seedy SEAPORT to the north. There are hundreds of
 gravestones, some cracked with centuries of age, some quite new. There
 is a single large TOMB that a brave soul might choose to ENTER.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it
 was, it now lies in ROCKY RUIN. Poking through the remnants, you
 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 Simply walking IN, however, isn't currently an option, as a vast RUIN
 SLUG - the largest you've ever seen - is basking its slimy bulk in the
 evening sun, right near the entrance. The SLUG makes no move toward
 you, but you'd have to ASSAIL it (and survive) to find out what lay
 beyond the arch.

 You can also see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DIZZYING CLIFFSIDE</span>
 This is the edge of a great cliff, looking over a vast CHASM to the
 south. The mists are so heavy within that you can barely detect a
 raging river far, far below.

 A tiny TREE clings tenaciously to the edge of the cliff.

>examine tree


 The leaves are all gone, but a single small FRUIT hangs from the
 farthest tip of the farthest branch, out over the CHASM.

>examine river


 It is all mist in the deeps of the CHASM, but here at the edge, the
 orange glow of the evening sun highlights the cliffsides. You suppose
 that on the other side there lay either the EMPIRE OF DARTH VIRAXIS or
 one of the rival SLAVER KINGDOMS. These are matters you can clarify
 once the SLAVER KING of this particular realm lay dead by your
 vengeful hand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PRISMATIC SPRAY</span>
 A high WATERFALL cascades down from a mountain ridge above, foaming
 and roaring into a broad POOL of clean water. The result is a
 brilliant PRISMATIC SPRAY. The setting is very peaceful.

 Swimming in the crystalline POOL is a MAGIC FISH, swimming a lazy
 figure-eight.

 The WATERFALL cascades down from streams high up toward MOUNT GELIDUS.
 It's very lovely and refreshing. There's almost nowhere to stand,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PHASIC SUMP</span>
 The forest here is mucky and warm, surrounding a sinkhole filled with
 iridescent, gently glowing water. Some huge PIPES lead from here into
 the ground, and they drip with a similar strange water. There is a
 foul electric odor here, and your vision swims. You can feel your body
 being overtaken by weakness!

 You are weakening so quickly ... Your barbarian instinct is to get far

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in
 every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk
 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">BUSTLING PORT</span>
 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he
 may have spies anywhere! Fortunately, the crowd here at the docks is a
 varied, noisy mass of people and creatures from all corners of Vanth.
 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MARKETPLACE</span>
 This busy MARKETPLACE is the heart of the town, nestled against the
 mighty GATES of the CASTLE. You are careful to keep a low profile
 here, directly beneath the looming facade of the SLAVER KING'S own
 citadel.

 A lone GUARD stands watch before the GATES, staring ahead dutifully
 and ignoring the throng of the MARKETPLACE.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SEASHORE</span>
 An elderly LIGHTHOUSE is here (you could go IN), warning ships against
 the dangers of the rocky coastline. This stretch includes some soft
 sand as well as rocks ... a small beach looking out on the SEA OF
 GREAT PERIL. Over some bluffs to the immediate south, you can hear the
 sounds of the SLAVER KING'S harbor town. To the east are some pines.

 HARK! You hear a girlish SCREAM from the nearby PINE FOREST!

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PINE FOREST</span>
 This is a peaceful forest of tall pines, with a well-worn road leading
 west, toward the SEASHORE, and east.

 There is a SOLID GOLD STATUE here, gently shaded by the PINE TREES
 along the side of the road. The entire area is draped in gauzy,
 oversized WEBS of sticky translucence.

 The SLAVER KING maintains this plank-paved highway for the good of his

 Sa-ho! By Huron's fibrillating uvula, this is a party! Here in this

 camp, with drink and music and fighting galore! The center of
 attention seems to be a GLADIATOR'S RING.

 You see a nearby CHALLENGE POST, and a PARTY OF ROGUES stands by,
 engaged in revels and high jinks.

>examine post


 The CHALLENGE POST is a wooden pole hung with dyed banners, each
 representing a GLADIATOR willing to meet challengers. Beginning with
 the lowest, the banners are BLUE, GREEN, GOLD, and RED. There is room
 for one more banner above the others, but RED is presently the highest
 on the POST.

 A nearby rogue espies your curiosity, and sayeth "If ye wish a bout,

>seize green



 As you pluck the GREEN BANNER from the CHALLENGE POST, the assembled
 rowdies cheer! You are ushered into the gladiator's ring, where you
 stand face-to-face with the famed Klengon Criminal, THRANG! "Prepare
 for mighty battle, barbarian!" he shouts, and cracks an arrogant grin.

 You take a moment to REGARD your opponent ... THRANG is a

 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in
 every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk
 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

 You enjoy the cool moistness of the breeze on your skin.

 You turn the STINKY BAIT this way and that, considering its possible

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE</span>
 The snow on this mountain slope is all but undisturbed, and it glows a

 Demon-Gods.

 You hear a distant crackle, as if through the ELECTRIC ETHER, a

 There is a sharp smell of ozone, and a faint electric sizzling in the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TEMPLE</span>
 Your nostrils flare at the lingering smoke from incense, and at the
 strong scent of holy oils. The TEMPLE is ancient, cold and dark, with
 but dim shafts of smoky light from high windows. In the center of the
 room is an ALTAR, on which a SACRIFICE is being prepared.

 You can see the VIRAXIAN INCENSE, the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA and GINA THE
 VIRGIN SACRIFICE here.

>use eye on incense


 With a lick of flame from the decomposing eyeball, the incense takes

>use bait on sea


 The STINKY BAIT is truly foul, but sometimes a man just feels the urge
 to expose his skin, smear it with rotted bait, bare it to the ocean
 and see if anything interesting happens. It's how your parents met.

 For a few minutes, the only noticeable effect is a migration of all
 the seabirds, who head to the harbor where the stench is more
 civilized. But then there is a visible movement out at sea ... a
 rising darkness in the clear green waters which resolves itself to a
 speeding mountain of scaly flesh, an errant island of rippling water
 washing over green-black muscle and sudden, fire-bright yellow eyes.

 When the ENORMOUS SEA-MONSTER rises out of the water, you wonder for a
 moment how the ocean ever contained it. It's larger than the nearby
 city!

 And then it eats you.

 The floor is the squishy flesh of a monstrous gullet. The walls are

 flesh of a monstrous gullet ... and the DIGESTIVE JUICES are rising to
 consume you.

 You can see a HALF-DIGESTED CORPSE bobbing in the rising, sizzling
 acid - the remains of some old sailor, you suppose. On the CORPSE you
 notice the EYEPATCH OF ODIN and FLESH-TOTEM OF DARTH VIRAXIS.

 You can feel your flesh sizzling as the DIGESTIVE JUICES continue to

 It's definitely the smoke from the VIRAXIAN INCENSE! This beast cannot
 bear the irritation in its unholy bowels! You suppose that you, too,
 are something of a bowel irritant.

 Suddenly, you are squeezed tight by the constricting walls, and you
 feel you may be crushed to death and dissolved at the same time ...
 but then you are free, flying damply through the air, for a wet

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE

 points at you. "You see that man? Now that's a REAL pirate, not a
 scurvy old beggar like me. I want you to be just like 'im when you

>in

 The jolly PIRATES wave merrily as you head up the gangplank, happy to
 see such a fine PIRATE as yourself among their company.

 Aboard the vessel there are few signs of life, only a single
 peg-legged DWARF, swabbing the deck with a combination CRUTCH and MOP.
 You note with curiosity that the DWARF also wears a heavy coat of
 CHAINMAIL, and something in his bearing suggests that he was once a
 Warrior, like you (of perhaps half your Level).

 The DWARF pauses from his chores for a moment to greet you. "Avast ye,

 THRANG seemeth less swaggering, less arrogant, and more humbled than
 in the GLADIATOR PIT. "Hail to thee of might and valor," he says, with
 a slight grin forming behind his impressive mustache. He points to the
 GRAVESTONE before him, and to others nearby. "Long ago, before the
 SLAVER KINGS took these realms, and before the galaxy fell to ruin,
 there was a KLENGON colony here."

 You nod, respectfully. You have heard of this "galaxy."

 THRANG stands still awhile longer, lost in thought. "Those were days
 of blood and conquest. In truth, barbarian, many KLENGONS would be no
 better than this SLAVER KING of ours, or his neighbors. The KLENGONS
 were thwarted then, I have heard, by a man of SCIENCE ... and some of
 his work still rests in some of the old RUINS east of here. If you are
 of a mind to seek treasure, that might be a fine treasure to seek."

 You nod, considering this.

 THRANG offers a quick salute. "I have another errand I must see to ...
 a friend of mine, GUNWAR, is a PIRATE aboard the vessel currently at
 dockside. I should pay him a visit, the old dog. I think you two would
 get on well," he muses. "While he is a sailor now, he is in truth a
 Warrior, of perhaps half your Level. He quested for years, searching
 vainly for a BLACK HOLE METAL AXE ... and he lost his leg in the
 attempt. Visit him sometime, perhaps. You could swap stories and it
 would cheer him. He does so miss his days of battle, barbarian, as
 would you or I, were we maimed and unable to fight, eh?"

 You nod grimly. THRANG bows, then strides off toward the harbor,
 leaving you with your thoughts.

 meat, once sufficiently putrid, not only acts as an instant healer in
 battle, but also adds hair to one's chest, endowment to one's

 barbarian hair. Why, this particular SLAB is now so deliciously putrid

 The SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT shines in its raw ichor. Your tribe has

 SLUG - the largest you've ever seen - is basking its slimy bulk in the
 evening sun, right near the entrance. The SLUG makes no move toward
 you, but you'd have to ASSAIL it (and survive) to find out what lay
 beyond the arch.

 You can also see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DIZZYING CLIFFSIDE</span>
 This is the edge of a great cliff, looking over a vast CHASM to the
 south. The mists are so heavy within that you can barely detect a
 raging river far, far below.

 A tiny TREE clings tenaciously to the edge of the cliff.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PRISMATIC SPRAY</span>
 A high WATERFALL cascades down from a mountain ridge above, foaming
 and roaring into a broad POOL of clean water. The result is a
 brilliant PRISMATIC SPRAY. The setting is very peaceful.

 Swimming in the crystalline POOL is a MAGIC FISH. It appears to be
 reading a tiny book.

>use garter on fish


 The MAGIC FISH just swims deeper into the POOL, ignoring you.

>use garter on spray


 Your barbaric experience hasn't provided any useful way to use an
 ANGELGLASS GARTER with a WATERFALL, at least without a shaman to
 oversee the procedure.

>regard fish


 It's just your typical MAGIC FISH, playing around in the churning
 waters at the base of the WATERFALL.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PHASIC SUMP</span>
 The forest here is mucky and warm, surrounding a sinkhole filled with
 iridescent, gently glowing water. Some huge PIPES lead from here into
 the ground, and they drip with a similar strange water. There is a
 foul electric odor here, and your vision swims. You can feel your body
 being overtaken by weakness!

 You are weakening so quickly ... Your barbarian instinct is to get far
 from here ...

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in
 every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk
 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ABANDONED QUARRY</span>
 This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the
 east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the
 CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town.
 The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous
 and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT.

 Layers of frost and snow glitter on crags of ancient rock, and there

 beautiful CRYSTAL SPIRE, towering in the fading light, which you may
 ENTER.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE</span>
 The snow on this mountain slope is all but undisturbed, and it glows a
 rich orange in the light of the setting sun. You can see that sun, far
 to the west, sinking into the sea. Its rays touch also on an ornate
 structure: You may (if you dare) ENTER a black TEMPLE to the Viraxian
 Demon-Gods.

 You hear a distant crackle, as if through the ELECTRIC ETHER, a
 sizzling note of hate!

>go east


 No good path leads that way, and thou art not of the Pioneer class!

>enter



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TEMPLE</span>
 Your nostrils flare at the lingering smoke from incense, and at the
 strong scent of holy oils. The TEMPLE is ancient, cold and dark, with
 but dim shafts of smoky light from high windows. In the center of the
 room is an ALTAR, on which a SACRIFICE is being prepared.

 You can see the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA and GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE here.

 The ACOLYTE OF TRAGA chuckles quietly. "Barbarian, one does not make

 "BARBARIAN! YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE LAST OF MY ELECTRO-SPITE!"

 Dark clouds high above boom with laughter, and a flash of unnatural

 relief. There is a sudden darkness, and in a second flash, you know
 that you are not alone! A great and muscular VIRAXIAN HELL-SOLDIER

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FARMER'S GREEN</span>
 A humble WELL provides a centerpiece for this quiet place, surrounded
 by farmland providing food for the port town to the west. To the
 north, the shadow of the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE blots out part of the
 evening sky, but there's no path there from here.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">BUSTLING PORT</span>
 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he
 may have spies anywhere! Fortunately, the crowd here at the docks is a
 varied, noisy mass of people and creatures from all corners of Vanth.
 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come
 running.

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

 "Avast ye! Pirates only, barbarian matey!"

 "It's easy to tell when a man's no pirate," one buccaneer says,
 pretending not to be referring to you. "He's got no great big piratin'

 them boots."

>use eyepatch


 As you raise the EYEPATCH OF ODIN to your face, the GROUP OF PIRATES

 citadel.

 A lone GUARD stands watch before the GATES, staring ahead dutifully
 and ignoring the throng of the MARKETPLACE.

 You have heard that the god ODIN gained wisdom for losing his eye, but
 it feels more to you like losing some of your balance and gaining a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PIRATE SHIP</span>
 The ship is mostly deserted at the moment; the PIRATES are OUT on the
 quayside. The deck here is admirably stained with the blood of many a
 cutlass-duel, and littered with the usual ROPES and MASTS and nautical
 miscellany. Most of the hatches are securely locked, but you find one
 open passage leading downwards.

 GUNWAR the peg-legged DWARF is here, swabbing the deck.

>use axe on gunwar



 You extend the BLACK HOLE METAL AXE toward the old peg-leg DWARF, and
 he REGARDS it at first with polite interest, believing that you are
 simply showing it off to him. "Ah, yes, a very fine AXE you have
 there, barbarian ..."

 But when he realizes you are making an offer, he looks at the AXE
 again. "BLACK HOLE ... METAL!" he cries, and then he literally cries,
 taking it into his arms and sobbing a mess of tears onto his bristly
 black beard. "Lad, have ye any idea how many YEARS ... how many
 horrors I endured ... Was it THRANG? Did that foul old mustache of a
 KLENGON tell ye?"

 The old DWARF collects himself, obviously a bit embarrassed by his
 display of emotion, but you have sympathy. You, too, feel a great
 swelling of joy in your heart when you behold an implement of wanton
 destruction. It is as it must be, for you are a Warrior, and GUNWAR
 is, too (of perhaps half your Level).

 Satisfied that you have done a good deed, you turn to leave GUNWAR
 with the AXE for some privacy, but the DWARF doesn't let you go ...

 "Lad, please. Wait. I've something ... I think ... I think I've
 something to tell ye. To ... to show ye."

 The DWARF begins removing his clothing, and you quickly avert your
 eyes to let him know that this kind of thanking is not necessary.

 "No, lad. Look. Look."

 You peer between your fingers, and see what the DWARF is speaking of.
 Beneath his old coat of CHAINMAIL, beneath his jerkin, his chest is
 carved with a thousand old DWARVISH RUNES, seared into flesh with heat
 and blade. You read not these old letters, but you have heard they
 have powers of magic.

 GUNWAR smiles. "Lad, for years I was a Warrior, of perhaps half your
 Level, and I quested for a BLACK HOLE METAL AXE. It consumed my life,
 took some of me friends into the grave, and in a dungeon near the
 AMAZON FREEHOLD of RAKARR, it took me leg."

 You nod, grimly, in respect.

 "But lad, I didn't rest. I knew I could never be a Warrior of any real
 worth again, not with my movements so limited ... So I studied hard to
 one day SERVE a Warrior ... to become a companion to a worthy
 death-dealer of ... of perhaps twice my level. I studied to be a
 healer, son. I can heal you as fast as magic with my herbs! And," he
 says, pointing to the RUNES, "I had meself RUNE-CARVED, so that if the
 Warrior I serve may one day choose to wield me in his hand, I do
 double damage."

 There is silence for a while, broken only by the distant scream of
 gulls, and the damp sloshing of the waves on the hull of the PIRATE
 SHIP.

 The DWARF gets up his nerve and asks "Can I? Can we? <span class="floydstyle em">Will ye be my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Warrior, lad?</span> I'd be honored to be at your side, helping as I can
 with the bringin' of death once more. I feel it's my destiny as a
 healer."

 And a great friendship is made.

>seize dwarf


 You grab GUNWAR by the boots and try to heft him as a weapon, but he's

 "I guess not, lad," says GUNWAR, "but 'twas a good try!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in
 every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk
 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 You can also see a BLACK HOLE METAL AXE here.

 The forest here is mucky and warm, surrounding a sinkhole filled with
 iridescent, gently glowing water. Some huge PIPES lead from here into
 the ground, and they drip with a similar strange water. There is a
 foul electric odor here, and your vision swims. You can feel your body
 being overtaken by weakness!

 You are weakening so quickly ... Your barbarian instinct is to get far

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SCARRED FOREST</span>
 The remains of FALLEN TREES are here, overgrown with ferns and
 surrounding a half-buried shack of once-fine metal, draped with canvas
 and pocked with rust. You are wise in the ways of these: they are the
 "space-ships" that brought men from dark places in the sky, ere they
 fell.

 You notice a hatchway hanging open; you could ENTER if you so desired.
 This remnant of a ROCKET seems abandoned, apart from a tired-looking
 metallic figure slumped against its side ...

 You can see a ROBODROID here.

>use axe


 You hang the TWO-HANDED SWORD at your side, and grasp instead the
 BLACK HOLE METAL AXE, prepared for battle!

>regard axe


 The haft is made of a reddish iron with an alien-leather grip. The
 blade is almost utterly black and heavier than anything should be at
 that size. It hums, faintly, with a distant demonic hell-song. You
 have heard that many DEMONS dwell in the place where this metal is
 found.

 A tiny TREE clings tenaciously to the edge of the cliff.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it
 was, it now lies in ROCKY RUIN. Poking through the remnants, you
 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 Simply walking IN, however, isn't currently an option, as a vast RUIN
 SLUG - the largest you've ever seen - is basking its slimy bulk in the
 evening sun, right near the entrance. The SLUG makes no move toward
 you, but you'd have to ASSAIL it (and survive) to find out what lay

 with the rhythm of soft music.

 VESSA is here, sprawled across the bed and grinning at you,
 invitingly.

 "Oh, barbarian!" the lass coos, letting the GARTER flow and fall over
 her fingertips. "I so love ANGELGLASS! What a marvelous thing, to have
 the intimate apparel of the gods!" She looks you up and down, and
 quietly closes the boudoir door. "This will buy you many exotic
 pleasures ..."

 ... Many hours (and many exotic pleasures) later, VESSA THE DELICATE
 DOXY lay nearly naked beside you (save for the shimmering ANGELGLASS
 GARTER alighting the freckles of her right thigh) running her fingers
 through your coal-black hair. After a time, she speaks:

 "Barbarian, you may be pleased to know I have spread your legend ..."
 she smiles coyly. "Not of your man-prowess in bed - considerable
 though it is. I speak of your political acumen, your foundation of an
 UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT to ruin the SLAVER KING and his evil servants!"

 The DELICATE DOXY toys with a glittering RUBY NEEDLE set in her hair.
 "I do business with those of power and influence. One of the great
 WARLOCKS leading the rebellion against VIRAXIS gave me this, saying it
 has magic to pierce all, and that he longs to pierce my distant heart
 ... The love-struck dear! WARLOCKS are romantics, you know. It draws
 them to magic."

 You glower and nod, uncertain of what the girl is talking about.

 "I know many such clients ... and those who share your hatred of the
 SLAVER KING are ready to form a SPY NETWORK at your command. What say
 you?"

 You glower and nod, since it worked last time.

 Staring into your dark eyes, the DOXY sees all the answer she needs.
 "Yes ... you are lost in thought of dangerous quests throughout the
 realm. But I am in the perfect position to organize your espionage
 efforts! I will do so, brave slayer of foes ... young eagle, young
 hawk, young ruffle-breasted mountain starling!"

 "For a taste of what we might learn, I have a new secret already, from
 a CHEF who serves aboard the SLAVER KING'S pleasure-fleet ... There is
 a forgotten entrance to the SLAVE PENS under the CASTLE ... It's to
 the east of the citadel, a small CULVERT you must ENTER. Somewhere
 along an underground stream is a passage to where the SLAVES are kept,
 and ... " she pauses, tears clouding her eyes "and tortured. Like you
 would have been, had you not escaped bondage to lead us all to
 freedom."

 Since the girl is pleasing to you, you accept that sometimes she
 simply must chatter about things nobody understands. Seeing her
 sadness, you take her into the warm blankets, and comfort her in a
 manner you can both comprehend.

 Many hours (and etc) later, you emerge from the DOXY's chambers, sated
 and well-pleased, and scented with jasmine and feminine ardour.

 "Oh, yes, barbarian," says the DOXY, taking your proffered payment and
 barely REGARDING it. "This treasure will buy you a very special
 DEATH!"

 And with that, she rips aside her clothing in a more aggressive manner
 than is her DELICATE wont, revealing her nakedness, beautiful as ever,
 but now covered with a soft, almost translucent layer of fuzz,
 arranged in stripes of black and yellow!

 Horns sprout from her head and fire alights in her eyes, in the manner
 of a DEMON. She licks her lips, sensually, and you notice that her
 DELICATE tongue is now FORK-ED. She extends her nastily-clawed
 fingers, and in it appears a LASH OF PSIONIC DEMON SORCERY. A
 shimmering band of HELLFIRE whips out of nowhere, crisping the edges
 of some of the fine gauzy CURTAINS of the BOUDOIR. She cocks her hips
 alluringly and says "You will pay, barbarian, for trading a GLADIUS
 SWORD to the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA! He slew a dozen of my finest BEE GIRLS
 and three of my SUCCUBUS DEMON APPRENTICES in defense of his pathetic
 TEMPLE, and all because of you! I have captured your so-called
 "DELICATE DOXY," and after I have dined well on your BLOOD and SOUL, I
 will spend ALL NIGHT EATING HER! Stand fast, barbarian, and prepare to
 DIE at the cruel whim of the SUCCUBUS BEE GIRL WITCH QUEEN!"

 Relying on your barbarian cunning, you deduce that the DELICATE DOXY'S
 new ANTENNAE and STINGER might not be expressions of cosmetic whimsy
 after all, but may indicate that the DOXY herself has become
 dangerous.

 As if through a haze of psychic distortion, you can almost make out,
 at the edge of your vision, a girl who looks exactly like VESSA THE
 DELICATE DOXY, bound to the wall of the BOUDOIR and looking at you
 with lovely dark eyes, pleading for rescue.

 Perhaps that is the clue you need. But she certainly does cock her

 Five "action commands" are the heart of the barbarian's experience:
 <span class="floydstyle i">REGARD</span> (examine, consider), <span class="floydstyle i">SEIZE</span> (take into your
 possession), <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> (make use of in some way), <span class="floydstyle i">PARLEY</span> WITH
 (converse with peaceably), and <span class="floydstyle i">ASSAIL</span> (do violence upon). These
 are verbs to be followed by a noun: PARLEY WITH ALICE; SEIZE THE IDOL;
 USE THE BANANA. For greater complexity, the <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> command can
 combine two nouns: USE THE BRIBE WITH THE MAGISTRATE, USE THE DAGGER
 ON THE ROPE. <span class="floydstyle em">All success in the SLAVER KING'S realm depends on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">these action commands.</span>

 Type a direction (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, EXIT,
 ENTER) to travel. The proper command is <span class="floydstyle i">JOURNEY</span>, but direction
 alone will suffice. Other useful commands include: PILLAGE (seize
 everything at once), DISCARD (drop a thing), SHED (drop many things at
 once), and REPOSE (pause to heal or think great thoughts).

 Some important commands are for the player rather than the barbarian.
 These include SAVE and RESTORE to preserve and return to game-states
 between sessions, QUIT to abandon play, OFFICIAL, APPRENTICE and WIMP
 to adjust battle difficulty, and reference commands such as TABULATE,
 PROWESS, and SCORE. Other commands (and shortcuts) are also provided.
 Refer to your game manual.

 The SUCCUBUS BEE GIRL WITCH QUEEN is defeated!

 The haze of PSYCHIC CONFUSION fades immediately from your mind, and
 your keen barbarian instincts return in full! Looking now at the
 sensuous naked creature on the floor, you see her now for what she is
 ... a delectable, but thoroughly malevolent BEE GIRL.

 And not just any BEE GIRL, but a BEE GIRL QUEEN who is part SUCCUBUS
 DEMON. Those foes are most terrible that cannot be fought fairly, and
 this one clouded you with PSI POWERS and ASSAILED you with hell-born
 magic!

 You free the DELICATE DOXY from her bonds, and she kicks the remains
 of the BEE GIRL into a convenient chute hidden beneath a fur rug. You
 hear a distant splash. "It leads beneath the DOCKS to the SEA OF GREAT
 PERIL," she explains. "Some of my customers are MERMAIDS."

 You smile at the thought, and then frown, puzzling over the logistical
 complications. Then you shrug, for such matters are beyond the ken of
 an upland barbarian.

 VESSA smiles a very warm smile indeed. "Barbarian ... you came here on
 business. Shall we?"

 You pick up the LOST POEMS OF SUTOK from the bed where the demoness
 had tossed it, and offer it politely to the DELICATE DOXY.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 VESSA smiles a little when she sees you've offered a book ... then her
 eyes widen when she sees the title. She seems genuinely stunned.

 "Barbarian!" she says, clearly holding back tears. "SUTOK is the poet
 of every DOXY'S soul, and it was his verses that led me to my path. I
 have never been offered such sensitive payment. You truly do see me
 for who I am, and it moves me." She smiles a wicked, wanton smile.
 "You will be rewarded for your wisdom, barbarian, with my most
 inventive pleasures ..."

 ... Many hours (and many inventive pleasures, and a number of
 spontaneous recitations) later, VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY sprawls naked
 across your chest, quietly reading her new book, misty-eyed and dewy
 with satisfaction. After a time, she speaks:

 "That demonic BEE GIRL was no random encounter," the DOXY muses. "The
 BEE GIRLS of the mountains have become bolder of late, and I'm
 convinced that the SLAVER KING himself is encouraging them, to pacify
 the dissent at the edges of his realm." She rolls over, and smiles
 prettily ... "in fact, I know it for certain, because the SLAVER KING
 has become one of my clients, and he sleeps so very soundly when I'm
 finished with him that I've been able to see a few scrolls here and
 there ..."

 She sees the astonishment on your features and smiles, pleased with
 herself. "Oh, it's true that none outside the CASTLE have seen the
 SLAVER KING, and it remains so. He doesn't venture here to the DARK
 ALLEYWAY; I'm summoned to perform in the THRONE ROOM. And when His
 Majesty is sated, I wander, and I listen to the talk of servants, and
 I learn much."

 She lowers her voice cautiously, but her eyes are filled with happy
 mischief. "I've learned of a very secret treasure chamber beneath the
 central hall of the CASTLE ... a treasure that the SLAVER KING hides
 because he FEARS what it could do to him. I know not yet what this
 treasure is, but I do know that the fixtures of the CASTLE itself are
 they key to unlocking it: there is a combination, in FOUR stages ..."

 Her smile flickers and fades. "I know not the first two. But the
 second two I know: SEIZE the prized IVORY TAPESTRY, and then REGARD
 yourself in the MIRROR. This will open the way to the secret chamber.
 I hope to know more soon."

 She reaches into her hair. "In the meantime, barbarian, you have saved
 my life, and for that I owe you much that I cannot repay." She extends
 her hand to you, and in it lay the RUBY NEEDLE she showed you before.
 "The WARLOCK'S gift to me is now my gift to you, barbarian. I know not
 if the magic he spoke of is truth, but if it is magic, you should have
 it, to work your will against the SLAVER KING." She places it in your
 hand, and you tuck it idly into your THESKIAN DUFFLE BAG, which hangs
 at your side even when you are otherwise naked and occupied in lusty
 pursuits.

 The DOXY stretches out on the blankets, and looks at you over her
 shoulder. "Let me ply my trade with you some more, barbarian. For some
 time I have tasted the injustice of the SLAVER KING, and now that I
 have tasted ... well, now that I have witnessed his arrogant fury in
 person, I am eager for distractions from the memories, and eager for
 renewed enthusiasm for your certain victory."

 Many hours (and etc) later, you emerge from the DOXY'S chambers, sated
 and well-pleased, and scented with jasmine and feminine ardour.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DARK ALLEYWAY</span>
 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air
 and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another,
 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come

 Simply walking IN, however, isn't currently an option, as a vast RUIN
 SLUG - the largest you've ever seen - is basking its slimy bulk in the

 You can see a ROBODROID here.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN PLAIN</span>
 A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a blood-red
 sun. There are many paths. You see mountains to the distant east. You
 feel a manly twitching in your thews, enlivened by the freedom of the
 open country.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OLD STONE BRIDGE</span>
 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to
 the east, and disappearing into a small CULVERT leading IN at the base
 of a cliff. This cliff, and the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an
 icy shadow over the bridge. There is no path to the CASTLE from here,
 but the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROYAL ROAD</span>
 The SLAVER KING maintains this plank-paved highway for the good of his
 fat merchants, using slave labor. It is built on the backs of your
 people, and of any others his slave-catchers can beat into submission.
 Legend has it that a part of this road runs all the way distant to the
 UNKNOWN HIGHWAY! From here, however, it runs east to an ABANDONED
 QUARRY, and west into the pine-woods north of the CASTLE.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ABANDONED QUARRY</span>
 This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the
 east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the
 CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town.
 The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous
 and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEL PIT OF ROGUES</span>
 Sa-ho! By Huron's trancendental tumors, this is a party! Here in this
 GRAVEL PIT, a collection of rowdies and jackanapes have made an outlaw
 camp, with drink and music and fighting galore! The center of
 attention seems to be a GLADIATOR'S RING.

 You see a nearby CHALLENGE POST, and a PARTY OF ROGUES stands by,
 engaged in revels and high jinks.

>regard post


 The CHALLENGE POST is a wooden pole hung with dyed banners, each
 representing a GLADIATOR willing to meet challengers. Beginning with
 the lowest, the banners are BLUE, GREEN, GOLD, and RED. There is room
 for one more banner above the others, but RED is presently the highest
 on the POST.

 A nearby rogue espies your curiosity, and sayeth "If ye wish a bout,
 barbarian, SEIZE the banner of your chosen foe, to display your
 challenge!"

 As you pluck the GOLD BANNER from the CHALLENGE POST, the assembled
 rowdies cheer! You are ushered into the gladiator's ring, where you
 stand face-to-face with ... FOUL EMMA! "Barbarian may-un! PURTY!" she
 shouts, and lumbers toward you, ready for action!

 You take a moment to REGARD your opponent ... You have known many
 FRANKENSTEINS before and even called a few 'friend,' but FOUL EMMA is
 an especially disturbing (and obviously CAVE-PRIMITIVE) patchwork. She
 fights in the nude, thus displaying her notable variety of parts,
 including bits and pieces of WOOKY and some kinds of GIANT here and
 there. She wields a BASTARD SWORD as if it were weightless.

 "Ho there, barbarian," he says, his voice regal and measured. "I am
 pleased that I have finally met my match in the arena ... I had begun
 to fear that I would find nothing but boredom there, but you showed me
 the difference of that, eh?"

 He smiles in response to your grim nod. "Yes, and I have heard from a
 certain DELICATE friend near the harbor that you are more than a mere
 barbarian ... you are a great leader of a resistance, as well! Worry
 not my friend, your secret is safe among the GLADIATORS."

 He looks left and right, then leans in to whisper. "When the time
 comes, I will be there to aid you against the SLAVER KING, and I won't
 be the only one! But for now, I can teach you a special skill. In the
 first years of my exile, I took up residence with the SULDUKU
 HEIROPHANTS, an order secreted on an island in the SEA OF GREAT PERIL.
 They taught me - among other things - the secret of SULDUKU BREATHING,
 with which you can hold your breath far longer than any normal man.
 Someone would have to hold you underwater for HALF A THRAMOK to have
 any hopes of drowning you! Good, eh?"

 You consider this, and nod. And for a time, XAKANDA teaches you this

 Poetics and illogic! Your game manual, or the HELP command, might give

 The cold and gentle glow of the NECKLACE OF STARLIGHT dances across
 VESSA'S features, as if to highlight each freckle in turn. She looks
 you in the eyes with obvious delight. "I have never even heard of such
 a treasure," she says. "This will buy you my most DARING pleasures
 ..."

 ... Many hours (and many daring pleasures) later, VESSA THE DELICATE
 DOXY lay naked beside you, stretching and yawning pleasantly, and
 snuggling down into some of the fine PILLOWS on her bed, her eyes
 locked on yours, as if deep in thought. After a time, the DOXY speaks:

 "Barbarian, your spy network is truly magnificent ... the loyalty you
 have inspired, the HOPE you have brought to these people ... it is
 nothing short of miraculous." She snuggles closer, looking at you
 admiringly.

 You nod, passing the time by watching a nearby dust mote chase itself
 across the surface of the DOXY'S light-globes.

 "My performances in the THRONE ROOM have earned me new friends, and
 one of them may prove very valuable. The ROYAL PSI-WITCH, the
 wise-woman upon whom the SLAVER KING depends to read the minds of
 visiting nobles, has been feeding him lies and half-truths, for she is
 disgusted with what she sees within his own foul and selfish
 thoughts."

 The DOXY sits up on the bed, looking quite serious for a moment. "I
 mentioned you, and her eyes grew wide with wonder, barbarian. There
 is, it seems, some sort of PSI-WITCH prophecy ... She was coy with the
 details, explaining that she wants to lay eyes on you herself. You
 should not fear this woman, barbarian. She could make every difference
 in your machinations to realign the realm's administration for the
 common weal."

 You consider the DOXY'S words, and furrow your savage brow in mild
 discomfort, for there are many syllables.

 "Yes," VESSA says, "There is that look of solemn determination that
 excites me so about you!" she squirms close, pleasantly. Her hair
 smells nice. "You can summon the PSI-WITCH with a secret signal ... Go
 to the old LIGHTHOUSE and turn the LAMP'S reflector directly toward
 the battlements of the CASTLE, while shining your own LIGHT into it.
 You'll need a torch or something similar. Then, visit the LONELY HILL,
 where the ROYAL PSI-WITCH will be eager to examine you."

 Then the DOXY takes to examining you, herself, and pulls you back into
 the warm blankets with her, biting playfully at your shoulder.

 ... Many more hours (and etc) later, you emerge from the DOXY's
 chambers, sated and well-pleased, and scented with jasmine and
 feminine ardour.

 notice that, in the distance, a return signal flashes from one of the

 mighty GATES of the CASTLE. You are careful to keep a low profile
 here, directly beneath the looming facade of the SLAVER KING'S own
 citadel.

 A lone GUARD stands watch before the GATES, staring ahead dutifully
 and ignoring the throng of the MARKETPLACE.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">BUSTLING PORT</span>
 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he
 may have spies anywhere! Fortunately, the crowd here at the docks is a

 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come
 running.

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DARK ALLEYWAY</span>
 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air
 and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another,
 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEYARD</span>
 This dismal GRAVEYARD sits on a hill cloaked in mist, overlooking the
 SLAVER KING'S seedy SEAPORT to the north. There are hundreds of
 gravestones, some cracked with centuries of age, some quite new. There
 is a single large TOMB that a brave soul might choose to ENTER.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it
 was, it now lies in ROCKY RUIN. Poking through the remnants, you
 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 You can see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

 A humble WELL provides a centerpiece for this quiet place, surrounded

 evening sky, but there's no path there from here.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">LONELY HILL</span>
 Forest surrounds this hill on all sides, but there are no trees at the
 top - only grass and a few sad flowers, bending toward the setting
 sun. You see farmland to the north, and the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING
 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

 An ELDERLY WOMAN stands at the crest of the hill, her dry white hair
 fluttering delicately in the evening breeze. She REGARDS you with eyes
 like fire, and you can feel unbidden thoughts crawling inside your
 head.

>regard witch


 The ROYAL PSI-WITCH is a tiny, elderly woman with white hair and
 extraordinary eyes which cause you to feel dizzy. She seems to be

 "Bah," says the elderly PSI-WITCH, "thou art not ready at all. Begone,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SEASHORE</span>
 An elderly LIGHTHOUSE is here (you could go IN), warning ships against
 the dangers of the rocky coastline. This stretch includes some soft

 GREAT PERIL. Over some bluffs to the immediate south, you can hear the
 sounds of the SLAVER KING'S harbor town. To the east are some pines.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PIRATE SHIP</span>
 The ship is mostly deserted at the moment; the PIRATES are OUT on the
 quayside. The deck here is admirably stained with the blood of many a
 cutlass-duel, and littered with the usual ROPES and MASTS and nautical
 miscellany. Most of the hatches are securely locked, but you find one
 open passage leading downwards.

 GUNWAR the peg-legged DWARF is here, swabbing the deck.

>use axe on dwarf



 You extend the BLACK HOLE METAL AXE toward the old peg-leg DWARF, and
 he REGARDS it at first with polite interest, believing that you are
 simply showing it off to him. "Ah, yes, a very fine AXE you have
 there, barbarian ..."

 But when he realizes you are making an offer, he looks at the AXE
 again. "BLACK HOLE ... METAL!" he cries, and then he literally cries,
 taking it into his arms and sobbing a mess of tears onto his bristly
 black beard. "Lad, have ye any idea how many YEARS ... how many
 horrors I endured ... Was it THRANG? Did that foul old mustache of a
 KLENGON tell ye?"

 The old DWARF collects himself, obviously a bit embarrassed by his
 display of emotion, but you have sympathy. You, too, feel a great
 swelling of joy in your heart when you behold an implement of wanton
 destruction. It is as it must be, for you are a Warrior, and GUNWAR
 is, too (of perhaps half your Level).

 Satisfied that you have done a good deed, you turn to leave GUNWAR
 with the AXE for some privacy, but the DWARF doesn't let you go ...

 "Lad, please. Wait. I've something ... I think ... I think I've
 something to tell ye. To ... to show ye."

 The DWARF begins removing his clothing, and you quickly avert your
 eyes to let him know that this kind of thanking is not necessary.

 "No, lad. Look. Look."

 You peer between your fingers, and see what the DWARF is speaking of.
 Beneath his old coat of CHAINMAIL, beneath his jerkin, his chest is
 carved with a thousand old DWARVISH RUNES, seared into flesh with heat
 and blade. You read not these old letters, but you have heard they
 have powers of magic.

 GUNWAR smiles. "Lad, for years I was a Warrior, of perhaps half your
 Level, and I quested for a BLACK HOLE METAL AXE. It consumed my life,
 took some of me friends into the grave, and in a dungeon near the
 AMAZON FREEHOLD of RAKARR, it took me leg."

 You nod, grimly, in respect.

 "But lad, I didn't rest. I knew I could never be a Warrior of any real
 worth again, not with my movements so limited ... So I studied hard to
 one day SERVE a Warrior ... to become a companion to a worthy
 death-dealer of ... of perhaps twice my level. I studied to be a
 healer, son. I can heal you as fast as magic with my herbs! And," he
 says, pointing to the RUNES, "I had meself RUNE-CARVED, so that if the
 Warrior I serve may one day choose to wield me in his hand, I do
 double damage."

 There is silence for a while, broken only by the distant scream of
 gulls, and the damp sloshing of the waves on the hull of the PIRATE
 SHIP.

 The DWARF gets up his nerve and asks "Can I? Can we? <span class="floydstyle em">Will ye be my</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Warrior, lad?</span> I'd be honored to be at your side, helping as I can
 with the bringin' of death once more. I feel it's my destiny as a
 healer."

 And a great friendship is made.

 "Har," says GUNWAR, sniffing the air wafting from your DUFFEL. "I

 drinkin' mate o' mine ate himself some of that, all ripened up, and
 the <span class="floydstyle em">very next day</span> he had a third arm, stickin' out from his

>examine axe


 The haft is made of a reddish iron with an alien-leather grip. The
 blade is almost utterly black and heavier than anything should be at
 that size. It hums, faintly, with a distant demonic hell-song. You
 have heard that many DEMONS dwell in the place where this metal is
 found.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">BUSTLING PORT</span>
 Relying on the natural CUNNING of an upland barbarian, you sense
 something very wrong ...

 A MUTATED MORGOM is here, thirsty for BLOOD!

 The PIRATES are cringing in a corner, and the crowd has fled in a

 the MORGOM leaps through the air and sinks fangs into you!<span class="floydstyle em"> You</span>

 In the battle's aftermath, the PIRATES all rush to the scene, eager to
 make it look as if they were just about to enter the fight. GUNWAR
 chuckles and rolls his eyes at this.

 One old PIRATE steps forward and squints at the DWARF, and then at
 you. "Arr! Don't tell me ye'll be takin' GUNWAR aways from us fer
 good! Never was there a finer deck-swabber than old GUN, here."

 GUNWAR smiles. "I'll just be travelin' a bit here and there. Maybe for
 a short while, maybe a long one. Ye never know."

 "Ar," the old PIRATE agrees.

 Some of the other PIRATES shove the corpse of the MORGOM into the SEA.
 After the splash, one says to the other "Best to send that beastie to
 Davey Jones right away."

 "Aye," says the other. "Ye knows what happens to a MORGOM been slain
 by a TWO-HANDED SWORD!"

 "Well then, me Warrior!" GUNWAR says. "Let's be off adventurin'!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN PLAIN</span>
 A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a blood-red

 feel a manly twitching in your thews, enlivened by the freedom of the
 open country.

 GUN follows along, puffing on his pipe.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SCARRED FOREST</span>
 The remains of FALLEN TREES are here, overgrown with ferns and
 surrounding a half-buried shack of once-fine metal, draped with canvas
 and pocked with rust. You are wise in the ways of these: they are the
 "space-ships" that brought men from dark places in the sky, ere they
 fell.

 You notice a hatchway hanging open; you could ENTER if you so desired.
 This remnant of a ROCKET seems abandoned, apart from a tired-looking
 metallic figure slumped against its side ...

 You can see a ROBODROID here.

 GUNWAR follows along.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PHASIC SUMP</span>
 The forest here is mucky and warm, surrounding a sinkhole filled with
 iridescent, gently glowing water. Some huge PIPES lead from here into

 being overtaken by weakness!

 You are weakening so quickly ... Your barbarian instinct is to get far

 GUN accompanies you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PRISMATIC SPRAY</span>
 A high WATERFALL cascades down from a mountain ridge above, foaming
 and roaring into a broad POOL of clean water. The result is a
 brilliant PRISMATIC SPRAY. The setting is very peaceful.

 Swimming in the crystalline POOL is a MAGIC FISH, chasing glittering
 insects that hover near the water's surface.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF stays loyally at your side.

 GUNWAR chuckles as he peers into the POOL. "Some of the PIRATES like
 fishing for these MAGIC FISH. Good eatin' on 'em. Of course," he adds,
 "being PIRATES, they don't fish <span class="floydstyle em">fair.</span> I've seen some get fish

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in
 every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey murk
 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 GUNWAR follows just a few steps behind you.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

 GUNWAR totters along beside you.

 GUNWAR shifts on his peg-leg a bit. "I've heard so many tales about
 what the SLAVER KING really looks like, I don't know what to believe
 ... But one thing everyone seems to agree: he is a giant, and perhaps
 immortal. From goin' port to port, I know that the other SLAVER KINGS
 fear this one above all."

>use meat on bear


 You extend the SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT toward the GRIZZLY, and the
 great BEAR'S nose twitches damply as it looks up from the fresh
 flowing waters of the stream.

 Slowly, cautiously, the GRIZZLY approaches. He sniffs at the SLAB OF
 SNOW-SERPENT MEAT, motivated by obvious hunger, but grunts sadly, and
 returns to pawing the water in hopes.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FROSTED UPLANDS</span>
 Layers of frost and snow glitter on crags of ancient rock, and there
 are deep snowbanks to the north, approaching a BRIDGE made of pure

 ENTER.

 through the treetops. You can see a WINDING TRAIL leading south that
 would take you higher into the mountains.

 GUN follows you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">WINDING TRAIL</span>
 This pathway is steep, and you're currently at a point where great
 rocks blocks your view of the SLAVER KING'S realm. The rise is too
 steep to the east, but you can continue the trail to the south if you
 want to climb all the way to the PEAK OF MOUNT GELIDUS.

 GUNWAR sticks close, keeping an eye out for danger.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PEAK OF MOUNT GELIDUS</span>
 The view from the summit of MOUNT GELIDUS is enough to move even you,
 to give you a moment's peace from your savage thirst for vengeance.
 But only a moment. As you look down through the mists to the farms and
 forests stretching out to the SEA, the sight of the CASTLE of the
 SLAVER KING, framed in the distant sunset, reminds you of your
 purpose.

 An enormous CLIFF GIANT is sitting here, ninety tons of drowsy, rocky
 mass. Even his beard is made of stone. He's half-looking at the scenic
 vista, half-sleeping. When he snores, it sends minor slides of pebbles
 and loose snow bouncing down the mountainside. He rests in front of
 the entrance to a CAVE.

 GUNWAR limps along at your side.

 You recall what the DOXY told you about the RUBY NEEDLE ... the
 love-struck WARLOCK who gave her the NEEDLE said it could penetrate
 anything. Experimentally, you poke the CLIFF GIANT with the NEEDLE ...

 The CLIFF GIANT says something much like "MRRFT!" and turns to you in
 annoyance. Then he turns away again, and resumes his great repose.

>use needle on giant


 You poke the CLIFF GIANT once more with the RUBY NEEDLE, and this time
 the GIANT stands in response before you can take the NEEDLE out again!
 The CLIFF GIANT towers above you like a perturbed, angry mountain,
 blotting out the evening sun and GLARING at you!

 The GIANT points a finger at you. "YOU RUDE," he says, in a voice that
 sends pebbles and snow flying down the mountainside, and which nearly
 knocks you from your feet.

 And then, he strides off into the mountains, to find somewhere more
 private to sit.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">CAVE</span>
 The CAVE is damp, very dark, and smells strongly of the dead demons of
 the earth. There are other smells, too, for other wanderers have

 SLUICE of water rushes into the unseen belly of the mountain. But
 before you can begin to appreciate the secrets of the CAVE, there is a
 heavy thud, and a sudden motion in the dark ...

 A massive CAVE OOZE is here, and few men have survived the hunger of a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PEAK OF MOUNT GELIDUS</span>
 The view from the summit of MOUNT GELIDUS is enough to move even you,
 to give you a moment's peace from your savage thirst for vengeance.
 But only a moment. As you look down through the mists to the farms and
 forests stretching out to the SEA, the sight of the CASTLE of the
 SLAVER KING, framed in the distant sunset, reminds you of your
 purpose.

 The entrance to a forbidding CAVE is here, leading IN to the depths of

 GUN stays loyally at your side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">WINDING TRAIL</span>
 This pathway is steep, and you're currently at a point where great
 rocks blocks your view of the SLAVER KING'S realm. The rise is too
 steep to the east, but you can continue the trail to the south if you
 want to climb all the way to the PEAK OF MOUNT GELIDUS.

 You hear a distant crackle, as if through the ELECTRIC ETHER, a
 sizzling note of hate!

 GUNWAR follows along.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">WOODED FOOTHILLS</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">IDOL SWAMP</span>
 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in

 There is a large, MOSSY STONE IDOL here. Even half-sunken in the mire,
 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 GUNWAR trails along.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

 The VOLTAIC WRAITH arrives, crackling with HATE!

 GUNWAR stays loyally at your side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FROSTED UPLANDS</span>
 Layers of frost and snow glitter on crags of ancient rock, and there

 beautiful CRYSTAL SPIRE, towering in the fading light, which you may
 ENTER.

 GUNWAR follows you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE</span>
 The snow on this mountain slope is all but undisturbed, and it glows a
 rich orange in the light of the setting sun. You can see that sun, far
 to the west, sinking into the sea. Its rays touch also on an ornate
 structure: You may (if you dare) ENTER a black TEMPLE to the Viraxian
 Demon-Gods.

 GUNWAR limps along at your side.

 A soft breeze blows from the east.

>enter



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TEMPLE</span>
 Your nostrils flare at the lingering smoke from incense, and at the
 strong scent of holy oils. The TEMPLE is ancient, cold and dark, with
 but dim shafts of smoky light from high windows. In the center of the
 room is an ALTAR, on which a SACRIFICE is being prepared.

 You can see the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA and GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE here.

>parley with acolyte


 "Ah, barbarian!" the ACOLYTE smiles warmly, "It's always good to see
 you. Thank you again for the GLADIUS SWORD; it has already come in
 handy!"

 GUNWAR follows along, puffing on his pipe.

 GUNWAR smiles broadly at the sight GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE, strapped
 oiled and naked to the ALTAR. "Har! Good t'see ye, girly! Why, the
 last time I laid eyes on ye all trussed up, ye were knee-high to a
 MANION DEVIL and the lads were raidin' yer village! And now look at ye

 GINA blushes and shrugs shyly, at least to the extent her tethers
 allow. "But look at <span class="floydstyle em">you,</span> uncle GUN!" she says. "You're
 adventuring again! I knew you had it in you, you old sea-dog!"

 GUNWAR beams, and spends a few moments redistributing the ANOINTING
 OIL on the flat of GINA'S bare stomach, until the ACOLYTE raises an
 eyebrow at him.

 "Just makin' sure she's right set t'be devoured by yer DARK LORD!" he
 declares with an exaggerated wink. Everyone chuckles.

 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to
 the east, and disappearing into a small CULVERT leading IN at the base
 of a cliff. This cliff, and the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an
 icy shadow over the bridge. There is no path to the CASTLE from here,
 but the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

 You are a little surprised to notice a familiar figure - the hulking
 form of the SHE-FRANKENSTEIN called FOUL EMMA, tossing flower-petals
 off the BRIDGE into the STREAM below.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 FOUL EMMA looks up from her reverie. "Purty barbarian!" she says,
 obviously pleased to see you, but obviously too sad to grab at your
 backside. "Me glad you here, barbarian. Maybe one day you can help
 EMMA."

 She plucks another petal and lets it fall. "Me not know where, but
 some-wheres here there's a secret ... a way IN to where slaves are
 kept. SLAVER KING, him mean. He keep many FRANKENSTEIN slaves. He keep
 EMMA'S momma and EMMA'S daddy as slaves. Only EMMA get away." She
 stares up at the sky, holding back patchwork tears.

 She looks into your eyes. "Me heard another secret, too. There's a
 CORD somewheres there, black as night. So old only a few old slaves
 know. Pull on that CORD," she says, "and it open a way to crawl right
 into CASTLE, right where SLAVER KING live. But me too big to crawl,
 anyway. So me no help to momma. No help to paw-paw." She turns away,
 embarassed by her grief. After a while, she collects herself, and
 half-heartedly gropes at your groin, but it's plainly her way of
 putting on a brave face, and she turns to walk away.

 once more and calls back "Me feel better when fighting, barbarian.
 Please come fight me some more. Me ... like you. You purty." Blushing,
 she turns and runs into the distance, like a bashful little girl,
 crushing rocks with her footfalls.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SLAVE PENS (ON CATWALK)</span>
 As the DOXY foretold, deep into the CULVERT there is a stone platform,
 and a ladderwell leading into a vast underground chamber ... a chamber
 of torture and woe! For here, from a high CATWALK, strewn with
 discarded metal junk, you can see hundreds of the SLAVER KING'S
 captured workers: Humans, Vulkins, Frankensteins, Robodroids and more!

 Some are shattering rocks with hammers, some are providing motive
 power for large wooden wheels, some are being whipped or burned by the
 many burly GUARDS. You cannot be seen from your current vantage point,
 but if you were to venture into the PENS you would once again be a
 slave, yourself.

 Just as FOUL EMMA said, there is a BLACK CORD hanging deep in the
 shadows at the far end of the CATWALK, barely visible in the darkness
 and clutter.

 Recalling the words of the ROBODROID, you notice a discarded LENGTH OF

 You hold the CABLING near the ROBODROID, turn it this way and that,
 tap him gently on the head with it, and so on ...

 You are almost ready to give up hope that anything might happen, when
 the cabling suddenly SPARKS with some latent remaining energy, and
 with heavy CLANK attaches itself to a portion of the metal man's
 silvery skin. The lights on his flat display-face shine brightly, and
 there is a deep humming ... but both the lights and the sound
 immediately begin to fade ...

 The ROBODROID turns to face you and speaks clearly. "Friend! Thank
 you! Power levels critical. I have very little time. My sensors detect
 PHASIC EMANATIONS very near. Take the CABLE there, hold it very still
 above the source. Source. Auto-MATIC! Source. POWwwer. Hold.

 You hold the BIPHASIC CABLING very still above the waters of the SUMP,

 But it takes only a moment to see that the ROBODROID was correct! One
 end of the CABLE leaps from your hand like a living thing, diving into
 the water and extending sharp metallic tendrils. After a moment, the

 With the cable in place in the PHASIC SUMP, the rest happens without
 much effort. The Phasic Power Conduit Class 84-900-000-5 must be
 enchanted in some way to know its purpose, for just as it leaped for
 the glowing water, it leaps for the ROBODROID, clamping loudly on his
 surface and then flashing with pure blue light!

 It's impossible, for a few moments, to unhand the cable! You can feel
 the energies flowing through YOU as well as through it, and you can't
 help but wonder if that's really safe.

 Then, all is calm, and you let the CABLE go, rubbing your hand where
 the heat of the transfer burned you slightly. The ROBODROID does not
 stand, but his head swivels freely, and you can see some of his torn
 and rusted portions ... healing themselves.

 "Repair. Sequence. Initiated. Magnetic. Data. Accessed." The ROBDROID
 jerks slightly on the ground, then relaxes, and turns to face you.
 "Friend!" he says, his face-lights arranging into a simple smile.

 You nod, quietly. You've known his kind before, and they are often
 good folk, but it's never quite normal, talking to metal.

 He nods in return. "Thank you, barbarian, for your help. I have been
 trapped here for so long, unable to self-repair without access to
 PHASIC EMANATIONS. I dwelt here in the remnants of my ROCKET, as a
 ROBO-HERMIT, but the SLAVER KING decided that all ROBODROIDS should
 serve him ..."

 His face-lights flash an angry red. "I refused, and fought to the last
 ... or what his thugs must have supposed was the last. As you can see,
 there is life yet in my COSMIC TRANSISTORS, eh?"

 He tries to move, but stumbles. "Ah, but not a LOT of life ... this
 cable will allow me to communicate and perform some basic self-repair,

 The remains of FALLEN TREES are here, overgrown with ferns and

 The ROBODROID nods politely in your direction. "I'm sorry I'm not much

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">LONELY HILL</span>
 Forest surrounds this hill on all sides, but there are no trees at the
 top - only grass and a few sad flowers, bending toward the setting
 sun. You see farmland to the north, and the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING
 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

 An ELDERLY WOMAN stands at the crest of the hill, her dry white hair
 fluttering delicately in the evening breeze. She REGARDS you with eyes

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FARMER'S GREEN</span>

 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he

 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come
 running.

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DARK ALLEYWAY</span>
 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air

 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

 You hear a distant crackle, as if through the ELECTRIC ETHER, a
 sizzling note of hate!

 GUNWAR limps along at your side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEYARD</span>
 This dismal GRAVEYARD sits on a hill cloaked in mist, overlooking the

 The VOLTAIC WRAITH arrives, crackling with HATE!


 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>


 With the VOLTAIC WRAITH arcing violently from branch to branch and
 hissing with anger, you stand in the clearing of the SCARRED FOREST,
 and whirl to face your opponent. Nearby, the ROBODROID looks up from
 his repair-work with obvious curiosity.

 "BARBARIAN!" screams the WRAITH, forming a scowling face made of
 translucent arcs of power, "SUCH A LOVELY SETTING IN WHICH TO DESTROY
 YOU ... SO MANY DAMP FLOWERS ... MOIST BARK, HUMID AIR ... SO MANY WET
 PLACES TO CHASE YOU FROM, TO TRAP YOU. WHY, THERE'S EVEN METAL HERE!"

 Edging back toward the ROBODROID and smiling quietly, you simply nod.

 The VOLTAIC WRAITH advances, and then begins to flicker. "WHAT?
 WHAT?!? WHAT'S HAPPENING" Trails of power are now arcing at random
 from the center of the WRAITH to the surface of the BIPHASIC CABLING.
 The BLUE END attached to the ROBODROID begins loudly humming.

 The ROBODROID stands, and smiles. "Oh, barbarian. You are very, very
 clever, for a primitive meatling." With newfound strength, the
 ROBODROID un-clamps the BLUE END of the CABLE and points it directly
 at the WRAITH.

 You nod grimly, and inhale the storm-fresh air as you are surrounded
 by a rush of VOLTAIC DISASSEMBLY amid the sound of a thousand gasping
 echoes, of a hundred pitiful screams, a dozen mournful wails, and then
 thin, faint, static.

 The VOLTAIC WRAITH is no more, and the ROBODROID stands tall, his
 remaining "wounds" repairing themselves instantly before your eyes,
 his skin a perfect, gleaming silver.

 "A very clever meatling, indeed," he says. "The SLAVER KING is in
 trouble, with a barbarian seeking vengeance on him!"

 You nod, for you are well pleased.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VAULT</span>
 What a strange place! The walls are made of stone braced with a dull
 blue metal, and there are piles of humming MACHINERY here, all
 centered on a GLOWING PEDESTAL.

 Surrounding the pedestal is a glowing CAGE of static energy ... No
 doubt this is a FARADAY CAGE, a prison designed in ancient times to
 trap powerful ROBODROIDS for servitude.

 Sitting on the pedestal is the AMULET of SCIENCE.

 GUNWAR trails along.

 GUNWAR peers closely at the FARADAY CAGE. "Har," he says, quietly.
 "Bugger me with a marlinspike, these blackguard FARADAY CAGES are
 nasty business. Lost a good mechanical friend to one of these, once.
 Fortunately, they can be taken down with the right kind of good, hard
 whack. You're a strong lad, barbarian. ASSAIL this scurvy CAGE."

>assail cage


 You lash out with your TWO-HANDED SWORD, barely making a dent in the
 FARADAY CAGE ... a dent which reshapes itself into defiant perfection
 within seconds after your attack!

 GUNWAR hefts his BLACK HOLE METAL AXE experimentally, all the while
 carefully regarding the FARADAY CAGE.

 "Give it another go, lad. Just one more good whack, and I can watch ye
 carefully."

>assail cage

 GUNWAR steps forward, the BLACK HOLE METAL AXE glinting in the strange
 lights of the VAULT. "Stand back, lad. I'll set this right."

 Heaving the demonic AXE with all his might, GUNWAR drives the eldritch
 blade hard into the side of the FARADAY CAGE. When a sudden VIBRATORY
 FEEDBACK WAVE threatens to shatter the AXE in return, you are tossed
 from your feet, but GUNWAR quickly clangs the AXE on the strange
 blue-metal walls with a smile. "HAHA!" he cries, "I've tussled with
 FARADAY FORCES in my time, eh? Can't mess with old GUNWAR! Har."

 When you dare openeth your eyes again, you see that the VAULT is
 dimmed, idle sparks fly from broken machinery ... and the FARADAY CAGE
 is gone, no doubt banished to whatever ELECTRO-HELL it was summoned
 from! GUNWAR stands triumphantly, the gleaming BLACK HOLE METAL AXE
 reflected in his eyes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DIZZYING CLIFFSIDE</span>
 This is the edge of a great cliff, looking over a vast CHASM to the
 south. The mists are so heavy within that you can barely detect a
 raging river far, far below.

 GUNWAR stands nearby, smiling contentedly.

 A tiny TREE clings tenaciously to the edge of the cliff.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it
 was, it now lies in ROCKY RUIN. Poking through the remnants, you
 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 You can see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

 GUN totters along beside you.

>seize pole


 You lack the strength of arm to heft such a mighty thing!

 You see a band of travelers in the distance, but then they're gone.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEYARD</span>
 This dismal GRAVEYARD sits on a hill cloaked in mist, overlooking the
 SLAVER KING'S seedy SEAPORT to the north. There are hundreds of
 gravestones, some cracked with centuries of age, some quite new. There
 is a single large TOMB that a brave soul might choose to ENTER.

 GUNWAR limps along at your side.



 Perplexity and disarray! Your game manual, or the HELP command, might
 give aid and succor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DARK ALLEYWAY</span>
 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air
 and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another,
 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF stays loyally at your side.

>in


 GUNWAR says, "I'd best wait here, lad. Three's a crowd in with a fine
 DOXY, at least until we know each other better."

 You notice a slight chain hanging across VESSA'S doorway, and a small
 sign writ in simple runes which sayeth: BACK SOON - PROVIDING SERVICE
 TO HIS MAJESTY'S COURT AND SUNDRIES.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">BUSTLING PORT</span>
 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he
 may have spies anywhere! Fortunately, the crowd here at the docks is a
 varied, noisy mass of people and creatures from all corners of Vanth.
 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come
 running.

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

 GUNWAR sticks close, keeping an eye out for danger.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FARMER'S GREEN</span>
 A humble WELL provides a centerpiece for this quiet place, surrounded
 by farmland providing food for the port town to the west. To the
 north, the shadow of the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE blots out part of the
 evening sky, but there's no path there from here.

 GUN follows along.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN PLAIN</span>
 A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a blood-red
 sun. There are many paths. You see mountains to the distant east. You
 feel a manly twitching in your thews, enlivened by the freedom of the
 open country.

 GUNWAR follows just a few steps behind you.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OLD STONE BRIDGE</span>
 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to
 the east, and disappearing into a small CULVERT leading IN at the base
 of a cliff. This cliff, and the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an
 icy shadow over the bridge. There is no path to the CASTLE from here,
 but the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF limps along at your side.

>enter culvert


 GUNWAR says, "I'd never be able to swim in there with me peg-leg, but
 I'll try to find another way in to meet ye."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SLAVE PENS (ON CATWALK)</span>
 As the DOXY foretold, deep into the CULVERT there is a stone platform,
 and a ladderwell leading into a vast underground chamber ... a chamber
 of torture and woe! For here, from a high CATWALK, strewn with
 discarded metal junk, you can see hundreds of the SLAVER KING'S
 captured workers: Humans, Vulkins, Frankensteins, Robodroids and more!

 Some are shattering rocks with hammers, some are providing motive
 power for large wooden wheels, some are being whipped or burned by the
 many burly GUARDS. You cannot be seen from your current vantage point,
 but if you were to venture into the PENS you would once again be a
 slave, yourself.

 The path to the surface leads UP, but a CRAWLWAY beckons further IN
 from here, barely visible in the shadows.

>in

 You crawl through the dark for a while, but it isn't long before you
 emerge into the CASTLE above.

 ... There is a gentle SNAP as the tiny door you emerged from falls
 shut behind you; there's no sign of it now! You'll have to find
 another way out.

 So, you take stock of your surroundings ... and such surroundings! You
 stand in a central hall of the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, a chamber
 well-bedecked with opulence and many fine FURNISHINGS. Looking far,
 far to the west, you can see that the GUARDS are letting some
 well-dressed courtiers wander out into the MARKETPLACE without
 hindrance. It seems getting out is easier than getting in! You slick
 your hair a bit, convinced that you can pass for a courtier if the
 need is dire.

 Your attention is drawn by a slight hint of movement: atop a great
 HEARTH filled with a ROARING FIRE, a COPPER GARGOYLE is perched, and
 you could have sworn you saw it move.

 You REGARD the statue for a time, your instincts telling you to ready
 yourself for BATTLE!

 And it's only a moment for your instincts to be proven true, as the
 COPPER GARGOYLE grins a creaking, metallic grin, and snaps his claws
 open, and leaps down to the floor ...

 might, and climbs back on its perch above the HEARTH, freezing in
 place.

 Looking around, it seems as though nobody noticed the battle! You idly

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">CASTLE</span>
 You stand in a central hall of the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING,

 people moving in the distance, but this place is so huge that your own
 arrival seems to have gone unnoticed by the non-GARGOYLE denizens.
 Just to be sure, you stick to the shadows (fortunately, there are

 GUNWAR follows along, puffing on his pipe.

 you have a recent SAVE to return to, should things not go as you wish.

 "And I for one," GUNWAR adds, "feel a great unease in my bones. I've

 DWARVES on sight! On sight! Perhaps if you could wield me, lad ... I
 might feel less nervous going in as your armament than as your

 This great hall is well-bedecked with opulence - your barbarian senses

 however, including the great MARBLE STAIRS leading upward to the
 THRONE ROOM, the long TRESTLES on which feasts are laid, the
 IMPRESSIVE HEARTH providing a ROARING FIRE, two huge TAPESTRIES (one
 BURGUNDY and one IVORY), a GIGANTIC MIRROR on the wall and, perched
 immobile above the HEARTH, the very COPPER GARGOYLE which accosted you
 when first you came here!

>regard ivory tapestry


 With threads of silver, the great IVORY TAPESTRY shows images of
 slaves being whipped and forced to build the castle. The image is
 greatly romanticized, to the extent that such a thing is possible.

 Five "action commands" are the heart of the barbarian's experience:
 <span class="floydstyle i">REGARD</span> (examine, consider), <span class="floydstyle i">SEIZE</span> (take into your
 possession), <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> (make use of in some way), <span class="floydstyle i">PARLEY</span> WITH
 (converse with peaceably), and <span class="floydstyle i">ASSAIL</span> (do violence upon). These
 are verbs to be followed by a noun: PARLEY WITH ALICE; SEIZE THE IDOL;
 USE THE BANANA. For greater complexity, the <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> command can
 combine two nouns: USE THE BRIBE WITH THE MAGISTRATE, USE THE DAGGER
 ON THE ROPE. <span class="floydstyle em">All success in the SLAVER KING'S realm depends on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">these action commands.</span>

 Type a direction (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, EXIT,
 ENTER) to travel. The proper command is <span class="floydstyle i">JOURNEY</span>, but direction
 alone will suffice. Other useful commands include: PILLAGE (seize
 everything at once), DISCARD (drop a thing), SHED (drop many things at
 once), and REPOSE (pause to heal or think great thoughts).

 Some important commands are for the player rather than the barbarian.
 These include SAVE and RESTORE to preserve and return to game-states
 between sessions, QUIT to abandon play, OFFICIAL, APPRENTICE and WIMP
 to adjust battle difficulty, and reference commands such as TABULATE,
 PROWESS, and SCORE. Other commands (and shortcuts) are also provided.
 Refer to your game manual.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>
 Cracked remnants of walls and a stretch of weed-grown cobblestones
 tell of an old temple or abbey ... perhaps even a village. Whatever it

 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 You can see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

 GUNWAR sticks close, keeping an eye out for danger.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VAULT</span>
 What a strange place! The walls are made of stone braced with a dull
 blue metal, and there are piles of humming MACHINERY here, all
 centered on a GLOWING PEDESTAL.

 Sitting on the pedestal is the AMULET of SCIENCE.

 GUN stays loyally at your side.

>regard amulet


 Hung from a chain that it might be worn, it is as the fables tell: an
 AMULET fashioned of finest SCIENCE.

>seize amulet


 Your hand passes right through the AMULET, as if it were but a
 SPECTERAL SPIRIT. And yet, the AMULET doth respond, with a display of
 corscuating light.

 "Har. Don't that beat all?" sayeth GUNWAR.

>regard pedestal


 The MACHINERY gloweth, and culminateth in the GLOWING PEDESTAL.
 Indeed, 'tis all of one strange piece.

>smite pedestal


 This computeth not. Seek guidance with the HELP command.

>hit pedestal


 Thy savage might and lust for vengeance could be put to better use
 than that, barbarian.

>parley with gun


 GUNWAR spins an unlikely yarn about his days as a cavalryman.

>regard walls


 You feel suffocated just considering it ... you long for the outdoors,
 where a Warrior-born can run free and naked on the wild soil,
 unfettered by walls and ceilings, with his THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG
 fluttering in the fresh breezes.

>regard metal


 The haft is made of a reddish iron with an alien-leather grip. The
 blade is almost utterly black and heavier than anything should be at
 that size. It hums, faintly, with a distant demonic hell-song. You
 have heard that many DEMONS dwell in the place where this metal is
 found.

>eat meat


 Striveth for wisdom in thine commands, barbarian. Refer to your game
 manual for assistance.

>use meat


 Holding your breath to stave off the rich odor, you cram the putrefied
 SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT down your throat, and then bite hard on your
 tongue to fight the urge to vomit. Sure enough, only moments later,
 the PRISMATIC MAGIC of the meat's ichor permeates your muscles,
 healing you!

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">VAULT</span>
 [Time retreats before thee.]

>inventory


 You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty
 THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG): a SUIT OF IMPERVIUM PLATE-MAIL ARMOR (being
 worn), some SPICES, a SUIT OF KLENGON MAIL (currently un-used), a
 DELICATELY-OILED CLOTH, a SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT, a TWO-HANDED
 SWORD (held at the ready), an EAR OF CORN, a SUIT OF CHAINMAIL ARMOR
 (currently un-used), a SUIT OF BURLAP ARMOR (currently un-used) and a
 FLASHLIGHT.

>regard slab


 The SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT shines in its raw ichor. Your tribe has
 long known that the flesh of this beast, once properly ripened and
 then consumed rapidly, has magic healing properties that allow
 Warriors to defeat foes much more powerful than they. Useful, for a
 Warrior-born such as you! This slab has now ripened; the ichor swirls
 with prismatic power and the stench is comforting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PRISMATIC SPRAY</span>
 A high WATERFALL cascades down from a mountain ridge above, foaming
 and roaring into a broad POOL of clean water. The result is a
 brilliant PRISMATIC SPRAY. The setting is very peaceful.

 Swimming in the crystalline POOL is a MAGIC FISH, swimming a lazy
 figure-eight.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF trails along.

>use meat on fish


 The MAGIC FISH just swims deeper into the POOL, ignoring you.

>use meat on pool


 The SLAB OF SNOW-SERPENT MEAT and the POOL don't mesh in any useful
 way, despite your very fiercest battle-cry in the attempt.

 FLASHLIGHT.

 The warm breeze takes on a slight chill, as the evening wears on.

>use spices on pool


 You've heard tales of how HURON, the GOD OF BEING A VERY MIGHTY GOD,
 once used some SPICES with a POOL to defeat a thousand enemy kings!
 Now that you think of it, though, the tale seemed to gloss right past
 the critical details.

>use corn on fish


 The MAGIC FISH just swims deeper into the POOL, ignoring you.

>swim


 Thou art a barbarian, 'tis true, but even thou canst masterest wise
 use of the ACTION COMMANDS. Your game manual, or the HELP command,
 might give aid and succor.

>enter pool


 Thou hast always regarded bathing as one of those things that happens

 If you were the sort to bathe, this is the sort of pool you'd enjoy
 bathing in.

>bathe


 You speak madness, barbarian! Seek guidance with the HELP command.

>use pool


 Thou hast always regarded bathing as one of those things that happens

>use spices


 Nothing useful happens, and the SPICES seem to mock you with
 condescending silence. You come to hate the SPICES, and vow vengeance
 upon them, just as soon as you are finished with the SLAVER KING.

>regard spices


 It is a tiny container of SPICES that smelleth like a HOBLING bakery
 making PUMPKIN PIES.



 The MAGIC FISH just swims deeper into the POOL, ignoring you.

>prowess


 You wield the TWO-HANDED SWORD. Adjusting for your abilities and
 progress, you do from 13 to 23 points of damage with each successful
 blow. Your odds of striking true are 90% (burdened somewhat by your
 load). Your armor is the SUIT OF IMPERVIUM PLATE-MAIL ARMOR, which
 increases your Hit Points by 245%. You are versed in the useful lore
 of SULDUKU BREATHING. You are uninjured, with your full complement of
 307 Hit Points. A mighty Warrior, indeed!

 You lack the strength of arm to heft such a mighty thing!

 You while away some time with GUNWAR, talking of battles and
 campaigns, and of the thrill of surviving when all about you is death.



 You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty

 The TELEPHONE POLE seems quite sturdy, and its runes name it "BELL
 SYSTEMS OF DETROIT." A potent blessing of magic, no doubt.



 You lack the strength of arm to heft such a mighty thing!

>assail pole


 The TELEPHONE POLE is not your foe, barbarian.



 Thou art only accustomed to ASSAILING things with a TWO-HANDED SWORD,
 preferably in a frothing, bloody rage filled with lusty war-oaths,
 suggestive hip-thrusts and savage leering.

>help



 Five "action commands" are the heart of the barbarian's experience:
 <span class="floydstyle i">REGARD</span> (examine, consider), <span class="floydstyle i">SEIZE</span> (take into your
 possession), <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> (make use of in some way), <span class="floydstyle i">PARLEY</span> WITH
 (converse with peaceably), and <span class="floydstyle i">ASSAIL</span> (do violence upon). These
 are verbs to be followed by a noun: PARLEY WITH ALICE; SEIZE THE IDOL;
 USE THE BANANA. For greater complexity, the <span class="floydstyle i">USE</span> command can
 combine two nouns: USE THE BRIBE WITH THE MAGISTRATE, USE THE DAGGER
 ON THE ROPE. <span class="floydstyle em">All success in the SLAVER KING'S realm depends on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">these action commands.</span>

 Type a direction (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, EXIT,
 ENTER) to travel. The proper command is <span class="floydstyle i">JOURNEY</span>, but direction
 alone will suffice. Other useful commands include: PILLAGE (seize
 everything at once), DISCARD (drop a thing), SHED (drop many things at
 once), and REPOSE (pause to heal or think great thoughts).

 Some important commands are for the player rather than the barbarian.
 These include SAVE and RESTORE to preserve and return to game-states
 between sessions, QUIT to abandon play, OFFICIAL, APPRENTICE and WIMP
 to adjust battle difficulty, and reference commands such as TABULATE,
 PROWESS, and SCORE. Other commands (and shortcuts) are also provided.
 Refer to your game manual.



 You try a number of things, including glaring at the TELEPHONE POLE
 while flexing your left thigh muscle at the EAR OF CORN. I'd be
 stretching the truth if I said the results are useful.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">LONELY HILL</span>
 Forest surrounds this hill on all sides, but there are no trees at the
 top - only grass and a few sad flowers, bending toward the setting
 sun. You see farmland to the north, and the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING
 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

 An ELDERLY WOMAN stands at the crest of the hill, her dry white hair
 fluttering delicately in the evening breeze. She REGARDS you with eyes
 like fire, and you can feel unbidden thoughts crawling inside your
 head.

 GUNWAR follows you.

>regard woman


 The ROYAL PSI-WITCH is a tiny, elderly woman with white hair and
 extraordinary eyes which cause you to feel dizzy. She seems to be
 looking right through you.

>parley with woman


 "Greetings, upland barbarian," she says. She lets her words trail off,
 as if she's waiting for you to do something ...

>assail woman


 The ROYAL PSI-WITCH arches an eyebrow as you try, and your brain feels
 like it's being invaded by a thousand SARTHIAN FROST ANTS.

 "Bah," says the elderly PSI-WITCH, "thou art not ready at all. Begone,
 barbarian." You feel your mind invaded by scientific waves of THOUGHT
 ENERGY, and you feel your feet wandering, your eyes closing, your
 thoughts dissolving ...

 ... It is some time later when your senses clear.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PINE FOREST</span>
 This is a peaceful forest of tall pines, with a well-worn road leading
 west, toward the SEASHORE, and east.

 There is a SOLID GOLD STATUE here, gently shaded by the PINE TREES
 along the side of the road. The entire area is draped in gauzy,
 oversized WEBS of sticky translucence.

>seize statue


 It is said that not even HURON, the GOD OF BEING A VERY MIGHTY GOD,
 could lift a SOLID GOLD STATUE. Of course, as you recall, the SOLID
 GOLD STATUE that HURON tried to lift was "taller than ten tall
 mountains and draped with a coat made of seven roaring seas," but
 adjusting for scale, you face a similar dilemma.

>regard statue


 It is a very alluring statue of a comely ELF wench, slight but womany.
 Ah, but not just ANY comely ELF wench! This is the girl who robbed you
 of your prize when first you met the VOLTAIC WRAITH in that
 crystalline tower in the FROSTED UPLANDS!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROYAL ROAD</span>
 The SLAVER KING maintains this plank-paved highway for the good of his
 fat merchants, using slave labor. It is built on the backs of your
 people, and of any others his slave-catchers can beat into submission.
 Legend has it that a part of this road runs all the way distant to the
 UNKNOWN HIGHWAY! From here, however, it runs east to an ABANDONED
 QUARRY, and west into the pine-woods north of the CASTLE.

 GUN is here, looking very happy to be adventuring again.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ABANDONED QUARRY</span>
 This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the
 east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the
 CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town.
 The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous
 and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT.

 GUNWAR follows just a few steps behind you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEL PIT OF ROGUES</span>
 Sa-ho! By Huron's subcutaneous heat organ, this is a party! Here in
 this GRAVEL PIT, a collection of rowdies and jackanapes have made an
 outlaw camp, with drink and music and fighting galore! The center of
 attention seems to be a GLADIATOR'S RING.

 Your barbarian senses detect something ... different ... in the GRAVEL
 PIT. A heightened tension.

 You see a nearby CHALLENGE POST, and a PARTY OF ROGUES stands by,
 engaged in revels and high jinks.

 All eyes are on you as you arrive, and one lowly ROGUE lifts a hand,
 meekly, to point at the CHALLENGE POST.

>regard post


 The CHALLENGE POST is a wooden pole hung with dyed banners, each
 representing a GLADIATOR willing to meet challengers. Beginning with
 the lowest, the banners are BLUE, GREEN, GOLD, RED and BLACK. The
 presence of the BLACK BANNER has clearly caused a stir in the GRAVEL
 PIT, and many of the ROGUES are looking upon you with something
 resembling reverence.

 A nearby ROGUE espies your curiosity, and sayeth "It was YE,
 barbarian! The MASTER GLADIATOR has returned to us, because of your
 skill! He has returned! It is a great day!"

>seize black banner



 As you pluck the BLACK BANNER from the CHALLENGE POST, the assembled
 rowdies cheer as they've never cheered before! You are ushered into
 the gladiator's ring, where you stand face-to-face with the imposing
 MASTER GLADIATOR!

 You take a moment to REGARD your opponent ... The MASTER GLADIATOR was
 once human, but now he is plainly both a MUTANT and a CYABORG, with
 several portions of his body replaced by ROBODROID parts, glittering
 with the lights of SCIENCE! His right ARM is entirely metal, and his
 left arm has skin of a color different from the rest of him,
 suggesting that he is a LIMB TRADER. His weapons are twin GRAVITY
 WHIPS. He smiles an easy, confident smile as he REGARDS you in return.

 "Let us begin" he says.

 the gladiator's ring, where you stand face-to-face with the imposing

 You take a moment to REGARD your opponent ... The MASTER GLADIATOR was
 once human, but now he is plainly both a MUTANT and a CYABORG, with
 several portions of his body replaced by ROBODROID parts, glittering
 with the lights of SCIENCE! His right ARM is entirely metal, and his
 left arm has skin of a color different from the rest of him,
 suggesting that he is a LIMB TRADER. His weapons are twin GRAVITY
 WHIPS. He smiles an easy, confident smile as he REGARDS you in return.

 "Let us begin" he says.

 This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the
 east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the
 CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town.
 The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous
 and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF stands close at hand, whistling a jaunty
 sailors' tune.

 You are briefly surprised by the looming figure of the MASTER
 GLADIATOR, but it is plain that he arrives in the spirit of
 friendship.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 "Ho there, barbarian," he says, his voice confident and enhanced with
 internal sub-woofers. "I just wanted to congratulate you privately. In
 truth, you are the real MASTER GLADIATOR now, but I know that your
 destiny is something far greater than to be the leader in a forgotten
 GRAVEL PIT."

 He shakes your hand, his CYABORG grip cutting off your circulation for
 a moment, and he smiles."I am proud to know you, barbarian, and I hope
 that we can become friends. To that end, I have a secret to offer you,
 something I have learned in my time here."

 He looks left and right, then adjusts his volume control to whisper.
 "One of our lesser gladiators is third cousin to the ROYAL PSI-WITCH,"
 he confides. "And he told me the secret to winning her approval ...
 You must prove that you are the PROPHESIED BARBARIAN, the great and
 crude slaughterer predicted long ago in the lore of the PSI-WITCHES of
 this realm. The legend says that the PROPHESIED BARBARIAN will carry a
 gift of valuable UNGUENT, a potent balm infused with the PSI-PSPICE,
 also called <span class="floydstyle em">AMALGAM</span>." He sighs, a deep and quadrophonic sigh.
 "I know not where to seek the PSI-PSPICE BALM, but I do believe that
 you are the one foretold, and so: seek it you must."

 You consider this, and nod. Satisfied that you understand, the MASTER
 GLADIATOR returns the gesture, and starts back toward the GRAVEL PIT
 OF ROGUES.

 You wonder, for a moment, if the SLAVER KING could ever be defeated by

 country lay to the south.

 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

 GUNWAR stays loyally at your side.

 You can see the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA and GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE here.

 GUNWAR limps along at your side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PEAK OF MOUNT GELIDUS</span>
 The view from the summit of MOUNT GELIDUS is enough to move even you,
 to give you a moment's peace from your savage thirst for vengeance.
 But only a moment. As you look down through the mists to the farms and
 forests stretching out to the SEA, the sight of the CASTLE of the
 SLAVER KING, framed in the distant sunset, reminds you of your
 purpose.

 The entrance to a forbidding CAVE is here, leading IN to the depths of
 the mountain.

 GUNWAR sticks close, keeping an eye out for danger.

>regard castle


 The CASTLE of the SLAVER KING towers higher than any citadel you know,
 and the fires of its turrets are visible far and wide in the SLAVER
 KING'S realm. It is said that the ceiling of the THRONE ROOM is high
 enough to house the tallest GIANT in all of VANTH.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">CAVE</span>
 The CAVE is damp, very dark, and smells strongly of the dead demons of
 the earth. There are other smells, too, for other wanderers have
 camped here not long ago. At the far end of the CAVE a swift and INKY
 SLUICE of water rushes into the unseen belly of the mountain.

 GUNWAR follows along.

 I'm not 100% certain what it is you wish to go IN to, barbarian. Now,

 likely dangers of such an action, I would not presume to carry out
 such a command unless thou hast typest it, explicitly.

 GUNWAR says, "I'm no good for swimming, lad, not even in a nice comfy
 CAVE like this one. But I'll wait here for ye, and if you don't swim
 back out, I'll search down the MOUNTAIN to meet you at the other end."

 Trusting to fate, you enter the swift current of the INKY SLUICE. The
 current is so powerful that you're carried away immediately into TOTAL

 You stand in a dismal swamp, with the chitter of unpleasant life in

 sucking at your sandaled tread.

 it stands a head taller than you, with crude, angry features.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 A bit upstream from you, a GRIZZLY BEAR is fishing for food, but not
 having much luck. The BEAR doesn't seem hostile.

 GUNWAR follows you.

 Somewhere in the distance, you hear the unmistakable report of a
 PROTONIC SPEARLAUNCH, but the quadruple-echo fades quickly.

>use fish on bear

 You extend the DEAD MAGIC FISH toward the GRIZZLY, and the great
 BEAR'S nose twitches damply as it looks up from the fresh flowing
 waters of the stream.

 Slowly, cautiously, the GRIZZLY approaches, and opens its mouth to
 take the proffered FISH. Once taken, the BEAR dines eagerly, clearly
 quite hungry.

 "Thank you, barbarian," the BEAR says, to your surprise, "the fishing
 here has been very poor since the GIANT SNOW SERPENTS started their
 feeding season upstream. I heard tell of FISH in the pools and streams
 south of here, but the PHASIC EMANATIONS in the swamp are too much for
 me."

 Sensing your unease with his speech, he says "My name is ADAM, my
 friend. Like many animals, I have a mind of my own but usually keep my
 own counsel, or at least keep to my own kind. You are not unknown to
 me. I have observed your questing, and while the RATS of the city fear
 your violent nature, I have hope that by that very violence you may
 bring salvation from the cruel SLAVER KING. Before I take my leave of
 you, I bequeath unto you this gift."

 And with a sparkle of light, the GRIZZLY vanishes.

 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

 An ELDERLY WOMAN stands at the crest of the hill, her dry white hair
 fluttering delicately in the evening breeze. She REGARDS you with eyes
 like fire, and you can feel unbidden thoughts crawling inside your
 head.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF follows along, puffing on his pipe.

>give ointment to woman


 I attaint thee, varlet! Thy verbiage, it affrighteth me! Refer to your
 game manual for assistance.

>use ointment on woman

 The old woman accepts the UNGUENT, regarding it with interest. She
 opens it, and sniffs.

 She smiles broadly. "It is as the ancients foretold," she says. "A
 barbarian will bring the ROYAL PSI-WITCH a gift of finest PSI-PSPICES
 slurried into a comforting BALM, that she might bathe deep in the
 comforts of her own mind while he would undo a KING most unjust ..."

 She peers at you with sudden suspicion, her eyes probing into your
 thoughts. "Of course, the old prophecy is well-known," she says, "and
 I see that VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY isn't the only one who has taken an
 interest in your cause."

 You can feel her peering within your mind, and her expression is one
 of both amusement and disgust. "VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY believes you
 are some master political strategist, the poor girl. I suppose it
 would be kindness to let her continue believing. It gives her a fire,
 and an energy that pleases me. But she is very intelligent, VESSA ...
 I do wonder what about you could blind her so. I wouldn't think her to
 have such an obvious weakness for simple fitness and savagery, but I
 suppose, at my age, I should be surprised by nothing." She REGARDS you
 quietly for a moment. "Your cranium is filled with meat, my friend,
 and not even the finest cuts."

 You nod grimly, thinking that this PSI-WITCH reminds you of VESSA a
 little, with all this prattling.

 She pockets the UNGUENT. "Still, prophecies are prophecies, and there
 is no rule that the truth must be a secret to remain true. Besides,"
 she adds ... "there are other signs that we HAVE kept secret: the
 color of your hair, the cut of your sandals, the stench of your
 unbath-ed form ... and all of these match. Every one. I am convinced."

 You enjoy the breeze cutting across the LONELY HILL, and also enjoy
 that the PSI-WITCH isn't currently muddling your mind and sending you
 to the corners of the realm without your consent, as her kind are wont
 to do.

 "Taketh some fresh CORN from the farms nearby, barbarian," she says,
 "and feed it to the COPPER GARGOYLE in the castle, after you hath
 tamed it. That is the first step to unlocking the SLAVER KING'S
 ARCHIVES. That unlocks a hidden switch in the great HEARTH, and that
 becomes the second step. The rest, the DOXY has already told you."

 "Most of the contents of the ARCHIVES will be of no interest to ...
 one such as you. The item you seek, however, the TRIPHASIC POWER CORE,
 will be easy to spot. It hums with power and it reeks of the FEAR of
 the SLAVER KING, who locks it there because he knows it can destroy
 him, and he knows not how to destroy IT."

 "The POWER CORE is said to provide the life-force of a great TALISMAN
 of some kind. I know not where this treasure lies. Find the AMULET,
 join the CORE to it, and you will have the tool that can bring the
 SLAVER KING to his grave."

 You nod, considering her words carefully. You decide that "your
 cranium is filled with meat" may be some sort of sexual advance, but
 surely a woman so wise would know that she is too old for you. There
 must be a deeper meaning still.

 The PSI-WITCH chuckles. "Begone, barbarian. And ... fare thee well."
 You feel your mind invaded by scientific waves of THOUGHT ENERGY, and
 you feel your feet wandering, your eyes closing, your thoughts
 dissolving ...

 You can see the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA and GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE</span>
 The snow on this mountain slope is all but undisturbed, and it glows a
 rich orange in the light of the setting sun. You can see that sun, far
 to the west, sinking into the sea. Its rays touch also on an ornate
 structure: You may (if you dare) ENTER a black TEMPLE to the Viraxian
 Demon-Gods.

 GUNWAR trails along.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FROSTED UPLANDS</span>
 Layers of frost and snow glitter on crags of ancient rock, and there
 are deep snowbanks to the north, approaching a BRIDGE made of pure
 ice, spanning a MIGHTY CREVASSE. Also seemingly made of ice is a
 beautiful CRYSTAL SPIRE, towering in the fading light, which you may
 ENTER.

 GUNWAR follows along.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOUNTAIN STREAM</span>
 The pine trees have the first dustings of winter, here, and you espy
 much more snow to the east, in the FROSTED UPLANDS. The runoff feeds a
 briskly-flowing stream, which flows west toward the CASTLE. Marshier
 country lay to the south.

 GUNWAR totters along beside you.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OLD STONE BRIDGE</span>
 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to
 the east, and disappearing into a small CULVERT leading IN at the base
 of a cliff. This cliff, and the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an
 icy shadow over the bridge. There is no path to the CASTLE from here,
 but the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

 GUN follows you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OPEN PLAIN</span>
 A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a blood-red

 open country.

 GUNWAR stays loyally at your side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">FARMER'S GREEN</span>
 A humble WELL provides a centerpiece for this quiet place, surrounded

 evening sky, but there's no path there from here.

 GUNWAR accompanies you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">LONELY HILL</span>
 Forest surrounds this hill on all sides, but there are no trees at the
 top - only grass and a few sad flowers, bending toward the setting
 sun. You see farmland to the north, and the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING
 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

 An ELDERLY WOMAN stands at the crest of the hill, her dry white hair
 fluttering delicately in the evening breeze. She REGARDS you with eyes
 like fire, and you can feel unbidden thoughts crawling inside your
 head.

 GUN totters along beside you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROCKY RUIN</span>

 notice a shadowy archway leading IN to one small structure that
 remains intact.

 You can see a TELEPHONE POLE here.

 GUNWAR follows along, puffing on his pipe.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GRAVEYARD</span>
 This dismal GRAVEYARD sits on a hill cloaked in mist, overlooking the
 SLAVER KING'S seedy SEAPORT to the north. There are hundreds of
 gravestones, some cracked with centuries of age, some quite new. There
 is a single large TOMB that a brave soul might choose to ENTER.

 GUN trails along.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TOMB</span>
 This TOMB is tiny and cold, and hath long ago been stripped of

 adventurers who got here faster than you. An entrance leads down into
 the CRYPT.

 GUNWAR follows along.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">CRYPT</span>
 This chamber is half-collapsed, and seems far older than the TOMB
 above. The air is strange here, as if it has not been breathed for a

 You notice a hatchway hanging open; you could ENTER if you so desired.

 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air

 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

 ... ooh. Feeling woozy ...

 You stumble, and ... you don't remember falling, but the next thing
 you know, you're lying on your side in the DARK ALLEYWAY, with a few
 RATS sniffing experimentally at your face. Fortunately, they dissolve
 in a haze.

 Then there is only BLACKNESS.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 You don't know how long you were unconscious, but you know you're not
 in the DARK ALLEYWAY any longer. You're on a table made of metal ...
 cold ... There's someone moving nearby.

 The room is humming with machines. You've never trusted machines.

 You black out again.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 Perhaps a very long time later, you pry your eyes open again, feeling
 a bit better, but still in the strange room, still on the metal table.
 A friendly-looking, elderly man is smiling at you. "Welcome back,
 barbarian. I feared we might lose you, but the
 prismatically-sublimated trimethylchlorinate seemed to do the trick!"

 You black out again. But after a short time, you wake once more, and
 you can see now, exactly where you are ...

 You're so woozy you can barely operate your eyelids.

 The old man beams. "Aha! Looks like the patient is finally recovering.
 Welcome, young fellow. Don't worry, we're still in the SLAVER'S
 KINGDOM, in my home. In my laboratory. The HOBLINGS who watch over the
 ALLEYWAY, along with your friend GUNWAR, rescued you from the city's
 denizens."

 He pauses to turn some dials on a machine, and a series of chittery
 beeps and whines sounds out. "Hm. Oh! I've forgotten my manners
 completely, and they call YOU a barbarian. My name is PROFESSOR
 MEGARIAN. I'm a SCIENTIST. And you, dear boy, you have been through so
 much ... so very much ..."

>parley with professor


 The attempt causes you so much pain, you nearly black out again.

 "Quite a cocktail of stimuli," the PROFESSOR mutters, half to himself.
 "Exposure to intense unmodulated phasic emanations, viral traces
 indicating dormant Fever Plague - have you been fighting PYREXIS
 HOUNDS? - and some parts of your bloodstream have been affected
 through your epidermis by - my stars! - the digestive fluids of a rare
 black-spine SEA MONSTER?" He wiggles a glassy tube in his hand, and
 watches the fluid inside change color "... and to top it all off,
 you've consumed the flesh of a GIANT SNOW-SERPENT. A quick-fix healer,
 to be sure, but with all sorts of microorganisms in the mix, not all
 of them native to VANTH ..."

>look


 OW! Ow. ow.

 The PROFESSOR smiles. "Son, I don't think you're a 'pure' HUMAN
 anymore. No shame in that; purity is overrated, as I'm sure a young,
 healthy lad like you has learned by now." He wiggles the glass tube
 again and peers closely at the contents. "Ah, yes. THE DELICATE DOXY
 ... you've learned, all right. Tell her I said hello, the sweet dear."

 He smiles a fatherly smile. "At some point soon, you'll certainly
 begin to MUTATE. The full effect sometimes takes months, but the first
 symptoms can appear very quickly. Be ready. With luck," he says, "it
 won't be fatal. There's never really a way to be sure."

>look


 Almost ... you manage to raise your head without pain, and look around
 ...

 "There's something there on the table you may find useful. I was
 saving it for my next trip to town, but ... SEIZE it, please. If
 you're the barbarian I think you are, well, your reputation precedes
 you. VESSA says you're the brilliant leader of a growing underground
 movement." He smiles "I'm very proud to have helped you in what little
 ways I can. The DELICATE DOXY is quite a little thinker herself ...
 any mind she admires must be quite sharp, eh?"

 You regard him with grim silence, unfamiliar with most of his words.

 "Ah, yes. Strong, silent type! VESSA said. Sign of an active
 intellect! The more we say the less we think, you know. Anyway, the
 passage to the west leads out behind a WATERFALL ... I'm afraid you
 won't be able to find a way back in. I keep this place private. But
 once the SLAVER KING is defeated, I can go out into the world again,

 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

 An ELDERLY WOMAN stands at the crest of the hill, her dry white hair
 fluttering delicately in the evening breeze. She REGARDS you with eyes
 like fire, and you can feel unbidden thoughts crawling inside your
 head.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF follows along.

 Your arm falls off.

 "Har!" observes GUNWAR, keenly. "Yer arm fell off, lad."

 The TWO-HANDED SWORD falls to the ground.

>seize arm


 You reach out to take YOUR OWN ARM with your good arm ... and then
 remember that your good arm is the one that fell off! By Huron, what
 madness IS this? It takes a moment to adjust, and you find yourself
 wiggling your fingers on your remaining arm to make sure it's still
 there. You think maybe you've got the hang of it, now.

>regard me


 You have the savage bearing of an upland tribesman, quick like a
 THESKIAN MOUNTAIN CAT and cruel of eye, though 'tis truth that your
 heart is not unkind. Your mirth is as mighty as your gloom, and your
 ire as potent as your warmer passions.

>inventory


 You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty
 THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG): the SEVENTH HOARFROST DIAMOND, a JAR OF
 PSI-PSPICE UNGUENT, a SUIT OF BURLAP ARMOR (currently un-used), a SUIT
 OF CHAINMAIL ARMOR (currently un-used), a SUIT OF KLENGON MAIL
 (currently un-used), an EAR OF CORN, a FLASHLIGHT, a SUIT OF IMPERVIUM
 PLATE-MAIL ARMOR (being worn) and a DELICATELY-OILED CLOTH.

 The ROYAL PSI-WITCH looks at you impatiently, like a child waiting for
 an expected gift. "Have you ... something for me, barbarian?" she
 says.

>seize sword

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">LONELY HILL</span>
 Forest surrounds this hill on all sides, but there are no trees at the
 top - only grass and a few sad flowers, bending toward the setting
 sun. You see farmland to the north, and the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING
 looming high above. To the west is the harbor TOWN, but there's no
 good path from here.

 GUNWAR stands close at hand, chuckling to himself.

 An ELDERLY WOMAN stands at the crest of the hill, her dry white hair
 fluttering delicately in the evening breeze. She REGARDS you with eyes
 like fire, and you can feel unbidden thoughts crawling inside your
 head.

 You can also see YOUR OWN ARM here.

>seize arm


 Seized.

>use ointment on witch

 The old woman accepts the UNGUENT, regarding it with interest. She
 opens it, and sniffs.

 She smiles broadly. "It is as the ancients foretold," she says. "A
 barbarian will bring the ROYAL PSI-WITCH a gift of finest PSI-PSPICES
 slurried into a comforting BALM, that she might bathe deep in the
 comforts of her own mind while he would undo a KING most unjust ..."

 She peers at you with sudden suspicion, her eyes probing into your
 thoughts. "Of course, the old prophecy is well-known," she says, "and
 I see that VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY isn't the only one who has taken an
 interest in your cause."

 You can feel her peering within your mind, and her expression is one
 of both amusement and disgust. "VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY believes you
 are some master political strategist, the poor girl. I suppose it
 would be kindness to let her continue believing. It gives her a fire,
 and an energy that pleases me. But she is very intelligent, VESSA ...
 I do wonder what about you could blind her so. I wouldn't think her to
 have such an obvious weakness for simple fitness and savagery, but I
 suppose, at my age, I should be surprised by nothing." She REGARDS you
 quietly for a moment. "Your cranium is filled with meat, my friend,
 and not even the finest cuts."

 You nod grimly, thinking that this PSI-WITCH reminds you of VESSA a
 little, with all this prattling.

 She pockets the UNGUENT. "Still, prophecies are prophecies, and there
 is no rule that the truth must be a secret to remain true. Besides,"
 she adds ... "there are other signs that we HAVE kept secret: the
 color of your hair, the cut of your sandals, the stench of your
 unbath-ed form ... and all of these match. Every one. I am convinced."

 You enjoy the breeze cutting across the LONELY HILL, and also enjoy
 that the PSI-WITCH isn't currently muddling your mind and sending you
 to the corners of the realm without your consent, as her kind are wont
 to do.

 "Taketh some fresh CORN from the farms nearby, barbarian," she says,
 "and feed it to the COPPER GARGOYLE in the castle, after you hath
 tamed it. That is the first step to unlocking the SLAVER KING'S
 ARCHIVES. That unlocks a hidden switch in the great HEARTH, and that
 becomes the second step. The rest, the DOXY has already told you."

 "Most of the contents of the ARCHIVES will be of no interest to ...
 one such as you. The item you seek, however, the TRIPHASIC POWER CORE,
 will be easy to spot. It hums with power and it reeks of the FEAR of
 the SLAVER KING, who locks it there because he knows it can destroy
 him, and he knows not how to destroy IT."

 "The POWER CORE is said to provide the life-force of a great TALISMAN
 of some kind. I know not where this treasure lies. Find the AMULET,
 join the CORE to it, and you will have the tool that can bring the
 SLAVER KING to his grave."

 You nod, considering her words carefully. You decide that "your
 cranium is filled with meat" may be some sort of sexual advance, but
 surely a woman so wise would know that she is too old for you. There
 must be a deeper meaning still.

 The PSI-WITCH chuckles. "Begone, barbarian. And ... fare thee well."
 You feel your mind invaded by scientific waves of THOUGHT ENERGY, and
 you feel your feet wandering, your eyes closing, your thoughts
 dissolving ...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MARKETPLACE</span>
 This busy MARKETPLACE is the heart of the town, nestled against the
 mighty GATES of the CASTLE. You are careful to keep a low profile
 here, directly beneath the looming facade of the SLAVER KING'S own
 citadel.

 A lone GUARD stands watch before the GATES, staring ahead dutifully
 and ignoring the throng of the MARKETPLACE.

>inventory


 You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty
 THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG): YOUR OWN ARM (sitting un-attached in the

>use arm


 With a wet, nauseating CLICK, you shove YOUR OWN ARM into its socket.
 You give a few flexes, to make sure it's properly attached.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF arrives, grinning pleasantly. "I might have
 known I'd find ye 'round the MARKETPLACE!"

>prowess


 You wield only your bare, callused FIST. Adjusting for your abilities
 and progress, you do from 14 to 19 points of damage with each
 successful blow. Your odds of striking true are 92% (burdened somewhat

 which increases your Hit Points by 245%. You are versed in the useful

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SEASHORE</span>
 An elderly LIGHTHOUSE is here (you could go IN), warning ships against
 the dangers of the rocky coastline. This stretch includes some soft
 sand as well as rocks ... a small beach looking out on the SEA OF
 GREAT PERIL. Over some bluffs to the immediate south, you can hear the
 sounds of the SLAVER KING'S harbor town. To the east are some pines.

 GUN stays loyally at your side.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PINE FOREST</span>
 This is a peaceful forest of tall pines, with a well-worn road leading
 west, toward the SEASHORE, and east.

 There is a SOLID GOLD STATUE here, gently shaded by the PINE TREES
 along the side of the road. The entire area is draped in gauzy,
 oversized WEBS of sticky translucence.

 GUNWAR trails along.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ROYAL ROAD</span>
 The SLAVER KING maintains this plank-paved highway for the good of his
 fat merchants, using slave labor. It is built on the backs of your
 people, and of any others his slave-catchers can beat into submission.
 Legend has it that a part of this road runs all the way distant to the
 UNKNOWN HIGHWAY! From here, however, it runs east to an ABANDONED
 QUARRY, and west into the pine-woods north of the CASTLE.

 GUNWAR follows you.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ABANDONED QUARRY</span>
 This vast pit stands in the shadow of the snow-capped mountains to the
 east. It was here that the great stones were quarried to build the
 CASTLE of the SLAVER KING, and the walls of the nearby harbor town.
 The site is long-abandoned, or so it's told ... But you hear a riotous
 and happy din DOWN in the GRAVEL PIT.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF follows along, puffing on his pipe.

 GUNWAR accompanies you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OLD STONE BRIDGE</span>
 This ancient bridge crosses a stream running down from the uplands to
 the east, and disappearing into a small CULVERT leading IN at the base
 of a cliff. This cliff, and the SLAVER KING'S CASTLE atop it, casts an
 icy shadow over the bridge. There is no path to the CASTLE from here,
 but the ROYAL ROAD lies to the north.

 GUNWAR follows just a few steps behind you.

>enter culvert


 GUNWAR says, "I'd never be able to swim in there with me peg-leg, but
 I'll try to find another way in to meet ye."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">SLAVE PENS (ON CATWALK)</span>
 As the DOXY foretold, deep into the CULVERT there is a stone platform,
 and a ladderwell leading into a vast underground chamber ... a chamber
 of torture and woe! For here, from a high CATWALK, strewn with
 discarded metal junk, you can see hundreds of the SLAVER KING'S
 captured workers: Humans, Vulkins, Frankensteins, Robodroids and more!

 Some are shattering rocks with hammers, some are providing motive
 power for large wooden wheels, some are being whipped or burned by the
 many burly GUARDS. You cannot be seen from your current vantage point,
 but if you were to venture into the PENS you would once again be a
 slave, yourself.

 The path to the surface leads UP, but a CRAWLWAY beckons further IN
 from here, barely visible in the shadows.

>in



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">CASTLE</span>
 You stand in a central hall of the CASTLE of the SLAVER KING,
 surrounded by opulent FURNISHINGS of every description. You notice
 people moving in the distance, but this place is so huge that your own
 arrival seems to have gone unnoticed by the non-GARGOYLE denizens.
 Just to be sure, you stick to the shadows (fortunately, there are
 many). An enormous flight of MARBLE STAIRS leads upward, to the THRONE
 ROOM.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Now then ... </span>what was that SECRET COMBINATION? Something with
 an EAR OF CORN, then something about a hearth? Or was it the trestles?
 And SEIZING a tapestry ... and then ASSAILING a mirror? Something
 about a mirror, anyway.

 You notice that the floor is remarkably clean, here.

>use corn on gargoyle


 You offer the EAR OF CORN to the now-inanimate statue, ready for
 anything. The GARGOYLE re-animates ... but only long enough to consume
 the CORN with a gentle belch to follow. As the features of the
 GARGOYLE re-settle, they are smiling instead of scowling.

 GUNWAR totters into view, moving as quickly as his PEG-LEG will allow.
 "I might have known ye'd be somewhere 'round the CASTLE!"

>regard hearth


 It is a huge fireplace, filled with a ROARING FIRE of the sort you
 used to toast MARSH GOBLINS in when visiting your uncle's hunting
 lodge as a boy.

>use hearth


 You find that one brick has extended itself very slightly. The brick
 cannot be pulled further or turned in any way, so you press it back
 into place, and there is a firm CLICK. You hear a whirring noise,
 somewhere.

>seize ivory


 You attempt to SEIZE the TAPESTRY by tugging hard at the bottom, but
 instead you seem to have pulled some kind of hidden switch, as there
 is a series of firm CLICKS, followed by a grinding noise somewhere
 inside the walls.

>regard mirror


 You stand before the GIGANTIC MIRROR, and see a very handsome upland
 barbarian staring back with a look of naked, intense admiration. You
 also half-see, behind the smoky glass, movement like the spinning
 wheels of a SUPERCOMPUTER. You hear a distant beeping sound.

 With a puff of dust, a hidden door becomes apparent. You may go IN
 whenever you please, barbarian.

>in



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">ARCHIVES</span>
 This chamber is small and musty, as if even the air is not permitted
 to leave, lest it tell a secret. Most of the things stored here seem,
 to thine eyes, as dusty rubbish.

 It isn't difficult to spot the exception: resting, free of dust, on a
 shelf all its own, the TRIPHASIC POWER CORE gleams as if lit by an
 entirely different world from this grim little chamber. Tiny lights on
 its surface blink, glitter, and chase each other like playful pups.
 The POWER CORE hums, sending soft and not unpleasant vibrations
 throughout the room. So ... this is the thing that the SLAVER KING
 fears.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF totters along beside you.

 GUNWAR sticks close, keeping an eye out for danger.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">BUSTLING PORT</span>
 You tread carefully, here. This is the city of the SLAVER KING, and he
 may have spies anywhere! Fortunately, the crowd here at the docks is a
 varied, noisy mass of people and creatures from all corners of Vanth.
 The MARKETPLACE further north surrounds the CASTLE entrance. The DARK
 ALLEYWAY immediately south might offer shelter if the guards come
 running.

 A GROUP OF PIRATES stands around the gangplank of a mighty PIRATE
 SHIP, deciding who may or may not go IN.

 GUN follows along.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DARK ALLEYWAY</span>
 Places like this wretched ALLEYWAY make you yearn for the clean air
 and freedom of the open country. Buildings lean against one another,
 far above your head, and RATS scurry around the base of a large
 BARREL. To the north lay the bustling quayside. To the south, you
 could easily scramble over the city wall and up a brambly hill.

 Light shines from a half-open doorway nearby, you could go IN if you
 wanted. The air from the doorway smells of subtle perfumes and spices.

 GUNWAR limps along at your side.

>use core on gunwar

 GUNWAR says, "I'd best wait here, lad. Three's a crowd in with a fine
 DOXY, at least until we know each other better."

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>




 <span class="floydstyle subheader">PERFUMED BOUDOIR</span>
 You find yourself in a soft maze of colored veils, leading to a large
 bed piled with furs and cloth pillows. There are no candles or
 oil-lamps here, but rather globes of red glass lit by magic, pulsing
 with the rhythm of soft music.

 VESSA is here, sprawled across the bed and grinning at you,
 invitingly.

>parley with vessa


 VESSA snuggles against you playfully. "Welcome back, heroic barbarian.
 Oh, I so wish that my DOXY CODE OF COMMERCE did not forbid me from
 taking you for my own selfish pleasures, or I would leap upon you this
 instant." She pouts, but then brightens. "Fortunately, I am confident
 in your ability to bring me treasures more than suitable for payment."

>use core on vessa


 VESSA smiles, and gently caresses the TRIPHASIC POWER CORE. "Oh,
 barbarian, that's a <span class="floydstyle em">very</span> wicked thought, and you know I'd
 adore taking you to my bed, but really, that isn't respectful payment
 for what I can offer you." Her smile brightens. "If you bring me some
 proper payment, it might be fun if you bring the TRIPHASIC POWER CORE
 along as well ..."

>inventory


 You bear the following (both on your person and stashed in your trusty
 THESKIAN DUFFEL BAG): a TRIPHASIC POWER CORE, YOUR OWN ARM (attached
 to you), a TWO-HANDED SWORD (held at the ready), the SEVENTH HOARFROST
 DIAMOND, a SUIT OF BURLAP ARMOR (currently un-used), a SUIT OF
 CHAINMAIL ARMOR (currently un-used), a SUIT OF KLENGON MAIL (currently
 un-used), a FLASHLIGHT, a SUIT OF IMPERVIUM PLATE-MAIL ARMOR (being
 worn) and a DELICATELY-OILED CLOTH.

>use diamond on vessa

 VESSA accepts the DIAMOND and holds it up to the light, smiling
 brightly. Then, her smile dissolves into a look of astonishment. She
 hefts it experimentally. "145.27 carats!" she declares. Producing a
 jeweler's loupe and fitting it to her eye, she stares ... "Softly
 smoked blue, Hobling-Emperor-Oval cut, 74 facets ..." she angles it
 slightly and examines the light passing through it. "Dispersion is
 just about right, too!"

 She leaps into your arms. "How did you KNOW? Barbarian, my life's
 secret quest is to collect the twenty HOARFROST DIAMONDS! I had only
 two of them ... but now I have the famed 'Icy Star of the Mutated
 Slime-Empress,' the SEVENTH HOARFROST DIAMOND! You must have battled
 the most ferocious monsters in all the realm to win such a prize for
 me!" Overcome with excitement, she hits you hard in the nose in her
 haste to rip her clothes off and have you in her bed.

 ... Approximately three days (and many exhausting pleasures) later,
 VESSA THE DELICATE DOXY snuggles naked against you, having turned away
 dozens of customers, including an angry group of soldiers demanding
 her presence in the THRONE ROOM of the SLAVER KING himself. For your
 own part, you are well pleased, slightly dehydrated, and confused on
 the subject of your own name, when the DOXY speaks:

 "Barbarian, I cannot thank you enough for allowing me to act as your
 agent. Life in your spy network is more thrilling than almost anything
 I've ever experienced!" She runs a finger gently across your muscled
 jaw, "... <span class="floydstyle em">almost</span> anything."

 She sits up on the bed, has a good stretch, then collapses back
 against you, laughing. "The most unusual development of late has been
 the amazing work of PROFESSOR MEGARIAN ..." Noticing the look in your
 eye, she adds "No need to be shy about it, my stallion, my charger, my
 Haragornian thoroughbred ... the PROFESSOR knows he can confide in
 fellow disciples of your revolutionary movement."

 You pause to consider this, and nod, because it means little.

 "He is a man of very powerful SCIENCE," she muses. "He has been
 working on methods to send objects backward in time, so that they
 could be found and used by those living in the distant past, or even
 preserved in hidden locations until otherwise needed. Isn't that
 fascinating?"

 You admire how her naked stomach moves when she squirms in excitement.

 "Oh, and he sent this for you," she says, handing you a CRIMSON
 POTION. "He says to save it for your battle with the SLAVER KING, and
 to waste it not. I told him that there's no need to instruct a man
 such as you; you will always do what's right." She puts one leg over
 you, and bites playfully on your thrice-broken barbarian nose.

 Sensing an opportunity to end the chatter, you draw her to you and
 remind her what a DOXY and a barbarian do when a warm bed lay beneath
 them. She requires little reminding, and your shared passions are so
 great that you wonder if the ALLEY HOBLINGS have their ears pressed to
 the walls to behold the DOXY'S plaintive gasps and joyous squealings.

 ... Many more hours (and etc) later, you emerge from the DOXY's
 chambers, sated and well-pleased, and scented with jasmine and
 feminine ardour.

 What a strange place! The walls are made of stone braced with a dull

 centered on a GLOWING PEDESTAL.

 Sitting on the pedestal is the AMULET of SCIENCE.

 GUNWAR the PEG-LEG DWARF sticks close, keeping an eye out for danger.

 The stillness of this indoor air is unsettling.

>regard amulet


 Hung from a chain that it might be worn, it is as the fables tell: an
 AMULET fashioned of finest SCIENCE.

>use core on amulet


 As your hand approacheth the fabled AMULET of SCIENCE, there is a
 stream of light from the TRIPHASIC POWER CORE. In response, the AMULET
 becomes more solid, right before your eyes, and then warmly in your
 mighty grasp! The POWER CORE, seeking its rightful home, dissolves
 into the AMULET causing it to shine with brilliant coruscating light!
 The AMULET of SCIENCE is thine!

 "Put it on, lad! Put it on!" urges GUNWAR.

 You place the AMULET of SCIENCE around your neck, and there is an

 invisibility, but you can still feel its presence.

 The MASTER GLADIATOR welcomes your company, and you while away the
 hours discussing great battles and campaigns, terrible monsters,
 alluring wenches, and tales of great treasures. You speak also of the
 SLAVER KING, and of this the MASTER GLADIATOR sayeth:

 "Know ye this, mighty barbarian, we have watchmen observing the CASTLE
 at all times, and when there is sign of mischief or battle there, we
 will arrive to aid you against the SLAVER KING. Thanks be to you for
 this hope of freedom in a realm that knoweth only servitude, and
 thanks be to you for making all of us better Warriors than once we
 were! You will reap the rewards of your deeds, barbarian, and I have
 faith that you will reap the sorry SKULL of the wretched SLAVER KING."

>use arm on gladiator


 The MASTER GLADIATOR smiles at your request "Sa-ho! Indeed, I am a
 LIMB TRADER MUTANT, and I see that you are, too! If it will serve the
 cause, barbarian, then I will gladly trade my strong CYABORG ARM for
 your own able limb. But I do want to trade back, when the SLAVER KING
 is dead, eh?"

 With that, he tugs his CYABORG ARM free, and trades with you. He
 attaches YOUR OWN ARM with a wet THWICK sound and a metallic hum, and
 flexes it experimentally. "You must definitely SEIZE the BLACK BANNER
 at some point soon, barbarian. It would be most amusing for us to do
 battle with one another's limbs attached!"

 By Huron's Pandean passions! You feel like your old self again: the
 Warrior who strode the world before the slave-catchers took your
 freedom. Your strength is what it once was, your mirth is what it once
 was, your <span class="floydstyle em">manly lusting</span> is what it once was ... You are WHOLE

 you will soon be MORE than you once were! Sa-ho!

 With a sweep of your mighty CYABORG ARM, you lift GUNWAR into the air.
 "Sa-ho!" he cries, happily. "The next best thing to being a Warrior
 (of perhaps half your Level) is being a WEAPON!"

 You hang the TELEPHONE POLE at your side, and grasp instead the
 RUNE-CARVED PEG-LEG DWARF, prepared for battle!

 The stillness and heaviness of the indoor air is unpleasant to
 breathe.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">THRONE ROOM</span>
 You stand before and <span class="floydstyle em">beneath</span> the THRONE of the realm. Peering
 upward, your eyes can barely espy the room's loftiest reaches, high in
 the smoky darkness.

 Seated on the THRONE, and glaring down at you from a great height, is
 the figure of the SLAVER KING himself, a monarch few outside his court
 have seen and lived. As he leans forward from the shadows to REGARD
 you, you see <span class="floydstyle em">why</span> so few have lived!

 Long have your people told tales of the GIANT ATOMIC DINOSAURS that
 roam in the wilder reaches of VANTH. Even great and savage HURON, the
 GOD OF BEING A VERY MIGHTY GOD, was devoured by such a beast, earning
 their race the name of "ZILLA" - meaning "EATER" in the ancient GODLY
 TONGUE.

 Even the great FOOT-CLAWS of this GOD-EATER rise beyond your reach,
 and as the SLAVER KING stands from his THRONE, you see that his TAIL
 is so vast it could flatten the city MARKETPLACE. Long have you
 wondered why the CASTLE was so very tall, thinking it only the hubris
 of royalty.

 With a great inhuman roar, like a hundred SEA-MONSTERS having their
 scales scraped off with noisy metal scrap, the SLAVER KING raises a
 drum-loaded TOMMYGUN in his right claw, the barrel gleaming cold and
 black in the smoky half-darkness.

 With his left claw, he grasps a CYLINDER ... like a giant FLASHLIGHT
 fashioned of steel. Pressing a button along its edge, he unleashes a
 BLADE OF PURE ENERGY, and turns it this way and that, with each swish
 sounding an unpleasant HUM. It is none other than a PHASIC PRISMATIC
 SWORD, a sword-without-blade!

 He roars again, and PHASIC HELLFIRE rises from his nostrils. He stands
 proudly, as if daring you to strike.

 GUNWAR regains his footing and dusts himself off. "It's good to
 stretch me good leg a bit" he says, "but if you ever need to wield me
 again, lad, I don't mind at all!"

 The SLAVER KING eyes GUNWAR with a contemptuous growl, and inhales
 deeply. Before you can warn your DWARF companion, the great ATOMIC
 DINOSAUR unleashes a <span class="floydstyle i">BLAST OF PHASIC RADIATION</span> from his maw.
 You dodge the blast in the stonework ... but GUNWAR, screaming and
 attempting to run with an old peg-leg, is overtaken, killed in one
 painful instant.

 All that survives of GUNWAR is his most prized possession ... the
 BLACK HOLE METAL AXE, which skitters across the smooth flagstones and
 lands at your feet, black smoke coiling from its demonic surfaces. You
 pick it up, and the SLAVER KING chuckles, a cruel and bestial sound.

 ... and then there is roaring noise from the CASTLE chambers below,
 and the doors to the THRONE ROOM fly open! The noise of the BATTLE has
 brought the entire REALM, it seems, to witness the outcome.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 Your friend the ROBODROID arrives, leading a rag-tag company of his
 fellow mechanical men, each armed with weapons they've fashioned from
 found scrap, and from each others' bodies!

 "There," says the ROBODROID calmly, pointing toward HIS MAJESTY. "Kill
 it." While his manner is cold, you think you can almost sense the
 inner rage of the VOLTAIC WRAITH which crackles in his robotic heart.

 With your mechanical ally in the lead, the ROBODROIDS begin to ASSAIL
 the SLAVER KING with a terrifying hail of gunfire, lances of energy,
 loosed ROCKETS, even a few volleys of STEEL ARROWS. The mighty ATOMIC
 DINOSAUR is bloodied and battered by the assault, but sweeps the
 ROBODROIDS aside with a lashing of his tail, and fuses them into slag
 with his <span class="floydstyle i">RADIO-PHASIC BREATH FIRE.</span>

 You are pleasantly surprised to see the ACOLYTE OF TRAGA stride
 forward from the crowd, with GINA THE VIRGIN SACRIFICE at his side
 (still naked and gleaming with ANOINTING OIL, but now armed with a
 pair of BROOMHANDLE MAUSERS holstered in her only "clothing" - a
 low-slung leather GUN-BELT).

 Raising the GLADIUS SWORD you gave him high, the ACOLYTE hails you.
 "Greetings, barbarian! With the SLAVER KING doomed to die, I no longer
 need to sacrifice GINA, and we can now prepare to be married,
 instead!" GINA blushes prettily (all over, you notice) and opens fire
 on the SLAVER KING, as her beloved ACOLYTE charges to engage in melee.

 Sadly, the SLAVER KING vanquishes them both, knocking GINA into the
 side of a stone pillar with an unpleasant cracking noise, and carving
 into the ACOLYTE with his light blade. The blade must have destroyed
 the TRAGA PRIEST utterly, because only his empty robes flutter to the
 floor.

 Crying "for the GLADIATORS!" and waving all three arms madly, VON
 DARTH THE SLY charges out of the throng, carving into the SLAVER
 KING'S foot repeatedly with his machete. The SLAVER KING crushes him
 into a wet balloon of blood and flesh with the <span class="floydstyle em">other</span> foot.

 There is a great FLUTTERING from the air and a great SLITHERING upon
 the ground, as deadly BEASTS enter the fray ... OWLS and EAGLES and
 PTERANODONS striking from the air, mighty SERPENTS and SPIDERS on the
 ground, and leading their charge, your beast-friend ADAM the GRIZZLY,
 roaring with a ferocity he never displayed to you in the wild. Most of
 the animals are slain quickly by the SLAVER KING, but the flood
 continues for some time before he can CRUSH or BURN them all. ADAM
 himself fights to the last, until he too, is left still and bloody on
 the cold flagstone floor.

 The mighty THRANG strides in, and lands several good blows before he
 is fried to a column of pure ASH by the <span class="floydstyle i">ATOMIC EXHALE</span> of the
 SLAVER KING. The ash whips into the breeze like a solemn dust-devil in
 epitaph, and you resolve to later sprinkle some of the ashes at the
 GRAVEYARD where his KLENGON ancestors rest.

 There is a fresh roar as a surge of SLAVES charges into the room,
 obviously released by FOUL EMMA the GLADIATOR FRANKENSTEIN. She leads
 the charge with tears in her eyes, and two other FRANKENSTEINS -
 unmistakably her own MOTHER and FATHER - charge with her. The wave of
 angry SLAVES and the thumping ire of FRANKENSTEIN STRENGTH is enough
 to topple the SLAVER KING, who falls backward into his own THRONE,
 crushing it into a forest of splinters! He rights himself with
 difficulty as weapons pelt him from all directions, but ultimately
 sweeps all the SLAVES aside, and knocks the FRANKENSTEINS into the
 shadowy corners of the room, where you hear the unpleasant crunch of
 bone and flesh against stone. Emma's faint voices reaches your ears:
 "Me ... love you, barbarian ..." and then there is only silence.

 There is a RESOUNDING SCREAM, echoing the battle glory of the APE
 SULTANS, as the great prince XAKANDA THE APE swings down from the
 shadows on a chandelier rope! The SLAVER KING bellows with hate as the
 mighty PLANETARY APE Warrior lands on his neck, and begins flailing
 deadly force with his TRIPLE-BLUTARCH! The ATOMIC DINOSAUR puts his
 claws to the side of his head, trying to grasp his assailant, and
 thrashes across the THRONE ROOM in rage! Finally there is an
 almost-imperceptible <span class="floydstyle em">squish</span> ... and the SLAVER KING returns
 to his proud stance, relieved like a normal man who hath crushed a
 mosquito.

 The SLAVER KING has little time to repose in his glory, however, as a
 lance of powerful ENERGIES suddenly wracks his gigantic rubbery form!
 There is grim laughter from the shadows, where a collection of glowing
 orange lights and silhouette resolves itself into the form of the
 MASTER GLADIATOR, unleashing his OWN BODY'S ENERGIES through his
 GRAVITY WHIPS.

 The MASTER GLADIATOR regards you quietly with a respectful nod, and
 then shouts to the SLAVER KING: "Know this, foul ATOMIC MONARCH! We of
 your realm are no longer your subjects! We of your realm are no longer
 your machines! We of your realm follow this barbarian to freedom! And
 our freedom is your DEATH ... and mine."

 With that, the eyes of the MASTER GLADIATOR glow like twin suns, and
 the lights on his CYABORG BODY coruscate rapidly, and then there is a
 heavy wave of EXPLOSIVE FORCE and a flood of blinding light, as the
 MASTER GLADIATOR unleashes the core of his own LIFE-FORCE in
 terrifying explosive power.

 The SLAVER KING bellows in pain, and flies into the air, crashing
 against the far wall in a shower of cracking masonry and dust. The
 entire THRONE ROOM begins to shudder, and great blocks of STONE fall
 from the shadowy heights, many of them impacting the SKULL of the
 SLAVER KING.

 ... who, slowly and with obvious annoyance, rises to his feet once
 more.

 In the aftermath of the carnage, the SLAVER KING stumbles, the corpses
 of your ALLIES crunching beneath his clawed feet. Bloodied and
 diminished, and quaking with obvious RADIOACTIVE RAGE, he returns his
 attention to you ...

 "Way to KEEL-HAUL that blackguard SLAVER KING, lad!"

 your direction!<span class="floydstyle em"> You have suffered 62 hits of damage!</span>

 A skillful attack if you do say so yourself!<span class="floydstyle em"> You scored 41 points</span>

 "Teamwork, me hearty! 'Tis a glory to behold!" cries GUNWAR, twirling
 his BLACK HOLE METAL AXE to counterbalance your swing.

 With a spray of DEMONIC LEAD from his TOMMYGUN and a swat from his
 mighty TAIL, the SLAVER KING attacks!<span class="floydstyle em"> You have suffered 44 hits of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">damage!</span>

 Time passes.

 ... Probably not a lot of time, because you're still in the THRONE
 ROOM, surrounded by (it seems like) half the realm. Slaves are pouring
 in, tearing into the great carcass of the SLAVER KING. Courtiers are
 discarding their fine raiment and dancing half-naked in pools of
 blood. GUARDS are arriving, swords in hand, and then just stopping,
 because they're not sure what to do, or who they serve anymore.

 You see it all through a fading haze of BLOOD LUST, and even the
 sounds of shouting and revels and anger and confusion are muted, as
 through a maze of veils.

 Amid the growing chaos, you stand next to the great face of the SLAVER
 KING, dead upon the stones of his hall. His vast eyes, once aglow with
 ATOMIC HATE, are empty. His vast maw hangeth open, tongue lolling,
 with no more phasic hellfire to offer.

 Somewhere in the distance, a petty lord tries to claim power
 immediately. A competitor does the same, and they fall to
 fist-fighting when none of the GUARDS rally to them. They end up
 slipping to the floor, wrestling like petulant children. The SLAVES
 begin piling the wood from the throne for a bonfire.

 You find yourself surrounded by girls - a CIRCLE of young PSI-WITCHES.
 They dance around you for a moment, and the air sparkles with their
 power. Then they bow and withdraw, but one lingers long enough to hand
 you an ancient, crumbling scroll.

 You nod, so as not to seem ungracious. You cannot read the writing,
 but you notice that the style of the hand-writing is both beautiful
 and familiar. Artful penmanship. You let it slip to the floor, and
 stride on.

 You don't recall setting GUNWAR down, but you find him dancing and
 shouting. He is bloodied and bruised, and his PEG-LEG is half
 splintered, but he glows with naught but triumph and joy. Men are
 showering him with ale, women are tending his hurts, and everyone is
 singing, a raucous, distant song ...

 So many brave souls came to your aid, fighting and suffering for your
 vengeance ... and for vengeance of their own, you suppose. You don't
 know how many of them are dead, and how many are among those being
 tended by the HEALERS hurrying about with poultices and rags.

 Waves of people come up to hail you. Some throw flowers, some offer
 handshakes, some kneel and offer fealty.

 Are you a KING now? You're not sure if you want that, not yet. A KING
 sits on a throne and waits for someone else to come and kill him. You
 long to wander free, to taste the fresh wind and feel the grasses
 brushing your sandaled feet.

 You feel a gentle hand brush your arm. It is VESSA, the DELICATE DOXY,
 garbed in translucent fabrics and glittering jewels, dressed for
 courtly performances. She smiles at you, and gestures briefly with her
 eyes, to an open doorway, to a balcony.

 ... As the bonfire grows, the revelers have taken to their ale, and
 it's no matter at all to slip away from the THRONE ROOM for a while,
 to be alone with VESSA, the sullen night sky, and the great vista of a
 realm no longer a SLAVER'S KINGDOM.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press a key when ready)</span>

 Time passes.

 ... Probably a lot of time, because you stand on a wind-swept hill,
 weapon in hand, PEG-LEG DWARF at your side, and DUFFEL BAG slung at
 the ready. The sun rises in the distance, and an ANCIENT ROAD beckons.

 GUNWAR smiles. "It's good to have won."

 You nod.

 He glances over his shoulder at the realm once ruled by a SLAVER KING.
 "And we've won the finest prize, lad." GUNWAR tamps some fresh leaf
 into his pipe, and takes his time lighting it. "The best thing we can
 have, while the wind still blows and we have a few limbs left ..."

 You raise a questioning eyebrow.

 GUNWAR smiles, and points the damp end of his pipe toward the ROAD,
 extending deep into the last morning mist. Neither you nor he knows
 where it leads.

 And the sun riseth higher, and you see ships upon the distant SEA, and
 riders on the distant PLAIN, and the fluttering of monstrous wings
 above distant MOUNTAINS.

 Then, in the VALLEY behind you, you spot the small form of VESSA,
 waving to you, running, with a SWORD in her hand, and her very own
 DUFFEL at her side. She is laughing, and her eyes are eager and
 bright.

 And you nod, and you smile. For you are well pleased.
