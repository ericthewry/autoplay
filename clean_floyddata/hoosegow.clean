 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 As the sun sets on the plains, Sheriff Cheney angrily snaps on the
 cuffs. You are shoved into the coach and land on top of Muddy Charlie
 and a pile of silver dollars, which until recently had been the
 property of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Line.

 Muddy whispers, "Don't fret none, Rick! You done good blowing up that
 tunnel -- I just didn't plan on the sheriff getting word ahead of
 time, is all. That were powerful bad luck."

 The sheriff climbs onto his horse, spits, and you begin to rumble
 forward. "You boys really got it coming this time," he yells back
 cheerfully.

 Muddy shakes his head. "No offense, Sheriff, but I reckon you got the
 wrong men. We was just on our way to the theater."

 The sheriff disagrees. "The only place you boys are heading is
 straight to the...

 [Press Space To Continue]








 In the twilight, you sight the sheriff's sturdy brick office near the
 edge of town. "That's mighty fine construction," notes Muddy, sounding
 less feisty now. "Mighty fine indeed." The coach rolls to a halt and a
 thick arm yanks you roughly from your seat. You land awkwardly in the
 rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of
 one boot. He yells to his men, "Bring the coach around back, we got to
 impound that evidence." You are shoved into the sheriff's office and
 then into a small holding cell.

 The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and
 stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a
 brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on
 the desk. He barks, "Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near
 the train. A federal marshal will be coming for them at eight o'clock
 tomorrow morning. There's going to be a hanging!" The deputy nods
 slowly. The sheriff continues, "Please take care of our 'guests'. I
 got to head down to Wichita Falls to discuss my invention with some
 investors, so you is in charge." The deputy smiles until the sheriff
 adds, "Jimbo, don't screw up," as he heads out the door.

 Jail Cell
 Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow
 after another one of Muddy's dubious plans? Will you ever learn? How
 did it come to this?

 The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
 with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
 above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's
 office.

 A broken stool lies on the floor.

 Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

 In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is
 stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious
 to your presence.

>inventory
 You're carrying your pocketwatch and a scrap of paper. You are wearing
 your hat, pants, overcoat, left boot, and right boot.

 Your revolver was confiscated, it seems.

 Muddy puts his hands in his pockets and seems to be daydreaming.

>examine paper
 Muddy's scribbled instructions for holding up the train, which you
 carried out faithfully before the Sheriff showed up.

 Muddy closes his eyes and rubs his temples.

>read paper
 In smeared scribbles: "DEER RICK, 1. GET DYNA-MITE FROM MTNSIDE, 2.
 INSERT SPARKER, 3. BLOW UP TUNNEL, 4. WAIT FOR ME".

 That was Muddy's cunning plan, and unlike most of his plans, it went
 off without a hitch: you got the silver, nobody got hurt. Yup, not a
 single hitch -- except for getting caught.

 A faint breeze wafts by.

>examine watch
 It's the wind-up timepiece you received when you were commissioned as
 an officer in the Confederate Army. You may have lost everything else
 in that war, but at least you have this fine pocket watch. It
 currently reads eighteen minutes past seven in the evening  -- less
 than thirteen hours until you and Muddy are hanged.

>examine me
 Big boots, pants, a plains hat, a tattered overcoat, and some
 attitude.  Not so different from the uniform you once wore, just more
 lived-in.

 Back in the office, the deputy stares at Muddy.

>examine deputy
 Big and strong, but lacking numerically in ancestors.

 A small stool, with legs a couple of feet long. It's three-legged by
 design, but two-legged in practice, hence its inability to stand
 upright.  There's an empty socket where the third leg should be. All
 of the paint has been worn off the seat by your illustrious
 predecessors who inhabited this cell. Those same occupants carved
 every square inch of the stool's seat with their initials (and the
 initials look intriguing!)  A small bronze plate has been nailed to
 the bottom of the stool.

 Muddy stares out the window.

>read initials
 You notice a set of initials. "It says here, "RH"".

 Muddy nods knowingly, "That'd be Ricochet Howard. Cattle rustling, hog
 hauling and snake twizzling".

 "Snake twizzling?"

 "All right, I made that one up. But the rest is true."

 A couple of other sets of initials catch your eye.

 Over in the office, the deputy sniffles loudly and wipes his nose on
 his sleeve.

>read initials
 "Here's some more initials, Muddy:  S.X."

 Muddy smiles slyly, "Oh sure. That's Sixshooter Xavier, the roughest
 Friar west of the Mississippi. An ornery character with a taste for
 mead, and he plays a mean five-card stud."

 "What'd he do?"

 "Knocked over the Tulsa Casino, but donated it to orphans."

 "That don't sound so bad."

 "They wasn't orphans when he started."

 One other set of initials catches your eye.

>read initials
 "Hey, how about this one, Muddy: MTO. That's a strange one."

 "That's got to be Tymme O'Malley, or the Leprechaun Kid like they call
 him in Kansas. Wicked fast with a rifle."

 "Nah, I said MTO, must be someone else."

 "Nope, that's him all right. Dyslexic as all get out. Feds caught him
 red-handed with a bag of tool."

>examine gate
 (the gate)
 A metal gate stands between you and freedom. The gate is set into the
 metal bars that surround your cell, and its hinges must be internal.
 The gate has a massive padlock that clicked definitively behind you
 when you were thrown into the cell. You've seen banks with poorer
 locks. At least this is a quality institution.

 Back in the office, the deputy reaches into his pocket, produces a
 strip of beef jerky, and chews on it for a while.

>examine padlock
 A cast-iron padlock of diabolical ingenuity. It is like no lock you've
 ever seen.

 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>pick lock
 You don't know how. The thing doesn't even have a keyhole.

 Just to the side of the desk, the metal contraption rumbles for a
 moment and then stops.

>examine contraption
 All bronze and shiny, with lots of pipes, rivets, and flanges, the
 word "Protocappuccinomatic" is engraved on the main body of the
 machine. The device stands about five feet high and must weigh a ton.
 A sturdy iron pipe runs from the machine to the boiler.

>examine man
 The man crumpled in the corner wears black vestments and a pastor's
 necktie. He'd almost look respectable, if it weren't for the immediate
 environment. He reeks of booze and snores loudly. A pamphlet is
 sticking out of his pocket. You don't consider yourself a common
 pickpocket, but it makes you wonder what else he might have on him.

>get pamphlet
 You carefully slip the pamphlet out of the sleeping man's pocket.  He
 almost wakes up, but doesn't.

 "Whatizit?", Muddy rasps.

 On the other side of the jail bars in the office, the deputy runs his
 hand through his sparse hair.

>read it
 You read it aloud:

 "The Prairie Gospel Church of Uncanny Righteousness (copyrighteous
 1871)"

 "For lo, the impetuous and retributive spirit of FINAL JUDGEMENT is
 stirring in the heart of the unfaithful, and a FIERY thunderhead of
 retribution is gathering across the plains of the undeserving, the
 bereft of propriety, and promulgators of heresy, and the scalding hot
 sparks of TRUTH are spraying forth, catching light the arid and HIGHLY
 FLAMMABLE and veritably kerosene-soaked sawdust of the weak-willed.
 And into this fray, the unwholesome BEAST shall arise and the earth
 shall tremble. Its body shall tower above like a mountain, and upon
 the body shall be nineteen heads, each like unto a serpent. Upon each
 head, twelve horns, like that of the ram, the bull, and the elephant,
 say four of each. And upon each horn, sixteen stalks, not unlike
 celery in some respects, yet more flexible, more like the arms of an
 octopus, except being twice as numerous. And upon each stalk, eighty
 eyes, or forty pairs of eyes, if you prefer!"

 Muddy, who had been staring intently at his boot tips, looks up,
 eyebrows knit in concentration. "I don't get it. Why would anything
 need two hundred ninety-one thousand, eight hundred and forty eyes?"

 "What?" you remark, looking up from the pamphlet. "Are you kidding me?
 How could you figure that out?"

 "Don't rightly know. Just something I do. Same way as I know there's
 69,105 railroad ties between here and Muskogee. Ma said I was some
 kind of idiot savage."

 Dumbfounded, you stop reading halfway through the pamphlet to stare
 incredulously at Muddy, who picks his nose. "Yeah, go on. What else's
 it say?"

>read it
 You straighten out the pamphlet and skim it, paraphrasing for Muddy.

 "Well let's see. It keeps going on like that for a ways without really
 saying much. By and by there's this part about a revival meeting. Some
 kind of doxology works, but out in the open, like under a circus tent.
 It says they'll be some preaching, some healing and even some dancing.
 I'd allow it sounds like a right pleasant shindig, it do."

 Muddy pauses. "Can I see that pamphlet a minute?" asks Muddy

 "Ain't you gonna ask me about my plan?" Muddy whispers.

 Muddy scrapes some dust off his boots.

>give pamphlet to muddy
 Muddy grabs it from you, squinting and sounding out words silently
 with his mouth. His eyes open wide in amazement.

 "Pete? Wait a gosh darn... PASTOR Pete? That really him? Hot diggity!"

 Muddy jumps to his feet, runs to the bench and shakes Pete wildly;
 Pete screams and throws his hands into the air, gesticulating to
 heaven as he's awoken from his dream --

 "BEGONE, daemons! The Prince of Piety shall SMITE thee! He who brushes
 the Celestial Cavalier's horses shall not clean the stables of
 PARADISE!"

 The grubby preacher collapses back on the bench, eyes closed and
 snoring before either of you can take a step.

 "This time my plan is surefire -- go ahead, ask me. C'mon." Muddy
 jibes quietly.

>ask muddy about pastor
 There ain't no reply.

 "Ain't you even a speck curious to ask me about my plan?" taunts
 Muddy.

 Muddy tugs down on his vest, which had ridden up a bit.

>ask muddy about pastor pete
 Muddy replies, "Seems mostly harmless."

 "Truthful, Rick," whispers Muddy solemnly, "this ain't like all my
 other plans, this one is iron-clad. Ask me about it. Go ahead."

 Over in the office, the deputy looks tired.

>muddy, count bricks
 You can ASK someone ABOUT something or SHOW something TO someone.

 Muddy vibrates with excitement and gushes, "I got to tell you, Rick,
 or this new plan of mine is going to drive me plumb crazy!"

 "Let's keep this between us, though," he whispers.

 Muddy leans towards you, his face barely an inch from your ear and his
 buzzard-worthy breath even less so from your nose. "Okay, Rick, I'm
 a-going to tell you my plan." Muddy pauses dramatically. "Here it is:
 we got to break out of this jail before we get strunged up."

 "That's it? That's your whole damn plan? That don't count as no plan!"
 you fume.

 "Keep it down, Rick!" Muddy's gaze darts over to your third cellmate.
 "Yeah, that's it for now. It takes time to cook up a good plan. You
 need lots of ingredients."

 "Muddy Charlie," you retort, "I heared you was the worst cook in the
 Confederate Army. Your cooking like as did more damage than Sherman's
 March."

 Muddy gives you a hurt look and sulks in the corner. After a while,
 you regret being so quick-tempered with your old buddy.

>search pastor
>read bronze plate
 You find a tin of chewing tobacco. It looks interesting, so you borrow
 it.

 You read aloud the engraving on the bronze plate: "Donated to the
 Crawdad's Gulch Municipal Hoosegow by the Gunslinger's Widows
 Association, Chapter Forty-One."

 Muddy shakes his head, "They sure are an upstanding organization."

>examine tin
 A rectangular tin of "Spitting Image" chewing tobacco. The cover shows
 a cowboy painting a portrait of an Indian, and true to its name, the
 image on the canvas looks just like the Indian. The tin is closed.

 Pastor Pete throws his head back, howls, and stands on the bench. He
 screams, "The ENVELOPE of KNOWLEDGE is sealed with the WAX of PRIDE
 and impressed by the unwieldy RING of TWISTED ASPIRATIONS, but did
 anyone remember to put the LETTER of CIVILITY in the envelope? Does
 the envelope bear the STAMP of HUMILITY, or is it sent cash on
 delivery? Shall it thusly come to pass that FATE arrives one day in
 our letter boxes, and we find ourselves searching and shuffling
 through piles and piles of ADVERTISING, only to find a bill for a life
 of sinfulness? No! Not if we are quick-witted and change our addresses
 or even our names, and leave no forwarding instructions and nail shut
 our letter box, and saw it down, and cast it in a tall VOLCANO and
 watch it sink into the sulfurous lava. Yea! That might just work!"

 Pastor Pete faints onto the bench and resumes snoring without missing
 a beat.

>open tin
 You open the tin, revealing a wad of tobacco.

>search pastor
 You don't find anything that Pastor Pete wasn't born with.

 Muddy looks like he's about to have a great idea, but then goes back
 to staring at the floor.

>search tobacco
 You don't find nothing at all.

 Pastor Pete curls up into a ball, muttering to himself.

>look
 Jail Cell
 The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
 with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
 above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's
 office.

 A broken stool lies on the floor.

 Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

 In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is
 stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious
 to your presence.

 A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the
 jail bars.

 In the office you can also see the deputy.

>chew tobacco
 (first sticking some in your maw)
 The tobacco is getting juicy and soft.

 The deputy looks annoyed, but says, "Yeah, go ahead, try it out."

 Muddy rubs up and down against the brick wall, scratching an itch.

>examine wall
 The jailhouse walls are made of brightly painted white bricks. The
 bricks still smell like fresh paint.

>examine bricks

 Pastor Pete curls up into a ball, muttering to himself.

>touch bricks
 The walls feel rough and a little bit powdery.

 In the office, the deputy pokes his head out of the office and yells
 at some passersby.

>examine bench
 A long wooden bench made of rough, splintery planks. Under the bench,
 you notice a piece of questionable meat, a spoon and a metallic can.

 Muddy pats down his wild hair but only makes it worse.

 That ain't no verb I got knowledge of.

>take meat, spoon, can
 meat: Yuck. You are holding the rancid meat.

 Fetched.

 spoon: Fetched.

 can of beans: Fetched.

 A cockroach scuttles by, making a detour around Muddy. Cockroaches
 have noses, you figure (not that you smell all that flowery neither).

>take cockroad
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>take cockroach
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>examine can
 A closed metal can labeled "BEANS". On the back, some fine print says,
 "Precooked beans. No claim is made regarding the cardioprotective
 nature of this product. May cause abdominal distension if ingested. No
 fitness of purpose is implied. No warranty is provided for personal or
 other injury, or injury or loss related directly or indirectly to the
 use of this product. By opening this can, you agree to the terms of
 service posted in town."

 Muddy rubs his eyes, "I didn't get a good night's sleep last night
 either. I'm bushed."

 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>inventory
 You're carrying a can of beans, a spoon, a hunk of meat, a tin, a
 pamphlet, your pocketwatch, and a scrap of paper. You are wearing your
 hat, pants, overcoat, left boot, and right boot.

>ask jimbo about padlock
 There ain't no reply.

 Muddy cracks his knuckles loudly.

>examine spoon
 A bent old spoon.

 Pastor Pete bounces from wall to wall. He exclaims, "The ENVELOPE of
 KNOWLEDGE is sealed with the WAX of PRIDE and impressed by the
 unwieldy RING of TWISTED ASPIRATIONS, but did anyone remember to put
 the LETTER of CIVILITY in the envelope? Does the envelope bear the
 STAMP of HUMILITY, or is it sent cash on delivery? Shall it thusly

 leave no forwarding instructions and nail shut our letter box, and saw
 it down, and cast it in a tall VOLCANO and watch it sink into the
 sulfurous lava. Yea! That might just work!"

 Pastor Pete falls onto the bench and falls back to sleep immediately.

>wake pete

 Suddenly, Pastor Pete leaps up and rants, "The desires of an earthly
 PRINCE are met not by gold or myrrh or power over his enemies, but by
 HERRING. Salted, preserved herring from a can. Kippered Herring.
 Sweet, sweet, kippered herring. Who could desire more? Indeed, after a
 few, who could desire more KIPPERED herring, at least for a little
 while, having filled up on the first tin of them? They're indeed
 salty, harmless to you and me, but for a SLUG or snail, lethal. This
 is part of the divine wisdom, and why herrings live in the sea (prior
 to being canned) and slugs do not (and are, therefore, unlikely to be
 canned). To argue with this is sheer madness". He then collapses on
 the bench again and falls fast asleep.

 Over in the office, the sheriff's invention ticks like a clock.

>ask jimbo about invention
 The deputy looks annoyed, but says, "Sheriff Cheney done rigged up
 that machine and the steam whistle, both of them run off that steam
 boiler stove. Near as I can tell, the machine makes coffee, but oh,
 what fine coffee it do make. I can't as much as figure, though, how
 he's paying for all the inventing he does. Well, I guess sheriffs is
 paid more than deputies is."

 Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the boiler
 rumbles for a moment and then stops.

>examine stove
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>sit on stool
 The deputy folds down the warrant he is reading and smiles
 encouragingly, "Please, go ahead. The stool is stronger than it
 looks."

 You carefully climb onto the precariously balanced two-legged stool
 and subsequently find yourself face down on the dusty jail floor.
 Muddy helps you up and brushes you off.

 The deputy laughs himself hoarse. "I declare, that were powerful
 entertaining!" The deputy continues to chuckle to himself, even as he
 turns back to his newspaper, "I said, please go ahead, and he sits on
 it. That were rich. Maybe he'll try again."

 On the other side of the jail bars in the office, the deputy watches
 you with a bored expression.

>examine boiler
 Midway between the jail cell and the door to the sheriff's office
 stands a pot-bellied inferno. Through a small grate on its front, you
 can see flames burning within. Above the combustion chamber, there is
 a round, rivet-studded ball, which in turn leads into a junction. One
 pipe runs sideways to the bronze machine behind the desk, while the
 main pipe runs straight up through the roof. There is a lever at the
 junction which looks like it could swing either towards the front door
 or towards the rear of the office. Right now, it is nearer to neither
 position.

>examine newspaper
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>examine warrant
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>examine dish
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>examine bowl
 A beat-up mining pan full of dents and scratch marks. The bowl seems
 to be nailed (yes, nailed!) to the office floor.

>ask deputy about bowl
 There ain't no reply.

>examine lever
 A swinging metal arm that pivots on the pipe junction. The arm can
 swing towards either the door or the back of the office. Right now, it
 is nearer to neither position.

 Muddy burps loudly and remarks, "Oh, that's much better."

>push lever
 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch the lever.

 Pastor Pete froths at the mouth.

>inventory
 You're carrying a can of beans, a spoon, a hunk of meat, a tin, a
 pamphlet, your pocketwatch, and a scrap of paper. You are wearing your
 hat, pants, overcoat, left boot, and right boot.

>throw tin at lever
 Your throwing arm ain't been any good since the accident with the musk
 ox and the hedge clippers.

>examine watch
 It's the wind-up timepiece you received when you were commissioned as
 an officer in the Confederate Army. It is some small consolation that
 your jailers were so incompetent as to overlook your one treasure. It
 currently reads three minutes past eight in the evening  -- less than
 twelve hours until you and Muddy are looking all so peaceful and
 serene.

 Muddy strokes his whiskers.

>muddy, throw tin at lever
 You can ASK someone ABOUT something or SHOW something TO someone.

 Pastor Pete rolls back and forth on the bench.

>ask muddy about lever
 Muddy replies, "I don't rightly know."

 Muddy rocks back and forth on the balls of his feet.

>give tin to muddy
 Muddy glances at the tin and says, "I ain't got no idea what I'd do
 with a tin. No thanks."

 Over in the office, the deputy inspects his LeMat revolver lovingly.

>examine window
 Pretty far up on the wall, as wide as your shoulders, and secured by
 four vertical iron rods as thick as your thumb. And you have thick
 thumbs. The green tip of a vine pokes in from outside and lies on the
 narrow window sill.

 On the other side of the jail bars in the office, the deputy peeks
 through the jail cell window at the saloon across the street. It's
 clear he'd rather be there.

>examine vine
 Only the leafless tip of a wiry vine pokes into the cell through the
 window.

 Over in the office, the deputy warms his hands near the boiler.

>pull vine
 You yank on the wiry vine and it yanks back. It's too tough to break
 off. From outside the window, you hear the bulk of the plant rustling
 as it swings back and forth.

 In the office, the deputy repeatedly counts his fingers, but is unable
 to get a firm answer.

>pull vine
 You yank on the wiry vine and it yanks back. It's too tough to break
 off. From outside the window, you hear the bulk of the plant rustling
 as it swings back and forth.

>tie vine to can
 You would achieve nothing by this.

>examine meat
 The deputy has been watching you and he smiles sardonically. "I see
 you found your dinner. Or was that last week's dinner? Har, har!"

 You are distracted by his comment and forget what you were doing.

>put meat in bowl
 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch the food
 bowl.

 Back in the office, the deputy makes you nervous as he waves his gun
 back and forth, jerking the barrel up and shaping the words "Pow!
 Pow!" with his lips.

>ask deputy about saloon
 The deputy looks annoyed, but says, "I get my best work done there."

 Muddy seems lost in thought.

>examine left boot
 A cowhide boot that has been rubbed smooth. The heel is worn-down, and
 the spurs have broken clear off.

>examine right boot
 A cowhide boot that has been rubbed smooth. A metal riding spur is
 about ready to fall off the worn-down heel.

 Over in the office, the bronze machine ticks like a clock.

>examine vine
>examine vine
 Only the leafless tip of a wiry vine pokes into the cell through the
 window.

 In the office, the deputy pokes his head out of the office and yells
 at some passersby.

 Only the leafless tip of a wiry vine pokes into the cell through the
 window.

 Muddy spends some time looking over at the machine in the office.

>get spur
 You yank the spur off your right boot, careful not to cut yourself in
 the process.

>cut vine with spur
 That don't work none. What kind of crazy talk is you up to?

>give spur to muddy
 Muddy glances at the spur and says, "I ain't got no idea what I'd do
 with a spur. No thanks."

 Just to the side of the desk, the boiler gurgles and bubbles quietly.

>open beans with spur
 Muddy cranes his neck to see what you're doing. He's never seen
 someone open a can with heel spurs. You slide the spur into the groove
 along the top of the can, and wiggle it back and forth. The can
 revolves, and the lid is nearly sawn off. It is hard to tell which of
 you is more surprised that this worked.

 [Your score has just gone up by five]

 Over in the office, the deputy sniffles loudly and wipes his nose on
 his sleeve.

>examine lid
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>inventory
 You're carrying a spur, a can of beans, a spoon, a hunk of meat, a
 tin, a pamphlet, your pocketwatch, and a scrap of paper. You are
 wearing your hat, pants, overcoat, left boot, and right boot.

 On the other side of the jail bars in the office, the deputy inspects
 his LeMat revolver lovingly.

>examine beans
 An open metal can labeled "BEANS". The can is full of plump,
 glistening, little beans. On the back, some fine print says,
 "Precooked beans. No claim is made regarding the cardioprotective
 nature of this product. May cause abdominal distension if ingested. No
 fitness of purpose is implied. No warranty is provided for personal or
 other injury, or injury or loss related directly or indirectly to the
 use of this product. By opening this can, you agree to the terms of
 service posted in town."

 Pastor Pete sits bolt upright, howls at the moon, and flips back over,
 fast asleep.

>eat beans
 When you were a child, you remember visiting your cousins, who all
 liked beans. Your aunt insisted that if they could eat beans, so could
 you. You choked on them, and coughed them up, and they made fun of
 you. Since then, you don't even like the way they smell. The beans,
 that is. Actually, your cousins are kind of rank too.

 Nonetheless, your stomach is growling and you could do with a meal.

 [You have dealt with a repressed childhood memory in a constructive
 manner, your score just went up by two points]

 Pastor Pete pedals the air with his feet, while making sounds like a
 ringing bell.

>undo
 jail cell
 You done backtracked some.

>score
 You have so far scored 5 out of a possible 24, in 74 turns.

>pull bars
 The deputy looks up from the warrant, annoyed at the distraction.
 "Them jail bars is solid iron, boys. Now stop messing with them. I
 would surely hate to have to shoot you tonight and ruin tomorrow's
 hanging."

>look in can
 The can of beans is empty.

 Over in the office, the deputy warms his hands near the boiler.

>ask deputy about coffee
 The deputy looks annoyed, but says, "Nothing is as good as the coffee
 that comes out of the sheriff's machine."

 Muddy looks around the sheriff's office.

>ask deputy about machine
 The deputy looks annoyed, but says, "Sheriff Cheney done rigged up
 that machine and the steam whistle, both of them run off that steam
 boiler stove. Near as I can tell, the machine makes coffee, but oh,
 what fine coffee it do make. I can't as much as figure, though, how
 he's paying for all the inventing he does. Well, I guess sheriffs is
 paid more than deputies is."

 Pastor Pete spins in the air. He yells, "The SUN ariseth, the MOON
 setteth and the leaves, they do in a chaotic manner blow themselves
 around and around, presuming it is the time of the year for them to do
 so, and that the weather has cooperated. The latter pertaining to the
 leaves, and not so much to the sun and moon, which are independent of
 the WEATHER, except in so far as being observable only when the
 weather permits. So, it seems that the weather itself is somewhat a
 culprit in these matters, but what will a brisk rainstorm do against
 the fiery, hot flames of eternal damnation? STEAM. Yes, steam. Because
 it's not so much the heat, it's the HUMIDITY. Back on your heads, my
 lads!"

 Pastor Pete crumples onto the bench and is soon lost in dreams again.

>look

 The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
 with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
 above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's

 to your presence.

 A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the
 jail bars.

 In the office you can also see the deputy.

>put beans in bowl
 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch the food
 bowl.

>?look in ca

>look in can

>eat beans
 When you were a child, you remember visiting your cousins, who all
 liked beans. Your aunt insisted that if they could eat beans, so could
 you. You choked on them, and coughed them up, and they made fun of
 you. Since then, you don't even like the way they smell. The beans,
 that is. Actually, your cousins are kind of rank too.

 Nonetheless, your stomach is growling and you could do with a meal.

 [You have dealt with a repressed childhood memory in a constructive
 manner, your score just went up by two points]

>undo
 jail cell
 You done backtracked some.

>put can in socket
 Putting the can of beans into the socket don't make a lick of sense.
 Not likely to fit well anyway.

 Not far from your jail cell, the metal contraption puffs some steam
 into the office.

>examine ceiling
 The stucco jailhouse ceiling is too high to touch.

 Outside, there is a brief cloudburst. The wind comes right behind the
 rain.

>stand on bench
 You can't! A pastor is passed out on it. There's no room for you.

 In the office, the deputy looks tired.

>look under bench
 You peek under the bench but don't find anything new.

 Back in the office, the deputy stares at Muddy.

>push pastor

 Suddenly, Pastor Pete leaps up and rants, "The KING of RETRIBUTION
 pales in the actinic flame of REVENGE as the knife cuts through a
 length of string: not unlike the string which wraps a package,
 severing the string not into many pieces, but presuming it is simply
 wrapped once around the package, into a single, long piece (likely
 with a knot, the knot being required to secure the package and BIND it
 to its purpose). And yet, consider, gentlefolk, that the package may
 be wrapped many, many times with twine. Ah, yes, you hadn't considered
 that, had you? Thick, difficult-to-cut twine, or even worse, tape or
 glue. FOR MANY ARE THE STATIONERY ITEMS OF HIS MOST ORNAMENTED
 PULCHRITUDE! AND DEEP ARE THE DRAWERS OF HIS WRITING DESK! AND NOT
 LACKING IN THE LEAST SUPPLY IS HE. Thus, sayeth the worker who labors
 at the post: cut once, measure many times. Enlightenment only comes to
 those to whom it is addressed and properly stamped". He then collapses
 on the bench again and falls fast asleep.

>deputy, make coffee
 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch &lt;illegal

 Pastor Pete murmurs repeatedly, "Kippered herring, please! Kippered
 herring, please! Kippered herring, please!"

 It's the wind-up timepiece you received when you were commissioned as
 an officer in the Confederate Army.  It currently reads twenty-four
 minutes to nine in the evening  -- less than twelve hours until you
 and Muddy are daid.

>wind watch
 That ain't no verb I got knowledge of.

 Muddy takes the can and stares hungrily at the beans.

 Even in the most dire situation, Muddy's appetite remains intact. He
 looks expectantly at you and says, "Rick, got a spoon?"

 Muddy rubs his belly and says, "I reckon I could do with a snack right
 about now."

>give spoon to muddy
 Muddy cracks a gap-toothed smile and says, "Much obliged," before
 digging into the can of beans like a miner hot on a fresh gold vein. A
 couple moments later, he finishes circling the inside of the can with
 the spoon, trying to get every last drop of bean juice into his mouth.
 Afterwards, he places the can and spoon on the floor and rubs his
 stomach with satisfaction.

 Muddy has an aura of well-fed contentment.

 You reckon violence usually is the answer, but maybe not just now.

 Muddy holds his belly and comments, "Got a bit of indigestion, I
 does."

>wait
 Time passes.

 Muddy wraps his arms around his belly, and moans softly, "I might have
 overdone it with them beans."

 The deputy looks up from his reading, curious.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Muddy doubles over, "Rick, you should get to high ground. I'm feeling
 a mite bloated after them beans, and I think you know what's coming!"

 "Where the Sam Hill do you think I'm going to run to, Muddy? We're
 locked up in a hoosegow! Deputy, if'n I was you, I would put some
 distance between Muddy and your nose. "

 The Deputy looks concerned, but confused.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You hear nothing. The smell nearly knocks you out. Vision fades, the
 room spins.

 Muddy whispers in that understated manner of his, "That were a silent
 but deadly."

>examine deputy
 Big and strong, but lacking numerically in ancestors.

 Suppressing the urge to throw up from the smell, the deputy reaches
 over to the whiskey bottle and half drains it on his way out the door.

 The fragrance gradually improves as the universe cools.
 [Your score has just gone up by one]

 Muddy picks some food from between his teeth.

>look
 Jail Cell
 The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
 with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
 above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's
 office.

 A broken stool lies on the floor.

 Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

 In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is
 stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious
 to your presence.

 You can also see an empty can (in which is a spoon) here.

 A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the
 jail bars.

>pull vine
 You yank on the wiry vine and it yanks back. It's too tough to break
 off. From outside the window, you hear the bulk of the plant rustling
 as it swings back and forth.

 Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the
 sheriff's invention percolates.

 The deputy pokes his head back in the office and remarks, "I've about
 had enough of you characters. You can stew in your own juices here. I
 got important things to do over yonder in the saloon. But I reckon I
 would be dairy licked to leave you jokers alone."

 The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to
 the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing
 happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits
 impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the
 doorway, tempted by the dinner bell.

 The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef
 jerky. He pitches it into the dog's bowl, and the bloodhound gobbles
 it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office's
 strange-looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

 "This here's Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be
 vicious when he gets riled up, so don't cross him." Flash slowly
 slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes
 close, and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

 "Flash here's apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him
 funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff's fancy steam
 contraption." The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. "If you boys
 were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, 'ol Flash would yank
 that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff
 installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can
 hear that halfway across town, and if'n I do hear it, then you'll have
 to deal with me *and* Flash." The deputy gives Flash one last pat on
 the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

>give meat to flash
 Flash don't seem interested.

 "That worked out well," says Muddy proudly.

 "For you maybe," you reply. "But I near to lost my lunch what with
 that stench."

 To which Muddy counters, "Ain't much worse than your feet, I reckon."

>put meat in bowl
 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch the food
 bowl.

 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch the food
 bowl.

 Ditched.

>put tobacco on meat
 You need to be holding the tobacco before you can put it on top of
 something else.

 Not far from your jail cell, the metal contraption puffs some steam
 into the office.

 Yuck. You are holding the rancid meat.

 Fetched.

 Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the
 furnace creaks.

 You ain't able to see no such thing.

 I only twigged your meaning as far as hankering to dig the walls.

>give meat to muddy
 Muddy reaches eagerly, but stops just short of taking it. You've never
 seen Muddy turn down food before, so you're not sure how this
 experiment will work out. He sniffs it tentatively, hoping that the
 smell will be better than the sight. His eyes cross and he staggers
 backward, fanning the air and loosening his collar. "I think I'll
 pass," he says weakly."

 That's crazy talk.

 Muddy scratches his leg.

 You teeter momentarily on the stool and then topple face first into
 the floor, like a blacksmith's hammer striking the anvil. This is
 getting old real fast now.
>inventory
 You're carrying a hunk of meat, a spur, a tin, a pamphlet, your
 pocketwatch, and a scrap of paper. You are wearing your hat, pants,
 overcoat, left boot, and right boot.

 Flash shifts his tail by an inch.

>examine overcoat
 The gray riding coat reminds you of past adventures with Muddy
 Charlie: the speckled holes on the side where you caught a shotgun
 blast when a bank transaction done gone awry, the hole on the other
 side from the time you and Muddy got to fooling around with a bow, an
 arrow, and a bottle of whiskey, and the charred, frayed edges of the
 coat from the time you and Muddy were almost burnt as witches. Each
 flaw in the garment reminds you of one of Muddy's plans, each of which
 sounded so reasonable at the time....

 Flash sneezes, but somehow he manages to do it slowly.

>break stool
 You reckon violence usually is the answer, but maybe not just now.

>examine stool
 A small stool, with legs a couple of feet long. It's three-legged by
 design, but two-legged in practice, hence its inability to stand
 upright.  There's an empty socket where the third leg should be. All
 of the paint has been worn off the seat by your illustrious
 predecessors who inhabited this cell. Those same occupants carved
 every square inch of the stool's seat with their initials (and the
 initials look intriguing!)  A small bronze plate has been nailed to
 the bottom of the stool.

 A yellow-fringed surrey trots past the sheriff's office.

>examine surrey
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

 Once upon a time, a stool leg about two feet long must have occupied
 the now empty hole in the stool seat. Without that leg, the stool
 isn't much good.

 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>examine bars
 You look across the street at the saloon. Oh wait, did you mean the
 prison bars? Yeah, probably. Anyhow, the bars to your cell reach from
 floor to ceiling and are made of matte black metal. All except one,
 which is sort of gray in color and as short as a table leg. They are a
 bit under an inch thick, and they are reinforced by three tiers of
 horizontal bars. The gate to your cell is framed in the same black
 metal and inset into this meshwork of bars.

>examine gray bar
 The gray bar is just a shade lighter than the surrounding jail bars.
 You notice that the gray bar is held to the ceiling by a screw the
 size of a railroad spike.

>examine screw
 A large, rusty screw.  It's holding a gray bar in place.

>unscrew it
 Nothing obvious happens.

>unscrew it with spoon
 I only twigged your meaning as far as hankering to unscrew the screw.

>take screw
>pull screw
 The screw is too high for you to reach.

 Pastor Pete stares wide-eyed at the ceiling for a moment and then
 falls back asleep.

 Nothing obvious happens.

 Flash has died. Wait. Sorry. He's just really immobile.

>unscrew gray bar
 Nothing obvious happens.

 Flash has a nightmare and growls quietly before returning to a deep
 slumber.

 Muddy ain't having none of your balderdash.

 Muddy drums his fingers against the wall.

>stand on stool
 You ain't gonna get onto the stool unless it stands solidly on three
 good legs.

 Not far from your jail cell, the metal contraption gurgles and bubbles
 quietly.

>remove boot
 Which all do you mean, the left boot, or the right boot?

>left
 Oh, you really don't want to do that. Not indoors at least. Are you
 sure?

>no
 Muddy murmurs a prayer of thanks to whatever he sometimes prays to
 when he's running away from something bigger or badder than he is.

 Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the
 furnace hisses, venting some steam.

 An unusually capacious, wide-brimmed hat to protect you from the sun.

 Muddy counts the number of stars he can see out the window, divides by
 the number of bars in the jail cell, and takes the natural logarithm.
 "Yup," he says, "that's what I thought."

>remote hat
 That ain't no verb I got knowledge of.

>remove hat
 You take off the hat.

>ask muddy about stars
>SAVE
>cf1
>look in hat
 There ain't no reply.

 Flash starts to rub a flea but then decides it to be too much work.

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

 Ten gallons of nothing. You sure could shove a lot of loot in there,
 you reckon.

 Flash snores loudly, his jowls fluttering with each breath.

 It tastes pretty horrid.

>remove right boot
 There are people within a thousand yards. Are you sure?

>y
 You rock back and forth on the floor, locked in a death struggle with
 your foot. Beads of sweat form on your head, as you struggle to twist
 and pull the boot off. With a sudden sucking pop, the boot relents and
 you tumble backwards.

 Muddy's eyes water as he complains, "Ain't you got no sense of smell
 in that head of yours?"

 To which you reply, "Not after I been downwind of you around feeding
 time, nope. This ain't nothing next to what you can do with a can of
 beans!"

 Flash wakes with a start and sneezes loudly. The fur on his back
 bristles, and he opens his eyes to stare in horror at your feet. He
 backs away, towards the front door. The leash pulls taut. He seems
 caught in the balance between an urge to run away from your stinky
 foot and his own laziness, which holds him to the spot.

>remove left boot
 In some states that would be a felony. Are you sure?

>yes
 You rock back and forth on the floor, locked in a death struggle with
 your foot. Beads of sweat form on your head, as you struggle to twist
 and pull the boot off. With a sudden sucking pop, the boot relents and
 you tumble backwards.

 Muddy's eyes water as he complains, "Not again! My poor nose!"

 One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle.
 Trying not to sniff the air, Flash turns tail and breaks for the door,
 straining against his leash, which is tied to the steam pipe lever.
 The lever swings towards the door, and from the roof you hear the
 ear-splitting drone of a railway steam whistle.

 You agree with Muddy that the deputy is not likely to be in a good
 mood when he arrives, so you put your boots back on.

>put gray bar in socket
 You flip the stool over and wiggle the hollow gray tube into the empty
 socket. It fits perfectly and remains in place when you let go of the
 bar, but you think you could yank the gray bar out again if you needed
 it. You now have a stool with three even legs: two wood, one metal.

 The Deputy slams through the swinging doors to the office, lurching to
 the side as he struggles to put his other leg into his pants. He is
 bare-chested and empty-handed, aside from a nearly drained bottle of
 whiskey.

 The deputy thunders, "What the cluster-chucking blazes is the matter
 here?" The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles the gate
 to make sure it is still locked. In his drunken rage, he doesn't
 notice the missing metal bar.

 Satisfied that you haven't escaped, he pushes the lever back to the
 middle position and warns, "I don't know what you were up to what made
 old Flash trigger-happy, but don't let it happen again."

 "Dumb dog," he mumbles, "I was doing important business." The deputy
 shakes his head in frustration and sets off again towards the door.

>examine stool
 A small stool, with legs a couple of feet long. One of its three legs
 is a piece of gray jail bar, but it seems relatively solid. All of the
 paint has been worn off the seat by your illustrious predecessors who
 inhabited this cell. Those same occupants carved every square inch of
 the stool's seat with their initials (and the initials look
 intriguing!)  A small bronze plate has been nailed to the bottom of
 the stool.

 Pastor Pete pedals the air with his feet, while making sounds like a
 ringing bell.

>sit on stool
 Muddy holds it steady as you climb up. Your head is now even with the
 top of the window.

 Pastor Pete shakes and twists spasmodically.

 You are already high enough up.

 Muddy murmurs to himself about not being able to recall a limerick he
 once heard that had something to do with cowboys and farmers.

>/undo

 You done backtracked some.

>examine window
 Pretty far up on the wall, as wide as your shoulders, and secured by
 four vertical iron rods as thick as your thumb. And you have thick
 thumbs. The green tip of a vine pokes in from outside and lies on the
 narrow window sill.

 The Deputy slams through the swinging doors to the office, lurching to
 the side as he struggles to put his other leg into his pants. He is
 bare-chested and empty-handed, aside from a nearly drained bottle of
 whiskey.

 The deputy thunders, "What the cow-poking sheep-sheering bear-baiting
 turkey-trotting blazes is the matter here?" The deputy surveys the
 office quickly and then rattles the gate to make sure it is still
 locked.

 Satisfied that you haven't escaped, he pushes the lever back to the
 middle position and warns, "I don't know what you were up to what made
 old Flash trigger-happy, but don't let it happen again."

 "Dumb dog," he mumbles, "I was doing important business." The deputy
 waves his fist at you and sets off again towards the door.

>examine gate
 (the gate)
 A metal gate stands between you and freedom. The gate is set into the
 metal bars that surround your cell, and its hinges must be internal.
 The gate has a massive padlock that clicked definitively behind you
 when you were thrown into the cell. You've seen banks with poorer
 locks. At least this is a quality institution.

 Flash basks in the glow of the boiler.

>examine grey bar
 The gray bar is just a shade lighter than the surrounding jail bars.
 You notice that the gray bar is held to the ceiling by a screw the
 size of a railroad spike.

 Muddy murmurs to himself about not being able to recall a limerick he
 once heard that had something to do with cowboys and farmers.

>turn screw
 Nothing obvious happens.

>tie vine to screw
 You would achieve nothing by this.

 Flash nuzzles up to the boiler.

>pull screw
 Nothing obvious happens.

>give tin to paster
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>give tin to pastor

 Suddenly, Pastor Pete leaps up and rants, "The SHIP of INTEGRITY
 floats merrily on the sea of justice, and we on the shore are lapped
 by the waves of righteousness, drizzled upon by the REIGN of
 PROPRIETY, and spat upon by the unyielding sense of honor and
 self-worth that could be extracted from fried food if one had the time
 and inclination to do so. We are doused by a fire brigade of good
 works, immersed in the RIVER of NOBLE DEEDS, pulled under by the
 CURRENT of good will, and drowned within an inch of our very lives in
 the deep, dark well of DUTY. Thus, I say, swimming is something that
 should be learned at an early age, and then avoided". He then
 collapses on the bench again and falls fast asleep.

 Muddy leans against the wall and sighs.

>give tin to muddy
 Muddy glances at the tin and says, "I ain't got no idea what I'd do
 with a tin. No thanks."

 Muddy paces back and forth impatiently.

 The gray bar is loose, but still held in place by a large screw that
 connects it to the ceiling.

 The gray bar is loose, but still held in place by a large screw that
 connects it to the ceiling.

>remove screw
 (first taking the screw)
 The screw is too high for you to reach.

 Muddy hums "Camptown Races", singing the "Doo-Dars" off key. The
 effect is annoying.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>jump
 You dance about like a niner soaked full of nose paint.

>stand on stool
 You ain't gonna get onto the stool unless it stands solidly on three
 good legs.

 Pastor Pete shakes and twists spasmodically.

>lift muddy
 That ain't no verb I got knowledge of.

>snort tobacco
 That ain't no verb I got knowledge of.

>eat tobacco
 (first taking the tobacco)
 You take a pinch of tobacco.

 "Glmph."

 "You didn't just swallow that chaw, did you?" asks Muddy
 incredulously.

 "I reckon I done just that -- and it didn't go down pretty."

 You galoot. You're supposed to chew it. Hain't I learned you nothing?"

>chew tobacco
 (first sticking some in your maw)
 You wonder if tobacco is really good for you, like the doctors say.

 Muddy glances over at you, and seems about to speak, but then walks
 away again.

 That ain't something what you can loiter on.

 A fly buzzes past your ear and lands on the ceiling.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>spit tobacco at bowl
 The tobacco hits the food bowl, but drops off.

 Pastor Pete somersaults from the bench into the center of the jail
 cell. He chants, "The mystery of unfounded knowledge knows not the day
 of its own destruction, nor whence it came. It is a PUZZLE wrapped in
 an enigma, boarded up in a box lined with straw, and surrounded by
 another metal box with RIVETS, and finally an even larger metal box
 that is encased in concrete and thrown into the ocean, where it is
 swallowed by a whale, which is in turn swallowed by a sea turtle of
 unusual proportions. That SEA TURTLE is subsequently swallowed by a
 still larger sea turtle, and from there on, it's turtles all the way
 down!"

 Pastor Pete collapses onto the bench and resumes his previous position
 as if nothing had happened.

>spit tobacco at pete

 Suddenly, Pastor Pete leaps up and rants, "There shall be an
 ACCOUNTING and it shall come swiftly, and with little notice, most
 likely in a four hour time slot in the morning, but perhaps in the
 late afternoon or evening if they're running late. THE WAGES OF SIN
 shall be entered into the ledgers, in duplicate, after first deducting
 the withholdables of sin and carrying over any offsetting credits from
 previous GOOD WORKS, and taking into consideration the INFLATION of
 EVIL, the DEVALUATION of MORALS and the exchange rate with PAGAN
 BELIEFS". He then collapses on the bench again and falls fast asleep.

 Flash half opens one eye and looks at you and Muddy.

>spit tobacco at flash
 (first chewing some tobacco)
 The stomach-churning mass of glistening tobacco pulp splashes on the
 floor, just in front of Flash. His nose twitches, as his finely honed
 bloodhound sense of smell detects tobacco ball. Your stomach churns as
 he stretches lazily forward and laps it up, swallowing it in one gulp
 before falling asleep again.

 Nothing obvious happens.

>spit tobacco at screw
 (first chewing some tobacco)
 You're not keen to spit at anything in the jail cell with you. A man
 don't spit where he lives (excepting maybe on the floor, of course).

 Just to the side of the desk, the boiler gurgles and bubbles quietly.

>spit tobacco at lever
 (first chewing some tobacco)
 The tobacco sails right past the thin lever, hits the boiler pipe and
 slides down, out of sight.

 Flash sniffs his food bowl.

 You're carrying a hunk of meat, a spur, a tin, a pamphlet, your
 pocketwatch, your hat, and a scrap of paper. You are wearing your
 right boot, left boot, pants, and overcoat.

 Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the metal
 contraption puffs some steam into the office.

 Rugged, blue denim.

 Flash raises an ear halfway and then lets it flap back down.

 Jail Cell
 The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
 with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
 above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's
 office.

 A broken stool lies on the floor.

 Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

 In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is
 stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious
 to your presence.

 You can also see an empty can (in which is a spoon) here.

 A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the
 jail bars.

 In the office you can also see Flash.

>ask muddy about harmonica
 Muddy replies, "Give it a toot, Rick."

>play harmonica
 You got to be holding it first.

 Pastor Pete pedals the air with his feet, while making sounds like a
 ringing bell.

>get harmonica
 "I ain't never seen you play the mouth organ, Muddy."

 Your partner turns the harmonica back and forth. "That's 'cuz I ain't
 never learned how," he replies.

 Muddy hands the harmonica to you.

>play harmonica
 Tentatively, you blow a few notes. The bars in the jail cell rattle
 sympathetically.

 "Look at that, boy", Muddy laughs, "I swear that screw up there
 holding that bar is wiggling loose!"

>play harmonica
 Again, the room resonates with the rich and vibrant tones of a bagpipe
 connected to the blowhole of a beluga whale.

 Muddy points excitedly towards the top of the gray bar, "When you
 played, that screw worked its way out more. It's like you got some
 kind of sonic screwdriver or something! I think one more time will do
 it."

 Muddy tugs down on his vest, which had ridden up a bit.

>play harmonica
 The screw vibrates out of the ceiling, rebounds off the concrete floor
 in a shower of sparks, and rolls under the deputy's desk. A hollow
 gray tube falls loose from the upper reaches of the jailbars and lands
 at your feet.

 "You done it!" shouts Muddy.

 Flash drools.

>hollow?
 That ain't no verb I got knowledge of.

>get tube
 You grab the bar.

 You hold it lengthwise and stare down its hollow shaft at Muddy. He
 looks back at you.

 "Don't that just beat all," ponders Muddy.
 [Your score has just gone up by one]

 Flash lazily sniffs the machine.

>look through it
 The bar is a hollow tube, with an inner diameter of about a half-inch.
 If you look carefully, you can see a spiral groove running up the
 length of the inside of the shaft, kind of like a rifle.

 Over in the office, the bronze machine creaks.

 You don't reckon there's much point in that.

 Pastor Pete curls up into a ball, muttering to himself.

>put bar in socket
 You flip the stool over and wiggle the hollow gray tube into the empty
 socket. It fits perfectly and remains in place when you let go of the
 bar, but you think you could yank the gray bar out again if you needed
 it. You now have a stool with three even legs: two wood, one metal.

 Not far from your jail cell, the boiler rumbles for a moment and then
 stops.

>stand on stool
 Muddy holds it steady as you climb up. Your head is now even with the
 top of the window.

>examine window
 Pretty far up on the wall, as wide as your shoulders, and secured by
 four vertical iron rods as thick as your thumb. And you have thick
 thumbs. The green tip of a vine pokes in from outside and lies on the
 narrow window sill.

>look out window
 The jail is at the end of a long street. Directly across the street is
 a saloon, which is open, unlike the stores on both sides of the street
 that have pulled down their shades for the evening. Below the window
 there is a covered barrel; you can almost touch its top. Just to the
 left of the window, a berry-covered vine has grown up the side of the
 building, and pokes in the window, lying on the narrow window sill.

 Up in the sky, you notice a couple of hungry, circling vultures.

 Flash looks admiringly at the dinner bell.

>examine barrel
 It's a weathered oak barrel. You can't tell what's inside it, if
 anything.

>open barrel
 You know, that ain't something you can open.

>examine sill
 A three or four inch wide ledge just inside the small window that
 looks out onto the street.

>take sill
 That ain't hardly what a body would aim to carry about.

>examine berry
 Each berry is plump and red, and got no short of mystery about it.
 Don't look so edible.

>get berry
 You pluck a plump juicy red berry from the part of the vine growing
 outside the window.
 [Your score has just gone up by one]

 Flash gazes at the dinner bell.

>eat berry
 Muddy stops you, "Don't be a coward -- if'n you eat that, you'll sleep
 clear through to the afternoon -- and we only got till eight in the
 "A" of "M" to get out of here."

 Muddy leans against the wall and sighs.

>examine bell
 A shiny silver bell with a black handle. It is hanging on a small hook
 by the doorway.

>throw berry at bell
 Your throwing arm ain't been any good since the accident with the musk
 ox and the hedge clippers.

>give berry to flash
 Flash don't seem interested.

>put berry in bowl
 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch the food
 bowl.

 Flash moves his front leg slightly.

 Muddy shifts around too much for you to even attempt the shot.

>put berry in tube
 You don't have the gray bar in hand.

 Pastor Pete leaps into the middle of the jail cell. He rants, "Blessed
 is the terribly, terribly DISMAL. How glorious in unpleasantness, how
 lovely in loathing, how simply pleasing in depravity. In the whole
 world full of pain and suffering and plagues, not to mention sock
 monkeys and advertising, how refreshing is the endless potential
 bounty of disappointment. How much more character we might build were
 we but marginally more afflicted by adversity, we can only pray. Let
 us extol the joyfulness of misery and cheer the horrifying facts
 underlying the production of sausages, and revel in the lack of things
 we have to celebrate!"

 Pastor Pete dives onto the bench and resumes snoring without missing a
 beat.

>get off stool
 You jump down to the ground again.

 A fly buzzes past your ear and lands on the ceiling.

>unscrew bar
 Nothing obvious happens.

 Muddy drums his fingers against the wall.

>take grey bar
 You yank the gray tube out of the stool's socket.

 Flash keeps an eye on his food bowl.

>put berry in tube
 You drop the berry into the gray tube.

 "Oh, I get it!" nods Muddy, "You're making some kind of berry gun. I
 seen the Injuns do something like that, except you ain't got no darts
 in there to blow at people."

 Pastor Pete froths at the mouth.

>shoot berry at bowl
 The berry hits the food bowl, then bounces away out of sight.

 Muddy murmurs to himself about not being able to recall a limerick he
 once heard that had something to do with cowboys and farmers.

>undo
 jail cell
 You done backtracked some.

>shoot berry at bell
 Ding! The bell is hit so hard that it spins around on the hook several
 times, clanging like a church bell on Sunday.

 The amoeba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps
 immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He
 lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut,
 pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange
 machine.

 The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the
 pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and
 rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid
 squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee
 pervades the office.

 Finding no food in his bowl, Flash snorts perfunctorily and resumes
 his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

 Jail Cell
 The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
 with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
 above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's
 office.

 A broken stool lies on the floor.

 Muddy leans against the wall.

 In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is
 stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious
 to your presence.

 You can also see an empty can (in which is a spoon) here.

 A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the

 The cabinet's door covers the front of the cabinet and opens on brass

 cabinet's uneven glass. Despite the distortion, you see what looks
 like a gun belt some kind of shiny yellow object. Maybe gold, you
 think, hopefully.

>look through bars
 A one-room jailhouse is fitting for this jerkwater town. There's a
 big, wooden desk in the middle of the room. Just behind the desk is a
 fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a
 large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side
 of the desk, there is a weird-looking contraption: clearly, some sort
 of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange-looking
 machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead
 back to town; a small bell hangs on a hook attached to the door.
 Flash's empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of
 your jail cell.

>examine framed
 You ain't able to see no such thing.

>examine picture
 A bombastic portrait of the sheriff, who is dressed in a Napoleonic
 uniform save for the ten gallon hat. In the background, dogs play
 poker.

>examine desk
 A beat-up old wooden desk with time-worn corners, and a pitted,
 scratched surface.

 You flip the stool over and wiggle the hollow gray tube into the empty
 socket. It fits perfectly and remains in place when you let go of the
 bar, but you think you could yank the gray bar out again if you needed
 it. You now have a stool with three even legs: two wood, one metal.

 Flash rolls over and takes a few minutes afterwards to catch his
 breath.

 Muddy holds it steady as you climb up. Your head is now even with the
 top of the window.

 Flash is as still as a statue.

 You pluck a plump juicy red berry from the part of the vine growing
 outside the window.

 A cockroach scuttles by, making a detour around Muddy. Cockroaches
 have noses, you figure (not that you smell all that flowery neither).

 You already got a mighty nice one.

 Muddy pats down his wild hair but only makes it worse.

 It's a weathered oak barrel. You can't tell what's inside it, if
 anything.

 The jail is at the end of a long street. Directly across the street is
 a saloon, which is open, unlike the stores on both sides of the street
 that have pulled down their shades for the evening. Below the window
 there is a covered barrel; you can almost touch its top. Just to the
 left of the window, a berry-covered vine has grown up the side of the
 building, and pokes in the window, lying on the narrow window sill.

 Up in the sky, you notice a couple of hungry, circling vultures.

 They look hungry.  Why else would they circle like that?

>show meat to vultures
 You can only do that to something animate.

 You put the hunk of meat on the window sill and almost immediately, a
 vulture drops from the sky, lands just beneath the window and drags
 the meat outside. You can hear it munching away on the meat, and see
 its tail waving back and forth just outside the window.

>get tail
 That seems to be a part of the vulture.

>pull tail
 Nothing obvious happens.

>tie vine to tail
 You would achieve nothing by this.

 You pluck a feather from the vulture's tail. The bird twists its head
 momentarily to glare at you before plunging back into its task of
 devouring the rotting meat.

 Jail Cell (on the stool)
 The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
 with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
 above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's
 office.

 Muddy leans against the wall.

 In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is
 stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious
 to your presence.

 You can also see an empty can (in which is a spoon) here.

 A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the
 jail bars.

 On the machine is a cup (in which is some coffee).

 In the office you can also see Flash.

>examine can
 An open metal can labeled "BEANS". Unfortunately for Muddy, the can is
 empty. One end of a spoon sticks out of the can. On the back, some
 fine print says, "Precooked beans. No claim is made regarding the
 cardioprotective nature of this product. May cause abdominal
 distension if ingested. No fitness of purpose is implied. No warranty
 is provided for personal or other injury, or injury or loss related

 bowl.

 Pastor Pete shakes and twists spasmodically.

 You yank the gray tube out of the stool's socket, lose your balance,
 topple backwards and plant your face smartly in the prison floor.
 Muddy looks away in embarrassment.

>SAVE

>put berry in tube
 You drop the berry into the gray tube.

 A yellow-fringed surrey trots past the sheriff's office.

>shoot berry at bell
 Your projectile ricochets off the bell with a metallic "ding!"

 Flash reflexively jumps towards his feeding bowl, pulling the lever
 and somehow causing the machine to rattle and buzz. Finding no food,
 the despondent dog returns to his favorite place in front of the
 boiler, shutting off the coffee machine.

>examine coffee
 Steaming hot, black joe.

 Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the
 furnace puffs some steam into the office.

>take coffee
 You can reach through the bars, but not far enough to touch the
 coffee.

 You might use your tube as a blowgun, but it's got an emptiness to it
 right now.

 Muddy looks like he's about to have a great idea, but then goes back
 to staring at the floor.

>shoot berry at cup
 The berry splatters against the side of the cup, and its juice
 dribbles downwards.

 Muddy jumps up, claps you congratulatorily on the back, and you nearly
 swallow the metal tube still held to your lips.

 He beams, "That were a one in a million shot, Rick!"  Muddy strokes
 his chin and wags a finger at the cup, "Now, if we can only get the
 deputy to come back and drink some coffee, he might be a whole lot
 more cooperative, I reckon."

 You sure like the way Muddy thinks.
 [Your score has just gone up by one]

>remove left boot
 Oh, you really don't want to do that. Not indoors at least. Are you
 sure?

>yes
 You rock back and forth on the floor, locked in a death struggle with
 your foot. Beads of sweat form on your head, as you struggle to twist
 and pull the boot off. With a sudden sucking pop, the boot relents and
 you tumble backwards.

 Muddy's eyes water as he complains, "Man, them feets of yours stinks
 powerful bad!"

 Flash wakes with a start and sneezes loudly. The fur on his back
 bristles, and he opens his eyes to stare in horror at your feet. He
 backs away, towards the front door. The leash pulls taut. He seems
 caught in the balance between an urge to run away from your stinky
 foot and his own laziness, which holds him to the spot.

>remove right boot
 In some states that would be a felony. Are you sure?

>yes
 You rock back and forth on the floor, locked in a death struggle with
 your foot. Beads of sweat form on your head, as you struggle to twist
 and pull the boot off. With a sudden sucking pop, the boot relents and
 you tumble backwards.

 Muddy's eyes water as he complains, "Man, them feets of yours stinks
 powerful bad!"

 One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle.
 Trying not to sniff the air, Flash turns tail and breaks for the door,
 straining against his leash, which is tied to the steam pipe lever.
 The lever swings towards the door, and from the roof you hear the
 ear-splitting drone of a railway steam whistle.

 You agree with Muddy that the deputy is not likely to be in a good
 mood when he arrives, so you put your boots back on.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The Deputy slams through the swinging doors to the office, lurching to
 the side as he struggles to put his other leg into his pants. He is
 bare-chested and empty-handed, aside from a nearly drained bottle of
 whiskey. Flash is so scared that he yanks the leash and snaps the
 lever clear off the machine.

 The deputy thunders, "What the saddle sore slapping blazes is the
 matter here?" The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles
 the gate to make sure it is still locked. In his drunken rage, he
 doesn't notice the missing metal bar.

 "Dumb dog," he mumbles, "I was doing important business." He looks
 around for Flash, but the dog has already slid out of the office. The
 deputy gives you a mean look and sets off again towards the door.

 The deputy brightens. "Ummm. I do smell me some coffee." The deputy
 drains the mug with a single gulp. "That's good. I got to wake me up
 some."

 Almost immediately, the deputy spins on his heel and drops to the
 floor just in front of your jail cell.
 [Your score has just gone up by one]

>examine deputy
 You are relieved to find that the deputy is unconscious, but
 breathing. He is wearing only a pair of pants -- no shirt, no gun
 belt, no boots.

 Muddy picks some food from between his teeth.

>search pants
>search deputy
 You rifle through his trouser pockets and find a federal warrant. You
 also find a small brass key. Naturally, you take both.

 You don't find anything else but pocket lint.

>read warrant
 "Muddy, this here's a federal warrant!"

 "What's it say, Rick?"

 I'm a-reading it now: FEDERAL WARRANT. This warrant is issued this
 eleventh day of December in the year of Our Lord Eighteen Hundred and
 Seventy-One and duly executed by the hand of United States Army Major
 General Philip H. Sheridan of Fort Sill, the Indian Territory of these
 United States of America. The fugitives Mudlark Abercromby MacGyver
 alias "Muddy Charlie," alias "Mudshoe," alias "Pensicola Thelma," and
 one Major Richard Carter, alias "Gentleman Rick," alias "Poor
 Richard," alias "Gumball Ricky," both formerly of the Confederate
 States Army, having been implicated by observation and circumstance of
 innumerable delicta, dacoiteries, iniquities, infringements,
 infractions, and indeed immorality, as well as trangressions,
 trespassing and trainstopping, are considered deleterious and
 detrimental to the welfare of the State, and THEREFORE, ordered
 thereupon that a Mittimus be made out to keep them confined until such
 time as they be discharged for proper hanging -- It's signed by the
 General."

 "Mittimus?"

 "I reckon it's after Thanksgiving, before Easter."

 Muddy gives you that familiar old look that always leads to trouble.
 "I got me another cunning plan. C'mon, ask your old buddy Muddy..."
 Muddy leans forward, clearly impatient for you to ask him about his
 latest stroke of (in his opinion) genius.

>ask muddy about plan
 Muddy says excitedly, "Here's my idea: I reckon I could take that
 warrant and forge a different ending. Maybe trick them into releasing
 us."

 "That's a great idea, Muddy, let me get my pen and some ink. Oh, wait
 a minute. I don't have either!" You glare at Muddy.

 "Oh, yeah. I suppose. I didn't think of that." Muddy considers the
 matter. "Maybe we could make one. If you can find something that I can
 use as a pen, I reckon we can squish something or other up to make
 some kind of ink for it."

>give feather to muddy
 "Thanks, partner. That'll make a right proper pen."

 He continues, "To finish this business with the warrant, I'll need
 something to serve as ink."

 Halfway between the door to the outside and your jail cell, the
 sheriff's invention puffs some steam into the office.

>give tobacco to muddy
 (first taking the tobacco)
 You take a pinch of tobacco.

 Muddy reluctantly accepts the tobacco, saying, "Well, I suppose I
 could use the tobacco juice." Muddy chews the tobacco some more, fills
 his makeshift pen with the juice, and throws the wad out the window.

 He continues, "To finish this business with the warrant, I'll need the
 warrant itself."

 A yellow-fringed surrey trots past the sheriff's office.

>give warrant to muddy
 Muddy accepts the document and stares at it for a while, turning it
 this way and that.

 Muddy applies his quill to the paper and with a few flourishes,
 scrawls an additional sentence on the warrant. He blows gently on it
 to dry the "ink" and hands the warrant back to you for your
 inspection.

 A faint breeze wafts by.

 Pastor Pete jumps straight up, immediately animate. He hollers,
 "BLESSED is the snail who crawls its time across the face of the earth
 yet, safe in its routine but for the SALT sprinkled upon him, the salt
 of the earth, well not so much earth per se, earth being dirt, but the
 ocean, which covers it, and would not cover him so lightly were he
 not, like a SLUG, so counterintuitively susceptible to its powers. How
 too we, like the SNAIL, curled in our houses made of our own
 SUBSTANCE, that being what differentiates the two, after all, amongst
 other minutiae, which are neither here nor there, nor relevant to the
 topic at hand, except in such a way as all things are relevant being
 made by HIS HAND, that by the end of such an analysis one must
 conclude not based on the FACTS, yet with the INARGUABLE voice of
 FAITH, which rails against the shackles of REASON itself, having lost
 track of the original THESIS. Which, were it important, chances are,
 we would remember. That is why you see so few slugs these days, at any

 Pastor Pete falls onto the bench and resumes his previous position as
 if nothing had happened.

>put warrant in deputy

>give warrant to deputy
 The deputy groans deeply and curls up into a ball, rolling towards you
 and blinking quickly. His half-focused eyes drift from you to Pastor
 Pete and finally fix on Muddy, who gives him a full-toothed (as many
 as Muddy still has, at any rate) grin.

 The disoriented deputy asks, "What? What in tarnation happened?"

 Muddy takes the initiative, "I reckon you must've drunk some potent
 firewater, deputy. You plumb passed out. Now, why don't you get up and
 let us out, we got work to do -- just like it says on that federal
 warrant."

 The dull-witted deputy, still stunned by the recent turn of events,
 stares at the warrant.

 Muddy leans forward and points out, "Down there, near the bottom. It
 says that we should be discharged to hang up the sheriff's portrait,
 don't it?"

 The deputy yawns and rubs his eyes, "I reckon it do. But I thought you
 was criminals."

 "Oh shucks, no, deputy." Muddy puts on his most endearing smile.
 "Don't you remember the sheriff asking you to take care of his guests?
 We were just staying here overnight. Now, why don't you let us out?
 The sheriff's going to be mad at us all if that picture ain't hung by
 morning."

 The deputy reaches down and does something arcane to the lock. You
 don't quite see what he did, but it clicks open. He slumps wearily
 against the jail bars, and the gate swings open, permitting passage
 eastward into the office.

 There's a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room. Just behind the

 To the side of the desk, there is a weird-looking contraption:
 clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a
 strange-looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two
 swinging doors lead back to town; a small bell hangs on a hook
 attached to the door. Flash's empty dog food bowl is nailed to the
 floor just in front of your jail cell.

 Muddy leans against the wall.

 A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the
 jail bars.

 You can also see the deputy here.

 A broken stool lies on the floor.

 "Good?"

 "A little more..."

 "Now?"

 "There. I'd say it's well-hung."

 Muddy raises his eyebrows, but doesn't say anything.

>examine patent
 A thick technical document describing the coffee machine invented by
 the sheriff. Reading through it, you can see his plans to make these
 machines in factories and to sell them throughout the country. Your
 mind reels in horror at the prospect of coffee shops on every street
 corner selling fancy, steamed beverages.

>examine note
 The note is written in a flowing cursive script. It reads:

 "Dear Sam, I can't go on like this. When you were just a plain old
 sheriff that was one thing, but since you started inventing stuff, I

 for marrying anyone. I thought you were an honest lawman, but I can

 sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange-looking

 Is you talking plain English? I ain't following the words coming out

>out
 Which way? West to the jail cell, or east towards the open range?

>go east
 Muddy relents and says, "All right, Rick. I reckon we done what we can
 do. Let's make for the hills."

 As you head out of the office, two men appear in the doorway: Sheriff
 Cheney and Federal Marshal McLuhan. They are followed by a small
 detachment of U.S. Army guards.

 Sheriff Cheney surges forward, pointing his finger at you and Muddy,
 "It were these two what blown up that train tunnel! They's escaping
 when we walked in! Look, they done killed my deputy! We should drop
 'em where they stand."

 The marshal looks uncertain and waves the army guards forward. They
 train their pistols on you.

 The marshal rests his hand on the sheriff's trigger arm and says,
 "Sheriff, without any evidence to substantiate your accusation
 regarding the train robbery, I was reluctant to see these men hanged
 without a trial. Given the corpse of a lawman in front of us, though,
 even I have to agree that justice should be swift and definitive in
 this instance."

>give receipt to marshal
 You show the marshal the receipt and suggest that the sheriff is quite
 in debt, and might turn to illegal activities to pay it off.

 The marshal looks disappointed and says, "Being in debt is no crime,
 although it does eat away at the soul. Once, I went an entire week
 owing more than five dollars, and I regret it to this day. However,
 there is nothing to suggest that the sheriff has resorted to any
 illegal measures to fund his plans."

 Muddy whispers, "Rick, we ain't got long. I reckon that marshal is
 someone what can be reasoned with."

>give patent to marshal
 You show the patent to the marshal and intimate that the sheriff had
 extensive business plans, far beyond his mandate as a public servant.

 The marshal flips through the patent for the sheriff's invention and
 looks at you questioningly.

 "So?" he asks. "It seems like a clever enough invention, and I presume
 this work was not done on public time, or using town resources. I also
 would guess that he will need some big-time investors to put a plan
 like this into action, but I don't see anything wrong with that. The
 sheriff's a businessman pure and simple. There isn't anything more
 American than a man willing to make a profit, when the profit is there
 for the taking."

 The marshal advises, "Citizens, I am required by federal law as it
 applies to the Territory to advise you that CAPITAL CHARGES have been
 filed against you, and summary execution will take place, unless
 evidence to the contrary can be brought to light."

 The sheriff rolls his eyes, "For the sake of all that's Hog-Tied and
 Rightful, whyn't we shoot 'em dead right here?"

 The marshal looks at Sheriff Cheney and answers, "Because some of us
 believe in maintaining some semblance of due process."

>give note to marshal
 The marshal reads the note and then looks up. He says evenly, "While
 this does speak unkindly of the sheriff, his personal life does not
 interest me. The content of this note is not germane to the matter at
 hand."

 The sheriff wholeheartedly agrees, "Exactly. You is exactly right,
 marshal."

 The marshal looks back at the sheriff with a hint of annoyance.

 Muddy whispers, "We got to show that marshal something. I reckon maybe
 we could make up some kind of excuse or shift the blame, maybe."

>give telegram to marshal
 You show the telegram to Marshal McLuhan, telling him that he'll find
 the sheriff's stagecoach full of stolen silver just behind the jail.

 Sheriff Cheney wipes his brow nervously, "I forgot that's where we
 left that coach. I do reckon I'm always forgetting where I park. I was
 going to mention the silver as evidence any second now."

 The marshal dispatches two guards to search behind the office, and
 when they return with corroboration about the stolen silver, the
 marshal instructs his guards to restrain and disarm the sheriff,
 concluding, "So, now it is clear. The sheriff took advantage of the
 railway incident to rob the train's silver himself in order to finance
 the development of his invention into a business. He framed these two
 itinerant laborers to shift the blame. No wonder he wanted them killed
 so quickly."

 The marshal rips the gold star off Sheriff Cheney's shirt and
 instructs the guards, "Place Mr. Cheney behind bars."

 With a wide yawn, Pastor Pete walks out of the cell as the guards
 wrestle the sheriff past him. "I do reckon I slept like the dead last
 night. Thank you for a peaceful night, deputy," and he walks out the
 front door.

 The marshal raises his eyebrows but continues, "Deputy James Smith
 Bush, by the power invested in me as federal marshal of this district,
 I hereby promote you to Sheriff of the Town of Crawdad's Gulch.
 Congratulations." The newly appointed sheriff grins and shakes his
 hand. The marshal almost pins the star to Jimbo's bare chest, but
 stops short and just hands it to him. The marshal advises him, "James,
 you'll probably want to get yourself some deputies -- men you can
 trust."

 Sheriff Jim looks over to you and Muddy. The color drains from Muddy's
 face.

>amusing
 Congratulations, partner. That sure could have turned a whole mess
 more ugly, but you came out of it with your neck. Before you ride off
 into the sunset, why don't you rest your eyeballs on some of the stuff
 in the game that maybe you ain't run into:

 * There are three ways of driving the deputy out of the jail; how many
 did you find?

 * Did you try reading the initials engraved on the stool?  Repeatedly?

 Some other random trivia:

 * The game is set in the Indian Territory, which would later become
 the Oklahoma territory and subsequently the state. How many references
 can you find to the musical "Oklahoma!"?

 * In the real Old West, it wouldn't have made any sense to put beans
 in a can. They were a cheap staple, transported dry, likely in sacks.

 * Boot spurs were referred to as "can openers" in the Old West.
 Really.

 * The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, but it crossed
 two states to the north of Oklahoma. The first railroads in Oklahoma
 were built in 1870, and the state wasn't crossed until 1871.

 * The espresso machine was invented in 1901 in Italy, but we figured
 that so many Old West movies came from Italy, that it would look
 natural enough in our story.

 * The slang "hoosegow" comes from the Spanish juzgado, which was a
 type of judge tribunal.

 Finally, if you've read this far down the page, you deserve to know
 about the "EASTER EGG" command, which will reveal several alternate
 endings to the story. Explore them at your own risk.

 The sheriff enters the office, shotgun in hand. You and Muddy freeze
 in your tracks and raise your hands in the air. The sheriff kicks the
 prone deputy, who stirs slowly at first, but then jumps to his feet.

 "You." The sheriff points at you. "Your name Muddy?"

 "No. I ain't Muddy," you reply. "That there is Muddy. I is Rick."

 "Damn. What were she thinking?" growls the sheriff. "Mary Sue, you
 come on in here now, you hear?"

 A young woman -- you hesistate to guess her actual age on account of
 propriety -- edges nervously into the office, her eyes cast to the
 ground. By the way she walks, you guess she is in a family way, and
 after she turns towards Muddy, there's no question. Judging by the
 size of her belly, you'd have to say five, maybe six months. She
 raises her eyes to Muddy and her face brightens.

 "Oh, Lordie," mutters Muddy, closing his eyes and running his hand
 over his face. "The one thing I don't plan -- and look what happens."

 Lowering the shotgun, the sheriff walks over and puts his arm around
 Muddy's shoulders. Distributing cigars to you and the deputy, he
 smiles, "Deputy Jimbo, Rick -- I'd like you to meet my new son-in-law,
 Muddy. Ain't that right, Muddy?"

 "I do reckon it's better than a-hanging."

 Muddy never sees it coming. Mary Sue's roundhouse punch lands square
 on his jaw, launching him towards the jail bars like a sack of
 potatoes.

 "Well," you observe, "maybe this marriage just might work out."

 The sheriff's wheelchair rolls up the front ramp, and he enters the
 office with his multicultural posse, who represent the diverse members
 of the community of Endangered Arthropod Valley. Two of the named
 women in his posse discuss a subject other than men. The sheriff draws
 a nonlethal weapon that has not been tested on animals, and waves it
 in a non-threatening manner at you and your partner.

 The deputy finishes his yoga stretches and stands up, draining his
 bottle of health water and setting the recyclable bottle on the
 renewable hardwood desk. "Sheriff, we had a right pleasant evening,
 and I reckon these gentlemen is sincerely regretful of their
 wrongdoings."

 The sheriff agrees, "I do reckon, but they still got to repay their
 crime, even if the blame for that crime ultimately rests on society
 itself, and is the result of a poor educational system and the lack of
 adequate social welfare and state institutions."

 The deputy nods sagely, "How about some community service? The
 Gunslinger's Significant Other Association runs a camp for autistic
 spectrum disorder orphan Native Americans on the outskirts of town. I
 reckon they could use a hand running their cruelty-free all-vegetarian
 farm."

 There is a murmur of agreement from the posse, and the sheriff claps
 the deputy on his back. "That's mighty forward thinking of you,
 James."

 Muddy gives you a distressed look and asks the sheriff, "I reckon I'd
 prefer the hanging. Is that still an option?"

 The sheriff strolls into the office and immediately notices the
 portrait. Hands on his hips, he admires the painting. "I declare, that
 *do* make the office. It breaks up that entire space. That wall were
 so stark and empty before you done hung it. I owe you two a debt of
 sincere gratitude."

 Muddy considers the painting as well and then looks around the room.
 "That seemed the right place to hang it, considering you got all them
 wood tones in the desk and the cabinet, and yonder doorway gives that
 area a bright, natural light most of the day."

 The deputy stirs. "Yeah," he adds, "It's a shame we don't got no
 windows in the office, excepting in the jail cell. I reckon we could
 knock out that front wall and put in a bay window, maybe add a window
 treatment that would soften the room a jot. Also, how about a stencil?
 Something rustic, running as a trim, just below the ceiling."

 You brew four cups of dark, whole-bodied espresso, sprinkling the top
 with nutmeg. The steam curls upward and fills the room with a rich
 aroma. You settle down on the plush wraparound couch that has appeared
 in the office and join the sheriff, the deputy and Muddy in browsing
 through a book of fabric swatches.

 The waving fields of wheat are incinerated in the actinic flame of
 fusion rocket exhaust as a quarter-mile long football-shaped metal
 ship extends its landing pylons and sets down across the street from
 the sheriff's office.

 The sheriff is transfixed by the sight, and the marshal faints
 outright.

 A gangplank extends and a massive cargo door rolls open. A woman in a
 blue flight suit is followed down the ramp by an energetic white dog
 with black spots. She walks to the office and stares at Muddy.

 "Janet?" croaks Muddy dryly. "I didn't expect to see you around these
 parts."

 "I bet you didn't," she replies matter-of-factly. "We have a situation
 in The Belt, grab your saddle bag."

 "I got a buddy, Janet. He's real good with a gun and plays a mean
 harmonica." Muddy turns to you, "Janet, this here is Rick."

 Janet nods and is already walking back to the ship before you can so
 much as say "howdy".

 "What's with her?" you ask.

 Muddy sighs. "It's complicated, I reckon."

 The sheriff walks into the office, followed closely by the marshal.
 The marshal trains his pistol on you while the sheriff examines the
 deputy, who is stretched out on the floor.

 "He ain't dead," the sheriff observes. "But he like as hit his head on
 the bars. Wait a minute." The sheriff leans closer to the prone body.
 "This ain't right. Where he lost some skin, I see scales. Like he were
 a lizard, or something."

 The marshal hisses and swings his gun to cover the sheriff. The
 hissing is echoed by the cadre of soldiers behind the marshal.

 The marshal replies, "A regrettable observation, earthman." He beckons
 some guards forwards. "Glulx, take the sheriff and lock him up. Glk
 and Zil, you go out back and take charge of those iridium discs in the
 stagecoach." Swinging the gun back to you and Muddy, he drawls, "Now,
 as for you two..."

 Muddy laughs lightly and pushes the gun aside, "Heck, Zilch, it's me,
 Ifmud, and this here's Rixyzzy. We was sent after that iridium our own
 selves, but we got captured by the earthmen. Good thing I had a backup
 plan!"
