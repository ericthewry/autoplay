 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence.
 Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that
 something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

 Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound.
 You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

 In the Mud
 Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to
 see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides
 except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed
 sky.

>examine me
 You find you cannot look down at yourself. It is almost as if you know
 what you might find and are afraid to have your fears confirmed.

>examine me
 You find you cannot look down at yourself. It is almost as if you know
 what you might find and are afraid to have your fears confirmed.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>get up
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>examine lightning
 The howling wind sends the clouds racing across the sky. The almost
 constant flashing of lightning illuminates the landscape in stark
 black and white contrast, while the barrage of thunder joins with the
 wind in a mad concaphony.

>stand
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>examine mud
 The sides of the hole are made of dark, rich earth, now soaked through
 by the torrential downpour.  As you watch, more and more mud is washed
 away and into the hole with you.

>climb out
 You can't see any such thing.

>go up
 As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in
 the hole behind you.

 Graveyard
 Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the
 rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an
 unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor
 of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over
 everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an
 ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The
 only exit is through the gate to the east.

 A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the
 impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the
 graveyard.

 A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed
 the grave marker below it.

>examine marker
 The marker for this grave has been shattered by the fall of a large
 branch from the overhanging tree. The grave itself has been disturbed;
 the soil has fallen in to form a shallow pit.

>examine branch
 This large branch has broken off from one of the trees and fallen on
 one of the graves, shattering it's marker.

>take it
 The branch is too large to move, but a smaller limb has broken off and
 is lying nearby.

>take limb
 Taken.

>examine it
 A stout oak limb, about as long as you are tall.

 The marker for this grave has been shattered by the fall of a large
 branch from the overhanging tree. The grave itself has been disturbed;
 the soil has fallen in to form a shallow pit.

>examine church
 The old church has seen better days. Formerly painted white, the
 boards are now faded, peeling and rotted. Most of the windows are
 boarded up, and those that aren't have long since been broken out. The
 shingles have fallen from the roof, which sags alarmingly. A
 broken-tipped steeple rises from one end of the building, and a faint
 miasma of decay seems to rise from the structure.

>examine gate
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine fence
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east

 West Side of the Church
 This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run
 rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on
 to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the
 northeast.

 To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the
 wind.

>examine wall
 Which do you mean, the north wall, the south wall, the east wall, the
 west wall, the northeast wall, the northwest wall, the southeast wall
 or the southwest wall?

>go east
 You see nothing special about the east wall.

>examine weeds
 Diseased looking grasses and weeds surround the church.  In clumps it
 rises to your knees, while in other places it has been beaten to the
 ground by the force of the storm.

>search weeds
 You find nothing of interest.

 Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.

>go east
 There is no entrance into the church on this side.

>exits
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>se

 Front of the Church
 Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the
 front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond
 them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its
 faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the
 church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere
 water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of
 the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a
 hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the
 northwest.

 The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames
 seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.
 A formidable looking guard dog stands here.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

 A blast of thunder rattles the ground.

 "The Awakening" is a text adventure game. You interact with the game
 by typing phrases like EXAMINE CHAIR or OPEN DOOR and the game
 responds by describing the world around you and the results of your
 actions.

 There are certain commands which are common to all adventure games.
 You move around by giving the compass direction in which you want to
 go; for example NORTH or SOUTHEAST. All directions can be shortened to
 one or two letters; in this case N or SE. You can also go UP or DOWN
 (U or D). In some locations IN or OUT work. You can also ENTER or
 CLIMB things.

 When you first enter a location, the game will describe the location
 to you. After that, it will only tell you the name of the location.
 You can see the full description at any time by typing LOOK (or L).
 You can tell the game to always give the full description by entering
 VERBOSE.

 You interact with the environment in many ways. You GET items to pick
 them up and DROP items to put them down. You can also PUT items IN
 things or GET items FROM others. Fairly complex sentences are
 possible, for example GET THE RED BRICK AND THE BLUE BALL FROM THE
 METAL BOX THEN THROW THE BRICK AT THE WINDOW is a valid input.

 You may encounter people or other creatures while exploring the world
 of the game. You can ask these people questions by typing ASK person
 ABOUT topic and tell them things by saying TELL person ABOUT topic.
 You can also SHOW them things. You can ask them to do things with
 PERSON, COMMAND. For example, to ask Bob to pick up the book, type
 BOB, GET THE BOOK.

 To look at an item more closely, EXAMINE it. (EXAMINE can be
 abbreviated as X) To get a list of everything you are carrying type
 INVENTORY (or I). Some other useful commands you can try are PUSH,
 SEARCH, SHAKE, THROW, RUB, KICK, CLIMB or READ. A part of any text
 adventure is learning what words the game knows. "The Awakening" knows
 hundreds of words, so feel free to try anything.

 If you get really stuck, you can access a hint menu at any time by
 typing HINTS. If you would rather not be tempted, you can turn the
 hint feature off by entering HINTS OFF.

 "The Awakening" is my first piece of interactive fiction. It is based
 (very) loosely on several stories by H.P. Lovecraft, most notably "The
 Outsider", "The Terrible Old Man" and "The Two Black Bottles".

 I mainly wrote "The Awakening" as a learning exercise. I had started
 several other games, but they were all too big and I found myself
 becoming overwhelmed by the scope of the game along with learning the
 language. I was inspired to try a smaller game by the Textfire games
 which came out in April of 1998. "The Awakening" became much larger
 than any Textfire, but the inspiration was there.

 It took longer to finish the game than I expected. My main problem
 involved the rope that is encountered in the game. Originally, it was
 far more complex than what is now implemented. Even what is there now
 doesn't work quite as well as I would have liked.

 I hope you enjoy the game. Since it is my first game, feedback is
 especially welcome. At this time (July 1998) my most stable e-mail

 Front of the Church
 Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the
 front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond
 them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its
 faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the
 church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere
 water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of
 the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a
 hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the
 northwest.

 The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames
 seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.
 A formidable looking guard dog stands here.

>examine dog
 This large, solid black dog is chained to one of the oak trees. There
 is something disturbing about the shape of it's head; it seems to be
 too large and slightly misshapen and an unnatural intelligence can be
 seen behind its red eyes.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

>dog, hello
 The dog growls threateningly.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

>pet dog

 The dog snarls and snaps at you as you reach for it and you draw your
 hand back hurriedly.

   a broken limb

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

 Momentarily, the wind and rain slacken then return with renewed force.

>attack dog with limb

>throw limb

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

 With a loud CRACK, a bolt of lightning strikes the steeple of the
 church.

>undo
 Front of the Church
 [Previous turn undone.]

>throw stick
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine trees
 These massive trees are easily hundreds of years old. They tower over
 the front of the church, climbing almost as high as the steeple.
 Unlike the forest surrounding other parts of the grounds they are
 almost unnaturally healthy, their branches clean and straight and
 their leaves a deep rich green.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

>throw limb
 Dropped.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

>get limb
 Taken.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

>examine steeple
 Pointing heavenward like some broken, accusing finger, the steeple
 rises from the front of the church. The steeple ends in a ragged,
 blunt tip; whatever decoration may have once surmounted it is long
 gone.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

>climb trees
 The trunk is too rain-slick to climb.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

 Bristling and growling, the dog blocks your path

 Growling faintly, the dog follows you to the West Side of the Church,
 dragging its chain behind it.

 A blast of thunder rattles the ground.

>examine graves
 You can't see any such thing.

>go west

 Graveyard

 A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the
 impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the
 graveyard.

 A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed
 the grave marker below it.

 Satisfied, the dog wanders off back to the Front of the Church.

>examine boards
 Once, the windows were probably told stories of hope and redemption in
 brightly colored stained glass. Now, they are boarded up as if the
 church has closed it's eyes to the world outside.

>take boards
 The boards are nailed firmly in place.

>examine grave
 The marker for this grave has been shattered by the fall of a large
 branch from the overhanging tree. The grave itself has been disturbed;
 the soil has fallen in to form a shallow pit.

>read grave
 The inscription is no longer legible.

>examine graves
 Dozens of stone slabs mark the final resting places of those who have
 departed. All are old, the inscriptions worn away and covered with
 moss and mold, they tilt at odd angles. Many have fallen and are now
 half buried in the mud.

 Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.

>dig with limb
 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You are only able to dig a few inches before striking rock, and the
 rain rapidly washes more mud in to fill up the hole you make.

 North Side of the Church
 The trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach
 clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild
 here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path
 continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.

 The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

 Satisfied, the dog wanders off back to the Front of the Church.

>se

 East Side of the Church
 This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers
 at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If
 so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and
 grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris.
 Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway,
 which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the
 northwest.

 To the west, the church stares out over the clearing.

>examine debris
 Scattered sticks, leaves and bits of trash cover the gravel clearing.

>search it
 You find nothing of interest.

 Momentarily, the wind and rain slacken then return with renewed force.

>examine trees
 The trees wave wildly in the wind, their twisted limbs seeming to
 reach out to claw at the side of the church. No birds or forest
 animals inhabit their branches; a repellent air surrounds them that
 seems inimical to any such invasion.

>examine weeds
 Diseased looking grasses and weeds surround the church.  In clumps it
 rises to your knees, while in other places it has been beaten to the
 ground by the force of the storm.

 A heavy steel chain.  It has rusted slightly but is still more than

 North Side of the Church

 The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

 Satisfied, the dog wanders off back to the Front of the Church.

 west wall, the northeast wall, the northwest wall, the southeast wall
 or the southwest wall?

 descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

 completely wrapped around the church.  It barks wildly but
 ineffectually at you as you continue on around the corner.

 Church Porch
 This wide, covered porch spans the width of the church front. A white
 picket railing surrounds the porch on three sides, except to the south
 where a short flight of steps leads down to the sidewalk. Two large
 windows have been boarded up but the main doors stand slightly ajar.

 This wide, covered porch spans the width of the church front. A white
 picket railing surrounds the porch on three sides, except to the south
 where a short flight of steps leads down to the sidewalk. Two large
 windows have been boarded up but the main doors stand slightly ajar.

>go north

 Vestibule
 This small room is the entryway for the church. The years of neglect
 are obvious; the floorboards are rotten and warped and what were
 probably once stained glass windows are shattered and boarded up. Dirt
 and debris covers the floor. A set of double doors leads south back to
 the outside while a large archway leads north into the sanctuary.
 Overhead, there is an open trap door in the ceiling at about twice
 your height.

>examine door
 The opening in the ceiling seems to lead to another room overhead, but
 there doesn't seem to be any way to get to it.

 A blast of thunder rattles the building.

>drop ladder
 Dropped.

>climb ladder
 The railing doesn't lead anywhere.

>get ladder
 Taken.

>lean ladder
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put ladder on door
 Putting things on the trap door would achieve nothing.

>go north

 Sanctuary
 Once the heart of the church this room is now cold, dark and empty.
 Debris is scattered among the sagging pews and only shards of broken
 glass remain of the stained glass windows. Most of the interior
 fixtures have been removed, but a large portrait of Christ stares down
 at you from above the archway to the south. The pulpit still stands to
 the north.

 A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the
 boards, followed by a sudden blast of thunder.

>examine portrait
 As you look at the painting, a memory seems to float to the surface of
 your mind.  You remember standing in this church and looking at that
 painting. And you remember it staring back at you, with malevolent,
 vivid green eyes...

>examine pews
 Once, these rows would have been filled with worshippers. Now, they
 only contain dust and debris.

>take painting
 The painting is too high up on the wall to do anything with.

 The building shudders under a sudden gust of wind.

>go north

 Pulpit
 From this raised platform you can see the entire inside of the church.
 The pulpit is empty except for the podium which rises from the center.
 A small door is visible behind the podium to the north.

 The building shudders under a sudden gust of wind.

>examine podium
 This carved wooden podium is where the leader of this church would
 have addressed his or her followers. Now, from the podium, you can
 only see rows of empty pews and a lone painting of Christ, staring
 blankly down from the south wall. A large black book is resting open
 on the podium.

>examine book
 At first you thought this book was a Bible, but now you realize that
 you were mistaken. The large, black, leather-bound tome contains
 passages you find disturbing, and uncomfortably familiar.

 A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the
 boards, followed by a sudden blast of thunder.

>read book
 Much of the book has been damaged by moisture and rats, but some of
 the passages are still legible. One in particular sticks in your
 mind... "The way to understand another is through their eyes, because
 the eyes are the windows of the soul.  Through the eyes the soul may
 seen by those who are sensitive, and through the eyes the soul my be
 taken by those who have pledged themselves to the ones who wait
 beyond."

 A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the
 boards, followed by a sudden blast of thunder.

>take book

 Small Office
 This small office has the same run-down appearance of the rest of the
 church. Debris covers the floor and a trickle of water comes in around
 the boards covering a broken window. A desk stands in the middle of
 the room and an empty bookshelf sits against one wall. A pile of ashes
 marks where a fire once burned in the middle of the floor. A door to
 the south leads back to the sanctuary.

 On the desk is a journal.

 A richly embroidered robe hangs beside the door.

 A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the
 boards, followed by a sudden blast of thunder.

>examine desk
 An old wooden desk. Scarred and water-damaged, it has been here for
 some time.

>search desk
 On the desk is a journal.

>examine journal
 A book of blank pages, the kind that would be used to keep a ledger or
 a journal. Unfortunately, someone has torn out most of the pages and
 only blank sheets remain.

 A blast of thunder rattles the building.

>examine ash
 It seems as if a good sized fire once burned here; it is amazing that
 the entire room did not catch fire. From the occasional bit of
 unburned material it seems as if whoever built the fire was burning
 books, probably from the now empty bookcase. Mixed in with the ashes
 you find a number of jagged shards of glass.

>examine glass
 A number of shards of broken glass lies mixed in with the ashes. From
 the look of the fragments, it was some kind of thick walled bottle
 that was smashed into the floor. A curious object lies in with the
 shards of glass. It looks like a heavy rubber stopper with a chain
 hanging from it.

>take stopper
 Taken.

>take ash
 You pick up a handful of ashes.

>put ash on journal
 (the handful of ashes on the journal)
 As you rub the ashes against the page, the indentations fill in and
 the last entry becomes visible.

>read journal
 You read the last entry from the journal... "I cannot continue. The
 more I come to know her the more I realize that I cannot continue to
 corrupt her.  She was pure and innocent before I took her, and that
 innocence allows her to continue to trust me even after what I have
 done.  I only hope that the taint of that which I have done has not
 stained her irrevocably and that she will go to her proper place after
 I release her... and that I shall go to mine."

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>take journal

 You are carrying:
   a journal
   a handful of ashes
   a heavy stopper

>examine shelves
 A warped, wooden bookshelf.

>examine stopper
 A heavy rubber stopper, such as would be used to close a bottle. Bits
 of wax still cling to the edge showing where the bottle was sealed
 with the stopper in place. A fine chain hangs from the stopper and
 ends in an oddly carved lead weight.

>move bookshelf
 You push the bookshelf to one side, revealing an old book bound in a
 strange reddish cover.

>take old book
 (the old grimoire)
 Taken.

>examine it
 A very old volume, bound in some strange reddish material. At first
 you thought it was leather but it seems to be more closely akin to
 snakeskin. The book seems to be a weird grimoire or spellbook and
 mostly concerns the soul or spirit.

>read it
 The book contains several rituals and procedures all involving the
 soul or spirit.  The first describes a ritual through which the soul
 can be removed from a person's body and placed in a specially prepared
 container. The soul remains in the container even if the person's body
 dies.

 A second ritual can be employed to use the stored soul as a receptacle
 for the sin of another person.  This allows the possessor of another's
 soul to perform any acts they wish without having to answer for those
 acts in the next world.

 Richly embroidered red robes, such as might be worn for ceremonial

 Steeple Chamber
 This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain
 and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame
 and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the
 droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering
 around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports
 that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening
 higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the
 floor.

 A frayed but heavy rope hangs from somewhere overhead.

 Belfry
 The belfry of the church, high up inside the steeple. You are hanging
 from a maze of support beams and trusses with the nearest solid floor
 far below you. Large open frames give a view of the surrounding forest
 and of the town at the base of the hill. They also allow the fury of
 the storm to pass in unimpeded. You can see the branch of an oak tree
 just outside the southern frame.

 A massive bell hangs here, from a damaged mount.
 A heavy rope is attached to the bell and hangs through the beams to
 the room below.

>examine town
 The small town huddles at the base of the hill. A few lights shine
 defiantly against the storm but for the most part it seems quiet, as
 if its inhabitants are waiting inside their homes for the fury to pass
 them by.

>examine tree
 Which do you mean, the oak trees or the tree branch?

>oak
 Which do you mean, the oak trees or the tree branch?

>branch
 The tree branch sways alarmingly in the wind but seems quite sturdy.
 It passes very close to the open window frame in the steeple.

>examine bell
 This massive bell once summoned worshippers to the church. Now, it
 only serves as the home for birds and rodents. The mount for the bell
 has broken on one side, and the other is barely holding on. You are
 surprised that it has not broken free and plummeted from the steeple
 before this.

>hit bell

>kick bell
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 You shove against the bell. For a few seconds, the support takes the
 strain. Then, with a loud cracking noise, the bell tears loose from
 the beam and falls from the steeple. You hear the sound of splintering
 wood from below and then duck aside as the splintered remains of the
 door are pulled past you and out the open window. A metallic crash is
 heard from the ground outside.

 You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence.
 Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that
 something you never knew you possessed has been lost.

 Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound.
 You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.

 In the Mud
 Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to
 see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides
 except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed
 sky.

>go up
 As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in
 the hole behind you.

 Graveyard
 Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the
 rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an
 unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor
 of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over
 everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an
 ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The
 only exit is through the gate to the east.

 A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the
 impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the
 graveyard.

 A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed
 the grave marker below it.

>examine branch
 This large branch has broken off from one of the trees and fallen on
 one of the graves, shattering it's marker.

>take limb
 Taken.

>se
 The graveyard is surrounded on all sides by an iron-barred fence. The
 only exit is through the gate to the east.

 For a brief moment, hail pounds against you then subsides.

>go east

 West Side of the Church
 This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run
 rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on
 to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the
 northeast.

 To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the
 wind.

>se

 Front of the Church
 Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the
 front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond
 them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its
 faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the
 church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere
 water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of
 the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a
 hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the
 northwest.

 The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames
 seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.
 A formidable looking guard dog stands here.

 The dog growls at you threateningly.

>attack dog

 Angered at your attack, the dog charges at you!

 The dog growls and snarls angrily, snapping at your legs.

>go northeast

 East Side of the Church
 This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers
 at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If
 so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and
 grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris.
 Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway,
 which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the
 northwest.

 To the west, the church stares out over the clearing.

 The dog chases madly after you!

>attack dog

 Angered at your attack, the dog charges at you!

 The dog growls and snarls angrily, snapping at your legs.

>go northwest

 North Side of the Church
 The trees close in here, their storm-tossed branches seeming to reach
 clawing limbs towards the back of the church. The weeds have run wild
 here and ivy climbs its way up the back of the building.  A faint path
 continues around the church to the southeast and the southwest.

 The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.

 The dog chases madly after you!

 A blast of thunder rattles the ground.

 The dog lunges after you, but is suddenly jerked to a stop with a

 completely wrapped around the church.  It barks wildly but
 ineffectually at you as you continue on around the corner.

 Vestibule
 This small room is the entryway for the church. The years of neglect
 are obvious; the floorboards are rotten and warped and what were
 probably once stained glass windows are shattered and boarded up. Dirt
 and debris covers the floor. A set of double doors leads south back to
 the outside while a large archway leads north into the sanctuary.
 Overhead, there is an open trap door in the ceiling at about twice
 your height.

>go north

 Sanctuary
 Once the heart of the church this room is now cold, dark and empty.
 Debris is scattered among the sagging pews and only shards of broken
 glass remain of the stained glass windows. Most of the interior
 fixtures have been removed, but a large portrait of Christ stares down
 at you from above the archway to the south. The pulpit still stands to
 the north.

 A simple raised platform at the front of the church, it supports a
 simple wooden podium.

 From this raised platform you can see the entire inside of the church.
 The pulpit is empty except for the podium which rises from the center.
 A small door is visible behind the podium to the north.

 Small Office
 This small office has the same run-down appearance of the rest of the
 church. Debris covers the floor and a trickle of water comes in around
 the boards covering a broken window. A desk stands in the middle of
 the room and an empty bookshelf sits against one wall. A pile of ashes
 marks where a fire once burned in the middle of the floor. A door to
 the south leads back to the sanctuary.

 On the desk is a journal.

 A richly embroidered robe hangs beside the door.

>get ash
 You pick up a handful of ashes.

>put ash on journal

 As you rub the ashes against the page, the indentations fill in and
 the last entry becomes visible.

 A handful of old ashes.

 A flash of lightning can be seen through the cracks between the
 boards, followed by a sudden blast of thunder.

>pile

>examine pile
 It seems as if a good sized fire once burned here; it is amazing that
 the entire room did not catch fire. From the occasional bit of
 unburned material it seems as if whoever built the fire was burning
 books, probably from the now empty bookcase. Mixed in with the ashes
 you find a number of jagged shards of glass.

>examine glass
 A number of shards of broken glass lies mixed in with the ashes. From
 the look of the fragments, it was some kind of thick walled bottle
 that was smashed into the floor. A curious object lies in with the
 shards of glass. It looks like a heavy rubber stopper with a chain
 hanging from it.

>take stopper

 This carved wooden podium is where the leader of this church would

 on the podium.

 Steeple Chamber
 This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain
 and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame
 and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the
 droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering
 around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports
 that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening
 higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the
 floor.

>examine tree
 These massive trees are easily hundreds of years old. They tower over
 the front of the church, climbing almost as high as the steeple.
 Unlike the forest surrounding other parts of the grounds they are
 almost unnaturally healthy, their branches clean and straight and
 their leaves a deep rich green.

 You lean the length of railing against the side of the oak tree.

>climb ladder
 You carefully climb up the length of railing, using the pickets like a

 Top of Oak Tree
 The limbs of the tree are swaying violently from the storm, but near
 the trunk it is a little more stable. You have an excellent view from
 here of the church grounds and surrounding area. The church seems to
 be in a clearing on a hill surrounded by a forest. At the base of the
 hill a small town can be seen, its lights glimmering faintly through
 the storm.

 One of the branches of the tree reaches out to the north towards the

 You shove against the bell. For a few seconds, the support takes the

 shall we say, mad? You always were weak. There was only one thing to
 be done, wasn't there?"

>ask man about girl

>ask man about man

>ask man about dog
 A useful creature. Quite intelligent, you know.

>take bottles
 The blue bottle is warm to your touch as you pick it up. The warmth
 seems to travel up your arm and into the center of your being. It is
 almost as if you have found a missing part of yourself.
 The green bottle has a sickly feel which matches its color. It feels
 like ice, cold and burning at the same time. It is all you can do to
 keep from throwing it down.
 That isn't available.

>open blue bottle
 You peel the wax away from the mouth of the bottle and pull out the
 cork.  A cloud of faintly glowing blue mist rises from the bottle and
 hangs in the air before you. You feel a brief moment of freedom, of
 release.

 Then, you realize that Silas has started chuckling to himself. The
 first jolt of pain hits. The cloud suddenly jerks and starts moving
 downward, as if drawn by a strong suction. The pain intensifies and
 you drop first to your knees, then flat onto the ground as if trying
 to follow the mist, which is now soaking into the earth. The pain
 becomes excruciating. The last thing you see, as everything fades to
 black, is Silas standing over you, laughing...

>climb down

 Front of the Church
 Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the
 front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond
 them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its
 faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the
 church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere
 water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of
 the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a
 hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the
 northwest.

 The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames
 seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.

 The heavy chain stretches from one of the oak trees and around the
 corner of the church to the northeast.

 Vestibule
 This small room is the entryway for the church. The years of neglect
 are obvious; the floorboards are rotten and warped and what were

 the outside while a large archway leads north into the sanctuary.
 Overhead, there is an open trap door in the ceiling at about twice
 your height.

>put ladder under trap
 You carefully place the length of railing under the trap door in the
 ceiling.

>go up

 Steeple Chamber
 This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain
 and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame
 and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the
 droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering
 around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports
 that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening
 higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the
 floor.

 A frayed but heavy rope hangs from somewhere overhead.

 The heavy wooden door to the north is closed.

 The top of the broken section of railing is visible sticking up
 through the trap door in the floor.

 A blast of thunder rattles the building.

>go up

 Belfry
 The belfry of the church, high up inside the steeple. You are hanging
 from a maze of support beams and trusses with the nearest solid floor
 far below you. Large open frames give a view of the surrounding forest
 and of the town at the base of the hill. They also allow the fury of
 the storm to pass in unimpeded. You can see the branch of an oak tree
 just outside the southern frame.

 A massive bell hangs here, from a damaged mount.
 A heavy rope is attached to the bell and hangs through the beams to
 the room below.

>put ladder under tree
 You lean the length of railing against the side of the oak tree.

>climb ladder
 You carefully climb up the length of railing, using the pickets like a
 ladder.

 Top of Oak Tree
 The limbs of the tree are swaying violently from the storm, but near
 the trunk it is a little more stable. You have an excellent view from
 here of the church grounds and surrounding area. The church seems to
 be in a clearing on a hill surrounded by a forest. At the base of the
 hill a small town can be seen, its lights glimmering faintly through
 the storm.

 One of the branches of the tree reaches out to the north towards the
 steeple of the church. An open frame can be seen in the steeple near
 where the branch ends.

>push bell
 You shove against the bell. For a few seconds, the support takes the
 strain. Then, with a loud cracking noise, the bell tears loose from
 the beam and falls from the steeple. You hear the sound of splintering
 wood from below and then duck aside as the splintered remains of the
 door are pulled past you and out the open window. A metallic crash is
 heard from the ground outside.

 You push the curtain aside and pause. On the other side of the curtain
 is a room much like the one you are in. A figure stands in the
 archway, apparently about to enter your room, and it is the sight of
 this figure which has brought you up short. It is, or was, human...
 once. Now, it is a withered mass of decaying flesh. It's clothing
 hangs in tatters and it is caked in mud and grave mold. Patches of
 hair hang from it's scalp and bones are visible in places through it's
 skin. The only thing that remains intact are it's eyes; pale blue and
 now wide open and staring.

 The creature raises its hand to you, and you find yourself doing the
 same. You reach out your arm and touch...



 ...a cold unyielding surface of polished glass.



 Suddenly, the realization of what you are seeing comes home to you,
 and you step back from the mirror with a cry.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>again
 You glance towards the mirror but realize that there is no need to
 enter its reality, for the reality in the mirror is your own.

 You find you cannot look down at yourself. It is almost as if you know
 what you might find and are afraid to have your fears confirmed.

 You hear a loud crash and see a flash of light through the cracks in
 the boards covering the windows.

 The green bottle has a sickly feel which matches its color. It feels
 like ice, cold and burning at the same time. It is all you can do to
 keep from throwing it down.

 On the old sofa is an old man.

 You can also see a heavy wooden table (on which are an oil lantern and
 a blue bottle) here.

>open green bottle
 You peel the wax away from the mouth of the bottle and pull out the
 cork.  The old man suddenly realizes what you are doing.  With a
 scream of "Noooo!", he throws himself towards you knocking over the
 lantern in the process. As he collapses at your feet, a glowing green
 mist rises from the bottle and hangs before him. "No!", he whispers.

 Then, the mist starts moving slowly downward as he doubles over and
 screams in agony. As the mist soaks into the ground, he looks up at
 you and screams, "I'll get my revenge"  I'll see you in hell.  I'LL
 SEE YOU IN HELL! Ia! Ia! Fthagn...  Aaaaagh...!"

 His body collapses to the ground.  As you watch the body blackens and
 decays until, within only a few moments, what is left appears to be a
 many-months old corpse.

 You hear a sudden *Whumph!* and look around. The spilled oil from the
 broken lantern has ignited.  You grab the blue bottle from the table
 and race outside.  You watch for a moment as flames consume the
 church. With a crackling roar, the steeple collapses inward and a
 plume of flame shoots skyward.

 Clutching the bottle to you, you make your way down the hill.

 The book contains several rituals and procedures all involving the

 can be removed from a person's body and placed in a specially prepared
 container. The soul remains in the container even if the person's body
 dies.

 A second ritual can be employed to use the stored soul as a receptacle
 for the sin of another person.  This allows the possessor of another's
 soul to perform any acts they wish without having to answer for those
 acts in the next world.

 taken by those who have pledged themselves to the ones who wait
