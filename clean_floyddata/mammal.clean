 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woods</span>
 This is as deep in the forest as it gets. Nothing but trees all around,
 and only a couple beams of moonlight to see them by.

 There's a dead body here.

 The soil in this tiny clearing feels uncommonly soft.

>examine me

 A little scuffed up from the walk out here, but looking better than
 your friend over there.

>examine soil

 It's too dark to be sure, but this is probably just normal dirt.

>touch soil

 You feel nothing unexpected.

>examine trees

 The trees crowd around you. They almost seem suspicious.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a shovel

>examine shovel

 A long, sturdy shovel of questionable provenance.

>xyzzy

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine me

 A little scuffed up from the walk out here, but looking better than
 your friend over there.

>examine body

 It's a dead body. Its clothes are dirty (on account of being dragged
 through the woods). Its eyes are open, but they aren't looking at
 anything.

>close eyes

 To a person playing a game in text, that probably seems like a poetic
 thing to do, but in person the prospect is kind of really gross.

>search body

 You find nothing of interest.

    Instructions for Play
 This is a game for the Apollo 18+20 project, organized by Herr Kevin
 Von Jackson-Mead. It's based on a dang They Might Be Giants song!

 This game relies a lot on displaying boxed quotations, so if your
 interpreter can't handle that, then, um, maybe you should

 This is as deep in the forest as it gets. Nothing but trees all around,

 There's a dead body here.

 The soil in this tiny clearing feels uncommonly soft.

>examine body

 It's a dead body. Its clothes are dirty (on account of being dragged
 through the woods). Its eyes are open, but they aren't looking at
 anything.

>examine trees

 The trees crowd around you. They almost seem suspicious.

>climb trees

 The trees don't require your attention right now.

>examine body

 It's a dead body. Its clothes are dirty (on account of being dragged
 through the woods). Its eyes are open, but they aren't looking at
 anything.

>kick body

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine eyes

 They look more like two glass eyes.

>take eyes

 That seems to be a part of the dead body.

>attack body

 You give the corpse a stiff kick. To make sure.

>z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. x corpse. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. z. x corpse.
>dig

 You begin digging. Soon you've excavated an area about as long and
 broad as the corpse, and a few inches deep.

>hit body with shovel

 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the dead body.

>examine grave

 That hole's still got a ways to go before it's deep enough.

>dig

 You dig some more. The hole gets deeper. Piles of turned-up soil are
 forming around its perimeter.

>examine grave

 It's starting to look like a real hole.

>enter grave

 You stand in the hole for a little bit, but it's a lackluster
 experience.

>out

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>dig

 You manage to excavate a little more, but after all this digging you're
 exhausted.

>sleep

 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

>rest

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>cuddle up next to corpse

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sleep

 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

>chop up body

 I only understood you as far as wanting to chop up.

>dig

 Your arms are too tired, and you're out of breath. You need to take a
 break before you dig any more.

>wait

 Time passes.

>examine me

 A little scuffed up from the walk out here, but looking better than
 your friend over there.

>dig

 Your arms are too tired, and you're out of breath. You need to take a
 break before you dig any more.

 Well, now your arms are starting to feel like they could handle some
 more digging.

>examine clothes

 The corpse's clothes are stained and ripped beyond repair. You can
 discern a lump in one of the pockets.

>examine lump

 (First reaching in the dead person's pocket and stealing their stuff)
 It's a rock, in kind of a spiral shape.

>examine rock

 It's a rock, in kind of a spiral shape.

>eat rock

 That's plainly inedible.

>examine shape

 At first it just seemed to be a vaguely spiral-shaped rock, but now in
 the spaces between its coils you notice some weird scratches.

>examine scratches

 The scratches are apparently artificial. As you look at them, they seem
 to form some kind of pattern.

>examine pattern

 As you squint more and more at the spiral, the pattern of scratches
 almost makes its significance known to you--but no. It's just just a
 scratched-up rock.

>dig

 You return to your task with renewed vigor. The hole gets deeper.

>dig

 You continue to dig until the hole has become more or less a proper
 grave. Congratulations.

>get in grave

 You get in the grave for a little while. A creepy feeling comes over
 you. You climb out of the grave.

>jump

 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>sing

 Your singing is abominable.

>bury myself alive

 I only understood you as far as wanting to bury yourself.

>cry

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>mourn

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>repent

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>regret

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>weep

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>pick up body

 Having decided that this is the right place, you don't need to carry it
 any further.

>kiss body

 You can only bring yourself to give it a little peck on the cheek.

>put body in grave

 You push the corpse to the edge of the grave and then you shove it in.
 It hits the bottom with a thud.

 You cover it up with dirt until you get bored and walk away.

 And now <span class="floydstyle em">I'm</span> in charge! Thanks for putting my spirit to rest,
 sucker!

 You can go ahead and press a key.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pearly Gates</span>
 I'm in Heaven, in front of the pearly gate, and you're not, so, sucks
 to be you.

 And Saint Peter is here! Awesome!

>examine me

 Who cares what I look like? It's the afterlife! I look like whatever
 the heck I want!

>examine peter

 He's this dude in a robe, with a beard, that kind of thing, and he's
 carrying some keys. He's waving at me, because he knows we're gonna be
 best friends.

>wave at peter

 You can't see any such thing.

>wave

 You wave, feeling foolish.

>inventory

 I am carrying nothing.

>examine keys

 One of them is gold, and the other one is silver. I don't see why this
 one gate needs two keys.

>examine clouds

 Yes obviously there are clouds here. Duh.

>punch peter

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>hug peter

>kiss peter

>examine gold key

 One of them is gold, and the other one is silver. I don't see why this
 one gate needs two keys.

>pray

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take keys

 He doesn't want to give them to me, for whatever reason.

>examine gate

 It's this huge gate, made out of a gigantic pearl. It's pretty amazing.
 I wish you could see it. But you <span class="floydstyle em">can't,</span> because you're alive!

 I don't really care whether you see it or not!

>talk to peter

 Hey, Peter! How about letting me in, man?

 He's not saying anything. He's just getting something out of the
 copious folds of his voluminous robe.

 Oh, hey, it's a medal! For me! For being so great! Thanks, Pete!

>examine medal

 It's this awesome gold medal, and it says "AMICISSIMUS DAMNATORUM,"
 which is Latin.

>wear medal

 Hey guess what? I'll wear it when I feel like it!

 Hold on, Peter is talking now. Press a key, will you?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">*** You have died ***</span>

 Well yes, obviously. That was a while ago. So how about opening that

>bed
 As you straighten out the sheets, you dare to imagine Lisa between
 them. You can't quite fit yourself into the picture, though: she's too
 angelic, untouchable.

 You lay out the pillows tenderly, fold back the bedspread just so.
 Preparing a horizontal throne for your queen.

 You know she'll just drop off your watch and run. Why would she come
 inside? But you have to try.

 You feel like a total slimeball for pulling that trick on her, though.
 What if you're making her late? What if she realizes that you left it
 there on purpose? God, she probably realized immediately and is just
 far too well-mannered to say anything.

 You finish making the bed.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>appreciate lisa
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look in trash
 Put trash in it. Empty it when it is full. Otherwise, leave it be.

>examine suitcase
 You just need to get it out of here.

>take suitcase
 The only real place to put something this big is in the shared storage
 space in your apartment building's attic. As you carry it up the
 stairs, your mind wanders to thoughts of future travel with Lisa.

 You can see her outside an airport, stepping out of a taxi in
 immaculate business attire, striding through the sliding doors as you
 get the luggage and tip the cabbie.

 You see her lounging in a swimsuit by a hotel pool, magazine in hand,
 tanned legs a mile long.

 You see her in your room later that night, towering above you, those
 amethyst earrings dangling...

 Somehow you're back in your room already, the suitcase safely stowed in
 an overhead compartment.

>take clothes
 You don't have nearly enough time to take your clothes to a laundromat,
 so you just shove them under your bed.

>books
 You can't, the shelf is covered in junk mail.

>read mail
 You shuffle through the pile of mail to make sure there's nothing
 important. There isn't. You toss it all in the trash.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 Pleased with your progress, you pause to survey your handiwork.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 Your bedroom. There's no guarantee she'll even step through your front
 door, let alone make it this far, but you want to be sure. It's still a
 mess.

 Your <span class="floydstyle user1">desk</span> is a disaster area.

>empty trash
 No point in taking it out until you've thrown away all the crap in your
 room.

>clean desk
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sigh</span>. This part is your least favorite. You dump all the easy
 stuff in the trash and then begin picking out pieces of paper and
 post-its one by one, trying to remember what the hell various
 passwords, phone numbers, and illegible scribbles were supposed to be
 for.

 A business card catches your eye, and your breath sticks in your
 throat. How could you have left that there? You lift it reverently,
 kiss it. It's hers.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lisa Douglas</span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader"> </span><span class="floydstyle em">Graphic Designer</span>

 Staring into the confident, professional logo she designed for herself,
 you remember every detail of the day she gave it to you. How her hand
 brushed yours as everyone was waiting to be seated at the restaurant.
 The sleek white car she arrived in, and her majestic exit therefrom.
 Her smile as she handed you the card, suggesting that you call her if
 you ever needed an icon, or some snazzy buttons for a website. You know
 she was just being nice - you're pretty sure you could never afford to
 have someone that good work on one of your projects.

 Squirreling the card away in a drawer, you get back to work on your
 desk, thoughts lingering...

 You finish cleaning your desk.

>books
 You arrange them by spine color on your bookshelf. Lisa shared some
 stuff from Things Organized Neatly on facebook recently, so you hope
 she'll appreciate it. Of course, she's the talented graphic designer --
 your amateurish efforts are probably beneath her. Still, you can't help
 but imagine a little smile on her pristine lips as she takes in your
 room...

>examine trash
 Put trash in it. Empty it when it is full. Otherwise, leave it be.

>trash
 You take the trash downstairs and empty it into the streetside bin.
 Setting the empty bin next to your clean desk feels pretty good - your
 room hasn't been this organized in a while!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 You wake up huge.

 Your brain spends a few seconds scrambling after a scrap of dream
 before it admits that your feet really shouldn't be touching the floor
 while your head is still way up here.

>examine me
 am

 You need to get out of bed.

>get out of bed
 am
 I only understood you as far as wanting to get outside.

>go up

 *** Run-time problem P10: Since the up is not allowed the property
 "cleaned", it is against the rules to try to use it.


 You need to get out of bed.

>exit bed
 am
 I only understood you as far as wanting to exit.

>get up
 am
 You're afraid your head will hit the ceiling if you sit up too fast.
 You gingerly roll out of bed onto the floor, and for the first time you
 see your hand, your arm - it's so big, like an enlargement in a
 textbook.

 It's beginning to really sink in, panic clawing away the remnants of
 sleep - you're enormous. It's not a dream, it's terrifyingly real, and
 that sound was your knee splintering your dresser drawer. You start to
 hyperventilate, and your breaths sound like someone breathing into a
 microphone. You want to scream but you're scared of what it will sound
 like.

 You lie on your floor, terrified to move, no clue what to do - at least
 your PJs grew with you, so you're not naked.

 You can hear Paul's watch ticking loudly on your dresser.

>listen
 am
 You're pretty disoriented right now. Probably best to just take a few
 minutes to sort things out.

>examine me

 You're pretty disoriented right now. Probably best to just take a few

>examine watch
 am
 You're pretty disoriented right now. Probably best to just take a few
 minutes to sort things out.

>wait
 am
 After a while your leg starts cramping up. You were kind of hoping this
 would all just go away after a minute somehow, but here you are. Time
 to tough it out and.. what? You can't stand up; you'd break the house.
 Yell for Liz, you guess. What will she do when she sees you? What
 <span class="floydstyle em">should</span> she do? Call the police? The news? She'll probably just
 pass out as soon as she opens the door.

 What'll happen if you just keep lying here? The cramping will get
 worse, for one -- you're going to have to at least roll over soon. You
 tentatively try flexing your leg. It seems to work. Ok. You can do
 this.

 You gingerly lift one leg, shift your weight -- <span class="floydstyle em">creeaaaaak</span> go
 the floorboards -- then lift your arm, roll further... ok. Cool. Your
 leg doesn't hurt anymore. Now what?

 Paul's watch is sitting on your dresser, ticking loudly. You have no
 idea why you're concerned with that right now, but you really feel like
 you should get it back to him. You sit up carefully and reach towards
 it. Your arm extends sickeningly far in front of you, all the way to
 the dresser. You grab for the watch but your fingers are too big. You
 knock it off the top of the dresser and it lands on your leg, where it
 looks absurdly tiny. You try again to pick it up, but you're really not
 used to this - you move your hand too fast and it skitters under the
 bed. Shit. You've got to get it out of there!

>lift bed
 am
 You've got to get that watch!

>move bed
 am
 You can't see any such thing.

>get bed
 am
 You can't see any such thing.

>get wtach
 am
 You can't see any such thing.

>get watch
 There's only a few inches between the bottom of your bed and the floor
 - there's no way you're going to get your arm under there in this
 state. You'll just have to lift it.

 You wedge your fingers under the bed and lift. It's absurdly easy.
 Holding the bed at a 45Ë angle with one hand, you lean under it and
 reach for the watch with the other.

 The watch's ticking suddenly stops. An airy, feathery sensation ripples
 across your skin, and the bed is <span class="floydstyle em">much</span> too heavy, your arm
 buckles - it's shriveling! - and the thick metal frame slams into your
 normal-sized head.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

>wait
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">* * * The world goes black * * *</span>

 "Hmm," says a voice a bit like Paul's, "That's not how I wanted that to
 go."
  You hear the sound of a watch being wound back...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

>look
 You wake from a dream of perfect Lisa. She was larger than life, and
 held you in the loving palm of her hand, and smiled.
 And there was a sense of having tried many times to get it right...

 Ok.

 You're afraid your head will hit the ceiling if you sit up too fast.
 You gingerly roll out of bed onto the floor, and for the first time you
 see your hand, your arm - it's so big, like an enlargement in a
 textbook.

 It's beginning to really sink in, panic clawing away the remnants of
 sleep - you're enormous. It's not a dream, it's terrifyingly real, and
 that sound was your knee splintering your dresser drawer. You start to
 hyperventilate, and your breaths sound like someone breathing into a
 microphone. You want to scream but you're scared of what it will sound
 like.

 You lie on your floor, terrified to move, no clue what to do - at least
 your PJs grew with you, so you're not naked.

 You can hear Paul's watch ticking loudly on your dresser.

>get watch

 You're pretty disoriented right now. Probably best to just take a few
 minutes to sort things out.

>get watch

 You're pretty disoriented right now. Probably best to just take a few

>wait
 After a while your leg starts cramping up. You were kind of hoping this
 would all just go away after a minute somehow, but here you are. Time
 to tough it out and.. what? You can't stand up; you'd break the house.
 Yell for Liz, you guess. What will she do when she sees you? What
 <span class="floydstyle em">should</span> she do? Call the police? The news? She'll probably just
 pass out as soon as she opens the door.

 You had tuned out the oddly-loud ticking of Paul's wach, and become
 aware of it again as it stops. Weird. But before you can think about
 <span class="floydstyle em">that</span> any more, an airy, feathery sensation develops all across
 your skin, and the room leaps away from you.

 You and your PJs have just shrunk back to your normal sizes. Okay. This
 is officially the weirdest day ever.

 Your only evidence is a smashed dresser drawer, though. You always hate
 it when characters in movies refuse to tell people about the magical
 things that happen to them, but now you kinda get it. You have
 absolutely nothing tangible to show for your experience. People really
 would just think you were joking or crazy. And you have
 <span class="floydstyle em">absolutely</span> no clue what happened, and no desire to make it
 happen again. So... you should probably get to work. You spent a long
 time lying around being a giant, and Sanders wants the final version of
 their logo by the end of the day.

 You throw your clothes on in a hurry and rush out without Paul's watch.
 You're pretty sure he left it here on purpose to get you into his house
 anyway. What a loser.

 Liz yells something at you about the garbage disposal as you blow past
 her, and normally you'd care, but you really just need to get out of
 the house right now.

 while your head is still way up here.

 You can't see any such thing.

>look

 You're afraid your head will hit the ceiling if you sit up too fast.
 You gingerly roll out of bed onto the floor, and for the first time you
 see your hand, your arm - it's so big, like an enlargement in a
 textbook.

 It's just beginning to really sink in, panic clawing away the remnants
 of sleep, when you start to feel an airy, feathery sensation all over
 your skin, and the room leaps away from you, and then stillness. And
 the memory of the watch Paul left here ticking away on your dresser.
 Funny, you can't hear it anymore.

 You feel okay to sit up. You appear to be the right size again.

 Your brain really, really wants it to have been a dream. You're
 exhausted from the party. You just need to get dressed and get that
 watch back to Paul before work.

>get watch
 You really just want to get dressed and out the door as quickly as
 possible.

>dress
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>get dressed
 am
 You throw on your clothes as quickly as possible, toss the watch in
 your satchel, and try to look in the mirror for as little time as
 possible. At least your hair is shorter now, so you don't have to deal
 with that.

 Liz is yelling at you from the kitchen about something. You gather
 yourself and step into the hall to see what's up.

 "...all clogged now! You were supposed to take care of this before the
 party, Lisa. Now it's going to take way longer, and.."

 She's talking about the garbage disposal. And it sounds like she tried
 to run it again. Damn it, you don't have time-

 A stretching, burning feeling comes alive all through your body, and
 somehow you think you can hear Paul's antique watch ticking impossibly
 loudly inside your satchel. There's a crack! and you lose vision as
 your head slams into the ceiling. But it doesn't hurt, exactly, and you
 tentatively open your eyes...

 The hallway is in shambles. You've knocked out a segment of the wall
 into Liz's bedroom, and you can see cars going by through her picture
 window. There's weight on your head and shoulders, so you lower your
 head - and a shower of plaster crumbles onto you and the floor.

 Liz is staring from the intact kitchen, her anger about the garbage
 disposal dead on her still-moving lips.

 The satchel grew with you, and it bulges against your side. In your
 mind's eye you can see the watch, expanded inside it to the size of a
 CD. You have to return it! Liz looks like she's about to break her
 shocked silence, and you don't want to be here when that happens.

 The freedom of the street beckons, just one more flimsy wall away to
 the north...

>go north
 am

 You run through the bedroom, throw an arm in front of your face, and
 barrel straight through the window. And some of the window frame.

 Instead of trying to figure out if that hurt, you are struck by the
 strange thought that you ought to have put on those amethyst earrings
 you were wearing last night. The house makes a terrible
 groaning-and-then-cracking sound behind you, and you finally hear Liz
 scream.

 You take off running east down the street. You've never been athletic,
 but it's easy, it's like a movie. Blocks fly by in five or six of your
 enormous strides. You begin to synchronize your steps to the beat of
 Paul's watch, which you can somehow hear from within your satchel.

 A parked car crinkles underfoot, like stepping on tinfoil. You're much
 bigger than before; you can see the tops of two-story houses. The city
 proper, and within it Paul's apartment, loom ahead.

>go north
 am

 *** Run-time problem P10: Since the north is not allowed the property
 "cleaned", it is against the rules to try to use it.


 The road to Paul's apartment is east.

>go east
 am
 You feel increasingly comfortable as you run. You no longer fit on the
 sidewalk, so you're tearing down the middle of the road. The asphalt
 crumbles into satisfying grit beneath your feet, and you dig into it
 and launch yourself forward with each step.

 And then the watch doesn't tick, and your foot doesn't fall, and the
 feathers are all over your body again.

 You've shrunk, but your momentum hasn't, and you're hurtling through
 the air. It's the same terror you used to get when you had falling
 dreams, so you're pretty sure you're about to wake up-

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 You gingerly roll out of bed onto the floor, and for the first time you
 see your hand, your arm - it's so big, like an enlargement in a
 textbook.

 It's beginning to really sink in, panic clawing away the remnants of
 sleep - you're enormous. It's not a dream, it's terrifyingly real, and
 that sound was your knee splintering your dresser drawer. You start to
 hyperventilate, and your breaths sound like someone breathing into a
 microphone. You want to scream but you're scared of what it will sound
 like.

 You lie on your floor, terrified to move, no clue what to do - at least
 your PJs grew with you, so you're not naked.

 You can hear Paul's watch ticking loudly on your dresser.

 You're pretty disoriented right now. Probably best to just take a few

 After a while your leg starts cramping up. You were kind of hoping this
 would all just go away after a minute somehow, but here you are. Time
 to tough it out and.. what? You can't stand up; you'd break the house.
 Yell for Liz, you guess. What will she do when she sees you? What
 <span class="floydstyle em">should</span> she do? Call the police? The news? She'll probably just
 pass out as soon as she opens the door.

 You had tuned out the oddly-loud ticking of Paul's wach, and become
 aware of it again as it stops. Weird. But before you can think about
 <span class="floydstyle em">that</span> any more, an airy, feathery sensation develops all across
 your skin, and the room leaps away from you.

 You and your PJs have just shrunk back to your normal sizes. Okay. This
 is officially the weirdest day ever.

 Your only evidence is a smashed dresser drawer, though. You always hate
 it when characters in movies refuse to tell people about the magical
 things that happen to them, but now you kinda get it. You have
 absolutely nothing tangible to show for your experience. People really
 would just think you were joking or crazy. And you have
 <span class="floydstyle em">absolutely</span> no clue what happened, and no desire to make it
 happen again. So... you should probably get to work. You spent a long
 time lying around being a giant, and Sanders wants the final version of
 their logo by the end of the day.

 You throw your clothes on in a hurry and rush out without Paul's watch.
 You're pretty sure he left it here on purpose to get you into his house
 anyway. What a loser.

 Liz yells something at you about the garbage disposal as you blow past
 her, and normally you'd care, but you really just need to get out of
 the house right now.

 You wake from a dream of perfect Lisa. She was larger than life, and
 held you in the loving palm of her hand, and smiled.
 And there was a sense of having tried many times to get it right...


 Ah, Lisa. She was radiant at the party last night. Your room, by
 contrast, is a fucking mess. And she's going to be here in less than an
 hour!
 <span class="floydstyle blockquote">Part I: Paul</span>

 You drag yourself out of bed, still in the clothes you collapsed in.

 You don't have nearly enough time to take your clothes to a laundromat,
 so you just shove them under your bed.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You've hidden your dirty laundry.</span>  --  9:00 - 9:05

 Your <span class="floydstyle user1">suitcase</span> is sitting out on the floor.

 Your <span class="floydstyle user1">bed</span> is a mess.

 Piles of junk <span class="floydstyle user1">mail</span> cover the only empty shelf in your
 bookcase.

 Your <span class="floydstyle user1">trash</span> can has a few pieces of junk in it.

 There are <span class="floydstyle user1">books</span> strewn about the base of your bookshelf.

 Your <span class="floydstyle user1">desk</span> is a disaster area.

>suitcase
 The only real place to put something this big is in the shared storage
 space in your apartment building's attic. As you carry it up the
 stairs, your mind wanders to thoughts of future travel with Lisa.

 You can see her outside an airport, stepping out of a taxi in
 immaculate business attire, striding through the sliding doors as you
 get the luggage and tip the cabbie.

 You see her lounging in a swimsuit by a hotel pool, magazine in hand,
 tanned legs a mile long.

 You see her in your room later that night, towering above you, those
 amethyst earrings dangling...

 Somehow you're back in your room already, the suitcase safely stowed in
 an overhead compartment.

>mail
 You shuffle through the pile of mail to make sure there's nothing
 important. There isn't. You toss it all in the trash.

>books
 You arrange them by spine color on your bookshelf. Lisa shared some
 stuff from Things Organized Neatly on facebook recently, so you hope
 she'll appreciate it. Of course, she's the talented graphic designer --
 your amateurish efforts are probably beneath her. Still, you can't help
 but imagine a little smile on her pristine lips as she takes in your
 room...

 for.

 A business card catches your eye, and your breath sticks in your

 kiss it. It's hers.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lisa Douglas</span>

 Staring into the confident, professional logo she designed for herself,
 you remember every detail of the day she gave it to you. How her hand
 brushed yours as everyone was waiting to be seated at the restaurant.
 The sleek white car she arrived in, and her majestic exit therefrom.
 Her smile as she handed you the card, suggesting that you call her if

 she was just being nice - you're pretty sure you could never afford to

 You lay out the pillows tenderly, fold back the bedspread just so.
 Preparing a horizontal throne for your queen.

 You know she'll just drop off your watch and run. Why would she come
 inside? But you have to try.

 You feel like a total slimeball for pulling that trick on her, though.
 What if you're making her late? What if she realizes that you left it

 am
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 You wake up huge.

 Your brain spends a few seconds scrambling after a scrap of dream
 before it admits that your feet really shouldn't be touching the floor
 while your head is still way up here.

>dress
 am

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine me
 am
 You need to get out of bed.

>get out
 You're afraid your head will hit the ceiling if you sit up too fast.
 You gingerly roll out of bed onto the floor, and for the first time you
 see your hand, your arm - it's so big, like an enlargement in a
 textbook.

 It's just beginning to really sink in, panic clawing away the remnants
 of sleep, when you start to feel an airy, feathery sensation all over
 your skin, and the room leaps away from you, and then stillness. And
 the memory of the watch Paul left here ticking away on your dresser.
 Funny, you can't hear it anymore.

 You feel okay to sit up. You appear to be the right size again.

 Your brain really, really wants it to have been a dream. You're
 exhausted from the party. You just need to get dressed and get that
 watch back to Paul before work.

>get dressed
 am
 You throw on your clothes as quickly as possible, toss the watch in
 your satchel, and try to look in the mirror for as little time as
 possible. At least your hair is shorter now, so you don't have to deal
 with that.

 Liz is yelling at you from the kitchen about something. You gather
 yourself and step into the hall to see what's up.

 "...all clogged now! You were supposed to take care of this before the
 party, Lisa. Now it's going to take way longer, and.."

 She's talking about the garbage disposal. And it sounds like she tried
 to run it again. Damn it, you don't have time-

 A stretching, burning feeling comes alive all through your body, and
 somehow you think you can hear Paul's antique watch ticking impossibly
 loudly inside your satchel. There's a crack! and you lose vision as
 your head slams into the ceiling. But it doesn't hurt, exactly, and you
 tentatively open your eyes...

 The hallway is in shambles. You've knocked out a segment of the wall
 into Liz's bedroom, and you can see cars going by through her picture
 window. There's weight on your head and shoulders, so you lower your
 head - and a shower of plaster crumbles onto you and the floor.

 Liz is staring from the intact kitchen, her anger about the garbage
 disposal dead on her still-moving lips.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 <span class="floydstyle blockquote">2. Buildings Tumble.</span>
 am
 The satchel grew with you, and it bulges against your side. In your
 mind's eye you can see the watch, expanded inside it to the size of a
 CD. You have to return it! Liz looks like she's about to break her
 shocked silence, and you don't want to be here when that happens.

 The freedom of the street beckons, just one more flimsy wall away to
 the north...

>go north
 am

 You run through the bedroom, throw an arm in front of your face, and
 barrel straight towards the window. You close your eyes as the point of
 impact approaches, but instead of glass you feel the same light,
 feathery sensation you felt when you rolled out of bed. <span class="floydstyle em">Then</span>
 comes the glass.

 You're not moving anymore. You open your eyes. You're lying on the
 front lawn, surrounded by frighteningly large, jagged spears of broken
 glass and a sea of tiny fragments. You're not big anymore. And... oh.
 You really shouldn't have looked at your leg.

 Either the sight of that much blood or the loss of it is too much for
 you.

 angelic, untouchable.

 You lay out the pillows tenderly, fold back the bedspread just so.
 Preparing a horizontal throne for your queen.

 You know she'll just drop off your watch and run. Why would she come
 inside? But you have to try.

 You feel like a total slimeball for pulling that trick on her, though.
 What if you're making her late? What if she realizes that you left it
 there on purpose? God, she probably realized immediately and is just
 far too well-mannered to say anything.

 am
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 You wake up huge.

 Your brain spends a few seconds scrambling after a scrap of dream
 before it admits that your feet really shouldn't be touching the floor
 while your head is still way up here.

>get up

 You're afraid your head will hit the ceiling if you sit up too fast.
 You gingerly roll out of bed onto the floor, and for the first time you
 see your hand, your arm - it's so big, like an enlargement in a
 textbook.

 It's just beginning to really sink in, panic clawing away the remnants
 of sleep, when you start to feel an airy, feathery sensation all over
 your skin, and the room leaps away from you, and then stillness. And
 the memory of the watch Paul left here ticking away on your dresser.
 Funny, you can't hear it anymore.

 You feel okay to sit up. You appear to be the right size again.

 Your brain really, really wants it to have been a dream. You're
 exhausted from the party. You just need to get dressed and get that
 watch back to Paul before work.

>get dressed
 am
 You throw on your clothes as quickly as possible, toss the watch in
 your satchel, and try to look in the mirror for as little time as
 possible. At least your hair is shorter now, so you don't have to deal
 with that.

 Liz is yelling at you from the kitchen about something. You gather
 yourself and step into the hall to see what's up.

 "...all clogged now! You were supposed to take care of this before the
 party, Lisa. Now it's going to take way longer, and.."

 She's talking about the garbage disposal. And it sounds like she tried
 to run it again. Damn it, you don't have time-

 A stretching, burning feeling comes alive all through your body, and
 somehow you think you can hear Paul's antique watch ticking impossibly
 loudly inside your satchel. There's a crack! and you lose vision as
 your head slams into the ceiling. But it doesn't hurt, exactly, and you
 tentatively open your eyes...

 The hallway is in shambles. You've knocked out a segment of the wall
 into Liz's bedroom, and you can see cars going by through her picture
 window. There's weight on your head and shoulders, so you lower your
 head - and a shower of plaster crumbles onto you and the floor.

 Liz is staring from the intact kitchen, her anger about the garbage
 disposal dead on her still-moving lips.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 <span class="floydstyle blockquote">2. Buildings Tumble.</span>
 am
 The satchel grew with you, and it bulges against your side. In your
 mind's eye you can see the watch, expanded inside it to the size of a
 CD. You have to return it! Liz looks like she's about to break her
 shocked silence, and you don't want to be here when that happens.

 The freedom of the street beckons, just one more flimsy wall away to
 the north...

>go north
 am

 You run through the bedroom, throw an arm in front of your face, and
 barrel straight through the window. And some of the window frame.

 Instead of trying to figure out if that hurt, you are struck by the
 strange thought that you ought to have put on those amethyst earrings
 you were wearing last night. The house makes a terrible
 groaning-and-then-cracking sound behind you, and you finally hear Liz
 scream.

 You take off running east down the street. You've never been athletic,
 but it's easy, it's like a movie. Blocks fly by in five or six of your
 enormous strides. You begin to synchronize your steps to the beat of
 Paul's watch, which you can somehow hear from within your satchel.

 A parked car crinkles underfoot, like stepping on tinfoil. You're much
 bigger than before; you can see the tops of two-story houses. The city
 proper, and within it Paul's apartment, loom ahead.

>go east
 am
 You feel increasingly comfortable as you run. You no longer fit on the
 sidewalk, so you're tearing down the middle of the road. The asphalt
 crumbles into satisfying grit beneath your feet, and you dig into it
 and launch yourself forward with each step.

 And then the watch doesn't tick, and your foot doesn't fall, and the
 feathers are all over your body again.

 You've shrunk, but your momentum hasn't, and you're hurtling through
 the air. It's the same terror you used to get when you had falling
 dreams, so you're pretty sure you're about to wake up-

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">* * * You have died * * *</span>

 "Hmm," says a voice a bit like Paul's, "That's not how I wanted that to
 go."
  You hear the sound of a watch being wound back...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 You wake from a dream of perfect Lisa. She was larger than life, and
 held you in the loving palm of her hand, and smiled.
 And there was a sense of having tried many times to get it right...


 Ah, Lisa. She was radiant at the party last night. Your room, by
 contrast, is a fucking mess. And she's going to be here in less than an
 hour!
 <span class="floydstyle blockquote">Part I: Paul</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 You drag yourself out of bed, still in the clothes you collapsed in.
 Better get this mess straightened out quick, so you have time to make
 yourself presentable before she gets here!

>laundry

 You don't have nearly enough time to take your clothes to a laundromat,
 so you just shove them under your bed.

>suitcase
 The only real place to put something this big is in the shared storage
 space in your apartment building's attic. As you carry it up the
 stairs, your mind wanders to thoughts of future travel with Lisa.

 You can see her outside an airport, stepping out of a taxi in
 immaculate business attire, striding through the sliding doors as you
 get the luggage and tip the cabbie.

 You see her lounging in a swimsuit by a hotel pool, magazine in hand,
 tanned legs a mile long.

 You see her in your room later that night, towering above you, those
 amethyst earrings dangling...

 Somehow you're back in your room already, the suitcase safely stowed in
 an overhead compartment.

>desk
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sigh</span>. This part is your least favorite. You dump all the easy
 stuff in the trash and then begin picking out pieces of paper and
 post-its one by one, trying to remember what the hell various
 passwords, phone numbers, and illegible scribbles were supposed to be
 for.

 A business card catches your eye, and your breath sticks in your
 throat. How could you have left that there? You lift it reverently,
 kiss it. It's hers.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lisa Douglas</span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader"> </span><span class="floydstyle em">Graphic Designer</span>

 Staring into the confident, professional logo she designed for herself,
 you remember every detail of the day she gave it to you. How her hand
 brushed yours as everyone was waiting to be seated at the restaurant.
 The sleek white car she arrived in, and her majestic exit therefrom.
 Her smile as she handed you the card, suggesting that you call her if
 you ever needed an icon, or some snazzy buttons for a website. You know
 she was just being nice - you're pretty sure you could never afford to
 have someone that good work on one of your projects.

 Squirreling the card away in a drawer, you get back to work on your
 desk, thoughts lingering...

 You finish cleaning your desk.

>mail
 You shuffle through the pile of mail to make sure there's nothing
 important. There isn't. You toss it all in the trash.

 She's talking about the garbage disposal. And it sounds like she tried
 to run it again. Damn it, you don't have time-

 A stretching, burning feeling comes alive all through your body, and
 somehow you think you can hear Paul's antique watch ticking impossibly
 loudly inside your satchel. There's a crack! and you lose vision as
 your head slams into the ceiling. But it doesn't hurt, exactly, and you
 tentatively open your eyes...

 The hallway is in shambles. You've knocked out a segment of the wall
 into Liz's bedroom, and you can see cars going by through her picture
 window. There's weight on your head and shoulders, so you lower your
 head - and a shower of plaster crumbles onto you and the floor.

 Liz is staring from the intact kitchen, her anger about the garbage
 disposal dead on her still-moving lips.

 am
 The satchel grew with you, and it bulges against your side. In your
 mind's eye you can see the watch, expanded inside it to the size of a
 CD. You have to return it! Liz looks like she's about to break her
 shocked silence, and you don't want to be here when that happens.

 The freedom of the street beckons, just one more flimsy wall away to
 the north...

>wear earrings
 am

 You can't see any such thing.

>go north
 am
 You run through the bedroom, throw an arm in front of your face, and
 barrel straight through the window. And some of the window frame.

 Instead of trying to figure out if that hurt, you are struck by the
 strange thought that you ought to have put on those amethyst earrings
 you were wearing last night. The house makes a terrible
 groaning-and-then-cracking sound behind you, and you finally hear Liz
 scream.

 You take off running east down the street. You've never been athletic,
 but it's easy, it's like a movie. Blocks fly by in five or six of your
 enormous strides. You begin to synchronize your steps to the beat of
 Paul's watch, which you can somehow hear from within your satchel.

 A parked car crinkles underfoot, like stepping on tinfoil. You're much
 bigger than before; you can see the tops of two-story houses. The city
 proper, and within it Paul's apartment, loom ahead.

>go east
 am
 You feel increasingly comfortable as you run. You no longer fit on the
 sidewalk, so you're tearing down the middle of the road. The asphalt
 crumbles into satisfying grit beneath your feet, and you dig into it
 and launch yourself forward with each step.

 And then the watch doesn't tick, and your foot doesn't fall, and the
 feathers are all over your body again.

 You've shrunk, but your momentum hasn't, and you're hurtling through
 the air. It's the same terror you used to get when you had falling
 dreams, so you're pretty sure you're about to wake up-

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">* * * You have died * * *</span>

 "Hmm," says a voice a bit like Paul's, "That's not how I wanted that to
 go."
  You hear the sound of a watch being wound back...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 You wake from a dream of perfect Lisa. She was larger than life, and
 held you in the loving palm of her hand, and smiled.
 And there was a sense of having tried many times to get it right...


 Ah, Lisa. She was radiant at the party last night. Your room, by
 contrast, is a fucking mess. And she's going to be here in less than an
 hour!
 <span class="floydstyle blockquote">Part I: Paul</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 You drag yourself out of bed, still in the clothes you collapsed in.
 Better get this mess straightened out quick, so you have time to make
 yourself presentable before she gets here!

>laundry

 You don't have nearly enough time to take your clothes to a laundromat,
 so you just shove them under your bed.

>suitcase
 The only real place to put something this big is in the shared storage
 space in your apartment building's attic. As you carry it up the
 stairs, your mind wanders to thoughts of future travel with Lisa.

 You can see her outside an airport, stepping out of a taxi in
 immaculate business attire, striding through the sliding doors as you
 get the luggage and tip the cabbie.

 You see her lounging in a swimsuit by a hotel pool, magazine in hand,
 tanned legs a mile long.

 You see her in your room later that night, towering above you, those
 amethyst earrings dangling...

 Somehow you're back in your room already, the suitcase safely stowed in
 an overhead compartment.

>desk
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sigh</span>. This part is your least favorite. You dump all the easy
 stuff in the trash and then begin picking out pieces of paper and
 post-its one by one, trying to remember what the hell various
 passwords, phone numbers, and illegible scribbles were supposed to be
 for.

 A business card catches your eye, and your breath sticks in your
 throat. How could you have left that there? You lift it reverently,
 kiss it. It's hers.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lisa Douglas</span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader"> </span><span class="floydstyle em">Graphic Designer</span>

 Staring into the confident, professional logo she designed for herself,
 you remember every detail of the day she gave it to you. How her hand
 brushed yours as everyone was waiting to be seated at the restaurant.
 The sleek white car she arrived in, and her majestic exit therefrom.
 Her smile as she handed you the card, suggesting that you call her if
 you ever needed an icon, or some snazzy buttons for a website. You know
 she was just being nice - you're pretty sure you could never afford to
 have someone that good work on one of your projects.

 Squirreling the card away in a drawer, you get back to work on your
 desk, thoughts lingering...

 You finish cleaning your desk.

>bed
 As you straighten out the sheets, you dare to imagine Lisa between
 them. You can't quite fit yourself into the picture, though: she's too
 angelic, untouchable.

 You lay out the pillows tenderly, fold back the bedspread just so.
 Preparing a horizontal throne for your queen.

 You know she'll just drop off your watch and run. Why would she come
 inside? But you have to try.

 You feel like a total slimeball for pulling that trick on her, though.
 What if you're making her late? What if she realizes that you left it
 there on purpose? God, she probably realized immediately and is just
 far too well-mannered to say anything.

 You finish making the bed.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 Pleased with your progress, you pause to survey your handiwork.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 Your bedroom. There's no guarantee she'll even step through your front
 door, let alone make it this far, but you want to be sure. It's still a
 mess.

 Your <span class="floydstyle user1">trash</span> can is half full.

 There are <span class="floydstyle user1">books</span> strewn about the base of your bookshelf.

>mail
 You shuffle through the pile of mail to make sure there's nothing
 important. There isn't. You toss it all in the trash.

>books
 You arrange them by spine color on your bookshelf. Lisa shared some
 stuff from Things Organized Neatly on facebook recently, so you hope
 she'll appreciate it. Of course, she's the talented graphic designer --
 your amateurish efforts are probably beneath her. Still, you can't help
 but imagine a little smile on her pristine lips as she takes in your
 room...

 You take the trash downstairs and empty it into the streetside bin.
 Setting the empty bin next to your clean desk feels pretty good - your

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your bedroom</span>
 You wake up huge.

 Your brain spends a few seconds scrambling after a scrap of dream
 before it admits that your feet really shouldn't be touching the floor
 while your head is still way up here.

>get up

 You're afraid your head will hit the ceiling if you sit up too fast.
 You gingerly roll out of bed onto the floor, and for the first time you
 see your hand, your arm - it's so big, like an enlargement in a
 textbook.

 It's just beginning to really sink in, panic clawing away the remnants
 of sleep, when you start to feel an airy, feathery sensation all over
 your skin, and the room leaps away from you, and then stillness. And
 the memory of the watch Paul left here ticking away on your dresser.
 Funny, you can't hear it anymore.

 You feel okay to sit up. You appear to be the right size again.

 Your brain really, really wants it to have been a dream. You're
 exhausted from the party. You just need to get dressed and get that
 watch back to Paul before work.

>get dressed
 am
 You throw on your clothes as quickly as possible, toss the watch in
 your satchel, and try to look in the mirror for as little time as
 possible. At least your hair is shorter now, so you don't have to deal
 with that.

 Liz is yelling at you from the kitchen about something. You gather
 yourself and step into the hall to see what's up.

 "...all clogged now! You were supposed to take care of this before the
 party, Lisa. Now it's going to take way longer, and.."

 She's talking about the garbage disposal. And it sounds like she tried
 to run it again. Damn it, you don't have time-

 A stretching, burning feeling comes alive all through your body, and
 somehow you think you can hear Paul's antique watch ticking impossibly

 The freedom of the street beckons, just one more flimsy wall away to

 You run through the bedroom, throw an arm in front of your face, and
 barrel straight through the window. And some of the window frame.

 Instead of trying to figure out if that hurt, you are struck by the
 strange thought that you ought to have put on those amethyst earrings
 you were wearing last night. The house makes a terrible
 groaning-and-then-cracking sound behind you, and you finally hear Liz
 scream.

 You take off running east down the street. You've never been athletic,
 but it's easy, it's like a movie. Blocks fly by in five or six of your
 enormous strides. You begin to synchronize your steps to the beat of
 Paul's watch, which you can somehow hear from within your satchel.

 A parked car crinkles underfoot, like stepping on tinfoil. You're much
 bigger than before; you can see the tops of two-story houses. The city
 proper, and within it Paul's apartment, loom ahead.

>go east
 am
 You feel increasingly comfortable as you run. You no longer fit on the
 sidewalk, so you're tearing down the middle of the road. The asphalt
 crumbles into satisfying grit beneath your feet, and you dig into it
 and launch yourself forward in time to the watch. As you enter the
 city, you let your hands fly out to your sides. Your palm smacks a
 billboard off its posts and it feels like the world record high-five.

 You become aware of a fast <span class="floydstyle em">thud-thud-thud-thud</span> and lengthen
 your strides. You're downtown now, the glass of fourth-floor office
 windows tinkling pleasantly against your outstretched fingertips to
 either side. The sound is getting louder and it's making you a little
 nervous, but you're so close now. Just up ahead you can see the light
 at Seventh, Paul's street. He's only another eight blocks or so, should
 only take a moment.

 A black threat strobes across your vision.

 Pinpricks in your left shoulder. Two more steps until Seventh.

 More bees, blinking, buzzing, black.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Thud-thud-thud-thud-thud-thud-thud</span>. A deeper counterpoint to
 the ever-present <span class="floydstyle em">tick-tick-tick-tick</span> of the watch.

 You reach out to swat one, connect. It meets a skyscraper and they
 conspire to produce a lovely fireball.

 Something's nagging. The skyscraper groans. You reach the intersection.
 The thing in your bag needs to go back to the place where you're going.
 South.

>go south
 You slam a foot down in the middle of the intersection and pivot to the
 south. As you turn, you see that the skyscraper has begun to crumble in
 on itself, smoke and shrapnel billowing up from its base, filling the
 street. The dust cloud rises to meet you, but too fast- you're falling?
 no- your arms are all feathery again. The debris rushes up past you and
 vertigo takes hold for a moment.

 And then you are you. Tiny, pointless, terrified you, coughing on your
 hands and knees in the middle of the ruined street, lost in the
 swirling, towering dust storm that some other you has summoned. Your
 ears are starting to come back online, with vague reports of screams
 and sirens. And more helicopters.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 Debris blocks the way back, and thick smoke fills the air.

>SAVE

 Ok.

>look
 Fiery debris blocks Seventh to the north, you're sure as hell not
 wading back into the inferno to the west, and the street dead ends to
 the east, so heading south is pretty much your only option. Besides,
 you'd like to see what Paul has to say about this watch...

>go south
 am
 Coughing in the smoke, you make your way south as quickly as possible.
 You can still hear the helicopters, but they're not looking for somone
 your size. Your shoulder isn't badly hurt - the bullets must have
 shrunk to the size of a grain of sand.

 You make it three of the eight blocks to Paul's in a numb haze. The
 streets are filled with shocked, bedraggled citizens, so you fit right
 in. Your mind hasn't even begun to process your place in what happened,
 but there's a big lump of dread waiting for you to snap out of it.

 Then the watch starts ticking, and your skin starts burning.

 <span class="floydstyle em">No!</span> ## NO! A sob escapes you as you break into a run, trying
 to get away from people, from what's happening to you.

 <span class="floydstyle em">This is not me!</span> you try to scream, but your throat is clogged,
 and you're already attracting attention, already towering above the
 other people on the street. You bellow a warning and try not to step on
 anyone. You wipe tears from your enormous eyes, trying to step lightly,
 but you know if you stop the helicopters will find you in moments. Rage
 and fear course through you, and the screams coming up from the ground
 are unutterably wrenching.

 Your foot comes down again, carefully avoiding a parked delivery truck,
 and goes straight through the ground. You trip and topple, and the road
 gives way where you fall, leaving a giant gash right down the middle of
 Seventh. You've caved in some kind of subway mainentance tunnel.

>look
 am
 There's not much to do but get out of this hole.

>get up\
 am
 You can't see any such thing.

>stand up
 You sit up and lever yourself out of the pit. You're directly in front
 of Paul's aparment building.

 You're still big, but you're still you. You can stop this. You push
 away the thought that you must have been still you the last time you
 were big as well. You don't have much time.

 Sitting on the edge of the pit, eyes level with the third story of
 Paul's building, you open your satchel and take out the watch. It's
 about the size of a dinner plate, and still looks fairly small in your
 hand.

 You think you know which one it is. You reach out with your other hand
 and poke a finger through Paul's window. You lean in, and you can see
 him turn around.

 He rushes to the edge of the mess of glass on his floor and stares out
 at you agape.

 You hold up his watch, make sure he understands what it is.

 And then you crush it.

 And then you shrink.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">  - - - - -</span>

 <span class="floydstyle blockquote">Part III: Paul</span>
 <span class="floydstyle blockquote">Light Beams Down From Heaven</span>
 You step up to the window, ignoring the broken glass under your
 slippers. You shield your eyes against the glare of the sunlight
 intruding on your normally dimly lit room and look north up Seventh,
 toward the sirens. You see a black cloud rising above the city.

 That was your watch. A fragment of your dream comes back to you:
 turning back the watch, again and again, trying frantically to avert
 disaster and bring forth the Lisa you desired.

 Lisa is walking towards the door to your building, so you tear yourself
 away from the window and run downstairs. You push open the door and she
 steps into the foyer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atrium</span>
 You stand in a vast glass-ceilinged atrium. The main doors stand behind

 actually need to clear is through the little door to the back rooms,
 behind the information desk to the east. The portrait gallery opens off
 to the west.

 In the centre of the atrium is a huge skip, (or garbage dumpster, if
 you're so inclined), into which you are to place all objects tainted
 with mammalian DNA, or direct organic bi-products of mammals. When the
 job is done, you need only blow the whistle you've been given, and
 Kssshsss will come and assess your execution of the task.

 forbidden.

 A dog is mourning here over the vaporised remains of its owner.

 The dog is one of those really sad looking pugs. You know how you can
 have jolly looking pugs? Well this isn't one of them.

 As much as you'd love to pet the dog, the dog doesn't seem inclined to
 suffer the affection.

>kick dog

 Violence begets violence. Or maybe it begets sentient lizard people.
 Either way, it's not the solution.

>go south

 You really shouldn't stroll off from the museum: that is in direct
 violation of the commands of your lizard overlords.

>take dog

 The dog growls at you, and refuses to be budged from the remains of its

 You are a lowly human slave, suffering beneath the squamous toes of
 your new lizard overlords. Patrisnake Kssshsss has charged you with
 getting rid of all trace of mammals in the back rooms of the Don
 Quixote Memorial Museum.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atrium</span>
 You stand in a vast glass-ceilinged atrium. The main doors stand behind
 you to the south, in front is the rest of the museum. The part that you
 actually need to clear is through the little door to the back rooms,
 behind the information desk to the east. The portrait gallery opens off
 to the west.

 In the centre of the atrium is a huge skip, (or garbage dumpster, if
 you're so inclined), into which you are to place all objects tainted
 with mammalian DNA, or direct organic bi-products of mammals. Your
 co-slaves have already gone through most of museum, including
 thankfully, the toilets. When the job is done, you need only blow the
 whistle you've been given, and Kssshsss will come and assess your
 execution of the task.

>go north

 The rest of the museum has been cleared already, your job lies in the
 back room through the little door to the east.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Museum Steps</span>
 You are greeted by a sunny day on the steps of the museum. The grand
 entrance looms up to the north, while steps radiate out in all other
 directions. Going in such directions would, of course, be highly
 forbidden.

 A dog is mourning here over the vaporised remains of its owner.

>go south

 You really shouldn't stroll off from the museum: that is in direct
 violation of the commands of your lizard overlords.

>go south

 You boldly stride beyond the confines of the museum, rebelling against
 your less-than-benevolent overlords.



     ## *** You Are Free ***


 In that game you scored 15 out of a possible 14, in 4 turns, earning
 you the rank of one who has done a runner.

 He's up to something. I can always tell. I can just feel it, like a
 sixth sense. I know him that well. In a sense, we have the same brain.

 After last night's all-nighter (I had an important report to do for
 work), I intended to sleep all through the day. But I can't afford to
 do that. Somewhere out there, my evil twin is plying his schemes, and
 I'm the only one who can stop him.

 My Evil Twin
 A Musical Adaptation by Carl Muckenhoupt

 Type ABOUT for more details and instructions for play.

 My Apartment
 This studio apartment, located conveniently near work and right across
 the street from the park, serves as my personal headquarters for my
 hobbies, such as doing volunteer restoration work for the local
 American History Museum and foiling the plots of my evil twin. My only
 real attempt at decoration is a framed poster right next to the
 bookshelf. I can leave to the north.

 I can see a presidential figurine and a stack of papers here.

>examine me
 I look exactly like myself.

>inventory
 I am carrying nothing.

>examine figurine
 It's a likeness of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United
 States. Harrison may not have been one of our more exciting presidents
 - he's certainly no James K. Polk - but he did do something that no
 other president has done. Generally speaking, once a president loses
 re-election, he doesn't bother running again, because everyone knows
 that no one votes for a loser. But Harrison's economic policies were so
 monumentally unpopular that the incumbent he defeated in 1888, Grover
 Cleveland, was actually able to mount a successful challenge to him in
 1892. Cleveland is thus considered to be both the 22nd and 24th
 president. I've always liked that anomaly, and without Harrison's
 particular blend of win and lame, it wouldn't have happened.

 Normally it's part of a diorama at a small museum downtown, but someone
 snuck in and cut one of its arms off the other day, so I took it home
 to do a little repair work. I suspect that the mystery vandal was my
 evil twin, but I haven't mentioned this to anyone.

>examine papers
 The product of an entire night's procrastination. I was supposed to be
 writing a report for work, but I wound up spending the entire night
 sitting alone in my room playing hangman instead.

 Well, at least it proves I was busy. If the police come looking for my
 evil twin again, I can use it as an alibi.

>examine poster
 It's a signed concert poster showing two guys. I'm not sure which of
 them signed it. The signature just says "John".

>look behind poster
 I can't see any such thing.

>examine bookshelf
 The only books on it are a multi-volume set on the writings of
 Nostradamus. I'm generally more of a history guy than a future guy, but
 Nostradamus, being a historical figure who wrote about the future, is
 both, two natures in one. Anyway, his writing creeps me out. I'm not
 sure why.

>read books
 I pull one down and open it a random:

 Two royal brothers will wage war so fiercely
 That between them the war will be so mortal
 That both will occupy the strong places;
 Their great quarrel will fill realm and life.

 Somehow, that gives me an uncanny feeling. I'm not sure what it is
 about it, but I'm glad to put it back on the shelf.

>read books
 I apprehensively pull another volume down and open it at random:

 ...and so a great noise and bellicose tumult will they make amongst
 them that all the East will tremble in terror of these brothers, yet
 not brothers...

 As I reshelve it, I involuntarily shudder. What does it all mean?

>play hangman
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Hyde Park
 This is normally just a pleasant enough place to go for a walk, but
 today there's a special event in progress: some sort of fun fair held
 as a fundraiser for the elementary school. Hill Street lies to the
 south, to the east is an entrance to a concrete tunnel, and a photo
 booth stands to the west.

 The center of attention here is a shiny new cotton candy machine.

 A gaggle of children are running around, laughing and playing.

>examine children
 They seem particularly fond of the cotton candy machine.

>examine machine
 It's an impressive device, fully automatic, with brass fittings and a
 huge tub. The kids are gathered around as much to watch it in operation
 as to sample the results. Too bad I can't stand cotton candy.

>eat cotton candy

 No thanks. Cotton candy makes me ill.

 Photo Booth
 Photo booths like these are something of a relic in the age of the
 cell-phone camera, but they weren't so uncommon twenty years ago. Cheap
 beige polyester curtains form a neutral backdrop, and a button waits to
 be pressed.

>examine curtains
 I see nothing special about the curtains.

 An unseen shutter goes click, and a photograph slides from a hidden
 slot and into my hand.

 It's a photograph of me.

 Vinculum Gate
 This is a transient place, a space between spaces that joins two
 alternatives. That is to say, it's a tunnel, which curves from west to
 south. The damp concrete walls are covered with graffiti, and loud but
 muffled dance music fills the air, presumably from something on the
 other side of the tunnel wall.

 An abandoned propaganda pamphlet lies forlorn the ground.

>examine pamphlet
 I flip through it. It's mostly poorly-grounded arguments and appeals to
 fear, but I'm left unclear about just what it's trying to convince me
 of. Is it possible for propaganda to be simply propaganda, divorced
 from content?

 Outside Weapon Shop
 I'm just outside a rustic half-timbered cottage with a wooden sign
 displaying a sword out front. It must be new; I don't recall seeing it
 around before. The street continues east and west from here, but
 there's some kind of construction going on to the east, making that way
 impassible. There's a pedestrian underpass to the north.

 Beside the shop is the traditional shop-side barrel.

 A training dummy stands here.

>examine cottage
 Quaint. I'd call it old-fashioned, if I didn't know it was less than a
 week old.

>examine sign
 Just a crude wood-burned 16x16 icon of a sword, the
 universally-recognized symbol of weapon shops everywhere.

>examine barrel
 It's the traditional small barrel of complimentary goodies to entice
 customers.

 In the barrel are twelve apples.

>examine apples

>push dummy

>enter shop
 The door sticks pretty badly, but I manage to push my way through it.

 Weapon Shop
 A muscular, red-bearded man stands behind a counter with a built-in
 display case.

 The shopkeeper says, "Welcome! We're having a special customer loyalty
 promotion today: bring in a weapon, any kind of weapon, and you can
 trade it for anything in the display case." Glancing at the case's
 contents, it seems like people have already been taking advantage of
 this by trading in things that are only marginally weapons.

>inventory
 I am carrying:
   an apple
   a propaganda pamphlet
   a photo
   a presidential figurine

>give apple to man
 The shopkeeper shakes his head. "That's not a weapon."

>give figurine to man
 The shopkeeper shakes his head. "That's not a weapon."

>examine case
 In the display case are a lead pipe, a wrench, a candlestick and a
 revolver.

>examine pipe
 A heavy metal object. Hollow, but strong. I could crack someone's head
 open with this, if there were any reason to do so.

>examine wrench
 A hefty adjustable pipe wrench, suitable for both plumbing and
 bludgeoning.

>examine candlestick
 An elegant shape worked in pewter, this would be a fine decoration for
 any home. Or it could be used to murder someone.

>examine revolver
 It's pretty much the only thing in the shop that was actually intended
 to be a weapon.

>give propaganda to man
 The shopkeeper shakes his head. "That's not a weapon."

>give photo to man
 "A nice likeness."

 Neighbor's Lawn
 I'm just ouside my neighbor's house -- yes, he can afford a whole
 house, with a lawn and everything, in this neighborhood. Tire marks on
 the lawn suggest that someone's been doing donuts here. I don't have
 any real evidence that my evil twin is responsible, but it's the kind
 of thing he'd do. The street continues east and west from here, but
 there's some kind of construction going on to the east, making that way
 impassible. There's a pedestrian underpass to the north.

 The door inside is hanging off its hinges. Someone must have broken in.

 A recycling bin is set out on the curbside.

 A lawnmower stands here alone, as if puzzled about what to do.

>examine door
 The door is splintered asunder, as if someone shouldered it down.
 They'll probably blame local hoodlums, but I think I know who's really
 responsible.

>examine bin
 The standard blue plastic square bin with the recycling logo on the
 side.

 In the recycling bin are eleven empty bottles.

>take bottle
 I'm not taking someone else's recycling.

>examine bottle
 It's a discarded green glass bottle. The label is missing, but it's
 probably for beer.

>examine lawnmower
 It's a shiny new top-of-the-line model.

>push lawnmower
 It rolls a litle.

>take lawnmower
 This is one of those bulky models that can't really be picked up. I
 could probably push it from place to place, though.

 I'm not just going to barge in without an invitation. Especially now

 Jekyll Park
 Dark, leafless trees claw at the graying sky here. A sinister booth
 labeled "INDOCTRINATION" lies to the west, Silent Street can be crossed
 to the south, and an entrance to a concrete tunnel lies east.

 A mind control device has been planted at a strategic point in the
 park's center.

 A crowd of brainwashed citizens mill about with dull eyes and slack
 jaws, perhaps waiting for some sort of signal to begin their rampage.

>examine booth
 I see nothing special about the indoctrination booth.

>examine device
 It's a device of a sort frequently employed by my evil twin. It uses a
 unique form of electromagnetic emission to zombify the human brain.
 Naturally, he designed it so that his own brain would be immune to its
 effects -- but, as an accidental consequence, so is mine! This puts me
 in a unique position to foil his plans: I alone can get close enough to
 smash the thing without being taken over.

 I knew there was something like this going on. I must have felt the
 emissions from the device all the way from my apartment!

>examine citizens
 I've seen this effect before. The only way to free these people from my
 evil twin's control is to destroy the source of the mind rays.
 Fortunately, that's right here.

>mow device
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west
 I don't want to risk going inside the booth.  There's no guarantee that
 I'd be immune to whatever happens in there.

 This is definitely my evil twin's handiwork. I've seen dolls like these

 uses them to send a message to people. The face on this one looks

 Vinculum Gate
 This is a transient place, a space between spaces that joins two
 alternatives. That is to say, it's a tunnel, which curves from west to
 south. The damp concrete walls are covered with graffiti, and loud but
 muffled dance music fills the air, presumably from something on the
 other side of the tunnel wall.

>go south

 Neighbor's Lawn
 I'm just ouside my neighbor's house -- yes, he can afford a whole
 house, with a lawn and everything, in this neighborhood. Tire marks on
 the lawn suggest that someone's been doing donuts here. I don't have
 any real evidence that my evil twin is responsible, but it's the kind
 of thing he'd do. The street continues east and west from here, but
 there's some kind of construction going on to the east, making that way
 impassible. There's a pedestrian underpass to the north.

 The door inside is hanging off its hinges. Someone must have broken in.

 A recycling bin is set out on the curbside.

 Outside My Apartment
 I'm out on Hill Street just outside my apartment building. It's a
 beautiful sunny day in a quiet residential neighborhood. The street
 continues east and west, and just across it is the park.

>go north

 Hyde Park
 This is normally just a pleasant enough place to go for a walk, but
 today there's a special event in progress: some sort of fun fair held
 as a fundraiser for the elementary school. Hill Street lies to the
 south, to the east is an entrance to a concrete tunnel, and a photo
 booth stands to the west.

 A training dummy stands here.

 The center of attention here is a shiny new cotton candy machine.

 A gaggle of children are running around, laughing and playing.

 Outside Weapon Shop
 I'm just outside a rustic half-timbered cottage with a wooden sign
 displaying a sword out front. It must be new; I don't recall seeing it
 around before. The street continues east and west from here, but
 there's some kind of construction going on to the east, making that way
 impassible. There's a pedestrian underpass to the north.

 Beside the shop is the traditional shop-side barrel.

>in

 Weapon Shop
 A muscular, red-bearded man stands behind a counter with a built-in
 display case.

>examine case
 In the display case are a lead pipe, a wrench, a candlestick and a
 revolver.

>give noose to man
 "The punjab lasso!" The shopkeeper snatches the revolver out of the
 display case and holds it at the level of his eyes fearfully. "I don't
 know how to use that myself, but I know how to defend myself against
 it. It's good for a trade, sure."

 He waits for me to initiate a trade.

 [To trade with the shopkeeper, type "TRADE X FOR Y".]

>trade noose for wrench
 The shopkeeper tightens his grip on the revolver as if expecting an
 ambush.

 I hand over the noose and the shopkeeper puts it in the display case.
 He gives me the wrench in exchange.

 Outside My Evil Twin's Lair
 My evil twin's dark fortress casts its shadow over Silent Street, which
 continues east and west. A security camera mounted above the massive
 iron-banded door tracks my every move. Across the street to the north
 is the... other park.

>go north

 Jekyll Park
 Dark, leafless trees claw at the graying sky here. A sinister booth
 labeled "INDOCTRINATION" lies to the west, Silent Street can be crossed
 to the south, and an entrance to a concrete tunnel lies east.

 A lawnmower stands here alone, as if puzzled about what to do.

 A mind control device has been planted at a strategic point in the
 park's center.

 A crowd of brainwashed citizens mill about with dull eyes and slack
 jaws, perhaps waiting for some sort of signal to begin their rampage.

>hit device with wrench
 I triumphantly smash the machine to pieces with the wrench. The people,
 freed from its influence, confusedly wander away. That's one of my evil
 twin's plans foiled, but I can't help but feel there's a further
 mystery afoot. Maybe I should finally try that espionage mission to his
 inner sanctum that I've been meaning to do.

 Now that the crowds are gone, I notice a knife stuck in a tree, where
 it's been used to carve a message.

>examine knife
 I'm not sure if it's technically a bowie knife. I've never really been
 all that interested in such things, and don't know the exact
 definition. But it's impressive, with notches and grooves and things,
 and a blade that looks like it's almost a foot long.

>take knife
 Taken.

>read message
 The branches of the trees twist into menacing shapes. Carved into one
 tree is the message "YOU'RE NEXT". What a maddeningly non-specific
 message. Next for what? Is the message it even meant for me?

>examine photo
 It's a photograph of my evil twin. I've never actually met him face to
 face, but I know it's a picture of him because he looks exactly like
 me.

>go south

 Outside My Evil Twin's Lair
 My evil twin's dark fortress casts its shadow over Silent Street, which
 continues east and west. A security camera mounted above the massive
 iron-banded door tracks my every move. Across the street to the north
 is the... other park.

>show photo to camera
 The camera eagerly locks onto the image of my evil twin, and the hidden
 speaker says "VISUAL MATCH SUCCEEDED. WELCOME HOME, MASTER!" A buzz and
 a click from the door handle indicates that the door is unlocked, so I
 let myself inside.

 My Evil Twin's Lair
 A feeling of pure malevolance seethes from the very walls here, but
 other than that, it's a fairly ordinary studio apartment. His only real
 attempt at decoration is a framed poster right next to a
 suspicious-looking bookshelf.

>examine poster
 It shows Harvey Dent from Batman, looking particularly malevolent. I
 think my evil twin sees him as a kind of role model.

 I may not agree with him on that point, but I have to admit that Dent
 is one of the better characters in Batman's rogues gallery. Batman
 really fights two distinct sets of criminals: you have the caricatured
 but relatively mundane gangsters and thugs, and you have the flamboyant
 costume-wearing theme villains. The brilliant thing about Dent is that
 he can work in either role, depending on what aspects of the character
 the writer chooses to emphasize. It's like he has a foot in two
 different worlds.

>examine bookshelf
 It's filled with fake-looking books with titleless spines.

>take books
 Just as I thought: it's just a bunch of fake spines.

 Close examination reveals a numeric keypad hidden behind the fake
 books. I shift them around to expose it for easier access.

>examine keypad
 Just ten numbers and an enter key underneath a glowing seven-digit
 display. I can use it to type numbers.

>inventory
 I am carrying:
   a bowie knife
   a wrench
   an empty bottle
   a discarded newspaper
   a photo
   a voodoo doll

>type 5318008
 I type "5318008" on the keypad and hit the enter key. It's rejected
 with a little electronic blurp.

>type 03241992
 I type "03241992" on the keypad, although only the last seven digits
 fit on the display, and then hit the enter key. It's rejected with a
 little electronic blurp.

>type 3241992
 I type "3241992" on the keypad and hit the enter key. It's rejected
 with a little electronic blurp.

>examine newspaper
 I scan the headlines. It seems there's been a wave of vandalism and
 petty theft. Gee, I wonder who's responsible?

 There's a flash of light, and I find myself elsewhere...

 Outside My Apartment
 I'm out on Hill Street just outside my apartment building. It's a
 beautiful sunny day in a quiet residential neighborhood. The street
 continues east and west, and just across it is the park.

>in
 I unlock the door and go back inside.

 My Apartment
 This studio apartment, located conveniently near work and right across
 the street from the park, serves as my personal headquarters for my
 hobbies, such as doing volunteer restoration work for the local
 American History Museum and foiling the plots of my evil twin. My only
 real attempt at decoration is a framed poster right next to the
 bookshelf. I can leave to the north.

 I can see a pocket knife here.

>examine knife
 It's a litle folding penknife with a red handle. Kind of like one of
 those Swiss Army knives, but with only one blade.

>examine bookshelf
 The only books on it are a multi-volume set on the writings of
 Nostradamus. I'm generally more of a history guy than a future guy, but
 Nostradamus, being a historical figure who wrote about the future, is
 both, two natures in one. Anyway, his writing creeps me out. I'm not
 sure why.

>take books
 Once more, I dare to peek inside the books or prophecy:

 In the year when Apollo comes of age, twins shall arise
 Friendly to each other only in times of storm.
 One shall always want to start
 When the other wants to begin.

 I'm pretty much freaking out now and I can't articulate why. No way am
 I opening those books again today.

>inventory
 I am carrying:
   a wrench
   an empty bottle
   a discarded newspaper
   a photo
   a voodoo doll

>stab doll
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Cutting that up would achieve little.

>go down
 At last, I penetrate the darkness of my evil twin's inner sanctum. I
 wonder if I'll finally meet him here?

 Something is wrong. I hear a siren, then black out. When I wake up, I'm
 in a jail.

 Jail (in the cell)
 Iron bars separate me from freedom. Clearly, this is a case of mistaken
 identity. The police should be thanking me, not confining me!

 I can see a policeman here.

 The policeman says "I hope you rot in there. What did you think you
 were doing, spoiling things for a bunch of kids like that?" He then
 turns away and sits at a desk with his back to me.

>xyzzy
 Nothing happens here.

 The policeman grumbles to himself.

 There's a knock at the door. The policeman gets up to answer it.

>look
 Jail (in the cell)
 Iron bars separate me from freedom. Clearly, this is a case of mistaken
 identity. The police should be thanking me, not confining me!

 I can see a policeman here.

 The policeman is talking with a mysterious figure at the door.

>examine figure
 His face his hidden by his broad-brimmed hat and the turned-up collar
 of his tranchcoat, but I think I recognize his voice. Could it be...?

 The policeman and the mysterious figure seem to be arguing. The latter
 turns to look at me, but I can't make out his face in the shadows under
 his broad-brimmed hat.

>yell
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to figure
 I start to speak, and the figure focuses his attention on me, his face
 still in shadow. My blood runs cold at the thought that he's seen my
 face but I still haven't seen his, and I find my words choked off.

 The policeman's face falls and his manner turns apologetic.

>talk to policeman
 He contemptuously disregards anything I say.

 Finally, the policeman turns back to me. "I'm letting you out. It seems
 this is a case of mistaken identity. Your brother just told me all
 about it."





 Confused? You probably don't really understand how things are between
 me and my twin.

 The thing you have to understand is that we're brothers. Even if we've
 never been seen in the same room, even if I don't actually know his
 name, we're really very close. In a way, we complement each other. He
 does the things that I'd never do, like crimes and atrocities. I thwart
 him when he goes too far. Well, sometimes. The point is that we need
 each other. We're bound into a cycle of eternal warfare, and innocents
 are caught in the crossfire. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

 I hear the wind blow.  It sounds as if it's close by, but I can't feel
 it.  On the contrary, the air seems stale.

>about
 Just to warn you, this is a bit of text dump.  Press any key once
 you've prepared yourself...

 <span class="floydstyle em">Fingertips: I Hear the Wind Blow</span> is part of <span class="floydstyle em">Apollo 18+20:</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">The IF Tribute Album</span>.  That means that it is one work in a
 collection of interactive fiction pieces created to commemorate the
 twentieth anniversary of the They Might Be Giants album <span class="floydstyle em">Apollo</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">18</span>, an effort coordinated by Kevin Jackson-Mead.

 The phrase "I hear the wind blow" comes from a song called
 <span class="floydstyle em">Fingertips,</span> and is but one line of many in the song.  It
 should be noted that while I *have* actually taken the time to suffer
 through (oops! I meant 'listen to') <span class="floydstyle em">Fingertips,</span> the song
 itself really didn't play into the inspiration for this work.  My
 apologies to all you rabid TMBG fans out there. The phrase "I hear the
 wind blow" is all I used for the writing prompt, and this work would
 not have been crafted any differently had I never heard the song
 <span class="floydstyle em">Fingertips.</span>

 So, if you like TMBG, I hope you won't hold all this against me.  And
 if you're not all that into TMBG, please know that that is fine (with
 me, anyway).  In either case, I hope you enjoy this short piece of
 interactive fiction.

 (And if you're wondering how such a non-TMBG fan ended up participating
 in this endeavor, be sure to read the CREDITS.)

>listen
 The wind wails a distant, indignant lament.  I listen to it for a time,
 lulled by its song, my thoughts wandering, until my thoughts become
 befuddled and I drift off into unconsciousness.

 *** I have lost my hold on life. ***

 That was perhaps not the best outcome.

 I beg your pardon?

>examine me
 I run my hands along my sides, and sense that I'm in my favorite Sunday

 this comforting.

 The feeling of comfort turns to confusion, however... and then to a
 loss of consciousness.

>taste air
 It tastes... stale, somehow.  Like old books, though of course I've
 never tried to taste anything of the sort.  The thought seems random,
 yet tied to the scent, altogether ridiculous, and in another way,
 poetic.  It's difficult to judge what makes sense, and after a while, I
 cease to try.

 I hear the wind blow.  It sounds as if it's close by, but I can't feel
 it.  On the contrary, the air seems stale.

>examine locket
 I close my hand around the locket, knowing now for certain that it was
 John who placed me here.  I remember the day I gave him this locket,
 what it meant to me then, and what it must mean now: his assurance to
 me that he understood and accepted my decision was a lie.

>rainy soul miasma
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine whistle
 A whistle?  He left me a whistle?  Perhaps it's better not to question
 the motives of a madman.  Perhaps a part of him was too moral or sane
 or... or perhaps too in love to leave me here with absolutely no means
 of escape.  Love, though, can be another word for obsession.  Or
 control.  It really shouldn't have ended this way.

 I have no heart for dancing, not anymore.  I used to fill my nights
 with it, in his embrace, and the world seemed perfect. How wrong I was.
 Visualizing it now, thinking of how happy we once were... the memories
 wash over me.  Memories I wish I could now forget.  I try to block it
 all from my mind, and I find that the trying becomes increasingly
 harder.  But at the same time, I discover that the forgetting grows
 surprisingly easier... until at last I forget everything, and there
 aren't really any thoughts at all.

>think about john
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>call john
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 The air seems thin, hardly adequate, but I do my best to let out a
 tremendous scream...

 My head begins to spin, I gasp for air, and the panic begins to
 escalate within me: crescendoing as the realization of my situation
 takes hold.  Then, almost as quickly as it began, I discard the dread,
 seek out resignation, and begin to drift away...

 I hear a voice: vague and far away.  "Miss?  Miss, can you hear me?"  I
 sense movement, as if I'm being carried.  "Dear God, Max, we've got to
 get her to Dr. Murray!"

 it.  On the contrary, the air seems stale.

>open coffin
 I realize that I have but an instant to act.  Despite the weakness of
 the moment before, I gather strength and beat wildly against the wood.

 The movement proves too much: my senses become disjointed, my head

 Then, it's almost as if I begin to observe my feelings from outside

 I hear the wind blow.  It sounds as if it's close by, but I can't feel
 it.  On the contrary, the air seems stale.

>credits
 Just to warn you, this is a bit of text dump.  Press any key once
 you've prepared yourself...

 I'd like to blame (...or is the proper word 'thank'?) Ben
 Collins-Sussman for looping me into doing this.  Ben was shocked to
 learn that I was not at all a TMBG fan, nor had I ever even heard of
 this album.  "You don't know that TMBG album?!? it's not a milestone of
 your adolescence??" he asked incredulously over G-chat one evening. For
 some reason, he encouraged me to participate anyway.

 So, despite my lack of fangirl status, and despite the fact that it was
 already well past the deadline for intents to participate, I found a
 writing prompt among those yet unclaimed which spoke to me.  I
 subsequently twisted Kevin's arm to let me take part (which was not
 difficult, and Kevin was just great throughout--very well organized,
 kept people on task, and allowed me time for a little extra polish
 while he was waiting on the late submissions).  So thanks, Ben and
 Kevin.

 Of course, one can never thank Graham Nelson enough for the joy that is
 Inform 7, nor praise Emily Short sufficiently for all of her work and
 the rather insane number of incredibly helpful examples she has written
 over the years.  Cheers also to the denizens of the ifMUD for their
 patience in answering my questions, helping me past obstacles, and
 providing encouragement over the past decade or so.  In particular,
 Emily Short, Andrew Plotkin, Sam Kabo Ashwell and GenericGeekGirl came
 to my rescue a few times while I was writing this.

 Many thanks to the folks who stepped up to beta test: Ruth Alfasso, Sam
 Kabo Ashwell, Royce Odle, Melvin Rangasamy, Andrew Schultz, Jack Welch,
 and The Xenographer.  Mistakes which remain are, of course, my own.

 Super, great big, major giant props to Justin de Vesine (who is both
 jaunty *and* stylish) for a gazillion things.  He is possibly the most
 helpful person I know, and I feel like I'm constantly thanking him for
 stuff.  On this particular occasion I would most like to thank him for
 his help in figuring out how I could code on my Chromebook (using the
 I7 command line compiler), so thanks for that. Thanks also to Adam
 Thornton for the development of the command line I7 platform and
 helping me with its use.

 I also coded a bit of this on a netbook using P. F. Chimento's Linux
 GUI of Inform, so props for that I7 front end as well.  And as long as
 I seem to be thanking pretty much the whole entire world, thanks to
 John Cater for recommending that I use Crunch Bang Linux to resurrect
 said netbook, and Philip Newborough for #!.

 Oh, and thank YOU for your time.

>help
 You may be asking for help because you keep dying.  That's an
 unfortunate consequence of the predicament in which your character now
 finds herself.  Here is my advice: undo is worthless, and restarting is
 automatic, so just keep dying.  Each time, try something new, and see
 if you can gather more information about who you are, why you're here,
 and whether or not you can save yourself.  There are, I promise you, at
 least a couple of non-obscure ways to get out of your predicament.

 ...and if you happen upon one of those solutions early on but still
 have no idea what happened, consider playing the game some more.  After
 that, if you are still wishing I had been more obvious (or if you'd
 merely like to confirm your suspicions), you can type BACKSTORY to
 learn what brought you here.

 (However, it goes without saying that all will be revealed, so only ask
 for the BACKSTORY if you are entirely done with this piece and open to
 being completely and utterly spoiled.)

>backstory
 In <span class="floydstyle em">Fingertips: I Hear the Wind Blow</span>, you are Kate Lauren, a
 young woman who lived some time in the past.  Refined, beautiful, and
 of means, you had your pick of suitors.  Lacking patience, and tired of
 the steady stream of people vying for your attention, you decided to
 settle on a dark and mysterious beau named John Whitman -- despite the
 fact that there was something unsettling about him that you couldn't
 quite place.

 "Perhaps..." you sometimes thought to yourself, "perhaps he is a little
 *too* dark and mysterious."  But you longed to spend your time with
 someone, share your dreams.  And he was more exciting to you than any
 of the others--not to mention every bit as handsome as the finest in
 the lot.  As days turned to months and your courtship progressed, you
 began to realize that you had been unwise to ignore your instincts.

 When you began to truly understand the person he was, you decided to
 break off your relationship with him.  He appeared to take the news
 well, indicating that he accepted that the affair was over forever.
 And with that, he bid you adieu...

 Now, as the game begins, you awake in your coffin, having been buried
 alive.  Precisely how you got here is not entirely clear, but you have
 a fairly firm idea of who the responsible party is, almost assuredly.
