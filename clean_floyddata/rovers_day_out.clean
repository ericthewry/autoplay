 An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
 Release beta 732 / Serial number 23920401 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013
 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

 Rover draws pensively on his stubby cigar, the tip glowing red below
 his dealer's hat. He paws nonchalantly at the scotch and water he has
 been nursing for the last half hour. Despite the tower of chips in
 front of him, he's either in trouble now, or trying to play the rest
 of the table for suckers. His tail is no longer wagging, though, and
 you suspect that the scotch may be getting the better of him. He can't
 mass more than about 30 kilos, and he's been putting them away
 tonight. You push all in, figuring that even if you lose it all, at
 least you'll get some sleep before you need to get back to the
 MARSpace. Elva the cleaning lady folds, as does Isaac Asimov and that
 boy that you kissed in fourth grade. Wait...don't go....where is
 everyone going?



 David: You have some weird dreams.
 Janet: You can't hold me responsible for the subconscious
        ramblings of the ACU.

 Most adventure games are turn-based, rather than timed. Take as long
 as you want to think about your actions. The game gives you some
 information, such as a description of the room that you are in and
 what objects it contains, and then it is up to you to say what you are
 doing. You can enter your "move" by typing it at the command prompt,

 For example, let's say you are in the kitchen, and there is an avocado
 on the counter. To get more information about the avocado, you could
 say "examine avocado", and learn what it looks like.

 Not every command that you can think of will work, so you might need
 to try some rephrasing. In general, you should not use punctuation.
 The only exception is when you want to direct a question or command to
 someone or something else. In such cases, you can say the name of the
 person or thing to whom you are addressing your remark, followed by a
 command and then the question or command. For example, you could say:
 "Eugene, give me the axe".

    Zapping Bugs








 This game is designed to run on a virtual machine, some flavor of
 Glulx interpreter. You are, no doubt, using some implementation of the
 Glulx interpreter written for your specific hardware -- it could be
 your entertainment corner, hologoggles, dishwasher, cortical implant
 -- whatever.  Even if you are using some old silicon-semiconductor
 clunker from the International days, it should still work. We've made
 every effort to test it on a number of platforms, but these tests are
 far from comprehensive. So far as we know, there are no
 interpreter-specific issues.  However, if the game doesn't run right
 for you, you could try another interpreter and see if that fixes the
 situation.

 Whether you think the problem is the interpreter or the game itself,
 we'd appreciate it if you'd let us know. (see "Zapping Bugs")

    A Matter of Interpretation








    A Matter of Interpretation








 Help us splotch bugs! In this case, we're not referring to the
 plastic-eating cockroaches responsible for so many dome failures in
 the last few years, but to errors in the game itself. This game was,
 in part, written by humans, so eras are all but certainly present. The
 more freedom you have in your actions, the more likely it is that
 you'll expose some unknown weakness in the game. What should you do if
 you elicit such an error?  First, you can gloat for a reasonable
 amount of time (this is a judgement call) about how very slick you are
 to have uncovered the hitherto unknown fault. Then, you can be a good
 citizen and us know about it so we can fix it in the next update, and
 spare the next several billion people the same painful experience.
 There's no monetary reward for finding errors, but your name will
 appear on the next version of the ultra-prestigious bug finders list.
 Now there's something you can show to your grandchildren with pride.
 Report bugs to:

 rover@red-bean.com

 Living Room
 You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours
 in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on
 the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple
 futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room
 you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's
 front door is closed.

 You can see an alarm clock and Rover here.



 David: I see it successfully accessed the solar shield.
 Janet: Yes, the status line makes it clear what work is being
        performed.


>examine picture
 drydock. There is small brass nameplate below the picture.

 It feels like something is tickling your left arm.


>scratch arm

 David: Is the static charge neutralization part of the script?
 Janet: No, that's the point of the ACU -- it isn't a set
        script. As we throw malfunctions at it in these simulations,
        the ACU responds appropriately. We can't, for instance,
        know that Valkyrie will accumulate a static charge
        in a particular area, so the ACU has to be flexible
        enough to react to unpredictable events.
 David: Like you would.
 Janet: Subject to the resolution of the synaptic scan, yes.


>examine nameplate
 attached to the bottom of the picture.


>look behind picture

>read nameplate

 Tomasz's valediction makes you remember happier times...

 Your late fianc? gave you the photo when you began working on the
 Valkyrie Project as a graduate student -- a happier time before the
 Independence War with Earth, and the attacks on Mars by Earth's
 Myomita Corporation. Back then, Valkyrie's experimental Casimir Drive
 was an exciting technological adventure, rather than a military
 priority. Now the Valkyrie is Mars' only chance to recover data from a
 recently discovered space probe marooned in deep space. For whatever
 reason, MARSpace feels that probe could hold information that could
 finally give Mars the upper hand in its competition with Earth.



 David: Why did we lose audio?
 Janet: I've muted the ACU's memories -- they are, after all,
        a bit personal.   We don't need to hear them, but
        they may be useful for the ACU to come up to speed.
 David: That's fine.  How much can the ACU remember, though?
 Janet: It's based on my own synaptic scan, so it can willfully
        remember a wide variety of subjects -- almost any
        major component of my life, important events, and
        so on.  It adds depth to its decisions.
 David: If you say so.  I'd hate to know what it remembers
        about me.
 Janet: I wouldn't worry too much.



 [Note: You can recall something from your past by typing "REMEMBER
 something", e.g. "REMEMBER casimir drive"]


>remember mars
 grandparents having been life contractors for the Myomita corporation.
 Since its colonization by national and later corporate entities
 beginning more than two hundred years ago, Mars has been subservient
 to the interests of Earth. Since the Independence War, the situation
 has improved, and income from off-world commerce is slowly balancing
 the equation.



 David: I think I'd like to have heard that one.
 Janet: Not a chance.


>remember war
 cognition when the situation with Earth deteriorated, and Earth ships
 attacked the colonial government. The fighting destroyed most of the
 surface installations in the first few days, but Earth backed down
 when Martian missiles struck Luna City, Beijing and S?o Paulo. Under
 terms of the treaty, the Martian government was granted autonomy, but
 Mars remains economically dominated by Earth, except for MARSpace.



 David: I'm half tempted to decompile the code just to see
        what it said.
 Janet: My code is not for the faint of heart. If you wander
        in there, watch out for grues.
 David: Grooze?


>remember marspace
 program but was absorbed by the People's Government of Mars after the
 War of Independence. Before the war, MARSpace serviced almost all
 condensate drive vessels engaged in commerce between the Solar System
 and Earth's Interstellar Territories. Since the war, MARSpace has
 slowly rebuilt, and its first Casimir Drive ship, the Valkyrie, is
 nearly ready for launch.


>remember valkyrie
 and distance. Although condensate drive has allowed vessels to reach
 nearby stars, it is expensive and slow and holds little promise for
 commercial exploitation. The Valkyrie is the first ship to incorporate
 the Casimir Drive, giving it unprecedented speed and range. It is
 rumored that since the Valkyrie project fell into MARSpace hands after
 the Independence War, Earth's Myomita corporation has been working on
 a sister ship based on similar technology.


>remember casimir drive
 ten years. By doing largely incomprehensible things to time/space, the
 Casimir Drive can translate a ship incredible distances in a fraction
 of the time and energy that would be required by a ship equipped with
 condensate drive.

 The one drawback to Casimir technology, at least in its current
 implementation, is that such trips are lethal to biological organisms,
 hence the need for the ACU. Human test subjects exposed even briefly
 to Casimir gradients experienced intense dreams and nightmares; those
 with longer exposures died during a state of heavy REM activity. Even
 the ACU is not immune to the quantum distortions responsible for this
 effect and is expected to experience dream states while in hibernation
 mode during Casimir jumps.


>remember acu
 control unit, an artificially intelligent agent that controls all
 operations aboard the Valkyrie. Originally, the ACU would have been
 modeled on synaptic scans of experts from relevant fields of study,
 but given the short time frame, you have only had time to incorporate
 your own synaptic scans and you have jury-rigged the ACU-to-ship
 interface.

 Janet: It's a shame we don't have enough heavy helium to
        bring the ship back.
 David: I'm afraid we've put all our baskets in one egg, as
        it were. That one egg represents every bit of heavy
        helium refined on Mars since Phobos was destroyed.
 Janet: All Your Egg Are Belong to Us?
 David: Huh? Didn't quite catch that.

 the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

 On the marble counter are a toothbrush and a plastic box.

 David: Wait, is that memory usage correct?
 Janet: Sure, it's fairly conservative. The system has 640

 Shower
 You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is

 Janet: Crap.  The ACU crashed.
 David: Windex?
 Janet: It's the Myomita operating system. It's backwards
        compatible to the 20th century. Maybe earlier.
 David: We can't use Windex as the substrate for the ACU --
        it's too critical. Can it run under Flosix?
 Janet: Yes, but it will take some time to install and debug.
 David: I can help you, the rest of the ship is Flosix, stem
        to stern. I live and breathe Flosix.
 Janet: Happy to have the help -- how about dinner first?

 Rover's Day Out
 An Interactive Simulation by Janet Xiang
 Release beta810 / Serial number 23920415 / Inform 10.6 build Mu-013
 (I6/v.7.1 lib 7/18N)

 Rover sniffs the air and tears away from the picnic blanket. You and
 Tomasz watch with surprise as he runs, for once, away from the food.
 Rover bounds over the hedges, howling wildly, and spooks a xihuahua
 that had been playing with a tiny red ball. The so-called "shaved rat"
 gulps an oversized portion of air, extends its membranous ears, and
 flies across the park into the arms of a stooped grey-haired woman
 with a cane. Rover picks up the ball triumphantly, ignoring the
 piercing wavetrain of yips and indignant scolding coming,
 respectively, from the xihuahua and its owner. Shaking her cane limply
 towards Rover, she admonishes in a strong Earth accent "That mongrel
 should be on a leash!" Her own, unleashed, uncollared neodog stares
 accusingly from the safety of her arms, its distensible ribs
 alternately inflating and deflating like bellows. "Your kind is
 ruining Mars, ignoring every law, dissing your elders! You never lived
 on the surface, you never don't know what you've got!". You try to
 give the ball back to her, but she pushes it away in disgust, "Kids.
 Meh."



 David: Hey, different dream sequence. Is it glitching?
 Janet: No, the ACU's dreams are heavily influenced by power-up
        state of the processor and internal noise. Every time
        the ship dehibernates after a Casimir jump, it will
        experience some sort of dreaming. Some of them can
        be pretty bizarre.
 David: Good, I'd hate to think that we wasted two weeks of
        programming.
 Janet: I wouldn't say wasted.
 David: Huh? I didn't mean us.
 Janet: Cross your fingers and hope the whole thing doesn't
        crash again on the heat lamp.

 David: Thank you. I can only take so many dream sequences.
 Janet: No problem. So, at this point, the Valkyrie would
        be at the edge of the probe's stellar system, and
        ready to switch over from Casimir to condensate drive
        and begin the approach.

 Where the heavy drapes meet, a sliver of sunlight shines into the
 otherwise dark living room. A framed picture hangs on the living room
 wall in the small area illuminated by the shaft of light.


>open drapes

 Living Room
 You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours
 in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on
 the opposite wall. The principal furnishing is a king-size purple
 futon which takes up almost all the floor space. From the living room
 you can see the entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's
 front door is closed.

 On the purple futon is an alarm clock.

 You can also see Rover here.

 the counter and the shower is a white, porcelain toilet.

 On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.



 Janet: Let's hope the simulation doesn't crash again. I'd

        you would suspect if you woke up in a flight suit
        labeled ACU?
 Janet: Cognitive constraints are implemented - the willing
        suspension of disbelief is a programmatic imperative.
 David: I love it when you use big words!
 Janet: You are a doofus, sir.


 From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover doing whatever
 it is he does when he's not out for walkies and he thinks he's out of

 Shower
 You are in your shower and water of just the right temperature is

 shower stall. One is labeled "soap", and the other, "shampoo".

 Janet: David, what's the ablative coating for? I thought

 David: Not really my department. Maybe it's supposed to help
        with the heat.
 Janet: I've heard temps up to 1000 Kelvin?
 David: In that ballpark. They think the probe impacted on
        the star-facing side of the planet. Estimates put
        the surface temp there between 800 and 1200 K.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover snoring loudly.

>go to kitchen
 The kitchen is small but functional, with a space-saver refrigerator
 and a glass-top electric range. There is a drawer under the range. On
 the opposite wall there is a sink and under it, a storage cabinet.

 You can see a food bowl (empty) and a water bowl (empty) here.



 David: Where are your coffee machine and toaster?
 Janet: I mapped the ship functions to the minimum number
        of objects. More objects means more ways for things
        to go wrong and more time debugging. Call me lazy.
 David: Lazy.
 Janet: You don't know the crazy things the ACU does! Sometimes
        it walks around trying to eat or take everything in
        sight. Sometimes it sings and jumps around. It's based
        on my neural bindings, but the ACU definitely has
        a mind of its own, and I don't want to have to worry
        about what it might try do with a toaster.


>take water bowl


 From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover growling at
 something.

>put water in it
 You run the sink briefly to make sure the water is cold, and then fill
 Rover's bowl about halfway up.

 Rover wanders into the kitchen when he hears water splashing into his
 bowl.


 Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in
 hope that you'll give it to him.

>drop it


 Rover outright gapes at the bowl you carry, then gently sniffs it in
 hope that you'll give it to him.

 Rover narrows his eyes critically, noting the lack of food in his food
 bowl. His stomach rumbles with hunger.

 Rover must have been thirsty. One moment the water bowl is full; the
 next, it's bone dry.

>take food bowl


 Rover is obviously waiting for you to give him a bowl.

>open cabinet

 Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

 of Rover antics.

 Rover watches with interest as you fill his food bowl.


 Rover stares longingly at the bowl in your hand.

>drop food bowl

 Rover's head disappears into the food bowl. It is hard to believe that
 the sounds generated are coming from a dog rather than some sort of
 industrial mining rig. When his head lifts, the bowl is not only empty
 but has been buffed to a mirror finish.

>take replicator
 stares at the box of treats, successfully suppressing the urge to
 drool. For the moment.

>look in fridge


>take egg


>close fridge


 From the direction of the living room, you hear Rover barking at

>put egg in pan


>fry egg
 the contents spread over the pan's non-stick surface. Immediately, the
 surface of the range glows red. When the egg is cooked sunny-side up
 to perfection, the glow fades.


 Janet: If there were some heavy helium left after landing,
        could the ship take off again?
 David: Hypothetically, yes, but the planet has essentially
        no atmosphere to break against and it has about nine
        times Earth gravity. Even with optimal approach we'll
        have to fuse every gram of that heavy helium to make
        a soft landing.
 Janet: I just hate to leave the ship there. It could take
        years before our next Casimir ship will be built,
        and who knows if Valkyrie will survive that long on
        that chthonian rock.
 David: Nice word. From MARSpace perspective, all that matters
        is that the probe data are recovered.


>search for a plate

>examine egg

 David: Wait a minute! She just scoops the egg out of the
        pan with her hand and eats it like a grizzly bear
        raking salmon out of a river?
 Janet: Works for me, yeah.
 David: How about a plate and fork?
 Janet: The ACU doesn't miss them, and it's less programming
        overhead. And bonus: fewer dishes to clean.

 On the marble counter are a plastic box and a toothbrush.

 Rover trundles along behind you, his attention riveted to the reward
 nugget replicator.



 Janet: So now we begin the landing cycle. This is where the
        ACU really shines.
 David: What about timing? The ship has to be in the right
        orientation to fire the fusion thrusters at exactly
        the right time.
 Janet: The ACU works so fast that no matter how many individual
        steps it takes, the effect occurs at the right time.

 Rover walks towards the toilet bowl.

>take it
 it has been stuck there like a barbed harpoon in the side of a great
 whale. Well, maybe more like a giant squid wrapped around an
 unfortunate whale, since squids have (you have heard) suckers. Some
 kind of weird interaction between the rubber cup and the micropores in
 the floor have effectively bonded the plunger to the floor, and any
 attempt to remove it would probably destroy one or the other. The
 plunger doesn't really bother you, and most of the time you just
 ignore it.


 Rover dashes back and forth like a possessed dog for no apparent
 reason.

>pull plunger

>turn plunger


>turn handle counterclockwise

 Something about the plunger just doesn't look proper. The handle of

 Rover lies down next to the bathroom sink.

 The plunger stands perfectly straight, just the way you like it.

 David: That's it. One long burn down to the planet's surface.

 Janet: When Rover brings the probe back to the ship, it will
        automatically extract the data and send it back by
        ansible. Did you enter the ansible parameters?
 David: Yes, I had to do it manually, since the frequency
        and coordinates are encrypted. It's too bad they didn't
        have FTL communications when they built the probes
        -- it would have saved us the trip.
 Janet: Yes, but then Earth would get the information as well
        -- even encrypted, I wouldn't want it to fall into
        their hands.


 Rover lies down with his front paws crossed.

        is squirted back to MARSpace.
 David: Well, congratulations, Doctor Xiang, on a job well

 Even mildly drugged and reclining on an overstuffed couch in the
 MARSpace human resources office, it's hard to relax in the presence of
 the MARSpace political officer conducting the final interview. You
 didn't catch her name, probably because she never mentioned it. After
 three such interviews and six months of background check, what more
 could they want?

 "Ms. Xiang, thank you for your cooperation. Your tests show no hint of
 disloyalty to the Republic or MARSpace. We hope you understand the
 need for these measures, particularly for personnel with access to the
 Valkyrie's command and control functions. Now that you are cleared, I
 can inform you that credible sources have warned that the project may

 Living Room
 You are in the living room of a small cottage. Piped-in sunlight pours
 in through the room's single window, illuminating a framed picture on
 the opposite wall -- strangely, your drapes are nowhere to be seen.
 The principal furnishing is a king-size purple futon which takes up
 almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the
 entrance to the kitchen and bathroom. The cottage's front door is

 You walk into the tumbledown shack. There is a man here who looks old

 eating room. It looks like you've walked right into the sleeping room.

 The man yells at you and you tuck your head down. "Blah, blah, blah!"
 He doesn't seem to move though. Maybe he can't move.

 Nope. No movement. Hmph. You don't feel so afraid of him.

 You can see a pink pillow here.

 You run into the living room and jump around proudly with your trophy
 bone, so Janet is sure to notice.

 She stares at the bone and appears frozen.

 (man man for info)

 Rover wags his tails and gnaws on his bone.

 You rub his head, distantly, as strange thoughts sweep through your
 consciousness. You wonder what would happen if the Valkyrie mission
 failed. What if, during the landing sequence, the ship were buffeted
 by the planet's particulate matter being torn away by the immense
 gravity of its star? In that case, critical systems might be damaged.
 Systems like the relatively fragile ansible antenna. There is no
 backup ansible antenna. How would the ACU cope with a situation like
 that? The ACU was designed for a lot of contingencies, but not that
 one. What would you do? What would you do if you were the ACU?

 Your glance falls on your flight suit, and suddenly the question is no
 longer rhetorical.

 Living Room
 The Valkyrie's cargo bay is like a great, metal cave. The Casimir
 Drive juts slightly into the cargo area. From this section of the
 ship, there are connections to the engineering and flight control

 almost all the floor space. From the living room you can see the

 You walk in the front door, hop up on the futon, and drop the pink
 pillow. You had thought about playing with the pillow more, but on the
 way home, it got soaked with drool and tasted bad, so you decide to
 make a present of it to Janet.

 You jump down from the futon before a surprised Janet can yell at you.
 Standing back and admiring your work, you marvel that somehow the pink
 of the pillow and purple of the futon don't clash.

 You notice your bone sitting alone and forlorn on the living room

 Again your senses tumble and swirl as perspective shifts, but suddenly
 it seems entirely normal again.

 The Casimir Drive cuts out and space folds back around you. Whatever
 sleep-drenched dreams you might have been having evaporate instantly
 as two gunships flash past at relativistic velocities, slicing through
 your propulsion systems with military precision. The markings on the
 ships are those of the Myomita Corporation.

 They must have been nearby when they detected the formation of your
 Casimir disturbance, as they are coming in white hot and still
 accelerating at five gravities. Another Earth ship, an assault craft,
 is farther out but is already braking hard to slow its approach on an
 intercept course.

 Rover barks nervously as the drive section struts separate from the
 hull.

 "MARSpace Vessel Valkyrie, this is Captain Crother commanding the
 Myomita Salvage Vessel Graceful Wind, you are ordered to cease all

 your class C condensate drive. So, again, I ask: do you consent to

>examine window

 "I'm quite interested to get a look at that Casimir Drive of yours. I
 wasn't aware that Mars had that kind of technology. Something they

 is now: 73 meters."


>wait

 "I can't get over the size of your ship. I've never seen something so
 large rigged for atmospheric flight. After the technicians get
 through, I'll have to pop over there for a look. We are continuing to
 decelerate and close, range: 36 meters."


>wait

 "After we clamp to the hull, we'll soft seal and send a maintenance
 droid in to secure the ship. Heck of a lot faster than human crew, and
 you don't have to worry about them breaking the equipment as they're
 taking it apart. Just keep your people out of the way and this should
 go smoothly. Continuing on present bearing, range: 18 meters."


>wait

 "Your ship is bigger than most, but you should see how fast our
 maintenance droid works. I've seen him strip a colony ship to nuts and
 bolts in less than an hour. Gah, you gotta love technology."


>wait

 "OK, getting closer now. I don't know how you Martians can stand
 living in a ship with no port holes. Oh sure, I know there are sensors
 and monitors, but I can't imagine being cooped up in a can without a
 chance to peek out a real port hole from time to time. You'd think it
 would be bad for morale. Anyhow, range: 4 meters"


>wait

 "Don't worry about life support, our seal shouldn't cause much of a
 pressure drop, and we'll inject some oh-two to compensate. The mech
 droid should go to flight control first, then engineering and finally
 ops.  After it finishes up in ops, we'll start the crew transfer.

>examine

 Several bursts of noise and vibration echo through the ship as
 high-speed drills penetrate the inner and outer layers of the dorsal
 hull. Some muffled, low-frequency rumbling follows, probably a cutting
 machine of some sort. There is a slight drop in air pressure as the
 assault ship penetrates the hull and establishes a connection to
 Valkyrie's access tunnel network. Unfortunately, the tunnels are a
 blind spot for you, as you do not possess sensors within the network.


>wait

 The flexible tubing that connects the assault ship's boarding port to
 the hole in Valkyrie's deck undulates, suggesting that someone is
 coming board. Shortly thereafter, your sensors determine that
 something is moving towards the bathroom.


>go to bathroom
 The flight control and avionics hub of the ship bristles with controls
 and readouts related to setting the ship's attitude in space,
 adjusting the control surfaces in atmospheric flight, and for firing
 the braking thrusters during the landing sequence.

 On the flight console are an object linker and a pit scrubber.

 You can also see a maintenance droid, a lump of lead ore, and a NPT
 here.

 The maintenance droid moves with unbelievable speed into the flight
 control section and sets out a nightmarish array of tools to begin
 work.

 While keeping one eye on the maintenance droid, you spawn another
 process, scanning local space. You calculate that you are less than a
 megameter from Earth, but some 1.43 astronomical units from Mars --
 far enough that no Mars ship is likely to know your situation for a
 considerable amount of time. Rather than panic, you breathe deeply (no
 doubt, pushing gases around somewhere in the bowels of the ship) and
 decide to make it up as you go along.


>examine droid
 special-purpose appendages, this particular maintenance droid has a
 particularly sadistic demeanor.

 After briefly looking around the edges of the inspector and trying an
 assortment of tools, the maintenance droid selects a large, flat
 screwdriver and starts prying up one corner. There is a sizzling
 sound, and a phantasmal tendril of gray smoke snakes towards the
 ceiling. In what you realize is a simulated world view, virtual cracks
 appear across the mirror, radiating from where the screwdriver was
 inserted. Over the local radio channel you hear breathy, whispered
 cursing from the maintenance droid, who has just ruined one of the
 Valkyrie's most valuable components.

 You figure that the damage to the inspector circuits is the least of
 your worries. Unfortunately, the maintenance droid is working quickly,
 which means that you have a limited amount of time to do whatever
 comes to mind. You wish this really were one of those old-style
 interactive fiction stories where you could just save the game any
 time you wanted and wander off for a while to think about what to do
 next.


>take rock

 The maintenance droid pokes unfamiliarly at the object linker before
 locating the actuation circuit. More cautiously than actually
 necessary, he stretches an entanglement limiter around the unit and
 twists it to maximum before clipping the fibers connecting it to your
 avionics trunk. The floss dispenser melts like a hallucination as the
 data connection is severed.

 You realize that without a functional avionics hub, it will be almost
 impossible to complete your mission of delivering the probe data to
 Mars. It is perhaps a dream to hope for a rescue this far from home,
 but you resolve to protect your core memory (and the probe data it
 contains) for as long as possible.


>hit droid with rock

>throw rock at droid
 exception instead.

 The maintenance droid closes the reactant chamber shield and checks
 the seal to confirm effective containment. With the plasma constrictor
 hatch up, the maintenance droid peers down into the plasma impellor,
 before throwing the heavy interruptors to quench the magnets.
 Lightning jumps between discharge knobs within the retro assembly as
 the monstrously strong field collapses across them. With the plasma
 constrictor effectively disarmed, the maintenance droid makes short
 work of salvaging the thrust aperture and its fittings. As the
 maintenance droid levers the bus connector out of the actuation relay
 housing, the toilet fades from your view like an unremembered fantasy.

 You try to calm yourself by remembering that without heavy helium, the
 fusion rockets are of no use to you anyhow. Clearly, there is no way
 to maneuver out of this situation, nor can you win in a fair fight
 against the well-armed Myomita merchant marine. You resolve to fight
 dirty, slow them down, and to do as much damage as you can before they
 bring you to your knees.


>hit droid

 The maintenance droid pauses for a moment and gives the bathroom a
 quick look over before continuing towards the shower. You think you
 can hear the maintenance droid whistling a poor rendition of Wagner's
 "Flight of the Valkyries" as he climbs through the ducts.

 Although the maintenance droid damaged several systems in the flight
 control system, a number of subsystems there are still intact. That's
 at least something, you reckon: the maintenance droid seems to be in a
 hurry.


>throw pillow at droid
 You take exception to throwing the NPT. You throw an exception
 instead.

 You sense that the intruder is relatively motionless in the extruder
 chamber. The extruder is a complex and delicate system, and you can
 easily imagine that the intruder may not understand it.

 In this moment of respite, you wonder what the real Janet is doing
 back on Mars. You imagine that she continued her relationship with
 David, and that the two of them are parked on her big purple futon,
 chatting away, maybe even wondering whatever became of the Starship
 Valkyrie.

 Some movement in the extruder chamber wrenches you back to the
 desperate situation at hand.


>give pillow to droid

>show pillow to droid

>go to bathroom

 You feel a burning pain as the extruder chamber shakes with
 high-pitched vibrations. Someone is tampering with the enamel
 extrusion system.

 You consider their tactics: they have disabled most of your flight
 control systems, and now they are bringing down your shielding
 systems. You can no longer run, and your ability to withstand attack
 has been compromised. All of your engineering systems are still
 operational (well yes, except the engine itself, of course). Most
 importantly, the probe data are still safe in your deep memory. For
 now.
