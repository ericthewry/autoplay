 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nameless Tavern (exits: NW)</span>

 and commotion surround your every move while light flickers from
 candles atop wooden tables. The bartender nods at you as he tends to
 his customers.

 it!

>about

 <span class="floydstyle i">Nameless Quest v2.0.12</span> is (c) 1985, 1986, 1987 by Endless BBS
 (172-363-5377) and was called Endless Quest up until v2.0, which is
 when I added an ending to it so it couldn't be called that anymore,
 hehe. I have been playing it since v1.5.1 back in 1985 and have been
 the maintainer since v1.7.0 when I was elevated to Co-SysOp status, so
 after I added the ending Endless gave me permission to put my name on
 it... or my non-name ;)... I hope that you enjoy it!

 Thanks to Endless, my fellow Co-SysOps Lninja, Ultrex, and Crossbolt
 for letting me bounce ideas off of them, and especially my new
 co-developer Warden (made Co-SysOp in three months! Nice job kid!) And
 to my mother, who keeps saying "you're 29 years old and you have a
 college degree so why don't you get a job and move out of the house
 and what do you do in that basement all day anyway": I DO THIS! Look
 upon my works, ye mighty, and despair! Hehehe.

 On your way out, a tavern bouncer frisks you and confiscates your
 darts. "Okay, <span class="floydstyle i">now</span> you can go," he says.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Village Square (exits: N W E S SE)</span>
 You are at the crossroads of a tiny village like many others you have
 seen since you have been adventuring. The main street runs east and
 west, while a smaller one runs north and south.

 You are very tired. The urge to sleep is overpowering!

>make a rude gesture at the bouncer after he closes the door.

 That verb is not recognized! Type VERBS for a list of commands!

>sleep

 You slump down onto the dusty ground, too tired to find proper
 lodgings. Sleep is immediate.



 ...zzzzzzz...

 You are woken by someone tugging on your sleeve! You squint and see
 that it is an old man.

 "It's you!" he gasps. "The chosen one!"

>examine man

 Strength: 5
 Dexterity: 6
 Constitution: 5

 Description: An old, mostly bald man with a long white beard, dressed
 in rags and a tattered brown cloak.

 "I am-- well, my name is not important," the old man says. "But the
 prophecies have spoken of one who would free this poor land from the
 ravages of the dragon who lives to the south!" He pauses. "It will not
 be easy," he warns. "First you must prove your mettle. This quest will
 test your body, mind, and heart! For you must perform a feat of
 strength, outwit a fiendishly complex machine, and win the affections
 of a mysterious sorceress to defeat the dragon!"

>take man

 The old man is too large for you to pick up.

 "I can say no more!" the old man cries. He runs off down the road and
 into the wilderness.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northern End of Village (exits: N NE S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads south to the village square and
 north into the forest. To the northeast you see a long path leading to
 a small cottage.

 A blue pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the northern
 boundary of the village.

>examine pennant

 A long, triangular piece of blue fabric.

>take pennant

 The pennant is up too high.

>climb pole

 The pole is too slick - you just slide right back down it.

 You are on a path that leads southwest to a country road and north
 toward a small cottage.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N S)</span>
 You are on a path that leads north to the door of a small cottage and
 south toward a country road. Oddly, though the path itself is just a
 dirt track through a wide clearing in the forest, it is crisscrossed
 by irregularly placed strips of stone!

>stones

 That verb is not recognized! Type VERBS for a list of commands!

>examine stones

 You've walked on stone streets before, but these strips are so narrow
 that you would have to be surefooted indeed to follow them! Also, they
 don't seem to go anywhere in particular - they just meander around the
 clearing.

>examine track

 At least one of the things you mentioned doesn't seem to be here!

>take stone

 They're not portable.

>examine door

 At least one of the things you mentioned doesn't seem to be here!

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Cottage (exits: N S)</span>
 In front of you, immediately to the north, lies a well-maintained
 white cottage. A black cat blinks curiously at you from a window sill;
 as you approach, it hops down and skitters away. A path leads south.

 There is a small mailbox here.

>examine mailbox

 You can't see inside, since the mailbox is closed.

>open mailbox

 You open the mailbox, revealing a leaflet.

>take leaflet

 Taken.

>read leaflet

 "WELCOME TO NAMELESS QUEST v2.0.12!

 NAMELESS QUEST is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it
 you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by
 mortals. No BBS should be without one! And Endless BBS isn't! Hehehe."

 [Your score has just gone up by fifty points.]

>score

 You have scored 50 out of a possible 201, in 30 turns.

 The score is made up as follows:

     50 : reading a hilarious leaflet

     50 total (out of 201)

>cottage

 That verb is not recognized! Type VERBS for a list of commands!

>examine cottage

 The cottage is unremarkable!

>go north

 You try the door - locked!

>knock

 (on the door)
 A woman's voice calls out, "MALSXLOSI." Then you hear a resounding
 CHUNK!! sound. Was that the door unlocking?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>open door

 You open the door and step through...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cottage (exits: NONE!)</span>
 The cottage is smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside,
 and is nearly empty, furnished only with a rickety wooden table.
 Somehow, there are no exits - not even the door you walked in through!
 Where did it go?

 "I am told you are the chosen one," says the woman's voice, cold but
 soft. "I am-- well, my name is not important."

>examine woman

 You can't see where the voice is coming from!

 "As the chosen one, you are naturally endowed with a certain amount of
 magical energy," the voice says. "Not as much as someone who has
 studied sorcery, but enough to cast Level 1 spells. To cast stronger
 ones, you will need some assistance."

 A wand magically appears on the table in front of you. "Take the
 wand," the voice says.

>examine wand

 You've never really understood how these magic wands work.

 "You need to be holding the wand before we can continue," the voice
 says.

>take wand

 As you pick up the wand, you feel a pricking sensation against your
 thumb. You notice that the base of the wand is equipped with a small
 needle!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine needle

 You've never really understood how these magic wands work.

 "The wand is actually a hollow tube," the voice says. "To cast a Level
 2 or Level 3 spell, you will insert an ampule of a potion into the
 wand. Squeeze the wand, and the ampule will be crushed and the potion
 will flow through the needle into your bloodstream, charging you with
 its magical energy. The effect does not last long, and you must cast
 the spell while you are still energized!"

 A ampule of cloudy fluid appears on the table. "Let's try it," the
 voice says. "Take the ampule."

>take ampule

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>put ampule in wand

 "Not yet," the voice says.

 A slender spellbook appears on the table before you. "This spellbook
 will magically track what ampules you have in your possession and
 instruct you in the proper formation of your spells," the voice says.
 "I'll give you a few moments before we proceed. First, take the book
 and read it - it should only take a moment. Then put the ampule into
 the wand, and we can continue."

>take book

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>read book

 Letters magically swim before your eyes to form these words:

 SPELLES GRANTED BY POTIONNES IN THY INVENTTORIE
 A spelle to ryse off ye Growndde.

 SPELLES GRANTED BY POTIONNES IN THY BLODDE-STREYM

>put ampule in wand

 You load the ampule of cloudy fluid into the wand.

 "Now squeeze the wand," the voice says.

>squeeze wand

 You hear the muffled sound of glass breaking - wince at the sting of
 the needle entering your thumb - and then you feel magical energy
 coursing through your body!

 "Quick!" the voice says. "Cast the spell just like the book says:
 SXVEBI!"

>sxvebi

 You feel your stomach lurch and look down to find that you are
 suddenly floating several inches off the ground! You've cast a
 levitation spell! (A weak one, but still.)

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>wait

 Time passes.

 The magical energy leaves your body. As it does, you gently return to
 the ground.

 "All right," the voice says. "I have discharged my duty. You've
 received your training, and I've just placed some ampules in the
 mailbox outside that should help you in your quest. If you encounter
 other spells along the way, feel free to use them - but don't go more
 than two levels above your base skill level. Good luck." She clears
 her throat. "FORPELI!"

 For a terrifying moment you feel as though you are free-falling in
 every direction at once! Then all is still, and you find yourself...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Cottage (exits: N S)</span>
 In front of you, immediately to the north, lies a well-maintained
 white cottage. A path leads south.

 There is a small mailbox here.

>open mailbox

 That's already open.

 by irregularly placed strips of stone!

>go south

 As you proceed down the path you hear a grinding sound behind you, and
 you turn to find the stone strips criss-crossing the path rising up
 out of the ground to form a labyrinth of stone walls! Returning to the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western End of Village (exits: N W E S)</span>
 This is the western end of a small, nameless village. The main road
 runs west toward the shoreline and east into the center of town. The
 only buildings of interest are a pair of shops: a plain-looking weapon
 shop to the south and a slightly fancier-looking fishing shop to the
 north.

 A green pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the western
 boundary of the village.

>examine fishing shop

 According to the huge wooden marlin with the words "BOB'S FISHING
 SUPPLY" on it hanging over the door, this is a fishing supply shop!
 Here you can buy fishing poles and similar gear - when the shop is
 open, that is. Right now it's closed. There is a note on the door!

>malsxlosi northern door

 You can only MALSXLOSI magical doors! This one is locked in the
 conventional way.

>examine weapon shop

 You see nothing special about the weapon shop!

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Weapon Shop (exits: N S)</span>
 This is a small, dusty weapon shop. The wall behind the counter is
 lined with swords and shields of all sizes and descriptions, along
 with related items such as belts with scabbards. An enormous,
 bowl-shaped shield and a fine broadsword are on prominent display next
 to a dartboard. A sign says, "Win this sword and shield by hitting a
 bullseye! One gold to try your luck!"

 On the counter you see a purple dart.

 The shop owner watches you vigilantly!

 The sign out front said this was a jewelry shop, but inside you find
 no display cases of jewelry or anything else to suggest that this is a
 store of any kind. Instead, you find a man wearing a cloak with
 glowing stripes, sitting at a desk and applying the strangest torch
 you've ever seen - a piece of metal that gives off a curiously narrow
 blue flame - to a rough, round rock. He looks up sharply as you enter.

 "Grf," he says. "It's you. Uh... forget you saw this." He quickly
 gathers up his things, waves his scepter, and walks off through the
 wall. Vivid white light flares briefly around him.

 As if that weren't enough, the rock then reappears on the desk a
 moment later.

>examine rock

 The man in the striped cloak walks back in through the wall. Behind

 the rock you're holding. "Sorry, I need that," he says, snatching it
 out of your hand. "Forgot native objects can't travel that way. Pzt,
 what do I do with you while I leave the long way? Wait, I know." He
 clears his throat. "FROSTI," he says. "Don't worry, the effect only

 rock in hand.

>undo



 You wake up.

 You are lying on your back in an unfamiliar bed in an unfamiliar room,
 staring at a white popcorn ceiling. You blink in disbelief. Seriously?
 That was all just a dream?

 There is a dresser across from the foot of your bed; you stagger to
 your feet, walk over to it, and peer into the mirror perched above it.
 Okay. Good. Not a dream. You still look like yourself. You're even
 still wearing your brown cloak. But then where are you? What happened?
 You try to think. The last thing you remember is...

 ...oh. Right. Your death. Which makes this the afterlife. And if that
 popcorn ceiling is any indication, you didn't end up where you might
 have hoped.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It doesn't have that "lived
 in" look that would mark this as your own room, but neither is it the
 sort of austerely professional space that would give it away as a
 hotel room.

 (Wait, "hotel"? How do you know that word...?)

 ...in any case, your best guess is that it's the guest room of someone
 else's house. Maybe it belongs to a friend of yours. (Do you have
 friends? You do hear voices downstairs.) It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom (nice to see the
 bathroom is <span class="floydstyle em">en suite</span>); another door is set into the wall
 across from the window. The floor is a medium-light hardwood, and the
 ceiling... has nothing wrong with it that a few thousand dollars'
 worth of asbestos abatement won't fix. (Except - "dollars"?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 Even more than the bedroom, this cramped bathroom shows this house's
 age. Not that it isn't well kept up - it looks like it's been recently
 cleaned - but the clunky styling of the fixtures suggests that it
 hasn't been renovated for a couple of generations. (How you know this,
 given that you've just come from a world where people wash in barrels
 and relieve themselves in buckets, you're not entirely sure.) The
 wallpaper is peeling a bit around the window set into the exterior
 wall; the ocean view from that window is reflected in the mirrored
 medicine cabinet on the tiled partition wall opposite it. Beneath the
 medicine cabinet is a sink. The far wall is also done in small white
 tile, chipped here and there. Near that wall, but not attached to it,
 is a bathtub; however, the towel rack is across the room, above the
 toilet. Next to the toilet is the doorway, which leads back to the
 bedroom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is
 set into the wall across from the window.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You emerge from your room, not knowing what to expect, and quickly
 take in your surroundings. You are standing in a nondescript hallway:
 plain white walls, a threadbare runner carpet. The door to your
 bedroom is at one end of the hallway, the first door on the right-hand
 side at the top of a flight of stairs that spirals downward to an
 unseen lower floor. At the other end of the hallway... well, there is
 no other end to the hallway. Not that you can see, anyway. It seems to
 stretch on forever, with doors at regular intervals.

 While you're staring at that, you hear someone coming up the stairs.
 When you turn to look at who it is, you discover that it's... you.

 "Hi!" the other you says. "Sorry your quest didn't work out. I know
 what that's like, believe me. But why wouldn't you believe me? I'm
 you!" The other you chuckles. "I know, your head must be spinning. But
 I'm here to help you out! Just call me your alter ego. You'll want to
 be clear. But no pressure!" The other you chuckles again. "Feel free
 to explore the Great Upstairs - come on down when you're ready. Oh,
 one last thing: THAT way," he says, pointing at the endless hallway,
 "is north." The other you grins and heads downstairs.

>take carpet

 There is no point in fixating on the floor.

>examine door

 A basic door. It is closed.

>go north

 You walk down the hallway, and nothing seems strange about it - you
 feel yourself traveling forward, the doors go by just as you'd
 expect... and yet when you stop and look around, you discover that you
 haven't moved an inch.

>go south

 You follow the curving staircase downward...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 To call this a room might be an overstatement. It's really just a
 small area of parquet at the bottom of the stairs. The staircase back
 up to the second floor lies to the west; a hallway leads north, and
 this one looks mercifully finite. To the east is a dark room lit by
 flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside is to the south.

 Your double is sitting on one of the bottom stairs, reading a
 newspaper; he folds it up and sets it aside as you walk by him. "So, I
 bet you have a few questions!" he says.

>punch alter

 An invisible force prevents you from attacking your alter ego.

>examine newspaper

 According to the headline, Gary Hart is getting back into the
 presidential race. "Let the people decide!" he says. We'll see how
 that turns out.

 by Nameless

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nameless Tavern (exits: NW)</span>
 You are standing in a large tavern with creaky wooden floors. Laughter
 and commotion surround your every move while light flickers from
 candles atop wooden tables. The bartender nods at you as he tends to
 his customers.

 Type ABOUT to learn about Nameless Quest!
 Type VERBS for a list of commands!

 Someone walks up to the bar and orders a '64 Chateu Le Mont (excellent
 vintage!).

 Hanging on the wall is a dartboard. There are three red darts stuck in
 it!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shoreline (exits: W E)</span>
 The path, and everything else, comes to an end here at the grim, rocky
 shoreline. Sitting beside the pier is a fisherman. At the moment he
 has set his fishing pole aside to fry up a fish in a pan over a
 campfire. Undoubtedly it's one of the mackerel he has in a pail beside
 him.

>buy raw fish

 "Twelve gold," the fisherman says. You hand him the requested sum and
 his eyes go wide - apparently he hadn't expected you'd actually pay
 that much for a single fish! He gives you your mackerel, then,
 chuckling to himself, packs up his belongings and makes himself scarce
 before you have a chance to realize you've been had.

>take wand

 Taken.

>take clear ampule

 Taken.

>put clear in wand

 You load the large ampule of clear fluid into the wand.

>squeeze wand

 You hear the muffled sound of glass breaking - wince at the sting of
 the needle entering your thumb - and then you feel magical energy
 coursing through your body!

>ovidio me from fish

 SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG IS HAPPENING TO YOU. SOMETHING TERRIBLY WR--


     <span class="floydstyle i">*** You have died ***</span>



 You wake up.

 You are lying on your back in an unfamiliar bed in an unfamiliar room,
 staring at a white popcorn ceiling. You blink in disbelief. Seriously?
 That was all just a dream?

 There is a dresser across from the foot of your bed; you stagger to
 your feet, walk over to it, and peer into the mirror perched above it.
 Okay. Good. Not a dream. You still look like yourself. You're even
 still wearing your brown cloak. But then where are you? What happened?
 You try to think. The last thing you remember is...

 ...oh. Right. Your death. Which makes this the afterlife. And if that
 popcorn ceiling is any indication, you didn't end up where you might
 have hoped.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It doesn't have that "lived
 in" look that would mark this as your own room, but neither is it the
 sort of austerely professional space that would give it away as a
 hotel room.

 (Wait, "hotel"? How do you know that word...?)

 ...in any case, your best guess is that it's the guest room of someone
 else's house. Maybe it belongs to a friend of yours. (Do you have
 friends? You do hear voices downstairs.) It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom (nice to see the
 bathroom is <span class="floydstyle em">en suite</span>); another door is set into the wall
 across from the window. The floor is a medium-light hardwood, and the
 ceiling... has nothing wrong with it that a few thousand dollars'
 worth of asbestos abatement won't fix. (Except - "dollars"?
 "Asbestos"? Where are these words coming from?)

>in


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 Even more than the bedroom, this cramped bathroom shows this house's
 age. Not that it isn't well kept up - it looks like it's been recently
 cleaned - but the clunky styling of the fixtures suggests that it
 hasn't been renovated for a couple of generations. (How you know this,
 given that you've just come from a world where people wash in barrels
 and relieve themselves in buckets, you're not entirely sure.) The
 wallpaper is peeling a bit around the window set into the exterior
 wall; the ocean view from that window is reflected in the mirrored
 medicine cabinet on the tiled partition wall opposite it. Beneath the
 medicine cabinet is a sink. The far wall is also done in small white
 tile, chipped here and there. Near that wall, but not attached to it,
 is a bathtub; however, the towel rack is across the room, above the
 toilet. Next to the toilet is the doorway, which leads back to the
 bedroom.

 Enter one of the above (including the word SAY), <span class="floydstyle i">or any other</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">command:</span>
>say 1

 "Who are you?"

 "I'm you," he says cheerfully.
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

 Enter one of the above, or any other command:
>say 3

 "How can there be two of us?"

 "We are different iterations of the same adventurer," the other you
 explains. "We may have had different experiences in the quest world,
 but we began in the tavern as the same person."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "What's your name?"

 "My name is the same as yours," your double replies.
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "I don't know my name. Do you?"

 Your alter ego grins. "It's the same as mine," he says. Then, noticing
 that you're getting frustrated, he adds, "Look, I know where you're
 coming from. You didn't have a name in the quest world either, but it
 didn't matter, because you just thought of yourself as 'me,' and you
 didn't need any other name to distinguish yourself from those around
 you. But now you're talking to someone who also looks and sounds like
 'me,' and it'd be nice to have a label to put on me other than 'the
 other me.'" He shakes his head. "I'm confusing myself with my own
 sentence!" he says, chuckling.
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "I don't understand - WHY don't we have names?"

 "That gets into metaphysics," your other self says. "There are those
 who say that there is yet another level of existence out there - that
 of the meta-shapers who created this afterworld - and in that realm
 are countless inchoate souls, and with each iteration, one is infused
 into the adventurer's body. But every specific detail built into that
 body means a chance of a mismatch with the soul, you see. So to
 minimize the chance of rejection, we're as unmarked as possible! We
 <span class="floydstyle i">can't</span> have names, because the soul has to believe that 'you'
 means <span class="floydstyle i">that soul</span> - that it isn't just playing a role."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 disabled, we're adults, though fairly young...
 details like a name easier to accept?
 ---

>say 2

 "Wait. Compared to the details of an adventure, aren't details like a
 name easier to accept?"

 "I don't think I understand," the other you says.

 You try to think of a way to explain. "You said that a soul might
 reject being infused into someone with a name. 'John? My name's not
 John. This isn't me!' But how could a soul like that simultaneously
 <span class="floydstyle i">accept</span> that, hey, that <span class="floydstyle i">is</span> me fighting that dragon?
 Doesn't your account imply that only souls that already saw themselves
 as dragon-fighters - not as a role to take on, but as an inherent part
 of their identity - could be infused into us?"

 "Maybe so," your alter ego says with equanimity. "Look, this is all
 beyond my pay grade. I'm here to talk about the afterworld, not the,
 you know, the 'beforeworld.' If there really is one."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 disabled, we're adults, though fairly young...
 ---

>say 2

 "What do you mean by 'iterations'?"

 "The world of the quest is cyclical," your alter ego explains. "The
 time loop begins with one of us in the tavern. Most recently, that was
 you. The sequence of events then unfolds as follows: the adventurer
 goes outside - one way or another - and meets the old man, who tells
 the adventurer about the dragon. The adventurer then tries to find a
 way to kill the dragon, and somewhere along the line, meets a grisly
 end. That adventurer is then whisked here, while the game world
 returns to its starting point, with a new adventurer and a new attempt
 to complete the quest. Each of those loops is called an 'iteration.'
 We are all iterations of the adventurer, and we've each had an
 iteration of the adventure. Make sense?"
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 disabled, we're adults, though fairly young...
 ---

>say 1

 "How can you say that we're unmarked? We're male, we're not disabled,
 we're adults, though fairly young..."

 "Those are all defaults!" your alter ego protests. "If we were old, or
 children, the quest would be all about being old, or a child. If we
 were handicapped, the quest would be all about being handicapped. If
 we were female, the quest would be all about being female. But we're
 normal, so the quest is about the quest!"
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 the world...?
 ---

>say 1

 "Being male is 'normal'? Aren't there more women than men in the
 world...?"

 "Not in this one," your double chuckles. "You might say that 'female'
 is just another word for 'absent.' But please," he says, holding up a
 hand, "no psychoanalysis."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "So there are others like us in here?"

 "Oh, yes, dozens," the other you says. "Hundreds. A lot of them are
 upstairs sleeping at any given point, but you'll see lots of copies of
 you and me as you wander around the house. That's the main reason I
 wanted to talk to you - so you wouldn't freak out."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "Will there be more of us showing up later?"

 "Almost certainly," says your double.
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 2

 "What if I actually finish the quest?"

 "Hmm, I don't actually know whether that's even possible," your double
 says. "No one who's ever come here has successfully completed it.
 There's at least one guy here who claims to have killed the dragon and
 <span class="floydstyle i">still</span> wound up getting killed immediately afterward. I suspect
 that there's a reason it's called 'Endless Quest'..."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 2

 "The quest is actually called 'Nameless Quest' now."

 "Oh," says your alter ego. "That's not a very good name, is it?"
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "Are we stuck here forever?"

 "I wouldn't call it 'stuck,'" your alter ego says. "I like it here!
 It's why I've stayed. You don't have to stay if you don't want to -
 you can walk right back into the adventure world from here. Though
 maybe not in the way you expect..." He chuckles.
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "How do I get back to the quest?"

 "You'll probably just get yourself killed again if your puzzle-solving
 skills aren't even sharp enough to find your way back," your double
 cautions you. "Now, me, I find that if I can't figure something out,
 beating my head against it doesn't help. Try doing something different
 for a while and come back to it fresh. Play a game, perhaps...?"
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "How do I get back to the quest?"

 "If you're still asking that, it means you haven't played the right
 game," your alter ego says. "At least not all the way through."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 1

 "How do I get back to the quest?"

 "If you're still asking that, it means you haven't played the right
 game," your alter ego says. "At least not all the way through."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 2

 "What's the story with that endless hallway upstairs?"

 "Yeah, around here space-time doesn't always work the way you'd
 think," your double says. "The hallway works like that because
 everyone needs a place to stay, but with new adventurers showing up
 all the time, there can't be a fixed number of rooms - they're
 dynamically allocated, making the hallway indefinitely large. So it
 winds up with some weird properties."
 ---
 speaking to your alter ego
 ---

>say 2

 "Bye for now!"

 "Okay, have fun," your alter ego asks. "I'll be in the library if you
 need me for anything!" He slaps his forehead. "Almost forgot! You'll
 need this." He pats himself down and retrieves a key from the pocket
 of his cloak. "For the safe in your room. The bedroom doors don't have
 locks so some people like to have a place to store things." He hands
 over the key, picks up his newspaper, and heads down the hallway to
 the north.

 "White Russians? Ivan Drago? Heh heh heh heh."

 An archway leads north into the kitchen.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: WEAPON SHOP, COTTAGE, MAGIC, MACHINE, DWARVES.
 (Some of these alternate versions of you are chatting with each other
 and no one seems to mind. Presumably it would be fine for you to start
 a conversation as well, even with the movie playing.)

 On the TV, James Brown lip-syncs to "Living in America" as Apollo
 Creed gyrates in an Uncle Sam outfit.

 "What hints can you give me about the dwarves?"

 "The assistance of the dwarves is crucial to your quest," your double
 says. "Not only do they supply you with the Wyrmender sword that you
 need to kill the dragon, but it's also from the dwarves that you get
 the fuel you need to power the machine that tempers your shield."

 On the TV, James Brown sinks to his knees. Danny Ray drapes a cape
 over him.

>say 1

 "What else can you tell me about the dwarves?"

 "First, you need to get into the mines where the dwarves live," the
 other you explains. "You won't find any kind of door. Instead, you
 will find three pegs. On the first peg will be a conical stack of
 seven discs: gold, silver, bronze, copper, iron, tin, and lead. To
 open the entrance to the mines, you will need to move the discs to the
 third peg without ever putting a larger disc on top of a smaller one."

 On the TV, the ring announcer, a man with an outlandish
 handlebar-and-then-some mustache, introduces the "Eye-talian Stallion"
 to the appreciative crowd.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 It looks like this kitchen has been updated piecemeal. The sleek black
 refrigerator with in-door water and ice dispensers is clearly one of
 the latest models, while the beige and brown buttons on the wood-grain
 microwave speak of an earlier generation, and the loudly chugging teal
 dishwasher a generation before that. The oven is of indeterminate age,
 though the fact that the clock on it is analog rather than digital
 suggests a relatively early date. A screen door leads north to the
 backyard, while an archway to the south will return you to the TV
 room.

 An adventurer who looks exactly like you sets down a cocktail down the
 counter, next to the sink, and beckons you over. "White Russian?" he
 offers. "Last one of the batch I just made!"

>take cocktail

 (the cocktail expert)
 The cocktail expert is too large for you to pick up.

>take white russian

 Taken.

>drink white russian

 You down the White Russian in a few gulps. It's okay, but your double
 probably shouldn't go looking for a bartending job.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Backyard</span>
 This is a small backyard, marked off by a tall wooden fence. A small
 patio of volcanic rock tiles plays host to a grill, which a couple of
 your doubles are tending to, while out on the grass stands a small
 shed and a recycling bin. A gate leads east.

>examine grill

 It's putting out an awful lot of smoke, but your alter egos don't seem
 concerned.

>examine shed

 A crude, boxy wooden structure - it looks like it's essentially a
 freestanding closet. The door is closed. "If you're looking for the
 guy who lives in there, he's not around right now," says one of the
 doubles of yours tending the grill. "Check back later - he comes and
 goes."

>open shed

 It seems to be locked.

>examine bin

 The recycling bin is a large receptacle made of tough blue plastic;
 pressed into it are the words <span class="floydstyle i">ALUMINUM ONLY</span>. Beneath that
 warning is a sort of funnel, allowing you to put things in (provided
 they're made of aluminum) but not to take anything out.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 This stretch of beach appears to be under the same bubble of
 protection as the house; as you look to the south, you can see the
 shoreline curving away toward the southwest, and hundreds of trolls
 are struggling to walk up and harass you, but an invisible force holds
 them back. You are therefore blessedly alone with the sea, the rocks,
 the thin strand of pebbly sand, and the still, humid air.

 A pier extends eastward from the shoreline. A small rowboat is tied to
 the end of it, bobbing as the surf rolls gently in and out.

>exits

>examine rowboat

 The handmade wooden rowboat looks like it was made to seat only one,
 or possibly two if they're very close friends.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TV Room</span>
 The lights are off in this room, but you can still see reasonably
 well, thanks to the glow of the boxy big-screen television. And what
 you see is a room full of clones of you, all in adventurers' cloaks,
 sitting on battered couches watching <span class="floydstyle em">Rocky IV</span> on Betamax. An
 archway leads north into the kitchen.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Game Room</span>
 This is a large room - apparently a later addition to the original
 house, if the faux wood paneling and hideous mint-green shag carpeting
 are anything to go by. In the near corner stand a quartet of arcade
 cabinets, while at the other end of the room, near the entrance to the
 library, is a pool table; a couple of adventurers are playing a game
 of 9-ball. Empty and half-empty beer bottles are everywhere.

 A dartboard hangs on the wall opposite the main egress, which lies to
 the south. There is a dart in it.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: ROC'S NEST, DRAGON, JEWELRY SHOP.

 Several adventurers are gathered around a large round table, playing
 some sort of game you don't recognize. They're all wearing nametags,
 but none of them have any writing on them; instead, they are solid
 colors: red, green, purple, yellow, blue, and brown. Seeing you
 looking around, Red pats the empty teal seat next to him. "Sit! Fun

>take dart

 You find that some invisible force prevents you from throwing things.

>sit on teal seat

 You sit down in the teal chair and Red slides you a stack of chips.
 "All right," he says, "here are the rules. Each turn you draw a token
 with a number on it from 1 to 99. If you think you have the highest
 number - or can bluff the other players into thinking you do - you can
 bid on first place. You'll have chances to drop out if you change your
 mind after seeing what everyone else does. If more than one player
 stays in the bidding, there's a showdown and they show their tokens.
 The winner gets first place. The losers get moved into the LAST
 places, with the lowest number in dead last. Then there's an auction
 for second, for third, and so on. At the end of the round, chips get
 distributed from the losers to the winners. Don't worry, you'll get
 the hang of it. Let's play!"

 The bag of tokens is passed around. You reach in and pull out one that
 says <span class="floydstyle i">76</span>.

 Unfortunately, this one seems to be out of order. The screen says,

>play space

 You fire off a few shots, knocking off an enemy ship in the middle of
 the bottom row. A sprite of Martin Amis jogs out onto the screen. "The
 phalanx of enemy invaders moves laterally across a grid not much wider
 than itself," he notes. "When it reaches the edge of the grid, the
 whole army lowers a notch. Rule one: <span class="floydstyle i">narrow that phalanx</span>.
 Before you do anything else, take out at least three enemy columns
 either on the left-hand side or the right (for Waves 1 and 2, the left
 is recommended). Thereafter the aliens will take much longer to cross
 their grid and slip down another rung. Keep on working from the sides:
 you'll find that the invaders take forever to trudge and shuffle back
 and forth, and you can pick them off in your own sweet time." You
 quickly tire of his endless kibitzing and let your remaining cannons
 get destroyed.

 The bookcases appear to be made of mahogany, but when you look closer

 between pasta and enchiladas; there's also a snacking table with some
 Mediterranean spreads and pita chips, and a table of plates and
 napkins and things. And as no buffet would be complete without
 dessert, one table is devoted to different types of pie. All around,

 The beach, however, is packed solid with trolls from the waterline all

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is
 set into the wall across from the window.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You are standing in a nondescript hallway: plain white walls, a
 threadbare runner carpet. The door to your bedroom is at one end of
 the hallway, the first door on the right-hand side at the top of a
 flight of stairs that spirals downward to an unseen lower floor. There
 is no other end to the hallway; it stretches on forever to the north,
 with doors at regular intervals.

>go west

 There is no exit in that direction. [Type EXITS for a list of exits.]

>go down

 You follow the curving staircase downward...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the
 stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a
 hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east
 is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside
 is to the south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You are in a hallway with a slightly uneven, creaky wooden floor.
 Archways to the north and west lead to large rooms full of adventurers
 in brown cloaks; to the south is a foyer and, beyond that, the front
 door.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Game Room</span>
 This is a large room - apparently a later addition to the original
 house, if the faux wood paneling and hideous mint-green shag carpeting
 are anything to go by. In the near corner stand a quartet of arcade
 cabinets, while at the other end of the room, near the entrance to the
 library, is a pool table; a couple of adventurers are playing a game
 of 9-ball. Empty and half-empty beer bottles are everywhere.

 A dartboard hangs on the wall opposite the main egress, which lies to
 the south. There is a single hole in it.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: ROC'S NEST, DRAGON, JEWELRY SHOP.

 The table once occupied by the gamers is no longer in use.

>examine table

 You can make out a faint design in the faded Formica tabletop: a pair
 of criss-crossing roads, a cluster of small buildings, a deep trench
 knifing its way to the sea, a cave on the far side. Clearly this is a
 representation of the world of the quest.

>enter

 There is no exit in that direction. [Type EXITS for a list of exits.]

>enter portal

 You climb onto the table, and as your foot touches the square engraved
 upon it that represents the tavern, you feel the world turn
 inside-out...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nameless Tavern (exits: NW)</span>
 You are standing in a large tavern with creaky wooden floors. Laughter
 and commotion surround your every move while light flickers from
 candles atop wooden tables. The bartender nods at you as he tends to
 his customers.

 Type ABOUT to learn about Nameless Quest!

 Hanging on the wall is a dartboard. There are three red darts stuck in

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Village Square (exits: N W E S SE)</span>
 You are at the crossroads of a tiny village like many others you have
 seen since you have been adventuring. The main street runs east and
 west, while a smaller one runs north and south.

 You are very tired. The urge to sleep is overpowering!

>sleep

 You slump down onto the dusty ground, too tired to find proper
 lodgings. Sleep is immediate.



 ...zzzzzzz...

 You are woken by someone tugging on your sleeve! You squint and see
 that it is an old man.

 "It's you!" he gasps. "The chosen one!"

 Description: An old, mostly bald man with a long white beard, dressed
 in rags and a tattered brown cloak.

 "I am-- well, my name is not important," the old man says. "But the
 prophecies have spoken of one who would free this poor land from the
 ravages of the dragon who lives to the south!" He pauses. "It will not
 be easy," he warns. "First you must prove your mettle. This quest will
 test your body, mind, and heart! For you must perform a feat of
 strength, outwit a fiendishly complex machine, and win the affections
 of a mysterious sorceress to defeat the dragon!"

>take old man's cloak

 That was only understood as far as wanting to take the old man.

>take tattered cloak

 At least one of the things you mentioned doesn't seem to be here!

>frosti man

 You don't have nearly enough magical energy to FROSTI anyone!

 "I can say no more!" the old man cries. He runs off down the road and
 into the wilderness.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western End of Village (exits: N W E S)</span>
 This is the western end of a small, nameless village. The main road
 runs west toward the shoreline and east into the center of town. The
 only buildings of interest are a pair of shops: a plain-looking weapon
 shop to the south and a slightly fancier-looking fishing shop to the
 north.

 A green pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the western
 boundary of the village.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Weapon Shop (exits: N S)</span>
 This is a small, dusty weapon shop. The wall behind the counter is
 lined with swords and shields of all sizes and descriptions, along
 with related items such as belts with scabbards. An enormous,
 bowl-shaped shield and a fine broadsword are on prominent display next
 to a dartboard. A sign says, "Win this sword and shield by hitting a
 bullseye! One gold to try your luck!"

 The shop owner watches you vigilantly!

 On the counter you see a purple dart.

>buy dart

 "Okay, fire away," the shop owner says, chuckling a little.


 Gyahhh! What is this thing MADE of? It must have an adamant core or
 something. It takes all your strength just to lift it! (But you do.)

>throw dart

 What do you want to throw the heavy purple dart at?

>throw dart at dart board

 Your throw barely clears the counter before the dart drops to the
 floor. "Better luck next time," the shop owner snickers, picking up
 the dart with a great effort and placing it on the counter.

 A customer walks in the door, and the owner turns to attend to him.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northern End of Village (exits: N NE S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads south to the village square and

 a small cottage.

 A blue pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the northern

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N SW)</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N S)</span>
 You are on a path that leads north to the door of a small cottage and
 south toward a country road. Oddly, though the path itself is just a
 dirt track through a wide clearing in the forest, it is crisscrossed
 by irregularly placed strips of stone!



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Cottage (exits: N S)</span>
 In front of you, immediately to the north, lies a well-maintained
 white cottage. A black cat blinks curiously at you from a window sill;
 as you approach, it hops down and skitters away. A path leads south.

 There is a small mailbox here.
 A woman's voice calls out, "MALSXLOSI." Then you hear a resounding
 CHUNK!! sound. Was that the door unlocking?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cottage (exits: NONE!)</span>
 The cottage is smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside,
 and is nearly empty, furnished only with a rickety wooden table.
 Somehow, there are no exits - not even the door you walked in through!
 Where did it go?

 "I am told you are the chosen one," says the woman's voice, cold but
 soft. "I am-- well, my name is not important."


 Time passes.

 "As the chosen one, you are naturally endowed with a certain amount of
 magical energy," the voice says. "Not as much as someone who has
 studied sorcery, but enough to cast Level 1 spells. To cast stronger
 ones, you will need some assistance."

 A wand magically appears on the table in front of you. "Take the

 A wand magically appears on the table in front of you. "Take the

 As you pick up the wand, you feel a pricking sensation against your
 thumb. You notice that the base of the wand is equipped with a small
 needle!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine needle

 You've never really understood how these magic wands work.

 "The wand is actually a hollow tube," the voice says. "To cast a Level
 2 or Level 3 spell, you will insert an ampule of a potion into the
 wand. Squeeze the wand, and the ampule will be crushed and the potion
 will flow through the needle into your bloodstream, charging you with
 its magical energy. The effect does not last long, and you must cast
 the spell while you are still energized!"

 A ampule of cloudy fluid appears on the table. "Let's try it," the
 voice says. "Take the ampule."

 coursing through your body!

 "Quick!" the voice says. "Cast the spell just like the book says:

 mailbox outside that should help you in your quest. If you encounter
 other spells along the way, feel free to use them - but don't go more
 than two levels above your base skill level. Good luck." She clears
 her throat. "FORPELI!"

 For a terrifying moment you feel as though you are free-falling in
 every direction at once! Then all is still, and you find yourself...

 As you proceed down the path you hear a grinding sound behind you, and

 you've ever seen - a piece of metal that gives off a curiously narrow
 blue flame - to a rough, round rock. He looks up sharply as you enter.

 "Grf," he says. "It's you. Uh... forget you saw this." He quickly

 north is a small shop.

 A yellow pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the eastern
 boundary of the village.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Village Square (exits: N W E S SE)</span>
 You are at the crossroads of a tiny village like many others you have
 seen since you have been adventuring. The main street runs east and
 west, while a smaller one runs north and south.


 The tavern is closed!



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western End of Village (exits: N W E S)</span>
 This is the western end of a small, nameless village. The main road
 runs west toward the shoreline and east into the center of town. The
 only buildings of interest are a pair of shops: a plain-looking weapon
 shop to the south and a slightly fancier-looking fishing shop to the
 north.

 A green pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the western
 boundary of the village.


 "What's that in your hand?" the weapon shop owner asks as you walk in.
 "Some kind of spellbook? I don't allow sorcerers in here! Get out!"
 You do as you're told.


 Dropped.


 Taken.


 You put the spellbook into the brown cloak.


 "Oh no you don't!" the weapon shop owner shouts as you walk in. "I
 remember you! Get out of my store!" You beat a hasty retreat.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Village Square (exits: N W E S SE)</span>

 west, while a smaller one runs north and south.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern End of Village (exits: N E S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads north to the village square and
 south to a rickety bridge that spans a deep chasm; you can see the
 dragon's cave on the other side. The ground near the foot of the
 bridge is darkly stained. A cave smaller than the dragon's lair lies
 to the east.

 A troll lurks by the bridge, flipping through a book titled
 <span class="floydstyle em">English Usage</span>. When it sees you, it straightens up with a
 start and quickly flings the book into the chasm. "A new adventurer!"
 it shrieks. "Have you come to free us from the dragon? Then I, Lonk
 the Troll, would like to thank you for your courage and bravery!
 Please accept this obsequious smile as a token of gratitude." You have
 a sneaking suspicion this greeting is not heartfelt.

 A red pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the southern
 boundary of the village.


 You land a solid blow, doing 16 points of damage!


 You land a glancing blow, doing 9 points of damage! "Oof!" the troll
 says. "I see you've found an outlet for your sexual frustration!"


 You land a glancing blow, doing 8 points of damage! "Wuf!" the troll
 says. "What's the problem, dear? Constipated?"

 A knight on horseback comes charging in from the north, blowing right
 by you and the troll. "Never fear, villagers!" he declares as he
 passes. "I'll rid your land of this fiendish monster!" You watch as he
 races across the bridge and into the dragon's cave.

 Another troll emerges from under the bridge. "Greetings, O most virile

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dragon's Lair (exits: N)</span>
 You are in a large cave that smells distinctly of brimstone. All
 around you lie the charred remains of those who have tried to kill the
 dragon before you... and failed.

 Before you, lying atop a veritable mountain of gold crowns, rings,
 nuggets, goblets, and other bits of aurous treasure, is an enormous

 it says, directly into your mind. With a yawn, it sits up.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom </span> (on the bed)
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is
 set into the wall across from the window.

 You rub your eyes, stretch, and get out of bed.

>examine safe

 A square door of thick black iron, slightly pitted with age, with a
 large, ostentatious lock on one side.


 Inventory:
   a brown cloak (being worn)
     a key

 Taken.


 You unlock the safe.


 You open the safe, revealing a glass, a can of beer and a towel.


 The window is closed.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 Even more than the bedroom, this cramped bathroom shows this house's
 age. Not that it isn't well kept up - it looks like it's been recently
 cleaned - but the clunky styling of the fixtures suggests that it
 hasn't been renovated for a couple of generations. The wallpaper is
 peeling a bit around the window set into the exterior wall; the ocean
 view from that window is reflected in the mirrored medicine cabinet on
 the tiled partition wall opposite it. Beneath the medicine cabinet is
 a sink. The far wall is also done in small white tile, chipped here
 and there. Near that wall, but not attached to it, is a bathtub;
 however, the towel rack is across the room, above the toilet. Next to
 the toilet is the doorway, which leads back to the bedroom.


 [!: Noun error.]


 A single-bar towel rack.


 You open the medicine cabinet.


 The medicine cabinet is empty.

 You open the window, but the cool sea breeze you might have been
 hoping for fails to materialize - the air outside is warm and still.


 You find that some invisible force prevents you from jumping out the
 window.


 You gaze out over the sea. Off in the distance, past the seagulls
 lazily flapping from pier to pier, you can see the faintest hint of a
 distant shore...


 [!: Noun error.]

>whistle

 [!: Verb error.]


 You close the safe and head out to the...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You are standing in a nondescript hallway: plain white walls, a
 threadbare runner carpet. The door to your bedroom is at one end of
 the hallway, the first door on the right-hand side at the top of a
 flight of stairs that spirals downward to an unseen lower floor. There
 is no other end to the hallway; it stretches on forever to the north,
 with doors at regular intervals.


 You follow the curving staircase downward...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the
 stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a
 hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east
 is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside
 is to the south.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Porch</span>
 This is a rectangular porch that extends along the entire length of
 the front of the house, whose front door lies to the north. A wooden
 railing, about waist high, runs along the border of the porch, and
 steps lead down to the beach.

 The beach, however, is packed solid with trolls from the waterline all
 the way up to a magical barrier just in front of the house. It's more
 than a little alarming to see the hundreds upon hundreds of them just
 inches away, with nothing visible between you, but the barrier seems
 to be holding.

 Among the many trolls crowding the beach is one you recognize from the
 world of the quest - and while the others have been magically
 silenced, this one is unaffected by the protection spell. "So, I see
 you've finally come to join your chummy friends!" it sneers.
 ---
 speaking to Lonk the troll
 inimical enemy or something?
 suddenly in the 1920s somehow?
 ---


 "As opposed to my non-chummy friends? Does that make you my inimical
 enemy or something?"

 The troll pauses, and reflexively attempts to spit at you, but its
 saliva splashes off the invisible barrier.


 The railing only comes up to your waist, and the slats are widely
 spaced; clearly this is not what's keeping the trolls from invading
 the porch.

>take lonk

 Lonk the troll is too large for you to pick up.


 [Who do you mean, the trolls or Lonk the troll?]


 ---
 speaking to Lonk the troll
 (Nothing to say!)
 ---

>examine lonk

 It's hard to tell the trolls apart, but this one looks to be the most
 recent arrival. It's slightly less weatherbeaten than the rest, at any
 rate.


 Surely you're not that hard up for conversation.


 Even a creature that's lovable in isolation tends to repulse when
 there are enough of them. A kitten is cute; a writhing mass of
 hundreds of kittens is disturbing. Now imagine how loathsome a troll
 is by itself, and multiply by several hundred. The tableau before you
 is unutterably vile.


 "Going?" the troll calls after you. "Surely not back to the quest! Why
 would you return to some sham arena, conveniently vague and shallow
 for the puzzles to fit, when you could stay here, with me?"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the
 stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a
 hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east
 is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside
 is to the south.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TV Room</span>
 The lights are off in this room, but you can still see reasonably
 well, thanks to the glow of the boxy big-screen television. And what
 you see is a room full of clones of you, all in adventurers' cloaks,
 sitting on battered couches watching <span class="floydstyle em">Rocky IV</span> on Betamax. An
 archway leads north into the kitchen.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: TAVERN, DRAGON, TROLLS, DWARVES. (Some of these
 alternate versions of you are chatting with each other and no one
 seems to mind.)

 On the TV, Rocky gives Adrian an early anniversary present, or as he
 terms it, a "prize."



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 It looks like this kitchen has been updated piecemeal. The sleek black
 refrigerator with in-door water and ice dispensers is clearly one of
 the latest models, while the beige and brown buttons on the wood-grain
 microwave speak of an earlier generation, and the loudly chugging teal
 dishwasher a generation before that. The oven is of indeterminate age,
 though the fact that the clock on it is analog rather than digital
 suggests a relatively early date. A screen door leads north to the
 backyard, while an archway to the south will return you to the TV
 room.

 One of your doubles tidies up the kitchen.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Backyard</span>
 This is a small backyard, marked off by a tall wooden fence. A small
 patio of volcanic rock tiles plays host to a grill, which a couple of
 your doubles are tending to, while out on the grass stands a small
 shed and a recycling bin. A gate leads east.


 That's already open.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beach</span>
 This stretch of beach appears to be under the same bubble of
 protection as the house; as you look to the south, you can see the
 shoreline curving away toward the southwest, and hundreds of trolls
 are struggling to walk up and harass you, but an invisible force holds
 them back. You are therefore blessedly alone with the sea, the rocks,
 the thin strand of pebbly sand, and the still, humid air.

 A pier extends eastward from the shoreline. A small rowboat is tied to
 the end of it, bobbing as the surf rolls gently in and out.


 An invisible force prevents you from walking out to the end of the
 pier.


 The handmade wooden rowboat looks like it was made to seat only one,
 or possibly two if they're very close friends.

>examine trolls

 You glance at the hundreds of trolls that lie that way - but not for
 too long, as the attention might make them strong enough to break
 through the invisible barrier.


 An invisible barrier keeps you from doing anything with the boat
 except gazing at it from afar.

 A crude, boxy wooden structure - it looks like it's essentially a

 "I am-- well, my name is not important," the old man says. "But the
 prophecies have spoken of one who would free this poor land from the
 ravages of the dragon who lives to the south!" He pauses. "It will not
 be easy," he warns. "First you must prove your mettle. This quest will
 test your body, mind, and heart! For you must perform a feat of

 of a mysterious sorceress to defeat the dragon!"

 The sign out front said this was a jewelry shop, but inside you find
 no display cases of jewelry or anything else to suggest that this is a

 glowing stripes, sitting at a desk and applying the strangest torch
 you've ever seen - a piece of metal that gives off a curiously narrow
 blue flame - to a rough, round rock. He looks up sharply as you enter.

 "Grf," he says. "It's you. Uh... forget you saw this." He quickly
 gathers up his things, waves his scepter, and walks off through the

 A troll lurks by the bridge, flipping through a book titled

 start and quickly flings the book into the chasm. "A new adventurer!"
 it shrieks. "Have you come to free us from the dragon? Then I, Lonk

 Please accept this obsequious smile as a token of gratitude." You have

 CHUNK!! sound. Was that the door unlocking?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cottage (exits: NONE!)</span>
 The cottage is smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside,
 and is nearly empty, furnished only with a rickety wooden table.
 Somehow, there are no exits - not even the door you walked in through!
 Where did it go?

 "I am told you are the chosen one," says the woman's voice, cold but
 soft. "I am-- well, my name is not important."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "As the chosen one, you are naturally endowed with a certain amount of
 magical energy," the voice says. "Not as much as someone who has
 studied sorcery, but enough to cast Level 1 spells. To cast stronger
 ones, you will need some assistance."

 A wand magically appears on the table in front of you. "Take the
 wand," the voice says.

>take wand

 As you pick up the wand, you feel a pricking sensation against your
 thumb. You notice that the base of the wand is equipped with a small
 needle!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>put rock in wand

 The wand can only contain ampules of magical potions!

 "The wand is actually a hollow tube," the voice says. "To cast a Level
 2 or Level 3 spell, you will insert an ampule of a potion into the
 wand. Squeeze the wand, and the ampule will be crushed and the potion
 will flow through the needle into your bloodstream, charging you with
 its magical energy. The effect does not last long, and you must cast
 the spell while you are still energized!"

 A ampule of cloudy fluid appears on the table. "Let's try it," the
 voice says. "Take the ampule."

>take ampule

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>put it in wand

 "Not yet," the voice says.

 A slender spellbook appears on the table before you. "This spellbook
 will magically track what ampules you have in your possession and
 instruct you in the proper formation of your spells," the voice says.
 "I'll give you a few moments before we proceed. First, take the book
 and read it - it should only take a moment. Then put the ampule into
 the wand, and we can continue."

 You load the ampule of cloudy fluid into the wand.

 "Now squeeze the wand," the voice says.

>squeeze wand

 You hear the muffled sound of glass breaking - wince at the sting of
 the needle entering your thumb - and then you feel magical energy
 coursing through your body!

 "Quick!" the voice says. "Cast the spell just like the book says:
 SXVEBI!"

>sxvebi

 You feel your stomach lurch and look down to find that you are
 suddenly floating several inches off the ground! You've cast a
 levitation spell! (A weak one, but still.)

>examine ceiling

 There is no path that leads upward, and while you can <span class="floydstyle i">float</span>,
 you cannot fly!

 The magical energy leaves your body. As it does, you gently return to
 the ground.

 "All right," the voice says. "I have discharged my duty. You've
 received your training, and I've just placed some ampules in the
 mailbox outside that should help you in your quest. If you encounter
 other spells along the way, feel free to use them - but don't go more
 than two levels above your base skill level. Good luck." She clears
 her throat. "FORPELI!"

 For a terrifying moment you feel as though you are free-falling in
 every direction at once! Then all is still, and you find yourself...

     <span class="floydstyle i">*** You have died ***</span>




 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom </span> (on the bed)
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is
 set into the wall across from the window.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You are standing in a nondescript hallway: plain white walls, a
 threadbare runner carpet. The door to your bedroom is at one end of
 the hallway, the first door on the right-hand side at the top of a
 flight of stairs that spirals downward to an unseen lower floor. There
 is no other end to the hallway; it stretches on forever to the north,
 with doors at regular intervals.

>go down

 You follow the curving staircase downward...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the
 stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a
 hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east
 is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside
 is to the south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Porch</span>
 This is a rectangular porch that extends along the entire length of
 the front of the house, whose front door lies to the north. A wooden
 railing, about waist high, runs along the border of the porch, and
 steps lead down to the beach.

 The beach, however, is packed solid with trolls from the waterline all
 the way up to a magical barrier just in front of the house. It's more
 than a little alarming to see the hundreds upon hundreds of them just
 inches away, with nothing visible between you, but the barrier seems
 to be holding.

>examine trolls

 Even a creature that's lovable in isolation tends to repulse when
 there are enough of them. A kitten is cute; a writhing mass of
 hundreds of kittens is disturbing. Now imagine how loathsome a troll
 is by itself, and multiply by several hundred. The tableau before you
 is unutterably vile.

>examine lonk

>climb barrier

 Maybe you had best let the barrier be. It seems like the sort of thing
 that might stop working if you think about it too much.

 Nothing indicates that the barrier is even there other than the fact
 that the trolls don't swarm into the house.

 is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside
 is to the south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You are in a hallway with a slightly uneven, creaky wooden floor.
 Archways to the north and west lead to large rooms full of adventurers
 in brown cloaks; to the south is a foyer and, beyond that, the front
 door.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Game Room</span>
 This is a large room - apparently a later addition to the original
 house, if the faux wood paneling and hideous mint-green shag carpeting
 are anything to go by. In the near corner stand a quartet of arcade
 cabinets, while at the other end of the room, near the entrance to the
 library, is a pool table; a couple of adventurers are playing a game
 of 9-ball. Empty and half-empty beer bottles are everywhere.

 A dartboard hangs on the wall opposite the main egress, which lies to
 the south. There is a single hole in it.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: WEAPON SHOP, LABYRINTH, MACHINE, DRAGON,
 KNIGHTS.

 The table once occupied by the gamers is no longer in use.

>enter portal

 You climb onto the table, and as your foot touches the square engraved
 upon it that represents the tavern, you feel the world turn
 inside-out...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nameless Tavern (exits: NW)</span>
 You are standing in a large tavern with creaky wooden floors. Laughter
 and commotion surround your every move while light flickers from
 candles atop wooden tables. The bartender nods at you as he tends to
 his customers.

 Type ABOUT to learn about Nameless Quest!
 Type VERBS for a list of commands!

 Hanging on the wall is a dartboard. There are three red darts stuck in
 it!

 Someone walks up to the bar and orders a '64 Chateu Le Mont (excellent
 vintage!).

>go northwest

 On your way out, a tavern bouncer frisks you. "Okay, yer clean," he
 grumbles, and lets you go.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Village Square (exits: N W E S SE)</span>
 You are at the crossroads of a tiny village like many others you have
 seen since you have been adventuring. The main street runs east and
 west, while a smaller one runs north and south.

 You are very tired. The urge to sleep is overpowering!

>sleep

 You slump down onto the dusty ground, too tired to find proper
 lodgings. Sleep is immediate.



 ...zzzzzzz...

 You are woken by someone tugging on your sleeve! You squint and see
 that it is an old man.

 "It's you!" he gasps. "The chosen one!"

>wait

 Time passes.

 "I am-- well, my name is not important," the old man says. "But the
 prophecies have spoken of one who would free this poor land from the
 ravages of the dragon who lives to the south!" He pauses. "It will not
 be easy," he warns. "First you must prove your mettle. This quest will
 test your body, mind, and heart! For you must perform a feat of
 strength, outwit a fiendishly complex machine, and win the affections
 of a mysterious sorceress to defeat the dragon!"

>wait

 Time passes.

 "I can say no more!" the old man cries. He runs off down the road and
 into the wilderness.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northern End of Village (exits: N NE S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads south to the village square and
 north into the forest. To the northeast you see a long path leading to
 a small cottage.

 A green pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the northern
 boundary of the village.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Village Square (exits: N W E S SE)</span>
 You are at the crossroads of a tiny village like many others you have
 seen since you have been adventuring. The main street runs east and
 west, while a smaller one runs north and south.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western End of Village (exits: N W E S)</span>
 This is the western end of a small, nameless village. The main road
 runs west toward the shoreline and east into the center of town. The
 only buildings of interest are a pair of shops: a plain-looking weapon
 shop to the south and a slightly fancier-looking fishing shop to the
 north.

 A yellow pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the western
 boundary of the village.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shoreline (exits: W E)</span>
 The path, and everything else, comes to an end here at the grim, rocky
 shoreline. Sitting beside the pier is a fisherman. At the moment he
 has set his fishing pole aside to fry up a fish in a pan over a
 campfire. Undoubtedly it's one of the mackerel he has in a pail beside
 him... and the smell makes your stomach rumble! You're starting to
 feel rather hungry.

>buy fish

 (the mackerel)
 "Twelve gold for a fish out of the pail," the fisherman says. "Fifteen
 if you want a fried one. You want cooked or uncooked?"

>uncooked

 "Twelve gold," the fisherman says. You hand him the requested sum and
 his eyes go wide - apparently he hadn't expected you'd actually pay
 that much for a single fish! He gives you your mackerel, then,
 chuckling to himself, packs up his belongings and makes himself scarce
 before you have a chance to realize you've been had.

>put fish in pcoket

 At least one of the things you mentioned doesn't seem to be here!

>inventory

 Inventory:
   a mackerel
   forty-eight gold
   a brown cloak (being worn)

>put mackerel in pocket

 You put the mackerel into the brown cloak.

>go east

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northern End of Village (exits: N NE S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads south to the village square and
 north into the forest. To the northeast you see a long path leading to
 a small cottage.

 A green pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the northern
 boundary of the village.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N SW)</span>
 You are on a path that leads southwest to a country road and north
 toward a small cottage.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N S)</span>
 You are on a path that leads north to the door of a small cottage and
 south toward a country road. Oddly, though the path itself is just a
 dirt track through a wide clearing in the forest, it is crisscrossed
 by irregularly placed strips of stone!

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Cottage (exits: N S)</span>
 In front of you, immediately to the north, lies a well-maintained
 white cottage. A black cat blinks curiously at you from a window sill;
 as you approach, it hops down and skitters away. A path leads south.

 There is a small mailbox here.

>open mailbox

 You open the mailbox, revealing a leaflet.

>take leaflet

 Taken.

>read it

 "WELCOME TO NAMELESS QUEST v2.0.12!

 NAMELESS QUEST is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it
 you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by
 mortals. No BBS should be without one! And Endless BBS isn't! Hehehe."

 [Your score has just gone up by fifty points.]

>put it in pocket

 You put the leaflet into the brown cloak.

>knock on door

 A woman's voice calls out, "MALSXLOSI." Then you hear a resounding
 CHUNK!! sound. Was that the door unlocking?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cottage (exits: NONE!)</span>
 The cottage is smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside,
 and is nearly empty, furnished only with a rickety wooden table.
 Somehow, there are no exits - not even the door you walked in through!
 Where did it go?

 "I am told you are the chosen one," says the woman's voice, cold but
 soft. "I am-- well, my name is not important."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "As the chosen one, you are naturally endowed with a certain amount of
 magical energy," the voice says. "Not as much as someone who has
 studied sorcery, but enough to cast Level 1 spells. To cast stronger
 ones, you will need some assistance."

 A wand magically appears on the table in front of you. "Take the
 wand," the voice says.

>take wand

 As you pick up the wand, you feel a pricking sensation against your
 thumb. You notice that the base of the wand is equipped with a small
 needle!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wait

 Time passes.

 "The wand is actually a hollow tube," the voice says. "To cast a Level
 2 or Level 3 spell, you will insert an ampule of a potion into the
 wand. Squeeze the wand, and the ampule will be crushed and the potion
 will flow through the needle into your bloodstream, charging you with
 its magical energy. The effect does not last long, and you must cast
 the spell while you are still energized!"

 A ampule of cloudy fluid appears on the table. "Let's try it," the
 voice says. "Take the ampule."

>take ampule

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wait

 Time passes.

 A slender spellbook appears on the table before you. "This spellbook
 will magically track what ampules you have in your possession and
 instruct you in the proper formation of your spells," the voice says.
 "I'll give you a few moments before we proceed. First, take the book
 and read it - it should only take a moment. Then put the ampule into
 the wand, and we can continue."

>take book

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>read it

 Letters magically swim before your eyes to form these words:

 SPELLES GRANTED BY POTIONNES IN THY INVENTTORIE
 A spelle to ryse off ye Growndde.

 SPELLES GRANTED BY POTIONNES IN THY BLODDE-STREYM

>put ampule in wand

 You load the ampule of cloudy fluid into the wand.

 "Now squeeze the wand," the voice says.

>squeeze wand

 You hear the muffled sound of glass breaking - wince at the sting of
 the needle entering your thumb - and then you feel magical energy
 coursing through your body!

 "Quick!" the voice says. "Cast the spell just like the book says:
 SXVEBI!"

>sxvebi

 You feel your stomach lurch and look down to find that you are
 suddenly floating several inches off the ground! You've cast a
 levitation spell! (A weak one, but still.)

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>wait

 Time passes.

 The magical energy leaves your body. As it does, you gently return to
 the ground.

 "All right," the voice says. "I have discharged my duty. You've
 received your training, and I've just placed some ampules in the
 mailbox outside that should help you in your quest. If you encounter
 other spells along the way, feel free to use them - but don't go more
 than two levels above your base skill level. Good luck." She clears
 her throat. "FORPELI!"

 For a terrifying moment you feel as though you are free-falling in
 every direction at once! Then all is still, and you find yourself...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Cottage (exits: N S)</span>
 In front of you, immediately to the north, lies a well-maintained
 white cottage. A path leads south.

 There is a small mailbox here.

>take all from mailbox

 large ampule of clear fluid: Removed.
 ampule of bubbly fluid: Removed.
 ampule of rainbow fluid: Removed.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N S)</span>
 You are on a path that leads north to the door of a small cottage and
 south toward a country road. Oddly, though the path itself is just a
 dirt track through a wide clearing in the forest, it is crisscrossed
 by irregularly placed strips of stone!

>go south

 As you proceed down the path you hear a grinding sound behind you, and
 you turn to find the stone strips criss-crossing the path rising up
 out of the ground to form a labyrinth of stone walls! Returning to the
 sorceress's house just got a lot more difficult...!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N SW)</span>
 You are on a path that leads southwest to a country road and north
 toward a stone labyrinth.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northern End of Village (exits: N NE S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads south to the village square and
 north into the forest. To the northeast you see a long path leading to
 a stone labyrinth.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern End of Village (exits: N E S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads north to the village square and
 south to a rickety bridge that spans a deep chasm; you can see the
 dragon's cave on the other side. The ground near the foot of the
 bridge is darkly stained. A cave smaller than the dragon's lair lies
 to the east.

 A troll lurks by the bridge, flipping through a book titled
 <span class="floydstyle em">English Usage</span>. When it sees you, it straightens up with a
 start and quickly flings the book into the chasm. "A new adventurer!"
 it shrieks. "Have you come to free us from the dragon? Then I, Lonk
 the Troll, would like to thank you for your courage and bravery!
 Please accept this obsequious smile as a token of gratitude." You have
 a sneaking suspicion this greeting is not heartfelt.

 A red pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the southern
 boundary of the village.

>put clear in wand

 You load the large ampule of clear fluid into the wand.

>take mackerel

 Taken.

 The troll shakes its head at you. "You are so dull, I almost pity
 you," it says. "Almost."

>squeeze wand

 You hear the muffled sound of glass breaking - wince at the sting of
 the needle entering your thumb - and then you feel magical energy
 coursing through your body!

 The troll shakes its head at you. "You are so dull, I almost pity
 you," it says. "Almost."

 A knight on horseback comes charging in from the north, blowing right
 by you and the troll. "Never fear, villagers!" he declares as he
 passes. "I'll rid your land of this fiendish monster!" You watch as he
 races across the bridge and into the dragon's cave.

>ovidio troll from mackerel

 You are not holding the troll!

>examine cloak

 Your cloak has a pocket! It is where you keep your money. Right now
 you have 48 gold. Your pocket also contains a leaflet.

 You hear a blood-curdling scream from the dragon's cave. It is not the
 scream of a dragon. The troll laughs uproariously.

>take troll

 Your hands are already too full to pick up something as cumbersome as
 the troll!

 The magical energy leaves your body.

>undo

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern End of Village (exits: N E S)</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>ovidio cloak from troll

 You are not holding the troll!

 The magical energy leaves your body.

 "Have you <span class="floydstyle i">still</span> not solved this puerile 'adventure'?" the troll
 asks. "You're not sharp enough to skewer a cube of tofu, are you?"

>give coin to troll

 The troll takes your coin and, giggling, stands aside. You proceed
 onto the bridge. "Enjoy your ostentatious suicide and the eternal
 damnation it implies!" the troll calls after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bridge (exits: N S)</span>
 You are crossing a rickety bridge that sways unnervingly with your
 every step. Far below you, and visible between the slats of the
 bridge, is the bottom of a deep chasm.

>take slat

 At least one of the things you mentioned doesn't seem to be here!

>go down

 Jump into the chasm? You would surely be splattered if you attempted
 this!

>jump

 This would mean certain death!

>jump

 You throw yourself into the chasm, and perish gruesomely upon impact.


     <span class="floydstyle i">*** You have died ***</span>

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom </span> (on the bed)
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is
 set into the wall across from the window.

 You rub your eyes, stretch, and get out of bed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 This is a small room whose walls are lined with overflowing bookcases.
 At the center of the room are two comfortable-looking chairs, each
 with a round table beside it; on each table is a lamp. The wall across
 from the entrance is dominated by a bay window, through which warm
 light streams.

 The first alter ego you met sits in one of the chairs, reading his

 in brown cloaks; to the south is a foyer and, beyond that, the front

 The lights are off in this room, but you can still see reasonably
 well, thanks to the glow of the boxy big-screen television. And what

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,

 "What hints can you give me about the tavern?"

 "Now that you're a dart expert, your next task is to get the darts out
 of the tavern," your double says. "You can't just stroll out with
 them, even if they're hidden in your pocket, because the bouncers will
 search you. You'll need to get out some other way."

 On the TV, Apollo's former coach plays chess against one of the
 official Soviet chaperones and checkmates him with a g7++. It's an
 easy win, as the Soviet's pawn structure is atrocious.

 "What other hints can you give me about the tavern?"

 "You're in a tavern," your alter ego says. "What other ways can you
 leave a tavern other than by your own power?"

 On the TV, Apollo's former coach, Duke, tells Rocky that when Apollo
 died, part of Duke died, but that now, Rocky is the one.

 "Are you saying I should pick a fight in the tavern?"

 "Not exactly, but I see where you're coming from," your double says.
 "The problem is that guys with our stats aren't going to win a bar
 fight. Hard to succeed in your quest after you've been beaten to a
 pulp."

 On the TV, Rocky goes for a jog, passing a babushka in a headscarf and
 a man driving a team of horses; meanwhile, Drago works out in an
 advanced facility full of blinking LEDs and green computer screens.

 "Are you saying I should drink until they have to carry me out?"

 "That is what I am saying," your double says. "But just drinking until
 you pass out isn't going to do the trick. They'll just let you sleep
 it off. You're going to have to find a way to call attention to your
 drunkenness in such a way that they just want to be rid of you and
 might not search you all that carefully..."

 On the TV, Drago trains on complex equipment, electrodes taped to his
 chest; Rocky trains by chopping wood and lifting rocks.

 "Thanks for the hint!"

 On the TV, Drago receives an injection of anabolic steroids. "Hearts

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the
 stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a
 hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east
 is a dark room lit by flickering, ghostly light, and the door outside
 is to the south.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You are in a hallway with a slightly uneven, creaky wooden floor.
 Archways to the north and west lead to large rooms full of adventurers
 in brown cloaks; to the south is a foyer and, beyond that, the front
 door.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Game Room</span>
 This is a large room - apparently a later addition to the original
 house, if the faux wood paneling and hideous mint-green shag carpeting
 are anything to go by. In the near corner stand a quartet of arcade
 cabinets, while at the other end of the room, near the entrance to the
 library, is a pool table; a couple of adventurers are playing a game
 of 9-ball. Empty and half-empty beer bottles are everywhere.

 A dartboard hangs on the wall opposite the main egress, which lies to
 the south. There is a single hole in it.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: WEAPON SHOP, LABYRINTH, ROC'S NEST, SHORELINE,
 KNIGHTS.

 The table once occupied by the gamers is no longer in use.


 You climb onto the table, and as your foot touches the square engraved
 upon it that represents the tavern, you feel the world turn
 inside-out...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Nameless Tavern (exits: NW)</span>
 You are standing in a large tavern with creaky wooden floors. Laughter

 candles atop wooden tables. The bartender nods at you as he tends to
 his customers.

     <span class="floydstyle i">*** You have died ***</span>




 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom </span> (on the bed)
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is
 set into the wall across from the window.

 You rub your eyes, stretch, and get out of bed.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
 You are standing in a nondescript hallway: plain white walls, a
 threadbare runner carpet. The door to your bedroom is at one end of
 the hallway, the first door on the right-hand side at the top of a
 flight of stairs that spirals downward to an unseen lower floor. There
 is no other end to the hallway; it stretches on forever to the north,
 with doors at regular intervals.


 You follow the curving staircase downward...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You are standing in a small area of parquet at the bottom of the
 stairs. The staircase back up to the second floor lies to the west; a
 hallway leads north, and this one looks mercifully finite. To the east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">TV Room</span>
 The lights are off in this room, but you can still see reasonably
 well, thanks to the glow of the boxy big-screen television. And what
 you see is a room full of clones of you, all in adventurers' cloaks,
 sitting on battered couches watching <span class="floydstyle em">Rocky IV</span> on Betamax. An
 archway leads north into the kitchen.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: COTTAGE, ROC'S NEST, TROLLS, JEWELRY SHOP,
 KNIGHTS. (Some of these alternate versions of you are chatting with
 each other and no one seems to mind.)

 On the TV, James Brown sinks to his knees. Danny Ray drapes a cape
 over him.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 It looks like this kitchen has been updated piecemeal. The sleek black
 refrigerator with in-door water and ice dispensers is clearly one of
 the latest models, while the beige and brown buttons on the wood-grain
 microwave speak of an earlier generation, and the loudly chugging teal
 dishwasher a generation before that. The oven is of indeterminate age,
 though the fact that the clock on it is analog rather than digital
 suggests a relatively early date. A screen door leads north to the
 backyard, while an archway to the south will return you to the TV
 room.

 One of your doubles tidies up the kitchen.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Backyard</span>
 This is a small backyard, marked off by a tall wooden fence. A small
 patio of volcanic rock tiles plays host to a grill, which a couple of
 your doubles are tending to, while out on the grass stands a small
 shed and a recycling bin. A gate leads east.

 and throws the occasional punch.

 This is a small room whose walls are lined with overflowing bookcases.
 At the center of the room are two comfortable-looking chairs, each

 from the entrance is dominated by a bay window, through which warm
 light streams.

 The first alter ego you met sits in one of the chairs, reading his
 newspaper.

 tantalizing comestibles. One table features hot wings and tandoori
 chicken; another offers assorted varieties of pizza; a third is split
 between pasta and enchiladas; there's also a snacking table with some
 Mediterranean spreads and pita chips, and a table of plates and
 napkins and things. And as no buffet would be complete without
 dessert, one table is devoted to different types of pie. All around,
 versions of you gorge themselves, either at fold-out tables or just
 standing up.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: TAVERN, WEAPON SHOP, DRAGON, SHORELINE.

 You can also see a plate here.

 "What hints can you give me about the tavern?"

 "I give up," the other you says. "Hide the darts in your pocket. Buy

 you can do idiotic things, stand on the table. The bouncers will be so

 ...zzzzzzz...

 You are woken by someone tugging on your sleeve! You squint and see
 that it is an old man.

 "It's you!" he gasps. "The chosen one!"


 Time passes.

 "I am-- well, my name is not important," the old man says. "But the
 prophecies have spoken of one who would free this poor land from the
 ravages of the dragon who lives to the south!" He pauses. "It will not
 be easy," he warns. "First you must prove your mettle. This quest will
 test your body, mind, and heart! For you must perform a feat of
 strength, outwit a fiendishly complex machine, and win the affections
 of a mysterious sorceress to defeat the dragon!"


 The old man grabs you by the wrist. "No, you must stay!" he insists.

 "I can say no more!" the old man cries. He runs off down the road and
 into the wilderness.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northern End of Village (exits: N NE S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads south to the village square and
 north into the forest. To the northeast you see a long path leading to
 a small cottage.

 A yellow pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the northern
 boundary of the village.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N SW)</span>
 You are on a path that leads southwest to a country road and north
 toward a small cottage.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N S)</span>
 You are on a path that leads north to the door of a small cottage and
 south toward a country road. Oddly, though the path itself is just a
 dirt track through a wide clearing in the forest, it is crisscrossed
 by irregularly placed strips of stone!



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Cottage (exits: N S)</span>
 In front of you, immediately to the north, lies a well-maintained
 white cottage. A black cat blinks curiously at you from a window sill;
 as you approach, it hops down and skitters away. A path leads south.

 There is a small mailbox here.

 (on the door)
 A woman's voice calls out, "MALSXLOSI." Then you hear a resounding
 CHUNK!! sound. Was that the door unlocking?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cottage (exits: NONE!)</span>
 The cottage is smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside,
 and is nearly empty, furnished only with a rickety wooden table.
 Somehow, there are no exits - not even the door you walked in through!
 Where did it go?

 "I am told you are the chosen one," says the woman's voice, cold but
 soft. "I am-- well, my name is not important."


 Time passes.

 "As the chosen one, you are naturally endowed with a certain amount of
 magical energy," the voice says. "Not as much as someone who has
 studied sorcery, but enough to cast Level 1 spells. To cast stronger
 ones, you will need some assistance."

 A wand magically appears on the table in front of you. "Take the
 wand," the voice says.


 As you pick up the wand, you feel a pricking sensation against your
 thumb. You notice that the base of the wand is equipped with a small
 needle!

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]


 At least one of the things you mentioned doesn't seem to be here!


 Time passes.

 "The wand is actually a hollow tube," the voice says. "To cast a Level
 2 or Level 3 spell, you will insert an ampule of a potion into the
 wand. Squeeze the wand, and the ampule will be crushed and the potion
 will flow through the needle into your bloodstream, charging you with
 its magical energy. The effect does not last long, and you must cast
 the spell while you are still energized!"

 A ampule of cloudy fluid appears on the table. "Let's try it," the
 voice says. "Take the ampule."


 At least one of the things you mentioned doesn't seem to be here!


 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]


 Time passes.

 A slender spellbook appears on the table before you. "This spellbook
 will magically track what ampules you have in your possession and
 instruct you in the proper formation of your spells," the voice says.
 "I'll give you a few moments before we proceed. First, take the book
 and read it - it should only take a moment. Then put the ampule into
 the wand, and we can continue."


 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]


 Letters magically swim before your eyes to form these words:

 SPELLES GRANTED BY POTIONNES IN THY INVENTTORIE
 A spelle to ryse off ye Growndde.

 SPELLES GRANTED BY POTIONNES IN THY BLODDE-STREYM


 You load the ampule of cloudy fluid into the wand.

 "Now squeeze the wand," the voice says.


 You hear the muffled sound of glass breaking - wince at the sting of
 the needle entering your thumb - and then you feel magical energy
 coursing through your body!

 "Quick!" the voice says. "Cast the spell just like the book says:
 SXVEBI!"


 You feel your stomach lurch and look down to find that you are
 suddenly floating several inches off the ground! You've cast a
 levitation spell! (A weak one, but still.)

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]


 Time passes.

 The magical energy leaves your body. As it does, you gently return to
 the ground.

 "All right," the voice says. "I have discharged my duty. You've
 received your training, and I've just placed some ampules in the
 mailbox outside that should help you in your quest. If you encounter
 other spells along the way, feel free to use them - but don't go more
 than two levels above your base skill level. Good luck." She clears
 her throat. "FORPELI!"

 For a terrifying moment you feel as though you are free-falling in
 every direction at once! Then all is still, and you find yourself...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Cottage (exits: N S)</span>
 In front of you, immediately to the north, lies a well-maintained
 white cottage. A path leads south.

 There is a small mailbox here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N S)</span>
 You are on a path that leads north to the door of a small cottage and
 south toward a country road. Oddly, though the path itself is just a
 dirt track through a wide clearing in the forest, it is crisscrossed
 by irregularly placed strips of stone!


 As you proceed down the path you hear a grinding sound behind you, and
 you turn to find the stone strips criss-crossing the path rising up
 out of the ground to form a labyrinth of stone walls! Returning to the
 sorceress's house just got a lot more difficult...!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path (exits: N SW)</span>
 You are on a path that leads southwest to a country road and north
 toward a stone labyrinth.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northern End of Village (exits: N NE S)</span>
 You are on a quiet road that leads south to the village square and
 north into the forest. To the northeast you see a long path leading to
 a stone labyrinth.

 A yellow pennant flies from a tall metal pole, marking the northern
 boundary of the village.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Village Square (exits: N W E S SE)</span>
 You are at the crossroads of a tiny village like many others you have
 seen since you have been adventuring. The main street runs east and
 west, while a smaller one runs north and south.

 This is the western end of a small, nameless village. The main road
 runs west toward the shoreline and east into the center of town. The
 only buildings of interest are a pair of shops: a plain-looking weapon
 shop to the south and a slightly fancier-looking fishing shop to the
 north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Weapon Shop (exits: N S)</span>
 This is a small, dusty weapon shop. The wall behind the counter is
 lined with swords and shields of all sizes and descriptions, along
 with related items such as belts with scabbards. An enormous,
 bowl-shaped shield and a fine broadsword are on prominent display next
 to a dartboard. A sign says, "Win this sword and shield by hitting a
 bullseye! One gold to try your luck!"

 On the counter you see a purple dart.

 Gyahhh! What is this thing MADE of? It must have an adamant core or
 something. It takes all your strength just to lift it! (But you do.)

 The shop owner rolls his eyes. "Do I look stupid?" he asks. "Did you
 really think I wouldn't notice you were holding some red dart from the
 devil knows where? Give me that thing." He snatches the dart from your
 hand. "Now get the hell out of my store!" He gives you little choice.

 You throw your special dart... BULLSEYE! The shop owner does a double
 take, then a triple take. "How...? But that's...!"

 "Just lucky, I guess," you say.

 "Yeah," the shop owner replies. "Lucky." He reluctantly takes the
 sword and shield off the wall and shoves them at you. "Get out of my
 store," he says coldly. You see no reason not to comply.

 The sign out front said this was a jewelry shop, but inside you find
 no display cases of jewelry or anything else to suggest that this is a
 store of any kind. Instead, you find a man wearing a cloak with
 glowing stripes, sitting at a desk and applying the strangest torch
 you've ever seen - a piece of metal that gives off a curiously narrow
 blue flame - to a rough, round rock. He looks up sharply as you enter.

 "Grf," he says. "It's you. Uh... forget you saw this." He quickly
 gathers up his things, waves his scepter, and walks off through the
 wall. Vivid white light flares briefly around him.

 As if that weren't enough, the rock then reappears on the desk a

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom </span> (on the bed)
 You are in a spare, wallpapered bedroom. It has the basic furnishings,
 but little more: a queen bed, bedside table with lamp, dresser with
 mirror, and, in a nice touch, an overhead ceiling fan. On one side of
 the bed is a wall safe. On the other side is a large window; the
 frilly blue curtains are open. Along the adjacent wall, next to the
 dresser, is a half-open door leading to the bathroom; another door is
 set into the wall across from the window.

 You rub your eyes, stretch, and get out of bed.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 Even more than the bedroom, this cramped bathroom shows this house's
 age. Not that it isn't well kept up - it looks like it's been recently
 cleaned - but the clunky styling of the fixtures suggests that it
 hasn't been renovated for a couple of generations. The wallpaper is
 peeling a bit around the window set into the exterior wall; the ocean
 view from that window is reflected in the mirrored medicine cabinet on
 the tiled partition wall opposite it. Beneath the medicine cabinet is
 a sink. The far wall is also done in small white tile, chipped here
 and there. Near that wall, but not attached to it, is a bathtub;
 however, the towel rack is across the room, above the toilet. Next to
 the toilet is the doorway, which leads back to the bedroom.

 is no other end to the hallway; it stretches on forever to the north,

 sitting on battered couches watching <span class="floydstyle em">Rocky IV</span> on Betamax. An
 archway leads north into the kitchen.

 You scan the nametags of your doubles. Not everyone is wearing one,
 but you do read these: WEAPON SHOP, LABYRINTH, MAGIC, KNIGHTS. (Some
 of these alternate versions of you are chatting with each other and no
 one seems to mind.)

 On the TV, Apollo's former coach, Duke, tells Rocky that when Apollo
 died, part of Duke died, but that now, Rocky is the one.

 speaking to the labyrinth expert

 "What hints can you give me about the labyrinth?"

 "Your ability to land your attacks, and to fend off the minotaur's
 attacks - either by dodging, or blocking them with your shield -
 depends not just on your dexterity but that of your opponent," your
 double explains. "You can try a <span class="floydstyle i">MALLERTA</span> spell when the
 minotaur is in range: it'll make the minotaur clumsier, giving you a
 better chance both on offense and defense!"

 On the TV, Rocky goes for a jog, passing a babushka in a headscarf and
 a man driving a team of horses; meanwhile, Drago works out in an
 advanced facility full of blinking LEDs and green computer screens.
