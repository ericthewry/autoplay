>load fear








 You are running for your life down dark, labyrinthine corridors, your
 heart pounding almost as loudly as the heavy boots of your relentless
 pursuer. But your legs are collapsing under you, your breaths coming in
 ragged gasps. At the last, strength fails you and you collapse
 face-down upon the unforgiving concrete. Cold hands grasp your neck,
 hauling you upright, forcing your unwilling eyes open to gaze into the
 hard, cruel, familiar face of your captor - and you scream with the
 horrible recognition that those twisted features are your own.

 You are still screaming when you awaken in sweat-drenched clothes,
 deeply relieved that it was only a dream. Yet something is not right.
 Why does the darkness beyond the window look so threatening? Why do the
 sounds of the night bear such menace? Indeed, why are you in such
 constant...

 FEAR
 An Interactive Nightmare
 For information, type "about"
 Release 1 / Serial number 961012 / Inform v1502 Library 5/12
 Standard interpreter 1.0

 Bedroom (on the bed)
 This first-floor room is almost uncomfortably warm and well-lit. The
 bed sits against the east wall, and curtains cover the windows to the
 south. A calendar hangs from a hook on one wall, and the exit is to the
 north.

 On the bedside table are a pillbox (which is closed) (in which are nine
 white pills), a small leaflet and a telephone.

>examine leaflet
 A folded piece of paper printed in annoyingly small lettering.
 It reads:

   Cyclazone (R) - Antidepressant

   Dosage - one pill every twenty-four hours or until symptoms clear.
 Effects slowly increase over the first twelve hours. UNDER NO
 CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD RECOMMENDED DOSAGE EVER BE EXCEEDED.

   Possible rare side effects - mild disorientation, temporary amnesia,
 partial loss of coordination. Do not drive motor vehicles while under
 treatment.

   Mode of action - (from here on, the leaflet consists largely of
 arcane biochemical terminology which you find incomprehensible.)

 Amnesia, eh? You wonder just what possessed you to take part in the
 first trial of an experimental drug. To your horror, you can't recall.

 You feel suddenly claustrophobic as you hear a rustling nearby. What
 lurks in the shadows, waiting to pounce?

>examine hook
 The calendar is turned to the page for the month of March. It bears a
 photograph of a snow-covered mountain range. Down the right-hand side
 are little entries for each day:

   Sat 1 Mar:
   Sun 2 Mar:
   Mon 3 Mar: Call drug research people 6pm
   Tue 4 Mar: first dose 6:30pm

 These entries are crossed through, and the rest of the calendar is
 blank.

 The house is strangely unfamiliar, as if you'd read about it in a book
 but never actually set foot inside before.

>time
>inventory
 There is no dial tone. Returning the handset to its cradle, you feel
 even more helpless and alone.

 As you try to compose your mind, dark memories wash over you:
 explosions, death, the tolling of funeral bells, gloom, isolation.

 What do you want to tie?

 You are carrying nothing.

>think about rainy soul miasma
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>get pill
 The pillbox is not open.

>open pillbox. take pill. eat it
 You open the pillbox.

 Taken.

 The pill dissolves quickly on your tongue, and within moments a feeling
 of disorientation and vertigo overcomes you. Then the walls of the
 house seem to press in around you, suffocating and crushing - and then
 you are stumbling, running in blind panic for the stairs, pursued by
 horrors of every description, maniacal laughter and agonized screams
 ringing in your ears, and somehow one of the steps lurches upwards,
 sending you hurtling down headfirst into the monsters waiting at the
 foot of the stairs...

 You were found with a broken neck.


     *** You have died ***

 Bedroom

 On the bedside table are a telephone, a pillbox (which is closed) (in
 which are nine white pills) and a small leaflet.

>examine windows
 The windows shield you from the terror and cold of the outside world.
 On the other side of the glass, steel grilles fixed to the wall prevent
 intruders breaking in this way.

>go north

 Upstairs Corridor (by ladder)
 A ladder hangs down from a dark square hole in the high ceiling of this
 unadorned corridor. Identical doors to the north, east and south lead
 to various rooms. To the west, hanging over the stairs, a bright
 electric lamp provides illumination.

 Seeing the ladder suddenly reminds you where you left the house keys.
 They fell out of your pocket in the attic yesterday afternoon.

 You catch a flurry of movement out of the corner of your eye, but when
 you turn there is nothing.

>go up
 The light switch is a long way from the entrance, and from the strange
 noises you hear occasionally, there could be anything up there. You
 can't muster the courage to brave the dark.

>examine ladder
 The old and rickety-looking wooden ladder is fixed to something at the
 top end, though you can't see what very clearly from down here. The
 hole leads to the attic.

>go north

 Guest Room
 A small, windowless and rather cramped bedroom. Perhaps that explains
 why overnight visitors are so infrequent.

 You can see an ornamental plate and a dusty leather-bound book here.

>examine plate
 A small, rather attractive copper plate inlaid with intricate silver
 patterns.

>examine book
 The title of the book is "The Pyramids of Egypt". Written by a 19th
 century archaeologist whose name you can't pronounce, it describes
 several of the monuments in excruciating detail, almost down to the
 precise measurements of each brick. Idly flipping through the dull
 volume, your eyes are drawn to a few paragraphs speculating on the
 existence of yet undiscovered pyramids hidden beneath the shifting
 desert sands. You set the book aside.

 Suddenly, you recall that holiday you took in Egypt several years ago,
 and the memories - slowly at first, but then faster and faster - flash
 back to you, images of clear skies, desolate sands, ancient ruins,
 clearer and closer as time itself seems to dissolve, statues almost
 tangibly solid, spiralling ever inward until memory and consciousness
 converge...

 By Pyramid Entrance
 You'd left the tour bus behind for the afternoon to investigate this
 recently discovered monument, the tomb of an obscure twelfth dynasty
 ruler. It made headlines when it was discovered following the violent
 desert storms of last summer, and the sand still lingers around its
 base. Hardly any tourists have heard of this place, and not having to
 put up with the endless babbling is part of the attraction for you. The
 hot sun reflects blindingly off the polished white limestone of the
 casing.

 The view from this slightly wobbly wooden platform halfway up the
 pyramid would doubtless be magnificent, were there anything to look at
 other than desert. To the west are rickety stairs leading back to the
 ground, and to the east a dim passage descends into the man-made
 mountain.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   an electric torch (providing light)

>go east

 Sloping Passage
 This narrow, low-ceilinged passage with smooth granite walls slopes
 downwards and eastwards into the heart of the vast edifice. It is cool
 inside, a welcome relief from the baking desert sun.

>go east

 Sloping Gallery
 The narrow passage from the west opens out into a wide sloping gallery
 that descends eastwards into what appears to be a burial chamber. Tall
 pillars set against the walls hold up the high ceiling. The walls are
 inscribed with scenes from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

 Only your footfalls break the silence, echoing ever fainter into the
 darkness.

>examine scenes
 The inscriptions show deities with the heads of birds and jackals
 presiding over the judgment of the deceased on one wall, and serene
 images of the pharoah's abode in the afterlife on the other. Underneath
 the pictures are indecipherable hieroglyphics which you guess to be
 ancient prayers.

 Nothing practical results from your prayer.

 The square pillars are more functional than decorative; their smooth
 surfaces are plain and unadorned.

 Burial Chamber
 What a disappointment. This chamber must have once been filled with
 treasures beyond imagination, before the museums plundered its wealth.
 Dark patches of stone on the floor are the only indication of where
 valuable artifacts once stood, while the walls stand bare and forlorn.
 The massive sarcophagus remains in the centre of the room, but only,
 you suspect, because of its sheer weight.

 The sarcophagus lid bears a menacing engraving of the spirit of the
 deceased Pharoah calling down maledictions upon all who would defile
 his tomb.

>examine engraving
 Upon closer examination, you realise this huge box could never have fit
 through the entrance passage; it appears to have been carved out of one
 immense, smooth-polished chunk of marble. The lid is as thick as your
 hand is wide, and is positioned an inch or so off centre.

 The image of the dead ruler's face, the only adornment on this box,
 somehow fills you with dread.

>examine face
 You can't see any such thing.

>open box
 Despite your best efforts, the lid refuses to budge. Besides, even if
 you were to somehow get it open, everything of interest is surely in a
 museum by now.

>push lid
 Despite your best efforts, the lid refuses to budge. Besides, even if
 you were to somehow get it open, everything of interest is surely in a

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>go west
 As you turn to leave, you feel strangely compelled to glance back at
 the defiled sarcophagus one more time. A tiny flicker in the shadows.
 Did the Pharoah's lips move in a curse? At that moment, your torch
 somehow slips from your panicking hands, and you dive for it in the
 wildly flickering light. As if guided by an unseen hand, it rolls into
 a small gap at the foot of the north wall that you somehow hadn't
 noticed earlier, plunging you into complete darkness. Two heartbeats
 later, you hear what must surely be your torch shattering on a hard
 surface, followed shortly by the awful grinding noise of stone against
 stone in the distance, echoing through the empty chamber...

 Darkness
 You are groping around blindly in the dark. The walls and floor are
 smooth, cold stone. The imposing sarcophagus, thankfully, is still
 closed.

>enter sarcophagus
 That's not something you can enter.

>feel floor
 There doesn't seem to be anything remarkable about that.

>examine gap
 The rectangular hole is about two feet wide and just tall enough for
 you, with some trepidation, to stick your arm into. It leads to a
 seemingly vertical, square, smooth-walled shaft. On its back wall is a
 curiously protruding stone.

>feel wall
 Which do you mean, the north wall, the south wall, the east wall, the
 west wall, the northeast wall, the southeast wall, the northwest wall
 or the southwest wall?

>examine stone
 It feels surprisingly rough compared to the smooth walls of the shaft
 from which it sticks out an inch or so.

>go down
 You can't go that way.

>push stone
 Bracing your feet against the sarcophagus, you push against the stone
 with all your strength, and as it slides inwards you feel air move
 against your face and hear grinding from the wall just in front of you.

>out

 Darkness
 Your footsteps echo eerily back to you in the chilly air of the
 lightless gallery.

>examine stone
 Your spirits sink. The slab feels solid and is impervious to your
 efforts. Upon its surface are engraved the images of bird-headed
 Egyptian deities, their sharp vulture-beaks open as if to devour
 desecrators.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>look

 Darkness
 Your footsteps echo eerily back to you in the chilly air of the
 lightless gallery.

>out
 You get about six feet into the entrance passage before running,
 literally, into a stone slab that seals you inside the tomb.

>examine beaks
 You don't feel any such thing.

>images
>examine slab

 Your spirits sink. The slab feels solid and is impervious to your

 Darkness

>examine box
 Still massive, immovable and unopenable. Running your fingers over the
 engraved pharoah, you could almost swear that his features have
 contorted ever so slightly into a leer.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>take torch
 You don't feel any such thing.

>examine hole
 The hole is now two foot square, wide enough for you to squeeze
 through. It leads to a seemingly vertical, square, smooth-walled shaft.
 On its back wall is a curiously protruding stone.

>kiss box
 You can only do that to something animate.

>enter hole
 You carefully lower yourself, feet first, into the cramped shaft.

 Darkness (in a shaft)
 You are braced against the cold stone walls of a narrow, claustrophobic
 square shaft, trying unsuccessfully to avoid thinking about burial in a
 tall coffin. You could climb down with some care, or crawl back up into
 the sarcophagus room.

>go down

 Darkness (at the bottom of a shaft)
 You are at the bottom of the narrow shaft. On the floor is a heap of
 debris that cracks and crumbles under your feet. The air here has an
 unpleasant smell of decay.

>examine debris
 This must have been some ancient mechanism of wood and rope, rotted
 away over the centuries and now completely unrecognisable. The useless,
 broken remains of your torch are scattered in this heap; you nearly cut
 yourself on a fragment of glass from the bulb. The remnants of several
 ancient ropes seem to lead underneath the south wall.

>search debris

 ancient ropes seem to lead underneath the south wall.

>examine ropes
 The ropes have a grisly and decayed texture. Whatever their function
 was, they have performed it for the last time.

>get ropes
 The ropes disintegrate in your hands.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>examine south wall
 This wall has a different texture from the rest, and seems to have
 several cracks in it.

>take torch
 As the bulb is broken, it's no use to you now.

>stick finger in crack

 The wall collapses outwards with a loud crash, the noise of its fall
 resounding from what must be a cavernous chamber.

>examine statue
 A statue, slightly taller than you, of a bird-headed god with open eyes
 and a closed beak. In one hand it holds a crook, and in the other an
 eight-pointed star.

>take crook
>examine star
 It seems to be fixed to the statue firmly. You can neither move nor
 remove it.

 The eight-pointed star rests on the statue's outstretched palm, a tiny
 eye engraved on each point. You can turn it slightly, but it always
 seems to spring back to the same orientation.

 You fervently hope that no poisonous creatures inhabit this place.

 A short crooked staff of stone, about the length of your arm.

>go up
 You emerge from the darkness to an astonishing sight. Light pours onto
 the sarcophagus from the west, bathing the pharoah's austere face in an
 aura of blinding majesty. Perhaps it could be a trick of the shadows on
 your still-adjusting eyes, but you thought for a moment you saw those
 dead lips curve in the faintest shadow of a smile, bidding you a silent
 farewell. And this time, you do not look back as you run joyously
 outward and away from the grave, through the halls miraculously
 suffused with the light and warmth of the setting sun at the end of the
 corridor, as reality seems to blur and the winds of time sweep you,
 feather-light, forever up and closer to the sun...

 Reluctantly, you open your eyes to find that the sun is in fact the
 bare electric bulb of your living room, but something remains within
 you as a legacy of the trip...

 [You are no longer afraid of the dark.]

 Living Room
 This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa
 and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table.
 Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the
 warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the
 mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the
 stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling.

 A simple wooden staircase on the west wall leads up to the first floor;
 underneath the stairs is an utility closet. The kitchen can be seen
 through the empty doorway to the east.

 You shudder at the sight of a large spider hanging in the kitchen
 doorway.

 The front door is reassuringly and securely locked.

>fullscore

      9 rising from the tomb

     10 total (out of 36)

 You are carrying nothing.

 You feel suddenly claustrophobic as you hear a rustling nearby. What
 lurks in the shadows, waiting to pounce?

>examine spider
 A repulsive black thing with long, hairy legs, it hangs from an
 invisible length of thread like some twisted parody of the light bulb
 that casts its shadow on the kitchen wall. Its eight eyes stare
 malevolently back at you.

 The house is strangely unfamiliar, as if you'd read about it in a book
 but never actually set foot inside before.

>eat spider
 (first taking the spider)
 You'd like to stay as far away as possible from it, and you can't bear
 the thought of actually touching the vile (and probably poisonous)
 creature.

 explosions, death, the tolling of funeral bells, gloom, isolation.

 Study
 A large bookcase occupies the north wall of this brightly lit room.
 Next to the dull green curtains of the window stands a wooden desk.

 You can see a heap of worthless paper, a college photograph, a broken
 drawer (which is closed) and a wooden desk here.

>examine paper
 Musty newspapers, old bills, rough scribblings.

>examine photograph
 It's an old photograph which was sent to you a few years ago by one of
 your friends studying in Cambridge, depicting a porcelain duck balanced
 high among the rafters of the college dining hall. Suddenly, you
 recollect a conversation you had with him a long time ago, about the
 old college tradition of taking the duck down from the rafters of the
 Great Hall in the dead of night and putting it back up on another beam
 the next day. As you wonder whether you'd have tried this feat yourself
 if you'd been there, you feel your surroundings somehow shifting...

 Great Hall (by screens)
 You are at the south end of a magnificent dining hall. The east and
 west walls stand thirty feet tall; near the top, stained-glass windows
 bearing coats of arms admit the light of the full moon. Below the
 windows hang pictures of past Masters of the college and illustrious
 former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches.
 Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof.

 To the south, wooden screens half the height of the walls separate the
 hall from an east-west passageway. Double doors set in the screens are
 locked and bolted shut.

 In the rafters at the far end of the hall, a duck perches incongruously
 on a beam.

>duck
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine pictures
 Portraits of brilliant scholars of the past whose names are better
 known than their faces.

>ask duck about fear
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine rafters
 You'd guess that the lowest beams, upon one of which the duck rests,
 are 30 feet high. They run east-west across the breadth of the hall.

>go up
 Easier said than done.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a canvas satchel (which is closed)

>open satchel
 You open the canvas satchel, revealing a length of sewing thread, a
 squash ball, a catapult and a net.

>huh
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine catapult
 A hand-held hunting catapult, it accepts projectiles up to the size of
 a plum.

>tie thread to ball
 You tie the length of sewing thread to the squash ball.

>put net under duck
 Putting things under that wouldn't accomplish anything.

>tie thread to net
 You tie the length of sewing thread to the net.

>throw ball at duck
 (first taking the squash ball)
 You throw the ball, but it doesn't quite get high enough. It hits the
 floor with a worryingly loud thwack.

>shoot duck
 You need something to shoot projectiles with.

>throw ball over rafters
 I only understood you as far as wanting to throw the squash ball.

>get ball
 Taken.

>shoot duck with catapult
 I only understood you as far as wanting to shoot the duck.

>shoot catapult at duck
 To fire, try "shoot projectile at target".

>shoot ball at duck
 You need to be holding the catapult to shoot things.

>get catapult
 Taken.

>shoot ball at duck
 Taking careful aim, you let fly with the squash ball, which hits the
 duck squarely on the head with a sharp crack. Unfortunately, as it
 falls you notice that you've decapitated it, and you won't be able to
 catch both head and body in time. This is all going to be rather
 embarrassing...

 You open your eyes in front of the fireplace, feeling rather dizzy all
 of a sudden. Surely things aren't supposed to happen this way.

 Living Room
 This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa
 and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table.

 In the rafters at the north end of the hall, a duck perches

 A double length of rope runs up the east wall to the skylight,
 presumably for opening and closing it. Its bottom ends are tied to the

 At the foot of the north wall, a wide area is raised several inches on
 a wooden platform, where the High Table stands. Hanging on the wall is
 a large portrait of the College's founder.

 Above you, just to the south of the high table, a duck perches
 incongruously on a beam.

>examine portrait
 The massive gold-framed portrait, as large as the double doors at the
 far end of the hall, depicts a regal-looking figure holding a book and
 a sceptre. He probably looks much better during the day.

>climb table
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>stand on table
 You climb up onto the table for a while, but the duck is still far too
 high to reach. The table creaks under your weight, and you deem it
 prudent to get off.

>examine platform
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>tie rope to double doors
 You can't see any such thing.

>tie rope to door
 You can't see any such thing.

>tie rope to table
 You tie the length of rope to the table.

>fire ball at rafters
 Taking aim, you let fly with the squash ball, but feel the catapult's
 elastic brush against your hair. You watch the ball strike the beam
 just below the duck, which doesn't appear to have moved at all. The
 ball falls to the floor with an unnervingly loud thwack which you hope
 no one heard.

 [You'll be more careful with it next time.]

>again
 The ball flies gracefully over the beam, trailing the sewing thread
 behind it, and strikes the floor with a loud report. The impact
 detaches the ball from the thread, and it rolls off to become lost
 somewhere underneath the tables. However, the thread is now looped over
 the beam.

>pull thread
 You pull the length of string up and over the beam.

>pull string
 You pull the length of rope up and over the beam.

>climb rope
 You need to have your hands free to climb a rope.

>drop all
 canvas satchel: Dropped.
 catapult: Dropped.

>get satchel
 Taken.

>wear satchel
 You put on the canvas satchel.

>climb rope
 You give the rope a few experimental tugs, and it seems to support your
 weight. You've always been scared of heights, but it would be such a
 waste to turn back now. Gingerly, you ascend the rope.

 Great Hall (in the rafters)
 You are clinging to one of the lower beams of the rafters, trying not
 to look down. The beam's surface is covered with years of dust. Your
 rope is the only way back down.

 The infamous duck perches here.

>get duck
 Taken.

>put duck in satchel
 You put the porcelain duck into the canvas satchel.

>go down

 Great Hall (by high table)
 You are at the north end of a magnificent dining hall. The east and
 west walls stand thirty feet tall; near the top, stained-glass windows
 bearing coats of arms admit the light of the full moon. Below the
 windows hang pictures of past Masters of the college and illustrious
 former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches.
 Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof.

 At the foot of the north wall, a wide area is raised several inches on
 a wooden platform, where the High Table stands. Hanging on the wall is
 a large portrait of the College's founder.

 The rope is looped over the duck's wooden beam up in the rafters.

 You can see a catapult, a length of string and a length of sewing
 thread here.

>go south

 Great Hall
 You are in the middle of a magnificent dining hall. The east and west

 Directly above you is a hexagonal skylight set in the middle of the
 high ceiling.

 former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches.
 Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof.

 Directly above you is a hexagonal skylight set in the middle of the

>go south

 Great Hall (by screens)
 You are at the south end of a magnificent dining hall. The east and
 west walls stand thirty feet tall; near the top, stained-glass windows
 bearing coats of arms admit the light of the full moon. Below the
 windows hang pictures of past Masters of the college and illustrious
 former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches.
 Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof.

 To the south, wooden screens half the height of the walls separate the
 hall from an east-west passageway. Double doors set in the screens are
 locked and bolted shut.

>climb screen
 Your quest successful, you clamber over the screens and stealthily
 away, smiling as you think of the admiration you'll receive from your
 fellow students for this feat of daring.

 It is a terrible shock when the duck writhes in your hands, flattening
 into a mere photograph, but at least one thing from this dream has
 remained with you...

 [You are no longer afraid of heights.]

 Living Room
 This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa
 and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table.
 Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the
 warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the
 mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the
 stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling.

 A simple wooden staircase on the west wall leads up to the first floor;
 underneath the stairs is an utility closet. The kitchen can be seen
 through the empty doorway to the east.

 You shudder at the sight of a large spider hanging in the kitchen
 doorway.

 The front door is reassuringly and securely locked.

 You can also see a can of white paint here.

 [Your score has just gone up by nine points.]

>go up

 Upstairs Corridor
 You are in the western half of a plain whitewashed east-west corridor
 lit by a lamp hanging next to the stairs, which lead down to the ground
 floor. The carpeted wooden floor creaks annoyingly under your feet.

 The bathroom lies to the north; a ladder hangs from an opening in the
 ceiling to the east.

>go east

 Upstairs Corridor (by ladder)
 A ladder hangs down from a dark square hole in the high ceiling of this
 unadorned corridor. Identical doors to the north, east and south lead
 to various rooms. To the west, hanging over the stairs, a bright
 electric lamp provides illumination.

>go up
 The ladder groans, but supports your weight easily.

 Fumbling in the dark a bit, you discover the light switch and flip it,
 illuminating the attic.

 Attic
 Dust covers the floorboards of this dim attic, lit by a weak ceiling
 lamp, and the air makes you sneeze. Some old chairs are piled
 unceremoniously in one corner. There is no sign of the missing keys.

 Near where the sloping ceiling meets the floor by the north wall is a
 hissing, growling contraption of pipes and tanks that emits an
 occasional puff of hot steam, like some modern-day dragon crouched over
 its treasure.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>fullscore
 You have so far scored 21 out of a possible 36, in 339 turns, which
 gives you the rank of psychic Voyager.

 The score is made up as follows:

 Mustering all your courage, you throw the ornamental plate at the

 Kitchen
 This room retains a faint smell of paint. Cupboards containing kitchen

 Inverted in the sink is a glass bowl, reflecting the ceiling lamp in
 your eye.

 You are running for your life down dark, labyrinthine corridors, your
 heart pounding almost as loudly as the heavy boots of your relentless
 pursuer. But your legs are collapsing under you, your breaths coming in
 ragged gasps. At the last, strength fails you and you collapse
 face-down upon the unforgiving concrete. Cold hands grasp your neck,
 hauling you upright, forcing your unwilling eyes open to gaze into the
 hard, cruel, familiar face of your captor - and you scream with the
 horrible recognition that those twisted features are your own.

 You are still screaming when you awaken in sweat-drenched clothes,
 deeply relieved that it was only a dream. Yet something is not right.
 Why does the darkness beyond the window look so threatening? Why do the
 sounds of the night bear such menace? Indeed, why are you in such
 constant...

 This first-floor room is almost uncomfortably warm and well-lit. The

 On the bedside table are a pillbox (which is closed) (in which are nine
 white pills), a small leaflet and a telephone.

 You catch a flurry of movement out of the corner of your eye, but when
 you turn there is nothing.

>examine book
>read book
 The title of the book is "The Pyramids of Egypt". Written by a 19th
 century archaeologist whose name you can't pronounce, it describes
 several of the monuments in excruciating detail, almost down to the
 precise measurements of each brick. Idly flipping through the dull
 volume, your eyes are drawn to a few paragraphs speculating on the
 existence of yet undiscovered pyramids hidden beneath the shifting
 desert sands. You set the book aside.

 Suddenly, you recall that holiday you took in Egypt several years ago,
 and the memories - slowly at first, but then faster and faster - flash
 back to you, images of clear skies, desolate sands, ancient ruins,
 clearer and closer as time itself seems to dissolve, statues almost
 tangibly solid, spiralling ever inward until memory and consciousness
 converge...

 By Pyramid Entrance
 You'd left the tour bus behind for the afternoon to investigate this
 recently discovered monument, the tomb of an obscure twelfth dynasty
 ruler. It made headlines when it was discovered following the violent
 desert storms of last summer, and the sand still lingers around its
 base. Hardly any tourists have heard of this place, and not having to
 put up with the endless babbling is part of the attraction for you. The
 hot sun reflects blindingly off the polished white limestone of the
 casing.

 The view from this slightly wobbly wooden platform halfway up the
 pyramid would doubtless be magnificent, were there anything to look at
 other than desert. To the west are rickety stairs leading back to the
 ground, and to the east a dim passage descends into the man-made
 mountain.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>go east

 Sloping Passage
 This narrow, low-ceilinged passage with smooth granite walls slopes
 downwards and eastwards into the heart of the vast edifice. It is cool
 inside, a welcome relief from the baking desert sun.

>go east

 Sloping Gallery
 The narrow passage from the west opens out into a wide sloping gallery
 that descends eastwards into what appears to be a burial chamber. Tall
 pillars set against the walls hold up the high ceiling. The walls are
 inscribed with scenes from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

 Only your footfalls break the silence, echoing ever fainter into the
 darkness.

>go east

 Burial Chamber
 What a disappointment. This chamber must have once been filled with
 treasures beyond imagination, before the museums plundered its wealth.
 Dark patches of stone on the floor are the only indication of where
 valuable artifacts once stood, while the walls stand bare and forlorn.
 The massive sarcophagus remains in the centre of the room, but only,
 you suspect, because of its sheer weight.

 The sarcophagus lid bears a menacing engraving of the spirit of the
 deceased Pharoah calling down maledictions upon all who would defile
 his tomb.

>go west
 As you turn to leave, you feel strangely compelled to glance back at
 the defiled sarcophagus one more time. A tiny flicker in the shadows.
 Did the Pharoah's lips move in a curse? At that moment, your torch
 somehow slips from your panicking hands, and you dive for it in the
 wildly flickering light. As if guided by an unseen hand, it rolls into
 a small gap at the foot of the north wall that you somehow hadn't
 noticed earlier, plunging you into complete darkness. Two heartbeats
 later, you hear what must surely be your torch shattering on a hard
 surface, followed shortly by the awful grinding noise of stone against
 stone in the distance, echoing through the empty chamber...

 Darkness
 You are groping around blindly in the dark. The walls and floor are
 smooth, cold stone. The imposing sarcophagus, thankfully, is still
 closed.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>examine gap
 The rectangular hole is about two feet wide and just tall enough for
 you, with some trepidation, to stick your arm into. It leads to a
 seemingly vertical, square, smooth-walled shaft. On its back wall is a
 curiously protruding stone.

 Unearthly, mocking laughter rings in your ears.

>enter gap
 The hole is too narrow to squeeze through.

>push stone
 Bracing your feet against the sarcophagus, you push against the stone
 with all your strength, and as it slides inwards you feel air move
 against your face and hear grinding from the wall just in front of you.

>push rock
 You don't feel any such thing.

>go down
 You carefully lower yourself, feet first, into the cramped shaft.

 Darkness (in a shaft)
 You are braced against the cold stone walls of a narrow, claustrophobic
 square shaft, trying unsuccessfully to avoid thinking about burial in a
 tall coffin. You could climb down with some care, or crawl back up into
 the sarcophagus room.

>go down

 Darkness (at the bottom of a shaft)
 You are at the bottom of the narrow shaft. On the floor is a heap of
 debris that cracks and crumbles under your feet. The air here has an
 unpleasant smell of decay.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>out
 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>examine debris
 This must have been some ancient mechanism of wood and rope, rotted
 away over the centuries and now completely unrecognisable. The useless,
 broken remains of your torch are scattered in this heap; you nearly cut
 yourself on a fragment of glass from the bulb. The remnants of several
 ancient ropes seem to lead underneath the south wall.

>hit south wall
 The wall collapses outwards with a loud crash, the noise of its fall
 resounding from what must be a cavernous chamber.

>go up
 You emerge from the darkness to an astonishing sight. Light pours onto
 the sarcophagus from the west, bathing the pharoah's austere face in an
 aura of blinding majesty. Perhaps it could be a trick of the shadows on
 your still-adjusting eyes, but you thought for a moment you saw those
 dead lips curve in the faintest shadow of a smile, bidding you a silent
 farewell. And this time, you do not look back as you run joyously
 outward and away from the grave, through the halls miraculously
 suffused with the light and warmth of the setting sun at the end of the
 corridor, as reality seems to blur and the winds of time sweep you,
 feather-light, forever up and closer to the sun...

 Reluctantly, you open your eyes to find that the sun is in fact the
 bare electric bulb of your living room, but something remains within
 you as a legacy of the trip...

 [You are no longer afraid of the dark.]

 Living Room
 This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa
 and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table.
 Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the
 warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the
 mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the
 stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling.

 A simple wooden staircase on the west wall leads up to the first floor;
 underneath the stairs is an utility closet. The kitchen can be seen
 through the empty doorway to the east.

 You shudder at the sight of a large spider hanging in the kitchen
 doorway.

 The front door is reassuringly and securely locked.

 You can also see an ornamental plate here.

 Watching the spider carefully, you carefully put the can of white paint
 underneath it in the doorway.

>throw plate at spider
 Mustering all your courage, you throw the ornamental plate at the
 startled spider, which lets go of its thread, landing in the open can
 of paint with a faint plop. As the loathsome thing struggles in the
 paint, you slam the lid back on, trapping it inside!

 The ornamental plate lands in the kitchen.

 Kitchen
 This room retains a faint smell of paint. Cupboards containing kitchen
 utensils and tinned food leer at you from the walls. The only exit is
 back west to the living room.

 On the counter is a pair of yellow gloves.

 Inverted in the sink is a glass bowl, reflecting the ceiling lamp in
 your eye.

 You can also see an ornamental plate here.

 Something scrapes across the roof as you stand petrified in fear.

>take gloves, plate
 gloves: Taken.
 ornamental plate: Taken.

>examine bowl
 Strangely drawn to the bowl, you tap a finger on its surface, and the
 sound rings out like a bell, an alarm bell repeating itself over and
 over in your head. Pealing a warning of danger, but how can it be, one
 tap on a glass hemisphere, creating such a cacophony - Run, escape,
 flee, calls a voice somewhere in your mind, but where to? You are
 trapped in a bell, the walls vibrating with every clang, shaking every
 bone in your body, and there is no way out...

 Centre of Crystal Dome
 You stand near the centre of a faceted, hemispherical crystal dome as
 large as a stadium. Unusual rock formations protrude from the rocky
 floor, which is streaked with mysteriously luminescent veins of quartz.
 Beyond the dome nothing can be made out but distorted reflections.

 Thrusting out of the floor before you is a many-pointed stalagmite that
 holds in its clawed grip an immense, eye-like red crystal.

 Hovering here is a sphere composed of swirling mist.

 The sphere floats up and down in time to your breathing.

>examine crystal
 The gleaming eye seems to sing softly to itself.

>examine sphere
 The hazy, translucent sphere is roughly the size of your head, and you
 stare at its shifting mists for a while, fascinated. It seems to be
 observing you.

 The sphere drifts closer to you, lightly touching you with soothing
 tendrils of mist.

>hit ocean
 You strike the crystal with all your might, and it emits a painful,
 dissonant shriek as it shudders - then shatters explosively, sending
 blade-like shards through your body...
 You were found near the skeleton of a window, neck impaled on an edge
 of blood-stained glass.

>go northeast

 Centre of Crystal Dome
 You stand near the centre of a faceted, hemispherical crystal dome as
 large as a stadium. Unusual rock formations protrude from the rocky
 floor, which is streaked with mysteriously luminescent veins of quartz.
 Beyond the dome nothing can be made out but distorted reflections.

 Thrusting out of the floor before you is a many-pointed stalagmite that
 holds in its clawed grip an immense, eye-like red crystal.

 Hovering here is a sphere composed of swirling mist.

 The sphere floats up and down in time to your breathing.

>touch sphere with quartz
 You notice no unusual effects.

>hit smoky with shard
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the smoky glass rod.

>touch smoky with shard
 The smoky rod emits a clear ringing sound which gradually fades into a
 deep rumble as darkness pours out of it.

>touch glowing with shard
 The glowing rod produces a clear ringing sound which gradually rises
 into a high trill as light pours out of it.

 The sphere orbits mournfully around the glowing red crystal.

 East of Crystal Dome
 You are near the edge of the strange dome, where the walls plunge
 vertically into the solid stone of the floor.

 A star of black onyx floats at head height here without visible means
 of support, its irregular geometrical spikes vaguely disturbing.

 take no more, and explode violently, piercing you with a thousand
 shards...

 You were found near the skeleton of a window, neck impaled on an edge
 of blood-stained glass.

 As the last crystal joins the chorus, the floor itself trembles with a
 sound that is nearly deafening even with your fingers tightly in your
 ears. The dome can take no more, and shatters with a sound that would
 once have been terrifying, but is now almost a gentle tinkle, as the
 chord of octaves transforms into an exultant song of freedom. Beyond
 the dome lies a strange sky, and the misty sphere whispers its thanks
 to you as it swirls away into the flaming red heavens. You raise your
 arm to protect your face from the rain of fragments from the falling
 dome...

 And hit the mantelpiece, for you are suddenly awake in your living
 room, lying by the fire, feeling relieved and somewhat more secure
 about yourself.

 [You are no longer afraid of sounds.]

 Living Room
 This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa
 and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table.
 Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the
 warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the
 mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the
 stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling.

 A simple wooden staircase on the west wall leads up to the first floor;
 underneath the stairs is an utility closet. The kitchen can be seen

 Living Room
 This spacious room is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush sofa
 and two matching armchairs are arranged around a low wooden tea-table.
 Curtains hang over the long windows on the south wall, keeping the
 warmth from the old electric fireplace in; a clock hangs over the
 mantelpiece. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the
 stark white glare of the unshielded bulb dangling from the ceiling.

 A simple wooden staircase on the west wall leads up to the first floor;
 underneath the stairs is an utility closet. The kitchen can be seen
 through the empty doorway to the east.

 The front door is reassuringly and securely locked.

 Upstairs Corridor
 You are in the western half of a plain whitewashed east-west corridor
 lit by a lamp hanging next to the stairs, which lead down to the ground

 Upstairs Corridor (by ladder)
 A ladder hangs down from a dark square hole in the high ceiling of this

 Study
 A large bookcase occupies the north wall of this brightly lit room.
 Next to the dull green curtains of the window stands a wooden desk.

 Somewhere nearby, you hear the burble of the hot water pipes.

>hit drawer
 Why not try opening it before resorting to such violent measures?

>open drawer
 The drawer is tightly jammed, which is rather irritating as you have a
 strange hunch that there might be something useful inside.

>hit drawer
 Frustrated, you aim a kick at the drawer and hear a satisfying crack.
 You cringe as the broken drawer crashes noisily to the floor, spilling
 out its contents.

>examine photograph
 It's an old photograph which was sent to you a few years ago by one of
 your friends studying in Cambridge, depicting a porcelain duck balanced
 high among the rafters of the college dining hall. Suddenly, you
 recollect a conversation you had with him a long time ago, about the
 old college tradition of taking the duck down from the rafters of the
 Great Hall in the dead of night and putting it back up on another beam
 the next day. As you wonder whether you'd have tried this feat yourself
 if you'd been there, you feel your surroundings somehow shifting...

 Great Hall (by screens)
 You are at the south end of a magnificent dining hall. The east and
 west walls stand thirty feet tall; near the top, stained-glass windows
 bearing coats of arms admit the light of the full moon. Below the
 windows hang pictures of past Masters of the college and illustrious
 former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches.
 Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof.

 To the south, wooden screens half the height of the walls separate the
 hall from an east-west passageway. Double doors set in the screens are
 locked and bolted shut.

 In the rafters at the far end of the hall, a duck perches incongruously
 on a beam.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a canvas satchel (which is closed)

>open satchel
 You open the canvas satchel, revealing a length of sewing thread, a
 squash ball, a catapult and a net.

>get all from satchel
 catapult: Removed.
 net: Removed.
 length of sewing thread: Removed.
 squash ball: Removed.

>take all from satchel
 You can't see any such thing.

>tie ball to thread
 You tie the squash ball to the length of sewing thread.

>untie net
 It comes apart fairly easily into one long piece of string. You don't
 really feel like trying to weave it back together again.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>tie thread to string
 You tie the length of sewing thread to the length of string.

>go north

 Great Hall
 You are in the middle of a magnificent dining hall. The east and west
 walls stand thirty feet tall; near the top, stained-glass windows
 bearing coats of arms admit the light of the full moon. Below the
 windows hang pictures of past Masters of the college and illustrious
 former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches.
 Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof.

 Directly above you is a hexagonal skylight set in the middle of the
 high ceiling.

 In the rafters at the north end of the hall, a duck perches
 incongruously on a beam.

 A double length of rope runs up the east wall to the skylight,
 presumably for opening and closing it. Its bottom ends are tied to the
 leg of a table just next to the wall.

>untie rope
 You untie the length of rope from the table.

>pull rope
 You pull it down without too much noise.

>tie rope to string
 You tie the length of rope to the length of string.

>tie rope to table
 You tie the length of rope to the table.

>shoot ball at rafter
 Taking careful aim, you let fly with the squash ball, which flies just
 over the beam on which the duck sits in a graceful arc... and hits the
 huge portrait on the north wall. Your heart sinks as you hear the glass
 shatter, and your only thought is to flee...

 You open your eyes in front of the fireplace, feeling rather dizzy all
 of a sudden. Surely things aren't supposed to happen this way.

 Great Hall (by high table)
 You are at the north end of a magnificent dining hall. The east and
 west walls stand thirty feet tall; near the top, stained-glass windows
 bearing coats of arms admit the light of the full moon. Below the
 windows hang pictures of past Masters of the college and illustrious
 former alumni, gazing down over the long rows of tables and benches.
 Shadowy rafters support the peaked roof.

 At the foot of the north wall, a wide area is raised several inches on
 a wooden platform, where the High Table stands. Hanging on the wall is
 a large portrait of the College's founder.

 Above you, just to the south of the high table, a duck perches
 incongruously on a beam.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>tie rope to table
 You tie the length of rope to the table.

>shoot ball at rafter
 Taking aim, you let fly with the squash ball, but feel the catapult's
 elastic brush against your hair. You watch the ball strike the beam
 just below the duck, which doesn't appear to have moved at all. The
 ball falls to the floor with an unnervingly loud thwack which you hope
 no one heard.

 [You'll be more careful with it next time.]

>shoot ball at rafter
 The ball flies gracefully over the beam, trailing the sewing thread
 behind it, and strikes the floor with a loud report. The impact
 detaches the ball from the thread, and it rolls off to become lost
 somewhere underneath the tables. However, the thread is now looped over
 the beam.

>pull thread
 You pull the length of string up and over the beam.

>pull string
 You pull the length of rope up and over the beam.

>wear satchel
 You put on the canvas satchel.

 You give the rope a few experimental tugs, and it seems to support your

 waste to turn back now. Gingerly, you ascend the rope.

 Great Hall (in the rafters)
 You are clinging to one of the lower beams of the rafters, trying not
 to look down. The beam's surface is covered with years of dust. Your
 rope is the only way back down.

 The infamous duck perches here.

 Your quest successful, you clamber over the screens and stealthily
 away, smiling as you think of the admiration you'll receive from your
 fellow students for this feat of daring.

 It is a terrible shock when the duck writhes in your hands, flattening
 into a mere photograph, but at least one thing from this dream has
 remained with you...

 [You are no longer afraid of heights.]

 The siren abruptly stops, and you hear the squeal of mistreated tyres.

>go up
 The ladder groans, but supports your weight easily.

 Fumbling in the dark a bit, you discover the light switch and flip it,
 illuminating the attic.

 Attic
 Dust covers the floorboards of this dim attic, lit by a weak ceiling
 lamp, and the air makes you sneeze. Some old chairs are piled
 unceremoniously in one corner. There is no sign of the missing keys.

 The growling, steam-breathing monster crouching by the north wall, upon
 closer inspection, turns out to be a leaky boiler, pipes raising its
 main tank slightly off the floor.

 The car comes to a halt just outside your house. You feel a sudden
 chill. They are coming for you!

 You hear several sharp raps on the front door, a harsh voice shouting
 "Open up! Police!"

 Looking underneath the boiler, you spy the lost keyring wedged between
 the tank and the floorboards. Grasping it in your gloved hands, you
 work it free.

 from a bottomless well. What have you done?

 The door isn't going to hold up much longer.

 On the kitchen doorway is a can of white paint.

 Panic boils within you with each stroke of the battering ram, and you
 know with terrible clarity that they must not be allowed to break the
 door down, as behind the dam the currents surge...

>unlock door
 What do you want to unlock the front door with?

>keys
 With trembling hands, you find the right key and turn it in the lock.

 You begin to hear the splintering of wood, the banging beginning to
 crumble your grip on sanity.

>open door
 It takes every ounce of determination in your body to turn the handle,
 but there is no other way to stop the banging. As three startled
 policemen charge, propelled by their own momentum, into a tangled heap
 on the sofa, you steel yourself and take that first step outside into
 the dawn...

 The Outside World

 A gentle breeze of fresh air caresses your cheek as you look out over
 the awakening city, gently blowing the fog away from your mind, calming
 the fevered waters. Sorrowful memories begin to stir; the plane crash
 so many months ago now, the rage against arbitrary, cruel fate, the
 endless gloom and desperation - but this time you firmly put them
 behind you, and breathe instead the scent of the dew and the symphony
 of the morning.

 Your reverie is broken by an anxious policeman tapping you on the
 shoulder. "Are you all right? The neighbours heard a lot of screaming -
 we're sorry we couldn't get here earlier, it's been a terrible
 night..."

 Smiling for the first time in an age, you explain that it was only a
 nightmare, apologizing for their trouble.

 As the departing car's roar fades into the distance, more mundane
 thoughts enter your mind. The house will need some redecorating, the
 medical researchers will definitely be hearing from you once the phone
 is fixed, and - somewhere you can't quite remember yet - your work
 awaits. But most importantly, the spectre of fear and the ghosts of the
 past no longer haunt you, and the rising sun inspires the hope of a new
 beginning.

 The long night is over.

>amusing

 While minor Ancient Egyptian tombs are still being discovered, rumours
 of buried pyramids remain unsubstantiated. Concealed shafts and hidden
 chambers in known pyramids, meanwhile, remain mysterious.

 The Great Hall is based on that of Trinity College, Cambridge. The
 actual duck is plastic now, the porcelain one having been dropped
 thirty feet by accident several years ago; and the solution in the game
 has actually been successfully applied in real life. (Well, no one was
 actually inconsiderate enough to pull down the skylight rope...)

 The sphere in the Crystal Dome symbolically represents the character's
 subconscious that seeks freedom from the self-imposed barriers of fear,
 represented by the dome. The appearance of the resonating crystals is
 based on a dream the author had during the course of programming.

 Your character's voice has a range of two octaves, in case you were
 wondering why singing to the crystals didn't always work.

 Amusing things to try: singing to the rods in the crystal dome,
 attempting to get the duck while still on the hall floor, trying to
 leave or extinguish the torch outside the pyramid, hiding in the
 closet, looking under the bed...

 You are running for your life down dark, labyrinthine corridors, your
 heart pounding almost as loudly as the heavy boots of your relentless
 pursuer. But your legs are collapsing under you, your breaths coming in
 ragged gasps. At the last, strength fails you and you collapse
 face-down upon the unforgiving concrete. Cold hands grasp your neck,
 hauling you upright, forcing your unwilling eyes open to gaze into the
 hard, cruel, familiar face of your captor - and you scream with the
 horrible recognition that those twisted features are your own.

 You are still screaming when you awaken in sweat-drenched clothes,
 deeply relieved that it was only a dream. Yet something is not right.
 Why does the darkness beyond the window look so threatening? Why do the
 sounds of the night bear such menace? Indeed, why are you in such
