 HIP or DRIP?

 Are you a keen gal, or a dull dame? This ten-question Quiz-O-Matric
 info-matrix--designed with the latest science in mind--will tell you
 if you're on track for a fairy-tale ending, or if you need to make
 some changes to keep your Prince Charming from riding right on by!

 Question 1: Most importantly, what color is your hair?

 1) Blonde.
 2) Black.
 3) Red.
 4) Brown.

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Black.]</span>

 You may not be at the top of the social pyramid, but this solid choice
 won't hold you back, either--keep your raven tresses washed and
 bobbed, and you'll still get plenty of attention!  Just watch your
 wardrobe, and stay away from dungarees and too-bright colors.  You
 don't want to look ethnic!

 Question 2: Worries may bring wrinkles, but from time to time, we all
 get a little fretful--it's our feminine nature! What worries you the
 most?

 1) My clothes.
 2) My weight.
 3) Nuclear war.
 4) My makeup.

>4

 <span class="floydstyle em">[My makeup.]</span>

 Every girl worries about her makeup. Remember  those old sayings from
 'when mother was a girl': "If you're in a rush, just a little blush"
 but "it's worth half an hour to cover that glower!" Also, "girls who
 eat off their lipstick soon find it makes hips thick." We hope those
 help!

 Question 3: We've all got that one can't-live-without-it item we tuck
 into our purses before leaving the house. What's yours?

 1) A book of poems. Ah, Dickinson!
 2) A girl can't be too careful, so I always carry a switchblade.
 3) My collapsible hula hoop!
 4) Don't laugh, but...I still carry a teddy bear.

>3

 <span class="floydstyle em">[My collapsible hula hoop!]</span>

 You're a real party-girl, and your careful choice shows that you're a
 fun date AND you like to keep fit. Just watch where you swing those
 hips; a modest hooper is a popular hooper!

 Question 4: What is your favorite flavor of ice cream?

 1) Vanilla.
 2) Chocolate.
 3) Strawberry.
 4) Mint.
 5) Lime.
 6) Fudge ripple.
 7) Raspberry.
 8) Rocky road.
 9) Black Forest double fudge.
 10) Tutti-frutti.
 11) Death-by-chocolate triple fudge.

 As you put your pencil to the page, Jimmy yanks the magazine away from
 you. "Aw, come on, Bonnie! Whyagotta keep your nose stuck in that
 magazine alla time? What are you doin', takin' a test? Gee whiz, you'd
 think we were in class instead of at the Parking Spot!" He leans back
 in the driver's seat and folds his muscular arms across his chest.
 "Aren't we gonna... you know...park?"

 1) Let's look this "Jimmy" customer over.
 2) <span class="floydstyle em">"Steady girlfriend,</span> huh? You mean you weren't just up here
 with that German exchange student?"
 3) "We haven't even been dating that long. What will people say?"
 4) Your mind is made up--you're gonna kiss him!
 5) Your mind is made up--no way are you gonna kiss him!

>3

 <span class="floydstyle em">["We haven't even been dating that long. What will people</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">say?"]</span>

 "Aw, we've been on five dates already. If I don't get kissed soon, the
 fellas will start callin' me a yellow-belly!"

 1) Let's look this "Jimmy" customer over.
 2) <span class="floydstyle em">"Steady girlfriend,</span> huh? You mean you weren't just up here
 with that German exchange student?"
 3) Your mind is made up--you're gonna kiss him!
 4) Your mind is made up--no way are you gonna kiss him!

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Let's look this "Jimmy" customer over.]</span>

 He's a real dreamboat--tall, tan, his athlete's body wrapped in a
 tight varsity jacket that shows off his broad chest and well-muscled
 arms. He sees you looking and flashes his trademark gleaming grin, the
 one that makes girls melt into puddles.

 1) <span class="floydstyle em">"Steady girlfriend,</span> huh? You mean you weren't just up here
 with that German exchange student?"
 2) Your mind is made up--you're gonna kiss him!
 3) Your mind is made up--no way are you gonna kiss him!

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Steady girlfriend,</span> huh? You mean you weren't just up here
 with that German exchange student?"]

 "Gosh, no! I mean, I was. But that was before I met you, and anyway,
 she was awful, just awful. Her breath tasted like those weird
 cigarettes she smokes and she wouldn't shut up about, gosh, I don't
 know what-all it was about. And she had that gross hairy mole on her
 rear end!"

 1) "I guess I can expect you to blab to the next girl about MY hairy
 mole..."
 2) Your mind is made up--you're gonna kiss him!
 3) Your mind is made up--no way are you gonna kiss him!

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["I guess I can expect you to blab to the next girl about MY hairy</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">mole..."]</span>

 "Ha, ha" Jimmy snorts. He looks concerned. "Wait, Bonnie. That was a
 joke, right?"

 1) Your mind is made up--you're gonna kiss him!
 2) Your mind is made up--no way are you gonna kiss him!

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Your mind is made up--no way are you gonna kiss him!]</span>

 "Look," you say, "I'm sorry, but...I'm just not that sort of girl."
 Jimmy frowns.  "I'm starting to think you're not a girl at all--you're
 more like a cold fish!"
 "Well, better a cold fish than an overheated wolf!" you shoot back.
 "Well, I'D rather be a wolf than a stuck-up cow!"

 The conversation goes steadily downhill from there.

 "Yak!"
 "Skunk!"
 "Crab!"
 "Hippo!"
 "Oooh, grow up you...you axolotl!"
 "Well, you're a gazelle! Only, y'know, like an insult, as in 'That
 Bonnie, she's dumb as a gazelle!'  I'm not calling you graceful--"
 "Wait, shh!  What was that?"  A sound outside the car has caught your
 attention.
 attention.It's a low gurgling noise, like the gentle babbling of a
 brook. But that's impossible--The Parking Spot is at the top of a
 cliff! There's nothing up here but pine trees and gravel roads. The
 headlights throw the shadows of the trunks into sharp relief.

 A black shape appears right in front of you! You stifle a shriek. It's
 only a deer. The doe ignores you, wandering off into the trees.

 The gurgling noise gets louder, than starts to die away. "It's
 probably just Old Man McDillingfitty," Jimmy says. "That old busybody
 is always trying to get us kids in trouble!"

 With a sickening thud, half of a deer carcass smashes into the front
 of the car, splattering the windshield with intestines and
 greenish-yellow ichor. The hindquarters are completely gone, ripped
 cleanly off, or maybe melted by the glowing goo which is now burning
 its way through the engine.

 "My car!" Jimmy cries. "That's it.  Stay here, Bonnie.  I'm going to
 go give that dirty old man a piece of my mind!"
 go give that dirty old man a piece of my mind!"He gets out of the car
 and walks towards the trees. "Hello?  Mr. McDillingfitty? Is that
 you?"

 The gurgling, slithering noise gets louder and louder. You can hear
 noises, heavy but somehow soft, like garbage bags full of gelatin
 dropping into a parking lot from an enormous height. A shadow rises
 above the trees, visible only as an absense of stars.

 "Golly," Jimmy says. "McDillingfitty is taller than I remembered.  He
 was in the war, wasn't he? Uh--maybe--maybe we should just go--"

 A ropy tentacle as thick around as a tree trunk shoots out of the
 woods and lifts Jimmy off of his feet. "Oh, heck!" he cries in alarm
 as he's hoisted into the air.  The headlights flicker and die. Abrupt
 and near-total darkness is split by screams of agony. "My brain!
 You're <span class="floydstyle em">guzzling</span> my <span class="floydstyle em">brain!</span> Y-you're not Old Man
 McDilling--"

 His voice cuts off, and you can hear horrible sucking sounds. Oh gosh!
 He's being devoured alive! Oh gosh! Oh gosh! That monster--that
 horrible thing out there, whatever it is--is <span class="floydstyle em">eating</span> him! And
 now it's going to eat <span class="floydstyle em">you!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Oh my gosh!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mercury Meteor</span>
 You're crouched in the front seat of Jimmy's car. Well, technically
 now it's kind of your car, since he's dead and your were practically
 almost sort of his girlfriend. It comes fully loaded with all the
 latest options: a steering wheel, glove compartment, horn, parking
 brake, headlights and so on.

 Outside is a sea of moonless black, but you know roughly where you
 are--you're at The Parking Spot, with the front of the car pointing up
 the steep incline towards the patch of scraggly pines growing on the
 mountaintop. A short dirt path behind you leads back down to the main
 road.

 You can't see a horrible monster here, but that doesn't mean there
 isn't one.

>examine me

 You're Bonnie Noodleman, a spunky eighteen-year-old with raven-black
 hair. You're wearing a stylish pleated gray skirt and navy-blue
 sweater.

>examine car

 Wow, this is a real keen ride! It's got all sorts of features, like a
 horn, and headlights, and a parking brake, and even a steering wheel,
 and the whole thing is painted a real swell red that you could get out
 and admire if it wasn't pitch dark, and if you could leave the car
 without dying messily.

>start car

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>drive car

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>turn on ignition

 (That's not one of the available props in this scene.)


 It keeps the car from rolling away. It's on right now. You can PULL it
 to take it off.

>pull brake

 You yank hard on the brake. The car shudders, then begins rolling
 backwards.  Oh, goody--it's working! You feel happy butterflies in
 your belly as the Meteor gently slides back onto the smooth asphalt of
 the main road.

 The slithering, gibbering noises are fading. Whatever that
 brain-guzzling monster is, every second that passes is taking you
 farther away from it. And not only are you escaping, but as your
 escape continues, it goes faster...

 ...and faster...

 ...and maybe you're escaping a little TOO much, because you've got to
 be going about seventy or eighty miles now backwards down a mountain
 road in a car that doesn't really work.
>pull break
 road in a car that doesn't really work.You grab the wheel and do your
 best to at least steer, whipping around corners at high speed and
 barely staying on the road.  You're doing okay, though--and then you
 see it in the rearview mirror! Dead Teenager's Curve, the most
 dangerous patch of road in the state. Golly, don't tell me you
 survived a monster attack only to die in an ordinary traffic accident!

 You wrestle with the wheel, but it's not enough. The Meteor bursts
 through the guardrail and sails out into an ocean of cold air and
 stars! Oh gosh! It's going end over end now, sky and ground switching
 places in a dizzying whirl. "Jeepers, what a pickle!" you think as
 your forehead smashes into the steering column.
 your forehead smashes into the steering column...........
 your forehead smashes into the steering column.....................
 your forehead smashes into the steering
 column.....................Your eyelids flutter open. Holy moly, does
 your head ever hurt! You drag yourself out from under the wreckage of
 the Meteor, crawling on your belly into the light of a cool, gray
 morning. You feel awful, but at least you're alive.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Drive-In</span>
 You're standing in the drive-in on the edge of town, where all the
 coolest teens come to ignore movies. To the north is Make-Out
 Mountain, and flanking it are a number of less controversial
 mountains. Mist hangs in the cool air, clinging to the stunted pines
 and making the screen slick with tiny droplets. A dirt road leads
 south, and you can see buildings nestled in the low bowl of the
 valley.

 A smoking wreck is parked here upside down.

>examine wreck

 The remains of the Mercury Meteor -- well, technically, now that it's
 hit the Earth's surface the correct term is "meteorite." Most of it's
 destroyed, but the glove compartment survived.

>look in glove compartment

 You can't see inside, since the glove compartment is closed.

>open glove compartment

 You open the glove compartment, revealing a Canyonville High yearbook.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Foreword: Advice for Today's Teen-Ager]</span>

 Words of Wisdom from your Beloved Principal, Oswald J. Dunkin.

 How times have changed! When I was a lad, a youth in Canyonville meant
 summers helping dear old Dad on his pine nut plantation or cranking my
 old Model T to take my sweetheart to the movies. The teens of today
 can expect to spend their salad days soaring through space, trading in
 the old shovel and hoe for a pair of rocket repair gloves and magnetic
 astro-boots. Yet we dusty old fogies have, perhaps, picked up a thing
 or two in our time on this Earth--so it would indeed behoove you to
 listen up, because what I've got to say might just help you out some
 day!

 Always remember the value of a friendly word. If you see someone,
 friend or stranger, TALK TO them! This simple courtesy is sure to help
 you get ahead in life.

 Also, try to keep in mind that whatever this old universe of ours
 throws at you, there's always a way out, and you can never really die.
 If you do happen upon some awkward patch of the universe that won't
 allow you to proceed, simply UNDO to move a short distance backwards
 in time! Truly, the modern age is filled with marvels!

 With warmest thanks to all my students, Oswald J. Dunkin, Principal.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[TOWN HISTORY: Our Shining Past]</span>

 Boston entrepreneur Charles Fobb came west in 1841 with a dream--a
 dream of a rich, fertile paradise nestled in the heart of the New
 Mexican desert. What he found was Canyonville.

 When Fobb arrived, the savage inhabitants of "Tuva", as they called
 it, lived a stagnant life of sloth and indolence, grown fat and lazy
 on the abundant pine nuts and other natural bounty. Saddened at this
 wasted potential, the kind-hearted Fobb used his golden tongue to
 convince them to leave the valley for a challenging, industrious life
 of adventure in the surrounding desert -- except for a few fast
 friends who were extended an invitation to stay on as Fobb's honored
 guests. Tuva was rechristened Fobbville, and our city's history began.

 The little town prospered, founding a rich agricultural tradition.
 Pine nuts were soon seen on tables from Fobb's native Boston to
 Buckingham Palace. Then in 1863--tragedy! Changes to the US legal code
 resulted in Fobb losing his beloved farmhands. An ill-advised attempt
 at switching to polished-pine buggywhip handles devastated Fobbville's
 food production potential for a decade. Fobb's son, Johnward Cable
 Fobb, soundly defeated Charles in the mayoral election, ushering in a
 new error of honest government which lasted until he was tragically
 hanged for murder and horse theft in 1877.

 The town, now renamed Canyonville, was by now a popular crossroads of
 commerce and ideas. In 1912, statehood came knocking, and our city
 answered the call, boldly throwing its hat in the ring for
 consideration as state capital. Sadly, the people of New Mexico
 foolishly took pity on the poorly-run shantytown of Santa Fe instead.

 Never one to rest on its considerable laurels, Canyonville rebounded,
 becoming a bustling tourist destination. The World's Largest Pine Nut,
 a magnificent behemoth the size of a size four ladies' evening
 slipper, stood in the town square from 1917 to 1933, when it was
 devoured by a squirrel.  The town took the loss in stride, playfully
 holding a "trial" for the hungry beast before sentencing him to be
 hanged by the neck until dead. The squirrel died of natural causes two
 years later, and the warrant for whoever was sneaking him food remains
 outstanding. By that time, a new world's largest pine nut had been
 located and placed in a secure case in the city hall atrium, where it
 remained until being cracked and rendered into nut butter for the war
 effort in 1942.

 Truly, a history of triumph! What's next for Canyonville?  Only you,
 her treasured youth, can finish this story.

 is Pine Nut Days, our annual celebration of nature's glorious bounty.
 Goggle at the parade, thrill to fairground extravagance, or try one of

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Drive-In</span>
 You're standing in the drive-in on the edge of town, where all the
 coolest teens come to ignore movies. To the north is Make-Out
 Mountain, and flanking it are a number of less controversial
 mountains. Mist hangs in the cool air, clinging to the stunted pines
 and making the screen slick with tiny droplets. A dirt road leads
 south, and you can see buildings nestled in the low bowl of the
 valley.

 A smoking wreck is parked here upside down.

>examine drive-in

 (That's not one of the available props in this scene.)

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Saguaro 300 Block</span>
 You're standing on Saguaro Road, in a part of town your mother doesn't
 like you going. A junkyard squats to the west, and to the east, an old
 barn has been painted black and blue and hung with a neon sign reading
 "The Beat Barn." A dirt road leads north to the drive-in, and Saguaro
 Road itself heads into town to the south and curves northeast into the
 woods.

 A sketchbook lies abandoned in the road.

>take book

 (the sketchbook)
 Taken.

>examine it

 A thick pad of drawing paper. Some up-and-coming young artist must
 have dropped this on their way out of the coffeehouse. You could READ
 it to take a look at the sketches.

>read it

 How strange! Instead of being filled with sunsets and chubby naked
 ladies, like a normal artist's sketchbook, it's filled with nothing
 but drawings of Campbell's soup cans!   No wonder someone threw it
 away. Nobody's going to pay for soup can drawings, even if they are
 awful realistic looking!

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">McDillingfitty's Junkyard</span>
 Generations of garbage have been piled here in haphazard stacks,
 rusting and slowly sinking into the earth under the weight of tons of
 scrap. The only way out is to the east.

 McDillingfitty's "house", a rusting metal silo, stands empty, slowly
 falling apart under the weight of the ages.

 A goat is eyeing you suspiciously.

>goat, hello

 There is no reply.

 The goat suddenly takes it upon himself to butt his head into you,
 causing you to drop the game pamphlet.

>take pamphlet

 Taken.

>pet goat

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>search garbage

 You find nothing of interest.

 The goat nibbles at some nonexistent grass.

 The goat suddenly takes it upon himself to butt his head into you,
 causing you to drop the game pamphlet.

>take pamphlet

 Taken.

 The goat looks at you as if you were a plump, juicy tin can.

>examine house

 It's a little taller than a one-story house, but too narrow to have
 much living space. There's an open hatch on the side where a door
 probably used to be. You never noticed it before, but there are
 numbers printed on the side: "X271 -- Minsystems Labs."

>enter house

 The goat bleats menacingly at you as you get close to the silo, and
 you hastily take several steps back.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a game pamphlet
   a sketchbook
   a Canyonville High yearbook
   a collapsible hula hoop
   a skirt-and-sweater combo (being worn)

>feed sketchbook to goat

 The goat's mouth waters as he looks at the tastily realistic cans. Oh
 my gosh!  He sinks his teeth into the sketchbook and gobbles it up in
 seconds! At least it was worth something to somebody.

 The goat looks much friendlier now. He's eyeing you as if you might
 know where there's more food.

>enter house

 You poke your head in and look around.  There's nothing inside except
 a smell so dreadful it nearly makes your permanent wave go limp.
 McDillingfitty is nowhere to be seen.

>smell

 It smells pretty normal here.

>out

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>look

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Saguaro 300 Block</span>
 You're standing on Saguaro Road, in a part of town your mother doesn't
 like you going. A junkyard squats to the west, and to the east, an old
 barn has been painted black and blue and hung with a neon sign reading
 "The Beat Barn." A dirt road leads north to the drive-in, and Saguaro
 Road itself heads into town to the south and curves northeast into the
 woods.

 The goat trots after you.

>go east

 You knock politely on the barn door. It opens just wide enough for a
 man with a goatee and a beret to stick his pointy nose though. "Like,
 beat it, chicky," he says. "We're, like, closedville until tonight,
 you dig?" He shuts the door in your face.

>go east

 You rap sharply on the barn door, but nobody answers.

>time

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Harding Tunnel Entrance</span>
 From here, the road plunges northeast into the sheer cliffs and curves
 gently southwest towards town. Twisted-looking pines frame the tunnel
 entrance itself, which is pitch black and smells moist and alive. Far
 above you, you can see the sleek modernist wedge of Minsystems Labs
 perched at the edge of the cliffs.

 The goat trots after you.

>go northeast

 Gosh, why? It's nearly a mile of damp, dark spookiness, and there's
 not much on the other side except cattle ranches, and eventually
 Albuquerque.

>go up

 What, straight up the cliffs? Better teen-agers than you have tried!
 Well, not so much better as deader.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Saguaro 200 Block</span>
 The pavement here is filled with cracks and potholes, but the shop
 windows are neatly polished and more than one shabby building has been
 given a fresh, bright coat of paint. Yoshida Floral is on the east
 side of the street, and the sidewalk in front of it is scattered with
 petals. A faint sickly yellow glow is emanating from inside the shop.
 Saguaro Road runs north and south from here.

 Jenny Yoshida is sweeping up in front of her family's shop.

 The goat trots after you.

>talk to jenny


 [Picture number 3 here.]

 "Hi, Bonnie!" Jenny says brightly.  "Thanks for stopping by.  Are you
 on the way to the parade? Jeepers, Bons, you don't look too good. Is
 everything okay?

 1) "My boyfriend was just devoured by some kind of...of brain guzzling
 monster!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["My boyfriend was just devoured by some kind of...of brain</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">guzzling monster!"]</span>

 "Ha, ha, real funny, Bons."

 1) "No, really--this huge, hulking, slimy thing guzzled Jimmy's brain
 right in front of me!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["No, really--this huge, hulking, slimy thing guzzled Jimmy's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">brain right in front of me!"]</span>

 "Well--um--if you say so." Jenny bites her lip. "Look, uh, if
 something bad happened to you, maybe you should tell the police about
 it. The station is just down the street, just turn left when you hit
 the parade."

 1) "Parade?"
 2) "I should get going."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Parade?"]</span>

 "The Pine Nut Days parade, of course!" Jenny says. "Gosh, it's only
 about the biggest event of the year. Why, Mary Jane Minsky is Miss
 Canyonville Pine Nut Queen of 1959!  How could you forget a thing like
 that?"

 1) "Oh, that's swell! I'm glad MJ won the pageant."
 2) "That airhead? Ugh, how embarrassing."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Oh, that's swell! I'm glad MJ won the pageant."]</span>

 "Well, of course, isn't absolutely everybody? She makes such a pretty
 Queen, and she's so passionate about pine nuts and their many
 commercial uses!" Jenny sighs. "Gosh, I wish I could be there in the
 crowd, cheering for her!"

 1) "You and Mary Jane must be best friends."
 2) "So why AREN'T you at the parade?"
 3) "I should get going."

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["So why AREN'T you at the parade?"]</span>

 "Don't you think I want to be?" Jenny says bitterly. "But it's my job
 to sweep up all these petals and trimmings, and Granny says I have to
 do my chores EVERY DAY, even if there's a parade. Plus she's worried
 someone will break in if I don't guard the place. Even though there's
 not even any merchandise!

 1) "You and Mary Jane must be best friends."
 2) "If there's no merchandise, what's that glowing in the store?"
 3) "I should get going."

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["If there's no merchandise, what's that glowing in the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">store?"]</span>

 "Oh, that's just a little plant I'm growing from a seed I found in the
 woods. Well, it's still just a seed, so far, but, uh, any day now!"

 1) "You and Mary Jane must be best friends."
 2) "Can I take a look at your seed?"
 3) "I should get going."

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Can I take a look at your seed?"]</span>

 "Uh, Granny will pitch a fit if I let you in while we're supposed to
 be closed. Sorry!"

 1) "You and Mary Jane must be best friends."
 2) "So, still sweeping?"
 3) "Hey, Jenny, how about I find someone else to do this for you? Then
 you could go see the parade."
 4) "I should get going."

>3

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Hey, Jenny, how about I find someone else to do this for you?</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Then you could go see the parade."]</span>

 Jenny smiles. "That would be wonderful! Who do you have in mind?"

 1) "I'll do it!"
 2) "I bet this goat is hungry enough to eat these clippings. He's a
 real rough customer, too!"

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["I bet this goat is hungry enough to eat these clippings. He's a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">real rough customer, too!"]</span>

 "Wow, uh, you know, that could work!" Jenny is beaming ear to ear. She
 grabs you in a sudden hug. "Which means I can go to the parade now!
 Thank you, Bons! Thank you so much!"

 Jenny is practically skipping as she heads south toward the sounds of
 marching band music.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Yoshida Floral</span>
 A quaint little flower shop, minus the flowers. Even with the shelves
 bare, it feels almost claustrophobic. The exit is west, and stairs
 lead up to the Yoshidas' apartment.

 A seedling growth chart is tacked to the wall here.

 You can also see a glowing seed here.

>examine chart

 It looks like this is the chart Jenny's going to use to track the
 growth of her mysterious "plant", Mary Jane Junior, once it hatches,
 er, germinates. The chart itself hasn't been filled in yet, but Jenny
 has typed a number of predictions in the "notes" section. "Of course,
 it's impossible to know just how large my little 'Mary Jane' might
 get, but with the nutrient saturation the subject is receiving now, I
 wouldn't be surprised to see a tripling or even a quadrupling of size
 within days, once growth begins in earnest!"

>So Steph Cherrywell has been watching a lot of MST3K, it would seem.

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>examine seed

 It's about the size of a tennis ball, lumpy and irregular, and covered
 in spiny armor. It's also sweating a thick, glowing ooze. It's the
 strangest-looking seed you've ever seen. If it wasn't half-buried in a
 pot of earth, you'd swear it looked more like an egg or something!
 "Mary Jane Junior" is written on the pot with magic marker.

>take egg

 Taken.

 around. That's a good way to get a reputation as a Sally Snoopypants!

 Saguaro Road runs south into Main Street here. The town police station
 is to the east. The Pine Nut Festival Parade fills Main Street, and
 the sidewalks are crammed with parade-watchers in both directions.

 The Canyonville High marching band passes by in an enthusiastic mess
 of oompah horns and bleating piccolos.

>examine parade

 You stand on tip-toe and just watch for a while.

 The Canyonville High flag squad marches past, banners fluttering.

>examine parade-watchers

 A tightly-packed, sardinelike wall of human flesh.

 A float shaped like a pink Cadillac slides by.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Police Station</span>
 Your sleepy little town doesn't have much need for active policing, so
 the building is small and the police officers are large. It's really
 not much more than a little office that also functions as an overnight
 hotel for drunks and delinquents. Double doors open onto Saguaro Road
 to the west.

 Officer Buck Wilcox is relaxing with his feet up on the desk.

>talk to wilcox


 [Picture number 4 here.]

 Buck Wilcox nods at you. "Something I can help you with, Miss?"

 1) "You've got to help me, Officer! My boyfriend Jimmy was just eaten
 by some sort of horrible BRAIN GUZZLER!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["You've got to help me, Officer! My boyfriend Jimmy was just</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">eaten by some sort of horrible BRAIN GUZZLER!"]</span>

 "Hold on. Let's hear that again, without the goofy teen-age
 jibber-jabber."

 1) "No, that wasn't slang, he was literally torn limb from limb and
 guzzled down right in front of me by an awful gelatinous monstrosity!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["No, that wasn't slang, he was literally torn limb from limb and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">guzzled down right in front of me by an awful gelatinous</span>

 "Suuure he was.  Let me guess--this 'monstrosity', was it bright pink
 with a loooong nose and, heh heh, big floppy ears?"

 1) "I'm not drunk, Officer, and I haven't gone mad--there really is
 something out there! It's probably from space-or-or the bottom of the
 ocean or something like that and golly, you've got to warn everyone,
 or this town will be in deep soup!"

 <span class="floydstyle em">["I'm not drunk, Officer, and I haven't gone mad--there really is</span>

 "Look, little missy, I'd hate to have to throw a nice girl like you in
 the drunk tank. Go home and sleep it off, all right?"

 1) "I'm telling the truth! Oh, how can I convince you?"
 2) "That gosh-darn parade is in the way! Can't you tell the crowd to
 disperse a little so I can get past?"
 3) "Shouldn't you be out doing your job?"
 4) "You want proof--take a look at this! An alien egg!"
 5) "Forget I even brought this up."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["I'm telling the truth! Oh, how can I convince you?"]</span>

 "All right, missy," Buck says, laughing. "If you can show me an
 example of one of these mysterious brain guzzlers of yours, something
 really 'out of this world', THEN maybe I'll admit we have a problem.
 Until then, why don't you scoot off and sober up a little, hmm?"

 1) "What evidence was it you wanted me to find, again?"
 2) "That gosh-darn parade is in the way! Can't you tell the crowd to
 disperse a little so I can get past?"
 3) "Shouldn't you be out doing your job?"
 4) "You want proof--take a look at this! An alien egg!"
 5) "Forget I even brought this up."

>4

 <span class="floydstyle em">["You want proof--take a look at this! An alien egg!"]</span>

 "Hmm..." Buck frowns, taking the seed from you and peering at it.
 "There IS somethin' mighty odd-looking about--"

 The phone rings, and Buck picks it up. "Police. Hmm? You say your cows
 are dead? Something guzzled their brains? Yeah, I've heard of that
 sort of thing--probably just some teen-age delinquents, but I'll come
 and take a look. Mister? Mister, I sure can't hear you over all that
 slithering." He pulls the phone away from his ear. "Now, there's no
 need to scream at me. I'll be out as soon as I can."

 "Sorry, missy. Sounds like your delinquent friends are causing trouble
 at the old Bristlender place. I'll have to deal with you later."

 1) "Jeepers, would you please listen to me. I'm telling you that
 something dangerous is out there--I have the gosh darn evidence right
 here in front of you.  If you go up there, you could be killed!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Jeepers, would you please listen to me. I'm telling you that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">something dangerous is out there--I have the gosh darn evidence right</span>

 Buck shakes you roughly. "Calm down! I don't have time to deal with a
 hysterical girl right now. I'm going to have to lock you up until I
 get back so you don't panic and hurt yourself." He drags you to the
 drunk tank and shoves you inside. "There. I'm going to collar some
 teen-aged troublemakers, and when I get back, I'll expect a full
 apology for wasting valuable police time."

 He walks out, leaving you trapped.  Somehow, though, between
 adrenaline and the angry goat and the untreated concussion you've been
 carrying around since the car accident, you're too exhausted to care
 just at the moment. Collapsing onto the cot, you fall into uneasy
 sleep.

 You wake to the sound of a key rattling in the door. It's Deputy
 Wilcox, Buck's nephew. "Miss?  I just can't be worryin' about you
 right now, with all what's goin' on and me all by my lonesome with Unk
 off doin' goodness knows what. You're free to go, I guess."

 He helps you out of the cell before leaving. You're sore, stiff, and
 hungry, but free. Through the window, you can see the noonday sun
 beating down. You must have been passed out for hours! Who knows what
 sort of living heck the town has become in the meantime?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Finch's Diner</span>
 The Finch family operates this shabby but comfortable burger joint,
 where the food is cheap, the smiles are free, and the decor can be
 summed up as "orange paint". A family photo and a daily specials
 chalkboard are hanging up behind the counter. You can go northeast to
 get back to the street.

 Renee Finch is wiping down tables.

 Comes with poooooisonous lead toy."

>examine photo

 Renee with her parents. It was taken a few years ago after they moved
 into town and bought the place. Her mom and dad had a wedding in the
 diner on opening day, since mixed-race couples couldn't get married
 where they lived before, and you remember her dad flipping burgers in
 the back and her mom waiting tables in her dress. It looks a little
 surreal in the photo, if you don't know the story.

>talk to renee


 [Picture number 6 here.]

 "Hey.  Can I get you something?"

 1) "Renee! You like all that space stuff, right? Little green men and
 slime monsters and...and alien brain guzzlers and things?"

 wrong with having a little imagination, huh?"

 1) "It's kind of empty in here. Where is everybody?"
 2) "Where did you get that unusual-looking gun?"
 3) "I want to order something, please."
 4) "Guess that's it for now."

 "Sure thing. I'll stick it on your tab." Renee grills up a Finch's
 Famous Depth Charge Deluxe, a steaming monument to hot peppers and
 grease, wraps it in paper, and slides it over to you. "Here ya go! Our
 motto is, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger! Or at least,
 you know, bigger."

 1) "It's kind of empty in here. Where is everybody?"

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Where did you get that unusual-looking gun?"]</span>

 Renee grins and pulls out the weapon. "Pretty cool, huh? I found it on
 that mountain where the white kids go to make out. I went there last
 night to watch for unindentified flying... birds.  I
 didn't...see...anything, but I found this...toy...near the...near
 nowhere."

 1) "Does it work?"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Does it work?"]</span>

 "How would I know?" Renee says defensively. "I mean, it's just a toy.
 Of course it doesn't 'work'! Why do you care, anyway?"

 1) "Renee, if you saw something, you can tell me. I've seen it too! It
 was some sort of huge, horrible THING and it <span class="floydstyle em">ate</span> my

 Renee narrows her eyes.  "You'll excuse me if I'm a little skeptical."

 This small mom-and-pop store has almost everything, except Mom and

 There's also a pair of eye-catching promotional displays, one green,

>examine note

 It's a handwritten note.  "We're At The Fair! If you want to buy
 something--just leave money on the counter. We Trust You! Signed, Mom
 and Pop. P.S. Thieves will be pumped full of rock salt."

>examine comic books

 Your parents say these are trash, but you've always wanted to READ
 some.

>read comic books

 There sure are a lot of comics here! You spend a few minutes leafing
 through them.  Most of them are pretty ridiculous scenarios with none
 of the realism of a good Hollywood movie. <span class="floydstyle em">Jungle Tales</span> has a
 story about a reporter who crashes in the jungle and finds a magic
 idol. <span class="floydstyle em">Weird Sci-Fi</span> is all about some space explorers being
 menaced by a monster, but the surprise twist is they were alien plants
 the whole time and the monster is a big cow. Gosh, they're not kidding
 when they say this stuff is trash! Still, you find one that's not
 bad--a little volume called <span class="floydstyle em">Poppy, Girl of the Galaxy</span>, about
 a girl starship captain and her loyal robot dog RF-RF. You read on,
 and are pulled into a rollicking tale of action and suspense as Poppy
 and RF-RF face off against "The Stellar Smugglers". Before you know
 it, you've reached the final page...

 POPPY: Jeepers, RF! That sure was a close call!
 RF-RF: You said it, Poppy! You know, I thought for sure that space
 worm was a bad egg.  But in the end, he saved us from the smugglers.
 Sorta funny!
 POPPY: It makes you think, doesn't it, chum? How much life have we
 rejected--how many wars have been started--by those two little words
 "I assume"? A true Girl of the Galaxy doesn't reject someone just
 because they're slimy or a little different.  Scrape away that slime
 and you might find a friend coccooned underneath!

 Gosh, what a story! You even got a little misty-eyed at that moving
 ending.

 little damage to her royal figure."

 Mary Jane murmurs something to one of her Pine Nut Ladies-In-Waiting,
 who writes it down on a clipboard.

>examine pies

 They all look extremely delicious!

 Mary Jane and her retinue move down to the next pie.

>give burger to Mary Jane

 (That's not one of the available props in this scene.)

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a physical results chart
   a cosmic ray gun
   a blue box (open)
     a whole bunch of blue pills
   a green canister (open)
     a whole bunch of green pills
   a Depth Charge Deluxe
   a game pamphlet
   a Canyonville High yearbook
   a collapsible hula hoop
   a skirt-and-sweater combo (being worn)

 Mary Jane cuts a slice from the pie in front of her.

>give depth charge to mary jane

 "No, thank you!"

 Mary Jane puts a forkful of pie in her mouth.

>put pill in pie

 Which do you mean, the whole bunch of blue pills or the whole bunch of
 green pills?

>examine blue pills

 You see nothing special about the whole bunch of blue pills.

 Mary Jane looks throughtful. Slowly, she takes another bite of pie and
 chews it carefully.

>put blue pill in pie

 Which do you mean, the gruesome glowing pie or the row of delicious
 pies?

>delicious pies

 You shake a blue pill into your hand.

 You discreetly tuck the blue pill beneath the crust of the next pie
 down from Mary Jane. Soon enough, she's picking it up, cutting a
 slice, and stuffing it cheerfully into her face. Nothing much happens,
 though. If you're trying to fatten her up, the pie is probably already
 doing a good enough job on its own.

 Mary Jane murmurs something to one of her Pine Nut Ladies-In-Waiting,
 who writes it down on a clipboard.

>put green pill in delicious pie

 You shake a green pill into your hand.

 You discreetly tuck the green pill beneath the crust of the next pie
 down from Mary Jane. Soon enough, she's picking it up, cutting a
 slice, and stuffing it cheerfully into her face. A moment later, you
 hear the muffled <span class="floydstyle em">whumpf</span> of a giant SLIM-U sponge blowing up
 in her stomach like a life raft trapped in a coffee can. Mary Jane
 grimaces and puts a hand to her abdomen. "Oof..." she moans, "I
 think...maybe...that's enough pie for today."

 Surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting, Mary Jane rushes off, looking
 pale.

>take glowing pie

 You heft the gruesome glowing pie. Not only have you saved Mary Jane
 from biting into a major yuckaroo, you've now got a piece of evidence
 about the creatures!

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Blue Ribbon Pie Tasting</span>
 This tent is filled with the absolutely scrumptious scent of freshly
 baked pies. Several long tables are laden with dozens of entries
 competing for the blue-ribbon prize.

 You can see a row of delicious pies and a pink purse (empty) here.

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 direction but southwest or south.

 You can't go that way.

 the exit, south to the Tomorrow Pavilion, and north to the annual
 Judging of the Pies.

 You can see Deputy Wilcox here.

>talk to deputy


 [Picture number 8 here.]

 "Well, hi there", the young deputy says. "Hope we can put all that
 business this morning behind us. As long as you're here for good clean
 fun, you're welcome at Pine Nut Days.  Miss...Noodleman, wasn't it?

 1) "Deputy Wilcox!  The town is in terrible danger

 "First it's monsters, now it's bears?" The deputy shakes his head.
 "Look, I can't get my uncle on the radio, and now mysterious gigantic,
 jiggling folks in trenchcoats have been spotted in the area! They
 could be spies for Khrushchev, or for rival towns with competing pine
 nut-based festivals. So you've just gotta excuse me, but I've got
 bigger fish to fry."

 1) "Please! Your uncle wouldn't listen to me, but I know you're the
 better man. I know you won't ignore your duty!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Please! Your uncle wouldn't listen to me, but I know you're the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">better man. I know you won't ignore your duty!"]</span>

 "Well, it's true Unk could be a little lazy on days ending with 'y'. I
 tell you what--I'll investigate this, and I'll do it nice and
 thorough."

 1) "Oh, thank goodness! All your uncle did was sit around and wait for
 me to bring him a piece of evidence."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Oh, thank goodness! All your uncle did was sit around and wait</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for me to bring him a piece of evidence."]</span>

 The deputy shakes his head. "I love the man, but he doesn't exactly
 like to sweat. I'd never sit around and wait for just one piece of
 evidence. I'm gonna need to look at at least three good ones before
 taking action. You find me three things that demonstrate that
 something weird and out of the ordinary is going on, I'll have no
 choice but to believe you."

 1) "Look at this pie.  It's unnatural!"
 2) "That's all I've got right now."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Look at this pie.  It's unnatural!"]</span>

 "Hmm. That certainly is an unpleasant looking pie." Deputy Wilcox
 looks more closely at the pulsating pastry. "I don't think any woman
 in this town could or would bake such a monstrosity!"

 1) "That's all I've got right now."

 A sudden eruption of ear-splitting demands for candy is followed,
 moments later, by an exhausted-looking woman towing a red-faced,
 shrieking little boy.  The noise persists for some time as she drags
 him off in the direction of the exit.

>examine deputy

 Buck Wilcox's nephew, a slim, brown-haired kid no more than twenty. He
 really cares about upholding the law, and more than that, making sure
 Canyonville is a nice place to live. His hobbies include planting
 trees and then getting cats out of them.

 An unattended dog thumps into your shin as it runs past, panting in
 the warm weather. It disappears into a forest of legs.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midway Games</span>
 Rows of games line the midway here, creating a noisy, colorful passage
 between the town square center to the west and a gloomy-looking
 haunted house ride to the south. The most prominent booth is a
 shooting gallery containing several rows of ducks and a BB gun.

 A carny slouches against the booth.

>examine carny

 Gosh, he sure looks like an awful shady customer!

>talk to carny


 [Picture number 7 here.]

 The carny looks you over. "Well, who's this raven-haired beauty? Looks
 a little like me at that age. Better hope that don't work the other
 way around, huh? Look, I'm kiddin', kid, relax, that's a joke. But
 seriously, you gonna give my games a shot or ain't ya?

 1) "Who are you?"

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Who are you?"]</span>

 "I'm Barney. Barney the Carny. Who are you, Quizzy the Question Girl?
 C'mon, I got prizes here. Broads dig prizes."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["What's your game, Barney?"]</span>

 "I gotta shooting gallery, mostly. You shoot BBs at ducks usin' that
 gun. If you win, you pick up this beauty!" He holds up a trophy. It's
 made of some kind of strange metal that radiates a sickly yellow-green
 glow.

 1) "That glow! That metal--that can help me prove what's going on!
 Please! I really, really need that!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["That glow! That metal--that can help me prove what's going on!</span>

>play game

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>take bb gun

 As you pick up the gun, a cheery tune begins playing, and the booth is
 awash in light. With a grinding kachunk the ducks begin moving.

 1) Get ready...

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Get ready...]</span>

 A tin duck zips across the gallery!

 1) Shoot it with the BB gun.
 2) Shoot it with the cosmic ray gun.

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Shoot it with the BB gun.]</span>

 You fire the gun at the ducks. Pow! Plink! Pop! You miss them all as
 the shots veer widely off course from anywhere you aimed. Why, you're
 lucky you didn't put somebody's eye out!  The carny laughs at you.
 "Hey, better luck next time, kid".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Haunted Porch</span>
 You're standing on the porch of a creepy haunted house. From inside,
 you can hear tinny recordings of booming laughter and creaking hinges.
 A small car rests on a track. A noisy midway lies to the north, and a
 glittering, futuristic pavilion to the west.

 An elegantly lettered sign has been nailed to the front door.

 You can also see a glass case (closed) (in which is a tombstone) and a
 small car here.

>examine sign

 This crisply painted black and white sign bears the following text:

  "NOTICE:

 Due to the high levels of bone-chilling fear generated by this
 terrifying ride, management is pleased to offer this complimentary
 tombstone to any fairgoer who dies of fright while within the haunted
 house."

>examine tombstone

 It's made out of some kind of yellow-green crystalline substance
 that's glowing faintly. You've never seen a gem that looks quite like
 it. The rough, primal surface has been marred with a crude carving
 reading "Your Name Here? MWA HA HA"

>shoot glass

 The ray passes right through it. Darn glass!

>open case

 There doesn't seem to be any way to cheat and open it yourself.

>get in car

 You hop into the car, which rolls forward into the haunted house. A
 metal cuff snaps shut around your wrist. What an experience! The
 laziness and lack of attention to detail on the part of the staff is
 truly TERRIFYING! The implications of this shoddy workmanship, when
 you consider the importance of the American work ethic to beating the
 Russians, are enough to fill you with BONE-CHILLING FRIGHT! However,
 you don't actually die. As the car creaks its way past the last
 cardboard tombstone and into the light, the cuff on your wrist
 squeezes and a hidden heart monitor beeps. "Ah, a heartbeat! You've
 managed to survive!" a recorded voice chortles tinnily, "...THIS
 TIME!"

 The car reaches the end of the track and stops with a jolt before
 letting you back out onto the porch.

 "Hello I am W.I.F.E. (Wireless Intelligent Female, Electronic),
 another fine product of Minsystems Labs and your guide to the Wonders
 of Tomorrow! You can ask me about any part of the pavilion to learn
 more. As this prototype lacks a number of our exciting upcoming
 features such as social analysis and reaction diodes, for purposes of
 this demonstration I will be assuming that you are an affluent
 middle-aged man named Dave Johnson who is interested in purchasing me

 one-hundred-forty miles per hour when dragged at high speed along a
 magnetic track by specially designed robots. The Car of Tomorrow is
 capable of running on unrefined oil and blocks of shale, has
 high-quality Texture-Tronic plastic seating for up to ten people,
 boasts Drive-Rite Suspension and foot-powered Auto-Stop braking

 dripping with glowing goop. More screams. Festival-goers are starting
 to panic. The calm before the storm is over--the Brain Guzzlers are
 making their move!

 1) "Deputy Wilcox! You're the law here. Do something!"
 2) "Mary Jane! Your people need you now more than ever.  It's time to
 show you're a real Pine Nut Queen!"

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Mary Jane! Your people need you now more than ever.  It's time</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to show you're a real Pine Nut Queen!"]</span>

 Mary Jane looks at you with wild eyes. "Are you bonkers?" she
 screeches. "I abdicate!"

 The lead Brain Guzzler--at least, it's the one in front--stretches one
 tentacle over to the Tomorrow Pavilion, picks up the Car of Tomorrow,
 and pitches it at you like a javelin. Deputy Wilcox drops backwards
 into the dirt, knocking you and Mary Jane down next to him. You watch
 the Undercarriage of Tomorrow sail overhead and hear the car smash
 into the midway with a sound of splintering wood and the clang of
 steel on tin.

 "Huh," the deputy says. "Bit ornery. Just ta be safe, I think you
 ladies oughtta make for the designated shelter area in Harding Tunnel.
 I'll come and get ya once these fellas an' I--"  He ducks as an I-beam
 nearly decapitates him. "--have had a bit of a palaver."

 1) Run away!

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Run away!]</span>

 You pelt down Main Street at top speed as Mary Jane struggles to keep
 up barefoot, having lost her high heels back at the fair. The screams
 of the festivalgoers echo down the empty street like water gurgling
 down a pipe. Wait and observe--set a few traps--then wait for everyone
 to gather in one place...those aliens have got to be smarter than the
 mindless blobs they look like. No wonder they're so fond of brains.

 As you reach the Saguaro Road intersection, you stop short. Mary Jane
 lets out another ear-splitting shriek.  It looks like the monsters
 weren't counting on everyone being at the fair after all.  One of them
 is oozing in from the north, two more from the west, and the biggest
 one yet is slobbering in from the south like a tidal wave of
 yellow-green goop. You're surrounded! You back away as the guzzlers
 close in.

 "Gotcha!" hisses a voice, and something warm and slimy closes around
 your wrist.

 1) Swing around and punch that monster square in the snoot!
 2) Scream for help and try to pull away.

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Swing around and punch that monster square in the snoot!]</span>

 You whirl around, swinging your free hand in a wide arc, and end up
 punching Renee on the side of her head. "Ow!" she grunts, more
 startled than hurt--nobody ever accused you of being overly
 strong--and staggers back, just in time for you to lose your balance
 and topple forward into the diner, dragging Renee down with you. You
 both end up splayed on the linoleum. She shoves you off and struggles
 to her feet long enough to drag Mary Jane through the door, slam it
 shut, and throw the deadbolt.

 "You see them too, right?" she says, turning to you. "I'm not crazy?
 They're really here?"

 1) "Yes, and golly, are they ever dangerous, and they're no dummies,
 either! We're in such a deep pickle right now!"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Yes, and golly, are they ever dangerous, and they're no dummies,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">either! We're in such a deep pickle right now!"]</span>

 Renee sighs. "Be careful what you wish for, I guess. Listen--I don't
 think they know I'm in here. We can hole up for a while if we have to.
 Might get pretty sick of burgers, but as long as we don't alert
 them--"

 Mary Jane lets out an ear-splitting shriek that nearly snaps your last
 nerve. You can't see anything in the diner, but Mary Jane just keeps
 screaming and bawling.

 1) "Shhh!"
 2) Grab her and put your hand over her mouth.
 3) Give her a good hard slap!

>3

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Give her a good hard slap!]</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Crakk!</span>

 Mary Jane blinks.  "You--you <span class="floydstyle em">hit</span> me!" she says, looking more
 surprised than hurt.

 "We'll all get a lot worse than a baby slap from flipping Bonnie
 Noodleman if you don't cut that out!" Renee hisses. "What on Earth is
 wrong with you?"

 Mary Jane holds out her arm, which is smeared with red. "I'm bleeding.
 I think--I think I'm dying!"

 Renee rolls her eyes. "That's <span class="floydstyle em">beef juice</span>, you dip. I was in
 the middle of making patties when I grabbed you. Now quiet down and
 hope to God that they didn't just hear--"

 A tentacle smashes through the front window, covering the diner in
 broken glass and goo. Mary Jane lets out another piercing scream. Even
 Renee makes a strangled squeak.

 1) "Run for it!"
 2) "We have to fight!"

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["We have to fight!"]</span>

 Renee nods at you. "Right," she says, "help me pull up these stools.
 We'll go back to back."

 "Wh-what about me?" Mary Jane sniffles.

 "Just try not to knock either of us down when you faint."

 Waves of ooze begin slopping over the broken windowsill and slithering
 purposefully across the floor towards you. Renee kicks at one, but
 it's like stepping in a mud puddle--she almost loses a sneaker.

 "We can't fight this stuff!" she moans. "We've gotta retreat. Out the
 back on three?"

 1) (nod) "One..."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[(nod) "One..."]</span>

 The fryer suddenly explodes in a shower of grease and goo as a
 half-fried tentacle forces its way through the wall, reaching for you
 with ropy strands of sizzling, popping slime. "Twothreegogogo!" Renee
 shouts as the three of you scurry to the backdoor.  The diner roof
 collapses behind you under several tons of hungry brain guzzler,
 sending up a cloud of plaster dust.

 You crash through the back door and sprint desperately for the
 sidewalk. The monsters are everywhere now, tentacles questing in every
 direction, but you somehow avoid them, ducking, dodging, even hurdling
 one of the smaller ones. You head north. There don't seem to be as
 many along Saguaro. You can hear the girls breathing heavily on either
 side of you. You all made it! Now if you can just reach the tunnel--

 Like a green landslide, a brain guzzler the size of a house slides
 down the slope of Make-Out Mountain, its surface a forest of
 tentacles.

 1) "Oh my gosh!"
 2) "Holy cow!"
 3) "Jeepers jipes!"
 4) You're so shocked, you actually say the f-word.

>4

 <span class="floydstyle em">[You're so shocked, you actually say the f-word.]</span>

 "FIDDLESTICKS!"

 You're petrified. It's huge. It's horrible. It's got to be the mother
 of all brain guzzlers. It's probably the one that ate Jimmy! Your feet
 feel like they're glued to the spot as a deep, primal fear bubbles up
 in your gut. Before you lies a sea of undulating goo, and the tide is
 coming in.

 Mary Jane passes you. She's screaming her head off, yes, but she's
 also actually<span class="floydstyle em"> moving </span>instead of standing like a statue. It's
 like having an ambulance drive past your ear, and somehow it breaks
 the spell.  You run.

 The three of you stagger through the entrance of the tunnel, a tidal
 wave of slime following you. A tentacle the size of a redwood slams
 into the cliffside. You can hear rock shattering and falling. Another
 tentacle. Another crash. The tunnel is collapsing!

 You run forward into the darkness until you can no longer hear the
 sound of tumbling rocks. "Everyone--okay?" Renee gasps.  Mary Jane
 whimpers. You check yourself over. You might have dropped a few of the
 things you were carrying back there somewhere, but you're not bleeding
 and nothing seems to be broken.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Harding Tunnel</span>
 A cool, damp road beneath the mountain. Only a couple of the lights
 here work, and their dim yellow glow reflects off the slick concrete

 You can see a heavy steel grate set into the wall here.

 Renee Finch is lying flat on her back, recovering.

 looking miserable.

 Mary Jane looks up at you, her eyes ringed with red. "I can't believe

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pool of Light</span>
 A police car has skidded and crashed into the side of the tunnel here,
 its lights filling the surrounding blackness with harsh flashes of red
 and blue. You can see the dimly-lit tunnel continuing to the
 southwest. Northeast and further in is nothing but pitch darkness.

>go northeast

 Jeepers, there could be anything down there! Wandering off into the
 darkness is just how they got Jimmy.

>examine car

 It looks like the driver lost control of the vehicle. The front end is
 completely smashed, but you can probably still get the car open if you
 want to. About all you can make out inside is a vaguely human shape
 slumped over the wheel.

>open car

 You grab the handle and pull as hard as you can. At first it seems to
 be jammed, but with a little effort and a few terribly unladylike
 grunts that you're glad nobody heard, you manage to swing it open.
 Flopped across the steering wheel like a boneless goose is the body of
 Buck Wilcox. That is...<span class="floydstyle em">most</span> of it. His brain is gone. It's
 been taken! No...<span class="floydstyle em">guzzled!!</span>
>search wilcox

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine wilcox

 Even Officer Wilcox didn't deserve to die like this! The one
 consolation is that his brain appears to have been pulled out through
 his ear <span class="floydstyle em">before</span> the car hit the wall, so at least he didn't
 suffer. He's been splattered by that greenish-yellow goo the Brain
 Guzzlers leave everywhere, and you spot a few flecks of something
 solid in it. On closer inspection, they appear to be fragments of
 eggshell.

 She's examining the grate.

 "Hey, Bonnie. I think we can get this grate off if we all pull
 together. Give me a hand, huh?"

 1) "Let me look around a little more first."
 2) "Sure!  Let's do it!"

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Sure!  Let's do it!"]</span>

 "Great! Okay, on three. One. Two. THREE!" You and Renee pull on the
 grate as hard as you can, but it doesn't come loose. "We could use a
 little help here, <span class="floydstyle em">your highness,</span>" Renee hisses through
 clenched teeth. Mary Jane stands up, a little sullenly, and grips the
 bars. Between the three of you, the grate shifts a little, then pulls
 free in a shower of loose pebbles and concrete dust, sending you
 sprawling across the asphalt.

 "Great," Renee says, standing up. "Okay, Miss Sharp Elbows, since I
 had the honor of cushioning your fall, you can have the honor of going
 up first."

 1) Up you go!

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Up you go!]</span>

 You scramble up the narrow vent. It's dark, hot, and a tight squeeze,
 but you can smell tobacco smoke from somewhere above you, and hear a
 scratchy Perry Como record playing, so at least they've got the basics
 of civilization up there. The others follow you in. After more
 climbing than you want to think about, you come to another grate in
 the side of the vent.

 1) Take a little peek through the grate.
 2) Push the grate open.

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Take a little peek through the grate.]</span>

 Through the slats of the grate, you can see a pleasant modernist
 living room. The music is coming from a Hi-Fi set next to a
 comfortable-looking leather easy chair.

 Renee taps your foot. "Um, Bonnie? Why are we stopping?"

 1) "I think we're about to break into someone's house."
 2) Push the grate open.

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["I think we're about to break into someone's house."]</span>

 "Yeah, well, unless you want to go back to just sitting on our butts
 being buried alive until we're starving, and then arm-wrestle me to
 find out which of us gets to eat Mary Jane, I think we're gonna have
 to live with it."

 1) Push the grate open.

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Push the grate open.]</span>

 You push the grate out into the room and slide out into a
 comfortable-looking living room lined with bookshelves and lit by a
 collection of Tiffany lamps. Renee emerges next, and whistles. "Nice
 place. Especially for the inside of a mountain."

 Mary Jane slides out of the hole. "Thank you," she says politely, her
 voice cracking. "I p-picked the lamps myself. Now if you'll excuse
 me...I-think...I need some time alone. I'll just hop off t-to my
 room!"

 1) "Wait, Mary Jane, is this <span class="floydstyle em">your</span> house?"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Wait, Mary Jane, is this your</span> house?"]

 She nods.  "H-help yourself to anything in the ki--ki--kitchen!"

 With a wail, Mary Jane rushes off to the northwest, her eyes wet and
 her face white as a sheet. You see a brief glimpse of a room festooned
 with ruffles and pink before the door slams behind her.

 "My word!"  the professor says, looking up. "A survivor!  So the
 townsfolk haven't been entirely wiped out after all. Mary Jane will be
 thrilled one of you made it. She's always been more at ease with the
 hoi polloi."

 1) "I'm not the only survivor."

 "Gee, Professor, I'm not the only one who made it past the Brain
 Guzzlers. There's me, Bonnie Noodleman--and my friend Renee--and Mary
 Jane is back, too, safe and sound!"

 The professor blinks. "Back? What do you mean?"

 "Well, wasn't she at the festival? As the Pine Nut Queen?"

 "Nonsense!" he scoffs. "I've devoted my life to the pursuit of
 science, as has my daughter. I've strictly forbidden her to waste her
 intellect on all this populist fiddle-faddle. Go ahead; check her room
 if you don't believe me."

 "You see? Right where she should be." The professor peers at you.

 "Fascinating question! Our best guess, based on the approach vector of

 <span class="floydstyle em">["And just how does this 'BUBU' thingamajig work?"]</span>

 "Perspicacious question, Miss Noodleman. The BUBU, or 'Brain-Utilizing
 Brain-Unguzzler', is an atomically powered device which uses radiation
 waves to reverse the magnetic flux of any material which originates
 from outer space, essentially using the Brain Guzzlers' own biological
 energy against them. Of course, every child has done the simple
 experiment in which water is slowly heated until a frog is boiled
 alive without even thinking to hop out of the pan. Now imagine the
 frog and the pan were on opposite ends of a table, and yet by making
 folds in the fabric, we could bring them together without the frog
 needing to pass over the entire tablecloth. That's essentially the
 principle the BUBU uses, minus the frog, of course." He sighs. "Or
 rather, it's the principle that it <span class="floydstyle em">would</span> use if I had all the
 parts I needed."

 He wheels out a blackboard. "The components listed here are...the bulk
 of what's required. Feel free to take a look at it when we're done

 Micro-Mini Computer
 Brain Guzzler DNA Sample
 Purified Fructonium

 You carefully jot down the components on a sheet of loose-leaf paper.
 Now you can keep track of what you've got and what you need to find.
 It sure does feel swell to be neat and organized!

 "Excellent!" the Professor notes. "I suppose I'll have to risk opening
 the internal security shutters so you can search the house.
 Fortunately this facility remains completely impregnable from the

 You jiggle the handle. It's locked! You can hear Mary Jane playing
 marching band music at high volume on the other side.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hall of Amazing Advances</span>
 A long arched hallway of frosted glass running east and west.  The
 light of sunset tinges the serene blue of the carpet with orange and
 gold. The room is lined with displays, each featuring another
 brilliant MinSystems invention--two especially impressive ones are the
 weapons display and the transportation display. Heavy glass doors lead
 into the main MinSystems offices to the east, while a cozy foyer at
 the other end of the hall leads to the Minskys' private home.

>examine transportation display

 This display details "a brilliant advance in remote delivery
 technology." It contains a white pod which looks something like a
 giant egg.

>examine weapons display

 The display concerns a "multi-target disintegration device" designed
 for a "wide range of military and civilian uses" known as the "RPS
 Cannon."  A prototype of the cannon is propped up, aiming at a paper
 target hanging from the ceiling.

 A large, egg-shaped pod about the size of a garbage can, but

 You open the telepod, revealing a spork.

   a spork
   a telepod (open but empty)
   a RPS cannon
   a checklist
   a Depth Charge Deluxe

 A neat little copy of the checklist on the blackboard, which you can
 use to keep track of the BUBU components you still need to give to the

 You brace your legs against the sides of the vent and descend in a
 controlled slide.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Harding Tunnel</span>
 A cool, damp road beneath the mountain. Only a couple of the lights
 here work, and their dim yellow glow reflects off the slick concrete

 northeast, you can see blue and red lights flashing in the darkness.
 There's an open exhaust vent in the wall here, leading UP.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pool of Light</span>
 A police car has skidded and crashed into the side of the tunnel here,
 its lights filling the surrounding blackness with harsh flashes of red

 southwest. Northeast and further in is nothing but pitch darkness.

>look in car

 In the police car are some fragments of eggshell and a body.

>take eggshell

 You pick them off of his clothing. There's a big clump of them near
 his feet, too.  You've got almost the whole shell, now. Good for you,
 Bonnie! Helping Mother in the kitchen really paid off!

 Even Officer Wilcox didn't deserve to die like this! The one

 You open the doors a crack. An oozing tentacle shoots towards you! You
 quickly slam the door and throw the emergency lock. Your brief
 glimpses of the offices were enough to tell you they're totally
 overrun with Brain Guzzlers--you're not getting out that way!

>examine cannon

 A sleek, futuristic gun with three brass barrels. It's bulky and looks
 powerful, but it's light enough to hold in one hand. There's a dial
 you can turn on the side under a display. Currently the display is
 showing an image of a hand with the index and middle fingers extended,
 like a sideways peace sign.

 You see nothing special about the dial.

 "Hey, Bonnie." Renee smiles tiredly. "That was a heck of a thing.  Now

 other places, too, do you?  It was just so...I was...I was at the
 diner, like always. I was in the middle of making hamburgers for
 crying out loud!"

 She wipes a smudge of dirt off of her cheek. "That diner was--I lived
 there. I worked there every--every day. And now it's just--it didn't
 even take them two minutes to tear that place up.  Like it was
 nothing."

 that night has fallen. The open road before you leads into darkness.
 What could be out there?  Can Canyonville still be saved?

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Harding Tunnel</span>
 A cool, damp road beneath the mountain. Only a couple of the lights
 here work, and their dim yellow glow reflects off the slick concrete
 walls. The roads continues, exiting the tunnel to the southwest. To
 the northeast, you can see blue and red lights flashing in the
 darkness. There's an open exhaust vent in the wall here, leading UP.

>se

 You can't go that way.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Harding Tunnel Entrance</span>
 From here, the road plunges northeast into the sheer cliffs and curves
 gently southwest towards town. Twisted-looking pines frame the tunnel
 entrance itself, which is pitch black and smells moist and alive. Far
 above you, you can see the sleek modernist wedge of Minsystems Labs
 perched at the edge of the cliffs.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Saguaro 300 Block</span>
 You're standing on Saguaro Road, in a part of town your mother doesn't
 like you going. A junkyard squats to the west, and to the east, an old
 barn has been painted black and blue and hung with a neon sign reading
 "The Beat Barn." A dirt road leads north to the drive-in, and Saguaro
 Road itself heads into town to the south and curves northeast into the
 woods.

 The neon sign is lit up, casting a harsh blue glow over the asphalt.

>go east

 The doorman turns up his pointy nose at the obvious square, but waves
 you inside anyway, muttering something about quail hunting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Beat Barn</span>
 A smoky little hole in the wall filled with customers dressed in black
 and sipping coffee from tiny cups.  Scratchy jazz is playing softly in
 the background. A low stage is along one wall.

 On the stage is Traudl Brandt.

 You can also see a beatnik bodyguard here.

>examine traudl

 You've heard of her. She has a reputation, and not even a normal
 reputation, like girls who just park a little, but a really, really
 bad one--as in, she's <span class="floydstyle em">European</span>, and she's not even shy about
 it! She's your age, but looks older, probably from fast living and a
 steady diet of coffee and funny-smelling cigarettes.  She's wearing a
 clingy black leotard than matches her unkempt hair. In her lap rests a
 lump of white plastic you recognize as the head of the Wife of
 Tomorrow.

>examine talk to traudl

 (That's not one of the available props in this scene.)

>examine head of the wife

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the Head of the
 Wife of Tomorrow.

>examine head wife

 It looks slightly melted, but still in one piece.

>listen to traudl

 You hear nothing unexpected.

>talk to traudel

 (That's not one of the available props in this scene.)

>talk to traudl

 She probably won't be able to hear you over all these deep
 philosophical conversations unless you get up on the stage.

>examine stage

 Long and low and mostly bare, the stage is the only brightly lit part
 of the room.

 On the stage is Traudl Brandt.

>get on stage

 The beatnik bodyguard pulls you away from the stage.  "Like, no
 hassling the talent, dig?" It doesn't look like you'll be able to get
 up there while he's watching the room.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a telepod (open but empty)
   a RPS cannon
   a checklist
   a Depth Charge Deluxe
   a game pamphlet
   a Canyonville High yearbook
   a collapsible hula hoop
   a skirt-and-sweater combo (being worn)

>use hula hoop

 You use the hula hoop. Fun! Then it falls down around your ankles.

>show hula hoop to bodyguard

 The beatnik bodyguard is unimpressed.

>get on stage

 The beatnik bodyguard pulls you away from the stage.  "Like, no
 hassling the talent, dig?" It doesn't look like you'll be able to get
 up there while he's watching the room.

>examine bodyguard

 The rough customer could be the doorman's burlier brother. He's
 peering at you with a suspicious squint, probably watching to make
 sure you don't square up the place. His immense hands grip a teeny
 tiny itty bitty little cup of coffee.

>examine cup

 The beatnik sees you eyeing the thimble-sized cup and puts a hand over
 it. "Like, no sharing, you dig? This has to last me all night and once
 it's gone it's like real gone, man." He yawns. "Like, they don't dig a
 man needs the bounty of the brown goddess poured out upon him just to
 stay in awake in this red onion of a coffeehouse. So what if it runs
 through me like a cool cat's lead sled through Squaresville, man?
 That's, like, what the porcelain birdbath is for, dig?"

 You scrabble back up the dark exhaust vent.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Modernist Living Room</span>
 This circular room is ultramodern, like something from twenty years in
 the future. The sleek, smart-looking furniture is a symphony in
 avocado, orange, and mustard-yellow. There are exits set into the
 wooden paneling to the southwest and northwest, and another exit past
 a small entry foyer to the east. A spiral staircase leads up, and a
 gaping exhaust vent leads down.

 Renee Finch is plopped in a comfortable-looking easy chair, leafing
 through a leather-bound book.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tomorrowdome</span>
 A dome covers the roof of the laboratory, converting this top floor
 into a vast circular workspace with a view of the surrounding
 mountains  beneath a sky full of brilliant stars. In the center of the
 room is some sort of half-completed machine. Near it is a cluttered
 desk, with a blackboard looming over it.

 Professor Barrabas Rudolph Minsky is up to his elbows in the machine,
 tinkering away.

 On the cluttered desk is an enormous coffee mug.

 As you push the door open, the goatee-wearing doorman stops you,
 sniffing the air.  "Coffee!" he declares. "You've got coffee!  Thought
 you'd sneak in your own bourgeoisie slop, huh? You leave that paint

 A huge coffee mug brimming with steaming, fresh-roasted coffee.  It's
 gigantic! You could probably keep fish in here without them feeling
 cramped in the least, although they might have other problems. "The
 Doctor Said I Had To Cut Down To One Cup A Day" is printed on the
 side, so maybe it started off as a gag gift.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Awkward Conversations with Unsavory Strangers: Fifty Perfect</span>

 The beatnik eagerly takes the huge mug of coffee. "Now that's where
 it's at! Maybe you're not such a square after all." He guzzles down
 the coffee thirstily. "Like that really hit the spot, doll--I--" He
 looks sudden distressed. "Like, gotta beat the gravel, like,

 The desperate beatnik runs off in the direction of, like, the

 "What, this? It came crashing through the bathroom window about an
 hour ago. I figured the morally upright citizens of this perfect
 little burg were showing us their small-town hospitality in brick form
 again, but this one's different. Some kind of sculpture--I like it.  I
 think I'll keep it."  She laughs.  "But tell you what.  If I knew
 you'd appreciate it as much as I do, I might let you borrow it. Why
 not?  Let's write a piece together. Awaken the poet's soul that dwells
 within you, and it's yours."

 Several members of the audience are laughing now. Traudl's sallow

 "Enough, enough, enough! Obviously, you don't have the soul of a poet
 at all. You have the soul of--of--"

 She sputters out an unflattering-sounding German word and stalks off.
 After two circuits of the room, several cigarettes and a torrent of
 Teutonic muttering, she seems to realize that she's accidentally left
 her little wooden fiefdom to you and hurries back to the stage.
 "Here--you wanted this, right?  I will give you this if you never try

 She hands you the Head of the Wife of Tomorrow, and the precious

 You're standing on Saguaro Road, in a part of town your mother doesn't
 like you going. A junkyard squats to the west, and to the east, an old
 barn has been painted black and blue and hung with a neon sign reading
 "The Beat Barn." A dirt road leads north to the drive-in, and Saguaro
 Road itself heads into town to the south and curves northeast into the
 woods.

 The neon sign is lit up, casting a harsh blue glow over the asphalt.

 A neat little copy of the checklist on the blackboard, which you can
 use to keep track of the BUBU components you still need to give to the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Harding Tunnel Entrance</span>
 From here, the road plunges northeast into the sheer cliffs and curves
 gently southwest towards town. Twisted-looking pines frame the tunnel
 entrance itself, which is pitch black and smells moist and alive. Far
 above you, you can see the sleek modernist wedge of Minsystems Labs
 perched at the edge of the cliffs.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Harding Tunnel</span>
 A cool, damp road beneath the mountain. Only a couple of the lights
 here work, and their dim yellow glow reflects off the slick concrete
 walls. The roads continues, exiting the tunnel to the southwest. To
 the northeast, you can see blue and red lights flashing in the
 darkness. There's an open exhaust vent in the wall here, leading UP.

>go up

 You scrabble back up the dark exhaust vent.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Modernist Living Room</span>
 This circular room is ultramodern, like something from twenty years in

 avocado, orange, and mustard-yellow. There are exits set into the
 wooden paneling to the southwest and northwest, and another exit past
 a small entry foyer to the east. A spiral staircase leads up, and a
 gaping exhaust vent leads down.

 Renee Finch is plopped in a comfortable-looking easy chair, leafing
 through a leather-bound book.

 "She's certainly seen better days, but as strange as it may sound,
 this is one 'wife' whose most important job isn't looking good." The
 professor cracks open the Head of the Wife of Tomorrow and yanks out a
 handfull of circuits and wires. "Now, I just connect these
 here--and--"

 The speaker on the BUBU's control panel crackles into fuzzy life.
 "Hello? Dave? What's going on? I feel so--so sluggish and
 thick-waisted!  What's happening?"

 "Don't worry your pretty little tubes about it, my dear," the
 professor says soothingly. "Later on I may need you to kill a few
 aliens, but for now, just lie there and let me work on you."

 "A spa day! Gosh, Dave, you sure know how to make a wife feel

 <span class="floydstyle em">["She's alive, and she's just about worried sick about you!"]</span>

 "She is?"  Jenny's face lights up. "Oh, thank goodness! I'm been--I've
 been going just about nuts imagining all kinds of horrible things.
 Where is she? I have to find her!"

 1) "She's safe at home.  Uh, you sort of have to shimmy up an air vent
 to get in--"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["She's safe at home.  Uh, you sort of have to shimmy up an air</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">vent to get in--"]</span>

 "Oh yes, I've been up that vent before." Jenny notices your
 expression. "What? She's got a ten o' clock curfew. It's ridiculous!
 Listen, I, uh, I really can't thank you enough for telling me this. I
 need to see her right now."

 1) "Gee, let's get back to the lab, then."

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Gee, let's get back to the lab, then."]</span>

 You and Jenny enjoy what is by current standards a relaxing walk back
 to the lab, during which neither of you dies. Soon you're standing at
 the door of Mary Jane's room.

 "We have a secret knock," Jenny explains, which turns out to be two
 barely audible taps.  "See, it stands for 'haircut', because at first
 it was going to be 'shave and a haircut' because we get our hair done
 together sometimes but we don't shave, or, er, at least we don't shave
 at a barbershop or anything like that, uh, so we dropped that part--"

 The door jerks open and Mary Jane launches herself at Jenny like a
 puffy-eyed pink cobra.  "Jenny!  You're ALIVE!" she squeals. "I
 thought your poor little brain had been guzzled!"

 "I thought yours had!"

 After the tearful reunion, Mary Jane turns to you. "Well, gosh, now I
 feel like a real goony bird for crying over Jenny dying when she's not
 even dead. I ought to be pitching in and helping you and Dad stop
 those awful things. I'm going to the lab to see what's what!"

 Jenny gives her a peck on the cheek. "Have fun!" Then you and Mary
 Jane climb the stairs to the Tomorrowdome.

 "Oh, it's a BUBU," Mary Jane observes, grabbing a lab coat. "Or, well,
 gee, it's most of one at least. I can make it better!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tomorrowdome</span>
 A dome covers the roof of the laboratory, converting this top floor
 into a vast circular workspace with a view of the surrounding
 mountains  beneath a sky full of brilliant stars. In the center of the
 room is some sort of half-completed machine. Near it is a cluttered
 desk, with a blackboard looming over it.

 Mary Jane Minsky is working on the BUBU.

 Professor Barrabas Rudolph Minsky is up to his elbows in the machine,
 tinkering away.

 The BUBU giggles. "Gosh, Dave, your hands are so tickley inside me!"

 Jenny frowns, looking at the tubes. "Of course they're not ripe, poor
 things! They may look healthy, but they're all alone up here, stuck to
 a dumb old wall. If there's one thing I've learned it's that even if
 they have all the food and water they need plants will never be happy
 if they feel neglected. They need people to love them. They need
 people to talk to them! Openly! You can't just tell plants you love
 them and then run off with your popular friends every afternoon while
 they're stuck working in the shop. I mean being sold in the shop.
 Being sold is like the flowers' job, that's why I said it like that."

 some attention would help."

 "Now look," you tell the plant sternly. "Maybe you're a plant. And
 maybe you're not worried about the Brain Guzzlers because you don't
 have a brain, or even a nervous system, and so you don't think any of
 this has anything to do with you. But let me tell you this, buddy!
 You grew on American soil, or out of American water, anyway, and that
 makes you a citizen of the good old United States of America!
 Americans don't give up when the going gets tough. Americans fight.
 Americans win! Our country has never been successfully conquered by
 slime monsters from space and, gosh darn it, it's never going to be!
 Now you're going to get off your lazy roots, citizen, and you're going
 to start growing! And one day... one day, you magnificent son of a
 gun, little children who aren't yet a gleam in Father's eye will
 salute the everloving heck out your memory!  There will be statues to
 you! People will look at still lifes and instead of saying 'Oh,
 another one of those', they'll stand a little taller. They'll wipe
 their eyes.  And they'll say, 'There, in that bowl, there lies a true
 American'. And then they'll go home and they'll have a gosh darn
 honest-to-mother barbeque with hamburgers and corn on the cob and yes,
 even fruit, and it will all be because of you!"

 cornucopia of ripe fruit!

 "spaceship." "May God have mercy on our souls," he says.

 Mary Jane gives you a kiss on the cheek.  "Good luck, Bonnie!" Then
 she taps a few buttons and the dome slowly opens overhead.  Machinery
 grinds as the BUBU rises into the air.

 A glittering sea of stars surrounds you. Below, you see the last
 flickering lights of Canyonville glinting off huge dark shapes. The
 town seems to undulate like an ocean of living ink. The few buildings
 you can see, in the scattered light from  fires and sparkling electric
 lines, aren't much more than shells. There's the ruins of the diner.
 Over there, the one remaining wall of the haunted house sways in the
 breeze. The last of the police station crumbles as you watch.

 From the south, a wave of Brain Guzzlers rolls over the line of tanks.
 You can hear faint shouts and bursts of futile gunfire. One enormous
 Guzzler is slowly oozing over the Beat Barn. Another probes the base
 of the cliff with its tendrils.

 "They look mean, Dave," the BUBU remarks, "but I was <span class="floydstyle em">made</span> to
 fight tough stains!

 With a terrifying crack, light lances from the tip of the BUBU,
 fingers of electricity raking the sky like crude scratches carved into
 filmstock .The Brain Guzzlers begin to quiver, then to shrivel,
 sputting into loose piles like deflating party balloons. In minutes,
 it is over. The string is pulled, and Canyonville's remaining brains
 will remain unguzzled.

 "You did it!" a voice chirps from beneath you. You look down to see
 Mary Jane looking up at you, Jenny by her side, their hands clasped
 together and their hair whipped by the mountain wind.

 The professor stands behind them, staring thoughtfully off into some
 unknown future. "The way I see it," he muses, "we may never know why
 they came here, where they came from, or where they went. We may never
 know, and we may never be ready to know! All I know is that every year
