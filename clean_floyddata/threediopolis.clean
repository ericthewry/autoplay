 Threediopolis was the first city to have different sidewalk levels,
 one above another, back in 2050. It's pretty normal now in 2100, but
 they didn't plan everything right back then, so Threediopolis is still
 a bit quirky.

 You still get lost some days, like today--while remembering a
 traumatic episode from your youth (adults yelling at you for somehow
 getting lost on a simple errand) you run across a building you've
 never seen. You enter and are whisked to a penthouse office. A fellow
 wearing a fractal power-tie and a white button-down shirt with elbow
 patches jumps up.

 "Ah! You answered my online ad! What? No? You didn't? Even better!
 You're a natural! Unpoisoned by GPS! Just what I need! It's not anyone
 can find here. I'm Ed Dunn. You are? ..."
>press green


 Before you can answer, Ed hands you a list of tasks, an equally
 mysterious package you're told not to open, and a pocket teleporter
 device, for getting back if you get even more lost than you need to.

 "Getting here was the hard part, kid. But if you don't get everything
 on this list done before you get back here, that's okay."

 Before you can ask what list, Ed makes a hush-hush gesture. "It's
 organized by travel time, kid. Or it should be, once you find how to
 use it. Don't worry, just--don't lose it."

 He explains how some things just don't need to be traced
 electronically, and how there's lots of weird scenery to see if you're
 interested in that sort of thing, and since you got here without
 knowing, you couldn't get anywhere on the list WITH knowing.

 "Knowing what...?"

 "One other thing, kid. You might want to use that teleporter pretty
 quickly if you don't see anything to start. Say, no further than five
 blocks. Til you get your bearings."

 Ed stares at his computer, then snaps his fingers. "Oh, hey, I should
 push this button. Alphabetize this whole list, sort of. Make things
 easier for the rookie. What do you say?"
>say okay


 "Yes or no. Not rocket science."
>say no


 "C'mon, kid, you can't answer an easy yes-no question..."
>no


 "Got it. You look smart enough to take the extra challenge."

 Pep talk time. "You got potential. You seem like someone who knows
 it's not just getting there, but HOW you get there." You've heard that
 truism before...but does it mean anything? You have no time to ask.
 Security whisks you away as Ed booms "And keep with it. Note what you
 found. Don't worry about the order, either!"

 It's not a huge list. You even have addresses of where to go. It can't
 be too hard, can it?

 Hm, he said it was alphabetized, but you aren't sure yet what he was
 talking about.

 [You can put this in the header with t, though it is not recommended
 with Parchment, or you can toggle this warning with tt. You can also
 track just friends with f, or you can see one line with o.]

 You think a moment. Some of these locations listed twice, there has to
 be something if you just walk right there. Especially the ones nearby.

>b


 Threediopolis is now in its "superbrief" mode, which always gives
 short descriptions of locations (even if you haven't been there
 before).

>about


 This game wasn't intended to be huge on plot, but rather, I saw a way
 to do things, and I figured why not. I put the skeleton on the shelf
 after starting it in May 2012, toyed with it for a post-IFComp 2012
 release, then got so lazy I saw I could submit it in time for IFComp
 2013!

 Type CREDITS for testers and such.

 A previous IFComp game that might spoil this game's mechanic also
 probably had considerable influence on this game, though it does have
 a lot more plot and cool locations.

 I hope you enjoy this. I recognize some people won't, and that's cool,
 and I don't want to play the "I know some philistines may hate it"
 card. However, if it helps someone who doesn't like it try their
 <span class="floydstyle em">own</span> thing, that'd be way cool.

 Also, remember to track back to puzzles you couldn't solve after
 getting a few others. They may be easier.

 Being a messenger, you don't have much more to do than go in the six
 basic directions (transport tubes make going up and down easy.) Or
 enter places. Maybe knock. Nothing fancy. Type C to see everything.

>c


 The six directions, abbreviated: N, S, E, W, U, D. K knocks. I/IN goes
 in (inventory doesn't change much so I trumps INVENTORY when you can
 enter.)
 B=brief V=verbose C=this command
 F=friends left FF=friends in header I=inventory O=one line of

 Looking around won't be enough to get you lost the way you need to get
 lost. It seems it might even add one more variable, or layer of
 complexity, beyond just waiting.

 older Mac interpreters may not support the status line list.
 The screen dimensions are 70 x 24. Dimensions of at least 105x25 are

 Ok, the list is in the status bar, now. Note: if you resize to &lt;25

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a mysterious package
   a pocket teleporter device
   a list of needs (can be examined with just X)

 You see nothing special about the mysterious package. But you sure
 SENSE something special under that newfangled top-open-secret material
 that can hold things several times its size if necessary. Quantum
 physics is crazy.

 ahead.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Threediopolis, Sector 345</span>
 You've been wandering for too long. You get tired, and you figure it's
 probably best to start over with a clean look on things. You push the

 scrapping your remaining plans.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Threediopolis, Sector 444</span>

 It's got a button you can push. You're reminded how, with so many
 buttons to push in Threediopolis, the letter "p" is a verb meaning
 "push the button."

 Well, Ed won't be alone now. Or, rather, he'll have some of his best

 You reach into the mysterious package and pull out a stink-bomb, then

 there's nothing they can do to you. There's legal precedent--plus if

 would mean more annoying protestors. You're glad your benefactor has a

 It's so rare to get natural sun. Usually the heat lamps are enough.
 Someone punches your ration card and you return to your home,
 cheerier. You're given a dark bottle of instant sunlight for your
 employer, too. He seems to be on the monthly plan, and it's too
 fragile to mail to him.

 You hear Ed Dunn discussed in hushed tones--that he is not that smart
 but hires people much smarter to work for him. A smart voice and dumb

 NOTE: there is currently a problem with web-based interpreters, and
 older Mac interpreters may not support the status line list.
 The screen dimensions are 70 x 24. Dimensions of at least 105x25 are

 He hands you an envelope. "Pretty good, kid. I have made it worth your

 Being a messenger, you don't have much more to do than go in the six
 basic directions (transport tubes make going up and down easy.) Or
 enter places. Maybe knock. Nothing fancy. Type C to see everything.

>examine peephole


 It's for looking out, not looking in.

 No need to be so formal. Walk on in.

 Obviously there needs to be a crackdown on sicko-porn masquerading as
 art, but this has been certified by the Ministry of Art as relatively
 intellectual stuff. It will provoke dynamic conversation at Ed Dunn's
 party, too, for sure. You pick out a sculpture from the No-Photograph
 Zone for later delivery to your benefactor.

 People seem surprised to see you. You don't look like a property
 owner. But once they see your list, they realize who you are working

 Well, I guess Ed Dunn wants to have a few 24 hour days of sunlight.

 Knowledge is power is money. You aren't allowed to see what Ed needs,
 but whatever it is, it's too important to keep online. You hand over a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Threediopolis, Sector 444</span>

 Man, you have heard a lot of reasons why this place or that place is
 good for comfort food, but one thing you can always rely on: owners
 misspell, grub will excel. The 'S on the sign triggers another rule:
 apostrophe botch, the sauce is top notch. The proprietor, Mr. Sweenee
 (of course,) gives you few free samples for such a bulk order--and

 Dunn takes tips from them? You are given a manuscript that you throw

 "Great job, kid! You got all my friends. They can keep a party

 "It's good to see you did all the fun stuff I put in there. I like
 fun."

 Ed hands you some stuff: a Yankees world champs t-shirt from before
 their 90-year drought, a big block of dehydrated beer, a little extra
 for helping his business run smoothly, and a a CD--yes, a CD--of games
 Ed assures you are awesome, by some Andrew Schultz guy. Ed praises you
 as a new go-getter in the organization. "Didn't even need my help!
 Kid, I wish I had some extra hard deliveries to make. You'd pick them
 off, easy."

 In fact, he is so pleased, he invites you to his party! He even
 manages to impress the duende-endued DeeDee Sneed, who's engaged to
 old-money Sundude Senese. Ed calls you as "Old sport" as he related
 how Sundude called him "Ed Dung" once (and you can see why it hurts.)

 You reflect briefly that Z is the end of the alphabet, and people who
 Z too much may run afoul of efficiency laws.

>wait


 You hear a buzzing of droids in the distance.

>wait


 You fall asleep on your journey. You are awakened by whirring and
 clacking. Droids pick you up and give you an infra-red marking that
 identifies you as a potential leech on society--and juice and cookies,
 this time, since your possessions label you as moderately wealthy.
 They remind you the marking will fade in a year.

>jump


 No reason to, with vertical transport tubes to go up and down.

>p


 You have heard about teleporter overheat. It's quite a way to go.
 Maybe you should walk around a bit more.

>in


 Nothing to enter. It's all so unfamiliar.

>xyzzy


 Yes, indeed, the game map has 3 axes--x, y and z.

>plugh


 Being a messenger, you don't have much more to do than go in the six
 basic directions (transport tubes make going up and down easy.) Or
 enter places. Maybe knock. Nothing fancy. Type C to see everything.

>fuck


 Dude! Eww.

>c


 The six directions, abbreviated: N, S, E, W, U, D. K knocks. I/IN goes
 in (inventory doesn't change much so I trumps INVENTORY when you can
 enter.)
 A=use your availbleometer
 B=brief V=verbose C=this command
 I=inventory O=one line of by-length list OO=friends in header  X=all
 the list
 H=hint toggle
 P pushes the panic button to send you to sector 444. J=jump mode to
 skip diagonal warning.
 T toggles big long listing in the status bar. Z waits.

>p


 Teleporting technology, apparently only for the very richest people,
 kicks you back to the center of the city.

 Well, this kind of stinks. You're on a real cold streak. Maybe you can
 figure what to do by looking at your list. Maybe somewhere will make
 sense that didn't before you found a few other places.
