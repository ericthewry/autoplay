 Bedroom (on the big bed)
 Moonlight plays through the window, softly illuminating the bedroom,

 To the west is the cupboard where you usually live, and the doorway to
 the northwest leads to the rest of the house.

 David, your owner, lies next to you on the bed, in a deep sleep.

 First time players may wish to try HELP.

 That was a rhetorical question.

 To the west is the cupboard where you usually live, and the doorway to
 the northwest leads to the rest of the house.

 David, your owner, lies next to you on the bed, in a deep sleep.

 First time players may wish to try HELP.

 this description.

>examine me
 Quite the most beautiful furry brown teddy bear.

>hug david
 A touching gesture, although your owner remains asleep and unaware.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>waylay david
 (jumping on then attacking David)

 Jump on: What a curious idea.

 Attack: David continues to sleep, totally oblivious.

 You tumble down, but being a soft bear, that's ok.

>go down
 You can't go that way.

>look

 Bedroom
 Moonlight plays through the window, softly illuminating the bedroom,
 full of comfortable memories.

 To the west is the cupboard where you usually live, and the doorway to
 the northwest leads to the rest of the house.

 A big bed fills up most of the room.

 David lies on the bed, very much asleep.

>enter bed
 You struggle, but clamber up successfully.

>sleep
 You settle down in the warm fabric and fall asleep. In time, morning
 comes. The day of your owner's big plan to take you along to the Teddy
 Bear Picnic! Unfortunately, the picnic requires some kind of reply
 card for entry, and David can't find it anywhere. Ah well, maybe next
 year.

 That's already open.

>go west

 Cupboard
 When you aren't lying on the bed, you usually stay in here, snug and
 safe with your friends atop the warm pile of clothes.

 The cupboard opens eastward to the bedroom.

 On the pile of clothes you can see your good friends Matt and Terry
 Moose.

 Your warm winter jacket is here, which may be just as well, it's a
 little chilly.

>examine matt
 A beautiful plush toy moose, in a kneeling pose, and a loyal (if
 silent) friend.

>examine terry
 A beautiful plush toy moose, in a standing pose, and a loyal (if
 silent) friend.

 Bedroom

 A big bed fills up most of the room.

 David lies on the bed, very much asleep.

>go northwest

 South Hallway
 This is the southern end of a plain carpeted hallway, which continues
 to the north.

 To the east is the computer room and to the southeast the bedroom. A
 bathroom (in the English sense) lies to the southwest, and one in the
 American sense to the south.

 A yellow plastic ball, known as a favourite toy of the family cat, has
 been left here.

>examine ball
 A spherical yellow plastic cage, with a shiny bell inside.

>push ball
 Nothing obvious happens.

>shake ball
 (first taking the yellow ball)
 The bell tinkles surprisingly loudly.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a yellow ball
   your green jacket (being worn)
   your night shirt (being worn)

>go east

 Computer Room
 The computer room is neat but not often used. One day a new computer
 will arrive here, and surely then your owner will regain his
 enthusiasm. For now he keeps mumbling about bank accounts and
 expensive machines and repair bills.

 To the west lies the south end of the hall.

 A tall glass table stands here, home to your owner's old hobby
 computer. Next to the computer you can make out a blue disk through
 the thick glass.

 You can also see an ergonomic chair here.

>examine disk
 You will have to get closer to the blue disk to see in detail.

>climb on chair
 You struggle, but clamber up successfully.

>examine disk
 You will have to get closer to the blue disk to see in detail.

>climb on table
>climb on table

>jump
 Full marks for cute and furry, but none for achievement.

>examine chair
 A strange looking padded chair on casters, designed for people to
 kneel on. This is supposed to be comfortable for them.

>go down
 You tumble down, but being a soft bear, that's ok.

>go west

 South Hallway
 This is the southern end of a plain carpeted hallway, which continues
 to the north.

 To the east is the computer room and to the southeast the bedroom. A
 bathroom (in the English sense) lies to the southwest, and one in the
 American sense to the south.

>go southwest

 Bathroom
 The bathroom has recently been tiled in glaring white. A doorway to
 the northeast leads to the rest of the house.

 Along the west wall is a large tub, which your owner apparently enjoys
 swimming in.

 To the south is the bathroom sink, the next subject of renovation,
 with a new copper pipe installed, and a storage drawer below.

>examine pipe
 A brand new sink pipe, still waiting to be connected, it leads from
 the floor to nowhere as yet.

>get pipe
 That's not something a small bear can readily carry.

>examine sink
 In actual fact, the one thing this unit presently lacks is a sink. But
 it does have a sparkling new pipe and a working drawer.

>examine drawer
 A nicely laminated white drawer, presently shut.

>open it
 The drawer wobbles around, and seems quite loose as you pull it open,
 revealing a yoyo and a ukelele.

>get all from drawer
 yoyo: Removed.
 ukelele: Removed.

>play ukulele
 You can't see any such thing.

>play ukelele
 You strum a few chords, unconvincingly. Which isn't surprising,
 considering your soft toy paws.

>examine yoyo
 A `Moose' brand glow in the dark yoyo, missing its string.

>examine bath
 A large white tub, still with quite a bit of water from the last time
 your owner went swimming.

>climb in bath
 You can't see any such thing.

>enter tub
 But then you might get your fur wet.

>go northeast

 South Hallway
 This is the southern end of a plain carpeted hallway, which continues
 to the north.

 To the east is the computer room and to the southeast the bedroom. A
 bathroom (in the English sense) lies to the southwest, and one in the
 American sense to the south.

>go south
 That's not a room teddy bears are normally found in.

>go north

 North Hallway
 A small knot of doors leading every which way, this end of the hall
 can be a little confusing for small bears such as yourself.

 Let's try to make it easy: northwest to the living room, north to the
 study, east to the front entrance, and south to the rest of the hall.

>go east

 Front Entrance
 The front entrance is unremarkable, but for the charming antique clock
 hanging on the south wall.

 A door to the east leads outside, and the hall lies to the west.

>go east
 The door is locked. Besides, it's cold and dangerous outside at night.

>examine clock
 This is a timeless tale.

>go west

 North Hallway
 A small knot of doors leading every which way, this end of the hall
 can be a little confusing for small bears such as yourself.

 Let's try to make it easy: northwest to the living room, north to the
 study, east to the front entrance, and south to the rest of the hall.

>go northwest

 Living Room
 The local centre for entertainment and laziness, the living room is
 permanent home to a very comfortable sofa and a television set. Both
 of these are much in use, usually at the same time.

 From here you can go south to the kitchen, southeast to the hall, or
 east to the study.

 Holly the calico cat is here, fast asleep on the comfortable sofa.

>pull tale
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull tail
 You can't see any such thing.

>wake cat
 You haven't the heart.

>enter sofa
 You struggle, but clamber up successfully.

>examine cat
 Holly sleeps soundly, softly purring.

>hug holly
 Holly purrs contendedly, and sleeps a little sounder.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>throw ball at cat
 Holly awakes with a start, eyes and ears alert, and bats the ball
 away.

>examine cat
 Holly's eyes dart about, looking for a toy to chase.

 Holly playfully bites you.

>ouch
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>bite cat
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>throw ball at cat
 (first taking the yellow ball)
 The yellow ball is out of reach.

 Holly bats at you.

   a ukelele
   a yoyo
   your green jacket (being worn)
   your night shirt (being worn)

 Holly playfully bites you.

>give yoyo to holly
 Holly sniffs the yoyo suspiciously.

>go down
 You tumble down, but being a soft bear, that's ok.

 Holly leaps down from the comfortable sofa.

>go south

 Kitchen
 The kitchen manages to remain untidy, despite the fact that your owner
 tends to prefer home delivered pizza to anything else.

 A door to the south leads outside, and one to the north leads to the
 living room.

 Along one wall stands a high bench, featuring a sink full of dirty
 dishes, next to which you can see a telephone and an answering
 machine, if you step back and crane your neck a little.

 An insulated wire cord emerges from a hole at the bottom of the bench,
 leading to a socket in the wall.

 A picnic basket has been left here, containing a baguette.

>get basket
 That's not something a small bear can readily carry.

>examine basket
 A wicker picnic hamper (David picked it up from a toyshop about two
 years ago), in which you can see a baguette.

>examine baguette
 A long, thin loaf of French bread.

>eat it
 (first taking the baguette)
 Perhaps it's best to save the baguette for later.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a baguette
   a ukelele
   a yoyo
   your green jacket (being worn)
   your night shirt (being worn)

>examine wire
 The cord is thin, white and functional, and runs from a hole at the
 bottom of the bench to a socket in the wall.

>pull wire
 The cord comes away from the socket, and you lose grip as it recoils
 back through the hole. The answering machine tumbles to the floor with
 a loud thud, cracking open.

 A small tape drops out of the machine.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>full score
 You have so far scored 6 out of a possible 33, in 77 turns, giving you
 the rank of birthday present.

 The score is made up as follows:

      1 for kindness to kittens
      2 for furry fashion
      3 for moving machinery

      6 total (out of 33)

>examine tape
 A small magnetic tape of the type used to record messages on.

>get it
 Taken.

>examine machine
 A bulky, primitive, answering machine with no controls you seem to
 understand. A small red light is conspicuously not glowing.

>go south
 The door is locked. Besides, it's cold and dangerous outside at night.

>go north

 Living Room
 The local centre for entertainment and laziness, the living room is
 permanent home to a very comfortable sofa and a television set. Both

 From here you can go south to the kitchen, southeast to the hall, or
 east to the study.

 You can also see a yellow ball here.

 Holly the calico cat is here, prowling menacingly.

 Holly bats at the television.

>examine tv
 A less than state of the art colour tv.

 The television is currently switched off.

 Holly flicks her tail back and forth.

>turn tv on
 The television appears to be tuned to a home shopping show.

 Holly eyes you suspiciously.

 The yoyo begins to glow brightly.

 Awful tacky home shopping show muzak can be heard.

>turn tv off
 The television goes dark and quiet, much to your relief.

 Holly stares at the yellow ball.

>get ball
 (putting the ukelele into the green jacket to make room)
 Taken.

 Holly pounces on an insect which isn't there.

>go south

 Kitchen

 tends to prefer home delivered pizza to anything else.

 living room.

 Along one wall stands a high bench, featuring a sink full of dirty
 dishes, next to which you can see a telephone, if you step back and
 crane your neck a little.

 An empty looking hole at the bottom of the bench loiters suspiciously
 near a power socket on the wall.

 A picnic basket has been left here.

 You can also see an answering machine here.

>go north

 Holly the calico cat is here, prowling menacingly.

 Holly stares at the comfortable sofa.

>go east

 Study
 This is more of a study-to-be than a study. A desk will one day grace
 the west wall, along with a comfortable study chair. One day.

 The hall lies to the south, the living room to the west.

 On the floor you can see a less than organised pile of papers. In one
 corner sits a lone filing cabinet.

>examine cabinet
 A dull grey metal filing cabinet, consisting of one drawer, firmly
 shut.

>open drawer
 It seems to be locked.

>climb cabinet
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>examine papers
 A dreadfully messy pile of old exam papers, study notes, letters, junk
 mail, bills, walkthoughs for adventure games, recipes, newspaper
 articles, medical records, and who knows what else.

 Near the top of the pile you find a flyer for a Teddy Bear Picnic!

>read flyer
 Come Along to the Teddy Bear Picnic

 Everyone who is young, or just young at heart, will have a fine day
 out at the Teddy Bear Picnic. Bring along your teddy bear and partake
 in all the fun! Frolic in the woods, join the scavenger hunt, and you
 never know, a special guest may just turn up!

 (A picture of a famous teddy bear of print, stage and screen appears
 on the flyer here)

 For more information about the Teddy Bear Picnic just dial 72 on your
 phone. Calls will be charged at... (The rest seems quite unimportant
 apart from the date- tommorow!)

 The yoyo is glowing more faintly.

 Welcome to Interactive Fiction

 Congratulations on ordering the z-chip. You should find enclosed in
 this package one (1) brand new, never before used, mint condition
 z-machine chip for use with any existing personal computer. Just put
 the chip in your computer and before you can say `xyzzy' it will be
 the Interactive Fiction machine of your dreams.

 All you need to do is provide the software. And you need not even do
 that! We've provided you with a free sample game. Just put the
 enclosed disk in your computer and before you can say `away' you'll be
 storing treasures and annoying dragons just like a real adventurer
 would!

 Best of luck!

>xyzzy
 A hollow voice says `Obviously, you are in the wrong game.'

>examine black disk
 A standard 5.25 inch computer disk, labelled `Dungeon.'

>open box
 That's already open.

>look in box
 Right in the middle of the packing, you find a well protected silicon
 chip. This must be the z-chip you have heard so much about.

>take z-chip
 You already have that.

 Computer Room
 The computer room is neat but not often used. One day a new computer
 will arrive here, and surely then your owner will regain his
 enthusiasm. For now he keeps mumbling about bank accounts and
 expensive machines and repair bills.

 To the west lies the south end of the hall.

 A large cardboard box stands open on the floor here, foam rubber
 packing sprawling in all directions.

 A tall glass table stands here, home to your owner's old hobby
 computer. Next to the computer you can make out a blue disk through
 the thick glass.

 It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist map of

 CURSES
 An Interactive Diversion
 Copyright (c) 1993, 1994, 1995 by Graham Nelson.
 Release 16 / Serial Number 951024 / Inform v1600 Library 5/12

 Attic
 The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a
 relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden
 floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all
 these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no
 electric light.

 A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from
 below.

>examine me

 Anyway, you play awhile and finish Curses, achieving the rank of
 Master Druid. You may now wear the official Druid's hat.

 Naturally, being a tidy sort of bear, you turn off the computer and
 remove the disk after you finish your game.

>examine hat
 Well now that you look closely, it appears to be a teddy bear sized
 night cap in blue and white stripes.

>put black disk in computer
 The black disk fits nicely in the disk drive.

 Welcome to Dungeon.                    This version created 13-MAR-82.
 You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded
 front door.
 There is a small mailbox here.

>open mailbox

 Anyway, you play awhile and finish Dungeon, even scoring the last
 lousy point. This is particularly impressive, as your owner has read
 the source code and still never managed this.

 Naturally, being a tidy sort of bear, you turn off the computer and

     a flyer
     a yoyo (providing light)

 A storage drawer has been carelessly left lying about, revealing a

 Holly the calico cat is here, fast asleep on the floor.

 away.

 A less than thrilling crescendo of over the top home shopping show
 muzak can be heard.

 Holly licks the stamp cautiously then shies away with distaste.

 Come Along to the Teddy Bear Picnic

 Everyone who is young, or just young at heart, will have a fine day
 out at the Teddy Bear Picnic. Bring along your teddy bear and partake
 in all the fun! Frolic in the woods, join the scavenger hunt, and you
 never know, a special guest may just turn up!

 (A picture of a famous teddy bear of print, stage and screen appears
 on the flyer here)

 For more information about the Teddy Bear Picnic just dial 72 on your
 phone. Calls will be charged at... (The rest seems quite unimportant
 apart from the date- tommorow!)

 Holly scrabbles at the wall with her paws.

 `That's right, with this amazing device, the z-chip, any computer can
 be a z-machine!'

 Kitchen
 The kitchen manages to remain untidy, despite the fact that your owner
 tends to prefer home delivered pizza to anything else.

 A door to the south leads outside, and one to the north leads to the
 living room.

 Along one wall stands a high bench, featuring a sink full of dirty
 dishes, next to which you can see a telephone, if you step back and
 crane your neck a little.

 An empty looking hole at the bottom of the bench loiters suspiciously
 near a power socket on the wall.

 full of comfortable memories.

 To the west is the cupboard where you usually live, and the doorway to
 the northwest leads to the rest of the house.

 A big bed fills up most of the room.

 David lies on the bed, very much asleep.

>save
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>enter bed
 You struggle, but clamber up successfully.

>enter bed
 You are on the big bed already.

>sleep
 Taking off your jacket, you settle down in the warm fabric and fall
 asleep. In time, morning comes. The day of your owner's big plan to
 take you along to the Teddy Bear Picnic! David finds the specially
 chosen baguette and the reply card eventually, and off you go. What a
 wonderful day. All the other teddy bears are there, playing games and
 making mischief. Everyone admires your beautiful brown fur, and smart
 clothes. And the mysterious jar of honey is enjoyed by all.

 South Hallway
 This is the southern end of a plain carpeted hallway, which continues
 to the north.

 To the east is the computer room and to the southeast the bedroom. A
 bathroom (in the English sense) lies to the southwest, and one in the
 American sense to the south.

>go north

 North Hallway
 A small knot of doors leading every which way, this end of the hall
 can be a little confusing for small bears such as yourself.

 Let's try to make it easy: northwest to the living room, north to the
 study, east to the front entrance, and south to the rest of the hall.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Living Room
 The local centre for entertainment and laziness, the living room is
 permanent home to a very comfortable sofa and a television set. Both
 of these are much in use, usually at the same time.

 From here you can go south to the kitchen, southeast to the hall, or
 east to the study.

 You can also see a yellow ball here.

 Holly the calico cat is here, fast asleep on the floor.

 A less than thrilling crescendo of over the top home shopping show
 muzak can be heard.

>get ball
 Taken.

 `Well want, wish and wonder no more!'

 This makes more of a noise than you might have thought, and Holly
 awakes with a start.

 Computer Room
 The computer room is neat but not often used. One day a new computer
 will arrive here, and surely then your owner will regain his
 enthusiasm. For now he keeps mumbling about bank accounts and
 expensive machines and repair bills.

 To the west lies the south end of the hall.

 A tall glass table stands here, home to your owner's old hobby
 computer. Next to the computer you can make out a green disk, a black
 disk and a blue disk through the thick glass.

 and Holly sniffs at it warily.

 In the middle of all this you are flung away and land on the floor.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen manages to remain untidy, despite the fact that your owner
 tends to prefer home delivered pizza to anything else.

 A door to the south leads outside, and one to the north leads to the
 living room.

 A large cardboard box stands open on the floor here, foam rubber
 packing sprawling in all directions.

 Along one wall stands a high bench, featuring a sink full of dirty
 dishes, next to which you can see a telephone, if you step back and
 crane your neck a little.

 An empty looking hole at the bottom of the bench loiters suspiciously
 near a power socket on the wall.

 A picnic basket has been left here, containing a honey jar.

 You can also see an ergonomic chair and an answering machine here.
