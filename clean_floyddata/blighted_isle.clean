 Your part in Napoleon’s downfall is about to come to an untimely end.

 The storm raging across the Bay of Biscay has forced Cornwallis to
 stand out to sea, giving an opportunity for a French captain with more
 daring than most to try to slip past the blockade.  While Nelson is
 chasing Villeneuve across the Atlantic, the Channel fleet is closely
 blockading Brest to ensure that Ganteaume can’t escape to join him;
 if
 he did Bonaparte’s invasion plans would perilously close to fruition.

 In the meantime, you are left swimming around in the Bay of Biscay.
 It can’t be more than a couple of minutes before you drown.  For a
 moment, you almost imagine you see the inscription on your own grave:

 R.I.P.  Lieutenant James Corby, RN
 1780 - 1805
 Lost at sea in the service of his country
 (mainly as a result of his own clumsiness)

 The storm-tossed waves thunder all around you.  The <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span> is
 nowhere in sight; neither is that other ship.  The sky is so black
 that even without the salt water stinging your eyes you could scarcely
 see a thing.  Already your sea-soaked clothes are starting to drag you
 under, and you feel so very, very cold.  It would be so much easier to
 give up the futile struggle, to accept the sea’s icy embrace, and
 yield to the everlasting sleep of your watery grave.  For surely there
 can be no hope of rescue now.

 And yet it was only a moment ago that you took your unplanned tumble
 over the side of the ship.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Ting!  Ting!</span>  Two bells in the middle watch: ten hours since
 sighting the strange sail and giving chase.

 It wasn’t yet clear that the strange sail <span class="floydstyle em">was</span> a French
 warship, but your captain was taking no chances, and so the
 <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span>, 38, had set off in hot pursuit.  She was carrying all
 the sail a frigate safely could in such a storm, but still the strange
 vessel was maintaining its lead, and it was all the <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span>
 could do to keep pace with her.  But the weather had been steadily
 worsening; the storm was becoming a gale, and there was a real danger
 that the <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span> would lose a spar – or worse – unless she
 shortened sail.  So you dispatched the midshipman of the watch to seek
 the captain’s permission to do just that.

 And then came the totally unexpected hail from the masthead:

 “Land ho!  Fine on the starboard bow!”

 That was absurd; there shouldn’t have been any land within a dozen
 leagues.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Quarterdeck of HMS </span>Niobe
 The deck around you was little more than a mass of shadow and outline
 in the dark, with the only point of light coming from the binnacle
 just in front of you.  You were aware of the mizzen mast towering
 above you nearby, but as much from the howl of the wind in the rigging
 as from anything you could see.

 The helmsman was standing nearby at the wheel.

 You were almost deafened by the howling gale screaming in the rigging
 and lashing up the waves all round the ship.

 It wasn’t the most elegant instrument – you couldn’t afford
 better on
 your pay – but it did the job.

 The captain came striding out onto the quarterdeck just as the lookout
 repeated his hail from the mast: “Land ho!  Fine on the starboard

 The captain peered up the mast in evident irritation, then strode over
 to the binnacle to check the compass.  Turning back to you he snapped,
 “What’s that idiot on about?  There should be no land between here
 and
 Spain!”

 “No sir,” you agreed dutifully.

 “Well then, Mr Corby, you’d better get up to the mizzen-top with
 your
 bring’em near and see what this is all about!” the captain
 commanded,
 throwing a significant glance up the mast.

 “Aye aye, sir,” you replied, trying to disguise your reluctance.

 You raised the telescope to your right eye and scanned the horizon
 ahead.  You could just make out the distant white sail of the ship you
 were pursuing, but there seemed to be no sign of land.

 “I gave you an order, Mr Corby,” the captain snapped.  “So up the
 mast
 with you!”

>go up

 Even after more than ten years at sea, you had never developed much of
 a head for heights, especially when it meant fighting your way up the
 ratlines of a swaying mast in a howling gale; but it seemed like there
 was nothing for it but to grit your teeth and ascend.

 Grasping the ropes and forcing yourself not to look down, you began to
 climb.  A few yards up you paused for breath, and longed just to close
 your eyes and cling on for dear life until the storm had passed; but
 you felt the eyes of the captain and half the crew were upon you: it
 behoved you to play the part of a fearless officer, so on you went.

 A little over half-way up, you caught sight of something ahead; but it
 looked more like a band of fog than a stretch of land.  It at once
 struck you as absurd, not only that a bank of sea-mist should collect
 here, but even more that it would not be at once shredded by the gale.
 Overcome by curiosity you took out your telescope, trying to do your
 best to keep your balance on the rigging while examining the strange
 sight.  It <span class="floydstyle em">did</span> look like a band of mist.  But at the next
 moment a sudden gust made the <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span> heel over to starboard,
 and in a heart-stopping moment you felt your feet slip free of the
 lines.  For a moment you hung there by a single hand, and then that
 too was wrenched free and you fell.

 You hit the surface of the sea and carried straight on down.  To begin
 with, you thought that was it, and almost resigned yourself to drown;
 but then, as your lungs felt ready to burst, your survival instinct
 took over and you struggled to regain the surface.

 The waves all around you look as black as the sky above, and stretch
 just as far in all directions.

 And now, here you are, swimming in the freezing water, with neither
 ship nor land in sight, and probably only a few minutes left before
 you finally do give up and drown.

>remove clothes

 You struggle to remove your clothes before they drag you down, but,
 being waterlogged, they cling to you peversely and you lack the
 strength to wrestle with them.

 You can struggle no more.  You start to feel body and mind shutting
 down.  As the waves close over your head you fancy you hear voices and
 see a distant light – the final fleeting fancies of a dying mind.

 And then everything goes blank.

 Some time later you wake up to find yourself lying on a hard shingle
 beach.  From the position of the sun in the sky it must be either
 early morning or late evening – almost certainly the former.  You
 feel
 as stiff as a ship’s biscuit and weaker than a limp lettuce leaf, but
 miraculously, you seem to be alive.

 As you regain consciousness, you become aware of the crash of the surf
 at your feet.  It seems you must have been washed ashore – but where?
 There should have been no land within a dozen leagues or more of where
 you fell into the sea.  Then you remember the lookout’s hail; he must
 have seen land after all, and this must be it.

 Before you can do more than start to wonder whether this land is
 inhabited, you become aware that you are not alone.

 A young woman is standing just by your head, peering down at you with
 a look of evident concern.

 You look a bit bedraggled from your watery misadventure, but otherwise
 unscathed.  But then you’re young and healthy, with a complexion
 tanned by years at sea.

 You are empty-handed.

 “I saw you lying here when I came out of the house just now,” she
 explains, gesturing vaguely behind her, “so I came straight down to
 see if – well, you seem to be alive at any rate, but are you all
 right?”

 (You could say yes or no, or ask her who she is.)

 Then the whole day sucks so bad you can barely wait until seventh

 watching TV that you've gotta rush through your makeup or you won't be

 may say you're old enough to drive, but Frank sure doesn't agree.

 Man, you can't wait for all this to be over.

 you were going to change anything, you'd start with the clothes in

 moment a sudden gust made the <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span> heel over to starboard,
 and in a heart-stopping moment you felt your feet slip free of the
 lines.  For a moment you hung there by a single hand, and then that
 too was wrenched free and you fell.

 You hit the surface of the sea and carried straight on down.  To begin
 with, you thought that was it, and almost resigned yourself to drown;
 but then, as your lungs felt ready to burst, your survival instinct
 took over and you struggled to regain the surface.

 The waves all around you look as black as the sky above, and stretch
 just as far in all directions.

 And now, here you are, swimming in the freezing water, with neither
 ship nor land in sight, and probably only a few minutes left before
 you finally do give up and drown.

 You’ll probably sleep soon enough – forever; but you’re not quite
 ready to give up yet.

 You can struggle no more.  You start to feel body and mind shutting
 down.  As the waves close over your head you fancy you hear voices and
 see a distant light – the final fleeting fancies of a dying mind.

 And then everything goes blank.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shingly Cove (lying on the shingly beach)</span>
 Some time later you wake up to find yourself lying on a hard shingle
 beach.  From the position of the sun in the sky it must be either
 early morning or late evening – almost certainly the former.  You
 feel
 as stiff as a ship’s biscuit and weaker than a limp lettuce leaf, but
 miraculously, you seem to be alive.

 As you regain consciousness, you become aware of the crash of the surf
 at your feet.  It seems you must have been washed ashore – but where?
 There should have been no land within a dozen leagues or more of where
 you fell into the sea.  Then you remember the lookout’s hail; he must
 have seen land after all, and this must be it.

 Before you can do more than start to wonder whether this land is
 inhabited, you become aware that you are not alone.

 A young woman is standing just by your head, peering down at you with
 a look of evident concern.

 She’s a pretty woman of about twenty, neatly dressed and of slender
 build, with straight dark brown hair falling about her shoulders.

 The young woman is wearing a single ear-ring.

 “I saw you lying here when I came out of the house just now,” she
 explains, gesturing vaguely behind her, “so I came straight down to
 see if – well, you seem to be alive at any rate, but are you all
 right?”

 “I’m Lieutenant James Corby, Royal Navy,” you tell her.  “I was
 climbing the mizzen last night – at least I think it was last night
 –
 when I was swept overboard.  I don’t remember much more – I suppose
 I
 must have been washed ashore here.”

 “So it would seem,” she agrees.  “Well, you’re lucky to be
 alive!” She
 pauses for a moment, then continues, “I think I should try to get you
 up to the house and get something warm inside you.  Do you think you
 can manage to stand?”

 (You could say yes or no.)

 a
 little roughly.  Between her tugging and your groaning and pushing you
 somehow manage to rise to your feet.

 “Good, right,” she nods, “Let’s go up to the house, then;
 it’s not
 far.” So saying she walks across the shingly beach to the foot of the
 stone steps, where she turns and waits for you to follow.

 You follow Julia up the steps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 Most of this sizeable garden is given over to vegetable plots.  To the
 east it comes to an abrupt end overlooking the cove, accessible via a
 rough flight of stone steps.  At its northern end stands a large stone
 house, from the front of which a gravel path heads off to the west,
 while along the garden’s southern boundary runs a long wooden fence.

 From the top of the steps Julia crosses the garden to the front door
 of the house, where she opens the door, then turns back to motion you
 to follow her inside.

 The house has a solid, four-square appearance.  It is not particularly
 attractive, the grim grey stone of which it is constructed doing
 nothing to enhance its appearance, but it does look reasonably
 commodious.

 “Come inside, Mr Corby,” Julia invites you.

 covered with protective netting.  Together they take up most of the

 You follow Julia inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Parlour</span>
 The parlour is of a good size, but not so big as to forfeit a certain
 rustic cosiness.  The large open fireplace looks as if it could
 sustain quite a blaze in winter, though it’s currently unlit.  The
 furniture is plain but functional.  The front door is to the south,
 with other doorways to north and east.

 “Come through into the kitchen while I brew you up some hot soup,”
 Julia offers, waving towards the north.

 Julia closes the front door.

 You follow Julia into the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is quite large, and conveys something of the same rustic
 flavour as the parlour, which lies just to the south.  A plain wooden
 door, painted black, is set in the north wall next to a large
 wood-burning stove.  An even larger wooden table occupies most of the
 space in the middle of the kitchen, together with a conveniently
 placed wooden chair.

 Julia walks over to the stove, checks that it’s still burning, and
 puts a pan on it.  “Take a seat while I heat up this soup for you,”
 she tells you.

 You sink gratefully into the large wooden chair.

 You look a bit bedraggled from your watery misadventure, but otherwise
 unscathed.  But then you’re young and healthy, with a complexion
 tanned by years at sea.

 You are empty-handed.

 Julia turns to you and hands you a gold coin, “Here,” she says,
 “you’ll need somewhere to stay.  I’m afraid we can’t put you up
 here,
 but the Red Dragon’s a pretty decent inn.  Well, it’s the only inn,
 actually.  Anyway, that’ll buy you a few days’ board and lodging
 there
 till you find your feet.”

 When you start to protest, she interrupts firmly, “No, I insist.
 It’s
 the least I can do for a shipwrecked sailor.  Besides, if you feel
 that strongly about it, I’m sure the day will come when you’ll be
 able
 to repay me.”

 (You could thank her, or refuse politely.)

 Julia gives a bitter laugh, “The old Duke <span class="floydstyle em">tried</span> all
 right,”
 she tells you.  “The silly old fool thought he could go and lead an
 expedition against it – apparently he’d found some way to get past
 the
 Ridge.  Anyway, off he went with his brother and a band of castle
 guards, and none of them was ever seen or heard of again.  And still
 the blight didn’t go away.  Must be a couple of years back, now.”

 It seems like she’s already told you all she knows: the blight
 started
 three or four years ago, spreading from the north.  It converts
 farmland into dusty wasteland, and no one seems to know either the
 cause or the cure.  From what Julia says, it’s causing serious
 difficulties for the island’s food supply.

 “What’s this about a ridge?” you ask.

 “It’s a range of hills that divides the island in half,” she
 explains.
 “There doesn’t seem to be any way through it, over it, or round it,
 so
 no one knows what lies to the north.”

 impassable, and even if it were, couldn’t you just sail round it in a
 boat and land on the other side?”

 “You’d think so, wouldn’t you?” she replies quickly.  “But
 there are
 strange currents round this island, so it turns out you can’t.”

 Your frown deepens.  You’ve been a naval officer long enough to know
 a
 thing or two about strange currents, but you’ve never heard of
 currents that are <span class="floydstyle em">that</span> strange.

 You can’t think of anything else to ask about it at this point:
 you’ve

 there’s no way over, round, or through it.

 enough to try to do something about the blight, but he obviously

 (first opening the front door)
 “Well, bye for now then; no doubt I shall see you again soon,”
 Julia
 bids you farewell.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 Most of this sizeable garden is given over to vegetable plots.  To the
 east it comes to an abrupt end overlooking the cove, accessible via a
 rough flight of stone steps.  At its northern end stands a large stone
 house, from the front of which a gravel path heads off to the west,
 while along the garden’s southern boundary runs a long wooden fence.

 Julia closes the front door from the other side.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> north   east   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>


 It’s about five feet high, and made of wood that has long since
 weathered to a dull grey.  Despite the weathering, the fence still
 looks sturdy enough.

 The vegetable plots are a series of neatly laid out rectangles, some
 covered with protective netting.  Together they take up most of the
 space in the garden.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long Gravel Path</span>
 The main path continues to east and west as far as you can see, rising
 slightly to the latter as it heads inland.  A long hedge blocks the
 way south, but just at this point of the path a rutted track runs off
 to the north.

 four feet and six along its length.  If it was ever cultivated it has
 long since turned wild.

 You set off to the west, and after a brisk walk up the slope you find
 yourself on the eastern outskirts of the town.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Street</span>
 Pressed in between a rough stone wall to the north and a small shop to
 the south this short, narrow street runs east back towards the coast
 and west towards the centre of town.

 A slender young woman is standing with her back to the shop door,
 desperately trying to beat off a ruffian who seems bent on robbing
 her.

 “Hand over yer purse, you silly bitch, and I might just decide not to
 bruise that pretty face of yours,” the ruffian declares.

 You may still be a bit weakened from your watery ordeal, but the
 ruffian looks half-starved, while you’ve been toughened by ten years
 at sea fighting the French.  He hardly manages to land a single blow
 on you, while you soon give him a thrashing.  After no more than a
 minute of it he runs away muttering curses under his breath.

 “Thank you!” the young woman declares as you turn back to check how
 she is.  “He was proving – quite troublesome.  I never thought even
 Cadan Pascoe would stoop to attacking me!  But I don’t believe I know
 you; perhaps you should introduce yourself?”

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 (You could tell her about yourself, or ask her how she is.)

 “I’m Lieutenant James Corby, second lieutenant of His Britannic
 Majesty’s frigate <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span>,” you begin pompously.  “We got
 caught in a gale last night while in pursuit of a strange sail out of
 Brest, and I fell overboard while climbing the mizzen mast.  It seems
 I was washed ashore here.”

 “I see,” she replies.  “Then it sounds as if his Britannic
 Majesty
 needs to employ officers who are less accident-prone.  Nevertheless, I
 am grateful for your timely and gallant intervention, lieutenant.  And
 in case you were wondering, I am Lady Inalda, cousin to the Duke of
 Valon, who rules this island.”

 After a short pause she adds, “I was hoping the shop would be open.
 It’s the only place on the island where one can purchase oil, but
 Sally Penhaligon seems not to have opened up yet.  Normally I’d have
 sent a servant on such an errand, of course, but we’re a little
 short-staffed right now.”

 “Who was that fellow who attacked you?  Do you know him?” you ask.

 “Yes, I know him,” she replies.  “He’s Samuel Pascoe’s son,
 Cadan.
 They lost their farm to the blight, so I suppose I should feel sorry
 for him in a way.”

 you ask.

 still.  I have never been off this island – in truth my life has been

 “Why did you say that relations between the Duke and Dick Trelawney
 aren’t all that good?” you ask.

 She hesitates a moment or two before replying, “I think perhaps it
 because they see themselves as rival sources of authority on the
 island, with very different ideas on how authority should be
 exercised.  At least I know my cousin feels that Mr Trelawney does not
 respect his authority, and that is something my cousin resents.”

 (first trying to open the shop door)
 The shop door seems to be locked.

 Lady Inalda glances at the shop in some annoyance, then turns back to
 you, “Sally Penhaligon really should have opened up her shop by
 now,”
 she sighs.  “Perhaps she’s idling away in the Red Dragon again!
 Lieutenant, I hate to impose on you further, but if you were to go to
 the Red Dragon and see Mrs Penhaligon there, perhaps you would be so
 good as to tell her she has a customer waiting.  Could you do that for
 me, do you think?”

 (You could say you’ll go, or ask her about Sally Penhaligon.)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 This crossroads, at what may be the centre of the town, is formed by
 meeting of roads to north, south, east and west.  All four roads lead
 between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short,
 while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north
 and south look as if they run on quite a way, but just a short way to
 the south you can see a hanging inn-sign.

 On the northeast corner stands an ancient chapel, while one the
 opposite corner is the inn.  Many of the other buildings look like
 cottages.

 A pair of children run past and disappear into one of the cottages.

 A boy of about ten enters the crossroads, takes one look at you, then
 runs back up West Street in apparent fright at seeing a stranger.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Street</span>
 The west side of this long, grubby street is dominated by the Red
 Dragon Inn, while on the opposite side squats a row of bleak stone
 cottages.  The street continues to north and south over well-worn
 cobbles.

 They’re not exactly hovels, but they’re all quite small, and at
 least
 from the outside the grey stone of which they’re constructed gives
 them a uniformly bleak appearance.

 The tavern is a large two-story building, rather better constructed

 clearly marks the inn as the Red Dragon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Tavern</span>
 The main room of the tavern seems cosy enough, and cleaner than quite
 a few you’ve seen.  There are several tables and chairs scattered
 about, while the bar counter runs close to the west wall, in front of
 a door marked “Private”.  The way out is to the east and a flight
 of
 stairs leads up to the floor above.

 On the bar counter is a jug of red wine.

 A blonde woman is deep in conversation with a buxom redhead who is
 standing behind the bar.

 A group of fishermen are sitting eating and drinking in the corner.

 The two women at the bar appear to be exchanging gossip.  The buxom
 redhead says something about a hidden sword, but you wonder if it’s
 some kind of double entendre.

 (You can use the TYPO command to disable the typo-correction feature.)

 She’s perhaps about thirty years old, with a round face that’s
 starting to lose its youthful prettiness, and curly blonde hair worn
 quite short – only down to her chin.

 The buxom redhead whispers something that makes a blonde woman laugh.

 Turning to the buxom redhead she says, “’Bye then, I’ll see you
 later.” Sally Penhaligon leaves to the east.

 There’s a sudden crescendo in the conversation from the corner.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 “That costs extra,” she replies briskly.

 Betty does not respond.

 A pretty young woman pops her head in through the door to glance over
 at the group of men in the corner.  Apparently not finding whoever she
 was looking for she goes away again.

 “What do you think of the Duke, Betty – or shouldn’t I ask?”
 you
 enquire.

 “Ask if you like,” she shrugs.  “At least he leaves me alone.  To
 tell
 the truth, I don’t really know what he’s <span class="floydstyle em">for</span>.  I know
 I’m
 only a simple barmaid who’s not meant to understand these things, but
 there’s what – a couple of hundred of us on the island – and
 there’s
 this bloke up in his great big castle calling himself a duke and
 telling us all what we can and can’t do.”

 “Betty, perhaps you can help me,” you start to ask, “I was just
 wondering about...”

 “Sorry, I just remembered something I had to do,” she interrupts.
 She
 darts into the back room and comes back a few moments later.  “Sorry,
 you were saying...”

 “Doesn’t someone have to keep order?” you ask.  “Isn’t that
 what the
 Duke’s for?”

 “I’m sure that’s just what he’d say,” she concurs, “but
 there ain’t
 that much happening here that needs ordering, and I daresay what there
 is we could manage to order ourselves without the help of some
 high-and-mighty duke.  Still, I’m only a barmaid, so don’t pay any
 attention to what I say.”

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> east   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>   <span class="floydstyle u2">up</span>


 “What do people say about Meg?” you want to know.

 “Well,” she hesitates, “there are some who say she’s a witch,
 but I’ve
 never heard anyone say she’s ever actually harmed anyone, except old
 Jenny Pascoe and her son Cad, that is.”

 (You could ask her what Jenny Pascoe says Meg did.)

 One of men in the corner tries to catch Betty’s eye.

 She’s already told you that she’s hardly ever come across Meg since
 their paths virtually never cross, so all she can do is to repeat
 hearsay.  That hearsay includes some accusations of witchcraft, but
 only Jenny Pascoe and her son Cad have ever said that Meg has actually
 ever harmed anyone.

 The fishermen listen intently as one of them tells a funny story.

 “Do you know Cadan Pascoe?” you ask.

 “I know most people around here, love,” she replies, “but young
 Cad,
 now – well there’s a hard case: he drinks too much, and his temper
 gets even worse when he’s drunk – it’s bad enough when he’s
 sober if
 you ask me.”

 “Do you enjoy your work?” you ask.

 “Yes, I do – I get to meet all sorts of interesting people,” she
 replies, giving you a sly look, “and there’s always the chance of
 earning a bit on the side – in such a comfy way, too!”

 (first taking the jug of red wine)
 “Here, let me pour you a glass,” Betty offers.  She takes a glass
 from
 behind the bar, fills it with the wine and offers it to you.  It
 tastes even sweeter than it looks, but it’s not unpleasant, so you
 soon drink it all.  When you hand the glass back to Betty she puts it
 back behind the bar.

 “Do I take it that you’re not all that impressed by Duke
 William?” you
 enquire.

 “The only thing that impresses me about him is his conviction of
 self-importance,” she shrugs.  “According to my grandpa our noble
 Duke’s ancestors were just a bunch of plundering mercenaries who came
 here from France by mistake.  My grandpa says they were meant to be
 following the real Duke William to somewhere called ‘Hastings’, but
 got lost and fetched up here instead.  They then built themselves that
 castle and bossed everyone around because they had the soldiers.  So,
 it seems to me that ‘duke’ is just another name for ‘plunderer’
 – but
 then I’m only a simple barmaid.”

 You decide to pursue this topic no further in case her sentiments
 become any more Jacobin; after all Britain has been at war for years
 now with a country that takes that kind of attitude to its
 aristocracy.  In any case she’s made her views pretty plain: she
 regards the Duke as barely legitimate and even less useful.

 “What did you do before working here, Betty?” you ask.

 “Nursed my mother when she was ill,” she tells you.  “That must
 have
 been – oh, more than ten years ago, anyway.  She died, you see; I was
 only sixteen then.  My father had already drowned in a fishing
 accident, so we were as poor as dungeon rats.  This was a really good
 opening for me – a roof over my head, regular meals, and the work
 really ain’t that bad.”

 You can’t think of anything else to ask her about herself right now.
 She’s already told you that she was born on the island, as were her
 ancestors as far back as she knows.  She lost her father to a fishing
 accident and her mother to illness at least ten years ago, and was
 probably left destitute, but working in the Red Dragon gives her a
 roof over her head and regular meals, and she seems happy enough with
 that.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Tavern</span>
 The main room of the tavern seems cosy enough, and cleaner than quite
 a few you’ve seen.  There are several tables and chairs scattered
 about, while the bar counter runs close to the west wall, in front of
 a door marked “Private”.  The way out is to the east and a flight
 of
 stairs leads up to the floor above.

 On the bar counter is a jug of red wine.

 Betty is eyeing you with a lopsided grin.

 A group of fishermen are sitting eating and drinking in the corner.

 The main room of the tavern seems cosy enough, and cleaner than quite
 a few you’ve seen.  There are several tables and chairs scattered
 about, while the bar counter runs close to the west wall, in front of
 a door marked “Private”.  The way out is to the east and a flight
 of
 stairs leads up to the floor above.

 On the bar counter is a jug of red wine.

 Betty is working behind the bar.

 A group of fishermen are sitting eating and drinking in the corner.

 There’s a momentary lull in the fishermen’s conversation.  Then
 they
 all start talking at once.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 This crossroads, at what may be the centre of the town, is formed by
 meeting of roads to north, south, east and west.  All four roads lead
 between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short,
 while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shop</span>
 There is little enough space in the front of this small shop as it is,
 and much of it is taken up with the densely-packed shelves jammed
 round the walls.  These are stacked with goods of every kind, bearing
 out the fact that this is the island’s only general store.  A doorway
 stands open to the south behind the serving counter, opposite the
 street door to the north.

 Sally Penhaligon is standing behind the counter.

 A faint smell of fermenting apples wafts from the back room.

 The goods on the shelves include some fresh fruit and vegetables,
 pottery, wool, pins, needles, cutlery, pots, pans, bowls, jars,
 buttons, thread, rolls of thread and of string, some cheeses, a pile

 beside.  Much of it looks like local produce, but if it all is then
 the island must support a surprisingly wide range of industries.

 while to south and east it slopes down towards the beach, and grass
 gives way to sand.  To the east are the faint traces of the track
 which become a street running back down towards the centre of the

 the
 sea from here, truncated by the ever-present mist.

 You notice a particularly attractive clump of wild flowers growing

 So far as you can tell, it may still be attached to its sword, but if
 so, the sword is well buried.  The hilt looks solid and ancient, with
 some fine patterns carved into it; it could be made of bronze.

 Some earth starts slipping back into the hole.

 The hollow is formed by an unclimbably steep hill to north and east,
 and rather gentler slopes to south and west.  The end of a drainage
 pipe protrudes from some way up the northern hillside.

 The round hole contains the hilt of a sword.

 With a rush, the rest of the earth you just dug out falls into the
 hole, burying the sword hilt once more.

 This narrow finger of land juts out into the sea between a large

 neither of which is directly accessible from here.  Some kind of

 The beach stretches away to both northwest and southeast from here,

 A small green toolbox lies on the beach beside a fishing net.

 The small green toolbox contains a screwdriver.

 A stout man is sitting on the beach mending the net.

 The beach comes to an end at the stone jetty which lies just to the

 short way out into the water, and both from the smell and from the
 fish fragments lying about, obviously serves as a landing stage for
 the island’s fishermen.  No boats are tied up here at the moment, but
 there are several a short way out to sea in the bay.

 It would be an exaggeration to say that the smell of rotting fish is
 overpowering, since you are not overpowered by it, but it is certainly
 inescapable.

 This crossroads, at what may be the centre of the town, is formed by
 meeting of roads to north, south, east and west.  All four roads lead
 between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short,
 while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north

 A pair of granite cottages mark the northern edge of the town, the

 The bridge is narrow, but in a reasonable state of repair apart from
 the parapet, which is starting to crumble in places.  From the brow of

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Track</span>
 This short length of farm track comes to an end at the narrow stone
 bridge just to the south and peters out into open country a short way
 north.  Its main purpose seems to be to serve the large water-mill
 that stands immediately to the east.  On the opposite side of the
 track a stream flows briskly past to the south before turning east
 under the bridge; beyond the stream lurks the bulk of a massive hill,
 its face too steep to climb even if you could somehow cross the stream
 to reach it.

 The inside of the mill is dominated by a huge vertically-mounted iron
 cog wheel, which is currently stationary, and is connected via a
 series of lesser cogs to the upper of a pair of large
 horizontally-mounted millstones.  Next to the main cog is a long
 wooden lever, while a small metal wheel is mounted on the south wall.
 In the east wall is a small trapdoor, while the way out is to the

 It opens easily.  You peer through the trapdoor into a dark space
 which extends several yards beneath the level of the mill floor.  You

 small pile of grain at the bottom.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> <span class="floydstyle u2">north</span>   south   east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Track</span>
 This short length of farm track comes to an end at the narrow stone
 bridge just to the south and peters out into open country a short way
 north.  Its main purpose seems to be to serve the large water-mill
 that stands immediately to the east.  On the opposite side of the
 track a stream flows briskly past to the south before turning east
 under the bridge; beyond the stream lurks the bulk of a massive hill,
 its face too steep to climb even if you could somehow cross the stream
 to reach it.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> north   south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bridge</span>
 The bridge is narrow, but in a reasonable state of repair apart from
 the parapet, which is starting to crumble in places.  From the brow of
 the bridge you can see a stream racing eastwards to power a mill.  To
 the south the road runs back into town, while to the north it turns
 into a farm-track.

 The stone parapet runs at about chest height on both sides of the
 bridge; on both sides the top of the parapet is starting to crumble,
 and weeds are growing in the cracks.

 Only the top of the parapet is crumbling, the rest seems securely
 fixed to the bridge, and you have neither the strength nor the
 motivation to dislodge it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts of Town</span>
 A pair of granite cottages mark the northern edge of the town, the
 bulk of which lies to the south.  To the north the road crosses a
 small stone bridge, while a wide path winds up the grassy hill to the
 west.  The way east is barred by the impenetrable woodland behind the
 cottages.

 The two cottages here are rather larger than most of those in the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path Up Castle Hill</span>
 Half-way up the grassy hillside, the path up from the east turns
 sharply north as it continues up the slope.  The bend in the path
 affords an excellent view over the town below.

 From the vantage point of Castle Hill it becomes even more apparent
 that the town is little more than a collection of mean stone buildings
 arranged around the cross-shaped street layout.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Castle Hill</span>
 The top of Castle Hill affords an excellent view over much of the
 southern part of the island, but the view to the north is blocked by
 the castle, which occupies most of the space up here.  The archway
 leading into the castle lies directly to the north, while the path
 leading back down to the hill runs south.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> <span class="floydstyle u2">north</span>   south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Under the Arch</span>
 At first sight this archway is impressive; not only is it at least
 eight feet wide and twelve high, it’s a good nine feet deep,
 indicating the thickness of the wall at this point.  Its
 impressiveness as a piece of military architecture is, however,
 somewhat diminished once you notice the lack of anything that looks
 like a gate or portcullis.  Two pairs of rusty hinges embedded in the
 walls indicate where some gates might once have hung, and an equally
 rusty drum by the east wall looks as if it might once have been part
 of a mechanism for raising and lowering a portcullis.  The arch is
 oriented north-south, leading out of the castle to the south and into
 it to the north.

 A guard stands in the middle of the arch.

 The guard watches you depart.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Courtyard</span>
 Too small to count as a bailey, the courtyard is completely enclosed
 by the castle wall.  An archway leads out of the courtyard to the
 south, while to the north stands a misshapen keep.  What looks like a
 stable block rests against the western wall, and a long crude
 building, perhaps a barrack block for the castle guard, occupies the
 east wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall</span>
 This great hall has at least pretensions of grandeur.  For one thing,
 it is large and draughty.  For another, it is impressively bedecked
 with banners, shields, swords and even the odd suit of armour; but the
 impression made is of faded mediaeval glory rather than modern
 potency.  A wide staircase leads up to the north, and passages lead
 off to east and west, while the main exit is back out to the south.

 Duke William is standing in the middle of the hall, looking at you
 expectantly.

 “Lieutenant Corby, how good of you to call!” Lady Inalda declares.

 Turning to her cousin she adds, “William, this is the man I was
 telling you about – the one who rescued me earlier this morning.”

 The Duke eyes you carefully, then gives a curt nod.  “I see; then it
 would seem we owe you a debt of gratitude, lieutenant.  Lady Inalda
 tells me that you were washed ashore on this island only this morning;
 in that case I imagine you must be left destitute and without any
 means of supporting yourself; is that assumption correct?”

 (You could say yes or no, or tell him about Julia.)

 “Well, a kind young lady called Julia Trelawney found me on the
 shore,
 took me back to her house and not only gave me a bowl of hot soup to
 revive me, but a gold coin so I could stay at the Red Dragon Inn for a
 while,” you tell him, “Hopefully that should last me until I find a
 boat off the island and rejoin my ship.”

 “That was indeed kind of Miss Trelawney,” the Duke nods, “But
 there
 are no boats off this island, and one gold coin won’t keep you for
 long.  However, I may be able to improve your prospects, lieutenant;
 you could enter my service – you sound like the sort of man I could
 use.” He pauses for a brief moment to gauge your reaction, then adds,
 “But first I’d need some concrete pledge of loyalty.”

 (You could ask what he wants of you, or refuse.)

 “What do you want of me?” you ask.

 “You may have heard of the blight that’s afflicting this isle,”
 he
 begins.  “It’s causing food shortages, and that’s encouraging
 smuggling.  I have my suspicions about who’s behind it, but I need
 proof.  That’s where you come in, I want you to obtain proof of
 who’s
 behind this smuggling racket and then bring it to me.  Will you do
 that?”

 “Can you tell me more about this smuggling problem, your grace?”
 you
 ask.

 “Ideally, Valon should be self-sufficient,” he explains.  “We
 cannot
 rely on contact with the outside world to supply our needs.  Smuggling
 in goods from the outside – however desirable they may seem – only
 undermines our self-sufficiency.  Don’t think me an unreasonable man,
 lieutenant, I realize that the odd little luxury or two does no harm,
 but it’s grown too big, and it needs to be controlled.  So – will
 you

 “What’s being smuggled in?” you inquire.

 “Just about anything we can’t produce here,” he replies, “and

 some things we can.  Strong drink, cloth, metal goods, non-local
 foodstuffs – anything the scoundrels think they have a market for.
 It
 wouldn’t matter if it were just a trickle, but it’s become a flood!
 Anyway, I can’t imagine you’ll have much difficulty identifying

 “Perhaps some fool has told you she’s a witch, but that is just

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall</span>
 This great hall has at least pretensions of grandeur.  For one thing,
 it is large and draughty.  For another, it is impressively bedecked
 with banners, shields, swords and even the odd suit of armour; but the
 impression made is of faded mediaeval glory rather than modern
 potency.  A wide staircase leads up to the north, and passages lead
 off to east and west, while the main exit is back out to the south.

 Duke William stands in the middle of the hall, regarding you coolly.
 Lady Inalda meanwhile stands at your side, facing him.

 measure of protection against sword and mace, but not one of them
 would stop a musket ball.

 Duke William watches you leave.  Lady Inalda follows you out.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Courtyard</span>
 Too small to count as a bailey, the courtyard is completely enclosed
 by the castle wall.  An archway leads out of the courtyard to the
 south, while to the north stands a misshapen keep.  What looks like a
 stable block rests against the western wall, and a long crude
 building, perhaps a barrack block for the castle guard, occupies the
 east wall.

 Lady Inalda stops in the middle of the courtyard and motions you to
 join her.

 “A word, if you please, lieutenant,” she says.  “I don’t know
 whether
 you truly intend to do as my cousin asks, but perhaps there is
 something you might do for me.”

 (You could ask what she wants, or ask her about smuggling.)

>ask what she wants

 “What do you want of me, my lady?” you ask.

 “The most serious threat facing us right now is the blight,” she
 tells
 you.  “And it’s not just the food shortages, it is all that flows
 from
 them, as Cadan Pascoe’s attack this morning has brought home to me.
 Something must be <span class="floydstyle em">done</span> about it, but I feel so limited in
 what I can do without help.  You on the other hand – well, perhaps
 being new here and more knowledgeable about the world beyond Valon,
 perhaps you could go and take a look at the blight and see if you can
 tell what might be behind it.  And while you’re at it, perhaps you
 could see if you can make any sense of this.” She hands you a sheet
 of
 parchment.

 The parchment bears a poem that reads:

 “Where copper, iron and tin are found,
 and ores extracted underground,
 there is a path the mountain through,
 which can be found by purpose true:
 true as knight’s on holy quest,
 true as one who gives his best,
 true lies the route that shall not fail
 him who seeks the Holy Grail.”

 is,” she tells you.  “At least, I cannot see that any great harm is
 being done by it.”

 “Tell me, my lady, are there any Grail legends connected with this
 island?” you ask.

 “Funny you should ask that,” she replies.  “I vaguely recall
 hearing
 something as a child, but I never paid it much attention since; it
 just sounded too much like a child’s fairy-tale, or else a popular
 legend told by the inhabitants of a small island to make themselves
 feel important.  You know the sort of thing, the chalice Christ used
 at the Last Supper, the Holy Grail, passed through our blessed Isle of
 Valon.  I’m sure there’s nothing in it.”

 Lady Inalda has already told you that she vaguely recalls hearing some

 she dismisses it as a childish legend.  There seems no point in
 pursuing the subject any further with her.

 “You think this poem could indicate a way through the Ridge?” you
 suggest.

 “It does seem to suggest that, lieutenant,” she agrees, “but it

 but please don’t take any risks.  I want you to come back and tell me

 You’ve run out of things you can usefully ask her about the blight.
 She’s already indicated that in her view no one knows either its

 production and causing fear and hunger as a result.

 Too small to count as a bailey, the courtyard is completely enclosed
 by the castle wall.  An archway leads out of the courtyard to the

 The stable block is a low wooden building running along the inside of
 the west wall, and abutting the tower at the southwestern corner of
 the keep.

 The stubby round tower sticks up at the southwestern corner of the

 overlooks the courtyard.

 Either the keep was never completed, or parts have been added on
 almost at random, since the building (which in any case is probably
 little more than a glorified manor house) has a decidedly lopsided
 appearance.  The greatest affront to symmetry is the single round
 tower standing at the southwestern corner, but the entire building is
 ugly, though large, as if its designers couldn’t agree whether it was
 intended for defence, grandeur or comfort and accordingly botched all
 three objectives.

 The stubby round tower sticks up at the southwestern corner of the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Under the Arch</span>
 The archway is at least eight feet wide and twelve high.  It’s also a
 good nine feet deep, indicating the thickness of the wall at this
 point.  Two pairs of rusty hinges embedded in the walls indicate where
 some gates might once have hung, and an equally rusty drum by the east
 wall looks as if it might once have been part of a mechanism for
 raising and lowering a portcullis.  The arch is oriented north-south,
 leading out of the castle to the south and into it to the north.  But
 of the gate and portcullis themselves there is no sign.

 The guard stands in the middle of the arch.

 The guard eyes you suspiciously.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Castle Hill</span>
 The top of Castle Hill affords an excellent view over much of the
 southern part of the island, but the view to the north is blocked by
 the castle, which occupies most of the space up here.  The archway
 leading into the castle lies directly to the north, while the path
 leading back down to the hill runs south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path Up Castle Hill</span>
 Half-way up the grassy hillside, the path up from the east turns
 sharply north as it continues up the slope.  The bend in the path
 affords an excellent view over the town below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts of Town</span>
 A pair of granite cottages mark the northern edge of the town, the
 bulk of which lies to the south.  To the north the road crosses a
 small stone bridge, while a wide path winds up the grassy hill to the
 west.  The way east is barred by the impenetrable woodland behind the
 cottages.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Street</span>
 The street is narrow here, barely wide enough for two people to pass,
 and looks just as narrow as it continues to north and south.  An
 ancient stone chapel stands immediately to the east, opposite a
 terrace of mean little cottages hugging the west side of the street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Chapel</span>
 This little chapel is about as bare as a place of Christian worship
 gets.  The rough stone walls are unplastered, and the pews little more
 than plain wooden benches.  The stone altar at the east end is quite
 unadorned, although presumably something is put on it when worship is
 in progress.  The street exit is to the west, but another, smaller
 open doorway leads north.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> <span class="floydstyle u2">north</span>   west


 The altar is almost totally unadorned; presumably it is stripped bare
 between services.  An indication of its antiquity is not simply that
 it is made of stone, unlike the wooden communion tables of civilized
 Protestant churches, but that the faint carving on the front looks
 extremely worn.

 Although the carving is extremely faded, you can just discern the
 outline of a chalice of possibly ancient pattern.  Although this is by
 no means an inappropriate symbol for an altar it strikes you as a
 little unusual; if anything, you might have expected a cross.

 Clearly not designed for comfort, the pews are about as barely
 functional as plain wooden benches can be; about the one thing to be
 said in their favour is that it would be almost impossible to fall
 asleep on them however tedious the sermon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestry</span>
 This small chamber apparently does duty as dressing-room and office
 for the parish priest.  A row of cupboards, presumably containing
 vestments and altar furniture, lines the north wall, while a small
 desk nestles against the east one.  The way back into the chapel lies
 south, but a large wooden door leads west.  A small metal hook is set
 into the wall next to this door.

 A plain wooden chair rests by the desk.

 On the small wooden desk is a sermon.  On the hook is a large iron
 key.

 The priest is sitting working at his desk.  He looks up at your
 entrance and remarks, “So – another sinner come to join my
 flock!”

 He is a thin, austere man, dressed in a long black cassock.  A few
 wisps of white hair dangle about his scalp.  Piercing dark eyes stare
 out either side of a nose that’s as thin and sharp as a shark’s

 and there’s something tight and mean about his mouth.  He is sitting
 on the plain wooden chair.

 The priest is wearing a long black cassock.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> south   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>


 “What can you tell me about the blight?” you ask.

 “It’s causing terrible hardship here,” he replies.  “Life here
 is hard
 enough for most people as it is.  The loss of one of the island’s two
 farms has been a terrible blow.”

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> south   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>


 “Your chapel looks very ancient,” you remark.

 “I think it must be,” he agrees.  “I have kept it just as I found
 it,
 since the islanders feel it should be preserved just as it always has
 been, and no one can remember a time before it was here.”

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> south   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>


 “That’s an unusual carving on the front of your altar, isn’t
 it?” you
 remark.  “Some sort of chalice, isn’t it?  I’d have expected a
 cross.”

 “So would I – if that,” the priest concurs, “but then, the
 altar is
 very ancient, and the chalice is a symbol of Holy Communion.”

 “Who is this mad Meg person?” you want to know.

 “She is a creature of hell, an evil witch, born out of wedlock and
 possessed by demons,” the priest tells you, his eyes bulging with
 fury.  “If the blight is not due to her witchcraft it is God’s
 punishment for not putting her to death!”

 Without what you call ‘smuggling’ there’s many here who’d go

 “The Duke seems to think that there’s some smuggling going on,”
 you
 point out.

 “So you’ve been talking to the Duke!” he declares.  “It is only
 Duke
 William’s avarice that makes him speak of ‘smuggling’, by which
 he
 means that someone somewhere has the temerity to import what the rest
 of us need without donating the lion’s share to the castle coffers.
 Our Duke would store up treasure for himself here on earth while his
 subjects go hungry and naked.  You may guess what his heavenly reward
 may be!”

 “So you think that what the Duke calls ‘smuggling’ is simply the
 legitimate importation of goods that people here need,” you surmise.

 their lives are hard enough.”

 You seem to have exhausted this line of questioning for now.  It’s
 clear, if a little surprising, that Father Andrew approves of the
 so-called smuggling, and that he has little respect for the Duke’s
 attempts to suppress it.  In the priest’s view, the “smugglers”
 are
 simply alleviating the material hardship of the islanders’ lives.
 Father Andrew may well know who the smugglers are, but if so he’s not
 saying.

 “Excuse me,” you say.

 Father Andrew turns in his chair and looks up at you.  “Yes?” he
 asks.

 “Where can I find Mrs Pascoe?” you ask.

 “She’ll be working in the fish-house I imagine, down by the
 jetty,” he
 tells you.

 “What else can you tell me about this Meg person?” you ask.

 “She lives out of town, somewhere in the forest to the north, like
 the
 wild creature she is,” Father Andrew tells you.  “I tell you this,
 young man, if you want to atone for your past sins and escape the
 wrath of God, you must do what none of the sinners here have yet dared
 to do: confront the evil witch and put her to death!  Burning her at
 the stake would be proper, but I am sure that God in His mercy will
 find acceptable whatever means of putting her to death you can manage:
 ‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live!’”

 Father Andrew remains silent, merely raising one eyebrow as if to
 indicate that your question really wasn’t worth the bother of asking,
 let alone the bother of answering.

 “If this Meg is so obviously an evil witch, how come no one else
 wants
 to put her to death?” you ask.

 “The Duke will not allow it; he protects her,” Father Andrew tells
 you.  “If he knew his duty to God he would order her to be burned!
 But instead...”

 “Are you quite sure this Meg woman is a witch?” you ask.

 “Quite sure,” he nods emphatically.  “She has brought the blight
 upon
 us, and is constantly mixing potions and casting spells in that forest
 of hers.  Young man, seize this opportunity to save your soul: seek
 this woman out and slay her!”

 “What makes you so sure that it’s Meg who’s responsible for the
 blight?” you inquire.

 “You are new here, so I must make allowance for your questioning,”
 he
 replies.  “If you had been here as long as I, her guilt would be
 obvious to you.  Just ask the Pascoes, whose land was ruined by the
 blight.  Or go and look at the blighted land for yourself – it’s
 not
 far to walk.  I tell you, nothing natural can have caused the land to
 die like that, and there’s only one person on this island who
 practises witchcraft – that Meg!”

 “Wouldn’t killing mad Meg be a sin?” you wonder.  “‘Thou

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> south   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>


 “But is there any real evidence connecting this Meg with the
 blight?”
 you venture to ask.

 Father Andrew regards you steadily for a few moments, then replies,
 “If you want convincing, go and speak to Mrs Pascoe; she can tell her
 story better than I.”

 (You could ask him who Mrs Pascoe is.)

 You have heard enough of Father Andrew’s views on mad Meg: so far as
 he’s concerned she’s the worst sinner on the island, a witch who
 should not be allowed to live; killing her would, in his view,
 therefore help atone for your past sins.  He’s also told you that she
 lives in the forest to the north of town, and that (in his opinion)
 she’s demon-possessed and was born out of wedlock.  Finally, he
 suggests you speak to Mrs Pascoe about her.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> south   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>


 “Who is this Mrs Pascoe?” you ask.

 “Her husband had a farm up just south of the Ridge,” he explains.
 “Mad Meg used to live with them.  When they realized she was a witch,
 they threw her out.  It was shortly after then that the blight came,
 but it was only their land that was affected.  In the end they had to
 leave the farm – nothing could live there.  They were left absolutely
 destitute, of course.  Now Jennifer Pascoe has been reduced to gutting
 fish while her husband mends the fishermen’s nets.”

 “How long have you been on the island; were you born here?” you
 ask.

 “No, I wasn’t born here,” he tells you.  “I was on a ship that
 foundered, and fetched up here about twenty years ago,” he replies.

 “What did you do before you came to this island?” you wonder.

 “I was a chaplain to Cromwell’s army,” he tells you, “but when
 the
 Restoration came it seemed politic to go elsewhere.  The wind of
 change that blew in Charles II wasn’t going to be kind to my sort.”

 You refrain from pointing out that he seems to be referring to events
 145 years ago, suspecting that he might not be quite right in the
 head.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> south   <span class="floydstyle u2">west</span>


 He’s already told you a bit about himself: as part of his priestly
 duties he prays for the islanders and visits the sick; he came here
 about twenty years ago when his ship foundered.  He says he had been a
 chaplain to Cromwell’s forces and was fleeing England at the
 Restoration; since Charles II came to the throne 145 years ago this
 hardly seems likely, so you decide to stop pressing him any further,
 in case he’s a little unhinged.

 “Did you say you were a chaplain to <span class="floydstyle em">Cromwell’s</span> army?  Do
 you
 mean Oliver Cromwell?” you ask.

 “That’s right; what other Cromwell had an army?  Surely not Thomas!
 But I know why you look so askance at the thought - you’re a
 royalist!
 Well, you and I shall never agree on that score, but such differences
 are of little moment here, so perhaps we should let the matter drop.”

 When you asked he confirmed that he was indeed a chaplain to Oliver
 Cromwell’s army, but seemed to think that the only reason you queried
 it was because your sympathies are royalist.  He can’t possibly be
 that old, of course, but in the face of his assertions there seems
 nothing for it but to accept his suggestion to let the matter drop.

 suggested that the way to cure the blight is to remove its cause,
 namely Meg, and that you would do both God and the islanders a service
 by killing her.

 Father Andrew turns back to his desk and resumes work on his sermon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Chapel</span>
 This little chapel is about as bare as a place of Christian worship
 gets.  The rough stone walls are unplastered, and the pews little more
 than plain wooden benches.  The stone altar at the east end is quite
 unadorned, although presumably something is put on it when worship is
 in progress.  The street exit is to the west, but another, smaller
 open doorway leads north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Street</span>

 ancient stone chapel stands immediately to the east, opposite a
 terrace of mean little cottages hugging the west side of the street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 This crossroads, at what may be the centre of the town, is formed by
 meeting of roads to north, south, east and west.  All four roads lead
 between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short,
 while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north
 and south look as if they run on quite a way, but just a short way to
 the south you can see a hanging inn-sign.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Street</span>

 cottages.  The street continues to north and south over well-worn
 cobbles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steep Track</span>
 Leading down from the town to the north towards a stone jetty to the

 the edge of the barren scrubland that extends to the east.  A narrow
 side-track runs off through a thicket to the southwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scrubland</span>
 This large area of scrubland slopes down alongside a steep track to
 the west, and ends at clifftops to northeast and southeast.  The area
 is deserted and little grows here but some scraggy grass, impoverished
 by the thin, stony soil.  A long wooden fence runs along much of the
 northern boundary of this largely wasted space, but otherwise it is
 open to the elements.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Jetty</span>
 The steep track from the north comes to an end at this bleak stone
 jetty, which is flanked by a large wooden building to the east and the
 beach stretching out along the bay to the west.  The jetty juts just a
 short way out into the water, and both from the smell and from the
 fish fragments lying about, obviously serves as a landing stage for
 the island’s fishermen.  No boats are tied up here at the moment, but
 there are several a short way out to sea in the bay.

 It would be an exaggeration to say that the smell of rotting fish is
 overpowering, since you are not overpowered by it, but it is certainly
 inescapable.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fish House</span>
 The fish house looks as much like a long wooden shed from the inside
 as it does from the outside.  A pair of long wooden benches run along
 the walls, covered in fish in various stages of being processed.  The
 way out is back to the west.

 A large group of women are at work gutting fish.

 The woman working closest to the entrance keeps throwing odd glances

 You doubt any useful purpose will be served by pursuing this topic
 with her.  It’s clear she thinks Meg is a witch, partly because she
 thinks Meg bewitched her son into having sexual intercourse with her
 (so far as you can gather from her slightly confused account) but
 mainly because she thinks Meg cursed her husband’s land and brought
 the blight upon it.

 “What can you tell me about the blight?” you ask.

 “It destroyed us, that’s what!” she snaps.  “A slow creeping
 death,
 bit by bit.  It killed the land – you must know that – but it
 nearly
 killed us too, and I don’t just mean the near starvation.  In the
 last
 year before we had to move out, we all felt sickly and weak – my hair
 even started to fall out.  If we hadn’t gone when we did, we’d have
 ended up like the soil!”

 “Do you have any ideas what might have caused the blight?” you ask.

 “I know exactly what caused it, it were that witch – mad Meg!”
 she
 declares.  “The girl put a curse on our land, that’s what did it.
 If
 you don’t believe, just ask yourself this: why did the blight stop
 after destroying our farm – why was it only our land that was
 destroyed?”

 She’s already given you her opinion: she thinks the blight is the

 the life-force out of everything.

 The fish house looks as much like a long wooden shed from the inside
 as it does from the outside.  A pair of long wooden benches run along
 the walls, covered in fish in various stages of being processed.  The
 way out is back to the west.

 A large group of women are at work gutting fish.

 Jennifer Pascoe resumes sorting through her pile of fish.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Jetty</span>
 The steep track from the north comes to an end at this bleak stone
 jetty, which is flanked by a large wooden building to the east and the
 beach stretching out along the bay to the west.  The jetty juts just a
 short way out into the water, and both from the smell and from the
 fish fragments lying about, obviously serves as a landing stage for
 the island’s fishermen.  No boats are tied up here at the moment, but
 there are several a short way out to sea in the bay.

 It would be an exaggeration to say that the smell of rotting fish is
 overpowering, since you are not overpowered by it, but it is certainly
 inescapable.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East End of Bay</span>
 The beach comes to an end at the stone jetty which lies just to the

 to the northwest, while a narrow track runs up through a thicket to
 the northeast.  A little way out to sea is a fleet of fishing boats.

 A large, if motley, collection of boats stands out a short way from
 shore in the sea.  The nets hanging over the sides of the nearest
 boats make it quite obvious that they are engaged in fishing.
 Clearly, not all the island’s fishermen are busily engaged in

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steep Track</span>
 Leading down from the town to the north towards a stone jetty to the

 the edge of the barren scrubland that extends to the east.  A narrow
 side-track runs off through a thicket to the southwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Middle of Bay</span>
 The beach stretches away to both northwest and southeast from here,
 its approximate mid-point.  A short way to the north the ground climbs
 sharply up a hill, while out to sea a collection of fishing-boats is
 stretched out across the bay.

 A small green toolbox lies on the beach beside a fishing net.

 The small green toolbox contains a screwdriver.

 you can go up a hill to the east, while the beach continues to the

 The cliff is like a bony finger thrust out into the sea; more
 prosaically it’s a narrow rocky promontory that blocks the way north,
 too high and too steep to climb.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Summit</span>
 The summit of this low hill is fairly flat, and continues to the
 northwest.  To the north, it descends quite rapidly into a hollow,
 while to south and east it slopes down towards the beach, and grass
 gives way to sand.  To the east are the faint traces of the track
 which become a street running back down towards the centre of the
 town.  Although you’re not that high up, you get a clear view over
 the
 sea from here, truncated by the ever-present mist.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Hill</span>
 This looks like the roughest part of town, with the road surface
 equally pitted up the hill to the west and down to the east.  The
 cottages on either side of the street look more thrown together than
 built, being rough and tiny.

 To the east the street is fairly level, but a short distance to the

 between a small bakery to the north, and a narrow alley to the south.

 This small back yard is walled in on all sides, although a narrow
 alley runs off to the north, and the back door to the tavern lies
 east.  Next to the back door is the mouth of a chute, which is
 presumably to allow beer barrels to be rolled down into the cellar
 beneath.

 Several barrels are stacked in a corner of the yard.

 “So you’re the island’s baker,” you surmise.

 “You’re baking a batch of bread?” you surmise.

 “That’s right,” he says, “for the castle.  The Duke insists
 that the
 castle must come first, and I’m so short of flour... well, I’m so
 short of flour I’d give a silver coin for a sackful now, I would.”

 “Wait!” he interrupts you, sniffing the air.  “Canst thou smell

 “What was your ship like?” you ask.

 “Well, sir, I was the cook rather than the captain, if thou seest my
 meaning, so I cannot give thee every nautical detail, but she was a
 new ship and a fast one, smaller than the Spaniards, and able to show
 them a clean pair of heels after snapping at them – and her cannon
 packed quite a bite!” he tells you.

 “What do you think of Duke William?” you ask.

 “Do you know anything about the woman they call mad Meg?” you ask.

 “Well, they do say she’s a witch,” he replies, “and many there

 only set eyes on her once or twice; she be comely enough, but strange

 “So tell me, as one seaman to another, is there any sea-going
 activity
 of any sort round here – apart from fishing?” you ask.

 there’s not many round here takes to boats for pleasure!”

 “I had heard there were smugglers at work,” you tell him.  “If
 that’s
 true then there must be some way through the mist.”

 “Thou art right this far: there could be no one smuggling without
 getting through that stuff,” he agrees.

 There’s a strong smell of baking bread.

 “So, do you know of any smuggling round here?” you ask him.

 “Now, what would I want with smugglers?” he retorts.  “Joe Fanton
 grows the corn, it gets ground in the mill, and I bake it into bread
 here, with no shortage of people willing to buy.  There’s no
 smuggling
 in any of that – all home grown and home produced.”

 “People often want more than bread,” you point out.  “Maybe other
 things are brought in from the outside?”

 “Maybe,” he replies.  “Man shall not live by bread alone, as
 Moses

 You decide to drop the subject; if Alan Biddock knows anything about
 any smuggling he’s clearly not willing to tell you about it; about
 the
 only thing he’s possibly let slip is that anyone who is smuggling
 would have to have found a way through the “enchanted” mist
 that’s
 keeping everyone else confined to the island.

 “What do you make of Father Andrew?” you ask.

 “A bit too Protestant for my taste,” he replies, “but then I

 “So how long have you been on this island?” you ask.

 “Ah – must be nigh on ten years now,” he replies, scratching his

 “I’m also a seaman; Lieutenant Corby, of the <span class="floydstyle em">Niobe</span>,” you
 tell

 You’re not sure what more you can ask him after his last answer.
 He’s
 already told you that he was a ship’s cook before he fell overboard
 in
 a storm and, after being washed ashore, became the island’s baker;
 but
 he went on to suggest that he was a cook in the fleet that fought the
 Spanish Armada, which seems so implausible that you hardly know what
 to think.

 Alan Biddock gives you a curt nod and returns to his oven.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Street</span>
 To the east the street is fairly level, but a short distance to the
 west it starts to climb a shallow hill.  At this point the street runs
 between a small bakery to the north, and a narrow alley to the south.

 The smell of baking bread wafts from the bakery.

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> north   south   east   west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 This crossroads, at what may be the centre of the town, is formed by
 meeting of roads to north, south, east and west.  All four roads lead
 between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short,
 while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north
 and south look as if they run on quite a way, but just a short way to
 the south you can see a hanging inn-sign.

>go north
 North Street                                                    5/550
 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> north   south   east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Street</span>
 The street is narrow here, barely wide enough for two people to pass,
 and looks just as narrow as it continues to north and south.  An
 ancient stone chapel stands immediately to the east, opposite a
 terrace of mean little cottages hugging the west side of the street.

>go north

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> north   south   west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts of Town</span>
 A pair of granite cottages mark the northern edge of the town, the
 bulk of which lies to the south.  To the north the road crosses a
 small stone bridge, while a wide path winds up the grassy hill to the
 west.  The way east is barred by the impenetrable woodland behind the
 cottages.

>go north
 Bridge                                                          5/552
 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> north   south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bridge</span>
 The bridge is narrow, but in a reasonable state of repair apart from
 the parapet, which is starting to crumble in places.  From the brow of
 the bridge you can see a stream racing eastwards to power a mill.  To
 the south the road runs back into town, while to the north it turns
 into a farm-track.

>go north
 Farm Track                                                      5/553
 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> <span class="floydstyle u2">north</span>   south   east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Track</span>
 This short length of farm track comes to an end at the narrow stone
 bridge just to the south and peters out into open country a short way
 north.  Its main purpose seems to be to serve the large water-mill
 that stands immediately to the east.  On the opposite side of the
 track a stream flows briskly past to the south before turning east
 under the bridge; beyond the stream lurks the bulk of Castle Hill, its
 face too steep to climb even if you could somehow cross the stream to
 reach it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wheat Field</span>
 Ripe wheat sways gently in the breeze the length and breadth of this
 large level field.  Some way off to the west lies a farmyard, while
 directly to the east stands a large wood.  To the north the field
 eventually runs into open pasture; to the south, a rough farm track
 leads back towards the town.

 A farmer is at work, harvesting the wheat with a scythe.

 “Do you have any ideas what the blight might be, or what caused
 it?”
 you inquire.

 Joe Fanton shakes his head.  “I never saw the likes of it before, I
 can tell you that.  At first we thought it was hard winters, but it
 affected Pascoe’s crops more’an mine, and that made no sense.  Then
 we
 thought his crops had got some kind o’ plant disease, so we called it
 the blight.  But it’s pretty obviously the soil that’s sick, like
 it’s
 had all the goodness drained out of it, and I can’t think of anything
 that would do that.”

 “What’s your opinion of Cadan Pascoe?” you inquire.

 “A bit of a wild lad, but hard-working enough,” he tells you.
 “He
 always pulled his weight on his father’s farm – looked forward to
 running it himself one day, I’ll be bound.  I think he took it even
 harder than his parents when the blight drove them off.  But I don’t
 feel that sorry for him, to be honest; I never really took to him, see
 – there’s something not right about him.”

 “Did you know Cadan Pascoe attacked Lady Inalda earlier today?” you

 He’s already told you that he considers Cadan Pascoe to be
 hard-working; he pulled his weight on his father’s farm, and probably
 looked forward to running it himself one day; he took it even harder
 than his parents when the blight forced them to leave.  Joe Fanton
 thinks Cadan Pascoe has a wild streak, but was surprised to learn that
 he’s gone as far as attacking Lady Inalda.  But even before you told
 Joe Fanton about the attack on Lady Inalda he said he thought there
 was something not quite right about Cadan.

 Joe Fanton has probably told you as much about the blight as he can:
 he says it ruined Pascoe’s land but spared his, that it at first

 “Have you ever known Meg do any witch-like things, like casting
 spells?” you ask.

 “Well – no, but then I’m not sure I’d know a witch’s spell if
 I saw
 one,” he confesses, “but she is mighty strange, that I can tell
 you.
 It’s not natural for a young woman to live all her own in a wood,
 keeping out of folks’ way.  And the way she’s been spending her
 time
 lately – well!” he shakes his head.

 “How has Meg been spending her time lately?” you ask.

 “Up at Pascoe’s farm – or what’s left of it,” he tells you.
 “I know
 she was raised there, and I know she left under a cloud, but there’s
 nothing left there now but dead soil and dust, so what she can be
 spending all that time there for...” he shakes his head and sighs,
 “Well, it seems mighty strange to me, but I often see her go up that
 way.”

 You can’t think of anything else to ask him about her right now:
 he’s
 told you that some think her a witch, and some a healer, and though he
 doesn’t know one way or the other, he feels it best to play safe and
 stay clear of her.  He’s never seen Meg cast a spell or do anything
 obviously witch-like, but then he’s not sure he’d recognize it if
 he
 did.  He does think her rather odd, both because she lives all alone
 in the wood, and because she’s spending a lot of time up at
 Pascoe’s
 farm, even though there’s nothing left there now but a barren waste.

 “Does anyone use the mill?” you ask.  “It looked deserted when I
 visited it earlier!”

 “That’s probably because the miller has virtually no grain left to
 mill until I get the harvest in,” Joe Fanton explains, “so
 there’s not
 much for him to do there.  He also has a boat, so he’s probably out
 fishing.”

 “Will you have a good grain harvest this year, do you think?” you
 ask.

 “Good enough,” he replies.  “At least, good enough for normal
 times –
 enough to feed half the island, give or take.  Not enough to make up
 for the lack of Pascoe’s grain, though.”

 Ripe wheat sways gently in the breeze the length and breadth of this
 large level field.  Some way off to the west lies a farmyard, while
 directly to the east stands a large wood.  To the north the field
 eventually runs into open pasture; to the south, a rough farm track
 leads back towards the town.

 Joe Fanton is resting on his scythe, waiting for you to speak.

 Joe Fanton resumes his reaping.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Yard</span>
 The yard is an expanse of dried mud open to the east, but enclosed on
 the other three sides.  To the west stands a large old farmhouse,
 while an equally antiquated barn lies to the south.  A thick hedgerow
 runs along the north side, but a wooden gate half-way along allows
 access through.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Barn</span>
 Apart from a row of wooden casks along the south wall the barn seems
 strangely empty; presumably it’ll fill up more after the harvest, but
 right now it’s just a large empty space, about forty feet long by
 fifteen wide.  The only way out is through the door to the north.

 A long wooden ladder leans against a wall.

 At a rough estimate this field must be a couple of acres.  It is

 but there are gates through the hedges to north, south, east and west.

 A herd of cows is gathered at one end of the field.

 You’ve spent too much of your life at sea to be any kind of expert on
 cattle, so you’ve no way of identifying the breed.  It does occur to

 be a bull or two around, so although these cows look placid enough,

 You’re not sure that this pasture is actually four acres, but that

 leads eastwards into the forest while a wooden gate allows passage
 west through the hedgerow.

 A flock of sheep is grazing here.

 Every time you approach him to speak with him, the young shepherd
 retreats to the opposite side of the field.

 Some of the sheep move a little way across the field.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overgrown Forest Track</span>
 This narrow track is in some danger of becoming overgrown.  It is

 quite impossible to proceed in any other direction.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Broad Forest Path</span>
 The main path leads north and south through the forest; it’s easily
 wide enough for three or four people to walk abreast.  A much narrower
 track runs off to the west, so overgrown that it would be quite easy
 to miss.  An equally narrow track sneaks off to the east.

 leads back towards the town.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Orchard</span>
 It can hardly be an accident that apple trees predominate in this
 area, so presumably it was once planned as an orchard, although it now
 seems more like a southern extension of the wood.  It is perhaps the
 spread of undergrowth that creates the impression of a gradual return
 to nature; although sporadic attempts have been made to clear it to
 ease access to the trees, elsewhere it grows thick, tangled and
 impenetrable, with the result that though the trees are widely spaced
 you can only go through them to north, south or east.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Bank of Stream</span>
 The stream runs swiftly by towards the east, racing away from the
 large mill, the back end of which effectively blocks your path west.
 A short way back from the stream to the north lies a large orchard –
 or at least, a large number of apple trees forming the southern end of
 the wood.  You can follow the bank a short way to the east, but only
 until the stream begins plunging down its final descent into the sea,
 so you will effectively be diverted to the northeast.

 The stream descends a sharp fall to the west, and then continues to

 count as a small river.

 This must once have been part of the forest that you can see to the
 south, but this section is now dead.  Lifeless stumps protrude from
 the sickly soil, surrounded by fallen trunks and branches, all alike
 leeched a pale grey as if turned to ash by some terrible fire.  But
 there are no scorch marks or other signs of burning, so you’re sure
 no
 flames caused this.  The ground has been half cleared, perhaps with
 the most usable of the dead wood taken for kindling, but there’s been
 no systematic attempt to clear the area; given the sorry state of the
 soil there’d be no point.  The barren land continues to east and
 west,
 while a path leads due south into the still living forest.

 The barren stumps, which are starting to rot, are all that’s left of

 “Perhaps it’s for the best,” she replies.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Small Bay</span>
 The water lapping the sand seems to be the only thing moving here;
 just about everything else is as dead as the wasteland lying directly
 east, unless you count the few feeble strands of seaweed dying on the
 rocks.  To the northeast the bay ends in a treacherous-looking marsh,
 while to the south it is bounded by a cliff jutting out into the sea.
 The slope up to the cliff-top looks a relatively easy climb.

 The odour of rotting seaweed assaults your nostrils.

 You’ve spent enough of your life at sea scarcely to notice how it
 smells usually, but this sea smells distinctive, and somehow
 <span class="floydstyle em">wrong</span>.  It’s hard to put your finger on it precisely: it
 smells salty as you would expect, but there’s something else, the
 kind
 of sharp, bitter smell – almost a taste – that you’d associate
 with a
 brewing thunderstorm were there any other sign of a storm brewing, but
 there isn’t, and even then it’s not <span class="floydstyle em">quite</span> that smell
 either.
 Your eyes are drawn to the mist a few hundred yards out from shore, as

 You scramble up the slope and arrive at the cliff-top.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West Cliff</span>
 Although there is no clear boundary between this irregular area and
 the large field of barley lying directly to the east, no attempt has
 been made to cultivate this broad stretch of land at the top of the
 cliff, and it has instead been left to wild grass and weeds.  To a
 first approximation this clifftop is a semicircle overlooking the sea
 to the west and small bays to north and south, both of which look
 accessible down reasonably gentle slopes.

 High cliffs hem in this cove on every side except the west, which is

 narrow cave entrance to the southeast.

 A mass of slimy green seaweed lies on the shore.

 'Cave' is almost an exaggeration; this space is little more than a
 hollow in the rock with barely enough room to stand.  It’s not quite
 true to say that you could touch opposite walls of the cave with arms
 outstretched, but it’s not far from the truth.  The way back out is
 to
 the northwest, while a narrow tunnel at the rear of the cave runs off
 to the southeast.

 The lamp starts to flicker.

 You’re no farmer, but it looks to you as if the barley is starting to

 longer forms a barrier to progress north, while a wooden gate allows

 This was obviously the centre of what was once a farm; an abandoned

 If anything once grew here there’s no sign of it now; the barren,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foothills</span>
 These foothills are not particularly high, but they rise well above
 the level of the vast barren plain to the south.  Compared with the
 mountain range to the north they are mere molehills, however.  The
 mountains look as if they would be exceedingly hard to climb, and
 there’s no way you could attack the face immediately to the north,
 but
 there are possible ways up to northeast and northwest; alternatively
 you can return to the plain to the south or southeast.

 The northern end of the plain is a grey barren waste, almost
 featureless apart from an abandoned farmhouse.  Further to the
 southwest lie the neat square fields of a still working farm, opposite
 a band of dark green woodland to the southeast.  Beyond the woodland
 you can just make out parts of a stream and a tiny building that must
 be the mill.  In the far distance Castle Hill rises up out of the
 plain to dominate the southern part of the island.  From this great
 height you can just make out the castle complex on top of the hill.

 These foothills are not particularly high, but they rise well above

 mountain range to the north they are mere molehills, however.  The
 mountains look as if they would be exceedingly hard to climb, and
 there’s no way you could attack the face immediately to the north,
 but
 there are possible ways up to northeast and northwest; alternatively
 you can return to the plain to the south or southeast.

 If anything once grew here there’s no sign of it now; the barren,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Four Acre Pasture</span>
 The pasture is open to north and south, but is bounded by a hedgerow

 A flock of sheep is grazing here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Track</span>
 This short length of farm track comes to an end at the narrow stone
 bridge just to the south and peters out into open country a short way
 north.  Its main purpose seems to be to serve the large water-mill
 that stands immediately to the east.  On the opposite side of the
 track a stream flows briskly past to the south before turning east
 under the bridge; beyond the stream lurks the bulk of Castle Hill, its
 face too steep to climb even if you could somehow cross the stream to
 reach it.

 The bridge is narrow, but in a reasonable state of repair apart from

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts of Town</span>
 A pair of granite cottages mark the northern edge of the town, the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 This crossroads, at what may be the centre of the town, is formed by
 meeting of roads to north, south, east and west.  All four roads lead
 between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short,
 while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north

 the south you can see a hanging inn-sign.

 A furiously barking little dog comes yapping up to you, then

 “Do you know anything about any smuggling going on round here?” you

 “I know that pretty much everyone round here – the Duke included
 –
 depends on the goods the smugglers bring in,” she tells you.

 I’m just

 “No, I don’t fancy being the Duke’s spy; I’m a naval officer,
 loyal to
 King George, not some dukeling’s lackey.”

 “No, not really,” you admit, “He said smuggling is damaging the
 local
 economy, but it seems to me that it’s the blight that’s doing
 that.”

 “Quite so,” she agrees.  “As I see it, the Duke doesn’t want to
 suppress the smuggling at all; he simply wants to control it.  Even he
 can see that we couldn’t cope here at all without the stuff the
 smugglers bring in.  The Duke just wants the profits for himself.
 Anything else he told you is just so much baloney.”

 “I don’t suppose you have any ideas on how I could go about finding
 out who the smugglers are,” you ask.

 “I thought you said you weren’t going to act as the Duke’s
 spy,” she
 points out.  “But still, I suppose whoever’s doing it has to land
 the
 goods somewhere – probably somewhere as remote as possible, which
 probably means one of those coves up in the wastelands, just this side
 of the Ridge.  I suppose you could go up there now and root around for
 clues – marks in the sand, that kind of thing – but they probably
 operate at night, so when you’ve found the likeliest spot you’d
 need
 to wait there all night to see if you can catch the smugglers at it.”

 “Does this island really <span class="floydstyle em">need</span> a duke to rule it?” you
 wonder.

 “That’s a good question,” she agrees.  “Of course the Ducs de
 Valon,
 as they like to call themselves, have always claimed to bring the
 benefits of law and order to the island.  Perhaps there’s an element
 of truth to that, but their idea of law and order seems to be mostly
 duties and taxes.”

 “What else can you tell me about Duke William?” you ask.

 “I suppose he’s kind of handsome, in an arrogant aristocratic sort
 of
 way,” she tells you, “though his cousin, Lady Inalda, is a real
 beauty.  Don’t go getting any ideas there though – William fancies
 her
 for himself.” She shakes her head, “Too much inbreeding in that

 “Is Duke William such a bad ruler?” you ask.

 “He’s not a tyrant – he doesn’t rape and murder the serfs, if
 that’s
 what you mean,” she replies, “but I can’t honestly say he does a
 lot
 of good, either.  I wouldn’t go so far myself, but I have heard some
 people call him a parasite.”

 “There aren’t any Jacobins here, I hope!” you declare.

 “Jacobins?” she queries.  “Oh no, we’re quite isolated from
 events in
 France!”

 You decide to leave that topic alone for now.  You’ve already
 gathered
 that Julia isn’t that impressed with Duke William, without actually
 calling him a bad ruler.

>ask about inalda

 “Tell me about Lady Inalda,” you say.

 “She’s the daughter of the Duke’s uncle – the old Duke’s
 brother, that
 is.” she tells you.  “She’s said to be the most beautiful woman
 on the
 island, and maybe she is.  But as for what she’s like underneath –
 I
 really don’t know.  She always seems a bit aloof to me.”

 “What else can you tell me about the beautiful Inalda?” you
 enquire.

 “What’s to say?  Her mother is meant to be still alive – but
 apparently she’s a bed-ridden invalid and hasn’t been seen outside
 the
 castle in years.” Julia informs you.  “As for Inalda, half the men
 on
 the island seem to fancy her, but she never shows much in return; if
 she has a heart, she certainly doesn’t wear it on her sleeve.”

>ask about inalda

 “And will Inalda wed her cousin?” you wonder.

 “He wants it.  What she wants is something she keeps to herself,”
 Julia replies.

 There doesn’t seem too much more to ask at this stage, and you
 don’t
 want to give Julia the impression that you’ve become fixated on
 Inalda.  It’s clear enough that Julia regards the Duke’s cousin as
 a
 rather remote figure, an enigmatic beauty perhaps.  It seems the Duke
 wants to marry her, but Julia doesn’t seem to know what Inalda wants.

 “When I went into town I found Cadan Pascoe attacking Lady Inalda!”

 “Yes, she was fine,” you reply.

 “Well, I trust she was suitably grateful!” Julia remarks.

 The parlour is of a good size, but not so big as to forfeit a certain

 Julia comes with you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen is quite large, and conveys something of the same rustic
 flavour as the parlour, which lies just to the south.  A plain wooden
 door, painted black, is set in the north wall next to a large
 wood-burning stove.  An even larger wooden table occupies most of the
 space in the middle of the kitchen, together with a conveniently
 placed wooden chair.

 “Well, bye for now then; no doubt I shall see you again soon,”
 Julia
 bids you farewell.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 Most of this sizeable garden is given over to vegetable plots.  To the
 east it comes to an abrupt end overlooking the cove, accessible via a
 rough flight of stone steps.  At its northern end stands a large stone
 house, from the front of which a gravel path heads off to the west,
 while along the garden’s southern boundary runs a long wooden fence.

 Julia closes the front door from the other side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Long Gravel Path</span>
 The main path continues to east and west as far as you can see, rising
 slightly to the latter as it heads inland.  A long hedge blocks the
 way south, but just at this point of the path a rutted track runs off
 to the north.

 You set off to the west, and after a brisk walk up the slope you find
 yourself on the eastern outskirts of the town.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">East Street</span>
 Pressed in between a rough stone wall to the north and a small shop to
 the south this short, narrow street runs east back towards the coast
 and west towards the centre of town.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> north   south   east   west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 This crossroads, at what may be the centre of the town, is formed by
 meeting of roads to north, south, east and west.  All four roads lead
 between grim, grey buildings; the road to the east looks quite short,
 while that to the west leads up a distant hill.  The roads to north
 and south look as if they run on quite a way, but just a short way to
 the south you can see a hanging inn-sign.

 Two men smelling strongly of fish stride past to the south.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Street</span>
 The west side of this long, grubby street is dominated by the Red
 Dragon Inn, while on the opposite side squats a row of bleak stone
 cottages.  The street continues to north and south over well-worn
 cobbles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steep Track</span>
 Leading down from the town to the north towards a stone jetty to the
 south, this steep track is little more than a well-trodden path along
 the edge of the barren scrubland that extends to the east.  A narrow
 side-track runs off through a thicket to the southwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scrubland</span>
 This large area of scrubland slopes down alongside a steep track to
 the west, and ends at clifftops to northeast and southeast.  The area
 is deserted and little grows here but some scraggy grass, impoverished
 by the thin, stony soil.  A long wooden fence runs along much of the
 northern boundary of this largely wasted space, but otherwise it is
 open to the elements.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cliff Top (South)</span>
 This must be the southeastern tip of the island, thrusting out just a
 short way into the sea, only a dozen feet below to east and south.
 Immediately to the west you look down on the roof of the fish house,
 with the jetty a little way beyond and the beach further in the
 distance.  The only way inland lies to the northwest, while the cliff
 top continues to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cliff Top (North)</span>
 From up here on the cliff you have a spectacular view over the sea a
 hundred feet below, but as ever it’s cut short by the mist a few
 hundred yards out from the shore.  You can also see down into a cove
 to the north, although there’s no way to reach it from here.  But
 perhaps the most striking feature of this part of the cliff is the
 thick grass that covers it; something about the soil causes it to grow
 in a spectrum of greens from almost yellow to virtually turquoise,
 creating an effect akin to a patterned carpet.  The cliff top
 continues to the south, while to the southwest lies a large expanse of
 scrubland.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cliff Top (North)</span>
 From up here on the cliff you have a spectacular view over the sea a
 hundred feet below, but as ever it’s cut short by the mist a few
 hundred yards out from the shore.  You can also see down into a cove
 to the north, although there’s no way to reach it from here.  But
 perhaps the most striking feature of this part of the cliff is the
 thick grass that covers it; something about the soil causes it to grow
 in a spectrum of greens from almost yellow to virtually turquoise,
 creating an effect akin to a patterned carpet.  The cliff top
 continues to the south, while to the southwest lies a large expanse of
 scrubland.

 You can’t go that way.  Obvious exits lead south, back to the
 southern
 end of the cliff top; and southwest.

 You are carrying a plain brass key, a flint, a brass lamp, a bunch of
 flowers, an old sheet of parchment, a flat square stone, and a bunch
 of blackberries.

 The flowers have quite a sweet, delicate scent.

 Blighted IsleYour part in Napoleon's downfall is about to come to an
 untimely end.

 The storm raging across the Bay of Biscay has forced Cornwallis to
 stand out to sea, giving an opportunity for a French captain with more
 daring than most to try to slip past the blockade.  While Nelson is
 chasing Villeneuve across the Atlantic, the Channel fleet is closely
 blockading Brest to ensure that Ganteaume can't escape to join him; if
 he did Bonaparte's invasion plans would perilously close to fruition.

 In the meantime, you are left swimming around in the Bay of Biscay.  It
 can't be more than a couple of minutes before you drown.  For a moment,
 you almost imagine you see the inscription on your own grave:

 R.I.P.  Lieutenant James Corby, RN
 1780 - 1805
 Lost at sea in the service of his country
 (mainly as a result of his own clumsiness)

 The storm-tossed waves thunder all around you.  The Niobe is nowhere in
 sight; neither is that other ship.  The sky is so black that even
 without the salt water stinging your eyes you could scarcely see a
 thing.  Already your sea-soaked clothes are starting to drag you under,
 and you feel so very, very cold.  It would be so much easier to give up
 the futile struggle, to accept the sea's icy embrace, and yield to the
 everlasting sleep of your watery grave.  For surely there can be no
 hope of rescue now.

 And yet it was only a moment ago that you took your unplanned tumble
 over the side of the ship.








 Blighted IsleTing!  Ting!  Two bells in the middle watch: ten hours
 since sighting the strange sail and giving chase.

 It wasn't yet clear that the strange sail was a French warship, but
 your captain was taking no chances, and so the Niobe, 38, had set off
 in hot pursuit.  She was carrying all the sail a frigate safely could
 in such a storm, but still the strange vessel was maintaining its lead,
 and it was all the Niobe could do to keep pace with her.  But the
 weather had been steadily worsening; the storm was becoming a gale, and
 there was a real danger that the Niobe would lose a spar - or worse -
 unless she shortened sail.  So you dispatched the midshipman of the
 watch to seek the captain's permission to do just that.

 And then came the totally unexpected hail from the masthead:

 "Land ho!  Fine on the starboard bow!"

 That was absurd; there shouldn't have been any land within a dozen
 leagues.

 Quarterdeck of HMS Niobe
 The deck around you was little more than a mass of shadow and outline
 in the dark, with the only point of light coming from the binnacle just
 in front of you.  You were aware of the mizzen mast towering above you
 nearby, but as much from the howl of the wind in the rigging as from
 anything you could see.

 The helmsman was standing nearby at the wheel.

 You were almost deafened by the howling gale screaming in the rigging
 and lashing up the waves all round the ship.
