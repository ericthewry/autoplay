 Canyon View
 You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here
 there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
 upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the
 mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the
 Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with
 rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern.
 To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for
 miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb down
 into the canyon from here.

>go east

 Rocky Ledge
 You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You
 can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a
 passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the
 canyon bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears climbable.

 Up a Tree
 You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large
 branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
 Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.
 In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,
 apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with
 fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl.
 Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate
 looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.

 The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script, rarely used today. It
 seems to be a philippic against small insects, absent-mindedness, and
 the picking up and dropping of small objects. The final verse consigns
 trespassers to the land of the dead. All evidence indicates that the
 beliefs of the ancient Zorkers were obscure.

 "Flood Control Dam #3

 FCD#3 was constructed in year 783 of the Great Underground Empire to
 harness the mighty Frigid River. This work was supported by a grant of
 37 million zorkmids from your omnipotent local tyrant Lord Dimwit

 370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the center, and

 Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
 walls here. He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
 the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
 Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
 You parry a lightning thrust, and the thief salutes you with a grim
 nod.

>hit thief with sword

 The thief is disarmed by a subtle feint past his guard.
 The robber, somewhat surprised at this turn of events, nimbly
 retrieves his stiletto.

>again

 You charge, but the thief jumps nimbly aside.
 The stiletto flashes faster than you can follow, and blood wells from
 your leg.

>again

 You charge, but the thief jumps nimbly aside.
 The thief comes in from the side, feints, and inserts the blade into
 your ribs.
 It appears that that last blow was too much for you. I'm afraid you
 are dead.

    ****  You have died  ****

 As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The
 feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where
 the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed.
 The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even
 unreal.

 Entrance to Hades
 You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

   Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

 The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
 mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some
 hideous fate, can be heard.

 Studio
 This appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are
 splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough,
 nothing of value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an
 open door (also covered with paint). A dark and narrow chimney leads
 up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems
 unlikely you could get back down.
 Loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper.

 Cyclops Room
 This room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up.
 A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
 adventurers), blocks the staircase. From his state of health, and the
 bloodstains on the walls, you gather that he is not very friendly,
 though he likes people.

 The cyclops, tired of all of your games and trickery, grabs you
 firmly. As he licks his chops, he says "Mmm. Just like Mom used to
 make 'em." It's nice to be appreciated.

    ****  You have died  ****

 As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The
 feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where
 the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed.
 The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even
 unreal.

 Entrance to Hades
 You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

   Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

 The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
 mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some

    ****  You have died  ****

 As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The
 feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where
 the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed.
 The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even
 unreal.

 Entrance to Hades
 You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

   Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

 The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
 mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some
 hideous fate, can be heard.

 You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
 Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
 The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
 suddenly vanish.

 Treasure Room
 This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of
 discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on
 the floor. There is an exit down a staircase.
 There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning
 against one wall. He is armed with a deadly stiletto.
 There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.
 The butt of his stiletto cracks you on the skull, and you stagger
 back.

>hit thief with knife

 You are still recovering from that last blow, so your attack is
 ineffective.
 You dodge as the thief comes in low.

 The thief's weapon is knocked to the floor, leaving him unarmed.
 The robber, somewhat surprised at this turn of events, nimbly
 retrieves his stiletto.

>again

 The unarmed thief cannot defend himself: He dies.
 Almost as soon as the thief breathes his last breath, a cloud of
 sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass
 has disappeared.
 As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his treasures
 reappear:
   A stiletto
   A torch
   A sword
   A jewel-encrusted egg, with a golden clockwork canary

    ****  You have died  ****

 As you take your last breath, you feel relieved of your burdens. The
 feeling passes as you find yourself before the gates of Hell, where
 the spirits jeer at you and deny you entry. Your senses are disturbed.
 The objects in the dungeon appear indistinct, bleached of color, even
 unreal.

 Entrance to Hades
 You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

   Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

 The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
 mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some
 hideous fate, can be heard.

   Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

 The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of

 upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the
 mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the
 Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with
 rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern.
 To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for
 miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb down
 into the canyon from here.

 "Flood Control Dam #3

 FCD#3 was constructed in year 783 of the Great Underground Empire to
 harness the mighty Frigid River. This work was supported by a grant of
 37 million zorkmids from your omnipotent local tyrant Lord Dimwit
 Flathead the Excessive. This impressive structure is composed of
 370,000 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the center, and
 193 feet wide at the top. The lake created behind the dam has a volume
 of 1.7 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million square feet, and a
 shore line of 36 thousand feet.

 We will now point out some of the more interesting features of FCD#3
 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:

 South of House
 You are facing the south side of a white house. There is no door here,

>read parchment

 The map shows a forest with three clearings. The largest clearing
 contains a house. Three paths leave the large clearing. One of these
 paths, leading southwest, is marked "To Stone Barrow".

>go north

 The windows are all boarded.

>go southwest

 You can't go that way.

>go west

 boarded front door. A secret path leads southwest into the forest.
 There is a small mailbox here.

>go southwest

 Stone Barrow
 You are standing in front of a massive barrow of stone. In the east
 face is a huge stone door which is open. You cannot see into the dark
 of the tomb.

>go east

 You can't go that way.

>enter

 Inside the Barrow
 As you enter the barrow, the door closes inexorably behind you. Around
 you it is dark, but ahead is an enormous cavern, brightly lit. Through
 its center runs a wide stream. Spanning the stream is a small wooden
 footbridge, and beyond a path leads into a dark tunnel. Above the
 bridge, floating in the air, is a large sign. It reads:  All ye who
 stand before this bridge have completed a great and perilous adventure
 which has tested your wit and courage. You have mastered the first
 part of the ZORK trilogy. Those who pass over this bridge must be
 prepared to undertake an even greater adventure that will severely
 test your skill and bravery!

 The ZORK trilogy continues with "ZORK II: The Wizard of Frobozz" and
 is completed in "ZORK III: The Dungeon Master."
 Your score is 350 (total of 350 points), in 472 moves.
 This gives you the rank of Master Adventurer.

 It's not much of a job, but the Dungeon Master was looking for a guard
 troll, so you volunteered. You were given the standard-issue axe, and
 told to... well, guard.

 People who'd probably hate to be associated with this, and probably
 don't know why I'm thanking them, but whom I ought to mention for one
 reason or another:

 David "flatterer" Dyte, Lucian "Lucian" Smith, Neil de Mause, Dan
 "inky" Shiovitz, David Wildstrom, L. Ross Raszewski, Andrew Plotkin,
 Zak Arntson, Gareth Rees, Graham "of course" Nelson. And all those
 raif posters whose questions and answers I plundered via DejaNews.

 Most of the game text that I haven't made up on the spot was taken
 from Dungeon; some other from Zork, which, as it said in the blurb, is
 a registered trademark of Activision, Inc. and is used with
 permission. (Cheers, Laird.)

 Note that this game is freeware. Do with it what you will, bar hacking
 it about and not saying that you've done so. Gaudete.

 You can't see any such thing.

 What if an adventurer came upon you unawares? Fine guard you'd be.
 A "lean and hungry" gentleman with a large bag just wandered through
 the room. You nod to him, one professional to another.

 The passages through there are twisty and all alike. You don't want to

 You stretch up and touch the ceiling. Fairly solid.

 An adventurer strides in from the south, carrying a brass lantern.
 While your eyes adjust to the sudden light, he most unsportingly
 attacks you!

 Slash! His blow lands! That one hit an artery, it could be serious!

>attack adventurer


 The flat of your axe hits the adventurer delicately on the head,
 knocking him out.

>again


 The unconscious adventurer cannot defend himself; he dies. The body of
 the adventurer, and all his possessions, suddenly disappear in a puff
 of orange smoke.

 An adventurer strides in from the south, carrying a brass lantern.

 The adventurer's sword flashes out and connects painfully with your
 midriff.

>attack adventurer


 Your axe crashes against the rock, throwing sparks.
 You receive a deep gash in your side from the elvish blade.
 It appears that that last blow was too much for you.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">    *** You have died ***</span>

 Now, let's take a look here... No, I don't think you deserve another
 chance. You are only a troll, after all.

 In that game you killed 1 adventurer in 30 turns.
