 In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy
 mountainscape. As the townsfolk joyously prepare for the coming winter
 solstice, a young girl living with her family in a humble hut at the
 outskirts of town gains no comfort in the festivities. Her closest
 companion, her younger brother Sander Bales, has fallen seriously ill
 with a fever and can barely lift his head from the bed upon which he
 lies. Young Gretchen could hardly have suspected that such
 circumstances would cause the fanciful events that were to occur upon
 this solstice eve.

 Small Bedroom
 A small, sickly boy is lying on a bed that takes up most of the space
 in this room. Light filters in through drab curtains hung around the
 only window in this bedroom. A long dark drapery hangs down over a
 portion of the east wall.

 Small, disheveled shoes lie at the foot of the bed.

>examine boy
 Your younger brother, Sander, became very ill many weeks ago and has
 yet to show signs of recovery. He looks feverish and uncomfortable as
 he lies asleep in your parents' bed. You become very forlorn as you
 stare at him. This used to be your favorite time of the year when the
 two of you would brave going into town and partake in the numerous
 solstice festivities with the other children.

>examine drapery
 It is just the separation between the living room and the bedroom.

>examine me
 You are a young girl by the name of Gretchen Bales.

>inventory
 You are not carrying anything.

>examine shoes
 Sander has had to wear these same shoes for years. They have so many
 rips and tears that you wonder how they are able to hold together at
 all. This solstice eve, your family was only able to afford one new
 pair of shoes between the two of you, and being the eldest, you were
 the fortunate beneficiary. Poor Sander!

>look under bed
 You search and search, but find nothing of interest.

>inventory
 You are not carrying anything.

>open curtains
 You push aside the thin curtains and peer out of the window. In the
 distance, you can see your father chopping wood at the forest edge.

>examine father
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>examine sander
 Your younger brother, Sander, became very ill many weeks ago and has
 yet to show signs of recovery. He looks feverish and uncomfortable as
 he lies asleep in your parents' bed. You become very forlorn as you
 stare at him. This used to be your favorite time of the year when the
 two of you would brave going into town and partake in the numerous
 solstice festivities with the other children.

>examine drapery
 It is just the separation between the living room and the bedroom.

>wear shoes
 Not only are those Sander's shoes and would not fit you, but those
 shoes are so worn and so small that you would not want to wear them
 anyway.

>talk to sander
 Sander groans but does not otherwise respond.

>go east
 You push the drapery aside and move into the adjacent room.

 Living Room
 This is the main room of the house. The drapery to the bedroom hangs
 in the west wall. A lighted hearth takes up most of one wall, and your
 mother prepares food in one corner of the room for what will be a
 meager solstice dinner. The room is sparsely decorated save for a
 little spruce tree that stands near the door to the north, your
 family's only token to the winter celebration.

>examine tree
 Although you delight in having the spruce tree in the house as a
 reminder of the nearing solstice celebration, you cannot help but be
 saddened that it is undecorated with any of the marvelous ornaments
 and trimmings of the trees in the village. Your mother notices you
 staring at the tree and remarks, "Gretchen, if you go into town today,
 remember to stop by the tavern and ask Hanna-Mae if she has a candle
 to spare so that we may at least have something to adorn that tree."

>examine mother
 Your mother is chopping vegetables for tonight's dinner.

>ask mother about sander
 She looks down at you and musters a smile, "With all of our thoughts
 and well wishes, he's just got to get well soon. Be patient, and let
 him have his rest."

>pray
 Nothing seems to have changed.

 Although a vegetable feast is incredibly meager compared to the feasts
 in town, it will be one of the most lavish of the year for your
 family.

>ask mother about hanna-mae
 "Please be very careful if you go into town today, Gretchen dear."

>ask mother about town
 "Please be very careful if you go into town today, Gretchen dear."

>examine hearth
 You stare mesmerized by the fire for some time.

 Your mother seems preoccupied with her chores.

>hug mother
 Your mother gives you a warm hug in return. "Poor Gretchen, I know it
 must be lonely for you. But, try to cheer up," she says with a smile.
 "I'm sure Sander will be back to normal in no time." She looks worried
 though, and busily occupies herself with tidying the room.

>out
 You open the front door and step outside.

 Path to Village
 The air is cool and brisk this evening. Menacing storm clouds loom
 over the mountaintops to the east, but on the opposite horizon are the
 beginnings of a fantastic sunset. The door to your family's house lies
 to the south and a well-worn trail leads northeast to the village.

>examine house
 Your family lives in this meager structure indeed, but it has been a
 safe and secure harbor all of your life.

>examine sunset
 The sun is setting in the western sky in a wondrous display of color.

>go northeast

 Path near Village
 A large, bustling community lies to the north. Cheers of merriment can
 be heard even at this distance. The terrain along this part of the
 path is particularly mountainous, and the trail leading into the
 village is carved into a moderately steep incline. The path home winds
 to the southwest.

>go north

 Village Street near Tavern
 This is the main road through town. This road continues deeper into
 the village when traversed to the north, and leads back down the
 mountainous path to home when traveled south. Peals of laughter can be
 heard from the tavern to the east. Tantalizing and delicious smells
 beckon your poor, hungry belly toward the open tavern door.

>go east

 Festive Tavern
 This tavern is a popular meeting place for the townsfolk especially at
 this time of year. Peels of laughter can be heard over the din of so
 many voices telling stories from past years and hopes for future
 seasons. Nearly every table is occupied with groups of villagers
 drinking, feasting and laughing. The smells of lavish dishes sorely
 tempt your empty stomach. Musicians walk through the crowd singing
 carols and playing their instruments for the diners. A roaring fire
 adorns the back wall of the tavern. A large pot hangs on a rack
 squarely over the flames. Many of the villagers take their bowls over
 to the hearth and fill them with the traditional plum pudding that is
 being cooked in that large pot. Peering through the smoky air, you
 recognize a woman scrubbing a counter stretching along the back wall.

>examine woman
 Which do you mean, the villagers or Hanna-Mae?

>hanna-mae
 You recognize the waitress as Hanna-Mae, a long-time acquaintance of
 your family. She has been working in this tavern for as long as you
 can remember. She looks up and gives you a warm smile as you approach.

>greet hanna-mae
 Hanna-Mae smiles, "Why, hello there, little dear. How is your family?
 Be sure to give my regards to your brother. I hope he is doing
 better!"

>tell hanna-mae about sander
 One of the villagers waves at Hanna-Mae from across the room. As she
 starts across the tavern floor, she calls back to you, "Sorry,
 Gretchen! Back in a moment!"

>ask hanna-mae about candle
 "Oh, sure. I can probably find a candle to spare," Hanna-Mae explains
 as she walks around to the other side of the counter and picks up a
 candle from an empty table. She returns to the counter where you are
 waiting and gives the candle to you. "I'm sure your tree will be
 beautiful. Now run along, and be sure to give my regards to your
 family!"

>thank hanna-mae
 Hanna-Mae gives you a nod.

>examine candle
 This is a partially used candle, however it still has enough wax left
 to last for your family's winter solstice dinner celebration tonight.

>buy beer
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>examine pot
 You walk over to the fire and peer into the large black pot that hangs
 over the yellow flames. A delicious-looking plum pudding is being
 cooked in the pot. As the yearly tradition would have it, whomever
 finds the single silver coin that is placed in the large pot of plum
 pudding will be blessed with a season of unparalleled prosperity. Ah,
 if only you could afford a bowlful.

>get pudding
 It would be very rude to simply take a handful of the pudding directly
 from the large vat. Anyway, you would most likely be burned attempting
 to take the pudding by yourself.

>ask hanna-mae about pudding
 Hanna-Mae looks at you for a moment and then says, "Why ... sure, it
 is solstice eve after all! I'm sure no one will mind if I give you a
 small serving of that plum pudding. Wouldn't that be nice?" And with
 that, Hanna-Mae finds a bowl and fills it with the plum pudding from
 the large pot over the hearth. She brings it back over to you, "Eat
 up, Gretchen. That batch is especially tasty this year!

 (the large vat of plum pudding with the candle stick)
 Nothing appears to be on sale.

>eat pudding
 (the tiny bowl containing a small serving of plum pudding)
 You devour the plum pudding, downing spoonful after spoonful in hungry
 gulps. Suddenly, your teeth clamp down on a hard, flat object. Your
 initial discomfort turns rapidly to glee when you pull a silver coin
 from your mouth! It has always been the tradition in town every winter
 solstice that the person who finds the coin in the plum pudding will
 be blessed with a coming season of prosperity. Hanna-Mae runs over to
 you and hugs you joyfully. "You found it, you found it!" she cries.
 Many of the townsfolk turn to look at you and clap politely.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>examine coin
 Even though most townsfolk would find this silver coin more valuable
 for the traditional superstition of future good fortune, this coin is
 the most money you have ever had in your possession. You imagine
 yourself to be the richest girl in all of the world.

>push save
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>out

 Village Street near Tavern
 This is the main road through town. This road continues deeper into
 the village when traversed to the north, and leads back down the
 mountainous path to home when traveled south. Peals of laughter can be
 heard from the tavern to the east.

>go south
 As you begin to start back home, you feel a pang that compels you to
 stay in town a little longer. You would so much like to return home
 with something to cheer up your brother.

>go north

 Village Street near Toy Shop
 Further down the road, you see children playing some sort of game in
 the town square. Beyond them, a small theater production is taking
 place. You pass a window of one of the shops filled with a dazzling
 display of dolls and toys of all shapes and sizes. Your favorite place
 in town, the toy store lies to the west.

>examine toy store
 You might occasionally become lost in other parts of town, but you
 know the path to the toy shop well. The window facing the main path
 through town is a delight for the senses and the imagination.

>go west

 Toy Shop
 Stepping across the threshold into the toy shop, you are overcome by a
 stunning display of all the toys a child could want. Filling the
 shelves are colorful stuffed bears, bouncing balls, games and puzzles,
 shiny trinkets and gizmos, dolls of all shapes and sizes, and even a
 polished red wagon. There are racks full of frilly dresses and boxes
 brimming with fancy bonnets and ribbons. The old shopkeeper peers at
 you curiously from behind his desk.

 As you gaze in awe from one toy to the next, your eyes come to rest
 upon a strikingly pair of fine leather shoes on a pedestal in front of
 the clothes display.

>examine shoes
 Quite simply, these are the finest, most handsome pair of shoes you
 have ever laid eyes upon. You could not imagine a more perfect
 solstice gift for Sander who has had to wear his tight and tattered
 old shoes for so long.

>examine dresses
 Which do you mean, the toys or the fancy clothes?

>clothes
 On many an occasion, you have wished that you could dress up in those
 fancy dresses, ribbons, bonnets, and bows instead of the plain garment
 you wear to work in the field.

>examine toys
 You have had many dreams and fantasies about the hours of fun you
 could have playing with all of these toys.

>ask shopkeeper about shoes
 The shopkeeper smiles, "Ah, they are a fine pair of shoes, aren't
 they? Those shoes were specially made by the best shoemaker in the
 village for a special solstice treat. It is very lucky for you that
 they are still in the shop tonight! Eh," he pauses and rubs his chin
 looking suddenly forlorn, "You do have something to buy them with,
 yes?"

>play with toys
 Alas, that only seems possible in your imaginings.

>show coin to shopkeeper
 "Ah, now you've really got something there!", the shopkeeper grins.
 "Anything you would like to buy with it?"

>ask shopkeeper about toys
 The shopkeeper does not respond, but merely keeps looking over his
 notes and ledgers. All the young children know the old man has been
 going deaf for years now. You shrug your shoulders and continue
 inspecting the shop.

>flip coin
 That is not a recognizable verb.

>buy toys
 What do you want to buy the toys with?

>coin
 Your heart delights that you could finally buy something from this toy
 shop, but you suddenly remember Sander. It would mean so much more if
 you could cheer him up this solstice eve.

>examine children
 Looking down the village street into the town square, you see a group
 of children merrily around a tall pole.

>examine pole
 In keeping with tradition, sheaves of grain are placed on a pole and
 set up in the town square on solstice eve. In the morning, the dozens
 of chirping birds hungrily eating the grain will make the celebration
 all the more merry.

>go north
 You do not recognize anyone in the town square and decide to observe
 the scene from where you stand.

>dance
 You begin to sway from side to side, humming to yourself. Then you
 twirl 'round and 'round making your dress billow.

>sing
 Your sing joyously into the open air.

>play
 What do you want to play with?

>pole
 Alas, that only seems possible in your imaginings.

>play with kids
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>play with children
 Alas, that only seems possible in your imaginings.

 Your dress is simple and plain.

>climb pole
 That would not seem to be worth the effort.

>get grain
 You are not in the town square. Besides, you are much too fascinated
 by the toy shop to pay it any more notice.

>go west

>buy shoes with coin
 The shopkeeper takes the coin from you and looks back and forth upon
 it and the fine leather shoes. "Well my dear, I have to tell you that
 this silver coin does not quite equal the price of these shoes ... "
 The shopkeeper pauses as you stare at him with disappointment brimming
 in your eyes. "But after all, it is solstice eve ... Ah, very well
 then. Here, take the shoes to your brother. Now run along back home,
 it is getting late!" And with that, the shopkeeper gives you the pair
 of leather shoes.

>wear shoes
 They are a present for your brother!

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   handsome leather shoes
   a candle stick

>eat shoes
 That would hardly agree with you.

 heard from the tavern to the east.

>go south
 You begin the trek back home with the sun already sinking below the
 horizon. You will have worried your poor mother sick!

 As the wind picks up and begins whipping your hair and dress furiously
 about, you cover your face and try to hurry back faster than ever.
 Suddenly, the black storm clouds that had been threatening the horizon
 for so long swoop down at an alarming rate that completely engulfs the
 valley leaving you no choice but to stumble on in darkness. Cold, wet
 droplets suddenly pummel your skin as a furious snowstorm erupts.
 Thousands upon thousands of snowflakes swirl about in a blinding
 blizzard. You stumble off of the path in blindness and tumble down the
 side of the mountain ...


 You awake finding yourself staring at a silvery round orb in a
 midnight blue sky. You are lying on your back in a small forest
 clearing covered for the most part in soft, powdery snow. Shivering,
 you stand up, swat the snow from your dress, and shake icy droplets
 from your long hair. The snowy forest landscape appears completely
 foreign, as if you have stumbled into some kind of winter wonderland.

 Dense Forest near Thicket
 The silvery moonlight softly illuminates the nearby branches of this
 dense forest and reflects from snowy patches along the cold ground.
 Although your range of sight is limited by the darkness, the brambles
 appear passable to the north and southwest. A glowing orb to the north
 sends streaks of yellow light through the gnarled branches.

 distance.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   handsome leather shoes
   a candle stick

>go north

 Little Clearing
 This is a small clearing in the dark wood which is singular for a
 large beautiful oak tree growing here. The moonlight filters through
 the dark bare branches and makes unusual patterns on the snowy ground.
 A path runs through the little clearing from the east to the west, but
 many other directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

>examine lantern
 The lantern emits a bright and glowing yellow light.

 The lantern emits a bright and glowing yellow light.

>take lantern
 Just as your hands are about to touch the glowing lantern, the branch
 upon which it hangs abruptly swoops up out of your reach. Only when
 you step back does the branch lower back to its original position.

>examine moon
 The bright and silvery full moon hanging in the night sky illuminates
 the snowy patches at your feet and provides the light by which you are
 able to view this strange and snowy world in which you have fallen.

 You suddenly hear a rustling above you, but before you can react, you
 are pummeled by clumps of snow as the icy patches are dislodged from
 the branches above.

>look up
 That was only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>examine trees
 The forest is full of magnificent tall fir trees. They fill the wood
 with a wonderful fresh pine scent.

>talk to tree
 Which do you mean, the fir trees or the oak tree?

>examine oak tree
 The great oak tree in this clearing is devoid of all leaves as it
 would be at this time of the year. The long and gangly branches are
 crisply silhouetted by the full silvery-white moon hanging in the dark
 sky. You notice some unusual folds in the bark of the oak. You imagine
 that these folds resemble a kind of face with two eyes and a closed
 mouth. As you approach the trunk to examine it further, the 'eye'
 folds suddenly split open revealing dark gaps, and from the opening
 'mouth' a deep throaty voice suddenly booms, "Wait right there, little
 lass! Come any closer, and I might eat you up fast!" With that, all of
 the dryad's branches seem to wriggle as if he were taking a great
 stretch, and the lantern, in turn, bobs up and down. He stares at you
 with a bemused expression.

 The fragrant fir trees fill the wood with a terrific scent.

>dryad, hello
 The dryad's deep voice reverberates through the wood, "Why hello there
 little lass. No, no ... do not come any closer, for I might eat you up
 fast!"

>ask dryad about lantern
 The dryad raises the lantern up out of your reach and looks at you
 with pity. "So sorry, young thing, but without this light, I have no
 solstice cheer to bring. But take heart, little sprite, the moon is
 full and bright on this most snowy solstice night!" Then after pausing
 to reflect he adds, "Now if you had a bundle of fairy glow rocks, what
 a find! But alas, the ore grows deep in the old dwarf's mine."

>ask dryad about fairy glow rocks
 The dryad appears to be staring whimsically at the great silvery moon
 overhead and does not seem to be paying any attention to you.

>ask dryad about rocks

 overhead and does not seem to be paying any attention to you.

>ask dryad about mine

 overhead and does not seem to be paying any attention to you.

>ask dryad about moon
 The dryad stares whimsically at the moon, "Look how it shines so pure
 and white as it bursts from the night. Lo, what a sight!"

>ask dryad about dwarf
 The dryad appears to be staring whimsically at the great silvery moon
 overhead and does not seem to be paying any attention to you.

>climb dryad
 You consider moving closer. But on second thought, you imagine it
 might be most unpleasant if the dryad were to actually eat you as he
 so casually mentioned.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go west
 As you walk, the forest thins and soon, you leave it behind entirely.

 Path through Snowy Hills
 This is the edge of a vast expanse of snowy hills that continue to the
 north and northeast. The hills are completely covered in powdery white
 snow that glistens in the soft moonlight. A path extends from the
 northwest to the east. The forest continues in all other directions.

>go northwest

 Cave Entrance
 This is the base of a giant mountain to the north. The rocky landscape
 continues to the west. Snow-covered plateaus glisten in the moonlight
 high above. The path stops just in front of the mouth of a cave in the
 mountainside to the west. Railroad tracks lead from deep inside the
 cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
 entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

 You hear the faint groaning of creaky wheels echoing from within the
 cave. The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an
 old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave
 entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat
 pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or
 unconcerned by your presence, he continues pushing the cart until it
 reaches the stone pile where he dumps his load of stones. He then
 slowly marches around the cart to the other side and pushes it back
 into the darkness of the cave.

>examine stones
 The tall rock pile is made up of hundreds and hundreds of small, grey
 rounded stones.

>examine stones

>smell stones
 You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine coal
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>examine track
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>get stones
 You take a handful of the round, grey rocks, but they soon become
 unwieldy. Since you cannot find a suitable place to keep any more than
 a handful, you have to stop at that.

>count stones
 That is not a recognizable verb.

>rub stones

 Little is changed by this.

 Path through Snowy Hills
 This is the edge of a vast expanse of snowy hills that continue to the
 north and northeast. The hills are completely covered in powdery white
 snow that glistens in the soft moonlight. A path extends from the
 northwest to the east. The forest continues in all other directions.

>go east

 Little Clearing
 The oak dryad peers down at you as you stand in this small clearing in
 the dark wood. The moonlight filters through his dark bare branches
 and makes unusual patterns on the snowy ground. A path runs through
 the little clearing from the east to the west, but many other
 directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

>light candle
 If you were to light the candle, the melting wax would surely burn
 you. Besides, the candle is small, made more for decoration than
 illumination.

 As you walk, the forest thins and soon, you leave it behind entirely.

 This is the base of a giant mountain to the north. The rocky landscape
 continues to the west. Snow-covered plateaus glisten in the moonlight
 high above. The path stops just in front of the mouth of a cave in the
 mountainside to the west. Railroad tracks lead from deep inside the
 cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
 entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

 You hear the faint groaning of creaky wheels echoing from within the
 cave. The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an
 old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave
 entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat
 pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or
 unconcerned by your presence, he continues pushing the cart until it
 reaches the stone pile where he dumps his load of stones. He then
 slowly marches around the cart to the other side and pushes it back
 into the darkness of the cave.

>enter cave
 That does not seem to be something you can enter.

>go north
 The terrain is just too difficult in that direction.

>go west

 Dwarf's Mine
 Inside the cave, you can barely make out the shapes within this
 chamber. The moonlight trickles in barely illuminating the metal
 tracks upon which the cart rolls. The tracks appear to originate from
 somewhere in a tunnel to the north and then divide here in this
 chamber. One set of tracks leads back out to the east while the other
 continues into a tunnel to the southwest. Near the junction of the
 tracks, you can barely see a tall metal lever reflecting in the
 moonlight.

>go north
 The tunnel to the north is just wide enough for the tracks, and you
 worry that if you follow them, the dwarf will run you over with his
 cart when he returns.

>go southwest
 Alas! It is much too dark to see deeper within the mine. The moonlight
 barely illuminates this chamber as it is.

>examine lever
 The long metal lever is connected to the tracks near the junction. It
 is tipped slightly from vertical in one direction.

>pull lever
 You grab ahold of the long lever and pull with all of your might. With
 the groaning of rusted metal, the lever slowly moves. You notice that
 the tracks are now connected from the tunnel to the north to the
 tunnel to the southwest.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>z.z.z.z.
 Time passes.

 You hear the faint grinding of the miner's cart on the tracks as it
 returns from the tunnel to the north. The cart rolls into the cave and
 follows the tracks which now lead into the cave to the southwest. The
 dwarf passes by oblivious to your presence.

 Time passes.

 Time passes.

 Time passes.

 The miner's cart emerges from the tunnel to the southwest and rides
 upon the tracks until it crosses over the junction. The dwarf then
 hobbles around to the other side of the cart and stops its motion. He
 emerges from the back side of the cart and pulls the lever back. A
 loud clap thunders through the caves as the track is connected back to
 the tracks leading east. As he pushes the cart out of the mine, the
 dwarf curves his mouth downward in a mean pout and narrows his beady
 black eyes at you.

 dwarf passes by oblivious to your presence.

>go north
 The tunnel to the north is just wide enough for the tracks, and you
 worry that if you follow them, the dwarf will run you over with his
 cart when he returns.

>pull lever
 You pull and pull on the lever, but it just will not budge any more in
 that direction.

>push lever
 You grasp the lever and try to push it, but it seems to be stuck and
 won't budge.

 The miner's cart emerges from the tunnel to the southwest and rides
 upon the tracks until it crosses over the junction. The dwarf then
 hobbles around to the other side of the cart and stops its motion. He
 emerges from the back side of the cart and pulls the lever back. A
 loud clap thunders through the caves as the track is connected back to
 the tracks leading east. As he pushes the cart out of the mine, the
 dwarf curves his mouth downward in a mean pout and narrows his beady
 black eyes at you.

>pull lever
 You hear the squeaky wheels of the miner's cart rapidly approaching
 and decide it best to step away from the tracks.

 The dwarf pushing the old miner's cart reappears at the tunnel
 entrance and passes by apparently uninterested in your presence. He
 and the cart vanish from view into the tunnel to the north.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a handful of grey stones
   handsome leather shoes
   a candle stick


 Dwarf's Mine
 Inside the cave, you can barely make out the shapes within this
 chamber. The moonlight trickles in barely illuminating the metal
 tracks upon which the cart rolls. The tracks appear to originate from
 somewhere in a tunnel to the north and then divide here in this
 chamber. One set of tracks leads back out to the east while the other
>examine track
 continues into a tunnel to the southwest. Near the junction of the
 tracks, you can barely see a tall metal lever reflecting in the
 moonlight.

 You cannot seem to find that here.

>examine tracks
 The metal tracks split at a junction in the center of this cave.
 Leading into the cave from a tunnel to the north, one line of tracks
 leads into the darkness of the southwestern tunnel, and the other
 leads out of the cave to the east. The dim silver moonlight reflects
 off of the long think metal strips with an eerie bluish sheen.

>go east

 Cave Entrance
 This is the base of a giant mountain to the north. The rocky landscape
 continues to the west. Snow-covered plateaus glisten in the moonlight
 high above. The path stops just in front of the mouth of a cave in the
 mountainside to the west. Railroad tracks lead from deep inside the
 cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
 entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

>go east

 Snowy Hills
 The vast expanse of snowy hills continue in nearly all directions. A
 tall mountain rises to the west, and you can barely make out the
 forest edge to the southeast.

>se

 Little Clearing
 The oak dryad peers down at you as you stand in this small clearing in
 the dark wood. The moonlight filters through his dark bare branches
 and makes unusual patterns on the snowy ground. A path runs through
 the little clearing from the east to the west, but many other
 directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

>throw stones at dryad
 That would hardly help the situation.

>throw stones at lantern

 Forest Clearing near Cottage
 The front of a small wooden cottage faces to the west on the far side
 of this forest clearing. Without the concealing canopy of branches,
 you see shiny points of light twinkle in the dark sky. The underbrush
 has grown thick in this area, but it has been cleared away to the east
 and also looks passable to the southeast. The stone-lined path leads
 back into the forest to the west.

>examine cottage
 The cottage is of modest size and made almost entirely of dark, coarse
 wood. The windows appear to be covered from the inside by thick
 curtains and appear very dark. Ashen-grey smoke curls up out of the
 chimney and drifts out of the clearing on the cool winter breeze.

>examine stars
 The midnight sky is blanketed with thousands of brilliantly shining
 points of starlight.

>examine smoke
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>go east
 You cautiously make your way up to the front door.

 The wooden floorboards creak and groan as you tread upon them. The
 front door is closed to the east, and a short flight of steps lead
 back to the forest clearing.

>knock on door
 You rap gently on the front door but hear no response.

>examine door
 The door is made of strong, thick wood and is carved with decorative
 swirls. The door handle is a shiny round knob, and underneath it you
 spot a large keyhole from which a soft warm light emanates.

>look through keyhole
 You peer into the keyhole and see a narrow vision of the room beyond.
 The cottage appears cozy and well decorated with large comfy furniture
 and splendid knickknacks. A roaring fire casts pulsating shadows about
 the room.

 South of Cottage
 The forest thins slightly near this side of the house, but traversal
 in this area is hindered by the dense underbrush. From this vantage
 point, you can see that the wooden cottage to the north sits up above
 the ground on short stilts.

>look under cottage
 You search and search, but find nothing of interest.

>go north
 You crouch down and crawl under the cottage. You soon discover a gap
 in the foundation that is nearly tall enough for you to stand in.

 Crawl Space
 This is a dark crawl space beneath the wooden cottage. When you try to
 stand upright, you nearly bang your head upon a wooden surface above
 you. As you look up at the ceiling of this crawl space, you see faint
 streaks of yellow light seeping through the wooden ceiling in the
 pattern of a large rectangle.

>push rectangle
 You push up against the wooden ceiling in the middle of the
 light-formed rectangle, and one side gives way. This appears to be a
 trap door leading into the cottage.

 Cottage
 The cottage is warm and cozy. Burning candles resting in sconces along
 the walls twinkle brightly illuminating the room in flickering yellow
 light. The cottage appears to be just a one-room dwelling. The front
 door is closed to the west. A large walk-in wardrobe has been pushed
 up against one of the walls; its door is closed. The portion of the
 room near the trap door would seem to serve as the kitchen equipped
 with cupboards from which hang cups and saucers. Near the center of
 the room stands a modest table surrounded by a few chairs. Centered in
 the middle of the table is a large glass dome filled with many
 translucent spheres that glisten in the firelight. Aside from various
 knickknacks strewn about, you notice a large couch with fluffy pillows
 facing the fireplace. A large black kettle hangs in the fireplace
 above a raging fire.

 The couch is much more luxurious than anything that would be in your
 parent's house. In fact, this entire room is cozy and comfortable.

 All of these items are probably very important to whomever lives here.

>examine kettle
 You try to lean over the kettle to see the water inside, but the
 rising steam is simply too hot.

>examine dome
 The large glass dome has an ornately carved base made up of three
 rings. The translucent blue spheres within click against the glass
 dome as they move about in mesmerizing swirls.

>examine spheres
 The small orbs are translucent fist-sized spheres that have a silvery
 bluish cast when light reflects from their smooth, shiny surfaces. The
 orbs churn about within the dome encasement almost as if looking for
 an escape.

>open dome
 You pull upon the glass dome, but it will not budge. It appears to be
 locked.

>examine wardrobe
 A tall wooden wardrobe stands against one of the cottage walls. The
 wardrobe doors are closed.

>open it
 The wardrobe doors creak as you open them.

>look in it
 Peering inside of the dark wardrobe, you see several curious items of
 clothing hanging inside. A pair of slippers and boots have been
 stashed in the back corner of the wardrobe. Along the back wall of the
 wardrobe, you notice several rows of shelves.

>examine slippers
 The clothing most likely belongs to the owner of the house. None of
 the clothes or shoes stored in the wardrobe are your size. You poke
 about through the clothes but find nothing else.

>examine shelves
 Resting upon one of the shelves at the back of the wardrobe is a fine
 black top hat which seems of quite a different style then the other
 wardrobe items.

>examine top hat
 The black top hat is finely crafted of smooth black silk. A royal blue
 silk band encircles the brow. As you stare at the hat, it appears
 special somehow.

>take it

 The etchings of the vertically stacked rings line up in four columns
 at equal distances around the circumference. Looking at the column of

 Forest Vale (West)
 Even though this area is much deeper than the rest of the forest, the
 thick canopy of branches high above has blocked the snow from
 collecting here. The moonlight has also been blocked by the thick
 covering of branches. Fortunately, dozens of fireflies have
 congregated here and illuminate the darkness sufficiently.

 In the firefly light, you see a bed of strikingly beautiful white
 poinsettias. Little flying fairies dance and sing on the flower
 petals. You glance about the area and notice that this forest vale
 continues to the east.

 The fairies dance in the firefly light playing games, singing, and
 laughing. You spy a group of them playing hide and seek among the
 poinsettias, while others seem to be having flying races with the
 fireflies.

 A few of the fairies hear you and fly over to you. They swirl about
 your head in dizzying circles and play with strands of your hair,
 while chanting, "Hello! Goodbye! Hello! Goodbye!"

>ask fairies about cottage

 You reach for the little wand, but just as you are about to grasp it,
 one of the flower fairies darts through the air and swats your fingers
 with his wand. Another fairy rushes over as well and chides her
 companion in a bell-like high-pitched voice, "You must take better
 care to guard the wands!" A little later, you see the fairies become
 distracted by a game the others seem to be playing with the light bugs
 and fly off to join in.

 the dark wood. The moonlight filters through his dark bare branches
 and makes unusual patterns on the snowy ground. A path runs through
 the little clearing from the east to the west, but many other
 directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

>go south

 Dense Forest near Thicket
 The silvery moonlight softly illuminates the nearby branches of this
 dense forest and reflects from snowy patches along the cold ground.
 Although your range of sight is limited by the darkness, the brambles
 appear passable to the north and southwest. A glowing orb to the north
 sends streaks of yellow light through the gnarled branches.

>go southwest
 As you walk to the southwest, the forest becomes much denser and more
 foreboding. The underbrush turns into a prickly thicket and you become
 hopelessly lost. You wander about for a time before finally reaching
 the edge of the dense forest again.

>go west
 As you walk, the forest thins and soon, you leave it behind entirely.

 Path through Snowy Hills
 This is the edge of a vast expanse of snowy hills that continue to the
 north and northeast. The hills are completely covered in powdery white
 snow that glistens in the soft moonlight. A path extends from the
 northwest to the east. The forest continues in all other directions.

>go south

 Edge of Snowy Hills
 The forest edge lies to the northeast and the gently rolling snowy
 hills continue no further than a row of hedges to the southwest. Three
 large round snowballs have been stacked atop one another directly in
 front of one spot along the row of hedges. Two spindly twigs jut out
 on either side of the middle snowball.

>go east
 The underbrush is too thick in that direction.

>go west
 You walk up and down the nearby snowy hills, but soon become lost and
 eventually find yourself back where you started.

 A little white snow sprite carrying a golden bell runs across the
 snowy hills laughing and tumbling. As soon as it spots you, it runs
 right up to you stops just a few feet away.

>sprite, hello
 The snow sprite laughs raucously, then picks up a handful of snow and
 hurls it in your direction.

>examine bell
 The little golden bell is highly polished and has a lustrous sheen in
 the moonlight.

>ask sprite about bell
 The snow imp cuddles the bell lovingly, "So small, so shiny! My
 beautiful ... beautiful ... bell." He lets out a sudden giggle and
 starts waving it over his head tauntingly.

>ask sprite about snowman
 The snowsprite stares at you with great attention as you speak. When
 you finish, he straightens up very seriously as if about to give a
 prophetic oration but says only, "What?"

 The snow sprite does flips and cartwheels across the top of the snow
 and then suddenly disappears beneath.

>ask sprite about snow
 You cannot seem to find that here.

>take stones
 You retrieve the handful of rocks from the long, thin stocking.

>put stones on snowballs
 On second thought, that just does not seem to be quite right.

 You lay the black hat atop the snowman's bare head. He now looks much
 more handsome, but alas, he has no face!

>put stones on top snowball
 On second thought, that just does not seem to be quite right.

 A little white snow sprite runs right by you carrying a large golden
 bell in both its hands over its head. It giggles and laughs
 mischievously, then does a few somersaults and disappears back into
 the snow.

 You ponder taking the fine black top hat back, but it really seems
 more appropriate for the snowman after all.

>examine hedges
 The hedges that have grown to approximately twice your height have
 been formed into a neat row which runs northwest to southeast.

 Off in the distance to the northern hills beyond, you spot a tall
 figure walking in front of a white horse. You can faintly hear the
 jingling of bells which fades away as the two of them disappear behind
 one of the distant snowy hills.

>put stones on snowman

 Alas, the snowman is blocking your way.

 You hear a ringing bell in the distance and can barely make out a

 Path through Snowy Forest
 You are standing in the middle of a stone lined path that leads
 through the snow-covered forest from the northwest to the east. To the
 north, the ground dips down much lower than the path upon which you
 now stand.

 You step over the row of stones and climb down into the forest vale.
 The air is much warmer here.

 Forest Vale (West)
 Even though this area is much deeper than the rest of the forest, the
 thick canopy of branches high above has blocked the snow from
 collecting here. The moonlight has also been blocked by the thick
 covering of branches. Fortunately, dozens of fireflies have
 congregated here and illuminate the darkness sufficiently.

 In the firefly light, you see a bed of strikingly beautiful white
 poinsettias. Little flying fairies dance and sing on the flower
 petals. You glance about the area and notice that this forest vale
 continues to the east.

 Forest Clearing near Cottage
 The front of a small wooden cottage faces to the west on the far side
 of this forest clearing. Without the concealing canopy of branches,
 you see shiny points of light twinkle in the dark sky. The underbrush

>go north
 You crouch down and crawl under the cottage. You soon discover a gap
 in the foundation that is nearly tall enough for you to stand in.

 Crawl Space
 This is a dark crawl space beneath the wooden cottage. When you try to
 stand upright, you nearly bang your head upon a wooden surface above
 you. As you look up at the ceiling of this crawl space, you see faint
 streaks of yellow light seeping through the wooden ceiling in the
 pattern of a large rectangle.

 You push open the trap door and climb up into the cottage. The trap
 door swings closed with a thud behind you.

 Cottage
 The cottage is warm and cozy. Burning candles resting in sconces along
 the walls twinkle brightly illuminating the room in flickering yellow
 light. The cottage appears to be just a one-room dwelling. The front
 door is closed to the west. A large walk-in wardrobe has been pushed
 up against one of the walls; its door hangs open. The portion of the
 room near the trap door would seem to serve as the kitchen equipped
 with cupboards from which hang cups and saucers. Near the center of
 the room stands a modest table surrounded by a few chairs. Centered in
 the middle of the table is a large glass dome that is now empty. Aside
 from various knickknacks strewn about, you notice a large couch with
 fluffy pillows facing the fireplace. A large black kettle hangs in the
 fireplace above a raging fire.

 Many beautiful blue, translucent orbs float and lilt through the air
 inside this cozy cottage.

 Cave Entrance
 This is the base of a giant mountain to the north. The rocky landscape
 continues to the west. Snow-covered plateaus glisten in the moonlight
 high above. The path stops just in front of the mouth of a cave in the
 mountainside to the west. Railroad tracks lead from deep inside the
 cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
 entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

 You hear the faint groaning of creaky wheels echoing from within the
 cave. The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an
 old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave
 entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat
 pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or
 unconcerned by your presence, he continues pushing the cart until it
 reaches the stone pile where he dumps his load of stones. He then
 slowly marches around the cart to the other side and pushes it back
 into the darkness of the cave.

 the fire. You let out a blissful sigh before standing back up again to
 continue exploring the cottage.

 You sit down upon the chair, drum your fingers on the table, and then
 get back to exploring the cabin.

>go down
 You open the trap door and climb down. The trap door closes behind
 you.

 Crawl Space
 This is a dark crawl space beneath the wooden cottage. When you try to
 stand upright, you nearly bang your head upon a wooden surface above
 you. As you look up at the ceiling of this crawl space, you see faint
 streaks of yellow light seeping through the wooden ceiling in the
 pattern of a large rectangle.

>go south

 Forest Clearing near Cottage
 The front of a small wooden cottage faces to the west on the far side
 of this forest clearing. Without the concealing canopy of branches,
 you see shiny points of light twinkle in the dark sky. The underbrush
 has grown thick in this area, but it has been cleared away to the east
 and also looks passable to the southeast. The stone-lined path leads
 back into the forest to the west.

>go west

 Path through Snowy Forest
 You are standing in the middle of a stone lined path that leads
 through the snow-covered forest from the northwest to the east. To the
 north, the ground dips down much lower than the path upon which you
 now stand.

>go north
 You step over the row of stones and climb down into the forest vale.
 The air is much warmer here.

 Forest Vale (West)
 Even though this area is much deeper than the rest of the forest, the
 thick canopy of branches high above has blocked the snow from
 collecting here. The moonlight has also been blocked by the thick
 covering of branches. Fortunately, dozens of fireflies have
 congregated here and illuminate the darkness sufficiently.

 In the firefly light, you see a bed of strikingly beautiful white
 poinsettias. Little flying fairies dance and sing on the flower
 petals. You glance about the area and notice that this forest vale
 continues to the east.

 you hear a high-pitched, "Hmph!" and are doused by a momentarily
 blinding ray of sparkling fairy light.

>take wand
 You reach again for the wand, but just at the last moment, one of the
 fairies dashes through the air and shoots dazzling light rays toward
 you from her green wand. The brilliant flashings cause you to take
 several steps backwards. The fairy twirls a few times in the air, nods
 in satisfaction, and flies back to the others.

 Little Clearing
 The oak dryad peers down at you as you stand in this small clearing in
 the dark wood. The moonlight filters through his dark bare branches
 and makes unusual patterns on the snowy ground. A path runs through
 the little clearing from the east to the west, but many other
 directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

 Cottage
 The cottage is warm and cozy. Burning candles resting in sconces along
 the walls twinkle brightly illuminating the room in flickering yellow

 door is closed to the west. A large walk-in wardrobe has been pushed
 up against one of the walls; its door hangs open. The portion of the
 room near the trap door would seem to serve as the kitchen equipped
 with cupboards from which hang cups and saucers. Near the center of
 the room stands a modest table surrounded by a few chairs. Centered in
 the middle of the table is a large glass dome that is now empty. Aside
 from various knickknacks strewn about, you notice a large couch with
 fluffy pillows facing the fireplace. A large black kettle hangs in the
 fireplace above a raging fire.

 Many beautiful blue, translucent orbs float and lilt through the air

 cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
 entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

 You hear the faint groaning of creaky wheels echoing from within the
 cave. The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an
 old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave
 entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat
 pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or
 unconcerned by your presence, he continues pushing the cart until it
 reaches the stone pile where he dumps his load of stones. He then
 slowly marches around the cart to the other side and pushes it back
 into the darkness of the cave.

>go west
 You see the dwarf retreat into the darkness of the tunnel to the north
 as he pushes the old rusty miner's cart.

 Dwarf's Mine
 Inside the cave, you can barely make out the shapes within this
 chamber. The moonlight trickles in barely illuminating the metal
 tracks upon which the cart rolls. The tracks appear to originate from
 somewhere in a tunnel to the north and then divide here in this
 chamber. One set of tracks leads back out to the east while the other
 continues into a tunnel to the southwest. Near the junction of the
 tracks, you can barely see a tall metal lever reflecting in the
 moonlight.

>go southwest
 Alas! It is much too dark to see deeper within the mine. The moonlight
 barely illuminates this chamber as it is.

>push lever
 You push and push on the lever, but it just will not budge any more in
 that direction.

>pull lever
 You grab ahold of the long lever and pull with all of your might. With
 the groaning of rusted metal, the lever slowly moves. You notice that
 the tracks are now connected from the tunnel to the north to the
 tunnel to the southwest.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait
 Time passes.

>wait

>wait

 You hear the faint grinding of the miner's cart on the tracks as it
 returns from the tunnel to the north. The cart rolls into the cave and
 follows the tracks which now lead into the cave to the southwest. The
 dwarf passes by oblivious to your presence.

>go southwest
 Alas! It is much too dark to see deeper within the mine. The moonlight
 barely illuminates this chamber as it is.

>go north
 The tunnel to the north is just wide enough for the tracks, and you
 worry that if you follow them, the dwarf will run you over with his
 cart when he returns.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The miner's cart emerges from the tunnel to the southwest and rides
 upon the tracks until it crosses over the junction. The dwarf then
 hobbles around to the other side of the cart and stops its motion. He
 emerges from the back side of the cart and pulls the lever back. A
 loud clap thunders through the caves as the track is connected back to
 the tracks leading east. As he pushes the cart out of the mine, the
 dwarf curves his mouth downward in a mean pout and narrows his beady
 black eyes at you.

>go east
 You pass by the dwarf pushing his empty cart as you exit the cave.

 Cave Entrance
 This is the base of a giant mountain to the north. The rocky landscape
 continues to the west. Snow-covered plateaus glisten in the moonlight
 high above. The path stops just in front of the mouth of a cave in the
 mountainside to the west. Railroad tracks lead from deep inside the
 cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
 entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

>examine pile
 The tall rock pile is made up of hundreds and hundreds of small, grey
 rounded stones.

>get stones

 You scoop up a handful of the grey rocks, but hear the gnome returning
 from within the mine, so you quickly step away from the rock pile.

 Little Clearing
 The oak dryad peers down at you as you stand in this small clearing in

 the little clearing from the east to the west, but many other
 directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

>give stones to dryad
 "But so dull and lifeless be the lot, you must now make them piping
 hot!" The dryad peers at you discriminatingly, "But what's this? You
 have so few! No, no little one, that will never do."

>put stones in stocking
 You put the handful of rocks into the stocking.

>go west
 As you walk, the forest thins and soon, you leave it behind entirely.

 Path through Snowy Hills
 This is the edge of a vast expanse of snowy hills that continue to the

 You crouch down and crawl under the cottage. You soon discover a gap

 Crawl Space
 This is a dark crawl space beneath the wooden cottage. When you try to

 you. As you look up at the ceiling of this crawl space, you see faint
 streaks of yellow light seeping through the wooden ceiling in the
 pattern of a large rectangle.

>go up
 You push open the trap door and climb up into the cottage. The trap
 door swings closed with a thud behind you.

 Cottage
 The cottage is warm and cozy. Burning candles resting in sconces along
 the walls twinkle brightly illuminating the room in flickering yellow
 light. The cottage appears to be just a one-room dwelling. The front
 door is closed to the west. A large walk-in wardrobe has been pushed
 up against one of the walls; its door hangs open. The portion of the
 room near the trap door would seem to serve as the kitchen equipped
 with cupboards from which hang cups and saucers. Near the center of
 the room stands a modest table surrounded by a few chairs. Centered in
 the middle of the table is a large glass dome that is now empty. Aside
 from various knickknacks strewn about, you notice a large couch with
 fluffy pillows facing the fireplace. A large black kettle hangs in the
 fireplace above a raging fire.

 Many beautiful blue, translucent orbs float and lilt through the air
 inside this cozy cottage.

 You worry that putting the stocking into the boiling water would
 destroy it.

 sink in to your knees. You can scarcely make out the silhouettes of
 the forest trees against the starry midnight sky to the south and
 southwest. The gleaming snow-covered hills continue to the west.

 A mischievous little snow sprite is standing here making faces at you
 and giggling.

 Off in the distance to the northern hills beyond, you spot a tall
 figure walking in front of a white horse. You can faintly hear the
 jingling of bells which fades away as the two of them disappear behind
 one of the distant snowy hills.

>go northeast
 The snow is far too cold and wet to travel upon in that direction.

 The snow sprite does flips and cartwheels across the top of the snow
 and then suddenly disappears beneath.

>go south

 Path through Snowy Forest
 A path, outlined upon the snow-covered ground by two rows of stones,
 begins here and continues to the southeast. Moonbeams streak through
 the tops of the giant fir trees illuminating your way.

>go northeast

 Mountain's Edge
 The forest has thinned in this area at the foothills of a great
 mountain range that lies to the north. In the moonlight, you see that
 the undergrowth has thinned to the southwest which leads toward the
 forest. A small hole, barely noticeable in the shadows, extends into
 the mountain directly to the north.

>go north
 The hole is incredibly dark and menacing, so you decide against
 entering.

>go southwest

 Path through Snowy Forest
 A path, outlined upon the snow-covered ground by two rows of stones,

 Little Clearing
 The oak dryad peers down at you as you stand in this small clearing in
 the dark wood. The moonlight filters through his dark bare branches
 and makes unusual patterns on the snowy ground. A path runs through
 the little clearing from the east to the west, but many other
 directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

>go northwest
 As you walk, the forest thins and soon, you leave it behind entirely.

 Snowy Hills
 The vast expanse of snowy hills continue in nearly all directions. A
 tall mountain rises to the west, and you can barely make out the
 forest edge to the southeast.

 In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy
 mountainscape. As the townsfolk joyously prepare for the coming winter
 solstice, a young girl living with her family in a humble hut at the
 outskirts of town gains no comfort in the festivities. Her closest
 companion, her younger brother Sander Bales, has fallen seriously ill
 with a fever and can barely lift his head from the bed upon which he
 lies. Young Gretchen could hardly have suspected that such
 circumstances would cause the fanciful events that were to occur upon
 this solstice eve.

>go west

 Cave Entrance
 This is the base of a giant mountain to the north. The rocky landscape
 continues to the west. Snow-covered plateaus glisten in the moonlight
 high above. The path stops just in front of the mouth of a cave in the
 mountainside to the west. Railroad tracks lead from deep inside the
 cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
 entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

 You hear the faint groaning of creaky wheels echoing from within the
 cave. The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an
 old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave
 entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat
 pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or
 unconcerned by your presence, he continues pushing the cart until it
 reaches the stone pile where he dumps his load of stones. He then
 slowly marches around the cart to the other side and pushes it back
 into the darkness of the cave.

>go west
 You see the dwarf retreat into the darkness of the tunnel to the north
 as he pushes the old rusty miner's cart.

 Dwarf's Mine
 Inside the cave, you can barely make out the shapes within this
 chamber. The moonlight trickles in barely illuminating the metal
 tracks upon which the cart rolls. The tracks appear to originate from
 somewhere in a tunnel to the north and then divide here in this
 chamber. One set of tracks leads back out to the east while the other
 continues into a tunnel to the southwest. Near the junction of the
 tracks, you can barely see a tall metal lever reflecting in the
 moonlight.

>pull lever
 You grab ahold of the long lever and pull with all of your might. With
 the groaning of rusted metal, the lever slowly moves. You notice that
 the tracks are now connected from the tunnel to the north to the
 tunnel to the southwest.

 Path through Snowy Forest
 You are standing in the middle of a stone lined path that leads
 through the snow-covered forest from the northwest to the east. To the
 north, the ground dips down much lower than the path upon which you
 now stand.

 You suddenly hear a rustling above you, but before you can react, you
 are pummeled by clumps of snow as the icy patches are dislodged from
 the branches above.

>go east

 Forest Clearing near Cottage
 The front of a small wooden cottage faces to the west on the far side
 of this forest clearing. Without the concealing canopy of branches,
 you see shiny points of light twinkle in the dark sky. The underbrush
 has grown thick in this area, but it has been cleared away to the east
 and also looks passable to the southeast. The stone-lined path leads
 back into the forest to the west. The windows of the cottage appear
 dark, but curls of smoke billow from the chimney.

>go east

 Porch
 The wooden floorboards creak and groan as you tread upon them. The
 front door is closed to the east, and a short flight of steps lead
 back to the forest clearing.

 South of Cottage
 The forest thins slightly near this side of the house, but traversal
 in this area is hindered by the dense underbrush. From this vantage
 point, you can see that the wooden cottage to the north sits up above
 the ground on short stilts.

>go north
 You crouch down and crawl under the cottage. You soon discover a gap
 in the foundation that is nearly tall enough for you to stand in.

 Crawl Space
 This is a dark crawl space beneath the wooden cottage. When you try to
 stand upright, you nearly bang your head upon a wooden surface above
 you. As you look up at the ceiling of this crawl space, you see faint
 streaks of yellow light seeping through the wooden ceiling in the
 pattern of a large rectangle.

>go up
 You push open the trap door and climb up into the cottage. The trap
 door swings closed with a thud behind you.

 Cottage
 The cottage is warm and cozy. Burning candles resting in sconces along
 the walls twinkle brightly illuminating the room in flickering yellow
 light. The cottage appears to be just a one-room dwelling. The front
 door is closed to the west. A large walk-in wardrobe has been pushed
 up against one of the walls; its door hangs open. The portion of the
 room near the trap door would seem to serve as the kitchen equipped
 with cupboards from which hang cups and saucers. Near the center of
 the room stands a modest table surrounded by a few chairs. Centered in
 the middle of the table is a large glass dome that is now empty. Aside
 from various knickknacks strewn about, you notice a large couch with
 fluffy pillows facing the fireplace.

 Soft pink and blue lights emanate from the black kettle in the
 fireplace as it hangs above smoldering embers.

>look in kettle
 You peer over the lip of the kettle and see dazzling pastel colors
 emanating from the round rocks. Shimmering hues of pinks, purples, and
 blues brighten the darkened fireplace with magical light.

>take rocks
 You scoop the brightly glowing rocks out of the tepid water remaining
 in the kettle and fill the stocking with them.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a stocking
     shining fairy glow rocks (providing light)
   handsome leather shoes
   a candle stick

 The oak dryad peers down at you as you stand in this small clearing in
 the dark wood. The moonlight filters through his dark bare branches
 and makes unusual patterns on the snowy ground. A path runs through
 the little clearing from the east to the west, but many other
 directions appear passable as well.

 A lit lantern hangs just within your reach from one of the long
 twisted branches of the oak.

>give rocks to dryad
 (first taking shining fairy glow rocks)
 You wouldn't be able to hold all of the glow rocks in your hands, so
 you decide to leave them in the stocking.

>give stocking to dryad
 The dryad peers into your opened stocking and his gaping eyes fill
 with glee. He exclaims, "Well! Now there is one fine solstice treat!
 Oh, I'm so pleased our paths did meet! Now, take this lamp to light
 your way, and may the morrow bring you one fine solstice day!" You
 hold the stockingful of glowing rocks to the dryad, and he scoops it
 up with one of his gangly limbs. The dryad then flings the opened
 stocking with a grand swooping motion sending the multitudes of
 glowing rocks high into the air. Where the brightly lit rocks land, he
 grasps them with surrounding twigs. The oak is lit with the brightly
 colored stones from tip to trunk in glowing purple, pink and blue
 hues. The dryad's eyes curve into blissful arcs and you can see his
 mouth curved in a huge grin. The branch supporting the lantern dips
 down well within your reach.

 a large pile of coal that is illuminated in the moonlight.

 Path through Snowy Hills
 This is the edge of a vast expanse of snowy hills that continue to the
 north and northeast. The hills are completely covered in powdery white
 snow that glistens in the soft moonlight. A path extends from the
 northwest to the east. The forest continues in all other directions.

>go south

 Edge of Snowy Hills
 The forest edge lies to the northeast and the gently rolling snowy
 hills continue no further than a row of hedges to the southwest. A
 snowman stands here in front of the hedges.

>put coal on snowman
 As soon as you put the coal pieces one by one on the top sphere of the
 snowman to form his eyes, nose, and mouth, the snowman begins to sway
 back and forth. A jolly voice suddenly emanates from the snowman.
 "Whoopee!" he cheers and begins to bounce up and down. The snowman
 bounces in a large circle around you singing over and over again, "Oh
 how jolly it is to be, a snowman so fine as you can see." He giggles
 and laughs and spins 'round and 'round. Then off to the distant
 horizon he jumps in wild zigzags and fanciful twirls. You hear his
 voice trail off as he dances into the distance humming "La, dee dee,
 dee da, dee dee!" When his figure becomes a mere speck on the horizon,
 you turn around and notice that a distinct hole has been trimmed away
 from the thicket behind the spot where the snowman was standing to the
 southwest.

 Shaped Hedges near Opening
 Neatly trimmed hedges form pathways to the south and west. An opening
 has been sheared through the row of hedges to the northeast.

 A little white snow sprite carrying a golden bell runs atop the snow
 laughing and tumbling. As soon as it spots you, it runs right up to
 you stops just a few feet away.

>go west
 Snow crunches beneath your feet when you walk down the pathway. The
 breezes are very gusty in this area as the wind blowing down from the
 night sky is funneled through the twists and turns of the hedge maze.
 Collected snow in the branches of the hedges is continually swept up
 by the breezes causing little snow flurries which gradually cover the
 footprints you leave behind.

 Hedge Maze
 Paths through the neatly trimmed hedges lead to the west, east, and
 southwest.

 Suddenly, you are smacked in the head by a snowball. You whirl about
 to see a devilish little snow sprite giggling at you. It suddenly
 jumps up, does a back flip and then disappears into the snow.

 Mountain's Edge
 The forest has thinned in this area at the foothills of a great

 the mountain directly to the north.

 in this soft earth. Mistletoe rich with tiny white berries, spiral up
 through the branches of the surrounding trees. Moonbeams streak down
 through the tops of the giant trees illuminating a gurgling spring
 that wells up warm water in a circular pond at the center of the
 clearing. Several small doe lie on the soft, lilting grass enchanted
 by the merry tunes from a company of fauns playing an assortment of
 flutes, lyres, and reed pipes. The wondrous scene is even more
 remarkable by the presence of numerous floating orbs that swirl about
 the clearing seemingly of their own accord.

 they chase each other about the clearing. As they twirl their colored
 wands, beautiful pastel light trails shoot through the air and
 illuminate the area in brief pools of light wherever they land. You
 notice one of the fairies with a yellow wand stand poised on the tip
 of a flower petal carefully holding her wand outstretched. One of the
 yellow baubles swirls through the air close by her and then gently
 lands on the tip of her wand. She waves her wand in a giant arc then
 impishly flicks her wand at one of the fairies hovering above the
 spring. The bauble soars gloriously through the air leaving yellow

>push floe with pole
 Standing on the small ice floe, you push off of the icy bank with the
 long pole. You glide smoothly down the water channel. Your makeshift
 ice raft begins to slow just as it reaches the opposite bank. It
 impacts on the other side of the channel with just enough force to
 keep it delicately fused to the ice sheet. You carefully step off onto
 the icy bank.

 Cautiously retracing your steps, you make your way back to the
 southern shore of the frozen lake.

 Ice Floes near Mountainside
 Stretching out before you is a vast expanse of flat white ice
 brilliantly shimmering in the silvery moonlight. Straining to see the
 shadowy horizon of the stark ice in contrast to the dark starlit sky,
 you notice a cluster of dark trees off to the northwest. A small dark
 hole in the mountainside opens directly south.

>go south
 As you crawl through the tunnel under the mountain, the long wooden
 pole you carry becomes increasingly cumbersome, and you are forced to
 retreat back to the ice floes and deposit the pole on that side of the
 mountain before proceeding back to the forest.

 You crawl on your belly through the tunnel which is illuminated by the
 lantern you carry. After a time, you see a brighter light ahead and
 keep crawling until you find yourself on the other side of the
 mountain.

 Mountain's Edge
 The forest has thinned in this area at the foothills of a great
 mountain range that lies to the north. In the moonlight, you see that
 the undergrowth has thinned to the southwest which leads toward the
 forest. A small hole, barely noticeable in the shadows, extends into
 the mountain directly to the north.

>go southwest

 Path through Snowy Forest
 A path, outlined upon the snow-covered ground by two rows of stones,
 begins here and continues to the southeast. Moonbeams streak through
 the tops of the giant fir trees illuminating your way.

 The underbrush is too dense in that direction.

>go east

 Path through Snowy Forest
 You are standing in the middle of a stone lined path that leads
 through the snow-covered forest from the northwest to the east. To the
 north, the ground dips down much lower than the path upon which you
 now stand.

>go north
 You step over the row of stones and climb down into the forest vale.
 The air is much warmer here.

 Forest Vale (West)
 Even though this area is much deeper than the rest of the forest, the
 thick canopy of branches high above has blocked the snow from
 collecting here. The moonlight has also been blocked by the thick
 covering of branches. Fortunately, dozens of fireflies have
 congregated here and illuminate the darkness sufficiently.

 In the firefly light, you see a bed of strikingly beautiful white
 poinsettias. Little flying fairies dance and sing on the flower
 petals. You glance about the area and notice that this forest vale
 continues to the east.

>examine fairies
 The fairies dance in the firefly light playing games, singing, and
 laughing. You spy a group of them playing hide and seek among the
 poinsettias, while others seem to be having flying races with the
 fireflies.

>show candle to fairies
 The fairies is unimpressed.

>poinsettias
 That is not a recognizable verb.

>wave candle
 You have fun waving the candle stick.

>examine poinsettias
 Flower fairies play gaily on the petals of the white poinsettias. When
 a firefly passes close by to one of the flowers close by, you notice a
 little wand resting on its petals.

>get wand
 You reach again for the wand, but just at the last moment, one of the
 fairies dashes through the air and shoots dazzling light rays toward
 you from her green wand. The brilliant flashings cause you to take
 several steps backwards. The fairy twirls a few times in the air, nods
 in satisfaction, and flies back to the others.

>examine wand
 The wand resting on the flower petal appears to belong to the fairies,
 but none are looking after it at the moment. The wand appears to be
 bluish in color.

>show lantern to fairies
 The fairies is unimpressed.

>go east

 Forest Vale (East)
 The sunken vale continues back to the west. Fireflies dance about in
 the air on this side of the vale as well illuminating the space
 beneath the thick covering of branches above. Another bed of white
 poinsettia flowers grows here in the soft earth.

>show lantern to fireflies
 The fireflies seem entirely too preoccupied to notice.

>examine flowers
 The patch of white poinsettias shines beautifully in the blue-green
 firefly light.

>get fireflies
 You do your best to capture one of the fireflies, but they fly away
 from you too quickly. They look more lovely from a distance anyway.

   a candle stick

 You now hold in your hands a magnificent present for Sander that is
 sure to brighten his spirit on this solstice eve. Quite simply, these
 are the finest, most handsome pair of shoes you have ever laid eyes
 upon. You could not imagine a more perfect solstice gift for Sander
 who has had to wear his tight and tattered old shoes for so long.

 snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
 directions.

 Your handful of snow finally melts and slips through your fingers.

 You hear the faint groaning of creaky wheels echoing from within the
 cave. The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an
 old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave
 entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat
 pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or
 unconcerned by your presence, he continues pushing the cart until it
 reaches the stone pile where he dumps his load of stones. He then
 slowly marches around the cart to the other side and pushes it back

 Ice Floes near Mountainside
 Stretching out before you is a vast expanse of flat white ice
 brilliantly shimmering in the silvery moonlight. Straining to see the
 shadowy horizon of the stark ice in contrast to the dark starlit sky,
 you notice a cluster of dark trees off to the northwest. A small dark
 hole in the mountainside opens directly south.

 You can see a long wooden pole here.

 The vast expanse of wet ice slabs creates a warbled reflection of the
 silvery moon hanging above in the night sky. Several large sheets of
 ice have broken off from the more solid floes of ice you stand on in
 this area. Soft gurgling and sloshing sounds emanate from these slabs
 as they flex and bob up and down atop the icy waters below. The tunnel
 leading to the other side of the southern mountain range is to the

 At this point, you have traveled about half-way between the island

 has broken from the main floe you stand upon. To the north of the
 smaller ice floe, you see a stretch of water that looks almost like a
 channel between other giant sheets of ice.

>go north
 The water channel to the north is far too cold for swimming.

>examine floe
 This small ice floe has broken off from the main sheets of ice that
 cover this terrain. The lake waters are gently pushing this small floe
 to the south, so it is floating very nearby to the edge of the ice
 floe upon which you stand.

>stand on floe
 You carefully step out onto the small ice floe. It tips and sways atop
 the frigid waters, but seems sturdy enough to support your weight.

>push floe with pole
 Standing on the small ice floe, you push off of the icy bank with the
 long pole. You glide smoothly down the water channel. Your makeshift
 ice raft begins to slow just as it reaches the opposite bank. It
 impacts on the other side of the channel with just enough force to
 keep it delicately fused to the ice sheet. You carefully step off onto
 the icy bank.

 A chilly mist rises from the surrounding ice and swirls about in the

 A wondrous site greets your eyes as you step through the tall lush

 Fairy Island
 You have happened upon a magical reverie! In the open clearing
 encircled by the giant leafy trees, tiny fairies giggle and play as
 they dance on the giant petals of white orchids which grow abundantly
 in this soft earth. Mistletoe rich with tiny white berries, spiral up
 through the branches of the surrounding trees. Moonbeams streak down
 through the tops of the giant trees illuminating a gurgling spring
 that wells up warm water in a circular pond at the center of the
 clearing. Several small doe lie on the soft, lilting grass enchanted
 by the merry tunes from a company of fauns playing an assortment of
 flutes, lyres, and reed pipes. The wondrous scene is even more
 remarkable by the presence of numerous floating orbs that swirl about
 the clearing seemingly of their own accord.

>wave wand
 As you hold your wand outstretched, you notice one of the blue baubles
 swirling closer and closer to you. The scintillating blue bauble
 twirls about the tip of your wand before gently alighting upon the
 point. Even when you wiggle the wand about in the air, the spherical
 blue orb stays fixed to the tip of your wand.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine orb
 (the colored baubles)
 The baubles are fist-sized translucent orbs that float and swirl about
 in the air. Their smooth, glossy surfaces reflect wonderful shades of
 blue, yellow, green, pink, and silver when they pass through the
 moonbeams. As you watch them dance about this enchanted clearing, you
 notice one of the fairies hold out a pink wand. The nearest pink
 bauble suddenly circles about the point of the outstretched wand and
 then alights directly on the tip. As you observe the other fairies
 playing, you see that the orbs have landed upon several other wands as
 well.

>examine blue orb
 The small orb is a translucent fist-sized sphere with a silvery bluish
 cast when light reflects from its smooth, shiny surface.

>SAVE

 You play the horn, and although you had not had any lessons before, a
 beautiful, deep and rich tone emanates from the flared opening of the
 brass horn. The sound reverberates in your belly with an almost
 magical energy. You do your best to join in the fauns' little
 concerto. The creatures of the island seem to approve of your
 addition. The fauns smile and nod affectionately.

 Ice Floes near Mountainside
 Stretching out before you is a vast expanse of flat white ice
 brilliantly shimmering in the silvery moonlight. Straining to see the
 shadowy horizon of the stark ice in contrast to the dark starlit sky,
 you notice a cluster of dark trees off to the northwest. A small dark
 hole in the mountainside opens directly south.

>go south
 As you crawl through the tunnel under the mountain, the long wooden
 pole you carry becomes increasingly cumbersome, and you are forced to
 retreat back to the ice floes and deposit the pole on that side of the
 mountain before proceeding back to the forest.

 You crawl on your belly through the tunnel which is illuminated by the
 lantern you carry. After a time, you see a brighter light ahead and
 keep crawling until you find yourself on the other side of the
 mountain.

 Mountain's Edge
 The forest has thinned in this area at the foothills of a great
 mountain range that lies to the north. In the moonlight, you see that
 the undergrowth has thinned to the southwest which leads toward the
 forest. A small hole, barely noticeable in the shadows, extends into
 the mountain directly to the north.

 Little Clearing
 The oak dryad peers down at you as you as you stand in this small
 clearing in the dark wood. He seems to be humming softly with his deep
 throaty voice. Brightly glowing orbs of little pastel lights,
 accentuated against the midnight blue sky, fill the branches of the
 oak. A path runs through the little clearing from the east to the
 west, but many other directions appear passable as well.

>show bauble to dryad
 (first taking the captured blue bauble)
 You grasp the blue orb as tightly as you can and pull it down away
 from the wand's tip. With a tiny "bing!" the orb breaks free from the
 wand. The blue bauble, however, appears to have other plans then to be
 held in your tiny hands, for it slips from your grasp, swivels in a
 few tight circles around the tip your wand, and lands perfectly upon
 the point once again.

>give wand to dryad
 The dryad does not seem interested.

 As you walk, the forest thins and soon, you leave it behind entirely.

 Path through Snowy Hills
 This is the edge of a vast expanse of snowy hills that continue to the

 snow that glistens in the soft moonlight. A path extends from the
 northwest to the east. The forest continues in all other directions.

>go south

 Edge of Snowy Hills
 The forest edge lies to the northeast and the gently rolling snowy
 hills continue no further than a row of hedges to the southwest. At

 You hear only the whispering wind murmuring soft secrets which, alas,

 A little white snow sprite carrying a golden bell runs across the
 snowy hills laughing and tumbling. As soon as it spots you, it runs
 right up to you stops just a few feet away.

>give orb to sprite
 (first taking the captured blue bauble)
 As the snow sprite stares transfixed at the beautiful blue orb on the
 tip of your wand, his jaw drops opened and you see his little pink
 tongue dangle lackadaisically from his mouth. He approaches cautiously
 taking slow purposeful steps on his little pointed feet. You hold the
 wand so the blue orb dangles tantalizingly within his reach. The
 little golden bell drops into the soft snow with a little "plink!" The
 sprite reaches out to the orb and pulls it from the wand. He mutters
 to himself, "Oh, what a beautiful bauble. Beautiful ... beautiful ...
 bauble." The sprite suddenly snaps out of his daze and runs off
 carrying the blue orb proudly overhead.

>get bell
 You reach down and pluck the golden bell from the snowdrift.

 harness.

 when a naughty little snow sprite ran off with it." The man affixes
 the bell back to the harness in the empty spot where it had been
 pulled off. "Could you tell? This bell is enchanted. When it tolls ...
 But, oh!" he stops short and reaches inside one of his pockets, "I am
 reminded of this magical amulet." He pulls out an amulet on a thin
 golden necklace and drapes it over your head. "Wear it 'round your
 neck, and go south to the thicket at the edge of the wood. The amulet
 will guide you home. Now, I must be on my way. I have much to do this
 night ... Go child, make haste, and take care!" The tall man mounts

 Dense Forest Thicket
 A prickly thicket has run wild beyond the edge of the forest. The
 brambles which grab at your dress as you try to pass all look so much

 direction. The moonlight barely filters down through the overgrowth,
 but you are able to spot openings in the brambles both to the

 Thicket Tunnel
 The thicket almost seems to have formed into a tunnel. The brambles
 form a complete arch overhead which blocks out most of the moonlight.
 Moonbeams shine into the tunnel from both the northeast and southeast.

>se
 As you walk out of the tunnel of brambles to the southeast, you are
 much relieved to find yourself in a wide open area with the thicket
 behind you. A large mountain rises into the starry night sky to the
 south and you see many others beyond. With a gasp of delight, you
 recognize that a snow-covered trail running along the mountainside is
 the very same one upon which you had ventured into town so many times.
 You scamper up the mountain side to the trail which gleams brilliantly
 in the full moonlight and run towards home with all of the strength
 left that you are able to muster.

 You return home to a teary reunion with your worried parents. And to
 your great surprise and delight, Sander was well enough to sit at the
 fireside awaiting your return. When you reveal the handsome shoes you
 carried through the entire adventure as a solstice gift for him, his
 eyes gleam with giddy admiration. You feel certain that he will
 recover soon to join you in all of your games and mischief as once
 before. Your mother brings out the meager solstice feast she had been
 saving, and all of you sit around the hearth to celebrate the final
 moments of this solstice night. Sander smiles with delight as you
 relate all of your incredible trials and adventures in the winter
 wonderland, and your parents exchange bewildered glances.

 Suddenly, a burlap bag tied in twine arcs through the open window to
 land in front of the little spruce tree with a thud. Your parents
 carefully open the bag and dump out the contents. They nearly fall
 over in shock as gold pieces spill out onto the floor. You run to the

 you look to the east. You hear soft jingling bells among the distant
 clop of horse hoofs and are barely able to see a fading figure on a
 white horse disappear into the rising dawn.

 As you walk out of the tunnel of brambles to the southeast, you are
 much relieved to find yourself in a wide open area with the thicket
 behind you. A large mountain rises into the starry night sky to the
 south and you see many others beyond. With a gasp of delight, you
 recognize that a snow-covered trail running along the mountainside is
 the very same one upon which you had ventured into town so many times.
 You scamper up the mountain side to the trail which gleams brilliantly
 in the full moonlight and run towards home with all of the strength
 left that you are able to muster.

 You return home to a teary reunion with your worried parents. And to
 your great surprise and delight, Sander was well enough to sit at the
 fireside awaiting your return. Your mother brings out the meager
 solstice feast she had been saving, and all of you sit around the
 hearth to celebrate the final moments of this solstice night. Sander
 smiles with delight as you relate all of your incredible trials and
 adventures in the winter wonderland, and your parents exchange
 bewildered glances.

 Suddenly, a burlap bag tied in twine arcs through the open window to
 land in front of the little spruce tree with a thud. Your parents
 carefully open the bag and dump out the contents. They nearly fall
 over in shock as gold pieces spill out onto the floor. You run to the
 window and poke your head outside. A damp breeze rustles your hair as
 you look to the east. You hear soft jingling bells among the distant
 clop of horse hoofs and are barely able to see a fading figure on a
 white horse disappear into the rising dawn.
