 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.





 "Don't tarry, Nivanen, I cannot hold for long."

 Thus you urge your good friend to consider climbing down from your
 hands as soon as possible, as your fingers which you've hooked
 together to make her a foothold are beginning to ache. You're standing
 on a narrow ledge on top of a a brick wall, which is overshadowed by
 the higher stone wall of the Royal Nest. Your quickly-assembled plan
 to peek into the hangar has gone well so far. You found the proper
 spot just in time...

 [Picture number 3 here.]


 Not long ago, couriers brought news of a team of ambassadors being
 sent from the distant land of Ashtarta, in order to extend
 relationships with your fortified hometown of Arg Varkana. That
 sounded like good news; Ashtartans are advancing in many fields (and
 in territory, you pondered cautiously) and so maybe your secluded
 mountainous city-state, which is known only for its wine and
 pistachios, could benefit from good relations with them.

 Everything would have been going normally if it wasn't for a
 conversation with Behzaad, your bookcrafting mentor. Last night at the
 dining hall he sat by you and gave you a task; your final task of
 apprenticeship, as he oddly called it: to repair an old book of poetry
 which is currently being held in the museum.

 Before leaving the table, Behzaad gravely added that you'd better hide
 the book from the Ember order of Ashtartan scholars. They would want
 it at any price, especially in its current damaged state.

 Enjoying your summer repose, you didn't give priority to his request,
 despite having heard ominous rumors of the diligent scholars and their
 disdain for law... until this evening, when to your amazement you
 heard news of Behzaad's departure from the town. However, before you
 could make up your mind what to do, the ambassadors' forthcoming
 arrival was announced. A party of your town's officials prepared to go
 and greet them in the Royal Nest where their vehicles had landed.

 You finally decided to get the book at once, but by then it was too
 late; the museum building was already closed. Your friend Nivanen
 suggested that you check to see whether or not there were any Ember
 scholars among the guests in the first place, as it is said that they
 are recognizable by the grey and red medallions they proudly wear
 around their necks. So the two of you set out to find a good vantage
 point from which to survey the guests before they go through the
 welcoming procedure and are guided to their lodging for the night...

 A discreet pursuit in Arg Varkana by Maryam Gousheh-Forgeot

 Royal Nest's storeroom (on the ledge)
 The Royal Nest is the only public nest in Arg Varkana. It has
 facilities to house all kinds of common flying beasts as well as
 adequate tools to check and repair a range of mechanical vehicles.

 You're currently in a storeroom of the Nest, standing on top of a
 brick wall. You're holding Nivanen's unbooted foot in your cupped
 hands, providing her a leg up while she tries to peek over the stone
 wall beyond you.

 A ladder leads down to the solid ground.

 You can see Nivanen here.

>examine foot
 Her foot is clean and dry. A miracle, considering the warm,
 out-of-season boots she's been wearing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   an outfit (being worn)

>untie boot
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go down
 You cannot move while supporting Nivanen's weight. You should ask her
 to get off first.

>examine outfit
 You're wearing a green tunic with a pair of tight brown breeches and
 soft leather boots.

>examine nivanen
 Your good friend is... heavy for you, but her lack of vertigo is an
 advantage. Better to have her up there than you.

>nivanen, see anything?
 There is no reply.

>talk to nivanen
 "Hmm I'm not sure, but maybe I'll need your help to climb a bit
 higher. Anyways, tell me to look whenever you're ready, ok?"

>Nivanen, look
 You ask your friend to examine what's going on beyond the wall.

 Nivanen's unbooted foot presses on your hands as she adjusts her body
 to get a better view of the hangar. As a town guard who patrols
 battlements and walks along the walls on a daily basis, she has no
 problem with heights. And for the same reason, she's in no hurry to
 get down; she's fascinated by the sight before her.

 She excitedly reports seeing one large vessel, the likes of which has
 never landed here before. But she can't see anything else because
 she's not high enough.

>lift nivanen
 You gather your force and pull your hooked hands up, allowing Nivanen
 to quickly stabilize her elbows on the stone wall and get a better
 view.

 You feel the edge of the wall you're standing on under your soft boots
 and the sensation sends a shiver up to your legs. You try not to think
 of your vertigo, and press your body harder against the ivy on the
 wall. The leaves give you a false sense of security,  enough to keep
 your head from turning.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>Nivanen, x vessel
 There is no reply.

>nivanen, look
 Nivanen reports that she now sees two smaller one-man vehicles before
 the large one she could see earlier. She describes their models and
 estimates their prices. You grind your teeth...

 Feeling your impatience, she quickly adds that there are eight
 Ashtartans, six men and two women, and one man is obviously their
 chief. Before them stand the Argbaan and High Priest and a few more
 officials. After a pause, she gladly adds that there's no one wearing
 an Ember medallion there.

 "If you want to know more about something, just ask me about it," she
 says merrily. "Otherwise I'm ready to get off."

>ask nivanen about book
 Which do you mean, the bookshelves, the old books, the poem book or
 the books?

>ask Nivanen about High Priest
 "He's not smiling at all," she chuckles, "I bet he's still bitter
 about Ashtartan mythology's inadequate respect for our benevolent
 spirits."

>ask Nivanen about Ember medallion
 "Can't define all the ranks and the badges from this distance... But
 I'm sure no one's wearing an Ember medallion around his or her neck."

>ask Nivanen about chief
 "He's older than the rest and is wearing more medals and insignia."

>ask nivanen about poetry book
 There is no reply.

>ask Nivanen about Argbaan
 "I didn't quite expect the Argbaan herself to be here. Lady Atossa is
 mostly listening as the others do the talking."

>ask Nivanen about Lady Atossa
 "I didn't quite expect the Argbaan herself to be here. Lady Atossa is
 mostly listening as the others do the talking."

>ask Nivanen about vessel
 "Magnificent craftsmanship. No wonder they arrived so early."

>ask Nivanen about vehicles
 "Magnificent craftsmanship. No wonder they arrived so early."

>ask Nivanen about vertigo
 There is no reply.

>ask Nivanen about women. ask Nivanen about men.
 There is no reply.

>examine breeches
 You're wearing a green tunic with a pair of tight brown breeches and
 soft leather boots.

>Ask Nivanen about spirits
>ask nivanen about women
 There is no reply.

 "The ambassadors are well dressed, in gold-embroidered uniforms. And
 they're all tall, warrior type, good-looking and smiling..." She
 prattles on about the fact that she can't wait to meet them in person
 tomorrow but you remind her angrily that that's not why you're
 supporting her weight down here.

>ask Nivanen about uniforms
 There is no reply.

>look
 Royal Nest's storeroom (on the ledge)
 You're currently in a storeroom of the Nest, standing on top of a
 brick wall. A ladder leads down to the solid ground. The floor is far
 below; the thought makes your head turn.

 You can see Nivanen here.

>nivana, get down
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>go down
 You cannot move while supporting Nivanen's weight. You should ask her
 to get off first.

>nivanen, get down
 Light and agile, she descends and secures both her feet on the ledge,
 then looks up to you and grins. You unravel your fingers. Your joints
 are red and aching. Ninaven climbs down the ladder with an attempt to
 complain that you wasted her time with your worries, and she has
 better things to do with her free time.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>examine ladder
 It's the wooden ladder you two used to conquer the brick wall.

>examine wall
 The stone wall of the hangar has been built recently. It's very high.

>examine ivy
 The ivy has climbed the wall, even higher than you. It's probably
 grown from a damp crack on the floor somewhere.

>look

 You're currently in a storeroom of the Nest, standing on top of a
 brick wall. A ladder leads down to the solid ground. The floor is far
 below; the thought makes your head turn.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>get ivy
 That's hardly portable.

>go down

 Royal Nest's storeroom
 You're now standing on the Royal Nest's storeroom. This is a large
 room filled with sacks of animal food that occupy the shelves. They
 range from minerals and grains to insects and dried meat and bones
>go down
 suited for various flying beasts. The storeroom's door is shut, but
 the trapdoor from which you came in is wide open.

 Nivanen reaches for her boot which she had removed before climbing on
 your hands and puts it back on. Rasha, her cat, comes out from a
 corner and turns around her. His huge green eyes meet yours and widen,
 then he jumps down the trapdoor and disappears.

 You can see a trapdoor and Nivanen here.

 You carefully climb down to the darkness of the tunnel and wait for
 your friend to lock the trapdoor and light her torch. You walk for a
 short while until you reach an exit opening up to the fresh night air.
 You catch a glimpse of Nivanen's cat running off as you climb out of
 the tunnel.

 Cargo terrace (Royal Nest)
 The cargo terrace is a moderately sized platform for temporarily
 storing all kinds of shipments that arrive or are waiting to be sent
 by air. Chariots and wheels and strapped packs line the wall, used to
 load or unload heavy stuff.

 There's a trapdoor on the floor, and a path to the southeast.

 Nivanen extinguishes her torch and closes the trapdoor behind you.

>undo
 Royal Nest's storeroom
 [Previous turn undone.]

>Examine shelves
 Various sacks of animal food occupy the shelves. They're used for
 feeding the winged beasts who carry people and deliver shipments.
 Their smell is somewhat overwhelming. You want to get away from this
 place as soon as possible.

>examine door. x trapdoor.
 The room's door is shut and securely locked. Probably in attempt to
 keep people like you out.

 The trapdoor on the floor leads to a network of corridors which
 connects underground workshops and provides secondary accesss to many
 chambers in the Nest.

>Take food
 "You can't be serious. They stink!" Nivanen says with a scowl.

 Bridge
 You walk on until you reach a bridge, in the middle of which you pause
 to catch your breath. The old brick bridge overlooks a small market.
 Behind you, on a pedestal made out of the same clay bricks as the
 bridge, a flame burns steadily in a big metal bowl.

 The path continues to the east, and the cargo terrace is to the
 northwest.

 "I'll go and put the keys back from where I took them. Goodnight...
 see you tomorrow." Nivanen says, yawning, and walks away.

>go east
>examine flame
 Half asleep, you continue along the road to your home. You finally
 open the door and stumble in. You can't tell how long you've been
 walking, but it doesn't matter now. Shortly after, you get into your
 bed and instantly drift into a heavy sleep...

 You rest soundly in your warm bed all through the night, until the
 light of the late morning awakens you.

 Bedroom (on the bed)
 Sitting on your bed, you stretch your limbs and yawn, inhaling the
 fresh mountain air which is entering your sunny room from the window
 which you left open last night. The breeze is cool, tempting you to
 crawl back under your warm bedsheet, but the sunlight's warmth on your
 skin is equally inviting.

 Your room is cozy and comfortable with meticulously selected furniture
 and decoration. A mirrored dresser is placed near the open window,
 with a small marble basin and a pitcher next to it. And at the foot of
 your bed there is a chest.

 The only exit is to the north.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine flame
 An odorless oil burns neatly in the massive metal bowl. You watch with
 pleasure as the flame casts a warm light on your surroundings.
 Although more difficult to maintain, in Arg Varkana people prefer
 flames to glow orbs. You're no exception.

 As you watch you notice a feather on the floor, glittering in the warm
 light.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>take feather
 Taken.

>examine it
 A nice red feather with a firm shaft. It's likely from a goknous, the
 rare exquisite courier bird.

 pedestal made out of the same clay bricks as the bridge, a flame burns
 steadily in a big metal bowl.

 The path continues to the east, and the cargo terrace is to the
 northwest.

>examine pedestal
 It's made out of the bridge itself; a round platform of brick. It
 supports a fire bowl in which a flame burns at night.

>examine market. x bricks.
 A few stalls and carts form a small market down below. A nice place
 for shopping for foodstuffs, if you're not after a wide variety.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine chest
 It's a dark rusty metal chest containing your treasured clothes.

>open it
 You lazily get out of your bed.

 The chest contains some clean clothes. You rummage a bit until you
 select an outfit. Once you have changed your clothes, you close the
 chest.

 You're now wearing a maroon leather top and pants. A nice gift from
 Bastovaan, the old beast tamer.

 A wooden bed with extra warm sheets.

 A wooden bed with extra warm sheets.

 The large window opens to a quiet section of the vineyard below, lined
 by a stone sidewalk and flanked by a wall. The mountains can be seen
 under the deep blue sky, shining with an almost unearthly splendor
 under the sun. Among the vines you see Rasha, your friend's cat.

 You smell nothing unexpected.

 You hear a faded gurgling of water along with distant, almost non
 existent, sound of people working and occasionally the heavy stuff
 being moved.

 A lacquered wooden dresser with a mirror and a single drawer which is
 currently closed. It's a gift from your father's carpenter friend,
 which you didn't have the heart to leave behind when moved to your
 private quarters.

 A small white stone basin is installed on a protrusion from the wall.
 Next to it there's a pitcher filled with water you use to wash your
 face and hands. For a real watery experience however, you'd go to a
 bath hall and pool not far from here.

 The heavy pewter pitcher is filled with water you pour into the basin
 to wash your face and hands - your small cherished luxury.

 You prefer to leave it open.

 You are carrying:
   an outfit (being worn)
   a feather

>open dresser
 That's not something you can open.

>open drawer
 You open the drawer, revealing a comb and some jewelry.

>take all from drawer
 comb: You comb your hair a bit. When satisfied, you put it back in
 place.
 jewelry: Taken.

>wash hands
 You tilt the heavy pitcher a bit and wash your face and hands with the
 sparkling water. You feel refreshed. The water slowly drains from the
 basin.

>examine jewlery
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine jewelry
 Your jewelry include armbands, a torc, hairpins and earrings that
 usually accompany you during the day.

 Unless given to someone else before death, a person and their jewelry
 are usually buried together. Wearing them is more a custom than a
 personal choice. Gladly, you have nothing against it.

>wear jewlery
 You can't see any such thing.

>oops jewelry
 You put on the jewelry.

 Rasha is the cat of your friend Nivanen. He's fat with thick yellow
 fur.

 Terrace
 You are on the open terrace by your room. The way to the north is

 Vineyard
 Rows of vines stretch far and wide to the south, southeast and east -
 where they nearly reach the eastern cliffside. Occasionally the vines
 are made to climb circular wooden frames to form leafy pavilions.

 The vineyard itself is in a pretty irregular shape. It continues
 between the nearby houses and buildings within the reach of many
 people from where they live and work. Narrow stone pathways mark the
 main paths. At this end the vines, you think gladly, come near your
 room's window; as if only to please the sole resident there.

 The stone pathway leads to the square to the west, the shady park to
 the north, and eventually the terrace to the northwest. On the ground
 you see some drops of oil.

 You can see Rasha, your friend's cat, sitting and relaxing here.

>pet cat
 He pulls back his head and raises a clawed paw in order to defend
 himself if need be. You can't help but to snarl at him, which only
 proves his point.

>Tickle cat with feather
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine oil
>examine oil
 Some drops of liquid which you identify as oil form a visible trail to

 He turns his short ears a bit, but otherwise ignores you.

>go east

 Eastern cliffside
 Near the brink of the cliff the vines grow scarcer but more unruly and
 are gradually replaced with wild herbs. Before the brink there's a
 circular landing platform.

 Under the cliff you can see a narrow section of the town ending at one
 of the minor town gates. Beyond the gate, and far below, lies the
 eastern meadow.

 The only exit is to the west.

>examine platform
 A conventional landing spot for landing hawks, drakes, or - if from a
 Sarvegnian community or something similar - airborn vehicles. It's
 made from stone, and is circular, measuring about four meters in
 diameter. Three crystalline glow orbs are inlaid within its brim to
 make it recognizable at night.

 Some of the wild herbs around the platform are burnt. From those and
 the fresh oil stains you conclude someone has landed here recently.
 However, it's an obsolete platform, too far from any functioning nest
 to be practical.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine orbs
 Crystalline orbs, obtained from glow rocks, absorb sunlight during the
 day and shine brightly at night. Thus they guide airborn travellers.
 When the days get too dark and cloudy for the crystals to be charged
 properly, bright lanterns are installed nearby to aid their purpose.

>examine herbs
 Some of the wild herbs are burnt, and there's no trace of regrowth.

>get herbs
 They're hardly portable.

>pick herb
 You can't see any such thing.

>Look at town
 Below you, on a mountain ledge, there's a narrow section of the town
 which ends at a gate.

>examine gate
 The gate provides access to the eastern meadow through a harsh and
 steep mountain road. Obviously it's less often used than the major
 gates, but it's still a facility.

>examine meadow
 With all the dandelions and buttercups flowering, the meadow resembles
 a radiant yellow-and-green sea between the mountains.

>pick buttercup
 You can't see any such thing.

>sing
 Your singing is abominable.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>Open gate
 That's out of reach, you can only look.

 Vineyard
 Rows of vines stretch far and wide to the south, southeast and east -
 where they nearly reach the eastern cliffside. Occasionally the vines
 are made to climb circular wooden frames to form leafy pavilions.

 The stone pathway leads to the square to the west, the shady park to
 the north, and eventually the terrace to the northwest. On the ground
 you see some drops of oil.

 You can see Rasha here.

>get cat
 You take one step towards the cat, but he casually goes the same
 distance away from you. Maybe according to some feline concept of
 private space.

>go west
 You take the path westward which leads to a square in the town.

 Square
 This is the square which you cross every day to reach your workshop in
 the library. You see a fountain with benches and potted plants in the
 middle of the square. There are roads leading in different directions.

 East leads to the vineyards. The library is to the north. Northwest
 leads to the town center. The town bazaar is to the west. The school
 is to the south, and there's a road to an old temple to the southeast.

 You can see many kids playing here.

>examine kids
 Many of the town children are gathered here. You recognize some of
 them due to their frequent visits to the library and occasionally
 creeping into the workshop. Most of them are playing.

>Examine fountain
 It's a simple clean fountain.

>examine benches
 Some simple wooden benches. Most of them are occupied by the kids.

>examine plants
 Nice decorative plants.

>play hopscotch with children
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north

 Library's Terrace
 Engraved wooden pillars support a high wooden roof. Some chairs and
 tables have been brought here from the library's interior, as is
 usually done in warm seasons. There are even some rugs and cushions on
 the ground for more relaxed reading.

 The entrance to the library is before you to the north.

 You see saddled vehicle leaning next to a pillar.

 You can also see a man here.

>lift rug
 You can only do that to something animate.

>Examine man
 He is dressed in an outfit matching Nivanen's description of Ashtartan
 ambassadors. His clothes, however, are dusty with occasional tears and
 burns. He carries some insignia, one of which you associate with the
 machinery engineers' guild or something close.

 He wears a chain around his neck but the pendant (if there is any) has
 gone down into his collar. As you try to figure it out he raises an
 eyebrow and gives you a freezing look. You instantly stop studying his
 appearance.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine vehicle
 It's a one-man vehicle with a saddle instead of a seat; less cozy but
 easier to manoeuvre. It has a transparent shield in front to protect
 the pilot at high speed. It's bronze in color and has been damaged and
 patched up in various places and needs cleaning. Even though
 Ashtartan-made, it can't be one of those fabulous ones Nivanen saw
 last night.

>man, hello
 He nods as you introduce yourself. "Ardavaan here. Greetings to you
 too, Farahnaaz."

>ask man about himself
 "You know my name, don't you."

>get cushion
 They're hardly portable.

>ask man about me
 "I'm familiar with your craft; I enjoy drawing as well. I once had
 a... brilliant mentor in Ashtarta. He goes by the name Behzaad."

>Talk to man
 He only gives you a brief smile, while his eyes fix yours with their
 cold and careful, penetrating stare. You find yourself unable to say
 anything so you mumble an apology and turn away, feeling stupid.

>ask man about Behzaad
 "So he has even been to your town. I knew the old jackal back in
 Ashtarta. He is a remarkable craftsman indeed... And you say, he just
 left the town?"

 You nod. "Yesterday afternoon."

 He looks away. "Lucky him..." You wait for him to continue, but he
 doesn't seem to intend to.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go vehicle
 You reach for the handles and begin to mount the saddle, but a stare
 from the owner of the vehicle discourages you from going on.

>ask man about vehicle
 "Yes, that belongs to me. You may not touch it, if you were
 wondering."

>grab his medallion and run for it
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>touch vehicle
 You feel nothing unexpected.

>feed man to cat
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine chain
 As you try, he raises an eyebrow and gives you a freezing look.

>Ask Ardavaan about Ashtarta
>go north
 "I guess the other... ambassadors discuss this topic adequately."


 Library
 You're in the Library of Arg Varkana. It's a big but cozy hall lined
 with rows of bookshelves. Reading tables are at the center and by the
 large windows which allow sunlight during the day. A chandelier hung
 from the ceiling upstairs along with several glowstands scattered
 around the library provide extra illumination in the evening.

 Spiral stairs lead up to the museum, and down to the bookcrafters'
 workshop. The exit is to the south.

 The Librarian Houtan greets you with a wide smile. "Good morning, dear
 Farahnaaz! How're you today?"

 You can see Librarian Houtan here.

>talk to houtan
 Houtan's gaze wanders towards the terrace as he strokes his moustache.
 "Hmm maybe you've wondered who is the one sitting out there..." You
 nod. He seems quite lost in thoughts; something unprecedented to your
 knowledge.

 Houtan's gaze wanders towards the terrace as he strokes his moustache.

>houtan, tell me about ardavaan
 Librarian Houtan has better things to do.

>wave feather
 You look ridiculous waving the feather.

>Ask Houtan about ambassadors
 "You know how I feel about that. Perhaps I'm too pessimistic, but
 nothing is done out of pure goodwill my dear, not between distant
 lands who have had no relationships for decades."

>ask houtan about feather
 (the feather)
 "Goknous is a perfect bird for sending urgent and important messages
 due to its speed, intelligence and fidelity. It's quite costly though,
 a very few people can afford to have one. And those who do avoid using
 it for everyday errands. That's why it's quite rare to see one flying
 about."

>Ask Houtan about book
 (the bookshelves)
 "I wouldn't hinder you of course. But I'd suggest you wait for the
 attendants open the window shutters upstairs after lunch so you can
 find what you seek."

>ask houtan about ardavaan
 "Ah, he arrived a little before dawn. I saw him when I was sweeping
 the terrace and spreading the rugs, so we sat down together and had
 our tea and breakfast outside, watching the sunrise. We had a chat
 about folkore and mythology; he seemed particularly interested when I
 talked about the goddess Amortaad - reminded me of yourself my dear,
 hmm... I told him to go to the old temple. He went there to make
 impressive drawings of Amortaad and... excuse me... Hello young man!
 Bring them to me, come here."

 You turn and see a teenage boy behind you waiting with some books in
 his hands. He gives you an apologetic look as Librarian Houtan
 receives his books. You wait there to further the discussion.

>Look at boy
 Looks like a juvenile bookworm.

>ask boy about houtan
 There is no reply.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>ask houtan about boy

 There is no reply.

 The teenage boy steps out of the library and walks away.

 "The old temple is intriguing indeed. And in a good shape, too."

>ask houtan about books

 There is no reply.

>Ask Houtan about Amortaad
 "The old temple is intriguing indeed. And in a good shape, too."

>go up
 You climb up the staircase.

 It's very dark in here. Since the window shutters are closed, the
 upper part of the glowrock chandelier has gone out without having the
 chance to recharge with the morning sunlight. You can't walk without
 the risk of tripping on something. You better go get some sort of
 light source yourself, if you don't want to wait for the museum to
 open.

>Open shutters
 You can't see any such thing.

>go down
 You climb down the staircase.

 Library
 You're in the Library of Arg Varkana. It's a big but cozy hall lined
 with rows of bookshelves. Reading tables are at the center and by the
 large windows which allow sunlight during the day. A chandelier hung
 from the ceiling upstairs along with several glowstands scattered
 around the library provide extra illumination in the evening.

 Spiral stairs lead up to the museum, and down to the bookcrafters'
 workshop. The exit is to the south.

 You can see Librarian Houtan here.

>go down
 You climb down the staircase.

 Workshop
 You are in the bookcrafter's workshop, a spacious hall for copying,
 illustrating and repairing books where artisans like yourself work.

 The staircase leads up to the library.

 You can see your colleague Arjang sitting behind his desk. He looks up
 at you. "Ah, Farahnaaz, how very unexpected to see you down here. Have
 you lost something?" You frown defiantly. "Uh, just joking. Actually I
 need your help. If you have some free time to talk to me..." .

>Examine glowstands
 You can't see any such thing.

>Talk to Arjang
 "Thank you girl, I really appreciate your willingness to help. You
 see, one of the new trainees has somehow spilled my last pot of
 kingberry ink..." You bite your lip to suppress a smile; only very
 dedicated artisans can ignore the delicious taste of the popular
 edible ink.

 "... and I need some to finish the map I'm working on. It's to be
 given to the Ashtartan ambassadors, so I really don't have time to go
 searching among kingberry bushes... Please, get me some kingberries as
 soon as you can, and simply press their juice into this bottle. No
 need to add honeypine sap if freshly used." He hands you an empty ink
 bottle.

>ask arjang about ardavaan
 "Yes, I saw him chatting with Houtan when I came in. He looked quite
 weary, I doubt it was only one night's sleep that he missed."

>ask houtan about behzaad
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask arjang about kingberries
 "Kingberry bushes are commonly found around the town. But the the
 problem is, the kids strip the bushes off any ripe fruit. You'll have
 more luck searching in a remote quiet place."

>ask arjang about behzaad
 "You've got to tell me what he was so enthusiastically talking about
 the night before last night, at the dining hall. But not now, I'm too
 busy."

>Ask Arjang ambassadors
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask arjang about houtan
 "He tends to everything with genuine care while he makes you think all
 he does is relax behind his desk or brew his aromatic tea. I like
 him." You nod in agreement.

>Ask Arjang about book
 Which do you mean, the bookshelves, the old books, the poem book or
 the books?

>ask arjang about the birds and the bees
 There is no reply.

>ask arjang about poem book
 There is no reply.

>examine bottle
 An empty ink bottle. You're supposed to fill it with kingberry juice.

>Examine desk
 It's a big work desk currently fully covered with Arjang's tools,
 papers and stuff.

>ask arjang about arjang
 There is no reply.

>ask arjang about me
 There is no reply.

>Look at tools
 You see nothing special about the writing tools.

>examine papers
 The paper supply is pretty low at the moment. And all of the remaining
 sheets seem to have been claimed by Arjang, the way he has hoarded
 them all together on his desk.

>go up
 You climb up the staircase.

>ask houton about lamp
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask houtan about lamp
 There is no reply.

>Look at glowstands
 Clusters of glow orbs hang from glowstands like ripe fruit from tree
 branches (Houtan wouldn't risk firelight in his library, not when
 there's adequate daylight to charge the orbs). The glowstands are
 placed on the floor, in well-thought spots to provide enough light for
 browsing the shelves and reading at the tables.

>get glowstand
 You carefully pick a single orb from a glowstand on a particularly
 sunny spot.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>examine orb
 (the glow orb)
 This piece of glow crystal is as large as a walnut and is finely
 burnished. It seems to be fully charged, judging from the sunny spot
 you took it from.

 Glow orbs absorb light during the day and shine vigorously when it
 gets dim. They are a good cumulative light source together in form of
 clusters.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>full score
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go up
 You climb up the staircase.

 Museum
 The museum is a tidy hall filled with various exhibits, ranging from
 artworks and crafts and old objects to archeological findings.

 Display cases, shelves and tables occupy the most possible space
 without making it difficult to walk. A glass cabinet containing old
 books in a corner draws your attention.

 The only exit is back down the staircase.

>score
 You have so far scored 13 out of a possible 90, in 168 turns.

>open cabinet
 It seems to be locked.

>look behind cabinet
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>examine cabinet
 It's an ornate glass cabinet with wooden frame and glass doors.
 Within, you see several old books.

>smash cabinet
 You tap on the glass experimentally. But much as you'd like to get a
 closer look at the poem book, you can't bring yourself to damage part
 of the museum.

>examine lock
 You can't see any such thing.

>SAVE

 "The museum is closed before and during the lunch," his smile widens,
 "which only means, since the library's already open, we won't have
 light upstairs until the attendants arrive."

>go south

 Library's Terrace
>look
 Engraved wooden pillars support a high wooden roof. Some chairs and
 tables have been brought here from the library's interior, as is
 usually done in warm seasons. There are even some rugs and cushions on
 the ground for more relaxed reading.

 The entrance to the library is before you to the north.

 You see Ardavaan's vehicle leaning next to a pillar.

 You can also see Ardavaan here.

> x vehicle
 It's a one-man vehicle with a saddle instead of a seat; less cozy but
 easier to manoeuvre. It has a transparent shield in front to protect
 the pilot at high speed. It's bronze in color and has been damaged and
 patched up in various places and needs cleaning. Even though
 Ashtartan-made, it can't be one of those fabulous ones Nivanen saw
 last night.

>Look at pillar
 The pillars are slender, made of tall poplar trunks and not very new.
 They bear engraved floral motifs.

>go south

 Square
 You see a fountain with benches and potted plants in the middle of the
 square. There are roads leading in different directions.

 East leads to the vineyards. The library is to the north. Northwest
 leads to the town center. The town bazaar is to the west. The school
 is to the south, and there's a road to an old temple to the southeast.

 You can see many kids playing here.

>ask kids for kingberries
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask kids about kingberries
 There is no reply.

>kids, hello
 Starting a conversation with children while they outnumber you would
 encourage them to overwhelm you with their questions and chatter. You
 prefer to keep silent.

>Southeast
 You climb a steep road upward and enter the old temple.

 Old Temple
 The interior of this old temple is still relatively intact. There are
 shallow pools of water, and a beautiful dome overhead. The water is
 provided by a natural source boiling out of the mountain rocks and
 flowing from a wall behind a pair of statues. One of the statues
 represents the goddess Amortaad and the other her beast counterpart
 Senmervae.

 You see a little boy sitting on a bench in here.

 At the foot of the statues you see some flowers.

>examine flowers
 A handful of wild flowers have been placed before Amortaad and
 Senmervae. You wonder who did this. Offerings are usually brought to
 the newer and grander ziggurat.

>examine boy
 A vicious little thing with sharp teeth! Not really, this one seems to
 be a calm boy. He's sitting near one of the pools.

>boy, hello.
 There is no reply.

>pray to goddess
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine statues
 Not all of the inlaid stones are left in their place, but the statues
 are in a good condition.

 One of the statues represents Amortaad, and the other Senmervae. (You
 may examine each statue separately for more details.)


 [Picture number 5 here.]


>speak to amortaad
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine amortaad
 The life size figure chiselled on stone represents the once popular
 goddess Amortaad. She is still worshipped, you remind yourself, but no
 entire temple is dedicated to her anymore.

 The figure is adorned with a necklace of gilded vine leaves, beads of
 lapis lazuli, and armbands with lion heads (a more ceremonial version
 of the ones you have). Her jet-inlaid eyes are outlined with thick
 black lines and she carries six weapons on her back; reminding you of
 Varkana's tradition of initiating a warrior to all those six weapons
 before letting them specialize in one.

>examine booy
 You can't see any such thing.

>oops boy
 A vicious little thing with sharp teeth! Not really, this one seems to
 be a calm boy. He's sitting near one of the pools.

>Look at Senmervae
 This statue represents a fabulous beast, which resembles a winged lion
 with ram horns, on whose back the goddess would ride out from her home
 at the source of the sacred river Surana on top of high mountains to
 visit lands and peoples (there is a debate on the location of the
 mountains; some even go so far to suggest they are somewhere in an
 old, distant world).

 The lion's head and eyes are inlaid with colorful stones and the scaly
 neck is covered with a glistening green enamel. Senmervae's images
 often adorn schools, libraries and scientific books, because people
 associate it with science and knowledge.

>ride senmervae at the risk of a riot
 I only understood you as far as wanting to ride the statue of
 Senmervae.

>ride senmervae
 The statue of Senmervae cannot be ridden.

>examine weapons
 The statue of Amortaad has a sword, an axe, a mace, a bow, a javelin
 and a baton.

>examine sword.

>examine pool
 The fountains don't work and the mossy pools need cleaning. Still,
 stream water flows gently in the pools.

>Look at dome
 The round dome overhead is not very high, producing a comfortable
 homey ambiance. It is decorated with light-colored motifs of
 mythological beings, intertwined with spiralled plants. Twelve
 windows, each made of a very thin layer of white stone, are installed
 on the dome to filter the sunlight.

 Bazaar
 The bazaar of Arg Varkana is under high brick domes interconnected
 with vaulted corridors. All kinds of goods from every town in and
 around the Varkana region are traded here. It's usually crowded, but
 today even more so, thanks to the holidays and celebrations. You
 prefer to avoid going too far in the bazaar right now.

 The exits are to the east, north and west.

 Among the nearby merchandise an art stand catches your attention.

>Examine art stand
 Lots of art supplies for sale. You just love examining all those tools
 and equipment. Now that you think of it, you might need to buy a new
 quill pen here if you can't get one elsewhere.

>buy pen
 They seem to cost at least one copper coin. You don't have any money.

>steal pen
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west
 You doubt you can make it to the other side of bazaar easily. You'd
 rather wait until it's less crowded.

>go north
 You make your way through the crowd and get out of the bazaar.

 Town center
 You're in a sunlit plaza which is abundantly decorated with rose
 bushes and cypresses. Public buildings such as the town hall and guild
 headquarters encircle the plaza. Their golden-ochre stone, blue-glazed
 mud brick masonry and crenellated walls are some of the finest in the
 town.

 Northwards from here there's a giant "U" shaped cavity in the
 mountain's natural formation. The town stretches to northeast and
 northwest.

 The staircase on the north leads downward to the cliffside balcony,
 which overlooks the land far below. The bazaar is to the south, and
 the square is to the southeast.

 You can see some town guards scattered around the place.

>Examine cavity
 The cavity starts in the middle of the mountain and continues
 northward, making the mountain and Arg Varkana itself roughly look
 like a crescent. In middle of the crescent and just down the stairs on
 your north is the cliffside balcony where people gather on special
 occasions.

>examine guards
 Town guards are dressed in their colorful uniform. They're mostly
 talking to each other. There's occasional laughter here and there. Due
 to the absence of serious threats in these times, you can tell their
 task is no longer as challenging as it used to be.

 Vineyard
 Rows of vines stretch far and wide to the south, southeast and east -
 where they nearly reach the eastern cliffside. Occasionally the vines
 are made to climb circular wooden frames to form leafy pavilions.

 The stone pathway leads to the square to the west, the shady park to
 the north, and eventually the terrace to the northwest. On the ground
 you see some drops of oil.

 Shady Park
 You walk into a shady circular place, which your mother used to
 humorously call "park of the youth" due to the ironic fact of it being
 a meeting point for old aunties and uncles. Some benches lie in the
 park, one of which is occupied by an old couple who are busy talking
 to each other. Behind them you can see a kingberry bush.

 The terrace and your room are to the west, and the vineyard is to the
 south.

>Take berries
 You find some ripe kingberries. While picking them, you discover a
 ribbon in the bush and take it too.

 [Your score has just gone up by four points.]

 It's a red ribbon. Used to tie a little girl's hair no doubt.

 You weave a thin braid on the side of your face and fasten its end
 with the ribbon. You then blend it with the rest of your loose hair.

>squeeze berries in bottle
 I only understood you as far as wanting to squeeze the kingberries.

>put berries in bottle
 You carefully press the kingberries, and let the dark juice drip into
 the ink bottle. Once you collect a good amount of ink, you eat the
 remains and lick your fingers clean.

 Now you have a bottle of kingberry juice. You hold it up in
 admiration.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>drink juice

 The couple are resting their old bones in this pleasant, quiet place.
 A luxury you'll have aplenty when you're their age.

 The old woman shakes her head and points vaguely to your direction,
 and goes on about how life is getting worse and worse for the youth
 these days. You feel slightly depressed.

 During their conversation, the old man suddenly breaks into a laughter
 which turns into a series of coughs.

>go west

 Terrace
 You are on the open terrace by your room. The way to the north is
 blocked by the high walls of a private estate surrounded by tall
 trees.

 Some stairs lead downward, to a shady park to the east and eventually
 to the vineyard in the southeast. More stairs lead upward to the west.
 Your room is to the south.

 Bath Hall
 You enter the bath hall near your home. This is a round hall with a
 single hexagonal pillar at the center. Bath chambers line the wall,
 forming a semicircle, and mirrored dressers are placed around the
 central pillar. There are some chests at the entrance to keep people's
 extra belongings. Above them, clean bath towels are hung from the
 wall.

 Hot water in this bath is drawn from a natural source, reducing the
 burden of warming up the water for the bathkeepers. No one's bathing
 at the moment, since most people wake up at dawn... The entrance is to
 the east, and the swimming pool is to the south.

 You can see Nivanen and Hairdresser Rana here.

>give ribbon to rana
 Hairdresser Rana doesn't seem interested.

>have threesome
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>Talk to Nivanen
 "Once I've washed my hair I'll go and prepare for lunch. You know,
 they'll be dining in the cliffside balcony today! I don't want to miss
 that. Oh, and if you find Rasha would you please bring him here? I
 want to wash him too. I can't go looking for him like this, with my
 hair wrapped in this awful paste." She gives you a pleading look.

>talk to rana
 "Nice to see you, Farahnaaz," she says without raising her head from
 her origami model.

 Nivanen looks at you from the mirror. "See what she's done to me?" she
 says while pointing to her head. She gestures her other hand in Rana's
 direction, who grins without looking up from her work. "Now I must
 wait here until the herbs do their marvel to my hair. It was her idea,
 not mine," her voice turns into a murmur. "I just showed her the
 sachet of herbs I got from apothecary." She looks up at you again,
 "It's just so... boring!"

 Swimming Pool
 The swimming pool is delightful at times like this; everybody's gone
 after their daily business and it's empty. The water reflects the
 sunlight from the windowed roof above.

 The only exit is to the bath hall to the north.

>dive in pool
 Reluctant to get all wet, but still tempted to feel the water, you sit

 Terrace
 You are on the open terrace by your room. The way to the north is

 Vineyard
 Rows of vines stretch far and wide to the south, southeast and east -
 where they nearly reach the eastern cliffside. Occasionally the vines
 are made to climb circular wooden frames to form leafy pavilions.

 The stone pathway leads to the square to the west, the shady park to
 the north, and eventually the terrace to the northwest. On the ground
 you see some drops of oil.

 You can see Rasha here.

 You go strolling among the vines for a while. You find nothing out of
 the ordinary and come back.

>rasha, come
 There is no reply.

>take rasha
 You take one step towards the cat, but he casually goes the same
 distance away from you. Maybe according to some feline concept of
 private space.

>Lure Rasha with ribbon
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tie ribbon to rasha
 "Hiss!" You now have some stripes on your skin.

>Show ink bottle to Rasha
 Rasha is unimpressed.

>show feather to rasha
 It'd be a pity to ruin such a rare feather only to impress a cat.
 You'd prefer a less regrettable substitute.

>show ribbon to rasha
 Rasha looks at the ribbon as you show it and drag it temptingly out of
 his reach. His pupils get wide and he lies down in a camouflaging
 fashion, tracking his prey. Maybe he'd let go of his prudence and come
 nearer.

>go north

 Shady Park
 Some benches lie in the park, one of which is occupied by an old
 couple who are busy talking to each other. Behind them you can see a
 kingberry bush.

 Rasha regains his composure, mentally forgetting your ribbon.

 You take one step towards the cat, but he casually goes the same
 distance away from you. Maybe according to some feline concept of

 You look ridiculous waving the ribbon.

 Rasha looks at the ribbon as you show it and drag it temptingly out of
 his reach. His pupils get wide and he lies down in a camouflaging
 fashion, tracking his prey. Maybe he'd let go of his prudence and come
 nearer.

>show ribbon to cat
 Rasha crawls closer on his big belly, all his attention focused on the
 ribbon. His flanks bump left and right as he adjusts his thick
 hindlegs for a jump. He no longer pays any attention to you.

>get cat
 You give the ribbon one final tempting pull as Rasha leaps over it.
 While biting at the ribbon, he ignores your two hands as you grab him
 from under his plump arms and lift his heavy body. When he realizes
 he's been lifted, he groans and chews at the ribbon stubbornly.

 Workshop
 You are in the bookcrafter's workshop, a spacious hall for copying,

 The staircase leads up to the library.

 You can see your colleague Arjang here. He is sitting behind his work
 desk.

>give bottle to arjang
 "Many thanks! Now with luck I'll finish this map very soon and pass it
 on. Neat work eh?" You agree it's very well done. He fills his ink pot
 and hands you back the remainder of the kingberry juice. He goes back

 loose hair has no place in the workshop? And please stand back, I
 can't work with your shadow on my map. I'll let you examine it
 thoroughly once it's finished, I promise."

 He inspects the feather carefully, balancing it between his fingers
 "This... is magnificent. It's indeed from a goknous. Where did you get
 it? It doesn't matter. What matters is, I can make you an exceptional
 quill out of it. Wait a minute..."

 He searches around the desk and gathers a knife, a ruler, a pair of
 tweezers and some other tools. Shortly after, he hands you a premium
 quality quill pen. "Here's something to recompense for the ink
 errand." He winks at you and returns to his work.

 You are on the open terrace by your room. The way to the north is
 blocked by the high walls of a private estate surrounded by tall
 trees.

 Some stairs lead downward, to a shady park to the east and eventually
 to the vineyard in the southeast. More stairs lead upward to the west.
 Your room is to the south.

 Vineyard
 Rows of vines stretch far and wide to the south, southeast and east -
 where they nearly reach the eastern cliffside. Occasionally the vines
 are made to climb circular wooden frames to form leafy pavilions.

 The stone pathway leads to the square to the west, the shady park to
 the north, and eventually the terrace to the northwest. On the ground
 you see some drops of oil.

>go west
 You take the path westward which leads to a square in the town.

 Square
 You see a fountain with benches and potted plants in the middle of the
 square. There are roads leading in different directions.

 East leads to the vineyards. The library is to the north. Northwest
 leads to the town center. The town bazaar is to the west. The school
 is to the south, and there's a road to an old temple to the southeast.

 You can see many kids playing here.

 Eastern cliffside
 Near the brink of the cliff the vines grow scarcer but more unruly and
 are gradually replaced with wild herbs. Before the brink there's a
 circular landing platform.

 Under the cliff you can see a narrow section of the town ending at one
 of the minor town gates. Beyond the gate, and far below, lies the
 eastern meadow.

 The only exit is to the west.

>examine vines
 It's a small section of the semi-famous vineyards of Arg Varkana, a
 source of tiny ruby grapes, wine, vinegar, raisins and sweet syrup all
 to consume as well as to export and exchange.

>beam me up, scotty
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>examine herbs
 Some of the wild herbs are burnt, and there's no trace of regrowth.

>examine ribbon
 It's a red ribbon. Used to tie a little girl's hair no doubt.

>give the ribbon to one of the kids?
 You can only do that to something animate.

>Climb vines
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>examine platform
 A conventional landing spot for landing hawks, drakes, or - if from a
 Sarvegnian community or something similar - airborn vehicles. It's
 made from stone, and is circular, measuring about four meters in
 diameter. Three crystalline glow orbs are inlaid within its brim to
 make it recognizable at night.

 Some of the wild herbs around the platform are burnt. From those and
 the fresh oil stains you conclude someone has landed here recently.
 However, it's an obsolete platform, too far from any functioning nest
 to be practical.

>go north

 Library
 You're in the Library of Arg Varkana. It's a big but cozy hall lined
 with rows of bookshelves. Reading tables are at the center and by the
 large windows which allow sunlight during the day. A chandelier hung
 from the ceiling upstairs along with several glowstands scattered
 around the library provide extra illumination in the evening.

 Spiral stairs lead up to the museum, and down to the bookcrafters'
 workshop. The exit is to the south.

 You can see Librarian Houtan here.

>go up
 You climb up the staircase.

 Museum
 The museum is a tidy hall filled with various exhibits, ranging from
 artworks and crafts and old objects to archeological findings.

 Display cases, shelves and tables occupy the most possible space
 without making it difficult to walk. A glass cabinet containing old
 books in a corner draws your attention.

 The only exit is back down the staircase.

 the pilot at high speed. It's bronze in color and has been damaged and

 Town center
 You're in a sunlit plaza which is abundantly decorated with rose
 bushes and cypresses. Public buildings such as the town hall and guild
 headquarters encircle the plaza. Their golden-ochre stone, blue-glazed
 mud brick masonry and crenellated walls are some of the finest in the
 town.

 Northwards from here there's a giant "U" shaped cavity in the
 mountain's natural formation. The town stretches to northeast and
 northwest.

 The staircase on the north leads downward to the cliffside balcony,
 which overlooks the land far below. The bazaar is to the south, and
 the square is to the southeast.

 You can see some town guards scattered around the place.

 You can see some town guards scattered around the place.

>examine guards
 Town guards are dressed in their colorful uniform. They're mostly
 talking to each other. There's occasional laughter here and there. Due
 to the absence of serious threats in these times, you can tell their
 task is no longer as challenging as it used to be.

>examine buildings
 Most of the public buildings are closed for holidays.

>go south

 Bazaar
 The bazaar of Arg Varkana is under high brick domes interconnected
 with vaulted corridors. All kinds of goods from every town in and
 around the Varkana region are traded here. It's usually crowded, but
 today even more so, thanks to the holidays and celebrations. You
 prefer to avoid going too far in the bazaar right now.

 The exits are to the east, north and west.

 Among the nearby merchandise an art stand catches your attention.

 is to the south, and there's a road to an old temple to the southeast.

 You can see many kids playing here.

>se
 You climb a steep road upward and enter the old temple.

 Old Temple
 The interior of this old temple is still relatively intact. There are
 shallow pools of water, and a beautiful dome overhead. The water is
 provided by a natural source boiling out of the mountain rocks and
 flowing from a wall behind a pair of statues. One of the statues
 represents the goddess Amortaad and the other her beast counterpart
 Senmervae.

 You see a little boy sitting on a bench in here.

 At the foot of the statues you see some flowers.

>give ribbon to kids
 You can only do that to something animate.

 The fountains don't work and the mossy pools need cleaning. Still,
 stream water flows gently in the pools.

>Ask boy about him
 There is no reply.

>kids, clean pool
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>prise stone from statue
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine amortaad
 The life size figure chiselled on stone represents the once popular
 goddess Amortaad. She is still worshipped, you remind yourself, but no
 entire temple is dedicated to her anymore.

 The figure is adorned with a necklace of gilded vine leaves, beads of
 lapis lazuli, and armbands with lion heads (a more ceremonial version
 of the ones you have). Her jet-inlaid eyes are outlined with thick
 black lines and she carries six weapons on her back; reminding you of
 Varkana's tradition of initiating a warrior to all those six weapons
 before letting them specialize in one.

>examine weapons
 The statue of Amortaad has a sword, an axe, a mace, a bow, a javelin
 and a baton.

>Put ribbon on statue
 Putting things on the statues would achieve nothing.

>take javelin
 They're fixed in place.

>examine beast
 This statue represents a fabulous beast, which resembles a winged lion
 with ram horns, on whose back the goddess would ride out from her home
 at the source of the sacred river Surana on top of high mountains to
 visit lands and peoples (there is a debate on the location of the
 mountains; some even go so far to suggest they are somewhere in an
 old, distant world).

 The lion's head and eyes are inlaid with colorful stones and the scaly
 neck is covered with a glistening green enamel. Senmervae's images
 often adorn schools, libraries and scientific books, because people
 associate it with science and knowledge.

 The heavy book contains praises to spirits, elements, constellations
 and gods. Including records of the offerings and libations to those
 entities from the kings, queens and heros, and the constructions that
 were built for their love and honor.

 direction when you were a new apprentice.

 It's a one-man vehicle with a saddle instead of a seat; less cozy but
 easier to manoeuvre. It has a transparent shield in front to protect
 the pilot at high speed. It's bronze in color and has been damaged and

 Ashtartan-made, it can't be one of those fabulous ones Nivanen saw
 last night.

 Library
 You're in the Library of Arg Varkana. It's a big but cozy hall lined
 with rows of bookshelves. Reading tables are at the center and by the
 large windows which allow sunlight during the day. A chandelier hung
 from the ceiling upstairs along with several glowstands scattered
 around the library provide extra illumination in the evening.

 Spiral stairs lead up to the museum, and down to the bookcrafters'
 workshop. The exit is to the south.

 You can see Librarian Houtan here.

>kiss houtan
 To express your affection, you blow a kiss to Librarian Houtan.

>examine houtan
 Houtan is a good-natured, merry, elderly man who loves to talk (and
 he's good at that; he always has things to say on various topics) with
 a red face, thining hair, and blond scrolled moustaches. He attends to
 the library very well, giving a lot more than what his job demands of
 him.

>ask houtan about ardavaan
 Librarian Houtan rubs his chin, trying to remember where he left off.
 "Hmm. Yes, he was very dry and nearly hostile, until I talked about
 the topics that attracted his attention."

 He pauses for a while, studying you, then adds, "Hmm, he's not social
 and appreciates his privacy here so I did not inform anyone of his
 arrival. But... maybe you can talk to him further? However, he lacks a
 night's sleep and seemed frustrated after being encircled by fair
 women of your age. So be careful. This fresh opportunity, as well as
 his unguarded enthusiasm, may fade after official meetings and new
 ties."

 Even though he didn't mention it, you can tell he is somehow worried.
 You're not quite convinced however, and he seems to read it on your
 face. You weigh your thoughts before you decide to discuss the topic
 further.

>Ask Houtan about Ardavaan
 Your further inquisition lightens him up. "I know you so well that I
 believe you'll truly benefit from this precious opportunity to discuss
 things first-handedly with an Ashtartan. This one in particular seems
 to have common interests with you, which you could use to start a
 conversation with him. In a wider scope..."

 He pauses a moment, his expression getting serious, "It might give us
 a thin chance to start our relations with less influence from...
 businessmen, politicans and soldiers." He utters the last words with a
 hint of disgust. "Sarvegnians will follow Ashtartans' example,
 remember when I told you this. We better let it be as incorrupt an
 example as possible."

 Even though you don't share his concern (which makes you feel a bit...
 guilty) you don't have the heart to refuse him a request; something he
 almost never makes. You finally agree to talk to Ardavaan, which seems
 to be the only thing Librarian Houtan hoped to hear. He regains his
 composure and smiles at you.

 You see Ardavaan's vehicle leaning next to a pillar.

 You can also see Ardavaan here.

>ask ardavaan about books
 (the books)
 "Much that has faded from memory may be reawakened through written
 words... If you know where to look."

>talk to ardavaan
 Gathering your courage, you find a place on the other side of the book
 pile and fetch a cushion to sit on. Ardavaan, who was momentarily
 distracted, turns his attention back to the book before him. You try
 to sound as unobtrusive as possible, "Well, um... if I can help you
 with finding something, just let me know. I work here. And I'm
 familiar with such topics," you point to the big book he's studying.

 "You're... familiar with the written myths. I'll try not to forget
 it." His eyes remain fixed on the book. You frown, and can't help
 retaliating, "To put it in such a crude manner, yes. This one we're
 looking at, for example, took two months of work. I redid the binding,
 repaired the pictures, and even some of the text. I'm indeed familiar
 with the written myths." You instantly regret your tactlessness. That
 wasn't quite you.

 He trails the contours of a picture with his fingertip, "So, you
 repair books?"

 "Mainly, yes. I mean, I do illustrations in the bookcrafters'
 workshop. Especially gilded images."

 "You must receive plenty of comissions."

 His brief compliment doesn't totally cheer you, but you recover your
 modesty, "Oh... not often these days. And it's just thanks to my
 mentor, Behzaad, that I managed to make it this far."

 "He chooses the books for you?" You'd swear his gaze just intensified.
 You reply nevertheless, "Seldom, his apprentices share the work
 themselves becau-" "Has... Behzaad... chosen a book for you?"

 You feel a tingling in the back of your neck. "Yes, recently he told
 me to repair an old poem book from the museum's collection just before
 he left town, which I haven't done yet. Uh... what?" The tingling goes
 as quickly as it came. You wonder if it was your imagination.

 A smile crosses his lips, "From what I hear, the last task he requests
 from his pupils is usually an extraordinary one. I wonder what's in
 that old poem book he asked you to repair. Something exciting, no
 doubt." He carefully closes the big book before him. "I must go and
 join the other ambassadors now. I wish I could stay here longer, or
 visit the old temple over there to do a drawing of Senmervae. But my
 time is short..." He gets up and starts tidying the books on a table.

 "Perhaps I can do it? The drawing, I mean," you ask hesitantly.

 "Ah, actually I'd really appreciate that. If you have time, of
 course."

 "I do, besides, it's a pleasant thing to draw. See you at lunch, I
 guess."

 You watch as he mounts his vehicle and silently glides away. You rub
 your neck and wonder what Houtan will think... You shrug; diplomacy
 has never been your forte.

 Vineyard
 Rows of vines stretch far and wide to the south, southeast and east -
 where they nearly reach the eastern cliffside. Occasionally the vines
 are made to climb circular wooden frames to form leafy pavilions.

 The stone pathway leads to the square to the west, the shady park to
 the north, and eventually the terrace to the northwest. On the ground
 you see some drops of oil.

 You can see Rasha and Nivanen here.

 Nivanen is now dressed up in her colorful guard suit and carries her
 six weapons on her back. Rasha wrinkles his nose and watches you
 suspiciously.

 "Ha, thanks again for bringing Rasha to me. What's up? ... I'm going
 to the town center. Remember the lunch will be served on the cliffside
 balcony, and it's your turn to be my guest." You thank her and assure
 her that you'll be there.

 You cross the shady park, and climb up the stairs to reach the
 terrace.

 Terrace
 You are on the open terrace by your room. The way to the north is

 trees.

 Some stairs lead downward, to a shady park to the east and eventually
 to the vineyard in the southeast. More stairs lead upward to the west.
 Your room is to the south.

 You can see many kids playing here.

 You can also see Nivanen here.

 You climb a steep road upward and enter the old temple.

 Old Temple
 The interior of this old temple is still relatively intact. There are
 shallow pools of water, and a beautiful dome overhead. The water is
 provided by a natural source boiling out of the mountain rocks and
 flowing from a wall behind a pair of statues. One of the statues
 represents the goddess Amortaad and the other her beast counterpart
 Senmervae.

 You see a little boy sitting on a bench in here.

 At the foot of the statues you see some flowers.

>draw picture of senmervae
 You can't see any such thing.

>draw senmervae
 You put the paper and the ink bottle on the floor and carefully start
 tracing the figure on the paper. After a while, the little boy comes
 up and watches from behind your shoulder as you add the details.

 "How do you do that?" He finally breaks the silence.

 "Drawing? I train a lot. It's my hobby and job," you reply while doing
 the finishing touches.

 He leans on you as you hold up the finished drawing, his nose almost
 touching the paper. "Whoa! It's superb!" Due to his sudden weight on
 you, your elbow tips the kingberry juice bottle which rolls away and
 crashes into a shallow pool. You sigh in relief for holding the
 drawing up. He apologizes and gets back on the bench, promising to
 clean up the mess later.

 Bazaar
 The bazaar of Arg Varkana is under high brick domes interconnected
 with vaulted corridors. All kinds of goods from every town in and
 around the Varkana region are traded here. It's usually crowded, but
 today even more so, thanks to the holidays and celebrations. You
 prefer to avoid going too far in the bazaar right now.

 The exits are to the east, north and west.

 Among the nearby merchandise an art stand catches your attention.

>go north
 You make your way through the crowd and get out of the bazaar.

 Town center
 You're in a sunlit plaza which is abundantly decorated with rose
 bushes and cypresses. Public buildings such as the town hall and guild
 headquarters encircle the plaza. Their golden-ochre stone, blue-glazed
 mud brick masonry and crenellated walls are some of the finest in the
 town.

 Northwards from here there's a giant "U" shaped cavity in the
 mountain's natural formation. The town stretches to northeast and
 northwest.

 The staircase on the north leads downward to the cliffside balcony,
 which overlooks the land far below. The bazaar is to the south, and
 the square is to the southeast.

 You can see some town guards scattered around the place.

>go north

 Cliffside balcony
 The natural terraced balcony is surrounded by ornate gardens and
 overlooks the deep canyon down below. It's a popular spot for
 celebrations and other public events.

 Numerous tables and chairs are occupied by townspeople, on which tasty
 food and good wine are served. Waiters constantly move about and tend
 to every request.

 The staircase leads up to the town center.

 You can also see Nivanen, Ashtartan ambassadors, some friends, some
 townspeople, Marita, Lady Atossa, Rasha and some waiters here.

 Nivanen beckons you to a nearby table populated by a group of your
 friends. You both go there and sit down, getting involved in
 conversation and eating.

>Look at ambassadors
 They are handsome men and women indeed, all wearing neat
 gold-embroidered suits decorated with medals and insignia. They are
 seated at two tables, with Lady Atossa and some other high-ranking
 officials, and are busily engaged in conversation.

 However, you can't find Ardavaan anywhere among them. This suddenly
 alarms you... Looks like he didn't go joining his colleagues as he had
 told you. You wonder what Nivanen would make out of it.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>examine lunch
 Saffron rice with roasted almonds, turkey in pomegranate and walnut
 sauce, barberry glazed chicken... along with sherbet and wine.
 Everything at its best.

 You notice Rasha climbing up the stairs. He then quickly runs off and
 disappears from sight.

>say mmmmmm pomegranate
 Whom do you want to say that to?

>rasha
 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to atossa
 She's sitting far from you. At any case you wouldn't dare disturb her.

>examine atossa
 The sovereign of Varkana (also called Argbaan, which in local dialect
 means "the guardian of the fortified town") looks strikingly regal,
 which is not due to her glistening tiara or amazing blue dress but
 something more profound.

 She's seated at the same table with some Ashtartan ambassadors and
 diplomats. But she doesn't quite participate in the seemingly heated
 conversation which is going on around the table and has a rather
 thoughtful air about her.

 Marita, her cheetah companion, is snoozing at her feet.

 [Picture number 6 here.]


>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>Look at Marita
 While still a cub this cheetah was rescued from a fire incident in the
 woods by a group of firefighters accompanied by the then Argbaan
 to-be, Lady Atossa herself. She favors Marita a lot and the two are
 good friends. Some even say Marita is likely to express the feelings
 her mistress hides behind a calm face.

 Marita has stretched her graceful, variegated body on the floor near
 the table. She's seemingly snoozing at her mistress's feet. Her long
 tail, however, is tapping on the floor in an uncomfortable rhythm.

>examine weapons
 The traditional weapon set of a Varkana warrior consists of a sword,
 an axe, a mace, a bow, a javelin and a baton. All are slender-built
 and are strapped on the back. Sometimes the weapon in which they
 specialize is larger, which is not the case for Nivanen's axe.

 arrival since he came.

 "Looks a bit suspicious. A shy ambassador who comes here for...
 drawing and reading books. Hmm... Librarian Houtan could do with more
 prudence. But for now, I'll go and take a look. Perhaps he just got
 lost in the town bazaar or something. He'd surely regret missing this
 lunch." Nivanen says as she takes her weapons to strap them to her
 back. "Me too, I hope he's just lost..." "Let's go search, and perhaps
 ask for aid."

 Nivanen excuses the two of you from the others at the table and
 hurries to the staircase, beckoning you to follow.

>fight nivanen
 She blocks your attack "Hey, watch it you, flimsy!"

 Nivanen is telling a group of guards that an ambassador is missing,
 which makes them burst in laughter. "I wish it was I who'd been
 tasting our best wine reserve and counting Ashtartans today, and you
 watching all of the town descend from these stairs. Profit from your
 time off before your patrol schedule, girl." Nivanen's face blushes in
 rage, making her look close to drunk.

 "Well I hope you'll be rewarded for your superb vigilance. But I'm
 telling you he did NOT signal his arrival..." "And I'm telling you,
 you better watch your tone while wearing that uniform, you're
 embarrassing us..." another guard snaps, while the one next to him
 stops him and adds calmly "There are only eight Ashtartans in this
 town. I myself escorted them to the hotel last night. No more arrivals
 are expected. So, kindly go back to your lunch like a good recruit on
 her time off." "Unlike some, I've never gotten drunk in public, old
 timer. Today's no exception."

 Nivanen holds her chin up and comes to you. "Well, unless you've
 dreamt up this Ardavaan we have to find him by ourselves." "Trust me,
 he's real - you can ask Houtan if you don't believe me." "I believe
 you. I'm sorry... Look, I'll go search in the bazaar. It might take
 some time. Meanwhile you can search anywhere else you can think of
 finding him; the old temple, vineyards, whatever. And I'll have a word
 with Librarian Houtan afterwards. See you soon I hope."

 Nivanen takes the south road to the direction of bazaar and
 disappears.

>go north
 You cross Librarian Houtan who's leaving the library. He doesn't pay
 attention to you, as if you are not there. You turn and watch him
 continue his way south. You'd swear something was not right... You
 call him, but he doesn't stop.

 Library
 You're in the Library of Arg Varkana. It's a big but cozy hall lined
 with rows of bookshelves. Reading tables are at the center and by the
 large windows which allow sunlight during the day. A chandelier hung
 from the ceiling upstairs along with several glowstands scattered
 around the library provide extra illumination in the evening.

 Spiral stairs lead up to the museum, and down to the bookcrafters'
 workshop. The exit is to the south.

>go up

 Museum
 The museum is a tidy hall filled with various exhibits, ranging from
 artworks and crafts and old objects to archeological findings.

 Display cases, shelves and tables occupy the most possible space
 without making it difficult to walk. A glass cabinet containing old
 books in a corner draws your attention.

 The only exit is back down the staircase.

 You can also see Rasha and Ardavaan here.

 "Farahnaaz... How kind of you to have brought us light." Rasha's eyes
 glitter from within Ardavaan's arms as he turns the cat from the
 display cases to let it face you. Ardavaan's eyes are closed but the
 cat is watching you intently. After being carefully placed on the
 ground, Rasha blinks a few times in confusion and Ardavaan opens his
 eyes. He comes to you and snatches the glow orb from your hand. "You
 have our gratitude. A glow orb... I'm embarrassed it did not cross my
 mind."

 He continues scanning the exhibits, your gaze and Rasha's following
 him. He suddenly halts, and brings the glow orb near a show case
 containing some old books. After a few seconds of fiddling with the
 lock with some strange metal wires, he opens the glass door and picks
 up the poem book. "Despite my admiration for your craft, Farahnaaz,
 and your excitement for the task, I should keep this one away from
 your creative hands." You turn for the exit. "Anyways, I'd be curious
 to know, why have you come here before the museum opens? If you don't
 mind explaining..." He cocks his head to one side, spinning the glow
 orb in his hand. You struggle for an answer as he goes and stands
 between you and the exit. "... So?"

>ask ardavaan about behzaad
 "So he has even been to your town. I knew the old jackal back in
 Ashtarta. He is a remarkable craftsman indeed... And you say, he just
 left the town?"

 You nod. "Yesterday afternoon."

 He looks away. "Lucky him..." You wait for him to continue, but he
 doesn't seem to intend to.

 It'd be a good idea to convince him you're not here just to spy on
 him, improbable as it may sound...

 Which do you mean, the bookshelves, the old books, the poem book or

>poem
 "Yes, that's what I came here for."

 Ardavaan is getting impatient.

>kiss ardavaan
 Something about his sharp gaze freaks you out. No way.

 "So, assuming you've come for a stroll... I still cannot let you alarm
 others to come and chase me. But fatigue does not allow me to focus
 well, so don't fight or it'll be fatal." Without giving you any time
 to absorb his odd warning, his hands reach out for your head. Each
 finger is pressed on a point, resulting in a tingling sensation in
 your head and spine. On reflex you struggle to free yourself. He
 gasps, and the tingling spreads everywhere and you drift into a
 slumber.

 You are in the bookcrafter's workshop, a spacious hall for copying,

 The staircase leads up to the library.

 You can see your colleague Arjang here. He's fallen asleep behind his
 desk.

>examine arjang
 You don't remember seeing Arjang sleeping at his desk before... and
 the map he was working on is nowhere to be seen. Perhaps he thought to
 remove it from the desk before taking a nap. It's quite possible; you

 "Oh, you've already made the drawing of Senmervae? Interesting..."

 You give the drawing to Ardavaan. He holds it up and studies it for a
 moment "Truly impressive... I regret not being able to reward you."
 You tell him not to think of it, while contemplating whether there's
 somebody around who could hear if you screamed. Even if someone could
 hear you, though, they probably wouldn't respond in time. "Well, now
 that I got what I was looking for I must leave. Your face shows what
 you think..." he smiles briefly "... but believe me, I truly need this
 book, it's very important." His voice is slighty strained with
 weariness. He descends the staircase, with Rasha following him.

 You hear him calling up "And your friends will awaken in an hour,
 don't worry. All they need is some natural sleep. I was too tired to
 resort to something... more subtle."

 It is now pitch dark in here!

>go south
 Library's Terrace
 You see Nivanen coming up the road. "Halt, Ashtartan!" She calls out.

 You can see Rasha and Ardavaan here.

 Ardavaan seems to be confused. He gives you a poisonous look. "Do you
 know what happened to my vehicle?" You hesitate, "Well, didn't it need
 repairs?" "You nuisance... I will..." He turns to Nivanen and raises
 his hands in surrender.

 "Ardavaan is it? Your arrival as an ambassador was not expected." He
 smirks, "Now, that's surprising. So, they've sent only you to welcome
 the last ambassador?" "Sort of. Please come with me..." "Sure. I will
 follow your lead."

 You tell Nivanen that he stole a book from the museum. He laughs. "And
 she somehow disposed of my vehicle. Maybe you can arrest two thieves
 at a time?" "Don't move!" "I'm not. See?..." As he raises his hands
 higher to prove his surrender, you see something sparkle out of the
 corner of your eye. For a brief moment Nivanen is distracted too,
 which is enough for Ardavaan's hands to reach and grab your head from
 behind. Nivanen warns him that he can't escape, but doesn't dare
 strike him with you at his mercy. Your head and spine start to tingle,
 and you think you hear Ardavaan talking to Nivanen...

 "I will follow your lead, guard. Just as I said." Ardavaan lets go of
 Farahnaaz, who stands dazed before him. "What did you do to her?!" You
 try hard not to panic. Ardavaan motions you to unwield your axe, which
 you ignore. "Your friend is bound to me for as long as I need her." He
 smiles menacingly, "She deprived me of my vehicle, so it's only fair
 to make her pay for it. She's now in a trance. Lead me to the Royal
 Nest, raise no alarm, and all of us will be fine." Your gaze shifts
 from Ardavaan to Farahnaaz. You finally lower your axe, and
 reluctantly return it to your back strap. Rasha comes near you and
 rubs himself against your feet.

 Your mace is rougly shaped like a bull's head. You don't remember the

 It's a slightly-curved short sword. In Arg Varkana they forge blades
 light and swift.

>examine bow
 You're more into close combat, still, you'd make an acceptable
 markswoman.

>examine javelin
 The only times you remember putting it to a real use was when you were
 helping a street sweeper unclog a water canal, and when you were
 trying to keep an old barn's gates shut against an angry bull.

>examine baton
 This once-popular weapon can interfere with perception and
 concentration, which is handy for or against illusionists. Its gem is
 running out of charge though. Wasn't it for the Argbaan's insistance
 to not to abandon it (she has even ordered a new delivery of gems, a
 big waste of money in your opinion), no one would bother with this
 expensive weapon except for the traditional attire.

 today even more so, thanks to the holidays and celebrations.

 The exits are to the east, north and west.

 There are many people walking or loading and unloading stuff here, but
 you can eventually reach to the west of bazaar if you try. Rasha is
 groaning and hissing to the crowd, and the hair on his back stands up.

 You can also see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha here.

 It's not appropriate to use it in this way...

>go west
 As you make way Ardavaan follows you with Farahnaaz by his side. He
 tries to shield her from bumping into people and handcarts while
 controlling her steps. His teeth are clenched... You come to his aid
 by walking on the other side of Farahnaaz, worrying more for your
 friend than for him.

 Once out of the bazaar, Ardavaan suddenly turns to you, "Where is your
 cat?" Without a word you run back to the bazaar.

 You trace all your way back and finally find Rasha, who's been stamped
 on and run over without being noticed. There are cats who live in such
 places. But your poor Rasha was not one of them. You sit there for a
 long time, weeping, and ignore people's inquiries and consolation.

 When you finally get up and leave the bazaar, but you realize Ardavaan
 and Farahnaaz are nowhere to be seen. Only hours later you find out
 that they were spotted and halted by town guards, and fought to their
 death.

 Ardavaan growls in pain and beckons to Farahnaaz, who lunges towards
 you. You try to kick her back without harming her seriously, but your
 legs suddenly get numb and falter. As you fall, Ardavaan pulls
 Farahnaaz and limps backwards, holding an odd handgun in his other
 hand. He has a tormented, weary expression as he watches the
 paralyzation engulfing your body...

 This once-popular weapon can interfere with perception and
 concentration, which is handy for or against illusionists. Its gem is
 running out of charge though. Wasn't it for the Argbaan's insistance
 to not to abandon it (she has even ordered a new delivery of gems, a
 big waste of money in your opinion), no one would bother with this
 expensive weapon except for the traditional attire.

>go south

 Vineyard
 Rows of vines stretch far and wide to the south, southeast and east -
 where they nearly reach the eastern cliffside. Occasionally the vines
 are made to climb circular wooden frames to form leafy pavilions.

 The stone pathway leads to the square to the west, the shady park to
 the north, and eventually the terrace to the northwest. On the ground
 you see some drops of oil.

 You can see Ardavaan and Farahnaaz here.

>go west
 You take the path westward which leads to a square in the town.

 Square
 You see a fountain with benches and potted plants in the middle of the
 square. There are roads leading in different directions.

 East leads to the vineyards. The library is to the north. Northwest
 leads to the town center. The town bazaar is to the west. The school
 is to the south, and there's a road to an old temple to the southeast.

 You can see many kids playing here.

 You can also see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Librarian Houtan here.

>go west

 Bazaar
 The bazaar of Arg Varkana is under high brick domes interconnected
 with vaulted corridors. All kinds of goods from every town in and
 around the Varkana region are traded here. It's usually crowded, but
 today even more so, thanks to the holidays and celebrations.

 The exits are to the east, north and west.

 There are many people walking or loading and unloading stuff here, but
 you can eventually reach to the west of bazaar if you try. Rasha is
 groaning and hissing to the crowd, and the hair on his back stands up.

 You can also see Ardavaan and Farahnaaz here.

>go west
 As you make way Ardavaan follows you with Farahnaaz by his side. He
 tries to shield her from bumping into people and handcarts while
 controlling her steps. His teeth are clenched... You come to his aid
 by walking on the other side of Farahnaaz, worrying more for your
 friend than for him.

 Once out of the bazaar, Ardavaan rubs his temples and murmurs he hopes
 he won't have to do it again. You put Rasha down. He seems happy to be
 on his feet again.

 Bridge
 The old brick bridge overlooks a small market, and links the Royal
 Nest on northwest to the town bazaar on east.

 You can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha here.

 Cargo terrace (Royal Nest)
 The cargo terrace is a moderately sized platform for temporarily
 storing all kinds of shipments that arrive or are waiting to be sent
 by air. Chariots and wheels and strapped packs line the wall, used to
 load or unload heavy stuff.

 There's a trapdoor on the floor, and a path to the southeast.

 No one noticed you borrowing the keys last night due to the guests'
 arrival. But it'll be impossible to try it again now. You look up at
 Ardavaan and shake your head, "Forget about the keys, they're kept by
 the staff. Oh, and it's locked." He motions for you to step aside,
 while searching in his pockets.

>hit ardavaan with axe
 Trying to harm Ardavaan with the axe won't get you anywhere.

 As you withdraw from the trapdoor Ardavaan takes your place. He
 inserts a lockpick into the keyhole and manipulates its wires but to
 no avail. "It will be easier to simply break the lock," he concludes
 while putting the lockpick back into his pocket.

>attack ardavaan with axe
 Trying to harm Ardavaan with the axe won't get you anywhere.

>hit lock with axe
 You raise your axe and land it on the lock. You quickly check your axe

 As you withdraw from the trapdoor Ardavaan takes your place. He weighs
 your axe and checks its landing position, then strikes with force.
 Your axe lands on the lock with an amazing precision. A third strike
 breaks the lock.

 Your amazement is short-lived, however. As he opens the trapdoor he
 hands you back your axe with three unsightly dents on its blade.

 You descend into a network of tunnels. Ardavaan draws a glow orb from
 his robes and you lead him in the approximate direction of the Royal
 Nest's vehicle hangar. Behind a locked door you hold the glow orb for
 Ardavaan so that he can handle his lockpick. From his trembling hands
 and sweated brow you can tell maintaining constant control on
 Farahnaaz is wearing him out... A few times she stumbles in her
 trance, but Ardavaan reaches for her on time.

 For your part, your cat tends to go astray in the labyrinth and is
 deaf to your commands. Ardavaan catches Rasha before he finally pushes
 the last door open. You gasp in amazement; you're right behind the
 large Ashtartan vessel you saw last night and it looks even more
 gorgeous from up close.

 Disgruntled, Rasha knocks the glow orb off Ardavaan's hand. It drops
 and shatters into tiny splinters.

 Hangar (Royal Nest)
 The hangar is a spacious chamber with a high ceiling. Unlike the noisy
 halls where flying beasts perch, this place is clean of hay and
 doesn't smell.

 An access door for the passengers and the staff lies to the north. A
 pair of sliding gates lead to the landing platform to the west and are
 currently closed. The entrance to the tunnels is to the east.

 There's a large Ashtartan vessel in middle of chamber, with two
 identical one-man vehicles by its sides.

 Ardavaan walks around the large vessel while inspecting it. He then
 goes to a one-man vehicle, but shakes his head, "It's too dark here
 without the glow orb." He calls on you to help him open the sliding
 gates so that more light can enter the hangar.

>Kick Ardavaan
 Ardavaan grabs your wrist and punches you in the face with his other
 hand. The sound and feeling of the impact is nauseating, but you
 strike him hard with your free hand which has already drawn a weapon.
 Ardavaan growls in pain and beckons to Farahnaaz, who lunges towards
 you. You try to kick her back without harming her seriously, but your
 legs suddenly get numb and falter. As you fall, Ardavaan pulls
 Farahnaaz and limps backwards, holding an odd handgun in his other
 hand. He has a tormented, weary expression as he watches the
 paralyzation engulfing your body...

 Ardavaan kneels by one of the one-man vehicles. He hastily opens a
 small shaft on the engine and snaps something inside which produces a
 few sparks. He then closes the shaft, absently licking two burnt
 fingertips. You remind him to awaken Farahnaaz before leaving. He
 doesn't reply.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>throw javelin at ardavaan
 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

 Ardavaan hurries to the second one-man vehicle. You block his way, "If
 you don't do it right now, you won't leave." "If you insist. But I
 don't promise anything." "You don't?" "I'd risk irreversible failure.
 I need rest." "But you can't rest, even if I stand watch..." "Don't
 pretend to be an imbecile, Nivanen. We'll fly away from here and I'll
 awaken her once I'm rested." "Ah, and you'll send us back on foot. You
 forgot where we are." He shrugs, "Or you'll come with me to somewhere
 I can arrange you a flight back. Now..."

 He motions for you to stand aside, and you obey - much to your
 surprise. He repeats the same procedure on the second small vehicle.
 You wince when his hand burns again.

 You hear muffled voices from behind the access door, and the sound of
 a key turning in the keyhole.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Ardavaan raises the hood of the large vessel and releases Rasha who
 jumps inside. Then he lifts Farahnaaz and places her in the back seat.
 Farahnaaz's eyes close and her head drops to her chest.

 The door is pushed open. Four watchmen rush in and call you to freeze.
 You wish you could have somehow delayed their coming... but too late.
 Ardavaan tells you to remain steady, and demands that you give him a
 weapon to distract them.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "You don't have any weapon yourself?" "I... Quickly, Nivanen, I need
 one of your weapons!" "No... I prefer we capture you alive than dead."

 The watchmen are momentarily surprised to find an ambassador and a
 town guard inside. They ask what you're doing here. Your gaze meets
 Ardavaan's and you take one step back in alarm, but too late. Frenzied
 for not having been given a weapon, he seizes your shoulder and
 forcefully hurls you to the nearest watchman. You go head first into
 his chest and you both fall. You see the legs of the second man go
 limp, and he drops to the ground near you, motionless. The third one
 gets savagely kicked in the ribs, but the last one leaps for Ardavaan
 and strives to prevent him from escaping into the vessel. The first
 watchman shoves you aside, gets up, and charges his crossbow. At the
 first opportunity he releases a metal bolt aimed at his target's neck.

 You come over to Ardavaan but he's already dead; the pool of his blood
 on the floor constantly expanding. Hung from the chain around his neck
 you can now see the unmistakable Ember medallion sticking out of his
 collar, depicting a red goknous bird rising from gray ashes. His hand
 holds a pistol of some sort. A watchman gently pushes you aside and
 covers his dead body. You yell at him for not having captured him
 instead. He replies that he was too dangerous and uncontrollable. The
 sadness in his voice turns your attention to the body of his colleague
 who's been paralyzed to death... by Ardavaan's gun. You go to the
 vessel and see Farahnaaz is still asleep. However, upon closer
 inspection you realize she isn't breathing.

>give axe to ardavaan
 No way you're going to give your axe to Ardavaan again. You hand him
 your javelin instead. "Well I could do with a javelin."

 You obey the watchmen and hold your hands up. Ardavaan casts you a
 side glance and slowly does the same, however, you're now wiser than
 to take it for surrender. A prickling flows up your arms and you
 realize you're unable to move them. You're then engulfed with a
 sensation not unlike falling from a great height, and in your panic
 you no longer hear the questions they are asking.

 Ardavaan draws a deep breath. Then with a sudden jolt your arms and
 his are thrown forth. The men are all transfixed with an unseen power.
 With a powerful, commanding voice Ardavaan tells them to get out and
 immediately runs toward them. Dazed, they rush for the door without
 question. He then closes and bars the door by putting your javelin
 behind the slender columns which decorate the entrance; what, you
 regret, didn't cross your own mind before. As soon as he bars the
 door, you hear the men yelling and hitting the door in an attempt to
 break it open. Ardavaan runs back to the vessel and turns on the
 engine while you enter the seat next to the pilot. He then steers the
 vessel out of the hangar.

 Above the clouds (in vessel)
 In vessel you can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha.

 You sink into your seat, occasionally moving your arms and hands to
 make sure they're in your command. Ardavaan gives you a playful smile,
 "I briefly channeled your force without your permission." "Yes, you
 leeched something out of me. Are you happy with it?" "I'm just glad
 you didn't resist. But if I'm not mistaken, in Arg Varkana people
 don't know how to do it." "Do what?" His smile fades, "You don't block
 your minds to intrusions." "Well, we guardians learn some stuff about
 it and get some training, but since we have no use for it most tend to
 forget." "You've been fortunate, but it won't last long." "If there
 are more of your kind in Ashtarta... I hope our Argbaan knows about
 it." He nods. "Lady Atossa knows. And she did so even before I warned
 her."

 Your eyes widen in surprise. But he firmly changes the topic, "Now,
 let's see where we can stop to rest. There should be a map behind my
 seat. Please take it, I need you to find us a destination."

 Whatever his motives, Ardavaan managed to steal the poem book and has
 now escaped with his life. You trust his word on restoring Farahnaaz
 and sending you back home, and both of you keep to this temporary
 truce, but somewhere in the back of your mind you wish you could have
 discovered more about him and his mission. Perhaps you could have
 tried harder to gain his trust... You shrug; he may have escaped from
 Varkana, but he's still in your grasp - from your new point of view.
 Future adventures seem unavoidable. You try to brace yourself for
 whatever lies ahead.

 Hangar (Royal Nest) (in vessel)
 The hangar is a spacious chamber with a high ceiling. Unlike the noisy
 halls where flying beasts perch, this place is clean of hay and

 An access door for the passengers and the staff lies to the north. A
 pair of sliding gates lead to the landing platform to the west. The
 entrance to the tunnels is to the east.

 In vessel you can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha.

 Your javelin that was barring the door finally breaks and the door
 opens. Four armed watchmen rush in and tell you to freeze. They're
 momentarily surprised to see an ambassador and a town guard inside,
 but that doesn't last for long as they see you trying for escape. A
 metal bolt charged with blinding smoke crashes into the vessel's hood,
 but you dodge and quickly discard it through the same hole it bore in
 the hood. Ardavaan steers the vessel out of hangar. Two watchmen get
 into the small vehicles only to find them disabled.

 You hear Ardavaan laughing as he pulls a lever. The sudden
 acceleration presses your body into the back of your seat.

 Above the clouds (in vessel)
 In vessel you can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha.

 "They surely aim well. If it wasn't for your thoughtfulness to bar the
 door, they would have gotten us." "It was the best solution I could
 think of... Now, would you tell me why you came all the way to steal
 this book? Because, well, it doesn't make any sense to me..." He
 studies your face before he replies, "It's a long story, but with the
 time you bought me in the hangar and trusting me - not to mention
 showing me the way - I guess I'll tell you."

 He sits back and stares ahead. "You see, after the overthrow of the
 Ashtartan monarchy..." "So it's true that there was a monarchy?" "...
 Of course. Well, after the change in the regime, those with official
 posts in the former regime were persecuted. I was in the Royal
 Ashtartan Engineers' Guild; a guild too important to be disrupted
 since many professions depend on it, so they spared us.

 Meanwhile, due to my interests, I ended up joining the Ashtartan
 branch of the Ember Order; the famous order of scholars dedicated to
 historical research, archaeological expeditions and ancient lore." You
 nod your acknowledgement. The Order is well-known, even in Varkana. He
 goes on, "The council is working on a new presentation of history to
 gain a foothold and legitimate its position. I knew they wouldn't
 tolerate one of their own officials - especially one who had served
 the monarchy - joining the troublesome Order who doesn't share their
 interests. So I kept it secret, and pretended I was just trying to
 convince those scholars to support the council.

 The Order occasionally benefits from the services of astral
 travellers. Not long ago, I was sent to one of their hideouts deep in
 a jungle to ask for their service. Their priestess kindly accepted my
 request and prepared for the ritual. However, little did I know that I
 had been secretly followed by one of my own colleagues from the
 guild." He absently rubs the scar on his chin. "... After she lay on
 the dais and projected her soul from her body, my colleague released a
 charge of disruptive energy and nearly destroyed her link. He was
 captured, but too late; the damage was already done.

 I couldn't let my negligence cost the priestess her life, so I
 consulted her people, and together we managed to locate a list of
 potential cures. Volunteers went after each one. I selected three
 items, and now I've got two of them, one of them being this book of
 poetry.

 I knew some ambassadors would be departing for Arg Varkana, so I asked
 to join them while announcing that I intended to seek this book for
 the Ember scholars in an exchange for informative historical data that
 could further the council's agenda. I was granted permission, but a
 few days before our departure, my colleague who had escaped from his
 captivity arrived at Ashtarta to give me away and probably later claim
 my post. Fortunately I escaped before I was arrested.

 However, I still took the risk of using my Ashtartan uniform as a
 disguise to come and navigate Arg Varkana, and interrogate its people
 for the book. I knew your Argbaan well enough to know she'd understand
 and trust me as before... Unlike Behzaad, my old mentor who also
 educated Farahnaaz: the fact that I wasn't persecuted after the change
 in regime troubled him, so he didn't contact me again. It seems he's
 had his resources, and somehow reached the conclusion that Ashtartans
 sought this book for some vile reason, so he told Farahnaaz to
 "repair" the book - which would neutralize its property - before he
 left."

 Ardavaan draws the poem book and opens it before you. "It may look
 like an ordinary old book, but it contains the chants that strengthen
 the lost astral traveller to bring her back, if directly read from
 these pages. The other thing I've collected is a seed of the rare
 soulbeam flower. If planted nearby, it acts as a beacon for the soul
 to return to the living body." He reaches in his pocket and brings out
 the seed. You marvel at its beauty; it resembles a burnished gemstone.
 You finally tell him you understand how important his mission is, and
 he doesn't need to worry about you giving him away. His acknowledging
 smile is warm and genuine. "We'll have to stop somewhere so that I can
 rest. I'll then be able to restore Farahnaaz and send you back home.
 There's a map behind my seat; please take it, and find us a
 destination."

 You open the map on your knees to study it. You feel a lot better now
 that you've heard his story, and you're grateful that he shared it
 with you. Ardavaan pauses, as if remembering something, "I hope I
 haven't caused too much trouble for Lady Atossa... Make sure she's not
 too angry with me before you give her my greetings."
