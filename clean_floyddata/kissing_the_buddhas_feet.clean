    "I've actually done it," announces John as he enters the bathroom.

    "Done what?"  you say, trying to ignore him as you scrub the
 bathtub.

    John pulls out a sheet of crumpled paper and a lighter and sets the
 paper ablaze.  "My drop form," he says, looking at the paper.  "I'm
 not failing Psych 1 this semester.  I'm going to ace the final!"

    Surprised, you slip on your scouring pad and nearly fall face first
 into the tub.  "*What*?  You're actually going to *finish* that
 class?"

    "Definitely!"  exclaims John, his face growing hard with
 determination, a determination you've never before seen on him.  "I'm
 tired of bombing that class!  I know I can pass this time!  I don't
 care if I've got a D minus in it so far!"

    For the last two years, you and John have shared a tiny apartment
 north of campus.  It didn't take long to find out that you and John
 were, so to speak, "incompatible."  As you couldn't find another
 apartment, you've been praying for release ever since, if not by
 death, at least by John's graduating and leaving.  Because John has
 consistently failed Psych 1 for the last six years, it looked as if
 you'd be stuck with him in this hell hole for the rest of your college
 life.

    But now it looks as though you might get your reprieve.  If John
 only *passes* tomorrow's final, scheduled at eight o'clock, you'll be
 home free.  But John is easily distracted, and has lots of boisterous,
 noisy friends who like to drop in at inopportune moments.  You've got
 to make sure John gets enough quality time to study.  Tonight, the two
 of you will be pulling an all-nighter, burning the midnight oil, and

 Living Room

    This is the living room of your apartment.  Well, at least half of
 it *could* be called a living room, in the sense that a person could
 actually live in it.  You and John have long since decided that you
 would split the room into two, and each be responsible for each one's
 designated half.  Your half, which contains a tasteful paisley couch
 and mahogany table, looks bright and clean.  John's half, on the other
 hand, has piles of newspaper and beer cans, a ratty sofa which bleeds
 foam, and a study desk and chair, neither of which have seen much
 action until the last three days.  The center of the room contains
 items you have both consented to share, such as the TV set, which is
 currently on.
    The kitchen is to the west, the bedrooms and bath to the east, and
 the exit (through which you hope to see John go soon) to the north.
    John is here, sitting at his special studying desk, trying
 desperately to read his psychology textbook.

>wipe floor
 (I don't know the word "wipe".)

>examine tv
 This is that indispensable staple of modern civilization, the
 television set.  Even you admit to watching an hour or two a day.  The
 television is currently on and blaring loud noise into the room.
 There is a power cord behind the television.

 "Reaction formation, rationalization, projection, reaction formation!"
 John recites desperately.

>turn off tv
 Unfortunately, this is one of those models of televisions which can
 only be turned off by remote control.

 John squirms in his seat, trying to concentrate.

 "Kissing the Buddha's Feet" was an entry in the Second Annual
 Interactive Fiction Competition.  It placed fifth overall in a field
 of 27 entries, and later won two XYZZY awards (Best Individual NPC and
 Best NPCs).  Version 1.1 is essentially the same as the game that was
 submitted to the competition, except for a few bug fixes and cosmetic
 changes; these changes are outlined in the file bugfix.txt which
 should have come with the game package.

 This game is freeware (though not public domain), and may be freely
 played, copied, and distributed provided that you:

 1) Don't sell it for a profit.  You may charge a fee to cover the cost
 of any media you distribute the game on but no more.
 2) Don't modify the game.

 I appreciate any comments, criticism, and bug reports you send me.
 You can reach me by e-mail at leonlin@uclink.berkeley.edu.  This
 address should be valid at least until the end of 1997.

 Thanks, and enjoy the game!

 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 ----------------

 Thanks to Kevin Wilson for his advice and help.

 Thanks also to this competition's Internet Beta-Testing team,
 particularly Michael Kinyon, who helped me find bugs and other
 annoying oddities in my game I probably would have never discovered on
 my own.  And many thanks to those who wrote to me after the
 competition to inform about bugs they had discovered.

 Many thanks as well to the many people who wrote reviews and comments
 about this game, as well as my previous game, "The One That Got
 Away"--such criticism has helped me improve and grow as an author of
 interactive fiction.  Thanks also to all of the people whose votes in
 the 1996 Interactive Fiction Competition and the XYZZY Awards helped
 this game receive the recognition that it did.

 And finally, thanks to my parents, who have given me their love and
 support.  This game wouldn't have been possible without them.


>pull cord
 You try to unplug the power cord.  However, rats have chewed through
 its insulation, exposing the underlying wire.  When you touch the
 cord, you experience a painful but otherwise harmless electric shock.
 Cursing, you make a strategic retreat to the paisley couch.

 John squirms in his seat, trying to concentrate.

>look under couch
 There's nothing under your paisley couch.  As it should be.

 John tries to write some notes on a piece of paper, messes up, and, in
 a fit of frustration, crumples up the paper and throws it to the
 floor.

 You hear a violent gust of wind blow into John's bedroom, causing the
 door to slam closed.  John, startled by the noise, looks around
 confusedly.  "Um, could you go in my room and close my window,
 please?"  he asks you.

>go east
 Short Hall

    This is a short hall connecting the living room with the bedrooms
 and the bathroom.  Your bedroom is to the south, behind an open door,
 while John's room is to the north, beyond a closed door.  The bathroom
 can be reached by going east through an open door.

 You hear a knock on the front door.  You rush to the living room,
 knowing that trouble has arrived, but are too late!  The door flies
 open with a crash!

 There is an explosion of confetti around you, and a paper noisemaker
 licks impudently at your face.  When the paper clears, you see
 standing at the door John's four troublesome friends, Alice, Bob,
 Carl, and Evan!  "Hi-yah, John!"  greets Alice, their leader.  "Looks
 like we're not too late for the party!"  She doffs her conical party
 hat and strides over to John's desk.  "Say, is that a psychology book
 you're studying?  Really hitting the books now, are ya?"  She grins as
 she puts down some snacks and a radio blaring obnoxious music, and
 parks herself and Carl on the floor.  Evan immediately goes to you and
 starts speaking about trivia, and Bob wanders around drunkenly.

 It's going to be an even longer night than you imagined...

>go north
 You can't leave your apartment now!  Not when you still have to keep
 an eye on John!

 John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?"

 Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples
 it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the
 direction of the bedrooms.

 Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of hearts with Carl.

 Bob, thinking that he's walking in a straight line, toes a path more
 akin to the outline of a Picasso painting than anything else.

 Going into deep financial detail, Evan gives a discourse on the rise
 and fall of Infocom, Inc.  He also mentions how much he liked that
 little robot Floyd.

>go east
 Short Hall
    You see a piece of cellophane here.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for Monopoly.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall
 here *hic*."

 Evan follows you into the short hall.

>get cellophane
 Taken.

 Going into deep financial detail, Evan gives a discourse on the rise
 and fall of Infocom, Inc.  He also mentions how much he liked that
 little robot Floyd.

>go north
 You'll have to open John's bedroom door first.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

 Going into deep financial detail, Evan gives a discourse on the rise
 and fall of Infocom, Inc.  He also mentions how much he liked that
 little robot Floyd.

>open door
 Opened.

 You hear lots of drunken singing from somewhere else in the apartment.

>go north
 John's Bedroom

    John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using
 his stuff, though for the most part you don't take advantage of this.
 Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open
 closet door to the east.  Unlike your room, it is quite disorganized,
 to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as
 well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a
 ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken
 plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is an
 open window to the outside world.  There is a (fortunately) open door
 to the south.
    You see a wastebasket here.  The wastebasket seems to contain a
 blue wrapper.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall
 here *hic*."

 Evan follows you into John's bedroom.

>close window
 You slide the window shut, only to discover that there is a round,
 baseball-sized hole in the middle of the window which is admitting a
 large amount of wind into the room.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

 "You know," says Evan philosophically, "in Taiwan, they have this
 phrase that describes desperate students who have to make a supreme
 last-minute effort to study for exams.  They're said to be 'kissing
 the Buddha's feet.'"  He looks pleased at having known that piece of
 trivia.

>examine wrapper
 This looks like a wrapper for some sort of box.  It's pastel blue,
 with a paisley pattern tastefully silkscreened on.  A small gold seal,
 mostly intact, has the logo for "Dee's Chocolates" on it.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for mah jongg.

 Evan gives a short speech about what's wrong with the nation's foreign
 policy and how he would change things.

>get wrapper
 Taken.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

 Evan speculates about the recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

>put wrappr on window
 "Ah, 'wrappr', now that's an interesting word," says Evan.  "Let me
 tell you about its etymology..."

>put wrapper on window
 Looks like that won't fit in the hole.

 Evan talks about the impact of the longbow on the Hundred Years' War.

>examine desk
 The decrepit state of John's desk bespeaks both a ripe old age as well
 as years of misuse; its surface bears many jagged scars and scorch
 marks.  Otherwise, the desk looks surprising clean (for a possession
 of John's), mainly because most of the junk that normally occupies its
 surface has been swept onto the floor or into the closet.  There is a
 single drawer on the desk, which is closed.  On the desk you see some
 broken plastic models; besides that, you see a handheld electronic
 trivia game.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 "Send in the Clowns" along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 Going into deep financial detail, Evan gives a discourse on the rise
 and fall of Infocom, Inc.  He also mentions how much he liked that
 little robot Floyd.

>kill evan
 What do you want to attack him with?

>get game
 Taken.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for mah jongg.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall
 here *hic*."

 Evan wonders what the world would be like if it were love, not money,
 that made the world go round.

>examine game
 Small, orange, and plastic, this electronic game was given to John for
 his birthday.  John, having a limited attention span at best, quickly
 abandoned this gift before he could get through its alleged "20,000
 Questions!"  The case sports an LCD screen and a small speaker.  There
 are also four buttons, colored red, yellow, green, and blue, lined up
 vertically to the left of the screen, next to where the possible
 answers to the game's questions will be displayed.  The game is
 currently off.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

 "I believe," says Evan, "that a philosopher once said, 'You can only
 win so many battles before you lose the war.'"

>give game to evan
 Evan looks excitedly at the game you're giving him.  "Why-y-y, that's
 a '20,000 Questions' trivia game!  It's the fourth edition!  A rarity!
 I've always wanted to play that!"  He fumbles clumsily at the game,
 which he turns on and starts playing eagerly.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for chess.

 A violent gust of wind flies in through the hole in the window,
 causing the bedroom door to slam closed with a loud "BANG!"

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>go east
 John's Closet

    This is John's closet.  There are no skeletons hiding here, but
 considering the amount of dust and dirty clothes around, you would
 hardly be surprised if one of the undead were lurking around in this
 dimly lit space.  The one exit is a door to the west, which is open.
    You see a catcher's mitt here.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

 Evan follows you into John's closet, still playing the game.

>get mitt
 Taken.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 some heavy metal song along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>go west
 John's Bedroom
    You see a wastebasket here.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for canasta.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

 Evan follows you into John's bedroom, still playing the game.

>put mitt in hole
 Looks like that won't fit in the hole.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>get sheet
 Even if it *were* your job to pick up after John, you wouldn't want to
 touch these sheets.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

>look
 John's Bedroom

    John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using
 his stuff, though for the most part you don't take advantage of this.
 Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open
 closet door to the east.  Unlike your room, it is quite disorganized,
 to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as
 well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a
 ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken
 plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is a
 closed window to the outside world.  There is a closed door to the
 south.
    You see a wastebasket here.
    Evan is here, playing an electronic trivia game.  Loud electronic
 beeps and whistles fly out of the game's speakers.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for checkers.

>examine model
 These used to be models of military equipment that John liked to make
 (however ineptly).  However, this once proud army has been reduced to
 piles of broken, shattered pieces by some hard-hitting,
 fast-travelling force.  You notice a thick piece of duct tape hanging
 limply on the remains of one model.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>get tape
 Taken.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from

 There's no good surface on the blue wrapper.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from

 maniacally.

>inventory
 You have a piece of cellophane, a blue wrapper, a catcher's mitt, and
 a piece of duct tape.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>examine dresser
 The dresser looks as if it might fall apart at any moment.  You eye it
 cautiously.  The drawers are closed.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 "Love Shack" along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>open it
 Opened.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from

 You see Bob stagger in from the door to the south.

>go south

 You see Bob stagger in from the door to the north.

 Evan follows you into the short hall, still playing the game.

>verbose
 Okay, now in VERBOSE mode.
 Short Hall

    This is a short hall connecting the living room with the bedrooms
 and the bathroom.  Your bedroom is to the south, behind an open door,
 while John's room is to the north, beyond an open door.  The bathroom
 can be reached by going east through an open door.
    You see Bob, staggering around, like the slightest hint of alcohol
 in the air will send him crashing to the ground here.
    Evan is here, playing an electronic trivia game.  Loud electronic
 beeps and whistles fly out of the game's speakers.

>go east
 Bathroom

    The bathroom, fortunately, is one of the rooms you've agreed to
 maintain, and as a result it isn't too filthy.  Against the north wall
 is a gleaming sink and a mirror mounted above it; next to the mirror
 is a medicine cabinet.  On the south wall is a towel rack.  A toilet
 and shower, both scrubbed to exquisite perfection with lye-based
 cleansers, complete this traditional bathroom.  The only exit to this
 bathroom is through a door to the west, which is open.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 "American Pie" along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

 Evan follows you into the bathroom, still playing the game.

>get towel
 Taken.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall
 here *hic*."

>examine cabinet
 Which cabinet do you mean, the bathroom sink cabinet, or the medicine
 cabinet?

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

 Opening the cabinet reveals the pipes which comprise the bathroom sink
 plumbing.  Besides that, you see in the cabinet nothing at all.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 the theme from "Love Story" along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall

    You see Bob, staggering around, like the slightest hint of alcohol
 in the air will send him crashing to the ground here.

 Bob tries to go through a wall.  His head rebounds violently off the
 hard plaster surface.  "Thang you sir, may I hab uhnudder?"  he says
 humbly.

 Evan follows you into the short hall, still playing the game.

 John's Bedroom

    John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using

 and stay in place.  You need something more reliable.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for checkers.

 You hear lots of drunken singing from somewhere else in the apartment.

    You see a crumpled paper and a radio here.
    John is here, sitting at his special studying desk, trying
 desperately to read his psychology textbook.
    Alice is here, looking a bit bored.
    Carl is here, entertaining himself in his usual banal manner.

 John hits his forehead with his hands, muttering, "Think!  Think!"  It
 doesn't seem to be working.

 "So, John," says Alice, "how're you doing hitting those books?  Real
 swell?"  John mumbles something uncomfortably and tries to continue
 studying.

 Evan follows you into the living room, still playing the game.

>put tape on towel
 There's no good surface on the pink towel.

 John hits his forehead with his hands, muttering, "Think!  Think!"  It
 doesn't seem to be working.

 Alice reminisces about a really good tuna fish sandwich she once had.

 You hear lots of drunken singing from somewhere else in the apartment.

>examine crumpled paper
 This is a piece of crumpled paper, on which is written a few words on
 Freudian psychology, most of it incoherent (not that it would make
 much difference, anyway).

 John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?"

 Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of bridge with Carl.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall
 here *hic*."

 doesn't seem to be working.

 Alice looks outside wistfully.  "You know, Carl and I would be outta
 here now...but we don't have enough money for a proper dinner--not
 these sad snacks that we have--for both of us.  Oh, I have enough for
 just me, but..."  She looks at Carl, who has a mournful look on his
 face.  "...but, I can't be that cruel, can I?"

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>put tape on crumpled
 There's no good surface on the crumpled paper.

 John tries to write some notes on a piece of paper, messes up, and, in
 a fit of frustration, crumples up the paper and throws it to the
 floor.

 "C'mon, John," urges Alice, "take a break, have some fun with us!  You
 can always take more tests next semester!"

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>examine tape
 This is a thick piece of duct tape.  In fact, with further
 examination, you realize that it is a piece of "soundproofing" duct
 tape you used to construct your closet door.  Now you know where that
 roll went...

 John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?"

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

>quiz john
 You ask John a question about rationalization.  "Wait, I know that!  I
 know that!"  exclaims John.  He grits his teeth and closes his eyes in
 concentration.  "No, wait, I forgot!  I forgot!"

 John can't help but stare at the TV for a few seconds, mesmerized by
 the colorful patterns on the screen.

 Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of poker with Carl.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

>search sofa
 That's a job for one braver than you.

 John squirms in his seat, trying to concentrate.

 doesn't seem to be working.

 Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples
 it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the
 direction of the kitchen.  It lands squarely in the kitchen sink.

 Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of gin rummy with
 Carl.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>examine table
 Which table do you mean, the mahogany table, or John's desk?

>examine mahogany
 This table, with its meticulously polished and dustless surface, was
 your 20th birthday present.  Catching a glimpse of your own reflection
 against the fine wood grain pattern, you remember why this table has
 always had a special place in your heart.  Currently you see on the
 table a porcelain vase.

 John can't help but stare at the TV for a few seconds, mesmerized by
 the colorful patterns on the screen.

 You hear some banging on the walls.

>look in vase
 There's nothing in the vase.

 Distracted by all of the noise, John momentarily loses his
 concentration and starts muttering something barely comprehensible
 about Bob riding his skateboard into the kitchen sink.

 "C'mon, John," urges Alice, "take a break, have some fun with us!  You
 can always take more tests next semester!"

 You hear some banging on the walls.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>examine desk
 This is John's "studying" desk, which he bought a few days ago.  (He
 would have used the desk in his room, but he claimed, "I need a fresh
 start in studying."  Actually, he found his desk was glued to the
 floor and thought it would be faster to buy a new one.)  On the table
 you see John's psychology book; other than that you see nothing at
 all.

 John squirms in his seat, trying to concentrate.

 Alice looks outside wistfully.  "You know, Carl and I would be outta
 here now...but we don't have enough money for a proper dinner--not
 these sad snacks that we have--for both of us.  Oh, I have enough for
 just me, but..."  She looks at Carl, who has a mournful look on his
 face.  "...but, I can't be that cruel, can I?"

>examine newspapers
 This pile of junk is the result of John's long stay in this apartment.
 There are still newspapers announcing the fall of the Berlin Wall in
 there, and if you strain hard enough, you think you see a can of New
 Coke.  Yuk.  Who knows what else might be hiding in there?

 John hits his forehead with his hands, muttering, "Think!  Think!"  It
 doesn't seem to be working.

 "This feels like the perfect night for fish and chips," says Alice.

>search them
 pile of newspaper and cans:  The thought of sticking your bare hands
 into that filth disgusts you.

 John squirms in his seat, trying to concentrate.

 Alice reminisces about a really good tuna fish sandwich she once had.

 You hear lots of drunken singing from somewhere else in the apartment.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>go west
 Kitchen

    When you moved into this apartment, the kitchen was a horrendous
 mess.  Because you've agreed to let John maintain the kitchen while
 you maintain the bathroom, it still is; the stove is encrusted with
 the pathetic results of previous meals, the refrigerator is in sore
 need of a wipedown, and the kitchen sink as usual is filled with
 mostly useless items (such as, for example, John's skateboard).  A
 kitchen table sits in the center of the room.  The living room is to
 the east.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for canasta.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall
 here *hic*."

 Evan follows you into the kitchen, still playing the game.

>examine sink
 This, as you probably surmised, is the kitchen sink.  At the moment it
 is fairly filthy, thanks to John's recent diligent efforts at *not*
 scrubbing it.  Under the sink is a cabinet in which the kitchen
 plumbing can be accessed.  In the kitchen sink there are broken
 dishes; other than that, you see a skateboard and a piece of
 cellophane.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

>examine table
 Scars and stains mar the appearance of this otherwise fine kitchen
 table.  The most recent addition to the marks on the table is a set of
 long, parallel lines, not unlike skid marks, which point in the
 general direction of the kitchen sink.  Other than these marks, you
 see on the table a pastel blue box.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 "American Pie" along with the radio, and doing it badly.

>examine box
 The box of chocolates was intended to be a birthday present from your
 mother.  Unfortunately, John, mistaking anything with a molecular
 structure to be his, has already opened the box and ravaged its
 contents:  there is only a bare fraction of the hundred chocolates
 that used to be inside.  There is a torn label on the side of box.  In
 the box you see a square dark chocolate, a square light chocolate, a
 round dark chocolate, a round light chocolate, a shell-shaped dark
 chocolate, a shell-shaped light chocolate, a triangular dark
 chocolate, a triangular light chocolate, a hexagonal dark chocolate, a
 hexagonal light chocolate, and a torn card.

>examine card
 The torn card is missing the brand name of the chocolates, but the
 ingredients list is still readable.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 "Y.M.C.A." along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 You hear lots of drunken singing from somewhere else in the apartment.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>read card
 The card emphasizes the variety of fillings used to make these
 chocolates.  In the ingredients list, you note that the chocolates are
 filled with caramel, coconut, marzipan, peanuts, almonds, pecans,
 cherry liqueur, marshmallow, fudge, and mint.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

>get box
 Taken.

 Bob staggers into the kitchen, looking incredibly dazed.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>get all from sink
 skateboard:  Taken.
 piece of cellophane:  Taken.

 Bob staggers off to the east.

>open fridge
 Opening the refrigerator reveals a beer can and some raw cookie dough.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

>get beer can
 Taken.

>get cookie dough
 You've already got your hands full.

 You hear a violent gust of wind from the direction of John's bedroom,
 and then a loud "BANG!"

 Bob staggers into the kitchen, looking incredibly dazed.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>examine it
 This is a baseball-sized lump of raw cookie dough, a favorite food of
 John's.  It's grown a little stale and moldy since it last saw the
 light of day but still retains a bit of elasticity and stickiness.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 some country song along with the radio, and doing it badly.

>drop box
 Dropped.

 Bob, thinking that he's walking in a straight line, toes a path more
 akin to the outline of a Picasso painting than anything else.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>get dough
 Taken.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for poker.

 In a loud voice, Bob brags about crushing a bunch of plastic models on
 John's table.

>go east
 Living Room

    This is the living room of your apartment.  Well, at least half of
 it *could* be called a living room, in the sense that a person could
 actually live in it.  You and John have long since decided that you
 would split the room into two, and each be responsible for each one's
 designated half.  Your half, which contains a tasteful paisley couch
 and mahogany table, looks bright and clean.  John's half, on the other
 hand, has piles of newspaper and beer cans, a ratty sofa which bleeds
 foam, and a study desk and chair, neither of which have seen much
 action until the last three days.  The center of the room contains
 items you have both consented to share, such as the TV set, which is
 currently on.
    The kitchen is to the west, the bedrooms and bath to the east, and
 the exit (through which you hope to see John go soon) to the north.
    You see a radio and a crumpled paper here.
    John is here, sitting at his special studying desk, trying
 desperately to read his psychology textbook.
    Alice is here, looking a bit bored.
    Carl is here, entertaining himself in his usual banal manner.

 "I think I remember hearing somewhere that fish is good for you," says
 Alice.

 Bob staggers into the living room, looking incredibly dazed.

 Evan follows you into the living room, still playing the game.

>go east
 Short Hall

    This is a short hall connecting the living room with the bedrooms
 and the bathroom.  Your bedroom is to the south, behind an open door,
 while John's room is to the north, beyond an open door.  The bathroom
 can be reached by going east through an open door.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 some country song along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 Evan follows you into the short hall, still playing the game.

>go north
 John's Bedroom

    John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using
 his stuff, though for the most part you don't take advantage of this.
 Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open
 closet door to the east.  Unlike your room, it is quite disorganized,
 to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as
 well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a
 ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken
 plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is a
 closed window to the outside world.  There is a (fortunately) open
 door to the south.
    You see a wastebasket here.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

 Evan follows you into John's bedroom, still playing the game.

>put dough in hole
 You stick the cookie dough in the hole.  It fits quite nicely.
 Working the edges with your hands, you quickly form an efficient seal
 which should keep the wind out.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

    You see Bob, staggering around, like the slightest hint of alcohol
 in the air will send him crashing to the ground here.

 In a loud voice, Bob brags about riding John's skateboard into the
 kitchen sink.

 Evan follows you into the short hall, still playing the game.

    Alice is here, looking a bit bored.
    Carl is here, entertaining himself in his usual banal manner.

 John tries to write some notes on a piece of paper, messes up, and, in
 a fit of frustration, crumples up the paper and throws it to the
 floor.

 Alice takes out a bag of carob-covered malt balls, empties the
 contents into her hands, and chucks the empty bag off John's desk,
 onto the floor.

 Alice and Carl, needing to stretch their legs, get up and dance the
 tango for a little while.

 Evan follows you into the living room, still playing the game.

>score
 The only score you're worried about is the one John will have on his
 test in the morning.

>wear mitt
 Okay, you're now wearing the catcher's mitt.

 John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?"

 "This feels like the perfect night for fish and chips," says Alice.

 Bob staggers into the living room, looking incredibly dazed.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins
 maniacally.

>search newspapers
 With the catcher's mitt on your hand, you confidently wade through the
 junk pile without fear of contamination.  Your efforts are rewarded,
 as you unearth the lost television remote control!

 John hits his forehead with his hands, muttering, "Think!  Think!"  It
 doesn't seem to be working.

 Alice and Carl, needing to stretch their legs, get up and dance the
 Charleston for a little while.

 Bob, thinking that he's walking in a straight line, toes a path more
 akin to the outline of a Picasso painting than anything else.

>take control
 You already have the remote control!

 John tries to write some notes on a piece of paper, messes up, and, in
 a fit of frustration, crumples up the paper and throws it to the
 floor.

 Alice takes out a bag of potato chips, empties the contents into her
 hands, and chucks the empty bag into the hallway.

 Alice and Carl, needing to stretch their legs, get up and dance the
 rumba for a little while.

 Bob staggers off to the west.

 You hear a loud "Pin pon!"  come from the game.  Evan grins

 Okay, you're no longer wearing the catcher's mitt.

 "Rationalization, displacement, displacement, displacement!"  John
 recites desperately.

 "This feels like the perfect night for fish and chips," says Alice.

 You hear lots of drunken singing from somewhere else in the apartment.

>turn off tv
 With a profound sigh of relief, you press the power button and end the
 television's reign of terror upon your brain.

 Alice reminisces about a really good tuna fish sandwich she once had.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by a plaintive, "Who pud this wall

    Carl is here, entertaining himself in his usual banal manner.

 John hits his forehead with his hands, muttering, "Think!  Think!"  It
 doesn't seem to be working.

 Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples
 it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the
 direction of the kitchen.  The cellophane bounces off the
 refrigerator, and skims the edge of the kitchen sink.  Just as it
 looks as if it would go in, it falls to the floor.

 Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of whist with Carl.

 Bob, thinking that he's walking in a straight line, toes a path more
 akin to the outline of a Picasso painting than anything else.

 Evan follows you into the living room, still playing the game.

>give beer to bob
 Bob eagerly snatches the can from your hands.  The moment he raises it
 to his lips he gags violently.  "Whadzz thizz?"  he moans.  "Milk!  No
 good!"  He tosses the can back to you.

 Alice takes out a bag of potato chips, empties the contents into her
 hands, and chucks the empty bag into the hallway.

 Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of baccarat with
 Carl.

 In a loud voice, Bob brags about banging his head against the wall
 fifty-seven times without going unconscious.

 This is an open beer can, probably being saved by John for a rainy (or
 dry) day.  It's almost full.

 "Repression, projection, sublimation, projection!"  John recites
 desperately.

 Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples
 it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the

 John grits his teeth and grinds a pencil down to a stub.

 Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples
 it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the

 and shower, both scrubbed to exquisite perfection with lye-based

 Your Bedroom

    This is your bedroom, for which you can be proud.  Mostly bare,
 since many of your possessions are out for dry cleaning, the room
 looks neater than ever.  Your bed, sitting in one corner, is
 immaculately made, and your desk, placed against the northern wall,
 has a clear surface which reveals its mirror-shine polish.  A fine
 mahogany dresser sits against the south wall, and a mirror sits atop

 east.
    You see a swivel chair here.

 Evan follows you into your bedroom, still playing the game.

>examine dresser
 This is a dresser made of fine mahogany wood.  The surface is
 dust-free and so shiny you could comb your hair by your reflection in
 the wood.  The drawers are closed.

 You see Bob stagger in from the door to the east.

>give chocolate to bob
 Which chocolate do you mean, the blue wrapper, the pastel blue box,
 the square dark chocolate, the square light chocolate, the round dark
 chocolate, the round light chocolate, the shell-shaped dark chocolate,
 the shell-shaped light chocolate, the triangular dark chocolate, the
 triangular light chocolate, the hexagonal dark chocolate, or the
 hexagonal light chocolate?

>square
 Let's try it again:  Which chocolate do you mean, the square dark
 chocolate, or the square light chocolate?

>dark
 Bob snarfs down the chocolate, and then gags violently.  "Marzipan!"
 he exclaims.  "I hade marzipan!"  He teeters unsteadily in his drunken
 rage.  "If...if you gib me another chocolid filled with something I
 don' like, I'll...I...  I...won't take any more chocolidzz from you!"

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for checkers.

>give square to bob
 Bob eats the chocolate, but is livid when he finds out it's filled
 with mint.  He looks pretty angry now, and rambles about not liking
 "mint" and says he'll never accept chocolate from you again, and
 probably no one else in the world as well, as his trust was betrayed,
 and so forth.

 Bob staggers through the door to the east.

>undo

 Your Bedroom

    This is your bedroom, for which you can be proud.  Mostly bare,
 since many of your possessions are out for dry cleaning, the room
 looks neater than ever.  Your bed, sitting in one corner, is
 immaculately made, and your desk, placed against the northern wall,
 has a clear surface which reveals its mirror-shine polish.  A fine
 mahogany dresser sits against the south wall, and a mirror sits atop
 it.  There is an open door to the north and an open closet door to the
 east.
    You see a swivel chair and Bob, staggering around, like the
 slightest hint of alcohol in the air will send him crashing to the
 ground here.
    Evan is here, playing an electronic trivia game.

 Bob tries to go through a wall.  His head rebounds violently off the
 hard plaster surface.  "Thangs," he says dazedly, "I needed datd."

 Evan is too involved in beating the trivia game to notice your offer,
 which probably wouldn't have seemed too attractive to him anyhow.

 In a loud voice, Bob brags about drinking his weight in beer.

 Your Closet

>read card
    Dimly illuminated, this closet provides you with an impenetrable
 defense against outside noise.  The door, which is to the west and
 open, is steel-reinforced and soundproof, preventing even the loudest
 party sounds from getting through.  Though the closet is small, it is
 roomy enough for you and several of your favorite textbooks, and
 you've studied for many an exam here.
    You see a toolbox here.

 You see Bob stagger in from the door to the west.

 Evan follows you into your closet, still playing the game.

 The card emphasizes the variety of fillings used to make these
 chocolates.  In the ingredients list, you note that the chocolates are
 filled with caramel, coconut, marzipan, peanuts, almonds, pecans,
 cherry liqueur, marshmallow, fudge, and mint.

 Bob tries to go through a wall.  His head rebounds violently off the
 hard plaster surface.  "Thang you sir, may I hab uhnudder?"  he says
 humbly.

>examine toolbox
 This toolbox holds most of your favorite tools.  Unfortunately many of
 them have been "borrowed" by John.  In the toolbox you see a wrench.

 Bob tries to think of some drinking songs he knows and sing them.  He
 has no sense of pitch, but that unfortunately doesn't keep him from
 trying.

>get wrench

 Bob staggers through the door to the west.

>examine desk
 This is your mahogany desk, a gift to you on your fifteenth birthday.
 You've spent many a long hour studying at this desk, and many more
 polishing it.  Even now, as you look at it, you get the urge to wipe
 off a few molecules of dust from its surface with your sleeve, but you
 resist, as you would get your shirt dirty.  There is a drawer on the
 front of the desk which is closed.

 Bob staggers through the door to the east.

>read about dark square
 (I don't recognize that sentence.)

>open drawer
 Opened.

 You hear some banging on the walls.

>look in it
 The desk drawer is open.  There's nothing in the desk drawer.

 You hear a sharp BUMP!  followed by some energetic banging on the
 walls.

 You see the interior of the closet through the open door, but you'll
 have to go inside to get a better look at what's there.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

 Evan blithely continues playing even as you ask him a question.
 Perhaps if you took that game from him, he'd pay attention...

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for Monopoly.

 Bob stares at the mirror and, with all the machismo possible from a
 drunken sot, brags about some sports exploit of his.  Unfortunately it
 involves terms you are unfamiliar with, and that you suspect are
 totally made up.

>get game
 You yank the game out of Evan's hands.  In the process Evan's fingers
 brush against the game's on/off switch, turning the game off.  Evan
 looks extremely surprised and perturbed.

 Going into deep financial detail, Evan gives a discourse on the rise
 and fall of Infocom, Inc.  He also mentions how much he liked that
 little robot Floyd.

 Bob staggers through the door to the north.

>ask evan about floyd
 "Ah, 'floyd', now that's an interesting word," says Evan.  "Let me
 tell you about its etymology..."

>ask evan about chocolate
 "Hmmm," says Evan.  "I'm well versed in the ways of chocolate and
 their contents--I've never been stuck with a coconut-filled chocolate
 myself.  However, I can't tell you much unless I know what brand this
 chocolate is."

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from

 Evan wonders what the world would be like if Fermat had a lot more

 The torn card is missing the brand name of the chocolates, but the
 ingredients list is still readable.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for canasta.

 Evan talks about Napoleon's use of artillery at Waterloo.

 The sound of a tremendous belch rocks the apartment.

>examine box
 The box of chocolates was intended to be a birthday present from your
 mother.  Unfortunately, John, mistaking anything with a molecular
 structure to be his, has already opened the box and ravaged its
 contents:  there is only a bare fraction of the hundred chocolates
 that used to be inside.  There is a torn label on the side of box.  In
 the box you see a square dark chocolate, a square light chocolate, a
 round dark chocolate, a round light chocolate, a shell-shaped dark
 chocolate, a shell-shaped light chocolate, a triangular dark
 chocolate, a triangular light chocolate, a hexagonal dark chocolate, a
 hexagonal light chocolate, and a torn card.

 Evan gives an impromptu talk about Brazil in the (hypothetical)

 You hear lots of drunken singing from somewhere else in the apartment.

 with a paisley pattern tastefully silkscreened on.  A small gold seal,
 mostly intact, has the logo for "Dee's Chocolates" on it.

 Evan speculates about the recipe for Greek fire.

>show wrapper to evan
 "Ah, how interesting," says Evan.  "The wrapper for a box of Dee's
 chocolates.  Serial number 4888602, had a very specific combination of
 shapes and fillings.  Hmmm...let's see if I remember...  hexagonal
 dark chocolates were filled with peanuts, hexagonal light chocolates
 were filled with mint, triangular light chocolates were filled with
 pecans, triangular dark chocolates were filled with cherry liqueur,
 shell-shaped light chocolates were filled with marshmallow,
 shell-shaped dark chocolates were filled with caramel, round light
 chocolates were filled with fudge, round dark chocolates were filled
 with coconut, square light chocolates were filled with almonds, and

 In a loud voice, Bob brags about banging his head against the wall
 fifty-seven times without going unconscious.

>give triangular dark chocolate to bob
 Bob eats the chocolate.  "Mmmm!"  he exclaims ecstatically.  "Cherry!
 My favorite..."  Suddenly, Bob shakes his head once.  Then twice.  His
 eyes cross, his body stiffens, then relaxes.  Finally, with only the
 hint of a belch on his lips, Bob gently settles his considerable bulk
 onto the floor.

 "I believe," says Evan, "that a philosopher once said, 'Money isn't

 Bob lets out a loud snore which sounds truly hideous.

 John's Bedroom

    John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using
 his stuff, though for the most part you don't take advantage of this.
 Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open
 closet door to the east.  Unlike your room, it is quite disorganized,
 to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as
 well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a
 ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken
 plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is a
 closed window to the outside world.  There is a (fortunately) open
 door to the south.
    You see a wastebasket here.  The window seems to contain some raw
 cookie dough.

 John's Closet

    This is John's closet.  There are no skeletons hiding here, but
 considering the amount of dust and dirty clothes around, you would
 hardly be surprised if one of the undead were lurking around in this
 dimly lit space.  The one exit is a door to the west, which is open.

 Evan follows you into John's closet.

 chocolate, a round dark chocolate, a round light chocolate, a
 shell-shaped dark chocolate, a shell-shaped light chocolate, a
 triangular light chocolate, a hexagonal dark chocolate, a hexagonal
 light chocolate, and a torn card.  The speaker seems to contain a

 Living Room

    This is the living room of your apartment.  Well, at least half of
 it *could* be called a living room, in the sense that a person could
 actually live in it.  You and John have long since decided that you
 would split the room into two, and each be responsible for each one's
 designated half.  Your half, which contains a tasteful paisley couch
 and mahogany table, looks bright and clean.  John's half, on the other
 hand, has piles of newspaper and beer cans, a ratty sofa which bleeds
 foam, and a study desk and chair, neither of which have seen much
 action until the last three days.  The center of the room contains
 items you have both consented to share, such as the TV set, which is
 currently off.
    The kitchen is to the west, the bedrooms and bath to the east, and
 the exit (through which you hope to see John go soon) to the north.
    You see a radio, three crumpled papers, a snack food bag, and a
 piece of cellophane here.
    John is here, sitting at his special studying desk, trying
 desperately to read his psychology textbook.
    Alice is here, looking a bit bored.
    Carl is here, entertaining himself in his usual banal manner.

 Distracted by all of the noise, John momentarily loses his
 concentration and starts muttering something about losing an
 electronic game on his desk.

 Evan follows you into the living room.

>examine game
 Small, orange, and plastic, this electronic game was given to John for
 his birthday.  John, having a limited attention span at best, quickly
 abandoned this gift before he could get through its alleged "20,000
 Questions!"  The case sports an LCD screen and a small speaker.  There
 are also four buttons, colored red, yellow, green, and blue, lined up
 vertically to the left of the screen, next to where the possible
 answers to the game's questions will be displayed.  The game is
 currently off.

 John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?"

 "So, John," says Alice, "how're you doing hitting those books?  Real
 swell?"  John mumbles something uncomfortably and tries to continue
 studying.

 Evan wonders what the world would be like if it were love, not money,
 that made the world go round.

>put tape on speaker
 You place the duct tape on the speaker.

 "Rationalization, sublimation, displacement, rationalization!"  John
 recites desperately.

 Carl takes out a candy bar, strips the cellophane off of it, crumples
 it into a neat, compact ball, and tosses it absent-mindedly in the
 direction of the kitchen.  The cellophane bounces off the
 refrigerator, and skims the edge of the kitchen sink.  Just as it
 looks as if it would go in, it falls to the floor.

 Alice and Carl, needing to stretch their legs, get up and dance the
 minuet for a little while.

 "I've always wondered what life would be like if it were exactly like
 a text adventure game," says Evan.  "I'm not sure I'd like it.  For
 example, everything you did would take exactly one minute to do no
 matter what it was."

>give game to evan
 "Geez, about time you finished with that," says Evan irritably as he
 takes the game from you again.

 John wails to you, "Could you help quiz me?  Please?"

>quiz john
 You ask John a question about repression.  "Wait, I know that!  I know
 that!"  exclaims John.  He grits his teeth and closes his eyes in
 concentration.  "No, wait, I forgot!  I forgot!"

 John tries to write some notes on a piece of paper, messes up, and, in
 a fit of frustration, crumples up the paper and throws it to the
 floor.

 Alice reminisces about a really good tuna fish sandwich she once had.

>go east
 Short Hall

    This is a short hall connecting the living room with the bedrooms
 and the bathroom.  Your bedroom is to the south, behind an open door,
 while John's room is to the north, beyond an open door.  The bathroom
 can be reached by going east through an open door.
    You see two snack food bags here.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for Monopoly.

 Evan follows you into the short hall, still playing the game.

>go south
 Your Bedroom

    This is your bedroom, for which you can be proud.  Mostly bare,
 since many of your possessions are out for dry cleaning, the room
 looks neater than ever.  Your bed, sitting in one corner, is
 immaculately made, and your desk, placed against the northern wall,
 has a clear surface which reveals its mirror-shine polish.  A fine
 mahogany dresser sits against the south wall, and a mirror sits atop
 it.  There is an open door to the north and a closed closet door to
 the east.

 Evan follows you into your bedroom, still playing the game.

>examine desk
 This is your mahogany desk, a gift to you on your fifteenth birthday.
 You've spent many a long hour studying at this desk, and many more
 polishing it.  Even now, as you look at it, you get the urge to wipe
 off a few molecules of dust from its surface with your sleeve, but you
 resist, as you would get your shirt dirty.  There is a drawer on the
 front of the desk which is open.

>look in drawer
 The desk drawer is open.  There's nothing in the desk drawer.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

>examine dresser
 This is a dresser made of fine mahogany wood.  The surface is
 dust-free and so shiny you could comb your hair by your reflection in
 the wood.  The drawers are closed.

>open dresser
 Opened.

 From the direction of the living room, you hear Alice trying to sing
 "Y.M.C.A." along with the radio, and doing it badly.

>look in it
 There's nothing in the mahogany dresser.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for Monopoly.

>examine mirror
 You polish this mirror twice a day.  If it doesn't look good, you
 don't look good.

>examine bed
 This is your bed, which you are very proud of.  You spend at least
 half an hour every day making it, smoothing out the folds, ensuring
 that the sheets are perfectly balanced and symmetrical on both sides.
 On the bed you see nothing at all.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

>look under bed
 There's nothing under your bed, not even those slavering, gnawing,
 hungry monsters you used to hear at night...You recoil from the bed,
 sweating profusely.

>go north
 Short Hall

    This is a short hall connecting the living room with the bedrooms
 and the bathroom.  Your bedroom is to the south, behind an open door,
 while John's room is to the north, beyond an open door.  The bathroom
 can be reached by going east through an open door.
    You see two snack food bags here.

 Evan follows you into the short hall, still playing the game.

>go north
 John's Bedroom

    John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using
 his stuff, though for the most part you don't take advantage of this.
 Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open
 closet door to the east.  Unlike your room, it is quite disorganized,
 to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as
 well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a
 ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken
 plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is a
 closed window to the outside world.  There is a (fortunately) open
 door to the south.
    You see a wastebasket here.  The window seems to contain some raw
 cookie dough.

 Evan follows you into John's bedroom, still playing the game.

>look under bed
 You take a quick peek under John's bed.  Other than dust and other
 assorted debris, you don't see anything, particularly anything he
 "borrowed" from you in recent months.  Drat.

>examine debris
 It's hard to get more descriptive of this stuff than the single word,
 'debris.'

>search debris
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine clothes
 Various articles of clothing and underwear are scattered around the
 room.  It's hard to move around without stepping on one.

>examine desk
 The decrepit state of John's desk bespeaks both a ripe old age as well
 as years of misuse; its surface bears many jagged scars and scorch
 marks.  Otherwise, the desk looks surprising clean (for a possession
 of John's), mainly because most of the junk that normally occupies its
 surface has been swept onto the floor or into the closet.  There is a
 single drawer on the desk, which is closed.  On the desk you see some
 broken plastic models; besides that, you see nothing at all.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for Parchesi.

>search clothes
 You find nothing of interest.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for go.

>open drawer
 Opening the desk drawer reveals a coupon book.

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for poker.

>get it
 You can't have the desk drawer.

>get coupon
 Which coupon do you mean, the Captain Barnacle's Seafood House coupon,
 the Nekohanten coupon, or the Chez Merde coupon?

>seafood
 You've already got your hands full.

>drop box
 Dropped.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

>get seafood
 Taken.

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

>examine it
 This coupon entitles the bearer to two All-You-Can-Eat Crustacean
 Platters for the price of one.  The coupon enthusiastically describes
 this dish as "More Shrimp Than You DESERVE!"

 The sound of crumpling cellophane, grating your ears, comes in from
 the direction of the living room.

>examine merde
 By presenting this coupon to the matre'd at any Chez Merde, you can
 get two Super Escargot, Fantastic Frog Legs (with French fries, no
 less), or Spectacular Souffle plates for the price of one.  (10% off
 more if you don't try to order using your high-school French.)

>examine nekohanten
 This coupon, for the local Chinese restaurant Nekohanten, reduces the
 prices on any dish in the "B" category to 55 cents each.  The coupon
 also promises "Half the MSG of our nearest competitor!"

 You hear a loud and raucous argument in the living room about the
 rules for mah jongg.

>go south
 Short Hall

    This is a short hall connecting the living room with the bedrooms
 and the bathroom.  Your bedroom is to the south, behind an open door,

 "American Pie" along with the radio, and doing it badly.

 Evan follows you into the short hall, still playing the game.

>go west
 Living Room

    This is the living room of your apartment.  Well, at least half of
 it *could* be called a living room, in the sense that a person could
 actually live in it.  You and John have long since decided that you
 would split the room into two, and each be responsible for each one's
 designated half.  Your half, which contains a tasteful paisley couch
 and mahogany table, looks bright and clean.  John's half, on the other
 hand, has piles of newspaper and beer cans, a ratty sofa which bleeds
 foam, and a study desk and chair, neither of which have seen much
 action until the last three days.  The center of the room contains
 items you have both consented to share, such as the TV set, which is
 currently off.
    The kitchen is to the west, the bedrooms and bath to the east, and
 the exit (through which you hope to see John go soon) to the north.
    You see a radio, four crumpled papers, a snack food bag, and a
 piece of cellophane here.
    John is here, sitting at his special studying desk, trying
 desperately to read his psychology textbook.
    Alice is here, looking a bit bored.
    Carl is here, entertaining himself in his usual banal manner.

 John hits his forehead with his hands, muttering, "Think!  Think!"  It
 doesn't seem to be working.

 "C'mon, John," urges Alice, "take a break, have some fun with us!  You
 can always take more tests next semester!"

 Evan follows you into the living room, still playing the game.

>give seafood to alice
 "Why thanks," says Alice, grinning.  "I was just thinking of dinner at
 this place.  Looks like I can afford it now."  She gets up, and Carl
 follows suit.  You heart leaps at the thought that she's going to be
 clearing out of here...

 "Ah, but it's *so* cold outside tonight," says Alice, seating herself
 on the floor again.  "Positively freezing.  And look at how I'm
 dressed!"  You don't have much of an opinion of Alice's tastes in
 clothes, but admittedly, she does look a bit chilly.  "We can't well
 go out and get pneumonia, can we?  You wouldn't want that on your
 conscience, would you...?"

 Distracted by all of the noise, John momentarily loses his
 concentration and starts muttering something about losing an
 electronic game on his desk.

 Alice takes out a bag of potato chips, empties the contents into her
 hands, and chucks the empty bag into the hallway.

 Alice breaks out a pack of cards and plays a hand of blackjack with
 Carl.

>give towel to alice
 "Very funny," smiles Alice as she takes the towel.  "It *is* something
 warm for the night, though."  She looks thoughtful, as if searching
 for one last excuse to keep herself in your apartment.  "You *know*,
 we're all ready to leave, but we don't have any way of getting to
 dinner or the concert!  Now if only you could find any way for us to
 depart this place..."  She grins again.

 John squirms in his seat, trying to concentrate.

>examine alice
 Alice, one of John's friends, is a relentless partygoer.  She likes
 listening to loud, ear-splitting music, playing card and dice games,
 watching television shows based on video games, drinking stirred and
 not shaken martinis, and annoying people like you.  You know all this
 because of the many times she's visited your apartment along with
 twenty or thirty of her "friends."  Luckily for you her entourage
 seems a bit thin tonight.

 "Reaction formation, projection, rationalization, sublimation!"  John
 recites desperately.

 Alice looks despondent.  "I really appreciate the coupon and the
 towel, but it looks like we're just going to be stuck here all night,
 since we don't have any way of getting to the Polonium.  I guess we're
 going to be your guests all night, eh?"  She smiles wickedly.

>give skateboard to alice
 Alice starts laughing as she takes the skateboard from your hands.
 "Got me again, huh?  I guess this technically *is* transportation."
 She gathers up her more valuable possessions, including Carl, and
 theatrically wraps the pink towel around herself.  "Carl!"  she says,
 presenting the skateboard to him.  "You know how to ride one of
 these?"  Carl looks quizzically at the board, then puts it down and
 mounts it.  He then lifts Alice onto his back (not without
 considerable effort).  You open the door for the two as they glide out
 of the apartment.

 "Be seeing ya," says Alice as they depart.

 "Don't count on it," you say, closing the door.

 "Projection, repression, rationalization, sublimation!"  John recites
 desperately.

 In the near silence, you hear a soft but obnoxious dripping noise
 coming from the direction of the kitchen.

>go west
 Kitchen

    When you moved into this apartment, the kitchen was a horrendous
 mess.  Because you've agreed to let John maintain the kitchen while
 you maintain the bathroom, it still is; the stove is encrusted with
 the pathetic results of previous meals, the refrigerator is in sore
 need of a wipedown, and the kitchen sink as usual is filled with
 mostly useless items.  A kitchen table sits in the center of the room.
 The living room is to the east.
    You see three piece of cellophanes and a remote control here.

 Evan follows you into the kitchen, still playing the game.

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

>examine sink
 This, as you probably surmised, is the kitchen sink.  At the moment it
 is fairly filthy, thanks to John's recent diligent efforts at *not*
 scrubbing it.  Under the sink is a cabinet in which the kitchen
 plumbing can be accessed.  In the kitchen sink there are broken
 dishes; other than that, you see nothing at all.

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

>look under sink
 Under the sink you see a cabinet.

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

>open cabinet
 Opening the cabinet reveals the pipes which comprise the kitchen
 plumbing.  Besides that, you see nothing at all in it.

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

>examine plumbing
 This is a series of curved piping which connects the apartment to the
 local sewage system.  The pipes look like they're leaking.

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

>fix pipes
 (with the wrench)
 You tighten the pipes with your wrench, stopping the leak.  However,
 as the last echoes of the dripping water fade in the kitchen, you hear
 the sound of dropping water in the bathroom...

 In the near silence, you hear a soft but obnoxious dripping noise
 coming from the direction of the bathroom.

>go east
 Bathroom

    The bathroom, fortunately, is one of the rooms you've agreed to
 maintain, and as a result it isn't too filthy.  Against the north wall
 is a gleaming sink and a mirror mounted above it; next to the mirror
 is a medicine cabinet.  On the south wall is a towel rack.  A toilet
 and shower, both scrubbed to exquisite perfection with lye-based
 cleansers, complete this traditional bathroom.  The only exit to this
 bathroom is through a door to the west, which is open.

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

 Evan follows you into the bathroom, still playing the game.

>open cabinet
 Which cabinet do you mean, the bathroom sink cabinet, or the medicine
 cabinet?

>sink
 The bathroom sink cabinet is already open!

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

>examine pipes
 Which pipes do you mean, the ceiling pipes, or the bathroom sink
 pipes?

>sink
 This is a series of curved piping which connects the apartment to the
 local sanitation system.  The pipes look like they're leaking.

 Somewhere below you, you hear a dripping sound.

>fix sink pipes
 (with the wrench)
 You tighten the pipes with your wrench, stopping the leak.  You stop
 the dripping water in the pipes under the sink.  Breathing a sigh of
 relief, you wipe sweat off your forehead...  Wait a minute.  That
 wasn't too taxing.  Why are you sweating?  Looking overhead, you
 notice a new leak has sprung up in the overhead pipes.

 Somewhere above you, you hear a dripping sound.

>fix ceiling pipes
 (with the wrench)
 They're well out of your reach.

 Somewhere above you, you hear a dripping sound.

>stand on sink
 Climbing onto the sink is impractical as well as unsanitary in
 general.

 Somewhere above you, you hear a dripping sound.

>stand on toilet
 Your attempt to gain ground using the toilet proves futile, as the
 toilet, lacking a seat, provides no secure footholds upon which you
 can stand.  The fact that you have polished the toilet to mirror-shine
 perfection, making what little surface there is very slippery, doesn't
 help.  Nor does your desire not to dirty the toilet with your feet.

 Somewhere above you, you hear a dripping sound.

 have to go inside to get a better look at what's there.

 From elsewhere in the apartment, you hear Bob's snores shaking the

>go east
 Your Closet

    Dimly illuminated, this closet provides you with an impenetrable
 defense against outside noise.  The door, which is to the west and
 open, is steel-reinforced and soundproof, preventing even the loudest
 party sounds from getting through.  Though the closet is small, it is
 roomy enough for you and several of your favorite textbooks, and
 you've studied for many an exam here.
    You see a toolbox and a swivel chair here.

>examine bob
 Bob, alleged star athlete on the school's basket weaving team
 (Australian rules), is rather crude, rude, perpetually inebriated, and
 more than a bit ditzy.  Unfortunately, that's his good side.  He's
 looking a little better than usual today, though, having recently
 pulled through a savage bout with scurvy, but fortunately (from Bob's
 point of view), you don't need teeth to drink beer. At the moment he's
 thoroughly passed out.

 in as much Psychology knowledge into his brain as possible, and, come
 eight o'clock, goes nervously to his exam.

     "I did it!"  yells John hours later, as he arrives home
 triumphantly with the exam, graded "D+."  You feel a strong sense of
 relief as you collapse onto your beloved paisley couch.  Finally!

    In three weeks, John receives his degree, and promptly moves out.
 He shakes your hand before leaving, saying, "I couldn't have done it
 without you, man.  I owe you a lot.  I hope it isn't too lonely here
 without me.  It's like we've become such good friends over the years,
 and now we have to part."

    "Isn't there a plane you have to catch...I mean, I'll miss you
 too," you say.

    And so, life alone begins.  The rent is more expensive now that
 you're living alone, but the whole apartment is cleaner and quieter,
 and you can now relax and enjoy yourself.

    Three months later...








 [Press any key to continue]








     The doorbell rings.  You get up, and when you answer it, you
 see...John!  He looks just as ratty as usual, only he's carrying a
 double armload of papers as well as a sizable stack on his head.
 Surrounding him are clamoring freshmen, looking agitated as they paw
 at the papers.

    "Hi there!"  he says, grinning.  "I guess I need a place to stay
 again.  You see, after I passed that Psych exam, I was feeling very
 confident in myself.  So confident, I decided to apply to grad school
 here...and they accepted me!"

 Bathroom, standing on the swivel chair

    The bathroom, fortunately, is one of the rooms you've agreed to
 maintain, and as a result it isn't too filthy.  Against the north wall
 is a gleaming sink and a mirror mounted above it; next to the mirror
 is a medicine cabinet.  On the south wall is a towel rack.  A toilet
 and shower, both scrubbed to exquisite perfection with lye-based
 cleansers, complete this traditional bathroom.  The only exit to this
 bathroom is through a door to the west, which is open.
    You see a swivel chair here.
    Evan is here, playing an electronic trivia game.
