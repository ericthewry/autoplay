 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 At the Show
 You're in a dark, poorly lit and packed club. Everyone's staring at the
 band as they go about tuning and shifting their instruments. The guy
 next to you has a mohawk that flops over to the side, as if the heat
 had wilted it. In contrast, the skinhead in front of you is reacting to
 the heat like a Mexican jumping bean, the muscles of his back tensing
 and releasing, tensing and releasing.

>mosh
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>jump
 Before you can do anything, the band explodes into action. The crowd
 coalesces into a single entity and leans towards them, then falls back,
 ripples. Being a part of this lurching creature makes your spine
 tingle.

 You're pressed from all sides by people suddenly activated by sound --
 but you can't hear anything. You can practically feel the sonic waves,
 you can see it on the faces of the people around you, and you strain to
 hear the music...

 The guy with the mohawk plants his boot in the skinhead's linked hands.
 His pierced nostrils flaring, hands gripping the skinhead's shoulders,
 he launches himself on the crowd. Improbably, they hold him aloft as he
 rolls over a bed made of their shoulders, heads and outstretched hands.
 You can't quite believe what you're seeing, and suddenly you hear
 something:

 "Honey?"

 You whip around and look to see who spoke, but there's nothing except
 the unremarkable brick wall of the club lined with people standing on
 chairs to get a better view. None of them are looking at you.


 You look back. The guy with the mohawk is still rolling over the crowd,
 but for some reason he's got a tie on. And his blue hair is flickering
 like flames. The skinhead offers his linked hands to boost you up, and
 you quickly put your foot in. Your foot is bare. He looks at you, his
 dark eyes questioning.

 "Honey!"

 You look at your foot. Of course it's bare -- you're in your bed.

 Your mother bustles in with your uniform, freshly ironed, and hangs it
 on your bathroom doorknob. "OK, honey, we're off." She stops at the
 foot of your bed and puts her hands on her hips. "Better hurry or
 you'll miss your bus. Don't want to be late the very first day of high
 school!"

 You smile weakly as she kisses you goodbye and leaves, trying to
 rekindle the feelings in your dream.

 Your Room (on the bed)
 Your room is a mess -- posters slowly peel off the walls to join the
 small heaps of clothes that spot the floor like death mounds. There's a
 path south through the junk from your bed to your bathroom, one going
 north to the rest of the house.

 You can see a school uniform here.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

 As good-looking as ever.

>go north
 You'll have to get off the bed first.

>examine posters
 Your older sister gave you her Smiths poster when she went to college,
 and there's a Platinum Blonde one you really meant to take down years
 ago. But most prominent is the Sid Vicious poster you got at a headshop
 this summer -- Sid's being rude and ugly in the most appealing way
 imaginable, giving a middle finger to the world.

>get off
 You get off the bed.

 Your Room

 You can see a school uniform here.

>go north
 You're not ready to face school yet.

>examine uniform
 Your school uniform, worn once in the fitting room of the suit store,
 radiates a crisp and calm assurance. You hate it already.

>wear uniform
 (first taking the school uniform)
 Taken.

>wear uniform
 You just can't bear to. You've got to do something to balance out the
 primness of it first.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

>go south

 Your Bathroom

 This grotty little tiled room might not be pretty, but it's got the
 ultimate luxury for a thirteen-year-old boy: privacy. On the negative
 side, it's also got a massive mirror that reminds you of your wretched
 physicality every time you go take a dump.

 The mirror-fronted cabinet reflects a medium-sized, pimply faced
 man-child with a chronic case of bedhead and a face not even Cyndi
 Lauper could love.

>wrinkle uniform
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>tear uniform
 Yeah, that's punk! you think. But after a minute of straining and
 grunting you give up, amazed at how strong they're making polyester
 blends these days.

>examine walls
 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cabinet
 You can't see inside, since the mirror cabinet is closed.

 You open the mirror cabinet, revealing an electric shaver.

 You bought these hair clippers a while ago, but haven't had the guts to
 use them yet.

>look in the mirror
 In the mirror cabinet is an electric shaver.

>break mirror
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>take shaver
 You lift the electric shaver and hold it in your grip almost
 reverently, placing your thumb on the red switch. Its cord uncoils and
 hangs in the air as you turn it over.

>shave
 Plugging it in first, you slide the button and the shaver snaps to
 life. You hold it in your hand tightly, letting the vibration buzz
 through you. Then, gripped by the vision of another you, you put it to
 the side of your head and shave your first strip off. And another. And
 another. The chunks of hair make a small pile at your feet.

 You now have a mohawk.

 [You get five punk points for that.]

 Finished with it, you switch it off and return it to the cabinet. As
 you shut it, you see a punk in the mirror -- the hair defiantly greasy,
 the acne now angry scars. Your flaws suddenly make sense. You rub your
 hand over your shorn scalp and stare at your new self with a mixture of
 joy and terror.

 You have so far scored 5 out of a possible 50, in 22 turns, which gives
 you the rank of Wannabe.

>give finger
 You can't see any such thing.

>flip off
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>about
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>help
 Have you EXAMINED everything around you? Have you checked to see what
 you have in your INVENTORY recently? If you're trying to get useful
 things out of characters, ASK ____ ABOUT ____ will be the most
 revealing. Keep in mind that 80% of the commands needed to win the game
 are in the format VERB NOUN (ie. ATTACK STU). If you'd like to see how
 far into the game you are, check your SCORE, and you can UNDO one turn.
 There's also INFO on the game itself.

 And that's all the help you get. Hints are for fucking posers.

 Your Bathroom

 This grotty little tiled room might not be pretty, but it's got the
 ultimate luxury for a thirteen-year-old boy: privacy. On the negative
 side, it's also got a massive mirror that reminds you of your wretched
 physicality every time you go take a dump.

 From the mirror, a punk gazes back.

 You can also see an a sizeable pile of your hair here.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Ah, you'll clean up after school. You're already late.

>wear uniform
 You pull on the polyester slacks and button up the starchy shirt. As
 you knot your tie, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the bathroom
 mirror and note how nicely the preppy uniform is set off by your new
 hairstyle.

 You practice your nastiest sneer and give yourself the finger. Today's
 your first day at the most authoritarian and repressive school in the
 city, and these are your only weapons.

 You play it right, and they'll be enough.

 Giving your Sid poster a knowing wink, you toss your blazer jacket over
 your shoulder and stalk out of the room.

                    [Please press SPACE to begin.]








 You're at a school assembly, enduring speech after boring speech about
 the school's legacy and tradition.

 You've got to do something or you'll go crazy.

 School Gymnasium
 The gymnasium is packed with boys, all wearing the same uniform and the
 same glazed expression. The rows and rows of chairs face a stage on
 which various old codgers parade their inability to say anything
 interesting. You slump in your chair and entertain yourself by reading
 the variety of pointless competitions on the pennants around the room,
 and look longingly at the exit to the east -- even the washroom to the
 south looks good.

>examine pennants
 LAWN DART SEMIREGIONALS 1971 -- CITYWIDE VOLLYBALL CHAMPS '81 -- RUGBY
 NATIONALS 1976 -- BIG WASTE OF TIME 1985.
 "We expect you to act as representatives of the school at all times," a
 portly old brother is saying, "That means being Christian, courteous,
 and well groomed." You take in the huge stains on his armpits, clearly
 visible even with a black shirt, and note that he's somehow smudged his
 white priest's collar.

 You hear something being repeated, chanted. You look over and see that
 the skinhead's looking straight at you and grinning with all his teeth.

>give finger to brother
 You can only do that to something animate.

 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine brother
 He's flying on auto-pilot, this one -- he barely seems to be able to
 keep his eyes open.

 "And disrespect to the uniform will be treated as severely as
 disrespect to one of your teachers. You are encouraged to wear your
 blazer to and from the school, but if you choose not to, jean jackets
 are absolutely forbidden." That strikes you as a weird restriction --
 is this 1985 or 1958? A man with a beard leans over and whispers
 something and he nods. "Cowboy boots are also forbidden."

 You can't see any such thing.

 There's three of them lined up together against the west wall -- a
 goth, a mod, and a skinhead with a predatory grin. They're too far away
 to see much more.

 "I'd like to introduce you to your vice principal, Mr. Pannus."

 The skinhead fake-coughs into his fist: "Penis." Pannus either doesn't
 hear or pretends not to.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your middle finger
   a blazer (being worn)
   a tie (being worn)

 "Thank you, Brother Matthews," Mr. Pannus begins, tilting the mike up
 at his well trimmed beard. "Last year, two boys were expelled for
 behavioural problems. You are attending an elite academy, and it is a
 privilege to be doing so -- not a right -- so if you behave like
 animals, be prepared to be treated as such."

 The skinhead's chant starts up again, just below your ability to hear.
 "------or -----er"? You suddenly dread he's calling you a poser. You
 glance at the other two, but they're ignoring him, looking supremely
 bored as they lean against the wall.

>show middle finger to brother matthers
 You can only do that to something animate.

>show middle finger to brother matthews
 You can only do that to something animate.

>give finger to pannus
 All right -- look at it like the punk's version of the samurai sword.
 Unless it's worthy of drawing blood, you don't just whip it out.

 Mr. Pannus nods to a boy who brings a flag to the front, and then looks
 to the band.

 You sneak a glance at the skinhead, who's still watching you. In the
 silence before the band begins, he does a daring triple-fake-cough:
 "Hard-Core-Niner!"

 You look away, pretending to yawn. Well, it was better than being
 called poser.

 You can only do that to something animate.

>go south
 You get out of your seat and squeeze by countless grey knees...

 Gymnasium Changeroom

 This is the bathroom part of the changeroom, which exits to the north.
 Your usual assortment of bathroom fixtures: urinals, mirrors, sinks,
 and a toilet stall.  A big white garbage can sits in one corner, full
 almost to overflowing.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) "music" from the gym.

>save
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine stall
>look in mirror
 The stall appears to be smoking. You wonder where it picked up the
 habit.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) "music" from the gym.

 You find nothing of interest.

>get towels
 (the garbage can)
 Judging by the chip on your shoulder, you like carrying around unwieldy
 objects. But this is ridiculous.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) droning from the gym.

>piss
 For the duration of this game, you have an infinitely expanding bladder
 and intestinal tract.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) droning from the gym.

>knock on stall
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>open stall
 It's locked, but your rattling provokes a sudden coughing, a choking, a
 flushing, and a huge jock stumbles out of the stall wreathed in smoke.
 When he sees it's only you, his face collapses in relief -- for about a
 second, until annoyance replaces it.

 He washes his hands menacingly. "Better watch your step, niner," he
 says, his grizzled jaw clamped. He looks terrifyingly like a real man.
 "Stomp you and your stupid haircut into the ground." He wipes his
 mammoth hands off on your blazer, and leaves the bathroom.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) droning from the gym.

>examine blazer
 It's black and has the Pope Innocent III school crest right over your
 heart. Aw.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) droning from the gym.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>open stall
 You open the toilet stall, revealing a toilet and some toilet paper.

>look in stall
 In the toilet stall are a toilet and some toilet paper.

 As you pity the janitor who's gotta clean this bespeckled beast, you
 notice a lighter beside it.

 There's only about two feet left. Enough for two average dumps or one

 The jock's not going to be pleased when he realizes he's lost his fire.
 It has the logo of a beer company on it.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) droning from the gym.

 (the garbage can)

 Before you flick the Bic you notice that the smoke detector is a few
 feet above the can. It'd be going off before you left the room. If this
 was a Hollywood movie you'd have a fuse handy.


 It's mounted on the ceiling, well out of your reach.

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) droning from the gym.

>put paper in can
 You manage to get it tucked into the can, although most of it trails
 down the side.

>light paper
 With what? Your burning ambition?

 You hear muffled (but still discernibly dull) droning from the gym.

>light paper with lighter

 You light a corner of the toilet paper and head back to your seat in
 the auditorium. A few seconds after your bum hits the chair the fire
 alarm starts ringing. The brother saying prayers looks at the roof, as
 if betrayed by God.

 The crowd of boys goops towards the exit with speed of molasses, and
 just as you squeeze out the front door someone grabs your collar.

 Shit, you think. Caught so soon? The game's barely begun.

 It's the skinhead. "Well, Hardcore Niner," he says, slapping down your
 blazer and straightening your tie, "Let's get a look at you!"

 The mod and the goth join him, and the three of them scrutinize you in
 the bright sun of the basketball court. It's beginning to fill up with
 increasingly rambunctious boys.

 "Hey," one coifed gino says to someone who's just emerged. "What the
 fuck did I tell you to do? Huh?"

 The mod pokes his head towards the east, "Let's go to the Path before
 Penis comes out." He includes you in this, and the four of you walk
 away together, the skinhead and the goth in front.

 "I'm Jackson," says the mod, "They're Stuart and Dave. That was you,
 back there, wasn't it?"

 You shrug non-commitally.

 He smiles and hands you a small photocopied magazine. "You might like
 this zine. It's full of shit-disturbing stuff. A friend of a friend of
 mine made it."

 "Thanks," you say.

 The Path
 The Path, the thin sidewalk that links the school grounds to the real
 world, is neither on or off school property. It's no-man's-land, and
 all suspect activity takes place here. Like most legendary spots, it's
 rather unimpressive in actuality -- it's a butt-littered sidewalk that
 heads west to the school and east to freedom.

 You can see Stuart, Dave and Jackson here.

>save
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>read zine
 It's a small photocopied and stapled booklet called "Virus: A Zine
 Dedicated to Spreading Truth". A picture of Christ that's been coloured
 in brown is on the cover: "NEWSFLASH: Jesus wasn't a cracker!". Inside
 are articles on punk rock iconography, censorship in science class, and
 the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church -- you can READ ABOUT ____ IN
 ZINE, if you were so inclined.

 There are already a few boys smoking on the Path when you get there.
 They're older, and your little group has stopped a few steps away from
 them.

 Jackson tells them that they have you to thank for the sudden closing
 of ceremonies.

 The skinhead chuckles. "Nice going H.C., I thought I was going to
 exPLODE in there. Dying for a smoke." He pulls out a pack and taps out
 a cigarette. The goth removes a silver case and puts a cigarillo
 between his thin lips.

>ask skinhead for cigarette
 He winces, but hands one over.

 You flick your lighter and manage your first puff without choking. But
 your second and third leave you watery eyed and hacked out. Stuart
 enthusiastically pounds on your back through it all, guffawing, "Hey
 there H.C., take it slow."

 "Hey!" yells one of the bigger boys on the Path. "That's my fucking
 lighter." He stomps up to you and yanks it out of your hand, almost
 taking a finger with it. He looks like he's going to kick your ass, but
 then notices Stuart standing behind you.

 "Fucking freaks," he says after a second, and goes back to his friends.

 Two weeks later, it's the day of the fall dance. You've decided that,
 lame or not, you want to go -- and your last chance to get your ticket
 is right after this class. There's ten minutes left, and you're a
 coiled spring waiting for the bell. But there's nothing you can do but
 wait.

 Science Classroom

 This is a room full of massive black worktables, each of them with
 their own sinks. An even larger demonstration table squats in front of
 a chart of the table of elements. You're seated two to a table on
 stools, and it feels like you should be doing something cool like
 dissecting rats or building robots -- but so far, you've been sitting
 there learning about non-reactive molecules. No wonder you've been
 staring out the window. There's an exit to the south.

>save
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

 The building blocks of the universe are depicted in a neat series of
 boxes, with no memory of their legacy of poisonous mushroom clouds. You
 hope they're not on the exam.

 You sit at the back of the class, your lab mate a sleeping rocker.
 Stuart, placed up at the very front, is engaged in a marker war with
 the mopheaded guy next to him. Every time the teacher turns around,
 they attempt to marker-slash the other guy's grey slacks.

 "Sir, I've got a question," a kid with a hearing aid says.

 "Yes, Jaimie, what is it?" the teacher says, turning around to add
 another element to the list he has there.

 Stuart grabs the opportunity to put a red line down the side of
 Mophead's pants. "Yesssss!" he hisses.

 "Is it possible to make LSD with the chemicals we have in this lab?"

 The class erupts in laughter.

>read about science class in zine
 "We discovered that several schools have removed this lesson from the
 curriculum. Since we at Virus have found it useful, we've decided to
 return it." Beneath it reads...

 "EXPERIMENT 4
 Synthesis of an Explosive: N13*NH3

 Many explosive molecules have nitrogen as one of the elemental
 components. Nitrogen single bonds to most atoms are quite weak, while
 the nitrogen - nitrogen triple bond is exceptionally stable (NH3 is an
 exception, in that its N-H single bonds are fairly stable). Energy
 liberated by the breaking of single nitrogen bonds can be substantial.

 Nitrogen - halogen single bonds are particularly reactive due to
 repulsion between the nitrogen and halide lone pairs. In this
 experiment you will make ammonium triiodide NI3, isolated as an
 ammoniate coordination complex. This compound, when dry, is a
 detonating explosive that is shock-sensitive. It can be handled when
 wet, but will explode unpredictably when dry.

 APPARATUS

 Basic glassware including 10-mL beaker, 2-mL pipette, glass rod are
 required for this experiment.

 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

 The product of this experiment is a shock-sensitive explosive when dry.
 The small amount prepared according to the procedure below is not
 dangerous, but larger amounts are serious explosion risks. Never scale
 up this procedure!"

 (At this point, the editors of Virus have handwritten: HA HA!)

 PROCEDURE

 Weigh 100mg (0.100 g) of iodine into a 10-mL beaker. Slowly add 2.0 mL
 of concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution. Stir the mixture for 5
 minutes -- a red precipitate should form. Transfer the moist
 precipitate onto several layers of filter paper placed on the floor of
 the fumehood, away from any breakable objects. Spread out the solid and
 permit it to dry for one hour.

 While you are waiting, answer the questions provided in the laboratory.
 These are to be handed in before you leave the laboratory."

 (At this point, the editors have handwritten: SURE TEACH, RIGHT AFTER I
 FINISH BLOWING UP THE SCHOOL!)

 "When the sample has dried, carefully tap it with the end of a
 yardstick, keeping as far away as possible. No other characterization
 is required, or advisable."

 The teacher quiets the class down, smirking slightly but with a nervous
 eye on the door. Not turning around, he says, "Even if we did, we
 wouldn't have the equipment to distil it. You getting this down,
 Jaimie?"

 "Yes sir. You seem to know an awful lot about making drugs, sir."

 Another laugh spreads through the class.

 Mophead is out of Stuart's range, talking to the boy behind him
 urgently. From the angle you're at, you can see the boy pass him two
 markers. Mophead grins at Stuart.

 Sturdy and soaked with chemicals.

 "Does anyone have any intelligent questions about the test on Monday?"
 the teacher says, turning around to see Stuart mid-lunge. He ignores
 it.

 "Is exercise four on it, sir?" one chubby boy asks.

 He looks blank for a second, grabs the exercise book off Stuart's desk
 and flips through it. "No," he says, "One through six, not including
 four. We didn't do exercise four."

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a zine
   some cash

 "What was exercise four?" pipes up Jaimie. "Sir?"

 "It was the formula for LSD, Jaimie, what else," says the teacher
 dryly.

 He's an alright guy, with only the occasional freakout.

 By this point Mophead has amassed a thick handful of markers and has
 put an elastic band around them. He shows it to Stuart under the desk,
 the uncapped tips glinting wet. Stuart is frantically rifling through
 the pencil case of the boy behind him for reinforcements, when the
 teacher turns his back.

 Stu feels, rather than sees, the rainbow wound on his leg from knee to
 ankle. You see his eyes close and his teeth clench. Mophead raises his
 clenched fists to the sky in slow motion, silent victory. "You're so
 dead!" Stuart hiss-shouts.

 "What's that, Stuart?" says the teacher without turning around.

 "Nothing sir."

>examine iodine
 You can't see any such thing.

 Science Classroom

 This is a room full of massive black worktables, each of them with
 their own sinks. An even larger demonstration table squats in front of
 a chart of the table of elements. You're seated two to a table on
 stools, and it feels like you should be doing something cool like
 dissecting rats or building robots -- but so far, you've been sitting
 there learning about non-reactive molecules. No wonder you've been
 staring out the window. There's an exit to the south.

 The bell rings.

 You move quickly, but not quickly enough. Stuart steps in front of you.

 "Hey H.C.," Stuart says, "Wait 'till you see --" He stops as he notices
 the teacher is standing beside him with his arms crossed.

 The teacher starts to lecture Stuart.

>go south

 "Hardcore, hold up," Stuart says, stepping in front of you while
 continuing to nod remorsefully at the teacher.

 The teacher continues the lecture. You crumple your ten in your pocket
 anxiously, feeling your chances of getting a ticket drain away.

>ask teacher about nitrogen
 You decide to keep your trap shut -- you don't want to be held after
 class and miss your only chance to get a ticket.

 The teacher wraps it up. "And you," he says, swivelling, "Unless you
 want to flunk and have to repeat this class like your friend here,
 you'll start bringing your books to class!"

 You nod but he's already turned his back.

 You rush out the door, Stuart beside you.

 "Hey, so I rolled this Nazi skinhead last night," he said, "For his
 docs."

 You rush down the hall and down the stairs, but Stuart continues
 obliviously. "But they're too small for me. They're awesome though,
 fourteen-holed with steel toes."

 You arrive on the first floor just in time to see them folding up the
 table. "Nope, sold out," you hear someone being told.

 You stop there, stunned. Stuart goes on, "Come out to the Path and I'll
 show you them."

 Numbly, you follow him.

 The Path
 The Path, the thin sidewalk that links the school grounds to the real
 world, is neither on or off school property. It's no-man's-land, and
 all suspect activity takes place here. Like most legendary spots, it's
 rather unimpressive in actuality -- it's a butt-littered sidewalk that
 heads west to the school and east to freedom.

 You can see Stuart here.

 He pulls a pair of boots out of his khaki backpack and drops them in
 front of you, then gropes for his smokes.

 "Yep," he says, "That Nazi bonehead never knew what hit him." He takes
 a drag. "OK," he says, not looking at you. "Try 'em on."

 Stuart rants about Pannus.

>wear pants
 You can't see any such thing.

>try 'em on
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>wear docs
 (first taking the Doc Martens boots)
 Taken.

>wear docs

 You step into the boots and lace them up, pretending that you've worn
 14-hole docs every day of your life.

 "Yeah," Stuart says, looking at you appraisingly, "That's better. You
 won't look like such a poser tonight at the dance."

 You feel sick thinking about how you haven't got a ticket but you
 muster up a grateful smile.

 He sits down on the ground and leans against the fence, puffing away.

 You bum a smoke from Stu. "What a mooch," he gripes, "Score you an
 awesome pair of docs and you take my last smoke, too."

 You smoke quickly and nervously, then toss the butt in the graveyard.

>tell stuart about dance
 This provokes no reaction.

>examine laces

 "Since when you the boss of me, niner?"

 Stu yawns.

>examine boots

 They're beautiful boots. Thick soled, shiny black criss-crossed with
 red laces. The toes are bulbous and slightly squared off.

 Stu laments the state of his markered-up slacks.

>ask stu about dance
 You start to ask Stu if he knows anyone selling tickets, but stop. You
 feel like a total putz, since they were on sale all week. You resolve
 to get a ticket without the guys knowing.

 Stu yawns.

 heads west to the school and east to freedom.

 You can see Stuart here.

>go west

 The Portables
 These one-room portables are meant to be temporary but these battered
 aluminium boxes look older than the school itself. Ugly things, but
 they do serve nicely to obscure the activities of the Path from prying
 eyes in the school. You can venture south to the field or enter the
 playground by going west.

>examine boxes
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine portables
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>go south

 Track and Field
 A track rings the large multi-purpose field, and trees ring the track.
 The school looms to the west, its window eyes silently judging the
 players. This is where boys become men, where the raw ore of youth is
 pounded into iron, where the limits of the body and spirit are tested.

 Where the jocks frolic, in other words.

 There's a bunch of jocks throwing around a melon shaped ball and
 running around in a very intense fashion.

>examine jocks

 One of them's the guy whose lighter you found. He notices you staring
 at them. "What you looking at, faggot?" he shouts between catching and
 throwing the ball.

>ask jock about tickets
 There is no reply.

>give middle finger to jocks
 You give the jocks the finger.

 [You get 5 punk points for that.]

 As one, their faces turn ugly -- then they look at each other in silent
 consultation. The lighter guy tosses the ball to someone else and
 stomps towards you.

 The lighter guy is even bigger than you remember him, his face with an
 out-of-place look of thoughtfulness as he considers what to do to you.
 He finally decides on pulling your blazer up and over your head, then
 spinning you around until you fall of your own accord. Guffaws echo in
 your ears.

 The Playground
 The asphalt is painted with various arcane white lines which you assume
 are used in playing something, but you've never seen anyone doing
 anything but shooting hoops here. The side door to the school cafeteria
 is propped open to the west, the portables squat to the east, or you
 can go AWOL and head north.

>go west

 The Caf
 There's a constant hubbub in this large room intended for eating food.
 There's a lot more card players, arguers, wrestlers and crammers than
 there are diners, however, all playing out their little dramas. Off to
 the side is a little food booth, occupied by Old Pudge.

 There's a stairwell to the west, and you can smell the fresh air coming
 from the east door.

 You can see Old Pudge here.

>examine pudge
 He sells a surprising variety of things, meeting all teenage boy needs
 -- excepting, perhaps, porn and smokes. The fat old man is wedged in
 his booth, wiping up something, his apron swaying with the exertion.

>ask pudge about ticket
 Old Pudge grunts and shakes his head, continues rubbing grease around
 the counter.

>go west

 Stairwell
 A crossroads of sorts, the stairwell area allows you to go up to the
 second floor, down to the gym, and east to the caf. This is where,
 according to the daily PA announcements, boys tend to "linger" -- and
 said lingering causes clogging and potential accidents: consequently,
 lingering in the stairwell is forbidden.

>go up

 Second Floor, East
 The science lab is to the north and stairs lead up and down. Grey
 lockers line the walls, as do doors to various classrooms.

 They're (by administrative decree) painfully non-descript.

 This is as high as this high school gets. You can go back down, south
 to the library, or you can follow the hallway west. Lockers and
 classroom doors line the walls.

>go south

 Library
 The musty little room is choked with books, with only barely enough
 room for a reading table and the librarian's desk. It's hard to imagine
 a better way to discourage reading.

 You can see Dave and a librarian here.

>examine dave

 Dave has a curtain of curly bangs he wears draped over his angular
 face, which is mirrored by the plethora of loose threads he's
 unravelled from his tie. His pointy toed boots fit neatly into his
 specially tapered slacks.
 There's a strange scratching sound.

>examine dave

 Dave has a curtain of curly bangs he wears draped over his angular
 face, which is mirrored by the plethora of loose threads he's
 unravelled from his tie. His pointy toed boots fit neatly into his
 specially tapered slacks.

 You realize the scratching is coming from behind Dave's book. It's
 quite loud, and when you look at him questioningly, he mumbles, "She's
 totally deaf."

>f x librarian
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine librarian

 The librarian has the grey bun and the grandmotherly stylings that are
 guaranteed to negate even the most determined teenage lust. Presumably,
 given the similarities to the school secretary, they're sisters -- but
 no one cares enough to ask.

 The scratching pauses for long enough for Dave to sweep the shavings
 off the table.

>look behind book
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>examine table
 On the reading table is a carving. It's kind of round with some lines
 in it...oh, forget it. It's all greek to a geek like you.

>examine carving
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some Doc Martens boots (being worn)
   a zine
   some cash
   your middle finger
   a blazer (being worn)
   a tie (being worn)

>read zine
 It's a small photocopied and stapled booklet called "Virus: A Zine
 Dedicated to Spreading Truth". A picture of Christ that's been coloured
 in brown is on the cover: "NEWSFLASH: Jesus wasn't a cracker!". Inside
 are articles on punk rock iconography, censorship in science class, and
 the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church -- you can READ ABOUT ____ IN
 ZINE, if you were so inclined.

>read about punk rock iconography
 What do you want to read about in?

>zine
 Handwritten above a series of arcane symbols and definitions is: "We at
 Virus believe that, while pretending to be the exact opposite, the
 hardcore scene has become an elitist club. To combat that, and for
 historical record, we give you the Iconography of Punk Rock."

 Scanning the symbols, you recognize the one Dave was carving -- it's
 for a band called "Dead Kennedys".

>ask dave about dead kennedys
 Dave's eyes widen in surprise.

 "You know them? Cool," Dave enthuses.

 [You get five punk points for that.]

 Dave looks down at your boots and then gives you a sideways look.
 "Their best one is the song 'Nazi Punk, Fuck Off'..."

 "Yeah, Nazis suck," you concur.

 "You know Nazis wear red laces?"

 "Oh," you say, feeling like an idiot. "Yeah. Well, Stuart said he took
 -- rolled -- a skin for these."

 "Huh," says Dave. "Well, I think they got laces at the caf." He goes
 back to his carving.

 "You boys be quiet," says the librarian suddenly.

 "Fuck off, you old biddy," says Dave, hidden behind his book.

 She doesn't even look up from her book.

 Third Floor, West
 This is the most remote part of the school, and so naturally your

 its deadly silences punctuated by barked orders and sobs ensure that
 you visit your locker as infrequently as possible.

 Better not -- it makes enough noise to attract the detention room
 monitor, and you're not allowed to be up here during your lunch hour.

 There's a stairwell to the west, and you can smell the fresh air coming
 from the east door.

 You can see Old Pudge here.

>ask pudge about laces

 You point at your boots. "I need laces," you say to Old Pudge, and he
 looks under the counter. He pulls out two exceptionally long black
 laces like they were spaghetti and slaps them on the counter. "Two
 bucks," he says, and you gladly pay.

 Excited, you sit down in the middle of the floor and remove the red
 laces and start lacing up the black ones. It takes a while to thread
 fourteen eyeholes, and you attract the attention of quite a few boys.
 When you've tightened them and get up, you find yourself looking into
 Mr. Pannus' unsmiling bearded face.

 "Those boots are not regulation, are they. Come with me," he says
 softly, and you walk behind him to...

 The Detention Room
 It's a classroom that evokes the feel of an interrogation chamber
 without resorting to a single bare bulb. There's a blackboard and a
 large teacher's desk. All except a few of the desks have been removed,
 and Jackson sits at one of them. The other boy is Mophead, who gives
 you a vacuous grin.

 You can see Mophead, Pannus and Jackson here.
 Pannus stares at you without blinking.

>examine jackson

 Jackson's a handsome boy with his hair carefully gelled and cut short.
 He wears a voluminous bomber jacket with the target symbol on the back,
 and neat little brogues -- he's not violating uniform regulations at
 all unless you count the union jack sewn to his tie.
 Pannus stares at you without blinking.
 Jackson runs his hand through his hair and sighs.

 Pannus notices your interest in the tickets. "It's completely sold
 out," he says, stroking his beard like a pet, "These are for the boys
 who will take the tickets at the door." He looks at you for a second,
 his green eyes seeming to flicker. "I'll tell you what. If you clean
 the blackboard, I'll let you be on the first shift."
 Pannus stares at you without blinking.

 Pannus stares at your finger. He looks down at his reading for a

 without the strap? Get out," he flips a page, "Get out, all of you."

 Mophead and Jackson sprint out the door in front of you, grinning
 wildly.

 "Nice one, man," Mophead says. "And hey, if you need a dance ticket,
 Terry can hook you up. He's selling them out front of the school."

 "He has extra tickets?" you say.

 "You might say that," Mophead says mysteriously and takes off, bouncing
 down the hall and glancing in the windows of the classrooms.

 Jackson solemnly shakes your hand. "Nicely done, my good man." He turns
 and gets his stuff out of his locker. "I'm skipping the rest of the
 day. Don't want to run into Pannus again with the mood he's in. Luckily
 he won't be at the dance." Jackson zips up his bomber and taps his
 pockets for his smokes, then walks off. At the last moment he turns
 around and salutes you, then disappears down the stairwell.

 Main Entrance
 This is the front door of the school, but other than the name carved
 above the southbound archway and the signage warning people to report

 Despite the plainness, there's a boy here drawing the entryway in a
 large sketchbook. He spares you a brief glance.

>ask boy about tickets
 He gives you a glance, slightly longer than average, then goes back to
 sketching. Just when you think he's ignored you completely, he says,
 "Why ask me?"

 Going along with the cloak-and-dagger routine, you stare off into space
 a second yourself. Then, not looking at him, you say "They're sold out.
 A friend told me you might be able to hook me up."

 Terry nods. "Ten bucks."

 "I only got eight," you say, "C'mon."

 Terry shakes his head. "Niners," he says with disgust. "I need some of
 those office slips for uniform violations. Get me some of those and you
 can have it for eight."

 On the counter are some slips.

 Although she's keying information into the computer, the secretary's
 huge glasses make it impossible to tell if she's looking at you.

 The Office
 The office is quiet and orderly, with a large counter separating the
 office proper from the visitors. Two doors against the far wall are,
 according to the signs, the lairs of Brother Matthews and Mr. Pannus,
 and sandwiched between them is a massive painting of Pope Innocent III.

 On the counter are some slips.

 Although she's keying information into the computer, the secretary's
 huge glasses make it impossible to tell if she's looking at you.


 "Wouldn't know, dear," she says distractedly. "Shouldn't you be in
 class?"

>examine painting
 This is a very strange cartoonish depiction of Pope Innocent III. The
 colours are really bright, and his slightly cross-eyed gaze is almost
 goofy and not at all that of a MILITANT PASTOR AND GREAT MONARCH, which
 the plaque screwed into the frame insists he is.

>examine plaque
 You can't see any such thing.

>look behind painting
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>ask secretary about painting

 She tilts her glasses and her eyes meet yours for the first time.
 "That's Pope Innocent the Third," she says, turning around in her seat
 to look at him. "He was a great man."

>get slips
 You stealthily slide the slips off the counter. Taken.

 "He took the bull by the horns," the secretary continues, her back to
 you. "He didn't take any nonsense from the heretics, he launched a
 Crusade when they got uppity! He did God's work. A great man."

>wait
 Time passes.

 She seems lost in reverie, staring at the painting as if she remembered
 him personally.

>wait
 Time passes.

 She swivels around and looks at you. "Oh, well, you're new here aren't
 you? So you haven't even seen the wonderful statue of him that stands
 beside the sign in front of the school." Her face darkens and she
 returns to the computer, tapping the keys a little harder than she
 needs to. "We had to clean it after someone --" She looks at you
 sharply, and you get the smirk off your face just in time. She seems to
 notice your mohawk for the first time. "Well, never mind. They'll be
 lowering it onto the pedestal tomorrow morning." She shakes her head,
 pointing back at Innocent. "He wouldn't put up with that kind of monkey
 business, I tell you that."

>go north

 Second Floor, West
 There's a prominently displayed trophy case and rows and rows of
 official looking plaques to impress parents on their way south to the
 office. The hallway continues east, and north is the way back outside.

>go north

 Main Entrance
 This is the front door of the school, but other than the name carved
 above the southbound archway and the signage warning people to report
 to the office, there's not a lot of ceremony here. Pretty plain for a
 school as pompous as Pope.

 Despite the plainness, there's a boy here drawing the entryway in a
 large sketchbook. He spares you a brief glance.

>give slips to terry
 Terry takes the money and slips and pockets them. Then, from his
 sketchbook, he places an original ticket beside a blank piece of
 cardboard. With a thin line marker, he draws in the dancing leafs, the
 bubble style lettering that says FALL DANCE!, and all the small details
 the original incorporated to make it counterfeit proof. When he's done,
 he looks over his handiwork and then hands it to you.

 He turns his attention to the slips next, removing another original
 from the back of his sketchbook. He forges the signature on one of
 them, then checks the "slacks" infraction. He hands it to you. "This is
 for Stuart."

 Track and Field
 A track rings the large multi-purpose field, and trees ring the track.
 The school looms to the west, its window eyes silently judging the
 players. This is where boys become men, where the raw ore of youth is
 pounded into iron, where the limits of the body and spirit are tested.

 Where the jocks frolic, in other words.

 The Path
 The Path, the thin sidewalk that links the school grounds to the real
 world, is neither on or off school property. It's no-man's-land, and
 all suspect activity takes place here. Like most legendary spots, it's
 rather unimpressive in actuality -- it's a butt-littered sidewalk that
 heads west to the school and east to freedom.

 You can see Stuart here.

 Stuart rants about Pannus.

>give slip to stu
 You casually hand it over to Stu, who glances at you suspiciously...
 and then breaks out in a huge grin. "So you've met Terry, eh?" he says,
 smiling.

 "Yeah," you say casually, "Got him to do me up one of these."

 You flash Stu the counterfeit ticket, and he starts to laugh. "Yeah,
 it's gonna suck, they always do..." the skinhead says, exhaling smoke
 in a world-weary way. "But it's pretty much the only thing goin'. Few
 chicks at least."

 You nod and shrug.

 "Yeah, we're meeting up here later tonight. You should come. Should be
 able to score some booze, take a little bit of the lameness out of the
 evening's festivities."

 Mophead comes up from the school for a smoke and thumbs at you. "Shudda
 SEEN this guy, Stu-Fart, he fuckin' gave Penis the FINGER."

 "The FINGER! PENIS!" Mophead goes to high-five you and you let him. "Ah
 man, that was awesome!"

 You shrug, lean against the fence and try not to grin too broadly as
 your exploits are recounted blow by blow.

 The Path
 The Path, the thin sidewalk that links the school grounds to the real
 world, is neither on or off school property. It's no-man's-land, and
 all suspect activity takes place here. At night, with the moon shining
 down, it's a little more mysterious, but it's still just a
 butt-littered sidewalk going east and west.

 You can see Dave here.

 You and Dave are sitting against the fence, waiting for the others. You
 pick up and toss pebbles into the shadows across the Path. Dave keeps
 plucking at his skull-buckle boots and not saying anything. You wish he
 was more talkative, but his veil of hair (which he's dyed black for the
 occasion) is impenetrable.

 You're a little cold. You're wearing a sleeveless union jack t-shirt
 without a jacket, since the rest of your ensemble -- khaki pants rolled
 up to show off your docs and a gelled up mohawk -- doesn't go with your
 dumpy corduroy jacket. You look at Dave's long overcoat with jealousy.

 Stuart and Jackson appear, talking. They're dressed for the dance. "I
 don't -- there they are."

 "Hey," Stuart says, thumping against the fence opposite you. "We're
 late 'cause Jackson's a total pussy."

 "Shut up," says Jackson. "We ended up getting it, didn't we?"

 "Yeah, well, if you had just gone in and got it..." Stuart goads,
 pulling the flat bottle out of his army jacket and shaking it.

 "What are you shaking it for?" Dave says scornfully. "You don't shake
 liquor. It's not orange juice."

 Stuart shrugs, unscrewing the top. "Can't hurt," a slightly embarrassed
 look on his face. "If you're the expert, why didn't you get it?"

 "What did you get?" you say, wanting to be part of the conversation.

 Stuart takes a swig and hands it to you.

>SAVE
>cf9
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>drink flask
 You can't see any such thing.

>take bottle
 Taken.

>drink it

 You take a small mouthful, swallow it quickly. You pinch your nose and
 squeeze your eyes shut for a second, then pass on the bottle to Dave.

 "So I was like, 'Jackson -- just go in and get it,'" Stuart says. "You
 dress like someone's dad, they'll never ask you for ID.' But he
 wouldn't, so we had to wait for some rocker to come along who'd buy for
 us."

 Dave takes two swigs and hands it to Jackson, who hands it to Stuart.
 "Even Hardcore here is drinking, guy," Stu says with a smirk, handing
 the bottle to you. You swig and pass it on.

 "You remember what happened the last time," Jackson says. "I want to
 actually get into the dance this time. Pannus has still got me in
 detention from last year!"

 "Well, I mean, you puked in front of him," Dave says with a rare smile.
 "We're lucky we went in before you."

 Stuart is snickering. "You were so fucked that night. The only thing
 that sucked about it was that you had a chance to puke on Penis and you
 puked on your own shoes. That's a shame."


 "Well," Jackson says, "They're obviously going to be watching me
 tonight, and I want to get into the dance."

 "So you can show off all your skanking skills when they play One Step
 Beyond?" says Stuart, getting to his feet and mock-dancing.

 Jackson laughs, watching Stuart's scowling dance moves.

 "Ah, it's going to suck anyway. They always do," says Dave, passing the
 bottle to Stuart. "The last time we missed the only Cult song they
 played."

 "That's why we should have got the stuff faster," says Stuart over the
 bottle. "We would have gotten in with the first rush of people and no
 one would notice we were drunk."

 "Yeah, it's not like we stick out or anything," Jackson says dryly.
 "Besides, who was the one who was a half-hour late getting to my place
 tonight?"

 You take another swig. It's not getting any less vile, but it's almost
 finished.

 "How hard is it to go into a store and buy something?" says Stuart.


 "You're almost a year older than me. You're sixteen," Jackson says.

 You're a bit nervous with the mention of age, since you're thirteen.

 Rolling his eyes, Stuart takes the bottle from Dave and finishes it
 off. "It doesn't have anything to do with that. With my innocent young
 face, I couldn't buy milk past the due date."

 "OK, let's go," Jackson says, getting to his feet and pulling out some
 gum. He hands everyone one piece, which you start to chew. Blueberry.

 As you get up, you notice a little dizziness. Everyone heads west,
 taking careful steps, and as you pass the portables Stuart whips the
 empty bottle into the night and cocks an ear.

 When there's no smash he frowns. "Damn. Missed the sign.".

 You enter the school and walk through the caf. The sudden bright lights
 intensify your dizziness into a nausea.

 The ticket table is set up just outside the gym door, beside the
 stairwell. The sudden stop in front of it brings up bile. The senior,
 who's taken Jackson's ticket and let him go, looks at you guardedly.
 Then he tells you to wait.

 A moment later, Mr. Collins, the gym teacher appears. He's got a hockey
 stick over his shoulder and a smarmy grin on his face.

 "What have you boys been up to tonight," he says, tapping at your
 mohawk with the flat of his stick. "Other than hairdressing?"

 The know-it-all attitude sets off an explosion of rage -- and,
 unfortunately, also detonates an acid ball in your stomach. You're
 going to be sick.

 Cafeteria
 While you know that the cafeteria is its same old dingy self, your
 brain is telling you that it's spinning and painfully bright.

 Mr. Collins, the obnoxious overgrown jock of a gym teacher, stands
 beside two of his apes behind the ticket table set up for the dance.
 He's grinning in a nauseatingly infuriating way. God, you feel ill.

>drink alcohol
 You can't see any such thing.

>swallow vomit
 You can't see any such thing.

>breathe
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sit
 (on top of the Mr. Collins)
 That's not something you can sit down on.

 You vomit all over the floor. "Waste of a good puke..." murmurs Stu.

 Collins's smirk twitches with disgust, but before he can get his
 condescending hands on you, you flip the ticket table over.

 The cash box makes a terribly satisfying clatter.

 The next couple of minutes are a bit of a blur -- making a break;
 seeing Stu and Dave's escaping backs as you lean over to excise the
 last bit of liquid from your stomach lining; being carried back to the
 school by two big lugs who you flail alternately with screams about
 your inalienable rights as an individual and kicks to their groins; a
 second break, which similarly ends with you passed out in the field;
 and finally, incarceration in...

 Science Classroom (on the worktable)

 This is a room full of massive black worktables, each of them with
 their own sinks. An even larger demonstration table squats at the front
 of the room. It's weird to see the moon shining through the window
 you're so accustomed to staring out of during the day. There's an exit
 to the south.

 You can see a chart of the table of elements here.

 You wake groggily -- sober enough to be conscious, and still drunk
 enough to want to fuck shit up.

>undo
 Cafeteria
 [Previous turn undone.]

>puke on collins
 You slap your hands on the ticket table and vomit all over Collins and
 his thugs. It feels you're breathing liquid fire on them, although it
 looks more like the pasta you had for dinner. "Yes!" Stuart hoots,
 pumping his fist.

 [You get five punk points for that.]

 Collins' smirk twitches with disgust, but before he can get his
 condescending hands on you, you flip the ticket table over.

>read about science in zine
 "We discovered that several schools have removed this lesson from the
 curriculum. Since we at Virus have found it useful, we've decided to
 return it." Beneath it reads...

 "EXPERIMENT 4
 Synthesis of an Explosive: N13*NH3

 Many explosive molecules have nitrogen as one of the elemental
 components. Nitrogen single bonds to most atoms are quite weak, while
 the nitrogen - nitrogen triple bond is exceptionally stable (NH3 is an
 exception, in that its N-H single bonds are fairly stable). Energy
 liberated by the breaking of single nitrogen bonds can be substantial.

 Nitrogen - halogen single bonds are particularly reactive due to
 repulsion between the nitrogen and halide lone pairs. In this
 experiment you will make ammonium triiodide NI3, isolated as an
 ammoniate coordination complex. This compound, when dry, is a
 detonating explosive that is shock-sensitive. It can be handled when
 wet, but will explode unpredictably when dry.

 APPARATUS

 Basic glassware including 10-mL beaker, 2-mL pipette, glass rod are
 required for this experiment.

 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

 The product of this experiment is a shock-sensitive explosive when dry.
 The small amount prepared according to the procedure below is not
 dangerous, but larger amounts are serious explosion risks. Never scale
 up this procedure!"

 (At this point, the editors of Virus have handwritten: HA HA!)

 PROCEDURE

 Weigh 100mg (0.100 g) of iodine into a 10-mL beaker. Slowly add 2.0 mL
 of concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution. Stir the mixture for 5
 minutes -- a red precipitate should form. Transfer the moist
 precipitate onto several layers of filter paper placed on the floor of
 the fumehood, away from any breakable objects. Spread out the solid and
 permit it to dry for one hour.

 While you are waiting, answer the questions provided in the laboratory.
 These are to be handed in before you leave the laboratory."

 (At this point, the editors have handwritten: SURE TEACH, RIGHT AFTER I
 FINISH BLOWING UP THE SCHOOL!)

 "When the sample has dried, carefully tap it with the end of a
 yardstick, keeping as far away as possible. No other characterization
 is required, or advisable."

>go west
 You clamber up to the window...

 Science Classroom

 This is a room full of massive black worktables, each of them with
 their own sinks. An even larger demonstration table squats at the front
 of the room. It's weird to see the moon shining through the window
 you're so accustomed to staring out of during the day. There's an exit
 to the south.

 You can see a storage cupboard (in which are a left compartment (which
 is closed) and a right compartment (which is closed)) here.

>examine left compartment
 A 10-mL beaker, 2-mL pipette, a glass rod and what looks to be a
 fist-sized diamond are clearly visible through the glass.

 An astonishing array of alphabetically arranged chemicals and
 solutions.

 Well, naturally, they've locked you in.

 You put the iodine into the bottle.

 You clamber out the window and cautiously climb down the trellis...

 Track and Field
 A track rings the large multi-purpose field, and trees ring the track.
 The school looms to the west, its window eyes silently judging the
 players. This is where boys become men, where the raw ore of youth is
 pounded into iron, where the limits of the body and spirit are tested.

 Where the jocks frolic, in other words.

 The halfmoon seems to have a sickly glow, but that might be your nausea
 talking.

>go north

 The Portables
 These one-room portables are meant to be temporary but these battered
 aluminium boxes look older than the school itself. Ugly things, but
 they do serve nicely to obscure the activities of the Path from prying
 eyes in the school. You can venture south to the field or enter the
 playground by going west.

 The halfmoon seems to have a sickly glow, but that might be your nausea
 talking.

>go west

 The Playground
 The asphalt is painted with various arcane white lines which you assume
 are used in playing something, but you've never seen anyone doing
 anything but shooting hoops here. The side door to the school cafeteria
 is propped open to the west, the portables squat to the east, or you
 can go AWOL and head north.

 The halfmoon seems to have a sickly glow, but that might be your nausea
 talking.

>go north

 Beginning of Lane
 This is the road that heads north to the outside world and south back
 to the school. At the end of the school day it's choked with escaping
 boys, but now it's completely featureless.

 Beside the lane is a rather large concrete sign, with a cross on one
 side and an empty pedestal on the other.

 The halfmoon seems to have a sickly glow, but that might be your nausea
 talking.

>pedestal
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine pedestal
 It's a concrete block with holes drilled in it, presumably for securing
 something to.

 Your liquor-addled brain seems to recall that the secretary said the
 statue would be reinstalled tomorrow. "Popey's comin' home," you mumble
 to yourself.

>pour mixture on pedestal
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a container of ammonium hydroxide
   a bottle (which is closed)
     a precipitate
   a dance ticket
   some Doc Martens boots (being worn)
   a zine
   your middle finger

>pour precipitate on pedestal
 The bottle isn't open.

>open bottle
 You open the bottle.

>pour precipitate on pedestal
 The precipitate can't contain things.

>put precipitate on pedestal

 After the reddish substance glugs out of the bottle and onto the
 pedestal, you spread it out with the flat edge of the bottle.

 [You get 20 punk points for that.]

 Satisfied with your night's work, you toss the bottle and head off for
 home.

 The following Monday, you note the blackened pedestal with
 satisfaction, and the Path is abuzz with the mystery. "I saw it in the
 office," Stuart was saying gleefully. "Only the head is left, the rest
 of the statue is totally trashed. They had a crane lower it and then
 BOOM!"

 "You think someone blew up the Pope?" says one of the older boys. "Naw.
 You'd need a remote control or something. They probably just dropped
 it."

 "Actually, you wouldn't need a remote," you say. "If you spread a large
 enough quantity of, say, ammonium triiodide and let it dry..." you say,
 trailing off. When you notice you have everyone's attention, you grin.
 "That's just hypothetical, of course."


     *** You have won ***


 In that game you scored 45 out of a possible 50, in 307 turns, which
 gives you the rank of Old School.

 With your love of explosions, it's only a matter of time before you
 convince Stuart and Jackson to join you to form an incredibly noisy
 punk band. The Papacidal Maniacs didn't win the school battle of the
 bands (Penis introduced you as the Pepto-Bismol Maniacs, but he later
 had cause to regret it) but you got a gig downtown before you split up.

 Years later your friend's band, Fuck You Mr. Man, suddenly needs a
 replacement for their pregnant bassist, so you blow off Christmas exams
 and go on tour. Somewhere between Saskatoon and Calgary your friend
 becomes more than a friend and you never come back. The Vancouver
 drunkpunk house you start together becomes mythic.

 The Office
 The office is quiet and orderly, with a large counter separating the
 office proper from the visitors. Two doors against the far wall are,
 according to the signs, the lairs of Brother Matthews and Mr. Pannus,
 and sandwiched between them is a massive painting of Pope Innocent III.

 On the counter are some slips.

 Although she's keying information into the computer, the secretary's
 huge glasses make it impossible to tell if she's looking at you.

 Everyone's staring at you. Drink or give it to someone else.

>give bottle to stu

 You try to pass it on. Stu grabs the bottle and gives it back to you.
 "Drink up, H.C."

 You make a face.

 "I don't believe that the guy who's been bumming smokes from me all
 week won't have a drink with me!"

>give bottle to stu
 You ignore Stu's scowl and pass it on.

 "So I was like, 'Jackson -- just go in and get it,'" Stuart says. "You
 dress like someone's dad, they'll never ask you for ID.' But he
 wouldn't. so we had to wait for some rocker to come along who'd buy for
 us."

 Dave takes two swigs and hands it to Jackson, who passes it of to
 Stuart. "C'mon guy," Stu says, "Show Hardcore here how it's done."

 "You remember what happened the last time," Jackson says. "I want to
 actually get into the dance this time. Penis has still got me in
 detention from last year!"

 "Well, I mean, you puked in front of him," Dave says with a rare smile.
 "We're lucky we went in before you."

 Stuart is snickering. "You were so fucked that night. The only thing
 that sucked about it was that you had a chance to puke on Penis and you
 puked on your own shoes. That's a shame."

 "Well," Jackson says, "They're obviously going to be watching me
 tonight, and I want to get into the dance."



 "So you can show off all your skanking skills when they play One Step
 Beyond?" says Stuart, getting to his feet and mock-dancing.

 Jackson laughs, watching Stuart's scowling dance moves.

 "Ah, it's going to blow anyway," says Dave, passing the bottle to
 Stuart. "The last time we missed the only Cult song they played."

 "That's why we should have got the stuff faster," says Stuart over the
 bottle. "We would have gotten in with the first rush of people and no
 one would notice we were drunk."

 "Yeah, it's not like we stick out or anything," Jackson says dryly.
 "Besides, who was the one who was a half-hour late getting to my place
 tonight?"

 "How hard is it to go into a store and buy something?" says Stuart.

 "You're almost a year older than me. You're sixteen," Jackson says.

 You're a bit nervous with the mention of age, since you're thirteen.

 Rolling his eyes, Stuart takes the bottle from Dave and finishes it
 off. "It doesn't have anything to do with that. With my innocent young
 face, I couldn't buy milk past the due date."

 "OK, let's go," Jackson says, getting to his feet and pulling out some
 gum. He hands everyone one piece, which you start to chew. Blueberry.

 Everyone heads west, taking careful steps, and as you pass the
 portables Stuart whips the empty bottle into the night. A second or two
 later there's a distant, but still tremendously satisfying, smash.

 You enter the school, Stu crowing and pumping his fist, until you get
 to the side of the walk through the caf to where they've set up the
 ticket table.

 You and Jackson get in with your tickets but Stuart and Dave are
 stopped at the door.

 As you enter the stairwell area, you hear a crash from the caf. Mr.
 Collins, hockey stick in hand, rushes past you.

 Jackson gives you a raised eyebrow and heads down the stairs. You
 follow him to...

 School Gymnasium Pretending To Be A Dance Hall
 All the disco balls in the world can't hide the fact that this is a
 school gym with the lights off. They've hung streamers from the
 basketball nets and two gigantic speakers flank the DJ's table on the
 stage. The washroom is to the south and you can leave up the stairs to
 the east. The student council has done a half-assed job of decorating
 the walls with construction paper leaves, footballs and Peanuts
 characters, but what's leaning against the walls is far more
 interesting: shy clumps of girls. Your heart speeds up to match the
 diamonds of light that sweep the floor, which has a few dancers on it.

>examine girls
 They're little more than silhouettes, but they certainly are female.

 Jackson goes straight up to the DJ and makes some requests. He comes
 back and says something inaudible and gives you the thumbs-up. You
 smile back.

>dance
 You move around a bit, but without decent music you can't really get
 into it.

>listen to music
 You can't see any such thing.

>dance with girls
 I only understood you as far as wanting to dance.

>ask girl about dance

>talk to girls

>ask girls about dance
 Sure, you'd like to talk to the girls... but even if the music was low
 enough, there would still be the paralyzing fear issue.

>ask jackson about music
 The music's really too loud for conversation.

 The DJ plays some rap that you don't know. Jackson leans back against
 the wall and crosses his arms, and you do the same.

>examine dj
 The DJ is way too into it, his eyes closed and head bobbing.
 Thankfully, he doesn't seem to be addicted to the mike.

>examine jackson
 He's got his white Fred Perry shirt on and pressed trouserpipe pants
 for the dance.

 Billy Idol comes on. For some reason, the crowd chants "Get Laid, Get
 Fucked" at the chorus -- naturally, so do you, as abstract as those
 concepts are to you.

>wait
 Time passes.

>dance
 You move around a bit, but without decent music you can't really get
 into it.

 Synthesizer music starts up, attracting preps like flies.

>dance
 You move around a bit, but without decent music you can't really get
 into it.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The Clash's "Should I Stay or Should I Go" starts up. Jackson starts
 dancing, an intense little hopping coupled with a mouthing of the words
 that shows his lyrical knowledge.

>dance

 Watching Jackson, you slowly start moving -- swaying first, and then
 stepping back and forth, getting closer to the other dancers. Jackson
 playfully knocks into you, and you start to really get into it, closing
 your eyes and bouncing around and off Jackson. When the song finishes
 you're sweaty and exhilarated and amazed that no one is pointing and
 laughing.

 [You got 5 punk points for that.]

 After the song, a guy and a girl come up to you. The guy starts talking
 to Jackson, or rather, shouting over the music. He seems to know him.

>examine girl
>ask dj about vicious

 The girl has really short hair except for her bangs. She's wearing a
 black leather jacket and a laced up skirt.

 Smiling, perhaps, at the attention you're giving her, she shouts
 something. You shake your head and cup your ear. She tries again, and
 then just points at the exit. Seeing Jackson and the guy were somehow
 communicating -- mostly with hand signals -- you go upstairs.

 "I like how you dance," she says, walking up the stairs. In the sudden
 light, you can see that she has way too much makeup and that her legs
 are a little thick. "You can tell a lot about a person by how they
 dance."

 You nod, dumbly.

 "So you go here?" she says, looking around and noticing the gym
 teacher, standing in front of the stairs.

 "Yeah, it sucks," you mumble, stunned at your eloquence.

 "They're fucking fascists at my school too," she said, staring daggers
 at Collins. "But they're stupid..."

 She raises her voice. "I can't believe he was making the sign of Satan
 during that song! I mean, in a Catholic school!" she says, her voice
 echoing in the stairwell.

 Collins blinks, folds his arms, unfolds them, and finally heads
 downstairs.

 "I'm Kim," she says, watching him go. "Spelled like gym."

 You shake her hand admiringly.

 "Let's explore," she says, heading upstairs. You follow her.

 The office is dark except for the glow of the computer monitor. Kym
 moves towards it immediately, pushing through the little swinging door
 in the counter -- it nearly snaps shut on its spring, but you catch it
 in time.

 "Sorry," she whispers, sitting down in front of the screen. "Wow, an

 up. She tries a few: Jesus, God, Pope.

 "Denied. Damn," she says.

 little involuntarily at the contact, and she notices.

 She looks at you for a second. "You're not so tough when you smile..."

>kiss kym
 You lean in towards her, noticing how the letters from the computer
 screen reflect in her eyes before she closes them. A dry kiss, and then
 a not-so-dry one, and then her tongue is in your mouth. You slide your
 hand down the back of her shaved head and onto her studded collar as
 she slides her hand up your leg. You grip her collar and gasp as she
 slides her hand across your crotch and down the other leg.

 She smiles at you and bites her lip. "Wanna?"

 She shrugs. "Yeah, me neither," she  says, sitting at the computer.

 She turns back to the screen and starts looking through the school

 screen reflect in her eyes before she closes them. A dry kiss, and then
 a not-so-dry one, and then her tongue is in your mouth. You slide your
 hand down the back of her shaved head and onto her studded collar as
 she slides her hand up your leg. You grip her collar and gasp as she
 slides her hand across your crotch and down the other leg.

 She smiles at you and bites her lip. "Wanna?"

>yes
 You nod, not sure exactly what she has planned but not really fussy,
 either. She moves the chairs enough so she can lie down behind the
 secretary's desk. Her face is suddenly serious, and young, and then she
 pulls up her skirt. You take off your pants, thanking god that the dark
 hid the baby blue of your underwear, and lie down beside her.

 When you're fucking, you think about how you can hear the music from
 downstairs, that you're a few inches away from Pannus' office, that it
 feels really different than jacking off, that neither of you have
 moaned in a few minutes.

 So you pull out and yank your pants up over your still-hard cock. She
 gets her panties from under one of the desks and dresses. "Thanks," you
 say, aware of the sub-porn quality of what just happened, but not
 wanting her to feel bad.

 She shrugs, and moves the chair back to the computer. "I don't know
 what the big fuss is about," she says, sitting down.

 She turns back to the screen and starts looking through the school
 records. "Oh, man, there's some good stuff here... teacher's
 salaries... wow, the entire annual budget?"

 She pulls a small skull-festooned notebook out of her jacket pocket and
 starts writing things down. "Fuck, I can barely see..."

>examine computer

 The school's '84 budget allowed for the purchasing of the creme de la
 creme of computing: they're called XTs. You don't know much about high
 tech beyond Pac Man, but you're pretty sure that's a 5.25" disk drive.

>examine notebook
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask kym about budget

 "Do you think I know everything?" Kym cracks.

 The Office
 The office is quiet and orderly, with a large counter separating the
 office proper from the visitors. Two doors against the far wall are,
 according to the signs, the lairs of Brother Matthews and Mr. Pannus,
 and sandwiched between them is a massive painting of Pope Innocent III.

 Kym's trying to jot down all the juicy information, but there's too
 much of it.

 The half-power night florescents gives your surroundings an eerie cast.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>go southwest
 You can't go that way.

>open door
 That's not something you can open.

>examine doors
 You expect that the principal and vice-principal having offices here
 has something to do with how quiet it is.

>look in doors
 You find nothing of interest.

 It's a counter that separates the wheat from the chaff.

>look behind counter
 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

>enter office
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

 You find nothing of interest.

 The computer is empty.

 Second Floor, West
 There's a prominently displayed trophy case and rows and rows of
 official looking plaques to impress parents on their way south to the
 office. The hallway continues east, and north is the way back outside.

 Second Floor, East
 The science lab is to the north and stairs lead up and down. Grey
 lockers line the walls, as do doors to various classrooms.

>go up

 Third Floor, East
 This is as high as this high school gets. You can go back down, south
 to the library, or you can follow the hallway west. Lockers and
 classroom doors line the walls.

>go west

 Third Floor, West
 This is the most remote part of the school, and so naturally your
 locker is here. For added fun, the detention room is directly north --
 its deadly silences punctuated by barked orders and sobs ensure that
 you visit your locker as infrequently as possible.

 The half-power night florescents gives your surroundings an eerie cast.

>open locker
 You've got a bunch of textbooks stacked on one shelf and nothing else.
 You've been meaning to bring some posters (at least to put up over that
 KISS scratched in the paint and the 680 CFTR sticker) but you keep
 forgetting.

>look in locker
 In your locker are some textbooks.

>examine textbooks
 There's your science textbook, an English reader, and a French
 textbook. None of which you want to even look at after class, thanks
 very much.

 Wedged behind them is a 5.25" floppy disk.

>get disk
 Taken.

>give disk to kym
 "Rad!" Kym says. "Put it in the computer!"

>put disk in computer

 [You got 15 punk points for that.]

 "Brilliant!" she exclaims, stuffing her notebook away and closing the
 disk drive. "This is gonna be the best Virus ever!"

 You try to remember why that sounds familiar, and then pull out your
 well-worn copy of the zine. "You did this?"

 She looks at it, obviously pleased that you have it. "Yup. Well, me and
 my friend Leo -- I do most of the work, though."

 She stares at the screen. "I wonder how people are going to feel about
 the fact that the combined budgets of the art and the music departments
 are one third of the rugby team's?" She taps some keys and the disk
 drive grinds and glows red.

     *** You have won ***


 In that game you scored 40 out of a possible 50, in 327 turns, which
 gives you the rank of Old School.

 Eventually, you become a co-editor of Virus, and when Pannus discovers
 this he tries to get you expelled. But the impassioned rant you publish
 and distribute to the school at large -- arguing that Thou Shalt Not
 Lie demanded the honest journalism found in publications like Virus,
 and pointing out that the original meaning of "catholic" was "tolerant"
 -- finds its supporters in the administration, and you're just
 suspended.

 After graduation, you and Kym and your son get a place downtown. It's
 close to the market and Anthony's daycare. You get a well-paying
 government job and Kym volunteers as an intern at a left-wing magazine.
