 The people have always gathered on moonless nights to hear the
 telling, since the time of your ancestors' ancestors. The heat of the
 fire and the glow in the storyteller's eyes make the past present, and
 the path to the future clear. Tonight the stars are bright, but the
 minds of your people are troubled. May the words of the telling guide
 your way.

 -----------

 The walls of your tent glow yellow in the lamplight, your simple
 possessions casting flickering shadows on the wall. A straw bed; some
 skins of water, oil, and wine; a small, guttering lamp--it is simple,
 but it is enough.

 The symbol of your occupation hangs from the central support of the
 tent.

>examine symbol


 Which do you mean, the medicine bag or the copper dagger?

>dagger


 This copper dagger is as long as your forearm, with a round pommel and
 hardened leather grip.

>take dagger


 You carefully take your weapon down from the wall and study it
 thoughtfully for a moment.

>examine dagger


 Your dagger fits snugly in your hand, the copper blade as long as your
 forearm. You have knives and spears for other work, but this dagger is
 different. It is your prized possession; a talisman against times of
 woe, and though it has been long since you wielded it in war, your
 muscles still remember the way to use it.

>look


 The walls of your tent glow yellow in the lamplight, your simple
 possessions casting flickering shadows on the wall. A straw bed; some
 skins of water, oil, and wine; a small, guttering lamp--it is simple,
 but it is enough.

 Your lover's medicine bag hangs from the central support of the tent.

>examine bag


 Your lover's medicine bag is like a tiny garden, filled with dried
 herbs wrapped in leaves and small clay vials. Many lives have been
 saved with the power in these small things, and, of course, with
 skill.

>take bag


 You lift your lover's medicine bag down from its place, handling it
 carefully.

 Lowered voices speak softly from somewhere outside your tent.

>out


 You step outside into the warm night air.

 It has been night for many hours, but the air is still warm, and the
 stars are a million brilliant fires above you. Nearby are the vague
 outlines of your neighbors' tents, but on this moonless night only the
 distant glow of the fire pit seems truly alive.

 In the darkness a few feet away, Sihan and Saiph talk quietly in
 strained tones.

 As you approach, your enemy grows silent. Your love turns to you with
 a look of relief and reaches out a hand.

>give bag to lover


 Who do you mean, Sihan or Saiph?

 You are a warrior, nothing more. These have always been your people,
 and you have always been theirs.

 You are carrying your lover's medicine bag, your copper dagger and the
 storyteller's feathered circlet.

>give bag to Sihan


 It seems now is not a good time for that; your enemy is watching you
 narrowly while your lover holds out a hand to you.

 Sihan and Saiph watch you expectantly.

>give bag to Sihan


 It seems now is not a good time for that; your enemy is watching you

>examine enemy


 What it was that first made an enemy out of a dear friend you cannot
 recall, but it has been many years now since smiles passed between
 you.

>listen


 A bat circles above the fire for a moment, then swoops away.

>greet


 You'll have to specify whom you wish to greet.

>greet Saiph


 You clasp Saiph's strong hand and turn to Sihan with a frown.

 "What business have you here?" you ask her coldly.

 Sihan tosses her hair and fixes her sharp gaze on you. "I came to see
 if Saiph has sense left in his head after a season with you," she says
 levelly. "But I see that, like you, he would lead our people down the
 path of needless killing. I have no more to say." She turns and
 vanishes into the darkness without a sound.

>greet Sihan


 You clasp Sihan's soft hand and turn to Saiph with a frown.

 "What business have you here?" you ask him coldly.

 Saiph stares down at you with distaste. "I came to see if Sihan has
 sense left in her head after a season with you," he says levelly. "But
 I see that, like you, she would lead our people down the path of
 needless killing. I have no more to say." He turns and strides
 fiercely into the darkness.

>enemy


 "Saiph talks endlessly, but words cannot sharpen axes or protect
 children," your love says. "He is convinced still that these newcomers
 mean us no harm. What will it take for him to wake up to the truth?"

 Sihan sighs. "He still hopes for peace with the NEWCOMERS," your lover
 says, "and was upset to find I do not share his views. We shall see if
 your enemy has better luck at the TELLING." She looks up to the stars,
 and adds, "It is a good NIGHT for it."

>examine stars


 The stars glimmer in the warm night air, casting a pale light over the
 valley.



 "Have you heard the news?" she asks. "Young Ada found traces of a camp
 less than an hour's walk from here, and more than half a day from
 their FIRES in the valley. Saiph maintains they were merely
 investigating our camp. Many, perhaps, would call it spying instead,"
 she says darkly.



 "The moon has waxed and grown small again since they arrived," Sihan
 murmurs, holding you tightly. "Why don't they come to us? Why do they
 hide when we send our emissaries? They must know the unrest they're
 causing in us."



 Sihan points up at the night sky. "See how bright the stars are," she
 says, "as if the gods themselves gather round our fire to hear the
 teller's story."



 "It is almost time," your love says seriously. "I wonder, what story
 will we hear tonight? The people are buzzing about the newcomers;
 perhaps the teller's story will be about them."



 Your people do not stay in one place from birth to death like the
 people of the city, nor are you always wandering, like the people of
 the desert; you find a peaceful spot and stay there till the animals
 move on or the stream dries up. These are their homes; they are all
 you need.

 Sihan glances towards the fire pit and takes her medicine bag from
 you, slinging it into its familiar place around her neck. "Let us join
 the gathering and hear the story," your love says lightly, and turns
 to the FIRE at the center of the village.



 You walk to the firepit with Sihan, and friends and neighbors greet
 you with a nod or quiet word.

 Always the fire pit is the center of the village, and always the
 people gather there. Faint smells of tonight's great feast still
 linger, but the fire now smolders low, only a shadow of its roaring
 fierceness at sunset.

 Nabu and Isi stand near the fire, along with a growing crowd. Sihan
 stands near your side.



 A genuine smile fills your face as you greet some friends. There is
 little news other than that of the newcomers, but it is good to see
 their faces, nonetheless.



 "My brightest light," says Isi as she always does, a smile lighting
 her face as she pulls you down to kiss your cheek.



 Your uncle Nabu regards you seriously. "Are you ready to fight for
 your people, should you be called upon?" he asks.

 "Perhaps it will not come to fighting," you say.

 "Who can tell?" he says, "But those who bear arms must be prepared,
 nonetheless."

 Sihan places a hand on your shoulder. "Go on, my love," she says
 softly. "Give the circlet of office to the STORYTELLER. It is time."



 "The storyteller awaits," Sihan says. "The telling cannot begin until
 the teller's circlet has been gifted."



 Sihan spent countless weeks collecting the delicate feathers and
 weaving them together to make this circlet. It is light as air in your
 hands, and seems to glow in the firelight.



 You approach your aunt Isi and hand the circlet to the white-haired
 old woman. She takes it delicately, eyeing the craftsmanship, and then
 turns to Sihan with a nod and a warm smile. Carefully, she lifts it up
 to her old head--and now before you is no longer your father's sister,
 but the storyteller... a role she has taken every new moon for many
 years.



 "How is your knee?" you ask your uncle gently.

 He rubs it with a rueful smile. "It aches tonight," he says, looking
 to the stars. "Rain is coming, despite appearances. A heavy rain."

 Saiph approaches the far side of the fire and greets some friends
 warmly.



 "Will you and your cronies hear tonight's story, Saiph?" you call
 across the fire. "Or will you be too busy weaving flower garlands for
 the newcomer attack force?"

 Saiph stares at you with dagger eyes. "Your taunts only reveal your
 immaturity," he says. "Do not trouble me with more of them."

 Sihan kisses your cheek. "May the story bring you what you seek," she
 whispers, then slips into the crowd. Your beloved has always liked to
 hear the stories by herself.



 He is not nearby.



 He is not nearby.



 A log falls in the fire, sending a shower of sparks up into the night.

 The murmurings of the people die away as the storyteller rises to her
 feet and raises two bony hands.



 She is not nearby.



 It is strangely quiet around the fire.

 The storyteller shouts, "In this time of darkness the people gather
 for the telling. Will the people hear?"



 You call out your response along with many others.

 The crowd cries out with one voice, "The people are ready." The teller
 bows humbly, accepting the people's blessing, then straightens with
 the hint of a smile.

 "Tonight," she says, "we shall hear an old, old story, from days long
 ago when great cities and mighty kings ruled this land. May you find
 in the story that which you seek."



 She is not nearby.



 A bat circles above the fire for a moment, then swoops away.

 The storyteller lifts her hands in invocation. "Our story begins," she
 says quietly, "in the far-off city of URUK. Uruk of the broad streets,
 Uruk of the mighty WALLS. Can you see them, gleaming in the desert
 heat?"

 The teller gestures into the night, and in your mind the walls come
 alive, shimmering in the desert air.

 "Come," she continues, "cross the ancient threshold, walk the streets
 and orchards and markets. Walk the streets and climb the great stone
 steps to the TEMPLE. Climb the steps and find the box of burnished
 copper. Find the box and undo the lock and draw out the great TABLET
 of deep blue stone. Draw out the tablet and read of Uruk's king,
 Uruk's pride, Uruk's greatest hero. Hear of the trials of GILGAMESH."



 "How high were the walls of Uruk?" you ask.

 "As high as ten men," the storyteller replies, "and made of the finest
 brickwork both inside and outside. GILGAMESH built them, a work no
 later king could match, to defend the people of URUK from her foes.
 From their top the whole city is laid out below you, only the TEMPLE
 still above."

 Saiph glowers at you from across the flames.



 He is not nearby.



 "From where came this tablet of bluest stone?" you ask.

 "GILGAMESH carved it," the teller says, "cut his words deep into the
 tablet of lapis lazuli, bluest of blues. Wise Gilgamesh carved all his
 exploits and knowledge into the tablets, and hid them under the
 cornerstone of URUK, so men would remember his deeds long after he
 went to the underworld. But," the teller adds, "that was long after
 the story we shall hear tonight."

>Uruk


 Your mouth is already open to respond when Saiph's voice booms across
 the circle.

 "Is this a well-chosen tale?" Saiph calls out darkly. "Should we hear
 stories of battle and war when they lie on our very doorstep?"

 The crowd looks hesitantly between Saiph and the storyteller, who
 regards your enemy with inscrutable eyes. "Stories are not all of far
 off places and distant times," she says softly. "The world tells us
 stories every day, and the wise pay heed. Gilgamesh may teach us much
 tonight, if we have the ears to hear." Saiph bows stiffly, accepting
 the storyteller's decision.

>Uruk


 "Tell more of the city of Uruk," you ask.

 "Uruk, mighty Uruk of the wide streets," the teller says with shining
 eyes, "its heart the temple of Inanna, towering over all; its skin
 mighty walls of oven-fired brick, their like unmatched in all the
 world. Uruk, planned by the seven sages and filled with orchards and
 gardens. Never was a city more mighty and proud than Uruk, and never
 had any city so great a king."

 The teller continues. "MIGHTY was Gilgamesh, a lord among lords.
 Mighty is he who both leads the way and guards the rear. Mighty is he
 who both crashes like a wave and shelters the weak. Gilgamesh was
 tall, strong, bearded, a roaring bull among his people. ARURU, mother
 of the Earth, gave him his form, and ADAD the Storm gave him courage,
 and SHAMASH the Sun gave him beauty--but," the teller's piercing eyes
 fixate on the crowd, "he was still a MAN, nonetheless."

>man


 Gilgamesh had something of the GODS in him, it seems, but also
 something of MEN. Which, you wonder, shaped him more?

>listen


 A log falls in the fire, sending a shower of sparks up into the night.

 "Please tell us more of Lady Aruru," a timid little girl asks.

 "Lady Aruru," the teller sighs, "Lady of the Gods, Lady of the
 Foothills, Mother of the Earth, made Gilgamesh as she made the first
 man long eons ago. She formed an image of Gilgamesh in her mind, took
 up her clay, and kneaded it, shaped it into Gilgamesh's form. More
 MIGHTY she made him than a normal man: taller, broader, and stronger."

>men


 "With so many gods to shape him, how is it that Gilgamesh was only a
 man?" you ask.

 "The gods did shape him," the storyteller replies with a nod, "but
 gave him no godly powers: no magic touch, or gift of foresight, or
 long, ageless life. Gilgamesh shared the fate of all mankind, and this
 was why long after many of the old gods fell and were forgotten, the
 people of Uruk remembered him, for he was one of them."

 A voice somewhere behind you calls, "It is true!" and a majority nod
 their heads in agreement.

>listen


 A bat circles above the fire for a moment, then swoops away.

 The telling continues. "With his friend and companion ENKIDU," the
 storyteller says, "Gilgamesh ruled Uruk with a young and prideful
 heart. But he saw the DEAD and dying in the streets of Uruk, and his
 mind was TROUBLED."

>Adad


 The time is not right to weave that into the story.

 "It was BATTLE that united Enkidu and Gilgamesh in friendship, was it
 not?" Saiph says musingly.

 "It is often the way," the teller says, "that two foes may only find
 KINSHIP through the bitterest battles. But perhaps," she adds humbly,
 "this is only the way in stories."

>battle


 "How did Enkidu challenge Gilgamesh?" you wonder aloud.

 "ENKIDU heard how Gilgamesh took the young men from their fathers and
 the young women from their mothers, and he grew angry," says the
 storyteller. "Enkidu grew angry and came to the city of Uruk, when he
 had never before entered a city of man. Enkidu entered the city and
 sought out Gilgamesh, and they fought. Walls shook; people cowered;
 the cobblestones cracked as they wrestled through the streets.
 Gilgamesh was the victor, but so awed was he by Enkidu's strength that
 he lifted him to his feet and made a bond of friendship that would
 never break."

>trouble


 You WONDER, was Gilgamesh a FOOL to be so troubled by distant death?

>listen


 A log falls in the fire, sending a shower of sparks up into the night.

 The storyteller continues. "One night," she says, "as Gilgamesh knelt
 in prayer, SHAMASH, god of the sun, came down to whisper in his ear.
 Shamash WHISPERED to Gilgamesh of a far off place called the Cedar
 Forest, where dwelt the demon HUMBABA. Shamash whispered that he who
 could defeat Humbaba would gain fame greater than any man. He who
 could chop down the tallest CEDAR and defeat Humbaba the guardian
 would gain everlasting fame. He would burn in the minds of men
 forever. He would never be forgotten. And the heart of Gilgamesh
 became RESTLESS."

 [Previous turn undone.]

>dead


 "Why were there so many dead in the streets of Uruk?" you wonder.

 "No special reason," says the teller, "other than that which must one
 day take us all. In the cities things are different than here, or so
 my father told me: the people there are so many that every day there
 is death; every day a birth; every day a wedding or a feast or a piece
 of intriguing news."

 The storyteller continues. "One night," she says, "as Gilgamesh knelt
 in prayer, SHAMASH, god of the sun, came down to whisper in his ear.
 Shamash WHISPERED to Gilgamesh of a far off place called the Cedar
 Forest, where dwelt the demon HUMBABA. Shamash whispered that he who
 could defeat Humbaba would gain fame greater than any man. He who
 could chop down the tallest CEDAR and defeat Humbaba the guardian
 would gain everlasting fame. He would burn in the minds of men
 forever. He would never be forgotten. And the heart of Gilgamesh
 became RESTLESS."

>Cedar


 Your mouth is already open to respond when Saiph's voice booms across
 the circle.

 "Tell me," Saiph says to the storyteller, "had this demon ever set
 upon the city of Uruk, or harmed its crops or its cattle?"

 "The DEMON Humbaba did not leave the CEDAR Forest," the teller
 answers. "Humbaba was charged by Enlil, lord of all gods, to guard the
 Cedar Forest against all intruders."

 At these words, a majority nod somberly. Parents hold their children
 tighter.

>Enlil


 It is no longer the right time to make that part of the story.

 "What kind of tree is called 'cedar'?" a young boy near you calls out.
 "I've never heard of it."

 "Uruk was a land like ours," the teller answers, "where the tree is
 scarce and the wood is poor. Cedarwood is strong, and beautiful, and
 pleasant to see and smell, and in those days was valued as gold. In
 the Cedar Forest far, far away, the cedar trees are so thick you could
 not see a man a hundred paces away; and so tall you could not see the
 sky."

>whisper


 "Storyteller," you call out, "did you say that Shamash, god of the
 sun, whispered these words to Gilgamesh?"

 "I did." says the teller.

 "And why would so mighty a god whisper such a thing?" you ask, turning
 to the people. "Was he afraid another god would hear? Did Shamash
 really have the glory of Gilgamesh in mind, or did he hope to use
 Uruk's king for purposes of his own?"

 A wave of muttering sweeps over the crowd, but no one comes forward to
 answer your question.

>Shamash


 "Shamash, lord of the sun, delivered this message himself to
 Gilgamesh?" you ask. "Why was it so important?"

 "Shamash, lord of the sun, is not here to tell you," answers the
 teller with a wink, gesturing into the night as the crowd laughs.

 The story moves on. "The heart of Gilgamesh burned with the words of
 Shamash," says the teller. "Gilgamesh sought out his friend ENKIDU and
 said to him: 'You came from the wild. My friend, you came from the
 wild and you know the secret paths of animals. Do you know the way to
 the Cedar Forest?'

 "Enkidu SIGHED and his heart grew heavy," says the teller, and then
 seems to become young and strong as the gruff guise of Enkidu comes
 over her. "'Yes, I know the way to the Cedar Forest, but it is long
 and lonely. And what awaits you at its end but the demon HUMBABA? The
 lord of all gods, mighty Enlil, has set him there to GUARD the Cedar
 Forest. What man or god could DEFEAT him, my brother?'"

>companion


 "Let us hear more of Gilgamesh's friend Enkidu," you say.

 "Enkidu the wild man, made by the gods to tame unruly Gilgamesh," says
 the teller, a smile lighting her face. "He lived with the animals in
 the wild lands till he came to Uruk to challenge Gilgamesh. But their
 battle united them, and instead of enemies they became closer than
 friends. Inseparable were Gilgamesh and Enkidu; together they faced
 all foes and fought all battles."

 A gust of wind ripples through the grass.

>give bag to lover


 That is not nearby.

>look


 Always the fire pit is the center of the village, and always the
 people gather there. Faint smells of tonight's great feast still
 linger, but the fire now smolders low, only a shadow of its roaring
 fierceness at sunset.

 The teller stands near the fire, and all the people's attention is
 focused on her.

 "Guard?" Saiph calls out. "Did you say the demon Humbaba was set by
 the gods to guard the Cedar Forest?"

 "By Enlil," says the teller, nodding, "Humbaba long had guarded the
 Cedar Forest against mortal intruders, at the command of Enlil, lord
 of all gods."

 "So Shamash who set this idea before Lord Gilgamesh sought merely to
 use him as a pawn in some divine GAMBIT?" Saiph asks. A babble of
 astonished voices rises from the crowd.

 "You must find your own wisdom in the story," says the teller with a
 tiny bow.

>enchidu

>enkidu


 Your mouth is already open to respond when Saiph's voice booms across
 the circle.

 The telling continues. "GILGAMESH looked at Enkidu with disapproving
 eyes," continues the teller, who then seems to grow tall and strong.
 "Is this the brave Enkidu I know?" she asks in the voice of the king.
 "Is this Enkidu who fought with the wild beasts and once challenged
 King Gilgamesh himself? Have you traded COURAGE for COWARDICE? Our
 days are few, and chances for glory far between. Do you not wish to
 burn forever in the minds of men?"

 The teller becomes Enkidu again, and seems to consider the words of
 Gilgamesh. "'You have set your mind, I see. You will make this QUEST
 no matter what your friend ENKIDU counsels. Since that is your road, I
 will go with you. I will guide you on the hidden paths; I will find
 for you the hidden water; I will help you on your quest for GLORY.
 Enkidu will go with you.'"

>brave


 "I would say rather that Enkidu was strong, not cowardly," you say,
 "to stand against such a man as Gilgamesh. What courage to raise his
 voice against so mighty and stalwart a man."

 Whispers of assent float across the fire; a great many nod visibly at
 these words. Sihan scowls darkly across the flames.

>wait


 Wisps of clouds mark moving black shadows on the stars above.

 "A strange king is Gilgamesh," Saiph says loudly. "He is troubled by
 the sight of his people, sick and dying, so he leaves them to go on a
 long quest to distant lands. Would a better king not have stayed
 behind to help them?"

 Several of those near you nod their heads.

>look

 The story continues. "Gilgamesh rejoiced," the teller says, "and
 summoned the blacksmiths to forge mighty WEAPONS for the companions.
 He summoned the blacksmiths and summoned the servants to prepare food
 and supplies. He summoned the servants and summoned the priestesses to
 make generous SACRIFICES, to ask the gods for good fortune."

 "When all was ready, Gilgamesh and Enkidu passed through the seven
 gates of Uruk and set off into the desert. The people watched them
 go," she says softly, "the people of Uruk in SILENCE watched them go."

 The teller stands near the fire, and all the people's attention is

 "Tell us of these sacrifices," asks a weaver woman in the crowd. "Were
 there many?"

 "They were many," the teller responds, "and befitting of such a strong
 king; three fattened oxen and twelve fattened sheep; four golden bowls
 of honey and five silver bowls of butter. The incense was lit and the
 prayers were sung; the priestesses sang the prayers while the stars
 turned above."

>weapons


 You call out, "What weapons did the blacksmiths of Uruk make for
 Gilgamesh and Enkidu?"

 "They were like the weapons of the gods," says the storyteller,
 spreading out her hands, "axes taller than men; knives with mighty
 pommels and inlaid patterns of gold and lapis; armor that no ordinary
 man could have bore. But Gilgamesh and Enkidu took them all and used
 them with skill."

 "Hot were the sands of the desert," continues the teller, "hot were
 the sands and hard was the way. Many BONES of less fortunate
 travellers marked their journey. But ENKIDU knew the secret paths of
 the animals and the secret hiding places of water, and the land fell
 behind them swiftly."

 "The first MOUNTAIN range they crossed in a day; the first desert and
 mountain range they crossed in a single day. On the next day they
 crossed the second desert and the second mountain range; on the next
 they crossed the third desert and the third mountain range. On the
 third night they lay down to sleep, utterly exhausted from their
 journey."
