 Cheap goddam bastards.  When the city of New York hired you on as
 Assistant to the Chief Engineer, the least they could have done was
 fork out a few hundred bucks for a one-way ticket.  And, come to think
 of it, a professional moving service.  Instead, here you are --
 shooting past the Arizona desert in a rented Move-It (tm) van, hauling
 your junk from one coast to the other.

 To keep yourself awake, you flip on the radio.  Static.  Nothing but
 static.  You scan the countryside, hoping to find anything out of the
 ordinary.  Not a chance.  Nothing but sameness; hundreds of dead
 rabbits, thousands of cacti.  Your eyes come to settle on a single
 magnificent saguaro, and your head starts to nod.

 As your head tilts forward, your eyes come to rest on the gas gauge,
 and a twist of anxiety shoots up your back.  The gas gauge flutters
 nervously above empty, and there's not a town in sight.  In fact, even
 if you find a place to stop, you're not even sure that you have the
 cash to fill up the van.  (Hmmm...didn't you spend your last five bucks
 on tacos 70 miles back?)  If you don't stumble across another pitiful
 desert ghost town -- and soon -- you'll be stranded.

 For the next few miles, you concoct a desperate plan involving
 energy-saving relaxation techniques and, if necessary, upholstery
 sandwiches.  You start to wonder if day-old rabbit meat is safe to eat.
 Then, as your eyes refocus on the road, you realize that there's a
 billboard right smack dab in front of you. Your head twitches to the
 side, and you catch sight of the good news.  CHEWTON -- 10 MILES.

 As you get closer to town, you note that the speed limit drops to 35.
 Looks like the highway cuts through town.  Good.  It should be easier
 to find a gas station that way.  Then you spot the banner, bright
 purple and as gaudy as loafers at a funeral:  WELCOME TO CHEWTON!
 PLEASE STAY FOR OUR 40th ANNUAL ROCK FESTIVAL!

 Huh.  You wonder which has-beens they talked into playing this cheap
 excuse for civilization.  Is Cheap Trick still around?  Did Journey
 regroup?  Lost in thought, you instinctively step on the gas to sneak
 under a closing railroad guard.  In seconds, a crowd of merry-makers
 walls you in.  You slam on your brakes and take in the spectacle which
 fills your field of vision:  hamburger vendors, screaming kids, and a
 colorful parade that stretches as far as the eye can see.  You squint
 to get a better look, and then roll your eyes and chuckle.

 After all, you know what they say...

 Move-It Van
    Aside from a few balled-up taco wrappers, there isn't much to see.
 The dashboard is cracked, the upholstery is soiled, and your seat is
 itchy and uncomfortable.  A garden of delights, it ain't.

 Set into the dashboard are the usual Move-It(tm) luxuries:  a cigarette
 lighter, an ashtray, and a glove compartment.

>examine me
 Trim, muscular, and fit.  You take pride in your health and appearance.

>inventory
 You have a wallet.  The wallet seems to contain an ATM card.

 You have zero respectable American dollars.

>examine cigarette lighter
 Damn thing's broken, just like everything else.  When was the last time
 this truck was serviced?

>examine ashtray
 The ashtray is closed.

>examine truck
 Which truck do you mean, the car radio, or the keys?

>examine card
 According to the hieroglyphs on the back of the card, it's good at all
 Stir, Circus, and Vista locations.

>examine car radio
 It's a low-end model, falling right in line with conventional Move-It
 standards.  The radio is off.

>open ashtray
 Opening the ashtray reveals a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin.

>turn on radio
 You're faced with the challenge of getting the hell out of Chewton, and
 you decide to sit around and listen to the radio.  Your mother would be
 ashamed.

>take coin
 Taken.

>examine rappers
 I don't know the word "rappers".

>o wrappers
 They're soggy, cheesy, and full of extra super hottie sauce.

>take sauce
 That'll just clutter up your inventory.

>look under seat
 As you look under the seat, hidden memories of unspoiled youth trickle
 into your consciousness.  You see yourself as a child, peering out from
 beneath the seat of Auntie's van in a game of hide-and-seek....
 Abruptly, the vision crumbles, leaving you with a fond memory of
 childhood innocence.

>examine glove
 The compartment is closed.

>open it
 Opening the compartment reveals a map.

>examine map
 (taking the map first)
 It's a well-worn map of the United States.  No surprise, but it's been
 folded improperly.  A message in big black marker is scrawled across
 the state of Arizona:  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  Why didn't you notice that
 before?

>examine glove
 The compartment is open.  There's a service label stuck to the inside.

>examine label
 According to the service label, the van should have gotten a tune-up
 over a year ago.  Goddam cheap bastards.

>examine window
 Smudged, but functional.

>examine parade
 You shade your eyes and peer through the windshield, without much luck.
 The teeming crowd effectively blocks your view of the merry
 proceedings.

>examine seat
 It's form-fitting.

>examine crowd
 You'll have to step out of the van for more details.

>tune radio
 I don't know the word "tune".

>fold map
 In your attempt to refold the map, you promptly herniate yourself.
 Next time, stretch first.

>stretch
 You feel much more limber now.

>fold map
 The sheer dullness of this action causes you to doze off.  When you
 awaken, the map is still folded improperly.

>roll map
 I don't know the word "roll".

>get map
 You already have the map!

>inventory
 You have a wallet, a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin, a fond memory,
 and a map.  The wallet seems to contain an ATM card.

 You have zero respectable American dollars.

>lick wrappers
 Must you always demean yourself in this way?  Your mom would be very
 disappointed.

>examine memory
 You close your eyes and concentrate, but you can recall no other
 details of the fond memory.

>eat memory
 The fond memory doesn't appear appetizing.

>examine upholstery
 Heavy use has transformed the upholstery into a thin, stained film.

>turn off engine
 I don't know the word "engine".

>get key
 It's safe to leave them where they are.  The town of Chewton is
 absolutely loaded with honesty.

>open door

>out
 Tremendous Boulder
    Excited parade-watchers, mouths agape, point to a giant boulder
 sitting astride a specially reinforced float.  Clowns, midgets, and
 security guards form a protective ring around the monstrosity.  Now
 time for the bad news:  the parade isn't moving.
    Your van is stuck in the middle of this geological mess, just north
 of the railroad crossing.  The motionless parade continues to the east
 and west.

 "Step right up ladies and gentlemen!"  With this statement, a juggler
 flips a ball twenty feet into the air, catches it in her mouth, and
 spits it back into motion.  "Let's see if you're quick enough to make a
 few bucks from a tired young juggler.  If I can't prevent you from
 grabbing the money in the hat, it's yours to keep!  Any takers?"

    A few feet away, a juggler performs amazing feats of dexterity.

 The juggler snatches a pair of twins from a nearby stroller and spins
 one on her head while she includes the other in the famed "Circle of
 Death."  Delighted, the parents applaud.

>examine boulder
 The jagged hunk of rock is over fifteen feet across and twenty feet
 tall.  It has a brute presence that draws your attention and invades
 your consciousness.  If you stare too long, the brown and gray
 afterimage of this King of Boulders imprints itself upon your mind for
 days.  If it had legs, it would leap tall buildings in a single bound.
 If it were an actor, it would be Robert De Niro.  If it were a boulder,
 it would be fifteen feet across and twenty feet tall.

>climb boulder
 You cautiously circle the security guards, jumping through a narrow gap
 in the ring when you spot an opening.  You scamper up the side of the
 boulder.  "I'M ON TOP OF THE WORLD, MA! TOP OF THE WORLD!"  The eyes of
 the parade-watchers tear up, and even the security guards join in the
 heartfelt celebration of your magnificent accomplishment.  Humbly, you
 step down and continue your quest to the east coast.

 The juggler springs into a handstand, keeping the balls twirling with
 only her feet.  "Don't try this at home, kids!"

>examine juggler
 She's in her early 20s and quite talented; her dexterity with the
 circling balls is eclipsed only by her flashy smile and sensuous charm.
 With a collection hat at her feet, she's obviously looking to make a
 few bucks off the Chewton locals.

 The juggler snatches a pair of twins from a nearby stroller and spins
 one on her head while she includes the other in the famed "Circle of
 Death."  Delighted, the parents applaud.

>examine hat
 It's a bowler.  There are two respectable dollars in the hat.

 The juggler springs into a handstand, keeping the balls twirling with
 only her feet.  "Don't try this at home, kids!"

>take hat
 If you want to take the money, just say so.

 The juggler lifts her feet from the ground and cleverly juggles both
 herself and the dancing balls.  "Gravity means nothing to me, folks!
 Keep the money coming!"

>take money
 She slaps away your hand without even taking her eyes from the balls.
 "If that's the best you can do, you might as well be an engineer from
 New York!"

 The juggler snatches a pair of twins from a nearby stroller and spins
 one on her head while she includes the other in the famed "Circle of
 Death."  Delighted, the parents applaud.

>push juggler
 You give her a shove, although she quickly regains her balance.  Not a
 single ball touches the ground.  "What are you, a little girl?  My
 grandmother pushes harder than that!"

 "Have you ever seen the Floating Iris?  Here goes!"  The juggler whacks
 a parade-watcher on the back of her head; a glass eye pops out, which
 the juggler integrates into her routine.  "What will I think of next?"

>examine van
    The back of the van is filled with your belongings, consisting
 primarily of furniture and old textbooks.  The van is safely locked.
    When you pulled into town, the van was immediately surrounded by
 curious locals.  "Look ma," one of them says, "I see taco wrappers!"
 You roll your eyes.

 The juggler sets the balls afire and releases them into the air.
 Surprisingly, the balls juggle themselves without any apparent means of
 support.  "Look, folks! It's an illeeeewzhun!"

>juggle
 What do you want to juggle?

>juggle juggler
 You're not an offical member of the AJA.  Dues are $30 a month, which
 includes scientifically balanced juggling materials, helpful pointers
 in mastering the art of hand-eye coordination, and lessons in martial
 arts and "The Perfect Taunt".

 "Have you ever seen the Floating Iris?  Here goes!"  The juggler whacks

 You have a wallet, a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin, a fond memory,
 and a map.  The wallet seems to contain an ATM card.

 You have zero respectable American dollars.

 The juggler snatches a pair of twins from a nearby stroller and spins
 one on her head while she includes the other in the famed "Circle of
 Death."  Delighted, the parents applaud.

>examine clowns
 Do clowns usually pack heat?  They must be undercover security guards.

 The juggler springs into a handstand, keeping the balls twirling with
 only her feet.  "Don't try this at home, kids!"

>examine security guards
 Fully caffeinated, the security guards are prepared to inflict fatal
 damage on those who would approach the monstrous boulder without proper
 identification.

>clear
 I don't know the word "clear".

>examine midgets
 They may be short, but they carry a big stick.  You'd better watch
 yourself.

 The juggler sets the balls afire and releases them into the air.
 Surprisingly, the balls juggle themselves without any apparent means of
 support.  "Look, folks! It's an illeeeewzhun!"

>examine floyd
 I don't know the word "floyd".

>toss midget at juggler
 You can't throw the midgets.

 The juggler snatches a pair of twins from a nearby stroller and spins
 one on her head while she includes the other in the famed "Circle of
 Death."  Delighted, the parents applaud.

>examine balls
 As they bounce between the juggler's skilled hands, the balls are
 nothing more than an orange blur.

 The juggler sets the balls afire and releases them into the air.
 Surprisingly, the balls juggle themselves without any apparent means of
 support.  "Look, folks! It's an illeeeewzhun!"

>save cf1
 I don't know the word "cf1".

>get balls
 As you grab one of the balls, she delivers a flying kick to your lower
 intestine.  While you painfully sink to the ground, the ball returns to
 her waiting hands.  "Nice try, meatball."

 The juggler lifts her feet from the ground and cleverly juggles both
 herself and the dancing balls.  "Gravity means nothing to me, folks!
 Keep the money coming!"

>save
>cf1
 Saved.

>throw memory
 What do you want to throw that at?

>juggler
 "Hah, nice try!  Why would I be distracted by a fond memory?"

 The juggler snatches a pair of twins from a nearby stroller and spins
 one on her head while she includes the other in the famed "Circle of
 Death."  Delighted, the parents applaud.

>go west
 Jars of Pebbles
    You have stumbled across the military contribution to the Chewton
 Rock Parade.  Soldiers swagger about, officers bark orders, and
 military vehicles putter to and fro.  The centerpiece of this portion
 of the parade is a Sherman tank loaded down with jars of tiny pebbles.
    The parade continues to the east and west, while the train continues
 to whistle past Chewton to the south.
    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a
 dilapidated refreshment stand.

 "Attention. Attention. Square dancing is no longer permitted within
 ranks."

>square dance
 I don't know the word "square".

>do-si-do
 I don't know the word "do-si-do".

>dance
 You swing your partner round and round.  Promenade!

 Three flies swoop in and buzz lazily about the refreshment stand.

>promenade
 I don't know the word "promenade".

>bow to your corner
 I don't know the word "bow".

>examine jar
 An officer waves his hand at the brightly decorated jars and launches
 into a well-rehearsed speech.  "Chewton physicians have been collecting
 these prizes for the last 100 years!  They're hard mineral deposits
 formed in the kidneys by phosphates and urates!"  As he leaves, the
 officer issues you a stern warning.  "By the way, whatever you do --
 don't throw anything at the jars.  The last person who tried it is
 pushing up daisies."

 The commanding officer becomes confused when he realizes that he can
 neither ask nor tell his subordinates about the government's new policy
 on sexuality.

>take jar
 The soldiers won't let you anywhere near the precious cargo.

 "Won't someone please sample my wares?"

>examine vendor
 He's covered in a layer of sweat.  Won't you please buy one of his
 lovely treats?

>inventory
 You have a wallet, a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin, and a map.  The
 wallet seems to contain an ATM card.

 You have zero respectable American dollars.

 "Won't someone please sample my wares?"

>throw wallet at jar
 The turret swings around and blows the wallet from the sky.  A soldier
 points in your direction.  "There's the one who would defile the
 creator!  Kill!  Kill!"  Ten grenades land at your feet.  Paralyzed,
 you wait for instant death. Shortly, it comes.

 Heaven
    A swirling dance of angelic choruses rises above the smothering
 beauty of spry cherubim, majestic castles, and puffy clouds.
    God is here, acting omniscient.

>wave
 I don't know the word "wave".

>examine god
 You are in the presence of the creator.  Prepare to be judged.

 Jesus stops by for a cup of tea.  He likes it with double cream and two
 sugars.

>repent
 I don't know the word "repent".

>talk to God
 I don't know the word "talk".

>pray
 God covers His ears and winces.

 Jesus ducks under a golden half-note as it bounces off God's left knee.

>god, hello
 "Howdy partner."

>ask about reincarnation
 I don't know the word "reincarnation".

>pray
 God covers His ears and winces.

 God creates another omniscient being and becomes involved in a heated
 debate about the purpose of its existence.

>ask about meaning of life
 I don't know the word "meaning".

>ask about life
 I don't know the word "life".

>ask about god
 What do you want to ask?

>ask god about wallet
 "Turn inward.  You already know the answer to that question."

 Two angels float past, arguing about scripture.

>ask god about death
>ask god about jesus
 I don't know the word "death".

 "That young 'un sure does drink a lot of tea!"

 Bored, God grants Himself three wishes.  For sport, He denies Himself
 the third wish.

>examine jesus
 He doesn't look anything like the guy in the Scorsese picture.

 Jesus makes a slurping noise as he downs the rest of his tea.
 Completely satisfied, he vanishes with a puff of smoke.

>ask god about reincarnation
 I don't know the word "reincarnation".

>ask god for tea
 "Oh, be quiet.  How am I supposed to exert my mastery over the universe
 with you yapping like that?"

 Two angels float past, arguing about scripture.

>resurrect
 I don't know the word "resurrect".

>ask god about earth
 I don't know the word "earth".

>wake up
 I don't know the word "wake".

>yell
 Your throat is a bit sore now.

 An emissary from purgatory requests God's divine intervention.  He
 refuses.

>go down
 You haven't earned your wings yet.

 The author materializes before your living soul, a look of
 consternation drawn across his face.  "How in the hell did you get in
 here?  Boy, you really screwed up.  Here, take this."  He hands you a
 curious object.  "If you want to return to Chewton, just press this
 button."

 "Oh, by the way.  You can have the wallet back.  It might come in
 handy."  With that, the author disappears.

>examine object
 The button hangs in mid-air, disembodied.  It looks awfully pushable.

 Two angels float past, arguing about scripture.

>examine button
 The button hangs in mid-air, disembodied.  It looks awfully pushable.

 You take a springy step on a puffy cloud and delight in its pure
 essence.

>push button
 God lets out a sigh of relief.  "I thought that one would never leave."

 The vendor impresses himself with his well-honed change-making
 abilities.

>examine stand
 It's one of those little refreshment booths.  There's a sign on the
 booth.

>examine sign

 Hamburger $2.00
 Ice-cold soda $1.00
 Licorice $1.00

 "Won't someone please sample my wares?"

>talk to vendor
 I don't know the word "talk".

>vendor, hello
 The vendor doesn't appreciate your rude tone of voice.

 The three flies lose interest and buzz away to greener pastures.

>ask vendor about hamburger
 "Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles -- all
 on a sesame seed bun."  His beady eyes squint down at you from beneath
 his stained cap.  "Say, you're not from McDonalds, are you?"

 The commanding officer becomes confused when he realizes that he can
 neither ask nor tell his subordinates about the government's new policy
 on sexuality.

>ask vendor about soda
 "It's cold, it's refreshing, and it's only one respectable dollar!"

 A sharpshooter picks a fight with a minesweeper and starts a
 short-lived and mentally unbalanced gang war.

>ask vendor about licorice
 "It's twirly and red.  Most delicious!"

 "Attention. Attention. All soldiers must now march in unison."  The
 soldiers form a single-file line, only to scatter immediately when
 nobody can find 'unison' in the dictionary.

>ask vendor about licorice
 "It's twirly and red.  Most delicious!"

 "Attention. Attention. Square dancing is no longer permitted within
 ranks."

>examine soldier
 The soldiers take their work seriously.  Three have their Chewton
 parade merit badges.

>examine tank
 If you remember your history correctly, it's a remnant of World War II
 -- a hulking death dealer able to travel at speeds greater than 45
 miles per hour.  It's been painted sandy colors so as not to attract
 the attention of any stray Russian MIGs traveling overhead.  While the
 parade is at a standstill, the driver and gunner are putting on a
 puppet show just above the tank hatch.

 The vendor impresses himself with his well-honed change-making
 abilities.

>examine puppet
 The gunner and driver are re-enacting My Fair Lady in its entirety.
 The gunner is able to perfectly reproduce Audrey Hepburn's harsh
 lower-class accent, while the driver is having difficulty with the high
 notes, dance steps, and rigid British dialogue.  The part where Audrey
 Hepburn unknowingly eats a live grenade is really funny.

>steal tank
 OK, you put the tank in your pocket.  Then you realize that (a) you
 aren't insane, and (b) this isn't a cartoon, so you put the tank back
 where you found it.

 A sharpshooter picks a fight with a minesweeper and starts a
 short-lived and mentally unbalanced gang war.

>steal puppet
 How do you propose to do that?

 "Won't someone please sample my wares?"

>sing
 You see no source of inspiration here.

>xyzzy
 I don't know the word "xyzzy".

>plugh
 I don't know the word "plugh".

>plover
 I don't know the word "plover".

>sing about the rain in spain
 I don't know the word "rain".

>examine gunner
 The soldiers take their work seriously.  Three have their Chewton
 parade merit badges.

>examine badges
 They look like ordinary merit badges to me.

 "Attention. Attention. All soldiers must now march in unison."  The

 nobody can find 'unison' in the dictionary.

    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a
 dilapidated refreshment stand.

 A shot zings by your left ear.

>go west
 Mound of Quartz
    In surveying the westernmost portion of the parade, you are greeted
 by the unwelcome stares of Chewton's upper class.  The host of this
 outdoor romp -- a banker, you presume, by his top hat and black tuxedo
 -- sits atop a sparkling pile of quartz in the back seat of a bright
 red convertible.  Poor unfortunates flank the party on all sides.
    An abandoned hot dog cart draped in crystal sits off to one side of
 the big to-do.  To the west, the road dead-ends into an unlit gas
 station.  The entrance to an indoor minimall lies to the south.

 You shout "The stock market has collapsed!" and giggle as the crowd of
 rich busybodies faints en masse.

>examine host
 He looks like a proud poppa, sitting up there on that mound of quartz
 with a cigar in one hand and an overdeveloped supermodel on the other.

 Off in the shadows, the inheritor of the Ritz fortune engages in
 forbidden love with a poor unfortunate.  Their fleeting embrace forms
 an unstable middle class which collapses almost instantly.

>examine quartz
 The gentle beauty of the cloudy rock touches a core of warmth in your
 heart -- something expensive food and forced pleasantries could never
 accomplish.

>touch quartz
 The banker exudes a stench of decadence that prevents your approach.

>examine cart
 The cart sports a cute umbrella.  Its very presence invites curious
 passers-by to take a stab at wiener salesmanship.
    The hot dog cart seems to contain a pair of corn dogs.

 The banker throws a cracker into the crowd and watches the ensuing
 death-battle.  As a result of the pointless bloodletting, he wins a $50
 bet.

>examine corn dogs
 They're not particularly fortified with anything.

 A stray bullet shoots over the heads of the party-goers.  A soldier
 sticks his head in.  "Sorry!"

>take corn dogs
 Taken.

>sale corn dog
 I don't know the word "sale".

>sell corn dog
 Your voice booms across the parade grounds.  "Pair of corn dogs for
 sale!  Pair of corn dogs for sale!"  The many suspicious glances
 indicate that you don't appear trustworthy.

>pet corn dog
 I don't know the word "pet".

>examine umbrella
 It's covered with dancing teddy bears.  You think it's cute.

 A poor unfortunate widens her eyes, points south, and says a single
 word:  "Hamster."

>take umbrella
 Worried about your unblemished skin?  What a baby.

 The banker throws a cracker into the crowd and watches the ensuing
 death-battle.  As a result of the pointless bloodletting, he wins a $50
 bet.

>place bet
 I don't know the word "bet".

>banker, hello
 "Howdy partner."

 You count the number of toupees in the upscale crowd and lose track
 somewhere around 40.

>gamble

>go south
 Minimall Entrance
    Mall shops lie in many directions:  west, east, south, and
 southwest.  Through the doors of the minimall entrance, you spot the
 continuing quartz debauchery.
    As a sign of Chewtonian progress, the management has seen fit to
 furnish the minimall entrance with a stand-alone ATM machine.

>examine atm
 Which atm do you mean, the ATM card, the ATM machine, or the ATM slot?

>examine atm machine
 It accepts all Vista ATM cards.  Near the screen is a card-sized slot
 patiently waiting for the next customer.

>check atm slot for skimmers
 I don't know the word "check".

>examine atm slot
 It is exactly as wide as your ATM card.  Not a micron wider.

>examine atm card
 According to the hieroglyphs on the back of the card, it's good at all
 Stir, Circus, and Vista locations.

>put atm card in slot
 You put your ATM card in the slot and punch in your secret code.  Then
 you frown, realizing your unfortunate predicament.  Your last paycheck
 hasn't cleared the bank, and so you only have $9.98 in your account.
 In disgust, the machine spits the card back at you.  ***MOVE ON,
 PARTNER*** the screen reads.  "I would love to," you think to yourself.
 You absolutely cannot wait to get the hell out of Chewton.

>kick atm machine
 The ATM machine has been known to kick back.  I wouldn't try it.

 There's nothing behind the ATM machine.

 Rock Museum
    This museum was dedicated in 1957 for one purpose:  the preservation
 of rock history in Chewton, Arizona.  Exhibits are sprinkled liberally
 about the room, although a glass display case and bulletin board are
 the only artifacts to really catch your eye.  Should you choose to
 leave this house of treasures, the entrance to the minimall lies to the
 west.
    The glass case seems to contain a valuable rock.

>examine rock
 It's three inches in diameter and almost perfectly spherical.  Due to
 its extreme roundness, Mayor Bono was convinced that aliens had dropped
 it on his lawn.

>take rock
 You'll have to open the glass case first.

>smash case

 Uniform Shop
    A slight breeze rustles the polyester uniforms, almost as if the
 ghost of another age were vying for your attention.  A beaded curtain
 marks the passage of the wind; in its wake, a cash register and bargain
 rack loom ominously.  Back to the north is the entrance to the

    A tailor flits about the store, busy filling orders for the Chewton
 rock festival.

 The tailor jots down a brief note:  "Reminder to self: Billy Beer

 Looks like someone wanted to look their parade-best by trading this old
 rag for a shiny new uniform.

 The tailor jots down a brief note:  "Reminder to self: Billy Beer

>examine smock
 It's one or two sizes too big.  The price tag says "Fifteen dollars --

>take smock
 You start to pull the smock off the rack, but your bourgeoisie values

 mysterious machine.  Dare you explore its magic?  Dare you?
    If you dare not, the entrance to the minimall is back east.

 Mound of Quartz
    In surveying the westernmost portion of the parade, you are greeted
 by the unwelcome stares of Chewton's upper class.  The host of this
 outdoor romp -- a banker, you presume, by his top hat and black tuxedo
 -- sits atop a sparkling pile of quartz in the back seat of a bright
 red convertible.  Poor unfortunates flank the party on all sides.
    An abandoned hot dog cart draped in crystal sits off to one side of
 the big to-do.  To the west, the road dead-ends into an unlit gas
 station.  The entrance to an indoor minimall lies to the south.

 The banker reminds himself to install a glass ceiling in his downtown
 office.

>go west
 The gas station is closed for the festival.  Not an attendant in sight.

 An overdressed windbag jostles you without apologizing.

 Jars of Pebbles
    You have stumbled across the military contribution to the Chewton
 Rock Parade.  Soldiers swagger about, officers bark orders, and
 military vehicles putter to and fro.  The centerpiece of this portion
 of the parade is a Sherman tank loaded down with jars of tiny pebbles.
    The parade continues to the east and west, while the train continues
 to whistle past Chewton to the south.
    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a
 dilapidated refreshment stand.

 "Attention. Attention. Square dancing is no longer permitted within
 ranks."

>go east
 Tremendous Boulder
    Excited parade-watchers, mouths agape, point to a giant boulder
 sitting astride a specially reinforced float.  Clowns, midgets, and
 security guards form a protective ring around the monstrosity.  Now
 time for the bad news:  the parade isn't moving.
    Your van is stuck in the middle of this geological mess, just north
 of the railroad crossing.  The motionless parade continues to the east
 and west.
    You see a fond memory here.
    A few feet away, a juggler performs amazing feats of dexterity.

 The juggler sets the balls afire and releases them into the air.
 Surprisingly, the balls juggle themselves without any apparent means of
 support.  "Look, folks! It's an illeeeewzhun!"

>take fond memory

 "Have you ever seen the Floating Iris?  Here goes!"  The juggler whacks
 a parade-watcher on the back of her head; a glass eye pops out, which
 the juggler integrates into her routine.  "What will I think of next?"

>go east
 Gravel Float
    So, this is where the trouble started.  A crowd huddles around the
 open hood of an old pickup, the back of which is filled to the brim
 with gravel.
    The parade continues west.  A short jaunt south takes you into a
 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

 "Billy, don't touch those!  They're radioactive!"

>examine pickup
 Is it a '57?  A '62?  You've never really been good with trucks.

 "The pound per square inch ratio on the fan belt is way too high."  The
 heads in the crowd bob up and down in firm agreement.

 A pleasant mixture of small rocks and even smaller rocks.  The black
 and grey hues are amazing.

 "Roy, hand me the glue gun so I can reattach the motor mounts."

>take rock

 It's open. If you wanted to bow to the whims of conformity, you could
 look under the darn thing.

 "It would run if we bled the air conditioner fluid from the

>look under hood
 You might be an engineer, but you couldn't repair your way out of a
 paper sack. In fact, let's test that theory...

 Giant Sack (containing conformist)
    The walls of this alien sack reach to the sky.  There is no hope of
 escape.
    You see a generic broken object here.

 however, I will return you to your regularly scheduled game.  Let this

 Pub
    As far as pubs go, this is the bottom of the line.  Under normal
 conditions, this watering hole is chock full of customers in dire need
 of drowning their lower- to upper- middle class sorrows.  At the
 moment, the place is nearly empty; most of the regulars are out in the
 summer air, enjoying the uplifting parade festivities.
    You see only the bare necessities:  booze, bar stools, and a pool
 table.  The floor is covered in sawdust to allow for infrequent
 cleanings.

 A swelling hum rolls in waves from four bikers at the rear of the pub.
 As they prepare to partake of the ball of eight, the bikers clasp hands
 in a spirit circle, chanting to their ancestors for knowledge and
 guidance.  In mid-chant, the bikers' faces are overwhelmed with anger
 and despair; the spirit circle is destroyed as they fail to achieve the
 one perfect note necessary to complete the ritual.  "For now, we shall
 play the imperfect game.  However, we will not leave this place until
 the ritual is completed.  This thing we vow."

    Behind the bar, a bartender waits patiently for the next customer.
    Four bikers are engaged in a raucous game of pool; their bright
 auras and spiritual interjections dominate the otherwise somber
 atmosphere.
    An old man sits on a stool beside the bar.

 "Woe is me!  If I only had some rotgut to tickle my empty stomach."
 The old man offers you his most pitiful expression.

>examine booze
 There it is, just waiting to be bought.

 The bikers chant softly as one of the players prepares to sink the
 eight ball in the corner pocket.  The chanting ceases when the bikers
 fail to strike the proper note of completion.

>examine bar stools

 "Woe is me!  If I only had some rotgut to tickle my empty stomach."
 The old man offers you his most pitiful expression.

>examine pool table
 At the moment, it's surrounded by four bikers caught in a maze of
 wonder and joy.  The felt is marred by years of shooting, although the
 playing surface appears to be level.  There's an apple beside one of
 the pockets.

 The bartender washes out a shot glass, gives it a spit shine, and puts
 it back on the shelf.

>examine apple
 It's red, ripe, and well worth its original price.

 "Lord in the sky," starts the old man, "when I was a young 'un they
 wouldn't have allowed this type of element in a public drinking
 establishment."

>take apple
 A biker bats your hand away and steps aside for a moment of meditation.
 He turns, his eyes hiding the pain of a thousand tortured souls.
 "Would you relieve me of my only sustenance?  Has the goodness of
 mankind turned to dust?"

 The old man breathes a heavy sigh that comes only with years of
 heartbreak and depression.

>examine sawdust
 The sawdust particles appear to be made out of pine.

>examine man
 Boy, is he dirty.  And stinky, too.

 The bikers chant softly as one of the players prepares to sink the
 eight ball in the corner pocket.  The chanting ceases when the bikers
 fail to strike the proper note of completion.

>examine bikers
 In whispering knowledge and truth across the table, the bikers share a
 bright moment of interpersonal revelation.

 Garage
    Like any garage, the floor is covered in greasy rags, spare parts,
 and one or two half-repaired vehicles.  The most recent victim is an
 Oldsmobile, which is jacked up and in mid-repair.  On first impression,
 the garage appears to be deserted -- the garage is quiet, and a stout
 metal desk lies unmanned in one corner.  However, on further
 inspection, you notice a pair of legs sticking out from beneath the
 Olds.
    Should you desire to revisit your pickup buddies, west is the
 direction of choice.

>examine oldsmobile
 Do people still drive these things?  The owner must be as goofy as a

 How stereotypical.

 and one or two half-repaired vehicles.  The most recent victim is an
 Oldsmobile, which is jacked up and in mid-repair.  On first impression,
 the garage appears to be deserted -- the garage is quiet, and a stout
 metal desk lies unmanned in one corner.  However, on further
 inspection, you notice a pair of legs sticking out from beneath the
 Olds.
    Should you desire to revisit your pickup buddies, west is the
 direction of choice.

>take legs
 Hands to yourself, you touchy-feely Californian!

 Gravel Float
    So, this is where the trouble started.  A crowd huddles around the
 open hood of an old pickup, the back of which is filled to the brim
 with gravel.
    The parade continues west.  A short jaunt south takes you into a
 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

 "Uh oh. Is oil green?"

>go west
 Tremendous Boulder
    Excited parade-watchers, mouths agape, point to a giant boulder
 sitting astride a specially reinforced float.  Clowns, midgets, and
 security guards form a protective ring around the monstrosity.  Now
 time for the bad news:  the parade isn't moving.
    Your van is stuck in the middle of this geological mess, just north
 of the railroad crossing.  The motionless parade continues to the east
 and west.
    A few feet away, a juggler performs amazing feats of dexterity.

 The juggler springs into a handstand, keeping the balls twirling with
 only her feet.  "Don't try this at home, kids!"

>roll boulder west
 I don't know the word "roll".

>push boulder
 You slip past the alert guards and lay hands on the magnificent
 monument.  Having touched the divine, your heart is now light and true.

 The juggler flops to the ground and maintains the balls' unbroken
 circle with only her well-trained stomach muscles.  "Yowzah!  Somebody
 get me a doctor before I hurt somebody!"

>push boulder on juggler
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>push boulder west
 You can't seem to do that.

 The juggler springs into a handstand, keeping the balls twirling with

 You have a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin, a map, a pair of corn

 You have zero respectable American dollars.

 Without missing a beat, the juggler rolls each ball down the length of
 her arms.  "Damn, I'm good!"

>examine clowns
 Do clowns usually pack heat?  They must be undercover security guards.

 Without missing a beat, the juggler rolls each ball down the length of
 her arms.  "Damn, I'm good!"

>examine boulder
 The jagged hunk of rock is over fifteen feet across and twenty feet
 tall.  It has a brute presence that draws your attention and invades
 your consciousness.  If you stare too long, the brown and gray
 afterimage of this King of Boulders imprints itself upon your mind for
 days.  If it had legs, it would leap tall buildings in a single bound.
 If it were an actor, it would be Robert De Niro.  If it were a boulder,
 it would be fifteen feet across and twenty feet tall.

 The juggler spins into a cartwheel, somehow managing to keep each of

>sell corndogs
 I don't know the word "corndogs".

>sell corn dogs
 Your voice booms across the parade grounds.  "Pair of corn dogs for
 sale!  Pair of corn dogs for sale!"  The many suspicious glances
 indicate that you don't appear trustworthy.

 The juggler snatches a pair of twins from a nearby stroller and spins
 one on her head while she includes the other in the famed "Circle of
 Death."  Delighted, the parents applaud.

 Pub
    As far as pubs go, this is the bottom of the line.  Under normal
 conditions, this watering hole is chock full of customers in dire need
 of drowning their lower- to upper- middle class sorrows.  At the
 moment, the place is nearly empty; most of the regulars are out in the
 summer air, enjoying the uplifting parade festivities.
    You see only the bare necessities:  booze, bar stools, and a pool
 table.  The floor is covered in sawdust to allow for infrequent
 cleanings.
    Behind the bar, a bartender waits patiently for the next customer.
    Four bikers are engaged in a raucous game of pool; their bright
 auras and spiritual interjections dominate the otherwise somber
 atmosphere.
    An old man sits on a stool beside the bar.

 The bikers toss an unruly customer out of the pub and forgive
 themselves for their trespasses.

>buy gin

 "Sorry, but you don't have enough money.  Gin costs eight respectable
 dollars."

 "Woe is me!  If I only had some rotgut to tickle my empty stomach."
 The old man offers you his most pitiful expression.

 In whispering knowledge and truth across the table, the bikers share a

 The bikers chant softly as one of the players prepares to sink the

    The parade continues to the east and west, while the train continues

    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a

 "Won't someone please sample my wares?"

>throw corn dog at jar
 The turret swings around and blows the pair of corn dogs from the sky.
 A soldier points in your direction.  "There's the one who would defile
 the creator!  Kill!  Kill!"  Ten grenades land at your feet.
 Paralyzed, you wait for instant death.  Shortly, it comes.

    A swirling dance of angelic choruses rises above the smothering

 curious object.  "If you want to return to Chewton, just press this

 "Oh, by the way.  You can have the pair of corn dogs back.  It might

 The gunner and driver are re-enacting My Fair Lady in its entirety.
 The gunner is able to perfectly reproduce Audrey Hepburn's harsh
 lower-class accent, while the driver is having difficulty with the high
 notes, dance steps, and rigid British dialogue.  The part where Audrey
 Hepburn unknowingly eats a live grenade is really funny.

 "Attention. Attention. All soldiers must now march in unison."  The

 Hoping to force the niggling thought into the open, you cast your mind
 back to previous events.

>give note to bikers
 "Oh little one.  Your gift is the sunlight that warms the disbelief
 from my guilty heart.  Goodness *does* reside in the soul of man!"

 The bikers begin their chant anew, substituting the perfect note for
 their imperfect pitch at the moment of rapture.  At once, the chanting
 ceases; the ritual completed, the bikers leave the premises to seek new
 horizons in a more perfect world.

 As the last biker leaves, a faint rumbling draws your attention to the
 pool table.  Its wooden frame continues to vibrate from the final burst
 of existential energy.  An apple, perched at the table's edge, teeters
 and falls -- becoming wedged between the old man's stool and the bar.

 As you bend down to pick up the apple, your low-cut blouse swings open,
 revealing your full breasts to the cackling old man.  Disgusted, you
 immediately straighten your back.  In a second attempt, you hold the
 blouse flat against your body; as your hand nears the apple, the old
 man bends down low and peeks beneath your skin-tight miniskirt.  You
 feel your face flush in anger and shame.  Defeated, you retreat without
 having taken the tantalizing piece of fruit.

 "Geez," says the old man with a wink and a nudge, "if I only had a
 bottle of gin to quell my restless spirit."

 It was the repair shop!  If nothing else, you must find a way to
 communicate your desperation to the mechanic -- the one man who might
 get this damnable parade up and moving again.

 his mistress from Albuquerque.  And if he doesn't cheat on his wife,

    The parade continues to the east and west, while the train continues

    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a
 dilapidated refreshment stand.

 Three flies swoop in and buzz lazily about the refreshment stand.

>examine flies
 Like the ladybug and the caterpillar, the buzzing insects go about
 their buggy business with nary a care in the world.

 The vendor impresses himself with his well-honed change-making
 abilities.

>examine tank
 If you remember your history correctly, it's a remnant of World War II
 -- a hulking death dealer able to travel at speeds greater than 45
 miles per hour.  It's been painted sandy colors so as not to attract
 the attention of any stray Russian MIGs traveling overhead.  While the
 parade is at a standstill, the driver and gunner are putting on a
 puppet show just above the tank hatch.

>go west
 Mound of Quartz
    In surveying the westernmost portion of the parade, you are greeted
 by the unwelcome stares of Chewton's upper class.  The host of this
 outdoor romp -- a banker, you presume, by his top hat and black tuxedo
 -- sits atop a sparkling pile of quartz in the back seat of a bright
 red convertible.  Poor unfortunates flank the party on all sides.
    An abandoned hot dog cart draped in crystal sits off to one side of
 the big to-do.  To the west, the road dead-ends into an unlit gas
 station.  The entrance to an indoor minimall lies to the south.

 Convinced that you *must* be one of the hired help, a prudish gentleman
 orders you to fetch him a hot toddy.

>go west
 The gas station is closed for the festival.  Not an attendant in sight.

 A poor unfortunate widens her eyes, points south, and says a single

 You can't buy anything from the banker.

 Minimall Entrance
    Mall shops lie in many directions:  west, east, south, and

 continuing quartz debauchery.
    As a sign of Chewtonian progress, the management has seen fit to
 furnish the minimall entrance with a stand-alone ATM machine.

 Rock Museum
    This museum was dedicated in 1957 for one purpose:  the preservation
 of rock history in Chewton, Arizona.  Exhibits are sprinkled liberally
 about the room, although a glass display case and bulletin board are
 the only artifacts to really catch your eye.  Should you choose to
 leave this house of treasures, the entrance to the minimall lies to the
 west.
    The glass case seems to contain a valuable rock.

>examine case
 On the upper left hand corner of the case is a gold plaque, provided by
 the Chewton Historical Society.  The case, which sits on a short wooden
 table, is closed and locked.
    The glass case seems to contain a valuable rock.

 Minimall Entrance
    Mall shops lie in many directions:  west, east, south, and

 Paint Shop
    Stacks of paint cans reach to the ceiling of this modern paint shop.
 Your senses are awash in the smell of paint fumes, and -- something

 mysterious machine.  Dare you explore its magic?  Dare you?
    If you dare not, the entrance to the minimall is back east.
    Behind the counter is a snooty paint salesman passing time before he
 finally leaves this godforsaken earth.  A sign, supported by two slim
 chains, dangles above his head.

 The salesman gives you bunny ears and then quickly lifts his eyes to
 the ceiling when you catch him in the act.

 The paint salesman drums his fingers against the counter.

 A fine red mist fills the compartment.  Two seconds later, a cute furry
 hamster enters the compartment from a hidden entrance.  It wipes the
 container clean with a tiny rag, emits a satisfied "squeak!", and
 reenters the bowels of the machine.

 The paint salesman ducks behind the counter.  When he realizes that you

 red convertible.  Poor unfortunates flank the party on all sides.
    An abandoned hot dog cart draped in crystal sits off to one side of

 You count the number of toupees in the upscale crowd and lose track

 The juggler spins into a cartwheel, somehow managing to keep each of

>throw rock at juggler
 For a split second, the juggler is distracted by the similarity in

 Cheap goddam bastards.  When the city of New York hired you on as
 Assistant to the Chief Engineer, the least they could have done was
 fork out a few hundred bucks for a one-way ticket.  And, come to think
 of it, a professional moving service.  Instead, here you are --
 shooting past the Arizona desert in a rented Move-It (tm) van, hauling
 your junk from one coast to the other.

 To keep yourself awake, you flip on the radio.  Static.  Nothing but
 static.  You scan the countryside, hoping to find anything out of the
 ordinary.  Not a chance.  Nothing but sameness; hundreds of dead
 rabbits, thousands of cacti.  Your eyes come to settle on a single
 magnificent saguaro, and your head starts to nod.

 As your head tilts forward, your eyes come to rest on the gas gauge,
 and a twist of anxiety shoots up your back.  The gas gauge flutters
 nervously above empty, and there's not a town in sight.  In fact, even
 if you find a place to stop, you're not even sure that you have the
 cash to fill up the van.  (Hmmm...didn't you spend your last five bucks
 on tacos 70 miles back?)  If you don't stumble across another pitiful
 desert ghost town -- and soon -- you'll be stranded.

 For the next few miles, you concoct a desperate plan involving
 energy-saving relaxation techniques and, if necessary, upholstery
 sandwiches.  You start to wonder if day-old rabbit meat is safe to eat.
 Then, as your eyes refocus on the road, you realize that there's a
 billboard right smack dab in front of you. Your head twitches to the
 side, and you catch sight of the good news.  CHEWTON -- 10 MILES.

 As you get closer to town, you note that the speed limit drops to 35.
 Looks like the highway cuts through town.  Good.  It should be easier
 to find a gas station that way.  Then you spot the banner, bright
 purple and as gaudy as loafers at a funeral:  WELCOME TO CHEWTON!
 PLEASE STAY FOR OUR 40th ANNUAL ROCK FESTIVAL!

 Huh.  You wonder which has-beens they talked into playing this cheap
 excuse for civilization.  Is Cheap Trick still around?  Did Journey
 regroup?  Lost in thought, you instinctively step on the gas to sneak
 under a closing railroad guard.  In seconds, a crowd of merry-makers
 walls you in.  You slam on your brakes and take in the spectacle which
 fills your field of vision:  hamburger vendors, screaming kids, and a
 colorful parade that stretches as far as the eye can see.  You squint
 to get a better look, and then roll your eyes and chuckle.

 After all, you know what they say...

 Move-It Van
    Aside from a few balled-up taco wrappers, there isn't much to see.
 The dashboard is cracked, the upholstery is soiled, and your seat is
 itchy and uncomfortable.  A garden of delights, it ain't.

 Set into the dashboard are the usual Move-It(tm) luxuries:  a cigarette
 lighter, an ashtray, and a glove compartment.

 Uniform Shop
    A slight breeze rustles the polyester uniforms, almost as if the
 ghost of another age were vying for your attention.  A beaded curtain
 marks the passage of the wind; in its wake, a cash register and bargain
 rack loom ominously.  Back to the north is the entrance to the
 minimall.
    A tailor flits about the store, busy filling orders for the Chewton
 rock festival.

 As the tailor mends a button-up shirt, he mumbles something about the
 lapels being far too small.

>examine bargain rack
 On the ominously looming bargain rack is a greasy second-hand smock.
 Looks like someone wanted to look their parade-best by trading this old
 rag for a shiny new uniform.

 Momentarily, you feel a funky vibe.

>examine smock
 It's one or two sizes too big.  The price tag says "Fifteen dollars --
 cheap!"  The logo on the smock is a smiling hot dog.

 The tailor measures his own shirt sleeves.  "Well, I do declare.  My
 arms are shrinking again!"

>search smock

 Hesitantly, you tap your left foot against the floor. Your hips begin
 to sway, first to the left (oooooh) and to the right (aaaaaah). Once
 your hips find the groove, the spirit of the disco ball awakens
 sleepily from its pained slumber. Its reflected rays seep into your
 willing body and urge you onward.  You respond, matching hip thrust to
 downbeat and finger point to bass bump. Like a funky human sacrifice,
 you body offers twists, turns, and splits to the overpowering will of
 the gleaming orb. Eventually, the appetite of the ball is sated; you
 collapse, sweaty but satisfied.

 An officer, indian, construction worker, and sailor pay a brief visit.
 They bow respectfully and leave without saying a word.

>take smock
 You start to pull the smock off the rack, but your bourgeoisie values
 get the better of you.  You leave the smock for an honest paying
 customer.

 Tremendous Boulder
    Excited parade-watchers, mouths agape, point to a giant boulder
 sitting astride a specially reinforced float.  Clowns, midgets, and
 security guards form a protective ring around the monstrosity.  Now
 time for the bad news:  the parade isn't moving.
    Your van is stuck in the middle of this geological mess, just north
 of the railroad crossing.  The motionless parade continues to the east

    A few feet away, a juggler performs amazing feats of dexterity.

 "Doesn't someone want to grab the money out of the hat?  What could be
 easier?"

>throw rock at juggler

 With a sly grin, you toss the orange rock to the juggler.  She begins
 to falter, unable to understand how an extra ball suddenly appeared.

>get money
 While the juggler is distracted, you snatch the money from the hat.
 "Nice work, stranger."

 [Your score just went up 15 points]

 The juggler continues to concentrate, well on her way to integrating
 the stray "ball" into her routine.

 The rock now belongs to the juggler.

 At last, the juggler regains her composure.  A warm round of applause
 greets her amazing feat.

 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

 Pub
    As far as pubs go, this is the bottom of the line.  Under normal
 conditions, this watering hole is chock full of customers in dire need
 of drowning their lower- to upper- middle class sorrows.  At the
 moment, the place is nearly empty; most of the regulars are out in the
 summer air, enjoying the uplifting parade festivities.
    You see only the bare necessities:  booze, bar stools, and a pool
 table.  The floor is covered in sawdust to allow for infrequent
 cleanings.
    You see a wedged apple here.
    Behind the bar, a bartender waits patiently for the next customer.
    An old man sits on a stool beside the bar.

>buy gin
 (from the bartender)
 "Sorry, but you don't have enough money.  Gin costs eight respectable
 dollars."

>inventory
 You have a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin, a map, a wallet, a fond
 memory, a pair of corn dogs, a nifty key, and a wad of *respectable*
 American cash.  The wallet seems to contain an ATM card.

 The wad of cash comes to a total of 2 dollars.

 "Woe is me!  If I only had some rotgut to tickle my empty stomach."
 The old man offers you his most pitiful expression.

>examine wallet
 It's an old velcro wallet that you never replaced.
    The wallet seems to contain an ATM card.

 The bartender steps around the counter and sweeps up the broken glass

 Garage
    Like any garage, the floor is covered in greasy rags, spare parts,
 and one or two half-repaired vehicles.  The most recent victim is an
 Oldsmobile, which is jacked up and in mid-repair.  On first impression,
 the garage appears to be deserted -- the garage is quiet, and a stout
 metal desk lies unmanned in one corner.  However, on further
 inspection, you notice a pair of legs sticking out from beneath the
 Olds.
    Should you desire to revisit your pickup buddies, west is the

 Three flies swoop in and buzz lazily about the refreshment stand.

 pulls a can of lemon fizzie from behind the stand and gently places it
 in your eager hands.

 "Attention. Attention. Square dancing is no longer permitted within

 As you pour the fizzie into the full bottle of whiskey, it overflows

 You lightly swish the whiskey n' fizzie between your cheek and gums.
 Inspired by its magnificent bouquet and full fizzie body, you pour the

 Mound of Quartz
    In surveying the westernmost portion of the parade, you are greeted
 by the unwelcome stares of Chewton's upper class.  The host of this
 outdoor romp -- a banker, you presume, by his top hat and black tuxedo
 -- sits atop a sparkling pile of quartz in the back seat of a bright
 red convertible.  Poor unfortunates flank the party on all sides.
    An abandoned hot dog cart draped in crystal sits off to one side of
 the big to-do.  To the west, the road dead-ends into an unlit gas
 station.  The entrance to an indoor minimall lies to the south.

 The banker throws a cracker into the crowd and watches the ensuing
 death-battle.  As a result of the pointless bloodletting, he wins a $50
 bet.

 As the alcohol kicks in, your brain becomes weighted down with a
 taffy-like substance.  Your leaden head lists to the side as your eyes
 narrow into shifty slits.  You feel capable of slightly immoral acts.

    Mall shops lie in many directions:  west, east, south, and

 furnish the minimall entrance with a stand-alone ATM machine.

>go south
 Uniform Shop
    A slight breeze rustles the polyester uniforms, almost as if the
 ghost of another age were vying for your attention.  A beaded curtain
 marks the passage of the wind; in its wake, a cash register and bargain
 rack loom ominously.  Back to the north is the entrance to the
 minimall.
    A tailor flits about the store, busy filling orders for the Chewton
 rock festival.

 The tailor pulls a remote unit out of his pocket and flips a glittery
 switch.  A disco ball lowers itself from the ceiling.  The tailor
 demonstrates a few choice disco moves, then wistfully returns the ball
 to its original position.

>steal smock
 You stumble across the shop and smack into the bargain rack, rattling
 the hangers like a batch of tinny wind chimes.  The tailor, wrapped up
 in his funky work, ignores you as you grab the smock.  Mentally
 surveying your past life, you wonder if the stolen smock means that
 burning in hell is a future possibility.

 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

 "Lou, put the pickup in Drive and then pop the clutch.  That'll fix
 her."

>inventory
 You have a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin, a map, a wallet, a fond
 memory, a nifty key, a wad of *respectable* American cash, a wrinkled
 paper bag, a greasy smock (being worn), and an empty can of lemon
 fizzie.  The wallet seems to contain an ATM card.  The wrinkled paper
 bag seems to contain a small flask.

 The wad of cash comes to a total of 7 dollars.

 "Gee, Merle.  Looks like we got a valve problem."

>examine can
 It probably has more nutrition now than it did when it was full.

>go east
 Garage
    Like any garage, the floor is covered in greasy rags, spare parts,
 and one or two half-repaired vehicles.  The most recent victim is an
 Oldsmobile, which is jacked up and in mid-repair.  On first impression,
 the garage appears to be deserted -- the garage is quiet, and a stout
 metal desk lies unmanned in one corner.  However, on further
 inspection, you notice a pair of legs sticking out from beneath the
 Olds.
    Should you desire to revisit your pickup buddies, west is the
 direction of choice.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>go west
 Gravel Float
    So, this is where the trouble started.  A crowd huddles around the
 open hood of an old pickup, the back of which is filled to the brim
 with gravel.
    The parade continues west.  A short jaunt south takes you into a
 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

 "John, why don't you disconnect the spark plugs from the gas line and
 we'll turn this baby over once and for all."

>go south
 Pub
    As far as pubs go, this is the bottom of the line.  Under normal
 conditions, this watering hole is chock full of customers in dire need
 of drowning their lower- to upper- middle class sorrows.  At the
 moment, the place is nearly empty; most of the regulars are out in the
 summer air, enjoying the uplifting parade festivities.
    You see only the bare necessities:  booze, bar stools, and a pool
 table.  The floor is covered in sawdust to allow for infrequent
 cleanings.
    You see a wedged apple here.
    Behind the bar, a bartender waits patiently for the next customer.
    An old man sits on a stool beside the bar.

>take sawdust with can
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>take sawdust
 You could probably put the sawdust in the paper bag, but you'll have to
 empty it first.

>take flask
 Taken.

 The bartender washes out a shot glass, gives it a spit shine, and puts
 it back on the shelf.

>take sawdust
 You scoop a few pounds of sawdust into the paper bag.

 The old man stares into space.

 Gravel Float
    So, this is where the trouble started.  A crowd huddles around the
 open hood of an old pickup, the back of which is filled to the brim
 with gravel.
    The parade continues west.  A short jaunt south takes you into a
 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

>go west
 Tremendous Boulder
    Excited parade-watchers, mouths agape, point to a giant boulder
 sitting astride a specially reinforced float.  Clowns, midgets, and
 security guards form a protective ring around the monstrosity.  Now
 time for the bad news:  the parade isn't moving.
    Your van is stuck in the middle of this geological mess, just north
 of the railroad crossing.  The motionless parade continues to the east
 and west.
    A few feet away, a juggler performs amazing feats of dexterity.

 The juggler sets the balls afire and releases them into the air.
 Surprisingly, the balls juggle themselves without any apparent means of
 support.  "Look, folks! It's an illeeeewzhun!"

>go west
 Jars of Pebbles
    You have stumbled across the military contribution to the Chewton
 Rock Parade.  Soldiers swagger about, officers bark orders, and
 military vehicles putter to and fro.  The centerpiece of this portion
 of the parade is a Sherman tank loaded down with jars of tiny pebbles.
    The parade continues to the east and west, while the train continues
 to whistle past Chewton to the south.
    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a
 dilapidated refreshment stand.

>go west
 Mound of Quartz
    In surveying the westernmost portion of the parade, you are greeted
 by the unwelcome stares of Chewton's upper class.  The host of this
 outdoor romp -- a banker, you presume, by his top hat and black tuxedo
 -- sits atop a sparkling pile of quartz in the back seat of a bright
 red convertible.  Poor unfortunates flank the party on all sides.
    An abandoned hot dog cart draped in crystal sits off to one side of
 the big to-do.  To the west, the road dead-ends into an unlit gas
 station.  The entrance to an indoor minimall lies to the south.

 A poor unfortunate widens her eyes, points south, and says a single
 word:  "Hamster."

>go south
 Minimall Entrance
    Mall shops lie in many directions:  west, east, south, and
 southwest.  Through the doors of the minimall entrance, you spot the
 continuing quartz debauchery.
    As a sign of Chewtonian progress, the management has seen fit to
 furnish the minimall entrance with a stand-alone ATM machine.

>go west
 Paint Shop
    Stacks of paint cans reach to the ceiling of this modern paint shop.
 Your senses are awash in the smell of paint fumes, and -- something
 else.  Rodent?  Surely not.  Beside the counter is a curious,
 mysterious machine.  Dare you explore its magic?  Dare you?
    If you dare not, the entrance to the minimall is back east.
    Behind the counter is a snooty paint salesman passing time before he
 finally leaves this godforsaken earth.  A sign, supported by two slim
 chains, dangles above his head.

 The salesman gives you bunny ears and then quickly lifts his eyes to
 the ceiling when you catch him in the act.

 Uniform Shop
    A slight breeze rustles the polyester uniforms, almost as if the
 ghost of another age were vying for your attention.  A beaded curtain
 marks the passage of the wind; in its wake, a cash register and bargain
 rack loom ominously.  Back to the north is the entrance to the
 minimall.
    A tailor flits about the store, busy filling orders for the Chewton
 rock festival.

 The tailor measures his own shirt sleeves.  "Well, I do declare.  My
 arms are shrinking again!"

 Laundromat
    Washers and dryers line the walls of the laundromat.  A careless
 parade-watcher left his or her laundry unattended; as a result, a
 washer burst open -- leaving the floor covered with a soapy puddle.
 You notice a machine on the far wall, although you can't quite make out
 the details.
    Back to the northeast is the entrance to the minimall.

>put sawdust on puddle
 In sweeping circles, you sprinkle the sawdust onto the soapy floor,
 creating a firm surface to walk upon.  How 'bout another look at that
 machine?

>examine machine
 This poor excuse for machinery presents two slots at eye-level (one
 vertical, one horizontal) and a receptacle at waist level.

>examine vertical slot
 It's roughly one inch (2.5 cm) tall.

>examine horizontal slot
 It's roughly three inches (7.5 cm) wide.

>examine receptacle
 In the blinding light, you can't help but notice small lettering etched
 into the side of the receptacle.

>read lettering
 Made in 1979.

>examine coin
 You can't believe your luck!  It's a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin,
 minted in 1979.  Probably worth a lot of money.  If only you could find
 a collector...

>save

 "Geez," says the old man with a wink and a nudge, "if I only had a
 bottle of gin to quell my restless spirit."

>buy gin
 (from the bartender)
 The bartender accepts your respectable dollars.  He pulls the bottle of
 gin from behind the bar and roughly places it in your eager hands.

 "Woe is me!  If I only had some rotgut to tickle my empty stomach."
 The old man offers you his most pitiful expression.

 munching.  "Hey, whose magazine is this?"  He tosses the magazine in a
 trash can.  "I don't read that pornographic garbage.  Where's my
 special rainforest issue of National Geographic?"

 that you interrupted my work?"

>ask man about fixing car
 I don't know the word "fixing".

 I don't know the word "repairing".

>tell man about pickup
 You explain how the lead float in the parade is in desperate need of
 repair.  "Listen, I'm sympathetic to your predicament -- but I don't
 have a lot of friends in this town.  There's no reason for me repair
 the float.  If you want me to lend a hand, you'll have to convince me
 otherwise."

 You step over to the desk, gently lower yourself onto the mechanic's
 lap, and shower him with hugs and kisses.  With your show of affection,
 the mechanics's eyes melt into a glowing look of fondness and
 admiration.  "Lady," he murmurs, "I'll follow you anywhere."

 You place his strong, calloused hand in yours, tousle his hair, and
 stride through the garage entrance to the outside world.  Upon seeing
 the broken float, the mechanic lowers his head in embarrassment, pats
 your arm, and cheerfully lends a hand.  In twenty minutes, the parade
 is up and moving.  In another twenty, the mechanic finds the gas
 station attendant and lends you $40 to fill up the van.

 In passing, the juggler tosses you a friendly wink and discreetly
 gestures towards the nervous mechanic.  "Nice work, honey."  All in
 all, you have to agree.  The parade is gone, night is falling, and
 you've found yourself a new traveling companion.  New York City isn't
 looking quite so lonely after all.

 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

 "Lou, put the pickup in Drive and then pop the clutch.  That'll fix
 her."

>go north
 That's just the gateway to another dimension.  You don't need to go in
 there.

 "Jimmy, blow into the left rear tire.  It's running a little low."

>go west
 Tremendous Boulder
    Excited parade-watchers, mouths agape, point to a giant boulder
 sitting astride a specially reinforced float.  Clowns, midgets, and
 security guards form a protective ring around the monstrosity.  Now
 time for the bad news:  the parade isn't moving.
    Your van is stuck in the middle of this geological mess, just north
 of the railroad crossing.  The motionless parade continues to the east
 and west.
    A few feet away, a juggler performs amazing feats of dexterity.

>throw can at boulder
 The empty can of lemon fizzie makes a wide arc and dashes against the
 side of the boulder, instantly shattering into a fine dust.  At the
 moment of contact, a resonant vibration spreads through the gigantic
 mass.  The ensuing noise drops the frightened crowd to its knees;
 prayers rise to the lips of the masses, and peace and harmony falls
 across Chewton.  "Gosh," you think to yourself.  "Nice shot!"

 The juggler sets the balls afire and releases them into the air.
 Surprisingly, the balls juggle themselves without any apparent means of
 support.  "Look, folks! It's an illeeeewzhun!"

>throw gerbil at juggler
 "You've already solved the puzzle, moron.  Move it or lose it."

 The juggler lifts her feet from the ground and cleverly juggles both
 herself and the dancing balls.  "Gravity means nothing to me, folks!
 Keep the money coming!"

>climb van
    You rocket to the top of the van, triggering the Move-It (tm)
 anti-breaking-into-the-top-of-the-van device.  A springboard lifts you
 skyward. You clench your teeth and prepare for the worst; thankfully,
 you land rather gracefully on a flatbed car of the eastbound train.
 The impact drives away your sense of personal identity, leading to the
 first of many unfortunate predicaments:  your marriage to a distant
 cousin, followed by a kidnapping, a slippery affair with an unsavory
 character, and the loss of your life savings at the greyhound track.
    Forty years down the line, you wonder why the term "parade" drives
 you into a psychotic frenzy.  One day, while watching 'Circus of the
 Stars,' you kill a man.  The court rules in favor of temporary insanity
 and sends you to a world renowned psychiatrist.  Attracted by your
 mysterious past, the psychiatrist convinces you to divorce your
 verbally abusive cousin and partake of his insecure love.
    If you like, I can add you to a listserv that provides daily updates
 on your new life with the doctor.  As a first installment, tomorrow you
 will have grapefruit for breakfast, skim the sports section, and seduce
 the plumber.  As a result, he may or may not fix your pipes.

 She's far too busy to be interested in your silly questions.

 The juggler springs into a handstand, keeping the balls twirling with
 only her feet.  "Don't try this at home, kids!"

>go east
 Gravel Float
    So, this is where the trouble started.  A crowd huddles around the
 open hood of an old pickup, the back of which is filled to the brim
 with gravel.
    The parade continues west.  A short jaunt south takes you into a
 pub, while a stroll east brings you to a repair shop.

 Jars of Pebbles
    You have stumbled across the military contribution to the Chewton
 Rock Parade.  Soldiers swagger about, officers bark orders, and
 military vehicles putter to and fro.  The centerpiece of this portion
 of the parade is a Sherman tank loaded down with jars of tiny pebbles.
    The parade continues to the east and west, while the train continues
 to whistle past Chewton to the south.
    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a
 dilapidated refreshment stand.

 "Attention. Attention. Square dancing is no longer permitted within
 ranks."

>go west
 Mound of Quartz
    In surveying the westernmost portion of the parade, you are greeted
 by the unwelcome stares of Chewton's upper class.  The host of this
 outdoor romp -- a banker, you presume, by his top hat and black tuxedo
 -- sits atop a sparkling pile of quartz in the back seat of a bright
 red convertible.  Poor unfortunates flank the party on all sides.
    An abandoned hot dog cart draped in crystal sits off to one side of
 the big to-do.  To the west, the road dead-ends into an unlit gas
 station.  The entrance to an indoor minimall lies to the south.

 An overdressed windbag jostles you without apologizing.

>ask host about me
 He might talk to you if you were a cigar.  Otherwise, no dice.

 The banker reminds himself to install a glass ceiling in his downtown
 office.

>go south
 Minimall Entrance
    Mall shops lie in many directions:  west, east, south, and
 southwest.  Through the doors of the minimall entrance, you spot the
 continuing quartz debauchery.
    As a sign of Chewtonian progress, the management has seen fit to
 furnish the minimall entrance with a stand-alone ATM machine.

>go southwest
 Laundromat
    Washers and dryers line the walls of the laudromat.  A thin layer of
 sawdust is spread atop the soapy puddle, allowing for hazard-free
 machine inspection.
    Back to the northeast is the entrance to the minimall.

>throw can at machine
 I don't see any can here.

>inventory
 You have a Susan B. Anthony one-dollar coin, a map, a wallet, a fond
 memory, a nifty key, a wad of *respectable* American cash, a wrinkled
 paper bag, a greasy smock (being worn), a small flask, a gerbil (being
 dead), and a ticket for nonsensical behavior.  The wallet seems to
 contain an ATM card.

 The wad of cash comes to a total of 7 dollars.

 The banker lights a cigar with a $100 bill and spits on the ashes.

>go west
 The gas station is closed for the festival.  Not an attendant in sight.

 Convinced that you *must* be one of the hired help, a prudish gentleman
 orders you to fetch him a hot toddy.

    The parade continues to the east and west, while the train continues

    Just to the right of a low-cut hedge is a hamburger vendor at a
 dilapidated refreshment stand.

>remove smock
 Okay, you're no longer wearing the greasy smock.

 A sharpshooter picks a fight with a minesweeper and starts a
 short-lived and mentally unbalanced gang war.

>drop smock
 Dropped.

 Three flies swoop in and buzz lazily about the refreshment stand.

>throw flask at jar
 The turret swings around and blows the small flask from the sky.  A
 soldier points in your direction.  "There's the one who would defile
 the creator!  Kill!  Kill!"  Ten grenades land at your feet.
 Paralyzed, you wait for instant death.  Shortly, it comes.

 Meet your doom, smock-stealer...

 Hell
    A mesmerized crowd of tortured souls sits cross-legged in a circle.
 Eight feet above the group is a nearly invisible flicker of light.
    Liberace is here, reading aloud from a book of fairy tales.
    Satan fidgets near the edge of the circle.

 "I don't see why sleeping beauty has to be magically asleep.  Why can't
 she just be tired?"

>repent
 I don't know the word "repent".

>examine train
 As a child, trains provided the motivation and inspiration to work
 through your elementary math and science courses.  Eventually, you
 channeled your inspiration into a career:  mechanical engineering.

 The vendor narrowly avoids a scuffle when he refuses to reveal the
 secret ingredient in his special sauce.

>jump on train
 You run alongside the slow-moving train and jump between two boxcars.
 Once outside the city limits, the train resumes its high-speed trek
 across Arizona.

 Being a Hobo
    Holding on for dear life, you hide in the shadows between two
 boxcars.

>restore
>cf2
 Restored.

 Paint Shop
    Stacks of paint cans reach to the ceiling of this modern paint shop.
 Your senses are awash in the smell of paint fumes, and -- something
 else.  Rodent?  Surely not.  Beside the counter is a curious,
 mysterious machine.  Dare you explore its magic?  Dare you?
    If you dare not, the entrance to the minimall is back east.
    The compartment seems to contain a valuable rock (painted orange).
    Behind the counter is a snooty paint salesman passing time before he
 finally leaves this godforsaken earth.  A sign, supported by two slim
 chains, dangles above his head.

>buy hamster
 (from the paint salesman)
 "I'll tell you what.  You want a companion -- you can have the gerbil I
 used last week."  The salesman pulls a dead gerbil from behind the
 counter and stuffs it into your hands.

 The paint salesman drums his fingers against the counter.

 Heaven
    A swirling dance of angelic choruses rises above the smothering
 beauty of spry cherubim, majestic castles, and puffy clouds.
    God is here, acting omniscient.

 An emissary from purgatory requests God's divine intervention.  He
 refuses.

>give hamster to god
 I don't see any hamster here.

>give gerbil to god
 You have nothing that God would ever need.

 The author materializes before your living soul, a look of
 consternation drawn across his face.  "How in the hell did you get in
 here?  Boy, you really screwed up.  Here, take this."  He hands you a
 curious object.  "If you want to return to Chewton, just press this
 button."

 "Oh, by the way.  You can have the map back.  It might come in handy."
 With that, the author disappears.

 Bored, God grants Himself three wishes.  For sport, He denies Himself

 Its gerbil soul has long since traveled to gerbil heaven.  For a
