 You've just arrived at home from your nightly visit to the science and
 invention section of the local public library, where you spend each
 night dreaming your dreamy dreams of one day inventing a time travel
 machine.  Tonight, for some reason, you're especially fatigued, and
 can't wait to get inside and go right to bed.  Seems like a good plan,
 but somehow you have a premonition it's not going to be that easy...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of house</span>
 This is the front of your house.  A couple of stones lying about make
 up your half-hearted attempt at landscaping.  Your driveway is to the
 northeast.  A small path leads northwest and southwest.  The front
 door stands invitingly to the west.

 You see a doormat here.

 It's locked.  Drat the luck, you've forgotten your house key tonight.
 There must be a spare around here somewhere.

 notifications at any time by typing 'notify.' ]

>unlock door with key
 3/9 

 This key doesn't fit the front door lock.  It must open something
 else.

 As you move the key away from the lock, you are hit with a strong
 sense that it is going to be a long and complicated night before
 you'll be able to unlock and open this door.

 At the same moment, something causes your spine to shiver.  Something
 is definitely in the air this evening, but you don't know what.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of house</span>
 The north side of your house is dominated by your garage door.  The
 garage door is closed.  A scaled stone wall runs up the side of the
 house.  The driveway extends east, and a small path leads southeast to
 the front of the house and southwest to the back.

>climb wall
 7/24 

 You climb gingerly up the stone wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North roof</span>
 This is the north end of the roof.  Shingle tiles, already looking the
 worse for wear, make for slippery traction.  A gutter trap, clogged
 with leaves, runs along the length of the west side of the house.  The
 roof itself continues south.  The stone wall, which turns out to be
 the outside of your chimney, leads back down.

 [ Your score just went up by 4 points. ]

>examine gutter
 7/25 

 It's clogged full of leaves.

>examine chimney
 7/26 

 I see nothing special about the chimney.

>examine leaves
 7/27 

 It looks like there's something in the leaves.

>search leaves
 7/28 

 You find an old tennis ball, which you take.

>count leaves
 7/29 

 There isn't much point to that.

>examine ball
 7/30 

 It's faded to a pale whitish green over the years, and it's sticky
 with mud and rotten leaves.  You must have lost it during an exuberant
 game of catch some years ago.

>fetch ball
 7/31 

 You already have the old tennis ball!

>throw ball
 7/32 

 You throw the old tennis ball.  It sails off the roof to the north,
 and bounces into the driveway.

>undo

 (Undoing one command)


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North roof</span>

 You can't move the shingles.

 7/34

>go south
 7/39 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South roof</span>
 The shingles are in even worse shape on this end of the house, which
 makes you very nervous as the ground is a long way down from the peak
 here, at least 30 feet.  The gutter trap is to the west and continues
 up to the north end of the house.  You can see the top opening of the
 drainpipe in the clogged leaves.  The only exit is north.

 A squirrel is here.

 The squirrel is rather squat and feral, but it regards you with an
 almost intelligent interest.

>examine squirrel
 7/40 

 Definitely male, all right.  He's got a tuft of white hair on his head
 that almost gives him an Einstein-like appearance.  In his little paws
 is a big, juicy acorn.

 The squirrel gazes into the distance, daydreaming about something.

>take acorn
 7/41 

 The squirrel is carrying the big juicy acorn and won't let you have
 it.

 The squirrel dashes from one spot to another, then twitches its jaws.

 A mood seems to come over the squirrel, indistinguishable from other
 squirrel moods.

 7/50 

 You pull out a few stray leaves, but it does nothing to unclog the
 drainpipe.

 The squirrel pouts, looks excited, then pouts again.  Just your usual
 squirrel business.

 You laugh at the squirrel.  Your derisiveness falls on deaf ears, as
 it were.

 The squirrel nibbles and fidgets.

>shake drainpipe
 7/55 

 I don't know the word "shake".

>hit drainpipe
 7/56 

 You strike the drainpipe.  It makes a dull noise, padded by all the

 7/63 

 You climb gingerly down the stone wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of house</span>
 The north side of your house is dominated by your garage door.  The

>go southwest
 7/67 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Behind house</span>
 The back of your house is pretty non-descript, except for some really
 nice trees that make up for the lack of landscaping in the front.  The
 spout of your drainpipe comes down here from the roof.  A gravel path
 extends northeast and southeast.

>inventory

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 You always thought this would be a nice place to plant a tree, but a
 bare spot reminds you of your lack of foresight.  The ground slopes
 down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story
 high because of it.  There is a tiny window high in the wall, about 30
 feet up.  A little path made by you on your many daily walks leads
 southwest into the woods.  You can walk around your house to the
 northwest and northeast.

>examine window
 7/78 

 The little window is probably the one that leads into your attic.
 It's hard to judge from here, but it looks like you could just fit
 through it.  Getting all the way up to it is going to be the real
 problem.

>se
 7/79 

 You can't go that way.

>go southwest
 7/80 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 This little spot is one of your favorite places to sit and think.  A
 well-trod path winds through a natural grove of cedar and live oak
 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

>examine rock
 7/81 

 The rock is a five foot grey boulder, almost egg-shaped, a single
 piece of heavy, textured granite.  Polished smooth over time, a wedge
 shape sheared from the top ages ago provides a comfortable place to
 sit.

>sit

 You sit down on top of the rock.  It is very serene and peaceful.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Path in the woods</span> (on the large rock)
 This little spot is one of your favorite places to sit and think.  A
 well-trod path winds through a natural grove of cedar and live oak
 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

>sleep
 7/84 

 You'd rather wait until you can get inside your house and into your
 own bed.

>climb rock
 7/85 

 The large rock is not suitable for climbing.

>put key in rock
 7/86 

 You can't put anything into the large rock.

>rock, you rock
 7/86 

 There's no verb in that sentence!

>stand
 7/87 

 Okay, you're no longer on the large rock.

>examine trees
 7/88 

 I see nothing special about the grove of cedar and live oak trees.

>exits
 7/89 

 The path leads northeast to your house, and a clearing is visible to
 the southwest.

>look under rock
 7/90 

 There's nothing under the large rock.

>check rock for note from past me
 7/90 

 There are words after your command that I couldn't use.

>go southwest
 7/91 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 The woods part in a marvelous natural clearing here.  Moonlight
 streams prettily through the canopy of leaves above.  The ground is
 hard and flat and clean.  Your footpath leaves the clearing to the
 northeast, heading back to the house.

 There is a warmth to the air you don't recognize.

>examine ground
 7/92 

 It lies beneath you.

>lie
 7/92 

 What do you want to lie on?

>lie on ground
 7/93 

 Okay, you're now sitting on the ground.

>examine sky
 7/94 

 The moon is gibbous and waning, but bright on this cloudless night.

 There are two main theories about the potential for time travel.  The
 first is that time is linear and immutable.  Even if one were able to
 travel back and forth, there would be no way to alter the course of
 events.  This does not rule out free will; rather, it is stipulated
 that free action is accounted for -- the time traveller's comings and
 goings have, in a sense, already taken place.  You could not go back
 in time and prevent your own birth, for circumstances would intervene
 to make this action impossible.

 The second theory is that the timeline branches when a time traveller
 moves back and forth.  A traveller from the future may disrupt the
 possibility of returning to the same world he or she left behind.
 Some say that time is an infinitely branching tree, with each moment
 containing a universe of all probable or possible choices, and the
 time traveller slips around from one to the next, with free will being
 a crucial factor in the consequent events.

 A third theory has been recently posited, and is the core of this
 particular book.  It delves into the possibility of a merger between
 the two theories (previously determined to be mutually exclusive).
 This theory is expanded upon under the heading of paradoxes.

 7/98 

 You feel nothing special.

>read about paradoxes
 7/99 

 (in the library book)
 This book centers on a new kind of paradox.  It posits a theory in
 which the two main theories of time travel (previously determined to
 be mutually exclusive) are merged, allowing both for a universe in
 which time travel cannot change the course of events; and yet at the
 same time depicts a branching time stream where a time traveller may
 redirect events to change the future.

 This new paradox goes something as follows:  A time traveller from the
 future travels back to the past.  The mere act of traveling backwards
 disrupts the future course of events from that moment, making it
 impossible for the traveller to return to his or her own time and find
 it to be as he or she left it.  However, through further manipulation
 of objects and events, the time traveller will be able to alter the
 time stream such that the future he or she left will be restored.

 Once the future is restored, the time traveller will have discovered
 that all of these events -- including the initial time trip which
 disrupted the time stream -- needed to happen, or else the time
 traveller would never have existed in the world he or she initially
 came from, and thus would not have been able to make the trip in the
 first place.  The existence of the future he or she came from was
 contingent on the very disruption and manipulation of the time stream
 that nearly caused their future never to have existed at all!

 down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story
 high because of it.  There is a tiny window high in the wall, about 30
 feet up.  A little path made by you on your many daily walks leads
 southwest into the woods.  You can walk around your house to the
 northwest and northeast.

 You see a busted wheelbarrow here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 This little spot is one of your favorite places to sit and think.  A
 well-trod path winds through a natural grove of cedar and live oak
 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

 streams prettily through the canopy of leaves above.  The ground is
 hard and flat and clean.  Your footpath leaves the clearing to the
 northeast, heading back to the house.

 When the light fades, you see that a time machine has appeared!

>examine time machine
 26/267 

 It's a large contraption that's about the size and shape of an engine
 block, and made of solid metal.  It sits on a platform that is welded
 firmly to the machine itself.  On the front is a knob and a large red
 button.  On the back side of it is a hinged compartment.  There is a
 label on the knob.

 The time machine pings and clicks as the metal cools down.  You feel
 heat radiating from the machine.

 It reads:  -20, -10, 0, +10, +20.

 26/274 

 There are ten chapters and a full index.  Chapters 1 through 3 go into
 excruciating theoretical detail about time travel, and how it was
 discovered to be possible.  Chapters 4 through 6 go over the operation
 of this particular machine, with historical description of early
 prototypes, which apparently were invented years from now, if that
 makes any sense.  Chapters 7 through 10 are really a detailed appendix
 featuring technical schematics of how to build one of these from
 scratch.

 Maybe one of these days you'll build one just to see if it works,
 which is apparently what the author did.

>read chapter 4
 26/275 

 The manual is technical to the point of being over your head,
 involving seven-dimensional calculus and other intimidating
 mathematics.  Maybe if you had a few years to get up to speed, you
 might be able to understand its explanation of how this particular
 machine works, but not before then.  Your best bet is probably to look
 up specific subjects, like the knob or the button, in the index.

>look up knob in machine
 26/275 

 I don't see any machine here.

>look up knob in index
 26/276 

 The knob can be turned to one of five settings, indicating the desired
 jump in time relative to the machine's current time location.  See
 also:  label, red button, alert bulb.

>look up label in index
 26/277 

 The label describes the five settings of the knob.  A setting of 1
 indicates a jump twenty years into the past from the current position.
 A setting of 2 indicates a jump ten years into the past.  A setting of
 3 is a safety position, or "Off" setting, understood to mean a jump of
 zero time, neither forward nor backward.  A setting of 4 indicates a
 jump ten years into the future.  A setting of five indicates a jump
 twenty years into the future.  See also:  knob.

>look up button in index
 26/278 

 The time machine manual contains no information about that subject.

>look up red button in index
 26/279 

 After years of refinement, the operation of the time machine has been
 reduced to the simple push of a button.  Once the knob has been set,
 pushing the button will activate the machine.  However, if the machine
 attempts to make a jump beyond its imposed safety limit, the alert
 bulb will flash and no jump will occur.

 In addition, a safety feature is built into the machine which
 deactivates the button for a period of time after each time jump.  Due
 to the heat generated in the engine of the time machine, immediate
 successive jumps will cause its parts to fuse and become useless, a
 rather dangerous occurrence for a time traveller to face.  Therefore,
 the time machine must cool off before the button may be successfully
 pushed.  Fortunately, this only takes a few minutes (depending on the
 climate).  See also:  alert bulb, knob, platform.

>look up alert bulb in index
 26/280 

 For safety reasons, the time machine can be set to limit the maximum
 jumping distance.  The alert bulb will flash if the red button is
 pressed while the knob is set to jump beyond the imposed safety limit,
 and no jump will occur.  This safety limit cannot be changed except by
 dismantling the machine, which is forbidden due to the use of
 hazardous isotopes in the machine's engine.  See also:  red button,
 knob, label.

>look up platform in index
 26/281 

 Years of development have resulted in the successful manufacture of
 time machine units designed for small, short trips.  This engineering
 compaction has resulted in the proportionally scaled-down emission
 fields which allow the transportation of the machine and its contents
 intact through time.  If the machine is activated, anything that is
 not on the platform will not be transported.  It is vital that the
 person who activates the time machine be also standing on the
 platform, or he or she will have the unfortunate experience of seeing
 the unit disappear without them.  This is why solo travel is generally
 considered very dangerous.  See also:  red button.

 A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, a familiar
 landmark in an otherwise unfamiliar landscape.  Once nestled along a
 wooded path, it now is the sole feature of an eerily empty landscape,
 distorting your perceptions of scale and distance.  The broken remains
 of dark glass bottles lie around the base.  The rock itself looks
 darker than you remember it, somewhat blackened.  To the northeast is
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

 I see nothing special about the broken bottles.

>take glass
 36/337 

 There is no reason to touch the broken glass.

>examine rock
 36/338 

 The rock is a five foot grey boulder, almost egg-shaped, a single
 piece of heavy, textured granite.  Polished smooth over time, a wedge
 shape sheared from the top ages ago provides a comfortable place to
 sit.

 It is now darkened near the base, covered in a filmy black soot.
 Other marks, small circular burns that have left yellow drip-stains,
 are noticeable to the left and right of the sitting shelf.

 This is not your house as you expected to find it, but a scene of
 devastation.  The house has been destroyed by fire.  There is nothing
 left of the roof or the upper half, and of the lower half, merely
 charred timbers and twisted pipes that no longer lead to anything.  To
 the southwest is the old rock and, farther, the clearing.  You can
 walk around what's left of your house to the northwest and northeast.

 indicate years of neglect.  A pool of dirty yellow water trickles down
 from the driveway and collects, full of black silt, near where the

 An item in the business section catches your eye.  Apparently, the
 Lothario Corporation has failed to consume DibbleBits, an upstart
 technology company, in hostile takeover.  It seems DibbleBits is
 cash-rich right now, its stock value having taken a sudden 80-point
 jump in the last year, due to technology demand, after having
 languished at pennies-per-share for 30 years.

 The name of the paper is the same, but somehow it can't be the same

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Strip mall</span>
 The walk to town is much shorter, because progress seems to have
 brought the town to you.  Where there used to be some nice trees and
 bushes is a concrete strip-mall.  The old village square with the
 library, bank, and sandwich shop seems to have been mowed down to make
 way for this thing.  In fact, a sign here makes you think even this
 strip mall isn't long for this world.  Even the bank is gone, replaced
 by an impersonal automated teller machine (ATM).

 In the strip mall you see a number of vacant offices.  The only shop
 that seems to be open for business is an alabaster little store
 labelled "Locksmith," which is directly to the north.  The way back to
 your house is south.

 hard and flat and clean.  Your footpath leaves the clearing to the

 Okay, you're no longer on the time machine platform.  You maneuver the
 busted wheelbarrow off of the time machine platform and push it
 northeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 This little spot is one of your favorite places to sit and think.  A
 well-trod path winds through a natural grove of cedar and live oak
 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

 You see a busted wheelbarrow here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 You always thought this would be a nice place to plant a tree, but a
 bare spot reminds you of your lack of foresight.  The ground slopes
 down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story
 high because of it.  There is a tiny window high in the wall, about 30
 feet up.  A little path made by you on your many daily walks leads
 southwest into the woods.  You can walk around your house to the
 northwest and northeast.

 A squirrel is here.

 The squirrel paces around, turns, and paces some more.  Then he just
 kind of sits there.

 Definitely male, all right.  He's got a tuft of white hair on his head
 that almost gives him an Einstein-like appearance.  In his little paws
 is a big, juicy acorn.

 The north side of your house is dominated by your garage door.  The

 You always thought this would be a nice place to plant a tree, but a

 down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story

 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to

 the bottom takes a sudden drop.  Losing your balance, you slide under
 the water, pulled along by a deep current you didn't imagine was
 lurking under the still surface.

 Looking out through the water's surface, you see the sunlight
 disappear.  Air returns to your lungs just as the light goes away, and
 you feel your body sluicing down into groundwater caverns.

 When the motion stops, all you hear is the dripping of shallow water.
 You crawl forward and find a hard but dry spot.  It is not completely

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Limestone crawl</span>
 You are in a tiny crawlway carved by the flow of ancient waters
 through soft limestone.  The natural groundwater springs are drying
 up, and soon will be gone.  A current of dark but shallow water swirls
 nearby.  Light leaks down from a vertical sluice that leads up into

 all manner of jagged cracks, but you don't feel any shifting or
 settling.  Perhaps it is safe to continue, but probably not much

 The brightness coming from the bend in the tunnel to the north nearly
 distracts you from watching your footing.  The sharp echo of a
 carelessly kicked stone, that rattles down for ten or twelve seconds
 before coming to a splashing halt, stops you in your tracks.

 You are standing on a narrow ledge at the south end of a jagged
 east-west gap in the cave floor.  The gap plunges straight down,
 erosion having eaten everything away underneath.  It is not a wide
 gap, and you are capable of crossing it without difficulty.  However,
 you are aware that if you had stepped directly into it, your story
 would have ended here, in the darkness and the deep.  Across the gap,
 the tunnel goes north and takes another bend, and on this side it
 exits to the west.

 every direction.  A pool of white water catches the reflected and
 refracted light and spins it back into the room, where it is caught
 and re-refracted.  The original source of the light seems to be a
 series of pinholes in the roof of the cavern high above, but you don't
 think it could be sunlight.  You have lost track of how deep you have
 gone, perhaps twenty, perhaps forty feet under the surface, but too
 far down to see sunlight, you would have thought.  It is possible that
 sunlight has periscoped down a set of small crystal encrusted shafts
 that lead far enough up to see the open sky.  In any case, it is
 literally mesmerizing to be here.  The only exit is a tunnel to the
 west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark passage</span>
 The light you have been following darkens here, making you wonder how
 much faith you have in the ambiguous light source.  You can no longer
 make out any colors, only grainy shades of light and dark, but there
 wouldn't be many other colors to see even in full light.  The passage
 continues ahead, zigzagging to the northwest, and to the south.

>go south
 64/658 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crumbling tunnel</span>
 Eroding limestone has caused the floor here to give way recently.  You
 find your footing on the crumbling chunks of limestone, but only after
 making a scary drop of about four feet.  The walls of the tunnel sport
 all manner of jagged cracks, but you don't feel any shifting or
 settling.  Perhaps it is safe to continue, but probably not much
 farther.  The limestone shelf is up and back to the northwest.  The
 tunnel continues forward to the north, descending even further as it
 does so.

>go northwest
 64/659 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tight bend</span>
 The tunnel you have been following makes a tight bend here.  Chalky
 dust swirls in the damp air, stirred up by your arrival.  The crawl
 widens to the south, and turns here to the southeast, making a sudden
 drop as it does so.

>go south
 64/660 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narrow north-south crawl</span>
 You are in a narrow north-south crawlway that bulges slightly, giving
 you more room to maneuver.  The crawlway heads north and then bends,
 making it difficult to see farther ahead, and slopes downward to the
 south.

>go south
 64/661 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Limestone crawl</span>
 You are in a tiny crawlway carved by the flow of ancient waters
 through soft limestone.  The natural groundwater springs are drying
 up, and soon will be gone.  A current of dark but shallow water swirls
 nearby.  Light leaks down from a vertical sluice that leads up into
 the deep end of the grotto.  You can leave through careful navigation
 up the sluice, or follow the crawlway, which leads north.

>go up
 64/662 

 It's a somewhat torturous ascent, but with patience and resolve you
 manage to make your way up the sluice.  Your head again goes
 underwater for a moment, but you follow the light.  Your hands grope
 and find a hold on the shallow bottom of the pool.  Emerging, you
 shake yourself dry as best you can.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grotto</span>
 The multiverdant greenery fed by the churning stream seems to end here
 in a place of stillness and serenity surrounding a deep pool of clear
 water.  Even the very air itself seems to obey the call to quiet.  The
 only exit is northeast.

 You see a cold cut special, a frisbee, a penny, a cannonball, a big
 juicy acorn, and a divining wand here.

 The divining wand vibrates, pulling to the stream.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Flowing stream</span>
 The foliage parts at last to reveal a sparkling forest stream.  Light
 dapples gently through the leaves to highlight slick, wet rocks and
 the bright green of fresh growth.  The stream flows, about half a
 meter wide, from the north to the southwest.

 The divining wand vibrates, pulling to the stream.

>go north
 64/665 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 A natural path made by the stream winds through a natural grove of
 cedar and live oak trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground
 right in your way, and the stream does an abrupt curve around it.  The
 stream runs from the northeast to the south, and a clearing is visible
 to the southwest.

>go northeast
 64/666 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sloping wood</span>
 The ground slopes down here, eroded by the nearby stream.  Grasses
 heavy with fresh dew and spring-saturated soil give the area a soft,
 spongy feel beneath your feet.  The stream leads back southwest, and
 far ahead through the trees to the northeast, you can see a road of
 some kind.

 You see a soft spot here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Oakwood drive</span>
 This pleasant road wanders peacefully through the lush tree growths
 native to the area.  In the intervening years, they'll straighten the
 road and widen it, cutting down dozens of these thirty- to
 eighty-year-old live oaks.  The road leads north into the old shopping
 village, and a path winds back into the forest to the southwest.

>go north

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the village</span>
 The little shopping village looks a lot different than you're used to
 seeing it.  The sandwich shop is there, to the north, but it doesn't
 look like it's open for business yet.  To the west is the bank, which
 seems like it's always been here and always will.  To the east is an
 antique store, where the public library will be.  The road leading

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Antique store</span>
 Stocked full of knickknacks and ancient collectibles, this shop is
 pervaded by a rich, musty odor.  Taking a look around, you are
 somewhat ashamed to admit that you really can't tell one item from
 another.  None of it looks any more valuable or rare than the
 collection you keep heaped in your garage.  The only exit is west into
 the village.

 The antiques merchant is here, puttering around her shop.

 She says, "Good morning.  Feel free to browse around."

 You can hear the soft gurgling of a stream nearby, but the foliage is
 so rich and dense that the sound of it is dispersed.  You aren't sure
 from which direction it originates.  You can see your usual path

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Treetop</span>
 You're as high in the tree as your weight will let you climb.  The
 view from here is incredible.  The window in the side of the house is
 right in front of you to the north.

 You are surprised and somewhat amused to see the rare book nestled
 within the branches of the tree.  The squirrel must have been here
 recently.

>take book
 73/751 

 You retrieve the book from the branches.

>examine book
 73/752 

 A rare scientific volume, detailing the mating habits of small
 rodents.  It looks a bit -- how shall we say?  -- sullied, but is
 otherwise in fine condition.

 It's tantalizingly out of reach, but if you leap for it, you might
 just make it.

 The window is still a little too far away, I'm afraid.  I bet one more
 jug of miracle-grow would do the trick.  Maybe it's worth checking the
 work shed again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mid-way up tree</span>
 You are mid-way up the tree, which extends up another 15 feet.  A
 strong branch here extends horizontally from the trunk.  You can climb
 even farther up from here, or back down to the ground.

 You see a thick rope (tied to a tire swing and to a strong branch)
 here.

>go down
 73/756 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 The ground slopes down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms
 an extra story high because of it.  There is a tiny window high in the
 wall, about 30 feet up.  A little path made by you on your many daily
 walks leads southwest into the woods.  You can walk around your house
 to the northwest and northeast.

 A beautiful, leafy tree is growing here next to the house, right where
 you always thought it should.

 You see a tire swing here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 This little spot is one of your favorite places to sit and think.  A
 well-trod path winds through a natural grove of cedar and live oak
 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

>go southwest

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 The woods part in a marvelous natural clearing here.  Moonlight
 streams prettily through the canopy of leaves above.  The ground is
 hard and flat and clean.  Your footpath leaves the clearing to the
 northeast, heading back to the house.

 You see a time machine here.  The hinged compartment seems to contain
 the time machine manual.  Sitting on the time machine platform is a
 perfect blue crystal, a cold cut special, a frisbee, a penny, a
 cannonball, a divining wand, and a shovel.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 You are standing on what will be the south side of your house.  The
 house is currently under construction.  The wooden frame has gone up,
 but apart from that, there's not much to see.  The ground slopes down
 slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story high
 because of it.  A little bare path made by you just now leads
 southwest into the woods.  You can walk around the house to the
 northwest and northeast.  To the east is a dirt road leading to town.

 You see a sapling here.

 The sharp noise of nails being hammered into thick planks causes you
 to blink your eyes several times.

>examine sapling
 73/767 

 The meter-high sapling looks a little intimidated by all the wood
 being sawed and splintered nearby, but someone has taken the time to
 tie a bright ribbon to its slender trunk, as a warning to be careful
 of harming it.  Good thing, because it looks like it's going to be
 really gigantic one of these days.

 A young woman with a large box of wood screws rushes past, crying,
 "Coming!  Coming!"

 enthusiastic about seeing it now.  The wooden frame has gone up, but
 that is all there is to see.  However, there is something new to see,
 a temporary workshed built by the construction company.  The shed sits

 open.  You can enter the shed to the north.  The back of the house is

 Someone yells, "That's a riot!  Where's Ed?  He's gotta hear this!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside workshed</span>
 It's kind of hot and stuffy in here, during the heat of the day.  It

 that are locked in here at night must all be in use right now, because
 the shed is basically empty.  The only exit is south.

 You see a full jug of miracle-grow here.

 A huge dog is sitting here.

 He's some sort of vicious doberman with greasy black fur.  He's
 wearing a collar with a tag, so he's obviously not a stray.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Attic</span>
 This is a little attic space, barely tall enough for you to stand in.
 Thick boards run in parallel lines along the floor, with pink
 insulation laid out in between.  A thick brass pipe passes up from the
 floor next to the window and continues up through the ceiling.
 Cardboard packing boxes of various sizes are stacked along the walls.
 A folded-up ladder attached to a hatch would lead down if it were
 open, but it's closed.  The only exit is the little window you came
 in.

 You are surprised and somewhat amused to see the rare book nestled

 You retrieve the book from the branches.

 The window is still a little too far away, I'm afraid.  I bet one more

 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 You are standing on what will be the south side of your house.  The
 house is currently under construction.  The wooden frame has gone up,
 but apart from that, there's not much to see.  The ground slopes down
 slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story high
 because of it.  A little bare path made by you just now leads
 southwest into the woods.  You can walk around the house to the
 northwest and northeast.  To the east is a dirt road leading to town.

 You see a sapling here.

 The sharp noise of nails being hammered into thick planks causes you
 to blink your eyes several times.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Behind house</span>
 You are standing in what will be the back of your house.  If you
 thought it was boring to look at before, you couldn't possibly be less
 enthusiastic about seeing it now.  The wooden frame has gone up, but
 that is all there is to see.  However, there is something new to see,
 a temporary workshed built by the construction company.  The shed sits
 to the north.  You can walk around the house to the northeast and
 southeast.

 A young woman with a large box of wood screws rushes past, crying,
 "Coming!  Coming!"


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside workshed</span>
 The construction company has built a sturdy workshed on your property,
 apparently for the convenience of storing materials and tools during
 the job.  It is probably locked at night, but right now it is wide
 open.  You can enter the shed to the north.  The back of the house is
 to the south, and your driveway is east.

 A sweaty, red-faced man yells, "Where are my ducts?  Where are my
 flim-flanged ducts?"


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside workshed</span>
 It's kind of hot and stuffy in here, during the heat of the day.  It
 is also hard for your eyes to adjust to the darkness.  The materials
 that are locked in here at night must all be in use right now, because
 the shed is basically empty.  The only exit is south.

 (first getting off the platform)
 Okay, you're no longer on the time machine platform.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 A natural path made by the stream winds through a natural grove of
 cedar and live oak trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground
 right in your way, and the stream does an abrupt curve around it.  The
 stream runs from the northeast to the south, and a clearing is visible
 to the southwest.

>go northeast
 88/828 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sloping wood</span>
 The ground slopes down here, eroded by the nearby stream.  Grasses
 heavy with fresh dew and spring-saturated soil give the area a soft,
 spongy feel beneath your feet.  The stream leads back southwest, and
 far ahead through the trees to the northeast, you can see a road of
 some kind.

 You see a little mound of dirt and five empty jugs of miracle-grow
 here.

 There is nowhere to go in that direction.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Oakwood drive</span>
 This pleasant road wanders peacefully through the lush tree growths
 native to the area.  In the intervening years, they'll straighten the
 road and widen it, cutting down dozens of these thirty- to
 eighty-year-old live oaks.  The road leads north into the old shopping
 village, and a path winds back into the forest to the southwest.

>go north
 88/831 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the village</span>
 The little shopping village looks a lot different than you're used to
 seeing it.  The sandwich shop is there, to the north, but it doesn't
 look like it's open for business yet.  To the west is the bank, which
 seems like it's always been here and always will.  To the east is an
 antique store, where the public library will be.  The road leading
 back is south.

>go east
 88/832 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Antique store</span>
 Stocked full of knickknacks and ancient collectibles, this shop is
 pervaded by a rich, musty odor.  Taking a look around, you are
 somewhat ashamed to admit that you really can't tell one item from
 another.  None of it looks any more valuable or rare than the
 collection you keep heaped in your garage.  The only exit is west into
 the village.

 The antiques merchant is here, puttering around her shop.

 She says, "Good morning.  Feel free to browse around."

>sell cannonball
 88/832 

 (to the merchant)
 The merchant gives the cannonball the once-over with her keen pair of
 eyeballs.

 The merchant says, "Say, this cannonball is in good shape.  I'll give
 you $35 for it.  Deal?"

>yes
 88/833 

 The merchant tucks the cannonball away into a back room, then returns
 and hands you the money.

 The merchant says, "All righty.  Here you are.  Thank you."

 You somehow gather all of your money together along with the new cash.

 [It is now in your hands, and not where you last left it.  Presto!]

 through the canopy of leaves above.  The ground is hard and flat and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 This little spot is one of your favorite places to sit and think.  A
 well-trod path winds through a natural grove of cedar and live oak
 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 The ground slopes down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms
 an extra story high because of it.  There is a tiny window high in the
 wall, about 30 feet up.  There is a rope dangling from the window.  A
 little path made by you on your many daily walks leads southwest into
 the woods.  You can walk around your house to the northwest and
 northeast.

 A beautiful, leafy tree is growing here next to the house, right where
 you always thought it should.

 You see a tire here.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Behind house</span>
 The back of your house is pretty non-descript, except for some really
 nice trees that make up for the lack of landscaping in the front.  The
 spout of your drainpipe comes down here from the roof.  A gravel path
 extends northeast and southeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the garage</span>
 This room is a total mess.  No wonder you keep your car in the
 driveway.  Sure enough, it took a long time to sort through the junk
 in here, and you have found everything including the kitchen sink, and
 there still doesn't seem to have been much point to it.  There is a
 garage door button on the wall.  A closed door to the south leads into
 your house through the kitchen.  The only other exit is the way you
 came in, which is open.

 You see an opener button, a wasp nest, a moose head trophy, a beat-up
 mattress, and the kitchen sink here.

 In the busted wheelbarrow you see a car key, a garage door opener, a
 school pencil, a can of WD-40, a deflated soccer ball, a broken tire
 pump, a 2x4 plank, a can-opener, a crowbar, a paper napkin, a biology
 book, a newspaper, a motorized grinder, and an old tennis ball.

 I know what you're thinking -- you can pump up the soccer ball with

 A World Cup fan you aren't.  This thing is in sorry shape.

 It's faded to a pale whitish green over the years, and it's sticky

 Idaho, that made lifetime guarantees for their lightning rods.  Back

 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 The ground slopes down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms
 an extra story high because of it.  There is a tiny window high in the
 wall, about 30 feet up.  There is a rope dangling from the window.  A
 little path made by you on your many daily walks leads southwest into
 the woods.  You can walk around your house to the northwest and
 northeast.

 A beautiful, leafy tree is growing here next to the house, right where
 you always thought it should.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of house</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of house</span>
 The north side of your house is dominated by your garage door.  The

 house.  The driveway extends east, and a small path leads southeast to
 the front of the house and southwest to the back.

 You see a busted wheelbarrow here.

>look in barrow
 88/926 

 In the busted wheelbarrow you see a car key, a garage door opener, a
 school pencil, a can of WD-40, a deflated soccer ball, a broken tire
 pump, a 2x4 plank, a can-opener, a crowbar, a paper napkin, a biology
 book, a newspaper, a motorized grinder, and an old tennis ball.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sloping wood</span>
 The ground slopes down here, eroded by the nearby stream.  Grasses
 heavy with fresh dew and spring-saturated soil give the area a soft,
 spongy feel beneath your feet.  The stream leads back southwest, and

 The little shopping village looks a lot different than you're used to

 look like it's open for business yet.  To the west is the bank, which
 seems like it's always been here and always will.  To the east is an

 Stocked full of knickknacks and ancient collectibles, this shop is
 pervaded by a rich, musty odor.  Taking a look around, you are
 somewhat ashamed to admit that you really can't tell one item from
 another.  None of it looks any more valuable or rare than the
 collection you keep heaped in your garage.  The only exit is west into
 the village.

 You see a lightning rod, a metal suitcase, and a busted wheelbarrow
 here.

 The antiques merchant is here, puttering around her shop.

 The merchant greets you with a smile and a pair of raised eyebrows as
 you enter.  "Back again, are we?" she says.

 You notice that her gaze was drawn straight to your creaky old
 wheelbarrow the moment you wheeled the thing in.  She eyes it up and
 down with interest.

>sell barrow

 The merchant gives it a quick once-over with her expertly trained
 eyeballs.

 The merchant says, "Say, this wheelbarrow is as ancient as Methuselah.
 But the front wheel's shot.  It'd be worth more if it were fixed.
 I'll give you $35 for it.  Deal?"

 The merchant pulls the wheelbarrow over to one side of the shop and
 says, "All righty.  Here you are.  Thank you."

 A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, a familiar

 It is now darkened near the base, covered in a filmy black soot.
 Other marks, small circular burns that have left yellow drip-stains,

 branches of the large tree you planted, as it too has been consumed
 from the top down.  What remains of its upper trunk has broken from

 Sadly, you can exit in any direction.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 The woods part in a marvelous natural clearing here.  Moonlight
 streams prettily through the canopy of leaves above.  The ground is
 hard and flat and clean.  Your footpath leaves the clearing to the
 northeast, heading back to the house.

 You see a time machine here.  The hinged compartment seems to contain
 the time machine manual.  Sitting on the time machine platform is a
 perfect blue crystal, a penny, a shovel, a rare book, a tourist map,
 and a desk lamp.

 (first getting off the platform)
 Okay, you're no longer on the time machine platform.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Path in the woods</span>
 This little spot is one of your favorite places to sit and think.  A
 well-trod path winds through a natural grove of cedar and live oak
 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

>go northeast
 88/1012 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 The ground slopes down slightly here, and the wall of the house looms
 an extra story high because of it.  There is a tiny window high in the
 wall, about 30 feet up.  There is a rope dangling from the window.  A
 little path made by you on your many daily walks leads southwest into
 the woods.  You can walk around your house to the northwest and
 northeast.

 A beautiful, leafy tree is growing here next to the house, right where
 you always thought it should.

 You see a tire here.

>go northeast
 88/1013 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of house</span>
 This is the front of your house.  A couple of stones lying about make
 up your half-hearted attempt at landscaping.  Your driveway is to the
 northeast.  A small path leads northwest and southwest.  The front
 door stands invitingly to the west.

 You see a doormat here.

>read doormat
 88/1014 

 It reads, "Welcome."  The irony of it leaves a bad taste in your
 mouth.

>go northwest
 88/1015 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of house</span>
 The north side of your house is dominated by your garage door.  The
 garage door is open.  A scaled stone wall runs up the side of the
 house.  The driveway extends east, and a small path leads southeast to
 the front of the house and southwest to the back.

 You see a car key, a garage door opener, a school pencil, a can of
 WD-40, a deflated soccer ball, a broken tire pump, a 2x4 plank, a
 can-opener, a crowbar, a paper napkin, a biology book, a newspaper, a
 motorized grinder, and an old tennis ball here.  The motorized grinder
 seems to contain a blank.

>examine grinder
 88/1016 

 The device is pretty simple:  you put a master key and a blank into
 the grinder, turn it on, and the lathe cuts the blank into a
 duplicate.  A black, heavy-duty electrical cord with a plug at the end
 trails out the back.  The thick black cord is dangling from the back
 of the motorized grinder.  In the motorized grinder you see a blank.

>examine pump
 88/1017 

 I know what you're thinking -- you can pump up the soccer ball with
 this baby.  Nope.  It's just a piece of junk.

>examine can opener

 I don't see any can opener here.

>examine can-opener

>examine soccer ball
 88/1019 

 A World Cup fan you aren't.  This thing is in sorry shape.

>examine tennis ball
 88/1020 

 It's faded to a pale whitish green over the years, and it's sticky
 with mud and rotten leaves.  You must have lost it during an exuberant
 game of catch some years ago.

>go south
 88/1021 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the garage</span>
 This room is a total mess.  No wonder you keep your car in the
 driveway.  Sure enough, it took a long time to sort through the junk
 in here, and you have found everything including the kitchen sink, and
 there still doesn't seem to have been much point to it.  There is a
 garage door button on the wall.  A closed door to the south leads into
 your house through the kitchen.  The only other exit is the way you
 came in, which is open.

 You see an opener button, a wasp nest, a beat-up mattress, and the
 kitchen sink here.

>examine kitchen door

 The woods surround you on all sides, although there is enough space

 through the canopy of leaves above.  The ground is hard and flat and
 clean.

 You can hear the soft gurgling of a stream nearby, but the foliage is
 so rich and dense that the sound of it is dispersed.  You aren't sure

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sloping wood</span>
 The ground slopes down here, eroded by the nearby stream.  Grasses
 heavy with fresh dew and spring-saturated soil give the area a soft,
 spongy feel beneath your feet.  The stream leads back southwest, and
 far ahead through the trees to the northeast, you can see a road of
 some kind.

 You see a little mound of dirt and five empty jugs of miracle-grow
 here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Oakwood drive</span>
 This pleasant road wanders peacefully through the lush tree growths
 native to the area.  In the intervening years, they'll straighten the

 eighty-year-old live oaks.  The road leads north into the old shopping
 village, and a path winds back into the forest to the southwest.

>go north
 88/1041 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the village</span>
 The little shopping village looks a lot different than you're used to
 seeing it.  The sandwich shop is there, to the north, but it doesn't
 look like it's open for business yet.  To the west is the bank, which
 seems like it's always been here and always will.  To the east is an
 antique store, where the public library will be.  The road leading
 back is south.

>go east
 88/1042 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Antique store</span>
 Stocked full of knickknacks and ancient collectibles, this shop is
 pervaded by a rich, musty odor.  Taking a look around, you are
 somewhat ashamed to admit that you really can't tell one item from
 another.  None of it looks any more valuable or rare than the
 collection you keep heaped in your garage.  The only exit is west into
 the village.

 You see a lightning rod, a metal suitcase, and a wheelbarrow here.

 The antiques merchant is here, puttering around her shop.

 She says, "Good morning.  Feel free to browse around."

 serves, apparently, as an excuse for people to litter, as it is full

 The north side of your house is dominated by your garage door.  The
 garage door is open.  A scaled stone wall runs up the side of the
 house.  The driveway extends east, and a small path leads southeast to
 the front of the house and southwest to the back.

 You see a garage door opener, a school pencil, a can of WD-40, a
 deflated soccer ball, a broken tire pump, a 2x4 plank, a can-opener, a

 This room is a total mess.  No wonder you keep your car in the
 driveway.  Sure enough, it took a long time to sort through the junk
 in here, and you have found everything including the kitchen sink, and
 there still doesn't seem to have been much point to it.  There is a
 garage door button on the wall.  A closed door to the south leads into
 your house through the kitchen.  The only other exit is the way you
 came in, which is open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 You are standing on what will be the south side of your house.  The
 house is currently under construction.  The wooden frame has gone up,
 but apart from that, there's not much to see.  The ground slopes down
 slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story high
 because of it.  A little bare path made by you just now leads
 southwest into the woods.  You can walk around the house to the
 northwest and northeast.  To the east is a dirt road leading to town.

 A beefy blond man waddles past, blowing his nose ferociously into the
 sleeve of his shirt.

>go north

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside house</span>
 You finally step into your house.  Not much of a victory, given the
 circumstances.  Just a lot of planks and rafters.  A temporary work
 ladder is nailed into the structure, and leads up to the second floor.

 You see a screwdriver here.

 Someone yells, "Fifteen!  Fifteen, everybody!"
 Someone yells back, "You got that right!"

 A young woman with a pile of floor tiles rushes past, crying, "Who
 ordered these?"

>go up
 88/1148 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Second floor</span>
 The description 'second floor' is misleading, because the floor up
 here isn't actually finished, so watch your step.  From up here you
 see a nice view of the town square down the road.  There is a fancy
 blueprint of the house sitting on a temporary workdesk.  The only exit
 is down.  Sitting on the workdesk is a blueprint.

 The architect is here, frowning over the blueprint.

 A guy clambers down from above and yells, "Let's eat!".

>examine blueprint
 88/1149 

 It's a lovely floor plan, rendered impeccably with blue pencil.  The
 name of the architect is stenciled in the top corner.

 Someone rushes up to you, looks you up and down, and then shakes his
 head and runs off.

>examine architect
 88/1150 

 The architect is a brilliant craftsman, in his own way.  You can tell
 just by looking at him.  He must be in his early forties, with
 slightly peppery hair at the sideburns.  His eyes are deep and
 intelligent, and his shoulders are already rounded from years of
 hunching over drafting tables.

 The lunchtime whistle blows shrilly.

 All of the workers cry, "LUNCH!"  They drop what they're doing and
 gather north of the house to start eating.  The architect looks up and
 says, "Oh sure.  They get a lunch break.  They always get a lunch
 break.  But me?  Do I get one?  Noooo..."

 His stomach rumbling, he grimaces and goes back to work.

>ask architect about lunch
 88/1151 

 He says, "Mmmm, lunch would really hit the spot right now, but I have
 to work straight through.  I could really go for a nice big sandwich."
 He sighs and goes back to work.

>ask architect about blueprint
 88/1152 

 He frowns at it.  "There's something missing.  Ah well, it's what you
 asked for."

>ask architect about lightning rod
 88/1153 

 He says, "Hmmm.  You really have a good memory for details, but the
 installation of a lightning rod is more your personal business as the
 owner of the house than it is mine."

 He pauses and rubs his eyes blearily.  "However, I suppose that if you
 were to give me a lightning rod, I would tell the men to attach it
 after they finish the roofing.  It is a safety concern, especially
 when that tree at the south of the house grows up.  If it gets big
 enough, it'll be its own lightning rod, after all."

>ask architect about front door key
 88/1154 

 He says, "Don't be silly.  We haven't even installed the front door
 yet.  How can you have a key for it?"

>ask architect about blue pencil
 88/1155 

 He says, "Blue pencils, yes.  For drawing on blueprints, yes.  I
 already have my own, thank you."

>draw on blueprint with blue pencil
 88/1156 

 As you lean in with the blue pencil, the architect harumphs and nudges
 you back.  You might have to wait for him to be somewhere else in
 order to change the blueprint.

>ask architect about batpole

 I don't know the word "batpole".

 trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground right in your way, so
 the path does an abrupt curve around it.  The path leads northeast to
 your house, and a clearing is visible to the southwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clearing</span>
 The woods part in a marvelous natural clearing here.  Moonlight
 streams prettily through the canopy of leaves above.  The ground is
 hard and flat and clean.  Your footpath leaves the clearing to the
 northeast, heading back to the house.

 You see a time machine here.  The hinged compartment seems to contain
 the time machine manual.  Sitting on the time machine platform is a
 penny, a shovel, a tourist map, a desk lamp, and a tire.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woods</span>
 The smell of freshly-sawed wood wafts through this natural grove of
 cedar and live oak trees.  A large rock juts up out of the ground
 right in your way.  A construction site is to the northeast, and a
 clearing is visible to the southwest.

>go northeast
 88/1190 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of house</span>
 You are standing on what will be the south side of your house.  The
 house is currently under construction.  The wooden frame has gone up,
 but apart from that, there's not much to see.  The ground slopes down
 slightly here, and the wall of the house looms an extra story high
 because of it.  A little bare path made by you just now leads
 southwest into the woods.  You can walk around the house to the
 northwest and northeast.  To the east is a dirt road leading to town.

 You see a sapling here.

>go north
 88/1191 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside house</span>
 You finally step into your house.  Not much of a victory, given the
 circumstances.  Just a lot of planks and rafters.  A temporary work
 ladder is nailed into the structure, and leads up to the second floor.

>go up
 88/1192 


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Second floor</span>
 The description 'second floor' is misleading, because the floor up
 here isn't actually finished, so watch your step.  From up here you
 see a nice view of the town square down the road.  There is a fancy
 blueprint of the house sitting on a temporary workdesk.  The only exit
 is down.  Sitting on the workdesk is a blueprint.

 The architect is here, frowning over the blueprint.

 He says, "Gee, thanks.  Just what I was in the mood for."  He starts

 it like this.  I don't suppose you can heat it up first? Thanks."

 The clearing here is desolate, giving the distinct impression that all
 natural life has left this area.  The ground is hard and overgrown by

 where once they stood.  Your old footpath is nowhere to be seen.  You
 do see your house to the northeast, but it too looks abandoned.
