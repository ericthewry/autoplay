 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this
 neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are
 charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of
 every restaurant in your district.

 Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you
 take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.
 Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.

 A hazy sun barely peeks above the three-story tenements.

 19th Street
 You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.
 A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.
 The front entrance is north of you.

 The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of
 crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with
 broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.
 A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see
 no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

>examine newspaper
 The newspaper scrap is worn and damp, rendering it almost unreadable.

>examine placard
 An aluminum placard, printed in red, is fixed to the front door.

>read it
 You read: (in big red letters) CLOSED

>examine gutter
 The gutter is designed to carry storm water off the road.  It extends
 west and east.

 In storm gutter is some broken glass.

>examine me
 You are the city health inspector, looking quite natty in your
 polyester shirt and vintage knit tie.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a notepad

>examine notepad
 This notebook is for recording health code violations when you inspect
 a restaurant.  Nikolai's is likely to have a number of infractions.
 To record them, "note [something]".  Later in the day, back at the
 office, you will refer to these notes to write your official report.

 Afflicted
 A short work of interactive horror
 Copyright 2008, Doug Egan
 Annual Competition Version

 This game is intended to be enjoyed by both newcomers to IF and
 veteran players.  If you have never played interactive fiction, you
 are encouraged to return to the main menu and review the information
 under "General Instructions".

 Afflicted implements only a select number of new verbs.  The most
 important of these is the action "note".  Other changes should be
 obvious within the context of the game. "Ask" and "Tell" are synonyms
 in this game. Likewise "Give" and "Show". On the other hand, "Read"
 and "Examine" may give different responses for readable material.

 The "Smell" action is fully implemented.  Each location has a unique
 odor.  A small number of individual objects also have their own odor.

 type "Hint" to access the adaptive hint menu.

 It is possible to end a game prematurely, sometimes in ways which can
 not be reversed by a single "undo" command.  Players are encouraged to
 save often and search for multiple alternate endings.

 19th Street
 You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.
 A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.
 The front entrance is north of you.

 The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of
 crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with
 broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.
 A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see
 no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

>note broken glass
 You see nothing noteworthy about the broken glass.

>go east

 19th Street East
 A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the
 bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west
 of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk
 is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm
 drain.

>examine drain
 The openings in the storm drain are barely wide enough to insert three
 fingers.  You'll have to search more carefully to see what lies below.

>search drain
 Staring up at you, from a few inches below the grate, are a pair of
 eyes.

>examine eye
 On careful examination, the eyes are dismembered.  They float in a
 dark pool several inches beneath the grate.

>note eyes
 The pair of eyes are likely evidence of a ghastly crime, but you
 falter when trying to assign it as a particular health code violation
 in your notebook.

>examine sidewalk
 The sidewalk buckles to such a degree, one might think it had been hit
 by an earthquake.

>examine window
 The window is marked by dozens of greasy finger prints and years of
 accumulated scratch marks.  It should certainly be cleaned, if not
 replaced.  But you can still see through well enough.

>note window
 You write, "Exterior windows are filthy-- should be cleaned." in the
 notebook.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]

>look through window
 Through the window you see the Bar.

 A trapezoid of light falls on the cork dance floor.

 Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In
 the rinse basin is some ice.

 A middle-aged woman, slight in build, is seated at the bar counter.
 She has fallen fast asleep.

 You also see a stereo.

>examine woman
 Angela is Nikolai's day shift waitress.  She doesn't have the
 endurance any longer to work the night shift.  Angela is a thin woman
 not quite 50 with salt and pepper gray hair.  Her skin is pale as a
 ghost.  She is asleep.

>poke Angela
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine stereo
 The stereo is one of those big, barely portable, over-the-shoulder
 models popular back in the day when Michael Jackson was undergoing his
 first plastic surgery.  This one is held together by duct tape and
 wire.  One of the bartenders probably brought it in to entertain
 themselves during the slow periods.

 The stereo is switched off.

>wake woman
 You knock.  Angela wakes, looking startled.  When she sees you
 motioning at the window, she stands.

>note stereo
 You can only look from this distance.

 Angela moves to the dining room.

>go west

 19th Street
 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

 Angela opens the door.

>in
 You can't go that way.

>go north

 Dining Room
 The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a
 dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A
 larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.
 A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office
 loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his
 office entrance.

 On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive
 view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

 An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.

 "Who's there?  Tell him we're closed" Nikolai growls in disgust.

 Angela cowers, "I think he's the man from the health department."  She
 looks at you "We're not open right now."

 Nikolai growls again, "We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell
 him to go away."  Without waiting for an answer from either you or
 Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.

 Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped three points.]

>score
 Nikolai's Bar and Grill has earned a sanitation rating of -5, so far.

>tell angela about me
 Angela says, "You seem like sharp young fellow.  Maybe Nikolai would
 let you work in the restaurant."

 Angela takes a short break.

>examine angela
 Angela is Nikolai's day shift waitress.  She doesn't have the
 endurance any longer to work the night shift.  Angela is a thin woman
 not quite 50 with salt and pepper gray hair.  Her skin is pale as a
 ghost.

 Angela says, "You mustn't take Nikolai too seriously.  He's really a
 very good man.  It's just... he acts kind of grumpy sometimes because
 of his affliction.

>ask angela about affliction
 Angela whispers, "When Nikolai started gaining a lot of weight, about
 fifteen years ago, his doctor diagnosed him with the affliction.  You
 know, that blood sugar disease?  He takes insulin for it, I think."

 Angela begins wiping tables.

>ask angela about diabetes
 "Right, that's the name of Nikolai's affliction."

 Angela is pausing to rest.  Nikolai pokes his head out of his office
 momentarily to shout, "If there's time to lean, there's time to
 clean".

>ask angela about restaurant
 "Nikolai only pays the cooks five dollars an hour.  They don't use
 recipes, because they can't read."

>examine tables
 The tables are four tops.  None of twelve tables have been cleaned
 since last night.

>note tables
 You write, "Dining room tables require cleaning." in the notebook.

 Angela begins sweeping the floor.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]

>examine floor
 (the cork dance floor)
 The dance floor isn't very large but you imagine it doesn't need to
 be.  People don't come to Nikolai's to dance.  They come to get
 soused.  The floor is discolored by water marks and mold.

>note floor

 You can only look from this distance.

>note mold

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

 About twelve tables are closely spaced within the small location.

 Dozens of identical chairs are pushed snug against the four top
 tables.
 You also see yourself.

 The window is marked by dozens of greasy finger prints and years of
 accumulated scratch marks.  It should certainly be cleaned, if not
 replaced.  But you can still see through well enough.

 Angela begins wiping tables.

 Nikolai helped me to escape.  I've been working for him ever since."

 Angela giggles nervously, "You know, English is my second language."

>go east

 Bar
 Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid
 across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls
 of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you
 don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the
 west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling
 tunnel.

 A set of Naugahyde stools are pushed against the linoleum bar.

 Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In
 the rinse basin is some ice.

 Beside the sink is a personal stereo (held together largely with duct
 tape).

>examine stereo
 The stereo is one of those big, barely portable, over-the-shoulder
 models popular back in the day when Michael Jackson was undergoing his

 themselves during the slow periods.

 The stereo is switched off.

>note stereo
 You see nothing noteworthy about the stereo.

>smell
 The odor of stale beer and sweat threatens to overwhelm you.  You
 imagine it must smell even worse when the local mill workers are
 packed in here during happy hour.

>examine sink
 The twin basins of the stainless steel sink (a wash basin and rinse
 basin) are scarcely large enough to wash a pilsner glass.

>look in wash basin
 The wash basin is empty.

>look in rinse basin
 In the rinse basin is some ice.

>examine ice
 Rounded chips of melting ice drain in the sink.  The pile of ice has a
 red streak through its center.  Sloe Gin, or perhaps grenadine would
 make that color streak.

>search ice
 While sifting through the ice in the rinse basin, you pause in horror.
 Buried near the drain is a severed human hand.

>note hand
 (the severed left hand)
 The severed left hand is likely evidence of a ghastly crime, but you
 falter when trying to assign it as a particular health code violation
 in your notebook.

>examine hand
 (the severed left hand)
 The hand is pale and cold as ice.  It is cut cleanly at the wrist, as
 if by a cleaver.  The hand appears to be human.  It appears to be the
 real thing.

 The beet red Naugahyde stools are torn, revealing the rotting yellow
 foam beneath.

 You write, "Dance floor covered with carcinogenic mold-- apply
 fungicide." in the notebook.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]

 Creeping shadows fall everywhere, creating a sensation of permanent
 dusk.

 The faucet is turned off, though it drips intermittently.

 You write, "Replace bar sink with something larger.  And clean the
 damn thing." in the notebook.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]

>turn off faucet
 The faucet continues to drip.

>examine bar
 Which do you mean, the linoleum counter or the bar stool?

>examine counter
 The bar's linoleum counter top is green, with a marbelesque pattern.
 Brown stains give it the appearance of a rotted apple.

>note faucet
 You've already got a related note about the sink.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to turn the stereo.

 Lavatory
 The low ceiling restroom is painted yellow, the color of urine and
 bile.  Its only fixtures are a porcelain toilet, hand sink, soap
 dispenser and automatic hand dryer, all mounted low to the floor as if
 they were reclaimed from an abandoned grade school, or this lavatory
 was designed for alcoholic ten-year-olds.

 A Jackson Pollack pattern of vomit is splashed across the back wall of
 the bathroom, certainly nowhere near the toilet where it was
 presumably aimed.

 You hear a mouse scurrying through the wall.

>note mouse
 You write, "Call exterminator." in the notebook.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]

>note vomit
 You write, "Please, please, please, clean the barf off the bathroom
 wall." in the notebook.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped two points.]

 The bilious material was probably spewed there last night after a few
 rounds of drinks.  It is now dried, with undigested lumps of green
 pepper and onion plastered in place.  Remains of a cheese steak
 sandwich, maybe?

>examine toilet
 (the toilet)
 The toilet has a five (possibly ten or fifteen) gallon tank.  Who knew
 that such monumental water guzzlers still existed?  But the size of
 the tank is less your concern than contents of the basin.  A massive
 quantity of shit and toilet paper threaten to overflow the rim.  This
 toilet probably hasn't been flushed since yesterday's happy hour.

 A tiny brown mouse dashes out of view.

 there.

 This stainless steel automatic hand dryer is the same model that was
 common in American service station restrooms half a century ago.  A
 silver button in front invites you to push it.

 The hand dryer is switched off.

 Dining Room
 The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a
 dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A
 larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.
 A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office
 loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his
 office entrance.

 On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive
 view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.

 Nikolai pokes his head out from the top office, "Angela, be a peach
 and pick up some bread from the food pantry."

 Angela looks puzzled "You mean the 5th Avenue Mission?"

 "Of course that's where I mean.  Our regular bread company won't
 deliver here anymore.  Just go to the food pantry and fill up your
 car."

 "I can't take food from a homeless shelter."

 Nikolai's face turns red, "We need bread, and you can get it free from
 the mission.  Tell them you're a homeless wench.  Tell them you've got
 twelve screaming brats to feed.  I don't care.  If you won't go there,
 then go to the store and pay for the bread with your own money, but
 don't come back without it!"

 Angela lowers her head.  She looks like she's about to cry.

 As Angela leaves the restaurant, you notice a small flashlight fall
 off of her key chain.

 Galley Kitchen
 You are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide
 enough for one person to turn around.  On the south side facing the
 dining room is a wooden prep table.  On the left end of the prep table
 is a mini fridge, and on the right end is a steam table.

 Opposite the prep table is a flat grill.  Dried rivulets of grease
 ooze down the wall from the overhead vents.  A narrow aisle winds
 north into darkness.

>note grease
 You've already made enough observations to have Nikolai's place
 condemned.  One more note is just another nail in the coffin.

 You write, "Use a grill brick to clean the flat grill." in the

>examine prep table
 This prep table looks like it may have been nailed together on site,
 from two by fours and plywood.  The cutting surface is scarred with
 knife marks and grime, providing multiple rich environments for
 bacterial growth.  Beneath the  prep table is a storage shelf.

 Galley Kitchen
 You are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide
 enough for one person to turn around.  On the south side facing the
 dining room is a wooden prep table.  On the left end of the prep table

 Winding Hall
 A narrow hall twists and winds from the prep kitchen (south) to the
 dish room (north).  A walk-in refrigerator is west of here.  During
 every dinner shift, smoke from the kitchen drifts down this hall and
 deposits an oily film against the brown wall.

 Mounted on the wall is a first aid kit.

 A formidable buffalo chopper is parked against one corner of this
 twisting labyrinth. This machine probably harbors more than a hundred
 varieties of pathogens and therefore deserves quite careful attention.

>examine chopper
 The chopper is old, covered in rust.  Drops of fresh blood leak out
 from the food trough in places where it has rusted completely through.
 The device has an on/off button, and the rotating trough which is
 designed to carry large volumes of food past a stationary blade.  It
 isn't quite large enough to accommodate a full size buffalo.  But a
 rabbit or a small dog, perhaps.

 The buffalo chopper is switched off.

>examine trough
 The trough is circular, pocked with rust, and contains some variety of
 ground meat.  Only about a third of the trough is visible.  The rest
 is hidden beneath a cover which protects you from the blade in back.

 In the trough is ground meat.

 The crib is painted blue.  It appears to be hand-made.

>go east

 19th Street
 You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.
 A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.
 The front entrance is north of you.

 The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of
 crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with
 broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.
 A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see
 no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

>examine awning
 The green awning is made of canvas.  It's faded and torn from age, and
 has hand painted letters across the front.

>note awning
 You see nothing noteworthy about the green awning.

>read it
 Faded yellow letters across the awning once said "Nikolai's Bar and
 Grill", though a more recent graffiti artist has replaced the last two
 letters in black spray paint to read "Nikolai's Bar and Grist".  A
 more appropriate moniker, perhaps.

>examine neon
 A thin tube of glowing red neon curls around itself to form words.
 The light flickers on and off erratically.  Just looking at it is
 almost seizure inducing.  It says, "Hanibal's Exotic Revue."

>go south
 All your business is on the north side of the street.  Finish your
 inspection so you can go home.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't go that way.

 19th Street East
 A street-front window looks into Nikolai's bar.  If you want into the
 bar, you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west
 of here.  There are no cars on this end of 19th Street.  The sidewalk
 is uneven.  A curb-side storm gutter empties here into a grated storm
 drain.

>go east
 You probably shouldn't wander too far from your car.  Go finish your
 inspection at Nikolai's so you can leave this god-forsaken
 neighborhood.

 All your business is on the north side of the street.  Finish your

>examine crabgrass
 Everywhere the sidewalk is broken, crabgrass grows tenaciously.

>search it
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine cars
 There are a small number of cars parked nearby, some likely abandoned.
 One has been locked with the boot.

>examine boot
 A boot is a device used by the police to lock cars which have accrued
 too many unpaid fines.  The boot is secured to one of the the car's
 tires, and is less expensive than having the car towed.  Fortunately
 parking violations are outside your jurisdiction, and your position as
 a city health inspector enables you to park in many locations for
 free.

>search car
 Your car is empty.

 Dining Room
 The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a
 dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A
 larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.
 A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office
 loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his
 office entrance.

 On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive
 view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

>go east

 Bar
 Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid
 across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls
 of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you
 don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the
 west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling
 tunnel.

 A set of Naugahyde stools are pushed against the linoleum bar.

 Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In
 the rinse basin is a severed left hand.

 Beside the sink is a personal stereo (held together largely with duct
 tape).

 Galley Kitchen
 You are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide
 enough for one person to turn around.  On the south side facing the
 dining room is a wooden prep table.  On the left end of the prep table
 is a mini fridge, and on the right end is a steam table.

 Opposite the prep table is a flat grill.  Dried rivulets of grease
 ooze down the wall from the overhead vents.  A narrow aisle winds
 north into darkness.

>open fridge
 The fridge is a few degrees colder than the rest of the room.  It
 contains a rotting head of lettuce.

>close fridge
 You close the mini fridge.

>go north

 Winding Hall
 A narrow hall twists and winds from the prep kitchen (south) to the
 dish room (north).  A walk-in refrigerator is west of here.  During
 every dinner shift, smoke from the kitchen drifts down this hall and
 deposits an oily film against the brown wall.

 Mounted on the wall is a first aid kit.

 A formidable buffalo chopper is parked against one corner of this
 twisting labyrinth. This machine probably harbors more than a hundred
 varieties of pathogens and therefore deserves quite careful attention.

>go west

 Refrigerator
 Nikolai's walk-in refrigerator is kept at a few degrees above zero
 Celsius.  The tight dimensions of this poorly lit unit induce a sense
 of claustrophobia.  The textured metal walls are splashed with now dry
 remnants of long ago dinner specials.  The exit back to the winding
 hall is east.

 A five gallon soup cauldron is pushed carelessly into one corner.

 A four tier wire shelf supports an assortment of hotel pans in varied
 sizes and depths.

 A mouse runs in circles, then races away.

>open cauldron
 You open the soup cauldron, revealing a severed left foot.

>go north

 Dish Room
 On entering the dish room you are overwhelmed by the astringent smell
 of fresh bleach.  You would welcome this as evidence of sanitation,
 except that in such high concentrations bleach is actually toxic.
 Already you're feeling a little nauseous.  A hall winds south into the
 darkness.

 You step cautiously around the open drain cover.

 A warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is
 sealed tight.

 The largest fixture in this location is a straight unit dish machine,
 with a stainless steel dish table on either side.

 On the dish table is a dish rack (in which are some servingware).

 A large rat turns to look at you, then runs away.

>examine servingware
 Plates, cups, saucers and silverware populate the dish rack.  None of
 it looks as if it has been cleaned recently.

>go down

 Crypt
 The edges and corners of this brown room are rounded by accumulated
 cobweb nets, making it look more like a small cave than an urban
 underground.  Moldy pylons and concrete extrusions resemble
 stalagmites.  Wet cardboard boxes stacked along the wall contain empty
 unrecycled liquor bottles.  The humid air smells of death.

 You could escape through the drain pipe in the ceiling.

 At the center of the room is a three foot by six foot crate, composed
 mostly of particle board. A mutilated corpse lies in state.

>put eyes in sockets
 You slip each eye into its socket with a plop.  The eyes rotate around
 independently until they are both pointing directly toward you.  Her
 lips tremble. But without a working set of lungs, she can not speak.

>examine arms
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine flashlight
 The flashlight is a pocket size model, which fell off of Angela's key
 chain.

 The flashlight is switched on.

 The woman bangs her head against the crate, desperate to communicate.

>put hand on wrist
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine body
 The woman has been butchered. Her arms and legs have been removed.
 Both legs are cut off at the hip. Her abdomen is sliced wide and
 disemboweled.  Yet even in death, her eyes are unnaturally animated.
 They blink and track your movements intently.  She's been drained of
 blood leaving her skin as white as the clean cotton bed sheet draped
 across her pelvis.

>show newspaper to woman
 Her eyes look at you imploringly, but without a working set of lungs
 her voice is mute.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to turn the screw.

 The screw is rusted in place.  Your only other alternative for

>reach in trough
 You reach under the cover of the trough and cautiously poke around.
 Wedged against the blade is a pulpy mass of sinewy entrails.  With
 some effort, you jerk the entrails free from the blade.

 Suddenly, and without warning, the buffalo chopper roars to life.
 Your sleeve catches against the rusty blade, which stalls momentarily,
 but seizes your arm deeper into the device.  Then the blade spins once
 again.  At first you're not even sure what has happened, but you hear
 a crunching noise, and feel faint from a sudden drop in blood
 pressure.  With a rush of endorphins, you yank your arm free from the
 buffalo chopper, and collapse on the floor.

 You are missing a hand.  If you don't act quickly, you will die.

 gasp for another breath.   Then, as if these miracles weren't
 startling enough, The entire abdomen zips shut, leaving nothing more

 To your shock and horror, the woman whispers "Thank you.  My name is

 Dining Room
 The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a
 dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A
 larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.
 A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office
 loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his
 office entrance.

 On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive
 view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 Since the last time you were here, Nikolai has managed to transport
 himself down those treacherous steps to the Dining Room.  He sits on
 one of those tiny dining room chairs, which appears barely capable of
 supporting his weight.  Angela has returned from her bread run.  She
 sits across Nikolai's lap, scarcely conscious, with just a trace of
 blood dribbling from twin teeth marks in her neck.  Nikolai looks up
 from her neck, with blood stains on his own fat face, "You're next,
 Mr. Health Inspector.  I knew you'd cause me trouble when you walked
 in here."

 Since your last tour through the dining room, Nikolai has locked and
 barred the front door to prevent your escape.

>examine mirror
 In the mirror you see The window is scratched, but intact.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 About twelve tables are closely spaced within the small location.

 Dozens of identical chairs are pushed snug against the four top
 tables.
 You also see Angela's body, Nikolai and yourself.

 Nikolai grins at you and licks his lips.

>ask nikolai about sofia
 Nikolai pales.  "I don't know who you're talking about."

>ask him about angela
>ask nikolai about key
 "She'd be better with a little catsup.  Watch out, you're next."

 Nikolai growls, "I lose a lot of business because of you."

 A tiny brown mouse dashes out of view.

>examine angela
 Angela is a dark haired woman, not quite 50, now unconscious.  Her
 neck and shoulders are marked by numerous scars.

 Nikolai shifts his weight.  The chair creaks.

>go up
 Nikolai pursues you up the stairs, huffing and wheezing from the
 effort.  You double your speed just in time to escape his reach.
 Nikolai is left stranded and out of breath back on the fifth step.

 Nikolai's Office
 Nikolai's office is an ill-maintained balcony sky box above his
 restaurant.  A window looks out over the restaurant. But as you could
 see earlier, the dining room side is mirrored such that employees and
 guests can't see in.  A rickety set of steps leads back to the main
 floor.  The plaster walls are water stained and cracked.  A single
 unfrosted bulb hangs from the ceiling by a loose wire.  Mounds of
 unpaid invoices litter Nikolai's wooden desk.

 On Nikolai's desk are a brass key and a book.

 A plastic pitcher sits on the floor in the corner of the office,
 filled with some foamy amber liquid.

 Your heart is racing.

 You hear a mouse scurrying through the wall.

 The volume is small and weather-beaten.  The cover is so dark you can
 scarcely read the title: "Lore of the Vampires".  Chapters are written
 in several different languages.  Many of the pages are stained.

 Some of these invoices are dated from months ago.  It seems that
 Nikolai isn't very timely about paying his bills.

>examine desk
 Nikolai's has an old aluminum desk.  It is painted olive drab in
 places, and gray where the enamel has chipped away.

 On Nikolai's desk are mounds of unpaid invoices and a book.

>open it
 That's not something you can open.

>take book
 Taken.

 A tiny brown mouse dashes out of view.

>read it
 You read: "Lore of the Vampires".  Two chapter titles catch your
 attention:  "Vampire Culture" and "Killing Vampires".  Most of the
 remaining chapters are written in an unfamiliar Slavic language.

>read vampire culture
 You read: Vampire Culture.

 Bratislavan vampires, like their Transylvanian cousins, require
 nightly aliquots of blood for their continued immortality.  But unlike
 the Transylvanians, who are mostly solitary in habit, the Bratislavan
 vampires fight actively amongst themselves for territory, a stable of
 victims and general dominance.  The most dominant vampire in a given
 territory is the arch-vampire.

>read killing vampires
 You read: Killing Vampires

 Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are
 now almost clich?.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a
 wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the
 Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a
 weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.

 Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses,
 or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem
 for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and
 dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver
 (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents
 and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even
 this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a
 vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble
 themselves by whatever means available.

 Dining Room
 The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a
 dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A
 larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.
 A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office
 loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his
 office entrance.

 On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive
 view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 Angela's unconscious body is propped like a rag doll across Nikolai's
 corpulent lap.

 Nikolai is here, lapping blood from Angela's neck.  He shoots you a
 look of contempt.

>go north

 Galley Kitchen
 You are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide
 enough for one person to turn around.  On the south side facing the
 dining room is a wooden prep table.  On the left end of the prep table
 is a mini fridge, and on the right end is a steam table.

 Opposite the prep table is a flat grill.  Dried rivulets of grease
 ooze down the wall from the overhead vents.  A narrow aisle winds
 north into darkness.

>go north

 Winding Hall
 A narrow hall twists and winds from the prep kitchen (south) to the
 dish room (north).  A walk-in refrigerator is west of here.  During
 every dinner shift, smoke from the kitchen drifts down this hall and
 deposits an oily film against the brown wall.

 Mounted on the wall is a first aid kit.

 A formidable buffalo chopper is parked against one corner of this
 twisting labyrinth.

>go north

 Dish Room
 On entering the dish room you are overwhelmed by the astringent smell
 of fresh bleach.  You would welcome this as evidence of sanitation,
 except that in such high concentrations bleach is actually toxic.
 Already you're feeling a little nauseous.  A hall winds south into the
 darkness.

 You step cautiously around the open drain cover.

 A warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is
 sealed tight.

 The largest fixture in this location is a straight unit dish machine,
 with a stainless steel dish table on either side.

 On the dish table is a dish rack (in which are some servingware).

 A cockroach scuttles up the wall.

>unlock door with key
 You unlock the alley door.

 You hear a mouse scurrying through the wall.

>open door
 You open the alley door.

>go north

 Back Alley
 Windowless brick walls rise three stories on either side of you,
 blocking out most of the sunlight.  The cobbled alley slopes down hill
 at a dangerous pitch.  You won't be able to get back to the street
 from here however, as the top of the alley ends in a dead end, and the
 bottom is securely gated, locked from the other side

 A warped wooden door is set into the brick.  It leads south back to
 the dish room. The door is open.

 A rectangular green dumpster is parked at the dead end.  Greasy
 effluent leaks from the sides and bottom, meandering downhill between
 the cobbles to form a slick but irregular path.

>note effluent
 Your writing hand has been amputated.  You need to find a way back to
 your car and get some help!

>examine dumpster
 You can't see inside, since the green dumpster is closed.

>open it
 You open the green dumpster, revealing a tangled mound of putrefying
 human limbs: a severed left arm, a severed right arm, a severed left
 leg and a severed right leg.

>take all from it
 severed left arm: Taken.
 severed right arm: Taken.
 severed left leg: Taken.
 severed right leg: Taken.

 [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped twenty points.]

 Crypt
 The edges and corners of this brown room are rounded by accumulated
 cobweb nets, making it look more like a small cave than an urban
 underground.  Moldy pylons and concrete extrusions resemble
 stalagmites.  Wet cardboard boxes stacked along the wall contain empty
 unrecycled liquor bottles.  The humid air smells of death.

 You could escape through the drain pipe in the ceiling.

 At the center of the room is a three foot by six foot crate, composed
 mostly of particle board. Sofia lies in state.

 You can also see a severed left foot and a severed right foot here.

>take left foot and right foot
 severed left foot: Taken.
 severed right foot: Taken.

>put left arm on sofia
 Almost before you release it, the left arm wriggles snakelike into
 location near the woman's shoulder.  Muscle and sinew, then skin all
 regenerate between the disjointed limb and body.  The air crackles.
 Your nose burns with the stench of cauterized flesh.

 The woman flexes her left arm. She coos, "it still tingles.  But
 Darling, you must still bring me my hand."

>put right arm on sofia
 You hear a sudden crack, like bone breaking in reverse.  Skin and
 tissue then grow over the freshly attached right arm at stop-action
 speed.

 The woman flexes her right arm. She coos, "it still tingles.  But
 Sweetie, you must still bring me my hand."

>put left leg on sofia
 The left leg doesn't fit into its socket at quite the right angle.
 Sofia grimaces as it twists into place.  The skin which grows over is
 purple and gangrenous.  But not a moment later the gangrenous stench
 has disipated and the skin color fades to a mottled bruise.

 The woman flexes her left leg. She coos, "it still tingles.  But
 Darling, you must still bring me my foot."

>put right leg on sofia
 Sofia looks with excitement as you lower the final limb into her
 coffin.  She leans toward you so that the right leg locks into exactly
 the right place.  The air crackles more loudly than before, filling
 the entire room with the smoke and stench of cauterization.

 The woman flexes her right leg. She coos, "it still tingles.  But
 Sweetie, you must still bring me my foot."

>put left foot on sofia
 The air is filled with a smell of searing flesh.  Muscle and tissue
 regenerate unnaturally to produce a whole working leg.

 A large rat turns to look at you, then runs away.

>put right foot on sofia
 The air is filled with a smell of searing flesh.  Muscle and tissue
 regenerate unnaturally to produce a whole working leg.

 Sofia says, "I like when you talk to me."

>put left hand on sofia
 The air is filled with a smell of searing flesh.  Muscle and tissue
 regenerate unnaturally to produce a whole working arm.

>SAVE
>cf4
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>put right hand on sofia
 The air is filled with a smell of searing flesh.  Muscle and tissue
 regenerate unnaturally to produce a whole working arm.

 Sofia's body levitates out of her coffin until she has risen nearly to
 the ceiling. Then she rotates upright to face you, still suspended at
 least four feet above the ground.

 "You have done good work today, my little hero.  And since I fancy
 you, I will now help you escape."
 "You are a sharp fellow.  By now I expect you've figured out the
 situation on your own and I don't have to belabor my strained
 relationship with Nikolai.  We are both, to put it crudely, vampires.
 When I moved into the neighborhood a few years ago, he still had the
 power to subordinate me.  But I knew he was being weakened by diabetes
 and it would not be long before I would inherit his territory.
 Nikolai knew this as well.  So to prevent my challenge to his
 dominance he had me abducted and slaughtered."

 Sofia smiles.  "Now, I suppose, is the time for my revenge."  She
 levitates out of this location to the dish room, then out of sight.

>go south
 Angela is dead on the floor, her life force sucked dry. Blood and
 other pieces of Nikolai are scattered around the room as if he had
 swallowed a hand grenade.  The front door is blasted open.  Yet there
 was no hand grenade which did this.  The largest part of his remains
 have landed on a table.  Sofia levitates magically above them, lapping
 the blood from his various wounds.

 She is, at present, unaware that you've entered the room.

 You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street.
 A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.
 The front entrance is north of you.

 The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of
 crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with
 broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.
 A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see
 no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.

 An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.

 You are walking past the window to Goldschmidt's Pawnshop (on the

 the window provides a neat display of hocked merchandise.  Nikolai's
 Bar and Grill is east.  To the west, the neighborhood becomes even

 Sofia hovers several feet above the dining room tables, lapping blood
 from Nikolai's remains.

>kill sofia with letter opener
 Though it feels awkward to strike with your left hand, the letter
 opener slides into Sofia's chest as easily as a hot knife through
 butter.  Sofia's mouth drops.  Her expression speaks a sense of
 betrayal.  Then her body is overcome with epileptic seizures.  You are
 deafened by a momentary blast of thunder.  Sofia has disintegrated.
 Nothing remains but fly-size specks of blood and tissue painted
 against walls and ceiling. You race to your car to vacate the
 neighborhood before police arrive.

 You read in the newspaper the next day that police are unable to
 explain the carnage and gore they discovered at Nikolai's Bar and
 Grill that morning.  Police are still looking for the culprit.

 As for you, you are happy to have destroyed a coven of vampires.  It
 is a shame that you became afflicted by the means of Sofia's kiss.
 Now every night you find yourself trolling the streets for your own
 stable of victims.

>amusing
 "Afflicted" features a variety of possible endings, depending on what
 point in the game the player enters their car; whether or not the
 player calls police to the scene by breaking a window; whether or not
 the player has been kissed by Sofia; and ultimately whether or not the
 player chooses to kill sofia in the final scene.

 For additional entertainment, have you tried:
 Killing yourself with the letter opener (when afflicted, or not)?
 Using the toilet?
