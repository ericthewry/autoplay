>examine ditch
 The ditch is too dark and overgrown to see much of it. It looks deep,
 though. You wouldn't want to go walking through it. The tall grass
 could hide snakes.

 You get out of the rental car.

 Scene of the Accident
 A flatbed truck blocks the road.

 Drainage ditches run along either side of the road, continuing on to
 the west and back east.

 Your rental car remains parked here, blocked by the wrecked pick-up
 truck.

 It has been abandoned, presumably due to the damage done to it. The
 hood has been crumpled, staved in. It blocks both lanes.

>look under car
 (the car key)
 You find nothing of interest.

 You find nothing of interest.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

 There's too much blood.

>shift gear
>go east
 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't remember how long it's been since you saw something down that
 stretch of road. It could be hours, or longer, before you found help
 that way.

>go west
 You brace yourself for a long walk down the road.

 Further down the Road
 About half a mile from the accident, something rushing through the
 switchgrass catches your eye.

>examine switchgrass
 You peer through the switchgrass, trying to catch a glimpse of the
 shadow you saw, but you can't make anything out.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>enter switchgrass
 It's not wise to go wandering off like that. Best to stick to the road.

 It's already open.

 Frrip.

>go west
 As you head down the road once more, a shadow rushes toward you from
 out of the grass. Before you can react, the form, which barely comes up
 to your waist, flits by you.

 You hear a giggle, then a jingle. Your car keys.

 The shadow vanishes into the grasses.

 You are carrying:
   an umbrella

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>listen
 You hear nothing except the wind, and the occasional thunderclap from
 the west.

 You peer through the switchgrass, trying to catch a glimpse of the
 shadow you saw, but you can't make anything out.

>go south
 You hesitate, then step forward to venture into the grass.

 Suddenly you hear a sharp rustling, then jingling over your head. You
 try to catch a glimpse of your keys as they fly through the air. You
 hear them fall into the grass on the other side of the road. You hear
 giggling, that of a small child.

 You peer through the switchgrass, trying to catch a glimpse of the
 shadow you saw, but you can't make anything out.

>go north
 Once again, the keys fly over your head and into the grass on the other
 side of the road.

 Foomp.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west
 You continue west from the wreck. Signs of civilization grow farther
 and farther apart. Even the odd fencepost seems like a milestone now.

 You decide to turn around and try your luck back east -- when you spot
 a sign up ahead.

 Intersection
 The road plunges west, into the storm, and continues back east to the
 wreck and your rental car.

 The road forks here, and a weathered billboard announces a motel to the
 north.

>examine billboard
 It says MOTEL. Years of sun and rain have faded the billboard, and if
 it had any smaller text it's impossible to read now.

>read sign
 It says MOTEL. Years of sun and rain have faded the billboard, and if
 it had any smaller text it's impossible to read now.

>read sign

 Intersection
 The road plunges west, into the storm, and continues back east to the
 wreck and your rental car.

 The road forks here, and a weathered billboard announces a motel to the
 north.

>go north
 As you walk towards the motel, the last of the sun's rays disappear
 behind the western clouds.

 The Parking Lot
 There are no cars here. Maybe the owner has his own car parked around
 back, and is just having a slow night.

 A deck on the north side of the lot fronts the motel's several rooms.
 It looks like the west end of the building houses the motel's front
 office. Wooden stairs lead up to the deck northwest and northeast of
 here. A path leads around back of the motel to the east.

> x stairs
 Attached to the dilapidated motel. It's weathered, rotting in places.
 It appears safe to walk on, though.

> x office
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east
 You follow the semi-circular path around the motel.

 Behind the Motel, East
 A narrow alley runs the length of the motel, with motel rooms' windows
 on one side and a tall fence on the other. The alley continues to the
 west. East leads back around to the parking lot.

 The windows have been painted over, except for one. After a quick
 count, you decide the unpainted window belongs to Room Five.

 Taped to Room Five's window is a brass key.

>examine window
 Which do you mean, window to Room Seven, the window to Room Six or the
 window to Room Five?

>five
 You can't reach the window from here.

>jump
 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>take brass key
 You cannot reach the window from the ground.

>get key with umbrella
 I only understood you as far as wanting to get the brass key.

>hit key with umbrella
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 Futile.

 Futile.

>open umbrella
 It's already open.

>window five
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine window five
 You can't reach the window from here.

>poke key with umbrella
 You prod the key with the umbrella, but you just can't manage to get
 it. You'll need to get up closer somehow.

>look through window five
 You can't reach the window from here.

>climb fence
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>go west

 Behind the Motel, West
 The narrow alley behind the motel ends here. The only way back is to
 the east.

>go northeast
 You can't go that way.

>go west

 Taped to Room Five's window is a brass key.

>go east
 You follow the semi-circular path back around the motel to the parking
 lot.

 The Parking Lot
 A deck on the north side of the lot fronts the motel's several rooms.
 It looks like the west end of the building houses the motel's front
 office. Wooden stairs lead up to the deck northwest and northeast of
 here. A path leads around back of the motel to the east.

>go northeast

 Motel Deck, East
 You hear an odd hum here.

 Stairs lead down from the deck back south to the parking lot.

 You can see the doors to rooms Five, Six and Seven here.

>listen
 You hear... buzzing from the door to Room Five. Almost like an alarm
 clock, but steady. More like a buzzsaw, maybe, though not as loud.
 Several -- no, dozens -- of distant buzzsaws. Or something else. You
 can't put your finger on it.

>open room five
 It seems to be locked.

>put finger on in
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine door
 Which do you mean, the door to Room Seven, the door to Room Six or the
 door to Room Five?

 You can't see any such thing.

 You can see that the door to Room Five is closed.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine feel door five
 You can't see any such thing.

>listen to door five
 You hear the same odd buzzing through the door. You're still not sure
 how to describe it, but it sets your teeth on edge and sends a thrill
 up your spine.

 It seems to be locked.

>knock on door five
 You knock and wait, but receive no answer.

 You open the office's front door.

>enter office

 Darkness
 The power must be out. You can't see a thing.


 Motel Deck, West
 You can see the office's front door and the door to Room One here.

 As your eyes adjust from the office's pitch darkness to the near
 darkness of the motel's deck, you think you see shadows flying over the
 railing. They whirl around and disappear below the deck. You hear
 scampering footsteps rush underneath you, followed by muffled laughter.
 You look down, and see a candle and a lighter at your feet.

 Taken.

 Taken.

 What do you want to light the white candle with?

 You spark the lighter, and a small spurt of flame rises from its tip.

 You hold the lighter to the candle's wick. It ignites, and sheds an
 unsteady light.


 Motel Reception
 A long countertop with signage regarding per-night rates identifies
 this room as the motel's front office. Small cubbyholes hang on one
 wall, each labeled with numbers one through seven. A mini-fridge hums
 behind the counter.

 High up on a wall, near the ceiling, is a hook. On the hook hangs a
 key.

 An interior door in the north wall leads deeper into the building,
 presumably to a back office. A slender door probably opens onto a
 utility closet.

 It's a key. It has something printed on it, but you'd need to hold it
 in your hand to get a better look at it.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to get the key from the office.

 You try to maneuver the key off the hook with the umbrella's tip, but
 while the umbrella is open it is too unwieldy for the task.

 Frrip.

 You slip the umbrella's tip through the keyring and lift it off the
 hook.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>score
 You have so far scored 2 out of a possible 6, in 104 turns.

 Printed on the key is: "If found return to mgmt." Must be a skeleton
 key.

>examine fridge
 A miniature fridge, the kind often found in college dorms or small
 office break rooms. Colorful magnetic letters cling to the refrigerator
 door. Chains have been wrapped around the fridge, barring entry.

>examine letters
 Colorful letters for children. At the moment they spell out: "WELCOME
 TO CICADA CREEK".

 While the padlock is locked, the chains will prevent you from opening
 the fridge.

 What do you want to unlock the fridge with?

 Suddenly you envision a man with boils or tumors. You can see the veins
 in them throb. Then one of them bursts. Before you see what issues
 forth, you shake the vision off.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>unplug fridge
 That's not something you can unplug.

 Motel Reception
 A long countertop with signage regarding per-night rates is the
 office's largest piece of furniture. Small cubbyholes hang on one wall,
 each labeled with numbers one through seven. A mini-fridge hums behind
 the counter.

 High up on a wall, near the ceiling, is a hook.

 An interior door in the north wall leads deeper into the building,
 presumably to a back office. A slender door probably opens onto a
 utility closet.

 You open the closet, revealing a cleaning mask.

 Taken.

 Which do you mean, Box 1, Box 2, Box 3, Box 4, Box 5, Box 6 or Box 7?

 It's empty. They all are.

 Box 5 is empty.

 That's not something you can enter.

>examine mask
 A white, disposable cleaning mask to be used while handling especially
 pungent chemicals.

 You put on the cleaning mask.

>clean desk

>get fridge

>examine hook
 It's unreasonably high up on the wall. Unfortunately, there's nothing
 in the room near it. Even if you climbed onto the counter and jumped,
 you wouldn't be able to reach it.

>stand on fridge
 That's not something you can stand on.

 There is nothing on the countertop.

>examine lighter
 One of those lighters you can buy in bulk -- and lose in bulk, too.

>stand on counter
 It looks as though it would collapse under your weight.

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine candle
 A long, thick white candle. It burns with an unsteady flame.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go north
 You can't, since the interior door is in the way.

>open interior door
 It seems to be locked.

>unlock interior door with key
 You see, in your mind's eye, a pale face with milky eyes. Its lips part
 slightly, and between the lips you see a sawblade. With a high-pitched
 whine, the sawblade spins, shredding the man's lips and cheeks. You rub
 your eyes and endeavor to think of something else.

>examine interior door
 You can see that the interior door is closed.

 Which do you mean, the office's front door or the interior door?

 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to burn the down.

 You can't see any such thing.

>take letters

>rearrange letters
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 You push the letters around for a little while, jumbling the message.

 You can't see any such thing.

 The colorful letters are jumbled in a meaningless array.

>say hello
 (to yourself)
 There is no reply.

>yell concierge
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>search closet
 The closet is empty.

>enter closet
 It's not a walk-in closet. It's just a set of shelves with a door in
 front, really.

 You can't see any such thing.


 Motel Deck, West
 You can see the office's front door and the door to Room One here.


 The Parking Lot
 A deck on the north side of the lot fronts the motel's several rooms.
 The west end of the building houses the motel's front office. Wooden
 stairs lead up to the deck northwest and northeast of here. A path
 leads around back of the motel to the east.


 Motel Deck, East

 You can see the doors to rooms Five, Six and Seven here.

 What do you want to unlock the door to Room Seven with?

 You unlock the door to Room Seven.

 You open the door to Room Seven.

 Room Seven
 Party streamers have been hung from the ceiling. There's also a cake
 here, with candles burning. The room is far from welcoming, though. The
 mattress is missing from the bed. The floor is uncarpeted. The windows,
 barred.

 A cramped, stained alcove separates a toilet, sink and shower from the
 rest of the room.

 Beside the cake, you see a birthday card.

 On the outside is a drawing of seven presents, with a vial being
 dropped into each box. Inside the card you see:

 Patient A: Foaming at the mouth.
 Patient B: BAC ten times above legal limit.
 Patient C: Loss of bladder control.
 Patient D: Requires immediate transfusion.
 Patient E: Burns indicative of flammable chemicals.
 Patient F: Cursory examination indicates immediate application of rape
 kit.
 Patient G: Dehydrated.

>examine streamer
 Paper bands crisscross the ceiling. They may have been colorful once,
 but either sunlight or age has faded them.

>examine candles
 Wax, pastel swirls. They seem to have faded with age.

>examine cake
 Some birthday candles have been stuck in the frosting and lit. Looking
 at the cake, you realize how hungry you are. You can't remember the
 last time you've eaten something. Your mouth waters.

 Written on the cake is: "WELCOME HOME, WALKER".

 As hungry as you are, you don't know how long this cake has been here,
 or who made it. You decide to keep your fast a little while longer.
 Sure makes your mouth water, though.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>get candles
 You can't resist. You pull out a candle and lick the frosting off the
 end. Saliva floods your mouth. You replace the candle, feeling oddly
 lonely.

 You can't see any such thing.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to look.

 It's missing its mattress.

 It's been painted over, and you can't see anything through it.

 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

 You are carrying:
   a cleaning mask (being worn)
   a skeleton key
   a cheap lighter
   a white candle (providing light)
   an umbrella

 You unlock the door to Room Five.

 You push against the door, but it will not open. There must be
 something on the other side blocking it.

 You brace your shoulder against the door and push it until you feel as
 though you're going to break something. The door doesn't budge, though
 your shoulder aches.

 You think you hear something through the door.

>listen door

 You don't see the point in that.

 You prod the key with the umbrella, but you just can't manage to get
 it. You'll need to get up closer somehow.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

 Motel Deck, West
 You can see the office's front door and the door to Room One here.

 You can't see underneath it, except through cracks in the planks. It's
 too dark to make anything out, though.

 What do you want to unlock the door to Room One with?

 You unlock the door to Room One.

 You open the door to Room One.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't go that way.


 Room One
 The room smells as if someone went on a week-long bender in here. There
 are beer bottles strewn all over the bed and floor. A thin chapbook
 lies on the bed.

 A cramped, stained alcove separates a toilet, sink and shower from the
 rest of the room.

 It, like the rest of Room One, reeks of alcohol. Many of the pages are
 stained by it, and some of the ink has been smudged. Most of the pages
 remain legible.

 You flip to a random page in the chapbook and read it:

 stained cock          smoky bolt        red bribe
 hidden storm  hidden bed
 stubble    runs away
      mother
     sinful bolt    worries  gold   storm    oozes

    shot  runs away cash
   buzzed bribe      gold      breaks
    sinful bolt     fears storm

 You can't see any such thing.

 Different brands, different sizes, but each and every one drained of
 its last drop. Still, it smells awful in here.

 The bottom of the shower has been splattered with vomit, like much of
 the rest of the alcove. It stinks of alcohol.

 That's not something you can switch.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine toilet
 After whoever drank all that beer was finished, they must have come in
 here and puked most of it back up.

 The alcohol fumes make you feel a little dizzy.

>flush toilet
 It looks as though it's been clogged. You don't want to risk spilling
 even more of the vile mixture onto the floor.

 There's nothing suitable to drink here.

 That's not something you can sit down on.

>open toilet
 That's not something you can open.

>examine bed
 There's a chapbook on it, as well as a dozen beer bottles.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to listen.

 The thought of knocking back the foam at the bottom of these bottles
 makes the bile rise in your throat.

>lower bile
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 After whoever vomited in the toilet was through there, they moved on to
 the sink, and got sick all over again. It reeks of booze.

 Room Two
 A television here casts dim light onto the walls and bed opposite it.
 The bedsheets have been rumpled.

 A cramped, stained alcove separates a toilet, sink and shower from the
 rest of the room.

 A used condom floats in the toilet water.

 You hear a squelching noise from the bed. A squelch, then a tearing
 sound. Then nothing.

 The TV is already on.

 You're not sure what you expect. A frozen image, a test pattern, snowy
 static. But instead you see a room. This room, shot from the ceiling.
 And yourself, looking at the television.

 And a man, sitting on the edge of the bed behind you.

 You find nothing of interest.

 The man strokes his thighs, and twitches.

>examine man
 You whirl to face the man directly.

 He has vanished.

 The sheets have been twisted and kicked to the foot of the bed. There's
 a pale stain on the mattress, halfway between the foot and the head.

>examine ceiling
 You can't see any such thing.

 A used condom floats in the toilet water.

 It looks like it has been used. It also looks larger than the average
 condom.

 Unless a very good reason to take it comes up, you'll leave it where it
 is.

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>turn channel
 You can't see any such thing.

 It's just a sink. It's stained, like most everything else here.

>turn off television
 You can't find the power button on the television.

 You jiggle the handle, but it must be broken.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 It's bolted down.

 The thought of touching it makes you uncomfortable.

 You can't see "them" (the birthday candles) at the moment.

>examine sink
 It's just a sink. It's stained, like most everything else here.

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine shower
 It's just a shower. It has one of those fancy shower heads, though. The
 ones with different massage settings.

 Room Two
 A television here casts dim light onto the walls and bed opposite it.
 The bedsheets have been rumpled.

 A cramped, stained alcove separates a toilet, sink and shower from the

>unplug tv
 You reach for the plug, but then realize that, with the power out, this
 TV shouldn't even be on in the first place. You hesitate.

 The sheets have been twisted and kicked to the foot of the bed. There's
 a pale stain on the mattress, halfway between the foot and the head.

 nothing there.

 That's not a verb I recognise.


 Central Motel Deck
 There are more rooms to the east. Room One and the office are to the

 You can see the doors to rooms Two, Three and Four here.

 What do you want to unlock the door to Room Three with?

 That's unlocked at the moment.

 You turn the knob and push the door, but it won't open. Something is
 jammed against the door on the other side. It gave a little when the
 door banged against it, though.

 That's unlocked at the moment.

 You unlock the door to Room Four.

 You can't, since the door to Room Four is in the way.

 You open the door to Room Four.

 You brace your shoulder against the door and shove it as hard as you
 can. Whatever is on the other side slowly gives, until it has been
 pushed far enough back from the doorway that you can squeeze through.


 Room Three
 The room is in total disarray. The bed has been turned onto its side,
 forming an impromptu barrier. The bureau was pushed away from the wall
 and braced against the door, at least until you shoved it back as you
 entered. A long board, presumably a mirror, has been taken off the
 bureau and turned towards a wall.

 A cramped, stained alcove separates a toilet, sink and shower from the
 rest of the room.

 You hear a whimper behind the bed.

 The reflective surface has been turned towards the wall. You lift it up
 and take a peek, but see nothing except yourself. You realize this is
 literally true: nothing else reflects in the mirror except you. In the
 reflection, it appears as though you stand in a void. You replace the
 mirror against the wall.

 It is fixed in place.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 That's not something you can enter.

 Someone has urinated in the toilet, and has not flushed. Whoever did it
 must have a poor diet. The air here is pungent with the smell of it.

 It's just a sink.

 It's just a shower.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 You jiggle the handle, but it must be broken.

 It's hard to smell anything here except the general miasma. It smells
 like an animal has marked its territory in here.

 You hear a stifled whimper. You think it's coming from behind the bed.

 As you eye the bed, you note that the sheets and mattress have a
 tell-tale stain on them. It smells almost as though some animal has
 marked its territory here.

 You find, behind the upturned bed, several items arranged on the floor.
 There are scattered religious symbols here, along with a well-worn
 volume titled A Survival Guide for Young Boys and a flashlight.

 You flick the flashlight on. It has a strong beam, stronger than the
 light which the candle provides. You blow out the flame and leave the
 candle behind, opting for the flashlight instead.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You see nothing special about the Survival Guide.

 The corner of a page has been dogeared. You read a passage which has
 been underlined there:

 "It is never wise to talk to strangers. If you must, make sure you
 never allow them to corner you in a poorly lit place."

 Scrawled in the margins is: "don't look at him. when he came into my
 room, i hid my head under the blanket. i could still hear him but he
 went away"

 You can see a white candle, a Survival Guide and some religious symbols
 here.

 It was pushed up against the door, as if someone was trying to prevent
 anyone from entering this room.

 Most of the symbols are Christian -- crosses, a few rosaries, a
 full-blown wooden crucifix -- but you also spot a Star of David, a
 crescent moon, and even a few you don't recognize.

 You've never been especially superstitious. That survival guide looks
 much more useful.

 Taken.

 It was pushed up against the door, as if someone was trying to prevent
 anyone from entering this room.

 The drawers are all empty.

 As you leave the room, you hear a small voice, a boy's voice, say,

 (the key to Room Six)
 That's not something you can enter.


 Room Six
 A cramped, stained alcove separates a toilet, sink and shower from the
 rest of the room.

 You hear the sound of running water from the alcove.

 Bright white light steams down from a gaping crack in the ceiling.

 A small stepladder rests underneath the crack, as if someone wanted to
 reach up and into the light.

 There's a TV here. It's unplugged at the moment, but you could swear
 you'd seen something on the screen as you opened the door.

>examine water
 Which do you mean, the toilet or the faucet?

>faucet
 You see nothing special about the faucet.

>listen
 You listen to the running water in the alcove. It sounds odd to you,
 wrong somehow. Too... pleasant. It's not the sound you expect from a
 motel bathroom: the shrill whine of water rushing out of steel and
 plashing against a ceramic basin.

 Suddenly you realize it sounds more like a brook than a sink or shower.
 The water burbles. You can almost hear birds, can imagine a gentle
 breeze through treetops overhead.

 You see nothing special about the shower.

 You get onto the small stepladder.

>examine gap
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine ceiling
 The crack extends deeply up into the ceiling, almost as if it was the
 bottom of a long chimney or chute. The light shining down the hole

 "--one man, standing against corruption."

 You attend the television.

 It appears to be a commercial for an upcoming movie. "Look out!"
 screams a Black man (one of those actors whose name you always forget)
 in full bunker gear. He turns the hose he's holding onto a gout of
 flame engulfing another firefighter. "Nooo!"

>watch tv
 You attend the television.

 The scene has changed to a funeral. The heroic firefighter kneels by
 his fallen partner's son. "I'll find out who did this," he whispers,
 jaw clenched. "I promise."

>again
 You attend the television.

 "And now," booms the announcer, "the people behind it all will stop at
 nothing to silence the truth." The scene switches again, and now the
 firefighter has his friend's son cradled in his arms as he rushes out
 of an exploding building.

>h
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>watch tv
 You attend the television.

 Suddenly, the commercial cuts from the polished cinematography to
 grainy footage of... a storage trunk? Is it the same commercial? Yes,
 it must be: you can still hear the musical score and explosions in the
 background, though they are muted, distant. Then they fade altogether.
 You study the shot of the trunk for a moment. It's almost like a
 security feed, or a webcam.

 Loud banging breaks the silence. It's coming from the trunk.

 The signal cuts out. The screen is blank; the speakers, silent.

 Suddenly, the light shining from the crack in the ceiling goes out. The
 pleasant liquid burble from the sink vanishes. The temperature drops
 several degrees.

 You can't bear to gaze into the hole for long. It's darker than it

 A long countertop with signage regarding per-night rates is the
 office's largest piece of furniture. Small cubbyholes hang on one wall,
 each labeled with numbers one through seven. A mini-fridge hums behind
 the counter.

 High up on a wall, near the ceiling, is a hook.

 An interior door in the north wall leads deeper into the building,
 presumably to a back office. A slender door opens onto a utility
 closet.

 A narrow alley runs the length of the motel, with motel rooms' windows
 on one side and a tall fence on the other. The alley continues to the

 count, you decide the unpainted window belongs to Room Five.

>look in window five
 The first thing you see is a pair of eyes looking back at you.

 Not close to the window, but across the room. It's a person, collapsed
 against the door. You open your mouth to shout out to them, but then
 you see another body, and another. You press your face against the
 glass.

 They're all dead. There's at least a dozen corpses in the room. That's
 a rough estimate: a few are badly mutilated. Several are piled up
 against the door; no wonder you couldn't get it open.

 On the outside is a drawing of seven presents, with a vial being
 dropped into each box. Inside the card you see:

 Patient A: Foaming at the mouth.
 Patient B: BAC ten times above legal limit.
 Patient C: Loss of bladder control.
 Patient D: Requires immediate transfusion.
 Patient E: Burns indicative of flammable chemicals.
 Patient F: Cursory examination indicates immediate application of rape
 kit.
 Patient G: Dehydrated.

 You need to be holding Vial A before you can put it into something

 You put Vial D into Box 5.

 You put Vial G into Box 6.

 You are carrying:
   a birthday card

   a cheap lighter
   a key to Room Six
   a Survival Guide
   a flashlight (providing light)
   a cleaning mask (being worn)
   a skeleton key
   an umbrella

 You put Vial B into Box 1.

 Upon placing the final vial into its box, you hear the door across the
 room click. You turn to investigate, but the door has already started
 to open.

 You hear the buzzing before you see its source. The sound is loud,
 furious. Like cicadas, but like wasps: half mating call and half
 warning. Then the door opens.

 A naked corpse stands at the door. It has no distinguishing sexual
 features despite its nudity, but its body is covered in tumors of all
 sizes.

 It steps towards you.

 You can't see any such thing.

 They're too heavy to lug around.

 The pale being advances on you. You swear you can feel its buzz in your

 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

 It draws closer. The buzz grows louder, if that's possible. Your whole
 skull vibrates with it.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You taste nothing unexpected.

 It raises an arm towards you. Another moment, and it will be able to
 touch you. The buzz is so loud, so violent, you feel as though it has
 ruptured something deep inside you.

 You attempt to escape, but find yourself pinned by the reception
 counter. You'd have to climb over it to escape, but it looks old and
 rotten. You're not sure it can support your weight.

 The pale being reaches you. It closes a hand around your arm. You can't
 pull away. The buzz has maddened you, stunned you. It's so loud, too
 loud. You can barely hear the sound your flesh makes as it's peeled
 from your body.

 The corner of a page has been dogeared. You read a passage which has
 been underlined there:

 "It is never wise to talk to strangers. If you must, make sure you
 never allow them to corner you in a poorly lit place."

 Scrawled in the margins is: "don't look at him. when he came into my

 went away"

 Motel Reception
 A long countertop with signage regarding per-night rates is the
 office's largest piece of furniture. Small cubbyholes hang on one wall,
 each labeled with numbers one through seven. A mini-fridge hums behind
 the counter.

 High up on a wall, near the ceiling, is a hook.

 An interior door in the north wall leads deeper into the building,
 presumably to a back office. A slender door opens onto a utility
 closet.

 That seems to be a part of yourself.


 Endgame
 You can see the interior door here.

 That's already open.

 Stairs plunge into darkness here. You follow them. The air is damp; the
 walls, concrete. You descend for much longer than makes any
 architectural sense.

 You turn towards the head of the stairs and realize that something is
 swooping down at you. Something with a sharp, crooked beak and
 bone-white feathers dripping with tar. It shrieks and flashes its
 talons at you.

 You fling yourself down the stairs, into the darkness.

 Fiendish Zoo
 An Interactive Fiction by Elizabeth Heller
 Release 1 / Serial number 080820 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Zookeeper's Office
 Your personal work space contains a chair, a filing cabinet, a
 bookshelf, and a battered old table which serves as a desk.  A passage
 to the west leads to the locker room.

 On the desk is a pointless snowglobe.

 Taken.

 Well, it's more of an ashglobe, really ... when you shake it, bits of
 fire and brimstone rain down upon a miniature metropolis.  You've had
 it for a long time; it was a gift upon some occasion or other.

>shake it
 The small bits of ash inside the globe swirl about, wreaking
 destruction upon the tiny city inside.  After a few moments, they
 settle back into place.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 You smell nothing unexpected.

 It's not much more than a plank of wood with legs under it.  You aren't
>eat globe
 even certain that it is real wood.

 That's plainly inedible.

 You are the demon Enzak, and you're in charge of the Fiendish Zoo.

 There is a puff of orange smoke, which makes you sneeze.  Nothing else
 happens.

 Zookeeper's Office
 Your personal work space contains a chair, a filing cabinet, a
 bookshelf, and a battered old table which serves as a desk.  A passage
 to the west leads to the locker room.

>examine shelf
 The bookshelf does not actually contain any books at present.  Someone
 has written in yellow chalk on the shelf: "Borrowed books, will return
 later.  M."

>open cabinet
 That's not something you can open.

>look under desk
 You find nothing of interest.

>sit in chair
 You get onto the old chair.

>examine cabinet
 Records of the zoo are stored in there, of feeding schedules and bills
 and vet appointments and things of that sort.  Very boring.  A minor
 imp takes care of all the paperwork and brings you things that require
 your personal signature.

>examine chair
 It's your basic wooden chair, nothing special.  Not comfortable enough
 to relax in, but suitable for sitting down when you need to take a
 break.

 But you're already on the old chair.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 You get off the old chair.

 Locker Room
 Here is where most of your tools and supplies are stored.  Piled up
 around the walls are buckets, mops, brooms, hoses and bottles of
 cleaning solutions.  There are also freezers (blue, green, and red)
 full of food for the zoo residents, some feed bins, and in one corner
 stands a large oven.

 You can see a sack (in which are ten lumps of coal) here.

 You rummage aimlessly through the bins, but you don't find anything
 unexpected in there.

>examine locker
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine sack
 It's a plain sack made of rough cloth, extremely dirty because it's
 filled with coal.  To save storage space, and for the convenience of
 the zookeeper (namely you), there is only one sack of coal -- but it is
 virtually bottomless.

 Rumor has it that the Boss Himself made this sack, after He was tricked
 by a clever tailor.  All you know for certain is that the sack has been
 Zoo property for as long as you've worked here, and somehow it can
 never be completely filled.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You can see a sack (in which are ten lumps of coal) here.

>examine coal
 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

 The oven is used to heat and cook food for those zoo creatures that
 like their meals hot.  Appropriately, it is fueled with a coal-like
 substance from the nether planes, and has a maw like the jaws of Hell.

>examine lump
 "Coal" is a convenient word for this black substance, but it doesn't
 come from those pitiful scratches that mortals call mines.  Fiendish
 coal is dug from the deepest foundations of the world, where nameless
 Things gnaw tunnels out of rock in the eternal darkness.  The unlucky
 demons who mine this coal tend not to live very long.  But it burns
 nice and hot.

 (first taking the lump of coal)
 That's plainly inedible.

>put lump in oven
 (the lump of coal in the oven)
 You put the lump of coal into the oven.

 That's not something you can switch.

 Which do you mean, the blue freezer, the red freezer, or the green
>examine blue
 freezer?

 These chilly, insulated chests are full of food for Zoo denizens.  The
 blue one contains dairy foods and eggs.

>open blue
 You pull open the blue freezer and take a look.  It is well stocked
 with cheeses, bottles of milk, and eggs (not the hatching kind) from
 many types of beasts.

 You close the freezer again, so as not to let all the cold air escape.

>examine green
 These chilly, insulated chests are full of food for Zoo denizens.  The
 green one contains vegetables and fruits.

>open green
 You open the green freezer to have a peek.  Though fewer of the Zoo
 residents are vegetarians than meat-eaters, the ones who do eat plant
 matter eat a lot more of it.  This freezer contains large quantities of
 various fruits, vegetables, roots, and so on.

 Having seen the contents, you shut the freezer, lest the temperature in
 the room equalize with the temperature in the freezer.

>examine red
 These chilly, insulated chests are full of food for Zoo denizens.  The
 red one contains meats and fish.

>open red
 You pull open the door of the red freezer and peer inside.  It's
 stocked with all manner of steaks, ground-up patties, bones, organs and
 whole carcasses.  Lots of Zoo animals eat flesh or other body parts.

 After a moment, you shut the freezer, to make sure the cold things in
 there stay cold.

>examine  bins
 The feed bins contain all the food for Zoo creatures that doesn't need
 to be kept cold: dried grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, honey, et
 cetera.

 Employee Entrance, outside the Locker Room
 You stand just outside the employee entrance to the zoo.  Behind you,
 to the south, is the door back into the locker room.  West is the main
 visitors' entrance to the zoo, and north is the employee entrance.  On
 either side, you are surrounded by tall fencing topped with barbed
 wire.

 You hear an odd sound, and suddenly you notice a small furry creature
 at your feet.

 You reach down and pluck the kitten from the ground by the scruff of
 its neck.  It goes limp, as kittens will do when handled in this
 fashion, but after a moment it raises its head to look at you.  "Mew?"
 it says, blinking its round blue eyes.

 Taken.

>examine wire
 It's as sharp as the claws of demons.  Nastier demons than you, even.
 If metal could be cunning, the sharp little bits of this wire atop the
 fence would be.  It is there to make certain that nothing will try to
 enter the Fiendish Zoo by climbing over that fence.

 The barbed wire deters you.  Besides, why climb the fence when there's
 a perfectly good door?

 The Dread Portal
 You stand at the main entrance to the Fiendish Zoo.  This is where the
 visitors come through, and therefore the dread portal that serves as a
 gate is intimidating indeed.

>examine protal
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine portal
 Impressively decorated in black iron and decorated with the most
 twisted, terrible relief images possible, the Dread Portal also
 permanently reeks of brimstone, sulfur, and scorched flesh.

 Your bosses went all-out for this one, putting the budget out of
 balance for quite some while.

 You can't, since the Dread Portal is in the way.

 It seems to be locked.

>go north
 The Dread Portal is closed, locked and sealed, and until you finish
 your day's work, it's going to stay that way.  Can't have visitors
 wandering through the Zoo while you're making your rounds.

   a silver coin
   a small fluffy kitten
   a sack (open)
     nine lumps of coal
   a pointless ashglobe

>pet kitten

>put kitten in sack
 The kitten doesn't seem to want to go in the sack.  It sinks its claws
 into your hand and yowls, until you are forced to drop it.

 Taken.

 He's plainly inedible.

>kill cat
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 This baby feline has soft white fluffy fur, and large blue eyes.  Most
 humans would undoubtedly consider it extremely cute.

 There's nothing sensible to swing here.

 Hallway
 Nothing very interesting here.  This is simply a curving tunnel with
 two exits: to the south is back to the employee entrance, and to the
 northwest is your entry to the Zoo.

>drop cat
 The kitten manages to land on its feet.

 The kitten looks at you hopefully.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go northwest

 Inside the Gate
 You are just inside the Dread Portal, and the Zoo is open before you.
 It's built in a ring-shaped circuit, so you can walk northeast or
 northwest from here.  To the south is the Dread Portal, and to the
 southeast is the tunnel that leads to the locker room.

 The kitten follows you.

>take the rest of the day off
 You can't see any such thing.

>go south
 Many enter through the Dread Portal ... but few depart that way.  In
 any case, you work here, so there's no reason to be leaving just yet.


 Station Aleph
 For the benefit of visitors, signs here point in several directions.
 To the west is the manticore.  To the east is the cockatrice.  To the
 southeast is back to the main entrance, and to the northeast is Station
 Beth.

 The kitten follows you.

 Cockatrice Lair
 Here is where the cockatrice lives.  Its habitat is barred on the
 ground level and has a high net over the top.  Oddly, you don't see it
 anywhere in its habitat.  Maybe it's hiding, or asleep.

 The kitten follows you.

 The kitten manages to land on its feet.

 The kitten washes its paws.

>examine habitat
 The floor of the cockatrice's habitat is spread with straw, which needs
 to be changed every so often.  Tough, spindly bushes poke up here and
 there from the ground.  Several of the bushes have been turned to stone
 by the monster's famous gaze.

 There is also a trough where the cockatrice takes its meals, and a
 large, shallow clay fountain-pot where it can bathe and drink.  But the
 cockatrice itself is nowhere in sight.

>examine bars
 The same kind of bars on most of the cages here.  Hard, dark, and all
 but impervious to damage.  The ones on the cockatrice habitat look
 normal enough.

>shake bars
 (first taking the bars)
 That's hardly portable.

>examine trough
 It's a trough where you put the cockatrice's food.  Scattered bits of
 dried corn and beetle shells, leftovers from its last meal, are in
 evidence.

 Manticore Cave
 The manticore lives in a large cage that includes a variety of rocks
 and small trees for climbing, some soft cushions and furs to lounge on,
 and a little stream with a pool.

 Lying in its enclosure, occasionally twitching its tail, is the
 manticore.

 The manticore gets up, moves around, and then lies down again.

 The manticore lives in a large cage that includes a variety of rocks
 and small trees for climbing, some soft cushions and furs to lounge on,
 and a little stream with a pool.

 Lying in its enclosure, occasionally twitching its tail, is the
 manticore.

 They're just some dirty cushions that the manticore is lounging on.

 I'm not sure what "them" refers to.

 You feel nothing unexpected.

>manticore, your mom
 The manticore gnaws on a toy.

>manticore, xyzzy
 The manticore has better things to do.

>examine pool
 It's a pool of water, fed by a small stream, which is there so the
 manticore can have a drink or splash around, if it feels so inclined.

>manticore, sit

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Busy week. L.A., Helsinki, Mexico City  and back. Finally home, jet-lag
 hit you like a brick to the face. Randa was kind, understanding, then
 with her own soft determination beckoned you to get up from the sofa
 and put your son to bed. For a moment you gave in to the illusion that
 you're living the good life, making money, coming home to your family
 once the tie-up is completed. Then you realize you've been away for six
 months, a lifetime at his age. You look down on him, guilt in your
 stomach.
  But then he smiles, the smile that always reminds Randa of you, and
 you feel a wave of irrational, overwhelming pride. Danny pulls up his
 blanket, and murmurs, already half-asleep:

  "Dad, will you tell me a story?"

 Bedtime story
 An Interactive Fiction by Taleslinger
 Release 1 / Serial number 080819 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Well, it looks like you have your work cut out for you. Randa
 introduced Prince George, who is sent by king Sean to save some
 princess. (Even though Danny isn't yet old enough to get his head
 around the idea of wanting to save a girl.) Looks like the prince did a
 lot of traveling yesterday, saw a lot of landscape, did a lot of
 singing, and Danny fell asleep when he finally reached some bridge.
 Picking up there, you clear your throat and begin:

 At the Bridge
 "The old, (once upon a time) sturdy wooden bridge had crossed the
 Clearwater River from east to west for as long as the prince could
 remember, and according to the stories, it had been there long before
 that, built when the kingdom was young. He fondly remembered hiding in
 the thick scrub below the bridge from his father's guards when he was
 but a boy. "

 "A big and nasty mountain troll guarded the bridge, a burred stone axe
 in his brawny fists."

 The Prince then
 "But, dad, there was no such thing here!"

 The Prince then
>a clubfloyd
 "Clubfloyd is this weekly meeting where a lot of players play a game on
 IfMud. Maybe they're playing this one day. If so - Hey Club Floyd!"

 The Prince then
 (with the sword)
 "Working up all of his courage, the prince drew his sword, and, setting
 his face, marched towards the troll. The troll saw him approach and
 roared: 'Ha! You will fall by the order of...'
  You look around the room.

  'Kur-Tayn. Order of Great Wizard Kur-Tayn.'"

 --glaring light...
 Whoa! Danny has switched on his night lamp, effectively blinding you.
 When you finally blinked the spots away, he is sitting up in his bed,
 shouting:
 "Daaaad, that is so stupid. I mean, if this Cue-Train wizard was such a
 mighty wizard, he wouldn't let a troll, of all creatures, guard the
 only bridge leading to his castle! I mean, everyone knows they're dumb
 and easily tricked. No, he would set up something really dangerous
 there, something...cool."
 His eyes have gotten a dreamy quality you don't like at all.
 "Like what?" you ask carefully.

 "You know, in today's episode of SPACE RANGERS, they fought this really
 evil robot."

 "A robot, son? The prince lived hundreds of years ago..." Danny has
 crossed his arms, a gesture that reminds you of Randa and makes clear
 this argument is lost. "Well, this Cure-Tan guy is a wizard, right?"

 At the Bridge
 "The old, (once upon a time) sturdy wooden bridge had crossed the
 Clearwater River from east to west for as long as the prince could
 remember, and according to the stories, it had been there long before
 that, built when the kingdom was young. He fondly remembered hiding in
 the thick scrub below the bridge from his father's guards when he was
 but a boy. "

 "A robot was on the bridge."

 The Prince then
 "So, son, what was this robot from SPACE KNIGHTS like?"

 He folds his arms, and in an accusing voice, says: "Well, the robot in
 Space RANGERS was this really dangerous looking tripod thing, with this
 red light on the top, which could turn into a LASER BEAM which
 VAPORIZED EVERYTHING it hit, including people! It killed some of the
 STARLIGHT's crew! It nearly hit First Officer Leena, you know, the cat
 woman..." Ah, childhood crushes. "And she was buried under all this
 rubble..." "Yeah, son, see, we have our own story here."

 The Prince then
 "Well, this Jack Chambers is a cool guy. Do you know about the one time
 his uncle send him a magic box?"

 The Prince then
 "The prince jumped.

  The robot jumped, landing with a *thud*. The bridge creaked ominously,
 but held."

 The Prince then
 You take a deep breath to present a rousing rendition of "Off to see
 the wizard", but then Danny cringes. "He's not going to sing again, is
 he?"

 Okay, change of plan.

 The Prince then
 "Aww,Dad, dancing is sooo gay."

  "What do you mean "gay?""
  He looks nonplussed. "You know, not cool."

  "No son, it doesn't meant that. Not at all."

 "Then what does it mean, Dad?"

 "Uh, we'll talk about that later. Just keep in mind that it isn't a bad
 word, okay?"

 The Prince then
 "But, dad, there was no such thing here!"

 The Prince then
>looked at the sky
 "But, dad, there was no such thing here!"

 The Prince then
 "It was an old wooden bridge, made of thick logs, aged by hundreds of
 carriages, and the steps of a thousand wanderers."

 The Prince then
 The Prince smelled nothing unexpected.

 The Prince then
>looked
 At the Bridge
 "The old, (once upon a time) sturdy wooden bridge had crossed the
 Clearwater River from east to west for as long as the prince could
 remember, and according to the stories, it had been there long before
 that, built when the kingdom was young. He fondly remembered hiding in
 the thick scrub below the bridge from his father's guards when he was
 but a boy. "

 "A really dangerous looking tripedal robot stood on the bridge, casting
 the red light from his headpiece around threateningly."

 The Prince then
 "The headpiece was...er...headshaped, right...and...er...silvery as
 well..."Danny sighs, then he suddenly jumps up and says: "Yeah! And the
 prince would see it mimicking his every move-" Your son, now all full
 of exictement, shifts his body left and right, staring you right square
 in the eye. "Every..move. Because that's how these robots learned. By
 copying their enemies."
 "But what the prince also saw, was a small on/off button."
 "Danny opens his mouth to protest, but you shut him off:"Well, the
 wizard had no robot factory, so he'd had to have a way to switch it
 off." Danny frowns, unconvinced, but he's letting you continue."

 The Prince then
>examined the scrub
 "The thick scrub..." You just realized that this would be a great
 chance to tell your son all about flowers and plants. If only you knew
 something. Oh well. "...hid a secret path that led under the bridge."

 The Prince then
>walked the path
 That's not something The Prince can enter.

 The Prince then
>searched the scrub
 "The prince found some thorns. Ouch!"

 The Prince then
>found the path
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then

 Under the bridge
 "The wooden supporting structures loomed above the prince like the
 remnants of a very ecologically aware lost civilization. A muddy slope
 lead down to the water and up towards the scrub."

 "A small pebble stuck out of the mud."

 The Prince then
>go down
 "The prince decided to take the easy way out and just swim across..."
 "Come on dad, the wizard would've anticipated that. There'd be sharks
 and mines and octopuses..." "In a river?" "Just sharks and mines then!"

 The Prince then
 "To the prince it looked like this supporting structure was what kept
 the bridge from collapsing. "But Dad, wouldn't that be somewhat
 dangerous? Wouldn't it be better if they just replaced the whole
 bridge?" "Yes, son, but see, the kingdom had no money for that. It's a
 hum...tax thing. Happens everywhere."

 The Prince then
 Taken.

 The Prince then
 "It looked like these structures had been  designed in an especially
 unclimbable manner."

 The Prince then
 The Prince was carrying:
   a pebble
   a sword

 "Dad, mum never said anything of a sword!" You wink at him. "Son, this
 is a boy's story now."

 The Prince then
 Under the bridge
 "The wooden supporting structures loomed above the prince like the
 remnants of a very ecologically aware lost civilization. A muddy slope
 lead down to the water and up towards the scrub."

 The Prince then
>examine pebble
 "A small, round, white, pebble."

 The Prince then
 That's plainly inedible.

 The Prince then
>dug mud
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then
>dug the mud
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then
>dug
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then
>dig
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then
 "The mud was just that, plain old mud."

 The Prince then
 The prince prodded the mud with his boot, but found nothing useful.

 The Prince then
 No, you're trying to tell Danny that playing in the dirt is not cool.

 The Prince then
 (first taking Mud)
 No, you're trying to tell Danny that playing in the dirt is not cool.

 The Prince then
 That's plainly inedible.

 The Prince then
>go up

 At the Bridge
 "A really dangerous looking tripedal robot stood on the bridge, casting
 the red light from his headpiece around threateningly."

 The Prince then
 What did The Prince want to kill himself with?

 The Prince then
>threw the pebble at the robot
 "The prince threw the pebble with all his power, but it just bounced
 off the robot's metal hull harmlessly."

 The Prince then
 Taken.

 "The robot made a grabbing motion with one of his legs, carefully
 balancing on the other two. Then it stood on all three again."

 The Prince then
 "The prince threw the pebble with all his might..."
  Danny has folded his arms. "But he wouldn't be able to throw it hard
 enough to actually push the button. That would be ridiculous."

 The Prince then
 "The button was high up on the robot's head, and the prince could see
 no way to get up there."

 The Prince then
 "The robot kicked the prince away with one well aimed...kick. The
 prince landed a few feet away in the bushes, but immediately stood up
 again. That's an important lesson, son. They can kick you down, but you
 have to get up again."

 The Prince then
 (first taking the button)
 That seemed to be a part of the robot.

 The Prince then
 "Why did the prince do this, dad?" "Because, son, no matter how dire
 the circumstances, it's always important to keep on the sunny side of
 things."

 The Prince then
>scream
 "Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!" Danny covers his ears.

  The door opens, and Randa peeks in, and you stare sheepishly at the
 ground. "I appreciate that you fellas are having fun" she says,
 smirking motherly "but keep it down, okay?" She closes the door.

 The Prince then
 Danny says: "A magic word implemented by Will Crowther in the original
 text adventure, known as "Advent" or "Colossal Cave Adventure", among
 other names. It was the first magic word the player encountered, and
 transported the player between two locations on incantation. It is now
 included in many current games as an homage. (cf) IfWiki."

 The Prince then
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then
>jump
 "The prince jumped.

  The robot jumped, landing with a *thud*. The bridge creaked ominously,
 but held."

 The Prince then
>plover
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then
>a dw
 "David Welbourn is a canadian guy who wrote a *lot* of walkthroughs and
 works on IfWiki. Despite all this, he found time to test this game."

 The Prince then
>bother
 True fathers don't teach their sons such language!

 The Prince then
>jump
 "The prince jumped.

  The robot jumped, landing with a *thud*. The bridge creaked ominously,
 but held."

 The Prince then

 Under the bridge

 The Prince then
 Bedtime story is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long
 descriptions of locations (even if The Prince's been there before).

 The Prince then
 Under the bridge
 "The wooden supporting structures loomed above the prince like the
 remnants of a very ecologically aware lost civilization. A muddy slope
 lead down to the water and up towards the scrub."

 "This awesome Chat-MUD with a lot of helpful people on a lot of helpful
 channels."

 The Prince then
 "This unit hasn't stored any information about this."

 The Prince then
 "Well" said the robot thoughtfully, "Danny is a really bright boy. And
 handsome, too." "Dad!" says Danny, trying to act embarassed, but
 blushing and secretly smiling with pride.

 The Prince then

 The Prince then
>hit me
 (with the sword)
 "The prince pointed the sword at himself and hit his chest lightly.

  The robot raised one leg and punched himself in the headpiece. It
 staggered for a moment before it regained its composure.

 'Why is the bio-unit doing this? This hurts!'"

 The Prince then
 "The prince pointed the sword at himself and hit himself in the chest
 lightly.

  The robot raised one leg and punched himself in the headpiece just as
 lightly.
 "Wow dad, this robot learns fast!"

 "But, dad, there was no such thing here!"

>stab robot
 "Dad, you're mumbling."

 The Prince then
>attack robot with sword
 "The prince moved, drawing his sword, knowing that, the bigger they
 are, the lighter they fall."
 Danny sits up again, all excitement:"But-but-but, Dad, the robot was
 nearly invincible! See, Captain Asteroyd even fired a polytron bomb at
 it! They had to modify one of the STARLIGHT's engine to build an
 anti-matter bomb which could destroy it. Do you see why Cute-Trance
 would set up such a thing as a guard? The prince has no way to get past
 it!" You ruffle your hair, stumped.

 The Prince then

 Dropped.

 "The robot held up one of its legs, then opened the claw at its end,

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 I don't think much would have been achieved by that.

>headbutted the robot

 The Prince then
 "Dad, I only understood the first part of what you said."

 The Prince then
 "The prince sat.

 The robot sat down as well.

  Its headpiece was still high out of reach above the prince.

 So the prince stood back up."

 The Prince then
 "As the prince approached the robot, it lowered it's head, blinding him
 with the red light. "NO TRESPASSING! NO TRESPASSING! EXTERMINATION
 IMMINENT!"  Danny clutches your sleeve. "Dad! The prince better be
 careful!"

 "The prince lay down.

 The robot folded its long legs gracefully, and, by lying down it placed
 headpiece near the prince.

 The Prince then
 The prince leapt forward and pressed the button. Instantly, the whole
 robot went limp, and CRASH! BOOM! ZAM! it collapsed into a big,
 metallic heap." Danny beams at you proudly. "Captain Asteroyd never
 thought of that!" You shrug nonchalantly.


 Randa opens the door, then peeks into the room. "Sorry to interrupt you
 two, but the beginning of this game is over." "But mooom -" Danny
 begins to whine. "Sorry, son, you know the rules. Only a short intro,
 that's why it's called IntroComp." Danny pulls up his blanket. "Man,
 this is just not fair. Just as it was getting interesting" Danny pouts.
 Randa pats you on the shoulder, as you get up to kill the light.

  "Sorry, son. Maybe later."

 This game is a work of fiction. No character in this story is based
 upon the life of any real person, living or dead.

 This game would not exist in its present form if not for the generous
 assistance of Jack Mullholland. Mr Mullholland served as an
 anti-aircraft gunner in Darwin during World War II and I am extremely
 grateful to him for taking the time to share his personal experiences
 and answer my endless questions.

 DARWIN, AUSTRALIA
 SUNDAY 22 MARCH 1942

 The sun has almost risen above the tops of the gum trees at the far
 side of the field and it will soon be too hot to play cricket. From
 your position in the outfield you watch as Jenkins begins his loping
 stride towards the crease to deliver the final ball of the over. The
 other fielders, dressed only in khaki shorts, boots and wide brimmed
 hats stand stationary in the oppressive humidity. For a moment you
 think you can hear the faint throbbing drone of approaching aircraft,
 but then nothing. You tilt your head slightly, straining to hear then
 jump at the frantic clanging of the improvised air raid bell.

 "Man the bloody guns!" Sergeant Thompson yells as he drops his bat and
 lets Jenkins' ball run wide.

 The players sprint from the field to the anti-aircraft gun mounted
 behind you at the western edge of the site as the sound of aircraft
 returns louder than before.

 The worn leather cricket ball rolls to a stop near your feet.


>take ball

 Jenkins runs past you and grabs your arm, pulling you towards the
 anti-aircraft gun. "Come on you daft bugger, we've got a war to fight!"

 The assembly area
 This flat, bare-earth area connects the four anti-aircraft guns. To the
 southeast a gap in the tall earth banks that surround gun number three
 allows entry to your station. To the south, between guns three and
 four, is a low hut that serves as primitive sleeping and eating
 quarters for you and the rest of your crew. To the north, a path
 through the tall dry grass between guns one and two leads to the
 Command Post while the oval lies to the east. Beside you a crude timber
 frame suspends an old oxygen cylinder just above a shallow pit in the
 ground.

 An iron bar used to strike the cylinder in order to raise the alarm is
 resting on the ground by the frame.

 Soldiers run past you towards the four gun emplacements as bombs begin
 to fall on ships in the harbour.


 Someone grabs your hat from behind and replaces it roughly with an
 ill-fitting helmet as you are barrelled through the entrance to gun
 number three.

 The gun emplacement
 Crew members scramble to their stations around the tall anti-aircraft
 gun mounted here; the drone of the approaching single-engine Japanese
 "Val" dive bombers sharpens to a distinctive strum.

 Your heart pounds as the routine of countless drills races through your
 mind: get a shell from Smith, set the fuse on it to the appropriate
 time for the height of the aircraft then pass it to Jenkins for
 loading.

 You wait nervously for Smith as he disappears into the armoury to fetch
 a shell.



 Smith stumbles then regains his footing as he emerges from the armoury
 at speed carrying a shell for the anti-aircraft gun and your fuse
 setting tool. In two more strides he crosses the emplacement and hands
 them both to you.

 For example, to set the fuse to three and a half seconds, simply type
 "set the fuse to 35".

 Shockwaves and dissonance as a bomb explodes nearby.

 Smith ducks back into the armoury.

>set fuse to 35
 lugs engage with the holes in the fuse ring. Rotating the tool you set
 the fuse to 35 tenths of a second.

 "Right'oh Davis, pass the shell up to me now," Jenkins calls down from
 his post at the loading tray.

 Smith returns from the armoury with another shell and stands beside
 you.

 then rams it home into the chamber. Without pause, Sergeant Thompson
 pulls the firing lever and the gun responds with a deafening crack. The
 barrel recoils, slowed by the oil-filled dampers, and the hot shell
 casing is ejected onto the ground along with a plume of acrid smoke.

 The shell shrieks through the air, climbing through a steep parabolic
 arc towards the closest of the approaching "Val" dive bombers. As the
 fuse expires the shell detonates into a cloud of white smoke well below
 the aircraft.

 Smith hands you a new shell.

>set shell to 70
 lugs engage with the holes in the fuse ring. Rotating the tool you set
 the fuse to 70 tenths of a second.

 Another bomb falls too close for comfort just beyond the camp
 perimeter.

 Smith ducks back into the armoury.

 Thompson pulls the firing lever and the gun responds with a deafening
 crack. The barrel recoils, and the hot shell casing is ejected along
 with another plume of hot smoke that fills the humid air of the gun
 emplacement.

 As the fuse expires the shell detonates into a cloud of white smoke
 significantly above the aircraft.

 A nearby blast sends dust and debris over the revetments into the gun
 emplacement.

 Jenkins takes the shell from you then loads it for Sergeant Thompson to

 As the fuse expires the shell detonates into a cloud of white smoke
 that envelopes the aircraft. After what seems like minutes, the dive
 bomber emerges from the cloud in an ever tightening spiral. You watch
 with mixed emotions as the fuselage plunges into the warm waters of the
 Timor Sea.

 The rest of the gun crew erupts into a loud cheer as you scan the skies
 for any sign of parachutes.

 From the loud hailer in the command post comes the call of "Tally-ho"
 -- American P40 Kittyhawk fighters have engaged the bombers and all gun
 crews are to cease fire.

 [YOUR SCORE JUST WENT UP BY 10 POINTS]

>look
 The floor of the gun emplacement is a circular concrete pad almost ten
 metres in diameter. Sandbag revetments, back filled with earth on the
 outside, form the perimeter of the pit. The 3.7 inch Vickers
 anti-aircraft gun stands bolted to the concrete, its barrel protruding
 through fragments of camouflage netting suspended high above your head.
 The only exit from the emplacement is a gap in the revetments to the
 northwest, while a small room set into the south wall serves as an
 armoury.

 protective barrier has prevented you, or perhaps anyone else, from
 becoming particularly close to him.

 "Gunner Davis report to the command post," announces the loud hailer to
 a chorus of jeers from the other gunners. "Trouble again, eh, Davis?"
 Jenkins calls with much delight .

 The assembly area
 This flat, bare-earth area connects the four anti-aircraft guns. To the
 southeast a gap in the tall earth banks that surround gun number three
 allows entry to your station. To the south, between guns three and
 four, is a low hut that serves as primitive sleeping and eating
 quarters for you and the rest of your crew. To the north, a path
 through the tall dry grass between guns one and two leads to the
 Command Post while the oval lies to the east. Beside you a crude timber
 frame suspends an old oxygen cylinder just above a shallow pit in the
 ground.

>go north
 Tall dry grass surrounds the low sand-bag walls of the command post. A
 well-worn track through the grass leads south to the assembly area.

>go north
 The command post is nothing more than a roofless area formed by low
 sand-bag walls. Of prominence here is the Kerrison Predictor, an
 electro-mechanical computer atop a timber tripod that sends positioning
 information to four guns.

 Lieutenant Roberts is standing by the Kerrison Predictor.

 Sergeant Witheridge waits patiently by Lieutenant Roberts.

 "Davis," Lieutenant Roberts says as you enter. "Thank you for getting
 here so quickly. Soon after the first raids in February we set up an
 observation post on Melville Island to provide an early warning of
 aircraft approaching from the north. As you have just seen for
 yourself, we didn't get that warning.

 "We haven't been able to raise Melville on the radio since, so I need
 you to head out there and find out what is going on. They may have been
 bombed themselves or they may just be having radio trouble. Either way
 I need you to find out and report back to me so I've sent someone to
 ask Miki to take you out to the island. Go grab your gear then head
 down to the beach south of the oval. Miki will meet you there."

>go south
 says as he wipes the sweat from his brow. "In order to prevent enemy
 boats from landing in Snake Bay where the observation post is, the Navy
 laid a series of concrete mooring blocks, each twenty feet across."

 Lieutenant Roberts reaches into the top pocket of his shirt and hands
 you a folded piece of paper.

 "This map shows the precise location of these blocks. They're too deep
 to affect Miki's canoe, but there is a motor launch based on Melville
 and if you need to bring that back you'll need to know where they are.
 The tidal flow is restricted in Snake Bay and with a six foot draft the
 launch draws too much to clear them, even on a high tide."

 "Thank you, sir," you reply at attention.

 "Oh, and Davis, be careful. I've got a bad feeling about this one but
 with the rest of the army having pulled further inland I just can't
 spare any more men to go with you."

 "I will, sir."

 You exchange salutes with Lieutenant Roberts.

 Outside the command post
 Tall dry grass surrounds the low sand-bag walls of the command post. A
 well-worn track through the grass leads south to the assembly area.

>go south
 This flat, bare-earth area connects the four anti-aircraft guns. To the
 southeast a gap in the tall earth banks that surround gun number three
 allows entry to your station. To the south, between guns three and
 four, is a low hut that serves as primitive sleeping and eating
 quarters for you and the rest of your crew. To the north, a path
 through the tall dry grass between guns one and two leads to the
 Command Post while the oval lies to the east. Beside you a crude timber
 frame suspends an old oxygen cylinder just above a shallow pit in the
 ground.

>go south
 Mosquito netting lines the inside of this hut that serves as your
 sleeping and eating quarters. Five-foot high sandbag walls force you to
 stoop below the baking-hot corrugated iron roof. There are ten bunks
 against the far wall, one for each of the members of your crew.

 Your kit bag is under your bunk.

 Your rifle is leaning against the wall beside your bunk.

>go east
 You are standing in the outfield on the western side of Darwin Oval.
 The pitch can be seen in the centre of the oval while to the southeast
 lies a cliff edge over which the harbour can be seen. Further to the
 west the barrels of the four anti-aircraft guns can be seen above their
 surrounding revetments.

>go south
 Weathered coastal scrub covers the ground between the oval to north and
 the hill side to the south. A narrow but well-worn trail works its way
 down to the beach below.

>go down
 Deep trenches dug above the high tide line scar the beach where sand
 has been excavated for bagging. A steep path leads north from here
 through the mangroves back up to the oval.

 As you look out to sea you spot Miki, one of the local Aboriginal men,
 paddling around the point in his dugout canoe. Each powerful stroke of
 his paddle ends with a barely perceptible twist of the blade to keep
 his course. As he runs the canoe up onto the beach he places his paddle
 flat across the gunwhales and a broad smile comes to his face.

 "Come on balanda, army man saying we going to Melville," Miki shouts as
 he waves you to enter the canoe.

>enter canoe
 deeper water. Once you are wading up to your knees you jump in and Miki
 hands you a paddle.

 "You sitting up the front, balanda. Just keep paddling and I'll get us
 where we're going." Levering his paddle against the side of the canoe
 he spins the bow out to sea and the two of you head towards Melville
 Island.
