 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Yard Sale
 There are never enough tables for a yard sale.  The people who live
 here clearly have set out every table they own on the driveway in front
 of their house.  It's a mismatched array of card tables, a kitchen
 table, and a scarred white desk, all piled with miscellaneous junk.

 One item catches your eye.  It's an old, dented strongbox, barely
 visible behind a huge box fan.

>examine desk
 A few card tables, a kitchen table, and a scarred white desk are set
 out on the driveway and piled high with junk.  You'd guess these are
 all of the tables (and table-like devices) that could easily be moved
 out of the house and onto the driveway.

>examine junk
 Nothing amazing.  Boxes of old audio cassettes, a Packard Bell
 computer, ugly lamps and dilapidated board games.  The sale seems to be
 one born of a desire for more storage rather than more cash.

>examine me
 I suppose you're me.  Gregory Weir, I mean.  Mid-twenties, brown hair,
 thin.  Probably a bit scruffy.

>examine box
 (the old dented strongbox)
 This strongbox is made of metal, and is a foot across in each
 dimension.  It is covered in rust and dented in a few places.  A
 tattered label on the lid reads "Laura Bryant Collection."  A garish
 orange sticker asks for $23.  Some inner feeling makes you want to
 possess it.

>open it
 It seems to be locked.

>examine computer
 You had a Packard Bell once.  Never again.  They're impossible to
 upgrade.  Besides, this one's about a decade old.

>buy box
 (the old dented strongbox)
 You pick up the strongbox.  The rest of the transaction is fuzzy in
 your memory.  Money changed hands, and you got in your car.
 Afterwards, you kicked yourself for not asking the family's name or
 checking the street signs on your way out of the neighborhood.

 The Bryant Collection
 An Interactive Anthology by Gregory Weir
 Release 1 / Serial number 090401 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Living Room
 You've never been an especially tidy person, and being self-employed
 has done nothing to improve your habits.  Still, you keep your place
 clean, for the most part.  It's just cluttered.  The clutter is worse
 than usual at the moment, thanks to a portion of the contents of the
 strongbox scattered over the surface of your table.

 The strongbox itself sits open under the table.

 On the wooden table are a pile of letters, a memo book labeled "The End
 of the World", a composition book labeled "Morning in the Garden", a
 sketchbook labeled "The Tower of Hanoi", a stapled packet labeled
 "Going Home Again", an envelope labeled "Undelivered Love Letter", a
 wrinkled sheet of paper, and a wooden toy.

    Hints for the Tower of Hanoi








 In 2008, I found a collection of papers in an old strongbox that I
 purchased on a whim from a yard sale. They were labeled as part of the
 contents of the attic of a distant, deceased cousin of the family
 selling the box. Her name was Laura Bryant, and it seemed the family
 selling the box had not known her very well at all. Unfortunately, I
 never caught the seller's name, and I haven't been able to find out
 anything about Ms. Bryant's identity except what I learned from the
 contents of the box.

 The box contained at least a hundred sets of papers, some stapled or
 paper-clipped and others stuffed into manilla envelopes. There were a
 few letters and explanatory sheets, but the overwhelming majority of
 the pages were devoted to "story worlds," as Ms. Bryant called them.

 These story worlds seem to be analogues to what we call interactive
 fiction.  They're not as rigorously specified, of course; their
 descriptions sometimes bear more resemblance to the outline for a
 roleplaying game campaign than Inform source code. However, they seem
 to be intended for a single player, or at least a single main
 character, and they have a strangely familiar approach to their
 interaction model.  The papers indicate that the player would dictate
 actions to the person with the notes for the world, and would receive
 responses in a very turn-based fashion.

 The most interesting part is that these worlds seem to have been
 developed completely independently of the precursors to modern IF.  The
 earliest piece is from 1964, before Crowther and Woods's Adventure,
 Arneson and Gygax's Dungeons & Dragons, or even Wesely's Braunstein.
 In addition, Bryant had no connection to computers or wargaming; she
 worked as a middle-school English teacher in a time when there were
 definitely no computers in public schools, and there's no sign that she
 ever used a computer herself.

 I've "transcribed" a few of the story worlds into IF form, hoping that
 someone might be interested in playing IF written by someone who
 apparently had no familiarity with text adventures or even computers.
 Of course, I've had to take some liberties with the texts to make them
 work as IF; for the curious, I've included a partial example of an
 original description for one of the story worlds.

 I hope you have as much fun exploring these worlds as I did discovering
 them.

 Undelivered Love Letter
 by Laura Bryant

 This was supposed to be a nice visit, a respite from the loneliness of
 a long-distance relationship.  Yesterday evening, she broke the news to
 you.  You didn't eat at all today.  Right now, she's in the bathroom,
 but she'll be back in time for a final goodbye.  Then you'll leave on
 the plane, she'll stay here, and you'll never see her again.

 Terminal
 Passengers bustle through this busy airport terminal, on their way to
 and from their planes.  You're waiting near your gate, among twenty or
 thirty seats.  A gate agent bustles about near the gate.  Large windows
 overlook the tarmac, where you can see your plane sitting at the end of
 the loading bridge.  The restrooms are across the hallway, and the
 security checkpoint is a decent walk away.

 A big clock is mounted on the wall nearby.

>examine me
 You're a young man who's just finished a relationship that lasted
 years.  It was supposed to last forever.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a carry-on bag (closed)
   a boarding pass

>examine pass
 This printed slip of paper marks you as a ticket-holder, qualified to
 travel on this flight.

 X emerges from the restroom and heads this way.  She sits down beside
 you.  "Hi.  How are you doing?" she asks with a pensive look on her
 face.  Her voice has the faintest of Russian accents.

>examine x
 X has long, blonde hair that reaches her waist when unbound.  Right
 now, it's tied back in a bun.  She's wearing a long, burgundy coat with
 a white scarf tucked into the collar.  She has a thin frame and a
 heart-shaped face, with greenish-gray eyes and a nose that's just a bit
 prominent.  She's beautiful.

>talk to x
 (To talk to X, try to ASK X ABOUT something, TELL X ABOUT something, or
 just say YES or NO.)

>ask x about herself
 "How are you doing?" you ask hesitantly.

 She takes several seconds to answer.  "I'm hurting," she says.  "I hate
 seeing you this way.  But I didn't... I didn't want to continue the way
 we were."

>ask x about us
 "So... what are we now?" you ask, with pain in your voice.

 X smiles softly.  "You're still important to me.  I'd like to be
 friendly.  To keep in touch."

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

>ask x about friends
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 X lifts her hand to her face and smooths her right eyebrow.  It's a
 cute habit of hers.  "Baby..." she begins, then sighs.  "It won't hurt
 forever.  There are lots of women out there who'll fall into your
 arms."  But none of them will be her.

>ask her about flight
 (X about that)
 "Do you think you'll ever come to visit me?" you ask.

 She thinks for a long moment.  "Maybe," she says.  "If I have the time
 and the money."

>ask x about advice
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

>ask x about future
 You heard her already.  You'll "keep in touch."  It's not enough.

>ask x about memento
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

>kiss her
 (X)
 You lean toward X for a last kiss.  She leans toward you, but turns her
 head slightly so that you kiss the corner of her mouth.  She looks into
 your eyes sadly, then looks down.

 X nervously picks under her thumbnail with a nail of the opposite hand.
 "You really should eat something," she says in a worried tone.  "It's
 been almost a day since you've had any food."

 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

>examine food
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine plane
 Yours is a large, gleaming thing in white and gray.  It can take you to
 another state more quickly than anything else.  Almost.

>eat
 What do you want to eat?

>my heart
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask her about food
 (X about that)
 "Do you want to get food for yourself?" you ask.  "I don't mind.  I'm
 not hungry."

 X shakes her head.  "I'll get something when you're gone," she says.

>ask her about someone else
 (X about that)
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

>ask her about money
 (X about that)
 "How's the job going?" you ask.

 She sighs, and stretches.  "It's a diner," she explains.  "It's always
 busy and exhausting."

>shout
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>read pass
 This printed slip of paper marks you as a ticket-holder, qualified to
 travel on this flight.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 (X about that)
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 The gate agent speaks over the intercom.  "Attention, all passengers of
 Flight 160 to Indianapolis," she says in a bored tone.  "We will now
 begin boarding for all seats.  Please have your boarding pass ready."
 A line of passengers forms in front of the gate.

 X looks at you with concern.  "Are you all right?" she asks.  "Say
 something."

>hug her
 You lean over and hug X tightly.  She awkwardly rubs your back with a
 hand until you release her.

>no
 That was a rhetorical question.

>say we'll always have paris
 (to X)
 (To talk to X, try to ASK X ABOUT something, TELL X ABOUT something, or
 just say YES or NO.)

 X clears her throat awkwardly and scratches her nose.

>x, goodbye
 (To talk to X, try to ASK X ABOUT something, TELL X ABOUT something, or
 just say YES or NO.)

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>board plane
 You get into line at the gate.  X moves to stand beside you, on the
 outside of the rope barrier.

 Your turn to board the plane arrives.  You hand your boarding pass to
 the gate agent, and step into the loading bridge.  With one last glance
 over your shoulder, you see X watching you with a sad expression on her
 face.  You turn and head for the plane.

 A big clock is mounted on the wall nearby.

>examine clock
 According to the clock, it's 5:41 pm.

>examine agent
 This woman is in an airline uniform, and she is busy with her duties.
 She's responsible for making announcements, checking in passengers at
 the gate, and collecting boarding passes.

>ask agent about food
 She's really quite busy.  You'd rather not bother her.

 X emerges from the restroom and heads this way.  She sits down beside
 you.  "Hi.  How are you doing?" she asks with a pensive look on her
 face.  Her voice has the faintest of Russian accents.

>tell x about pain
 You can't summon up the effort to make conversation about that.

>tell x about me
 You tell her how sad you're feeling, and she sighs sadly.  "Poor
 sweetheart," she says.  "I'm sorry that things had to turn out this
 way."

>ask x about why
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

>tell x about plane
 "The flight will be leaving soon," you say.  "We might not see each
 other again."

 X adjusts her scarf.  "I hope we do, someday," she replies.

>kill x
 Several times since last evening you've wanted to hit her, but it was
 out of impotent frustration, not any real rage.  You love her too much
 to hurt her.

>open bag
 You open the carry-on bag.

 X nervously picks under her thumbnail with a nail of the opposite hand.
 "You really should eat something," she says in a worried tone.  "It's
 been almost a day since you've had any food."

>look in bag
 There's assorted essentials and reading materials inside.

>close bag
 You close the carry-on bag.

>buy food
 You can't see any such thing.

 That's plainly inedible.

 X clears her throat awkwardly and scratches her nose.

 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

>ask x about women
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 X looks at you with concern.  "Are you all right?" she asks.  "Say
 something."

>tell x about sadness
 You've already made your feelings clear.

 "How's the job going?" you ask.

 She sighs, and stretches.  "It's a diner," she explains.  "It's always
 busy and exhausting."

 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 The last of the passengers filters through the gate, and the gate agent

 You open the carry-on bag.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the carry-on bag.

 There's assorted essentials and reading materials inside.

 The gate agent calls out to you.  "Sir?" she asks.  "All the other

 "will never clarify its cryptic prophecies.

 "Instead of dismantling the fast food intercom, say 'It would be a
 waste of time to take that apart.  You'd only be half done before the
 police arrived.'

 "You can return each day, and the speaker will tell a new prophecy.
 After asking the restaurant employees about the prophecies, have them
 say that they have no idea what you're talking about.  They only
 remember taking your order and giving you a price.

 "The restaurant goes out of business in five days from now.  When the

 Morning in the Garden
 by Laura Bryant

 God.  He does this every day.  One would think that sooner or later
 he'd take no for an answer.  But that's not the kind of guy he is, you
 suppose.

 Beside the Tree
 You're beside the biggest tree.  Its branches stretch miles overhead,
 and its roots are like the trunks of saplings.  The ground here is soft
 and green with grass and moss.  At the edges of this clearing, plants
 grow thick.  They're all blossoming and fruiting at once, filling the
 air with perfume.  A wide path leads out of the clearing and back to
 the rest of the garden.

 Hanging low from a branch of the tree is a large fruit.

 The Serpent walks into the clearing.

>examine me
 You're Woman, and you look a lot like your boyfriend Man except with
 some bits made bigger or turned inside-out.

 The leaves of the tree above rustle in a stray breeze.

>examine tree
 This is the biggest tree in the garden, and you've been told in no
 uncertain terms not to ever, under any circumstance, eat the fruit from
 it, or you'll die.  It's not really that much of a temptation, really.
 When you have a choice between any kind of fruit or vegetable you could
 imagine, having one be forbidden isn't at all draconian.  Besides, the
 only edible thing growing on it is a single melon the size of your
 head.

 "Hello, Woman," the Serpent says, stretching his legs and scratching
 his neck with one claw.  "Are you having a nice morning?"

 "Ah, wonderful," the Serpent replies. "I've just returned from bathing
 in the Pishon.  The gold dust in the water always sticks to my scales.
 Does it look good on me?"

>examine serpent
 He's a strange creature.  Your boyfriend says he's called a "serpent,"
 but that always sounded more like someone who calculates income tax, or
 will do so once it's invented.  He's got green scales tinged with gold
 and muscular legs that end in sharp claws.  He's really the craftiest
 of all animals.  At least, he was crafty the first twenty times you
 spoke to him.  Now you've pretty well caught on.

>yes
 "Oh, you're too kind," the Serpent says with what seems to be a genuine
 smile. "It's so nice, these times we share together.  I really do
 consider you a friend, you know, Woman.  Do you feel the same?"

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>climb tree
 You could climb for years and never get to the top.

>ride serpent
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>pet serpent
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>touch serpent
 Keep your hands to yourself!

 The Serpent lets out an awkward laugh.  "Oh, sorry, you don't have to
 answer that," he says hurriedly. "Anyway, I can tell you've been
 feeling bored lately.  Isn't that right?"

 You smell a bit of smoke from the morning campfire.

 "Oh, right," the Serpent chuckles.  "Looking forward to your nightly
 game of Leaves-and-Sticks with Man, are you?"  He rolls his eyes and
 smiles. "I don't suppose you're feeling hungry.  Are you?"

>no
 Of course you're not.  You just had grapefruit, fried potatoes, and
 honeyed oats for breakfast.  But when you say no, he just chuckles
 skeptically. "Come on, Woman.  We both know you'll have to try the
 fruit sooner or later.  You have a curious nature, isn't that right?"

>no
 "No?" the Serpent asks with mock bafflement.  "This from the woman who
 once tried to open a snail's shell to see what was inside.  And we both
 know how that went." Poorly, as you remember all too well. "Here's the
 way I see it.  The Gardener, he's pretty powerful, right?  More
 powerful than you or I or even Man?"

 A butterfly flits out into the clearing, then quickly retreats back
 into the foliage.

>yes
 "Right," the Serpent begins. "He's the most powerful, so he's the one
 in charge.  Not out of some moral superiority, but out of his natural
 abilities.  He chose to make us inferior.  Does that seem right to
 you?"

 The wind picks up for a moment, and you smell the soft smell of the
 grass on the breeze.

>ask snake about garden
 Weeks ago, you announced that you were done holding real conversations
 with the serpent.  Ever since, you've responded to his inquiries with a
 terse "yes" or "no."

>eat serpent
 (first taking the Serpent)
 I don't suppose the Serpent would care for that.

 "Afraid to answer, lest a lightning bolt fall from the sky?" the
 Serpent asks venomously. "The only way the Gardener rules over us is
 through threat of punishment.  Do you think he'd be so high and mighty
 if there were others with the same power he has?"

>yes
 "Nonsense," the Serpent hisses.  "If you had the same powers as the
 Gardener, he couldn't control you."  He points a claw at you. "That's
 why he forbids you from eating this fruit.  You won't die; he only says
 that because he knows that eating it will open your eyes and make you
 like him.  Powerful and wise.  Isn't wisdom worth having, even if it
 means disobeying him?"

 Time passes.

>leave
 As you walk away, you hear the Serpent's voice calling after you.
 "Farewell, Woman!  It's your loss!"  You hear a quiet laugh, and then
 he adds, "See you tomorrow!"

 And he's right: you will see him tomorrow.  Your conversations with the
 Serpent are the most interesting parts of your life here in the garden.
 But right now it's time for another boring day.

 Living Room
 You've never been an especially tidy person, and being self-employed
 has done nothing to improve your habits.  Still, you keep your place
 clean, for the most part.  It's just cluttered.  The clutter is worse
 than usual at the moment, thanks to a portion of the contents of the
 strongbox scattered over the surface of your table.

 The strongbox itself sits open under the table.

 On the wooden table are a pile of letters, a memo book labeled "The End
 of the World", a composition book labeled "Morning in the Garden", a
 sketchbook labeled "The Tower of Hanoi", a stapled packet labeled
 "Going Home Again", an envelope labeled "Undelivered Love Letter", a
 wrinkled sheet of paper, and a wooden toy.

 Beside the Tree
 [Previous turn undone.]

>look
 Beside the Tree
 You're beside the biggest tree.  Its branches stretch miles overhead,
 and its roots are like the trunks of saplings.  The ground here is soft
 and green with grass and moss.  At the edges of this clearing, plants
 grow thick.  They're all blossoming and fruiting at once, filling the
 air with perfume.  A wide path leads out of the clearing and back to
 the rest of the garden.

 Hanging low from a branch of the tree is a large fruit.

 You can also see the Serpent here.

 "Just think about that for a while," the Serpent says.  "I won't bother
 you any more today.  Take the fruit or leave; it's your choice."

 Far off in the distance, you hear the cry of some animal or another.

>examine fruit
 This fruit is a delight to the eyes.  Its skin is the color of blood,
 and textured like a melon, but seems soft enough that you could eat the
 fruit without peeling it.  It has a depression running along the bottom
 of it that seems to divide it into two halves.  It smells sweet and
 ripe.  The whole thing is almost as big as your head, and dangles
 tantalizingly within reach.

 The Serpent digs a bit of dirt from under a claw and tries not to look
 at you.

>smell fruit
 You smell the plants around you, and occasionally the smoke of your
 morning campfire on the breeze.

>examine depression
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine branch
 The lowest branch is still far too high for you to reach.

 The Serpent glances from you to the fruit and back again.

>pray
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 You don't need to make anything out of the leaves right now.

 A bird on a branch above you suddenly calls out in a cheery snippet of
 song.

 Your singing is passable.

 A butterfly flits out into the clearing, then quickly retreats back
 into the foliage.

>fly
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine me
 You're Woman, and you look a lot like your boyfriend Man except with
 some bits made bigger or turned inside-out.

 The Serpent scratches his nose and sighs softly.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine serpent
 He's a strange creature.  Your boyfriend says he's called a "serpent,"
 but that always sounded more like someone who calculates income tax, or
 will do so once it's invented.  He's got green scales tinged with gold
 and muscular legs that end in sharp claws.  He's really the craftiest
 of all animals.  At least, he was crafty the first twenty times you
 spoke to him.  Now you've pretty well caught on.

>kiss serpent
 Keep your mind on the game.

>take fruit
 You reach up and take the fruit.  The Serpent smiles at you
 encouragingly, and you take a bite.

 It's more delicious than anything else in the garden.

>examine the end of
 This is a wire-bound memo book, about 3 by 5 inches.  There are twelve
 sheets of ruled paper left in the book, all full.  It's written in
 pencil, with no erasures, and there are what look like grease stains on
 the corners of some pages.  The earlier pages in the notebook have all
 been torn out, with only scraps remaining caught in the wire spiral
 binding.  Written on the cardboard cover in black marker is the phrase
 "THE END OF THE WORLD."  In the bottom corner is the date "1982."

>examine morning
 This is a thin notebook with a marbled black-and-white pattern on the
 cover.  Only the first handful of pages are full of writing.  The work
 is done in black pen, with numerous mistakes scribbled out and many
 doodles in the margins.  The rest of the book is blank.  On the label
 on the front of the book is the title "MORNING IN THE GARDEN," written
 in heavily-scribbled black ball-point.  On the upper right corner of
 the first page is the date "1974."

 This is a standard envelope stuffed with fifteen sheets of
 triple-folded lined paper.  The pages are loose, and are covered in
 neat writing in blue pen.  In a few places, the ink has bled where
 drops of moisture fell on the pages.  The envelope is unaddressed and
 unstamped, and the words "UNDELIVERED LOVE LETTER" are writted across
 the front.  Where the return address would be is the date "1975."

 that you never will.  The sheet reads:

 "will never clarify its cryptic prophecies.

 "Instead of dismantling the fast food intercom, say 'It would be a
 waste of time to take that apart.  You'd only be half done before the
 police arrived.'

 "You can return each day, and the speaker will tell a new prophecy.
 After asking the restaurant employees about the prophecies, have them
 say that they have no idea what you're talking about.  They only
 remember taking your order and giving you a price.

 "The restaurant goes out of business in five days from now.  When the
 restaurant goes out of business, replace the intercom with a broken
 stump.  The broken stump has description 'All that remains where the
 intercom and menu board once stood is a twisted stump of metal with a
 few wires poking out.  There's no indication of the source of the

 The Tower of Hanoi
 by Laura Bryant

 You finally got here.  It was an arduous journey, but you're finally at
 the top of the fabled Tower of Hanoi.  Before you is the priceless
 Amber Star, the most sought-after jewel in the world.  There's just one
 problem.  How are you supposed to get to it?

 Purple Room
 This is a tiny, round room.  Its walls are painted a rich purple.  In
 the center of the room is a round stone column.  There is a hexagonal
 window on the right wall.  A big cage is built into the wall, enclosing
 the window and occupying almost half of the room.  In the floor of the
 cage is a square hole, through which you can see an impassable blue
 stone surface.  Stairs outside the cage lead down through the floor,
 where you can see a room with blue walls.

 In the cage is a glass case containing an enormous jewel.

>examine cage
 This is a cage made from interlaced steel wire.  It's very
 sturdy-looking, and has no entrances or exits beyond the square hole in
 the floor inside it.  It's attached to the right wall, the floor, and
 the ceiling in such a way that the wire forms three walls of the
 enclosure and the outer wall of the room forms the fourth.  It takes up
 almost half of the room.  In the cage is a glass case containing an
 enormous jewel.

>examine jewel
 This is the most precious jewel in the world: the Amber Star.  It's the
 size of your head, and a brilliant shining yellow.  It's held firmly in
 place by a silver stand.

>examine me
 It doesn't really matter what you look like.  Let's just say you're
 you.

>examine stand
 The case is made of glass, supported by an elaborate golden pedestal.
 Within is a silver stand holding the Amber Star.  The stand holds the
 gem tightly in place.  On the side of the pedestal is a small lens
 facing the window with an engraving of a keyhole above it.

>examine lens
 This is a glass lens an inch or so across, facing toward the window as
 if to catch light shining into this room.  Above it is an engraving of
 a keyhole.

>examine window
 This is a hexagonal window, not quite big enough to climb through.
 Through the window, you can see two thin metal spires and the empty
 wasteland around this complex.

>go down
 You descend via the set of stairs.

 Blue Room
 This is a small, round room.  Its walls are painted a deep blue.  In
 the center of the room is an exposed metal pole, which goes into a
 small hole in the ceiling above.  It passes through a large hole in the
 floor, which is big enough to go through.  Through the hole, you can
 see a room with green walls.  A hexagonal window is on the left wall,
 and there is an archway leading out.  Stairs head up through the
 ceiling, where you can see a room with purple walls.

 A silver mirror is mounted in front of the window, directly above a
 lens set into the floor.

>examine archway
 This is a graceful archway that comes to a point at the top.  Through
 it, you can see a roof painted green and a sheer drop.

>out
 Outside the archway is the roof of the disk below, slick with grease
 and moisture.  Beyond that is a sheer drop.  It doesn't seem safe.

>in
 You can't go that way.

 In front of the window is an angled mirror on a silver stand, set so

 Green Room
 This is a medium-small, round room.  Its walls are painted a cool

 hexagonal window on the right wall.

 Through a large doorway in the left wall of the room you can see an
 enclosed bridge.  It seems to end in midair, with a thin metal spire
 several feet from the end of the bridge.

 A pair of small lenses is set into the ceiling and floor of the room,
 directly above each other.

>examine bridge

>pull lever
 A colossal rumbling shakes the earth, and a hissing of steam fills the
 air.  You hear a series of massive thuds as something huge rearranges
 itself.

>out

 Outside the Tower
 You stand in the middle of a vast plain sprinkled with small shrubs.
 In front of you are three thin metal spires with enormous stone disks
 threaded on to them.  An elaborate crane system looms above the spires,
 its valves and gaskets oozing steam.

 On the left spire is a tower composed of a purple room, a blue room, a
 green room, and a orange room (from top to bottom).  You can enter the
 orange room through an archway.

 On the middle spire is a tower composed of a red room (from top to
 bottom).  You can enter the red room through an archway.

 On the right spire is a tower composed of a yellow room (from top to
 bottom).  You can enter the yellow room through an archway.

 Behind you is a small tin shed.

>enter yellow

 Yellow Room
 This is a medium-large, round room.  Its walls are painted a pale
 yellow.  In the center of the room is a round stone column.  A set of
 stairs leads up to blue sky.  Through a square hole in the floor, you
 can see solid, packed dirt.  There is a hexagonal window on the left
 wall and an archway leading out.

 A narrow, steel, cylindrical device sits in the middle of the room,
 aimed at the window on the left wall.  A pipe leads from the device to
 the floor.

 A golden mirror is mounted beside the cylindrical device, directly
 below a lens set into the ceiling.

 A beam of light enters through the window on the left wall, reflects
 off of the mirror, and shines into the lens in the ceiling.

>go up
 The set of stairs leads to the roof, and it's made of stone slick with
 grease and condensed steam.  You don't trust the footing up there.

>examine lens
 Beside the cylindrical device is an angled mirror on a golden stand,
 set so that it will reflect light from the window toward a small lens
 set into the ceiling of the room.

>go down
 There's just packed dirt below the square hole.  There's nowhere to go.

>dig
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>out
 You exit via the archway.

 room with green walls.  A staircase leads down to solid, packed dirt.
 An archway leads out, and there is a hexagonal window on the left wall.

>go up
 You ascend via the a ladder leading to a square hole.

 Green Room
 This is a medium-small, round room.  Its walls are painted a cool
 green.  In the center of the room is an exposed metal pole, which goes
 into a small hole in the floor.  It passes through a large hole in the
 ceiling, which is big enough to go through.  Through the hole, you can
 see a room with blue walls.  There is a square hole in the floor,
 through which you can see a room with orange walls.  There is also a
 set of stairs leading down to an impassable orange stone surface and a
 hexagonal window on the right wall.

 Through a large doorway in the left wall of the room you can see an
 enclosed bridge.  It seems to end in midair, with a thin metal spire
 several feet from the end of the bridge.

 A pair of small lenses is set into the ceiling and floor of the room,
 directly above each other.

>go up
 The metal pole at the center of the room is too slick to climb up.

>go down
 You descend via the square hole.

 Orange Room
 This is a big, round room.  Its walls are painted a warm orange.  In
 the center of the room is a round stone column.  A ladder leads up to a

 Behind you is a small tin shed.

>enter shed
 Inside the Tin Shed
 This small tin shed is hot and humid.  A large machine takes up most of
 the floor space, with just enough room for you to stand.  Two signs are
 mounted on the wall; one is labeled "THE RULES" and the other is
 labeled "OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS."

 Mounted in the center of the machine's console is what appears to be a
 small wooden toy.  Beside it is a large lever.

 This is a huge, round room.  Its walls are painted bright red.  In the
 center of the room is a round stone column.  A set of stairs leads up
 to a room with orange walls.  A hexagonal window is in the right wall,
 and an archway leads out.

 A clanking machine sits in a corner of the room, with a hissing pipe
 leading to the ceiling.

 A strange lamp is mounted in front of the window.

 A bright, focused beam of light shines from the lamp and out the window
 on the right wall.

>go up
 You ascend via the set of stairs.

 This is a tiny, round room.  Its walls are painted a rich purple.  In
 the center of the room is a round stone column.  There is a hexagonal
 window on the right wall.  A big cage is built into the wall, enclosing
 the window and occupying almost half of the room.  In the floor of the
 cage is a square hole, through which you can see a room with orange
 walls.  Stairs outside the cage lead down through the floor, where you
 can see an impassable orange stone surface.

 In the cage is a shattered glass case containing an enormous jewel.

 A beam of light shines in through the window and hits a lens mounted on
 the pedestal supporting the glass case.

>take jewel
 You take the Amber Star from its place in the case.  You're now rich
 beyond your wildest dreams, and as the thief who bested the Tower of
 Hanoi, you will go down in infamy!

 Living Room
 You've never been an especially tidy person, and being self-employed
 has done nothing to improve your habits.  Still, you keep your place
 clean, for the most part.  It's just cluttered.  The clutter is worse
 than usual at the moment, thanks to a portion of the contents of the
 strongbox scattered over the surface of your table.

 On the wooden table are a wooden toy, an old dented strongbox (empty),
 a pile of letters, a memo book labeled "The End of the World", a
 composition book labeled "Morning in the Garden", a sketchbook labeled
 "The Tower of Hanoi", a stapled packet labeled "Going Home Again", an
 envelope labeled "Undelivered Love Letter", and a wrinkled sheet of
 paper.

>examine toy
 This is a toy made out of a wooden block with three wooden posts
 sticking out of the top.  Painted wooden disks of various sizes and
 colors fit onto the posts. At the moment, the left post has nothing on
 it, the middle post has a tiny purple disk, a large orange disk, and a
 huge red disk (from top to bottom) on it, and the right post has a
 small blue disk, a medium-small green disk, and a medium-large yellow
 disk (from top to bottom) on it.

 line on the first page reads "GOING HOME AGAIN."  On the next line is
 the date "1969."

 Going Home Again
 by Laura Bryant

 Your flight arrived an hour ago, and your parents picked you up from
 the airport.  You're just here for a little bit, to set down your
 suitcase in your old room before you go out to dinner.  Your parents
 are waiting in the car.  There'll be time to reminisce after you all
 eat.  Still, this is the first time you've been back since you
 graduated from college.

 Laundry Room
 This is the first room off of the garage, with a washer and dryer and
 some storage.  The cabinets above the dryer are where your mom always
 kept old rags for dusting, and all sorts of junk is stacked on the
 shelves across from them.  The kitchen is through a doorway, and your
 parents are waiting in the garage just outside this room.

 A set of lines drawn on the edge of the shelves catches your eye.

>examine lines
 Drawn on the edge of the shelves is a set of lines.  Each one has a
 date written beside it.  These are your height measurements from when
 you were a child.  Now, you're taller than all of them.

>read lines

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a suitcase

>examine me
 You're almost 24; your birthday is tomorrow.  You've graduated from
 college, and you've been away from this place for over half a decade
 now.  You've only just stopped thinking of it as "home."

>examine suitcase
 This is your old beat-up suitcase.  You got it when you first went off
 to college, over four years ago now.  It's covered in stickers
 advertising far-off eateries and espousing political beliefs that you
 only half-believe anymore.  You just need to drop it off in your old
 room.

>read 1969
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cabinets
 These wooden cabinets above the washer and dryer contain old rags and
 cleaning supplies, mostly.

>examine washer
 They replaced the washer and dryer just after you left for college.
 This new model is a lot more reliable than the old one.

>SAVE
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>out
 You just need to drop off your suitcase in your old room first.

>drop suitcase
 You'd rather not clutter up your hou... you mean, your parents' house.
 You can drop it off in your room.

>go to kitchen

 Kitchen
 The kitchen's about the same as you remember it, although the
 refrigerator's new.  The floor is white tile, and one wall is covered
 in cabinets.  A little basket of oranges sits out on the counter.  The
 kitchen table occupies much of the room.  The doorway to the laundry
 room is near the refrigerator, and the family room is through an open
 archway.

>examine fridge
 The old refrigerator was a simple one with a freezer on top and the
 fridge on the bottom.  You'd always assumed your parents got it as a
 wedding gift.  They've replaced it with a top-of-the-line model with
 the freezer on the bottom.  Instead of crayon drawings, the front is
 covered with years-old Dean's List certificates and newsletters from
 your parents' church.

>examine oranges
 The orange trees in the side yard always bore sour and thick-skinned
 fruit when you were growing up, but over the past few years they've
 started producing some nice, sweet oranges.  Or so your father says.

>read newsletters
 The newsletters on the refrigerator mostly have schedules for the
 standard events at your parents' church, or advertise an upcoming
 raffle or special event.  There isn't anything special scheduled during
 your visit.

>examine table
 This old scarred wooden table had a glass top to it when you were
 young.  You don't remember what happened to it, but it always got
 spills trapped under it anyway.  You're pretty sure everyone was glad
 when it finally broke or was discarded.

>go to family room

 Family Room
 The largest room in the house has high ceilings and wide windows.  The
 front door leads outside, and the hallway leads back to the bedrooms.
 The kitchen is back through an open archway.  Your dad's most recent
 chair sits here, as well as a couch and a desk.  The television is new,
 you notice, and considerably bigger than the one your parents used to
 have.

>examine tv
 This television looks huge sitting in this room.  The one you remember
 was quite a few inches smaller.  That one, in turn, replaced an even
 older one with bent rabbit ear antennas and barely-capable color.  This
 one is fancier than the TV you have at home.

 The television is currently switched off.

>turn on tv
 You don't have time for television right now.  Your parents are
 waiting.

>examine windows
 The windows look out onto the backyard.  When you were in high school,
 your parents replaced the grass back there with gravel; it wasn't worth
 keeping up grass in this hot climate.  Now, there are some citrus trees
 back there.  You think there's a tangerine tree and a lemon-lime tree,
 but you have trouble remembering exactly.

>examine desk
 This used to be your homework desk, once upon a time.  Before that,
 your mother used it in her small business.  It's one of those pieces of
 office furniture that you assemble from a kit.  At the moment, it's
 used by whichever of your parents wants to get a little work done.  An
 old office chair sits in front of it.

>examine couch
 This couch replaced your old one back when you were in middle school.
 The old one was an ancient relic, made of wood with stiff cushions and
 buttons that had mostly fallen out.  This one's much nicer.

>go to hallway

 Hallway
 This narrow hallway leads back to the bedrooms.  You used to race up
 and down it when you were small.  It's a miracle you didn't injure
 anyone trying to navigate it at the same time.  There's a big linen
 closet here, and doors for the bathroom, the master bedroom, and your
 old room.  The other end of the hallway leads back to the family room.

 Hanging on the wall in a frame is the drawing of a cat you did in high
 school.

>examine cat
 Neither of your parents considered themself creative in an artistic
 way.  They're both smart, but they're in technical fields, and the most
 cultural thing they did seriously was play in their college band
 together.  Perhaps as a result, they were startlingly impressed by this
 drawing you did in high school art class.  It's done in colored pencil,
 and it shows a cat sitting on the deck of a ship and watching a
 seagull.  Your mother gave it a place of honor in the house.  It's well
 done, you suppose, but you're still surprised (and a little flattered)
 that she thinks that highly of it.

>drop suitcase
 You'd rather not clutter up your parents' house.  You can drop it off
 in your room.

>open linen
 That's already open.

>examine linen
 The doors of this closet fold back, and they've always refused to close
 completely.  The doors are open.

>look in closet
 Nothing in there but old towels, sheets, and knitted afghans.

>examine towels
 The closet contains an assortment of linens, some of them dusty.

>examine afghans
 The closet contains an assortment of linens, some of them dusty.

>wear a sheet
 (first taking the linens)
 Your mother's sure to have already set out sheets and towels for you to
 use.  She likes being a prepared hostess.

>enter bathroom

 Hall Bathroom
 This is the bathroom you used growing up.  It's been remodeled a bit,
 but it still maintains the nautical theme that it has had since you
 were tiny.  Your mother's never considered herself artistic, but she
 seems bashfully proud of the painted wall decoration she added in the
 latest round of remodeling.  It's quite cute, you think.

>examine decoration
 According to the story your mom told on the drive here, she and your
 father recently remodeled the bathroom.  In the process, they replaced
 the old towel rods.  To mask the patch where the old rods were bolted
 to the wall, your mom painted a stylized wave to fit the nautical theme
 of the room.  It's very cute.

>enter master

 Master Bedroom
 This is your parents' bedroom.  It looks mostly the same as you
 remember, except that your mother finally replaced her old metal
 bookcase.  The bed is the one your parents got when you were young, and
 the decorations are all the same.

>examine bookcase
 Your mom got this bookcase to replace her old metal one, which had
 broken shelves and was, frankly, a bit unattractive.  The new one's
 pretty whitewashed wood, and does a much better job of holding up stuff
 than the old one did.  It's full of assorted books.

>examine books
 Various books about urban planning, childrearing, self-improvement, and
 geography.  These are clearly your mother's.

>examine bed
 This is a king-sized bed, the same one that you remember jumping into
 after having bad dreams when you were little.

>look under bed
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine decorations
 There are some pictures on the walls: one that you painted as a kid, a
 photo of the countryside near where your parents went to college, and a
 picture of a barn with a quaint advertisement painted on the roof.

>examine barn
 This is a painting of a barn beside a road.  Painted in white on the
 roof of the barn is the phrase "SEE ROCK CITY."  It's unclear what the
 advertisement is referring to.

>see rock city
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>painting
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine painting
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine photo
 The picture is taken in winter, and it's a tall hill covered in
 leafless trees.  The sky is purple and blue, and the rock at the top of
 the hill is a reddish-brown.

>examine my picture
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine your parents' bed.

>examine decorations
 There are some pictures on the walls: one that you painted as a kid, a
 photo of the countryside near where your parents went to college, and a
 picture of a barn with a quaint advertisement painted on the roof.

 This is a picture of some generic desert hills with cactuses on them.
 It's pretty rough, but you suppose it looks all right in a sort of
 abstract expressionist way.

>enter my room

 Your Old Bedroom
 During the big house redecoration when you were in middle school, you
 picked out the wallpaper and paint for this room.  You picked a forest
 theme, and insisted on keeping the lush, old, dark green carpet that
 was here when you moved in.  A lot of your things are still here,
 waiting for you to move into a place with enough space to keep it all.
 Your old bed is in one corner.  The door leads back to the hallway.

>examine things
 The closet contains boxes full of books and old childhood treasures.
 Sometime during this trip you'll go through them and pick out some
 stuff you want sent home, but not right now.

>examine wallpaper
 The wallpaper on the upper half of the walls is subtly patterned after
 birch bark.

>examine bed
 This bed looks distressingly small compared to the one you have at your
 place.  You remember that in high school your feet almost hung over the
 end of it.  Oh, well; you'll have to make the best of things.

>look under it
 You used to keep a box of treasures here, but you brought it with you
 when you left for college.

>examine carpet
 This carpet always reminded you of soft moss or the grass in a
 clearing.  Growing up in the desert made you pine for the woods.  Now
 you find yourself missing the rocks and the cacti.

 The End of the World
 by Laura Bryant

 You've got your lunch, and you've found a good spot.  Everyone knew it
 was coming, and everyone knew when.  It's time now, and there's nothing
 left to do but watch the show.

 Hillside
 There are rocks here, poking out of the side of the hill.  It's steep,
 almost too steep to keep your balance when you're standing up.  It's
 okay, though.  You're sitting down, near the top, with pretty fields
 down below and your home city in the distance, really small, like a
 model.  There's a big, flat rock right beside you, and the grass is
 wet, but that's okay too.  There are woods at the top of the hill,
 above you.

 Your lunch sits beside you on the hillside.

 I beg your pardon?

>examine city
 Tiny buildings poke up from the center of the city far below.  Further
 out, the city is a quilt of the little ticky-tacky boxes of housing
 developments and the gray dullness of strip malls.  A few cars are out
 moving around, driven by people who don't believe or don't care.

>examine sky
 The tumbling clouds above are a pale gray, tinged with pink.

 You hear a distant pop, like a sneaking giant stepping on a twig.

>examine lunch
 Simple brown paper, rolled tightly closed at the top.

>open lunch
 You open the paper lunch bag, revealing a bag of chips, a big chocolate
 chip cookie, a deviled-ham sandwich, and an apple.

>examine sandwich
 You always imagined your final meal being more elegant, but you got all
 that sort of thing finished weeks ago.  You've had your fill of somber
 foie gras and have spent too much time eating fondue at overly-cheerful
 parties.  Your mom used to send you off with deviled-ham sandwiches as
 a child.  You like deviled ham.

 Thunder sounds from somewhere in the tumbling clouds.

>eat ham
 You can't see any such thing.

>eat sandwich
 (first taking the deviled-ham sandwich)
 Toasty wheat bread, salty ham spread.  It reminds you of moments of
 introspection in raucous school lunch rooms.  All too soon, it's gone.

>examine apple
 The stores all gave away their last pineapples and oranges weeks ago,
 but there are always apples to go around.  This one's a mottled red and
 yellow.

 A low tone sounds, echoing over the hills.

>eat apple
 (first taking the apple)
 It's not a very good apple.  The skin is a little thick, and the whole
 thing's a bit too sour for your usual tastes.  But it's delicious.  You
 toss the core far into the woods nearby.  It will never grow into a
 tree.

>examine cookie
 The last of two dozen that you baked a few days ago.  It's a little
 dark on the bottom, but the rest of the batch was still good.

>eat cookie
 (first taking the big chocolate chip cookie)
 The chocolate chips are a bit melty after the long walk up here.  The
 cookie itself is sweet and rich, with just a hint of smokiness from
 leaving the cookies in the oven too long.

>examine chips
 It's a thin foil bag of potato chips, with a logo emblazoned across the
 front.  It's unopened.

 The clouds swirl and twist even more, tracing seven lines through the
 sky from behind you toward your town.

>examine lines
 The tumbling clouds above are a pale gray, tinged with pink. Seven
 twisted lines of clouds trace through the sky toward the city.

>read chips
 It's a thin foil bag of potato chips, with a logo emblazoned across the
 front.  It's unopened.

 Seven bright flaming lights burst from the clouds in the sky before
 you, letting seven shafts of light pass through to shine on the
 buildings below.

>open chips
 You open the bag of chips, revealing some potato chips.

>eat chips
 (the potato chips)
 (first taking the potato chips)
 The chips are so salty that they almost hurt your tongue.  They're just
 a little bit stale, but wonderful all the same.

 The lights strike the city below, and you have to shield your eyes from
 the bright flash that follows.

>examine city
 You can't do anything but shield your eyes from the blinding light.

 The ground shakes beneath you.

>wear bag
 (the paper lunch bag)
 (first taking the paper lunch bag)
 You can't do anything but shield your eyes from the blinding light.

 The blinding light fades, and you see countless tiny wisps of mist
 floating up from the ruined, smoldering city toward the ragged holes in
 the clouds.

>examine city
 It's not a city anymore.  It's just a heap of broken, jagged concrete
 and steel.  Fires smolder here and there, and countless tiny wisps of
 mist rise from the ashes toward the heavens.

 The rays of light filtering through the holes in the clouds suddenly
 vanish.

>examine rock
 This is a big, flat rock, embedded in the hillside.  There's a
 depression on the edge that's perfect for sitting on.

 The clouds over the city grow dark, and the darkness spreads until the
 whole sky is a murky gray.

>pray
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 You can't see any such thing.

>duck and cover
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>sing
 Your singing is passable.

 The ground begins to tremble.  The air is filled with a low howling.
 Above, the clouds seethe.

>examine clouds
>remember the duct tape
 The tumbling clouds above are a dark gray, tinged with flickers of red.
 Seven ragged holes pierce the clouds over the city, with only darkness
 visible through them.

 The clouds part overhead once more, in an enormous hole that almost
 fills the sky.  Only darkness is visible above them.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go to city
 You won't have time to make it back to the city.

 The ground shudders and the hillside cracks in great fissures.  A great
 wind rises up and rushes past you toward the city and the hole in the
 clouds.

>examine hole
 The tumbling clouds above are a dark gray, tinged with flickers of red.
 An enormous hole in the clouds hangs above you, with only darkness
 visible through it.

 The clouds peel away from the darkness above.  All is sound, a rumbling
 and howling that tears at your ears.  There is the sound of a trillion
 voices, then silence.

 Living Room
 You've never been an especially tidy person, and being self-employed
 has done nothing to improve your habits.  Still, you keep your place
 clean, for the most part.  It's just cluttered.  The clutter is worse
 than usual at the moment, thanks to a portion of the contents of the
 strongbox scattered over the surface of your table.

 On the wooden table are a wooden toy, an old dented strongbox (empty),
 a pile of letters, a memo book labeled "The End of the World", a
 composition book labeled "Morning in the Garden", a sketchbook labeled
 "The Tower of Hanoi", a stapled packet labeled "Going Home Again", an
 envelope labeled "Undelivered Love Letter", and a wrinkled sheet of
 paper.

>examine wrinkled
 This is a wrinkled sheet of paper that was at the back of the
 strongbox.  It appears to be the last page of one of Ms. Bryant's
 story-worlds, but you've yet to find the rest of it.  It's possible
 that you never will.  The sheet reads:

 "will never clarify its cryptic prophecies.

 "Instead of dismantling the fast food intercom, say 'It would be a
 waste of time to take that apart.  You'd only be half done before the
 police arrived.'

 "You can return each day, and the speaker will tell a new prophecy.
 After asking the restaurant employees about the prophecies, have them
 say that they have no idea what you're talking about.  They only
 remember taking your order and giving you a price.

 "The restaurant goes out of business in five days from now.  When the
 restaurant goes out of business, replace the intercom with a broken
 stump.  The broken stump has description 'All that remains where the
 intercom and menu board once stood is a twisted stump of metal with a
 few wires poking out.  There's no indication of the source of the
 strange mist that seemed to surround the menu board.'

 "The End."

 book, about 3 by 5 inches.  There are twelve sheets of ruled paper left
 in the book, all full.  It's written in pencil, with no erasures, and
 there are what look like grease stains on the corners of some pages.
 The earlier pages in the notebook have all been torn out, with only
 scraps remaining caught in the wire spiral binding.  Written on the
 cardboard cover in black marker is the phrase "THE END OF THE WORLD."
 In the bottom corner is the date "1982."

 You set the memo book labeled "The End of the World" back on the table.
 composition book labeled "Morning in the Garden": This is a thin
 notebook with a marbled black-and-white pattern on the cover.  Only the
 first handful of pages are full of writing.  The work is done in black
 pen, with numerous mistakes scribbled out and many doodles in the
 margins.  The rest of the book is blank.  On the label on the front of
 the book is the title "MORNING IN THE GARDEN," written in
 heavily-scribbled black ball-point.  On the upper right corner of the
 first page is the date "1974."

 (Do you want to enter this story?)

 toy that you found in the box.  Across the top is the title "THE TOWER
 OF HANOI," written in the same black marker.  On the back cover is the
 date "1978."  The first ten pages are filled with simple pencil
 drawings and notes describing the world of this story.  The rest of the
 book is filled with hauntingly realistic charcoal drawings of scenes
 from that world.

 Undelivered Love Letter
 by Laura Bryant

 This was supposed to be a nice visit, a respite from the loneliness of
 a long-distance relationship.  Yesterday evening, she broke the news to
 you.  You didn't eat at all today.  Right now, she's in the bathroom,
 but she'll be back in time for a final goodbye.  Then you'll leave on
 the plane, she'll stay here, and you'll never see her again.

 Terminal
 Passengers bustle through this busy airport terminal, on their way to
 and from their planes.  You're waiting near your gate, among twenty or
 thirty seats.  A gate agent bustles about near the gate.  Large windows
 overlook the tarmac, where you can see your plane sitting at the end of
 the loading bridge.  The restrooms are across the hallway, and the
 security checkpoint is a decent walk away.

 A big clock is mounted on the wall nearby.

 According to the clock, it's 5:41 pm.

 You're a young man who's just finished a relationship that lasted
 years.  It was supposed to last forever.

 Time passes.

 X emerges from the restroom and heads this way.  She sits down beside
 you.  "Hi.  How are you doing?" she asks with a pensive look on her
 face.  Her voice has the faintest of Russian accents.

 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 You can't see any such thing.

>showobj x
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask X about name
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 X looks at you searchingly.  She opens her mouth as if to say
 something, then closes it again.

 According to the clock, it's 5:46 pm.

>take clock
 That's fixed in place.

>kiss agent
 Keep your mind on the game.

 X clears her throat awkwardly and scratches her nose.

 Passengers bustle through this busy airport terminal, on their way to

 overlook the tarmac, where you can see your plane sitting at the end of
 the loading bridge.  The restrooms are across the hallway, and the
 security checkpoint is a decent walk away.

 A big clock is mounted on the wall nearby.

 You can also see X here.

>break window
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>tell x about pain
 You can't summon up the effort to make conversation about that.

>tell x about me
 You tell her how sad you're feeling, and she sighs sadly.  "Poor
 sweetheart," she says.  "I'm sorry that things had to turn out this
 way."

>tell x about food
 "I'm still not hungry," you say.  X just shrugs reluctantly.

>tell x about her
 You can't summon up the effort to make conversation about that.

>tell x about x
 "You're so... pretty, and wonderful," you say.  You're not sure why;
 there's no way flattery will change her mind.

 "Thank you," she says softly.

>tell x about plane
 "The flight will be leaving soon," you say.  "We might not see each
 other again."

 X adjusts her scarf.  "I hope we do, someday," she replies.

>tell x about diner
 You can't summon up the effort to make conversation about that.

>tell x about scarf
 "Your outfit looks great," you say.

 X smiles.  "Thank you," she says.

>smell x
 X smells like soap and tea with honey.

>ask x about tea
 You can't summon up the effort to ask about that.

 X lifts her hand to her face and smooths her right eyebrow.  It's a
 cute habit of hers.  "Baby..." she begins, then sighs.  "It won't hurt
 forever.  There are lots of women out there who'll fall into your
 arms."  But none of them will be her.

>tell x about habit
 You can't summon up the effort to make conversation about that.

 The gate agent speaks over the intercom.  "Attention, all passengers of
 Flight 160 to Indianapolis," she says in a bored tone.  "We will now
 begin boarding for all seats.  Please have your boarding pass ready."
 A line of passengers forms in front of the gate.

>kiss x
 You lean toward X for a last kiss.  She leans toward you, but turns her
 head slightly so that you kiss the corner of her mouth.  She looks into
 your eyes sadly, then looks down.

>hug x
 You lean over and hug X tightly.  She awkwardly rubs your back with a
 hand until you release her.

 X nervously picks under her thumbnail with a nail of the opposite hand.
 "You really should eat something," she says in a worried tone.  "It's
 been almost a day since you've had any food."

>tell x about goodbye
 "Good... goodbye," you say with a knot in your throat.

 "Goodbye, sweetheart," she replies.

>go to gate
 (the loading bridge)
 You get into line at the gate.  X moves to stand beside you, on the
 outside of the rope barrier.

>examine bridge
 The loading bridge leads from the gate inside the terminal to the
 plane.  It's designed to extend outward to accomodate whatever position
 the plane ends up in.

 Your turn to board the plane arrives.  You hand your boarding pass to
 the gate agent, and step into the loading bridge.  With one last glance
 over your shoulder, you see X watching you with a sad expression on her
 face.  You turn and head for the plane.

 than usual at the moment, thanks to a portion of the contents of the

 On the wooden table are a tiny purple disk, a memo book labeled "The

 X looks at you with concern.  "Are you all right?" she asks.  "Say
