>load sleepmask underthebed






 For seven years you have lain in your bed, terrified of the night.
 Lying in the center of your bed, where the monster couldn't reach you,
 you waited in horror for the day. Your mom and dad didn't believe that
 there were monsters. They even checked. You had resigned that this
 would be your life.

 Then your baby brother was born. For a while he slept in mom and dad's
 room, but now he's been moved into the crib in your room. And now the
 monster found an easier target. That's when you decided that it ends
 tonight. You've decided that tonight you will kill the monster. . .

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Under the Bed</span>
 Your baby brother's last chance. by Dan Doyle III
 Release 1 / Serial number 120522 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Bedroom</span>
 This is your room. Well, it was your room, now it's yours and Danny's.
 It has a closet, Danny's crib, with Danny in it and your bed. The way
 out to the hallway is to the southwest.

 On your bed is Donald Duck.

>examine donald


 Most people say that Donald Duck is just a stuffed animal, but he's
 Real to you, and that's all that matters. He would keep you feeling
 safe when the monsters would come for you at night. Talking to him
 often makes you feel better. Sometimes you think he understands you
 better than your parents, even if he only talks to you for pretend.
 You find that when you have trouble thinking about what to do next,
 it's helpful to ask Donald, or to show him other things you've found.

>examine me


 This is not the time for self-examination.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>talk to donald


 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>donald, kill monster


 "Monsters are dangerous creatures. They only come out at night, and
 the light scares them away. Normal weapons won't hurt them- not even a
 bazooka! Only light can hurt a monster." says Donald.

>dance


 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>hug donald


 You give Donald Duck a squeeze and a kiss. You'll need some courage
 for the upcoming battle.

 The room closet is empty.

>put danny in closet

 Oh, no. Last time you took Danny out of the crib your mom got so mad!
 Better not make her yell at you again. In any case, Danny is probably
 safer inside the crib than outside.

 That's hardly portable.

 In Danny's crib is Danny.

>take sword


 You grab the wooden sword, but Danny has a grip of steel on it. You
 pull harder, but he starts to get that scrunched up face he makes when
 he's about to start screaming and you ease up. You won't be able to
 save him if Mom and Dad come in and make you go to bed!

>danny, give me sowrd

 Deep down you know that Donald, being a stuffed animal, can't really
 do anything of his own accord.

 You switch the blacklight on.

 The monster shrieks at the various glowing objects in the room,
 realizing that you have some kind of source of light that it was not

 The monster slams into you, knocking you down on the floor, the sword
 falling from your grasp. You reach for the sword, and your hand justs
 graps it as the monster grabs your ankle and lifts you into the air.
 On the way down into its mouth, you reach out with the sword, just as
 the jaws of death clamp down on you, ending your life.

 Though you don't know it, the monster explodes in blackness which
 envelopes the room in darkness until daybreak, when your parents find
 your brother, safe in his crib, and you are nowhere to be found.

>take donald


 Taken.

>examine light


 It's a small black thing with a purple bulb in it that glows when you
 turn it on. Sometimes things glow when the light is on.

 The blacklight is currently switched off.

>wait


 You jump on your bed and wait for the monster to come. The time passes
 slowly in anticipation.

>turn on light


 (first getting off your bed)
 You get off of your bed.

 You switch the blacklight on.

 The clock in the living room chimes twelve times. Midnight!
 Realizing what time it is, you quickly run to your bed to prepare for
 the monster. It's now or never, you're either ready or you're not!

 You hear some growling from under the bed for a minute, but after a
 moment it stops. You wait and wait, but nothing happens. Eventually
 you realize that the sheet under the bed and the blacklight has
 effectively stopped the monster from entering your room altogether.
 You fall asleep, realizing that you need not fight the monster now
 that you have a means of keeping it out of your room-- as long as you
 keep the blacklight full of batteries!

 <span class="floydstyle i">Your Bedroom</span> (on your bed)
 This is your room. Well, it was your room, now it's yours and Danny's.
 It has a closet, Danny's crib, with Danny in it, which you have pushed
 up against the closet door and your bed. The way out to the hallway is
 to the southwest.

 The clock in the living room chimes twelve times. Midnight!
 You hear a lurking presence slathering from underneath the bed. Slowly
 a dark, barely visible mass of teeth and claws stalks slowly into the
 room. You note its pale red eyes, glowing with some kind of dead light
 glaring around the room, before resting their gaze on Danny's crib.

>turn on light


 (first getting off your bed)
 You get off of your bed.

 You switch the blacklight on.

 The monster shrieks at the various glowing objects in the room,
 realizing that you have some kind of source of light that it was not
 familar with. It makes a dash for the bed, but then realizes that its
 escape route has been blocked by the glowing white sheet you have laid
 under the bed. It stops in its tracks, and looks around, panicked,
 before looking at the closet.

 Danny bites down on the blacklight bulb, which breaks in his mouth. He
 immediately starts screaming as shards of glass cut up his mouth and
 throat. Your parents come running in, and shriek upon seeing the blood
 coming from his mouth. Mom grabs him and screams, running to call the
 hospital while Dad yells at you about giving him something so
 dangerous and for going out of your room to get it. Danny is rushed to
 the hospital, where the doctors are able to save him. But you get a
 very serious spanking. Danny is kept in the hospital for several days,
 so at least the monster doesn't get him, but still, it seems like
 there may have been a better way to save him.

>throw donald at monster


 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

 The monster runs for the closet, but with the crib in the way, finds
 itself unable to open the door. Danny's glowing white shirt forces the
 monster back away from the closet before it can get a good grip on the
 door. Realizing how complete a trap you have laid for it, and that you
 have it trapped, it turns towards you to make its final stand.

>give donald to monster


 The monster doesn't seem interested.

 The monster takes a swipe at you with razor sharp claws. It literally
 misses by a hair, making claw marks in your shirt without piercing
 your skin.

>ask donald about monster


 "Monsters are dangerous creatures. They only come out at night, and
 the light scares them away. Normal weapons won't hurt them- not even a
 bazooka! Only light can hurt a monster." says Donald.

 The monster slams into you, knocking you down on the floor. You reach
 for the sword, and your hand justs graps it as the monster grabs your
 ankle and lifts you into the air. On the way down into its mouth, you
 reach out with the sword, just as the jaws of death clamp down on you,
 ending your life.

 Though you don't know it, the monster explodes in blackness which
 envelopes the room in darkness until daybreak, when your parents find
 your brother, safe in his crib, and you are nowhere to be found.

 and then to the living room, where Mom and Dad are probably watching
 TV or something. They always get to stay up late. Back to the
 northeast is your room, and to the northwest is the laundry room where
 Mom washes your clothes. The closet here is where mom keeps extra
 blankets and stuff.

 Danny coos quietly in his crib.

 You grab the sheet, but Danny has a grip of steel on it. You pull

 you realize that the sheet under the bed and the blacklight has
 effectively stopped the monster from entering your room altogether.
 You fall asleep, realizing that you need not fight the monster now
 that you have a means of keeping it out of your room-- as long as you
 keep the blacklight full of batteries!

 as it looks towards you. It realizes it can't hurt you, since you're

 disappears into the shadows. The sight of the monster in person seems
 to have snapped something in your mind, as all you can see from then
 on is the shadowy mass of claws and teeth killing your baby brother.
 You never speak again, you barely eat again or notice what's going on
 around you, even in the morning when your parents attempt to
 interrogate you about where your brother is. Many more people try
 talking to you, but you scarcely hear them, and eventually they put
 you into a small room where no one tries to talk to you anymore. But
 they keep the light on, because when it's dark you scream.

 The monster runs for the closet, but with the crib in the way, finds
 itself unable to open the door. Danny's glowing white shirt forces the
 monster back away from the closet before it can get a good grip on the
 door. Realizing how complete a trap you have laid for it, and that you
 have it trapped, it turns towards you to make its final stand.

>wait


 Time passes.

 The monster takes a swipe at you with razor sharp claws. It literally
 misses by a hair, making claw marks in your shirt without piercing
 your skin.

>again


 Time passes.

 The monster slams into you, knocking you down on the floor, the sword
 falling from your grasp. You reach for the sword, and your hand justs
 graps it as the monster grabs your ankle and lifts you into the air.
 On the way down into its mouth, you reach out with the sword, just as
 the jaws of death clamp down on you, ending your life.

 Though you don't know it, the monster explodes in blackness which
 envelopes the room in darkness until daybreak, when your parents find
 your brother, safe in his crib, and you are nowhere to be found.

 Monsters aren't afraid of ghosts.

 The clock in the living room chimes twelve times. Midnight!
 You hear a lurking presence slathering from underneath the bed. Slowly
 a dark, barely visible mass of teeth and claws stalks slowly into the
 room. You note its pale red eyes, glowing with some kind of dead light
 glaring around the room, before resting their gaze on Danny's crib.

>put sheet under bed


 You put the sheet under your bed.

 The monster leaps towards Danny, tearing him out of the crib with its
 long arms and dropping him into its massive maw. You scream impotently
 as it looks towards you. It realizes it can't hurt you, since you're
 on your bed, so it hisses at you and dives back under the bed and
 disappears into the shadows. The sight of the monster in person seems
 to have snapped something in your mind, as all you can see from then
 on is the shadowy mass of claws and teeth killing your baby brother.
 You never speak again, you barely eat again or notice what's going on
 around you, even in the morning when your parents attempt to
 interrogate you about where your brother is. Many more people try
 talking to you, but you scarcely hear them, and eventually they put
 you into a small room where no one tries to talk to you anymore. But
 they keep the light on, because when it's dark you scream.

 glowing there." says Donald Duck. "Of course, he won't be able to
 escape back under the bed once he comes out if the sheet is glowing

 You put the sheet under your bed.

 The monster shrieks at the various glowing objects in the room,
 realizing that you have some kind of source of light that it was not
 familar with. It makes a dash for the bed, but then realizes that its
 escape route has been blocked by the glowing white sheet you have laid
 under the bed. It stops in its tracks, and looks around, panicked,
 before looking at the closet.

 Danny manages to get the cap off the laundry detergent and starts

 wrestle it away from him, and he starts choking. Panicked, you run to
 Mom and Dad, who come in to see what's going on. Mom immediately goes
