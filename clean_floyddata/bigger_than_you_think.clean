 <span class="floydstyle header">Bigger Than You Think</span>
 An interactive riff by Andrew Plotkin
 Release 4 / Serial number 130101 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 After descending into the Earth <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco Polo to the Khan)</span>
 you seek through long, silent passages of stone. Your helmet's dim
 illumination presses back the dark, but does not break it; darkness
 follows in your footsteps and obliterates them.

 You descend chasms, you crawl through low chambers. Occasionally you
 see a discarded scrap or a bootprint in the mud, for these tunnels are
 not uninhabited, but you leave these signs undisturbed and add few of
 your own. Companionship on the journey is not what you seek. Silence,
 the unchanging textures of stone lull you; you push ahead into the
 dark, but your mind wanders. Did the children of AtalantÃ« explore here
 as you do? Did they lose themselves, fade into shadow?

 You come to yourself at a chimney's precipitous lip. Not so peaceful
 an end, had you stumbled! Will you climb <span class="floydstyle i">upwards</span> or
 <span class="floydstyle i">downwards</span>?

>upwards
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You press yourself between the shoulders of stone <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Polo)</span> and begin working your way up the shaft. Your progress is
 slow, measured in the ache of your back and the strain of your thighs.

 After timeless time, you pass a hollow in the chimney wall, an opening
 into a passage that stretches out of sight. Will you enter the
 <span class="floydstyle i">passage</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span>?

>passage
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You ease yourself back onto level stone. Happily, the passage is tall
 enough for you to stand.

 You meander through the darkness, until the walls open up: a tall
 chamber, strung with irregular columns and stalagmites.

 Another pit opens at your feet, but this one is impossible to descend:
 its walls are featureless. However, someone has been this way before.
 A rough iron eye-bolt has been hammered into the pit's lip.

 Your helmet-light reflects dimly from the walls -- unless that is a
 gleam of illumination coming from up <span class="floydstyle i">ahead</span>? But you can also
 hear water trickling, somewhere off to the <span class="floydstyle i">side</span>.

>side
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You follow a descending passage, with the sound of water echoing
 somewhere ahead. You see nothing, but surely--

 Ah, here: you round a final turn, and see a dark pool ahead. It lies
 at the foot of a carved stone wall. Water trickles down the wall's
 face, feeding the pool from some unknown source above.

 The descending stream chuckles happily to itself; but the pool is
 oddly still, and opaque. But no -- your headlamp picks out a faint
 gleam, somewhere below the surface. Gold? Or the eye of some
 cave-fish, if they have eyes?

 Will you examine the <span class="floydstyle i">inscriptions</span>, or reach into the
 <span class="floydstyle i">water</span>?

>inscriptions
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 The inscriptions tell, in awkward but decipherable Latin, of a
 war-party of titans who were flung from the heavens during the gods'
 war against Cronos. These titans sailed around the edge of the world
 seven times seeking the gates of Cronos's kingdom, but they could not
 be found, for all of that ur-kingdom had been sunk into the
 underworld. The titans dug... but beyond this, the text is unreadable,
 obliterated by the flowing water.

>water

 You plunge your hand into the water. The chilly shock sends you numb,
 instantly, to the elbow. You withdraw your hand -- but the skin is
 blue, and the icy numbness is crawling up past your shoulder now. Not
 just cold, then, you think. A pity. Your helmet-lamp grows dim, and
 the stone grows distant.

 Your story will end here, unless you wish to <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> from the
 beginning.

>ahead
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 The light brightens as you approach... though only in contrast to the
 stone-darkness do you call it bright.

 Eventually you make out veins of crystal overhead, which shed the
 slow-flaring orange glow. No such phosphorescent mineral is natural to
 the Earth's geology, you are sure; is this at last the sign you have
 sought?

 The crystal veins join and knot as the ceiling rises, until you walk
 in a wide cavern as well-lit as your own study. But your study
 contains nothing like the shadows that rise ahead: stalagmites cloaked
 in shifting darkness... no, <span class="floydstyle em">trees</span>, growing underground in the
 orange light. Surely only the arts of the Lost Peoples could nurture
 such a thing, here beneath the earth.

 An umbrella lies discarded, though neatly folded, at the subterranean
 forest's eaves.

 Will you take the <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span> or advance into the <span class="floydstyle i">forest</span>?

>umbrella
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You pick up the umbrella. It's a nice big sturdy one. Why someone
 needed an umbrella underground, you have no notion.

>forest
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You move between the trees, and the orange light -- thin-spread as it
 was -- is quickly blotted out by overhanging branches. Only faint
 yellow gleams penetrate the foliage.

 It takes some time, in this rediscovered gloom, to realize that the
 glints among the foliage are paired. Eyes, in amber reflectance. You
 glance around nervously, and the eyes blink, in unison, all around
 you.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">move</span> past the watchers, or <span class="floydstyle i">stand</span>?

>stand
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You freeze, but the sense of being watched only grows more
 intolerable.

>umbrella
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You pop open the umbrella and try to hide behind it. It really doesn't
 work very well.

 You freeze, but the sense of being watched only grows more

 You turn to run, but which way? The eyes surround you. You spin,
 trying to keep your back to a tree-trunk, but it is no use: you are
 <span class="floydstyle em">seen</span>.

 Better to cast a veil over that scene. Shall we <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story

>climbing
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You push upwards, and upwards, through a shaft which is sometimes too
 wide to span and occasionally -- almost -- too narrow to pass your
 shoulders.

 You are nearly exhausted when something rough brushes your face -- a
 rope? No, a tree root; you must be approaching the surface. You haul
 yourself up into a wide root chamber, and flop full-length on the
 knobbly floor.

 "Would you like to hear a story?" asks the shaven-headed young monk.
 You sit up so fast you nearly knock your helmet off. The strange
 figure is sitting calmly at the back of the chamber, wrapped in a
 yellow robe and a sporty climbing harness.

 "I came down here to seek out the origins of the Lost Ones," the monk
 adds. You open your mouth, but can get nothing out -- is everyone in
 the world on the same quest?

 The monk raises an eyebrow, then continues. "I have found little of
 value in this chamber. A few tablets, but I couldn't make head or tail
 of them, so--" An airy gesture in the direction of the open pit behind
 you. "-- I hope you weren't in the shaft when I... no? That's all
 right then." (You shudder.) "Perhaps, then, we should pool our
 knowledge."

 Will you ask about the lost city of <span class="floydstyle i">Uabar</span> in the desert, or
 <span class="floydstyle i">AtalantÃ«</span> in the reaches of the sea?

>atalante
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 When your ship approaches AtalantÃ«, <span class="floydstyle em">(the monk begins)</span>, the
 sea appears empty -- perhaps bluer, brighter, than the remote Atlantic
 depths might warrant. You will not see AtalantÃ«'s black-sand shores
 unless you know the way, the tide, and the path of sunlight that leads
 inward to them. The Masters of the Island have a duty of privacy to
 their people, and they hold it rigorously.

 But you <span class="floydstyle em">do</span> know the way, and so you return home.

 Now you stand in the Queen's Square, lingering after the morning's
 ritual attendance. The place will soon fill with a more cheerful crowd
 -- people drifting in to sit, meet friends, eat lunch, or all three --
 but you relish the moments of quiet.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">approach</span> the sealed doors of the Temple? Or go
 <span class="floydstyle i">down</span> to the bustling markets?

>go down
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You descend the curving streets to the great market of AtalantÃ«. The
 smells of street-wagon coffee and hot frying fish strike you like...
 like... there is nothing that they are like; this is home.

 You look over a table of fireworks -- toys, though they would terrify
 the primitive Continentals you have just spent months among.
 Terrifying them, though, is not the goal. It is power that AtalantÃ«
 requires, power for the great engines and the greater ones which must
 be built. Whether that power can come from rare ores, or rock-pitch,
 or other sources yet unknown -- that is what you have spent your life
 trying to discover.

 Perhaps the answer does not lie in the remote Continents. The
 fire-dowsers have begun speaking of power from the Earth; the notion
 of rekindling the volcanic fires that once built AtalantÃ« from the sea
 floor. Dangerous, surely, but if it can be done... you have become
 weary of travel.

 But these are idle thoughts. Will you look at the <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span> or the
 <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span> tube in the fireworks tray? Or, if the markets are of no
 more interest, you may <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story from the beginning.

>flare
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>


 The merchant nods. "That will burn with a clean bright light, even
 underwater. Very practical." You take it, and pass over a slip of
 silver.

>smoke

 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 "Crack that and it will create enough smoke to fill half of the
 Queen's Square. Not that you should <span class="floydstyle em">do</span> it in the Square, of
 course!" You return his wink, and purchase the tube.

 You come to yourself at a chimney's precipitous lip. Not so peaceful
 an end, had you stumbled! Will you climb <span class="floydstyle i">upwards</span> or
 <span class="floydstyle i">downwards</span>?

 (You have equipped yourself for this journey with an <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>,
 a <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>, and a <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span> tube.)

 You press yourself between the shoulders of stone <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Polo)</span> and begin working your way up the shaft. Your progress is
 slow, measured in the ache of your back and the strain of your thighs.

 After timeless time, you pass a hollow in the chimney wall, an opening
 into a passage that stretches out of sight. Will you enter the
 <span class="floydstyle i">passage</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span>?

>go up
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You push upwards, and upwards, through a shaft which is sometimes too
 wide to span and occasionally -- almost -- too narrow to pass your
 shoulders.

 You are nearly exhausted when something rough brushes your face -- a
 rope? No, a tree root; you must be approaching the surface. You haul
 yourself up into a wide root chamber, and flop full-length on the
 knobbly floor.

 "Would you like to hear a story?" asks the shaven-headed young monk.
 You sit up so fast you nearly knock your helmet off. The strange
 figure is sitting calmly at the back of the chamber, wrapped in a
 yellow robe and a sporty climbing harness.

 "I came down here to seek out the origins of the Lost Ones," the monk
 adds. You open your mouth, but can get nothing out -- is everyone in
 the world on the same quest?

 The monk raises an eyebrow, then continues. "I have found little of
 value in this chamber. A few tablets, but I couldn't make head or tail
 of them, so--" An airy gesture in the direction of the open pit behind
 you. "-- I hope you weren't in the shaft when I... no? That's all
 right then." (You shudder.) "Perhaps, then, we should pool our
 knowledge."

 Will you ask about the lost city of <span class="floydstyle i">Uabar</span> in the desert, or
 <span class="floydstyle i">AtalantÃ«</span> in the reaches of the sea?

 When your ship approaches AtalantÃ«, <span class="floydstyle em">(the monk begins)</span>, the
 sea appears empty -- perhaps bluer, brighter, than the remote Atlantic
 depths might warrant. You will not see AtalantÃ«'s black-sand shores
 unless you know the way, the tide, and the path of sunlight that leads
 inward to them. The Masters of the Island have a duty of privacy to
 their people, and they hold it rigorously.

 But you <span class="floydstyle em">do</span> know the way, and so you return home.

 Now you stand in the Queen's Square, lingering after the morning's
 ritual attendance. The place will soon fill with a more cheerful crowd
 -- people drifting in to sit, meet friends, eat lunch, or all three --
 but you relish the moments of quiet.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">approach</span> the sealed doors of the Temple? Or go
 <span class="floydstyle i">down</span> to the bustling markets?

>temple

 You hesitantly approach the great doors. You know only what every
 citizen knows: those who seek higher training may knock and be
 admitted -- or not. You have never considered the priesthood, but
 years of travel to the Continents have knotted suddenly into a desire
 for change.

 You raise your hand... and a panel opens, silently, before you can
 knock. The face that peers out is bland and mild, awaiting some sign.
 But you do not know what is expected of you. Perhaps this is just a
 passing whim, after all.

 After descending into the Earth <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco Polo to the Khan)</span>
 you seek through long, silent passages of stone. Your helmet's dim
 illumination presses back the dark, but does not break it; darkness
 follows in your footsteps and obliterates them.

 You descend chasms, you crawl through low chambers. Occasionally you
 see a discarded scrap or a bootprint in the mud, for these tunnels are
 not uninhabited, but you leave these signs undisturbed and add few of
 your own. Companionship on the journey is not what you seek. Silence,

 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You were born in Uabar, <span class="floydstyle em">(the monk begins)</span>, great Uabar, city
 of the towers, queen of the desert. You grew in its alleys, chasing
 imaginary revolutionaries, rolling under palanquins to escape the
 dreamed pursuit of djinn-lords, dodging between coaches and
 lizard-beeves to delight phantom admirers. Soon you will be grown, and
 stately walk the avenues with a modest headcloth and the mist of
 fountain-spray brushing your face. But that day is not today.

 The men and women of Uabar crowd past you today, ignoring the slight
 form of a still-child leaning on the old stone well. (The first well
 of Uabar, which stood in the deep desert long before the People came
 here and built fountains and avenues and towers.) You hear a commotion
 in the alleys, as your playmates gather for yet another game. But your
 eyes are drawn to a nearby square: the day's debates are beginning.

 A stone key lies forgotten on the lip of the well.

 Will you pick up the <span class="floydstyle i">key</span>, run and climb <span class="floydstyle i">towers</span> with your
 friends, or slip into the <span class="floydstyle i">square</span> and hear what the citizens are
 discussing?

>key
>key

 You toss the stone key a few times -- nicely chunky -- and then tuck
 it away in your purse.

 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 There is nothing to unlock here.

 You meet your friends, but you have forgotten your climbing gear at
 home today! Oh, the embarrassment. You resign yourself to an afternoon
 of napping in the shade before dinner.

>square
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You climb the low wall and sit looking into the square. The citizens
 of Uabar talk, as they often talk, of metal: of steel and silver and
 nickel, of quicksilver and saltlith and skylith and the rarer
 alchemical metals. All the substances which are so dear in the desert,
 which have forced Uabar to grow in spires of stone, with only traces
 of precious metal within.

 A hortator stands and begins extolling the virtues of Starfall. You
 have heard the word before, but now you begin to understand its
 import: a vision of falling fire, raw ore from the sky, a bounty of
 metal for Uabar to mine from the sands. It is within reach, if enough
 citizens turn their hands to the project...

 You are entranced, and shout for the hortator, even though your voice
 is not yet legally heard. In a few months it will be; and you will
 take study with the scholars of the paths of the heavens, working to
 solve the remaining intricacies of Starfall. It will not be easy, but
 it will begin in your lifetime.

 That is another story, however. Will you <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> yours over from
 the beginning?

 You slide into the pit, and begin lowering yourself carefully from
 ledge to ledge. The stone is cool and slick; a torrent must once have
 poured down this chimney, though now only dripping moisture remains.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Caverns measureless to man?"</span> Indeed.

 After uncounted subterranean time, you pass a gaping crack, an opening
 into a twisting side canyon. The pit continues to descend, but the
 walls grow wider and smoother, and you are not certain of your safety.

 A steel crowbar is caught crossways in the shaft here -- no doubt
 dropped by an earlier explorer, somewhere above.

 Will you explore the <span class="floydstyle i">canyon</span>, take the <span class="floydstyle i">crowbar</span>, or

 Another stretched-step downward, groping for ledges with your toes.
 Then another, then another -- until slick stone shrugs your foot away.

 Now you are plunging through the darkness, which roars at you and
 blurs past your flailing hands.

 Somewhere below is the end of your journey. Such a thing should not be
 spoken of, lest one decide that life has yielded up its last marvel.

 You lever your body through the crack, and leave the chimney behind.
 The canyon doglegs wildly, but never very tightly, and with a slow,
 steady descent.

 After a time, the passage stops -- at a tall, crude, but clearly
 hand-carved marble door, set deep into the wall. Lines of petroglyphs
 spiral around its face. To either side of the door, smaller cracks
 lead away.

 Will you examine the <span class="floydstyle i">carvings</span>, try to <span class="floydstyle i">open</span> the locked

 The carvings are pictorial. They show a circle of hands approaching a
 larger circle, cut with intricate boundaries -- and if you had any
 doubt of your mark, they are now dispelled, for those outlines are
 <span class="floydstyle em">continental</span>. It is Earth which the circle-of-hands
 approaches. The map is not precise... or, no, it <span class="floydstyle em">is</span>: you make
 out the thickened land masses of the last Ice Age, twenty thousand
 years past.

 Whatever the story, these inscriptions do not reveal the end of it.
 The smaller circle shatters, and hand-outlines drift down like
 snowflakes across the world.

 not be a matter of main force.

 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You take out the stone key that you brought down into these tunnels.
 You slip it into the door's keyhole... and it turns. Click. Unlocked.

 A startling stroke of luck, this. Or -- if your theories about the
 behavior of merging histories are anywhere near right -- perhaps not
 luck at all.

 The door opens easily, or as easily as a ton of marble on limestone
 hinges could move. The chamber beyond is mostly empty, but with clear
 signs of human habitation. It appears to have been some sort of living
 space; a sleeping nook, a few carved niches for storage. One blackened
 recess is certainly a fireplace, with -- yes -- a connection to a
 natural chimney in the rear.

 The only items that remain are two folded bits of leather,
 surprisingly supple and neatly made. (Or, again... not so surprising.)
 Upon closer inspection, they appear to be shoes, quite small --
 perhaps a child's?

 Will you take the <span class="floydstyle i">shoes</span>? Or will you leave this trove for
 paleological analysis, and <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story anew?

 The narrow passage rises slightly as it runs. You turn sideways to
 slip between the limestone formations, and continue your progress.

 When green light begins seeping into the canyon, somewhere ahead, you
 are disoriented: surely you have not ascended so far as the surface?
 But you press forward, and the illumination soon dispels your
 confusion, as you step free into wide, round space -- the bottom of a
 deep sinkhole. Far above, foliage burns viridian in the distant circle
 of daylight.

 A rope sprawls in ungainly coils across the floor of the sinkhole. No

 <span class="floydstyle i">downwards</span>?

 (You have equipped yourself for this journey with an <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>,
 a <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>, a <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span> tube, a handy <span class="floydstyle i">crowbar</span>, a pair of
 small <span class="floydstyle i">shoes</span>, and a coil of <span class="floydstyle i">rope</span>.)

 <span class="floydstyle i">crowbar</span>

 You press yourself between the shoulders of stone <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Polo)</span> and begin working your way up the shaft. Your progress is
 slow, measured in the ache of your back and the strain of your thighs.

 After timeless time, you pass a hollow in the chimney wall, an opening
 into a passage that stretches out of sight. Will you enter the
 <span class="floydstyle i">passage</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span>?

 <span class="floydstyle i">crowbar</span>

 You ease yourself back onto level stone. Happily, the passage is tall
 enough for you to stand.

 You meander through the darkness, until the walls open up: a tall
 chamber, strung with irregular columns and stalagmites.

 Another pit opens at your feet, but this one is impossible to descend:
 its walls are featureless. However, someone has been this way before.
 A rough iron eye-bolt has been hammered into the pit's lip.

 Your helmet-light reflects dimly from the walls -- unless that is a
 gleam of illumination coming from up <span class="floydstyle i">ahead</span>? But you can also
 hear water trickling, somewhere off to the <span class="floydstyle i">side</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You run the rope through the eye-bolt, and fasten it with a hitch that
 you don't remember the name of. You wrap the rope around yourself and
 ease yourself steadily down the pit.

 You have only descended a few lengths, however, when your feet hit --
 not stone, but chilly metal. The pit narrows here, and someone has
 installed a heavy steel hatch, blocking the descent.

 You brace yourself on a ledge, and run your fingers over the rusty
 metal. Is this modern workmanship, showing a few years of rust... or
 an unknown alloy of lost history, just starting to decay after
 centuries?

 Will you attempt to <span class="floydstyle i">open</span> the hatch, consider its relation to
 <span class="floydstyle i">history</span>, or abandon your descent and <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story
 over?

 One might imagine <span class="floydstyle em">(you began your thesis)</span> that the impact of
 a foreign history onto ours would be comparable to the Colonial era of
 <span class="floydstyle em">our</span> history. The shock of contact; then tribes of strangers,
 perhaps with puissant arts or techne, spreading out into lands that we
 previously imagined to be our birthright; then displacement, or
 assimilation, or slaughter.

 It may be so. But this is only the simplest surface of intersection.
 The full impact of two streams of history would be impossible for any
 historic observer to judge. The ramified interactions would occur up
 and down the "linear" scale of time. Legends and stories in the mythic
 past; artifacts embedded in the historic record; prophecies, visions,
 and dialectics of the expected future; new peoples in the present, or
 nations, or even lands or seas. All would be visible (or understood,
 or inferred, or presumed) by observers in every age of history. Only
 the intangible, inexpressible <span class="floydstyle em">shock of difference</span> would mark
 the moment of intersection in the <span class="floydstyle em">now</span>...

 You tug on the hatch, but the rusty hinges defeat you. Your fingers
 slip on the damp edges -- there's nowhere to get a good grip.

>crowbar
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You unship your crowbar, wedge it under the hatch's rim, and start
 shoving. The hinges cough and wail, but soon the hatch has cracked
 open, and it is only a few more minutes before you have enough room to
 pass.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">descend</span>, or stop and consider the hatch's relation to
 <span class="floydstyle i">history</span>?

>descend
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You continue your descent for a long while. Fortunately, the chimney
 ends before your rope does, and you emerge into...

 Light -- reflecting your helmet-lamp from all directions. You blink
 for a moment, but it is not truly blinding, only startling. You peer
 around. Glittering light... and words! Or pictographs, or letters.
 Mathematical symbols, for all you know. The crystal walls are ringed
 with them, washed with them, dripping with incomprehensible runes.

 This is certainly what you have been seeking. But without further
 knowledge of the Lost Peoples and their writing systems, it will take
 years of study to absorb the meaning of this chamber.

 Lacking that time, we should <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story over from the
 beginning.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(...You begin again.)</span>

 After descending into the Earth <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco Polo to the Khan)</span>
 you seek through long, silent passages of stone. Your helmet's dim
 illumination presses back the dark, but does not break it; darkness
 follows in your footsteps and obliterates them.

 You descend chasms, you crawl through low chambers. Occasionally you
 see a discarded scrap or a bootprint in the mud, for these tunnels are
 not uninhabited, but you leave these signs undisturbed and add few of
 your own. Companionship on the journey is not what you seek. Silence,
 the unchanging textures of stone lull you; you push ahead into the
 dark, but your mind wanders. Did the children of AtalantÃ« explore here
 as you do? Did they lose themselves, fade into shadow?

 You come to yourself at a chimney's precipitous lip. Not so peaceful
 an end, had you stumbled! Will you climb <span class="floydstyle i">upwards</span> or
 <span class="floydstyle i">downwards</span>?

 (You have equipped yourself for this journey with an <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>,
 a <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>, a <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span> tube, and a pair of small

>go down
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You slide into the pit, and begin lowering yourself carefully from
 ledge to ledge. The stone is cool and slick; a torrent must once have
 poured down this chimney, though now only dripping moisture remains.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Caverns measureless to man?"</span> Indeed.

 After uncounted subterranean time, you pass a gaping crack, an opening
 into a twisting side canyon. The pit continues to descend, but the
 walls grow wider and smoother, and you are not certain of your safety.

 Will you explore the <span class="floydstyle i">canyon</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span> down?

>canyon
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 You lever your body through the crack, and leave the chimney behind.
 The canyon doglegs wildly, but never very tightly, and with a slow,
 steady descent.

 After a time, the passage stops -- at a tall, crude, but clearly
 hand-carved marble door, set deep into the wall, though slightly ajar.
 Lines of petroglyphs spiral around its face. To either side of the
 door, smaller cracks lead away.

 Will you examine the <span class="floydstyle i">carvings</span>, <span class="floydstyle i">open</span> the unlocked door,
 or continue to the <span class="floydstyle i">left</span> or <span class="floydstyle i">right</span>?

>right
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">flare</span>

 The narrow passage descends slightly as it runs, but it slowly widens
 as well.

 You are lost in thought, making your way forward, when an eerie hiss
 startles you nearly from your feet. You look back, but the canyon
 behind you is thick with shadow. There -- an oblong shape moves,
 somewhere beyond the range of your helmet lamp. It hisses again. It
 glides towards you.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">turn</span> to confront the shape, or <span class="floydstyle i">flee</span> it?

>flare
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span>


 You turn, pull the flare from your belt, and twist the cap. It bursts
 to life, etching the passage with blue-white light.

 The shape shrieks and falls backwards. You have no desire to wait and
 see if it recovers; you drop the flare and <span class="floydstyle i">run</span>.

>run
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span>

 The flare soon winks out behind you. Only the dim glow of your helmet
 precedes you down the passage. The shape -- whatever it was -- does
 not reappear behind you. Fled, stunned, or set on fire; you don't
 care, as long as it stays away.

 The tunnel runs long, and you fall back into your meditative stroll.
 And then you are startled out of it, as your lamplight is thrown back
 by a polished curve of metal.

 You move forward, picking the shape out of cavernous darkness. It is
 wide, lenticular -- ten feet high, perhaps fifty across -- in fact, it
 is the archetypical flying saucer. Only it could never have flown, not
 down here, in a natural space barely larger than the saucer's hull.

 (But is it the saucer that landed here, or the archetype...?)

 You can see the outline of a hatch, or portal, in the broad metal
 underbelly. It is a thin groove, however -- barely visible. The only
 possible means of access is a shape etched in the center of the
 portal: the outline of a human hand.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">touch</span> the panel?

>touch
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span>

 You press your hand against the outline. The metal is cave-cool -- and
 then electric-hot, for just a moment. You snatch your hand back, but
 you are unharmed.

 From somewhere within the saucer, a voice echoes, in no language you
 have ever heard. There is a pause; the question is repeated.

 You say your name, for lack of any better idea, but it provokes no
 further response. Unless you have some other notion, we will have to
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story over.

 You ease yourself back onto level stone. Happily, the passage is tall
 enough for you to stand.

 You meander through the darkness, until the walls open up: a tall
 chamber, strung with irregular columns and stalagmites.

 Another <span class="floydstyle i">pit</span> opens at your feet. A rough iron eye-bolt has been
 hammered into the pit's lip; a rope is tied to it, and descends out of
 sight. Clearly, someone has been this way before.

 Your helmet-light reflects dimly from the walls -- unless that is a
 gleam of illumination coming from up <span class="floydstyle i">ahead</span>? But you can also
 hear water trickling, somewhere off to the <span class="floydstyle i">side</span>.

>ahead
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span>

 The light brightens as you approach... though only in contrast to the
 stone-darkness do you call it bright.

 Eventually you make out veins of crystal overhead, which shed the
 slow-flaring orange glow. No such phosphorescent mineral is natural to
 the Earth's geology, you are sure; is this at last the sign you have
 sought?

 The crystal veins join and knot as the ceiling rises, until you walk
 in a wide cavern as well-lit as your own study. But your study
 contains nothing like the shadows that rise ahead: stalagmites cloaked
 in shifting darkness... no, <span class="floydstyle em">trees</span>, growing underground in the
 orange light. Surely only the arts of the Lost Peoples could nurture
 such a thing, here beneath the earth.

 Will you advance into the <span class="floydstyle i">forest</span>?

>forest
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">smoke</span>

 You move between the trees, and the orange light -- thin-spread as it
 was -- is quickly blotted out by overhanging branches. Only faint
 yellow gleams penetrate the foliage.

 It takes some time, in this rediscovered gloom, to realize that the
 glints among the foliage are paired. Eyes, in amber reflectance. You
 glance around nervously, and the eyes blink, in unison, all around
 you.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">move</span> past the watchers, or <span class="floydstyle i">stand</span>?

>smoke
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You crack the tube, and smoke gushes everywhere -- rolling between the
 trees, drifting into the foliage, and obscuring those yellow-watching
 pairs of eyes. Now! You dodge forward, hunching down into the smoke,
 and <span class="floydstyle i">run</span> for your life.

 The smoke brightens, and thins, and you realize you have broken out
 into an open glade. The orange light of the cavern roof slants down;
 the watchers appears to have gone.

 In the center of the glade, a black crystal prism lies on a small
 pedestal. Is this what the forest guardians were protecting?

 Will you take the black <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>?

 You pick up the crystal prism and turn it in your fingers. This, no
 doubt, is some artifact of the Lost; you have the rest of your life to
 discover its purpose.

 There is no more to be learned here. Let us <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story

 You push upwards, and upwards, through a shaft which is sometimes too
 wide to span and occasionally -- almost -- too narrow to pass your
 shoulders.

 You are nearly exhausted when something rough brushes your face -- a
 rope? No, a tree root; you must be approaching the surface. You haul
 yourself up into a wide root chamber, and flop full-length on the
 knobbly floor.

 "Would you like to hear a story?" asks the shaven-headed young monk.
 You sit up so fast you nearly knock your helmet off. The strange
 figure is sitting calmly at the back of the chamber, wrapped in a
 yellow robe and a sporty climbing harness.

 "I came down here to seek out the origins of the Lost Ones," the monk
 adds. You open your mouth, but can get nothing out -- is everyone in
 the world on the same quest?

 The monk raises an eyebrow, then continues. "I have found little of
 value in this chamber. A few tablets, but I couldn't make head or tail
 of them, so--" An airy gesture in the direction of the open pit behind
 you. "-- I hope you weren't in the shaft when I... no? That's all
 right then." (You shudder.) "Perhaps, then, we should pool our
 knowledge."

 Will you ask about the lost city of <span class="floydstyle i">Uabar</span> in the desert, or

>atalante

 When your ship approaches AtalantÃ«, <span class="floydstyle em">(the monk begins)</span>, the
 sea appears empty -- perhaps bluer, brighter, than the remote Atlantic
 depths might warrant. You will not see AtalantÃ«'s black-sand shores
 unless you know the way, the tide, and the path of sunlight that leads
 inward to them. The Masters of the Island have a duty of privacy to
 their people, and they hold it rigorously.

 But you <span class="floydstyle em">do</span> know the way, and so you return home.

 Now you stand in the Queen's Square, lingering after the morning's
 ritual attendance. The place will soon fill with a more cheerful crowd
 -- people drifting in to sit, meet friends, eat lunch, or all three --
 but you relish the moments of quiet.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">approach</span> the sealed doors of the Temple? Or go
 <span class="floydstyle i">down</span> to the bustling markets?

>approach

 You hesitantly approach the great doors. You know only what every
 citizen knows: those who seek higher training may knock and be
 admitted -- or not. You have never considered the priesthood, but
 years of travel to the Continents have knotted suddenly into a desire
 for change.

 You raise your hand... and a panel opens, silently, before you can
 knock. The face that peers out is bland and mild, awaiting some sign.
 But you do not know what is expected of you. Perhaps this is just a
 passing whim, after all.

 You were born in Uabar, <span class="floydstyle em">(the monk begins)</span>, great Uabar, city
 of the towers, queen of the desert. You grew in its alleys, chasing
 imaginary revolutionaries, rolling under palanquins to escape the
 dreamed pursuit of djinn-lords, dodging between coaches and
 lizard-beeves to delight phantom admirers. Soon you will be grown, and
 stately walk the avenues with a modest headcloth and the mist of
 fountain-spray brushing your face. But that day is not today.

 The men and women of Uabar crowd past you today, ignoring the slight
 form of a still-child leaning on the old stone well. (The first well
 of Uabar, which stood in the deep desert long before the People came
 here and built fountains and avenues and towers.) You hear a commotion
 in the alleys, as your playmates gather for yet another game. But your
 eyes are drawn to a nearby square: the day's debates are beginning.

 Will you run and climb <span class="floydstyle i">towers</span> with your friends, or slip into
 the <span class="floydstyle i">square</span> and hear what the citizens are discussing?

 Wait -- here are your climbing slippers! You had them in your purse
 all the time; how silly. You strap them on and leap to the tower wall,
 digging your toes into the seams of the stone.

 The day passes in a clamor of laughter and dizzy ascent. You swarm
 rooftops with your friends, claw your way over balustrades, sit in
 company and watch the sun sink over the towers of Uabar.

 What sticks in your mind, however, is a window-glimpse of a chalkboard
 of runes. You cannot climb towers forever, and surely there are
 secrets deeper than the best rooftop spots to hide-and-scurry.

 Will you return to speak to the Keepers of the <span class="floydstyle i">Runes</span>? Or shall

 After descending into the Earth <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco Polo to the Khan)</span>
 you seek through long, silent passages of stone. Your helmet's dim
 illumination presses back the dark, but does not break it; darkness
 follows in your footsteps and obliterates them.

 You descend chasms, you crawl through low chambers. Occasionally you
 see a discarded scrap or a bootprint in the mud, for these tunnels are
 not uninhabited, but you leave these signs undisturbed and add few of
 your own. Companionship on the journey is not what you seek. Silence,
 the unchanging textures of stone lull you; you push ahead into the
 dark, but your mind wanders. Did the children of AtalantÃ« explore here
 as you do? Did they lose themselves, fade into shadow?

 You come to yourself at a chimney's precipitous lip. Not so peaceful
 an end, had you stumbled! Will you climb <span class="floydstyle i">upwards</span> or
 <span class="floydstyle i">downwards</span>?

 (You have equipped yourself for this journey with an <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>
 and a unique black <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>. You have memorized the runes of
 <span class="floydstyle i">Uabar</span>.)

 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>

 You press yourself between the shoulders of stone <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Polo)</span> and begin working your way up the shaft. Your progress is
 slow, measured in the ache of your back and the strain of your thighs.

 After timeless time, you pass a hollow in the chimney wall, an opening
 into a passage that stretches out of sight. Will you enter the
 <span class="floydstyle i">passage</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span>?

>passage
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>

 You ease yourself back onto level stone. Happily, the passage is tall
 enough for you to stand.

 You meander through the darkness, until the walls open up: a tall
 chamber, strung with irregular columns and stalagmites.

 Another <span class="floydstyle i">pit</span> opens at your feet. A rough iron eye-bolt has been
 hammered into the pit's lip; a rope is tied to it, and descends out of
 sight. Clearly, someone has been this way before.

 Your helmet-light reflects dimly from the walls -- unless that is a
 gleam of illumination coming from up <span class="floydstyle i">ahead</span>? But you can also
 hear water trickling, somewhere off to the <span class="floydstyle i">side</span>.

>pit
 <span class="floydstyle i">umbrella</span>    <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>

 You wrap the rope around yourself and ease yourself steadily down the
 pit.

 You have only descended a few lengths, however, when your feet hit --
 not stone, but chilly metal. The pit narrows here, and someone has
 installed a heavy steel hatch, blocking the descent.

 You brace yourself on a ledge, and run your fingers over the rusty
 metal. Is this modern workmanship, showing a few years of rust... or
 an unknown alloy of lost history, just starting to decay after
 centuries?

 You unship your crowbar, wedge it under the hatch's rim, and start
 shoving. The hinges cough and wail, but soon the hatch has cracked
 open, and it is only a few more minutes before you have enough room to
 pass.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">descend</span>, or stop and consider the hatch's relation to
 <span class="floydstyle i">history</span>?

>descend
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>

 You continue your descent for a long while. Fortunately, the chimney
 ends before your rope does, and you emerge into...

 Light -- reflecting your helmet-lamp from all directions. You blink
 for a moment, but it is not truly blinding, only startling. You peer
 around. Glittering light... and words! Or pictographs, or letters.
 Mathematical symbols, for all you know. The crystal walls are ringed
 with them, washed with them, dripping with incomprehensible runes.

 This is certainly what you have been seeking. But without further
 knowledge of the Lost Peoples and their writing systems, it will take
 years of study to absorb the meaning of this chamber.

 Lacking that time, we should <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story over from the
 beginning.

 You recognize the rune-forms of the language of Uabar! But that is not

 unknown to you.

 You slide into the pit, and begin lowering yourself carefully from
 ledge to ledge. The stone is cool and slick; a torrent must once have
 poured down this chimney, though now only dripping moisture remains.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Caverns measureless to man?"</span> Indeed.

 After uncounted subterranean time, you pass a gaping crack, an opening
 into a twisting side canyon. The pit continues to descend, but the
 walls grow wider and smoother, and you are not certain of your safety.

 Will you explore the <span class="floydstyle i">canyon</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span> down?

 Another stretched-step downward, groping for ledges with your toes.
 Then another, then another -- until slick stone shrugs your foot away.

 Now you are plunging through the darkness, which roars at you and
 blurs past your flailing hands.

 Somewhere below is the end of your journey. Such a thing should not be
 spoken of, lest one decide that life has yielded up its last marvel.

 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>


 The notion is absurd, but do you have a better idea while plummeting
 to your death? You yank out your umbrella and pop it open.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Whump!</span> The handle yanks you around hard. You crack your knee
 and shoulder against the rushing stone... but you hang on to the
 bumbershoot, and somehow the roaring in your ears is decreasing. You
 cannot tell, in the dimness, how much the umbrella slows you -- but
 when the bottom of the pit reaches up and smacks you, the impact is
 bruising, not fatal.

 You gather yourself up from a pile of stone slabs. No, stone tablets!
 Signs and diagrams are carved across their faces.

 Will you examine the <span class="floydstyle i">tablets</span>, or shall we <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the
 story from the beginning?

>tablets
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>


 The tablets seem to show ritual poses. If you are understanding them
 correctly, they indicate different castes of a society -- priest,
 merchanter, explorer, speaker-to-crowds -- and each caste has its set
 of postures and hand signs, from low rank to high.

 You mull the diagrams, and commit a few to memory. They will certainly
 warrant further study... but immediate problem is to extricate
 yourself from this pit. That will be enough for now.

 Let us leave that climb for another telling, and <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> this
 story from the beginning.

>go up
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>     <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You press yourself between the shoulders of stone <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Polo)</span> and begin working your way up the shaft. Your progress is
 slow, measured in the ache of your back and the strain of your thighs.

 After timeless time, you pass a hollow in the chimney wall, an opening
 into a passage that stretches out of sight. Will you enter the
 <span class="floydstyle i">passage</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span>?

>go up
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>     <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You push upwards, and upwards, through a shaft which is sometimes too
 wide to span and occasionally -- almost -- too narrow to pass your
 shoulders.

 You are nearly exhausted when something rough brushes your face -- a
 rope? No, a tree root; you must be approaching the surface. You haul
 yourself up into a wide root chamber, and flop full-length on the
 knobbly floor.

 "Would you like to hear a story?" asks the shaven-headed young monk.
 You sit up so fast you nearly knock your helmet off. The strange
 figure is sitting calmly at the back of the chamber, wrapped in a
 yellow robe and a sporty climbing harness.

 "I came down here to seek out the origins of the Lost Ones," the monk
 adds. You open your mouth, but can get nothing out -- is everyone in
 the world on the same quest?

 The monk raises an eyebrow, then continues. "I have found little of
 value in this chamber. A few tablets, but I couldn't make head or tail
 of them, so--" An airy gesture in the direction of the open pit behind
 you. "-- I hope you weren't in the shaft when I... no? That's all
 right then." (You shudder.) "Perhaps, then, we should pool our
 knowledge."

 Will you ask about the lost city of <span class="floydstyle i">Uabar</span> in the desert, or
 <span class="floydstyle i">AtalantÃ«</span> in the reaches of the sea?

>atalante
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>     <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 When your ship approaches AtalantÃ«, <span class="floydstyle em">(the monk begins)</span>, the
 sea appears empty -- perhaps bluer, brighter, than the remote Atlantic
 depths might warrant. You will not see AtalantÃ«'s black-sand shores
 unless you know the way, the tide, and the path of sunlight that leads
 inward to them. The Masters of the Island have a duty of privacy to
 their people, and they hold it rigorously.

 But you <span class="floydstyle em">do</span> know the way, and so you return home.

 Now you stand in the Queen's Square, lingering after the morning's
 ritual attendance. The place will soon fill with a more cheerful crowd
 -- people drifting in to sit, meet friends, eat lunch, or all three --
 but you relish the moments of quiet.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">approach</span> the sealed doors of the Temple? Or go
 <span class="floydstyle i">down</span> to the bustling markets?

>temple
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>     <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You hesitantly approach the great doors. You know only what every
 citizen knows: those who seek higher training may knock and be
 admitted -- or not. You have never considered the priesthood, but
 years of travel to the Continents have knotted suddenly into a desire
 for change.

 You raise your hand... and a panel opens, silently, before you can
 knock. The face that peers out is bland and mild, awaiting some sign.
 But you do not know what is expected of you. Perhaps this is just a
 passing whim, after all.

>sign
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>


 You take the Postulant's Pose. The woman behind the door nods, without
 a word, and closes her panel. You stand there, gazing at the great
 Temple doors, unsure if they will open.

 There is a touch on your elbow. The woman is standing beside you. She
 gestures for you to follow, around the side of the Temple. "The doors
 are <span class="floydstyle em">very</span> noisy, you know. We usually use the back gate."

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">follow</span> her? Or shall we <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> this story from
 the beginning?

>follow
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">AtalantÃ«</span>


 You will pass into the Temple, and begin learning the deeper histories
 of AtalantÃ« -- its origins, its languages, its secret knowledge and
 its runes. The study will fill the remainder of your life. It will be
 a satisfying life -- but you will never again leave AtalantÃ«'s shores.

 You trace the writing across the walls. You are not fluent enough to
 understand it all; you will certainly return here, in the coming
 years, to absorb it all. But you grasp enough to follow the arguments,
 around and around...

 ...around and down to a niche, cunningly concealed in the chamber's
 floor. A glittering green glass <span class="floydstyle i">egg</span> rests within.

 somewhere ahead. You see nothing, but surely--

 Ah, here: you round a final turn, and see a dark pool ahead. It lies
 at the foot of a carved stone wall. Water trickles down the wall's
 face, feeding the pool from some unknown source above.

 The descending stream chuckles happily to itself; but the pool is
 oddly still, and opaque. But no -- your headlamp picks out a faint
 gleam, somewhere below the surface. Gold? Or the eye of some
 cave-fish, if they have eyes?

 Will you examine the <span class="floydstyle i">inscriptions</span>, or reach into the

 war against Cronos. These titans sailed around the edge of the world
 seven times seeking the gates of Cronos's kingdom, but they could not
 be found, for all of that ur-kingdom had been sunk into the
 underworld. The titans dug... but beyond this, the text is unreadable,
 obliterated by the flowing water.

 After uncounted subterranean time, you pass a gaping crack, an opening
 into a twisting side canyon. The pit continues to descend, but the
 walls grow wider and smoother, and you are not certain of your safety.

 Will you explore the <span class="floydstyle i">canyon</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span> down?

 You lever your body through the crack, and leave the chimney behind.
 The canyon doglegs wildly, but never very tightly, and with a slow,
 steady descent.

 After a time, the passage stops -- at a tall, crude, but clearly
 hand-carved marble door, set deep into the wall, though slightly ajar.
 Lines of petroglyphs spiral around its face. To either side of the
 door, smaller cracks lead away.

 Will you examine the <span class="floydstyle i">carvings</span>, <span class="floydstyle i">open</span> the unlocked door,
 or continue to the <span class="floydstyle i">left</span> or <span class="floydstyle i">right</span>?

 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 The door opens easily, or as easily as a ton of marble on limestone
 hinges could move. The chamber beyond is mostly empty, but with clear
 signs of human habitation. It appears to have been some sort of living
 space; a sleeping nook, a few carved niches for storage. One blackened
 recess is certainly a fireplace, with -- yes -- a connection to a
 natural chimney in the rear.

 Of personal possessions, only a few splinters of wood and flakes of
 stone remain. Nonetheless, you eagerly anticipate the dating and
 paleological analysis that this trove will offer.

 Shall we leave that for the future, and <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story anew?

>egg
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You roll the glass egg in your hand, and then fling it down on the
 stone floor. It smashes satisfyingly into a heap of green glass
 splinters.

 The splinters continue to roil and shift, however. The heap begins to
 stretch into a sort of glass tendril, which quests around feebly.
 Whatever it is seeking, it does not find; the tendril soon goes limp
 and slumps back into bits of glass.

 you seek through long, silent passages of stone. Your helmet's dim
 illumination presses back the dark, but does not break it; darkness
 follows in your footsteps and obliterates them.

 You descend chasms, you crawl through low chambers. Occasionally you
 see a discarded scrap or a bootprint in the mud, for these tunnels are
 not uninhabited, but you leave these signs undisturbed and add few of
 your own. Companionship on the journey is not what you seek. Silence,
 the unchanging textures of stone lull you; you push ahead into the
 dark, but your mind wanders. Did the children of AtalantÃ« explore here
 as you do? Did they lose themselves, fade into shadow?

 You come to yourself at a chimney's precipitous lip. Not so peaceful

 The narrow passage descends slightly as it runs, but it slowly widens
 as well.

 You are lost in thought, making your way forward, when an eerie hiss
 startles you nearly from your feet. You look back, but the canyon
 behind you is thick with shadow. There -- an oblong shape moves,
 somewhere beyond the range of your helmet lamp. It hisses again. It
 glides towards you.

 You turn, pull the flare from your belt, and twist the cap. It bursts
 to life, etching the passage with blue-white light.

 The shape shrieks and falls backwards. You have no desire to wait and
 see if it recovers; you drop the flare and <span class="floydstyle i">run</span>.

>run

 The flare soon winks out behind you. Only the dim glow of your helmet
 precedes you down the passage. The shape -- whatever it was -- does
 not reappear behind you. Fled, stunned, or set on fire; you don't
 care, as long as it stays away.

 The tunnel runs long, and you fall back into your meditative stroll.
 And then you are startled out of it, as your lamplight is thrown back
 by a polished curve of metal.

 You move forward, picking the shape out of cavernous darkness. It is
 wide, lenticular -- ten feet high, perhaps fifty across -- in fact, it
 is the archetypical flying saucer. Only it could never have flown, not
 down here, in a natural space barely larger than the saucer's hull.

 (But is it the saucer that landed here, or the archetype...?)

 You can see the outline of a hatch, or portal, in the broad metal
 underbelly. It is a thin groove, however -- barely visible. The only
 possible means of access is a shape etched in the center of the
 portal: the outline of a human hand.

 You press your hand against the outline. The metal is cave-cool -- and
 then electric-hot, for just a moment. You snatch your hand back, but
 you are unharmed.

 From somewhere within the saucer, a voice echoes, in no language you
 have ever heard. There is a pause; the question is repeated.

 You say your name, for lack of any better idea, but it provokes no
 further response. Unless you have some other notion, we will have to

 You press yourself between the shoulders of stone <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Polo)</span> and begin working your way up the shaft. Your progress is
 slow, measured in the ache of your back and the strain of your thighs.

 After timeless time, you pass a hollow in the chimney wall, an opening
 into a passage that stretches out of sight. Will you enter the
 <span class="floydstyle i">passage</span>, or continue <span class="floydstyle i">climbing</span>?

>passage
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>     <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">egg</span>

 You ease yourself back onto level stone. Happily, the passage is tall
 enough for you to stand.

 You meander through the darkness, until the walls open up: a tall
 chamber, strung with irregular columns and stalagmites.

 Another <span class="floydstyle i">pit</span> opens at your feet. A rough iron eye-bolt has been
 hammered into the pit's lip; a rope is tied to it, and descends out of
 sight. Clearly, someone has been this way before.

 Your helmet-light reflects dimly from the walls -- unless that is a
 gleam of illumination coming from up <span class="floydstyle i">ahead</span>? But you can also
 hear water trickling, somewhere off to the <span class="floydstyle i">side</span>.

>ahead
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 The light brightens as you approach... though only in contrast to the
 stone-darkness do you call it bright.

 Eventually you make out veins of crystal overhead, which shed the
 slow-flaring orange glow. No such phosphorescent mineral is natural to
 the Earth's geology, you are sure; is this at last the sign you have
 sought?

 The crystal veins join and knot as the ceiling rises, until you walk
 in a wide cavern as well-lit as your own study. But your study
 contains nothing like the shadows that rise ahead: stalagmites cloaked
 in shifting darkness... no, <span class="floydstyle em">trees</span>, growing underground in the
 orange light. Surely only the arts of the Lost Peoples could nurture
 such a thing, here beneath the earth.

 Will you advance into the <span class="floydstyle i">forest</span>?

>forest
 <span class="floydstyle i">crystal</span>     <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You move between the trees, and the orange light -- thin-spread as it
 was -- is quickly blotted out by overhanging branches. Only faint
 yellow gleams penetrate the foliage.

 It takes some time, in this rediscovered gloom, to realize that the
 glints among the foliage are paired. Eyes, in amber reflectance. You
 glance around nervously, and the eyes blink, in unison, all around
 you.

 You crack the tube, and smoke gushes everywhere -- rolling between the
 trees, drifting into the foliage, and obscuring those yellow-watching
 pairs of eyes. Now! You dodge forward, hunching down into the smoke,
 and <span class="floydstyle i">run</span> for your life.

>run
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 The smoke brightens, and thins, and you realize you have broken out
 into an open glade. The orange light of the cavern roof slants down;
 the watchers appears to have gone.

 In the center of the glade stands an empty pedestal. Has someone been
 here before you? How frustrating!

 There is no more to be learned here. Let us <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story

 poured down this chimney, though now only dripping moisture remains.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Caverns measureless to man?"</span> Indeed.

 After uncounted subterranean time, you pass a gaping crack, an opening
 into a twisting side canyon. The pit continues to descend, but the
 walls grow wider and smoother, and you are not certain of your safety.

 You lever your body through the crack, and leave the chimney behind.
 The canyon doglegs wildly, but never very tightly, and with a slow,
 steady descent.

 After a time, the passage stops -- at a tall, crude, but clearly
 hand-carved marble door, set deep into the wall, though slightly ajar.
 Lines of petroglyphs spiral around its face. To either side of the

 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 The narrow passage rises slightly as it runs. You turn sideways to
 slip between the limestone formations, and continue your progress.

 When green light begins seeping into the canyon, somewhere ahead, you
 are disoriented: surely you have not ascended so far as the surface?
 But you press forward, and the illumination soon dispels your
 confusion, as you step free into wide, round space -- the bottom of a
 deep sinkhole. Far above, foliage burns viridian in the distant circle
 of daylight.

 Will you attempt to <span class="floydstyle i">climb</span>, or <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story over?

>egg
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>


 You roll the glass egg in your hand, and then fling it down on the
 stone floor. It smashes satisfyingly into a heap of green glass
 splinters.

 The splinters continue to roil and shift, however. They seem to be
 stretching upwards; no, they <span class="floydstyle em">are</span> stretching upwards, towards
 the light far above. Soon the heap of glass has grown into a vine-like
 sprout -- two feet high, four feet high, higher than you can reach.
 Tendrils reach out and touch the sinkhole wall; and then the thing
 <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> gets going.

 When the crackling growth ceases, the vine runs all the way to the top
 of the sinkhole. Will you <span class="floydstyle i">climb</span> it?

>climb
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You touch the glass vine carefully. It is rough, but not glass-sharp,
 and even slightly flexible -- like a real vine, though you can see
 light glinting through it.

 You have plenty of time to admire the thing as you haul yourself up
 the sinkhole, of course. The climb is tiring, but quite easy.

 When you reach the top, and pull your head above the lip, you are
 briefly disappointed: this is not the surface. You are at the bottom
 of a much larger pit, open to the sunlight and thick with foliage, but
 still well below ground level.

 Then you look around, and disappointment is driven from your mind. You
 are surrounded by mounds of gold! Or, if not mounds, at least thick
 drifts. Shining gold coins lie everywhere -- half-buried in the mulch,
 overgrown by grass and saplings.

 Somewhere above, perhaps centuries ago, some tribe or nation or
 civilization must have used this crater for ritual sacrifice: not of
 blood, but of treasure. Year after year, coins dropped into the
 depths... Or is that your own cultural projection? It could have been
 sport, or challenge, or the equivalent of a wishing well.

 One day you will know -- or have a more informed guess, at least. In
 the meantime, you may take one <span class="floydstyle i">coin</span> as a souvenir, or
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story from the beginning.

 somewhere ahead. You see nothing, but surely--

 Ah, here: you round a final turn, and see a dark pool ahead. It lies
 at the foot of a carved stone wall. Water trickles down the wall's
 face, feeding the pool from some unknown source above.

 The descending stream chuckles happily to itself; but the pool is
 oddly still, and opaque. But no -- your headlamp picks out a faint
 gleam, somewhere below the surface. Gold? Or the eye of some
 cave-fish, if they have eyes?

 Will you examine the <span class="floydstyle i">inscriptions</span>, or reach into the
 <span class="floydstyle i">water</span>?

 You pull out the old gold coin with its indecipherable markings. In

 toss the coin into the pool.

 The gold sinks, becoming only another glint in the depths. Then the
 water stirs. A fish-tail slaps the surface, the fin of some long
 golden carp-like creature. Then...

 ...the fish does not <span class="floydstyle em">speak</span>. Fish can't talk. You definitely
 don't hear anything. But there is the sense of a word being
 <span class="floydstyle em">pronounced</span>, with precision and vast intent. When it is
 finished -- indeed, while it is occurring -- it is etched into your
 memory.

 The fish flips once again, and disappears into the murk. That will be

 (But is it the saucer that landed here, or the archetype...?)

 You can see the outline of a hatch, or portal, in the broad metal
 underbelly. It is a thin groove, however -- barely visible. The only
 possible means of access is a shape etched in the center of the
 portal: the outline of a human hand.

 Will you <span class="floydstyle i">touch</span> the panel?

>touch
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>

 You press your hand against the outline. The metal is cave-cool -- and
 then electric-hot, for just a moment. You snatch your hand back, but
 you are unharmed.

 From somewhere within the saucer, a voice echoes, in no language you
 have ever heard. There is a pause; the question is repeated.

 You say your name, for lack of any better idea, but it provokes no
 further response. Unless you have some other notion, we will have to
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> the story over.

>word
 <span class="floydstyle i">start</span>


 You place your hand against the outline, and pronounce the Word that
 you learned so long ago.

 The hatch does not open, exactly. But when you look again, it is an
 open space, and a curved ramp runs down from the space to the stone at
 your feet. You take it as an invitation.

 The interior of the saucer is a glass cocoon. It is difficult to focus
 on any part of the structure; some aspects seem to be revolving around
 you, although you cannot be sure. What is clear is the pedestal in the
 center. It supports a faceted matrix of black crystal, with a single
 polyhedral gap in its center.

 Is this the end of your story, or will you <span class="floydstyle i">start</span> again?

>crystal
 <span class="floydstyle i">restart</span>


 You slide the black crystal into the matrix. The pedestal retracts
 into the floor.

 You notice then -- although you're not sure how long it's been -- that
 the saucer's hatch is closed. The cocoon surrounds you entirely.

 It is not my intent <span class="floydstyle em">(said Marco Polo to Kublai Khan)</span> to
 complete this story. No, do not turn such a glance upon me! I have
 given you the necessities; you can continue the tale on your own.
 Whether the saucer is a craft of travel between worlds, or a library
 of learning, or some other unfathomable instrument -- I cannot presume
 to guess. I did not undertake this journey, these discoveries! You
 did, o Khan. Always, it was you.

 The lost cities, Uabar, AtalantÃ« -- some would number Xanadu among
 them, but do we not sit here, in your stately garden? This is your
 cocoon, Great Khan, your nest, your dome. I leave you now, to make of
 it what you will.
