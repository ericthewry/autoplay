 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 With the cantankerous Wizard of Wordplay evicted from his mansion, the
 worthless plot can now be redeveloped. The city regulations declare,
 however, that the rip-down job can't proceed until all the items
 within have been removed.

 [ ... ]








 That's what the demolition contractor explains to you, anyway, as you
 stand eagerly on the adventurer's day labor corner. Once he learns of
 your penchant for puzzle-solving and your kleptomaniacal tendencies,
 he hires you for the job. You hop into the bed of his truck, type a
 few Zs, and arrive at the site, eager ...

 Foyer
 This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper
 is peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and
 there. There is a stairway, stable enough to ascend. The big area to
 the west must have once been a separate room, but the demolition crew
 seems to have already taken out a wall. A living room is east. On the
 south side is the front door. A Dumpster has been dumped here.

 The contractor clears his throat and points at the big Dumpster.
 "Forget the fixtures, but pick up everything that's not bolted down,
 including the stuff out back. Then, drop off all the debris - er, I
 mean, um, treasures - right here ..." He scrawls something on the
 Dumpster with a marker. "Good luck!" The contractor hurries out the
 front door, which slams closed, leaving you alone.

 You spot a door to the north, leading out back. It is shut quite
 tight.

>open door
 Which do you mean, the difficult difficult difficult door or the
 southern door?

>examine dumpster
 It's made of steel, and almost entirely open on one end for easy
 deposition of debris. Scrawled across it is the phrase "ATROPHY CASE."
 Perhaps the contractor left out a space when labelling it.

>examine me
 You're the adventurer, in this scenario.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>go south
 The southern door leads out of the house. It is immediately
 recognizable as one of those doors through which one can pass only
 upon completing the game.

>open south door
 I only caught that first part. Try truncating that command or using a
 different object.

>open door
 Which do you mean, the difficult difficult difficult door or the
 southern door?

>difficult difficult difficult
 Your difficult labor pays off. You open the difficult difficult
 difficult door.

 [+2.]

>examine difficult difficult difficult door
 This difficult difficult difficult door looks like the kind that is
 always getting stuck stuck stuck. It now stands open.

>go north

 Wordplayground
 Here's a sort of small, enclosed backyard, closed in with a high
 wooden fence and completely covered with asphalt.

 A door to the s, leading inside, is open.

 A little boy stands here smugly. 'Georgie' is embroidered on his knit
 shirt.

 There's one of those robotic puppies - the latest fad - here.

 Your object-sensitive eyes also notice: ... toy dinosaur.

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>take dinosaur
 [ ... ]

>examine dinosaur
 The toy dinosaur looks like a triceratops. It is made of
 injection-molded plastic, and colored the same pale, milky green all
 over.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma was playing Zork on my computer, and
 she's so ugly, she broke the Mirror Room!"

>jump shark
 I only caught that first part. Try truncating that command or using a
 different object.

>examine boy
 The boy looks about the size for second grade, but his serious,
 bespectacled gaze suggests that he may be slightly older.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's face looks like an 'at' sign."

>boy, hello
 Georgie waves at you tentatively.

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>take boy
 You move in to hoist Georgie away from the prize, but he eludes your
 grasp. He manages to stay near the toy dinosaur, too.

 The puppy quips: "You got an elvish momma of great antiquity."

>take puppy
 The robotic puppy is endowed with locomotive abilities that are as
 quick and random as its prepackaged wit. It scuttles away from you
 quickly.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so stupid, she tried to give hypertext
 Ritalin."

>quip at puppy
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask georgie about dinosaur
 "Miiiiiiiiine!" Georgie screeches, whisking the toy dinosaur away and
 setting it down elsewhere on the asphalt. "You can't have that. Not
 unless you know more dinosaur names than me, and nobody knows more
 dinosaur names than me. So there!"

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so stupid, when you were born she
 thought the umbilical cord meant that you were a peripheral."

>triceratops
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>say triceratops
 Whom do you want to say that to?

>say triceratops to georgie
 Georgie reddens. He clenches his fists, twists back and forth while
 straining forward on his toes, and emits a trumpeting whine. "I was
 gonna say that one next!" he says. His concentration seems unbroken,
 despite this outburst.

 "Oh yeah? Tyrannosaurus!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so ugly, the computer took one look at
 her and said 'Illegal operation.'"

>say stegasaurus to georgie
 Georgie looks puzzled, as if he hasn't heard that dinosaur name
 before. He sputters for a moment, perhaps confused by the novel name,
 apparently finding it difficult to think.

 "Oh yeah? Psittacosaurus!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>say raptor to georgie
 Georgie reddens. He clenches his fists, twists back and forth while
 straining forward on his toes, and emits a trumpeting whine. "I was

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's extra-wide, and SCSI."

>say pteradon to georgie
 "Is that supposed to be a dinosaur name?" Georgie says. "Nuh-uh!"

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so stupid, she thinks she can make a
 floppy disk into a hard disk by pulling on it."

>say brontosaurus to georgie
 Georgie reddens. He clenches his fists, twists back and forth while
 straining forward on his toes, and emits a trumpeting whine. "I was
 gonna say that one next!" he says. His concentration seems unbroken,
 despite this outburst.

 "Oh yeah? Theropod!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>say apatasaurus to georgie
 Georgie looks puzzled, as if he hasn't heard that dinosaur name
 before. He sputters for a moment, perhaps confused by the novel name,
 apparently finding it difficult to think.

 "Oh yeah? Hadrosaur!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>say hydropsaur to georgie
 Georgie looks puzzled, as if he hasn't heard that dinosaur name
 before. He sputters for a moment, perhaps confused by the novel name,
 apparently finding it difficult to think.

 "Oh yeah? Supersaurus!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so fat she'd barely fit on five
 CD-ROMs."

>say godzilla to georgie
 "Is that supposed to be a dinosaur name?" Georgie says. "Nuh-uh!"

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so poor, she's got a C-64."

 "Is that supposed to be a dinosaur name?" Georgie says. "Nuh-uh!"

 The puppy quips: "Your momma goes down more often than Windows 98."

>say puppy to georgie
 "Is that supposed to be a dinosaur name?" Georgie says. "Nuh-uh!"

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so stupid, when she got hungry she
 asked people to forward spam to her."

>kick georgie
 Georgie is deft at eluding playground bullies, and dodges your attack.
 "You don't know-ow dinosaur names," Georgie sings. "You're just a
 stupid me-e-nie!" He manages to remain quite near the toy dinosaur,
 though.
>say dino to georgie

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so stupid, she thought USENET was
 previously owned."

 "Miiiiiiiiine!" Georgie screeches, whisking the toy dinosaur away and
 setting it down elsewhere on the asphalt. "You can't have that. Not
 unless you know more dinosaur names than me, and nobody knows more
 dinosaur names than me. So there!"

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>say abcsaur to georgie
 "Is that supposed to be a dinosaur name?" Georgie says. "Nuh-uh!"

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so stupid, when tech support told her
 to reboot she started putting her shoes back on."

>say abcsaurus to georgie
 Georgie looks puzzled, as if he hasn't heard that dinosaur name
 before. He sputters for a moment, perhaps confused by the novel name,
 apparently finding it difficult to think.

 "Oh yeah? Prosauropod!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so fat, they're trying to break her up
 like Microsoft."

>say stegosaurus to georgie
 "Oh yeah? Pterosaurus!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>xyzzy
 Georgie lets out a high-pitched laugh. "That one's already been
 sa-aid!" he sings, taunting you. "You don't know any mo-ore dinosaur
 names!"

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so butch, she shops at Amazon."

 A distracted figure with a huge bushy beard blunders in just as you
 speak the word of ancient magic. The man wears loose clothing, and an
 expression of intense concentration. He is clutching his frizzy hair
 with one hand; his other hand grips an intricate grid - the object of
 his attention.

 His eyes brighten as the word you've spoken reaches his ears. "Yes!
 Yes! That's it!" he exclaims as he draws out a pen and fills in a row
 of squares. "Now my hyperconstrained, double-acrostic, cryptic
 crossword is complete, and ready to puzzle others. That was all I
 needed - just a simple five-letter word, composed only of the letters
 'X' 'Y' and 'Z,' that would fit here!"

 He grips your hand and shakes it fervently. "Thank you! Now that I've
 finished with that, I can get on to those other things I've been
 meaning to do, such as monkey-wrenching the demolition and saving
 recreational linguistics for future generations." He turns away and
 mutters, just before he departs, "I hope none of that will involve
 lying in front of a bulldozer..."

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

 [+1.]

>say thing1saurus to georgie
 Georgie looks puzzled, as if he hasn't heard that dinosaur name
 before. He sputters for a moment, perhaps confused by the novel name,
 apparently finding it difficult to think.

 "Oh yeah? Mosasaurus!" Georgie says, with pride.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's faster than 1GHz."

>say thing2saurus to georgie
 Georgie looks puzzled - for a moment. "Hey, you just said something
 like that," he says. "That doesn't count."

 The puppy quips: "I checked out www.uglydog.com the other day - and
 guess who I saw?"

>say applesaurus to georgie
 Georgie looks puzzled, as if he hasn't heard that dinosaur name
 before. He sputters for a moment, perhaps confused by the novel name,
 apparently finding it difficult to think.

 Georgie sniffs. His eyes become large, resembling the eyes of an
 affrighted waif-child in a Margaret Keene painting. A big shiny tear
 gleams beneath his glasses, dripping from his right eye. Then the
 boy's face reddens as a bead of snot begins to droop from his left
 nostril. "That's ... I don't ... that's all the dinosaur names I know.
 Uh, well ... Waaaaaaaaah!"

 He gives the toy dinosaur a little kick, tipping it over. "Well, it's
 just a stupid toy. You can have it, anyway. So what!" Georgie runs
 through the difficult difficult difficult door, then runs across the
 foyer and out the front door of the house, disappearing.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so ugly, she broke the QuickCam."

>take dinosaur
 Taken.

 The puppy quips: "I saw your momma selling herself on eBay yesterday."

 [+10.]

>kick puppy
 The robotic puppy is endowed with locomotive abilities that are as
 quick and random as its prepackaged wit. It scuttles away from you
 quickly.

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>take puppy

 The puppy quips: "Your momma provides service on every port."

>say your momma to puppy
 The puppy doesn't seem to notice you speaking to it. Perhaps this
 cut-rate model doesn't accept voice commands or queries.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so ugly I need a screen saver to look
 at her."

>throw dinosaur at puppy
 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's so stupid, when I told her I was
 backing up my computer she said I should eat more fiber."

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   ... toy dinosaur

 The puppy quips: "Your momma's plug-and-play."

>turn puppy off
 That's not something you can switch.

 The puppy quips: "The Wizard of Frobozz took one look at your momma
 and said, 'Fugly!'"

>ask boy about puppy
 You can't see any such thing.

 Waaaah!

 The puppy lets out a derisive little puppy laugh.

>go south

 Foyer
 This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper
 is peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and
 there. There is a stairway, stable enough to ascend. The big area to
 the w must have once been a separate room, but the demolition crew
 seems to have already taken out a wall. A living room is e. On the s
 side is the front door. A Dumpster has been dumped here.

 A door to the n, leading out back, is open.

>put dinosaur in dumpster

>go west
 That area used to a be a separate room, but it's all part of the foyer
 now. There's no part of the house further to the west.

>go east

 Living Room
 This huge, bare living room occupies about half the mansion's ground
 floor.

 Your object-sensitive eyes notice: ... verbosifier.

>examine verbosifier
 This device is about the size of a Walkman, with a long antenna
 extending from it and a rectangular button labeled "VERBOSIFY."

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 A bearded figure wanders in, oblivious to you and, it seems, somewhat
 uncertain of where he is going. His loose clothing billows as he steps
 about.

 "Walk east..." he mutters. He stops short after a few steps. "Walk not
 east!" he exclaims, and starts going in the opposite direction. He
 stops again, wanders around a bit, and finally leaves. By the time
 you've recovered from the shock, you realize that he has completely
 disappeared.

 Initial Lobby
 The lobby of the mansion's initial floor - the one above the ground
 floor - is an ordinary and fairly well-maintained room. There are some
 things scrawled on the ground here, in the contractor's handwriting:
 '1 object' is written to the north, while toward the other three exits
 on this floor '2' is scrawled. The stairway that runs down to the
 foyer turns and continues up, to the next floor. The constrained
 passages to the north, east, west, and south look as if they might
 spell trouble. Or perhaps they simply spell 'NEWS.'

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>go north
 You'll never get through that constrained passage carrying that
 verbosifier.

>drop verbosifier
 Dropped.

>go north
 A pillow-like force keeps you from moving that way. A sonorous voice
 booms out, in attempted hollowness, "You may be very, very frustrated
 if you walk in there without reading the WARNING. Sure, maybe you read
 the WARNING three years ago in some other game session and you
 remember it perfectly, but how do I know that? I'm not supposed to let
 you in unless I know you've read it. It's like airline flight
 attendants have to keep showing you how to use the seatbelt even if
 you've been on a plane for a third of your life."

 There is a hollow sigh.

 "So just go on and read the WARNING, by typing WARNING. And then I'll
 let you in."

>warning

 While interacting with Ad Verbum, it is possible to enter areas that
 seem impossible to leave by normal means. These areas are not actually
 impossible to leave, but departure can be very difficult. The
 challenge of Ad Verbum lies, in part, in figuring out how to exit from
 these areas. Because of the nature of interaction in these areas they
 do not, in general, allow one to employ the HINT, SAVE, RESTART,
 RESTORE or QUIT commands. A somewhat hollow voice will reveal a magic
 word when you enter each of these rooms, allowing you to escape them.
 If you ignore this text, you might get stuck in these rooms and have
 to quit your interpreter. Read carefully.

>go north
 "LISTEN WELL!" a sonorous voice booms out, in attempted hollowness.
 "Know ye that passage back through here is difficult for some,

 Initial Lobby
 The lobby of the mansion's initial floor - the one above the ground
 floor - is an ordinary and fairly well-maintained room. There are some
 things scrawled on the ground here, in the contractor's handwriting:
 '1 object' is written to the n, while toward the other three exits on
 this floor '2' is scrawled. The stairway that runs d to the foyer
 turns and continues u, to the next floor. The constrained passages to
 the s, e, w, and n look as if they might spell trouble. Or perhaps
 they simply spell 'SEWN.'

 This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper

 seems to have already taken out a wall. A living room is e. On the s

 The sofa isn't going through any of those constrained passages, except

 It can't be shoved down the stairs, either. Perhaps there's some way

 Library
 Built-in shelves, now bare, line this room. All are of pitted wood,
 fixed in place, with subtle grain running horizontally. The bare
 shelves still sag a bit, a reminder that they long bore a heavy load
 of books.

 Your object-sensitive eyes notice: ... copybook... abecedarian book...
 dust casing... wee writ.

>examine dust casing
 This dust jacket's most obvious feature is a large lowercase "e" with
 a red "no" slash-in-a-circle around it. It came off of the novel "A
 Void," which is Gilbert Adair's Translation of "La Disparition." The
 original French novel is apparently by George Perec, and was written
 entirely without recourse to a certain frequently-used letter. The
 English translation is similarly constrained. From the way the dust
 jacket is folded, it seems like "A Void" - wherever that absent book
 may be - is a sizable volume.

 From the looks of the dust casing, these used to be a large bug
 sitting upon it, which has been completely smashed. Completely. Don't
 even bother referring to the bug at this point. It's not there. It's
 gone.

>pick up dust casing
 Success! Taken.

 A distracted figure with a huge bushy beard blunders in. The man wears
 loose clothing and has a cell phone up against his head. He takes the
 cell phone from his ear and stares at it, muttering, "Hold on? Me old
 silly put silly old me on hold!"

 He blunders out, using motions that seem to be exactly the reverse of
 the ones he made when entering. By the time you've recovered from the
 shock, you realize he has completely disappeared.

>examine writ
 This is a wee piece of paper, with the title "Top Row Retort." The
 author's name doesn't seem to be completely printed beneath that
 title, but something that looks like "-i-- -o-t-ort" does appear
 there. A busted U.S. keyboard appears on the cover. Most of the
 letters have been removed from this, leaving only 'QWERTYUIOP.'

 Antepenultimate Lobby
 This lobby, allowing access to the rooms of the next-to-next-to-top
 floor, is in good shape. It is very similar to the lobby below,
 although the ceiling may be a bit lower. Here there are only three
 passages. Two of them (to the n and e) are normal passages, but one,
 to the s, is oddly constrained. It has an ominous sign above it. The
 main stairway leads d, while another staircase, straight and narrow,
 allows passage u to the next floor.

 Initial Lobby
 The lobby of the mansion's initial floor - the one above the ground
 floor - is an ordinary and fairly well-maintained room. There are some
 things scrawled on the ground here, in the contractor's handwriting:
 '1 object' is written to the n, while toward the other three exits on
 this floor '2' is scrawled. The stairway that runs d to the foyer
 turns and continues u, to the next floor. The constrained passages to
 the n, e, w, and s look as if they might spell trouble. Or perhaps
 they simply spell 'NEWS.'

 Your object-sensitive eyes notice: ... sizable sofa.

>go down

 Foyer
 This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper
 is peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and
 there. There is a stairway, stable enough to ascend. The big area to
 the w must have once been a separate room, but the demolition crew
 seems to have already taken out a wall. A living room is e. On the s
 side is the front door. A Dumpster has been dumped here.

 A door to the n, leading out back, is open.

 A pig sits here calmly. He is quiet and oddly attired.

 Initial Lobby
 The lobby of the mansion's initial floor - the one above the ground
 floor - is an ordinary and fairly well-maintained room. There are some
 things scrawled on the ground here, in the contractor's handwriting:
 '1 object' is written to the north, while toward the other three exits
 on this floor '2' is scrawled. The stairway that runs down to the
 foyer turns and continues up, to the next floor. The constrained
 passages to the north, east, west, and south look as if they might
 spell trouble. Or perhaps they simply spell 'NEWS.'

 Your object-sensitive eyes notice: ... sizable sofa.

>push button
 As you press the button, the sofa is transformed into a couch.

 Well, it might have been a divan, but the transformation is still
 pretty impressive.

>examine divan
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine couch
 The couch is about the size that the sofa was. It looks about as
 comfy, too.

>push button
 As you press the button, the couch grows slightly in size - to your
 consternation - and is transformed into a daybed.

>examine daybed
 The daybed is actually larger than the sofa and couch were, although
 it looks a bit more comfortable. That's slight consolation, since it's
 going to be even harder to get it down the stairs now.

>push button
 As you press the button, the daybed shifts slightly, becoming a
 sofabed.

 Damn. You were hoping for an ottoman.

>push button
 As you press the button, the sofabed shrinks into a loveseat, which
 you welcome with a smile.

>examine loveseat
 Wonderfully, this loveseat is fairly small, although it looks pretty
 tacky - it's a sort of pale green with white flowers. But so what? You
 might manage to pick it up and get it down the stairs and into the
 Dumpster.

>get loveseat
 It's not going to be easy to lift this, even though it's much smaller
 now. Here's what we can try: lifting the loveseat, quickly proceeding
 down the stairs with it, and setting it down directly into the
 Dumpster. Sound good?
>yes

 All right, here we go...

 "LISTEN WELL!" a sonorous voice booms out, in attempted hollowness.
 "Know ye that passage back through here is difficult for some,
 impossible for others! Should you wish to transport yourself - without
 your cherished possessions - out of these constrained confines, have
 your controlling consciouness type the magic command: APPROACH THE
 APPROACH!"

 Twin Bedroom
 This is a reasonably-sized bedroom, laid out symmetrically. On the
 room's centerline is a scan of two photographs, framed and affixed to
 the wall. A double doorway, now bereft of doors but clearly marked
 "EXIT," leads out, to the e.

 Fortunately, someone's already cleared out the twin beds.

 (The mansion, incidentally, like many adventure game houses, seems
 rather inadequately supplied with bathrooms. Perhaps there are certain
 adventurer functions that are better elided, though.)

 The photo on the left side of the scan is of a famous cello player: Yo

 turns and continues u, to the next floor. The constrained passages to
 the n, e, w, and s look as if they might spell trouble. Or perhaps
 they simply spell 'NEWS.'

>go up

 Antepenultimate Lobby
 This lobby, allowing access to the rooms of the next-to-next-to-top
 floor, is in good shape. It is very similar to the lobby below,
 although the ceiling may be a bit lower. Here there are only three
 passages. Two of them (to the n and e) are normal passages, but one,
 to the s, is oddly constrained. It has an ominous sign above it. The
 main stairway leads d, while another staircase, straight and narrow,
 allows passage u to the next floor.

>go up

 Penultimate Lobby
 At this level the house is neither as broad or as long as it is on the
 ground floor. There seems to only be one other room on this floor,
 through a constrained double doorway to the w. One thin, unpainted
 stairway leads u into darkness from here. Another one, almost as
 narrow, leads d.

 Your object-sensitive eyes notice: ... verbosifier.

>go up

 Ultimate Level
 This is the mansion's top floor. The whole level, barely illuminated
 in the pale, milky glow of the toy dinosaur, is one large room. It
 seems partially finished, like an attic. Fiberglass insulation bulges
 between bare boards. There are no windows. A stairway leads d.

 Your object-sensitive eyes notice: ... manual.

 [+5.]

>examine insulation
 The insulation is pink, sort of fuzzy, and with a strange sort of
 medical or metallic glitter. An outfit made of this material might
 serve as fetishwear for a Sesame Street character.

>get insulation
 You lose your grip on the insulation as you attempt to pull out a bit.
 It doesn't look like it can be taken, in this case.

>get manual
 Taken.

>examine manual
 This slim pamphlet is a manual for the "Model 220 Verbosifier."

>read manual
 Alongside some diagrams of the very simple verbosifier device, which
 seem rather unnecessary, there is this text: "The Model 220
 Verbosifier is calibrated to work on a wide variety of furniture.
 Standing in the same room with the furniture that requires
 verbosification should suffice, as the fixed antenna provides a range
 of about twenty feet to either side. To verbosify nearby furniture,
 simply press the button.

 Only the usual sort of maintenance for consumer electronic devices
 should be required, if the device does not have a large enough store
 of energy to continue functioning. Instructions for such maintenance
 are completely transcribed below, albeit with different punctuation."

 There is indeed a short line of text below, but it looks rather odd:
 "Not tub'll up. A: All economy, U. B: ..."

>pull botton
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull button
 The button slides out with some effort on your part  - a spring seems
 to be holding it in. The cylinder revealed by this operation is the
 verbosifier's battery compartment. The single AA cell inside falls out
 onto the floor. You release the button, letting the compartment close
 again.

>get aa

 It's a shiny PowerTreat-brand AA cell.

>go down

 Initial Lobby
 The lobby of the mansion's initial floor - the one above the ground
 floor - is an ordinary and fairly well-maintained room. There are some
 things scrawled on the ground here, in the contractor's handwriting:
 '1 object' is written to the n, while toward the other three exits on
 this floor '2' is scrawled. The stairway that runs d to the foyer
 turns and continues u, to the next floor. The constrained passages to
 the s, e, w, and n look as if they might spell trouble. Or perhaps
 they simply spell 'SEWN.'

>go down

 Foyer
 This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper
 is peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and
 there. There is a stairway, stable enough to ascend. The big area to
 the w must have once been a separate room, but the demolition crew
 seems to have already taken out a wall. A living room is e. On the s
 side is the front door. A Dumpster has been dumped here.

 A door to the n, leading out back, is open.

>go north

 Wordplayground
 Here's a sort of small, enclosed backyard, closed in with a high
 wooden fence and completely covered with asphalt.

 A door to the s, leading inside, is open.

 There's one of those robotic puppies - the latest fad - here.

 The puppy quips: "Your momma got interested in Infocom games 'cause
 she thought there was one called 'Witless.'"

>give battery to dog
 Yips of pleasure sound as the robot puppy take the AA cell and chews
 on it playfully.

 The robot puppy rolls about happily, chewing on the AA cell.

>take puppy
 The robotic puppy is endowed with locomotive abilities that are as
 quick and random as its prepackaged wit. It scuttles away from you
 quickly.

 After a bit of effort, you wrest the AA cell from the puppy's robotic

 The robot puppy yips and bounds about near you without taunting you.

 The robot puppy yips gleefully and bounds in your direction at the

 THINGS
 by Sam Kabo Ashwell and Jacqueline Lott

 Mountainous Pretty Encompassing Thing
    All around you, mountainous unimplemented things rise up into the
 lofty heavenly unimplemented thing.  Beneath your pedal things, the
 well-worn linear pedestrian unimplemented thing descends into the
 lower geographically interstitial unimplemented thing.  Nestled among
 the rocky unimplemented things, a notably implemented rustic wooden
 structural sheltering thing awaits. It looks promisingly warm.

 I don't know the word "implement".

>examine sky
 I don't know the word "sky".

>examine unimplemented thing
 I don't know the word "unimplemented".

>in
 But the damn thing's locked.

>examine pedal
 I don't know the word "pedal".

>open thing
 Which thing do you mean, the locking / unlocking thing, the manual
 insulating things, the short vegetable thing, or yourself?

>locking
 I don't know how to open the locking / unlocking thing.

>examine structural thing
 Within this wooden structural sheltering thing you know there to be
 essential things, including soft horizontal things to sleep upon,
 warming things and (most importantly) potable alcoholic things.  Yet
 it is locked against you.

 Around its lower structural thing, interesting short vegetable things
 grow.

>turn verbose off ! ;)
 I don't understand the punctuation ")".

>inventory
 You have a locking / unlocking thing and manual insulating things.

>unlock thing with locking thing
 Which thing do you mean, the locking / unlocking thing, the manual
 insulating things, the rustic wooden structural sheltering thing, the
 short vegetable thing, or yourself?
>vegetable

 I don't know how to unlock the short vegetable thing.

>wear manual insulating things
 I don't know the word "things".

>inventory
 You have a locking / unlocking thing and manual insulating things.

>wear manual insulating thing
 Okay, you're now wearing the manual insulating things.

 well-worn linear pedestrian unimplemented thing descends into the
 lower geographically interstitial unimplemented thing.  Nestled among
 the rocky unimplemented things, a notably implemented rustic wooden
 structural sheltering thing awaits. It looks promisingly warm.

>unlock sheltering thing with unlocking thing
 Your manual things are so cold from the mountainous atmospheric thing
 that on attempting to unlock the wooden structural thing, you fumble
 the locking / unlocking thing and it falls to the flat underfoot
 things.

 A triumphant trilling auditory thing breaks the pristine absence of
 other auditory things, and a hoary sciuromorphic thing appears!  With
 shiny optical things of evil, it pounces upon your locking / unlocking
 thing and ingests it forthwith!

 Oh no!  Socially inappropriate verbal thing!  How ever will you, the
 bold adventurous protagonistic thing, retrieve your locking /
 unlocking thing?

>hit sciuromorphic thing with vegetable thing
 Attacking the hoary sciuromorphic thing doesn't appear productive.

>throw vegetable thing at sciuromorphic thing
 You can't throw the short vegetable thing.

>take vegetable thing
 You pluck a relatively small thing of the vegetable things.  You now
 have a plucked herbal thing!

>examine hoary
 A furry, cute yet dastardly sciuromorphic thing, which has lately
 swallowed your prized thing by which locked things are rendered
 unlocked (and vice versa).  It is notably hoary.

>give vegatable thing to hoary thing
 I don't know the word "vegatable".

>give vegetable thing to hoary thing
 You're not carrying the short vegetable thing.

>inventory
 You have manual insulating things (being worn) and a plucked herbal
 thing.

>give herbal thing to hoary thing
 You seize the hoary sciuromorphic thing and force the herbal things
 into its oral thing!  You hold its struggling furry corporeal thing
 against your corporeal thing and stroke its tubular peristaltic thing
 until it swallows.  As you release it, it viciously bites your manual
 thing!  Ow!

 The hoary sciuromorphic thing trills nauseously.

>take all
 I don't see what you're referring to.

>examine hoary thing
 A furry, cute yet dastardly sciuromorphic thing, which has lately
 swallowed your prized thing by which locked things are rendered
 unlocked (and vice versa).  It is notably hoary.

 The hoary sciuromorphic thing looks a little queasy.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Eww!  The hoary sciuromorphic thing violently defecates!  Your locking
 / unlocking thing is returned, albeit somewhat icky!

>take unlocking thing
 You carefully retrieve the locking / unlocking thing, and thoughtfully
 wipe your manual insulating things on the hoary sciumorphic thing
 afterwards.

>unlock shelter thing with unlocking thing
 Once again you insert the locking / unlocking thing into the thing
 which was made to accept it, and carefully unlock it.  The flat wooden
 thing sealing the thing by which you may enter swings aside, its
 articulated metal things creaking!

>in
 An emotionally satisfying thing swells in your metaphysical personal
 thing as you stride through the thing for entering or exiting the
 rustic structural thing.  You light and stoke the heating thing, crack
 open a glass thing containing alcholic things, kick off your pedal
 insulating things, collapse onto the horizontal soft thing and rest.

 After a relaxing slumbrous thing, you awake refreshed and warm, and
 continue merrily on your ambulatory thing through the mountainous
 things.  Hooray, you win the interactive thing!
