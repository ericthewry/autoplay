 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You've decided to spend the weekend in the family country cabin. Well,
 you say family, but it actually belongs to one particular member of
 your family: your second cousin Rebecca. You haven't seen her for a
 while. Nobody has. She's been missing for over a year now, disappeared
 without a trace.

 The journal entry is for Oct. 25th, it doesn't say which year. It says:
 "I have assembled the metopticon, following the instructions I read in
 the Grimoire, and as per the instructions I am looking through the
 metopticon at the crystal city. I feel the tugging, and once or twice I
 almost imagined myself going, but I cannot seem to leave this mortal
 shell. In the accursed cryptic writings of N.G. it says, "you must be
 the bard, the warrior, the mage, not all but only one at a time". But
 how?!"

>examine crystal
 It is a crystal, the size of your fist. The peculiar crystal formations
 form little cubes and lines that almost look architectural. You know,
 it looks a bit like a city.

>examine bookshelves
 Lines of bookshelves, stacked with old strange books.
 (Here's how to get a book from the bookshelf if you know the name: type
 "fetch Bible")

 but you can't find it.
>fetch N.G.
 You look for n.g. in the bookshelf but you can't find it.
>fetch grimoire
 After searching almost all the books, you find it! The Grimoire!

>read grimoire
 This dusty old leatherbound tome bears an inscription on the back that
 says "Grimoire. Von Katz. The book has a ribbon bound into its spine,
 to be used as a bookmark. As you open the book, it opens at the page
 where the bookmark is. That page seems to contain a schematic woodcut
 drawing of a device. Above the drawing is a heading that reads
 "metopticon". The rest of the text is in latin, so you can't really
 read it, but you could probably manage to assemble the device from that
 drawing, if only you had the parts: a sort of tube, two triangular
 blocks and a sphere.
 You have learned how to assemble the metopticon. Whatever it is.

 terrace
 You are on a large terrace, paved with stones and ending with an ornate
 balustrade. From here you have a splendid view. To one side you see the
 city, so filled with towers and peaked roofs that it might look like a
 Disney fantasy, unless you know, without a doubt, that this is the real
 thing, this is a real magical city where anything can happen. To the
 other side you look out over the wild, endless plains and forest
 stretching all the way to the distant mountains.
 A winding path leads down from here.

 You can see a magic circle (empty) here.

>examine circle
 The magic circle is empty.

>examine me
 Look at you - an archer, with perhaps a drop of elven blood pumping
 through those slender limbs. But you are also David Claré, a software
 engineer from Kent. Very strange.

>go down

 city gate
 The city gate is a huge opening in the city walls. (Too large... what
 on Earth could possible warrant a gate that size? The answer comes to
 you as you think it: nothing. Nothing on Earth.) Inside the gates you
 see the city in all its glory, high peaked houses and smaller wooden
 houses with gambrel roofs. Outside - south of here - is the wild. A
 steep path leads up to the terrace.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

 Absolutely lovely, you'd love to stay and look at those amazing
 buildings... but for now, adventure awaits you south of the city.

>go south

 swamp
 A stinking, putrid, dark swamp, where mists roll between the dark
 trees. Back north is the city. The path turns west, deeper in among the
 trees, into a clearing where you can see some sort of wooden house.

 Lurking in the shadows, somebody - something! - is watching you.
 Lacking a proper classification scheme for these things, you decide to
 call it a troll.

>examine troll
 Heavens! What fiendish trickery of nature is this? (Hang on, when did
 you start thinking like that?). It really is an ugly monster, bipedal,
 most of the time, and hairy, with a foul head adorned with fangs,
 tusks, and horns.

>talk to troll
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>troll, hello
 There is no reply.

>shoot bow at troll
 I only understood you as far as wanting to shoot the archer's bow.

>shoot bow
 Shooting that would not accomplish much.

>go west

 hut
 This house looks ready to fall down. The wood is not painted, the roof

 will take you inside. The swamp is back east and a mountain is south of
 here.

 here, probably after dining on the original inhabitants.

 You open the leather pouch, revealing a scroll.

 The air is fresh here on the mountain, nicer than down in that swamp
 (the hut is north of here). The cave is up from here.

 inside the cave you see something shiny and glittering.

 You can see a dragon here.

 You see nothing special about the dragon.

>in
 You walk in a large circle around the dead body of the dragonsnake.

 You walk into the inner cave. There are all sorts of shiny objects
 (some of which are gold and silver, others just shiny stones) all over
 the floor. In a pile, still recovering from the shock of being released
 from the dragonsnake's magic hold, is a woman. At first you think of
 maidens and princesses, but then you realize you know her. Rebecca?

 almost imagined myself going, but I cannot seem to leave this mortal

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.

    "It was supposed to be a simple test run, right?  Yeah, right.  So
 the Chief decides, 'Hey, I'll test it,' right?  And he takes
 passengers.  Five passengers.  Investors!  And himself!  HIMSELF!
 There's laws about that!  And what happens?  Well, what do you expect?
 An hour away, his engines go crit, and he's shootin' towards this hunk
 o' rock you an' me call home.  Terra Firma.  So Firma it'll Terra him
 up, right?  I tell you what!  He's going to end up as a smudge of the
 man he used to be unless you can get that new-fangled safety net
 workin'!"  Transmission ends.  And that is how you, in your best rented
 tuxedo, ended up under the high-power, experimental,
 not-completely-legal safety net, trying to fix it before your boss's
 boss makes a pool of himself.

 Junk room
 The junk room is full of all sorts of odds and ends that no one could
 bring themselves to throw away.  All sorts of things litter the shelves
 and the floor.  The way you came in, an auto-locking door, has
 auto-locked, and won't unlock until morning.  The only other exit leads
 out into the viewing room.

 You see a crystal ball and an optical prism here.  Scattered across the
 bottom shelves, among the junk, are a magnifying glass, a water pistol,
 a bismuth crystal, a jar, a leather arm guard, and an optical prism.
 The jar contains silica beads.  Just visible from the top shelf are a
 lump of labradorite and a bow and arrow charm.

>examine me

 a ladder comes crashing onto the floor!  It must have been stuck behind
 all that junk.

 optical prism: Taken.

 lump of labradorite: The lump of labradorite is too far away.

 bow and arrow charm: The bow and arrow charm is too far away.

>examine ball
 The large globe appears to be made of glass, and is quite solid.

 Try as you might, you can't find a good angle to get the ladder through

 The safety net was designed as an inertial dampner of some sort; no one

 tiny hole.  Farther along the wall, a small shelf is illuminated.

 mentioning that the only really important wires were the power wires.
 There's a note, stuck to the panel.

>shoot pistol at panel
 You squirt the panel.  The water shorts out the panel!  Electricity
 crackles across junctions, and smoke drifts out of the opening,
 vanishing into the air.  After a spectacular lightshow, a distant
 "thump" indicates the generators have started.  The lights keep
 flickering, though, from shorting out in the puddle of water at the
 base of the panel.

 This... this is it!  Everything is ready!  You take a deep breath,
 steady your hand, and press the button.  Even as your finger stabs
 down, a voice yells, "Wait!  Don't push-" - but it's too late.  The
 button blinks twice, then goes dark.  Above you, the roar of
 overburdened engines grows nearer; with a tremendous crash, the
 Dragonfly lands, unharmed, in the middle of the safety net!  It worked!
 You're a hero!

 ...Or not.  You boss starts shaking you like a rag doll, yelling, "You
 idiot!  You moron!  Are you TRYING to kill us all?!  What kind of crazy
 stunt was that!"  You manage to break free, but he's not done yelling
 yet.  "I told you to fix the safety net, not the room lights!  All you
 had to do was turn on the switch in the junk room!  Just one little
 switch!"  He stops to mop his forehead, just as HIS boss enteres the
 room, leading his five guests.  "Great work today, men!  That was a
 brilliant recovery!"  Grinning, he begins pumping your hand.  "Why, if
 that light on the console hadn't started flashing, I never would have
 found the brakes!"  The rest of the evening passes in a blur.  You're a
 hero, at least according to your bonus check - and that's really all
 that matters.  More than enough to but a new top hat, at any rate.  Oh,
 but thinking of which... you really should have called and cancelled
 that date, huh.

 Safety net
 The safety net was designed as an inertial dampner of some sort; no one
 really knows how it works.  Even the inventor seems a bit in the dark,
 and he's the only one that can make it work!  The glass door leads back
 into the viewing room.  The magnifying glass focusses the beam of light
 through a small hole in the wall.  Farther along the wall, the beam
 passes through the prism; the resulting rainbow falls across a small
 hole, where only yellow light makes it through.  The light glows inside
 the open panel.

 In the viewing room, you see an energy device (which contains a
 button).  The hopper contains a bowtie and a top hat.

 button blinks twice, then goes dark.  Above you, the roar of
 overburdened engines grows nearer; with a tremendous crash, the
 Dragonfly lands, unharmed, in the middle of the safety net!  It worked!
 You're a hero!

 ...Or not.  You boss starts shaking you like a rag doll, yelling, "You
 idiot!  You moron!  Are you TRYING to kill us all?!  What kind of crazy
 stunt was that!"  You manage to break free, but he's not done yelling
 yet.  "I told you to fix the safety net, not the room lights!  All you
 had to do was turn on the switch in the junk room!  Just one little
 switch!"  He stops to mop his forehead, just as HIS boss enteres the
 room, leading his five guests.  "Great work today, men!  That was a
 brilliant recovery!"  Grinning, he begins pumping your hand.  "Why, if
 that light on the console hadn't started flashing, I never would have
 found the brakes!"  The rest of the evening passes in a blur.  You're a
 hero, at least according to your bonus check - and that's really all
 that matters.  More than enough to but a new top hat, at any rate.  Oh,
 but thinking of which... you really should have called and cancelled
 that date, huh.

 You're in a right proper mess now. That blasted dragonfly has gone and
 disappeared, and what's more, you're down to your last farthing.

 Dragon Flies Like Labradorite
 A Speed IF by Troy Jones III
 Release 1 / Serial number 111126 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Village Square
 The late-autumn sun struggles to warm the sleepy village of Skry Im.
 For as long as most of its residents remember, the village has been
 little more than a collection of ramshackle cottages and shops at the
 crossroads of the King's Highway and the Way of the Sea. One such
 ramshackle shop can be found to the northeast: Merchant Guy's Specialty
 Minerals and Archery Supplies. Also there's a ramshackle inn to the
 southwest.

 It's harvest season: most of the villagers are out toiling in the
 nearby farm fields.

>examine me
 You look a right proper adventurist in your top hat, bowtie, and
 greatcoat (even if the coat is a mite threadbare), but you feel rather
 like one who's sorely missing his dragonfly.

>examine coat
 Your dark grey greatcoat has been with you through many a difficult
 campaign, and it shows.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your last farthing
   your top hat (being worn)
   your bowtie (being worn)
   your double-brested greatcoat (being worn)

>examine last farthing
 Not the first time you've been down to your last farthing, and likely
 it won't be the last.

>examine fields
 Farmsteads cluster round the village, especially to the northwest and
 southeast.

>go northeast

 Merchant Guy's Specialty Minerals and Archery Supplies
 This store has a peculiar array of items for sale, although the shelves
 are largely empty now. Hard times all round, you suppose.
 Curious-looking rocks and crystals can be had at various prices, and
 there are a few pieces of basic archer's equipment for sale as well. A
 sign notes that the archery equipment is on clearance.

 The proprietor-- the eponymous Merchant Guy, you presume-- sits behind
 the counter, eyeing you with thinly-veiled suspicion.

 On the counter are a polished piece of labradorite, a small crystal
 ball and a bismuth crystal.

 On the shelves are a glass prism, a calcite prism, a magnifying glass
 lens and a jar of silica.

 Beside the counter is a basket for archery supplies. Inside it you see
 a short arrow, an archer's arm-guard and a bow.

>ask guy about dragonfly
 "My good man, I don't suppose you've seen a lost dragonfly of late?
 I... seem to have mislaid my special dragonfly. She answers to the name
 of Emma."

 "Ain't no dragonflies round 'ere," says the proprietor.

 He regards you mistrustfully.

>ask guy about bow
 You have a look in the basket. It doesn't look too promising. "Archery
 equipment on clearance, you say? How much for the bow?"

 "One farthing. Firm. And I don't want no 'agglin neither from the likes
 of you," he clarifies.

>ask guy about lens
 Studying the contents of the shelves, your eye falls upon a magnifying
 glass lens. You take it and hold it up to the light, examining it
 carefully. "How much for the magnifying glass lens?" you enquire.

 The proprietor quotes a figure considerably above one farthing. You
 replace the magnifying glass lens on the shelf.

 He glowers at you suspiciously.

>examine guy
 He has a handlebar moustache and a curmudgeonly mien.

 He eyes you with hostility.

>ask about labradorite
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask guy about labradorite
 You take a closer look at the polished piece of labradorite, picking it
 up off the counter and turning it this way and that as you examine it.
 "How much for this?" you enquire.

 The proprietor quotes a figure. Needless to say, it's more than one
 farthing. You replace the polished piece of labradorite on the counter.

 He regards you balefully.

>ask guy about glass prism
 Studying the contents of the shelves, your eye falls upon a glass
 prism. You take it and hold it up to the light, examining it carefully.
 "How much for the glass prism?" you enquire.

 The proprietor quotes a figure considerably above one farthing. You
 replace the glass prism on the shelf.

 He watches you angrily.

>smile at man
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sing
 You sing a few bars of Yarel's Lament. Emma doesn't seem to fancy your
 singing voice, but she's not here to complain, is she?

 He eyes you hatefully.

>dance
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>xyzzy
 To tell the truth, an incantation or two would come in right handy
 about now. Alas, it is your sister, not you, who is schooled in the
 Uncanny Arts.

 He scowls at you mistrustfully.

>out

 Village Square
 You're in Skry Im, a collection of ramshackle cottages and shops at the
 crossroads of the King's Highway and the Way of the Sea. One such
 ramshackle shop can be found to the northeast: Merchant Guy's Specialty
 Minerals and Archery Supplies. Also there's a ramshackle inn to the
 southwest.

>go southwest
 The cleverly-named Skry Inn is closed at present. What little business
 it does, it typically does after sundown. Presumably the proprietors
 clean up the place or sleep during daylight hours-- although based on
 what you saw of the establishment last night, likely they do more of
 the latter than the former. You're pretty sure your dragonfly isn't to
 be found in there anyway.

>go northwest
 Just farmland that way and not really any roads or points of interest
 to speak of. It seems an unlikely direction for your dragonfly to have
 gone.

>se
 Southeast is some nondescript farmland and beyond that the Fae Forest.
 Surely Emma would not have gone that way.

>go north
 Emma always did dislike the cold-- so much the more so since becoming a
 dragonfly. You find it unlikely she would have headed towards the
 frigid North Countries. The Midlands are quite cold enough in the fall,
 she has said many times.

>go south
 You consider the possibility that your dragonfly set off along the Way
 of the Sea to points south. She has mentioned wanting to see the swamps
 and jungles of the Darklands before, but it isn't like her to just run
 off in the middle of the night.

>go east
 Back east toward the mountains is the way you came from. It is possible
 she backtracked, but you can't think why.

>go west
 Of all the directions Emma could have gone, west to the sea seems the
 most likely, relatively speaking. But there's little reason for her to
 simply leave you behind-- it's not as if a dragonfly can hire a ship.
 And in any case, you aren't about to go gallivanting off that way
 without a firm lead.

>examine hat
 It's seen better days, but nonetheless it keeps your head warm.

>remove hat
 You see little need to get undressed now, cold as it is. And that's to
 say nothing of polite society's rules of decorum.

>go northeast

 He says, "See 'ere now-- I don't care to say nothin' 'bout that. So's
 either BUY somethin' or get out me shop if ye please. I amn't in the
 mood for entertainin' drifters."

>examine arrow
 The toy arrow reminds you of that old riddle:

 time flies like an arrow
   fruit flies like a banana
     dragon flies like... what?

 The answer: labradorite! You're given to understand that the punchline
 makes more sense if one speaks Old Low Dwarvish.

>examine guard
 For the archer who dislikes the snap of the bowstring scraping the skin
 off his forearm. It's little more than a thin cloth rag and some
 drawstrings, however. For the archer on a budget.

 He watches you balefully.

>examine bow
 A child-sized bow-- a toy, in fact. Were you to actually use it in an
 engagement, your only chance would be that your foe die of laughter.

>ask guy about arrow
 You have a look in the basket. It doesn't look too promising. "Archery
 equipment on clearance, you say? How much for the short arrow?"

 "One farthing. Firm. And I don't want no 'agglin neither from the likes
 of you," he clarifies.

 He glares at you hatefully.

>haggle
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 It shimmers blue and green in the light, like a dragonfly.

 He watches you balefully.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   your last farthing
   your top hat (being worn)
   your bowtie (being worn)
   your double-brested greatcoat (being worn)

 He glowers at you angrily.

>sell bowtie
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>steal labradorite
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take labradorite
 Merchant Guy watches you like a hawk. A very suspicious hawk. It's
 quite unlikely you'd be able to get away with pilfering the polished
 piece of labradorite-- at least not while he can see you.

>steel labradorite
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask man about labradorite
 You take a closer look at the polished piece of labradorite, picking it
 up off the counter and turning it this way and that as you examine it.
 "How much for this?" you enquire.

 The proprietor quotes a figure. Needless to say, it's more than one
 farthing. You replace the polished piece of labradorite on the counter.

>offer bowtie to man
 You see little enough sense in doing anything like that to your bowtie.

 He eyes you suspiciously.

>sell bowtie to man
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>buy arrow
 You cast a critical eye on the items in the clearance basket, examining
 each from several angles, tsk-tsking and tut-tutting with slightly
 exaggerated disapproval. "You have only the one arrow?" you ask after a
 few moments.

 "Toy bow don't need but one," the proprietor responds. "One farthing
 for each piece in the basket. Or two for the lot," he adds.

 "A farthing for one arrow?" you ask incredulously. You pick the arrow
 from the basket and hold it up to your eye, looking carefully down the
 length of it. "And the arrow is out of true anyway. Not worth much of
 anything, is it?"

 The proprietor takes the arrow out of your hand and puts it back in the
 basket. "Don't make much difference to a kid, y'ask me. Two farthings
 for the lot," he repeats.

 "One. For the lot." You meet the proprietor's hostile gaze with
 equanimity. For one tense moment, it's a stand-off. Then, wordlessly
 and reluctantly, he holds out his hand. You pay him your one farthing,
 taking care not to move too quickly, and casually pick up the whole
 basket.

 "And I shall save you the trouble of throwing out this worthless basket
 as well." For a moment, the merchant looks as though he's about to
 object, but he just glares at you murderously instead. "Pleasure doing
 business, my good man," you say cheerfully.

 He scowls at you balefully.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine basket
 A worn-out basket made of dried rushes. It looks to be on the verge
 falling apart, but it is usefully opaque nonetheless.

 In the basket are a short arrow, an archer's arm-guard and a bow.

>buy arrow
 You cast a critical eye on the items in the clearance basket, examining
 each from several angles, tsk-tsking and tut-tutting with slightly
 exaggerated disapproval. "You have only the one arrow?" you ask after a
 few moments.

 "Toy bow don't need but one," the proprietor responds. "One farthing
 for each piece in the basket. Or two for the lot," he adds.

 "A farthing for one arrow?" you ask incredulously. You pick the arrow
 from the basket and hold it up to your eye, looking carefully down the
 length of it. "And the arrow is out of true anyway. Not worth much of
 anything, is it?"

 The proprietor takes the arrow out of your hand and puts it back in the
 basket. "Don't make much difference to a kid, y'ask me. Two farthings
 for the lot," he repeats.

 "One. For the lot." You meet the proprietor's hostile gaze with
 equanimity. For one tense moment, it's a stand-off. Then, wordlessly
 and reluctantly, he holds out his hand. You pay him your one farthing,
 taking care not to move too quickly, and casually pick up the whole
 basket.

 "And I shall save you the trouble of throwing out this worthless basket
 as well." For a moment, the merchant looks as though he's about to
 object, but he just glares at you murderously instead. "Pleasure doing
 business, my good man," you say cheerfully.

>put basket on man
 Not while there's something still in it.

 He glares at you angrily.

>take all from basket
 short arrow: Prehended.
 archer's arm-guard: Acquired.
 bow: Commandeered.

>put basket on man
 You upend the basket and put it over Mr Guy's head-- a trick you saw
 once. You do so hate to have to engage in such chicanery, but desperate
 times call for desperate measures.

 Removed.

 Village Square
 You're in Skry Im, a collection of ramshackle cottages and shops at the
 crossroads of the King's Highway and the Way of the Sea. One such
 ramshackle shop can be found to the northeast: Merchant Guy's Specialty
 Minerals and Archery Supplies. Also there's a ramshackle inn to the
 southwest.

>go south
 You consider the possibility that your dragonfly set off along the Way
 of the Sea to points south. She has mentioned wanting to see the swamps
 and jungles of the Darklands before, but it isn't like her to just run
 off in the middle of the night.

>go southwest
 The cleverly-named Skry Inn is closed at present. What little business
 it does, it typically does after sundown. Presumably the proprietors
 clean up the place or sleep during daylight hours-- although based on
 what you saw of the establishment last night, likely they do more of
 the latter than the former. You're pretty sure your dragonfly isn't to
 be found in there anyway.

>go west
 Of all the directions Emma could have gone, west to the sea seems the
 most likely, relatively speaking. But there's little reason for her to
 simply leave you behind-- it's not as if a dragonfly can hire a ship.
 And in any case, you aren't about to go gallivanting off that way
 without a firm lead.

>examine labradorite
 It shimmers blue and green in the light, like a dragonfly.

>throw labradorite in air
 You can't see any such thing.

>wave labradorite
 There would probably be talk if you were seen doing any such thing to a
 polished piece of labradorite.

>rub labradorite
 You suddenly realize that you don't really need to do that to the
 polished piece of labradorite. Most likely.

>shoot bow
 This bow is so flimsy it would likely break if you tried to shoot it in
 earnest. Frankly, you'd be better off throwing the arrow at your
 target.

>think about dragonfly
 I only understood you as far as wanting to think.

>find dragonfly
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>throw arrow
 Better not drop that. It might come in handy later.

>drop all
 jar of silica: Dropped.

>undo
 Village Square
 [Previous turn undone.]

>look through lens
 Thoroughly searching the square with the magnifying glass, you discover
 some dragonfly tracks! How fortunate for you that Emma's left wing is
 still recovering from that bit of unpleasantness with the goblin
 fanatics, rendering her earthbound for the time being. Evidently she
 went southeast.

>se
 You carefully follow the tiny dragonfly tracks southeastwards through
 the farmland and into the dark forest. Why on earth would she...? But
 no matter; you enter the forest. The gnarled, twisted trees of this
 place resent your intrusion and seek to impede you at every turn.
 Nonetheless you press on as any proper adventurist would...

 Deep Within Fae Forest
 Your dragonfly's trail has led you here, to the gloomy underbrush of
 this centuries-old forest. Apparently she continued south from here.

 Unfortunately, a swarm of venemous time flies impedes further progress.

>examine flies
 The flies swarm menacingly to the south of your position, preventing
 you from following the dragonfly tracks any farther. The undergrowth is
 too thick and the light thorugh the forest canopy too dim to try to go
 round and find the trail again further along-- it is difficult enough
 following these tracks directly what with all the dead leaves still
 covering the forest floor.

>show arrow to flies
 You can only do that to something animate.

>open jar
 It is sealed very, very tight. You don't seem to be able to get it
 open.

>swat flies
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>give arrow to flies
 You can only do that to something animate.

>wave arrow
 You look ridiculous waving the short arrow.

>throw arrow at flies
 Foregoing the use of the useless bow, you hurl the arrow into the midst
 of the time flies. As one, they descend onto the arrow and begin to
 devour it. At least... you think they are devouring it. In any event,
 the swarm now covers the arrow, leaving your path clear to the south.

>search leaves
 You can't see any such thing.

>go south
 You press on boldy southwards, carefully following the trail with the
 help of the magnifying glass. Surely it can't be that much farther--
 how far can an earthbound dragonfly get in less than a day's time?

 Clearing
 You suddenly emarge from the trees into a broad clearing. In the midst
 of it is some manner of infernal altar made from one solid piece of
 polished obsidian.

 On the infernal obsidian altar is Emma.

 As you might've known all along, the diabolical Doctor Magnusson is
 here as well, up to no good as usual. "Charlie, my dear lovely boy!" he
 exclaims upon seeing you. "Your sister and I were beginning to fear you
 wouldn't make it!"

>appreciate obsidian
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine emma
 She's rather on the petite side, and has pearlescent wings and a
 shimmery blue-green carapace like polished labradorite-- she's been
 thus ever since that unfortunate mishap long ago. She's presently
 unconscious and tied to an obsidian altar. A tiny smoking censer
 dangles above her.

>examine doctor
 He sports a bowler, a purple cravat, a black velvet waistcoat, and a
 van dyke beard. You also notice that he wields a wavy-bladed sacrifical
 dagger.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a jar of silica
   a magnifying glass lens
   a calcite prism
   a glass prism
   a bismuth crystal
   a small crystal ball
   a polished piece of labradorite
   a bow
   an archer's arm-guard
   your top hat (being worn)
   your bowtie (being worn)
   your double-brested greatcoat (being worn)

>examine censer
 A tiny smoking censer hangs from a little stand on the altar. You
 surmise that the incense fumes from the censer are keeping Emma
 unconscious.

 You decide you've seen quite enough. "Doctor Magnusson... It seems,"
 you choke out, mostly keeping your composure, "you've set upon my
 sister without cause. I fear I'm obliged to demand satisfaction, sir."

 Magnusson sighs. "Must it come to this?" He meets your gaze for a
 moment. "Yes I suppose it must, mustn't it? Very well then, I've no
 pistols, so it's swords or nothing."

 "Swords it is then."

 "You've a blade...?" he asks.

 You shake your head. "Sadly, we had a bit of a set-to with some
 ruffians in the mountains--" you start to explain, but Magnusson waves
 off this trifle and starts to root about for a pair of swords suitable
 for dueling. He discovers some on the ground behind the altar, and
 stoops to pick them up. As he stands, he bumps the incense-burning
 censer, knocking it off the altar-- apparently without noticing. He
 approaches and extends the swords to you, hilts first. They are a pair
 of dueling sabres, one with a brass hilt, one bronze, but otherwise
 seemingly identical.

 "Choose your weapon, my dear Charlie, and we shall get this sorted."

>examine brass
 It looks just like the other, aside from the hilt.

>examine bronze
 It looks just like the other, aside from the hilt.

>examine hilt
 You can't see any such thing.

>look through lens
 No need for that-- you've found her. Now to effect her rescue!

>examine censer
 It's fallen from its place on the altar and now lies upon the ground.
 Magnusson evidently did not note its fall.

>SAVE
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>take censer
 The tiny smoking censer is too far away.

>give labradorite to emma
 She appears to be unconscious.

>take emma
 I don't suppose Emma would care for that.

>throw labradorite in censor
 You can't see any such thing.

>throw labradorite in censer
 The polished piece of labradorite isn't bothering you, so you shouldn't
 bother it, I'd say.

>look in crystal ball
 Looking through it causes images to be weirdly distorted.

>take bronze
 You choose the bronze-hilted sabre and step back, falling to a fencer's
 stance. Magnusson raises his blade as well.

 "Defend yourself!" he cries, and lunges toward you. The clash of steel
 rings out like a bell across the clearing, putting a nearby flock of
 birds to the wing...


 Please press SPACE to continue.








 You gradually come round, wakening to the sound of steel on steel. A...
 a swordfight? What's going on?

 Charlie leaps forward, shouting and swinging wildly up high. Magnusson
 narrowly avoids the blow, and responds with a risky attack against his
 foe.

>examine me
 Still a dragonfly, alas.

 Magnusson swings toward his opponent's legs. Charlie leaps back,
 dodging the attempt, and offers up a textbook riposte, shouting
 exultantly.

>go down
 Being bound to an altar rather constricts your freedom to do much of
 anything.

 Charlie lunges forward, blade aimed toward his opponent's midsection.
 Magnusson deflects the assault, and returns an unexpected counterattack
 of masterful precision.

>yell
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 You aren't carrying anything of course, being a dragonfly. But as it
 happens, you have one readied spell: BURN.

 Magnusson thrusts toward his opponent's legs. Charlie steps aside,
 avoiding the attack, and returns a standard reprise, shouting
 exultantly.

>burn
 What do you want to burn?

>burn doctor
 Charlie will doubtless be put out by this, with his peculiar code of
 honor, but nevertheless... You call forth a spirit of burning against
 Doctor Magnusson. In your weakened state you're not capable of
 engulfing him in a pillar of flames, but you are able to burn his hand
 sufficiently hard that he's forced to let go his weapon.

 Charlie kicks away the dropped sword and presses the point of his own
 blade to Magnusson's adam's apple. "Yield, cur!" he calls dramatically,
 a bit winded by the sound of it.

 "I yield," Magnusson concedes. "And your sister is now awake, it would
 seem," he adds, not without bitterness.

 "Indeed." Charlie thinks for a moment, then twitches his sword to the
 side. "Begone. And pray we never cross paths again, Magnusson."
 Magnusson stands and flees into the woods without a word or a glance
 behind.

>untie dragonfly
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take dragonfly
 You are still securely bound. One should hope that your brother would
 release you after going to all this trouble to find you.

>examine charlie
 Charlie grins back at you and doffs his hat in a mock-formal bow.

>burn rope
 You can't see any such thing.

>charlie, release emma
 (Freeform conversation is not implemented in this game. To communicate,
 ask Charlie about something.)

>ask charlie about rescue
 "Might I trouble you to help me off this altar?" you ask.

 "Oh! Of course-- forgive me." At a single stroke, Charlie cuts your
 bonds with his newly-liberated bronze-hilted sabre, newly liberating
 you as well. "Are you all right?"

 "I will be," you reply. "I need to rest before I can send us, however."

 "Very well." Charlie reaches into his pocket and withdraws a piece of
 polished labradorite!

 "And just where did you steal that, if may I ask?" you ask, trying not
 to sound too delighted.

 He laughs. "Best not to enquire too closely."

>examine labradorite
 ...And after a few hours of rest, you let Charlie know that you're
 ready to go. He picks you up gently with one finger.

 "Xyzzy!" you call. You both disappear in a puff of orange smoke.

 intermediate to calcic member of the plagioclase series. It is usually
 defined as having "%An" (anorthite) between 50 and 70. The specific
 gravity ranges from 2.68 to 2.72. The streak is white, like most
 silicates. The refractive index ranges from 1.559 to 1.573. Twinning is
 common. As with all plagioclase members the crystal system is triclinic
 and three directions of cleavage are present two of which form nearly
 right angle prisms. It occurs as clear, white to gray, blocky to lath
 shaped grains in common mafic igneous rocks such as basalt and gabbro,
 as well as in anorthosites.

 The Study
 You are in the western part of your study. Before the library, which

 At the window
 An ornate lead glass window is open to the garden. Through it you can
 see the cage which houses the thylacine. Beside the window stands
 another display case. Further to the east is your desk.

>examine window
 Right outside the window is a huge heap of kindling wood, part of your
 plan.

>examine thylacine
 This one you brought back from Tasmania, after it had howled for hours
 in one of your traps and you went out to shoot it. It has the body of a
 wolf and tiger stripes on its haunches.
 It looks as unhappy as it did the day you caught it, pacing back and
 forth powerlessly as if even that activity has become meaningless.
>examine cage

 It's a functional metal cage, its floor covered with hay. A single bar
 is all that keeps the thylacaine from escaping.

>examine display case
 This velvet houses a bismuth crystal. It was given to you by the
 grandson of Claude François Geoffroy, in recognition of your travels to
 Antarctica in the early 1860s.
 It was in early 1863,  6 months after you left, that Maura was  born.
 You only received the news on your return to Spitzbergen in 1865. And
 when you finally returned home, she was already toddling around the
 living room.

 At your desk
 This mahagoni desk was given to you by your parents on the day you
 received your doctorate. Many hours were spent here, hours probably
 better spent elsewhere. It has a single drawer.

 On the desk is a jar of silica.

 Mounted on the wall above the desk are the bow and arrow, given to you
 by the people of Melanesia.

 A small table stands to one side. On it is a flower pot and a squirt
 gun.

>examine squirt gun
 It's a small brass squirt gun. Once it was one of Mauras toys, now you
 use it to SPRAY the flower occasionally.
 It has gotten a more sinister use today. You've filled it with the
 poison of the Pseudonaja, one of Australias deadliest snakes. Once you
 sprayed yourself with it, you'll be dead within a hearbeat.

>take gun
 Taken.

>examine silica
 It is only half full.
 You were frantically working on your categorization of minerals at the
 time, to be ready for the composium the following month. Your wife had
 tried time and time again to raise your mind towards the state of
 Maura's health. You only visited her once in all those weeks, when she
 was already riddled beyond all earthly hope with that terrible disease.
 That was the last time you called her your dragonfly. A mildly mocking
 nickname from her unsteady childhood days. Dragonflies were a bad omen
 among your ancestors; Surely little Maura was for the valets and maids
 and the kitchenware. You dropped that jar when your butler informed you
 of her death, and when it rolled away across the carpet you began to
 realize how much had been rolling away from you fast, messily spilling
 its contents, all your days.

>about
 "The extraordinary events on the last day of Professor Mangleworth" was
 written for the 2011 Thanksgiving speed-IF. The premise was as follows:

 A speed-IF! A veritable feast! Using the following inventory items,
 based on a list of photographed items from Grocible's book-in-progress:
 a top hat. a dragonfly*. a small crystal ball. two optical prisms. a
 water pistol. a magnifying glass. a bowtie. a jar of silica. a polished
 piece of labradorite. a bow and arrow. an archer's arm guard. a bismuth
 crystal.

 Scientific detail was provided by a quick google. Hence, there will be
 great inaccuracies that will make some people cry. No apologies are
 intended or offered.

>wear guard
 You put on the hand guard.

>spray arrow
 You can't see any such thing.

>spray bow
 You can only do that to something animate.

>go west

 At the window
 An ornate lead glass window is open to the garden. Through it you can
 see the cage which houses the thylacine. Beside the window stands
 another display case. Further to the east is your desk.

>examine window
 Right outside the window is a huge heap of kindling wood, part of your
 plan.

>examine cage
 It's a functional metal cage, its floor covered with hay. A single bar
 is all that keeps the thylacaine from escaping.

>shoot bar
 Taking careful aim, you fire the arrow across the garden and hit the
 bar dead-on. The arrow shatters into unrecognizable pieces of wood, as
 you predicted, The door swings open with a slight creak. The thylacine
 is confused at first - it sniffs the morning air, then takes one
 tentative step outside. There is shouting from the house. The tasmanian
 wolf take this as its cuse and dashes across the lawn and into the
 wood. You break the bow across and stuff it into a heap of kindling
 below the window.

>climb out window
 I only understood you as far as wanting to climb outside.

>look

   a hand guard (being worn)
   a flower pot
   a jar of silica
   a squirt gun
   a bowtie (being worn)
   a top hat (being worn)

>examine case
 This velvet houses a bismuth crystal. It was given to you by the
 grandson of Claude François Geoffroy, in recognition of your travels to
 Antarctica in the early 1860s.
 It was in early 1863,  6 months after you left, that Maura was  born.
 You only received the news on your return to Spitzbergen in 1865. And
 when you finally returned home, she was already toddling around the
 living room.

>break glass

>examine crystal
 You can't see any such thing.

 never paid it much mind.

>remove flower from pot
 You can't see any such thing.

>SAVE
>cf4
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>spray self
 You shoot a good dose of the poison straight into your mouth. You'll be
 dead within seconds now.

>undo
 At the window
 [Previous turn undone.]

>spray self
 You shoot a good dose of the poison straight into your mouth. You'll be
 dead within seconds now.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The poison works as quickly as expected. There is little pain.
 You have freed the thylacine from a prison far different and yet
 similar to your own, but this clearly looks like suicide. The shame on
 your family will be great.

 "But what made you realize that this was not a heart attack from seeing
 his famed animal escape, my dear Holmes?"
 "I am not yet ready to believe, Watson, that there are people in this
 world who are more hurt by the escape of a, however, prestigious,
 animal, then the death of their own daughter. This made me think that
 mayhaps we gave the Professor too little credit for human emotion in
 our investigations. The piece of string you idly observe the house cat
 play with on that heap of kindling was another hint that something was
 not quite right here; And finally, the sorry stage of this begonia made
 me investigate the squirt gun and solve this mystery. However, I
 propose, assuming your complicity, we let this matter rest and not get
 our good friend Lestrade involved in this. This family has quite
 suffered enough."
 "Will this be a warning to you, my dear friend, to the effect of not
 letting yourself get too caught up in matters far removed from the
 world?"
 "Some day, dear friend, some day. But first, I have this interesting
 matter of the giant rat of Sumatra to consider."

 It's bleak here, and there is a foreboding sense of fear in the air
 that you could cut with a knife.

 That is, you could cut it with a knife if you had a knife.

 Or opposable thumbs.

 You are a Turkey!
 A truly speedy Speed IF. by Jacqueline A Lott
 Release 1 / Serial number 111127 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 If this is your first time playing this game, you should type ABOUT at
 the prompt.
 I would recommend that you do this on your first turn.

 Turkey Farm
 This is the happy little turkey farm where you and all the other
 turkeys live in peace and happiness, just cluckin" and gobblin" and
 gettin" fat.  It's a grand life... except things seem sort of less
 happy today for some reason.

>about
 Yes, I wrote this in under half an hour, and there were no beta
 testers.  Sorry.

 This was written at the very last second for ClubFloyd's 2011
 Thanksgiving Speed-IF session, inspired by olethros saying, "let's play
 You Are A Turkey!" So before you go blaming me, consider first blaming
 Christos Dimitrakakis.

 Happy Thanksgiving!

>examine me
 "Gobble?"  Try phrasing your command in Engish, you silly bird.

 The atmosphere here is definitely not a pleasant one today.

>inventory
 "Gobble?"  What do you mean?  Speak English, Turkey!

 You're beginning to feel a sense of worry deep in your gizzard.

>panic
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>run
 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

 Wait, was that Sarah Palin?  Nah, couldn't be.

>go north
 "Gobble?"  You expect me to understand that gibberish?

 Who is that nice man in the flannel shirt?  He picks you up and turns
 you upside down and puts your head in some sort of funnel... wait!
 What the... ?!  Nooooo!



     *** Don't worry, turkey, I'm sure you were delicious! ***
