 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 "We'll have to split up. I'll go after the bombers, you find the
 fastest way out of here. Tell the President he has to evacuate,
 immediately!"

 Those were the last words you heard from Captain McBrawn before he rode
 away hanging on the skid of a helicopter with one hand, his muscular
 arm gleaming in the light of the setting sun. It is up to you now to
 find your way to the President of the World and warn him of the
 impending attack. Finally, some responsibility after all these years!

 You descend from the rooftop planning the trip to the drop-off point.
 At the base of the building the Screaming Communists capture you.
 Figures.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 A group of stern, vicious looking Screaming Communists march through
 the barren land, dragging you behind them. Their destination is a
 gloomy medieval castle. The commander shouts orders to one of the
 soldiers who grabs you by the collar of your sweater and escorts you
 inside.

 After a long climb through dark corridors and endless staircases the
 guard throws you in a dark, cold cell and slams the door shut. A chill
 runs down your spine and desperation starts to creep in.

 This game is free software. Type LICENSE for details.


 The moonlight gives dim illumination to the front part of the cell,
 leaving the opposite wall completely in the dark. There's an unlit
 light bulb hanging from the ceiling and a heavy steel door on the wall
 opposite to the barred window, but the room is otherwise featureless.

 You can barely make out the outlines of some dark shapes in one dark
 corner of the cell.

 (For more information about the game, type ABOUT.)

>call president on the phone and tell him to get the heck out of there
 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine me
 You're the hero of the day, the man everyone looks up to, the
 uncontested champion of the Free World, the celebrated superstar -
 Captain McBrawn.

 Or at least you would like to be. The truth is that you are Scotty,
 Captain McBrawn's short and a bit round sidekick. You have followed him
 on his adventures and helped him mostly by staying out of his way, but
 now you have a mission of your own.

 You are carrying a photograph and wearing your adventuring clothes.

>inventory
 You are carrying a photograph and wearing your adventuring clothes.

>examine photograph
 It's a postcard sized signed photograph of Captain McBrawn. You carry
 it with you everywhere you go and it's beginning to show the wear and
 tear.

>examine shapes
 There's something very unnerving in the darkest corner of the cell...
 You can see the outlines of a round lumpy object and another, taller
 figure almost your size.

 It's as if the taller shape just moved a bit. You hold back a whimper.

>listen
 The cell is ominously silent.

>examine clothes
>examine shapes
 You are wearing a pair of green pocketless pants and a gray wool
 sweater. Your adventuring clothes - that's what mom said when she
 bought them. They've turned out being not very well suited for the
 purpose though. They're very thick and a bit too big.

 You daren't look anymore. Maybe they'll go away.

 The rectangle on the cell door slides open and a pair of beady eyes
 appear behind it. "WHAT is all this RACKET?" a loud voice behind the
 door says.

 "Help! You have to get me out of here!" you beg.

 "HA! HA! WHY would I do THAT? I'M THE GUARD, I'M SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOU
 INSIDE!" the voice roars.

 The moonlight gives dim illumination to the front part of the cell,
 leaving the opposite wall completely in the dark. There's an unlit
 light bulb hanging from the ceiling and a heavy steel door on the wall
 opposite to the barred window, but the room is otherwise featureless.

 You can barely make out the outlines of some dark shapes in one dark
 corner of the cell.

>examine clothes
 You are wearing a pair of green pocketless pants and a gray wool
 sweater. Your adventuring clothes - that's what mom said when she
 bought them. They've turned out being not very well suited for the
 purpose though. They're very thick and a bit too big.

>ask guard to turn on lights
 There is no reply.

 "WELL if you DIDN'T HAVE anything else," the guard shouts and closes
 the eyehole.

>examine shapes
 You daren't look anymore. Maybe they'll go away.

>examine pocket
 There's no such thing here now.

>look

 bought them. They've turned out being not very well suited for the
 purpose though. They're very thick and a bit too big.

>remove sweater
 You strip naked.

>examine me
 You are Scotty, Captain McBrawn's short and a bit round sidekick. You
 have followed him on his adventures and helped him mostly by staying
 out of his way, but now you have a mission of your own.

 You are carrying a photograph and wearing nothing.

 Also, your adventuring clothes are on the floor.

>touch shapes
 You don't have the courage.

>listen
 The cell is ominously silent.

>smell
 The air smells weird, like the cell has never been cleaned.

>smell
 The air smells weird, like the cell has never been cleaned.

>hello
 "Hello? Anyone?" you say quietly but get no answer.

>examine floor
 The stone floor is a dirty and cold.

>examine walls
 The gray stone walls surround you from all directions.

>examine ceiling
 The ceiling is far above the ground. There's a largish square up in the
 ceiling on one side.

>examine square
 There's a largish square up in the ceiling on one side.

>push it
 The largish square is out of reach.

>examine bulb
 The light bulb is hanging low on an electrical wire. It is unlit.

>examine picture
 It's a postcard sized signed photograph of Captain McBrawn. You carry
 it with you everywhere you go and it's beginning to show the wear and
 tear.

>read it
 The moonlight isn't sufficient enough for that.

>examine window
 The window is nothing but a hole in the wall with three iron bars
 running across it. Through it you see a beautiful moonlit night sky.

>examine bars
 Three iron bars prevent anyone from climbing out the window.

>look
 The moonlight gives dim illumination to the front part of the cell,
 leaving the opposite wall completely in the dark. There's an unlit
 light bulb hanging from the ceiling and a heavy steel door on the wall
 opposite to the barred window, but the room is otherwise featureless.

 You can barely make out the outlines of some dark shapes in one dark
 corner of the cell.

 The light is just enough for you to see the adventuring clothes on the
 floor.

>pull bars
 You can't pry them loose.

>examine bulb
 The light bulb is hanging low on an electrical wire. It is unlit.

>pull bulb
 The bulb comes easily out from its socket. It was screwed in only very
 slightly.

>knock on door
 The rectangle on the cell door slides open and a pair of beady eyes
 appear behind it. "WHAT is all this RACKET?" a loud voice behind the
 door says. After a short pause the voice goes: "WHAT THE... are you
 NAKED IN THERE?"

>guard, yes
 The guard refuses.

>ask guard about light
 (the light bulb)
 "Could you please switch the light on?" you ask politely. "WHAT ARE you
 TALKING ABOUT?" the guard yells. "The power IS ALREADY ON!"

>ask guard about bed
 "I do not UNDERSTAND you!" the guard shouts.

>put bulb in socket
 You screw the lamp tighter into the socket and it lights up.

 The light reveals the rest of the cell - an air duct running above the
 window, a simple rug on the floor, a hole that's probably meant to be
 used as a toilet and not much more.

 Except a small, grinning, black monster in the corner next to a bulky
 sack.

 "WHAT the... HELP!" you scream.

>examine monster
 You move across the room toward the creature. The lamp hanging from the
 ceiling is just on the right height to bonk you on the forehead on your
 way. (ktonk!)

 The creature is small, shorter than you, and pitch black. It has an
 oblong head, no ears, tiny black eyes, and sharp, black teeth clearly
 visible behind a lipless mouth.

 A constant dripping of spit from between its teeth forms a small
 greenish puddle of saliva by its feet.

>tell guard about monster
 You lean closer to the door and whisper: "There is some... thing in the
 cell with me!"

 "You are IMAGINING things!" the guard yells.

>say gollum
 That verb is not available.

>point to monster
 (with the photograph)
 You point the photograph at the creature.

>read photograph
 "To Sotty, Cpt. Harrison McBrawn." Good ol' Captain. Still doesn't
 remember your name.

>ask monster about guard
 "I guess that was all," you say to the guard before talking to H.R.
 "JUST DON'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE," the guard yells and slides the eyehole
 shut.

 Before getting into detailed discussion, your first reaction is to
 tackle the surprising situation with the delicacy you have applied to
 most things in your life. "What the duck is that!?" you yell and point
 at the creature. Much to your (additional) surprise, it replies. "Well,
 that's not what I would call a friendly greeting, monkey boy!"

 You dare to go a bit closer. "H.R.'s the name, and -trading- is my
 game!" It pats the sack it has next to it. "I have everything a man of
 your standing would need, from kitchen utensils to trebuchets. Looks
 like I got your attention, little man - if you're interested, ask me
 for a -free sample-!"

 It takes a while for the words to sink in. Not the least because the
 creature's voice combines hisses, clicks and high-pitched whirs which
 makes it quite hard to understand.

>creature
 That verb is not available.

>examine creature
 The creature is small, shorter than you, and pitch black. It has an
 oblong head, no ears, tiny black eyes, and sharp, black teeth clearly
 visible behind a lipless mouth.

 A constant dripping of spit from between its teeth forms a small
 greenish puddle of saliva by its feet.

>ask hr about trading
 "So... You're a trader?" you ask. "Yessir, that I am!" the creature
 replies. "I am well known everywhere in -Castle Schweinehund-, swapping
 items you no longer need for quality merchandise! Just show me what you
 got and I'll see if there's something I could trade you for it."

>ask creature for free sample
 "So, what's the free sample?" you venture.

 "The free sample, eh?" H.R. says and flashes a smile. "The minute I saw
 you I said to myself 'H.R., there is a man who goes to the supermarket
 just for the free taste samples.'" It reaches for the sack and pulls
 out a squarish metallic object which it hands to you. "Here ya go,
 sport. Knock your teeth out."

>ask hr about Castle Schweinehund
 "What is this place anyhow? Where are we?"

 "This is Castle Schweinehund," H.R. tells you. "Story goes that the
 -previous owners- built it on an ancient burial ground and used it to
 perform occultist rituals, opening portals to other worlds and so on.
 Sounds like old wives' tales to me," it says and runs its hand across
 its tail.

>ask hr about previous owners
 "Who were the previous owners?"

 "I'm not sure exactly. They were quite loud as well but not to the
 extent of the current ones."

>examine metal
 What do you want to examine: the metal plate, or the squarish metallic
 object?

>object
 After closer inspection the squarish metallic object turns out to be a
 slightly rusted Skindude(tm) multitool. It has two hollow halves
 connected with a hinge on one end. The halves can be opened to reveal
 knives, files, pliers and other tools inside. Excellent.

>take clothes
 (first dropping the Skindude(tm) multitool to make room)
 You lift the adventuring clothes to your arms.

>take skindude
 (first dropping the adventuring clothes to make room)
 Taken.

>take clothes
 (first dropping the Skindude(tm) multitool to make room)
 You lift the adventuring clothes to your arms.

>wear clothes
 "Thank heavens," H.R. sighs when you put on your clothes.

>show skindude to hr
 (first taking the Skindude(tm) multitool)
 You decide to hold on to it for a bit longer. It might still come
 useful.

>examine puddle
 A sizzling greenish puddle of saliva is forming by the feet of the
 creature.

>show clothes to hr
 (first taking the clothes off)
 "Can I get anything for these?" you ask and offer your clothes to the
 creature.

 H.R. looks at the clothes in disdain. "If I took them, it would mean
 you couldn't put them back on. And that's very unacceptable."

 "Aww, don't sulk," H.R. says when it sees your expression. "Let's make
 a deal: you put your clothes back on and I'll give you something nice.
 Ok?"

>wear clothes
 You put your clothes back on.

 "That's more like it! Here you go," H.R. says and digs through the
 sack. It hands you a small tube.

>examine tube
 It is a small tube of glue remover.

>ask hr about saliva
 What do you want to ask H.R. about: the puddle of saliva, or the acidic
 spit?

>spit
 That's a nasty habit.

 "Yeah, and your -spit- isn't as cool as mine," H.R. comments.

>ask hr about vent
 "Where does that vent lead?"

 "Oh, it runs through the entire castle," H.R. tells you. "And it
 reaches the outside in several places, of course."

>ask hr about acidic spit
 What do you want to ask H.R. about: the puddle of saliva, or the acidic
 spit?

>examine vent
 The aluminum air duct runs from one wall to another. It's quite large
 but not set very high, just few centimeters above your head. There's a
 small grate in the bottom of it.

 H.R. burps and covers its mouth with its hand. "Sorry. Had Mexicans for
 lunch."

>ask hr about puddle
 You don't find anything to say about that topic right now.

>show photo to hr
 (first taking the photograph)
 "Look, here's Captain McBrawn. Doesn't he look heroic and brave?"

 "Wait, where's his head?" H.R. asks. "It's right there behind his
 biceps," you say.

>inventory
 You are carrying a photograph and some glue remover and wearing your
 adventuring clothes.

 Also, a Skindude(tm) multitool is on the floor.

>examine multitool
 It's a slightly rusted Skindude(tm) multitool, with all sorts of useful
 tools inside.

>ask hr about spit
 What do you want to ask H.R. about: the puddle of saliva, or the acidic
 spit?

>open multitool
 You pull the halves apart and the Skindude(tm) opens with a creak. A
 swarm of rust flakes flies from the hinges. Looks like almost
 everything inside is rusted through; the only tool that looks even
 remotely useful is the screwdriver.

>ask hr about acidic spit
 What do you want to ask H.R. about: the puddle of saliva, or the acidic
 spit?

>ask hr about acidic
 What do you want to ask H.R. about: the puddle of saliva, or the acidic

>open vent with screwdriver
 (first taking the Skindude(tm) multitool)
 It's not locked.

>examine hole
 It's a smelly little hole.

>look in hole
 Fortunately it seems to be empty.

>examine door
 The door is made of heavy reinforced steel plates, attached with large
 bolts. The hinges are on the left side and on the right side is the
 keyhole.

 There's a small rectangular metal plate in the middle of the door.

>examine plate
 You move across the room to get closer to the metal plate. The lamp
 hits you on the forehead again. (ktonk)

 There's a metal plate embedded in the door on the eye level, about
 three centimeters high and thirty centimeters wide.

 H.R. taps the floor with its foot.

>examine lamp
 The light bulb is hanging low on an electrical wire. It is lit.

>open metal plate
 There's no obvious mechanism to open it from this side.

>examine wire
 The wire hangs from the ceiling from a fragile looking attachment and
 leads to the cross section of the ceiling and two walls.

>examine plate
 There's a metal plate embedded in the door on the eye level, about
 three centimeters high and thirty centimeters wide.

>unscrew plate
 It doesn't move.

 H.R. yawns.

>pry plate
 That verb is not available.

>examine hinges
 The hinges of the door are screwed into the wall.

>pry open plate with screwdriver
 That verb is not available.

>open plate with screwdriver
 There's no lock on it.

>go up
 You jump up and down.

>look
 The cell walls are of gray stone and a small barred window leads
 outside to freedom. A silvery air vent runs right above the window and
 there's a hole in the floor under it in the corner, apparently to be
 used as a toilet. A light bulb hangs from the ceiling illuminating the
 cell. A simple rug is on the floor.

 H.R. stands there next to a large burlap sack.

>unscrew hinges with screwdriver
 You take the Skindude(tm) multitool and loosen the screws on the
 hinges.

 After a good push the door falls open without its hinges. You run
 through it and turn left in the corridor - and end up in the arms of
 the guard. "HOW THE... DID THE DOOR JUST FALL DOWN?" he shouts.

 The guard grabs you and takes you to what's probably a break room.
 There are a dozen Screaming Communists sitting there, watching you
 suspiciously and shouting a word or two at times.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 "Congratulations on your escape," H.R. mocks you when they return you
 to the cell. The door seems to be fixed now.

 You wave the screwdriver victoriously. "They didn't take this away!
 I'll just unscrew the hinges again!"

 "Oh, by the way, they bolted the hinges while you were away. Sorry,
 what were you saying?"

>examine rug
 The rug has bright stripes in all the colors of a neon rainbow.

>take rug
 (first dropping the Skindude(tm) multitool and the glue remover to make
 room)
 You roll the rug and lift it to your arms.

 Glancing down on the floor where the rug used to be you notice a
 trapdoor in the floor!

 "What a shocking revelation," H.R. says.

>show rug to hr
 You remember the low-hanging lamp mere milliseconds before it hits you
 on the forehead. (ktonk)

 "Would you trade this with me?" you ask.

 "Hmm... It is a nice rug, in a way, but I've seen much nicer ones in my
 days. It doesn't even fly," H.R. sneers. "But since you're my best
 customer in this cell at the moment, I'll get you something nice for
 it. Let's see... a Jack Mills novel... no... a trophy... hmm..."

 The creature pulls from its sack a large cube-like thingamabob, hands
 it to you and puts the rug away.

>examine cube
 The cube-like thingamabob has a window on one side where you can see
 some tubes in Y shape inside. Red labels are pasted all over the
 device, the one on top saying "FLUX CAPACITOR". The two dials are
 labeled "POWER" and "SPEED" and there's a pin with a picture of a
 lightning bolt next to it. It is very heavy.

>examine cube
 The flux capacitor has a window on one side where you can see some
 tubes in Y shape inside. Red labels are pasted all over the device, the
 one on top saying "FLUX CAPACITOR". The two dials are labeled "POWER"
 and "SPEED" and there's a pin with a picture of a lightning bolt next
 to it. It is very heavy.

>take all

 Taken.
 Skindude(tm) multitool: Taken.
 toilet hole: Taken. Wait, what?

 (bulky items, i.e. the flux capacitor, were ignored)

>show flux capacitor to hr
 (first taking the flux capacitor)
 You decide to hold on to it for a bit longer. It might still come
 useful.

>inventory
 You are carrying a flux capacitor and a photograph and wearing your
 adventuring clothes.

 Also, some glue remover, a Skindude(tm) multitool, and a toilet hole
 are on the floor.

>show multitool to hr
 "I don't want this. It's rusted through," you complain. "It was free,"
 H.R. snaps. "Oh well, I guess I could find something else... " It
 rummages through its sack. "Let's see... a cake... no... a brass
 lamp... hmm... Here, you can have this."

 It hands you a dusty old book.

 (first dropping the flux capacitor to make room)
>take hole
 Taken.

>put hole on door
 (ktonk)

 You slap the hole against the door. It sticks there and through it you
 can see the corridor on the other side.

 "That seems... unlikely," you say"I've seen stranger things around
 here," H.R. shrugs.

>enter hole
 It's way too small to fit through.

>reach through hole
 You put your hand through the hole in the door. Yes, the key is in the
 lock and at your reach!

>turn key
 You reach through the toilet hole and reach for the keyhole on the
 other side. You are delighted to find the key in the lock!

 The key turns easily and you open the door very very carefully. You
 sneak into the corridor and close the door again.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

>unlock door with key
 The guard stands behind the door with his arms crossed.

 "Do you REALLY THINK I wouldn't NOTICE A HAND REACHING THROUGH THE
 DOOR?" he roars.

 "Well I kinda assumed so," you say.

 He squints his eyes and takes a step forward. You open the door again,
 step inside and close the door.

 The guard grabs the hole and pulls it off. "NO MORE TRICKS!" he yells.

>undo

 Due to some mysterious bump in time-space continuum, you find yourself
 in the exact situation you were just a minute ago.

 "Talk about Deus ex Machina," H.R. remarks.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine hole
 It's a smelly little hole. Incredibly enough it seems to be a portable
 model.

 The toilet hole is currently attached to the door.

>get hole
 You peel the hole off the door.

>score
 You have escaped once by unscrewing the hinges on the door.

 "I bet if I put you in a paper bag and gave you scissors you couldn't
 find your way out," H.R. speculates.

>put hole on door
 You slap the hole against the door. It sticks there and through it you
 can see the corridor on the other side.

 That's not something you could put your hand through.

>reach through hole
 You put your hand through the hole in the door. Yes, the key is in the
 lock and at your reach!

>turn key
 You reach through the toilet hole and reach for the keyhole on the
 other side. You are delighted to find the key in the lock!

 The key turns easily and you open the door very very carefully. You
 sneak into the corridor and close the door again.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 The guard stands behind the door with his arms crossed.

 "Do you REALLY THINK I wouldn't NOTICE A HAND REACHING THROUGH THE
 DOOR?" he roars.

 "Well I kinda assumed so," you say.

 He squints his eyes and takes a step forward. You open the door again,
 step inside and close the door.

>inventory
 You are carrying a dusty old book and a photograph and wearing your

 Also, a flux capacitor and some glue remover are on the floor.

>examine book
 It says "ENCYCLOP?DIA ESCAP?DIA: The Definite Guide to Getting Out of
 All Kinds of Trouble" in large block letters on the cover.

>read book
 Instead of finding pages full of useful information you find that all
 the pages apart from one have been glued together and the book has been
 carved hollow to create a secret compartment inside. In the compartment
 there's a drinking glass and a small bottle of brown liquid.

>examine liquid
 What do you want to examine: the glue remover, the puddle of saliva, or
 the whiskey bottle?

>bottle
 According to the label the bottle contains Meisterj?ger, a strong

 "Use" is too vague; you need to be more specific.

>apply glue remover to book
 That verb is not available.

>fill glass with acid

 The sticker has a small red circle and the words "Push to open" printed
 on it.

>hr, spit on hinges

 "Nope," the creature says.

>take acid with glass
 That command is too complex; you might want to try to just take the
 puddle of saliva.

>take puddle
 You scoop some of the spit from the floor into the glass.

>pour spit on hinges
 (the acidic spit on the hinges)
 You move across the room, now remembering that devilish lamp and going
 around it! Take that, lamp!

 (first taking the acidic spit)
 You pour a few drops of the spit on the hinges. The spit sizzles away
 in trails of smoke, leaving brown spots where it landed.

>pour spit on bars

 (first trying to take the puddle of saliva)
 You scoop some of the spit from the floor into the glass.

>pour spit on bars
 (the acidic spit on the iron bars)
 (first taking the acidic spit)
 Carefully applying the creature's spit on both ends of the bars, one
 after another they corrode off and fall on the cell floor. You climb
 out through the window. It's hard to see in the dark, but the ground
 doesn't seem to be that far away so you just jump.

 "Freedom! Freedom! Free--" you rejoice just before landing in a moat.
 Your are in the water by the neck and your feet are stuck in the mud.
 "Uh... Hello? Someone? ..."


 Please press SPACE to continue.

>push space
 The Screaming Communists find you after a couple of hours, pull you out
 from the moat and return you back to the cell.

 "How was the freedom?" H.R. asks.

>score
 You have escaped three times:
  - by unscrewing the hinges on the door
  - by unlocking the door through the hole

 FLASHLIGHT

 A flashlight is an essential tool in any dark or low-light environment.
 It is a device that consists of a lamp inside a parable-shaped casing
 surrounded by a reflective surface to focus the light to a single
 direction.

 Flashlights can been used as communication devices, typically by
 flashing the light in pre-agreed sequences. There are documented
 cases[citation needed] of using a flashlight or a searchlight as a
 signalling device by attaching a template in front of the light source
 to create shapes in the surface the light is pointed at.

>examine book
 It's an ENCYCLOP?DIA ESCAP?DIA shaped box with barely any of the
 articles left to read. There's a whiskey bottle inside.

>examine lamp
 The light bulb is hanging low on an electrical wire. It is lit.

>examine glue remover
 It is a small tube of glue remover.

>point lamp at window
 (the barred window)
 (first taking the light bulb)
 "Stupid bulb, you're gonna get it," you mutter and yank the bulb from
 its socket. The wire snaps and you're left with a bulb attached to
 nothing but its socket.

 Miraculously enough the bulb is still lit even when it's not connected
 to anything. "Hmm," H.R. muses.

 You point the light bulb at the barred window.

>take bottle
 Taken.

>examine label
 What do you want to examine: the flux capacitor, the sticker, or the
 whiskey bottle?

>examine sticker
 The sticker has a small red circle and the words "Push to open" printed
 on it.

>take sticker
 It's glued fast. It doesn't come off with bare hands.

>examine trapdoor
 It's a wooden trapdoor set in the floor. It looks like there's some
 sort of sticker on it.

>push trapdoor
 You push hard on random places a couple of times, but it doesn't open.

>push sticker
 There's a click and the trapdoor drops open. Underneath you see another
>push sticker
 room very similar to this one.

 "Hey hey!" you rejoice. "Oh joy," H.R. cheers laconically.

 Nothing happens.

>go down
 You jump down the trapdoor to the room below, thumping down on your
 feet and facing a stone wall. "Now, let's see if this room is easier to
 escape than the last one," you say to yourself. "I very much doubt it,"
 says the creature's voice next to you.

 "How the grue did you get here before me?" you cry. "I didn't, monkey
 boy. You dropped down the hatch in the ceiling the moment you went
 through the trapdoor," it grunts.

>open glue remover
 You open the cap and close it again. No need to keep it opened before
 it's used.

>remove sticker with glue remover
 (first taking the glue remover)
 The glue remover is effective immediately and the sticker comes off
 easily.

>examine sticker
 The sticker has a small red circle and the words "Push to open" printed
 on it.

>put sticker on door
 You slap the sticker on the door.

>push sticker
 There's a click and the cell door swings violently open. You don't stop
 to wonder how and why it worked when you take off.
 "HEY!" the guard yells behind you. You keep running through the
 corridors and manage to lose him from your tail.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 The castle's twisty corridors are like a maze and very soon you are
 completely lost. After wandering for some time longer you come across a
 trapdoor in the floor. "Can't hurt to try this one too," you think to
 yourself.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 You drop down the trapdoor and find yourself staring at H.R.'s oblong
 face. You're back in the cell.
 "What the... how the..." you stutter.
 "Tee hee," H.R. giggles.

>look
 The cell walls are of gray stone and a small barred window leads
 outside to freedom. A silvery air vent runs right above the window. The
 light bulb you carry illuminates the cell.

 There's an open trapdoor on the floor.

 H.R. waves at you.

 On the floor are some iron bars and a flux capacitor.

>examine bars
 The bars used to be in the window before you corroded them off. They
 seem to have replaced the bars in the window but left the old ones
 behind.

>get bars
 Taken.

 Dark clouds gather in the sky and block the moonlight.

>examine bars
 The bars used to be in the window before you corroded them off. They
 seem to have replaced the bars in the window but left the old ones

>show bars to hr
 The creature shrugs. "Meh. Those kind of things don't sell."

>examine door
 The door is made of heavy reinforced steel plates, attached with large
 bolts. The hinges are on the left side and on the right side is the
 keyhole.

 There's a small rectangular metal plate in the middle of the door.

>hit door with bars
 There's no such thing here now.

 FLASHLIGHT

 A flashlight is an essential tool in any dark or low-light environment.
 It is a device that consists of a lamp inside a parable-shaped casing
 surrounded by a reflective surface to focus the light to a single
 direction.

 Flashlights can been used as communication devices, typically by
 flashing the light in pre-agreed sequences. There are documented
 cases[citation needed] of using a flashlight or a searchlight as a
 signalling device by attaching a template in front of the light source
 to create shapes in the surface the light is pointed at.

>examine photograph
 It's a postcard sized signed photograph of Captain McBrawn. You carry
 it with you everywhere you go and it's beginning to show the wear and
 tear.

 H.R. digs a paper tissue from its bag and tries to wipe some spit from
 around its mouth. The tissue sizzles and melts away leaving just a
 faint trace of smoke.

>tear photograph
 Never! Even the very thought makes you weep gently.

 "Oh boo hoo", H.R. says and in exaggerated motions pretends to rub its
 eyes with fists.

>put photograph in front of lamp
 There's no such thing here now.

>put photograph in book
>put photograph on lamp
 You put the photograph into the encyclopedia.

 (first taking the photograph)
 Putting things on the light bulb would probably not get you any closer
 to escaping.

>put photograph on bulb
 Putting things on the light bulb would probably not get you any closer
 to escaping.

>put photograph in front of bulb
 There's no such thing here now.

>examine flux
 The flux capacitor has a window on one side where you can see some
 tubes in Y shape inside. Red labels are pasted all over the device, the
 one on top saying "FLUX CAPACITOR". The two dials are labeled "POWER"
 and "SPEED" and there's a pin with a picture of a lightning bolt next
 to it. It is very heavy.

>examine speed
 The speed dial points at zero. Curiously there's a large red line at
 about 88 miles per hour mark.

>open trapdoor
 It is tightly locked.

>push sticker
>look
 There's no such thing here now.

 The cell walls are of gray stone and a small barred window leads
 outside to freedom. A silvery air vent runs right above the window. The
 light bulb illuminates the cell.

 There's an open trapdoor on the floor.

 H.R. leans against its sack.

 On the barred window is an encyclopedia (in which is a light bulb).

 On the floor is a flux capacitor.

>ask hr about delorean
 You're about to ask, but you're not sure how to word the question.

>put capacitor in trapdoor
 (first taking the flux capacitor)
 (first dropping the iron bars, the whiskey bottle, and the drinking
 glass to make room)
 The flux capacitor falls down the trapdoor and lands back in front of
 you.

>examine power
 The power dial goes from zero to 1.21 gigawatts. It's currently
 pointing at zero.

>ask hr about sack
 "What's in the bag?" you ask.

 "That's where I keep my ware," H.R. responds. "You'll find out what's
 there when you trade something."

>inventory
 You are carrying a photograph and wearing your adventuring clothes.

 Also, a flux capacitor, a drinking glass, a whiskey bottle, and some
 iron bars are on the floor.

>show bars to hr
 (first taking the iron bars)
 "I think I have one of those already," H.R. says.

>examine glass
 (the drinking glass)
 The drinking glass is empty.

>attach wire to capacitor
 Sparks fly to the air when you touch the socket on the flux capacitor
 with the exposed wire. There's a loud click from inside the machinery
 and the tubes behind the front window light up and start blinking like
 christmas lights.

 The needle on the power dial turns to point at 1.21 gigawatts.

 H.R. burps and covers its mouth with its hand. "Sorry. Had Mexicans for
 lunch."

>put capacity in trapdoor
 There's no such thing here now.

>put capacitor in trapdoor
 (first taking the flux capacitor)
 (first dropping the iron bars to make room)
 The flux capacitor falls down the trapdoor and lands back in front of
 you.

>throw capacitor out window
 That command is too complex; you might want to try to just throw the
 flux capacitor.

>throw capacitor
 The flux capacitor is already here.

>ask hr about flux
 "What the shuck is this?"

 "It's a... well, you find out yourself," H.R. replies.

>drop capacitor out window
 That command is too complex; you might want to try to just drop the
 flux capacitor.

>put capacity in window
 There's no such thing here now.

>put capacitor in window
 (the barred window)
 (first taking the flux capacitor)
 That is not something you could put stuff into.

 "Hey, watch those stranded prepositions," H.R. points out.

>examine windows
 There's no such thing here now.

>examine window
 (the barred window)
 The window is nothing but a hole in the wall with thick slab of
 transparent plexiglas installed to it. Through it you see a beautiful
 moonlit night sky.

>examine plexiglas
 The Screaming Communists have replaced the iron bars with thick
 transparent plexiglas while you were away. At least it'll keep the cold
 away better than before.

>scream
 The rectangle on the cell door slides open and a pair of beady eyes
 appear behind it. "WHAT is all this RACKET?" a loud voice behind the
 door says.

>show capacitor to guard
 The guard doesn't seem interested.

>kiss guard
 Keep your mind on the game.

>show book to guard
 (first taking the encyclopedia)
 The guard doesn't seem interested.

 The guard grunts and closes the eyehole.

>drink whiskey
 It's too strong for your tastes.

>scream
 The rectangle on the cell door slides open and a pair of beady eyes
 appear behind it. "WHAT is all this RACKET?" a loud voice behind the
 door says.

>poke eyes
 That verb is not available.

>show whiskey to guard
 (first taking the whiskey bottle)
 "Would you be interested in a... little drink?" you say and dangle the
 bottle in front of the eyehole. "Uh, is that MEISTERJ?GER? I most
 certainly SHOULD NOT... Maybe a little bit, JUST TO KEEP ME WARM ...
 JUST SLIP it through the HOLE, will you?" "It won't fit through," you
 remark. "I must open the door... But KEEP IT QUIET, WILL YOU?"

 There's a click from the keyhole and the door opens slightly. You slip
 the bottle to the guard who snatches it from your hand and slams the
 door shut. In his excitement he doesn't remember to lock the door! You
 wait for a moment and open it very carefully.

 The guard is enjoying his prize and doesn't notice you slipping through
 the door. You navigate through the castle corridors until you stop
 behind a door where you hear conversation behind it.

 "DID YOU HEAR that FEDOR has found a BOTTLE OF MEISTERJ?GER?" a voice
 yells.

 "Meisterj?ger? AND HE'S NOT SHARING?" another voice shouts. Several
 other voices murmur in unison. It gets harder to hear, but it seems
 they all decide to pay a visit to Fedor and his bottle. By the time
 you've deduced this, the door opens and twenty Screaming Communists
 march out.

 "FEDOR, you OLD DRUNK we've come to DRINK FOR YOUR HEALTH and we've
 BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT," they shout as they shove you to his lap.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 The sounds of the Screaming Communists gradually die out when the
 bottle is finally empty and you're back in the cell with H.R.

 "Welcome back," it says.

>examine glass

 The drinking glass is empty.

 There's a knock on the door. Not waiting for a response the guard opens
 the door and shouts: "Your DINNER IS HERE!" He throws a plate in the
 cell with a silvery package on it and locks the door again.

>hit capacitor with bar
 There's no such thing here now.

>examine package
 It's a small bundle of tin foil. Judging by the pungent smell there
 might be some food inside.

>open package
 You open the tin foil, revealing fried fish.

>examine fish
 They have fried the fish whole but it still looks quite raw. It is
 reddish in color; it might be a red herring.
 "I'm quite sure it is not," H.R. doubts.

>get fish
 Taken.

>show fish to hr
 "Do you want this?" you ask.

 "Oh no I couldn't... YES I CAN," H.R. shrieks and grabs the foil from
 your hands. Pieces of fish and drops of saliva fly around as the
 creature devours your meal. The gruesome show ends in H.R. silently
 burping and throwing the now empty foil over its shoulder. "Wow, that
 really hit the spot. Yeah, maybe you'd like something in return?"

 It puts its hand in the sack and majestically pulls out tiny nail
 scissors and hands them to you.

>undo

 Due to some mysterious bump in time-space continuum, you find yourself
 in the exact situation you were just a minute ago.

 "No reason to get that dramatic," H.R. says. "It's just UNDO."

 [Previous turn undone.]

>eat fish
 You can't bring yourself to eating it.

 "What, you can't eat the sweet, sweet fish? You're one mysterious

>wrap capacitor in foil

>tear foil
 That's not something you can tear.

 H.R. scratches its head.

>cut photograph
 After hesitating for a while you carefully cut out Captain McBrawn's
 image from the photograph. It takes a good while with the nearly
 useless dull scissors.

 You look at the McBrawn's silhouette, which is perfectly cut out but
 the photograph and the autograph is ruined. The sacrifice makes a
 silent tear roll on your cheek.

 "I knew a girl like you once," H.R. remarks. "She was five and she
 liked ponies. I bet you like ponies too, don't you."

>yes
 H.R. gives you a thumbs-up and a grin.

>put silhouette on lamp

 You can't attach them together.

>put lamp in glass
 (the drinking glass)
 (the tin foil)
 (first taking the light bulb)
 You put the light bulb inside the glass and the tin foil concentrates
 and reflects the light into a bright beam of light.

>put silhouette on glass
 (the makeshift flashlight)
 (first taking the photograph)
 You put Captain McBrawn's silhouette on top of the drinking glass.

 The beam of light emitting from the drinking glass casts a shadow on
 the wall shaped like the Captain.

 "Nananananananana CAP-TAAIN!" H.R. sings.

>point flashlight at window
 (the barred window)
 Captain McBrawn's silhouette reflects clearly to the clouds above. You
 hold the glass in your hand for several minutes, then support it in the
 window sill and leave it there.

 "What happens now?" H.R. asks.

 "We wait. Captain McBrawn will be here any minute now." H.R. shrugs and
 stays silent.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 You wait, and wait, and wait. You pace the room from one end to the
 other again and again. Finally the light bulb flickers ominously and
 finally burns out completely.

 A dreadful darkness falls into the cell but it doesn't last long when
 the moon comes back from behind the clouds and lights the room with an
 eerie glow. You give a defeated sigh. H.R. gives you a melancholic
 look.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 A bit later you hear muffled sounds from the corridor. They seem to get
 louder and louder and you can make out screams and thuds and thumps.
 You glance hopefully at H.R. who grins and gives you a thumbs-up.

 *khaZAM!*

 The door practically EXPLODES inwards when the guard's unconscious body
 flies through it and bright light flows in the cell. You recognize the
 shadow of the man standing in the door frame.

 Yes. It is Captain McBrawn.

 "Fear NOT! For I, Captain McBrawn, am here!" He comes in and stands
 tall in front of you, hands by his waist and holding his sculpture-like
 chin high. "Let us leave this dreadful place!"

 You lower your head. "I have to confess... You told me to go find the
 President. I didn't get there. The Screaming Communists captured me
 right away and I failed the mission." The Captain laughs warmly. "Do
 not worry! I foiled their evil plot with little trouble and came
 looking for you. The searchlight was very clever of you."

 "Well, I had some help..." you say and point at H.R. - but it's gone.
 You're almost sure you see the tip of its tail disappearing in the
 ventilation duct. The Captain isn't paying much attention. "Let's go
 home," he says.

 You step over the knocked-out guard and leave.

 "So... you're a guard, huh? How's that working for you?"

 The eyes behind the door squint. "Are you COMING ON TO ME?"

 "OK THEN," the guard roars.

>ask guard about guard
 "So... you're a guard, huh? How's that working for you?"

 The eyes behind the door squint. "Are you COMING ON TO ME?"

 "Don't you know who I am!?" you demand.
 "NO," the guard replies.

 "Well... uh... I'm Scotty," you say.

>ask guard about captain
 (the photograph)
 "You should better let me go peacefully before it's too late! This here
 is Captain McBrawn and he'll be coming to rescue me and then you will
 be in big trouble!"

 "OOH, I'M TREMBLING," the guard shouts.

>ask guard about escape
 "I'm going to break out and save the President!"

 "HA! I SPIT at your PRESIDENT!" the guard yells.

>spit at guard
 That command is too complex; you might want to try to just spit.

 "I'm going to break out and save the President!"

 "HA! I SPIT at your PRESIDENT!" the guard yells.

 What do you want to ask the guard about: the encyclopedia, or the Jack
 Mills novel?

>ask guard about encyclopedia
 "I do not UNDERSTAND you!" the guard shouts.

>ask guard about novel
 "WHAT?" the guard shouts.

>examine novel
 There's no such thing here now.

>ask hr about jack mills
 "I guess that was all," you say to the guard before talking to H.R.
 "ALL RIGHT THEN," the guard yells and slides the eyehole shut.

 "Oh, you have other books too?" you ask.

 "Yeah, but you wouldn't like this one. It doesn't have any pictures,"
 H.R. says.

>show encyclopedia to hr
 One page comes off the encyclopedia and flutters on the floor.

 "Can I have something else instead?" you carefully ask. "Not enough
 pictures, eh? Well, I'll trade it in but I can't give you anything as
 nice this time. Let's see... an orange garden hose... no... an electric
 mixer... hmm... This'll do."

 It gives you a can of motor oil.

>examine oil
 The can contains motor oil, meant to reduce friction of moving parts.

>put oil on me
 That would surely ruin your clothes. Mom would never get the oil out.

 "Your mom is so ugly they moved Halloween to her birthday," H.R. says.

 "That's just so not cool!" you cry.

>remove clothes
 You strip naked.

 "Oh for crying out loud!" H.R. yells. "That's really not something I
 would have wanted to see."

>put oil on me
 You pour the oil on you and douse yourself with it. Every inch of
 yourself. Every drop of the oil gets used. The result is one slick and
 slippery Scotty.

 "My eyes! Is there no mercy for my poor retinas?" H.R. cries.

>enter vent
 The motor oil covers your body like sweat on a hot summer night. You
 slither inside the air duct and pull yourself deeper and deeper inside.
 Darkness and cold aluminum encloses you from all sides as you twist and
 turn through the tunnels. Finally there's some light looming from ahead
 and you slide faster toward it.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 Just before you reach the end of the duct a dark shape blocks the light
 and you're back in near darkness. You force yourself to a halt and
 stare the figure in the eyes.

 "Hey, it's H.R.! What are you doing here?" you ask but the creature
 doesn't reply. It opens its mouth, and the second, and the third. And
 it hisses.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 You back away in record speed and drop down the grate back to the cell.

 "I see you met my -cousin Herbert-," H.R. assumes. "Now please put some
 clothes on!"

>examine me
 You are Scotty, Captain McBrawn's short and a bit round sidekick. You
 have followed him on his adventures and helped him mostly by staying
 out of his way, but now you have a mission of your own.

 You are carrying a makeshift flashlight, a photograph, some nail
 scissors, some iron bars, and a dinner plate and wearing nothing.

 Also, your adventuring clothes and a flux capacitor are on the floor.

>wear clothes
 (first taking the adventuring clothes)
 You put your clothes on.

 "I and my eyes thank you, good sir," H.R. says.

>examine grate
 The aluminum air duct runs from one wall to another. It's quite large
 but not set very high, just few centimeters above your head. There's a
 small opened grate in the bottom of it.

>ask hr about cousin
 "Wait, you knew there was a monster in the air ducts?" you cry. "Sure.
 It's cousin Herbert, hired by the -Screaming Communists- to keep the
 vents safe," H.R. says.

 "Then why didn't you say anything before I went in there!?"
 H.R. shrugs. "I thought Herbie might have been hungry."

>ask hr about herbert
 "Wait, you knew there was a monster in the air ducts?" you cry. "Sure.
 It's cousin Herbert, hired by the Screaming Communists to keep the

 "Then why didn't you say anything before I went in there!?"
 H.R. shrugs. "I thought Herbie might have been hungry."

>ask hr about screaming
 (the Screaming Communists)
 "What do you think of the Screaming Communists?" you ask H.R..

 "They're a bit loud for my tastes. And they're not the ideal business
 partners, either. They tend to rather shoot you and take your stuff
 instead of trading."

>take grate
 That is not something you would carry around.

 H.R. yawns.

>inventory
 You are carrying a photograph and wearing your adventuring clothes.

 Also, a dinner plate, some iron bars, some nail scissors, a makeshift
 flashlight, and a flux capacitor are on the floor.

>examine photograph
 It's a silhouette of Captain McBrawn cut from a photograph.

>show scissors to hr
 "Thanks, but I don't need this anymore."

 "What am I, a library?" the creature snaps. "Very well, I'll trade it
 in. Let's see... a battering ram... no... some deck chairs from the
 Titanic... hmm... Oh, I don't know what this is so maybe you can have
 it then."

 H.R. throws you a small vial.

>examine vial
 The glass vial is very small and delicate. There's some purple liquid
 inside it and the words "DRINK ME" written on it with beautiful
 cursive.

 H.R. scratches its head.

>drink vial
 You take a sip from the vial. It has a very faint taste, something
 flowery, but you can't quite put your finger on it. Then suddenly the
 vial starts to get larger and larger; your clothes seem to grow bigger
 and the walls and the ceiling seem to move further apart from each
 other.

 You climb out from under your clothes that are now too huge to wear.
 The cell and everything in it seems to have grown at least tenfold.
 H.R. is a towering monster far away.

 "Or could it be that you have just shrunk a lot smaller?" the creature
 booms.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 Very soon you find out that the effect doesn't last very long: you
 stretch back to your original size.

>score
 You have escaped six times:
  - by unscrewing the hinges on the door
  - by unlocking the door through the hole
  - by climbing through the window
  - by opening the cell door with the sticker
  - by bribing the guard with whiskey
  - by sliding inside the air duct

 "Impressive. Now, to escape without getting caught..." H.R. muses.

 The rectangle on the cell door slides open and a pair of beady eyes
 appear behind it. "WHAT is all this RACKET?" a loud voice behind the
 door says. After a short pause the voice goes: "Why you... ARE YOU

 "What does it actually mean being a Screaming Communist?"

 "You get to SCREAM! And THREATEN PEOPLE! By SCREAMING! AND I LIKE IT!"
 he replies.

>shout at guard
 "WHAT?" the guard yells.

>attach wire to door
 You make sure the wire is securely inside the keyhole.

>drink vial
 You take a sip from the vial and the world starts to grow smaller and
 smaller. Very soon you are so small you can't see the guard's eyes
 anymore - and apparently he can't see you either.

 "NOW WHERE did you GO!?" the guard yells. "OH BUGGER, I'm going to GET
 FLOGGED if I let him ESCAPE!"

 He opens the door and peeks inside. "HEY! WHERE DID YOU GO!" You take
 advantage of the situation and start running through the door.

 You run and run and run for what feels like eternity. Then the potion's
 effect starts to wear out and you grow quickly to your normal size. You
 managed to cover almost two meters from the door. Running with legs the
 size of a toothpick doesn't get one very far. You stand there, naked,
 grinning to the guard who leaps at you and throws you back inside.

 "Impressive. Now, to escape without getting caught..." H.R. muses.

>look
 The cell walls are of gray stone and a small barred window leads
 outside to freedom. A silvery air vent runs right above the window. The
 light bulb illuminates the cell.

 There's an open trapdoor on the floor.

 The creature wags its tail slowly from side to side.

 On the floor are your adventuring clothes, a photograph, a dinner
 plate, some iron bars, a makeshift flashlight, an article, and a flux
 capacitor.

 FLASHLIGHT

 A flashlight is an essential tool in any dark or low-light environment.
 It is a device that consists of a lamp inside a parable-shaped casing
 surrounded by a reflective surface to focus the light to a single
 direction.

 Flashlights can been used as communication devices, typically by
 flashing the light in pre-agreed sequences. There are documented
 cases[citation needed] of using a flashlight or a searchlight as a
 signalling device by attaching a template in front of the light source
 to create shapes in the surface the light is pointed at.

 faint trace of smoke.

>show wire to hr

 H.R. spasms and blinks white light for a while. Trails of smoke rise
 from its body.

 "Careful with that!

 The small switch on the trapdoor has been pushed to one side.

>push switch
 It won't go any further.

 "How curious," you muse. H.R. raises the spot above its eye where
 people usually have eyebrows.

 The flux capacitor has a window on one side where you can see some
 tubes in Y shape inside. Red labels are pasted all over the device, the
 one on top saying "FLUX CAPACITOR". The two dials are labeled "POWER"
 and "SPEED" and there's a pin with a picture of a lightning bolt next
 to it. It is very heavy.

 The tubes inside are blinking bright white light and the device hums
 silently.

 The guard eyes you through the eyehole.

 H.R. stands there next to a large burlap sack.

 On the floor are a flux capacitor, a dinner plate, a tin foil (in which
 is a light bulb), a drinking glass, your adventuring clothes, a
 photograph, and some iron bars.

>go down
 Better not to try that while the guard is watching.

>wait
 You wait for a while.

 The guard grunts and closes the eyehole.

>go down
 You jump down the trapdoor and find yourself back in the cell. Since
 the trapdoor is in the middle of the room, you fall through it again.
 And again. And again.

 "Uh.. A little help here?" you ask after falling for some while. The
 surroundings are just one big blur and it's giving you a headache. "Oh,
 all right, you big baby," the creature says and shuffles towards the
 trapdoor. It flips the switch and the trapdoor slides to one side.

 Your fall comes to an abrupt end as you smash on the floor. "Owee," you
 cry and climb on your feet.

>push switch
 It won't go any further.

>pull switch
 The trapdoor slides to the middle of the room.

 The numbness on your tongue subsides and some sense returns to it.

>get capacitor
 You lift the flux capacitor to your arms.

>go down
 You jump down the trapdoor holding the flux capacitor.
 The speed dial's needle on the flux capacitor approaches the 88 mph
 mark quickly as you fall faster and faster. Colorful sparks fly to the
 air from the device and when it reaches the mark, there's a blinding
 bright flash of white light.

 You crash on the floor. Or, rather, ground - the stone floor is gone.
 Along with the rest of the castle.

 This is definitely the same place. You recognize the surroundings as
 the same, but there's nothing but some construction materials lying
 around.

 Dark clouds are gathering above.

 A lightning bolt strikes the flux capacitor and there's another bright

 lips usually are.

 "I don't need this anymore."

 H.R. sighs. "Of course you don't need it anymore, it's a funking
 smoldering piece of twisted metal after you got your hands to it!" It
 yanks the thing from your hands. "I'll get you something, but just so
 you'll know I'm not happy about this. I have mouths to feed! Let's
 see... a teleporter... no... an Internet... hmm... Aha, this just takes
 up room."

 The creature pulls out an improbably large structure of wood and metal.
 It's many times larger than the sack. "I guess I did have a -trebuchet-
 there!"

>ask hr about trebuchet

 "What is that and how am I supposed to use it?"

 "It's a tre-bu-chet. You use it to storm castles." It sees the empty
 look in your face and sighs. "Ok, I think I have a manual here
 somewhere." It puts its hand in the sack and pulls out a leaflet which
 it hands to you.

 That verb is not available.

 It's a manual leaflet for operating the trebuchet.

>read it
 "Thank you for purchasing a WallBreaker(tm) catapult! You are now the
 proud owner of a finest piece of modern medieval siege equipment.

 To operate your WallBreaker(tm) catapult:
  1) load the mechanism by turning the winch until the arm has come all
 the way down.
  2) insert ammunition (sold separately) on the cup located at the end
 of the arm.
  3) pull the lever.
  4) repeat until the enemy's defensive structures have fallen.
  5) storm the castle with your army."

>turn winch
 The winch is missing its handles. You can't get a good grip.

 You can't attach them together.

 The catapult is a huge wooden structure on four cracked and worn
 wheels. There's a lever on the side and a mechanism that is apparently
 meant to throw objects at a great distance.

>examine mechanism
 What do you want to examine: the catapult, or the winch?

>attach bars to trebuchet
 You can't attach them together.

>examine winch
 A round wooden disc connects to the machinery with an axle, where it
 winds the mechanism. It seems to be missing its handles. There are just
 holes in regular intervals around the rim of the disc.

>put bars in holes

 You insert the bars into the holes in the winch. They fit perfectly.

 "Isn't that just convenient," H.R. remarks.

>turn winch
 You turn the winch with all your might and the catapult's mechanism
 screams and wails as the arm tensions and lowers down.

>enter trebuchet
 That's not something you can enter.

 That's not something you can sit down on.

 H.R. burps and covers its mouth with its hand. "Sorry. Had Mexicans for

 You wedge the plate into the catapult's arm. It looks like it should

 The catapult's arm snaps forward with tremendous force and stops
 abruptly at the highest peak.

 "Whee," H.R. says.

>undo

 Due to some mysterious bump in time-space continuum, you find yourself
 in the exact situation you were just a minute ago.

 H.R. digs a portable karaoke set from its bag and sings: "If I could
 turn back time..." It then puts the machine back in the bag.

 You climb on the dinner plate and ponder the situation. "Let's see... I
 need something heavy to bring down the wall. Something heavy and
 large..."

 You hear H.R. whirr and click with its mouth. "I wonder what this
 does," it says.

 You glance down and see that it fiddles with the catapult's release
 lever. "Don't..." you have time to say before it yanks the lever fully
 back.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 "YYYAAAAEEEOOUU" *crash*


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 You have only a faint recollection of what happens next: there seems to
 be a lot of screaming and hassle around you. And sharp pain, well,
 everywhere. Eventually you find yourself back in the cell, still a bit
 dazzled.

 "Wow, that was spectacular," H.R. says. "You brought almost the entire
 wall down. Too bad you weren't conscious enough to make much use of the
 situation."

 "The Screaming Communists on the other hand were very efficient. They
 built the wall again and removed the catapult to prevent any further
 'accidents'," it continues.

>score
 You have escaped nine times:
  - by unscrewing the hinges on the door
  - by unlocking the door through the hole
  - by climbing through the window
  - by opening the cell door with the sticker
  - by bribing the guard with whiskey
  - by sliding inside the air duct
  - by cheating the guard by becoming tiny
  - by travelling through time
  - by catapulting yourself through the wall

 "Impressive. Now, to escape without getting caught..." H.R. muses.

>inventory
 You are carrying a manual and an article and wearing nothing.

 Also, a tin foil (in which is a light bulb), a drinking glass, your
 adventuring clothes, and a photograph are on the floor.

>show manual to hr
 "No thanks," the creature says.

>take foil
 Taken.

>put foil in glass
 You put the tin foil with the light bulb inside into the glass and
 straighten the foil against the glass walls. The foil concentrates the
 light into a bright beam of light.

>attach wire to door
 You tuck the live end of the wire into the keyhole.

>put silhouette on glass
 (first taking the photograph)
 You put Captain McBrawn's silhouette on top of the drinking glass.

 The beam of light emitting from the drinking glass casts a shadow on
 the wall shaped like the Captain.

>point flashlight at window
 Captain McBrawn's silhouette reflects clearly to the clouds above. You
 hold the glass in your hand for several minutes, then support it in the
 window sill and leave it there.

 "What happens now?" H.R. asks. "Is this the cue for you to put on your
 clothes?"

 "No! We wait. Captain McBrawn will be here any minute now." H.R. shrugs
 and stays silent.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 You wait, and wait, and wait. You pace the room from one end to the
 other again and again. Finally the light bulb flickers ominously and
 finally burns out completely.

 A dreadful darkness falls into the cell but it doesn't last long when
 the moon comes back from behind the clouds and lights the room with an
 eerie glow. You give a defeated sigh. H.R. gives you a melancholic
 look.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 A bit later you hear muffled sounds from the corridor. They seem to get
 louder and louder and you can make out screams and thuds and thumps.
 You glance hopefully at H.R. who grins and gives you a thumbs-up.

 *khaZAM!*

 The door practically EXPLODES inwards when the guard's unconscious body
 flies through it and bright light flows in the cell. You recognize the
 shadow of the man standing in the door frame.

 Yes. It is Captain McBrawn.

 "Fear NOT! For I, Captain McBrawn, am here!" He comes in and stands
 tall in front of you, hands by his waist and holding his sculpture-like
 chin high. "Let us leave this dreadful place!"

 You lower your head. "I have to confess... You told me to go find the
 President. I didn't get there. The Screaming Communists captured me
 right away and I failed the mission." The Captain laughs warmly. "Do
 not worry! I foiled their evil plot with little trouble and came
 looking for you. The searchlight was very clever of you."

 "Well, I had some help..." you say and point at H.R. - but it's gone.
 You're almost sure you see the tip of its tail disappearing in the
 ventilation duct. The Captain isn't paying much attention. "Let's go
 home," he says.

 You step over the knocked-out guard and leave.



     *** You have escaped ***

>look
 The cell walls are of gray stone and a small barred window leads
 outside to freedom. A silvery air vent runs right above the window. A
 light bulb hangs from the ceiling illuminating the cell.

 There's a closed trapdoor on the floor.

 H.R. waves at you.

 On the floor are some iron bars, a flux capacitor, and some glue
 remover.

>inventory
 You are carrying a drinking glass, an encyclopedia (in which is a
 whiskey bottle), and a photograph and wearing your adventuring clothes.

 Also, a flux capacitor and some glue remover are on the floor.

>attach wire to door
 (ktonk)

 (first trying to take electrical wire)
 "I warned you!" you yell and pull the bulb as hard as you can. The wire
 snaps and you're left with a bulb attached to nothing but its socket.

 Miraculously enough the bulb is still lit even when it's not connected
 to anything. "Hmm," H.R. muses.

>attach wire to door
 You tuck the live end of the wire into the keyhole.

 "Aww, that's just nasty," H.R. says.

>take whiskey
 Taken.

>scream
 The rectangle on the cell door slides open and a pair of beady eyes
 appear behind it. "WHAT is all this RACKET?" a loud voice behind the
 door says.

>show whiskey to guard
 "Would you be interested in a... little drink?" you say and dangle the
 bottle in front of the eyehole. "Uh, is that MEISTERJ?GER? I most
 certainly SHOULD NOT... Maybe a little bit, JUST TO KEEP ME WARM ...
 JUST SLIP it through the HOLE, will you?" "It won't fit through," you
 remark. "I must open the door... But KEEP IT QUIET, WILL YOU?"

 There's a click from the keyhole and the door opens slightly. You slip
 the bottle to the guard who snatches it from your hand and slams the
 door shut. In his excitement he doesn't remember to lock the door! You
 wait for a moment and open it very carefully.

 The guard is enjoying his prize and doesn't notice you slipping through
 the door. You navigate through the castle corridors until you stop
 behind a door where you hear conversation behind it.

 "DID YOU HEAR that FEDOR has found a BOTTLE OF MEISTERJ?GER?" a voice
 yells.

 "Meisterj?ger? AND HE'S NOT SHARING?" another voice shouts. Several
 other voices murmur in unison. It gets harder to hear, but it seems
 they all decide to pay a visit to Fedor and his bottle. By the time
 you've deduced this, the door opens and twenty Screaming Communists
 march out.

 "FEDOR, you OLD DRUNK we've come to DRINK FOR YOUR HEALTH and we've
 BROUGHT YOU A PRESENT," they shout as they shove you to his lap.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 "ALL RIGHT, IN WE GO," Fedor shouts and inserts a key in the cell door
 lock.

 *kZAP*

 He gets a hefty shock from the keyhole, releasing you from his grip.
 You bolt away - but bump into the other guards. "FORGOT US, did you?
 STOP SPASMING FEDOR and do your JOB!"


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 The sounds of the Screaming Communists gradually die out when the
 bottle is finally empty and you're back in the cell with H.R.

 "Welcome back," it says.

>score
 You have escaped five times:
  - by unscrewing the hinges on the door
  - by unlocking the door through the hole

 starts turning the key in the lock and shouts: "Your DINNER IS..."

 *kZap*

 The electrical wire gives a good shock to the guard and he flies
 backwards to the opposite wall. You go see if the door opened - and it
 did! You take off into the corridors.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 After wandering around the castle for some while you realize you have
 no idea where you are. The corridors and staircases create a maze where
 you just can't know where you're going.

 You turn around a corner and bump into the guard who is still a bit
 dazed. He reacts quickly now and grabs a hold of you. "And STAY THERE!"
 he shouts when he throws you back in the cell.

 A plate with a tin foil bundle on it has been left in the cell.

 "Dunno about that," H.R. says.

 "What is this place anyhow? Where are we?"

 "This is Castle Schweinehund," H.R. tells you. "Story goes that the
 previous owners built it on an ancient burial ground and used it to
 perform occultist rituals, opening portals to other worlds and so on.
 Sounds like old wives' tales to me," it says and runs its hand across
 its tail.

>ask hr about rituals

 Escapade! was an entry to the One Room Game Competition 2008 where it
 finished second out of seven games and was later nominated for three
 XYZZY awards.

 If you get stuck, there's a HINT command and a walkthrough included in
 a separate file. The hints and the walkthrough will cover only the
 minimum solution, so there will still be some optional puzzles you have
 to find the solution without help.

 The source code is distributed with the game. You can also download it
 from <A HREF=".">http://www.nitku.net/if/escapade/.</A> You are free to modify the game
 or use snippets from the code; see LICENSE for details.

 There's a good chance of a post-competition release. If you find bugs
 or you have other suggestions, please email me.
 I'm also interested in seeing transcripts of playthroughs.

 CREDITS

 The game was programmed with Inform 7 by Graham Nelson and others,
 using extensions by Eric Eve, David Fisher, Jon Ingold, Juhana
 Leinonen, Michael Martin, Andrew Owen, and Emily Short.

 And last but not least, a big thank you to the playtesters:
 Taleslinger, Mike Tarbert, Christian Moura, George Oliver, Jim Aikin,
 S. John Ross, and Roger Carbol. Thank you to everyone who later sent
 transcripts of their plays. This would have been a lesser game without
 your help.

 The cell walls are of gray stone and a small barred window leads
 outside to freedom. A silvery air vent runs right above the window. The
 light bulb illuminates the cell.

 There's an open trapdoor on the floor.

 The creature wags its tail slowly from side to side.

 On the floor are a dinner plate (on which is a tin foil), a flux
 capacitor, some iron bars, and a drinking glass.

 lightly," H.R. snaps.

 The adventuring clothes fall down the trapdoor and land back in front
 of you.

 Mmm. Mom has used the good fabric softener.

 "I hear your mom lost some weight so they changed her classification to
 dwarf planet," H.R. quips.

 "Hey! Don't talk like that about my mom!" you yell at it.

>eat clothes

>smell clothes

>search clotehs

>search clothes
 They are a pair of green pocketless pants and a gray wool sweater. Your
 adventuring clothes - that's what mom said when she bought them.
 They've turned out being not very well suited for the purpose though.
 They're very thick and a bit too big.

 "Your mom is so ugly they moved Halloween to her birthday," H.R. says.

 "That's just so not cool!" you cry.

 There are no care labels. Mom knows how to wash them even without.

 "Your mom is so poor her picture is on the food stamp," H.R. says.

 "Shut up, you... whatever you are," you snap at the thing.

>clean them
 They're clean enough.

>squeeze them
 They're all dry already.

 H.R. digs a paper tissue from its bag and tries to wipe some spit from
 around its mouth. The tissue sizzles and melts away leaving just a
 faint trace of smoke.

 "Your mom is so clumsy, when she falls down she misses the ground,"
 H.R. says.

 "Why are you being so mean," you cry.

>ask hr about mom
 "Yes, yes, run along now," H.R. says.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Darkness; below, percussion throbs softly. You shift from foot to foot,
 conscious of too much open space around you.

 Ahead and on either side, the voice of the chorus rises; as they speak,
 the lights slowly go up.

 CHORUS:
 Now does the hour grow close; where feet lack time,
 And Spaniards rage before the Cockrel's gate,
 The condemned sinner, soul turned sick of vice,
 Shall craft before your eyes most unclean magics,
 Open him a gate to Hell's black womb,
 Release demons, and bid them convey
 Our heroes to fair France; there to signal
 Embattl'd men to a final desperate measure.
 The final act is begun; the play is in your hands.

 Stage (A German Forest)
 You are onstage, a wide expanse of blank floor facing onto darkness.
 Nestled behind a curtain's edge is the exit leading offstage.

 The backdrop features an unconvincing painting of pine-covered
 mountains and a dark, ominous sky in which a double-headed eagle is
 carrying off a schnitzel.

>examine eagle
 The backdrop features an unconvincing painting of pine-covered
 mountains and a dark, ominous sky in which a double-headed eagle is
 carrying off a schnitzel.

 CHORUS:
 The hour draws close when France shall rise or fall;
 The board writhes to last moves; alone, each piece is lost.
 Each has emerged, as we've shown by our Art;
 Our three are gathered: each must fill their part.

 High above a forested peak, a proud double-headed eagle is carrying off
 its natural prey, the schnitzel. Such unspeakable grandeur, such
 natural beauty, such cack-handed brushwork.

>bs

 Backstage
 A room of indefinite size, hemmed in with high curtains, hanging ropes,
 and cluttered with wardrobes and make-up tables. Various props lie
 scattered about the room. Through the curtains, an entrance leads
 onstage.

 On one wall, someone has hung a flyer.

 [ To go back onstage, type 'onstage' or simply 'os' ]

 You can see a cloth, a petticoat, a stick and a board here.

>examine flyer
 A flyer is plastered across one wall:

 ____________________________________________________


          THE ROYAL DE L'ENTAILLE SOCIETY

                      presents

         *** WITHIN A WREATH OF DEWDROPS ***

   * JOHN  ACTOR as MAURICE  *  EVA ZAHA as ELISE *

   * and DUSTIN Q. CELEBRITY as THE WIZARD MCFAUD *

 ____________________________________________________

 At the center of the advertisement is a dramatic painting of a
 rapier-waving hero and a heaving-bodiced heroine, with a city on fire
 behind them. It's all rather exciting, really.

>examine board
 A wooden board, roughly square and about two and a half feet to a side.
 A metal handle is affixed to the centre. It's been coated in dark
 varnish to make it look a bit less like balsawood.

>get all
 cloth: Taken.
 petticoat: Taken.
 stick: Taken.
 board: Taken.

>examine me
 You are currently out of character.

>examine cloth
 It's a rectangle of cloth, so worn-out from being dyed, bleached and
 redyed that you are no longer able to make out what its colour is. Over
 the years it has seen service as a loin cloth, a pirate's sail, a
 shroud, the ghost of Hamlet's father, and as a poorly-rendered special
 effect of falling leaves.

>examine script
 The chorus are an omniscient lot who remain out of sight but are always
 there to provide foreshadowing of things to come. Were it not for them,
 you would most certainly have forgotten to raise your tunic at the
 appropriate moment in The Stride of Hermes.

 Nestled behind a curtain's edge is the exit leading offstage.

 The backdrop features an unconvincing painting of pine-covered
 mountains and a dark, ominous sky in which a double-headed eagle is
 carrying off a schnitzel.

>wear all
 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>wear tunic
 You can't see any such thing.

>wear cloth
 Costume changes onstage? This is experimental theatre, but there are
 limits. It would perhaps be better to do that sort of thing backstage,
 so as not to break the illusion.

>bs

 Backstage
 A room of indefinite size, hemmed in with high curtains, hanging ropes,
 and cluttered with wardrobes and make-up tables. Various props lie
 scattered about the room. Through the curtains, an entrance leads
 onstage.

 On one wall, someone has hung a flyer.

>wear cloth
 You swirl the cloth around your shoulders like a cloak, tilt your chin
 upwards at an arrogant angle, and take a few strutting steps. After a
 brief moment of concentration, you feel properly in character.

 You are playing the part of Captain Maurice Orignaux, honourable dandy
 of the Paris City Guard. Equally capable of composing timeless sonnets
 on the spur of the moment or slitting a Tartar's nose in a tavern
 brawl, Maurice is generally considered to be Entaille's paradigmatic
 hero. Some critics have defined this paradigm as 'a two-dimensional
 pugilist in tight hose' but you have always considered Maurice a
 character of many contradictions and shades of subtlety, brought out
 most clearly in his banter with Carelio and Longuin in the famous
 oyster-eating scene.

>examine chorus
 The chorus are an omniscient lot who remain out of sight but are always
 there to provide foreshadowing of things to come. Were it not for them,
 you would most certainly have forgotten to raise your tunic at the
 appropriate moment in The Stride of Hermes.

>examine audience
 There may well be an audience out there, but you can't see them for the
 glare of the lights. Best to just assume that they're there, and that
 somewhere in their midst is a theatre critic who is watching you with a
 discerning eye.

>listen to chorus
 The chorus is tied to the script, but repeats its lines again, for your

 CHORUS:
 The hour draws close when France shall rise or fall;
 The board writhes to last moves; alone, each piece is lost.

>wear petticoat
 After a moment or two of hopping about, you work your way into the
 petticoat. Hunching your shoulders over, clawing your fingers and
 adopting a lecherous squint, you assume a new role.

>examine me
 You are playing the part of Herr Dr. Lysander Herculaneum Prufrock
 Gramercy McFaud, German theological scholar and on first-names terms
 with the Prince of Darkness. Originally your scheme was to ensnare
 Elise, but the purity of her humble beauty laid a seed of doubt in your
 black heart that was brilliantly explored in a long and profound
 soliloquy at the close of Act IV. When Maurice appeared to rescue her,
 you could no longer stomach the vileness of your existence and, though
 doomed to Hell yourself, vowed to give aid to the heroes in an even
 longer and more profound soliloquy in the middle of Act V.

 You cut this staff from a blasted oak in a miserable October rainstorm,

 knife to transform it into a Beacon of the Nether Gate, an abomination
 before God whose very touch shrivels the humours. It also has a minor
 hex on it that facilitates cheating at polo.

 You are playing the part of Elise, a beautiful and chaste

 Gascon whore whose only significant achievement was inaccurately

 was much-given to careless research and intentional romanticising.

 Elise isn't given any songs in the original text, although there was a

 warblings for her, with titles like The Mistle-Thrush Sings In My Heart
 and Sweetest Fondness. Thankfully, these died out with the appearance
 of the theatre critic.

 The hour draws close when France shall rise or fall;
 The board writhes to last moves; alone, each piece is lost.
 Each has emerged, as we've shown by our Art;
 Our three are gathered: each must fill their part.

>go down
 As you step through the trapdoor, you sense movement in the inky black
 around you; you are descending into darkness, with nothing underfoot,
 but it feels as if wires are holding you up.

 Beneath the Stage in a Dark and Spooky Place
 You are surrounded by darkness; nothing underfoot and a tiny light far
 overhead. Something allows you to dangle in space; whenever you move,
 you feel slight upwards pressure on your joints, and feel yourself sway
 a little.

 A few feet from you, a wooden demon is hanging limply from his wires.

>examine demon
 At the very sight of the demon's hideous features, you are overcome by
 the frailties of your sex and execute a commendable swoon. However, you
 then take in a detail which gives you pause: the poor ickle thing has a
 sandbag tied to its ankle.

 You poke and jab ineffectually at the sandbag to no avail.

 The sandbag is tethered securely to the demon's ankle, just out of
 reach. You kick and swipe feebly, but to no avail.

>examine ankle
 You can't see any such thing.

>remove coat
 It's a little difficult to attempt anything as involved as that when
 you're hanging here.

>bs
 You attempt to go in another direction, but since you don't have any
 purchase on anything, this proves impractical. Looks like your best bet
 is to go up.

>u. bs
 You flail ineffectually at thin air. Although this does little, an
 upward force at the top of your head seems to pull you upwards, back
 toward the light.

 You can't quite manage to take it, but it looks as though you might be
 able to cut it free with your sword.

>cut it
 With one swing of your blade, the rope is cut and the sandbag drops
 away into empty darkness. The demon creakily shakes its leg.

 MAURICE:
 Now I have honour, and thee, releas't,
 Put up thy sword, most naughty beast!

 The demon swivels to face you, as if to respond; its lower jaw clatters
 up and down. The only sound is of clacking wood and creaking wires.
 Then it reaches above its head, clumsily selects a particular wire, and
 yanks forcefully on it. You immediately find yourself being hauled
 upwards...

 third-rate blank verse.


 BIKHRIR:
 Why summons't thou me to this most bleak land,
 Where men are virtuous and sausages plentiful?

 MCFAUD:
 Did I not with thy master make of it a compact,
 Binding your service to my hand's desire,
 And can I not discard this if I will?

 BIKHRIR:
 No;
 It is signed, Lysander,
 In the gore of your damned carcass.

 MCFAUD:
 Then let my doom provide another's hope,
 And at once to Paris these my friends convey.


 Bikrir, grumbling loudly, stomps to the backdrop and, making a magic
 pass, extracts a paint-bucket and brush. In a few moments, he has
 coated the entire surface in a completely different talentless daub,
 and springs back down the trapdoor.

 A second burst of dry ice signals his disappearance (and, incidentally,
 that of the trapdoor also).

 and cluttered with wardrobes and make-up tables. Various props lie
 scattered about the room. Through the curtains, an entrance leads
 onstage.

 On one wall, someone has hung a flyer.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a sword
   a petticoat
   a cloak (being worn)

>remove cloak
 You unfurl the cloth from your shoulders, and let yourself relax.

>tie cloth to stick
 You carefully knot the corners of the cloth around the stick. It now
 makes a passable flag.

>wear petticoat
 After a moment or two of hopping about, you work your way into the
 petticoat. Concentrating, you stick your chest out, stand contrapposto
 and bat your eyelashes. You're now in character.

 Stage (The Walls of Paris)
 You are onstage, a wide expanse of blank floor facing onto darkness.
 Nestled behind a curtain's edge is the exit leading offstage.

 The backdrop features a hastily-rendered painting of a medieval town,
 complete with the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Elysses, a vineyard and
 Gerard Depardieu as an onion-selling cyclist. In the distance, the
 flags of the invading Spanish wave menacingly.

>wave flag
 Assuming a dynamic stance, feet wide and shoulders square, you raise
 the flag above your head (music swells in the orchestra pit) and begin
 to sweep it about vigorously. A murmur slowly rises from the chorus,
 and then the stage is swamped with armoured extras and dodgy swordplay.

 The choreography has you standing around waving the flag in the middle
 of this for the better part of four minutes. Eventually, arms aching
 and throat sore, you stagger offstage as the narrator delivers the
 closing speech.
