 The Song of the Universe envelops you, pulsing through you in the
 otherworldly aether. You sing, sing, sing the song of ancients, of the
 unending, of all to come and be. Your semi-aqueous body kneads upon
 itself, in time to the rhythm: Spread, then fold, spread, then fold.
 The Universe echoes infinitely your leitmotif: Erupt, engulf, erupt,
 engulf.

 <span class="floydstyle em">White: </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Bliss.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Bliss.</span>A physical jolt momentarily tears you apart from the
 Song, grounds you in the physical world. For a moment all you can see
 is the crystal Cellarium, perfectly sized to house your viscous body.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Grey: Tedium. Boredom.</span> You immediately launch yourself back
 into the Song.
 The disturbance returns. Then another, and another. The rhythm is
 interrupted. Your connection to the Universe fades. The jostling gives
 way to a slow but steady movement. Kidnapped. Stolen. Abused. Lifted?
 Out of the trench. The bathymetric pressure change burns; the walls of
 your home become now painfully entombing. Hoisted, sloshed,
 disoriented, finally: dropped.

 After a time, you sense them, surrounding your Cellarium. The Others,
 the Blind Ones. You've heard of their kind. They ooze yellow:
 <span class="floydstyle em">Curiosity. Excitement.</span> They do not sense you inside. You are
 safe. Their meat-tongues eke out disgusting, shrill noises. With
 horrified fascination, you realize that they are singing: faint colors
 in a pathetic shadow of the real Song. You easily parse their
 meanings.

 "...locals could have created it?....formation is natural at that
 level....wet lab for testing...."

 While the Others' outside stutterings are disturbing, your Cellarium
 has come to a rest, and the Song beckons you... to once again sing and
 dance. Perhaps, despite the abduction, you still can.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Cellarium</span>
 A white, crystalline Ancient structure that perfectly houses you. The
 muffled voices swirl yellow and green: intrigue and excitement as they
 staccato to each other.

>examine me

 A physical, gelatenous body. One of the Ancients, the Eternals: The
 Aqueosity.

>inventory

 This body cannot carry things.

>sing

 You launch yourself back into the bliss, the harmony, the rhythm. From
 up here, it feels different, but still welcoming. Away fades the
 physical world: the Cellarium, the room, the muffled voices and their
 primitive colors. Replaced with the resplendent Song of the Universe.
 But something unexpected is here. There are other Blind Ones,
 different humans. Sleepers, drifters, each one alone in disharmony,
 singing a selfish song of apathetic deafness, rejoicing in their
 discordance. You can't truly connect while they sing so jarring, but
 you could help them, help the sleepers. They deserve to Sing too.

>sing

 You cannot Sing properly while surrounded by such disharmony. The
 sleepers, they sing disjointed and pathetic. There must be a way to
 help them.

>examine sleepers

 All pluck out their own primitive, discordant tune, not even creating
 a passable solo melody. It is soul-wrenching to witness. You cannot
 possibly enjoy your own beauty knowing such emotional poverty before
 you. Their strong connections to the physical world anchor them,
 prevent them from being able to Sing in true beauty.

>who am i

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Song</span>
 The Song of the Universe, with every creature dancing and coloring and
 sharing and exchanging in happiness and harmony. The sleepers drift
 and sing a primitive song. It is apathetic and selfish, and disrupts
 the harmony.


 They sing blind solos. Their connections to the physical prevent them
 from being able to harmonize with you.

>examine universe

 Every Ancient and animate in all of space and time, weaving together
 the beauty and majesty of cohesion. It sings white in immaculate
 beauty and perfection.

>harmonize

 (the primitive song)
 You're having trouble combining that (<span class="floydstyle em">the primitive song</span>)
 into a better state.

>examine song

 Random, off-tune, irregular beats, each one of them of a different
 style. It is a disgusting mess. They would be happier - everything
 would be better - if they were able to harmonize with the Universe
 properly, but their ties to the physical restrict them.


 They all sing the best that they are able, but their tethers to the
 physical prevent them from being able to sing, to tumble, to combine,
 to harmonize. So they sing Blindly, each their own self-absorbed tune.

>examine physical

 While you're in the Song, the tedium of the physical fades completely,
 and your Cellarium is one of those physical objects.

>touch cellarium

 The Cellarium is the thing that allows you to ignore the physical
 world. You'd rather focus on being able to get back to singing, and
 that means helping these others sing as well.

>help others

 You untether them.
 <span class="floydstyle em">White.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Peace.</span>
 One by one, their melodies harmonize: they truly connect to one
 another in a strong and beautiful swelling of colors. You ignite with
 hope and pride. However, in the midst of your bliss-creating wake, you
 encounter one Drifter whose ties are oddly strung: He is one of the
 few Blind Ones who can Walk while Singing. He can see, understand,
 comprehend. He witnesses. Drifter starts to awaken. That must not
 happen: he will throw away his chance at happiness.


 While you're in the Song, the tedium of the physical fades completely,
 and your Cellarium is one of those physical objects.

 This Drifter has pushed himself nearly fully back into the physical.

>examine drifter

 His connection to this world is fading, quickly. His ties are pulling
 him back to the physical. It needs to be cut quickly before he is out
 of your grasp.

 The Drifter leaves the bliss, and you turn to your Singing. There is a
 great disturbance that you decide to investigate, but your Cellarium
 has been fastened shut and you are unable to escape it. The Blind Ones
 handle you some more - poking and prodding - but eventually, in a
 flurry of green excitement, they stick a rod in you, and leave you
 alone to sing. And you join in as best you can, but the rod is always
 there, a splinter nagging at you, preventing you from fully singing.
 But it is still lovely, and you join in as best you can.

>cut drifter

 Drifter attempts to flee you: lucid and aware, but still completely
 Blind. He does not know, does not understand: cutting the ties will
 grant him bliss. You will give him bliss.

 You manage to sever many of his ties, but his resistance has
 disappointingly ruined the process, and now he has trapped himself in
 a kind of limbo. Part of him in the physical world where you cannot
 influence. The resulting black and stabbing mess is incredibly painful
 to listen to. As he attempts to fully shove himself back into the
 other world, he screams a report of everything he senses there, on
 repeat.


 <span class="floydstyle em">...top bunk, snoring shipmates, bed, itchy sheets, top bunk,</span>

>help drifter

 His aura is roughly cleaved, but he has settled into a stable state.
 Any further influence would probably completely unbalance him.

 The Drifter pushes much of himself back into the physical, but some
 silent part of him still remains trapped in the flowing Song. His
 color dulls into a dim, staticy grey, his mind settles into
 resignation. He ceases reporting the physical. The silence is
 soothing, and once again you can fully devote yourself to the Song.

>sing
>sing

 You Sing and Fold: push apart, consume, push apart, consume again. You
 join into the music of the Universe, and relief overwhelms you as the
 Universe itself mirrors your motions. <span class="floydstyle em">White. Bliss...</span>

 You hear a faint black flurry from the physical. Then, a mechanical
 roar rips away the Universe, and you are snapped back into your
 aqueous body. Back to the Cellarium. To the physical. Everything is
 moving again. Not up, but away. Realization: they will never grant you
 peace. Determination: return yourself and your Cellarium to the proper
 place. But first, this unnatural movement must be stopped.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Cellarium</span>
 A white, crystalline Ancient structure that perfectly houses you. The
 muffled voices have left, and the surrounding room is empty.

 The human-place is just outside.


 You fold. Glimpses of white bliss tempt you, but they are too
 fleeting, and it feels somehow different. The Cellarium needs to be
 returned to its appointed place.

>out

 With great effort, you push the seamless lid off of your Cellarium as
 the dry air pricks at your tensing surface. You notice that everything
 is covered in faint traces of colors from the Blind Ones as you roll
 off the table and plop some distance to the ground. You sense
 colorless motion from somewhere else on this vessel. Something is
 pushing it, and that thing must be stopped.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Collection Room</span>
 A zoo, a macabre collection of stolen minerals and pilfered samples.
 They have been studying your home, your infinite junction. Would you
 be just another trophy -- their final trophy? Centered in the room is
 a large metal table with your opened Cellarium displayed prominently.

 The interstitial room is to the west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Interstitial Room</span>
 A long metallic hallway that seems to span the length of the vessel.
 Multiple openings into other rooms waft hints of their purpose, but
 most pressing is the unnatural movement to the southwest spurring this
 monstrosity away from your home.

 The drifting auras of humans call from the to the northwest and to the
 northeast. The collection room is to the east, and one small
 unexplored room is to the west. The pounding room is to the southwest,
 and a closed hatch is to the southeast. A set of stairs leads up to
 the rest of the ship.

>listen to humans

 You can't see any such thing.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pounding Room</span>
 The urgent apathy of this room is overwhelmingly confusing. A dead
 grey creature furiously pounds away: pushing the vessel at a
 deafeningly loud pace, yet desiring nothing, knowing nothing. The
 gigantic whirling, chewing machine fills the room with its deafening
 beat and blistering fever.

 The interstitial room is to the northeast.

>examine machine

 A gigantic dead beast, whirling and chewing, stoking flames that are
 smothered to normalcy by a cannula of cold pipes. The flow from the
 pipes is what keeps the whole system running.

>about

 <span class="floydstyle em">Coloratura</span> by Lynnea Glasser (formerly Lynnea Dally)

 The idea for <span class="floydstyle em">Coloratura</span> came from one of my favorite games
 growing up: <span class="floydstyle em">Titanic: Challenge of Discovery</span>. While exploring
 its undersea wrecks, I couldn't help but imagine what it might be like
 to find something terrible. When writing this game, I took advantage
 of the fact that the text-based medium gave a unique opportunity to
 tell the story from the creature's inhuman perspective, and had a lot
 of fun with different descriptions and new kinds of actions.

>sing to machine

 You sing of ritardando, of holds, of caesura. The unliving engine is
 completely Blind to any song.

>enter engine
>sing to pipes

 There are so many parts of the engine, many of them whirring and
 burning and dangerous. There must be a weak spot.

 The vessel's tempo increases steadily.


 You sing of ritardando, of holds, of caesura. The unliving pipes are
 completely Blind to any song.

>examine engine

 A gigantic dead beast, whirling and chewing, stoking flames that are
 smothered to normalcy by a cannula of cold pipes. The flow from the
 pipes is what keeps the whole system running.

>enter pipes

 The pipes are part of a closed system, but the device attached to them
 isn't.

 You ooze a small part of yourself through the slotted pores of the
 device. Your conductive body forms multi-directional currents that are
 simultaneously overwhelming and confusing to the machine. It sputters
 one final attempt at reconciling all the directions, beeps frantic
 red, then slows to grey before squeaking out. <span class="floydstyle em">Black. Sleep.</span>
 You retract yourself.

 The chewing stops. The pounding stops. The ocean drags the adrift
 vessel into a blessed ritardando. The Blind Ones approach, frantic and
 trampling. There is brief excitement in another nearby room, then back
 again in the interstitial room. Soon, they will be here.

>hide

 You cram yourself into an unnoticeable position.

 Two of the humans burst into the room. You vaguely recognize one as
 being in charge: Captain. She blasts streaks of uneasy orange with
 undertones of commanding violet. The other is much more nervous,
 corkscrewing tightly in red-orange folds. Obviously she is the beast's
 handler: Engineer. They searchingly clunk about the engine.

 They are much bigger than you expected, certainly much bigger than
 you. But they cannot be without empathy. You attempt to reach out to
 the Blind Ones, to ask them for help, to connect and communicate and
 sing in harmony, but the humans cannot hear. They cannot understand.
 None of them can, you realize. Their ignorance will make them
 dangerous; there must be a safe way to reach them.

>sing white

 <span class="floydstyle em">If you are trying to color something, please specify the target</span>

 Once again, you can see the colors of their pitiable Song of clashing
 teeth, mushing lips, and vibrating membranes - each note an emotional,
 simplistic, story. The dissonant dialogue is even more jarring this
 close, but you manage to keep pace. Engineer quickly smooths out into
 a rounded indigo. "... easy fix. A simple replacement."

 Captain continues to churn anxious orange, "We need to get them to a

 transponders. I need to know right now if I can trust you on this, or
 if I need to send out an S.O.S."

 Engineer solidifies, strong and sure.

 Captain churns further, folding over herself. <span class="floydstyle em">Indecision.</span>

 indigo and stubborn ultraviolet. In this delicate state, you could
 color her either way...

>color captain indigo

 You reach out, caressing Captain's delicate aura, willing it to become
 indigo. Her aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though they were
 her own emotions.

 Captain physically touches Engineer with a kind of emotional
 significance that is unreadable to you. "I trust you," she oozes in
 incepted indigos. "I'm going to go tell that medic that we may have a
 problem," she finalizes before turning away and heavily, humanly,
 limb-pushing down the passageway. Engineer exhales an unnecessary
 stream of air out her mouth, and swings her body and limited gaze to
 the machine.

 You Sing of aura-joinings, of unity, of perfect cohesion. Possessing a
 creature requires completely displacing its mind and will. In the
 Song, possession was a harmonic technique to create higher order and
 beauty, but these Blind Ones have no such inclinations, and completely
 resist your influence: it is difficult enough to even Color them.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Silenced Room</span>
 The gigantic machine fills the room with its silence. Engineer, in a
 cloud of focused and contented green, touches with the machine.
 The interstitial room is to the northeast.

 Engineer bubbles into a self-focused gleeful green as the machine
 resumes its apathetic, mindless life. The entirety of the vessel moves
 again... <span class="floydstyle em">away</span>. You warble in despair. You just need enough
 time so that you can figure out how you can communicate to them. You
 just need a break. You just need it to stop.

 Ending a melody is the most terrible thing you could do. Are you sure
 you want to attempt this?
>no

 You decide to focus on restoring your own song through more harmonious
 methods.

 front of her. You need a way to permanently destroy the engine. The
 cold pipes need be stoppered.

 You reach out, caressing Engineer's delicate aura, willing it to
 become blue. Her aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though they

 You spark a brief string of memories in Engineer, but she soon settles
 back into contented green. Your influence isn't very strong over her.
 There may be more value in things elsewhere.

>go northeast

 You emerge from your hiding spot.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Interstitial Room</span>
 A long metallic hallway that spans the length of the vessel. The Blind
 Ones left open a passageway to the southeast, you notice.
 The drifting auras of humans call from the to the northwest and to the
 northeast. The collection room is to the east, and one small
 unexplored room is to the west. The pounding room is to the southwest,
 and the open newly opened room is to the southeast. A set of stairs
 leads up to the rest of the ship.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pipe Room</span>
 The protector, the ameliorator, this is what keeps the dead beast
 calm. A simple set of connecting pipes steals heat from the engine,
 stores it in a tank of dead and artificial water, which is itself then
 soothed by a living water vat of pumped water, cooled with its own
 hose system.

 The interstitial room is to the northwest.

>disconnect pipes

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine pipes

 Metallic, hollowed bones, pumping hot and cold in a dead, apathetic
 constant rhythm.

>examine vat

 In a horrifically efficient system, water humming with life is sucked
 up via hoses into the heating chamber, burned clean of life, and then
 spit out back into the ocean. The soothing cold and songs of the ocean
 are consumed mindlessly.

 The vessel's tempo increases steadily.

>examine living water

 The water pulses within the pipes, tubes and cavities.

>sing to water

 it does nothing, only continues to repeat its given song and
 narrative.

>save

>enter tank

 The heated tank is part of a closed, piped system that you can't
 enter. The hoses that feed the vat, however, do seem fairly weak.

>enter hoses

 You can't enter them while they're whole, so you decide to fix that.
 In the system of hoses, the exhaust hose radiates furious heat, and so
 you focus your attention on the intake hose: colder, and safer. You
 surround the intake hose, and feel it crackle from inside you. As the
 plastic oxidizes, bubbles trickle through your aqueous body and cause
 small bursts in your surface tension with a sensation that is actually
 somewhat pleasant. In a sudden explosion of energy, a jet of living
 water bursts through one of the hoses, forcefully spraying you away
 from the chaos.

 The mechanics of the cooling vat thwarted, soon the entirety of the
 beast catches up with its parts and frictions to a halt. Living water
 continues to vomit uncontrollably from the ripped hose. You sense the
 handler approaching from the passageway, and you feel nervously
 conspicuous.

>hide

 You cram yourself into an unnoticeable position.

 Engineer peals yellow desperation as she searches the room. Not
 noticing you, she turns to the vomitous mouth and
 tendon-muscle-attends the seacock in a way that seals it. As she
 unfurls in green relief, you become aware of something strange: the
 bubbling hose sensation, but not from your body proper. A small fleck
 of your Aqueosity was sprayed on the exhaust pipe, and is eating
 through it. Suddenly, the other hose bursts in a high-registered hiss,
 expelling its contents onto Engineer. She warps maddened black,
 stabbing in every note of every octave, then moves to the floor in a
 writhing mass of altered flesh.

 However, if Engineer understood the splendor of the Universe...

 Captain enters, and her bubble of commanding violet melts into a
 horrified mess of orange. Medic follows nervously from behind, and
 examines all the meat-parts of the black, dissonant mess. Together,
 they transport Engineer up and away. You hope that her melody can be
 salvaged; it is a terrible thing for a Song to end, even one so
 simplistic and un-tuned.

 The faint colors swirl mixing into a confusing aurora of lingering

 prison sits quietly, while a heated prison vibrates to a swelteringly
 fast pace.

 The interstitial room is to the east, and a vent leads up.

>examine vent

 A rigid arteriole leading up.

>go up

 You press yourself up through the vent with reliance on friction and
 clever weight-shifting. As you approach the next room, fear freezes
 you. Above, you hear the hostile, vigilant bass of a Blind One. Her
 unfocused song sweeps the strange room above like sonar. This one
 would notice: she would see. You cautiously slide back down.

 A long metallic hallway that spans the length of the vessel.

 The drifting auras of humans call from the to the northwest and to the

 is to the west. The silenced room is to the southwest, and the open
 pipe room is to the southeast. A set of stairs leads up to the rest of
 the ship.

>go northwest

 It seems this is where the Drifter physically resided. His mind
 statics grey, and you can sense his fragmentation. You feel a desire
 to reach out to him, to fill his colorless void. However, a human
 moves freely about the room, trying halfway to connect and sing and
 understand with the drifters with mercy. She is close to succeeding,
 but something is holding her back.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A Sleeping Room</span>
 Rows upon rows of humans, unmoving on stacked shelves, deeply
 connected to the Universe, basking in its glory. A single Drifter
 sings silently with apathy and detachment.

 The interstitial room is to the southeast.

 The Mercy moves between the bodies, grasping out to them in an
 unbalanced orange horror. You realize that her Blindness prevents her
 from seeing their bliss, their perfect happiness.

>examine mercy

 A Blind One. Possibly a female?

 Her bright orange aura churns anxiously.

 The Mercy reaches out in faint grasps of curious yellow to one of the
 sleepers, but the instinct is too quickly overwhelmed by her orange
 repulsion: she is afraid of what the answer might be.

>color mercy yellow

 You reach out, caressing Mercy's delicate aura, willing it to become
 yellow. Her aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though they were
 her own emotions.

 The Mercy forcefully perks into yellow curiosity. She rapidly leaps
 disjunct from one sleeper to another, examining each thoroughly. She
 comes upon the Drifter and she senses, she realizes... her aura bursts
 red in panic.

>hide

 You cram yourself into an unnoticeable position.

 The Mercy reaches out to the grey, apathetic Drifter, pushing for
 colors, demanding notes. She is met by more grey, more static. He has
 lost too many connections, he cannot engage her. The Mercy offers part
 of her mind, her sanity to the drifter. He consumes it purposelessly,
 digesting the colored scales and chords and beats into a dull,
 arrhythmic static.

>color drifter blue

 You don't feel comfortable risking manipulating him while others are
 around.

 The Mercy once again sings to the Drifter, attempting to force a
 connection. To your surprise, the Mercy has an effect. The Drifter
 momentarily colors and connects, and swirls into a pattern other than
 the blank static. You didn't think that Blind Ones could be capable of
 connecting on such a level. "Oh God, your eyes are moving, you're
 awake. Just wait right there, I... I'm going to go get the medic. And
 the captain. They'll know what to do." Mercy self-consumes in revolted
 orange and immolating red panic as she muscle-tendon-bone moves. You
 feel her aura leave and return with others.

>color drifter white

 You don't feel comfortable risking manipulating him while others are
 around.

 Medic and Mercy follow the room-swelling Captain, "...delay may still
 be necessary..." she drones. But Medic pricks demanding infrared, "I
 know how expensive and bad rescues look. But this shit that's going
 on? Severe burns, unresponsiveness, potential paralysis? We need to
 take care of this." The Mercy holds an anxious caesura as she examines
 Drifter. They all three wobble in instability.

>color medic yellow

 You reach out, caressing Medic's delicate aura, willing it to become
 yellow. Her aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though they were
 her own emotions.

 Medic racks through possibilities, "There's nothing I know of that
 could have caused this. It's that thing: the cube. It's poisoning
 them." But Captain asserts ultraviolet, "Do you want to end up like
 those astronauts who 'saw' the alien?" Mercy chimes calming blue, "I
 examined it. It's got a weird shape, but it's just a plain crystal."

>possess drifter

 You don't feel comfortable risking manipulating him while others are
 around.

 Medic meeks hesitant, but annoyingly persists, "Even if we don't find
 something... I just want to look at it." Mercy chimes agreeable blue,
 "There can't be any harm in that," and Captain relents, "Sure. We'll
 go check it out." Captain, Medic and Mercy drift into the passageway.
 Finally, you are alone with Drifter. You wonder if he can be colored
 again.

>possess drifter

 He has so little will over his body, you feel it would be easy to push
 him out and control the flesh. But upon severing his connections, he
 lost his link to the other world. There is nowhere to push him to, and
 he'd remain in steadfast control of his body.

>color drifter white

 Creating pure bliss in someone else is a feat too difficult for you.

>color drifter blue

 You reach out, caressing the Drifter's delicate aura, willing it to
 become blue. His aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though they
 were his own emotions.

 The Drifter recalls fleeting harmonies of blue love and kinship. But
 again, as soon as you remove your influence, he drifts back towards
 grey. His mind refuses to coagulate its rhythm correctly.

>coagulae drifter's mind

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>coagulate drifter's mind

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>color drifter yellow

 You reach out, caressing the Drifter's delicate aura, willing it to
 become yellow. His aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though
 they were his own emotions.

 The Drifter trills unending queries of curious yellow. He falls back
 to grey. In despair, you push and pull again, more forcefully. But it
 does nothing. His mind is gone. Perhaps one day, with time, he can
 repair himself. But you can do nothing for him now, except grant him
 fleeting glimpses of memories and feelings he used to enjoy.

>sing to drifter

 His connection to this reality is too unstable to properly engage in
 harmony.

>color drifter green

 You reach out, caressing the Drifter's delicate aura, willing it to
 become green. His aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though
 they were his own emotions.

 The Drifter settles into contentment of enjoying green as happier
 memories dominate his mind. Then nothing. Grey. Even though the
 emotional connection is brief, feeling something -<span class="floydstyle em">anything</span>-
 seems to bring Drifter some comfort.

>color drifter indigo

 You reach out, caressing the Drifter's delicate aura, willing it to
 become indigo. His aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though
 they were his own emotions.

 The Drifter blooms self-assured and trusting indigo. Then nothing.
 Grey. Even though the emotional connection is brief, feeling something
 -<span class="floydstyle em">anything</span>- seems to bring Drifter some comfort.

>examine drifter

 A Blind One, a human. Probably male. He breathes incoherent, oozes
 fleshy secretions, and his odd combination of connections prevents him
 from either Singing or Walking.

 His dim grey aura disjointedly statics.

>color drifter green

 You emerge from your hiding spot.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Interstitial Room</span>

 The drifting auras of humans call from the to the northwest and to the
 northeast. The collection room is to the east, and the dredging room

 pipe room is to the southeast. A set of stairs leads up to the rest of
 the ship.

 Captain, Medic and the Mercy's drifting auras waft from the room to
 the east.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Collection Room</span>
 Exhibited are geologic readings and stolen samples. Centered in the
 room is a large metal table with your opened Cellarium displayed
 prominently.

 The interstitial room is to the west.

 The humans vibrate in a repetitious din of nervous red. They concern
 themselves with the presence of your opened Cellarium and
 uncomfortably search about the room, only barely missing your
 entrance. Only the Mercy explodes curious yellow and fascinates over
 the Cellarium. Captain finally breaks out of shock and feigns a shell
 of violet control, "You may be right. There may have been some sort
 of... chemical in that box that got released due to the pressure
 change."

>color captain yellow

 Captain is too strong to be influenced.

 Medic percolates into a furious infrared, "Now hold on. I was
 expecting for Mercy to take a sample, do some spectroscopy, and maybe
 - maybe! find an unusual chemical peak. But this... this is beyond
 that. It contained... I don't know what. We have to do something."

 You exalt! <span class="floydstyle em">Yes, they must do something: return the Cellarium. This</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">is your chance.</span> You push-sing of returning, of order, of empathy,
 but as before, your pleas are met by Blindness. Communication must be
 established, but for now they probably still fear you, and will lash
 out in hostile infrared if they find you.

>color medic yellow

 Medic is too solid to offer you any influential opportunities.

 Captain scales hesitation before holding on a conclusion, "I will call
 an all hands in the Messdeck, and figure out what we need to do from
 there. We already have one injured and way too many ill; I won't be
 responsible for more." Captain pushes out with Medic. Progress?
 Perhaps in this meeting they will decide to return your Cellarium. You
 notice the Mercy pause over your Cellarium, tracing its harmonic
 patterns. "What are you?" she whispers, enraptured. Her mind opens,
 connects for an instant. But then she snaps back to the physical and
 hastens to catch up with the other Blind Ones.

>go up

 You slide yourself up the jagged floor, to the messdeck above, when
 suddenly, fear freezes you. From this staircase, with no hiding spots,
 you can hear the thick cluttered jumble of colors coming from several
 Blind Ones. There is no way that they would miss you. There must be
 another way up.

 Piles of cloth ooze uncountable emotions. One cold metal prison sits

 You press yourself up through the vent with reliance on friction and
 clever weight-shifting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Burning Room</span>
 The room smells equally of creation and destruction, of stealing the
 Order of others. It is both fascinating and disgusting. There are
 several strange machines in this room.

 You hear glimpses of color from the adjoining room, "...pushed open

 Blue-green fondness and enjoyed creation spring from an acoustic well
 of burning fire and destruction.

 You hear glimpses of color from the adjoining room, "...she decided it

 There are many Blind Ones there, and the passageway is bare. They

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cold Room</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Colder Room</span>
 The madness in this room is soul-wrenching. How the Blind Ones could
 live with this atrocity is unfathomable. Fleshy chunks of the
 formerly-alive sit in frozen stacks, trapped in disunity. Your own

 need to help this, heal this, fix this: you can't idle while such
 suffering exists.

 The cold room is through the overhead vent to the north.

 That (<span class="floydstyle em">the meat packages</span>) cannot be possessed. It has no mind,
 no real melody.

>color meat grey

 The meat is too disjointed to color. It needs to be combined first.

>combine meat

 You smooth your body over the meat, attempting to conduct it into
 harmony, but each lump of flesh is too frozen in physical isolation to
 properly form covalent chords. You must bring warmth to the meat, and
 your body is not currently warm enough to do so.

 You smooth your body over the meat packages, physically and
 metaphysically conducting unity and understanding and cohesion. As you
 weave together the previously disparate notes, the black gives way to
 confusion, then curiosity, and then slowly to joy and happiness at its
 newfound Song. The Newsong greenly bubbles into gleeful thankfulness.

 The Newsong plays with its new aura and body in wonderment and joy.

>possess newsong

 You push your aura into the Newsong, who relieves in happiness and
 bliss at the bond. You surprise at the sensation: your bodies remain
 divorced, but your minds move in perfect synch. You tug curiously at
 its simplistic flesh-structures, feeling the creature's immsense
 weight. You can make it do whatever you want.

 The Newsong's body stiffens noticeably in the cold. It needs warmth.

>go north

 You shove the Newsong's body against the freezer door, barreling into
 the next room. It takes a moment to collect itself, before locking
 into understanding.

 It wrests control, and independently gallops to its own freedom,
 opening the cold door, bursting out into the middle of the human
 congregation. They respond in shredding, blackened oranges and reds.
 One Blind One wails in aberrant disgust and pushes things at the
 Newsong; another grabs a violet cylinder and expels its contents -
 gaseous carbon dioxide - at the Newsong. The shock severs your tenuous
 connection completely. The Newsong gallops on, indignant, to bask in
 the warmth of the nearby star. As the doors slowly swing back shut,
 the Newsong sings for you of freedom, of joy, of radiance before
 leaving to compose itself a new life.

 You reach out, caressing Captain's delicate aura, willing it to become

 Captain grasps at wisps of green and is able to recombine in violet
 strength and fortitude. Her wretchings cease, and she turns to the
 Assister, "We need to... get our shit... together and stop whatever is
 going on. We need to..." Captain is drawn into one last involuntary
 purge then takes a moment to collect her colors.

 A Blind One. Might be female.

 Her light red aura screws tightly.

 The Assister senses her opening for demands, "You-- We can't go on

 The beauty of your recorded sound reverberates throughout the entirety
 of the human vessel. You delight in its melody, and you can feel a
 vague connection to all the Blind Ones, to one in particular, but then
 suddenly it is cut short. You curl in surprise: Captain must have
 sabotaged it, but why? It does not matter. You felt one human truly

 Dark clouds above are dissipating, the remnants of a terrible storm.

 vessels.

 The smaller vessels are to the south, the closed sturdy hatch is to
 the east, the unyielding hatch is to the west, the secretion room is
 to the north, and a set of stairs leads up and down.

 The Mercy has heard the majesty of the Universe. She is awe-struck -
 she knows and sings and you can feel her willingness to help. But her
 mind over-immersed, in levels that her physical body could not
 contain: it wilts from boundary-exceeding heterostasis. Assister
 abandons the Cellarium, blustering caring forte for the Mercy. But
 Assister's efforts are having no effect, and you know: The Mercy needs
 the real expert. But Medic has locked herself away and not coming out.
 Intolerable.

>examine mercy

 A Blind One. Possibly a female? She offers herself as yours to
 control.

 Her light white aura radiates bliss.

 The Mercy's fading body. The Assister desperately attempting to revive
 her. Her mind cracks.

>examine medic

 You can faintly feel a vague, black outline of Medic.

 Assister attempts to revive the Mercy, holding back chords of dismay
 and helplessness.

>color medic violet

 You reach out to color the Medic from outside, and nearly succeed, but
 it is too difficult with her in the sick bay.

 Assister touches - forcefully - the Mercy with frantic calls to the
 closed hatch.

>go east

 The hatch is too large for you to move. It will have to stay closed.

 Assister focuses her attention on the hatch, attempting to open it.
 But she cannot.

 It is much too heavy for you to open.

 Assister doubles her efforts to assist the Mercy, but dissolves in
 uselessness as none of her calls have any effect.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Secretion Room</span>
 Rigidity. Grey walls and sterile, dead water. This room is bare, save

 Anxiety sickens the lymphatic flow of this room.

 The middle level of the outside is to the east, and the secretion room
 is through a cabinet to the northeast.

 From the closed hatch to the outside, you sense the Mercy's body faint
 and fading, as well as Assister pleading for Medic's help. But here,
 stagnating, Medic swirls onto herself in fright and indifference,
 humming a barricade against any influence or Song. Engineer throbs
 frustrated infrared, unable to move her damaged meat-parts.

>color medic violet

 Medic is too solid to offer you any influential opportunities.

 Medic swirls in fright, babbling a self-protecting barricade, "...
 can't help her, won't help her, they will just get us anyway, it's
 useless to go out there..." The damaged Engineer is unable to
 Blind-Sing or Walk, but her aura screams in frustration. She wants to
 do something, anything, to force Medic into action.

>color engineer indigo

 You reach out, caressing Engineer's delicate aura, willing it to
 become indigo. Her aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though
 they were her own emotions.

 Engineer attempts to get up, to force Medic to aid the sickening
 Mercy, but pain causes her to lose her self-resolve too quickly. You
 would not make that mistake. Medic swirls in fright, babbling a

 Engineer is unable to Blind-Sing or Walk, but her aura screams in

 You fold. The music is faint and the song warms you, but you know you
 cannot truly Sing without being in your Cellarium at the proper place.

 Medic swirls in fright, babbling a self-protecting barricade, "... I

>color engineer red

 You reach out, caressing Engineer's delicate aura, willing it to

 were her own emotions.

 Engineer tears over herself in fury at Medic's indifference, at her
 own inability to affect anything. She blames herself, feels a failure.
 She knows she can't force Medic to help by herself, that she needs
 assistance. Medic swirls in fright, babbling a self-protecting
 barricade, "... rescue boats and then leave maybe the life boat but
 can't be sure..." The damaged Engineer is unable to Blind-Sing or
 Walk, but her aura screams in frustration. She wants to do something,
 anything, to force Medic into action.

>control engineer

 Out of frustration, Engineer -- the Rosa -- gives you control
 willingly. As your connnection strengthens, you absorb ambient
 knowledge about their world, about this place. Slowly, you orient
 yourself to the flesh's dizzying hum of salt channels, sugar surges,
 and gas exchanges. At first, you try pulling each limb individually as
 with the Newsong, but quickly find an easier time by simply puppeting
 the conductive cells in the spine. You move the body. Its neurons
 scream of pain from the skin and deeper tissues. You ignore it. You
 stand the Rosa upright. Medic has not yet noticed you.

>talk to medic

 The Rosa-body is too injured to speak anything but guttural
 percussions. This is still enough to get the Medic's attention, "Oh
 god, please don't, I won't... Your bandages, please I will help, just
 don't hurt me." Medic bursts open the hatch, and you follow to ensure
 compliance. Medic writhes under the additional dagger-furying curses
 of Assister. Goaded into helping, Medic touches the Mercy in an
 intricate breath-sharing dance that restores her body. Rosa's body
 collapses out of your control, inoperative, just as the Mercy's body
 gasps into life. Medic glances over, and eye-snares you. Medic tumbles
 black: forward and back, then expands and contracts. Medic whispers to
 herself of escape as she flees to the quarterdeck.

 "Thank you, Sarah," the Mercy buzzes to the long-absconded Medic.
 There is a distinct change in her timbre: bemusement and detachment
 towards her old world. She notices your presence, and pretends to
 address Assister, again in the same tone, "I'm feeling much better,
 Wenig, and I think that I will do some paperwork. In the lab!"
 Assister shocks incredulous, but obligates the Rosa with assistance as
 the Mercy heads down.

 The Mercy glows as you enter her presence. Her mind still swims with
 bliss, and her Song is perfectly tuned. "Thank you. I... everything is
 so beautiful now," she moves her body and picks you up, "I know what
 you want - to return," you can feel her flesh react where it touches
 you, "I want to help you, get you back to your home," the flesh now
 oozes and ashes, "as thanks for the magnificence that you have granted
 me," her flesh now scalds acidic, but the Mercy continues, "what
 should I do for you first?"

>ask mercy to drop us

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>mercy, put me in cellarium

 The Mercy enjoys your influence, but your body continues to damage
 her.

 The Mercy continues to hold you, completely enraptured, but your body
 damages her physical. Your alkaline composition eats through her
 flesh, and your aqueous body sifts through the slits between her
 finger bones. The Mercy is too connected to the Song to immediately
 mind, but soon she cries mangled regret, and without her ability to
 help, you find yourself unable to escape. After Captain captures you,
 Assister is roused into action. They transport you ashore, where your
 peace is constantly interrupted by some new Blind Ones tapping at you
 with scientific grey instruments. One day, in a flurry of bright green
 excitement, the Blind Ones shove a permanent rod into your body. Then
 they leave you alone to fold. You are never again interrupted, but the
 rod always is there, a nagging splinter preventing you from fully
 embracing the bliss of the Universe. But the Song is still lovely, and
 you join in as best you can.<span class="floydstyle em"> Off-white. Happiness.</span>

 The Mercy push-sings to the Drifter. She calls out to him, reaches
 through the physical and pulls at his severed ties, coloring them into
 this world. The Mercy sings for your assistance: she needs you to
 finish connecting him.

>connect drifter

 You sing of unity, cohesion and singlehood. His connections ribbon
 into a strange modal function, looping unnecessarily back and forth
 between the physical and the other. Slowly, it resumes its baseline
 level of dim awareness. He sees the Mercy, and understands his return.
 The Mercy bubbles satisfied, waiting for his response.

>examine drifter

 A Blind One, a human. Probably male. His dim grey aura disjointedly
 statics.


 Drifter groggs his mind into vengeful purpose, "You bitch!" he lurches
 at the Mercy, "That thing'll kill us!" The Mercy lags disbelief as he
 heavily commands, "I won't let it. I won't<span class="floydstyle em"> let you - !</span>"
 Drifter presses infrared destruction against the Mercy's neck. The
 Mercy sings for your help.

 You reach out, caressing Drifter's delicate aura, willing it to become

 his own emotions.

 Drifter surges with blue memories of the Mercy; his grip falters and
 he falls back. The Mercy grabs a nearby human object and pushes it
 against Drifter multiple times in a way that damages, then disconnects
 his ties and cohesion.

 The Mercy quivers disbelieving orange, "We can't... why. I don't..."
 but she solaces in the Song's knowledge, "He was wrong. He was Blind.

 unending destruction. You stop. It slows. Then you notice the other
 tempest.

 In a lashing mess of reds, oranges, and infrareds, Captain writhes out
 determined from the vessel proper. She screams of endings, of
 finality. You molt in fear: the Mercy needs you.

 Captain is too strong in her current colors, there is no way that she
 could be influenced, but the Mercy would gladly offer herself to you.

 Captain takes advantage of Mercy and Assister's pre-occupation. She
 launches a flaring, gibbering ball at Assister, who falls in a
 confused, black tangle. Captain similarly dispatches Mercy when she
 comes out. Captain drags your Cellarium out and over the side of the
 ship. You float down and land far from your appointed place. You Sing,
 and re-join the Universe, but slightly off-key. You settle in,
 reshaping the seafloor so that eventually, after many millennia, you
 will once again enjoy perfect harmony.

 The distance makes it difficult, but you both stretch, and the shared

 location...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DSV-2 (Controlling Mercy)</span>
 The Mercy scrambles panicked to the control panel, skimming it over: A
 set of searchlight buttons, arm manipulator levers, a propeller
 throttle, and an emergency surface switch.


 Captain advances slowly, wrathfully. Assister remains oblivious to the
 distant Captain.

>assister, enter

 You can't talk to the Assister.

>examine controls

 A set of searchlight buttons, arm manipulator levers, a propeller
 throttle, and an emergency surface switch.


>examine levers

 Multiple levers used to dynamically control the movement of the
 exterior manipulator arms.

>push buttons

 The lights flash brilliantly, surprising Captain, just as she launches
 a flaming, gibbering ball at Assister. Her trajectory is slightly
 altered by your surprise, and Assister merely crumples into hushed
 agony instead of complete silence.

 Captain discards her launcher, and in crescendoing fury turns her
 attention to you - your Cellarium helpless in the forward basket. She
 searches for the lid.

>pull levers

 The arms move slowly, but with ferocious weight. Captain tries to
 dodge their area of command and pull your heavy Cellarium out, but you
 manage to percuss Captain in a ringing orange din, coloring her fury
 brighter.

 Captain decides to directly address the vessel, the Mercy. She claws
 up the side of the hatch in a scrabbling, grabbing flurry. The Mercy
 blanks in anxiety.

>turn on throttle

 The propellers whorl furiously outside, but only succeed in displacing
 air. Captain continues, undaunted.

 Without your guidance, Mercy loses her nerve. Captain overpowers her,
 and triumphs over your captured form, and waits for other Blind Ones
 to rescue her. They transport you ashore, where your peace is
 constantly interrupted by some new Blind Ones tapping at you with
 scientific grey instruments. One day, in a flurry of bright green
 excitement, the Blind Ones shove a permanent rod into your body. Then
 they leave you alone to fold. You are never again interrupted, but the
 rod always is there, a nagging splinter preventing you from fully
 embracing the bliss of the Universe. But the Song is still lovely, and
 you join in as best you can.<span class="floydstyle em"> Off-white. Happiness.</span>

 overboard. Right above the trench: at the junction where we found you.

 A piece of human-furniture with a paper.

 In human-writing it describes Captain's last report:

 We are in need of engine repairs, and I take full responsibility for
 this delay not allowing us to continue our research duties as quickly
 as possible. We are now waiting for repairs to complete. In an
 unrelated incident, we took a standard geological sample from the
 epicenter, but it seems to be perhaps poisonous, as some of the crew
 bunked closest to it have reported feeling unwell. I am taking no
 chances and am ensuring its disposal.

 Mercy surprises at the note's whitewashed contents, "A few months ago,
 well, Eliza knew this astronaut that got blacklisted as... crazy for
 seeing an 'alien' on the moon." The Mercy halts, then braves, "Are
 there Ancients on the moon?"

 Mercy turns on the motor. She looks to you for direction. You tap into
 the harmonic patterns of the earth's magnetism, and sense the
 direction of your home: southwest.

>go southwest

 Mercy frets a crack of light red in her otherwise symmetrical white
 orb, "Letting you sink inside your Cellarium will be fine, but the
 current: you'll drift away from where we want you to land." You tap
 into the harmonic patterns of the earth's magnetism, and sense the
 direction of your home: southwest.

>go southwest

 Mercy turns her concerns inward, more cracks forming "And what of me?
 I won't have anything when you go. I can't go back to them, they'd
 never understand, never compare to this." You tap into the harmonic
 patterns of the earth's magnetism, and sense the direction of your
 home: southwest.

 Mercy glows steadily again,"No matter what happens to me, I'll just be
 happy knowing I did the right thing. That I helped you." You tap into
 the harmonic patterns of the earth's magnetism, and sense the
 direction of your home: south.

>go south

 You arrive. You can feel the harmonics of your guiding influence that
 have shaped the seafloor far below into the infinitely echoing pattern
 of spreading and subducting. You are so close to being home again, you
 quiver. Mercy lingers, then turns to you. Knowing the cost, she
 reaches out to stroke you - to feel you - one last time.

 vibrates in anticipation for your happiness.

>epilogue
 You shift against the helicopter straps uncomfortably. This is the
 middle of the third refueling, and Chilean officials are starting to
 lean hard on SAR to find the missing research ship. But two mysterious
 storms battered the coast, lending to suspicious whispers. They're
 saying that not even Saint Anthony's help can foil this devil's work.

 You haven't give up however, and you take advantage of Amaro dipping
 into a turn to resume searching the sea.

>examine sea

 Nothing but open, empty sea.
>examine me
 Nothing but open, empty sea....
 Nothing but open, empty sea.......
 Nothing but open, empty sea.......... but wait, you do see something!
 A dark speck, in the distance. Amaro seems to notice it at the same
 time. "Fantastic! Can you radio dispatch?" Amaro exclaims, "I'm going
 in for the approach."

>examine speck

 The dark speck is too distant to be properly visible.

 Annoyed, Amaro makes the call for you as he flies towards his
 destination. The shape starts to coalesce, but you still can't quite
 make it out. The radio crackles in reply, "Roger that. Hope you've
 found it!"

>examine me

 Sweaty, tired, and sore from sitting in the rescue helicopter all day.

 The helicopter approaches the speck, and its shape slowly clears into
 a life boat. Your mind reels as Amaro relays the details. How many
 survivors? Will any be critical? The radio statics in anxiously,
 "...keep on reporting."

>examine me

 Sweaty, tired, and sore from sitting in the rescue helicopter all day.

 By now you are nearly on top of the life boat, but things do not seem
 promising. There are no distress signals, no flares, no reflecting
 glint: no signs of life. The radio seems to echo your unease, "Is it
 abandoned? Advising caution."

>examine boat

 It's much clearer now: a small lifeboat. You can't see anyone aboard,
 though, and the fact that they haven't sent off any distress signals
 or flares is worrying.

 Amaro brings the helicopter to a hover over the life boat, and you can
 see a single person inside the boat, lying down. Amaro gestures to you
 that his position is stable and releases the ladder. The radio
 acknowledges your situation as a small emergency, but wants to focus
 on finding more survivors. "Just in case, sending backup your way,
 miss. Let's save somebody."

>go down

 You climb down the ladder and drop down into the boat. You signal to
 Amaro to land, and he keeps the blades running nearby. There is only
 one woman here, curled up on her side. You can see that she wears the
 colors of a Corpsman, and you grimly appreciate the irony of one medic
 saving another.

>examine woman

 Breathing lightly, she stares ahead as if transfixed or not fully
 here. You notice that she's clutching at a tape in her hands.

>examine tape

 The kind of magnetic tape still used in vessel radio system logs. It
 probably has important clues or information.

>talk to woman

 She does not acknowledge you at all, just continues to clutch at her
 tape.

>take tape

 You pull the tape from her hands. She immediately rouses from her
 state of shock and grabs at you, pulls you closer, and speaks past you
 in what you recognize as English, "Believe me! It was... it was..."
 but she trails off. '<span class="floydstyle em">Horrible?</span>' You internally punctuate,
 before she does finish her thought after all, "Beautiful." Then she
 collapses.

 <span class="floydstyle em">No!</span> you scream. But you can revive her, you can save her.

>revive woman

 You push against her chest with rapid, strong heaves. She does not
 respond. You do not relent. More time passes, and the physical
 exertion is catching up to you, but there is still no pulse. Do you
 continue?
>yes
 continue?

 You continue pushing against her chest and feel at least one rib crack
 and give way - not uncommon. But she still does not respond. You feel
 your body slowing as you glance about, and don't notice any backup on
 the way. Do you continue?
>yes
 the way. Do you continue?

 You continue CPR procedures, but your body involuntarily slows from
 the exertion, and still there is no pulse. After 30 minutes, you are
 forced to stop from the sheer exhaustion. You fume; why the hell
 didn't anyone show up? Amaro might know.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Helicopter</span>
 The helicopter is landed next to a lifeboat. Amaro waits on you
 expectedly.

 Amaro spits out, "Our backup got diverted. They found the main
 vessel." You sigh and relay the results of your revive attempts. He
 hits the console at your news, "Devil take all, and what else?!" He
 gathers himself before speaking again, "We have to report this."

>show tape to amaro

 Amaro surprises at it, "Looks like ship audio logs. It's probably
 evidence. We need fuel, we can play it back at base." He makes the
 report himself. Dispatch is just as disappointed at the outcome, but
 offers to find appropriate playback equipment by the time you return.
 As the helicopter beats towards land, you curiously turn the tape over
 in your hands. <span class="floydstyle em">This was important to her.</span> She clung to life
 just long enough to make sure that someone got that tape. You will be
 one of the first to hear it played, just as she wanted.



     *** You have ensured that others will hear the tape ***

 Dark clouds dissipate above, while the wind pushes and pulls
 everything. This small deck is dominated by smaller vessels.

 The life boats are to the south, the captain's quarters are to the
 east, the sick bay is to the west, the lavatory is to the north, and a
 set of stairs leads up and down.

 Assister continues to argue belligerent, "Where is the real Mercy? Is
 she... is she dead?" You help the Mercy respond, "I'm real, don't let
 your fear control you. You're not being logical."

 Captain takes advantage of Mercy and Assister's pre-occupation. She
 launches a flaring, gibbering ball at Assister, who falls in a
 confused, black tangle. Captain similarly dispatches Mercy when she
 comes out. Captain drags your Cellarium out and over the side of the
 ship. You float down and land far from your appointed place. You Sing,
 and re-join the Universe, but slightly off-key. You settle in,
 reshaping the seafloor so that eventually, after many millennia, you
 will once again enjoy perfect harmony.

>possess mercy

 The distance makes it difficult, but you both stretch, and the shared
 need strengthens your bond. You take a moment to acclimate to her
 location...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">DSV-2 (Controlling Mercy)</span>
 The Mercy scrambles panicked to the control panel, skimming it over: A
 set of searchlight buttons, arm manipulator levers, a propeller
 throttle, and an emergency surface switch.


 Captain advances slowly, wrathfully. Assister remains oblivious to the
 distant Captain.

>push buttons

 The lights flash brilliantly, surprising Captain, just as she launches
 a flaming, gibbering ball at Assister. Her trajectory is slightly
 altered by your surprise, and Assister merely crumples into hushed
 agony instead of complete silence.

 Captain discards her launcher, and in crescendoing fury turns her
 attention to you - your Cellarium helpless in the forward basket. She
 searches for the lid.

>pull levers

 The arms move slowly, but with ferocious weight. Captain tries to
 dodge their area of command and pull your heavy Cellarium out, but you
 manage to percuss Captain in a ringing orange din, coloring her fury
 brighter.

 Captain decides to directly address the vessel, the Mercy. She claws
 up the side of the hatch in a scrabbling, grabbing flurry. The Mercy
 blanks in anxiety.

>push switch

 The cabin portion of the sub uncouples, propels itself upward, then
 smashes <span class="floydstyle em">col pugno</span> against its more weighted side: the side
 Captain was climbing. Her song ends instantly. In the chaotic
 apoptosis, your control over the Mercy breaks, and your consciousness
 snaps to the Cellarium.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Cellarium</span>
 A white, crystalline Ancient structure that perfectly houses you.

 You can feel the Mercy outside trembling, alone and afraid.

>out

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Loading Deck</span>
 Dark clouds dissipate above, while the wind pushes and pulls
 everything.

 Assister pales in incoherent warbles as her song winds to an end: she
 is oblivious to everything. The Mercy wobbles from the split
 submarine, and breaks down in sadness for only you, "That was your
 only way back. We can't... there's not another way to put you back
 now." She twists in thoughts, "Maybe, maybe I could drop you
 overboard. Right above the trench: at the junction where we found you.
 Could we get back there, somehow?" You both know it's not optimal, but
 it's your best chance now. You smooth the Mercy in swaddling layers of
 warmth and comfort as she once again, offers herself as yours to
 control.

 The messdeck is to the north, the wet lab is sectioned off to the
 east, and a set of stairs lead up. Your open Cellarium rests here.

>possess mercy

 You take control of the Mercy. You both revel in the bliss of perfect
 harmonic unity.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Captain's Quarters (Controlling Mercy)</span>
 Responsibility concaves the floor, and shaming ghosts stagnate the
 air. The human-furnitures fight to remain upright in all the weight.

 The quarterdeck is to the west.

>examine desk

 A piece of human-furniture with a paper.

>examine paper

 In human-writing it describes Captain's last report:

 We are in need of engine repairs, and I take full responsibility for
 this delay not allowing us to continue our research duties as quickly
 as possible. We are now waiting for repairs to complete. In an
 unrelated incident, we took a standard geological sample from the
 epicenter, but it seems to be perhaps poisonous, as some of the crew
 bunked closest to it have reported feeling unwell. I am taking no
 chances and am ensuring its disposal.

 Mercy surprises at the note's whitewashed contents, "A few months ago,
 well, Eliza knew this astronaut that got blacklisted as... crazy for
 seeing an 'alien' on the moon." The Mercy halts, then braves, "Are
 there Ancients on the moon?"
>no
 there Ancients on the moon?"

 You inform her that there haven't been Ancients on the moon for
 millennia: that's why its core is dead and silent. The Mercy
 fascinates over this revelation.

>color mercy brown

 You are synced in blissful unity with this Blind One. Her color can be
 nothing but pure white while you continue to control her.

>release

 What do you want to release?

>release mercy

 You sing of separation, of independence. Mercy regains majority
 control of her own body.

>color mercy brown

 "Brown" isn't a pure wavelength. You can only create simple emotions.
 You reach out, caressing Mercy's delicate aura, willing it to become
 brown. Her aura absorbs this new state willingly, as though they were
 her own emotions.

>color mercy pink

 I only understood you as far as wanting to color Mercy.

>color mercy plaid

 I only understood you as far as wanting to color Mercy.

>examine mercy

 A Sighted One. She offers herself as yours to control.

 Her pure white aura radiates bliss.

 The Mercy ponders in remorseful, dark yellows what drove Captain to
 her solitude.

 A bunk and a desk seem somewhat interesting.

 The Mercy searches semi-unsettled yellow for clues to Captain's

 The single slotted bed is drenched in Captain's fading colors. She

 The Mercy tumbles in anticipation for your unity.

>about

 <span class="floydstyle em">Coloratura</span> by Lynnea Glasser (formerly Lynnea Dally)

 The idea for <span class="floydstyle em">Coloratura</span> came from one of my favorite games
 growing up: <span class="floydstyle em">Titanic: Challenge of Discovery</span>. While exploring
 its undersea wrecks, I couldn't help but imagine what it might be like
 to find something terrible. When writing this game, I took advantage
 of the fact that the text-based medium gave a unique opportunity to
 tell the story from the creature's inhuman perspective, and had a lot
 of fun with different descriptions and new kinds of actions.

 Thanks to diligent testers Russell Glasser, Michael Ammer, Hall Hood,

 Nothing but open, empty sea.......... but wait, you do see something!
 A dark speck, in the distance. Amaro seems to notice it at the same
 time. "Fantastic! Can you radio dispatch?" Amaro exclaims, "I'm going
 in for the approach."

>radio dispatch

 You report that you may have found something interesting. The dispatch
 tries to contain their excitement at the news as you relay your intent
 to approach.

 Amaro flies towards the destination. The shape starts to coalesce, but
 you still can't quite make it out. The radio crackles in reply, "Roger
 that. Hope you've found it!"

>examine radio

 It's the device that you use to radio dispatch.

 The helicopter approaches the speck, and its shape slowly clears into
 a life boat. Your mind reels as you relays the details. How many
 survivors? Will any be critical? The radio statics in anxiously,
 "...keep on reporting."

>report

 What do you want to report?

>life boat

 You continue relaying information.

 By now you are nearly on top of the life boat, but things do not seem
 promising. There are no distress signals, no flares, no reflecting
 glint: no signs of life. The radio seems to echo your unease, "Is it
 abandoned? Advising caution."

>examine boat

 It's much clearer now: a small lifeboat. You can't see anyone aboard,
 though, and the fact that they haven't sent off any distress signals
 or flares is worrying.

 Amaro brings the helicopter to a hover over the life boat, and you can
 see a single person inside the boat, lying down. Amaro gestures to you
 that his position is stable and releases the ladder. The radio
 acknowledges your situation as a small emergency, but wants to focus
 on finding more survivors. "Just in case, sending backup your way,
 miss. Let's save somebody."

>go down

 You climb down the ladder and drop down into the boat. You signal to
 Amaro to land, and he keeps the blades running nearby. There is only
 one woman here, curled up on her side. You can see that she wears the
 colors of a Corpsman, and you grimly appreciate the irony of one medic
 saving another.

>save medic

 You attempt to aid her, to urge her to return to the helicopter with
 you. But she just sits and stares, and turns a tape over and over in
 her hands.

>examine tape

 The kind of magnetic tape still used in vessel radio system logs. It
 probably has important clues or information.

>talk to medic

 She does not acknowledge you at all, just continues to clutch at her
 tape.

>get tape

 You pull the tape from her hands. She immediately rouses from her
 state of shock and grabs at you, pulls you closer, and speaks past you
 in what you recognize as English, "Believe me! It was... it was..."
 but she trails off. '<span class="floydstyle em">Horrible?</span>' You internally punctuate,
 before she does finish her thought after all, "Beautiful." Then she
 collapses.

 <span class="floydstyle em">No!</span> you scream. But you can revive her, you can save her.

>save her

 You push against her chest with rapid, strong heaves. She does not
 respond. You do not relent. More time passes, and the physical
 exertion is catching up to you, but there is still no pulse. Do you
 continue?
>no
 continue?

 You've performed enough revive attempts to know when to call it. You
 fume; you'll have to report this.

>report this

 You can't see any such thing.

>report death

 You can only report from inside the helicopter.

>examine tape

 The kind of magnetic tape still used in vessel radio system logs. It
 probably has important clues or information.

>examine medic

 It is sad and frustrating.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a found tape

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Life Boat</span>
 The woman's dead body lies motionless. The life boat itself has
 markings indicating that it's from the missing research vessel.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Helicopter</span>
 The helicopter is landed next to a lifeboat. Amaro waits on you
 expectedly.

 Amaro spits out, "Our backup got diverted. They found the main
 vessel." You sigh and relay the results of your revive attempts. He
 hits the console at your news, "Devil take all, and what else?!" He
 gathers himself before speaking again, "We have to report this."

>report death

 You steel yourself and make the call. Dispatch is just as disappointed
 at the outcome, but offers to find appropriate playback equipment by
 the time you return. As the helicopter beats towards land, you
 curiously turn the tape over in your hands. <span class="floydstyle em">This was important to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">her.</span> She clung to life just long enough to make sure that someone
 got that tape. You will be one of the first to hear it played, just as
 she wanted.

>throw tape in ocean

 I only understood you as far as wanting to throw the found tape.

>throw tape

 Perhaps it is this tape that drove her mad; whatever is on it should
 not be preserved. You throw it overboard, and feel a wave of relief as
 it sinks. Now there's nothing left but to report this.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Helicopter</span>
 The helicopter is landed next to a lifeboat. Amaro waits on you
 expectedly.

 Amaro starts to chart the path back to the mainland.

>examine amaro

 He's almost as tired and anxious as you are.

 Amaro waits for you to report the dead woman.

>report the dead woman

 You steel yourself and make the call. Dispatch is just as disappointed
 at the outcome, but they call you back to base to refuel and then
 prepare to assist with evacuating the main vessel: they apparently
 need to transport at least a dozen comatose survivors. They assure you
 that the <span class="floydstyle em">Armada</span> will be about shortly for the life boat
 itself. You shift uncomfortably, thinking about whatever information
 may have been lost by destroying the tape, but you assure yourself
 that it was the right thing to do.
