 There is a new coin-op at Vigamus: it is called "Zombies Attack!" and
 it should be the ultimate survival horror game. Unfortunately, it's a
 bit too real for you: as soon as you turn on the case, an army of
 decaying and hungry zombies swarms out of the screen and into the
 museum, searching for brains to eat.

 Seeing the monsters, Metalmark faints like a damsel in distress, so
 it's up to you to save Vigamus and Paddy, stuck in her office. Surely
 you can find something useful to fight this horrible menace in the
 museum's rooms. So, keep your eyes peeled and... no panic!

 Do you want to read the instructions? (y/n)

>y


 In a text adventure, each action needs to be typed in following the
 verb + object syntax: TAKE BALL, OPEN DOOR, EXAMINE JACKET, WEAR HAT,
 TALK TO THE GIRL, ATTACK THE ZOMBIE...

 In order to go from a place to another, you need to type in the
 direction you want to take: NORTH (shortened N), SOUTH (S), EAST (E),
 WEST (W).

 The command INVENTORY (I) makes you visualize the list of object in
 your possession, while LOOK (L) brings on the description of the place
 you are in, and SCORE will tell you which point of the story you are
 in. With SAVE you can save your position in a file, and to continue
 playing from that, you need to type RESTORE.

 Verbs you can use in this game are: TAKE (T), EXAMINE (X), GIVE, TALK,
 WEAR, REMOVE, OPEN, CLOSE, BREAK, ATTACK (K), HIT, CUT, THROW, SWTICH
 ON, SWITCH OFF, PLAY and, of course, many others.

 Exceptionally, in this game you can also type the verb USE, but try
 not to abUSE it!

 Examining the objects and details in the descriptions of the places
 will make you find some hidden object and useful clues to proceed in
 the game.

 You can also ask for HELP, SAVE your progress on a file, RESTORE it,
 or check your SCORE. Last but not least, UNDO allows you to go back
 one move, even after dying.

 Type INFO to read these instructions again, CREDITS to see the game's
 credits.

 Have fun!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Interactive Area 1</span>
 You are now in one of the two interactive areas of Vigamus, where you
 can play old games. Going to the south, you can reach the shop.

 The arcade of "Zombies Attack!" stands menacingly in the center of the
 room.

 The unconscious body of Metalmark, Director of Vigamus, is laying on
 the floor.

 You can't see any such thing.

 I don't think you should do that, after what happened.

 I don't think it would be nice to kick the Director's unconscious body
 and give him to the zombies.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shop</span>
 You are now in the shop. A big show-case shows books and gadgets of
 Vigamus. To the north you can see the interactive area, while to the
 west there's the museum entrance.

 Among the gadgets there's a Pong ball.

>examine pong


 There are Ping Pong balls and Pong balls, like this one. It's white
 like the others, but much heavier. What would happen if you tried to
 hit someone with that?

>get it


 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance</span>
 You are in the entrance hall of Vigamus. To the north there is the big
 hallway called "Game Zero" which, through a series of show-cases and
 themed panels, tells the history of video games from its dawn in the
 50s to the present. To the east there's the shop, with Vigamus' books
 and gadgets. To the west, there's the door to the editorial office of
 GamesVillage.it and Vigamus Magazine. The exit is to the south.

 There's a zombie here!

 You hear screams coming from the north!

>throw ball at zombie


 Caught by a sudden inspiration, you throw the heavy Pong ball at the
 zombie, hitting it straight between the eyes. The gadget, stuffed with
 dynamite, blows up with the monster's head. The north passage is now
 free.

 You hear screams coming from the north!

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>search zombie

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance of the editorial office</span>
 You are in the hallway that connects the office of the museum's
 Director, to the west, with the editorial office of Vigamus Magazine,
 to the south. Going to the east, you will be back to the entrance.

>go west


 The door to the office is closed!

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Editorial office of Vigamus Magazine</span>
 You entered the editorial office of Vigamus Magazine, a big open space
 with desks full of computers, tablets and paperwork. The exit is to
 the north.

 On a desk there is a book with this title: "The secrets of text
 adventures".

>read book


 You have a look at the book and find that in the first text adventures
 written during the 70s there were magic words capable of doing
 otherwise impossible things. The most famous and used magic words of
 all was Xyzzy, which made you capable of teleporting from a place to
 another inside the adventure. Anyway, in modern times it would be
 ridiculous to use such a trick to solve a problem in a game. Or not?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance of the editorial office</span>
 You are in the hallway that connects the office of the museum's
 Director, to the west, with the editorial office of Vigamus Magazine,
 to the south. Going to the east, you will be back to the entrance.

>open door


 The door to the Director's office is protected by a keypad lock. I
 don't think you can open it by chance. Probably, only Metalmark knows
 the right key. If you can't wake him up, the door will stay shut.

>examine lock


 Probably only Metalmark knows the key to open the door to his office.

>press 1234

 You can see the carcass of a zombie with brains reduced to a pulp
 here.

 You hear screams coming from the north!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Game Zero (1 of 3)</span>
 You are now in the big room which hosts, from south to north, the

 first section there are consoles and gadgets of the dawn of video game
 industry. To the north, the exhibition continues with the area
 dedicated to the 8 and 16-bit consoles and computers, while to the
 west a lateral passage opens on the conference hall. To the south, you
 get back to the entrance of the museum.

 In this section of the hall, you notice the dentures of Darkiss.

>examine dentures


 "Darkiss! Wrath of the Vampire" is a text adventure that tells the
 terrible deeds of a mean bloodsucking monster. These dentures are the
 perfect gadget for the game. The canine teeth are (very) long and
 sharp, and you can wear them if you want.

>take dentures


 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>wear them


 You can't see "them" (the yells) at the moment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Game Zero (2 of 3)</span>
 You are now in the central section of the exhibition dedicated to the
 history of video games. Here you can find the consoles, computers and
 gadgets of the 8 and 16-bit era of the video game industry, during the
 80s and 90s. To the south, you get back to the beginning of the
 exhibition, while to the north you can reach its end.

 Among the many gadgets in the hall, the one that catches your
 attention more than all the others is a reproduction of the hammer
 which Mario used to crash the barrels with in the first Donkey Kong.

>examine hammer

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">E.T. Area</span>
 This room of the museum is dedicated to the finding of the cartridges
 of the E.T. video game for Atari 2600. This game was so ugly that the
 cartridges had been buried in the desert. Now, after a thorough
 excavation, they have been recovered and exposed in museums all over
 the world, so that this big 80s "classic" can be rediscovered. To the
 south you can go back to the Game Zero exhibition, to the west is an
 interactive area, while to the north is an area dedicated to the works
 of Suda51, the acclaimed Japanese game designer.

 You can see an E.T. cartridge here.

>examine cartridge


 This game is known to be one of the ugliest video games ever, if not
 the ugliest of all. It seems to be a very "dangerous" item, which can
 be given or shown to your worst enemy.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Suda51 Hall</span>
 You are in the hall that the museum dedicated to the works of Suda51,
 the acclaimed Japanese game designer who created masterpieces like
 "The Silver Case" and "Lollipop Chainshaw". To the west is Paddy's
 office, to the north the recreational area, to the east the area
 dedicated to the masters of game design, while to the south you may
 return to the E.T. area.

 On a wall of the room is a huge poster of Juliet Starling, the
 charming main character of "Lollipop Chainsaw". Someone drew a big
 moustache on her face.

 In the middle of the room there is a foam rubber chainsaw.

 You hear screams coming from the west!

>examine poster


 Looking at the poster, you notice that there is a lollipop on it: a
 nice gadget of "Lollipop Chainsaw" that you put in your pocket.

 You hear screams coming from the west!

>examine lollipop


 The lollipop is a gadget of "Lollipop Chainsaw", the famous action
 game by Suda51, the acclaimed Japanese game designer which Vigamus
 dedicated an entire room to. You can taste it.

 You hear screams coming from the west!

>examine chainsaw


 The foam rubber chainsaw is a nice gadget of the game "Lollipop
 Chainsaw". If it were real, you could use it to maim the zombies. But,
 as it is, it doesn't look very useful.

 You hear screams coming from the west!

>taste lollipop


 It tastes like grappa, perfect for getting better after a shock.

 You hear screams coming from the west!

 You already have that.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Paddy's office</span>
 You are now in Paddy's office. She's the right (and left) arm of the
 Vigamus' Director. If you can't save her from the zombies, Metalmark
 will be lost, and the museum with him. To the east, you go back to
 Suda51 Room.

 There's a zombie here!

 Paddy is behind her desk and looks with terrified eyes at the zombie
 that wants to eat her.

>show et to zombie


 Caught by a sudden inspiration, you give the E.T. cartridge to the
 zombie. When the monster realizes what that object is, it commits
 suicide out of desperation. Well, it wouldn't be possible, because the
 zombie is already dead, but if someone managed to make a butt-ugly
 game like E.T., it means that anything is possible.

 After taking care of the zombie, you need to help Paddy. The young
 woman is still shocked for the zombie attack. You need to give her
 something to feel better.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>give lollipop to paddy


 You give the lollipop to Paddy, who slowly starts to lick it. In a
 short while, the grappa has its effect and the girl recovers from the
 shock.

 Paddy is grateful to you for killing the monster that was ready to eat
 her. "Was it really a zombie?" she asks, in disbelief.

 You tell her about what happened in the interactive area 1, after the
 new coin-op came, and she ask you to take her to Metalmark. "Only the
 Director" she explains "can find a solution to this problem."

 When you ask her how to wake Metalmark up, the young woman answers:
 "Oh, don't you worry, I have an unfailing cure to wake him up when he
 falls asleep during our meeting. Let's go, now."

 On a wall of the room is a huge poster of Juliet Starling, the
 charming main character of "Lollipop Chainsaw". Someone drew a big
 moustache on her face.

 Paddy looks at the poster and says: "July is wonderful with the
 moustache I draw on her face, isn't she?"

>examine moustache


 Juliet's moustache is obviously fake: someone must have draw it with a
 felt pen to mock her.

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Game Masters area</span>

 moment, each one with his show-case full of documents, memorabilia and
 gadgets. To the north there are the toilets, to the east there is an
 emergency exit, to the west there is the Suda51 Room.

 Paddy is by your side, waiting for you to take her to Metalmark in

 The arcade of "Zombies Attack!" stands menacingly in the center of the
 room.

 The unconscious body of Metalmark, Director of Vigamus, is laying on
 the floor.

 As soon as you enter the Interactive Area and Paddy sees an
 unconscious Metalmark on the floor, the young woman screams in
 anguish. "Director, what did they do to you?" she exclaims, upset.
 Then she kneels beside him and starts examining him thoroughly. "He
 still breathes" she says. "And his heartbeat is okay. I think I can
 wake him up with my unfailing cure."

 Before you can ask what the unfailing cure is, the young woman takes a
 taser from her purse and zaps the unconscious body of the Vigamus
 Director.

 "What the heck... Aaagh!" Metalmark yells, coming back to life. Then
 he looks at Paddy and asks: "Did I fall asleep during a meeting again?
 Hey, I already told you to find a less violent method to wake me up!"

 When you tell him that he didn't fall asleep in a meeting, but fainted
 seeing zombies coming out from the coin-op, he blushes, really
 embarassed. Then he comments: "Damn Kramelmat! I knew I couldn't trust
 him. But the zombies coin-op seemed such a good idea."

 "Who's Kramelmat?" you and Paddy ask at the same time.

 "Oh, just a guy who sells video games. I met him in the virtual
 reality and he persuaded me to try one of his coin-ops. You all saw
 the results. Oh my, what can we do now? The situation is dire!"

 Do you want to help Metalmark and Vigamus to get rid of the zombie

 You assure the Director that you want to help saving the museum from
 the monsters, and ask him what to do. Metalmark thanks you for your
 unselfishness and promises you a free trip to the pleasant and
 charming town of Silent Hill.

 Then he explains: "I think that the only way to solve this problem is
 going back to the virtual reality and ask Kramelmat what to do. I know
 that the Oculus Room's door is shut to avoid the staff playing it for
 free, but you can find the key in my office, whose door you can open
 entering this key: 6969. Don't ask me why I choose those numbers, you
 are old enough to understand it by yourself."

 You get up and are already going to get the key for the Oculus Room,
 but the Director has one more thing to say: "Kramelmat is a very, very
 strange guy, and not only for his name. If I were you, before entering
 the virtual reality I would get at least one power-up. You should find
 one of those in the Game Masters Area, but you'll need to find a way
 to open the show-case where it lays. Again, considering we are in a
 text adventure, I would get some info about the magic words that often
 are used in games like that to solve the most difficult problems. So,
 have a look at the editorial office."

 Another incredible gadget in the Director's office is... a sexy doll
 which resembles Lara Croft!

>examine couch


 This is not the right time to slumber on a couch!

>examine desk


 You try not to think about the number of elephants (unlawfully) killed

 resembles a man appears. It's totally black, apart from his crimson
 eyes and his white beard, circling a mean grin.

 "Welcome to the Netherworld, young adventurer! I am Kramelmat, the one
 who will destroy Vigamus and all the video games on Earth, to prepare
 the coming of the new multidimensional shooters like "Zombies
 Attack!". Everywhere there will be death and destruction, in the name

 The evil creature, who, even with those strange features, looks not so
 unfamiliar to you, looks contemptuously at you and says: "Even if you

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>bite kramelmat


 Thanks to Martin Voigt's powers, you can now fight Kramelmat. You jump
 against the evil creature and bite his throath, just like a
 bloodsucking monster would do. Kramelmat can't avoid your attack,
 horribly yells in pain and in a bunch of seconds is deprived of all
 his blood and power.

 "Damn you, adventurer!" he finally growls. "This time you managed to
 beat me, but I will be back, someday. Anyway you won't ever come back
 in your reality, without your visor, and you'll be stuck in here
 forever! Ha ha ha ha ha!" the evil Kramelmat laughs, before
 disappearing into his grey vortex.

 Actually, now that you are Martin Voigt, you don't have either a visor
 or your fake teeth anymore. How will you come back to the real world?
 But there must be a way, of course! This is a text adventure, a genre
 where you just need to type in a word to make the weirdest things
 happen.

 It looks like you are trapped in virtual reality, if you can't find a
 way (or a word) to get out of it.

>plugh


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>plover


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>abracadabra


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>xyzzy


 You say the ancient magic word Xyzzy, which a long time ago made
 adventurers teleport from a place to another in "Colossal Cave
 Adventure", and the Netherworld starts to dissolve. The rainbows blend
 one into another and everything is so white and blinding that you are
 forced to close your eyes. When you open them again, you hear someone
 say: "In the name of Frobozz's beard, you made it!"

 You are in the interactive area again: the zombies' coin-op is gone,
 and Paddy and Metalmark are looking at you in awe. "Congrats,
 adventurer!" the Director exclaims. "You saved Vigamus from the
 zombies and solved this text adventure. Now you're ready for other and
 more difficult tasks."

 Looking at Metalmark more closely, you suddenly understand why
 Kramelmat was so familiar: he resembled Metalmark! Before you can ask,
 the Director explains: "Yes, I have to admit it: I was Kramelmat.
 After all, you should have noticed that Kramelmat is Metalmark's
 anagram. I created all this zombie invasion to make you try this text
 adventure and discover a genre that, after 40 years, is still loved by
 millions of gamers around the world."

 After Paddy congratulates to you, Kramel... er, Metalmark invites you
 to try other text adventures. "You need to exercise" the director
 says. "One day, Vigamus could need your help again! In the meantime,
 Paddy and I proclaim you Master Adventurer and Honorary Deputy
 Director of Vigamus!"


     <span class="floydstyle i">*** Good job, you saved Vigamus! ***</span>

>restart

 There is a new coin-op at Vigamus: it is called "Zombies Attack!" and
 it should be the ultimate survival horror game. Unfortunately, it's a
 bit too real for you: as soon as you turn on the case, an army of
 decaying and hungry zombies swarms out of the screen and into the
 museum, searching for brains to eat.

 Seeing the monsters, Metalmark faints like a damsel in distress, so
 it's up to you to save Vigamus and Paddy, stuck in her office. Surely
 you can find something useful to fight this horrible menace in the
 museum's rooms. So, keep your eyes peeled and... no panic!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Interactive Area 1</span>
 You are now in one of the two interactive areas of Vigamus, where you
 can play old games. Going to the south, you can reach the shop.

 The arcade of "Zombies Attack!" stands menacingly in the center of the
 room.

 The unconscious body of Metalmark, Director of Vigamus, is laying on
 the floor.

>credits


 "Zigamus" was written in Inform 6, an object-oriented programming
 language similar to C, created by Graham Nelson and dedicated in
 particular to the development of text video games. The best way to
 learn it is reading the Designer's Manual available on
 inform-fiction.org.

 The game's beta testing was made by the "guinea pig" Alessia Padula,
 who tested a (very) alpha version of the adventure, and by Paolo
 Lucchesi, Rosa Squeo, Davide Somma, who played the beta version. Then
 it was translated into English by Francesca Noto and succesfully
 tested by Toby Ott. Sabrina Nofroni is the one who drew the cover art
 for the 2016 IF Comp.

 This game is a tribute to mine and Metalmark's passion (and Paddy's
 too, I hope) for Interactive Fiction and zombies, in particular for
 Z-Nation's ones. When I was asked to write a text adventure placed in
 Vigamus I thought about something that could be a tribute to the
 wonderful show of games and gadgets in the museum and, at the same
 time, could help people familiarize with the basis of this genre.

 If, after finishing "Zigamus", you would like to try other text
 adventures, please have a look at my website www.marcovallarino.it and
 the Interactive Fiction Database: ifdb.tads.org.

 Vigamus waits for you in Rome, via Sabotino 4. It is open from Tuesday
 to Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.: apart from many objects, games,
 gadgets and interactive areas, it often hosts events about gaming and
 retrogaming, which you can read about on www.vigamus.com and
 www.fb.com/vigamusrome, where you can also find the pictures of past
 events and info about the other activities of the museum.

 But this time will be different. This time, you'll definitely be
 guaranteed victory, as long as you pray to the gods for help.

 And no one will be able to stop you.

 <span class="floydstyle em">How to Win at Rock Paper Scissors</span> was written and programmed
 by Brian Kwak in Inform 7.

 A huge thank you to all my beta testers—verity virtue, Adri, and
 Jordan Glassman—for helping me test the game on short notice and
 finding ways to improve it.

 I would also like to credit the game <span class="floydstyle em">Raising the Flag on Mount Yo</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Momma</span> by Juhana Leinonen, whose freely available source code was
 examined by me on multiple occasions to use as an example during the
 making of this game.

 And a shout-out to ClubFloyd for inspiring me to make this game in the
 first place, because I thought it would be fun if everyone came
 together to enjoy a game that I had made.

>clubf ..davidw. I guess it's just me and you... want to drive this time?
 TIME?

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine banner

 The banner reads "Rock-Paper-Scissors Competition" in bold letters. It
 seems rather low-budget.

>examine people

 Members of the Rock-Paper-Scissors Club. You recognize them from when
 you used to be in the club, but you don't know them well enough to
 know their names.

>talk to people

 "If you're here for the competition, you're pretty early," says one of
 them in a bored voice. "There's still some time before it starts, so
 you can come back then."

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   your cell phone

>examine phone

 Your cell phone. The camera has been broken for almost a year now. A
 photo of one of your friends is being used as the background.

>examine photo

 A picture of your friend Sarah posing with a V sign is set as your
 phone background. She's always asking you to take a new picture of
 her, but you can't take any pictures with your busted camera.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Gym</span>
 You step outside the gym. The entrance to the gym is back to the
 north, and there are several flyers on the doors. You can also go east
 to the parking lot or west to the quad.

 Your best friend David is here. It seems like he was waiting for you.

 "Hey," he says. "Can we talk?"

>talk to david

 "Hey," you say. "What's up?"

 "Well, you're entering the competition today, right? I just wanted to
 wish you good luck."

 "Oh, yeah, thanks."

 "Also, I wanted to say that, well, after last time... Just, winning
 isn't everything, you know? It's okay even if you don't win."

 "Of course," you say, but you don't really mean it.

 "Um, that's it, then! Good luck in the competition!" He raises his
 fist. "How about a fist bump?"

>paper

 You hold out your open hand, and as you do so, the world starts to
 shake. A hole opens in reality—a swirling vortex of crackling energy.

 David's face transforms into a look of shock as he registers the
 situation. A "wha—" escapes his lips before he is swallowed by the
 vortex, which snaps shut after him.

 Paper beats rock.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Parking Lot</span>
 You are in one of the two parking lots at your school, with this one
 being on the east side. The lot is surprisingly deserted, even in
 spite of it being after school. You can go west to return to the
 school.

 The only person you can see here is a girl whose name you know to be
 Chloe.

 Chloe folds her arms and taps her foot.

>examine chloe

 A senior at your school who is well known for her looks. She's
 concentrating on her smartphone, and occasionally taps her foot as if
 she's waiting for something.

 Chloe texts someone on her phone.

>talk to chloe

 "Hi," you manage to say, but Chloe immediately interrupts you.

 "I, like, have a boyfriend," she says. "And he's, like, picking me up
 at this parking lot soon. Or at least, he's <span class="floydstyle em">supposed</span> to. I've
 been waiting here for, like, forever!"

 "Um, okay."

 Chloe holds her phone out at arm's length and takes a selfie.

>examine chloe's phone

 You can't see any such thing.

>show phone to chloe

 (your cell phone to Chloe)
 "Ew, that phone is, like, so outdated. You should really upgrade to a
 better one, like mine."

 Chloe uses her phone as a mirror to fix her hair.

>ask chloe about phone


>..briank. I didn't realize you made this for Club Floyd... sorry there aren't more people playing today!
 THERE AREN'T MORE PEOPLE PLAYING TODAY!

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>talk to chloe

 "Um, have you tried calling your boyfriend?" you ask.

 "Uh, obviously. He's not picking up, though. He must have, like, left
 it at home again." She rolls her eyes.

 Chloe takes a call on her phone.

>talk to chloe

 Chloe holds up her hand in a "talk to the hand" fashion, stopping you
 before you can say anything. You probably shouldn't talk to her while
 she's on the phone.

>scissors

 You hold out your index and middle fingers, and once again, the world
 starts to shake. Crackling with energy, a vortex opens again.

 Chloe gapes at the vortex and drops her phone, which falls to the
 ground. Before she can recover from the shock, she is sucked in. The
 vortex closes, and the world returns to normal.

 Scissors beats paper.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>score

 You have so far scored 2 out of a possible 10, in 26 turns.

>take phone

 (the smartphone)
 Taken.

>examine smartphone

 Chloe's smartphone. The case that covers it is pink with a rabbit
 design. The phone is in surprisingly good condition, considering the
 fall it took.

 Unfortunately, since you don't know the password, you can't really use
 the smartphone.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Gym</span>
 You are outside the gym. The entrance to the gym is back to the north,
 with several flyers on the doors. You can also go east to the parking
 lot or west to the quad.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quad</span>
 You are at the quad, a courtyard in the center of the school that
 connects most of the major school buildings. During school hours,
 there are usually a lot of students milling around, but today you
 don't see anybody. From here, you can go north to the front of the
 school, northwest to the library, west to the western building,
 southwest to the parking lot, south to the southern building, and east
 to the gym.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of the School</span>
 You walk past the front gate and find yourself at the front of the
 school. You can re-enter the school to the south, or cross the street
 to the north.

 After school lets out, a crossing guard is stationed here to make sure
 students can cross the road safely without being run over, but right
 now there are hardly any students crossing or cars passing by that you
 wonder why the guard is even here at all.

 "Heya, kiddo," says the guard with a smile. "If you want to cross,
 just give me a heads-up and I'll handle the rest."

>go north

 The guard holds up a hand to stop you. "Whoa, there. Didn't I say you
 should give me a heads-up if you want to cross? Just give me a sec and
 I'll let you cross."

>scissors

 You hold out your index and middle fingers, and once again, the world
 starts to shake. A vortex of swirling energy opens in front of the
 guard.

 She looks at you in surprise, and as she does so, the stop sign is
 pulled from her hands. She reaches to grab it, but loses her balance
 and tumbles into the vortex. The vortex closes, leaving the world
 quiet again.

 Scissors beats paper.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>take sign

 You can't see any such thing.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of the School</span>
 You are at the front of the school. You can re-enter the school to the
 south, or cross the street to the north.

>go north

 You gingerly step onto the street. Is it really safe to cross without
 the guard?

 Yeah, who are you kidding. You boldly stride across the street and
 manage to cross safely, because there aren't any cars driving by that
 can run you over.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Across the Street</span>
 You are across the street from the school. You can see the school in
 all its glory to the south.

 You can see a rock here.

>take rock

 Taken.

>examine rock

 You see nothing special about the rock.

>examine school

 You can see the front side of the school from here. It's not a sight
 you see often, given that you usually enter and exit the school from
 the side.

>exits

 You can only go south.

>go south

 Without the guard here, you cross the street with reckless abandon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front of the School</span>
 You are at the front of the school. You can re-enter the school to the
 south, or cross the street to the north.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quad</span>
 You are at the quad, a courtyard in the center of the school. From
 here, you can go north to the front of the school, northwest to the
 library, west to the western building, southwest to the parking lot,
 south to the southern building, and east to the gym.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 The library is usually a quiet place, but today it seemed even quieter
 than normal. The ambient sounds of the librarian moving around or of
 students murmuring to each other was strangely absent. Bookshelves are
 lined up, filling most of the room, and a sign on one wall compels you
 to be as quiet as possible. From here, you can go south to the western
 building or southeast to the quad.

 A boy is here, reading a novel.

>examine sign

 The sign reads "SILENCE IS GOLDEN". You feel compelled to speak
 quietly, despite the fact that the librarian isn't even here.

>examine boy

 The boy appears to be of high school age, though probably younger than
 you. He's currently reading a novel.

>examine novel

 The novel that the boy is reading. The novel happens to be the sort
 without any sort of distinguishing features on the cover, so you have
 no way of knowing what it is.

>talk to boy

 "Hello," you say quietly to the boy. You wait for a bit, but he
 doesn't look up from his book. Maybe if you tried again?

 You hear the sound of a page being turned.

>again

 "Um, hello," you say, a little louder, but the boy still doesn't look
 up. Frustrated, you wave your hands wildly until you finally get his
 attention.

 He looks up at you, points to his ear and to his mouth, and then
 shrugs.

 Huh. Does that mean he's deaf?

>again

 You try to talk to the boy again, but he just shrugs at you.

>give phone to boy

 Which do you mean, the smartphone or your cell phone?

>smartphone

 He looks at the smartphone and shrugs at you.

>give cell phone to boy

 He looks at your cell phone and shrugs at you.

>show rock to boy

 He looks at the rock and shrugs at you.

>examine books

 You stride over to the shelves and choose a book at random. You're not
 really fond of the book's genre, so you put it back. Besides, the
 librarian doesn't seem to be here, so it's not like you can check out
 books, anyway.

>rock

 You hold out your fist, but nothing happens.

>scissors

 You hold out your index and middle fingers, but nothing happens.

>paper

 You hold out your open hand, but nothing happens.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Quad</span>
 You are at the quad, a courtyard in the center of the school. From
 here, you can go north to the front of the school, northwest to the
 library, west to the western building, southwest to the parking lot,
 south to the southern building, and east to the gym.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Building Hallway</span>
 You walk into the western building of the school. The walls of this
 hallway are lined with lockers, and the classrooms are mostly empty
 and locked, with the exception of one room to the west which still has
 its light on. The library is to the north. You can also exit south to
 the parking lot or east to the quad.

 You can see a girl waiting in front of the door.

>examine girl

 You don't think you've seen her before. She looks pretty young, so
 you're guessing she's a freshman.

>talk to girl

 "What's up?" you ask.

 "Oh, um, I'm supposed to be meeting with Mr. Russo in this room for
 something," she says. "But the door is locked, and nobody's responding
 when I knock, so I'm not really sure what to do."

 "Hmm. Maybe try knocking again?"

 She sighs. "It's not like there's anything else I can do."

>knock on door

 You knock on the door.

 The girl knocks on the door.

>examine door

 You see nothing special about the Room 309 door.

 The girl knocks on the door.

>go west

 (first opening the Room 309 door)
 It seems to be locked.

 You hold out your open hand, but nothing happens.

 The girl knocks on the door.

>talk to girl

 "By the way, what was your name again?"

 "It's Jayma. Nice to meet you."

 Jayma knocks on the door.

>again

 "I wish there was something I could do to help."

 "Don't worry about it. Mr. Russo has never been the most reliable
 person."

>again

 "I wish there was something I could do to help."

 "Don't worry about it."

>go west

 (first opening the Room 309 door)
 It seems to be locked.

 Jayma knocks on the door.

>exits

 You can only go north, south, east, or west.

>knock door with rock

 I only understood you as far as wanting to knock the Room 309 door.

>rock

 You hold out your fist, but nothing happens.

>give rock to girl

 "Um, I'm not sure how that can help."

 Jayma knocks on the door.

>hit door with rock

 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the Room 309 door.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Parking Lot</span>
 You are in one of the two parking lots at your school, with this one
 being on the west side. You can go north to enter the western building
 or east to enter the southern building. You can also go northeast to
 the quad or southeast to go behind the school.

 A single car is parked in the lot. Leaning against the hood of the car
 is who you presume to be its owner. You believe his name is Brad.

>examine car

 Brad's car. Well, you're pretty sure it's Brad's car, unless he
 decided to lean on a random one that wasn't his. It seems to have been
 used for a while.

 Brad drums his fingers on his thigh.

>examine brad

 A senior at your school. If you remember correctly, he used to be on
 the basketball team, but rumor has it that he was kicked off for being
 too aggressive. In any case, he looks like he's in a bad mood right
 now, so you probably don't want to do anything to provoke him.

>talk to brad

 "Um, hey, how's it going?" you ask cautiously. Brad turns to look at
 you, and takes some time before responding, possibly to assess whether
 you're a threat or not.

 "I'm waiting for my girlfriend," he says.

 You wait for him to elaborate, but it doesn't seem like he plans on
 saying anything more.

>show smartphone to brad

 "Hey, wait, that's my girlfriend's phone!"

 "Uh, it's mine," you lie expertly.

 "Are you sure? It looks a lot like her case. She's always looking at
 her phone when we're on dates, so I remember it pretty well."

 "I'm pretty sure it's just a coincidence," you say, quickly putting
 the phone away.

 Brad shifts to be in a slightly different position from before.

>give phone to brad

 Which do you mean, the smartphone or your cell phone?

>smartphone

 "It really does look like my girlfriend's phone, though."

 Brad scratches his chin.

>talk to brad

 "Um, if you're looking for your girlfriend, you might want to check
 the other parking lot," you suggest.

 He looks at you like you're the world's biggest idiot. "Uh, there's
 only one parking lot at this school," he says.

 You consider correcting him, but you decide you don't really want to
 argue with him.

 Brad drums his fingers on his thigh.

>give my phone to brad

 (the smartphone to Brad)
 "It really does look like my girlfriend's phone, though."

>give cell phone to brad

 "What, are you asking for my phone number? I have a girlfriend, you
 know."

 Brad shifts to be in a slightly different position from before.

>phone chloe

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>take selfie

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a rock
   a smartphone
   your cell phone

 Brad scratches his chin.

>show rock to brad

 "What do you want me to do with that, huh!?"

>talk to brad

 You think about saying something else to Brad, but you decide not to
 risk making his bad mood worse.

 Brad drums his fingers on his thigh.

>examine fingers

 You can't see any such thing.

 You are carrying:
   a rock

 Brad shifts to be in a slightly different position from before.

 You can't see any such thing.

>exits

 You can only go north, east, northeast, or southeast.

 Brad drums his fingers on his thigh.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern Building Hallway</span>
 You walk into the southern building of the school. Most of the
 classrooms are empty and locked, but one classroom to the east still
 appears to have its light on. You can also exit north to the quad or
 west to the parking lot.

 The walls are lined with lockers, and you can see your own locker
 among them.

>examine locker

 Your locker. This year, it's too far from any of your classes to use
 normally, so you've found another use for it.

>open locker

 You open your locker, revealing a shrine and an altar.

>examine shrine

 Since you weren't using this locker for anything else, you decided to
 build a small shrine to the gods and house it here. You've made small
 figures to represent each of the three goddesses enshrined here:
 Petra, Charti, and Psalidi.

>examine petra

 Petra, the goddess of rock. Rock evokes imagery of hardened stone or
 tall, rugged mountains, and the fist makes you think of punching or
 fistfights. Consequently, Petra is the most durable of the three
 goddesses, as well as the most aggressive.

>examine charti

 Charti, the goddess of paper. Paper on its own can be considered
 flimsy, but through paper the written word can carry immense power.
 Similarly, Charti is the most unassuming of the three goddesses, but
 she can strike with subtlety and grace when she is least expected.

>examine psalidi

 Psalidi, the goddess of scissors. Scissors can dangerous implements,
 but they are often used as tools for crafting; as such, they represent
 aggression that has been channeled into something constructive. It
 follows that Psalidi is the most creative of the three goddesses,
 finding new and innovative ways to attack.

>examine altar

 A small altar that can support items to use in a sacred ritual.

>put rock on altar

 You put the rock on the altar.

>pray

 You should probably find some offerings for the gods before performing
 the ritual.

>close locker

 You close your locker.

>go south

 You can only go north, east, or west.

>go east

 (first opening the Room 415 door)
 It seems to be locked.

>examine door

 You see nothing special about the Room 415 door.

 After a moment, the door opens, and you are face-to-face with your
 friend Sarah.

 "Oh, it's just you," she says.

 "You could sound more excited to see me."

 She rolls her eyes. "Well, I should've known that it was you. I can't
 think of anyone else that will try and enter every door they see.
 Here, I'll leave the door open, so you can come in whenever." Sarah
 props open the door and goes back inside the room.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Room 415</span>
 Room 415 is a science room, so instead of the usual chairs and tables,
 there are lab benches and stools. The benches are clear except for
 one, which is occupied.

 Sarah is sitting at the bench, studying.

>examine sarah

 Sarah is another one of your friends. The two of you often clash over
 a difference in opinion, but despite it you remain good friends.

 Sarah is currently studying.

>talk to sarah

 "What are you doing in here, anyway?" you ask.

 "Mr. Petridis told me that I could stay in this room and study as long
 as I lock up properly when I leave," Sarah says. "Well, although the
 door locks on its own anyway. It just opens from the inside."

>again

 "You have a teacher named Mr. Petri Dish?"

 "It's Mr. Petridis," says Sarah, rolling her eyes.

>again

 "Oh, by the way," says Sarah. "Did you ever meet up with David? He
 said he was looking for you."

 "Um, no," you lie masterfully.

>again

 "I know you want to talk and stuff, but I should really get back to
 studying," Sarah says.

>show cell phone to sarah

 "Is the camera on that thing still busted? You really should get a new
 one."

>show cellphone to sarah

 "Is the camera on that thing still busted? You really should get a new
 one."

>show smartphone to sarah

 Sarah's eyes light up when you show her the smartphone. "Is that a new
 phone?" she asks. "You can finally get a new picture of me for your
 background! Here, take a picture of me," she commands, posing for a
 picture with her usual pose.

>rock

 You hold out your fist, and once again, the world starts to shake.
 Sarah looks at you as a vortex yawns open and beings to inhale
 everything around it, sending papers flying into the air.

 "Seriously?" she shouts over the crackling of the vortex. "What, are
 you offering people as sacrifices to the gods so you can win at that
 rock-paper-scissors competition?"

 You start to say something in response, but she shakes her head.
 "Whatever. Hope everything works out for you. I'm out."

 She turns and, without looking back, throws up the V sign again before
 walking into the vortex.

 Room 415 is a science room with lab benches and stools. One bench
 still has a pencil case sitting on top of it.

>take case

 Taken.

>open it

 You open the pencil case, revealing a blue pen, a red pen, a black
 pen, a mechanical pencil, a wooden pencil, a lead refill, an eraser, a
 pair of scissors, a glue stick, some white-out, a yellow highlighter,
 a pink highlighter, an orange highlighter, a ruler, and a pack of

 A single car is parked in the lot. Brad leans against the hood of the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back of the School</span>
 You find yourself behind the southern building at the back of the
 school. The first thing you notice as you approach is the awful smell
 of cigarette smoke. The source of it is leaning casually against the
 wall next to a dumpster. There is a sign affixed on the wall above
 him. You can go northwest back to the western parking lot.

 The smoker sees you approaching and blows smoke in your direction,
 which you try not to breathe in.

>examine smoker

 The smoker appears rather unkempt, wearing a tank top and sweatpants
 and holding a cigarette between two fingers. Does he even go to this
 school? He looks a little too old to be in high school.

 You try to withstand it, but the stench overpowers you. You cover your
 nose and hurry back the way you came. Besides, if you stayed there too
 long, you would probably have gotten lung cancer or something from all
 the secondhand smoke.

 The smoker is leaning against the wall next to a dumpster.

>rock

 You hold out your fist, and once again, the world starts to shake.
 Crackling with energy, a vortex opens on the wall behind the smoker.

 No longer having a wall to lean on, the smoker falls backwards into
 the vortex. The vortex thoughtfully lingers for a little while longer
 to vacuum the smoke out of the air before closing.

 Rock beats scissors.

 the parking lot or east to the quad.

 You can see Jayma waiting in front of the door.

 Jayma knocks on the door.

>paper

 You hold out your open hand, and once again, the world starts to
 shake. The doors shake and the lockers rattle noisily as a vortex
 opens below Jayma.

 She seems to hover over the vortex, her fist still raised in the air,
 before she plummets down into the vortex with an ear-piercing shriek,
 which echoes in the halls a little while longer before finally falling
 silent.

 Paper beats rock.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[press any key to continue]</span>After a moment, the door that was

 "What's going on?" asks Mr. Russo, yawning. "I thought I heard
 somebody being murdered out here."

 You shrug at him, and he scratches his head. "Maybe it was just my
 imagination." He yawns again and goes back inside, leaving the door
 open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Room 309</span>
 The classroom is rather unextraordinary, with the only thing of note
 being Mr. Russo's desk in the corner. Even from far away, you can tell
 that the desk is a disorganized mess. You can exit the classroom to
 the east.

 Mr. Russo sits at his desk, grading papers.

 Mr. Russo underlines a sentence on the paper in front of him and makes
 a note.

>talk to russo

 "So how are you, Mr. Russo?" you ask.

 "Oh, I'm fine. Just working on grading these papers." He glances over
 the numerous sticky notes stuck to his desk. "It looks like I'm also
 waiting for a student of mine to come in so we can discuss her
 grades."

 "Cool," you say.

 Mr. Russo blinks, struggling to stay awake.

>take paper

 "I would prefer if you didn't touch anything on my desk right now,"
 says Mr. Russo without looking up to see what you were reaching for.

 Mr. Russo closes his eyes, and his head droops forward.

>talk to russo

 "Mr. Russo—" you begin, and Mr. Russo wakes with a start.

 "Huh? Wha?" He glances around. "Oh, I must have dozed off again." He
 yawns. "I haven't been getting much sleep lately, so I've been really
 tired, you see. Thanks for waking me up."

 Mr. Russo scrawls something indecipherable in the margins of the paper
 in front of him.

 Looking closer at the desk does not make it seem any less chaotic. A
 pile of papers covers most of the surface, with graded and ungraded
 papers all mixed together. You can see the corner of a textbook
 peeking out from within the pile. A corner of the desk is littered
 with sticky notes with various reminders. There is also a computer
 monitor on the desk.

 Mr. Russo underlines a sentence on the paper in front of him and makes
 a note.

 A computer monitor. It is turned off. Since the monitor is here,
 you're guessing a keyboard and mouse are hidden under the papers
 somewhere.

 Mr. Russo stifles a yawn with an open hand.

 A boy is here, reading a novel.

 You wave your hands again to get the boy's attention. He looks up from
 his novel.

 You decide to attempt communication with the boy using your recently
 learned knowledge of sign language basics. "Hello, how are you?" you
 sign. The boy recognizes your clumsy signing and responds with a
 simple "I'm fine" in response.

 "What is your name?" you try signing.

 The boy fails to hide an amused smile before he starts to slowly spell
 out the letters to his name.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southern Building Hallway</span>
 You are in the southern building of the school. Most of the classrooms
 are empty and locked, but one classroom to the east still appears to

 The classroom is rather unextraordinary, with the only thing of note

 Mr. Russo sits at his desk, dozing.

 Mr. Russo sits at his desk, dozing.

>examine door

 You see nothing special about the Room 309 door.

>examine desk

 Looking closer at the desk does not make it seem any less chaotic. A
 pile of papers covers most of the surface, with graded and ungraded
 papers all mixed together. A corner of the desk is littered with
 sticky notes with various reminders. There is also a computer monitor
 on the desk.

 Mr. Russo snores gently.

>clean desk

 You rub the desk.

>keyboard

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>look under desk

 You find nothing of interest.

>examine keyboard

 A computer monitor. It is turned off. Since the monitor is here,
 you're guessing a keyboard and mouse are hidden under the papers
 somewhere.

>look under papers

 You find nothing of interest.

 Mr. Russo snores gently.

>turn on monitor

 It isn't something you can switch.

>push monitor

 It is fixed in place.

>talk to russo

 "Mr. Russo—" you begin, and Mr. Russo wakes with a start.

 "Huh? Wha?" He glances around. "Oh, I must have dozed off again.
 Thanks for waking me up."

>again

 "Need help with anything?" you ask.

 "Oh, no, I'm all right. Thanks for the offer, though."

 Mr. Russo scrawls something indecipherable in the margins of the paper
 in front of him.

>again

 "Need help with anything?" you ask.

 "Oh, no, I'm all right. Thanks for the offer, though."

 Mr. Russo underlines a sentence on the paper in front of him and makes
 a note.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a sign language textbook
   a pencil case (closed)
   a smartphone
   your cell phone

 Mr. Russo stifles a yawn with an open hand.

>scissors

 You hold out your index and middle fingers, and once again, the world
 starts to shake. A vortex opens behind Mr. Russo, and loose papers and
 sticky notes are sucked in.

 Mr. Russo grabs his desk to avoid being pulled in, but the force of
 the vortex overpowers him. The desk topples over with a resounding
 crash, and Mr. Russo flies into the vortex, screaming.

 Scissors beats paper.

 You put your hands together in front of you and kneel.

 You offer a prayer to Petra, asking for her strength and power. You
 offer a prayer to Charti, asking for her elegance and poise. You offer
 a prayer to Psalidi, asking for her sharpness and inspiration. And you
 pray to the three of them: a prayer for victory in the upcoming
 trials, and an entreaty that your offerings are provided safe passage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gym</span>
 The competition is starting.

 A small crowd of spectators has formed, and several other participants
 have arrived while you were out. But you aren't too concerned—to you,
 they're just appetizers before the main dish.

 You comb through the participants and lock eyes with your target: the
 current president of the Rock-Paper-Scissors Club. You look into each
 other's eyes for what seems like an eternity, but then they blink and
 look away.

 You're definitely going to beat them.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[press any key to continue]</span>

 And now you find yourself in the finals.

 The small fry were indeed easy to beat—you probably didn't even need
 the help of the gods to take care of them. But you definitely need it
 right now, going head-to-head with the club president.

 The air is charged with tension. The club president glares at you,
 trying to divine what you will play. The referee opens her mouth.

 You can feel the blessing of Petra, the goddess of rock, guiding you.

 "Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"

>rock

 You play rock.

 Your opponent plays scissors.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[press any key to continue]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[press any key to continue]</span>The tension in the air recedes as
 everyone takes stock of the results. Then, the gym breaks out into
 mild applause, and the referee takes your arm and holds it up into the
 air, declaring you the victor of the competition. You feel your
 blessings melt away from you, having fulfilled their purpose.

 The club president looks frustrated, but only for a moment. Then they
 grin at you and begin clapping as well.

 "Congratulations," they say.

 tightening around you, mutating into curses. For abusing the gifts of

 a draw over and over and over again.

 president is staring at you with a bewildered expression. "Wh— How—

 You shake your head and smile at them, and you turn away as they are

 And off to the side you can see David and Sarah, who wave at you when
 you spot them.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[press any key to continue]</span>"Good game," says David.

 "Thanks," you say, giving him a fist bump. You hold out your fist to

 It's been almost a year since you've tasted that defeat and
 humiliation. You were forced to resign in disgrace, and another took

 But this time will be different. This time, you'll definitely be
 guaranteed victory, as long as you pray to the gods for help.

 And no one will be able to stop you.

 The gym is barely different from what you remember from your
 infrequent visits. The only differences you can notice are the banner
 hanging from the wall and some tables set up in preparation for the
 event to take place later. You can exit the gym to the south.

 You can see some club members here.

 Your best friend David is here. It seems like he was waiting for you.

 "Well, you're entering the competition today, right? I just wanted to
 wish you good luck."

 "Oh, yeah, thanks."

 "Also, I wanted to say that, well, after last time... Just, winning
 isn't everything, you know? It's okay even if you don't win."

 "Of course," you say, but you don't really mean it.

 "Um, that's it, then! Good luck in the competition!" He raises his
 fist. "How about a fist bump?"

 You hold out your index and middle fingers. In the next instant, a
 hole in reality opens, swallowing you whole.

 vortex, which snaps shut after him.
