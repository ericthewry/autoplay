 Man, what a party! That was a night to remember - actually it'll be a
 miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm
 Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way
 back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and
 the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best
 to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use
 something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but
 something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the
 forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it...
 Goldilocks is a FOX!

 In the enchanted forest
 A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What
 it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there
 are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme
 going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every
 other direction are, well, trees.
 An old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.

>inventory
 I am carrying:
   a wristwatch (being worn)
   a "distressed" Laura Ashley dress (being worn)

>examine pedlar
 He looks distictly shifty - he'd look more at home on a market stall
 in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest.
 The pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.

>examine bunions
 I'd rather not, thankyou.

>examine suitcase
 I don't think this guy's planning to take a holiday, so it must be
 where he keeps his wares.

>examine watch
 It is about 5:04 AM.

>ask pedlar about wares
 'Beans! Get your magic beans! Only one cow a packet!'

>sell watch to pedlar
 I only understood you as far as wanting to sell the wristwatch.

>sell watch
 I can't sell that!

>sell dress
 I can't sell that!

>ask pedlar about cow
 'That's right love, just one cow for a whole packet. Bargain.'

>ask pedlar about beans
 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'

>ask pedlar about magic
 'Beans! Get your magic beans! Only one cow a packet!'

>examine me
 I'm about 5' 10", 19 years old with stripey tights and Doc Martens,
 and I'm named after my really cool strawberry blonde dreadlocks.
 Basically I'm a Fox, but you knew that already.

>go south

 On a path in the forest
 I'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its
 way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there
 are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an
 anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!

>wave
 I wave, feeling foolish.

>wave at trees
 I can't see any such thing.

>examine tree
 There's really not a lot I can say about them except that they're
 tall, they're made of wood, and they're absolutely bloody everywhere!

>climb tree
 I don't see much point in doing that. Besides, I'd only ladder my
 tights!

>talk to pedlar
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>ask pedlar about me
 I can't see any such thing.

>go south

 Lost in the forest
 I'm wandering in the forest lost and completely disorientated!
 Everywhere I look there are strange, twisted trees, and what's more
 they all look exactly the same! I'm beginning to think it was a really
 bad idea to leave the path...

>verbose
 Goldilocks is a FOX! is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives
 long descriptions of locations (even if I've been there before).

>smell
 I smell nothing unexpected.

 Uh-oh - what's that? I could have sworn I saw a pair of big, yellow
 eyes staring at me through the leaves...

>poke eyes
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine wolf
 I can't see any such thing.

>howl
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine eyes

>wolf whistle
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west

 Lost in the forest
 I'm walking in a trackless wilderness of tall, straight trees whose
 mighty trunks remind me of the time I got lost among the Axminsters at
 CarpetWorld aged six. I can go in just about any direction, but they
 all look the same to me.

>go north

 On a path in the forest
 I'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its
 way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there
 are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an
 anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!

>go west
 As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out
 from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a
 menacing way.
    'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he
 adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the
 way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and
 then slaps his forehead.
    'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I
 seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back
 into the forest.


 At a fork in the path
 I'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort
 where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path
 widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.

>go east

 'Beans! Get your magic beans! Only one cow a packet!'

>ask pedlar about wolf
 'Lots of wolves around here, love. Got to be careful, you have. Nearly
 got eaten by one myself, I did. But see, I'm clever. Canny. Outsmarted
 him, love. They're none too bright, your average wolf.'

>ask pedlar about beans
 'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'

>ask pedlar about cow
 'That's right love, just one cow for a whole packet. Bargain.'

>ask pedlar about tree
 'Do you know what? I hadn't even noticed them. Want to buy some
 beans?'

>get beans
 I can't see any such thing.

>go west
 I'm pretty sure that's the direction I came from when I entered the
 forest, so let's go a different way.

>go south

>go north

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.

>read sign
 THREE BEARS' COTTAGE

 Trespassers will be prostrate.

>examine cottage
 Talk about bijou! It's not much bigger than a shoebox. There's a
 little chimney on the roof.

>examine stones
 A crazy-paving path that leads around the side of the house towards a
 small garden. It's lined by rows of large stones that have for some
 reason been painted white. Somebody's been watching too many of those
 gardening programmes on TV.

>search stones
 I find nothing of interest.

>take stone
 I can't see any such thing.

>take stones
 That's hardly portable.

>go west

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow.

>examine plot
 It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of
 leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an
 overripe pumpkin.

>examine pond
 The Three Bears' attempt at a 'water feature' is rather small and
 choked with pond weed. I think I see something small and green moving
 below the surface!

>get pumpkin
 Taken.

>examine leaves
 Just sticking out of the ground. Wacky. I wonder who put them there.

>get leaves
 I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops
 out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some
 kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always
 thought these things came from tins!

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>examine root
 It's big and lumpy and covered in mud. Do people actually eat these
 things?

>clean root
 I achieve nothing by this.

>inventory
 I am carrying:
   a turnip
   an overripe pumpkin
   a wristwatch (being worn)

 There's not enough water to swim in.

 There's nothing suitable to drink here.

 Two things: One; the pond is only two feet deep. Two; I'm not swimming
 in a murky bloody pond. Okay?

>put root in pond
 I'd need a pretty good reason for chucking something in a pond, 'cos
 I'm not wading in there after a turnip.

>examine pumpkin
 It's a little on the squishy side - no good even for making jack o'
 lanterns now.

>break pumpkin
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>eat pumpkin
 I think I'll pass on that, thankyou.

>eat turnip
 Aren't you supposed to cook these things first?

>examine shed
 It's a ramshackle structure that was obviously cobbled together in
 five minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.

>examine pergola
 It leads into a small meadow bounded by a rickety fence.

>enter shed

 In the potting shed
 I'm in the potting shed, a ramshackle structure that was obviously
 cobbled together in five minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.  I didn't
 know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers
 at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily
 and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.
 In the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'

 I can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.

>examine secateurs
 A pair of pruning clippers, for pruning things I guess. What does
 pruning have to do with prunes? The pair of secateurs are covered in
 rust.

>get it
 That's hardly portable.

>get them
 Taken.

>get paintbrush
 Taken.

>examine it
 I've seen more hair on a skinhead but at a pinch it's probably still
 serviceable.

>examine box
 I can't see any such thing.

>examine tackle
 I can't see any such thing.

>examine trunk
 It's a battered old thing with the words 'FISHING TACKLE' crudely
 painted on the lid. The old metal trunk is closed.

>open it
 I open the trunk. It contains some sticks of dynamite. If this is what
 Papa Bear thinks of as fishing tackle I dread to think what he uses
 for hunting - a Sherman tank, perhaps?

>get dynamite
 Taken.

>examine pots
 The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.

>search pots
 I find a trowel and a pair of gardening gloves, which I take.

>move pots
 Those are fixed in place.

>score
 I have so far scored 3 out of a possible 100, in 79 turns.

 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow.

>examine dynamite
 There are three sticks, each about six inches long and an inch in
 diameter. The fuses are extremely short, as though some evil rodent
 has been nibbling at them!

>light dynamite
 I'm sorry, I don't know how to do that without matches. I was in the
 girl scouts, but they kicked me out after two weeks.

>go north

 In a small meadow
 I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the
 forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears
 to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled
 pergola, is the garden.
 Daisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful
 of hay.

>examine turbine
 It appears to be a 5 KW battery-charging turbine made from wood, old
 tractor parts and a washing machine motor, probably connected to the
 cottage by an underground cable. See - I'm not just a pretty face!
 (Though you have to admit, I am pretty.) The sails are not currently
 moving since the air is completely still.

 There is what appears to be an oil can sitting on a platform near the
 top of the turbine.

>get can
 I can't reach it from here! It's all the way up on top of that rickety
 structure!

>climb turbine
 There's no way I'm going up there! It's a deathtrap!

>examine daisy
 Must be the oddest looking cow I've ever seen! She has four knees! I
 strongly suspect that it might be two men in a suit, but it is to all
 intents and purposes, a cow.

>examine fence
 Presumably it's intended to keep the fearsome forest animals from
 getting into the meadow and molesting Daisy, but it doesn't look
 particularly effective.

>ask daisy about turbine
 "Mooooo!"

>take daisy
 I don't suppose Daisy the cow would care for that.

>daisy, s
 Daisy the cow has better things to do.

>daisy, follow me
 There is no reply.

>push daisy
 Placing both hands on Daisy's hind quarters I brace myself and shove
 her as hard as I can. Daisy moos discontentedly and remains
 obstinately where she is.

>show turnip to daisy
 Daisy jumps up and down excitedly when she sees the turnip. I don't
 think I've ever seen a cow do that before!

>pull daisy
 That would be less than courteous.

>daisy, follow
 There is no reply.

>go south

>give turnip to daisy
 Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and
 nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips
 hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that
 idea.

 Lost in the forest
 I'm lost in the forest, surrounded on all sides by dense foliage. I
 knew it was a bad idea to stray from the path! I can go in any
 direction, but I haven't a clue which is the right one!

 From somewhere comes the blood-curdling howl of a wolf...
 Daisy the cow walks towards me from elsewhere.

 'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from
 his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present
 and correct! Here you go love - you'll be cured in no time!' He opens
 his suitcase and hands me a small packet, then leads Daisy off into
 the forest.

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

 It's a packet of magic beans. There are some instructions written on
 the back of the packet.

 Okay, I watered the magic bean. After a few moments there is a low
 rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...

    Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm
 lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well,
 I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the
 cottage.

 Damn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...

 scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage
 from here.

 On the roof
 I'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying
 desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to
 which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the
 place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen
 poking up above the roofline.

 In the kitchen
 I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have
 come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original
 features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits
 in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall.
 Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
 half the room.

 On the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a
 medium-sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of
 just-right porridge.

>examine dresser
 It's an olde worlde pine number. Looks like it's seen quite a bit of
 use over the years. The kitchen dresser is closed.

>open it
 I open the kitchen dresser, revealing a gigantic bowl.

>examine gigantic bowl
 An earthenware bowl with the word "GRAMPA" glazed on it. It's bigger
 than the large and medium bowls put together. The gigantic bowl is
 empty.

>take gigantic bowl
 Taken.

>pour large into gigantic
 (the large bowl into the gigantic bowl)
 large quantity of hot porridge: I pour the large quantity of hot
 porridge into the gigantic bowl.

>pour medium into gigantic
 (the medium-sized bowl into the gigantic bowl)
 medium quantity of cold porridge: Okay, I poured the cold porridge and
 the hot porridge into the gigantic bowl. Now I have one gigantic bowl
 of JUST-RIGHT porridge! Now why didn't the Three Bears think of that?
 I guess I must be smarter than the average bear!

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>take spoon
 Taken.

>examine tiny
 Which do you mean, the tiny little bowl or the tiny quantity of
 just-right porridge?

>look

 In the kitchen
 I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have
 come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original
 features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits
 in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall.
 Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
 half the room.

 On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized
 bowl (which is empty) and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.

>go south
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move north and east.

>go north

 In the pantry
 I'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of
 cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled
 across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and
 some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's
 porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.

 On the shelf is a matchbox.

 Over in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a
 mousetrap.

 I can't see any such thing.

>get matchbox
 Goldilocks and the Three Bears; the sad tale of a kleptomaniac who
 went too far and collapsed under the weight of her own inventory.
 Taken!

>examine oats
 The bears must spend a fortune on porridge oats - there must be three
 hundred cartons here! I wonder if they save the coupons?

>look in oats
 I find nothing of interest.

>examine mousetrap
 A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to
 harmless little rodents. There's a dead mouse in it right now. He
 seems to have been lured there by a large wedge of cheese.

>get mousetrap
 Fine, fine, no problem - I'll just balance it on top of my head. What
 did your last slave die of?

>open freezer
 I open the freezer, revealing a packet of frozen pork chops.

 There are three pork chops in the packet. Why am I not surprised?

 In the hall
 My first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three
 Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from
 every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew
 to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting
 trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of
 these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the
 bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to
 the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten
 bearskin rug.


 'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the
 direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or
 I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'

>open door
 I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I
 encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting
 this way and that.
    'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it
 won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one
 of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting
 like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited
 two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her
 grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I
 have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs
 it's breakfast time!!'



>give pork to wolf
 'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his
 quivering nose. He recoils in amateur-dramatic horror.
    'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look
 like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I
 am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat
 those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take them away, and
 don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'

>go north
 'Now then,' says the wolf, 'if you've quite finished interrogating me,
 I shall be off in search of those elusive ungulates.'

 In the sitting room
 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three
 Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of
 room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.
 Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair,
 a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

>examine copy
 All the latest gossip on the Fairyland royal family. Let's see; "Who's
 going to be at the Royal Ball?" Hmm. "How to get the Rapunzel look."
 Ho hum. Wait, what's this; "It's the latest craze that's sweeping the
 nation - the must-have toy that every real princess won't want to be
 without. Golden Balls have become the bestselling plaything at
 Geppetto's toy superstore..." Oh, please - what's a princess going to
 do with a ball made of solid gold - she'd only drop it in a pond or
 something!

>examine knick-knacks
 Oh, you know, the usual things - glass animals, plaster models of
 peeing cherubs; the sort of things I would take to a car-boot sale
 rather than bring back from one. They're of no interest to me.

>get knick-knacks
 That's hardly portable.

>go east
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move south.

>examine chair
 Which do you mean, the large chair, the medium-sized chair or the tiny
 little chair?

>large
 It's a huge overstuffed leather affair covered with leather buttons.
 It looks well worn, as though the person it belongs to has nothing
 better to do than sit on a horrible hard chair all day. A filthy
 antimacassar is draped over the back of the chair.

 One of the buttons on the arm looks slightly different from the
 others...

>push button
 Nothing happens. No power!

>examine antimacassar
 A nasty, frilly lacy thing that old people drape over the backs of
 chairs for no good reason. It's old and grubby and is embroidered with
 the initials P.B. There's something underneath it...

>look under it
 I find nothing of interest.

>move it
 Nothing obvious happens.

>take it
 Bloody hell! There are electrodes concealed underneath it! Papa Bear
 must be a little tetchy about other people using his chair - he's
 wired it up to the mains! There's a cable connected to the electrodes
 which presumably supplies the juice.

>get antimacassar
 I already have that.

>examine cable
 I guess Papa Bear's a bit touchy about other people sitting in his
 chair! A cable attached to the electrodes disappears into the back of
 the chair. I think it must supply the power to those electrodes!

>ah
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine medium chair
 It's a disgusting shade of pink with orange flowers but it looks
 really comfortable! If someone really heavy sat on that they'd sink
 without trace!

>examine tiny chair
 A small self-assembly chair of Swedish design that evokes the
 wholesome, healthy lifestyle of the Scandinavian people. On the bottom
 it says 'Made in China.'

 In the hall
 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
 walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with
 some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up
 to the bears' bedroom. The front door is open, but a strong draught
 threatens to blow it shut at any moment. Completing the morbid
 ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.

>examine rug
 A slightly motheaten pelt with wildly staring glass eyes, previously
 worn by Grampa bear I presume. Waste not want not, I suppose, but kind
 of icky all the same. Someone has rather creatively shaved the word
 'welcome' on his back. I wonder if they waited until after he was
 dead...?

>move rug

>look under rug

 I pick up the bearskin rug. Oh,  wow, there's a trapdoor hidden
 underneath the rug! What a stupid place to put it - right in front of
 the front door. Someone could have a nasty accident if they didn't
 know it was there!

>open trapdoor
 I open the trapdoor. A set of rickety wooden stairs lead down into
 darkness.

 It is pitch dark, and I can't see a thing.

>go up

 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the

 threatens to blow it shut at any moment. Just inside the front door is
 an open trapdoor.

>wear rug
 I put on the bearskin rug.

>examine me
 I'm about 5' 10", 19 years old with stripey tights and Doc Martens,
 and I'm named after my really cool strawberry blonde dreadlocks.
 Basically I'm a Fox, but you knew that already.

>go up

 In the bedroom
 I'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply
 sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a
 tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase
 leads down to the hall.
 The Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.
 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
 For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on
 the tiny little bed.

>examine window
 It affords a view of the clearing in front of the house. The window is
 painted shut and doesn't look as though it's been opened in years.
 There's a tiny point of light flitting about outside the window!

>light
 What do you want to light?

>examine light
 I can't see any such thing.

>open window
 Generations of careless decorators have repeatedly painted over the
 catch making it impossible to turn. No matter how hard I try I can't
 open it with my bare hands!

>open window with trowel
 Do you want me to break a nail or something?

>examine sleeping beauty
 She's sprawled across Baby Bear's bed, fast asleep and still wearing
 her party dress. Drunk, I shouldn't wonder. Oi! Beauty! This is my
 fairytale! Hoppit!

>wake her
 I shake her violently and yell in her ear; 'Wakey wakey!' but to no
 avail. She murmurs something in her sleep about a kiss, and then
 resumes snoring. The lazy cow.

>kiss her
 Okay - but this had better work, bozo!

    (I pucker up and give her a big sloppy kiss on the cheek.)

    Yeuch! That was vile! And it didn't work either - it looks as
 though only a kiss from a handsome prince will wake her! Typical
 bloody princess - too fussy for her own good if you ask me!
 The Big Bad Wolf strolls out of the room downwards.

>tiny bed
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine tiny bed
 Ooh, what a sweet 'ickle bed! It looks just big enough for 'ickle ole'
 me, but somebody got there first! It's that lazy cow Sleeping Beauty!
 There's no way I'm snuggling up next to that bimbo!

 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
 For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on
 the tiny little bed.

>examine huge bed
 It's very large and very uncomfortable looking, and is covered by a
 single rather thin looking blanket. Is this guy some kind of masochist
 or what?
 The Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from below.

>examine blanket
 It's threadbare and patched in several places, but otherwise quite
 uninteresting.

>examine medium bed
 This thing has so many quilts and eiderdowns piled on it that I fear
 the frame will give way under the weight. Mama Bear is heading for
 some real back trouble in later life.

>search it
 There is nothing on the medium-sized bed.

>search huge bed
 On the huge bed is a rather thin blanket.

>take blanket
 Wow! Now I understand why the huge bed felt so hard! What better way
 to conceal from your wife the fact that you've spent your family's
 entire annual porridge budget on a full sized snooker table than to
 give up your conjugal rights altogether and disguise it as a bed! Boy,
 could this couple use some marriage guidance!
 The Big Bad Wolf strolls out of the room downwards.

>examine snooker table
 No wonder it was so hard! The "bed" was actually a full sized snooker
 table with pockets and everything...

>examine pockets
 A standard part of your basic snooker table I believe.

>search pockets
 In one of the pockets is a cue ball.

>take cue ball
 Oh great. More junk. We're building up quite a collection, aren't we?

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.
 The Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from below.

>examine cue ball
 Shiny, round and white.

>examine wolf
 What big eyes he has! What big teeth he has!! And what a big...
 ...oh, never mind. For some reason he is dressed as an old woman in a
 bonnet and nightgown, but each to their own, I say.
 'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off downwards.

>ask wolf about beauty
 'Enough talk! There are more important matters at hand - such as
 lunch! Where are those pigs?'

>close trapdoor
 I close the trapdoor.

>examine trophies
 On one of the walls there are several animal heads mounted on wooden
 plaques. It's hard to tell given the appalling quality of the
 taxidermy job, but I'd swear that some of these heads were once human.
 No cuddly teddy bears, these three!

>examine portraits
 One wall is dominated by a rather amateurish painting of the Three
 Bears signed by Mama Bear herself. I can't see her winning the Turner
 Prize anytime soon! The rest are portraits of more distant members of
 the bear clan, including Grampa Bear and Grandma Bear. I guess even
 the three bears have forbears!

 That's odd; for some reason Papa Bear is only wearing one sock.

>examine sock
 I can't see any such thing.

>take portrait
 I can't see any such thing.

>go south
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move north, west, up and out.

 'Well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must
 be off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'

 On the porch
 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing
 in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.


    As I move out onto the porch a draught from somewhere blows the
 door shut behind me!

>go south

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.

>go west

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
 and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.

>climb beanstalk
 If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks!
 At the top of the beanstalk
 I'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these
 giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this
 scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage
 from here.

 where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path
 widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.

>go west

 Lost in the forest
 I'm wandering in the forest lost and completely disorientated!
 Everywhere I look there are strange, twisted trees, and what's more

>go west

 I'm lost in the forest, surrounded on all sides by dense foliage. I
 knew it was a bad idea to stray from the path! I can go in any
 direction, but I haven't a clue which is the right one!

>examine trees
 There's an arrow carved into the bark of one particular tree! It's
 pointing to the west!

>go west

 In the enchanted forest
 A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What
 it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there
 are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme
 going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every
 other direction are, well, trees.

>examine trees
 There's really not a lot I can say about them except that they're

 A cute red squirrel pops out from behind one tree and gestures
 northwards with a tiny thumb before scurrying away.

 On a path in the forest
 I'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its
 way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there
 are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an
 anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!

>go west

>go north

 In a small meadow
 I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the
 forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears
 to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled
 pergola, is the garden.

>examine fence
 Presumably it's intended to keep the fearsome forest animals from
 getting into the meadow and molesting Daisy, but it doesn't look
 particularly effective.

>go north
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move south.

>climb fence
 No thanks, I'd only get lost in the forest.

>examine turbine
 It appears to be a 5 KW battery-charging turbine made from wood, old
 tractor parts and a washing machine motor, probably connected to the
 cottage by an underground cable. See - I'm not just a pretty face!
 (Though you have to admit, I am pretty.) The sails are not currently
 moving since the air is completely still.

 There is what appears to be an oil can sitting on a platform near the
 top of the turbine.

 cue ball misses the oil can completely and lands a short distance
 away.

 Mmmmm! That porridge tasted JUST RIGHT! I feel thoroughly
 invigourated; in fact I could toss a few cabers myself if you know
 what I mean. Wait, that sounded really dodgy. Forget I said it.

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>throw cue ball at oil can
 I hurl the cue ball at the can of oil in the hope of knocking it off
 the platform, but I've never been much good at that sort of thing. the
 cue ball misses the oil can completely and lands a short distance
 away.

>take cue ball
 Yeah, sure, whatever - I'll just tuck it under my chin or something.
 Taken.

 Even if I could climb up there I wouldn't have the strength to move
 those sails!

 There's no way I'm going up there! It's a deathtrap!

>go south

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
 and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.

>wear gloves
 I put on the gloves, but they're much too big for me and feel just a
 little loose!

>examine pond
 The Three Bears' attempt at a 'water feature' is rather small and
 choked with pond weed. I think I see something small and green moving
 below the surface!

>take pond
 I can't fill a milkbottle that's in five hundred pieces!

>ask pond about pond
 I can only do that to something animate.

 I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the

>examine turbine
 It appears to be a 5 KW battery-charging turbine made from wood, old
 tractor parts and a washing machine motor, probably connected to the
 cottage by an underground cable. See - I'm not just a pretty face!
 (Though you have to admit, I am pretty.) The sails are not currently
 moving since the air is completely still.

 There is what appears to be an oil can sitting on a platform near the
 top of the turbine.

 In the potting shed
 I'm in the potting shed, a ramshackle structure that was obviously
 cobbled together in five minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.  I didn't
 know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers
 at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily
 and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.
 In the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'

 I can't go in that direction, but I can move north, east, up and in.

>go east

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.

>go north

 On the porch
 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing
 in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.

>examine porch
 A little thatched porch over the front door. It would be quite pretty
 except that someone has seen fit to paint it gold. Whoever it was has
 obviously seen one too many episodes of "Changing Rooms."

 At the top of the beanstalk
 I'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these
 giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this
 scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage
 from here.

>jump
 Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched
 roof of the cottage...
 On the roof
 I'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying
 desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to
 which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the
 place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen
 poking up above the roofline.

>in
 I can't go in any direction!

>go down
 I can't go in any direction!

>enter chimney
 Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the
 fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?
 In the kitchen
 I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have
 come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original
 features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits
 in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall.
 Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
 half the room.
 The Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.

 On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized
 bowl (which is empty) and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.
 'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off to the north.

>examine fireplace
 Must be where Mama bear cooks all her porridge. I don't know why she
 doesn't just get herself a microwave. The hearth is cold and full of
 ash. Something glints among the embers...
 The Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from the north.

>search ash
 I fish around in the embers until I find an old brass key. What a
 ridiculous place to keep it! I pick it up in case it comes in useful.
 The Big Bad Wolf strolls out of the room to the east.

 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
 walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with
 some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up

 door is a closed trapdoor.

 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
 For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on
 the tiny little bed.

>examine beauty
 She's sprawled across Baby Bear's bed, fast asleep and still wearing
 her party dress. Drunk, I shouldn't wonder. Oi! Beauty! This is my

 I take a match from the box and strike it. The match flares briefly...

 In the cellar
 I'm in a dingy cellar with bare brick walls and the musty smell of a

 the cellar.

 One wall is dominated by a rather amateurish painting of the Three
 Bears signed by Mama Bear herself. I can't see her winning the Turner
 Prize anytime soon! The rest are portraits of more distant members of

 the three bears have forbears!

 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three

 Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair,
 a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

 A small self-assembly chair of Swedish design that evokes the
 wholesome, healthy lifestyle of the Scandinavian people. On the bottom

 wasn't uncomfortable enough already, the chair is fitted with
 electrodes!

 One of the buttons on the arm looks slightly different from the
 others...

>examine electrodes
 I guess Papa Bear's a bit touchy about other people sitting in his
 chair! A cable attached to the electrodes disappears into the back of
 the chair. I think it must supply the power to those electrodes!
 'As much as I've enjoyed chewing the fat with you,' says the wolf,
 'I'd rather be chewing on some crackling. Now where are those pigs?'

 The front door is open. It creaks slightly in the draught.

>examine door
 The front door is open, but a strong draught threatens to blow it shut
 at any moment.

>prop door
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>out

 On the porch
 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing
 in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.


    As I move out onto the porch a draught from somewhere blows the
 door shut behind me!

>examine dustbin
 An environmentally sound way of disposing of all the objects I'm
 finished with. The battered old dustbin is empty.

 I put the crumpled note into the battered old dustbin.

>go south

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.

>go east
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move north, south and west.

>go west

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
 and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.

>examine plot
 It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage.

>go north

 In a small meadow
 I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the
 forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears
 to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled
 pergola, is the garden.

>light pork
 Wowee! Who'd have thought the packet of frozen pork chops would burn
 so well! Uh-oh; the flames are spreading like wildfire - I burned down
 the cottage, the entire forest and everything in it, including me.
 That'll teach me to play with matches!!
 Oh, bollocks. I'm dead!
 I have so far scored 24 out of a possible 100, in 385 turns.

 Would I like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score for
 that game or QUIT?

 It's out of my reach I'm afraid. Papa Bear must have left it up there
 when he built the turbine.

 I hurl the cue ball at the can of oil in the hope of knocking it off

 cue ball misses the oil can completely and lands a short distance

>go up

 At the top of the beanstalk
 I'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these
 giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this
 scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage
 from here.

>jump. enter chimney
 Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched
 roof of the cottage...
 On the roof
 I'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying
 desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to
 which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the
 place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen
 poking up above the roofline.
 Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the
 fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?
 In the kitchen
 I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have
 come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original
 features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits
 in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall.
 Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
 half the room.

 On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized
 bowl (which is empty) and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.
 The Big Bad Wolf prowls into the room from the north.

>go south
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move north and east.

>go east

 In the hall
 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
 walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with
 some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up
 to the bears' bedroom. The front door is closed. Just inside the front
 door is an open trapdoor.

>open door
 The front door is open. It creaks slightly in the draught.

 Okay, I wedged the door open with the stale cheese.

 In the sitting room
 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three
 Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of
 room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.

 A slightly motheaten pelt with wildly staring glass eyes, previously
 worn by Grampa bear I presume. Waste not want not, I suppose, but kind

 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
 For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on
 the tiny little bed.
 So tired...

>lie on medium bed

 A large shadow looms over me...

    Before I can turn around, someone lays a large heavy paw on my

    'Who's been eating my porridge?' snarls Papa Bear.
    'Who's been sitting in my chair?' growls Mama Bear.
    'Who's been planning to sleep off her hangover in my bed, but

 features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits
 in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall.
 Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
 half the room.

 On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized
 bowl (which is empty) and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.

 In the hall
 My first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three
 Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from
 every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew
 to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting
 trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of
 these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the
 bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to
 the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten
 bearskin rug.


 'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the
 direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or
 I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'

>open door
 I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I
 encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting
 this way and that.
    'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it
 won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one
 of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting
 like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited
 two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her
 grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I
 have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs
 it's breakfast time!!'



>wedge door with cheese
 Okay, I wedged the door open with the stale cheese.
 The Big Bad Wolf strolls out of the room to the west.

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>go south
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move north, west, up and out.

>out

 On the porch
 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door has been wedged open.  Just south of me is the
 clearing in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.

>look under porch
 I find nothing of interest.

>examine porch
 A little thatched porch over the front door. It would be quite pretty
 except that someone has seen fit to paint it gold. Whoever it was has
 obviously seen one too many episodes of "Changing Rooms."

>go south

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.

>go west

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
 and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.

>in

 In the potting shed
 I'm in the potting shed, a ramshackle structure that was obviously
 cobbled together in five minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.  I didn't
 know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers
 at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily
 and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs.
 In the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'

>break pots
 Now why would I want to do a thing like that?

>push pots
 Those are fixed in place.

>pull pots
 I can't reach the ones at the top, so I try to pull one out from near
 the bottom. Moments later the entire pile is lying all over the floor
 in fragments.

 to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled
 pergola, is the garden.

 Presumably it's intended to keep the fearsome forest animals from
 getting into the meadow and molesting Daisy, but it doesn't look
 particularly effective.

>examine forest
 It's really quite pretty - the way the early morning sun shines
 through the treetops dappling the forest floor.  I'd like to be able

 Boy Scout leaders...

 widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.

>go east

 On a path in the forest
 I'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its
 way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there
 are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an
 anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!

>go north

 In the enchanted forest
 A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What
 it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there
 are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme
 going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every
 other direction are, well, trees.

 Aren't these things supposed to lead to castles in the clouds with
 giants and stuff? I guess that bean must have been past it's sell-by
 date, but then so was the cow I exchanged it for...

>go up

 At the top of the beanstalk
 I'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these
 giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this
 scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage
 from here.

>jump
 Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched
 roof of the cottage...
 On the roof
 I'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying
 desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to
 which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the
 place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen
 poking up above the roofline.

 Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the
 fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again?

 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three

 a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

 Wowee! Who'd have thought the catch would burn so well! Uh-oh; the

 Oh, bollocks. I'm dead!

>go down

 In the hall
 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
 walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with
 some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up
 to the bears' bedroom. The front door has been wedged open. Just
 inside the front door is an open trapdoor.
 The Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.
 'Little pigs! Little pigs!' calls the Big Bad Wolf as he disappears

 In the cellar
 I'm in a dingy cellar with bare brick walls and the musty smell of a
 laundry room. There is an old upright washing machine in the corner
 and a fusebox on the wall. Steps lead up to the trapdoor in the

 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three

 Three chairs are arranged around a small coffee table; a large chair,
 a medium-sized chair and a tiny little chair.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

 In the kitchen
 I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have
 come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original
 features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits
 in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall.
 Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
 half the room.

 On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized
 bowl (which is empty) and a tiny little bowl of just-right porridge.

 I'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply
 sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a
 tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase

 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
 For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on

 The Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous.

>give pork to wolf
 The wolf grabs the packet of pork chops and tears off the wrapper,
 then rolls on the floor gnawing at them like a dog with an old
 slipper. Moments later, when he has recovered his dignity, he rises to
 his feet and says
    'My dear girl, that was simply exquisite! I am indebted for you for
 that delectable dish! If there is anything I can do in return, simply
 name it, and it will be done! Huffing and puffing a speciality...'

>tell wolf about windmill
 This provokes no reaction.

 The Big Bad Wolf taps his foot impatiently.

>ask wolf about windmill
 'No more of this idle banter! If there is something you wish me to do
 for you, let us attend to it immediately. I am a cunning hunter of the
 wilderness, and have no time to waste in frivolous conversation!'

 The Big Bad Wolf scratches his ear.

 I can't go in that direction, but I can move north, west, up, down and
 out.

 The Big Bad Wolf taps his foot impatiently.

>out

 On the porch
 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door has been wedged open.  Just south of me is the
 clearing in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.
 'Ah, my natural habitat!' says the wolf, 'There really is nothing
 quite like the forest!'

>go west
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move south and in.

 The Big Bad Wolf taps his foot impatiently.

>go south

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.

>go west

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
 and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.

>go north

 In a small meadow
 I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the
 forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears
 to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled
 pergola, is the garden.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.

>wolf, blow
 What do you want the Big Bad Wolf to blow?

>turbine
 'Ah, so you wish to make use of my prodigious talents! I shall huff,
 and I shall puff, and I shall have that turbine turning in a jiffy!'
 True to his word, the wolf huffs, and he puffs, and he blows the
 turbine with a gale-force blast of air that sends it spinning like a
 toy windmill.
    'My debt is paid, dear child - I shall now return to the forest
 which is the natural habitat of a fearsome predator such as I. I bid
 you adieu!' With that he gives a low bow, at which point the oil can
 falls from the top of the turbine and bops him on the head. With a
 cluck of annoyance he hitches up the hem of his nightdress, hops over
 the fence and disappears into the forest.

 tractor parts and a washing machine motor, probably connected to the

 One of the buttons on the arm looks slightly different from the

 I'm in an underground cave. From the decor I'd say this was Papa

 family life. The walls are plastered with posters of football teams

 wall of the cave looks almost impenetrable. There's an electric socket

 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door has been wedged open.  Just south of me is the
 clearing in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.

 I can also see a package (which is closed) here.

>get package
 Goldilocks and the Three Bears; the sad tale of a kleptomaniac who
 went too far and collapsed under the weight of her own inventory.
 Taken!

>examine package
 It's addressed to "Goldilocks, c/o 3 Bears' Cottage, Enchanted Forest,
 Fairyland FL3 7ER." It's a wonder that they managed to find me. In
 fact it's a wonder I even managed to order it in the first place
 considering that the bears don't have cable!

>open package
 I open the package, revealing an electric toaster and a leaflet.

>read leaflet
 "Thankyou for purchasing the toast-o-mastic 3000 atomic 3 - slot
 toaster. This revolutionary gadget allows you to toast not one but
 three slices of bread at the same time... blah blah blah." There is
 some smallprint, but it is illegible to the naked eye.

>examine toaster
 It's a stylish chrome affair with three slots, each about an inch
 wide, and a control lever which can be depressed to activate it. The
 lever is in the off position. The toaster is not plugged in.

>go north
 I can't go in that direction, but I can move south and in.

>in

 In the hall
 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
 walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with
 some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up
 to the bears' bedroom. The front door has been wedged open. Just
 inside the front door is an open trapdoor.

>go north

 In the sitting room
 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three
 Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of
 room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.
 Two chairs are arranged around small coffee table; a large chair and a
 medium-sized chair. There used to be a tiny little chair but I'd
 rather not talk about it. There's a low-pitched hum coming from
 somewhere.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

>sit in large
 Bloody hell! This has got to be the hardest chair I've ever sat in!
 I've only been here two seconds and my buttocks are as numb as a pair
 of frozen fishcakes!

>push button
 (the chair's button)
 Whoa! A hole just opened up in the floor and the chair is carrying me
 down into the bowels of the earth! It's just like something out of a
 James Bond film!

    Ouch! - it's stopped...


 In a cave
 I'm in an underground cave. From the decor I'd say this was Papa
 Bear's private den, a place of sanctuary away from the rigours of
 family life. The walls are plastered with posters of football teams
 and pin-ups from 'Playbear.' A solid metal door, set into the western
 wall of the cave looks almost impenetrable. There's an electric socket
 in the wall next to the door. The large chair is now facing a
 television set and there's a fridge within easy reach of the chair.


    The jolt threw me out of the chair - I guess the mechanism was
 designed for someone much heavier than me!

>plug toaster in socket
 I only understood you as far as wanting to plug the electric toaster
 in.

>plug toaster
 I can't - the TV is plugged in to the only wall socket!

>unplug tv
 Okay, I pulled the plug out of the wall socket.

>turn on toaster
 That's not something I can switch.

>push lever
 Okay, I pushed down the little control lever. Thanks to the toaster's
 atomic reactor the elements heat up instantaneously...

 ...SPROING!!!

 The toaster pops in microseconds. 'Instant toasting satisfaction!'

    'Who's been eating my porridge?' snarls Papa Bear.
    'Who's been planning to sleep off her hangover in my bed, but
 didn't quite get around to it yet?' says Baby Bear. 'Left it a little
 too late, didn't you Goldilocks? Should have kept an eye on the time -
 it's noon and we're back from our walk now, and we're very, very
 upset! What shall we do with her, Pater?'
    'I think she'd look lovely on our trophy wall,' says Papa Bear.

 I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have

 Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill
 half the room.

 On the dining table are a large bowl (which is empty), a medium-sized

 In the pantry
 I'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of
 cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled
 across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and
 some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's
 porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.

 In the hall
 My first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three
 Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from
 every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew
 to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting
 trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of
 these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the
 bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to
 the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten
 bearskin rug.


 'Ding-Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the
 direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or
 I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'

>SAVE

>get rug
 I pick up the bearskin rug. Oh,  wow, there's a trapdoor hidden
 underneath the rug! What a stupid place to put it - right in front of
 the front door. Someone could have a nasty accident if they didn't
 know it was there!

>open trapdoor
 I open the trapdoor. A set of rickety wooden stairs lead down into
 darkness.

>put rug on trapdoor
 Okay, I placed the rug over the trapdoor, so that it looks exactly as
 before - except that the trapdoor is open!


 Somebody is banging on the front door!

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>open door
 I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I
 encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting
 this way and that. Unfortunately he fails to notice the open trapdoor
 concealed under the rug and falls headlong into the cellar with a loud
 crash. Moments later he re-emerges looking meaner than ever.
    'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it
 won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one
 of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting
 like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited
 two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her
 grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I
 have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs
 it's breakfast time!!'

 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door has been wedged open.  Just south of me is the
 clearing in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.
 'Ah, my natural habitat!' says the wolf, 'There really is nothing
 quite like the forest!'

>go south

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.

>go west

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
 and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.

>go north

 In a small meadow
 I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the
 forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears
 to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled
 pergola, is the garden.
 The Big Bad Wolf follows me.

>wolf, blow turbine
 'Ah, so you wish to make use of my prodigious talents! I shall huff,
 and I shall puff, and I shall have that turbine turning in a jiffy!'
 True to his word, the wolf huffs, and he puffs, and he blows the
 turbine with a gale-force blast of air that sends it spinning like a
 toy windmill.
    'My debt is paid, dear child - I shall now return to the forest
 which is the natural habitat of a fearsome predator such as I. I bid
 you adieu!' With that he gives a low bow, at which point the oil can
 falls from the top of the turbine and bops him on the head. With a
 cluck of annoyance he hitches up the hem of his nightdress, hops over
 the fence and disappears into the forest.

 In the sitting room
 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three
 Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of
 room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.
 Two chairs are arranged around small coffee table; a large chair and a
 medium-sized chair. There used to be a tiny little chair but I'd
 rather not talk about it. There's a low-pitched hum coming from
 somewhere.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

 must be a little tetchy about other people using his chair - he's

 which presumably supplies the juice.

 I'm in an underground cave. From the decor I'd say this was Papa
 Bear's private den, a place of sanctuary away from the rigours of
 family life. The walls are plastered with posters of football teams
 and pin-ups from 'Playbear.' A solid metal door, set into the western
 wall of the cave looks almost impenetrable. There's an electric socket
 in the wall next to the door. The large chair is now facing a
 television set and there's a fridge within easy reach of the chair.

 I can see a TV remote control here.

 The layers of ancient paint crack and flake off allowing me to open
 the window. As I do so, a tiny point of light zips into the room from
 outside! It whizzes two or three times around my head and then, with a
 sharp 'ping' transforms itself into a tiny little old lady with wings.
    'Fear not, Cinderella!' She says, staggering slightly as she

 over the pumpkin a couple of times, somewhat uncertainly. After a
 short time the pumpkin begins to swell as though someone were pumping
 it full of air. Then there is a soft, damp 'plop' as the pumpkin
 explodes, showering the two of us with orange goo.
    'Oh dear,' says my Fairy Godmother 'that wasn't quite right! Never
 mind, we'll have to make do without a coach. Perhaps you can ride one

 Which do you mean, the huge bed, the medium-sized bed or the tiny
 little bed?

>huge
 It's very large and very uncomfortable looking, and is covered by a
 single rather thin looking blanket. Is this guy some kind of masochist
 or what?

>get blanket
 Wow! Now I understand why the huge bed felt so hard! What better way
 to conceal from your wife the fact that you've spent your family's
 entire annual porridge budget on a full sized snooker table than to
 give up your conjugal rights altogether and disguise it as a bed! Boy,
 could this couple use some marriage guidance!

>give blanket to godmother

 My Fairy Godmother doesn't seem interested.

 In one of the pockets is a cue ball.

 Goldilocks and the Three Bears; the sad tale of a kleptomaniac who
 went too far and collapsed under the weight of her own inventory.
 Taken!

 Okay, I painted the cue ball gold.

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>go down

 In the hall
 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
 walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with
 some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up
 to the bears' bedroom. The front door has been wedged open. Just
 inside the front door is an open trapdoor.

>out

 On the porch
 I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be
 quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint
 it gold. The front door has been wedged open.  Just south of me is the
 clearing in the forest.
 A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.

 I can also see a package (which is empty) here.

>go south

 In a clearing in the forest
 I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a
 thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a
 fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted sign
 designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A
 little path lined by rows of white-painted stones leads around the
 side of the house to the west.

>go west

 In the garden
 I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot
 in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a
 somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some
 attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and
 more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of
 horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads
 into a meadow. A gigantic beanstalk rises out of the vegetable plot
 and stops abruptly just above the level of the roof.

>put ball in pond
 The ball lands in the pond with a dull plop. A few moments later a
 small green frog emerges from the pond clutching it in one of his
 slimy flippers. He drops it on the grass in front of me and puckers up
 expectantly...

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>kiss frog
 Yeeeuch! Actually he's not a bad smoocher, I've never kissed anyone
 before with such a flexible tongue...
    Whoa! There was a flash of light and the frog just turned into a
 handsome prince!
    'Thanks, babe,' he says, looking me up and down, 'I'd love to hang
 around but I'm off to find me a real princess - I simply must have a
 date for the Royal Ball tonight. Maybe we can do lunch sometime!'
    He runs off towards the forest. I think I preferred him as a frog -
 less slimy!

 In the bedroom
 I'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply
 sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a
 tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a full sized snooker table. A
 narrow staircase leads down to the hall.
 Lying in the middle of the floor with all four legs pointing
 heavenward is a dead coach horse.
 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.
 For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on
 the tiny little bed.

 I can also see my Fairy Godmother here.

     Suddenly he notices Sleeping Beauty sprawled across Baby Bear's
 bed. 'Now that's what I call a REAL princess!' A quick kiss wakes
 Beauty, and the happy couple are off to the cathedral. That's no basis
 for a lasting relationship!

 Okay, so technically she's Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, but what she

 describe as a heavily sequined ballerina's outfit which looks
 hideously wrinkled on her shrivelled frame. Top this off with surgical
 support stockings and a pair of cardboard wings stuck on with
 sellotape, and you get the picture.
 My Fairy Godmother is carrying a magic wand.

 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three

 room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.
 Two chairs are arranged around small coffee table; a large chair and a
 medium-sized chair. There used to be a tiny little chair but I'd
 rather not talk about it. There's a low-pitched hum coming from
 somewhere.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

 Bloody hell! This has got to be the hardest chair I've ever sat in!
 I've only been here two seconds and my buttocks are as numb as a pair

 In a cave
 The cave has been completely devastated by the explosion! Where the
 door used to be there is now a gaping hole in the western wall. The
 walls of the cave, melted by the intensive heat of my homemade atomic

 I'm in a dingy cellar with bare brick walls and the musty smell of a

 and a fusebox on the wall. Steps lead up to the trapdoor in the
 ceiling. A battered old wardrobe stands against the western wall of
 the cellar.

 better days. Probably why it's in the cellar. There's a gentle breeze
 coming from behind the wardrobe! The wardrobe is completely empty.

 This seems to be a small annex to the main part of the cellar.
 Everything about the decor of this place says 'dungeon' to me, from
 the guttering torches to the ragrolled paint effect on the walls
 that's meant to look like ancient stonework. Unfortunately the rotting
 skeleton manacled to the wall is only too real. A sign on the wall
 opposite the skeleton says 'When we say NO TRESPASSERS we mean NO
 TRESPASSERS!' Something for the bears' victims to think about while
 they languish in this dump. The passage leads south back to the
 cellar.

>examine skeleton
 It's wearing a red cape with a hood. I guess this must be the elusive
 Little Red Riding Hood! No wonder she never made it to Grandma's house
 - she must have called at the wrong cottage by mistake, poor little
 twerp!
    Hmm, what's this? There appears to be a blackened metal poker

 the pot should under no circumstances be used in confined spaces!

 Immediately the magic porridge pot begins to fill up with extremely
 hot porridge. It just sort of swirls up from the bottom of the pot
 like an expensive special effect. Within seconds the pot is full and
 the porridge begins to run down the sides...

>alakazoo
 'ALAKAZOO!' I shout at the top of my lungs. At first nothing seems to
 be happening, but after a few moments the flow of porridge slows down,
 and finally stops. The remaining porridge trickles away through cracks
 in the cave floor.

>eat porridge
 That's plainly inedible.
 I'm feeling really sleepy...

>get pot
 The magic porridge pot is far too big and heavy for me to carry! There
 must be another way of moving it.
 I can hardly keep my eyes open...

 In the bedroom
 I'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply
 sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a
 tiny little bed, a medium-sized bed and a full sized snooker table. A
 narrow staircase leads down to the hall.
 Lying in the middle of the floor with all four legs pointing
 heavenward is a dead coach horse.
 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.

 I can also see my Fairy Godmother here.

>ask godmother about dress
 (my Fairy Godmother about that)
 'Oh, yes dear - that was it,' says my Fairy Godmother, 'You can't
 possibly go to the ball looking like that!' I'm a little offended by
 this but decide to bite my lip.    'Wait a second while I reprogram my
 wand.' After a few moments she raises the wand and waves it
 frantically as though it were stuck to her hand and she were desperate
 to get rid of it. There is a sudden, bright flash and my dress
 disappears in a puff of smoke!
    'Oh dear,' says my Fairy Godmother with a frown, 'that's not the
 rags-to-ballgown spell, it's the one for moving stuff down to the
 cellar, I used it last weekend when I cleared out the spare room. I'm
 sorry my dear, I shall have to go home and get my spell book. I'd
 forget my wings if they were't sellotaped on.'    There is another
 flash and she turns back into a tiny point of light, before flitting
 back out of the window. As she does so, something silvery clatters to
 the floor.

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>get wand
 Fine, fine, no problem - I'll just balance it on top of my head. What
 did your last slave die of?

>go down

 In the hall
 I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the
 walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with
 some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up
 to the bears' bedroom. The front door has been wedged open. Just
 inside the front door is an open trapdoor.

>go down

 In the cellar
 I'm in a dingy cellar with bare brick walls and the musty smell of a
 laundry room. There is an old upright washing machine in the corner
 and a fusebox on the wall. Steps lead up to the trapdoor in the
 ceiling. A battered old wardrobe stands against the western wall of
 the cellar.

 I can see a "distressed" Laura Ashley dress here.

>get dress
 Goldilocks and the Three Bears; the sad tale of a kleptomaniac who
 went too far and collapsed under the weight of her own inventory.
 Taken!

>wear it
 I put on the "distressed" Laura Ashley dress.

>move wardrobe
 Okay.... Oof! I moved it. Oh, wow! There's a gothic archway behind
 here leading into some kind of hidden room! The words 'Baby Bear's
 Playroom' are painted above the arch!

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>go west

 In a dark passage
 I'm in a dark passage carved into the rock. It curves around to the
 north.

>go north

 In a dungeon
 This seems to be a small annex to the main part of the cellar.
 Everything about the decor of this place says 'dungeon' to me, from
 the guttering torches to the ragrolled paint effect on the walls
 that's meant to look like ancient stonework. Unfortunately the rotting
 skeleton manacled to the wall is only too real. A sign on the wall
 opposite the skeleton says 'When we say NO TRESPASSERS we mean NO
 TRESPASSERS!' Something for the bears' victims to think about while
 they languish in this dump. The passage leads south back to the
 cellar.

>examine skeleton
 It's wearing a red cape with a hood. I guess this must be the elusive
 Little Red Riding Hood! No wonder she never made it to Grandma's house
 - she must have called at the wrong cottage by mistake, poor little
 twerp!
    Hmm, what's this? There appears to be a blackened metal poker
 shoved up her, um, actually you don't want to know where it was
 shoved. Ouch.

 I've taken the poker in case it comes in useful.

>open machine with poker
 I jam the poker in the door of the machine and give it a good hard
 push. There is a sharp crack and the door flies open!  Who was it said
 that brute force never achieved anything?

 However, the washing machine contains nothing but sludge.

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

 Hidden in the sludge at the bottom of the drum, I find a small key,

 In the sitting room
 From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick-knacks, The Three
 Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of
 room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.
 Two chairs are arranged around small coffee table; a large chair and a
 medium-sized chair. There used to be a tiny little chair but I'd
 rather not talk about it. There's a low-pitched hum coming from
 somewhere.

 On the small coffee table is a copy of 'Hail!' magazine.

>sit in large chair
 Bloody hell! This has got to be the hardest chair I've ever sat in!
 I've only been here two seconds and my buttocks are as numb as a pair
 of frozen fishcakes!

>push button
 (the chair's button)
 Whoa! A hole just opened up in the floor and the chair is carrying me
 down into the bowels of the earth! It's just like something out of a
 James Bond film!

    Ouch! - it's stopped...


 In a cave
 The cave has been completely devastated by the explosion! Where the
 door used to be there is now a gaping hole in the western wall. The
 walls of the cave, melted by the intensive heat of my homemade atomic
 bomb are still glowing faintly. Of the television set there is no
 sign. The fridge is lying on its side, smoking slightly.


    The jolt threw me out of the chair - I guess the mechanism was
 designed for someone much heavier than me!

 In Papa Bear's workshop
 This must be where Papa Bear does all his D.I.Y. It's a small but tidy
 workshop with a bench and an old filing cabinet in the corner. Pinned
 to the walls are what appear to be the blueprints for various devices.
 Sitting in the middle of the floor is a huge wooden crate, stencilled
 with the words: "DANGER: PROTOTYPE!"

>pry crate with poker
 Using the poker like a crowbar I wrench the crate apart at the seams.
 It collapses to reveal a strange cauldron-like contraption inside.

>read instructions
 It appears to be the operating instructions for a magic porridge pot.
 They seem to be fairly straightforward. "To start the pot, say
 ALAKAZAM. To stop the pot, say ALAKAZOO." There's a note at the bottom
 to the effect that the stop spell is extremely tempermental and that
 the pot should under no circumstances be used in confined spaces!

 the porridge begins to run down the sides...

 [My score has just gone up by three points.]

>go up
 I scramble up the rickety steps just in time - a moment later the

 bubbling porridge. I look back to see the cellar completely submerged
 in boiling oatmeal.

 A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.

>lie on small bed
 I only understood you as far as wanting to lie on the fine print.

>lie on tiny bed
 The tiny little bed is so comfortable that I fall into a deep sleep
 the instant my head hits the pillow. Not even the muffled cry as the
 Three Bears fall through the trapdoor into the cellar and drown in a
 mire of their own porridge can rouse me from my sleep.
   At just after noon I have a strange dream. Three ghostly bears, each
 with a pair of wings and holding a golden harp, float up through the
 bedroom floorboards. Papa Bear hovers above me like a translucent
 bear-shaped cloud, glaring at me through baleful yellow eyes.
   'Who's been sleeping in my bed?' he growls, his hot, stinky breath
 on my face.
   'Who's been sleeping in my bed?' snarls Mama Bear nudging her
 husband out of the way.
   'Mater, Pater,' says Baby Bear who has obviously had the benefit of
 a public school education, 'it's patently obvious who has been
 sleeping in our beds, eating our porridge and destroying our
 furniture, since the shameless hussy is still sprawled across my cot.
 But it's all academic now - we're dead! The little monster got the
 better of us this time! Come, parents, I hear that heaven is full of
 succulent young ladies such as this and that the clouds are made of
 porridge!' With that the Three Bears float up through the ceiling and
 on to paradise.

 A few moments later, they're back again, wingless now and dropping
 like stones towards the fires of hell. The last I hear of them is the
 anguished cry

 'No! Please! Not the poker!'

   I awake at around six, having had a full night's, or rather day's
 sleep, fresh as a daisy and ready for another night of partying!

   That's if I can ever find my way out of the enchanted forest...

   ...but that's another story! The important thing is, our plan
 worked! The Three Bears are no more and foxy young chicks are free to
 roam the forest and break into quaint little cottages without fear of
 ending up as a Bondage Barbie for a family of furry freaks! Thanks for
 all your help, I sure as hell couldn't have done it without you!
