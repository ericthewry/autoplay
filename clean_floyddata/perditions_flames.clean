 *** You have died. ***

    All is dark and quiet.  There is no sensation, no time.  Your mind
 floats peacefully in a void.  You perceive nothing, you feel nothing,
 you think nothing.  Sleep without dreams.

    All is hazy and gray.  Sensation is vague and indistinct.  Your mind
 is sluggish, sleepy.  You see gray shapes in a gray fog; you hear
 distant, muffled sounds.  You think, but your thoughts are fleeting,
 disconnected, momentary flashes of light in a dark night.  Time is
 still frames separated by eons of nothing, brief awakenings in a long
 sleep.

    All is clear and sharp.  Sensation crystalizes from a fog.  You see,
 you hear, you feel.  Your mind awakens; you become aware of a place,
 and a time.

    You are on a boat.

            Hell is paved with good intentions.
               -- Fortune cookie




 Boat, on seat J-33
    You're in the main passenger compartment of a large luxury yacht.
 Your seat, J-33, is a large, plush seat next to a window that occupies
 most of the wall.  The boat is about half-filled with people of various
 ages and races, most dressed in casual clothes.  A stairway leads up,
 and another compartment lies to the south.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>look through window
 It's quite dark outside, but a red glow on the horizon provides enough
 light to see that the boat is traveling rapidly down a wide river.  You
 can't make out any detail on the banks.  The waters of the river are
 dark and still below a thin film of mist, which the boat seems barely
 to upset.

>go south
 You're not going anywhere until you get out of seat J-33.

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer on seat J-33.

>examine seat
 It's a large, plush seat, labeled J-33.  It's a window seat.

>look under it
 There's nothing under seat J-33.

>go south
 Bar
    You're in the yacht's wet bar.  The only exit is north, back into
 the main cabin.
    A bartender is here.

>examine bartender
 He's a middle-aged man with slightly graying hair.

>talk to bartender
 I don't know the word "talk".

>ask bartender about boat
 "The captain knows more about it than I do."

>ask bartender about bartender
 "There's not much to tell, really."

>ask bartender about bar
 "The drinks are all free.  Beer, liquor -- we have a wide selection."

>order a drink
 I don't know the word "order".

>bartender, give me a beer
 "Right away!"  He gets out a large mug and fills it with beer from the
 tap.  He hands you the glass.

>inventory
 You have a mug of beer.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>drink beer
 You drink the mug of beer all at once.  It's very good.  You notice a
 slight alcoholic buzz, but it clears fairly quickly.  After you finish,
 the glass vanishes into thin air.

>ask bartender about destination
 I don't know the word "destination".

>ask bartender about hell
 "I kind of like it here."

>ask bartender about heaven
 "You probably know as much as I do."

>ask bartender about captain
 "You can't go ask him yourself.  He's happy to talk to passengers."

>go north
 Boat

>go up
 Deck
    You're on the deck of the yacht.  You have a clearer view of the
 river and the shores from here.  The river is very wide; the shores are
 rocky and desolate, with only a few short, leafless, twisted plants
 growing along the riverbank.  The sky is densely clouded, but not dark;
 the clouds reflect the red glow that seems to come from the horizon in
 all directions.  It strikes you that it is exceedingly quiet; you hear
 no noise from the boat's engines, and even the boat's rapid slicing
 through the still waters seems to make no sound.  It is so quiet that
 you hear only your own breathing -- you realize that it's surprising
 that you're breathing at all, given that you're dead.  A stairway leads
 down, and a doorway leads east.
    You see a printed note here.

>go east
 Control Room
    You're in the boat's control room.  A large window looks out onto
 the river. A doorway leads west, back out onto the deck.
    The boat's pilot is here, operating the controls.

>examine pilot
 The boat's pilot is here, operating the controls.

>ask pilot about boat
 "This is a very nice boat, don't you think?  We used to use a small
 rowboat, but lots of people complained that the passage to the
 afterlife should be a little nicer.  Besides, with more people dying
 these days, it was getting crowded."

>ask pilot about captain
 "I was a programmer before I got here.  But there's not much need for
 programming skills here, so I do this instead."

>examine captain
 The boat's pilot is here, operating the controls.

    The captain starts fiddling with the controls.  "We're there," he
 says.  Outside, you can see a pier come into view on the western bank;
 the captain guides the boat silently alongside the pier and brings it
 to a halt.  As the boat comes to rest against the pier, a gangway
 extends toward the boat, and settles on the deck.
    "Attention, passengers," the captain says into a microphone.  "We
 have arrived.  You may disembark at your leisure."  You see a few
 passengers start to disembark.

>ask pilot about me
 "There's not much to tell about it."

>ask pilot about bartender
 "The drinks at the bar are free.  Help yourself!  Just ask the
 bartender for a beer, liquor, what have you.  But let me know if you
 see any of those Infernolab guys down there -- they always come running
 when they hear there's an open bar somewhere."

>ask captain about infernolab
 "They're just a bunch of drunkards, if you ask me."

>ask pilot about infernolab
 "They're just a bunch of drunkards, if you ask me."

>ask captain about hell
 "It's a little strange at first, but you'll get used to it."

>ask captain about river
 "There's not much to tell about it."

>ask captain about name
 I don't know the word "name".

>ask pilot about death
 "It's a little strange at first, but you'll get used to it."

>examine charon
 I don't know the word "charon".

>go west
 Deck
    You see a printed note here.

>take note
 Taken.

>go west
 Pier
    You're on a large, brightly-lit pier.  The pier is obviously quite
 new; it's constructed from steel, and the walkway has a rubbery surface
 and attractive wooden handrails to make it safer.  The large white
 yacht which brought you here is docked alongside; a gangway leads east
 onto the boat's deck.  To the north lies the entrance to a large
 one-story brick building.  The building has the look of a high school
 or a post office -- that sort of simple, utilitarian style of a
 government building.
    You see a rope here.

 [Your score just went up.  If you don't want to be notified of score
 changes like this in the future, just type NOTIFY.]

>notify on
 I don't understand that sentence.

>notify
 You will no longer be notified of score changes.  If you change your
 mind and want to be notified again, just type NOTIFY again.

>notify
 You will now be notified of score changes.

>examine rope
 It's a thick rope, about ten feet long, for securing boats at the pier.
 One end of the rope is tied into a loop, so it can be slipped over
 posts on the pier.

>slip rope onto post
 I don't know the word "slip".

>put rope on post
 I don't know the word "post".

>take rope
 Taken.

>climb rope
 I don't know how to climb the rope.

>inventory
 You have a printed note and a rope.

>examine building
 The building has the look of a high school or a post office -- that
 sort of simple, utilitarian style of a government building.

>go north
 Briefing Room
    This is a large room with a high ceiling, brightly illuminated with
 fluorescent lights.  Most of your fellow passengers are here, sitting
 in folding chairs facing a podium; many empty chairs are available.  An
 exit leads to the south, and another passage leads north.

>sit
 (the folding chair)
 As you sit down, a middle-aged woman enters the room and walks to the
 podium.  "Good afternoon, everyone," she says, addressing the assembled
 group of passengers.  "Welcome to the afterlife.  I'm here to help you
 get started, give you basic information about the underworld, and
 answer any questions you have.
    "Let me start by saying that we're very glad to have you here.  Just
 take your time getting acquainted with your surroundings.  There's no
 hurry -- you're going to be here for a long time!"  She chuckles and
 smiles.  "Seriously, though, I think you'll find that being dead isn't
 very hard once you find your way around.
    "Now, once you've had a chance to explore for a while, you'll
 probably want to find a job.  There are many very interesting positions
 available, and we'll be happy to help you find something that's right
 for you.
    "I'm sure you all have many questions, so don't be shy.  Who's
 first?"

    Someone at the front of the room raises her hand.  "Yes, you at the
 front," the woman says, pointing to her.
    "Is this heaven or hell?"  she asks.
    The woman responds, "You know what they say -- if you have to ask
 --" she chuckles.  "It is technically hell, although that's such a
 loaded word that we don't like to use it.  Most ideas people have about
 hell are very outdated.  Ever since the deregulation of the afterlife
 industry, we've had to compete with Heaven for eternal souls -- because
 you're free to switch to Heaven at any time.  So, we've been
 modernizing!  There really isn't much eternal torment these days, for
 example.  And, thanks to the Environmental Clean-up Superfund, we have
 the brimstone problem mostly under control at this point."

>ask woman about job
 I don't know the word "job".

>ask woman about woman
 Try as you might, you can't seem to attract her attention -- someone
 always gets in with a question first.

    Someone in the middle of the room raises her hand.  "Yes, you in the
 middle," the woman says, pointing to her.
    "Can I go back to earth as a ghost and haunt people?"  she asks.
    The woman responds, "No, unfortunately not.  However, our top
 scientists are working on this problem, and the latest reports indicate
 that it may be possible in the near future.  Those of you with
 scientific backgrounds, in particular those of you who went to Caltech
 and really understand what makes a good prank, may want to look into
 joining the project."

>wait
 Time passes...

    Someone at the right of the room raises her hand.  "Yes, you at the
 right," the woman says, pointing to her.
    "I was wondering, where is the famous 'All hope abandon, ye who
 enter here' sign?  I want to get some pictures with it."  she asks.
    The woman responds, "Actually, the sign said 'Lasciate ogni
 speranza, voi ch'entrate,' and I'm afraid it's been taken down.  People
 found it too depressing.  But there are several very nice vista points
 that you can find in the tour book."

>wait
 Time passes...

    Someone at the left of the room raises his hand.  "Yes, you at the
 left," the woman says, pointing to him.
    "Which circle of hell are we doomed to?"  he asks.
    The woman responds, "We abolished the circle system shortly after
 the middle ages after the 'separate and unequal' principle was ruled
 illegal.  You're free to go wherever you'd like -- even up to Heaven."

>wait
 Time passes...

    Someone at the rear of the room raises her hand.  "Yes, you at the
 rear," the woman says, pointing to her.
    "Why did I end up here?  What did I do wrong?"  she asks.
    The woman responds, "Really, you must shed your outdated notions of
 hell.  You don't have to do anything wrong to end up here.  New souls
 are randomly assigned to Heaven or Hell based on the last four digits
 of your Celestial Security Number.  The Heaven-Hell border was opened a
 long time ago, though, so your initial assignment is not permanent."

>wait
 Time passes...

    Someone at the right of the room raises his hand.  "Yes, you at the
 right," the woman says, pointing to him.
    "You said we can go to Heaven.  How do we get there?"  he asks.
    The woman responds, "The easiest way is to use the HadesCorp Space
 Needle.  It's impossible to miss -- it's the tallest free-standing
 structure in hell.  The view from the elevator is fantastic."

 Time passes...

    Someone at the left of the room raises her hand.  "Yes, you at the
 left," the woman says, pointing to her.
    "You mentioned jobs.  What if I don't want to work?"  she asks.
    The woman responds, "That's up to you.  Dead people have no material
 needs.  And, unlike in real life, you'll find that you won't need to
 eat or sleep every forty or fifty turns, which is a real convenience.
 However, most people like to feel useful, and derive a sense of purpose
 from their employment here."

>wait
 Time passes...

    Someone in the middle of the room raises his hand.  "Yes, you in the
 middle," the woman says, pointing to him.
    "I used to work as a lobbyist.  Are similar positions available
 here?"  he asks.
    The woman responds, "Absolutely!  However, you may find that there
 are quite a few lobbyists in Hell, which will probably not surprise
 anyone.  Incidentally, anyone interested in public affairs should tune
 in to H-SPAN, which broadcasts programs that cover a wide array of
 current events.  I believe the station number is 319."

>wait
 Time passes...

    Someone at the rear of the room raises his hand.  "Yes, you at the
 rear," the woman says, pointing to him.
    "I'm a very rich individual and I refuse to be treated in this
 manner.  I've made charitable contributions all my life, and we've
 never beaten the help -- not when they didn't deserve it, anyway, the
 lazy bastards.  This is an outrage!  You can be sure you will be
 hearing from my lawyer!  What do you have to say for yourself?"  he
 asks.
    The woman responds, "I'm sure you have a very good case.  However,
 I'm afraid that the legal system in Hell is based on the United States
 judicial system.  So, as you must know, the courts are so overloaded
 with frivolous lawsuits that legitimate claims, such as yours
 undoubtedly is, cannot be accepted.  Any lawsuit found to have merit is
 immediately and summarily dismissed.  There are some very good personal
 injury lawyers that you might wish to contact, though."

>wait
 Time passes...

    Someone at the front of the room raises his hand.  "Yes, you at the
 front," the woman says, pointing to him.
    "I used to drive nitro-burning ground-pounding six-second funny
 cars.  Is there any chance that I'll be able to shake hands with the
 devil while I scream through the gates of Hell?"  he asks.
    The woman responds, "I'm afraid that, due to the volume of new
 immigrants, the devil is unable to personally greet each new arrival."

>go north
 Courtyard
    You're in a large courtyard surrounded by buildings.  To the south
 is the Immigration Building, to the east is the Department of Motor
 Vehicles, and to the west is a Celestial Security office.  An archway
 leads out of the courtyard to the north.  In the center of the
 courtyard is a vending machine.

>examine machine
 It looks similar to a soft-drink vending machine, but it's labeled
 "Space Needle Tickets".  It has a slot labeled "20 Hellmids", and a
 small receptacle.

>go east
 Department of Motor Vehicles
    You're in a very large, very drab room.  In the center of the room
 is a long counter that runs the length of the room.  As is typical of
 such facilities, there is a customer at almost every window, and
 practically no employees to be seen behind the counter.  In fact, the
 only employee in sight is standing at a window with no customers,
 looking bored.  The exit is to the west.
    A DMV official is here.

 You walk over to the window where the employee is standing.

 The DMV employee says, "Let's see your appointment card.  Service is by
 appointment only."

>examine official
 She's a middle-aged woman.  She looks profoundly disinterested in being
 here.

 Celestial Security Office
    You're in the Celestial Security Office.  At one end of the room is
 a counter, and next to the counter is a wastebasket that's full of
 crumpled up paper.  The exit is to the east, and a door behind the
 counter leads west.
    Behind the counter is a middle-aged man dressed in a light blue
 Celestial Security Administration uniform.  You're relieved to see that
 there's only one person in line.  You were afraid that the line would
 be longer, with so many new people arriving at the same time you did,
 but this will obviously take no time.
    The Celestial Security officer notices you enter, and looks up at
 you.  "I'll be right with you, after I finish with this applicant," he
 says.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "What is your
 middle initial?"  The woman replies, "G."  The officer slowly and
 carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

>examine wastebasket
 In the waste basket you see some waste paper.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "What was your
 date of birth?"  The woman replies, "Um, November 12, 1959."  The
 officer slowly and carefully transcribes the information onto the
 application form.

>search wastebasket
 In the waste basket you see some waste paper.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "And your date of
 death?"  The woman replies, "June 23, 2013."  The officer slowly and
 carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

>take paper
 The Celestial Security officer doesn't let you.  "Those contain private
 information," he scolds you.  "Besides, we recycle all of our paper.
 We're trying to be environmentally conscious."

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Do you have any
 deceased dependents?"  The woman replies, "No."  The officer slowly and
 carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

>take waste

>search waste paper
 You find nothing of interest.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "What is your IQ?"
 The woman replies, "I'm not sure."  The officer slowly and carefully
 transcribes the information onto the application form.

>read waste paper
 The waste basket is full of crumpled-up application forms, evidently
 discarded due to errors made in preparation.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "How many fingers
 am I holding up?"  The woman replies, "Three."  The officer slowly and
 carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

>examine woman
 She looks to be in her mid-thirties.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Do you know your

>go north
 Downtown
    You're in the center of Hell's business district.  To the north is
 an extremely tall tower, which reaches up into the sky; the top is lost
 in mist high above.  An archway leads south.  You can go down the
 street to the east and west.

>examine tower
 The tower is extremely tall.  You can see its lighted windows high
 above, disappearing into the dark mist of the sky above.  The words
 "HadesCorp Space Needle" are engraved in large letters above the
 entrance.

>examine sky
 I don't know the word "sky".

>go north
 Base of Tower
    You're in a gigantic, imposing lobby.  The ceiling is at least five
 stories above; the dark granite walls are adorned with strange
 gargoyles looking down on you from high overhead.  The exit out to the
 street is to the south.
    An elevator is to the north.  The elevator doors are open.

>examine gargoyles
 They look like unusual gargoyles to me.

>go north
 Elevator
    You're in a large, ornate elevator.  The walls are tiled with gold
 panels decorated with an intricate pattern of interweaved lines,
 resembling vines; the floor is covered with deep, plush carpeting; and
 hanging from the ceiling is a chandelier with thousands of tiny lights.
 The open door leads south, back out into the lobby.
    An old, white-bearded man wearing a white robe is standing in the
 corner of the elevator near the controls.  He is evidently the elevator
 operator.

>ask man about elevator
 He points to a small sign:  "For safety reasons, please do not talk to
 operator unnecessarily."

 That isn't important.

 It looks like an ordinary chandelier to me.

 Downtown
    You're on a street in downtown Hell.  To the south is the entrance
 to a large low-rise building labeled "Infernolab," and to the north is
 the fortress-like Bank of Hell.  The street continues east and west.  A
 narrow alley leads alongside the Infernolab building to the southwest.

>examine infernolab
 I don't see any infernolab here.

>examine bank
 I don't see any bank here.

>go south
 Lobby
    You're in a lobby, decorated with a very high-tech look:  the walls
 are brushed stainless steel; the illumination is provided by black
 track lighting suspended from an intricate network of black metal
 railing; the furniture is black and angular.  Along the far wall,
 spelled out in four-foot-high Helvetica Medium Extended letters carved
 from granite, is the word:

            I N F E R N O L A B

    In the center of the lobby is a huge black leather couch, and a low
 black marble coffee table.  A hallway leads east, and an exit leads
 north, back out to the street.
    A pair of maintenance workers in white overalls walks in from the
 east.  One is carrying a toolbox, and the other is carrying a light
 bulb and a sheet of paper.
    "Let's see," says the one carrying the sheet of paper, carefully
 reading it. "The trouble ticket says that bulb number 47 has blown
 again."  He looks up at the track lighting.  "Damn!  We forgot the
 ladder!"
    "No need," says the other.  He sets his toolbox on the coffee table,
 then climbs up onto the table.  "I can reach number 47 from here," he
 says.  He reaches up and unscrews one of the bulbs, then lays it on top
 of the railing.  "Hand me that new bulb," he says.  The other worker
 hands him the bulb, and he screws it into the socket.  As he's screwing
 it in, a huge flash of light suddenly erupts from the socket, followed
 by a shower of glass.  The flash of light is quickly replaced by a
 cloud of smoke, and flames engulf the worker.  He jumps off of the
 table, his clothes in flames, screaming and flailing his arms, and runs
 out into the street.  The other worker shrugs and disappears down the
 hall.
    Sitting on the marble coffee table is a toolbox.  Sitting on the
 black metal railing is a dead light bulb.

>get all
 toolbox:  Taken.
 dead light bulb:  You can't reach it from here; it's up in the railing.

>examine toolbox
 It's a gray metal toolbox.  The toolbox is closed.

>open toolbox
 It's locked.

>stand on table
 You climb up onto the coffee table.  It makes a pretty good platform --
 you can reach the railing from here.

>take bulb
 Taken.

>examine bulb
 It's a dead light bulb.  It seems slightly charred inside.

>examine toolbox
 It's a gray metal toolbox.  The toolbox is closed.

>stand on railing
 I don't know how to stand on the black metal railing.

>climb railing
 With a little effort, you manage to climb up into the rails.

 Up a Rail
    You're crouching in the intricate network of rails above the lobby
 floor.  You can't stand up, because the ceiling is only a few feet
 above the top of the rails, but there's plenty of room to move around.
 You can go down, back to the lobby floor.
    In the ceiling, you notice an access panel.  The panel is currently
 closed.

 [Your score just went up.]

>open panel
 Opened.

>examine panel
 It's open.

 Crawlway
    You're in a maintenance crawlway.  It's cramped, but you can easily
 move around on your hands and knees.  The crawlway continues to the
 north and south; you can also climb down through a hole in the floor.

>go south
 Crawlway, at T
    You're at a "T" intersection between a crawlway that continues off
 to the north, and an east-west crawlway.

>go east
 Crawlway
    You're at the east end of a crawlway.  There's a small access panel
 in the floor (which is currently closed), although it's too small for
 you to go through.

>open panel
 Opened.

>look through it
 Through the hole, you can see a room below.  The room seems to consist
 of a series of small cubicles, each separated by a six-foot-high
 partition.  Each cubicle contains a chair and a desk.  In most of the
 cubicles, a person is occupying the chair.
    South of the cubicles is a large, white room, in which a number of
 people in white labcoats are moving about, consulting with one another
 and writing notes on the clipboards they're carrying.

>examine notes
 I don't see any notes here.

>go west
 Crawlway, at T

>go west
 Crawlway
    You're at the west end of a crawlway.  Large metal pipes run along
 the walls.  The crawlway continues to the east.
    One of the pipes ends here.  The end of the pipe is not connected to
 anything at all; you assume it's being left for future expansion.  Just
 before the end of the pipe is a valve, evidently to cut off the flow of
 whatever the pipe carries until something is attached here.  The valve
 is currently closed.

>open pipe
 I don't know how to open the pipe.

>touch pipe
 Touching the pipe doesn't seem to have any effect.

>open valve
 You turn the wheel, opening the valve.  As you do, the pipe starts
 hissing, and you smell natural gas pouring out of the pipe.

 You hear gas continuing to pour out of the pipe.  The odor of gas is
 growing stronger.

>close pipe
 I don't know how to close the pipe.

 You hear gas continuing to pour out of the pipe.  The odor of gas is

 Lobby

>look
 Lobby
    You're in a lobby, decorated with a very high-tech look:  the walls
 are brushed stainless steel; the illumination is provided by black
 track lighting suspended from an intricate network of black metal
 railing; the furniture is black and angular.  Along the far wall,
 spelled out in four-foot-high Helvetica Medium Extended letters carved
 from granite, is the word:

            I N F E R N O L A B

    In the center of the lobby is a huge black leather couch, and a low
 black marble coffee table.  A hallway leads east, and an exit leads
 north, back out to the street.

>search couch
 There's nothing on the couch.

>examine couch
 The couch is very large.  It's upholstered in black leather, and has a
 shiny chrome frame.  There's nothing on the couch.

>look under couch
 There's nothing under the couch.

>go east
 Hallway
    You're in a hallway that leads east and west.  All along the south
 wall are closely-spaced doors; all of the doors are closed, except for
 one.  The hall continues to the east.

>go south
 Cubicle
    You're in a small cubicle, bordered on the east and west by
 six-foot-high partitions, and on the south by a desk.  There's a chair
 that occupies most of the rest of the space.  A door is to the north;
 the door is open.
    On the other side of the desk is a very large, bright white room.
 Several men and women are walking about the room, consulting with each
 other; each is wearing a long white lab coat, and carrying a black
 metal clipboard stuffed with papers.  Overhead, you notice a small
 opening in the ceiling.
    As you enter, one of the women in labcoats walks over to you.  "Ah,
 you must be subject 32," she says with a bit of impatience in her
 voice.  "Everyone else is ready to begin.  Now, if you'd take your
 seat, we could proceed with the experiment."  She walks back toward the
 center of the room and confers with another of the scientists.

>push save
 I don't understand that sentence.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Saved.

>sit
 (the chair)
 Okay, you're now sitting on the chair.
    As you sit down, the door behind you slides closed.  One of the
 scientists walks over to one of the others, and asks him, "Are you
 ready to begin, Doctor Merkwurtigblatt?"
    Merkwurtigblatt turns to face her.  "A moment please!"  He stands
 facing away from the cubicles, and runs his hands through his hair,
 inhaling deeply.  He then abruptly turns on his heel to face the
 cubicles.  He has short, curly black hair, and is wearing very thick,
 dark glasses, a white lab coat, and black leather gloves.
    "Thank you all for coming.  I'm Doctor Merkwurtigblatt, and I'll be
 your scientist today.  The experiment we're performing is in a field
 called Micro-Economics, which means that we're going to attempt to
 model a particular set of market forces under controlled conditions.
 As a result, you may find the experiment to be quite abstract, but
 don't worry; we don't actually want you to understand the point of this
 experiment, for two reasons.  First, if you knew what we were
 attempting to prove, it would bias the results.  And second, our
 theories might seem strange, or even laughable, to the layman, and you
 might be left with the impression that Economics is something less --
 much less -- than the precise and exacting science that we Economists
 know it to be. But you will be able to rest assured in your confusion
 that the economic future of Hell is in capable hands.  You can tell by
 our white labcoats, clipboards, and seemingly effortless use of large
 words that we are authority figures to be respected -- yes -- and
 feared!
    "Now, the rules of the experiment are quite simple.  Each of you is
 a trader in goods we will call 'widgets.'  The experiment will consist
 of a series of trading rounds.  In each trading round, you will conduct
 a transaction with the subject to your left and the one to your right.
    "We will be using what we Economists refer to as the Extended RSP
 Trading Model, which stands for Rock, Scissors, Paper.  We call it
 'extended' because we have added a new element that radically changes
 the equation:  dynamite.  In this model, dynamite pulverizes rock, rock
 crushes scissors, scissors cut paper -- yes, to shreds!  -- but paper
 covers dynamite.
    "You start with 5 widgets.  In each trading round, you will choose
 dynamite, rock, scissors, or paper, and your trading choice will be
 compared with the choices of those to your left and right.  The subject
 who prevails out of each group of three will acquire one widget each
 from the subjects on the left and right.  The experiment will proceed
 for five trading rounds.
    "As an incentive to do your best, if you manage to win every round,
 you will be awarded Twenty Hellmids at the end of the experiment.
 Choose carefully."
    You notice a control panel on the desk that you hadn't seen before.
 The control panel has a numeric display, which is currently displaying
 "5", and four buttons, labeled Dynamite, Rock, Scissors, and Paper.

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 1," he
 announces.  "Please make your selections."

>examine opponents
 I don't know the word "opponents".

>push scissors
 You push the button, making your choice.  One of the scientists walks
 over and looks at your choice and the choices of the people on your
 left and right.  "Let's see, you chose scissors," she says, looking at
 your button.  "The subject on your left chose paper, and the subject on
 the right chose rock.  I'm afraid that rock crushes scissors, so you've
 lost this round.  You lose one widget."
    Your display now reads "4".

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 2," he
 announces.  "Please make your selections."

>push dynamite
 You push the button, making your choice.  One of the scientists walks
 over and looks at your choice and the choices of the people on your
 left and right.  "Let's see, you chose dynamite," she says, looking at
 your button.  "The subject on your left chose paper, and the subject on
 the right chose rock.  I'm afraid that paper wraps dynamite, so you've
 lost this round.  You lose one widget."
    Your display now reads "3".

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 3," he
 announces.  "Please make your selections."

>examine left
 They're just tall enough that you can't see over them.

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 3," he
 announces.  "Please make your selections."

>push rock
 You push the button, making your choice.  One of the scientists walks
 over and looks at your choice and the choices of the people on your
 left and right.  "Let's see, you chose rock," she says, looking at your
 button.  "The subject on your left chose scissors, and the subject on
 the right chose dynamite.  I'm afraid that dynamite blows up rock, so
 you've lost this round.  You lose one widget."
    Your display now reads "2".

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 4," he
 announces.  "Please make your selections."

>push rock
 You push the button, making your choice.  One of the scientists walks
 over and looks at your choice and the choices of the people on your
 left and right.  "Let's see, you chose rock," she says, looking at your
 button.  "The subject on your left chose dynamite, and the subject on
 the right chose scissors.  I'm afraid that dynamite blows up rock, so
 you've lost this round.  You lose one widget."
    Your display now reads "1".

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 5," he
 announces.  "Please make your selections."

>push paper
 Pushing the scientist's possession doesn't do anything.

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 5," he

>push paper button
 You push the button, making your choice.  One of the scientists walks

 left and right.  "Let's see, you chose paper," she says, looking at
 your button.  "The subject on your left chose scissors, and the subject
 on the right chose dynamite.  I'm afraid that scissors cuts paper, so
 you've lost this round.  You lose one widget."
    Your display now reads "0".

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt announces loudly, "That concludes the experiment.
 Thank you all for participating.  You've provided a great deal of
 valuable data that will significantly advance this important field of
 science.  Those of you with with fifteen widgets will be given your
 checks now."
    The cubicle's door slides open.
    One of the men in labcoats walks up to your desk and looks at your
 console's display.  He bursts into laughter.  "Zero!  What a loser!
 Don't you realize that you'd do a lot better than this by PURE RANDOM
 CHANCE?"  He calls to a couple of the other scientists.  "Hey, have a
 look at this!  He got zero!  I've never seen one of these before!"
 Several scientists come over and gawk at your display, and walk off
 laughing.

 Bank of Hell
    You're in the cavernous interior of the main office of the Bank of
 Hell.  The style is very 19th Century:  the building itself is made of
 granite blocks; huge oak desks with dark green and burgundy leather
 armchairs are arranged in neat rows behind the counter that runs the
 width of the room; and dozens of tellers dressed in dark pinstripe
 vests and bow ties stand behind the counter, each at a window with a
 stack of papers and a green banker's light, waiting on a customer.
    The exit is to the south.

 One of the tellers waves you over to his window.  "Can I help you?"  he
 asks.

 The teller looks at you expectantly.

>examine teller
 He looks to be in his early thirties.  Like all the other tellers, he's

 Alley
    You're in an alley between two large low-rise buildings, one to the
 east and one to the west.  The alley dead-ends to the south; you can go
 out to the north.
    At the south end of the alley is a large dumpster.

>examine dumpster
 It's a really large, very smelly dumpster.  Over the edge of the
 dumpster, you can see a pair of flippers sticking up.  Unfortunately,
 you can't quite reach them from here.

 A man whose clothes are on fire is running around in circles, flailing
 his arms and screaming.  He runs off to the west.

>go east
 Outskirts
    You're in a sparsely-populated rural area east of town.  The road
 leads west into the city, but ends here; to the east is an open field;
 you can also go south, where the terrain becomes rocky and hilly.  A
 small farmhouse lies to the north.

>go north
 Farmhouse
    You're in a small, deserted, one-room farmhouse.  The building is
 very old and rickety, and all the paint has long since peeled off the
 walls.  You can go through doors to the south and east.
    You see a portable radio here.

>unlock toolbox
 What do you want to unlock it with?

>force of will
 I don't know the word "force".

>take radio

>turn on radio
 The radio is now turned on.

 The radio plays annoying heavy metal music.

>examine radio
 It's a HadesCorp WaveMaster 2000 portable transistor radio.  It has a
 dial that lets you set the frequency, and a switch for turning the
 radio on and off (the switch is currently in the on position).  On the
 back is a small compartment.

 On the radio, an annoying heavy metal deejay talks about a radio
 contest.

>turn radio dial
 What do you want to turn it to?

>319
 Okay, it's now turned to 319.

 A man on the radio says, "Many drivers find it very confusing that
 every type of zone has its own speed limit.  No two zones have the same
 speed limit.  In addition, there are too many types of zones -- we have
 School Zones, Hospital Zones, Library Zones, Residential Zones, and
 Freeway Zones.  This is more than we need."

>go east
 Barnyard
    You're in a large yard outside an old, abandoned barn.  The area is
 overgrown with weeds; it obviously hasn't been used in many years.  A
 rusty old wellhead sticks out of the weeds; a large metal bucket is
 hanging from the well.  The farmhouse is to the west, and the entrance
 to the barn is to the north.

 A woman on the radio says, "I believe that both Hospital Zones and 43
 mile-per-hour zones need to be reconsidered."

>take all
 bucket:  Taken.

 A man on the radio says, "Possibly, but I think it's a much more
 pressing problem that the color of speed limit signs in School Zones is
 blue."

>take bucket
 You already have the bucket!

 The woman on the radio responds, "What color would you suggest?  Green
 is already taken by 59 mile-per-hour zones."

>wait
 Time passes...

 On the radio, a second woman enters the conversation.  "Yes, but both
 School Zones and 27 mile-per-hour zones have large signs, while Library
 Zones -- not to mention 43 mile-per-hour zones -- have only
 medium-sized signs.  It doesn't seem appropriate somehow."

>examine bucket
 It's an old rusty metal bucket.  It's empty.

 The man on the radio says, "Now I've forgotten -- is the speed limit in
 a residental zone 17 or 23 miles per hour?"

>examine well
 It's a hand-pumped well.  It has a long lever, and a spout.  The pump
 looks very old and corroded.

 The first woman on the radio says, "I can't remember, but I know that
 either School Zones or Hospital Zones are 23 miles per hour."

>pull lever
 You work the lever, to no avail; the well is long since dry.

 The announcer comes back on the radio.  "That's all the time we have
 for today's edition of Vehicle Code Forum.  Next on, live coverage of
 the swearing-in ceremony for new civil servants in the Ministry of
 Information."

>search weeds
 You find nothing of interest.

 A man on the radio says, "Do you swear to uphold the procedures and
 policies of the Ministry of Information, to use appropriate rubber
 stamps on all forms, and to completely and accurately fill in all parts
 of forms marked Office Use Only and/or Do Not Write Above and/or Below
 Line?"

>go north
 Barn
    You're in an old, rickety barn.  The area smells of rotting wood and
 damp decay.  The usual farm implements are scattered around the barn:
 a pitchfork stuck into a bale of hay, several stalls for horses.
    In the center of the barn is a small single-engine airplane.  It's
 an open-cockpit, high-wing tail-dragger.  It's painted a faded yellow.
    The exit is to the south.

 Someone on the radio says, "I do."

>examine airplane
 It's a tail-dragger with an open cockpit.  Unfortunately, it doesn't
 look like there's any hope that it can be made to work; the engine
 looks dismantled and corroded.  It looks like you could get in the
 plane if you wanted, though.

 Someone on the radio says, "I do."

>enter it
 cockpit
    You're in the cockpit of a very old airplane.  From here, you can
 see just how hopeless it would be to try to get it flying:  the control
 stick has been removed, leaving a gaping hole in the floor, and the
 airframe is quite rotted.
    Even the seat has been removed.  At the rear of the cockpit area is
 a large compartment, which is closed.

 Someone on the radio says, "I do."

>open compartment
 Which compartment do you mean, the radio compartment, or the storage
 compartment?

>storage
 It's jammed shut; you'll need to get something to pry it open with.

 Someone on the radio says, "I do."

 this place!

 Someone on the radio says, "I do."

>search hay
 You find nothing of interest.

 The radio announces, "This is H-SPAN, the Hades Public Affairs Network.
 Next on:  a discussion of the Motor Vehicle Code."

>examine stalls
 There's nothing interesting about them.

 An announcer on the radio says, "Welcome to Vehicle Code Forum.
 Today's topic is speed limits."

>enter stall
 Why?  Hoping to return as a horse in your next life?

 A man on the radio says, "Many drivers find it very confusing that
 every type of zone has its own speed limit.  No two zones have the same

    You're in a large, open field.  The ground is peppered with clumps
 of scrubby grass.  A road lies to the west.  You can see a tall
 mountain range in the distance to the southeast.
    There's a large jackrabbit hopping around, foraging for food.

 The first woman on the radio says, "I can't remember, but I know that
 either School Zones or Hospital Zones are 23 miles per hour."

 The rabbit hops around the field.

 Rocky Hillside
    You're on a gently sloping, rocky hillside at the base of a tall
 mountain.  The granite surface of the hillside hosts no vegetation.
 Looming high above to the east is the steep cone of a volcano; clouds
 of dark smoke rise steadily above the cone.  You can climb into the
 mountains to the east, and you can also go north, back to the road.

 Someone on the radio says, "I do."

>go east
 Mountainside
    You're fairly high up on the side of the mountain -- you'd guess
 that you're around two thousand feet up.  (Have you noticed that they
 use the English system of measurements in Hell?  What else would you
 expect?)  You can go down the mountain to the west, and the volcano's
 cone looms above to the east.  A small opening appears to lead into a
 cave to the south.  You can also travel along a path to the north, and
 a narrow passage to the southeast.
    You have an excellent view of Hell from here.  The tall buildings
 downtown all seem tiny from this distance and altitude, except for the
 Tower -- even from here, you can't see the top.  The Tower looks like a
 thin, gleaming string stretching from the ground up into the dark sky.
 As your eyes follow the Tower up into the sky, you realize that you're
 high enough above the surface now that you can see stars above -- so
 many stars, all so bright, that it's quite well lit here.

 The radio announces, "This is H-SPAN, the Hades Public Affairs Network.
 Next on:  a discussion of the Motor Vehicle Code."

>examine stars
 I don't know the word "stars".

>go east
 Top of Volcano
    You're standing at the rim of the volcano.  Below, tons of glowing
 red-hot molten rock churn and bubble.  You can climb down the mountain
 to the west.

 An announcer on the radio says, "Welcome to Vehicle Code Forum.
 Today's topic is speed limits."

>examine lava
 I don't see any lava here.

>examine volcano
 It's hard to see much, thanks to all of the steam and dust rising out
 of the cauldron, but you can see quite a lot of red-hot, glowing,
 molten rock.

 A man on the radio says, "Many drivers find it very confusing that
 every type of zone has its own speed limit.  No two zones have the same
 speed limit.  In addition, there are too many types of zones -- we have
 School Zones, Hospital Zones, Library Zones, Residential Zones, and
 Freeway Zones.  This is more than we need."

>examine molten rock
 I don't know the word "molten".

>go west
 Mountainside

 A woman on the radio says, "I believe that both Hospital Zones and 43
 mile-per-hour zones need to be reconsidered."

>go south
 Lava Cave
    You're in a large, cylindrical cave with smooth, black walls.
 Running through the south end of the cave is a wide, swiftly-flowing
 river of lava, which flows downhill to the east.  The lava pours in
 through an orifice in the western wall.  An exit leads back outside to
 the north.

 A man on the radio says, "Possibly, but I think it's a much more
 pressing problem that the color of speed limit signs in School Zones is
 blue."

>go south
 The searing heat of the lava shoots through your body, making you try
 desperately to escape the river.  As you flail around, though, you
 start to realize that the lava isn't harming you, despite the intense
 pain.  As you start to get used to the blistering heat, you notice that
 you're being swept rapidly downstream...

 River of Lava
    The river of lava is flowing swiftly downhill to the east.

 The lava flow starts to carry you downstream.

 The woman on the radio responds, "What color would you suggest?  Green
 is already taken by 59 mile-per-hour zones."

>look
 River of Lava
    The river of lava is flowing swiftly downhill to the east.

 The swift river of lava sweeps you downstream to the east.

 Bend in River
    The river of lava turns from east to south here.

 On the radio, a second woman enters the conversation.  "Yes, but both
 School Zones and 27 mile-per-hour zones have large signs, while Library
 Zones -- not to mention 43 mile-per-hour zones -- have only
 medium-sized signs.  It doesn't seem appropriate somehow."

>wait
 Time passes...

 You're carried rapidly to the south by the flowing lava.

 River of Lava
    The river of lava is flowing through the cave swiftly to the south.
 To the west is a shore that appears to open into a cave.  The cave has
 many stalagmites sticking up from its floor; one particularly large
 stalagmite right on the shore -- only about ten feet away from you --
 is at least three feet tall.
    There's a faint light downstream, and you hear a loud rushing noise
 from the south.

 The man on the radio says, "Now I've forgotten -- is the speed limit in
 a residental zone 17 or 23 miles per hour?"

>throw rope at stalagmite
 You're up to your ears in lava.  You can't manage to throw the rope
 while submerged like this.

 The lava sweeps you along to the south.

 Top of Lavafall
    The cave abruptly opens into the night sky, and you realize that
 you're at the top of a cliff.  The lava is pouring over the edge of the
 cliff and falling hundreds of feet down the side of the mountain below.

 The first woman on the radio says, "I can't remember, but I know that
 either School Zones or Hospital Zones are 23 miles per hour."

>turn off radio
 The radio is now turned off.

 Before you can do anything, the river carries you over the edge of the
 lavafall.  You fall and fall, tumbling and flailing your arms and legs,
 catching a glimpse of the bottom of the lavafall lost in the rocks far
 below.  Suddenly, you hit something, and your fall stops abruptly.

 Ledge near Lavafall
    You're on a ledge just west of, and halfway up, a huge lavafall.
 The lava pours down with a deafening rumbling sound.  The narrow ledge
 seems to continue to the northwest.

>go northwest
 Ledge
    You're on a narrow ledge high up on the mountainside.  The ledge
 continues to the southeast and northwest.

>go northwest
 You walk carefully along the ledge, but you suddenly hit a loose spot.
 You try to maintain your footing, but the rock crumbles under you, and
 you go sliding down the mountainside.  You finally stop falling, and
 you find yourself on a rocky hillside you've seen before.

 Rocky Hillside

 Mountainside
    You're fairly high up on the side of the mountain -- you'd guess
 that you're around two thousand feet up.  (Have you noticed that they
 use the English system of measurements in Hell?  What else would you
 expect?)  You can go down the mountain to the west, and the volcano's
 cone looms above to the east.  A small opening appears to lead into a
 cave to the south.  You can also travel along a path to the north, and
 a narrow passage to the southeast.
    You have an excellent view of Hell from here.  The tall buildings
 downtown all seem tiny from this distance and altitude, except for the

 high enough above the surface now that you can see stars above -- so
 many stars, all so bright, that it's quite well lit here.

>go north
 Lake Shore
    You're on the shore of a beautiful clear blue mountain lake.  The
 lake is huge -- it looks like it's almost a mile across.  The water is
 very still and clear.  The lake is circled by high cliffs, except here,
 where you could easily wade into the water.  A path leads south.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>in
 You can't go that way.

>swim
 (the lake water)
 Swimming on the lake
    You're swimming on the lake.  The shore is to the west.  A rocky
 ledge to the north prevents travel in that direction, but you can go
 east or south.
    You didn't notice from the shore, but there seems to be a very
 strong undertow pulling you underwater.

 You try to fight the undertow, but it's just too strong.  It drags you
 underwater.

 Underwater
    You're underwater in the lake.  To the north is a rocky wall, but
 there's an opening that could be the mouth of a cave.  The rocky wall
 of the shore is to the west, but you can go east and south.  You are
 well below the surface, but the lake floor is still a ways below.

>go north
 You try to swim against the undertow, but the current drags you down.

 The undertow drags you down, away from the cave.

 Lake Floor
    You're deep underwater, just above the rocky bottom of the lake.
 The water is swirling violently around a depression in the rocky floor
 -- you realize that it's a whirlpool!

>fill bucket
 What do you want to fill it with?

>water
 I don't see any water here.

>examine depression
 I don't know the word "depression".

>examine whirlpool
 I don't know the word "whirlpool".

>go down
 You can't swim against the whirlpool current.

 You're dragged helplessly toward the whirlpool.  You try to swim
 against it, but it's too strong.  You get nearer and nearer the hole.
 You start tumbling over and over in the turbulent waters; your head
 hits a rock, then your arm, then a leg.
    You're barely able to see what's happening as you're battered
 against the rocks, but you realize that you're falling through a narrow
 tunnel.  You're on your back, moving head-first through the tunnel.
    You lose track of how much time you're bounced around inside the
 tunnel, but you eventually emerge into a raging river pouring down the
 hillside.  You tumble and crash into even more rocks as you're washed
 down the rocky riverbed.
    You pass under a bridge, trying to grab onto something but finding
 nothing to hold onto.  The water continues to drag you downstream.  You
 manage to get your head above water long enough to look at what's
 coming, and you see a dense tangle of tree branches up ahead.  You
 brace yourself just in time, and crash into the thicket.
    It's difficult, but you manage to untangle yourself from the tree
 branches, and climb out onto the riverbank.

 River Bank
    You're on the west bank of a river.  The river is blocked to the
 south by a dense tangle of tree branches.  A path leads north.

>go east
 You can't get past the thicket.

 River Bank
    You're on the west bank of a river.  The water pours rapidly over
 huge rocks in the river.  A bridge crosses the river to the east.  A
 narrow path climbs steeply up the hill to the northwest, and you can
 follow the river to the south.

>examine bridge
 The bridge crosses the river to the east.

>look under bridge
 There's nothing under the bridge.

>go east
 Bridge
    You're at the center of a bridge that travels east and west across a

    There's a large hairy Troll standing in the center of the bridge,
 blocking your way.

 The Troll watches you suspiciously.

>examine troll
 It's a huge beast, standing ten feet high, covered with bristly black
 hair and wielding a double-edged axe.

 The Troll watches you suspiciously.

>ask troll about bridge
 The Troll doesn't appear to speak your language.  Your questions just
 seem to agitate it.

 The Troll watches you suspiciously.

>examine axe
 It looks viscous.  You wouldn't want to be caught along its line of
 travel, especially when wielded by the Troll.

    You're on a quiet, pleasant suburban street to the west of the city.
 Somehow, you always knew there would be suburbs in hell.  The street is
 lined with the type of tract housing they built copiously in California
 in the 1950's:  one-story buildings with flat roofs, horizontal lines,
 lots of windows, and poor construction quality.  A drab, faded
 blue-green house lies to the south, and a mini-mall lies to the north.
 The street leads east back into the city.  To the west, the street
 fades to a gravel path.

 A man whose clothes are on fire is running around in circles, flailing
 his arms and screaming.  He runs off to the east.

 A man whose clothes are on fire is running around in circles, flailing
 his arms and screaming.

>throw water on man
 You pour the water onto the burning man, and the flames are immediately
 extinguished.  He looks dazed for a moment, then sees that you're the
 kind person that did the good deed.  "Hey!"  he shouts at you.  "What
 did you do that for?  Now I've got to go back to work!"
    He fumbles through his pockets.  As he does, you notice a small
 metal object drop to the ground.  He eventually finds a matchbook in
 his pocket, and strikes a match; he tries to get his clothes burning
 again, but they're too wet.  "Oh, well, it's no use," he says, and
 stomps away.

 Amulette Shoppe
    You're in a small store that sells amulets of various kinds.  Glass
 display cases contain the amulets, which look like assorted types of
 jewelry.
    A shopkeeper is here waiting to help you.
    The shop keeper greets you as you walk in.  "How may I help you?"
 he asks cheerfully.

>ask shopkeeper about amulets
 "I have a very nice selection of authentic reproductions of actual
 amulets.  Of course, these amulets don't have the magical protective
 powers of the real amulets, but they make very nice jewelry."

>buy amulet
 I don't know how to buy the amulet.

>examine amulet
 The display cases contain a number of different amulets.  Most look
 like they're to be worn around the neck:  one is a big gold disk with
 complex etchings; a second one is a clear, light blue jewel stone; a
 third is an ivory carving of a boat.  Some look like other types of
 jewelry:  one is a simple silver ring, and another is a bracelet.

>inventory
 You have a printed note, a rope, a dead light bulb, a toolbox, a
 portable radio, a bucket, a pitchfork, a small metal key, and a
 parachute (being worn).  The toolbox seems to contain a crowbar and a
 yellow note.

>examine disk
 It's a large gold disk with complex etchings.  The pattern of etchings
 resembles a starburst:  a central circle with lines radiating.  The
 disk is attached to a gold chain, for wearing the amulet around the
 neck.

>ask shopkeeper about disk
 "This is a replica of an amulet that is said to provide protection
 against great heat.  I think the story is that it resembles the Sun,
 which is the source of all heat.  This one's been sold."

>ask shopkeeper about blue jewel
 "This is a very nice jewel, don't you think?  The amulet that it's
 based upon supposedly provides protection against extreme cold.  The
 jewel looks a little like a block of ice, you see.  This one's been
 sold."

>ask shopkeeper about boat
 "This is real ivory, which is very hard to find these days.  The
 original amulet was said to provide protection against sickness.  I
 think the idea is that you might become ill in a rowboat.  This one's
 been sold."

>ask shopkeeper about ring
 "This was is supposed to provide protection against blinding light.
 I'm not sure why it's a ring.  This one's been sold."

 protection against deafening sound.  This one's been sold."

 North of House
    You're in the poorly-tended, mostly dead yard of a house that lies
 to the south.  Now that you're closer to the house, you can see just
 how poorly built the house really is:  the primary building material
 seems to be cardboard stapled onto a rotting wooden frame.  The
 cardboard is ill-fitting and poorly aligned, leaving large gaps here
 and there.  You can enter the house to the south, and you can leave the
 yard to the north.

>go south
 As you start to open the door, you suddenly realize that it was locked.
 However, the construction quality of the house is so poor that the door
 pops open anyway.

 Kitchen
    You're in an old, dilapidated kitchen.  The appliances are all
 ancient and appear to be in poor condition; the linoleum floor has
 large gashes here and there where the plastic is curled back.  There's
 a sink, with a small cabinet underneath.  An exit leads north out into
 the yard, and passages lead west and south.
    You see a paper recycling bin here.

>examine bin
 It's a blue plastic bin, labeled "Paper", with the familiar recycling
 symbol underneath.  There's nothing in the paper recycling bin.

>take bin

 Dining Room
    You're in the dining room, which isn't really a separate room but
 just the northwest corner of the living room.  A table dominates the
 area.  A six-foot partition separates the dining room and living room
 from the kitchen, which is to the east (evidently, building a wall all
 the way up to the ceiling would have been too expensive).  The living
 room lies to the south.
    Sitting on the table is some junk mail.

>read mail
 It's one of those obvious pieces of junk mail that's been made up to
 look like something important, with phrases such as "Extremely Urgent!"
 and "Dated Material!"  and "Super-Express-Gram" stamped on the outside,
 but addressed to "Resident (Deceased)".  The letter reads:


 Hello, Decedent!

 Are you tired of the banality of everyday death in Hell?  Have you been
 to Heaven, but couldn't stand the boring "cultural" activities?  Do you
 long for the danger and excitement that you had when you were alive?

 Then join the Hades Explorers' Society!

 In the HES, we go to the parts of the underworld that ordinary people
 have never heard of, and we perform amazing feats that others wouldn't
 dream of, then we get together in our luxurious clubhouse and exchange
 stories over fine imported cognac and brandy.

 Because of your excellent credit history, you're PRE-APPROVED for
 membership in the HES.  All you need to do is to bring the enclosed
 Certificate of Invitation to our Headquarters.

 As far as we're concerned, you're as good as joined.  However, there's
 one catch.  The way to our headquarters is guarded by an evil Troll.
 The Troll will let none pass except for card-carrying members of the
 HES, or those who the Troll believes are worthy of membership.  The
 Troll unfortunately does not read, so the enclosed certificate will not
 help you.  Instead, you must prove yourself an accomplished Adventurer
 by bringing the Troll a great treasure.  For this we can offer you no
 guidance, but if you are truly an Adventurer, you will be up to the
 quest.

 Good luck!  We look forward to welcoming you!

 A piece of paper that was attached to the letter falls out onto the
 table.  You see that it's the Certificate of Invitation.

 Living Room
    You're in the living room, which is long and narrow, with a brick
 fireplace on the south wall; next to the fireplace is a tool holder.  A
 six-foot partition to the north separates the living room and kitchen.
 The northwest corner of the room serves as the dining room.  A hallway
 leads east.

>read certificate

 Master Bedroom
    You're in a large bedroom that's set up as an office.  In the center
 of the room is a large desk, on which is a personal computer and a big
 pile of paper.
    The hallway lies to the west.
    Sitting on the desk is a pencil sharpener, a bag of Cheese-Doodles,
 and an empty can of ToxiCola.
    A programmer is sitting in front of the computer, looking at a
 screenful of C code.

 The programmer looks pensively at the screen.

>examine programmer
 You can tell just looking at him that he does nothing but program all
 day:  he looks pale, even for a dead guy, and he's dressed in jeans and
 a t-shirt, the canonical uniform of the software developer.  Clipped to
 one of his pockets is a small plastic card.

 The programmer looks pensively at the screen.

>examine card
 You can't get a very good look (not without being impolite, at least).
 You can see "INFERNOLAB" spelled out in large letters.

 The programmer makes a few notes on some scratch paper.

>examine notes
 There's pieces of scratch paper spread out all over the desk, except
 for the half of the desk occupied by the computer.  Some of the pieces
 have a bunch of hex numbers with little arrows next to them; others
 have strange maps consisting of little squares (each with a label such
 as "Hall East") connected by lines, and others have lists with about
 half of the items crossed off and the other half squeezed into the last
 inch at the top of the page.

 The programmer looks pensively at the screen.

>examine screen
 It's a personal computer with the traditional accoutrements:  mouse,
 keyboard, monitor, and system CPU unit.  The screen is displaying a
 bunch of C code.

 The programmer types a bunch of code into the computer.

 end.  There's also a small compartment (which is closed).

 The programmer looks pensively at the screen.

>open compartment
 Which compartment do you mean, the radio compartment, or the sharpener
 compartment?

>sharpener
 Opening the sharpener compartment reveals an Infern-O-Vac battery.

 The programmer looks pensively at the screen.

 from dark wood and done in Danish Modern style.  One half of the desk
 is occupied by a computer, and most of the rest of the desk is covered
 with papers.  The desk has a drawer, which is closed.  On the desk you
 see a bag of Cheese-Doodles and an empty can of ToxiCola.

 The programmer makes a few notes on some scratch paper.

>open drawer
 The programmer stops you.  "Hey!  Leave that alone!  What do you think?
 That this is your own private hell?"

 Bathroom
    You're in a small bathroom.  In the center of a room is a sink, and
 over the sink is a medicine cabinet (which is closed).  The exit is to
 the south.

>open cabinet
 You try to open it, but it's stuck.

>open cabinet with crowbar
 The jammed frame creaks and moans, but it's no match for the crowbar,
 and it quickly opens with a loud cracking sound.  As it comes open, the
 mirror suddenly snaps out of the frame, and and crashes down onto the
 sink.  Glass flies everywhere.
    The programmer walks in, evidently having heard the commotion.  "It
 looks like you tried to open the medicine cabinet," he says.  "I should
 have warned you about that.  It's yet another of the high-quality
 accessories of this house.  The mirror always pops out when the
 medicine cabinet is opened."
    He walks out, and returns with a broom.  "I'll have to go get
 another mirror," he says as he sweeps up the glass.  "I'll just be a
 few minutes.  There's a mirror store right across the street."

 Cubicle
    One of the scientists recognizes you, and walks over.  "You're back
 for another try, are you?  Well, we normally don't like to use the same
 subjects multiple times, since it can throw off the results, but given
 your pathetic performance last time, I suppose that it can't do much
 harm.  It's not like you'll have any sort of advantage over the other
 subjects!"  She lets out a little laugh -- actually, it's more like a
 snort -- then turns serious again.  "Anyway, we're about to begin
 another experiment, so if you'll have a seat, we will proceed."  She
 walks away.

>sit
 (the chair)
 Okay, you're now sitting on the chair.
    As you sit down, the door behind you slides closed.  One of the
 scientists walks over to one of the others, and asks him, "Are you
 ready to begin, Doctor Merkwurtigblatt?"
    Merkwurtigblatt turns to face her.  "A moment please!"  He stands
 facing away from the cubicles, and runs his hands through his hair,
 inhaling deeply.  He then abruptly turns on his heel to face the
 cubicles.  He has short, curly black hair, and is wearing very thick,
 dark glasses, a white lab coat, and black leather gloves.
    "Thank you all for coming.  I'm Doctor Merkwurtigblatt, and I'll be
 your scientist today.  The experiment we're performing is in a field
 called Micro-Economics, which means that we're going to attempt to
 model a particular set of market forces under controlled conditions.
 As a result, you may find the experiment to be quite abstract, but
 don't worry; we don't actually want you to understand the point of this
 experiment, for two reasons.  First, if you knew what we were
 attempting to prove, it would bias the results.  And second, our
 theories might seem strange, or even laughable, to the layman, and you
 might be left with the impression that Economics is something less --
 much less -- than the precise and exacting science that we Economists
 know it to be. But you will be able to rest assured in your confusion
 that the economic future of Hell is in capable hands.  You can tell by
 our white labcoats, clipboards, and seemingly effortless use of large
 words that we are authority figures to be respected -- yes -- and
 feared!
    "Now, the rules of the experiment are quite simple.  Each of you is
 a trader in goods we will call 'widgets.'  The experiment will consist
 of a series of trading rounds.  In each trading round, you will conduct
 a transaction with the subject to your left and the one to your right.
    "We will be using what we Economists refer to as the Extended RSP
 Trading Model, which stands for Rock, Scissors, Paper.  We call it
 'extended' because we have added a new element that radically changes
 the equation:  dynamite.  In this model, dynamite pulverizes rock, rock
 crushes scissors, scissors cut paper -- yes, to shreds!  -- but paper
 covers dynamite.
    "You start with 5 widgets.  In each trading round, you will choose
 dynamite, rock, scissors, or paper, and your trading choice will be
 compared with the choices of those to your left and right.  The subject
 who prevails out of each group of three will acquire one widget each
 from the subjects on the left and right.  The experiment will proceed
 for five trading rounds.
    "As an incentive to do your best, if you manage to win every round,
 you will be awarded Twenty Hellmids at the end of the experiment.
 Choose carefully."

 Dr. Merkwurtigblatt writes some notes on his clipboard.  "Round 1," he
 announces.  "Please make your selections."

                Hell Nature Preserve


    You are now entering the Hell Nature Preserve.  This
    area has been set aside to preserve a small part of
    Hell in its original state, as it was before urbanization
    transformed Hell into what we know today.  Please don't

 Desolate Plain
    You're on the east edge of a desolate plain.  The ground is
 hard-packed sand covered with small, sharp rocks.  The plain extends to
 the west as far as the eye can see.  You notice that you can see for a
 very long distance; the ground does not seem to have any curvature at
 all, and there is no distinct horizon.  Only sheer distance seems to
 obscure your view of what may be an infinite plain.
    You can see a red glow to the north, and the city lies back to the
 east.  The plain stretches off without any distinguishing features in
 all other directions.

>take rock
 You can't have the rock.

>go west
 You walk for what seems like a very long time, but every time you look

>go north
 Wastelands
    You are on a vast, desolate plain.  The ground is hot here; steam
 rises from cracks in the dry soil, and the warm, damp air smells
 strongly of sulfur.  The area is littered with debris:  decaying bones
 of strange animals, broken parts from ancient machinery, pools of tar
 and oil.  The plain continues off in all directions; it was somewhat
 more pleasant to the south.  A bright red glow comes from the north.

>examine bones
 The bones are of no animals you've ever seen.  Some of them look almost
 human, but not quite.  As you look more closely, you notice a
 human-looking skeleton underneath some of the strange animal bones.

>examine skeleton
 You can't see much; it's mostly covered by the strange animal bones.

>more animal bones
 I don't know the word "more".

>take skeleton
 You can't get to the skeleton; it's covered by the strange animal

 As your hand approaches the pile of bones, bright blue electric arcs
 jump toward you.  You jump back in pain as the electricity shoots

>wear gloves
 Okay, you're now wearing the pair of rubber gloves.

>remove bones
 As your hand approaches the pile of bones, bright blue electric arcs
 jump toward you, but the rubber gloves provide some protection.  As you
 start to move the pile, it collapses, and sparks fly throughout the
 pile.  You jump back from the fireworks.  Once the smoke has cleared,
 you see that a human skeleton has been uncovered.

>examine skeleton
 The skeleton has been stripped of flesh; only the bright white bones
 remain.  You notice that the skeleton's bony hand is clutching a small
 card.

 Most of the parts are gigantic, some standing several feet high.  The
 parts are all made of dark, rough metals that look like wrought iron;
 they have myriad sharp protrusions and appendages.  You can't imagine

 Top of Crater
    You're standing at the top of an enormous crater, which is at least
 several hundred feet in diameter and almost as deep.  Strangely, the
 ground around the crater is not lifted as you would expect of an impact
 crater; it is more like the result of excavation.  The sides of the
 crater are very steep, but it looks as though you could climb down with
 some effort.  The depths of the crater are obscured by a dense fog, but
 a wavering red glow penetrates the fog from below. Overpowering
 sulfurous fumes fill the air, and waves of heat and steam rise from
 below.

>examine glow
 I don't know the word "glow".

>examine fog
 I don't know the word "fog".

>go down
 Bottom of Crater
    You're at the bottom of the crater.  The floor of the crater is
 littered with huge, sharp rocks, making travel very difficult, and the
 ground is so hot that it glows red.  It looks as though you could climb
 back up the crater wall. To the northeast is a huge stone slab.

    One of the large rocks on the pit floor suddenly bursts into flames.
 You jump back and shield your eyes from the blinding fire.  After a few
 moments, the fire subsides, and all that's left of the rock is a thick
 black cloud of sulfurous fumes that slowly dissipates.

>go northeast
 You'll have to move the huge stone slab out of the way first.

    You hear a rumbling sound under your feet.  The rumbling increases
 in intensity until the sound is deafening, and the ground is shaking
 violently.  As you try to maintain your balance, several rocks are
 suddenly blown upward as a huge steam geyser blasts through the
 surface.  You jump backward away from the jet of pressurized steam.
 Eventually, the geyser weakens, and finally stops.

>examine slab
 It's about ten feet tall and five feet wide.  In the center of the
 slab, you notice three small holes, arranged in a horizontal line, six
 inches apart.

    You hear a noise overhead, and look up to see a number of rocks come
 sliding down the side of the crater.  You jump out of the way just in
 time.

>examine first hole
 I don't know the word "first".

>examine holes
 There are three holes, each about half an inch in diameter, arranged in
 a horizontal line, and spaced about six inches apart.  You can't tell
 how deep the holes are.

    A stream of molten lava abruptly starts pouring out of the side of
 the crater.  The glowing stream of liquid rock slowly cools into yet
 more hot rocks at the floor of the crater.

>put poker in holes
 That doesn't seem to fit.

    A thick cloud of dust drifts down from the side of the crater.  You
 watch the cloud as it slowly meanders through the complex air currents
 driven by the hot crater floor.  As the cloud approaches the hot rocks
 at the bottom of the crater, it suddenly catches fire; you leap back as
 the cloud almost instantly vanishes in a searing wall of flame.

>put pitchfork in holes
 You slide the pitchfork's prongs into the holes, and discover that it's
 an exact fit!  You hear a deep, loud rumbling sound from behind the
 slab.  You cautiously remove the pitchfork from the holes, and stand
 back.  The slab slowly starts to rotate.  It turns until a narrow
 passage is revealed to the northeast, then the rumbling ceases.

 Ledge
    You're on a ledge fifty feet above the floor of a huge cave.  The
 cave below is engulfed in flames.  Fire shoots out of vents in the
 rock; pools of oil on the ground burn slowly, releasing thick black
 clouds of smoke; even some of the rocks themselves smolder and burn.
 Across the cave on the north side, you can see a wide, dark lake; some
 distance into the lake is a small island.  You can probably climb down
 the gently sloping walls of the cave to the floor below, and a narrow
 passage leads outside to the crater to the southwest.

>go down
 Floor of Fire Cave
    You're on the floor of the huge cave of fire.  It's extremely
 difficult to see where you're going due to all of the fire and smoke.
 High above on the cave wall, you can see a ledge; you think you'll be
 able to climb back up the wall.  The only path you can see through the
 cave is to the north.

>go north
 You slowly make your way through the dense flames.  You realize that
 this cave must be totally devoid of oxygen -- certainly it's all being
 consumed by the raging fires.  It's lucky you're already dead, you
 think to yourself.

 Rocky Shore
    You're at the north end of the fire cave, standing on the rocky
 shore of a huge, still lake.  The water is black -- so black that it
 barely reflects the brilliant light of the fires.  In the middle of the
 lake, you can see a small island.  The fire cave lies to the south, and
 you could wade into the water to the north.

>examine island
 The island is some distance into the lake.  You can't make out any
 details from here.

>examine lake
 You dip your hand into the dark water.  The water is hot and thick.  As
 you pull your hand out, and see the dark red fluid dripping off, you
 realize that the lake is filled not with water, but with human blood.
 You jump back and shake your hand violently to clean it of the
 horrifying liquid.

>go north
 Lake
    You're wading in the lake.  The shore is to the south.  An island

 onto the counter and hands you a test.  "Fill this out, and don't
 cheat.  Bring it back to me when you're finished with it."

 The DMV employee looks at you impatiently.  "Have you finished the test

 The DMV employee looks at you impatiently.  "Have you finished the test
 yet?"

>give test to employee
 She looks over your test skeptically.  "Fine," she says, "you got 80%.
 You pass."  She takes out a camera and snaps a picture of you before
 you realize what's going on.  She walks away from the counter (leaving
 the room totally devoid of employees) and remains in a back room for
 several minutes.  Finally, she returns, and hands you your driver's
 license!

 [Your score just went up.]

 The DMV employee looks at you, obviously annoyed by your continued
 presence.  "What more could you want?  Go bother someone else."

 Celestial Security Office

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Have you ever
 filed a claim against your automobile, homeowner's, renter's,
 malpractice, health, or dental insurance?"  The woman replies, "I had
 an automobile accident in 1982, but it wasn't my fault, and I had
 regular dental checkups between 1981 and 1990 that were billed to my
 dental insurance."  The officer slowly and carefully transcribes the
 information onto the application form.

>look
 Celestial Security Office
    You're in the Celestial Security Office.  At one end of the room is
 a counter, and next to the counter is a wastebasket that's full of
 crumpled up paper.  The exit is to the east, and a door behind the
 counter leads west.
    Behind the counter is a middle-aged man dressed in a light blue
 Celestial Security Administration uniform.  He's helping a young woman
 fill out an application form.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "In what year did
 Columbus discover America?"  The woman replies, "1492."  The officer
 slowly and carefully transcribes the information onto the application
 form.

>put paper in bin
 Which paper do you mean, the certificate, the yellow note, or the waste
 paper?

>waste
 The Celestial Security officer stops you.  "Hey!  You're not our
 regular maintenance worker!  Where's your uniform?"  He makes you put
 the papers back.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Are you married?"
 The woman replies, "Yes."  The officer slowly and carefully transcribes
 the information onto the application form.

 The Celestial Security officer moves to block your way.  "I'm sorry,
 only authorized personnel are allowed in the back office."

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Is your spouse
 living or dead?"  The woman replies, "Living."  The officer slowly and
 carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

>examine dial
 The radio dial can be turned to settings numbered from 1 to 999.  It's
 currently set to 319.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "What is your
 spouse's life expectancy?"  The woman replies, "72 years."  The officer
 slowly and carefully transcribes the information onto the application
 form.

>turn dial to 666
 Okay, it's now turned to 666.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Do you now or
 have you ever smoked?"  The woman replies, "No."  The officer slowly
 and carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

>turn on radio
 The radio is now turned on.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Do you now or
 have you ever belonged to, endorsed, supported, aided and abetted,
 given comfort to, made a contribution to, sent back a business reply
 card from, or developed an advertising slogan for a 'light beer'
 manufacturer?"  The woman replies, "No, never."  The officer slowly and
 carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

 The radio emits static.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Jane lives one
 mile from school, and Billy lives four miles away.  If Jill walks to
 school at three miles per hour, how fast must Billy ride his bike to
 arrive at school at the same time as Jane if they both leave home at
 the same time?"  The woman replies, "12 miles per hour."  The officer
 slowly and carefully transcribes the information onto the application
 form.

 The radio emits static.

>set dial to 911
 I don't know the word "set".

>turn dial to 911
 Okay, it's now turned to 911.

>turn dial to 6
 Okay, it's now turned to 6.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Have you ever
 experienced palpitations, heart murmurs, shortness of breath,
 convulsions, seizures, paroxysms, blurred vision, dizziness,
 queasiness, or insomnia?"  The woman replies, "Yes, I regularly have
 trouble sleeping."  The officer slowly and carefully transcribes the
 information onto the application form.

 The radio emits static.

>turn dial to 24
 Okay, it's now turned to 24.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "Hot enough for

 slowly and carefully transcribes the information onto the application
 form.

 The announcer comes back on the radio.  "That's all the time we have
 for today's edition of Vehicle Code Forum.  Next on, live coverage of
 the swearing-in ceremony for new civil servants in the Ministry of
 Information."

>turn off radio
 The radio is now turned off.

 The Celestial Security officer sighs.  "Oh, my," he says, "I did it
 again!  I accidentally wrote down your last name in the space for your
 first name.  This form is just so confusing."  He crumples up the form
 and throws it into the wastebasket.  "Oh, well," he says, "we'll just
 have to start over."  He reaches beneath the counter and gets out a new
 form.

>inventory
 You have a printed note, a rope, a dead light bulb, a toolbox, a
 portable radio, a bucket, a pitchfork, a small metal key, a parachute
 (being worn), a paper recycling bin, a pair of rubber gloves (being
 worn), a certificate, a poker, a brush, a shovel, a pencil sharpener, a
 pencil, an Infern-O-Vac battery, a dollar bill, a cigarette box, a
 cigarette, a check, and a driver's license.  The toolbox seems to
 contain a crowbar and a yellow note.  The radio compartment seems to
 contain a DuraHell battery.

 The Celestial Security officer asks the young woman, "What is your
 middle initial?"  The woman replies, "G."  The officer slowly and
 carefully transcribes the information onto the application form.

 Bottom of Crater

    You hear a noise overhead, and look up to see a number of rocks come
 sliding down the side of the crater.  You jump out of the way just in
 time.

>examine fire
 I don't see any fire here.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

    A stream of molten lava abruptly starts pouring out of the side of
 the crater.  The glowing stream of liquid rock slowly cools into yet
 more hot rocks at the floor of the crater.

>go northeast

>go southwest
 Bottom of Crater

    A thick cloud of dust drifts down from the side of the crater.  You
 watch the cloud as it slowly meanders through the complex air currents
 driven by the hot crater floor.  As the cloud approaches the hot rocks
 at the bottom of the crater, it suddenly catches fire; you leap back as
 the cloud almost instantly vanishes in a searing wall of flame.

>examine lava
 I don't see any lava here.

>examine cigarette
 It looks like an ordinary cigarette to me.

    One of the large rocks on the pit floor suddenly bursts into flames.
 You jump back and shield your eyes from the blinding fire.  After a few
 moments, the fire subsides, and all that's left of the rock is a thick
 black cloud of sulfurous fumes that slowly dissipates.

>smoke cigarette
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>inventory
 You have a printed note, a rope, a dead light bulb, a toolbox, a
 portable radio, a bucket, a pitchfork, a small metal key, a parachute

 pencil, an Infern-O-Vac battery, a dollar bill, a cigarette box, a
 cigarette, a check, and a driver's license.  The toolbox seems to
 contain a crowbar and a yellow note.  The radio compartment seems to
 contain a DuraHell battery.

    You hear a rumbling sound under your feet.  The rumbling increases
 in intensity until the sound is deafening, and the ground is shaking
 violently.  As you try to maintain your balance, several rocks are
 suddenly blown upward as a huge steam geyser blasts through the
 surface.  You jump backward away from the jet of pressurized steam.
 Eventually, the geyser weakens, and finally stops.

>examine light bulb
 It's a dead light bulb.  It seems slightly charred inside.

    You hear a noise overhead, and look up to see a number of rocks come
 sliding down the side of the crater.  You jump out of the way just in
 time.

>cigarette box
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine cigarette box
 There's nothing in the cigarette box.

    A shopkeeper is here waiting to help you.
    The shop keeper greets you as you walk in.  "How may I help you?"
 he asks cheerfully.

>ask keeper about bracelet
 "The original amulet upon which this is based is said to provide
 protection against deafening sound.  This one's been sold."

>buy bracelet
 You can't possibly afford it.  Besides, it's only a genuine replica;
 you would probably find the real thing more useful.

    You're crouching in the intricate network of rails above the lobby
 floor.  You can't stand up, because the ceiling is only a few feet
 above the top of the rails, but there's plenty of room to move around.
 You can go down, back to the lobby floor.
    In the ceiling, you notice an access panel.  The panel is currently

 Cubicle
    One of the scientists recognizes you, and walks over.  "I'm sorry,
 but we can't allow you to participate again, now that you know all
 about the experiment.  It would throw off the results if you were to
 participate.  If you're looking for more money, I've heard that
 Infernolab Missiles and Space is looking for subjects in the nosecone
 crash testing lab."  She walks away.

>look
 Cubicle
    You're in a small cubicle, bordered on the east and west by
 six-foot-high partitions, and on the south by a desk.  There's a chair
 that occupies most of the rest of the space.  A door is to the north;
 the door is open.
    On the other side of the desk is a very large, bright white room.
 Several men and women are walking about the room, consulting with each
 other; each is wearing a long white lab coat, and carrying a black
 metal clipboard stuffed with papers.  Overhead, you notice a small
 opening in the ceiling.  Covering the opening is a mirror.  In the
 mirror, you notice that you can easily see the people in the cubicles
 on either side of your cubicle.

 hell.  You don't have to do anything wrong to end up here.  New souls
 are randomly assigned to Heaven or Hell based on the last four digits
 of your Celestial Security Number.  The Heaven-Hell border was opened a

>put mirror in cabinet
 You carefully put the mirror back in the frame.  It doesn't fit all
 that well, but it you manage to wedge it into place.

>pry cabinet with crowbar
 The jammed frame creaks and moans, but it's no match for the crowbar,
 and it quickly opens with a loud cracking sound.  As it comes open, the
 mirror suddenly snaps out of the frame, and and crashes down onto the
 sink.  Glass flies everywhere.
    The programmer walks in, evidently having heard the commotion.  "It
 looks like you tried to open the medicine cabinet," he says.  "I should
 have warned you about that.  It's yet another of the high-quality
 accessories of this house.  The mirror always pops out when the
 medicine cabinet is opened."
    He walks out, and returns with a broom.  "I'll have to go get
 another mirror," he says as he sweeps up the glass.  "I'll just be a
 few minutes.  There's a mirror store right across the street."

 Lab
    You're in a large laboratory filled with strange equipment -- huge
 coils of wire, glowing translucent plastic tubes, panels of randomly
 flashing lights, and in the center of it all is a large glass booth,
 big enough for a person to stand in.  A door leads south.
    There's a technician here, idly sitting reading a book.

 The technician starts telling you about a computer game.  "Have you
 ever tried to pick up one of the cursed emeralds?"  he asks.  "It's
 pretty amazing how quickly your character gets killed when you do."

>examine book
 It seems to be a book that describes a role-playing game of some kind.

 The technician pages through his book.

 "SYSTEM ACTIVATED."  The room begins to vibrate, and a loud rumbling
 sound echoes all around.  A glowing fog starts to surround you, and the
 vibration and rumbling are gradually muffled.  Soon, you near nothing,
 and see only the strange glow.  You feel yourself losing your balance;
 you squint your eyes trying to peer through the fog, and reach out for
 the edge of the booth, but you find nothing where the booth was.  You
 feel yourself falling forward, and you reach out to brace yourself, but
 you just keep falling.
    You start to hear a distant rumbling sound.  The noise grows
 steadily louder and closer, and you start to notice vague shapes out in
 the fog.  The shapes draw closer, and the rumbling grows louder.
 Suddenly, the glow and the rumble are gone.

 Basement
    You're in a large, unfinished basement.  The walls are gray
 cinderblock; some light is provided by a bare bulb hanging from the
 ceiling.  A stairwell leads up.
    In the east wall is a strange, glowing portal.  You realize that
 it's the interdimensional portal that brought you here.

 A group of people standing around the room suddenly notices your
 presence.  They all gather around you, appearing slightly frightened
 but curious.

 The group of people is here, watching you carefully but keeping their
 distance. One of the reporters narrates her report:  "Top scientists
 are baffled by the continued presence of paranormal activity in this
 otherwise quiet rural home.  Many believe this can only be the work of
 Satan, while others are not so sure."

 storage trunk is standing on one end near the trap door.
    Sitting on the storage trunk is a silver ring.

 You hear several voices in the distance saying things like "where did

 You manage to nudge it just slightly, causing it to rock back and forth

 trap door.

 You float up higher.  The same strange fog that brought you here
 envelopes you again.  You feel yourself being pulled backwards,
 downwards.  Soon, you find yourself back in...

 Lab, in the booth
    You're in a large laboratory filled with strange equipment -- huge
 coils of wire, glowing translucent plastic tubes, panels of randomly
 flashing lights, and in the center of it all is a large glass booth,
 big enough for a person to stand in.  A door leads south.
    The booth seems to contain a printed note, a rope, a dead light
 bulb, a toolbox, a portable radio, a bucket, a pitchfork, a small metal
 key, a parachute, a pair of rubber gloves, a certificate, a poker, a
 brush, a shovel, a pencil sharpener, a pencil, an Infern-O-Vac battery,
 a dollar bill, a cigarette box, a cigarette, a check, a driver's
 license, a paper recycling bin, an empty can of ToxiCola, a bag of
 Cheese-Doodles, a yellow note, a pillow, an ID card, and a maintenance
 uniform.

 Hallway
    You're in a hallway.  A doorway leads south, another leads north,

 also a room to the east, labeled "Maintenance".

>go south
 Rocket Lab
    You're in a large lab filled with equipment, all clustered around a
 disassembled missile.  You never realized how big and complex missiles
 really are; you always pictured them as oversized model rockets, with
 big cylinders full of fuel that you just light on fire and watch it go.
 The missile here is large and complicated.  The rocket motor is lying
 on the floor, with all its cover plates removed, revealing a complex
 array of pipes and electronic controls.  Lying next to the rocket motor
 is the nose cone and the heat shield, which have been disassembled and
 removed.

>examine shield
 It's a big piece of a strange, black, flexible material, about half an
 inch thick.  It's shaped like a shallow bowl about three feet in
 diameter.

>examine cone
 It's been disassembled:  the cover panels have all been removed to
 reveal a network of wires and circuit boards.

 also a room to the east, labeled "Maintenance".

>swipe card in slot
 I don't know the word "swipe".

 Lava Cave

>enter shield

>drop shield
 Dropped.

>enter shield
 Okay, you're now in the heat shield.

>enter river
 The searing heat of the lava shoots through your body, making you try
 desperately to escape the river.  As you flail around, though, you
 start to realize that the lava isn't harming you, despite the intense
 pain.  As you start to get used to the blistering heat, you notice that
 you're being swept rapidly downstream...

 River of Lava

 The lava flow starts to carry you downstream.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Lava Cave, in the heat shield
    You're in a large, cylindrical cave with smooth, black walls.
 Running through the south end of the cave is a wide, swiftly-flowing
 river of lava, which flows downhill to the east.  The lava pours in
 through an orifice in the western wall.  An exit leads back outside to
 the north.
    You see a heat shield here.

 and seems easily able to withstand the heat.  You hold onto it so it

>wait
 Time passes...

 You're carried rapidly to the south by the flowing lava.

 River of Lava, in the heat shield
    The river of lava is flowing through the cave swiftly to the south.
 To the west is a shore that appears to open into a cave.  The cave has
 many stalagmites sticking up from its floor; one particularly large
 stalagmite right on the shore -- only about ten feet away from you --
 is at least three feet tall.
    There's a faint light downstream, and you hear a loud rushing noise
 from the south.

>throw rope at stalagmite
 You throw the rope at the stalagmite, but your aim isn't good enough;
 the rope falls short.  You obviously could use some practice.

 The lava sweeps you along to the south.

 Top of Lavafall, in the heat shield
    The cave abruptly opens into the night sky, and you realize that
 you're at the top of a cliff.  The lava is pouring over the edge of the
 cliff and falling hundreds of feet down the side of the mountain below.

>jump
 Wheeee!

 Before you can do anything, the river carries you over the edge of the
 lavafall.  You fall and fall, tumbling and flailing your arms and legs,
 catching a glimpse of the bottom of the lavafall lost in the rocks far
 below.  Suddenly, you hit something, and your fall stops abruptly.

 Ledge near Lavafall
    You're on a ledge just west of, and halfway up, a huge lavafall.
 The lava pours down with a deafening rumbling sound.  The narrow ledge
 seems to continue to the northwest.
    You see a heat shield here.

>take shield
 Taken.

>go northwest
 Ledge
    You're on a narrow ledge high up on the mountainside.  The ledge
 continues to the southeast and northwest.

>go northwest
 You walk carefully along the ledge, but you suddenly hit a loose spot.
 You try to maintain your footing, but the rock crumbles under you, and
 you go sliding down the mountainside.  You finally stop falling, and
 you find yourself on a rocky hillside you've seen before.

 Rocky Hillside
    You're on a gently sloping, rocky hillside at the base of a tall
 mountain.  The granite surface of the hillside hosts no vegetation.
 Looming high above to the east is the steep cone of a volcano; clouds
 of dark smoke rise steadily above the cone.  You can climb into the
 mountains to the east, and you can also go north, back to the road.

>go east
 Mountainside
    You're fairly high up on the side of the mountain -- you'd guess
 that you're around two thousand feet up.  (Have you noticed that they
 use the English system of measurements in Hell?  What else would you
 expect?)  You can go down the mountain to the west, and the volcano's
 cone looms above to the east.  A small opening appears to lead into a
 cave to the south.  You can also travel along a path to the north, and
 a narrow passage to the southeast.
    You have an excellent view of Hell from here.  The tall buildings
 downtown all seem tiny from this distance and altitude, except for the
 Tower -- even from here, you can't see the top.  The Tower looks like a
 thin, gleaming string stretching from the ground up into the dark sky.
 As your eyes follow the Tower up into the sky, you realize that you're
 high enough above the surface now that you can see stars above -- so
 many stars, all so bright, that it's quite well lit here.

>examine tower
 From here, the tower looks like a silver thread against the black night
 sky.  Even from this distance, you can't see how high the tower is --
 it goes up into the sky as far as you can see.

    The woman responds, "That's up to you.  Dead people have no material

 eat or sleep every forty or fifty turns, which is a real convenience.
 However, most people like to feel useful, and derive a sense of purpose

 onto the boat's deck.  To the north lies the entrance to a large

 "SYSTEM ACTIVATED."  The room begins to vibrate, and a loud rumbling
 sound echoes all around.  A glowing fog starts to surround you, and the
 vibration and rumbling are gradually muffled.  Soon, you near nothing,
 and see only the strange glow.  You feel yourself losing your balance;
 you squint your eyes trying to peer through the fog, and reach out for
 the edge of the booth, but you find nothing where the booth was.  You
 feel yourself falling forward, and you reach out to brace yourself, but
 you just keep falling.
    You start to hear a distant rumbling sound.  The noise grows
 steadily louder and closer, and you start to notice vague shapes out in
 the fog.  The shapes draw closer, and the rumbling grows louder.
 Suddenly, the glow and the rumble are gone.

 A group of people standing around the room suddenly notices your

 The group of people is here, watching you carefully but keeping their

 in front of him, his hands trembling.  "In the name of God, I condemn
 this talisman of evil to eternal damnation!  Let this foul object be
 taken from the world by this portal of Satan, never to return from the
 infernal regions!  Now, evil spirit, with this ring, I thee damn!"  He
 throws the ring into the portal, and it disappears with a flash of
 sickly green light.  "Begone, evil spirit!  Return thee forthwith to
 Perdition's Flames!"

 "SYSTEM ACTIVATED."  The room begins to vibrate, and a loud rumbling
 sound echoes all around.  A glowing fog starts to surround you, and the
 vibration and rumbling are gradually muffled.  Soon, you near nothing,
 and see only the strange glow.  You feel yourself losing your balance;
 you squint your eyes trying to peer through the fog, and reach out for
 the edge of the booth, but you find nothing where the booth was.  You
 feel yourself falling forward, and you reach out to brace yourself, but
 you just keep falling.
    You start to hear a distant rumbling sound.  The noise grows
 steadily louder and closer, and you start to notice vague shapes out in
 the fog.  The shapes draw closer, and the rumbling grows louder.
 Suddenly, the glow and the rumble are gone.

 Lava Cave

>put shield in river. enter shield
 You put the heat shield in the lava -- it floats on the flowing lava,
 and seems easily able to withstand the heat.  You hold onto it so it
 doesn't float away.

 Okay, you're now in the heat shield.

 The lava flow starts to carry you downstream.

>verbose
 Okay, now in VERBOSE mode.
 River of Lava, in the heat shield
    The river of lava is flowing swiftly downhill to the east.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The swift river of lava sweeps you downstream to the east.

 Bend in River, in the heat shield
    The river of lava turns from east to south here.

>wait
 Time passes...

 You're carried rapidly to the south by the flowing lava.

 River of Lava, in the heat shield
    The river of lava is flowing through the cave swiftly to the south.
 To the west is a shore that appears to open into a cave.  The cave has
 many stalagmites sticking up from its floor; one particularly large
 stalagmite right on the shore -- only about ten feet away from you --
 is at least three feet tall.
    There's a faint light downstream, and you hear a loud rushing noise
 from the south.

>lasso stalagmite
 (with the rope)
 You throw the rope at the stalagmite, but your aim isn't good enough;
 the rope falls short.  You obviously could use some practice.

 The lava sweeps you along to the south.

 Top of Lavafall, in the heat shield
    The cave abruptly opens into the night sky, and you realize that
 you're at the top of a cliff.  The lava is pouring over the edge of the
 cliff and falling hundreds of feet down the side of the mountain below.

>go north
 You're not going anywhere until you get off of the heat shield.

 Before you can do anything, the river carries you over the edge of the
 lavafall.  You fall and fall, tumbling and flailing your arms and legs,
 catching a glimpse of the bottom of the lavafall lost in the rocks far
 below.  Suddenly, you hit something, and your fall stops abruptly.

 Ledge near Lavafall
    You're on a ledge just west of, and halfway up, a huge lavafall.
 The lava pours down with a deafening rumbling sound.  The narrow ledge
 seems to continue to the northwest.
    You see a heat shield here.

>take shield
 Taken.

>nw.nw.w
 Ledge
    You're on a narrow ledge high up on the mountainside.  The ledge
 continues to the southeast and northwest.

 You walk carefully along the ledge, but you suddenly hit a loose spot.
 You try to maintain your footing, but the rock crumbles under you, and
 you go sliding down the mountainside.  You finally stop falling, and
 you find yourself on a rocky hillside you've seen before.

 Rocky Hillside
    You're on a gently sloping, rocky hillside at the base of a tall
 mountain.  The granite surface of the hillside hosts no vegetation.
 Looming high above to the east is the steep cone of a volcano; clouds
 of dark smoke rise steadily above the cone.  You can climb into the
 mountains to the east, and you can also go north, back to the road.

 The terrain is too rocky that way.

>go east
 Mountainside
    You're fairly high up on the side of the mountain -- you'd guess
 that you're around two thousand feet up.  (Have you noticed that they
 use the English system of measurements in Hell?  What else would you
 expect?)  You can go down the mountain to the west, and the volcano's
 cone looms above to the east.  A small opening appears to lead into a
 cave to the south.  You can also travel along a path to the north, and
 a narrow passage to the southeast.
    You have an excellent view of Hell from here.  The tall buildings
 downtown all seem tiny from this distance and altitude, except for the
 Tower -- even from here, you can't see the top.  The Tower looks like a
 thin, gleaming string stretching from the ground up into the dark sky.
 As your eyes follow the Tower up into the sky, you realize that you're
 high enough above the surface now that you can see stars above -- so
 many stars, all so bright, that it's quite well lit here.

>go north
 Lake Shore
    You're on the shore of a beautiful clear blue mountain lake.  The
 lake is huge -- it looks like it's almost a mile across.  The water is
 very still and clear.  The lake is circled by high cliffs, except here,
 where you could easily wade into the water.  A path leads south.

>go east
 Swimming on the lake
    You're swimming on the lake.  The shore is to the west.  A rocky
 ledge to the north prevents travel in that direction, but you can go
 east or south.
    You didn't notice from the shore, but there seems to be a very
 strong undertow pulling you underwater.

 You try to fight the undertow, but it's just too strong.  It drags you
 underwater.

 Underwater
    You're underwater in the lake.  To the north is a rocky wall, but
 there's an opening that could be the mouth of a cave.  The rocky wall
 of the shore is to the west, but you can go east and south.  You are
 well below the surface, but the lake floor is still a ways below.

>go north
 You try to swim against the undertow, but the current drags you down.

 The undertow drags you down, away from the cave.

 Lake Floor
    You're deep underwater, just above the rocky bottom of the lake.
 The water is swirling violently around a depression in the rocky floor
 -- you realize that it's a whirlpool!

>go up
 You can't swim against the whirlpool current.

 You're dragged helplessly toward the whirlpool.  You try to swim
 against it, but it's too strong.  You get nearer and nearer the hole.
 You start tumbling over and over in the turbulent waters; your head
 hits a rock, then your arm, then a leg.
    You're barely able to see what's happening as you're battered
 against the rocks, but you realize that you're falling through a narrow
 tunnel.  You're on your back, moving head-first through the tunnel.
    You lose track of how much time you're bounced around inside the
 tunnel, but you eventually emerge into a raging river pouring down the
 hillside.  You tumble and crash into even more rocks as you're washed
 down the rocky riverbed.
    You pass under a bridge, trying to grab onto something but finding
 nothing to hold onto.  The water continues to drag you downstream.  You
 manage to get your head above water long enough to look at what's
 coming, and you see a dense tangle of tree branches up ahead.  You
 brace yourself just in time, and crash into the thicket.
    It's difficult, but you manage to untangle yourself from the tree
 branches, and climb out onto the riverbank.

 River Bank
    You're on the west bank of a river.  The river is blocked to the
 south by a dense tangle of tree branches.  A path leads north.

 an open-cockpit, high-wing tail-dragger.  It's painted a faded yellow.
    The exit is to the south.

    One of the large rocks on the pit floor suddenly bursts into flames.
 You jump back and shield your eyes from the blinding fire.  After a few
 moments, the fire subsides, and all that's left of the rock is a thick
 black cloud of sulfurous fumes that slowly dissipates.

    Someone at the rear of the room raises her hand.  "Yes, you at the

    "I'm a very rich individual and I refuse to be treated in this
 manner.  I've made charitable contributions all my life, and we've
 never beaten the help -- not when they didn't deserve it, anyway, the
 lazy bastards.  This is an outrage!  You can be sure you will be
 hearing from my lawyer!  What do you have to say for yourself?"  she
 asks.
    The woman responds, "I'm sure you have a very good case.  However,
 I'm afraid that the legal system in Hell is based on the United States
 judicial system.  So, as you must know, the courts are so overloaded
 with frivolous lawsuits that legitimate claims, such as yours
 undoubtedly is, cannot be accepted.  Any lawsuit found to have merit is
 immediately and summarily dismissed.  There are some very good personal
 injury lawyers that you might wish to contact, though."

>take chair

    Someone at the left of the room raises his hand.  "Yes, you at the

    "I used to drive nitro-burning ground-pounding six-second funny
 cars.  Is there any chance that I'll be able to shake hands with the
 devil while I scream through the gates of Hell?"  he asks.
    The woman responds, "I'm afraid that, due to the volume of new

    "Is this heaven or hell?"  she asks.
    The woman responds, "You know what they say -- if you have to ask
 --" she chuckles.  "It is technically hell, although that's such a
 loaded word that we don't like to use it.  Most ideas people have about
 hell are very outdated.  Ever since the deregulation of the afterlife
 industry, we've had to compete with Heaven for eternal souls -- because
 you're free to switch to Heaven at any time.  So, we've been
 modernizing!  There really isn't much eternal torment these days, for
 example.  And, thanks to the Environmental Clean-up Superfund, we have
 the brimstone problem mostly under control at this point."

 hell.  You don't have to do anything wrong to end up here.  New souls
 are randomly assigned to Heaven or Hell based on the last four digits
 of your Celestial Security Number.  The Heaven-Hell border was opened a

 into the wall, and the metal rips open.  You suddenly find yourself

 Crawlway
    You're at the west end of a crawlway.  Large metal pipes run along
 the walls.  The crawlway continues to the east.
    One of the pipes ends here.  The end of the pipe is not connected to
 anything at all; you assume it's being left for future expansion.  Just
 before the end of the pipe is a valve, evidently to cut off the flow of
 whatever the pipe carries until something is attached here.  The valve
 is currently closed.
    The west wall of the crawlway has been ripped open (you think you
 may recall what caused the hole).  The hole seems to lead outside, and
 is easily large enough for you to go through.

>go west
 You step through the hole, and discover that you're about twenty feet
 up in the air alongside the building.  As you fall, you notice there's
 a dumpster below you.  You close your eyes, and land with a thud in the

    You're barely able to see what's happening as you're battered

 tunnel.  You're on your back, moving head-first through the tunnel.
    You lose track of how much time you're bounced around inside the

 hillside.  You tumble and crash into even more rocks as you're washed
 down the rocky riverbed.
    You pass under a bridge, trying to grab onto something but finding
 nothing to hold onto.  The water continues to drag you downstream.  You
 manage to get your head above water long enough to look at what's

 cone looms above to the east.  A small opening appears to lead into a
 cave to the south.  You can also travel along a path to the north, and
 a narrow passage to the southeast.
    You have an excellent view of Hell from here.  The tall buildings
 downtown all seem tiny from this distance and altitude, except for the
 Tower -- even from here, you can't see the top.  The Tower looks like a
 thin, gleaming string stretching from the ground up into the dark sky.
 As your eyes follow the Tower up into the sky, you realize that you're
 high enough above the surface now that you can see stars above -- so
 many stars, all so bright, that it's quite well lit here.

 Lava Cave
    You're in a large, cylindrical cave with smooth, black walls.
 Running through the south end of the cave is a wide, swiftly-flowing
 river of lava, which flows downhill to the east.  The lava pours in
 through an orifice in the western wall.  An exit leads back outside to
 the north.

>wait

>put shield in river. enter shield
 You put the heat shield in the lava -- it floats on the flowing lava,

 River of Lava, in the heat shield
    The river of lava is flowing through the cave swiftly to the south.
 To the west is a shore that appears to open into a cave.  The cave has
 many stalagmites sticking up from its floor; one particularly large
 stalagmite right on the shore -- only about ten feet away from you --
 is at least three feet tall.
    There's a faint light downstream, and you hear a loud rushing noise
 from the south.

 the rope falls short.  You obviously could use some practice.

 Top of Lavafall, in the heat shield

 Before you can do anything, the river carries you over the edge of the

 catching a glimpse of the bottom of the lavafall lost in the rocks far
 below.  Suddenly, you hit something, and your fall stops abruptly.

 Ledge near Lavafall

 You try to maintain your footing, but the rock crumbles under you, and
 you go sliding down the mountainside.  You finally stop falling, and
 you find yourself on a rocky hillside you've seen before.

 Rocky Hillside
    You're on a gently sloping, rocky hillside at the base of a tall
 mountain.  The granite surface of the hillside hosts no vegetation.
 Looming high above to the east is the steep cone of a volcano; clouds
 of dark smoke rise steadily above the cone.  You can climb into the
 mountains to the east, and you can also go north, back to the road.

 You clumsily throw the rope at the rabbit, and miss by a mile.  You
 obviously need some practice at this.

 Lava Cave

>put shield in river
 You put the heat shield in the lava -- it floats on the flowing lava,
 and seems easily able to withstand the heat.  You hold onto it so it
 doesn't float away.

 You're carried rapidly to the south by the flowing lava.

 River of Lava, in the heat shield
    The river of lava is flowing through the cave swiftly to the south.
 To the west is a shore that appears to open into a cave.  The cave has
 many stalagmites sticking up from its floor; one particularly large
 stalagmite right on the shore -- only about ten feet away from you --
 is at least three feet tall.
    There's a faint light downstream, and you hear a loud rushing noise
 from the south.

>lasso stalagmite
 (with the rope)
 Your throw the rope at the stalagmite with a practiced aim.  The loop
 at the end of the rope hooks around the stalagmite.  You easily pull
 yourself to shore, get out of the heat shield, and untie the rope.

 Top of Lavafall
    The cave abruptly opens into the night sky, and you realize that
 you're at the top of a cliff.  The lava is pouring over the edge of the
 cliff and falling hundreds of feet down the side of the mountain below.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Before you can do anything, the river carries you over the edge of the
 lavafall.  You fall and fall, tumbling and flailing your arms and legs,
 catching a glimpse of the bottom of the lavafall lost in the rocks far
 below.  Suddenly, you hit something, and your fall stops abruptly.

 Ledge near Lavafall
    You're on a ledge just west of, and halfway up, a huge lavafall.
 The lava pours down with a deafening rumbling sound.  The narrow ledge

 loaded word that we don't like to use it.  Most ideas people have about
 hell are very outdated.  Ever since the deregulation of the afterlife
 industry, we've had to compete with Heaven for eternal souls -- because
 you're free to switch to Heaven at any time.  So, we've been

 Top of Crater

>verbose
 Okay, now in VERBOSE mode.
 Top of Crater
    You're standing at the top of an enormous crater, which is at least
 several hundred feet in diameter and almost as deep.  Strangely, the
 ground around the crater is not lifted as you would expect of an impact
 crater; it is more like the result of excavation.  The sides of the
 crater are very steep, but it looks as though you could climb down with
 some effort.  The depths of the crater are obscured by a dense fog, but
 a wavering red glow penetrates the fog from below. Overpowering
 sulfurous fumes fill the air, and waves of heat and steam rise from
 below.

>go down
 Bottom of Crater
    You're at the bottom of the crater.  The floor of the crater is
 littered with huge, sharp rocks, making travel very difficult, and the
 ground is so hot that it glows red.  It looks as though you could climb
 back up the crater wall. To the northeast is a narrow passage leading
 into an underground cave.

    A stream of molten lava abruptly starts pouring out of the side of
 the crater.  The glowing stream of liquid rock slowly cools into yet
 more hot rocks at the floor of the crater.

>examine lava
 I don't see any lava here.

>go northeast
 Ledge
    You're on a ledge fifty feet above the floor of a huge cave.  The
 cave below is engulfed in flames.  Fire shoots out of vents in the
 rock; pools of oil on the ground burn slowly, releasing thick black
 clouds of smoke; even some of the rocks themselves smolder and burn.
 Across the cave on the north side, you can see a wide, dark lake; some
 distance into the lake is a small island.  You can probably climb down
 the gently sloping walls of the cave to the floor below, and a narrow
 passage leads outside to the crater to the southwest.

>examine lake
 I don't see any lake here.

>go down
 Floor of Fire Cave
    You're on the floor of the huge cave of fire.  It's extremely
 difficult to see where you're going due to all of the fire and smoke.
 High above on the cave wall, you can see a ledge; you think you'll be
 able to climb back up the wall.  The only path you can see through the
 cave is to the north.

>go north
 You slowly make your way through the dense flames.  You realize that
 this cave must be totally devoid of oxygen -- certainly it's all being
 consumed by the raging fires.  It's lucky you're already dead, you
 think to yourself.

 Rocky Shore
    You're at the north end of the fire cave, standing on the rocky
 shore of a huge, still lake.  The water is black -- so black that it
 barely reflects the brilliant light of the fires.  In the middle of the
 lake, you can see a small island.  The fire cave lies to the south, and
 you could wade into the water to the north.

 you double over with painful stomach cramps and nausea, and you are
 unable to get any further.

 You have a printed note, a dead light bulb, a toolbox, a portable
 radio, a bucket, a pitchfork, a small metal key, a parachute (being
 worn), a pair of rubber gloves, a certificate, a poker, a brush, a
 shovel, a pencil sharpener, a pencil, an Infern-O-Vac battery, a dollar

 into an underground cave.

    A thick cloud of dust drifts down from the side of the crater.  You
 watch the cloud as it slowly meanders through the complex air currents
 driven by the hot crater floor.  As the cloud approaches the hot rocks
 at the bottom of the crater, it suddenly catches fire; you leap back as
 the cloud almost instantly vanishes in a searing wall of flame.

 You can't go that way.

    One of the large rocks on the pit floor suddenly bursts into flames.
 You jump back and shield your eyes from the blinding fire.  After a few
 moments, the fire subsides, and all that's left of the rock is a thick
 black cloud of sulfurous fumes that slowly dissipates.

 You can't go that way.

    You hear a rumbling sound under your feet.  The rumbling increases
 in intensity until the sound is deafening, and the ground is shaking
 violently.  As you try to maintain your balance, several rocks are
 suddenly blown upward as a huge steam geyser blasts through the
 surface.  You jump backward away from the jet of pressurized steam.
 Eventually, the geyser weakens, and finally stops.

 You can't go that way.

    You hear a noise overhead, and look up to see a number of rocks come
 sliding down the side of the crater.  You jump out of the way just in
 time.

    You are on a vast, desolate plain.  The ground is hot here; steam
 rises from cracks in the dry soil, and the warm, damp air smells
 strongly of sulfur.  The area is littered with debris:  decaying bones
 of strange animals, broken parts from ancient machinery, pools of tar
 and oil.  The plain continues off in all directions; it was somewhat
 more pleasant to the south.  A bright red glow comes from the north.

 Desolate Plain
    You're on the east edge of a desolate plain.  The ground is
 hard-packed sand covered with small, sharp rocks.  The plain extends to
 the west as far as the eye can see.  You notice that you can see for a
 very long distance; the ground does not seem to have any curvature at
 all, and there is no distinct horizon.  Only sheer distance seems to
 obscure your view of what may be an infinite plain.
    You can see a red glow to the north, and the city lies back to the
 east.  The plain stretches off without any distinguishing features in
 all other directions.
