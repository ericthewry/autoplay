 You wish you were doing almost anything else than having dinner with
 this bloviating douchebag.  Still, it's a potential client.  Maybe you
 should hear what he has to say. . .

 <span class="floydstyle header">The Vanishing Conjurer</span>
 An IntroComp 2013 Entry by Marshal Tenner Winter
 Release 1 / Serial number 130709 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese Pub</span>
 This is an ancient pub built just after the Great London Fire of 1666.
 The place is gloomy with shadows but the patrons are warmed by a large
 hearth in the center of the room.  Labyrinthine passages to rooms
 exist in all directions except to the east where the exit lies.  You
 can see Howard Horne waving for you to join him at an old table near
 the hearth.  He pulls out an even older chair for you.

 (on the old chair)
 You get onto the old chair.


 You aren't talking to anyone right now.

>about

 <span class="floydstyle em">The Vanishing Conjurer</span> is loosely adapted from a scenario by
 Mike Lewis and Simon Price for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu RPG.  This
 game was playtested by Syman Weed, Geoff "mostly useless" Moore, Matt
 Major, Andrew Schultz, and Francesco "explorington" Tortorici.

>examine me

 You are a private eye; a gumshoe, as they say, and you appear as such.


 You are carrying:
   a fedora (being worn)
   a set of ordinary clothes (being worn)
   a trenchcoat (being worn and open)
     a cigar lighter
     a lock pick
   a holster (being worn)
     a revolver

>examine howard

 He is a thin, nervy sort of chap, with a narrow face and eyes that
 appear positively shifty.


 You don't need to do that.

>howard, hi

 You say hello to Howard Horne.

 (You could ask him about the case.)

>ask howard about case

 "So, what's the skinny?" you ask.

 "I need some help, detective." Howard replies.
 "I need some help, detective." Howard replies."Start from the
 beginning." you invite.

 "Well, I started working the West Side about twenty years ago when
 things were Vaudeville, of course-" he begins.
 things were Vaudeville, of course-" he begins."Better yet, start from
 sometime more recent." you say, rubbing your temples.

 "Oh, yes, of course.  Well, by now, I've got a lot of great acts on me
 books, if I do say so meself.  But my problem is with one of them; a
 young man named Philip Leclair." he tells you.


 "Tell me about Leclair." you say.

 "He calls 'imself <span class="floydstyle em">Leclair the Great</span> professionally." Howard
 tells you, "He'll go far if handled right and he's got a knack for
 making old tricks look new.  He even invents his own, good ones at
 that, with all this new apparatus and patter and everything."
 that, with all this new apparatus and patter and everything.""And?"
 you ask.

 "Well," he says, "end of last month, Philip came to my office,
 plum-excited he was.  Said he had plans for a new trick.  Showed me
 some sketches that I couldn't make heads nor tails of.  He said it was
 going to bring a whole new meaning to what we call <span class="floydstyle em">The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Vanish</span>."
 Vanish.""Wow." you say nonplussed.

 He continues, "You know, making a chap disappear into thin air?"

 Perturbed, you reply, "Yeah, I got it."
 Perturbed, you reply, "Yeah, I got it."He proceeds again, "So he comes
 to my office saying he's having problems with his new apparatus for
 this trick.  Well, I'm no magician so I suggested he approach this new
 magic club who call themselves something like the <span class="floydstyle em">Inner</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Brotherhood of Magicians</span>.  This brotherhood had sent me a letter
 to recommend themselves to my clients.  So I reckon maybe they can
 help Philip with his predicament.  Being a good lad, he did so, and
 was even invited to eventually join the club.  I was hearing that
 things were going swimmingly with his new vanishing trick.  But then
 something happened."
 something happened."You make a twirling motion with your finger,
 inviting him to go on with his story.  He says, "Well, a couple weeks
 ago, Philip comes back to my office, right excited again, he was.  He
 said he was on the verge of finding a method of, as he put it,
 revolutionizing stage magic as we know it."

 "And?" you ask.  He says, "And here's the mystery, detective.  It's
 quite ironic, really.  But that was the last I saw of the lad.  Philip
 Leclair has vanished off the face of the earth!"


 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.


 What do you want to examine?

>topics

 You could ask him about the vanish.

>ask howard about brotherhood

 There is no reply.

>ask howard about the vanish

 "Tell me more about this vanishing act of his." you ask.

 "It's funny you should ask, detective." Howard replies, "I mean, even
 though the Vanish is a standard trick, the particular variation and
 appartus that Philip was using was seen being used by another
 magician.  I know because I'm the one who saw it.  The magician is The
 Amazing Karl.  I don't know much more about him besides that I watched
 him perform it during his nightly act at The Chancellor Theater."

 Howard Horne stands to leave.  "Please let me know if you find out
 anything, detective.  If you'll excuse me, I have a prior late-night
 engagement.  Good luck.  Cheers!"  And with that, Howard Horne leaves
 the pub.


 You can't see any such thing.


 <span class="floydstyle i">Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese Pub</span> (on the old chair)
 This is an ancient pub built just after the Great London Fire of 1666.
 The place is gloomy with shadows but the patrons are warmed by a large
 hearth in the center of the room.  Labyrinthine passages to rooms

 A blazing fire is warming the pub from within the hearth.


 You get off the old chair.

 The place is gloomy with shadows but the patrons are warmed by a large
 hearth in the center of the room.  Labyrinthine passages to rooms
 exist in all directions except to the east where the exit lies.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rowfant Road</span>
 You walk the fog-shrouded streets to the area of town where Philip's
 flat is.  The smell of Polish home-cooking can be smelled in this part
 of south London.  You are standing on the sidewalk near some stairs
 that hug the side of a building to reach a door on the second story.
 The bottom floor is yet another pub; The Devonshire.  The door can be
 reached to the north.  The address for Philip Leclair that Howard
 Horne supplied says that this is the place.


 You can't see any such thing.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rickety Landing</span>
 This is a rickety landing one floor off the ground above an alley.
 The steps lead down to the street where The Devonshire Pub can be
 reached.  To the east is the door into Philip Leclair's flat.


 (first opening the apartment door)
 It seems to be locked.


 You are carrying:
   a fedora (being worn)
   a set of ordinary clothes (being worn)
   a trenchcoat (being worn and open)
     a cigar lighter
     a lock pick
   a holster (being worn)
     a revolver

>examine door

 It is a small, thick door for Philip Leclair's apartment.

>open door

 It seems to be locked.

>knock on door

 You knock and wait, but no one answers.

>kick door

 You can only do that to something animate.

>unlock door with lockpick

 (first taking the lock pick)
 <span class="floydstyle em">(To pick a lock with the lock pick, type "unlock {thing} with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">pick")</span>
 You unlock the apartment door.


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go east

 (first opening the apartment door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Philip's Flat</span>
 This is a humble and tidy apartment.  The room you are in serves as
 the living room, bedroom, and kitchen all at once.  A bed seems to be
 the only real piece of furniture in the place.  The bathroom is to the
 east and the exit to the landing is west.

 You can see a black trunk (closed) here.

>examine bed

 It is a simple, twin-sized bed.  But it's probably European twin-sized
 so who knows how the hell big it really is.

>examine trunk

 It's the kind a circus performer would lug around, but looks like
 Philip has kept it clear of any gaudy stickers that you've seen on
 such circus trunks.

>look under bed
>look under bed

 Just dust.


 Just dust.

>open trunk

 It seems to be locked.

>unlock it with lockpick

 You unlock the black trunk.

>open trunk

 You open the black trunk, revealing a black cane, an instruction
 manual, a deck of cards, a top hat and a set of stage clothes.


 That's unlocked at the moment.


 <span class="floydstyle em">101 Magic Tricks</span>

 You read the first chapter in full, out of curiosity.  Now, you are
 able to <span class="floydstyle em">perform card trick</span> but you'll need a deck of cards,
 of course.

 You take the deck of cards from the black trunk.

>search bed

 There is nothing on Philip's bed.


 It's the kind a circus performer would lug around, but looks like

 First up will be to follow the Amazing Karl and find out what he's all
 about.
>lock door
>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden Gate</span>
 It is the next evening and you've followed The Amazing Karl here.  You
 waited at The Chancellor Theatre for him to finish his act and then
 you shadowed him through the dim streets of London to this large,
 Victorian house in a posh neighborhood.  You stand outside the garden.
 A gate leads into the garden to the east.  The sidewalk continues both
 north and south.  You can see the garden, and indeed the entire house,
 is surrounded by a large hedge.  The smell of flowers fills your nose
 in the still night air.

>smell

 It smells like flowers.

>examine hedge

 It is a tall, dense hedge.

>go north

 You don't need to head down that way.  You followed your quarry to
 this house.  He went through the garden to the front door.

>examine window

 You can't see any such thing.

>go east

 (first opening the garden gate)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fastidious Garden (near the gate)</span>
 This is a perfectly trim and tidy English garden before a large
 Victorian style house.  The shrubs are geometrically sculpted and a
 white pebble path leads from the garden gate to the west, through the
 garden, and to the front door to the east.  Because of the shape of
 the house, the main house is to the north while the front door is on a
 wing of the house to the east.  One of the windows of the house is to
 the north.


 They are immaculately cared for and trimmed into cones, spheres, and
 other geometric shapes.

>examine front door

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine path

 It is a crunchy path of small white pebbles.

>dig in path

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine pebbles

 It is a crunchy path of small white pebbles.

>take pebbles

 You don't need to carry around any pebbles right now.


 It is a wide enough window but, for safety reasons perhaps, it doesn't
 have any lock or visible means of opening.  A warm light comes from
 behind a gauzy curtain.  It may be worth trying to look through.

>look through window

 You <span class="floydstyle em">think</span> you can see one figure in the room.  The figure
 seems to be fussing with something at a small table.  Because of the
 gauzy curtain, you cannot make out any details.  Perhaps you can
 listen to the window to learn more.


 You hear a muffled voice say "Damn rabbit!"

>again

 You hear a muffled voice say "Get in the damn hat!"

>again

 You hear a muffled voice say "Fuck!"


 You hear a muffled voice say "Shit!"

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fastidious Garden (near the front door)</span>
 You are deeper in a trim and tidy English garden before a large
 Victorian style house.  The shrubs are geometrically sculpted and a
 white pebble path leads from the garden gate to the west, through the
 garden, and to the front door to the east.  Because of the shape of
 the house, the main house is to the north while the front door is on a
 wing of the house to the east.  One of the windows of the house is to
 the north.  Next to the front door is a plaque.


 <span class="floydstyle em">The Inner Brotherhood of Magicians - Cheng Ling Shu -</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Proprietor</span>


 It appears very sturdy.


 There are many locks that your old lock pick does not open.  This is
 one of them.  Oh well.


 What do you want to knock on?


 You rap on the door and it is almost immediately answered by an Asian
 servant in Oriental attire.  He looks at you with polite eyes.
 The servant examines you and seems to take notice of your stage
 clothes.  "Please, come in, sir."  He steps in, opening the door for
 you to follow suit.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 This is a carpeted foyer.  The walls bear portraits of famous stage
 magicians of the past and present.  A small desk holds a visitors'
 book and doors lead in each of the cardinal directions.  The front
 door of the home is to the west.

 Standing sentry by the visitors' book and watching over the four doors
 in this room is the servant, Zhang Wei.

 Zhang straightens one of the portraits.


 Wei has a kind face and friendly eyes, but you still don't want to
 trust him as it could all be an act.  He wears the Oriental attire of
 a servant, but a servant to a wealthy family or individual.

>examine visitor book

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine visitors' book

 <span class="floydstyle em">101 Magic Tricks</span>

 The rest of the tricks in the book seem to require too much study and
 prep time to learn quick enough for this adventure.

>examine visitors book

 It is a ledger full of signatures of people who have visited the
 establishment.  It's much like you'd find in a funeral home.  You'd
 have to search it to see if it holds any useful clues.

 Zhang examines the visitors book.


 You randomly look at the portraits on the walls.  One that you take
 notice of is the recently deceased Harry Houdini, of course.

>again

 You randomly look at the portraits on the walls.  One that you take
 notice of is Percy Selbit, the first man to saw a woman in half.
 Well, as an illusion on a stage, that is.

 Zhang straightens one of the portraits.

>wei, hi

 You say hello to Zhang Wei.

 Zhang eyes you curiously.

 (You could ask him about himself, Philip Leclair, Karl Weiss or Cheng
 Ling Shu.)

>ask wei about himself

 "Tell me about yourself." you ask the servant.

 "I am just a servant of Master Cheng Ling Shu, sir." is his reply.

 Zhang looks at one of the portraits while he waits.

>look up philip leclair in visitors book

 You discover nothing of interest in the visitors book.

 Zhang eyes you curiously.

>search visitors book

 You peer at the pages; your eyes scanning the names.  Zhang Wei makes
 a motion to take the book from your prying eyes but you slap his hand
 away long enough to make out the last signature: <span class="floydstyle em">Karl Weiss</span>.


 "What can you tell me about the missing member of the Brotherhood;
 this Leclair fellow?" you ask.

 "Unfortunately," he says, "I did not know the young man."

>ask wei about cheng

 "Tell me about your boss." you ask.

 "Cheng Ling Shu is a great and wise man." Zhang Wei says.


 "What do you know about the man who just came in?" you demand of the
 servant.

 "I'm sorry, sir." he says, "I do not know the members of the
 Brotherhood personally."

 Zhang looks at one of the portraits while he waits.

 a motion to take the book from your prying eyes but you slap his hand

 <span class="floydstyle em">Mohammed</span>.

>go south

 (first opening the reception door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reception Room</span>
 This room is used for guests of the members of the Brotherhood, and as
 a waiting area for visitors.  It is plushly furnished with a large
 sofa and an armchair.  A number of classical Chinese vases and
 decorations stand around the room and an end table sits near the sofa.
 The only exit is the door to the north.


 It is a plush, extra long sofa.

 It's not long at all before an impeccably dressed Asian gentleman
 enters the room.  "Hello." he says with a thick accent.  "I am Li
 Qiang, servant of Cheng Ling Shu.  I understand you wish to join The
 Inner Brotherhood of Magicians?"
 Inner Brotherhood of Magicians?"


 "Hm?" you ask, but then you say, "Oh yeah.  Because I'm a magician."

 "Very well," Li Qiang says, "Please perform a trick for me.  A simple
 one is fine as we do accept amateurs into the Brotherhood with hopes
 that our guidance will only increase their curiosity and craft." he
 looks at you expectantly.


 You perform the simple trick but it seems impressive enough for Li
 Qiang to smile.

 "You are welcome into the Brotherhood as a first level member.  With
 this privilege, you may use the library and practice rooms on the
 first floor to perfect your craft.  Unfortunately, the second floor is
 off limits to you for now.  Let me know if you have any questions."
 But before you can ask any questions, he quickly leaves the room.

>examine vase

 You can tell the vases are quality pieces from ancient dynasties.

>examine decorations

 The decorations are sparse and tasteful.  You spot nothing of real
 interest, however.

>examine armchair

 It is a comfortable appearing Chippendale armchair.

>examine end table

 It is an elegant end table of Asian sensibilities.

 gives long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there
 before).

 (first opening the kitchen door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This is a large kitchen with wide windows on the east and north walls.
 Doors lead west and south.  Counters hold various kitchen appliances,
 and of course there's a sink a large, oak icebox, and a modern Garland
 stove.

 On the Garland stove is a wok.

 You can also see Li Qiang here.

 Li Qiang tugs at his cuffs.

 You don't need to do that.

>examine icebox

 It's also known as a <span class="floydstyle em">refridgerator</span>, but you don't think that

 It's like a wide, very deep pan.  You think it's neat.

 Li Qiang inspects the kitchen.

>ask li about himself

 "So, you must be the <span class="floydstyle em">major domo</span> of the house, huh?" you ask.

 Li Qiang smiles politely, "Yes, that is a description that works.  I
 oversee the house and the servants.  I also greet the visitors and can
 authorize first level membership."

 Li Qiang watches you carefully.

>ask li about zhang wei

 There is no reply.

>ask li about cheng

 "Can you tell me about your boss?" you ask.

 "Cheng Ling Shu is a world-traveler who settled here in London to
 share his craft with budding magicians." Li Qiang happily tells you.
 "He established this Brotherhood to share his experience and wisdom."

 Li Qiang inspects the kitchen.

>ask li about karl

 "Tell me about Karl Weiss." you say.

 "Mr. Weiss is a second level member of the Brotherhood.  I do not know
 more as I do not know the man personally." is Li Qiang's reply.

 Li Qiang watches you carefully.

>ask li about philip

 "Can you tell me anything about the missing member, Philip Leclair?"
 you ask.

 Li Qiang's smile falters as he answers, "A most unfortunate
 circumstance, to be sure.  But, alas, we have no answers on the poor
 young man's disappearance."

 Li Qiang gives a small cough.

 "What's your story?" you ask.

 "What about this Cheng Ling Shu fellow?" you ask.

 "Well," Virgil answers, "He's an extraordinary magician.  Some of his
 tricks are just plain impossible.  Some say he is the simple man he
 conveys himself to be, but others think these Orientals are all up to
 something more sinister, but that might just be English hubris
 talking."

 Virgil turns the page of the newspaper he's reading.

>ask virgil about karl

 "What can you tell me about Karl Weiss?" you ask.

 Conspiratorily, Virgil whispers to you, "He's a thief, and a lousy one
 at that.  He steals others' tricks.  I wouldn't trust him with
 anything.  At the upcoming charity show, I'm sure the trick he is
 planning on performing is someone else's.  There's a locked room at
 the top of the stairs that I think is proof of that."

 Virgil gives a small cough.

>ask virgil about philip

 "You know anything about the missing magician, Leclair?" you ask
 Virgil.  He smokes his pipe thoughtfully before answering.

 "I know of him but we've not met yet.  I hope to still get the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Practice Room</span>
 This is a practice room set aside for the practice of slightly larger
 illusions; those involving larger props.  A large window is in the
 south wall and the only exit is a door to the east.

 There is a large, rectangular box off to the side.  It looks like it
 can be separated in two parts.  It's some sort of stage prop.

 Wearing a top hat and standing behind a magician's table is Danny
 "Mister Magic" Paul.  He seems to be practicing the rabbit trick as
 there is a cloth bag with something in it hanging on his side of the
 table.

 Danny makes a motion as if to show a non-existant audience that his
 top hat is empty.

>look through window

 You can see part of the house's fastidious garden out the window.

 After delivering a few words of patter, Danny attempts to turn his top
 hat upright and secretly slip the rabbit into it.

>danny, hello

 You say hello to Danny Paul.

 As Danny attempts to secretly slip the rabbit into the hat, it bites
 him on the hand.  He cries out but tries to continue.

 (You could ask him about himself, Karl Weiss, Philip Leclair or Cheng
 Ling Shu.)

>examine rabbit

 It is your typical, white hare.

 Just as Danny is about to cover the hat with the cloth, the rabbit
 hops out of the bag.  Danny tries to conceal the bag behind the silk
 cloth while he picks up the rabbit and forces it back into the hat.

>ask danny about rabbit

 There is no reply.

 Danny almost manages to complete his rabbit trick, but as he
 triumphantly holds the rabbit up from the ears, it slips from his
 sweaty palm and lands with a furry thud on the magician's table.
 Danny scoops the rabbit back in the bag.

>ask danny about cheng

 "What can you tell me about this Cheng Ling Shu cat?" you ask.

 "Well, from what I understand, he came from Asia and started this
 Brotherhood.  Lots of rumors surround him, so I don't really get
 involved with it." he tells you.

 Danny continues to fumble with his rabbit and top hat, trying to
 perfect his routine.

>ask danny about karl

 "What can you tell me about Karl Weiss?" you ask.

 "What can I say?" he says, still practicing his rabbit trick, "He's a
 thief.  He steals other magicians' acts.  Total twat, really."

 Danny continues to fumble with his rabbit and top hat, trying to
 perfect his routine.

>ask danny about philip

 "Did you know Philip Leclair?" you ask.

 "You ask that like you know he's dead." he says, still working to
 perfect his rabbit trick.

 "Well," you tell him, "in my experience, the missing usually turn up
 dead."

 Danny Paul eyes you for a moment.  "Have you ever considered that this
 is all part of an elaborate magic trick?" and with a wink, he returns
 to his practice.

 Danny continues to fumble with his rabbit and top hat, trying to
 perfect his routine.

>examine top hat

     a revolver

>open document case

 You open the document case, revealing Philip's plans.

>read plans

 These papers are in Leclair's hand. They detail his new vanishing
 trick, with copies of his diagrams.  They also contain some scribbled
 notes in which Leclair describes a "strange new concept" in magic, and
 mentions "a discussion I had on the matter with my friend Weiss".

 Among the other diagrams and notes there is a rough sketch of the
 trick Weiss will perform at the charity show in a few days time.
 These papers should be enough to convince the police to arrest Weiss
 as an accessory to Leclair's kidnapping, if that is indeed what has
 happened.

 You hear a voice behind you and you spin to see Karl Weiss.
 "<span class="floydstyle em">Vaht</span> are you doing to mein locker?" he demands in a heavy
 German accent.  You ignore his overtudes, saying "You're going down,
 Fruit-Pie the Magician."

 Weiss sees that you are holding Philip's plans and he makes a grab for
 them.  You find yourself grappling with the magician over the
 evidence.

>take revolver

 That's tough to do as you are busy grappling with Weiss over Philip's
 plans.  "Let go, you retarded fairy!" you say through gritted teeth.
 There's got to be something you can do that doesn't involve your arms,
 you think to yourself.

>kick karl

 Finally, you are able to bring your knee up and into Karl's "family
 jewels".  With the pain and a small girlish shriek, he finally
 releases the plans.  You straighten yourself up and say, "See you in
 court, or whatever passes for court in this fuckin' country,
 numbnuts." and you make a move to leave the room but Karl stops you.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">Vait!</span>" he says, "I may have stolen Philip Leclair's diagrams
 and plans but I had nothing to do <span class="floydstyle em">vith</span> his disappearance!"

 "Spill it, tinkletits." you demand.  Karl stands up but moves away
 from you as he speaks.  "Philip and I would talk and assist each other
 <span class="floydstyle em">veeth</span> our illusions.  Before he disappeared, he came to me
 showing me a book he had found and he said with <span class="floydstyle em">zat</span> book, he

 second level members only.  The door is to the west.

 A lovely, red velvet Victorian fainting couch is set in the center of
 the room for one's comfort.

 couch.  It is covered in red velvet.

 The walls of this room are completely covered by curtains, blocking
 out any natural light.  It is a small, suffocatingly stuffy room.
 Several Chinese lanterns hang from the ceiling but they give off no
 light.  The floor is carpeted with a thick rug embroidered with the
 Chinese dragon motif which appears throughout the house.  The motif is
 repeated on the ceiling and on the Chinese lanterns.  There is a small
 cupboard to one side of the room.

 Dominating the far side of the room is a large stone altar which bears
 the Chinese dragon motif.  The curtain behind this altar bears an
 elaborate embroidered image of an emaciated man being drained of blood
 by a creature or creatures unseen.

>examine lanterns

 You begin to examine the Chinese lanterns when, from behind the
 curtains, a number of Asian men rush you and place a hood over your
 head.  You feel them binding your hands.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Locked Room</span>
 This is a large room that maybe was originally meant to be a master
 bedroom for this home, but now it is being used for storage.

 In the center of the room is a large crate.  It is about as high as
 the ceiling and wider than you can stretch your arms.

 Leaning against the large crate is a crowbar.

 There is some sort of dark burn on the ceiling.

 You pick up the crowbar from the ground.

>pry crate with crowbar

 With the crowbar, you use all your strength to noisily pry open the
 large crate, revealing three large stone slabs.

>examine slabs

 There are three large pieces and, using your superior deducing skills,
 you figure they can be assembled into a sort-of arch configuration.
 There are strange glyphs carved into the slabs.  The whole thing makes
 you uneasy.

 That's not something you can enter.

 That's hardly portable.
