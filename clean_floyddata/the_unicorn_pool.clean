 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 It is late afternoon, and the previously busy market place now has
 only a few stragglers trying to find last-minute bargains.
  Your stall is now devoid of all the home-grown delights that were
 piled on the table, and you are preparing to pack things away and
 return to your house.
 It seems that Giles, next stall along, (for whom you have a secret
 fondness,) has also had a good day.  He stands, with the last
 remaining apple tree sapling that he has left for sale.
  You look shyly towards him, but all his attention is taken up gazing
 at Grace, the beautiful daughter of the local squire who approaches
 Giles' stall.

 Hardly sparing a glance at the tree she throws some money at Giles'
 feet and instructs him to deliver it immediately to the Hall.
  She sweeps away with a wiggle and a show of shapely leg below her
 silk gown, and Giles trots along obediently behind her like a faithful
 dog.

 The Market Square
 The market place has stalls arranged around its perimeter.
 The north side of the square is bordered by the entrance gate and
 boundary wall of the Hall, the squire's residence.
 Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail
 leads to the west.
 The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is
 far too distant to walk to.

 It's the end of the day and there is little left to buy, and few
 people still browsing.

>examine me
 You are a hard-working girl, with mousey hair, a weathered face and
 labour-toughened hands.  As someone once said of you - Marty's beauty
 is well-concealed.
 Like most of the villagers, your clothes are home made from coarse
 fabric.  It may not be too comfortable, but it's what you are
 accustomed to.  And there's no point in wishing to dress like those
 rich folks at the Hall - those silks and satins wouldn't last five
 minutes  on the farm.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine stall
 Wooden boards, resting on trestles, providing a trading area for the
 market.

> look under stall
 You don't need to worry about the market stalls.

>examine market
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gate
 Two wrought iron entrance gates, locked with an iron bar, and
 surmounted by iron spikes are set in a six foot high brick wall topped
 with broken glass which makes an impregnable barrier to the casual
 visitor.
  You can see the driveway curving off toward the house to the east.

>go east

 Bluebell Lane
 The pretty grassy track is bordered by thick hedges with many wild
 flowers growing in the verges.
 It is only a couple of hundred yards long, connecting your cottage,
 hidden behind high hedges at the east end, to the market square
 westwards.

>search hedges
 You don't need to worry about the hedge.

>get flowers
 They look much better in their natural setting, and will last far
 longer than in a vase.

>smell flowers
 Aah!  Delightful.  One of life's simple pleasures.

>examine cottage
 You can't see any such thing.


 End Of Lane
 The end of the lane to your cottage, which is immediately to the east.
 Another cottage, Orchard Cot, owned by Giles, is up a short track to
 the south.  The market square may be reached down the lane westwards.

>examine cottage
 The thatched roof is supported by thick walls made in the traditional
 manner from cob - straw and mud.

>go east

 Bluebell Cottage
 Your humble home.  There is only this one room on the ground floor and
 a bedroom above to which stairs lead up.
 The front door is to the west and the garden door to the east.
 The only furnishings are extremely basic.

 Entering through the unlocked door, you see the familiar old
 furniture.  It's not much, but it's your home.
  You're tired after your day at the market, but the animals need
 feeding.  You can hear the chickens clucking impatiently out back.

 You can see a table (on which is a book), a cooker and a chair here.

>examine book
  It's about a young girl, a unicorn, and a magic pool.  You've learned
 that unicorns will only appear to the pure.
  There is a picture of a unicorn on the front cover - a magnificent
 beast with a gold mane and golden horn, silver hooves and a snow white
 body.

   Where did the book come from?  Probably given away by the people at
 the Hall when they'd finished with it.

 scratching at the ground.
 Your cottage is to the west and a small shed is to the south.
 The goat's paddock has an entrance to the northwest.
 You can see a billy goat, some chickens and a rooster here.

>examine goat
 Why you bought a billy no-one can explain, but you love the brute, and
 he seems to like you too, especially at feeding time.  He has a pair
 of stubby horns which should not do you too much damage... unless he
 meant to.

 A motley collection of hens, mostly derbyshire redcaps, with one proud
 rooster  who thinks he is in charge.

>put rein on goat
 The salient characteristic of goats is their stubbornness, and Billy
 wants nothing to do with this game.  The only place you can go with
 him is the paddock, so it's hardly worth trying, is it?

>go northwest

 Paddock
 A grassy area for the goat to forage, though he's always in the back
 yard at feeding time.
 It stretches northwest to the boundary of the grounds of the Hall, the
 side wall of which abuts it.
 The open gateway to your yard is at the east side.

 By Hall Side-wall
 The northwest corner of your paddock.  The Hall is just the other side

 can be seen above the parapet except the top of a double paned window
 set back into the house.

>examine window
 Panes of glass to let in daylight.  Not the product of the Microsoft
 corporation.

>look through window
 You don't need to worry about the windows.

>examine balcony
 It's what's known as a belvedere - the balcony doesn't project but is
 flush with the wall.  It only has brickwork eighteen inches high at
 the base, so it'd be easy enough to fall out.

>fire batarang at balcony then scale up like batman

 leads to the west.
 The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is
 far too distant to walk to.


 The square's now almost deserted, the day after the market, and early
 in the morning as it is. Only old Ned and Jake are here now, leaning
 on the wall and discussing life, the universe and current livestock
 prices.  You see Jake chuckling and nudging Ned as he gestures toward
 the Hall.  Giles name is mentioned, and Jake gives you a quizzical
 look.
 You can see Old Ned and Jake here.

 Bog Trail
 The flowery lane soon degenerates into  a dank track through  a series
 of foul-smelling bogs as you move westward.  But it's always been this
 way, and the solitude can sometimes be a comfort.
 You can continue westwards deeper into the swamp, or return to the
 village eastwards.   There are cloven hoof prints leading west.

 You can see a billy goat and a clear pool here.

>put rein on goat


     *** Well, you found your goat, but what about Giles?
  By the time you get home he's gone, and you never see him again.  Has
 he, in shame, gone off down that long southern road and found another
 life?
  Or did he never return from the Hall... and if that's the case, is he
 living the life of Riley, or are the tales of the weird goings-on
 there true?

 Bluebell Lane
 The pretty grassy track is bordered by thick hedges with many wild
 flowers growing in the verges.
 It is only a couple of hundred yards long, connecting your cottage,
 hidden behind high hedges at the east end, to the market square
 westwards.
 There is damage to the northern hedge where something has forced its
 way through, and cloven hoof prints lead west.

>go west

 The Market Square
 The market place has stalls arranged around its perimeter.
 The north side of the square is bordered by the entrance gate and
 boundary wall of the Hall, the squire's residence.
 Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail
 leads to the west.
 The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is
 far too distant to walk to.


 The square's now almost deserted, the day after the market, and early
 in the morning as it is. Only old Ned and Jake are here now, leaning
 on the wall and discussing life, the universe and current livestock
 prices.

 Entrance Hall
 You remember from a visit once as a child, when your mother worked in
 the hall, that the ground floor is mainly the servants quarters and
 kitchen etc, and that the servants kept themselves strictly apart from
 their masters.  And out of sight as much as possible, so wandering
 around this level should be fairly safe, but not likely to be very
 productive... but one never can tell...
 And what's that door to the south?  Ah, you obviously weren't allowed
 in there as a kid.

 A corridor leading to the kitchen is to the east.  An ornate staircase
 winds upwards, blocking off northward access from this point, and a
 fancy doorway is to the south.  The whole place is very gloomy with
 oak-panelled walls and a few portraits of singularly unattractive
 ancestors of the present incumbents.
 You may exit the building westwards.

 There's surprisingly little here in the way of furniture.  The east
 wall has french windows leading to a small balcony or belvedere.  The
 naked form of Giles is strapped to the bed.  He has red welts on his
 back, and signs of bruising.  He is attached by leather thongs  at
 hand and foot to the bed.
 As he hears the door open, Giles groans and you can see him flinch,
 but when he realises it's you he relaxes.
 "Oh Marty, thank heaven.  Please help me..."


 You can see a narrow bed (on which is Giles) and some clothing
 belonging to Giles here.

>cut thong
 You make short work of releasing the bonds, and Giles staggers to his
 feet smiling through his pain.  Then realising his situation, blushes
 and dons his clothing.
 He declares he'll never let you out of his sight again.


>open doors
 You don't need to worry about the french windows.

>undo
 Blue Room
 [Previous turn undone.]

>push bed east
 The bed crashes through the french doors onto the balcony scattering
 glass in all directions.  All that noise must have woken Grace.

 Belvedere
 A sort of recessed balcony accessed through french windows from the
 blue room.  It overlooks  the northwest end of Bluebell Cottage's
 paddock; and indeed is practically on the boundary line, the notorious
 glass-topped wall being visible directly below if you look over the
 eighteen inch high parapet.

 You can see Giles here.

>go down
 Jump from here? You'd break your neck, or cut yourself to ribbons.

>undo
 Belvedere
 [Previous turn undone.]

>push bed east
 There's hardly any room to move it that way.
 You can go only west.

>put lead on bed
 You put the lead rein on the narrow bed.
 It's tricky, but you sling the rein over the parapet and scramble down
 on the far side of the wall.  Giles follows.  It's a good job you both
 wore those heavy work boots to protect your feet from that glass on
 the top of the wall.


 By Hall Side-wall
 The northwest corner of your paddock.  The Hall is just the other side
 of the wall.  A first floor balcony is visible above you, but nothing
 can be seen above the parapet except the top of a double paned window
 set back into the house.
 As you make a run for it across the field, Grace appears on the
 balcony and lets off both barrels of her shotgun.  Luckily she is not
 a good shot.  In frustration she hurls the lead rein after you, which
 you retrieve before she can reload.


 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>so now we can get the goat.
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>se

 Paddock
 A grassy area for the goat to forage, though he's always in the back
 yard at feeding time.
 It stretches northwest to the boundary of the grounds of the Hall, the
 side wall of which abuts it.
 The open gateway to your yard is at the east side.

 You can see Giles here.

>se
 You can go only east or northwest.

>go east

 Back Yard
 The typically untidy yard of a rural dwelling is full of  chickens
 scratching at the ground.
 Your cottage is to the west and a small shed is to the south.
 The goat's paddock has an entrance to the northwest.
 You can see Giles, some chickens and a rooster here.

>go west

 Bluebell Cottage
 Your humble home.  There is only this one room on the ground floor and
 a bedroom above to which stairs lead up.
 The front door is to the west and the garden door to the east.
 The only furnishings are extremely basic.


 You can see Giles, a table and a cooker here.

>go west

 End Of Lane
 The end of the lane to your cottage, which is immediately to the east.
 Another cottage, Orchard Cot, owned by Giles, is up a short track to
 the south.  The market square may be reached down the lane westwards.

 You can see Giles here.

>go west

 Bluebell Lane
 The pretty grassy track is bordered by thick hedges with many wild
 flowers growing in the verges.
 It is only a couple of hundred yards long, connecting your cottage,
 hidden behind high hedges at the east end, to the market square
 westwards.
 There is damage to the northern hedge where something has forced its
 way through, and cloven hoof prints lead west.

 You can see Giles here.

>go west

 The Market Square
 The market place has stalls arranged around its perimeter.
 The north side of the square is bordered by the entrance gate and
 boundary wall of the Hall, the squire's residence.
 Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail
 leads to the west.
 The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is
 far too distant to walk to.
 There's no-one here at all now.  Ned and Jake have gone about their
 business and most of the town has yet to venture abroad.


 You can see Giles here.

>go west

 Bog Trail
 The flowery lane soon degenerates into  a dank track through  a series
 of foul-smelling bogs as you move westward.  But it's always been this
 way, and the solitude can sometimes be a comfort.
 You can continue westwards deeper into the swamp, or return to the
 village eastwards.
 You can see Giles here.

>go west

 Alongside A Clear Pool
 The bogs encroach on this spot from all directions except for the
 narrow track eastwards.
 You can see Giles, a billy goat and a clear pool here.

>SAVE
>cf5
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>kiss giles
 Ooh that was wonderful.

>ask giles about pool
 There is no reply.

>put rein on goat


 As you fit the collar on the goat, who is quietly munching the grass,
 Giles steps towards you.
 He staggers up to you and puts his hands on your shoulders, at which
 moment Billy gives a sidestep into you, you both overbalance and fall
 into the pond.
 You both stand up, laughing, and you look over to the animal, now free
 of your grasp on the rein.  With the sun at just this angle his grey
 coat seems pure white, and his little horns glow gold.
 It's only for an instant but it's enough...
 You look at Giles.  He, too, seems more handsome than ever.  He is
 looking at you in equal wonder... "Marty, you're beautiful!" and he
 kisses you.

 A derisive snort comes from the track, and you see the haughty Grace
 sneering at you both.  "Yes, take that peasant.  She's more your type,
 Giles," she cackles, whereupon Billy charges her and deposits her in
 the foul swamp on the opposite side of the track.

 You both climb out of the pool, and retrieve Billy, and as you walk
 home - each beautiful in each other's eyes,   you know that maybe
 sometimes those fairy tales do come true.

 In future years you often come wandering through the bogs together.
 You've never again found that magic pool, but along with your
 'unicorn' live happily ever after.
