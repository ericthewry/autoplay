                                * * *


 It's been a bad night. I think I finally struggled into sleep at
 something like half-past two, and since then it's been more or less a
 continuous string of nightmares. Time and again I dream of Leo,
 standing at the end of a distant cliff, peering down over the edge. I
 run towards him, shouting at random, trying to warn him---willing to
 say anything, so long as it reaches his ears. But inevitably, just as
 I am near enough for him to hear my voice, a bell sounds from
 somewhere above us, and he doesn't turn. And then suddenly he is gone
 over the cliff's edge, and the entire world is going white, nothing
 remaining but me, the cliff, and the sound of the bell ringing, and
 ringing, and ringing . . .

 Bedroom (on the bed)
 I awake with a start, and after a half-second of pure "Where the hell
 am I," place myself in my bedroom. I've no idea what time it is---at
 least the sun's up---but the pounding in my head suggests that it's
 several hours earlier than anyone with any sense ought to rise. The
 door to the hallway lies to the south, and windows border the other
 three sides of the room.

 The doorbell is ringing downstairs. Bloody hell.

>examine me
 But I can't see you. Do you even have a body? Or were you trying to
 get me to examine myself?

 The doorbell chimes again. I'm torn between ignoring it and going down
 to give whoever it is the what-for.

>examine you
 I'm the same as I've always been. With more age spots and less
 colourful hair than in times past, I suppose. The purple nightgown I'm
 wearing perhaps can't be said to flatter, but in any case I've found
>examine yourself
 people give me more and more leeway with my appearance as the years go
 by.

 The doorbell rings again, several times in succession.

 (myself)
 I'm the same as I've always been. With more age spots and less
 colourful hair than in times past, I suppose. The purple nightgown I'm
 wearing perhaps can't be said to flatter, but in any case I've found
 people give me more and more leeway with my appearance as the years go
 by.

 The doorbell rapidly sounds a dozen times more. I fight a rising
 murderous urge.

>stand
 I get off the bed.

 Bedroom
 Everything is in perfectly in order here---white and austere, as I
 like it. The door to the hallway lies to the south, and windows border
 the other three sides of the room.

 The doorbell falls momentarily silent.

>look through window
 Just woods, plus the oak and the pond.

 Someone has begun pounding on the front door.

>go south
 Stumbling blearily forward, I collide with the closed door.  It just
 isn't shaping up to be my day.

 I open the door, the noises from downstairs seeming to redouble in
 volume.

 The drumming on the door gets louder.

>go south

 Hallway
 It's an unfortunate truth that the most boring spaces in one's home
 tend to be among the most frequently visited, and this discouragingly
 tiny space is no exception. Leo's painting on the west wall is just
 sufficiently distracting so that one might not notice the total lack
 of windows, at least. The stairs down lie to the east, my bedroom is
 north, and the toilet is southwest.

 "Matilda! Are you in there? Please open the door!"

 Dear God---it's Leo.

>examine leo
 I don't see any such thing.

>dance
 Much as I enjoy a good gambol, this is hardly the time. Besides, I
 think dancing is widely held to be disgraceful for those over a
 certain age.

 "Matilda!" The doorbell starts up again.

>xyzzy
 What utter nonsense.

>go east

 Staircase
 This is the landing of the stairwell, which makes a broad 180-degree
 turn between upstairs and downstairs.  A wide shaft of morning
 sunlight streams in through the picture window which makes up most of
 the eastern wall, and the staircases lie to the west.

 The knocking is loud enough now to make me fear for the continued
 integrity of the front door.

>go down
 I make my way down the stairs, carefully stepping over the one that
 creaks.

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
 Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
 paintings, on the west wall. The front door, the source of all the
 cacophony, lies to the southwest, the key in the lock. The stairs up
 to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 A muffled thumping sound comes from behind the door.

 It was a present from Leo a few years ago. He usually paints from
 life---he gets up before dawn every day and paints in all sorts of
 strange places---but I asked him to do one for me from his mind, and
 as far as I know it's the only imaginary landscape he's ever done. It
 depicts a waterfall so wide that it completely fills the sky, as seen
 from a promontory in the foreground that juts out over the water's
 edge.

 The nail that's holding this painting up appears to be coming loose. I
 make a mental note to fix that at some point.

 The doorbell chimes one final time.

>take key
 Taken.

 Silence. The visitor is gone.

>open door
 I open the door and step through.

 On the other side lies Leo, prostrate on the ground. I cry out
 involuntarily, and kneel down to take his pulse. No, not dead, but
 unconscious and still bleeding heavily from a wound in his hip. I rush
 back into the flat to call an ambulance, but somewhere in the back of
 my mind I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt, knowing with strange
 certainty that he will not wake up again.


     *** I will never learn what happened ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT?
>We commited murder by negligence
 Please give one of the answers above.

 to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 Someone has begun pounding on the front door.

>open door
 Taking my key out of the lock, I flip the latch and throw the deadbolt
 back.

 I open the door and step through.

 On the other side is Leo, who nearly faints with relief. "Matilda.
 Thank God you're here."  He moves, almost falls, toward me, almost
 stumbling into my arms.  But he doesn't support his weight, and we end
 up on the floor of the foyer in an awkward embrace. I release him,
 then realise my hands are sticky with something warm and wet.

 "Oh, my God." I find myself saying. "Oh, my God. Oh, my God."

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: All right.

>lick hands
 What? No!

 "Leo, what happened?" I ask.

 "My mother. Shot me," he whispers.

 This is so obscenely unexpected I can't even respond. "Shot you? Leo,
 I don't . . ." But even as I speak my eye lights on the blood soaking
 through his jeans.

>apply pressure
 That isn't a verb I recognise.

>remove jeans
 I don't see any such thing.

>examine leo
 Leo is perhaps a decade younger then me, and at least a foot taller.
 At the moment he appears to be on the point of collapse. His favourite
 affectation, a gold pocketwatch, is hanging from his belt loop.

 "How did this happen, Leo?" I've always imagined myself as the type to
 remain level-headed in situations like this, but my voice is cracking.

 "My fault," he says. "I'd hidden my grandfather's pistol so she
 wouldn't find it, but this morning she did. And then she saw me about
 to go into the painting in the garden . . ."

>ask leo about painting
 "Leo, I don't understand. Into the painting?"

 He grimaces in pain. "It's my fault that I sound delirious, you know.
 I should have told you about the paintings years ago. Now you'll have
 to go it alone." He reaches into his pocket, fishing for something.

>inventory
 It seems that I'm carrying:
   my house key

 "Leo, please.  I don't understand. Irene is your mother. Why would
 she---?"

 But he doesn't seem to hear. "Here. You'll never get into the studio
 without this." He presses something small and metallic into my palm.

>ask leo about studio
 "But I thought you didn't let anyone see your studio."

 He shakes his head. "Doesn't matter now. Listen. You can use the
 paintings. Fix it so that this didn't happen. And you might also need
 the ring. It's upstairs in my room. I know you hate that thing, but
 otherwise you won't be able to move anywhere."

>kiss leo
 This is patently not the time.

 With difficulty, I force myself to think rationally. "All right, Leo.
 Stop talking as if you're going to die. I'm going to call an ambulance
 and they'll get you help."

 "No!" he gasps. He grabs my arm, and even in the state he's in, his
 grip nearly pulls me back to the floor. "You can't tell the police.
 Trust me, for your own sake. Now go!"

>call ambulance
 That isn't a verb I recognise.

>save leo
 I only understood you as far as wanting me to save.

>ask leo about Irene
 "Focus, Leo. Where did Irene go?" I ask.

 He makes a hopeless gesture. "Gone. She'll probably have forgotten the
 whole thing by the time anyone finds her."

>ask about painting
 I can't think of anything that hasn't already been said.

>ask about Irene
 I can't think of anything that hasn't already been said.

>ask about me
 I don't talk about you out in the open like that . . . surely you can
 understand. They'd think me insane.

>ask about ring
 "Oh, no, Leo, not the ring again . . ."

 "It's not what you think, Matilda. It's the setting of the diamond . .
 . on the shelf. You'll see what I mean."

>ask leo about you
 "Dear God, Leo. And to think that I was sleeping that whole time,
 while you were . . ." But I can't finish the thought.

>tell leo about dream
 No words come.

 "Oh, and Matilda."

 "What?" Our faces are very close now.

 "The key to my gallery's outside the studio. If you find it . . . you
 can have it. As a bequest."

 I pull my arm free, revolted. "For God's sake, Leo! Don't talk like
 that. You're scaring me."

 Leo's eyes close. He's fading fast.

>ask leo about gun
 No response. He seems to be unconscious.

>give CPR
 I don't see any such thing.

>examine wound
 I don't see any such thing.

>examine leg
 I don't see any such thing.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Leo is lying on the floor, barely conscious.

>who is leo
 Leo's my next-door neighbour; he moved into the building perhaps a
 dozen years ago. What a frightening thought---I'm pretty sure that
 when we met, I was younger than he is now. Our relationship has been
 everywhere from icy hostility to unabashed longing (on both of our
 parts, at different times, naturally), and every emotion in between.
 It stabilised at "good friends" around the time his mother moved in
 with us, and has remained steadfast since.

>who is leo's mother
 Irene is Leo's mother; she's only been my neighbour for the last three
 or four years, since she ceased to be capable of living on her own.
 It's hard to deny she's rather senile at this point, and perhaps a bit
 paranoid . . . but a murderess? Surely not.

>who are you
 Me? What's to say?

>carry leo
 No response. He seems to be unconscious.

>SAVE

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>inventory
 It seems that I'm carrying:
   an old bronze key
   my house key

>search leo
 That would be a fabulous idea if I were some kind of criminal. Instead
 of, you know, his friend.

>examine watch
 It's an attractive open-faced gold fobwatch, equipped with a long,
 thin loop of chain and a small black button just below six o'clock.
 The clock face suggests that it's twenty-five to eight---how time
 flies and all that.

>go northwest

 Front Room
 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the
 number of times I've been in this room on one hand. It's attractively
 done up, though a bit austere in the furniture department. The walls
 here used to be completely covered in his paintings, but apparently
 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly
 bare.

 The stairs up are to the west, the kitchen north, and a locked door
 which I assume leads to Irene's room northeast. The foyer lies back to
 the southeast.

 There is a dull snapping sound from the southeast.

 An enormous crash from the direction of my living room shakes the
 foundations of the house.

>go northeast

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic. The
 walls are now entirely bare, the waterfall painting scattered over the
 floor as it is. The front door lies to the southwest. The stairs up to
 the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 My waterfall painting lies on the floor, the frame shattered.

 Lying on the floor amongst the fragments is a golden pocketwatch.

>take watch
 Taken.

>sell watch
 That isn't a verb I recognise.

>examine painting
 This was a landscape Leo painted for me, of a cliff with a gigantic
 waterfall completely filling the sky behind it. He usually paints from
 life---he gets up before dawn every day to paint in all kinds of
 strange places---but I asked him to do one for me from his mind, and
 as far as I know it was the only one he's ever done. Now the frame is
 shattered and the canvas torn nearly in half.

 I think there's enough going on at the moment that I can safely say
 the state of the furniture is immaterial.

>knock on irene's door
 I shove my shoulder hard against the door, and a previously unseen
 panel swings open below the doorknob, revealing a small brass keyhole.

 An old-fashioned double-sided bronze key. It's slightly tarnished, but

 Staircase
 This staircase is the mirror of mine except that his picture window
 looks out on the neighbours' rooftops. I can continue up or down.

>go up

 Upstairs
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching rainbows of subtly graduated colour, and the walls are
 covered with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the
 west, the community toilet southeast, and what I presume is Leo's
 bedroom to the north.

>go north
 I open Leo's bedroom door.

 Vacant Room
 The door to this room has always been closed whenever I popped up to
 use his loo, and I've always been curious as to what he was hiding in
 here. It is therefore with great chagrin that I note that the room is
 completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still painted, and the
 windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made use of this room
 at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare except for one of his
 canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of the eastern wall. The
 hallway lies back to the south.

 Oddly, they don't seem designed to be openable. Someone wanted privacy
 in here, evidently.

>examine painting
 An unholy mess of pure colour swirls over the canvas. I'm no artist,
 but somehow Leo's made the brushstrokes seem completely chaotic up
 close, but allowed them to resolve into a unified, swirling mass as I
 step back from the painting. I've never seen this one before, and I
 would never guess it were Leo's if that weren't obviously his
 signature in the corner. I mean, it's lovely, but an abstract seems
 rather out of character for Leo when he's always telling me he only
 paints from life.

 Weirdly out-of-character for Leo, in fact---they're dark velvet.

>examine shelf
 Well, yes, there's a wooden shelf here, along the far wall, but
 honestly, I see nothing important on it.

 It is fixed in place.

>look on shelf
 No, really, I don't see anything I want to take.

>again
 Why do you keep asking me this? I don't want to take anything take
 might be on that shelf.

>again
 Let me put it this way, then: I don't want to touch that thing.

>again
 I nearly scream with frustration. Despite what Leo and Irene say, I
 think some parts of the past are better forgotten.

>again
 I nearly scream with frustration. Despite what Leo and Irene say, I

>take ring
 Damn it. All right, so the ring is on the shelf. But is it really

 years ago; there's really no need to go into all that again.

>again
 Taken, damn you.

>thank you
 Thanking myself would be gratuitous at best.

 The jewel flashes at me.

>thank me
 Thanking you is at the top of my list of thing I will probably never,
 ever do.

>examine ring
 It's an engagement ring: a narrow band of white gold, set with a
 small, glittering diamond.

>examine diamond
 A small, diamond in a round, white setting. The setting seems to be
 slightly loose, as if it were built to rotate on its axis.

 (first taking the setting)
 That seems to be a part of the diamond ring.

 No. What are you, some kind of sadist?

>wear ring
 Please, just stop it. We've gone over and over this.

>wear ring
 All right, all right, I'll wear your goddamned diamond. Please don't
 harass me anymore.

>turn diamond
 Pushing the button produces an irritatingly loud snapping sound, and
 then . . .

 I take a step backward. Except for the abstract painting, everything
 in the room has gone black and white. All is still and completely
 motionless, the distant sounds of traffic have stopped, and the room
 is entirely drained of colour. I fight an unaccustomed urge to panic.

>panic
 That isn't a verb I recognise.

>Drat
 'Fuck' might be more cathartic.

 A noise comes from the mess of colour---utterly incongruous and
 completely unmistakable, a duck quacking.

>touch painting
 My finger glides straight through where the paint ought to be.

 The abstract fills the room with the sound of water, sloshing busily
 about.

>examine watch
 It appears to be stopped at eight o'clock.

 The colours continue to merge and divide in rhythm with the sounds of
 the ocean.

 I walk up, closer to the painting. I feel a light breeze on my face;
 there doesn't seem to be any kind of boundary at all between here and
 there. I put my hand against it, and sure enough, it goes clean
 through.

 I contemplate this for a moment, and, then, at last, get up my courage
 and walk straight into it. There is a flash of pure, blinding white,
 and a noisy snap as the pocketwatch begins ticking again . . .

 Dock's End
 The ocean. The sun is setting, hanging just over the mountains to the
 north. I'm standing on a rickety wooden dock, somewhat discoloured
 with mildew and encrusted with barnacles along the edges. Water
 surrounds me in all directions, but the dock continues to the east.

>examine watch
 It's an attractive open-faced gold fobwatch, equipped with a long,

 as glass, but in the light of the setting sun it seems to gradually
 twist and shift with a hundred different pulsing shades. At first I
 think this must be some kind of monstrous oil slick, or else a trick
 of the light, but on closer inspection is appears to be a property of
 the water itself.

 I shudder. Where is this place?

>touch water
 Completely unyielding, and cold as stone.

>stand on water
 That's not something I can stand on.

>go west
 I touch the water experimentally. It moves slowly in response to my
 touch, like thick syrup, but won't support my weight. No walking on
 water for me, apparently.

 The diamond ring, apparently, has vanished.

 I'm the same as I've always been. With more age spots and less
 colourful hair than in times past, I suppose. The purple nightgown I'm
 wearing perhaps can't be said to flatter, but in any case I've found
 people give me more and more leeway with my appearance as the years go
 by.

>push button
 That absurdly loud snap, and my stomach twists as everything goes

>go east

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 The shore here is little more than an abbreviated stretch of sand,
 with the oncoming darkness and the height of the cliffs opposite
 combine to produce an oddly desolate effect. The tide itself is quite
 high up: water is beginning to engulf the trees, as well as the legs
 of a small easel planted in the sand. I can continue up the beach to
 the north, the dock extends over the water to the west, and to the
 south, situated dangerously close to the water, is a small cabin built
 perpendicular to the beach.

>examine easel
 A somewhat rickety elmwood easel, positioned so as to give the artist
 a good view over the bay. It doesn't seem to have been used for quite
 some time, though---it's soaked through with recent rain, and appears
 to be rotting away in places.

 In fact . . . following the easel's line of sight over the ocean, I
 realise with a shock that the painting I've just come through isn't an
 abstract at all: Leo has simply painted the reflection of the setting
 sun on the bay, exactly as it is---the water in the light is throwing
 up dozens of colours, slowly shifting with the current, flowing out
 with the tide.

>examine mountains
 Extraordinarily steep---far too much so for this to be anywhere close
 to home. Though its difficult to tell at this angle, the peaks appear
 to be heavily forested, receding into the distance farther than my eye
 can follow.

>examine cabin
 This roughshod wooden shack would be rustic and charming, say, in the

 On the Cape (in monochrome)
 The beach swivels out over the water here, creating this little
 headland surrounded by rocky, shallow water on three sides. The beach
 arcs back to the south.

 Sunning herself in a lawn chair nearby, entirely improbably, is Irene,
 Leo's mother. At the moment, she appears to be frozen in place, gazing
 off into the middle distance.

>ask irene about leo
 "Irene . . . what happened to Leo, earlier?"

 A sudden look of pain look crosses her face.

 "Irene. What did you do?"

 She pauses, and when she speaks her voice is a whisper. "He was going
 to break our rule," she says. "I had no other choice. Perhaps you can
 fix it, though, now that you can go back yourself."

>ask her about rule
 (Irene about that)
 "Your rule," I repeat derisively.

 "My father's rule. No duplicating oneself. He was trying to go into a
 painting he'd just finished. I'd just found the pistol---it was in my
 hand---I was furious---I had no other way to stop him before he used
 the pocketwatch."
 Her eyes are unfocused. "I'm not making excuses," she says, "but I'd
 warned him. And, you know, life is a much less fragile thing when you
 can play tricks with time with those paintings---I've thought he was
 dead before, and then he would waltz out of a canvas cheerful as you
 please. I know you'll find a way."

>ask her about the watch
 (Irene about that)
 "I found that pocketwatch of Leo's in my living room. . . that's how I
 was able to get here."

 Her eyes widen. "How on earth did he lose that? Leo will want to . . .
 well, never mind. It won't be much good to you, actually, if you can't
 get into the cabin. You'd need the padlock key."

>ask her about leo
 (Irene about that)
 I think that topic's more or less been exhausted.

>ask her about watch
 (Irene about that)
 I think that topic's more or less been exhausted.

>ask her about ring.
 (Irene about that)
 I doubt Irene would know much about that.

 "So," says Irene. "Things are going well for you?"

 Irene's conversation, I've noticed, tends to be the polar opposite of
 her son's: whereas Leo is so intensely present that I feel slightly on
 edge whenever I speak to him, Irene is so vague that you start to
 wonder whether she's there at all.

>ask her about ring
 (Irene about that)

 "I found a diamond ring upstairs in yours and Leo's flat," I remark.


 "And by your presence here I gather that you took it? Now there's
 fodder for speculation," Irene says. "Does this mean you've accepted
 him at last? Or are you only using his ring for your own ends?" She
 shakes her head. "Not that I'm in a position to judge."
>ask irene about duplication
 I doubt Irene would know much about that.

 "It's lovely here, isn't it?" she remarks.

 "I thought so," I say.

 "Ah. We're agreed, then. Besides," she adds enigmatically, "the music
 is best here."

>ask irene about music
 "Music?" I ask.

 She smiles. "I gather you haven't seen the music box yet, then."

>ask her about time.
 (Irene about that)
 I doubt Irene would know much about that.

 "Yes, indeed . . . yes, indeed," Irene murmurs. Her eyes drift closed.

>ask her about paintings
 (Irene about that)
 "All this is . . . amazing," I say. "Have you and Leo always been able
 to use paintings like this? You were coming to these places all these
 years and never once thought to tell me?"

 "Well, we thought to, of course, many times," she says vaguely. "But I
 think Leo was waiting for the right moment. Besides, not all the
 paintings are really so special." She turns to me suddenly. "Like that
 one that connects to here. The sloppy one, of the ocean. He dashed
 that thing off in about half an hour when he realised we had no easy
 way back to the flat. It's not really such a special thing. More of a
 family trade."

>ask her about padlock
 (Irene about that)
 "Is that your cabin down there on the beach, Irene?" I ask.

 "In a manner of speaking. It's Leo's studio." Then, seeing the look on
 my face, she adds, "Not too impressive, is it? That's Leo's version of
 'authentically naturalist.'"

 There's something resembling bitterness in her voice. "Is that why
 it's padlocked shut, then?"

 "Oh, no," she smiles. "I locked it." She reaches into her collar and
 pulls out something tiny and glittering. I experience an odd sense of
 d?j? vu.

>examine glitter
 Possibly the smallest key I've ever seen. There's no way this would
 fit in any door unless it were something out of Lewis Carroll.

>press button

>take key
 Which do you mean, the tiny copper key, the old bronze key or the
 house key?

>take the tiny copper key
 "Irene, could I have the key to the padlock?"

 She sighs, then leans forward, extending her hand. "I thought to put
 you through a grand song and dance to get it," she says as she hands
 it over, "but I find I don't really have the heart."

>examine irene
 I readily admit that in the age hierarchy, I probably qualify as
 "getting on," perhaps even as "over the hill." Irene, by contrast, is
 fast approaching senile with a side of decrepit. She's currently
 reclining in a lawn chair, one hand clutching her cane.

>examine cane
 A long, elegant bamboo affair with a gold handle. She probably
 oughtn't to be doing much walking---in fact, she has a wheelchair
 lying around somewhere, as I recall, but she rejected it in favor of
 this because the wheelchair motor wouldn't do twenty kilometres an
 hour.

>inventory
 It seems that I'm carrying:
   a tiny copper key
   a pocketwatch
   an old bronze key

>ask irene about my painting
 It's unlikely to be an enlightening conversation with Irene in that
 petrified state.

>go south
 I nod farewell to Irene and set off back down the beach.

 In the Cabin
 After all these years, on finally getting to see Leo's studio, I find
 my only reaction is "No wonder he never let me see this place." Leo's
 studio is an utter shambles. The ceiling is alarmingly low and
 pockmarked with holes, the hammock strung across the rear of the room
 is all tangled up in itself, and the writing-desk beside it is
 completely covered in debris. On the desk is a stack of papers impaled
 on a spindle, and across from it stands a tranquilly ticking
 grandfather clock. The door back outside lies to the north.

>examine clock
 Solid ash. I have no idea how Leo got this in here---it's taller than
 the door---but it does do rather a lot for the room's ambiance. The
 face, for some reason, is at the bottom of the clock, and the exposed
 pendulum swings freely at eye level.

 It does look cosy, if a bit claustrophobic, strung practically from

 It might be cherrywood; it's been covered with dozens of swatches of
 paint of every shade so that it's difficult to imagine what it used to
 look like. Off to one side are a stack of papers piled on a spindle,
 and on the other side sits a large, hinged-lidded wooden box.

>examine papers
 The sheets are covered in Leo's spidery handwriting, and the make of
 paper seems familiar; it looks like they've been torn from the pad
 that I gave Leo for his last birthday, when he was making noises about
 wanting to keep a journal.

 It looks like there are monthly entries, dating from last November up
 until this month.

 (first taking the papers)

 Happy birthday to me. Celebrated by springing for doors with locks for
 every room in the flat---an enormous pain to install, but I console
 myself thinking of how much easier it'll be to go back and forth with
 the master key when I'm working.

 Along with this journal, an amazing new sable paintbrush from Matilda.
 Perhaps Irene told her I was looking for a new one, but I would never
 have thought to get anything of this quality for myself.

>read december

 Finally finished Matilda's "not-from-life" painting, just in time for
 Christmas. Would be sorely tempted to go in if I could think of a way
 to get back once there. Otherwise busy.

>read january

 Should write this down for reference: have been messing about with
 some of the paintings in the gallery. I realise this ought to be
 dangerous, but as far as I can tell, there's no potential for things
 to go really wrong. If I go back and change something, time proceeds
 forward from that moment without regard to how the future was supposed
 to play out. Was looking forward to causing paradoxes galore, but
 apparently not.

 Frankly, would rather be painting than dabbling in metaphysics, but
 there's really no other way to spend the time when it's too cold to
 paint.

>read february

 I hate not being able to paint outdoors. Inevitably I find myself
 trudging through the gallery, wondering which paintings I might be
 able to get away with entering. But if every painting that hasn't been
 entered before will take me to the time and place it was painted, it
 means that unless I were especially stealthy I'd end up running into
 my former self as he was finishing up the work in question.  But it's
 frustrating looking back on a particularly happy work and knowing
 that, however much I long to go in, I'll always be too cautious to
 actually attempt it.

 Irene calling. Another night commiserating by candlelight.

>read march

 I've lost the master key. Was in the city finishing up with the garden
 painting this morning . . . I thought I heard a guard coming; grabbed
 the painting and ran, only to realise I'd dropped the key somewhere.
 By the time I got back, the gardens were open and the key was long
 gone. Had to walk home with the painting. Should probably be more
 philosophical about it, but in fact I don't think I've ever been
 angrier.

 Can't believe the entire gallery is lost.  All the paintings are
 inaccessible now except the one in my flat, the one I gave to Matilda,
 and the one I was working on this morning. Thank God I never got
 around to putting that one back in the gallery!

 All I can think, over and over, is Life's work. Inaccessible forever.
 Life's work. Forever.

>read april

 Quarantined in the house; they estimate we'll be able to leave the
 neighbourhood next week.  Heard on the wireless this morning that the
 gardens have gone up in flames: arson, they're saying, or looters.

 I spent all day today staring at the painting I finished in the
 gardens, but I'm afraid of what could happen if I actually used it. I
 could have lost the key anytime that morning, and if I couldn't find
 it I'd have no way to get back here.

 Damn it. Will give the painting to Matilda---she'll appreciate it and
 I won't have to think about it anymore.

>read may

 I think Irene knows where I've hidden the gun; I caught her sneaking
 around in Matilda's flat very early this morning. I haven't told
 either of them that I saw her, but Matilda might do well to lock her
 front door at night.

 At this point it serves me right even if she does find it. Helped
 Matilda hang the peace gardens painting upstairs in her flat, then
 gave the gallery key to Irene and told her to keep it safe somewhere
 where I'd never have to look at it again---it's useless now.

>read june

 I can't take this anymore. I've almost finished a new painting in the
 garden behind the house; tomorrow morning, as soon as it's done, I'm
 going in. If Irene catches me, so much the better, because I can't
 stand to wait any longer.

 That's the last entry.

>examine  box
 A sizable rosewood affair, large enough to stand in, and lovingly
 handpainted with little music notes floating around a building---a
 building that looks a lot like our flat, in fact. There's a dark
 scrawl on the side of the box, which, strangely, doesn't seem to have
 a bottom; under the closed lid I can see the paint drawing towards a
 single point, leading down farther and farther, into darkness.

>examine scrawl
 A series of totally illegible thin lines, but they're definitely Leo's
 initials.

 The box springs open, revealing a ring of keys, and a familiar, sweet

 The stone is slightly flawed near the handle, but otherwise it's such

 expecting anything to happen . . .

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 It continually amazes me that Leo can simply splatter paint at random

 spaghetti sauce on the floor and he could simply extend the line of

 I'm more or less used to it by now, but by far the most awkward part
 of my living arrangement continues to be the sharing of this toilet

 be friends quickly and have long since learned to pretend we don't
 have occasional graceless encounters. The door back to my flat is

 Front Room
 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the
 number of times I've been in this room on one hand. It's attractively
 done up, though a bit austere in the furniture department. The walls
 here used to be completely covered in his paintings, but apparently
 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly
 bare.

 The stairs up are to the west, the kitchen north, and a locked door
 which I assume leads to Irene's room northeast. The foyer lies back to
 the southeast.

>go north

 Leo's Kitchen
 This room, too, was once a sort of miniature exhibition of Leo's
 paintings, but they, too, have vanished since last I was here. The
 setup here is even more minimalist than in the front room---no table,
 even. The door out to his back porch is northwest, and the front room
 is south.

 Bizarrely, the door is locked from the outside. There's even a little

 I have a number of keys, and it takes me a moment to go through them
 all, but I am immensely disturbed when the key that slips in the lock
 and turns ends up being the key to my own front door. I hope Irene
 isn't aware that she can go in and out of my flat at her leisure, but,
 I realise with a sinking feeling, she almost certainly is, and does.

 I open the door to Irene's Room.

 Casually, I lean over and peek through the door; no one seems to be
 about. I step cautiously through the doorway.

 Irene's Room
 This bedroom seems like a room from another flat completely; at any
 rate it's free of Leo's cavalier paint-it-all approach to decor. The
 furniture is spartan to the point of ruthlessness, arranged to frame
 the gigantic four-poster waterbed. The overall effect is one of rather
 severe cleanliness. The front room is back to the southwest.

>examine bed
 A luxurious and horribly inviting waterbed that I can only imagine
 must be murder upon the spinal cord. With the exception of a large
 quilt that seems to have been banished to the far side of the room,
 the linens are tasteful and colourless; the cumulative effect is to
 make one almost overwhelmingly sleepy just looking at it.

 On its edge lies a single sheet of notebook paper.

>read paper
 (the papers)
 It looks like the entries are monthly, dating from last November up
 until this month.

>examine sheet
 A calligraphy pen on unlined paper, and a trembling, angular hand that
 I recognise as Irene's. It reads:

 Dear, dear Ivy, I looked up today and realised I'd been gazing at you
 for hours . . . I was thinking, my father used to say you looked just
 like your mother, but he never said the same about me . . . do you
 suppose that's why he painted you right after his wife died, but
 simply sat and cried when I lost mine? But whom do you think he loved
 better, then, mine or yours?

 Ivy, do you know how many times I've pushed the button on the
 pocketwatch, just to watch you watch me? and twice I came within
 seconds of leaping into the painting, just to be with you again? I
 miss you . . . I miss you . . .

 The rest of the page trails off into ellipsis-laden indecipherability.

>examine quilt
 It seems to be hand-crocheted, woven in a spiral of clashing colours
 working their way slowly out from the centre. Ornate and well-crafted,
 but an eyesore, really. It seems to have been thrown over some large,
 awkwardly-shaped object in the corner here.

>move quilt
 I pull the blanket to one side of the room, revealing a large painting
 perched on an easel.

 A young girl, perhaps four years old and decked out in a polka-dotted

 A little less hesitantly this time, I clamber into the painting,

 Irene's Room has vanished.

 Drawing Room
 A somewhat fussily decorated sitting room, all high-flung Queen Anne
 arches and artfully aged brick. Not far in front of me is Irene's
 older sister---Ivy, was it?---perhaps four years old, looking
 unnaturally posed in an uncomfortable-looking white gown and elaborate
 hat. Her father is some distance away, putting the last strokes on the
 painting. Outside, the snow falls.

 Ivy has turned and is looking directly at me. She says nothing.

>ask ivy about irene
 Before I can move, Ivy speaks. "Da? Look!"

 He does. Then he removes his pince-nez and watches me silently for a
 moment. He has Leo's eyes, I notice.

 Unwilling to say anything, I stand up and hand him the stone key (the
 same one that Leo took away from me before, surely? but there's no
 time for such thoughts now). Then I lean over to steal a glance at the
 painting---it is complete, exactly as it will be in seventy years but
 for the colours, which are slightly brighter. The real Ivy watches me
 intensely. Her father, meanwhile, is turning the ankh over and over in
 his hands. At last he looks up to stare at me bemusedly. "An
 interesting contraption, I must say. You are to be commended on your
 stealth. I do, however, insist on knowing how you came to be in my
 sitting room without the servants' knowledge. You shall have to
 explain yourself, madam."

 In spite of myself, I find myself smiling up at him inanely.

 Irene's Room
 This bedroom seems like a room from another flat completely; at any
 rate it's free of Leo's cavalier paint-it-all approach to decor. The
 furniture is spartan to the point of ruthlessness, arranged to frame
 the gigantic four-poster waterbed. The overall effect is one of rather
 severe cleanliness; the painting of the young girl in the corner
 seeming to constitute the only exception to the rule. The front room
 is back to the southwest.

 On the waterbed is a page of looseleaf.

 Front Room
 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the
 number of times I've been in this room on one hand. It's attractively
 done up, though a bit austere in the furniture department. The walls
 here used to be completely covered in his paintings, but apparently
 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly
 bare.

 The stairs up are to the west, the kitchen north, and a locked door
 which I assume leads to Irene's room northeast. The foyer lies back to
 the southeast.

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a

 floor as it is. The front door lies to the southwest. The stairs up to
 the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 My waterfall painting lies ruined on the floor.

>examine waterfall
 This was a landscape Leo painted for me, of a cliff with a gigantic
 waterfall completely filling the sky behind it. He usually paints from
 life---he gets up before dawn every day to paint in all kinds of
 strange places---but I asked him to do one for me from his mind, and
 as far as I know it was the only one he's ever done. Now the frame is
 shattered and the canvas torn nearly in half.

 The pond dominates the view.

 I'm hardly one for sentimentality, but frankly this window, with its
 panoramic view of the pond, is the reason I bought the flat. It's a

 into a bloody greenhouse.

 A little less hesitantly this time, I clamber into the painting,

 Sky Pavilion
 Impossible.

 This is one of the exhibits in the Peace Gardens downtown, just
 outside of the city . . . but it doesn't exist anymore. They tore the
 entire neighbourhood down four or five months ago, after it burned to
 the ground. Someone's cigarette, right in this pavilion, I think, or
 maybe it turned out to be arson after all; either way, it was big news
 at the time.

 And yet, here it is, much colder here than back home. There's a sheer
 precipice just north of this pavilion, and the panoramic view of the
 city and the river has always been---always used to be---to our city
 what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. No tourists here today, though; the
 garden must not be open yet. The pavilion, its entrance formed by two
 towering redwoods, arcs over my head, and the path down to the main
 part of the gardens is south.

 A sudden noise behind me, and I turn and see Leo, painting in the main
 garden to the south. I am about to call out when he suddenly snatches
 his still-dripping painting off the easel and darts away out of sight.

>press button
 My hand hovers over the button, but hesitates at the last second. If
 I'm in the past, any motion I take to detain Leo could change history,
 surely? I want him to stay behind, to see me, more than anything, but
 prudence---or perhaps cowardice---stops me.

 Pardon me, but the idea is ridiculous.

 garden entrance is to the south.

 I rush toward Leo, calling his name as he dallies atop the thickest
 part of the hedge, but just as I reach the pavilion he nimbly leaps
 down to the other side.

 Earth Pavilion
 This area is the only one that's received any sunlight yet this
 morning. The ice has mostly melted here, and the petals on the rose
 trees, perhaps encouraged by the frost, are cascading down in a
 continuous shower. The rest of the pavilion is covered by all manner
 of overgrown early spring blooms, and trees that have somehow managed
 to be in flower this early in the year. The only exit is back to the
 northwest.

 The only evidence of Leo's presence is a large stone key, already
 half-obscured by the falling petals.

 Chips of mica glimmer as I pick the key up. It's oddly warm, whether

 few bright blue.

 Sea Pavilion (in monochrome)
 The river runs immediately outside the hedge here, which is cut into a
 window to reveal it roaring past. The main feature of this area is of
 course the fountains, which rise from everywhere, their waters tinted
 by the plants living in each. It's all very self-consciously
 beautiful, of course, but I can't deny that it pleases even me. The
 path itself winds slowly between them, meandering back around to the
 northeast.

>search hedge
 City and river, entwined.

>examine river
 A wide, stately, slow-flowing body of water, the sort songs are
 written about. From here one sees the river before it flows into the
 city; a blessing, since it's usually some shade of brown when it comes
 out the other side

 At the moment, of course, it isn't flowing at all. I turn away,
 discomfited.

 Quarantined in the house; they estimate we'll be able to leave the
 neighbourhood next week.  Heard on the wireless this morning that the
 gardens have gone up in flames: arson, they're saying, or looters.

 I spent all day today staring at the painting I finished in the
 gardens, but I'm afraid of what could happen if I actually used it. I
 could have lost the key anytime that morning, and if I couldn't find
 it I'd have no way to get back here.

 Damn it. Will give the painting to Matilda---she'll appreciate it and
 I won't have to think about it anymore.

>read march

 I've lost the master key. Was in the city finishing up with the garden
 painting this morning . . . I thought I heard a guard coming; grabbed
 the painting and ran, only to realise I'd dropped the key somewhere.
 By the time I got back, the gardens were open and the key was long
 gone. Had to walk home with the painting. Should probably be more
 philosophical about it, but in fact I don't think I've ever been
 angrier.

 Can't believe the entire gallery is lost.  All the paintings are
 inaccessible now except the one in my flat, the one I gave to Matilda,
 and the one I was working on this morning. Thank God I never got
 around to putting that one back in the gallery!

 All I can think, over and over, is Life's work. Inaccessible forever.

 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the

 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly

 A garden, co-grown by Leo and me, although it generally seems like I
 end up doing most of the work. Currently the centrepiece of the garden
 is an easel of Leo's, which at the moment is ruthlessly engaged in
 crushing my violets, a very recent-looking painting of the pond to the
 east perched upon it. His porch is to the west, mine to the east.

>examine painting
 It's of the pond due east of here, and it looks to be complete, or
 nearly so. Leo's done it up to be rather nicer than it really is, all
 shimmers and ripples as the sun rises over it, and even a small fox in
 the lower right hand corner, sipping the water. It doesn't seem like
 the paint is even completely dry.

 These violets' sacrifice for artistic beauty is obscurely poetic, I
 suppose, but still constitutes an insenstive move on Leo's part.

 Leo built this porch himself, five or six years ago, ruining the

 The setup here is even more minimalist than in the front room---no

 front room is south.

>go northeast

 Irene's Room
 This bedroom seems like a room from another flat completely; at any
 rate it's free of Leo's cavalier paint-it-all approach to decor. The
 furniture is spartan to the point of ruthlessness, arranged to frame
 the gigantic four-poster waterbed. The overall effect is one of rather
 severe cleanliness; the painting of the young girl in the corner
 seeming to constitute the only exception to the rule. The front room
 is back to the southwest.

 On the waterbed is a page of looseleaf.

>read looselead
 What do you want me to read in?

>read looseleaf
 A calligraphy pen on unlined paper, and a trembling, angular hand that
 I recognise as Irene's. It reads:

 Dear, dear Ivy, I looked up today and realised I'd been gazing at you
 for hours . . . I was thinking, my father used to say you looked just
 like your mother, but he never said the same about me . . . do you
 suppose that's why he painted you right after his wife died, but
 simply sat and cried when I lost mine? But whom do you think he loved
 better, then, mine or yours?

 Ivy, do you know how many times I've pushed the button on the
 pocketwatch, just to watch you watch me? and twice I came within
 seconds of leaping into the painting, just to be with you again? I
 miss you . . . I miss you . . .

 The rest of the page trails off into ellipsis-laden indecipherability.

>take looseleaf
 Taken.

>examine painting
 A young girl, perhaps four years old and decked out in a polka-dotted
 dress, gazes directly at me with a frankness that manages to be
 completely disconcerting. I want to say that this is Irene herself,
 eighty years ago, but it's impossible to say for sure.

 The painting's subject taps her foot impatiently.

>enter painting
 I step gingerly into the art, closing my eyes just in time to avoid
 the blinding flash of light . . .

 Drawing Room
 A somewhat fussily decorated sitting room, all high-flung Queen Anne
 arches and artfully aged brick. Not far in front of me is Irene's
 older sister---Ivy, was it?---perhaps four years old, looking
 unnaturally posed in an uncomfortable-looking white gown and elaborate
 hat. Her father is some distance away, putting the last strokes on the
 painting. Outside, the snow falls.

 Ivy has turned and is looking directly at me. She says nothing.

>examine ivy
 I try to mentally add three quarter-centuries to her face to see if I
 can come up with Irene, but it's a futile effort. Her Sunday best is
 looking a little wrinkled, the end result of an afternoon's squirming,
 and her hands-clasped-head-cocked "I'm adorable" pose is perhaps a bit
 contrived, but overall she looks eminently paintable.

>ask ivy about irene
 Before I can move, Ivy speaks. "Da? Look!"

 He does. Then he removes his pince-nez and watches me silently for a
 moment. He has Leo's eyes, I notice.

 Unwilling to say anything, I stand up and hand him the stone key (the
 same one that Leo took away from me before, surely? but there's no
 time for such thoughts now). Then I lean over to steal a glance at the
 painting---it is complete, exactly as it will be in seventy years but
 for the colours, which are slightly brighter. The real Ivy watches me
 intensely. Her father, meanwhile, is turning the ankh over and over in
 his hands. At last he looks up to stare at me bemusedly. "An
 interesting contraption, I must say. You are to be commended on your
 stealth. I do, however, insist on knowing how you came to be in my
 sitting room without the servants' knowledge. You shall have to
 explain yourself, madam."

 In spite of myself, I find myself smiling up at him inanely.

 In the Cabin
 Leo's studio is an utter shambles. The ceiling is alarmingly low and
 pockmarked with holes, the hammock strung across the rear of the room
 is all tangled up in itself, and the writing-desk beside it is
 completely covered in debris. On the desk is an empty spindle, and
 across from it stands a tranquilly ticking grandfather clock. The door
 back outside lies to the north.

 There is now just enough light to see by, with more light coming from
 the moon than from the glimmer of purple in the west.

>examine clock
 Solid ash. I have no idea how Leo got this in here---it's taller than
 the door---but it does do rather a lot for the room's ambiance. The
 face, for some reason, is at the bottom of the clock, and the exposed
 pendulum swings freely at eye level.

>examine watch

 thin loop of chain and a small black button just below six o'clock.

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 The shore here is little more than an abbreviated stretch of sand,
 with the oncoming darkness and the height of the cliffs opposite
 combine to produce an oddly desolate effect. The tide itself is quite
 high up: water is beginning to engulf the trees, as well as the legs
 of a small easel planted in the sand. I can continue up the beach to
 the north, the dock extends over the water to the west, and to the
 south, situated dangerously close to the water, is a small cabin built
 perpendicular to the beach.

>examine easel
 A somewhat rickety elmwood easel, positioned so as to give the artist
 a good view over the bay. It doesn't seem to have been used for quite
 some time, though---it's soaked through with recent rain, and appears
 to be rotting away in places.

 In fact . . . following the easel's line of sight over the ocean, I
 realise with a shock that the painting I've just come through isn't an
 abstract at all: Leo has simply painted the reflection of the setting
 sun on the bay, exactly as it is---the water in the light is throwing
 up dozens of colours, slowly shifting with the current, flowing out
 with the tide.

 Where does this key come from?" I ask, pulling out the metal ankh.

 She takes it from me, turning it over in her hands. "This was my
 father's. He never did tell us where he got it---it took him long
 enough to even tell us it existed." She turns toward me,
 conspiratorially. "Taking a chip off the side, though---that was all
 my idea. He never noticed that. Truth be told, I don't know that he
 actually invented it---I think it might have been given to him as some
 kind of favor; I don't recall the details."

 She pauses, an idea seeming to occur to her. "Leo thinks that's
 missing, you know. I should show it to him if I were you; things would
 have turned out quite differently this morning if he'd had it."

>ask irene about father
 "Who was your father? Would I have known him?" I ask.

 "Not likely," she says. "He died before you met us. Stroke. Probably

 A garden, co-grown by Leo and me, although it generally seems like I

 The pond is a much more mysterious place at sunrise, all grays and

 fence marking the edge of the property stretches along the southern
 perimeter of the pond. My kitchen lies to the southwest, inaccessible

 Garden
 I'd forgotten how different the garden looks in the early morning, all
 the trees leaning and the droplets all bedewed and whatnot. The canvas
 I recently came through is still here, so fresh the paint is still
 dripping in places. The porch lies west, the pond east.

>go west

 Porch
 Leo's porch is decidedly less congenial in the dark. There's not
 enough light inside to make out what's happening in Leo's kitchen, to
 the southeast, and even the gardens just east of here are shrouded in
 shadow.

>in
 I try to peek inside, but even this early the light is bright enough
 to make that impractical.  I cautiously squeak the slider open. I take
 a single step inside . . .

 . . . and abruptly find myself face to face with an astonished Leo.

 I can't go that way.

>look
 Leo's Kitchen
 The setup here is even more minimalist than in the front room---no
 table, even. The door out to his back porch is northwest, and the
 front room is south.

 Leo stands here, looking healthy but frazzled.

 "Wait a moment," says Leo, his voice suddenly strained. I follow his
 line of vision, realising that he has fixated on the pocketwatch I
 found in the living room. I watch interestedly as his face attempts to
 resolve itself into a single emotion. He seems to be about to say
 something when suddenly his gaze shifts to the stone key in my hand.
 "Dear God, Matilda. Where did you find this? Do you---wait, never
 mind."

 Before I realise what's happening he has seized the key from my hand.
 I let out a shocked exclamation, but before I can object he has blazed
 off to the south.

>go south

 Front Room
 In the early-morning darkness this room isn't quite as inviting as it
 was earlier. The major geography, however, is unchanged: kitchen to
 the north, Irene's room to the northeast, stairs to the west, and the
 foyer to the southeast.

 From nearby comes the sound of someone pounding up the stairs.

>go up

 Staircase
 This staircase is the mirror of mine except that his picture window
 looks out on the neighbours' rooftops. I can continue up or down.

 A piercingly loud snapping sound comes from upstairs.

>go up

 Upstairs
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching rainbows of subtly graduated colour, and the walls are
 covered with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the
 west, the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching spectrums of subtly graduated grey, and the walls are covered
 with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the west,

 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 On the shelf is a diamond ring.

 A familiar snapping sound comes from the hallway.

 Leo is waiting here for me, waving the pocketwatch cord about
 violently. He looks desperate, more frightened than I can ever recall
 seeing him.

 "Matilda, where's the glass key gone? It should be in the music box,
 with the other keys, but it isn't there. Without it I can't get into
 the gallery."

>ask leo about glass key
 "Leo, tell me about your gallery. Where would I find the key?"

 "All my work is in there; I've been gradually moving them there for
 years. I have to get it back---I got over it the first time, but now
 that I have this key again I don't think I could go through this a
 second time."

>answer 'irene'
 Whom do you want me to answer that to?

>leo
 (,)
 Fortunately for Leo, you can't order him around the way you do me.

>answer irene to leo
 I honestly think extensive discourse is beyond me this morning . . .
 I'd probably be better off just restricting myself to asking and
 telling.

 "What I really don't understand," Leo continues,  "and you don't have
 to explain if you'd rather not---is how you got the pocketwatch. I'd
 recognise it anywhere, but it can't be mine, because I've got it right
 here." He waves his own, snapping it on and off a few times for good
 measure. "I can only imagine Irene must have given it to you, but I
 can't imagine why."

>tell leo about rule
 No words come.

 He sinks slowly to the floor. "Christ, Matilda, I don't know what to
 do. I find my key after thinking it was lost forever, but my gallery
 is gone unless I can find that damn key. And now I can't find Irene
 anywhere."

>ask leo about gun
 "Leo, where do you keep your grandfather's pistol?"

 He opens his mouth. "Don't lie to me," I add. "I know you didn't get
 rid of it. Tell me where it's hidden."

 His mouth opens, closes again. Then he says quietly, "I don't know
 what you're talking about, Matilda."
>tell leo about irene
 "Leo," I say breathlessly, "You have to be careful. Irene's going to
 have the gun and see you going into the painting and shoot you."

 He simply stares.
>ask leo about my painting
 No words come.

 Leo murmurs something incomprehensible under his breath.

>ask leo about painting
 "Leo, why in hell didn't you tell me about all this? About the
 paintings, and the keys? How couldn't you tell me about this whole
 world?"

 He goes pale. "How could I? You refused to marry me."
>ask leo about what marriage has to do with anything
 No words come.

 "All right," Leo says finally. "I'm going to keep searching. I
 couldn't find the key on the beach, but if you think you can find it
 you might look there. God knows, if I haven't found it by the time you
 get back I'll have to do something desperate."

 And with this, he walks to the bedroom door and turns his stone key in
 the lock. It flies open, and he steps into the complete whiteness
 beyond just before the door snaps shut behind him, leaving me alone.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Somewhat alarmingly, my front door stands wide open.

>go northeast

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
 Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
 paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
 stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 I hear a soft sound from the corner. Turning, I nearly jump out of my
 skin to see Irene standing at the bottom of the staircase, holding her
 hands clasped behind her back and staring at me in a peculiar way.

 "Well, hello, Matilda," she says. "I didn't think you were up yet."
 Her eyes flip back and forth from me to the staircase, confused.

>push button
 Hang on; I'm intrigued by what Irene's saying.

 "Listen," Irene says. Her voice is quick, intense, nothing like during
 our conversation on the bay. "I'm sorry to trespass on you like this.
 I came to see if Leo's been using you to hide things from me, and it
 turns out that he has." She gestures to the end table by the sofa.
 "Open the drawer there. I want you to see."

 A sick feeling develops in the pit of my stomach.

>ask irene about gun
 "Irene, where is Leo's gun?" I ask. My voice has become strangely
 uneven.

 "Right here, of course. He was trying to keep it from me by hiding it
 in your flat. It's illegal for him to have it at all, of course, but
 apparently he had no compunction about endangering you as well. Go on
 and open the drawer."

>open drawer
 Foreboding like nothing I have ever experienced, descending like a
 certain apocalypse. My hand shakes as I pull open the drawer . . .

 Oh, God.

>look in drawer
 My head turns to peer into the drawer, and I squeeze my eyes shut only
 just in time.

 Irene's voice: "I know you know it's there, Matilda. You can't hide it
 from yourself forever."

 "Well?" she asks. "No reaction? This isn't some benign happening we
 can just ignore, you know. He's concealing it from me for a reason. I
 won't let you pretend it isn't there."

>again
 Stop saying that! I will not tell you what is in that drawer.

 "Just take it!" she cries, gesturing to the drawer. "Why does it gall
 you to pay attention to commands from a human being instead of some
 figment of your imagination?"

 And yet, I am unable to do anything. I simply stand there, on the
 verge of panic, torn between two forces, either of which would easily
 be strong enough to control me on its own.

>push button
 What, and leave Irene alone with . . . wait, no, maybe you're right.

 While I dither, I look up to see that an expression of horror has
 appeared on Irene's face---directed not at me, I suddenly realise, but
 behind me.

 "Leo," she gasps. Grabbing her cane from beside her, she twists
 something on her bracelet and vanishes. I blink, and suddenly Irene is
 on the other side of the kitchen window.

 My gaze moves to the drawer, then out the window. My stomach sinks.

>look in drawer
 Empty, now.

 I hurry to look out the kitchen window, just in time to see Leo is
 standing in front of the painting in the garden, pocketwatch in hand.
 Irene is standing on the porch and has raised the gun on him; she
 seems to be speaking quietly. The window mutes their conversation, but
 I know enough about what's going to happen to realise that I can't be
 here when it finishes.

 I barely hear the gunshot. By the time my former self comes innocently
 down the stairs, about to answer her doorbell, I am already deep into
 the woods. Perhaps without my interference she'll be able to sort all
 this out better than I have.

 headland surrounded by rocky, shallow water on three sides. The beach
 arcs back to the south.

 Irene dozes in her lawn chair.

>go south
 I nod farewell to Irene and set off back down the beach.

 Along the Beach
 The shore here is little more than an abbreviated stretch of sand,
 with the oncoming darkness and the height of the cliffs opposite
 combine to produce an oddly desolate effect. The tide itself is quite
 high up: water is beginning to engulf the trees, as well as the legs
 of a small easel planted in the sand. I can continue up the beach to
 the north, the dock extends over the water to the west, and to the
 south, situated dangerously close to the water, is a small cabin built
 perpendicular to the beach.

 "Irene," I say, voicing something I've been thinking for a long time,
 "are you sure that cane is quite sufficient? I worry that one of these
 days you're going to fall over when we aren't there."

 "I'd rather break myself than have you catch me dead in a wheelchair,"
 she replies.

>ask irene about glass key
 "Irene, do you know where the key to Leo's gallery is?"

 She grins and points down the beach. "I threw it up on the roof of the
 cabin down there when he asked me to hide it somewhere safe. But that
 must have been a month ago. Are you and Leo only just noticing it's
 gone?"

 "Mind you," she adds after a pause, "I'm only telling you because I
 know you'll never get up there. No ladders hereabouts, you know."

>ask irene about bracelet
 "Irene, about that bracelet---"

 "Ah," she smiles. "You like my jewellery? I invented it myself." She
 twists the setting of one of the charms on the end, and vanishes. I
 hear a chuckle, and spin around to see her sitting immediately behind
 me.

 "Very useful indeed."

 Leo's studio is an utter shambles. The ceiling is alarmingly low and
 pockmarked with holes, the hammock strung across the rear of the room

 A sizable rosewood affair, large enough to stand in, and lovingly
 handpainted with little music notes floating around a building---a
 building that looks a lot like our flat, in fact. There's a dark
 scrawl on the side of the box, which, strangely, doesn't seem to have
 a bottom; under the open lid I can see the paint drawing towards a
 single point, leading down farther and farther, into darkness.

 the music rises into a full orchestra that seems to resonate from
 everywhere at once.

 naked yearning.

 There is a satisfying snap as the key turns in the lock, and as soon
 as I withdraw the key the door flies open with an ostentatious flash
 of light. Feeling profoundly nervous, I walk through to the other
 side.

 Porch
 Leo built this porch himself, five or six years ago, ruining the
 building's symmetricality and making me quite rabidly jealous. His
 kitchen is accessible to the southeast, and our garden is east.

>go east

 Garden
 A garden, co-grown by Leo and me, although it generally seems like I
 end up doing most of the work. Currently the centrepiece of the garden
 is an easel of Leo's, which at the moment is ruthlessly engaged in
 crushing my violets, a very recent-looking painting of the pond to the
 east perched upon it. His porch is to the west, mine to the east.

 By the Pond
 The pond is a much more mysterious place at sunrise, all grays and
 ripples and dappled twilight---I find myself wishing I had the time to
 simply stand and look. I can access the garden to the west, and the
 fence marking the edge of the property stretches along the southern
 perimeter of the pond. My kitchen lies to the southwest, inaccessible
 behind the sliding door.

>go west

 Garden
 I'd forgotten how different the garden looks in the early morning, all
 the trees leaning and the droplets all bedewed and whatnot. The canvas
 I recently came through is still here, so fresh the paint is still
 dripping in places. The porch lies west, the pond east.

>go west

 Porch
 Leo's porch is decidedly less congenial in the dark. There's not
 enough light inside to make out what's happening in Leo's kitchen, to
 the southeast, and even the gardens just east of here are shrouded in
 shadow.

 I try to peek inside, but even this early the light is bright enough
 to make that impractical.  I cautiously squeak the slider open. I take
 a single step inside . . .

 . . . and abruptly find myself face to face with an astonished Leo.

>ask leo about stone key
 I hold up the Ankh for Leo's inspection.

 "Wait a moment," says Leo, his voice suddenly strained. I follow his
 line of vision, realising that he has fixated on the diamond ring I
 found in his room. I watch interestedly as his face attempts to
 resolve itself into a single emotion. He seems to be about to say
 something when suddenly his gaze shifts to the stone key in my hand.
 "Dear God, Matilda. Where did you find this? Do you---wait, never
 mind."

 Before I realise what's happening he has seized the key from my hand.
 I let out a shocked exclamation, but before I can object he has blazed
 off to the south.

>go south

 Front Room
 In the early-morning darkness this room isn't quite as inviting as it
 was earlier. The major geography, however, is unchanged: kitchen to
 the north, Irene's room to the northeast, stairs to the west, and the
 foyer to the southeast.

 From nearby comes the sound of someone pounding up the stairs.

>go up

 Staircase
 This staircase is the mirror of mine except that his picture window
 looks out on the neighbours' rooftops. I can continue up or down.

 A piercingly loud snapping sound comes from upstairs.

>go up

 Upstairs
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching rainbows of subtly graduated colour, and the walls are
 covered with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the
 west, the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

>go north
 I open Leo's bedroom door.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 A familiar snapping sound comes from the hallway.

 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in

 west, the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

 Leo is waiting here for me, waving the pocketwatch cord about
 violently. He looks desperate, more frightened than I can ever recall
 seeing him.

 "Matilda, where's the glass key gone? It should be in the music box,
 with the other keys, but it isn't there. Without it I can't get into
 the gallery."

>tell Leo about glass key
 "Leo, tell me about your gallery. Where would I find the key?"

 "All my work is in there; I've been gradually moving them there for
 years. I have to get it back---I got over it the first time, but now
 that I have this key again I don't think I could go through this a
 second time."

>take stone key
 That seems to belong to Leo.

 "What I really don't understand," Leo continues,  "and you don't have
 to explain if you'd rather not---is how you got the diamond ring. I'd
 recognise it anywhere, but it can't be mine, because I've got it right
 here." He waves his own, snapping it on and off a few times for good
 measure. "I can only imagine Irene must have given it to you, but I
 can't imagine why."

>tell Leo about murder
 No words come.

 He sinks slowly to the floor. "Christ, Matilda, I don't know what to
 do. I find my key after thinking it was lost forever, but my gallery
 is gone unless I can find that damn key. And now I can't find Irene
 anywhere."

>tell Leo about Irene
 "Leo," I say breathlessly, "You have to be careful. Irene's going to
 have the gun and see you going into the painting and shoot you."

 He simply stares.
>ask leo about gallery
 I can't think of anything that hasn't already been said.

>tell Leo about murder
 No words come.

 Leo murmurs something incomprehensible under his breath.

>wait
 Half a minute or so goes by.

 "All right," Leo says finally. "I'm going to keep searching. I
 couldn't find the key on the beach, but if you think you can find it
 you might look there. God knows, if I haven't found it by the time you
 get back I'll have to do something desperate."

 And with this, he walks to the bedroom door and turns his stone key in
 the lock. It flies open, and he steps into the complete whiteness
 beyond just before the door snaps shut behind him, leaving me alone.

>go north
 I open Leo's bedroom door.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made

     another brass key

   a tiny copper key (which opens the padlock)
   an old bronze key (which opens Leo's bayside cabin)
   my house key

>turn ring
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

 The colours in the painting suddenly sparkle brilliantly---daylight in
 this dingy room---then fade just as quickly.

>enter painting
 Bizarre, how casually I can do this. I walk clean into another world,
 not even pausing to look behind me after I arrive.

 Dock's End
 It's much brighter here than last time---evening, rather than
 twilight, but nothing is moving, even the raindrops, and a bolt of
 lightning far off to the west gives a continuous eerie light to the
 horizon. The beach lies to the east, and the drops of water ascend
 into the sky as far as I can see.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

 I shiver as a raindrop slips into my eye.

>enter cabin
 I don't see any such thing.

>go east

 Along the Beach
 A thoroughly miserable spot, the tide gradually rising and threatening
 to engulf what little sand remains. A soaked-looking cabin lies to the
 south---padlocked shut again, of course--- and the beach continues to
 the north.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>enter cabin
 Using the old bronze key, I unlock the cabin door.

 Once more, the padlock springs open, executing a graceful parabola and
 landing in the water.

 I open the cabin door.

 In the Cabin
 An even worse mess than last time I was here. The music box stands
 open, playing a familiar lilting tune, and a fat stream of water is
 gushing into the cabin through the hole in the roof, then soaking out
 through the floor. All in all, a fairly miserable studio. On the
 opposite side of the room, placed, I now realise, as far as possible
 from the corner with the hole, are the desk and hammock, and the exit
 is to the north.

>push pendulum
 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A
 now-familiar snapping sound assaults my ears, and I turn to find my
 surroundings reverted once more to black and white, with only the
 music box and the pendulum remaining unchanged.

>leave
 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>exit cabin
 I only understood you as far as wanting me to exit.

>go north

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 I stop.

 The beach has been completely enveloped by a web of raindrops
 suspended in midair, so closely spaced that to get to the water's edge
 I have to pick my way slowly through them, one step at a time. I grasp
 a nearby droplet, trying to push it out of my way, but it doesn't
 budge, and even supports my weight as I strain against it. The cabin
 is back to the south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to
 the north.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>climb rain
 Cautiously, I grasp onto a raindrop at eye level, then lift myself up,
 finding a foothold on one of the drops below. It ends up being less
 dangerous than it looks---there's not much chance of falling since a
 mass of riveted-in-place droplets keeps me in caged into a sort of
 column. Eventually my heart rate subsides and I am able to reach roof
 level.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south
 from here.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>go south
 I step lightly onto the roof of the cabin, working my way through the
 web of rain.

 On the Roof (in monochrome)
 The summit of the cabin is completely flat, which is unfortunate for
 the cabin on days with weather like this---I can see the grandfather
 clock through one particularly rotten hole in the roof---but I
 appreciate it now, and the roughness of the surface makes it easy to
 gain purchase. I can (reluctantly) step back into the rain to the
 north or west---everything else is rock and water.

 A small marble box waits quietly in the shadow of the chimney.

>take box
 It won't move. It's like trying to manipulate solid rock.

 The diamond ring is gone.

>examine roof
 Ancient tiles that barely do their job anymore. In many places they
 have rotted away entirely, and in one spot there's a hole nearly large
 enough to fall through.

>examine box
 A polished marble container, perhaps built to hold pencils or
 paintbrushes, still shining but a little warped by several months of
 exposure. No keyhole, God be praised.

>enter hold
 I don't see any such thing.

>enter hole
 I doubt I could even get my head through that hole, let alone my body
 entire.

>reach through hole
 Lying down awkwardly, I reach into the hole---soaking my front
 completely in the process---and feel about in the cabin. My hand
 lights on the top of the grandfather clock. If I stretched I could
 probably reach the pendulum from here.

>push pendulum
 Lying down and reaching deep into the hole, I draw the very top of the
 pendulum to the side and release. There is a snapping sound as it
 resumes its slow ticking, and the world returns to normal.

 more to black and white, with only the music box and the pendulum
 remaining unchanged.

>climb down

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>go north
 I make my way to the edge, and, after a ghastly moment of vertigo,
 step off the roof and into the web of rain.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south

 I pick my way carefully through a web of frozen raindrops.

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 The sea and rain, arrested, wait silently. The cabin is back to the
 south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to the north.

>enter cabin

 In the Cabin (in monochrome)
 An unsettling glittery light pervades this room, reflected through the
 doorway by the sea of raindrops outside. A cascade of water is stopped
 in midair, gushing through a gaping hole in the cabin's low ceiling,
 just above the grandfather clock. The desk with its music box sits
 opposite, and the exit is back to the north.

 Everything in the room has been bleached of colour except the music
 box and grandfather clock, whose pendulum shines like burnished gold.

>open box
 That's already open.

>get in box
 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different
 world.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 The ring has reappeared on my ringer.

 Hearing the loud snap that accompanies my entrance, Leo hurries into
 the room. "Did you find the key?"

 When I hold up the box, his face morphs into the happiest expression I
 have ever seen on a human face. "Irene!" he cries. "I . . . you . . .
 " and he pulls me into a fierce hug. After a few moments of this, I
 pull back, and his expression turns solemn. "And there's something I
 need to ask---"

 He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear
 Irene's voice floating up the stairs. "Leo?"

 He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
 "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the box from my
 hands and zips out to the south.

 I simply stand there for a moment, basking in the warm glow of my own
 accomplishment, when I realise with a surge of horror that both Irene
 and whatever weapon she used are still unaccounted for---in fact, she
 probably has the gun already. I have only a few minutes to act.

 Squeezing myself through the gaps in the raindrops, I travel slowly
 down the beach.

 On the Cape (in monochrome)
 Without the setting sun bringing colour to the landscape, the cape has
 become a dismal place indeed. Irene's Adirondack chair stands alone
 here, looking out morosely over the water. The rain soaks everything
 throughly, the drops glittering eerily as they catch the light, like a
 bridge into the sky.

 More efficiently this time, I grab a raindrop and carefully work my
 way up a story.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I stop somewhat arbitrarily when it ceases to feel safe to go farther,
 my vantage point perhaps three times higher than what I'm accustomed

 In the early-morning darkness this room isn't quite as inviting as it

 Through the door to the southeast comes the murmur of voices, not
 quite audible from here.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Leo and Irene's voices are clearly audible through the door:

 A brief silence. "What do you mean?"

 I hear the jingle of a key. "I've padlocked the cabin, Leo. You've
 been spending far too much time on that beach, fondling your little
 box on the water."

 "Irene, give me that key. And give me that gun."

>go northeast
 Hand on the doorknob, I hesitate. It's far too late to stop Irene at
 this point; I can listen to their conversation easily from here, and
 if I intervene I risk getting hurt myself.

 Leo and Irene's voices are clearly audible through the door:

 A long pause. I picture them at a standoff, coldly regarding each
 other from opposite sides of the room. And then I hear Leo's voice
 shout "Give it to me!", followed by a scuffling noise.

>go northeast
 Slowly, I creak the door open. I don't expect them to hear me with
 their argument in full swing, and the bullet to my hip comes as
 something of a shock.

 As the room begins to swim, I wonder idly if anyone will think to call
 Emergency.

 A sudden, tremendous report that dies away, leaving a preternatural

 Abruptly, the door swings open, revealing Irene.

 "I hope you're happy!" she shouts, her voice loud enough to give me
 the queerest sense that she is addressing not me, but at someone
 directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
 she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
 staircase.

 We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
 descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
 find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.

 Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
 us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
 paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
 might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
 hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
 Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
 what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
 unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and

 I nod farewell to Irene and set off back down the beach.

 Along the Beach
 The shore here is little more than an abbreviated stretch of sand,
 with the oncoming darkness and the height of the cliffs opposite
 combine to produce an oddly desolate effect. The tide itself is quite
 high up: water is beginning to engulf the trees, as well as the legs
 of a small easel planted in the sand. I can continue up the beach to
 the north, the dock extends over the water to the west, and to the
 south, situated dangerously close to the water, is a small cabin built
 perpendicular to the beach.

 There is a satisfying snap as the key turns in the lock, and as soon

 side.

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic. The
 walls are now entirely bare, the waterfall painting scattered over the
 floor as it is. The front door lies to the southwest. The stairs up to
 the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 My waterfall painting lies ruined on the floor.

 This was a landscape Leo painted for me, of a cliff with a gigantic
 waterfall completely filling the sky behind it. He usually paints from
 life---he gets up before dawn every day to paint in all kinds of
 strange places---but I asked him to do one for me from his mind, and
 as far as I know it was the only one he's ever done. Now the frame is
 shattered and the canvas torn nearly in half.

>polished
 That isn't a verb I recognise.

>examine polished
 A polished marble container, perhaps built to hold pencils or
 paintbrushes, still shining but a little warped by several months of
 exposure. No keyhole, God be praised.

 The wind redoubles its force, then fades again.

>break glass key
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 The wind abates for a second, the rain momentarily slackening.

>go down
 I doubt I could even get my head through that hole, let alone my body
 entire.

 My hair becomes plastered to my face by the waves of rain.

>go north
 The law of gravity is unfortunately back in effect, and stepping off a
 rooftop is once again an incredibly bad idea.

 I shiver as a raindrop slips into my eye.

>push pendulum
 Reaching through the hole, I just manage to poke the topmost point of
 the pendulum, arresting its motion. A now-familiar snapping sound
 assaults my ears, and I turn to find my surroundings reverted once
 more to black and white, with only the music box and the pendulum
 remaining unchanged.

>go north
 I make my way to the edge, and, after a ghastly moment of vertigo,
 step off the roof and into the web of rain.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south
 from here.

>go down
 I pick my way carefully through a web of frozen raindrops.

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 The sea and rain, arrested, wait silently. The cabin is back to the
 south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to the north.

>go south

 In the Cabin (in monochrome)
 An unsettling glittery light pervades this room, reflected through the
 doorway by the sea of raindrops outside. A cascade of water is stopped
 in midair, gushing through a gaping hole in the cabin's low ceiling,
 just above the grandfather clock. The desk with its music box sits
 opposite, and the exit is back to the north.

 Everything in the room has been bleached of colour except the music
 box and grandfather clock, whose pendulum shines like burnished gold.

>push pendulum
 I draw the very top of the pendulum to the side and release. There is
 a snapping sound as it resumes its slow ticking, and the world returns
 to normal.

>go north

 Along the Beach
 It's more or less impossible to escape a complete drenching here, with
 the sea threatening to engulf the beach, the trees, and even the
 studio. The cabin is back to the south, the dock to the west, and the

>go west

 Dock's End
 It's much brighter here than last time---evening, rather than
 twilight, but the weather has rather deteriorated; a steady, heavy
 rain is falling, occasionally punctuated by distant flashes of
 lightning. The wind has picked up considerably, the water roiling over
 the edges of the dock. It occurs to me that I'm probably a walking
 lightning rod standing out over the water like this, and perhaps ought
 to retreat to the east.

 As I say, I can't swim.

 The rain beats on the roof, louder here than outside.

 In the Cabin
 Leo's studio is an utter shambles. The ceiling is alarmingly low and
 pockmarked with holes, the hammock strung across the rear of the room
 is all tangled up in itself, and the writing-desk beside it is
 completely covered in debris. On the desk is an empty spindle, and
 across from it stands a tranquilly ticking grandfather clock. The door
 back outside lies to the north.

 The oboe fades, the clarinet dimming as it echoes its melody.

 The woodwinds cadence as the strings fall to the bottom of their

 The western horizon has gone entirely black; the stars twinkle near
 the half-moon.

>unlock door with ankh
 Confidently, I slip the key into the lock and stride forward into pure
 alabaster.

 Whiteness
 Again, the endless white in every direction. The only feature of this
 place seems to be the door I came in through.

>unlock door with jade
 There is a satisfying snap as the key turns in the lock, and as soon
 as I withdraw the key the door flies open with an ostentatious flash
 of light. Feeling profoundly nervous, I walk through to the other
 side.

 Porch
 Leo built this porch himself, five or six years ago, ruining the
 building's symmetricality and making me quite rabidly jealous. His
 kitchen is accessible to the southeast, and our garden is east.

>go east

 Garden
 A garden, co-grown by Leo and me, although it generally seems like I
 end up doing most of the work. Currently the centrepiece of the garden
 is an easel of Leo's, which at the moment is ruthlessly engaged in
 crushing my violets, a very recent-looking painting of the pond to the
 east perched upon it. His porch is to the west, mine to the east.

>go east

 By the Pond
 The back yard ends here, terminating at the shore of a small, grey
 pond. The prospect of living so close to nature thrilled me when I
 bought the flat, but unfortunately it seems that as far as the local
 wildlife is concerned the pond is chiefly interesting as a mosquito
 paradise. From here I get a pleasant view of the old oak tree behind
 me and the grey pond before me. Running parallel to the fence that
 insulates us from the traffic is the back door to my flat, to the
 southwest, and the yard continues to the west.

>go southwest
 Don't even get me started on the damn slider. It's been swollen shut
 because of the heat for three days now, and I have to sit here and
 watch the garden wither until the weather improves.

 except for the pond painting.

 The pond waters ripple in a sudden breeze.

>enter painting
 I step gingerly into the art, closing my eyes just in time to avoid
 the blinding flash of light . . .

 By the Pond
 The pond is a much more mysterious place at sunrise, all grays and
 ripples and dappled twilight---I find myself wishing I had the time to
 simply stand and look. I can access the garden to the west, and the
 fence marking the edge of the property stretches along the southern
 perimeter of the pond. My kitchen lies to the southwest, inaccessible
 behind the sliding door.

>go southwest
 Don't even get me started on the damn slider. It's been swollen shut

>go west

 Garden
 I'd forgotten how different the garden looks in the early morning, all
 the trees leaning and the droplets all bedewed and whatnot. The canvas
 I recently came through is still here, so fresh the paint is still
 dripping in places. The porch lies west, the pond east.

>examine painting
 It's harder to make out in the half-light, but it looks to be of the
 pond due east of here, and it looks to be complete, or nearly so.
 Leo's done it up to be rather nicer than it really is, all shimmers
 and ripples as the sun rises over it, and even a small fox in the
 lower right hand corner, sipping the water. The paint is still
 dripping wet.

>turn diamond
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

>enter painting
 Bizarre, how casually I can do this. I walk clean into another world,
 not even pausing to look behind me after I arrive.

 By the Pond
 Again, my stomach lurches as the garden vanishes from under me and I
 find myself next to the pond. The surroundings darken subtly as the
 sun retreats slightly in the east. I take stock: I can go back into to
 the garden---again---to the west, and my worthless sliding door is to
 the southwest.

 I watch in silence as my former self heads west, into the garden.

>go west
 I pause a moment first, waiting for my former self to exit my line of
 vision. But, irritatingly, she doesn't: instead she wanders aimlessly
 around the back of the house for a bit, then the painting in the
 garden seems to spark her interest, and just as she is about to enter
 it, she suddenly turns and sees me.

 As she walks toward me with a curious, frightened look on her face, I
 realise that through my former self's inaction I've somehow managed to
 doom Leo. I idly wonder for a moment how on earth I thought this could
 ever possibly work out.

 The summit of the cabin is completely flat, which is unfortunate for

 clock through one particularly rotten hole in the roof---but I
 appreciate it now, and the roughness of the surface makes it easy to
 gain purchase. I can (reluctantly) step back into the rain to the
 north or west---everything else is rock and water.

 Reaching through the hole, I just manage to poke the topmost point of

 The ring has reappeared on my ringer.

 Hearing the loud snap that accompanies my entrance, Leo hurries into
 the room. "Did you find the key?"

 When I hold up the glass key, his face morphs into the happiest
 expression I have ever seen on a human face. "Irene!" he cries. "I . .
 . you . . . " and he pulls me into a fierce hug. After a few moments
 of this, I pull back, and his expression turns solemn. "And there's
 something I need to ask---"

 He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear
 Irene's voice floating up the stairs. "Leo?"

 He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
 "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the key from my
 hands and zips out to the south.

 I simply stand there for a moment, basking in the warm glow of my own
 accomplishment, when I realise with a surge of horror that both Irene
 and whatever weapon she used are still unaccounted for---in fact, she
 probably has the gun already. I have only a few minutes to act.

 Along the Beach
 The shore here is little more than an abbreviated stretch of sand,
 with the oncoming darkness and the height of the cliffs opposite
 combine to produce an oddly desolate effect. The tide itself is quite
 high up: water is beginning to engulf the trees, as well as the legs
 of a small easel planted in the sand. I can continue up the beach to
 the north, the dock extends over the water to the west, and to the
 south, situated dangerously close to the water, is a small cabin built
 perpendicular to the beach.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

 The sound dies down to a quiet string pulse, with some instrument I
 don't recognise beneath---another guitar, perhaps?

>go north
 As I walk, the sounds smoothen under a sudden wash of piano arpeggios.

 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the

 done up, though a bit austere in the furniture department. The walls
 here used to be completely covered in his paintings, but apparently
 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly
 bare.

 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a

 matching rainbows of subtly graduated colour, and the walls are

 Hallway
 A tiny, dank space beyond my decorative abilities to remedy. Leo's
 painting on the west wall is just sufficiently distracting so that one
 might not notice the total lack of windows, at least. The stairs down

 On the Roof
 The summit of the cabin is completely flat, which is unfortunate for
 the cabin on days with weather like this---I can see the grandfather
 clock through one particularly rotten hole in the roof---but I
 appreciate it now, and the roughness of the surface makes it easy to
 gain purchase. I can (reluctantly) step back into the rain to the
 north or west---everything else is rock and water.

>push pendulum
 Reaching through the hole, I just manage to poke the topmost point of
 the pendulum, arresting its motion. A now-familiar snapping sound
 assaults my ears, and I turn to find my surroundings reverted once
 more to black and white, with only the music box and the pendulum
 remaining unchanged.

>go north
 I make my way to the edge, and, after a ghastly moment of vertigo,
 step off the roof and into the web of rain.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south
 from here.

>go down
 I pick my way carefully through a web of frozen raindrops.

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 The sea and rain, arrested, wait silently. The cabin is back to the
 south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to the north.

>go south

 In the Cabin (in monochrome)
 An unsettling glittery light pervades this room, reflected through the
 doorway by the sea of raindrops outside. A cascade of water is stopped
 in midair, gushing through a gaping hole in the cabin's low ceiling,
 just above the grandfather clock. The desk with its music box sits
 opposite, and the exit is back to the north.

 Everything in the room has been bleached of colour except the music
 box and grandfather clock, whose pendulum shines like burnished gold.

>enter music box
 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different
 world.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 The ring has reappeared on my ringer.

 Hearing the loud snap that accompanies my entrance, Leo hurries into
 the room. "Did you find the key?"

 When I hold up the box, his face morphs into the happiest expression I
 have ever seen on a human face. "Irene!" he cries. "I . . . you . . .
 " and he pulls me into a fierce hug. After a few moments of this, I
 pull back, and his expression turns solemn. "And there's something I
 need to ask---"

 He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear
 Irene's voice floating up the stairs. "Leo?"

 He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
 "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the box from my
 hands and zips out to the south.

 I simply stand there for a moment, basking in the warm glow of my own
 accomplishment, when I realise with a surge of horror that both Irene
 and whatever weapon she used are still unaccounted for---in fact, she
 probably has the gun already. I have only a few minutes to act.

 This staircase is the mirror of mine except that his picture window

 Leo's picture window catches the sun going down instead of up, which I

 making the view rather inferior as well . . . but his flat still has
 that extra room, so I'd still trade if I got the chance.

 Garden (in monochrome)
 I'd forgotten how different the garden looks in the early morning, all

 On the easel is the pond painting.

>go east

 By the Pond (in monochrome)
 The pond is a much more mysterious place at sunrise, all grays and
 ripples and dappled twilight---I find myself wishing I had the time to
 simply stand and look. I can access the garden to the west, and the
 fence marking the edge of the property stretches along the southern
 perimeter of the pond. My kitchen lies to the southwest, inaccessible
 behind the sliding door.

>examine window

 Again, my stomach lurches as the garden vanishes from under me and I
 find myself next to the pond. The surroundings darken subtly as the

>go northeast

 Irene's Room (in monochrome)
 This bedroom seems like a room from another flat completely; at any
 rate it's free of Leo's cavalier paint-it-all approach to decor. The
 furniture is spartan to the point of ruthlessness, arranged to frame
 the gigantic four-poster waterbed. The overall effect is one of rather
 severe cleanliness; the painting of the young girl in the corner
 seeming to constitute the only exception to the rule. The front room
 is back to the southwest.

 On the easel is the painting of the young girl.

 On the waterbed is a page of looseleaf.

 The subject of the painting sighs, making me jump. She doesn't turn,
 though.

>enter painting
 I step lightly into the painting.

 Drawing Room
 A somewhat fussily decorated sitting room, all high-flung Queen Anne
 arches and artfully aged brick. Not far in front of me is Irene's
 older sister---Ivy, was it?---perhaps four years old, looking
 unnaturally posed in an uncomfortable-looking white gown and elaborate
 hat. Her father is some distance away, putting the last strokes on the
 painting. Outside, the snow falls.

 Ivy has turned and is looking directly at me. She says nothing.

>ask ivy about irene
 Before I can move, Ivy speaks. "Da? Look!"

 He does. Then he removes his pince-nez and watches me silently for a
 moment. He has Leo's eyes, I notice.

 Unwilling to say anything, I stand up and hand him the stone key (the
 same one that Leo took away from me before, surely? but there's no
 time for such thoughts now). Then I lean over to steal a glance at the
 painting---it is complete, exactly as it will be in seventy years but
 for the colours, which are slightly brighter. The real Ivy watches me
 intensely. Her father, meanwhile, is turning the ankh over and over in
 his hands. At last he looks up to stare at me bemusedly. "An
 interesting contraption, I must say. You are to be commended on your
 stealth. I do, however, insist on knowing how you came to be in my
 sitting room without the servants' knowledge. You shall have to
 explain yourself, madam."

 In spite of myself, I find myself smiling up at him inanely.

 Driveway (in monochrome)
 Here we have what feels like about two metres of clearance in front of
 the house before the driveway abruptly terminates in the motorway. At
 the moment all is fairly still---it's long before rush hour, but those
 cars that do go by seem to feel at liberty to go twice as fast.

 . . . Well, they don't right at this moment, since all the cars are
 frozen in place. One car seems to have stopped right next to the end
 of our driveway.

>examine car
 It's a grey Volkswagen, quite new-looking. The driver is a young
 woman, thirty perhaps. She's looking at the road ahead with a
 frighteningly intense stare---one of those early-morning commuters,
 doubtless---but her head is flung to the side as if she'd been
 interrupted in the process of tossing her hair back.

 A chill runs down my spine.

>examine woman
 Even without colour I it's obvious that the light tone of her hair
 isn't natural, although it's oddly lovely the way her hair streams out
 behind her in the wind. I think she must have been about to pass
 somebody; she's manoeuvred her vehicle between the lanes and is
 utterly focused on the road ahead of her.

 "Leo, do you understand that you have divulged a family secret? That
 this constitutes a betrayal of a confidence we have kept for nearly a

 Leo's tone grows irritated. "Irene, what makes you think I told her?
 Do you think she's blind? She must have known we were keeping
 something from her all these years." Pause. "Or perhaps you're in one
 of your moods today and nothing I say is going to make any difference?
 Because in that case I'm going to retrieve the rest of the keys."

 been spending far too much time on that beach, fondling your little
 box on the water."

 "Irene, give me that key. And give me that gun."

>wait

 Through the open window I can faintly make out Leo and Irene's voices:

 A long pause. I picture them at a standoff, coldly regarding each

 shout "Give it to me!", followed by a scuffling noise.

>wait
 Crack.

 A sudden, tremendous report that dies away, leaving a preternatural
 silence nearly as quiet as the ones induced by Leo's pocketwatch.

 Too long. I took too damn long.

 Abruptly, the door swings open, revealing Irene.

 "I hope you're happy!" she shouts, her voice loud enough to give me
 the queerest sense that she is addressing not me, but at someone
 directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
 she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
 staircase.

 We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
 descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
 find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.

 Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
 us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
 paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
 might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
 hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
 Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
 what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
 unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and
 call 9-9-9, quickly."

 Then she fires.

 "Wait a moment," says Leo, his voice suddenly strained. I follow his
 line of vision, realising that he has fixated on the diamond ring I
 found in his room. I watch interestedly as his face attempts to
 resolve itself into a single emotion. He seems to be about to say
 something when suddenly his gaze shifts to the stone key in my hand.
 "Dear God, Matilda. Where did you find this? Do you---wait, never

 silence nearly as quiet as the ones induced by Leo's pocketwatch.

 Too long. I took too damn long.

 Abruptly, the door swings open, revealing Irene.

 "I hope you're happy!" she shouts, her voice loud enough to give me
 the queerest sense that she is addressing not me, but at someone
 directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
 she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
 staircase.

 We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
 descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
 find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.

 Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
 us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
 paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
 might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
 hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
 Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
 what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
 unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and
 call 9-9-9, quickly."

 Then she fires.

 I reach for the diamond ring, but a sudden cry from Leo stops me.

 "Wait a moment," says Leo, his voice suddenly strained. I follow his
 line of vision, realising that he has fixated on the diamond ring I
 found in his room. I watch interestedly as his face attempts to
 resolve itself into a single emotion. He seems to be about to say
 something when suddenly his gaze shifts to the stone key in my hand.
 "Dear God, Matilda. Where did you find this? Do you---wait, never
 mind."

 Before I realise what's happening he has seized the key from my hand.
 I let out a shocked exclamation, but before I can object he has blazed
 off to the south.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Somewhat alarmingly, my front door stands wide open.

>go northeast

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
 Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
 paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
 stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 I hear a soft sound from the corner. Turning, I nearly jump out of my
 skin to see Irene standing at the bottom of the staircase, holding her
 hands clasped behind her back and staring at me in a peculiar way.

 "Well, hello, Matilda," she says. "I didn't think you were up yet."
 Her eyes flip back and forth from me to the staircase, confused.

>go west
 I can't exactly waltz right into the painting.

 "Listen," Irene says. Her voice is quick, intense, nothing like during
 our conversation on the bay. "I'm sorry to trespass on you like this.
 I came to see if Leo's been using you to hide things from me, and it
 turns out that he has." She gestures to the end table by the sofa.
 "Open the drawer there. I want you to see."

 A sick feeling develops in the pit of my stomach.

>turn ring
 Hang on; I'm intrigued by what Irene's saying.

 "An edge creeps into Irene's voice. "I know you're not listening to me
 because you're being told to do something else," she whispers. "I know
 you don't know I know, but I do. I'm not stupid. That stupid ring that
 you try to pretend isn't there. Whatever you're being told to do right
 now, you don't have to listen."

>examine painting
 It was a present from Leo a few years ago. He usually paints from
 life---he gets up before dawn every day and paints in all sorts of
 strange places---but I asked him to do one for me from his mind, and
 as far as I know it's the only imaginary landscape he's ever done. It
 depicts a waterfall so wide that it completely fills the sky, as seen
 from a promontory in the foreground that juts out over the water's
 edge.

 The nail that's holding this painting up appears to be coming loose. I
 make a mental note to fix that at some point.

 "Matilda. Whatever you're hearing, it isn't real. Stop it."

 I hesitate.

>go east
 For God's sake, give me a second first; I'm trying to listen.

 "Well?" she asks. "No reaction? This isn't some benign happening we
 can just ignore, you know. He's concealing it from me for a reason. I
 won't let you pretend it isn't there."

>examine irene
 I feel as though I've interrupted Irene while she was in the process
 of systematically searching my flat; she's hovering over an end table
 now and her of eyes are fixated right on me.

 "Just take it!" she cries, gesturing to the drawer. "Why does it gall
 you to pay attention to commands from a human being instead of some
 figment of your imagination?"

 And yet, I am unable to do anything. I simply stand there, on the
 verge of panic, torn between two forces, either of which would easily
 be strong enough to control me on its own.

>turn diamond
 Shut up a moment, will you? I'm sick of this.

 While I dither, I look up to see that an expression of horror has
 appeared on Irene's face---directed not at me, I suddenly realise, but
 behind me.

 "Leo," she gasps. Grabbing her cane from beside her, she twists
 something on her bracelet and vanishes. I blink, and suddenly Irene is
 on the other side of the kitchen window.

 My gaze moves to the drawer, then out the window. My stomach sinks.

>turn diamond
 I can't bring myself to do it. I run to the kitchen window . . .

 I hurry to look out the kitchen window, just in time to see Leo is
 standing in front of the painting in the garden, pocketwatch in hand.
 Irene is standing on the porch and has raised the gun on him; she
 seems to be speaking quietly. The window mutes their conversation, but
 I know enough about what's going to happen to realise that I can't be
 here when it finishes.

 I barely hear the gunshot. By the time my former self comes innocently
 down the stairs, about to answer her doorbell, I am already deep into
 the woods. Perhaps without my interference she'll be able to sort all
 this out better than I have.

 Dock's End
 It's much brighter here than last time---evening, rather than
 twilight, but nothing is moving, even the raindrops, and a bolt of
 lightning far off to the west gives a continuous eerie light to the
 horizon. The beach lies to the east, and the drops of water ascend
 into the sky as far as I can see.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

 Cold water trickles down the back of my neck.

>go east

 Along the Beach
 A thoroughly miserable spot, the tide gradually rising and threatening
 to engulf what little sand remains. A soaked-looking cabin lies to the
 south---padlocked shut again, of course--- and the beach continues to
 the north.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

 A piercingly loud snapping sound comes from upstairs.

>go south
 Using the old bronze key, I unlock the cabin door.

 Once more, the padlock springs open, executing a graceful parabola and
 landing in the water.

 I open the cabin door.

 In the Cabin
 An even worse mess than last time I was here. The music box stands
 open, playing a familiar lilting tune, and a fat stream of water is
 gushing into the cabin through the hole in the roof, then soaking out
 through the floor. All in all, a fairly miserable studio. On the
 opposite side of the room, placed, I now realise, as far as possible
 from the corner with the hole, are the desk and hammock, and the exit
 is to the north.

 Outside, the storm continues its tantrum.

>push pendulum
 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A
 now-familiar snapping sound assaults my ears, and I turn to find my
 surroundings reverted once more to black and white, with only the
 music box and the pendulum remaining unchanged.

>enter music box
 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different
 world.

 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 The ring has reappeared on my ringer.

 Hearing the loud snap that accompanies my entrance, Leo hurries into
 the room. "Did you find the key?"

 Then he sees my expression, and his face falls. I put a hand on his
 arm, not quite sure what to say. His hands begin to shake.

 "I don't know what to do," he says. "The gallery is all I had---it's
 everything I've worked for, since I was eighteen---"

 He pauses, taking a deep breath. "Listen. You can stay here if you
 want to---I'm going to---I have to be alone for a second." And he
 takes his pocketwatch off the shelf and walks out, leaving me alone in
 the blank room.

 I am on the point of calling after him, of making some speech to
 reassure him---but just as quickly I realise how futile this would be,
 and slump to the floor, feeling utterly lost. Where did I go wrong?

 I am hardly surprised when, after a few moments, Leo appears at the
 back window. A moment later, Irene appears on the porch, gun in hand.
 Their conversation is muted by the glass, which I am grateful for. In
 the end, it turns out, I am just as helpless as the Matilda who is
 sleeping innocently in her bedroom, except she isn't responsible for
 what is about to happen, but I am. But you are. After a moment, Irene
 raises the pistol on Leo. I close my eyes.

 The sound of the gunshot carries clearly through the glass, as does, a
 few minutes later, the sound of my doorbell ringing.

 A familiar snapping sound comes from the hallway.

 Cliff's Edge
 I am momentarily disoriented as my head fills with the roar of water.
 I open my eyes to mist, positioned by a cliff which comes to a point
 some distance ahead of me. The vista beyond the cliff is dominated by
 the waterfall, unnaturally close behind, so near that it's utterly
 impossible to see anything beyond it. Up at the far edge is Leo,
 leaning dangerously over the falls.

 "Leo!" I shout. But of course he can't hear me with the water as loud
 as it is. He's drawn these falls from his imagination, and they are
 far larger than anything I can conceive of in the real world, the
 water falling from a point far above our heads, and dissolving into
 mist far below, the cloud of mist so large it becomes impossible to
 see anything in the distance---there is only water, me, Leo and a line
 of small yellow flowers that seems to be thriving in the mist off the
 falls.

 I begin running toward him. "Leo! Wait for me!" But my voice seems to
 be unable to carry. And, then, suddenly, a bell rings overhead. I
 continue to run, the motion slower and slower, but now I am perplexed.
 As it rings again, I am hit by a rush of utter horror.

 "Oh, no," I say dizzily. "No, no, no . . ." but the world is already
 dissolving into white, and through the whiteness the mist is already
 coalescing into the shape of my bedroom . . .

 Leo's gallery key off the cabin roof, in that order.

 I also have no more than a few minutes to take action before something
 dire happens in my living room.

 The colours continue to merge and divide in rhythm with the sounds of
 the ocean.

>think
 Well, if I were to sum it up, I'd say that since I went back in time,
 I've managed to encounter Leo in his kitchen, run into Leo again
 upstairs, travel to the beach in search of the gallery key, and get
 Leo's gallery key off the cabin roof, in that order.

 I also have no more than a few minutes to take action before something

>hint
 The final sequence has been triggered, and you have five turns to
 start saving Irene if you haven't already. Stopping time will make
 your job a great deal easier, but note that it's already too late to
 catch Irene alone, since she's with Leo now. Luckily, you've dealt
 with this problem once already.

>go down
 I can't go that way.

>go south

 Upstairs (in monochrome)
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching spectrums of subtly graduated grey, and the walls are covered
 with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the west,
 the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

>go down

 Staircase (in monochrome)
 This staircase is the mirror of mine except that his picture window
 looks out on the neighbours' rooftops. I can continue up or down.

>go down

 Front Room (in monochrome)
 In the early-morning darkness this room isn't quite as inviting as it
 was earlier. The major geography, however, is unchanged: kitchen to
 the north, Irene's room to the northeast, stairs to the west, and the
 foyer to the southeast.

 Through the door to the southeast comes the murmur of voices, not

 Foyer (in monochrome)
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

>examine doorbell
 The doorbell really isn't enjoying my particular favour at the moment.

>turn diamond
 Snap: colours.

 Leo and Irene's voices are clearly audible through the door:

 There's a silence before Leo says, "Irene, I don't know why you're
 acting this way. Please, put that down; it's making me nervous."

 "Leo, do you understand that you have divulged a family secret? That
 this constitutes a betrayal of a confidence we have kept for nearly a
 century?"

 Leo's tone grows irritated. "Irene, what makes you think I told her?
 Do you think she's blind? She must have known we were keeping
 something from her all these years." Pause. "Or perhaps you're in one
 of your moods today and nothing I say is going to make any difference?
 Because in that case I'm going to retrieve the rest of the keys."

 "Yes, well, by all means do so. Given you can find them."

>ring doorbell
 An obscenely perky chiming from above the door. I shudder.

 Leo and Irene's voices are clearly audible through the door:

 A brief silence. "What do you mean?"

 I hear the jingle of a key. "I've padlocked the cabin, Leo. You've
 been spending far too much time on that beach, fondling your little
 box on the water."

 "Irene, give me that key. And give me that gun."

>ring doorbell
 An obscenely perky chiming from above the door. I shudder.

 Leo and Irene's voices are clearly audible through the door:

 A long pause. I picture them at a standoff, coldly regarding each
 other from opposite sides of the room. And then I hear Leo's voice
 shout "Give it to me!", followed by a scuffling noise.

>open my front door
 Slowly, I creak the door open. I don't expect them to hear me with
 their argument in full swing, and the bullet to my hip comes as
 something of a shock.

 As the room begins to swim, I wonder idly if anyone will think to call
 Emergency.

 It's been a bad night. I think I finally struggled into sleep at
 something like half-past two, and since then it's been more or less a
 continuous string of nightmares. Time and again I dream of Leo,
 standing at the end of a distant cliff, peering down over the edge. I
 run towards him, shouting at random, trying to warn him---willing to
 say anything, so long as it reaches his ears. But inevitably, just as
 I am near enough for him to hear my voice, a bell sounds from
 somewhere above us, and he doesn't turn. And then suddenly he is gone
 over the cliff's edge, and the entire world is going white, nothing
 remaining but me, the cliff, and the sound of the bell ringing, and
 ringing, and ringing . . .

 Bedroom (on the bed)
 I awake with a start, and after a half-second of pure "Where the hell
 am I," place myself in my bedroom. I've no idea what time it is---at
 least the sun's up---but the pounding in my head suggests that it's
 several hours earlier than anyone with any sense ought to rise. The
 door to the hallway lies to the south, and windows border the other
 three sides of the room.

 The doorbell is ringing downstairs. Bloody hell.

>look
 Leo's Kitchen
 The setup here is even more minimalist than in the front room---no
 table, even. The door out to his back porch is northwest, and the
 front room is south.

 Leo stands here, looking healthy but frazzled.

 "Wait a moment," says Leo, his voice suddenly strained. I follow his
 line of vision, realising that he has fixated on the diamond ring I
 found in his room. I watch interestedly as his face attempts to
 resolve itself into a single emotion. He seems to be about to say
 something when suddenly his gaze shifts to the stone key in my hand.
 "Dear God, Matilda. Where did you find this? Do you---wait, never
 mind."

 Before I realise what's happening he has seized the key from my hand.
 I let out a shocked exclamation, but before I can object he has blazed
 off to the south.

>turn diamond
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

>look
 In the Cabin
 Leo's studio is an utter shambles. The ceiling is alarmingly low and
 pockmarked with holes, the hammock strung across the rear of the room
 is all tangled up in itself, and the writing-desk beside it is
 completely covered in debris. On the desk is an empty spindle, and
 across from it stands a tranquilly ticking grandfather clock. The door
 back outside lies to the north.

 The oboe fades, the clarinet dimming as it echoes its melody.

>hold pendulum
 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A
 now-familiar snapping sound assaults my ears, and I turn to find my
 surroundings reverted once more to black and white, with only the
 music box and the pendulum remaining unchanged.

 The woodwinds cadence as the strings fall to the bottom of their
 registers. Distantly, the percussion rumbles.

 The western horizon has gone entirely black; the stars twinkle near
 the half-moon.

>enter box
 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different
 world.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

>go south

 Upstairs
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching rainbows of subtly graduated colour, and the walls are
 covered with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the
 west, the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

>go down

 Front Room
 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the
 number of times I've been in this room on one hand. It's attractively
 done up, though a bit austere in the furniture department. The walls
 here used to be completely covered in his paintings, but apparently
 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly
 bare.

 The stairs up are to the west, the kitchen north, and a locked door
 which I assume leads to Irene's room northeast. The foyer lies back to
 the southeast.

>go southwest
 I can't go that way.

>se

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

>go northeast

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic. The
 walls are now entirely bare, the waterfall painting scattered over the
 floor as it is. The front door lies to the southwest. The stairs up to
 the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 My waterfall painting lies ruined on the floor.

>go east
 I wind my way up to the landing.

 Staircase
 This is the landing of the stairwell, which makes a broad 180-degree
 turn between upstairs and downstairs.  A wide shaft of morning
 sunlight streams in through the picture window which makes up most of
 the eastern wall, and the staircases lie to the west.

>go up

 Hallway
 A tiny, dank space beyond my decorative abilities to remedy. Leo's
 painting on the west wall is just sufficiently distracting so that one
 might not notice the total lack of windows, at least. The stairs down
 lie to the east, my bedroom is north, and the toilet is southwest.

>inventory
 It seems that I'm carrying:
   a diamond ring (being worn)
   an ankh-shaped key
   a pocketwatch
   a key ring
     an amber key (which opens Leo's kitchen door)
     a ruby key (which opens Leo's bedroom door)
     a sapphire key (which opens Leo's toilet door)
     a jade key (which opens Leo's back door)
     another brass key
   some papers
   a tiny copper key (which opens the padlock)
   an old bronze key (which opens Leo's bayside cabin)
   my house key

>unlock toilet
 Not to seem disparaging, but the toilet is a room to the southwest,
 not an actual object in my hallway. One would almost think you
 American.

>unlock toilet door
 I don't see any such thing.

>push button
 The familiar snapping sound, and the world goes black and white,
 except for the garden painting.

>enter painting
 I step gingerly into the art, closing my eyes just in time to avoid
 the blinding flash of light . . .

 Sky Pavilion
 There's a sheer precipice just north of this pavilion, and the
 panoramic view of the city and the river has always been to our city
 what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. No tourists here today, though; the
 garden must not be open yet. The pavilion, its entrance formed by two
 towering redwoods, arcs over my head, and the path down to the main
 part of the gardens is south.

>examine precipice
 A melange of skyscrapers and noise and bustle, soaring ostentatiously
 into the sky. I've never loved the city the way Leo does, but viewing
 it from afar like this, I have to concede its impressiveness, if not
 its beauty.

>examine pavilion
 The arch constituting the entrance to each pavilion is formed entirely
 of vines and trees, intertwined in some odd way that my eye can't
 follow. At the far end of each, the hedge wall opens, allowing a view
 of the city's skyline.

>go south

 Centre Garden
 Many of the branches here are covered in a crystal-fine layer of ice,
 the drops are rolling off them as the sunlight hits the upper
 branches.  Walkways lead off to the north, southeast, and southwest,
 and the garden entrance is to the south.

>se

 Earth Pavilion
 This area is the only one that's received any sunlight yet this
 morning. The ice has mostly melted here, and the petals on the rose
 trees, perhaps encouraged by the frost, are cascading down in a
 continuous shower. The rest of the pavilion is covered by all manner
 of overgrown early spring blooms, and trees that have somehow managed
 to be in flower this early in the year. The only exit is back to the
 northwest.

>turn diamond
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

>climb petals
 Carefully, I put my hand around one of the petals, then clamber my way
 up, slowly but surely.

 Up a Tree (in monochrome)
 I pause in the middle of the sea of petals, resting on a branch. The
 petals thin out here, deep among the branches, and the spring blooms
 of a hundred species of plants surround me.

 I can see a bird's nest here.

>put ankh in nest
 Time was when I would gad about dropping keys wherever the fancy
 struck me, but it's not until your short-term memory starts to go that
 you realise what a bad idea it is.

>take nest
 No point in depriving some poor bird of its home.

 starting to realise that I'd probably better hang on to it.

 Earth Pavilion (in monochrome)
 This area is the only one that's received any sunlight yet this
 morning. The ice has mostly melted here, and the petals on the rose
 trees are frozen in midair, forming a labryrinth of petals. The rest
 of the pavilion is covered by all manner of overgrown early spring
 blooms, and trees that have somehow managed to be in flower this early
 in the year. The only exit is back to the northwest.

>go northwest

 Centre Garden (in monochrome)
 Many of the branches here are covered in a crystal-fine layer of ice,
 the drops frozen in mid-fall as the sunlight hits the upper branches.
 Walkways lead off to the north, southeast, and southwest, and the
 garden entrance is to the south.

>examine drops
 I don't see any such thing.

>go southwest

 Sea Pavilion (in monochrome)
 The river runs immediately outside the hedge here, which is cut into a
 window to reveal it roaring past. The main feature of this area is of
 course the fountains, which rise from everywhere, their waters tinted
 by the plants living in each. It's all very self-consciously
 beautiful, of course, but I can't deny that it pleases even me. The
 path itself winds slowly between them, meandering back around to the
 northeast.

>examine fountains
 Carved stone, fashioned into shapes of plants, with the waters which
 until a moment ago were running every colour I can imagine. Many are
 still crusted with ice from the frost, and real plants grow around and
 into them in rather surreal ways, in some cases the waterfalls frozen
 mid-flow. In several places full-grown trees erupt from the water,
 their leaves merging with their reflections. Right now the scene is
 like an old photograph, all the colours lost in shades of grey, and
 everything completely, oppressively silent.

>go northeast

 Centre Garden (in monochrome)
 Many of the branches here are covered in a crystal-fine layer of ice,

 Walkways lead off to the north, southeast, and southwest, and the

>go south

 Pagoda (in monochrome)
 This entrance pavilion is the only man-made thing within the walls of
 the Peace Gardens, but it blends well enough so that it's difficult to
 notice. From a zenith straight overhead, the structure arches down to
 the hedge, terminating in the iron entrance gate to the south. To the
 north is the path leading back into the gardens proper.

 An ornate, rather cumbersome-looking stone key fashioned into the

>unlock door with ruby key
 That doesn't seem to fit the lock.

>unlock door with my key
 (an ankh-shaped key)
 Confidently, I slip the key into the lock and stride forward into pure
 alabaster.

 Whiteness
 Again, the endless white in every direction. The only feature of this
 place seems to be the door I came in through.

>examine door
 A plain, white door with a shiny white doorknob and accompanying
 keyhole.

>look through keyhole
 I don't find anything of interest.

>open door
 I've got quite a little collection of keys going here; you'll have to
 specify which I ought to try.

>unlock door with ankh
 At first I think it's going to fit, but the key turns out to be far
 too large for the lock.

>unlock door with brass key
 There is a satisfying snap as the key turns in the lock, and as soon
 as I withdraw the key the door flies open with an ostentatious flash
 of light. Feeling profoundly nervous, I walk through to the other
 side.

 Front Room
 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the

 Irene's Room
 This bedroom seems like a room from another flat completely; at any
 rate it's free of Leo's cavalier paint-it-all approach to decor. The
 furniture is spartan to the point of ruthlessness, arranged to frame
 the gigantic four-poster waterbed. The overall effect is one of rather
 severe cleanliness; the painting of the young girl in the corner
 seeming to constitute the only exception to the rule. The front room
 is back to the southwest.

 Without waiting for further instructions, I stand and walk out of
 Irene's room. After a moment I find myself doing a little spin, right
 in the middle of Leo's front room, relishing my sudden and complete
 freedom of motion. And then I start walking as fast as I can towards
 the exit, towards anywhere in the world that is not this house.

 By the time I reach the front door, you have faded completely.

 The Primrose Path uses a couple of verbs not found in every game; one
 of these that you might find useful is CONTEMPLATE (or THINK ABOUT, or
 REMEMBER), which will give you background information on a number of
 things the protagonist is already familiar with.

 If you're conversing with a character who happens to be the only other
 person in the room with you, ASK or TELL JANE ABOUT MONSTER and so on
 can be abbreviated to A or T MONSTER.

 If you're new to interactive fiction, you might find it helpful to
 type INSTRUCTIONS. In-game gentle nudges can be accessed with the
 THINK command. Also available are CREDITS, HINTS, and a full list of
 ABBREVIATIONS.

 Bug reports, questions, comments, and the like are welcomed at

 They mean---they meant---a great deal to me. Every day, on lunch

>c irene
 Irene is Leo's mother; she's only been my neighbour for the last three
 or four years, since she ceased to be capable of living on her own.
 It's hard to deny she's rather senile at this point, and perhaps a bit
 paranoid . . . but a murderess? Surely not.

>c leo
 Leo's my next-door neighbour; he moved into the building perhaps a
 dozen years ago. What a frightening thought---I'm pretty sure that
 when we met, I was younger than he is now. Our relationship has been
 everywhere from icy hostility to unabashed longing (on both of our
 parts, at different times, naturally), and every emotion in between.
 It stabilised at "good friends" around the time his mother moved in
 with us, and has remained steadfast since.

>c gun
 I think Leo does own a pistol---or did, at least, some years ago. It
 was a Great War relic, belonging to his grandfather. I remember he
 used to try to tell me about its illustrious history, and I'd have to
 shout at him to stop; I hated the thing. I knew someday he'd be
 cleaning it and, whoops, it'd just happen to be loaded and then bang.
 It never happened, but I still can't stand the sight of it.

>c ring
 It was last winter, I think right before Christmas. That's never a
 good time of year for me, which I think had more to do with my
 reaction than I thought at the time. Also, Leo took me by surprise;
 never a good idea. We were sitting in my living room, just as always,
 and was saying something about how he'd tried answering someone's
 personal advertisement in the paper and it had gone flamingly badly;
 he was upset because the woman thought he'd misrepresented his age.
 Fairly standard Leo existential angst, in fact.

 "I used to want to go as long as possible without settling down," he
 finished, "because from what I could see most people in relationships
 spent half their time wanting out; I didn't realise that once I was
 permanently single I'd be spending most of my time wanting in."

 "I've already decided to be an old spinster," I said. "For the common
 good, really. Someone needs to break down the stereotype that we're
 all genteel, ancient ladies with thousands of cats."

 "You don't need to put such a bright face on it," he said. "Not with
 me. You must be so lonely."

 On any other day I would have been furious with this bit of
 effrontery, but on this particular day as it happens he wasn't so far
 off. "Sometimes."

 "More than that."

 "Sometimes," I said firmly.

 "More than sometimes. For me, anyway. What's the good of voluntarily
 staying on your own when are people out there who'd be willing to link
 their lives with yours, if only you'd ask? There's not enough time
 left to justify wasting any of it away longing out windows."

 "That's true," I said, and in truth it was exactly what I'd been
 thinking earlier that afternoon. "But if the right person doesn't
 come, he doesn't come."

 "Will you marry me?"

 I was shocked, even though in retrospect he must have had this entire
 conversation mapped out in advance. But more than that I was repulsed
 that he would act like this was such a casual act, arising from
 convenience, or better yet from jealousy, fear that I might default to
 someone else. And the fact that he had the ring all ready made it ten
 thousand times worse. Did he really think it would be that easy? He
 must have bought it on his way back from his disastrous little date, a
 thousand-pound ego boost in a little box. Pathetic, really. But at the
 time I felt nothing but fury.

 "Put that away, Leo."

 "Listen a second before you decide: this ring---"

 My voice did not break, I'm relieved to say. Instead I stood up and
 said, "You'd better go."

 He did, and it was a week before we were able to speak to each other
 again.

>c epidemic
 I remember the first night of quarantine, when we were holed up here
 for a week, the day after the gardens were burned. Leo and I were
 sitting in his front room---his painting of the peace gardens was
 hanging on the wall there at that point---we stared at this artwork
 for most of the evening. "How can they have done this?" I said,
 several times. "How can our elected officials so depraved as to
 destroy a work of art that belongs to half a million people?"

 "It's for the greater good, Matilda. Gardens can be rebuilt. We're
 alive. We're healthy. Besides, we still have the painting."

 "If you burn the gardens, quarantine or not, you're destroying the
 soul of the city."

 "That's silly, Matilda. Cities are soulless to begin with; it's only
 the people who matter. All you're saying is that you won't be content
 until you have a city where everyone is educated, affluent, happy,
 safe, and healthy."

 "Don't mock me. You find me stupidly idealistic to ask for our
 government to stop committing arson upon our own cities? Maybe it is
 possible for everyone to be educated, healthy . . . all five."

 "Will we?" He paused for a moment. "What if you had to choose four out
 of five? Or what if the entire city could be all those things, at the
 expense of a one person who had to undergo unimaginable tortures?
 Would you live there?"

 "Of course not."

 "Really?" He leaned back in his chair. "I would."

 "You wouldn't," I replied. "The idea just appeals to your sense of
 irony."

 "Well, for 499,999 people there would be no difference."

 I lost my patience then. "Leo, that's idiotic; of course there's a
 difference. What if you were the one person who had to die?"

 He shrugged. "Tough luck, I suppose."

 I stared at the flowers in the painting, and had a bad taste in my
 mouth the rest of the evening.

>c gallery
 What, all of them at once? I haven't seen Leo's oeuvre all in one
 place for a year or two, but it's a pretty diverse collection,
 especially considering that they're all painted from life save one.
 I've always thought reality was pass? in art these days, but
 apparently that's not a universal opinion.

>c cane
 I've no particular memories associated with that.

>c watch
 It used to embarrass me that Leo wore an old-fashioned open-faced
 pocketwatch everywhere he went---it seemed unbearably pretentious,
 like he were pretending at being some sort of old-time rail conductor.
 I've grown used to it, though; I think it holds genuine meaning for
 him, rather than being the affectation I always took it for. I've
 always wondered if perhaps it held some kind of symbolic fascination
 for him---unlikely, I know, in such a thoroughly practical man, but I
 can come up with no other explanation for his carting it about with
 him everywhere.

 Happy birthday to me. Celebrated by springing for doors with locks for
 every room in the flat---an enormous pain to install, but I console
 myself thinking of how much easier it'll be to go back and forth with
 the master key when I'm working.

 Along with this journal, an amazing new sable paintbrush from Matilda.
 Perhaps Irene told her I was looking for a new one, but I would never
 have thought to get anything of this quality for myself.

 Should write this down for reference: have been messing about with
 some of the paintings in the gallery. I realise this ought to be
 dangerous, but as far as I can tell, there's no potential for things
 to go really wrong. If I go back and change something, time proceeds
 forward from that moment without regard to how the future was supposed
 to play out. Was looking forward to causing paradoxes galore, but
 apparently not.

 Frankly, would rather be painting than dabbling in metaphysics, but
 there's really no other way to spend the time when it's too cold to
 paint.

>read feb

 I hate not being able to paint outdoors. Inevitably I find myself
 trudging through the gallery, wondering which paintings I might be
 able to get away with entering. But if every painting that hasn't been
 entered before will take me to the time and place it was painted, it
 means that unless I were especially stealthy I'd end up running into
 my former self as he was finishing up the work in question.  But it's
 frustrating looking back on a particularly happy work and knowing
 that, however much I long to go in, I'll always be too cautious to
 actually attempt it.

 Irene calling. Another night commiserating by candlelight.

 I've lost the master key. Was in the city finishing up with the garden
 painting this morning . . . I thought I heard a guard coming; grabbed
 the painting and ran, only to realise I'd dropped the key somewhere.
 By the time I got back, the gardens were open and the key was long
 gone. Had to walk home with the painting. Should probably be more
 philosophical about it, but in fact I don't think I've ever been
 angrier.

 Can't believe the entire gallery is lost.  All the paintings are
 inaccessible now except the one in my flat, the one I gave to Matilda,
 and the one I was working on this morning. Thank God I never got
 around to putting that one back in the gallery!

 All I can think, over and over, is Life's work. Inaccessible forever.
 Life's work. Forever.

 Quarantined in the house; they estimate we'll be able to leave the
 neighbourhood next week.  Heard on the wireless this morning that the
 gardens have gone up in flames: arson, they're saying, or looters.

 I spent all day today staring at the painting I finished in the
 gardens, but I'm afraid of what could happen if I actually used it. I
 could have lost the key anytime that morning, and if I couldn't find
 it I'd have no way to get back here.

 Damn it. Will give the painting to Matilda---she'll appreciate it and
 I won't have to think about it anymore.

 I think Irene knows where I've hidden the gun; I caught her sneaking
 around in Matilda's flat very early this morning. I haven't told
 either of them that I saw her, but Matilda might do well to lock her
 front door at night.

 At this point it serves me right even if she does find it. Helped
 Matilda hang the peace gardens painting upstairs in her flat, then
 gave the gallery key to Irene and told her to keep it safe somewhere
 where I'd never have to look at it again---it's useless now.

 I can't take this anymore. I've almost finished a new painting in the

 Front Room
 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the
 number of times I've been in this room on one hand. It's attractively
 done up, though a bit austere in the furniture department. The walls
 here used to be completely covered in his paintings, but apparently
 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly
 bare.

 The stairs up are to the west, the kitchen north, and a locked door
 which I assume leads to Irene's room northeast. The foyer lies back to
 the southeast.

>go north

 Leo's Kitchen
 The setup here is even more minimalist than in the front room---no
 table, even. The door out to his back porch is northwest, and the
 front room is south.

>go northwest
 I stick Leo's key in the lock; it turns normally, but the door doesn't
 budge. I guess the lock mechanism must be broken.

>unlock door with stone key
 Confidently, I slip the key into the lock and stride forward into pure
 alabaster.

 Whiteness
 Again, the endless white in every direction. The only feature of this
 place seems to be the door I came in through.

>unlock door with jade key
 There is a satisfying snap as the key turns in the lock, and as soon
 as I withdraw the key the door flies open with an ostentatious flash
 of light. Feeling profoundly nervous, I walk through to the other
 side.

 Porch
 Leo built this porch himself, five or six years ago, ruining the
 building's symmetricality and making me quite rabidly jealous. His
 kitchen is accessible to the southeast, and our garden is east.

 Garden
 A garden, co-grown by Leo and me, although it generally seems like I
 end up doing most of the work. Currently the centrepiece of the garden
 is an easel of Leo's, which at the moment is ruthlessly engaged in
 crushing my violets, a very recent-looking painting of the pond to the
 east perched upon it. His porch is to the west, mine to the east.

 By the Pond
 The pond is a much more mysterious place at sunrise, all grays and
 ripples and dappled twilight---I find myself wishing I had the time to
 simply stand and look. I can access the garden to the west, and the
 fence marking the edge of the property stretches along the southern
 perimeter of the pond. My kitchen lies to the southwest, inaccessible
 behind the sliding door.

 Garden
 I'd forgotten how different the garden looks in the early morning, all

 dripping in places. The porch lies west, the pond east.

>wait
 Half a minute or so goes by.

>go west

 Porch
 Leo's porch is decidedly less congenial in the dark. There's not
 enough light inside to make out what's happening in Leo's kitchen, to
 the southeast, and even the gardens just east of here are shrouded in
 shadow.

>wait
 Half a minute or so goes by.

 A sudden noise: I turn. Leo has emerged from the house onto the porch,
 the pocketwatch in his hand. I retreat into the shadows; he doesn't
 see me.

>wait
 Half a minute or so goes by.

 Irene emerges stealthily from the open slider, a gun clutched in her
 right hand. Leo hasn't seen her; he's busily contemplating the new
 painting in the garden, pocketwatch in hand.

 "Don't move!" shouts Irene. I freeze, but she hasn't seen me; she
 raises the gun on Leo instead. "I know what you're thinking, Leo, and
 you can't do it. That's our rule, remember? No recursions. No loops."
 Her voice is steady.

 The look on Leo's face isn't the horror I expect---in fact, he looks
 guilty. "All right, Irene, I'm sorry. Just put the gun down, all
 right?"

 "You still want to go, don't you, Leo? Don't go." There is a brief
 moment of utter silence, the tension so high I can taste it.

>turn ring
 Utter fear paralyses me. I've dawdled for so long and the crisis point
 is so close that I can no longer bring myself to intervene.

 Abruptly, Leo turns and rushes directly at Irene, reaching for the
 gun. She gasps, and her hand tightens.

 There is a tremendous report. I squeeze my eyes shut against Leo's
 scream, and when I open them both he and Irene have vanished. I sit,
 paralyzed. Perhaps for the better, I realise . . . if I don't
 interfere any more, perhaps my former self will be able to do better
 than I could.

 The doorbell in the house begins to ring. I wait alone, shivering,
 enraged at having been allowed to stand idly by, inches away, as my
 oldest friend is shot.

 In the Cabin
 Leo's studio is an utter shambles. The ceiling is alarmingly low and
 pockmarked with holes, the hammock strung across the rear of the room
 is all tangled up in itself, and the writing-desk beside it is
 completely covered in debris. On the desk is an empty spindle, and
 across from it stands a tranquilly ticking grandfather clock. The door
 back outside lies to the north.

 The oboe fades, the clarinet dimming as it echoes its melody.

>touch pendulum
 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A
 now-familiar snapping sound assaults my ears, and I turn to find my
 surroundings reverted once more to black and white, with only the
 music box and the pendulum remaining unchanged.

 The woodwinds cadence as the strings fall to the bottom of their
 registers. Distantly, the percussion rumbles.

 The western horizon has gone entirely black; the stars twinkle near
 the half-moon.

>enter music box
 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still

 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare

 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

>touch pendulum
 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A
 now-familiar snapping sound assaults my ears, and I turn to find my
 surroundings reverted once more to black and white, with only the
 music box and the pendulum remaining unchanged.

 The oboe fades, the clarinet dimming as it echoes its melody.

>enter box
 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different
 world.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

>unlock door with ankh
 Confidently, I slip the key into the lock and stride forward into pure
 alabaster.

 Whiteness
 Again, the endless white in every direction. The only feature of this
 place seems to be the door I came in through.

>unlock door with jade
 There is a satisfying snap as the key turns in the lock, and as soon
 as I withdraw the key the door flies open with an ostentatious flash
 of light. Feeling profoundly nervous, I walk through to the other
 side.

 Porch
 Leo built this porch himself, five or six years ago, ruining the
 building's symmetricality and making me quite rabidly jealous. His
 kitchen is accessible to the southeast, and our garden is east.

>go east

 Garden
 A garden, co-grown by Leo and me, although it generally seems like I
 end up doing most of the work. Currently the centrepiece of the garden
 is an easel of Leo's, which at the moment is ruthlessly engaged in
 crushing my violets, a very recent-looking painting of the pond to the
 east perched upon it. His porch is to the west, mine to the east.

>turn diamond
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

 A cricket chirp from the painting, then a bird call in response.

>enter painting
 I step gingerly into the art, closing my eyes just in time to avoid
 the blinding flash of light . . .

 By the Pond
 The pond is a much more mysterious place at sunrise, all grays and
 ripples and dappled twilight---I find myself wishing I had the time to
 simply stand and look. I can access the garden to the west, and the
 fence marking the edge of the property stretches along the southern
 perimeter of the pond. My kitchen lies to the southwest, inaccessible
 behind the sliding door.

>go west

 Garden
 I'd forgotten how different the garden looks in the early morning, all
 the trees leaning and the droplets all bedewed and whatnot. The canvas
 I recently came through is still here, so fresh the paint is still
 dripping in places. The porch lies west, the pond east.

>go west

 Porch
 Leo's porch is decidedly less congenial in the dark. There's not
 enough light inside to make out what's happening in Leo's kitchen, to
 the southeast, and even the gardens just east of here are shrouded in
 shadow.

>go southwest
 If you're suggesting I hop the fence, forget it; it comes fully up to
 my chest.

>se
 I try to peek inside, but even this early the light is bright enough
 to make that impractical.  I cautiously squeak the slider open. I take
 a single step inside . . .

 . . . and abruptly find myself face to face with an astonished Leo.

>wait
 I say nothing.

 "Wait a moment," says Leo, his voice suddenly strained. I follow his
 line of vision, realising that he has fixated on the pocketwatch I
 found in the living room. I watch interestedly as his face attempts to
 resolve itself into a single emotion. He seems to be about to say
 something when suddenly his gaze shifts to the stone key in my hand.
 "Dear God, Matilda. Where did you find this? Do you---wait, never
 mind."

 Before I realise what's happening he has seized the key from my hand.
 I let out a shocked exclamation, but before I can object he has blazed
 off to the south.

>push button
 The familiar snapping sound, and the world goes black and white.

>go south

 Front Room (in monochrome)
 In the early-morning darkness this room isn't quite as inviting as it
 was earlier. The major geography, however, is unchanged: kitchen to
 the north, Irene's room to the northeast, stairs to the west, and the
 foyer to the southeast.

>go up

 Staircase (in monochrome)
 This staircase is the mirror of mine except that his picture window
 looks out on the neighbours' rooftops. I can continue up or down.

 Leo is frozen here, eyes locked on the middle distance.

>take ankh
 It won't move. It's like trying to manipulate solid rock.

>go up

 Upstairs (in monochrome)
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching spectrums of subtly graduated grey, and the walls are covered
 with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the west,
 the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

>c leo
 Leo's my next-door neighbour; he moved into the building perhaps a
 dozen years ago. What a frightening thought---I'm pretty sure that
 when we met, I was younger than he is now. Our relationship has been
 everywhere from icy hostility to unabashed longing (on both of our
 parts, at different times, naturally), and every emotion in between.
 It stabilised at "good friends" around the time his mother moved in
 with us, and has remained steadfast since.

>go north
 It won't move. It's like trying to manipulate solid rock.

>push button
 I click the button. Normality resumes.

 A piercingly loud snapping sound comes from the north.

>open door

>leo's door

>open leo's bedroom door

>go north
 I open Leo's bedroom door.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 On the shelf is a diamond ring.

 A familiar snapping sound comes from the hallway.

 From nearby comes the sound of someone pounding up the stairs.

>take diamond ring
 I only understood you as far as wanting me to take the setting.

>take all from shelf
 (the diamond ring from the shelf)
 Taken, damn you.

 "What I really don't understand," Leo continues,  "and you don't have
 to explain if you'd rather not---is how you got the diamond ring and
 the pocketwatch. I'd recognise it anywhere, but it can't be mine,
 because I've got it right here." He waves his own, snapping it on and
 off a few times for good measure. "I can only imagine Irene must have
 given it to you, but I can't imagine why."

 Leo bursts into the room, waving the pocketwatch cord about violently.
 He looks desperate, more frightened than I can ever recall seeing him.

 "Matilda, where's the glass key gone? It should be in the music box,
 with the other keys, but it isn't there. Without it I can't get into
 the gallery."

 Using the old bronze key, I unlock the cabin door.

 Once more, the padlock springs open, executing a graceful parabola and
 landing in the water.

 I open the cabin door.

 In the Cabin
 An even worse mess than last time I was here. The music box stands
 open, playing a familiar lilting tune, and a fat stream of water is
 gushing into the cabin through the hole in the roof, then soaking out
 through the floor. All in all, a fairly miserable studio. On the
 opposite side of the room, placed, I now realise, as far as possible
 from the corner with the hole, are the desk and hammock, and the exit
 is to the north.

>push pendulum
 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A
 now-familiar snapping sound assaults my ears, and I turn to find my
 surroundings reverted once more to black and white, with only the
 music box and the pendulum remaining unchanged.

>go north

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 I stop.

 The beach has been completely enveloped by a web of raindrops
 suspended in midair, so closely spaced that to get to the water's edge
 I have to pick my way slowly through them, one step at a time. I grasp
 a nearby droplet, trying to push it out of my way, but it doesn't
 budge, and even supports my weight as I strain against it. The cabin
 is back to the south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to
 the north.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>go up
 Cautiously, I grasp onto a raindrop at eye level, then lift myself up,
 finding a foothold on one of the drops below. It ends up being less
 dangerous than it looks---there's not much chance of falling since a
 mass of riveted-in-place droplets keeps me in caged into a sort of
 column. Eventually my heart rate subsides and I am able to reach roof
 level.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south
 from here.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>go south
 I step lightly onto the roof of the cabin, working my way through the
 web of rain.

 On the Roof (in monochrome)
 The summit of the cabin is completely flat, which is unfortunate for
 the cabin on days with weather like this---I can see the grandfather
 clock through one particularly rotten hole in the roof---but I
 appreciate it now, and the roughness of the surface makes it easy to
 gain purchase. I can (reluctantly) step back into the rain to the
 north or west---everything else is rock and water.

 A small marble box waits quietly in the shadow of the chimney.

>take box
 It won't move. It's like trying to manipulate solid rock.

>push pendulum
 Lying down and reaching deep into the hole, I draw the very top of the
 pendulum to the side and release. There is a snapping sound as it
 resumes its slow ticking, and the world returns to normal.

 I shiver as a raindrop slips into my eye.

>take box
 Taken.

 Cold water trickles down the back of my neck.

>push pendulum
 Reaching through the hole, I just manage to poke the topmost point of
 the pendulum, arresting its motion. A now-familiar snapping sound
 assaults my ears, and I turn to find my surroundings reverted once
 more to black and white, with only the music box and the pendulum
 remaining unchanged.

>go north
 I make my way to the edge, and, after a ghastly moment of vertigo,
 step off the roof and into the web of rain.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south
 from here.

>go down
 I pick my way carefully through a web of frozen raindrops.

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 The sea and rain, arrested, wait silently. The cabin is back to the
 south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to the north.

>go south

 In the Cabin (in monochrome)
 An unsettling glittery light pervades this room, reflected through the
 doorway by the sea of raindrops outside. A cascade of water is stopped
 in midair, gushing through a gaping hole in the cabin's low ceiling,
 just above the grandfather clock. The desk with its music box sits
 opposite, and the exit is back to the north.

 Everything in the room has been bleached of colour except the music
 box and grandfather clock, whose pendulum shines like burnished gold.

>open marble box
 I don't see any such thing.

>inventory
 It seems that I'm carrying:
   a polished marble box (closed)
   a pocketwatch
   a key ring
     an amber key (which opens Leo's kitchen door)
     a ruby key (which opens Leo's bedroom door)
     a sapphire key (which opens Leo's toilet door)
     a jade key (which opens Leo's back door)
     another brass key
   some papers
   a tiny copper key (which opens the padlock)

 Leo is frozen here, eyes locked on the middle distance.

 The ring has reappeared on my ringer.

 At my appearance, Leo stands, eyes wide. "Did you find the key?"

 When I hold up the glass key, his face morphs into the happiest
 expression I have ever seen on a human face. "Irene!" he cries. "I . .
 . you . . . " and he pulls me into a fierce hug. After a few moments
 of this, I pull back, and his expression turns solemn. "And there's
 something I need to ask---"

 He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear
 Irene's voice floating up the stairs. "Leo?"

 He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
 "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the key from my
 hands and zips out to the south.

 I simply stand there for a moment, basking in the warm glow of my own
 accomplishment, when I realise with a surge of horror that both Irene
 and whatever weapon she used are still unaccounted for---in fact, she
 probably has the gun already. I have only a few minutes to act.

>turn diamond
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

 A noise comes from the mess of colour---utterly incongruous and
 completely unmistakable, a duck quacking.

 Crack.

 A sudden, tremendous report that dies away, leaving a preternatural
 silence nearly as quiet as the ones induced by Leo's pocketwatch.

 Too long. I took too damn long.

 Abruptly, the door swings open, revealing Irene.

 "I hope you're happy!" she shouts, her voice loud enough to give me
 the queerest sense that she is addressing not me, but at someone
 directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
 she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
 staircase.

 We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
 descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
 find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.

 Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
 us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
 paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
 might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
 hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
 Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
 what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
 unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and
 call 9-9-9, quickly."

 Then she fires.

 In the Cabin
 Leo's studio is an utter shambles. The ceiling is alarmingly low and
 pockmarked with holes, the hammock strung across the rear of the room
 is all tangled up in itself, and the writing-desk beside it is
 completely covered in debris. On the desk is an empty spindle, and
 across from it stands a tranquilly ticking grandfather clock. The door
 back outside lies to the north.

 The oboe fades, the clarinet dimming as it echoes its melody.

 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A

 We've been neighbours for at least a decade, but I can count the
 number of times I've been in this room on one hand. It's attractively
 done up, though a bit austere in the furniture department. The walls
 here used to be completely covered in his paintings, but apparently
 he's removed them all since last I was here, and the room looks oddly
 bare.

 Utter fear paralyses me. I've dawdled for so long and the crisis point

 "Don't move!" shouts Irene. I freeze, but she hasn't seen me; she

 you can't do it. That's our rule, remember? No recursions. No loops."
 Her voice is steady.

 Living Room (in monochrome)
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The turquoise of the walls, however, is mercifully
 invisible, though all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
 Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
 paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
 stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 Irene is frozen here, at the bottom of the staircase.

 Upstairs
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching rainbows of subtly graduated colour, and the walls are
 covered with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the
 west, the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

>go north
 I open Leo's bedroom door.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 Leo stands here, looking healthy but frazzled.

 A familiar snapping sound comes from the hallway.

 "What I really don't understand," Leo continues,  "and you don't have
 to explain if you'd rather not---is how you got the diamond ring. I'd
 recognise it anywhere, but it can't be mine, because I've got it right
 here." He waves his own, snapping it on and off a few times for good
 measure. "I can only imagine Irene must have given it to you, but I
 can't imagine why."

>wait
 Half a minute or so goes by.

 He sinks slowly to the floor. "Christ, Matilda, I don't know what to
 do. I find my key after thinking it was lost forever, but my gallery
 is gone unless I can find that damn key. And now I can't find Irene
 anywhere."

 Leo bursts into the room, waving the pocketwatch cord about violently.
 He looks desperate, more frightened than I can ever recall seeing him.

 "Matilda, where's the glass key gone? It should be in the music box,
 with the other keys, but it isn't there. Without it I can't get into
 the gallery."

>wait
 Half a minute or so goes by.

 Leo murmurs something incomprehensible under his breath.

>push button
 I don't see any such thing.

>ask leo about ankh
 "Leo, will you give me back that stone key? You don't seem to be
 making much use of it."

 "Leave it, Matilda," he says flatly. "I don't know where you found
 that key, but the whole reason it exists is to access the gallery. It
 would be better if you just went back home and forgot about all
 this---I'm ashamed that you've managed to get involved."

 "Damn it, Leo!" I shout, ready to cry with frustration. "I want
 answers! Why won't you listen?"

 He turns away.

>take ankh
 That seems to belong to Leo.

 "All right," Leo says finally. "I'm going to keep searching. I
 couldn't find the key on the beach, but if you think you can find it
 you might look there. God knows, if I haven't found it by the time you
 get back I'll have to do something desperate."

 And with this, he walks to the bedroom door and turns his stone key in
 the lock. It flies open, and he steps into the complete whiteness
 beyond just before the door snaps shut behind him, leaving me alone.

   my house key

 Irene is frozen here, eyes riveted on the spot where I was standing a
 moment ago.

>examine waterfall
 (the waterfall painting)
 It was a present from Leo a few years ago. He usually paints from
 life---he gets up before dawn every day and paints in all sorts of
 strange places---but I asked him to do one for me from his mind, and
 as far as I know it's the only imaginary landscape he's ever done. It
 depicts a waterfall so wide that it completely fills the sky, as seen
 from a promontory in the foreground that juts out over the water's
 edge.

 The nail that's holding this painting up appears to be coming loose. I
 make a mental note to fix that at some point.

 Standing here, I feel a sudden sense of vertigo as the water plunging
 over the cliff falls away from me rather than down.

>touch waterfall
 (the waterfall painting)
 Probably a bad idea; I rehung this painting on a single nail after
 Quentin painted the walls, and it really isn't terrifically stable.

 Out of nowhere, a sudden spray of mist from the waterfall wets my
 face.

 It looks like the entries are monthly, dating from last November up

>enter waterfall
 (the waterfall painting)
 Bizarre, how casually I can do this. I walk clean into another world,
 not even pausing to look behind me after I arrive.

 Cliff's Edge
 I am momentarily disoriented as my head fills with the roar of water.
 I open my eyes to mist, positioned by a cliff which comes to a point
 some distance ahead of me. The vista beyond the cliff is dominated by
 the waterfall, unnaturally close behind, so near that it's utterly
 impossible to see anything beyond it. Up at the far edge is Leo,
 leaning dangerously over the falls.

 "Leo!" I shout. But of course he can't hear me with the water as loud
 as it is. He's drawn these falls from his imagination, and they are
 far larger than anything I can conceive of in the real world, the
 water falling from a point far above our heads, and dissolving into
 mist far below, the cloud of mist so large it becomes impossible to
 see anything in the distance---there is only water, me, Leo and a line
 of small yellow flowers that seems to be thriving in the mist off the
 falls.

 I begin running toward him. "Leo! Wait for me!" But my voice seems to
 be unable to carry. And, then, suddenly, a bell rings overhead. I
 continue to run, the motion slower and slower, but now I am perplexed.
 As it rings again, I am hit by a rush of utter horror.

 "Oh, no," I say dizzily. "No, no, no . . ." but the world is already
 dissolving into white, and through the whiteness the mist is already
 coalescing into the shape of my bedroom . . .

 Foreboding like nothing I have ever experienced, descending like a

 Oh, God.

 I crumple. From somewhere behind me, Irene begins to laugh. "They
 know," she says. "They always know. You'd better go on and take it;
 you won't be able to help yourself."

>again
 My hand is shaking: taken.

 Irene is looking at me, not quite sure what to say. I have a horrible
 feeling of possibility, the sense that anything in the world could
 happen in the next moment.

>go southwest
 I stumble blindly out of the room.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Even out of her presence, Irene's words are twisting, working their
 way through my mind.

>wait
 I hear Irene behind me, screaming Leo's name. Something gives,
 somewhere, and in my last moment of self-possession, all my fear and
 loathing and revulsion of this weapon bubbles to the surface, and I
 block you out long enough to throw open the screen door and hurl the
 gun with all my force into the motorway.

 There's a pause, then a satisfying crack as a car hits it and spins it
 into the woods on the far side of the road. I collapse back against
 the wall, exhausted.

 As I savour my triumph, Irene emerges, bemused, from the living room.
 Some kind of spell seems to have been broken. "Well, that's that,
 then. Silly of me, really, to make such a fuss over such a small
 thing." She is interrupted by the sound of stairs being loudly
 descended: Leo.

 I turn my attention to Irene, who has slipped off her bracelet and is
 pulling at it thoughtfully. Abruptly, she leans in to me and begins to
 whisper rapidly. "Listen. I'm sorry about the mistake with the key---I
 had no idea it would cause so much trouble. If you want to get it, I
 can distract him for you. But there won't be much time. If he can't
 find his silly glass key I can't be held responsible for what he'll do
 next. Try the roof of the cabin on the bay."

 Leo appears in the foyer, waving the pocketwatch wildly. "Irene," he
 gasps, "the gallery key's missing---I don't know what---I wanted you
 to---"

 "I know, Leo. Come in here; there's something we need to discuss." But
 before she goes, she leans in close, squeezes my wrist, and whispers a
 single word: "Run."

 Then she drags Leo northeast, into my living room. The door slams.

 Her eyes flip back and forth from me to the staircase, confused.

>examine irene
 I feel as though I've interrupted Irene while she was in the process
 of systematically searching my flat; she's hovering over an end table
 now and her of eyes are fixated right on me.

 "Listen," Irene says. Her voice is quick, intense, nothing like during
 our conversation on the bay. "I'm sorry to trespass on you like this.
 I came to see if Leo's been using you to hide things from me, and it
 turns out that he has." She gestures to the end table by the sofa.
 "Open the drawer there. I want you to see."

 A sick feeling develops in the pit of my stomach.

 She holds her composure. "You are under no obligation to obey,
 Matilda," she says.

>shoot irene
 Stop . . . I can't. I won't.

>shoot irene
 My thumb, moved by a will stronger than mine, cocks the hammer. "Get
 out, Irene!" I shout. "Get out!"

>shoot irene
 My hand is shaking so badly, I don't even realise my finger is pulling
 the trigger until I hear the report knocks me off balance. Irene makes
 a noise, but I am sobbing too hard to even tell whether she's been
 hit. I pull the trigger again; there is silence.

>look
 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
 Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
 paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
 stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 Leo draws toward me, wild-eyed.
 Nearby, Irene's body is splayed out on the floor.

 With uncanny timing, Leo bursts into the room. It seems to take him
 only a second to take in what's happened---from admiration to hatred,
 in a single second---and, characteristically, he reacts nearly
 instantly. Time seems to slow as he makes a rush for my gun . . .

>turn diamond
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

 A squirrelly-looking creature skitters by the edge of the cliff and
 out of the painting.

 In a flash, Leo is upon me, and I realise I have pulled the trigger
 again---surely I meant to drop it, before?---but the range makes the
 shot too close to miss, and Leo falls on the ground at my feet.

 The world spins . . .

>look
 I listen to your words for a moment, but something else is rising in
 me: a delicious knowledge. With sudden clarity, I see the futility of
 your words: I have the freedom to ignore your voice completely.

 Slowly, I lift my hand and turn the setting on my engagement ring. In
 seeming slow motion, colour drains from the world.

 Standing here, I feel a sudden sense of vertigo as the water plunging
 over the cliff falls away from me rather than down.

>look
 Relishing my freedom, I lean down briefly to kiss Leo. His lips are
 frozen, steely marble. Then I leap into the painting on the wall,
 barely hearing the crash as the frame falls to the ground and shatters
 behind me . . .

 Cliff's Edge
 I am momentarily disoriented as my head fills with the roar of water.
 I open my eyes to mist, positioned near a cliff which comes to a point
 some distance ahead of me. The vista beyond the cliff is dominated by
 the waterfall, unnaturally close behind, too near to see anything
 beyond it.

 The roar of water comes from the painting.

>look
 I look out over the landscape, which is dominated by falling water,
 the shape of the horizon only just visible beyond. I take a deep
 breath.

>wait

 You know what? Don't even bother.

 I lean down and take up one of the primroses. It smells only faintly.
 The sky here is wider than I have ever seen it. I walk up to the very,
 very edge to look down at the water below.

>inventory

 Yes.

 I run forward and cast myself over the edge . . .

 . . . and suddenly, I am flying.

 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different
 world.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

>unlock door with ankh
 Confidently, I slip the key into the lock and stride forward into pure
 alabaster.

 Whiteness
 Again, the endless white in every direction. The only feature of this
 place seems to be the door I came in through.

>unlock door with jade
 There is a satisfying snap as the key turns in the lock, and as soon
 as I withdraw the key the door flies open with an ostentatious flash
 of light. Feeling profoundly nervous, I walk through to the other
 side.

 Porch
 Leo built this porch himself, five or six years ago, ruining the
 building's symmetricality and making me quite rabidly jealous. His
 kitchen is accessible to the southeast, and our garden is east.

>go east

 Garden
 A garden, co-grown by Leo and me, although it generally seems like I
 end up doing most of the work. Currently the centrepiece of the garden
 is an easel of Leo's, which at the moment is ruthlessly engaged in
 crushing my violets, a very recent-looking painting of the pond to the
 east perched upon it. His porch is to the west, mine to the east.

>turn diamond
 I twist the diamond, which produces a familiar snapping sound, and the
 surroundings again turn chromatically inside out.

 A thin mist is setting in within the painting, and a grey cloud of
 moisture drifts out of the canvas.

>enter painting
 I step gingerly into the art, closing my eyes just in time to avoid
 the blinding flash of light . . .

 By the Pond
 The pond is a much more mysterious place at sunrise, all grays and
 ripples and dappled twilight---I find myself wishing I had the time to
 simply stand and look. I can access the garden to the west, and the
 fence marking the edge of the property stretches along the southern
 perimeter of the pond. My kitchen lies to the southwest, inaccessible
 behind the sliding door.

>go west

 Garden
 I'd forgotten how different the garden looks in the early morning, all
 the trees leaning and the droplets all bedewed and whatnot. The canvas
 I recently came through is still here, so fresh the paint is still
 dripping in places. The porch lies west, the pond east.

>go west

 Porch
 Leo's porch is decidedly less congenial in the dark. There's not
 enough light inside to make out what's happening in Leo's kitchen, to
 the southeast, and even the gardens just east of here are shrouded in
 shadow.

>se
 I try to peek inside, but even this early the light is bright enough
 to make that impractical.  I cautiously squeak the slider open. I take
 a single step inside . . .

 . . . and abruptly find myself face to face with an astonished Leo.

>wait
 I say nothing.

 "Wait a moment," says Leo, his voice suddenly strained. I follow his
 line of vision, realising that he has fixated on the pocketwatch I
 found in the living room. I watch interestedly as his face attempts to
 resolve itself into a single emotion. He seems to be about to say
 something when suddenly his gaze shifts to the stone key in my hand.
 "Dear God, Matilda. Where did you find this? Do you---wait, never
 mind."

 Before I realise what's happening he has seized the key from my hand.
 I let out a shocked exclamation, but before I can object he has blazed
 off to the south.

 Front Room (in monochrome)
 In the early-morning darkness this room isn't quite as inviting as it

 foyer to the southeast.

 A piercingly loud snapping sound comes from upstairs.

 I open Leo's front door.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Somewhat alarmingly, my front door stands wide open.

 From nearby comes the sound of someone pounding up the stairs.

>go northeast

 Living Room
 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
 Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
 paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
 stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 I hear a soft sound from the corner. Turning, I nearly jump out of my
 skin to see Irene standing at the bottom of the staircase, holding her
 hands clasped behind her back and staring at me in a peculiar way.

 "Well, hello, Matilda," she says. "I didn't think you were up yet."
 Her eyes flip back and forth from me to the staircase, confused.

>wait
 Half a minute or so goes by.

 "Listen," Irene says. Her voice is quick, intense, nothing like during
 our conversation on the bay. "I'm sorry to trespass on you like this.
 I came to see if Leo's been using you to hide things from me, and it
 turns out that he has." She gestures to the end table by the sofa.
 "Open the drawer there. I want you to see."

 A sick feeling develops in the pit of my stomach.

>open drawer
 Foreboding like nothing I have ever experienced, descending like a
 certain apocalypse. My hand shakes as I pull open the drawer . . .

 Oh, God.

>take gun
 I crumple. From somewhere behind me, Irene begins to laugh. "They
 know," she says. "They always know. You'd better go on and take it;
 you won't be able to help yourself."

>take gun
 My hand is shaking: taken.

 Irene is looking at me, not quite sure what to say. I have a horrible
 feeling of possibility, the sense that anything in the world could
 happen in the next moment.

>go southwest
 I stumble blindly out of the room.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Even out of her presence, Irene's words are twisting, working their
 way through my mind.

>save
>gun
 Enter saved game to store: All right.

>go northwest
 I hear Irene behind me, screaming Leo's name. Something gives,
 somewhere, and in my last moment of self-possession, all my fear and
 loathing and revulsion of this weapon bubbles to the surface, and I
 block you out long enough to throw open the screen door and hurl the
 gun with all my force into the motorway.

 There's a pause, then a satisfying crack as a car hits it and spins it
 into the woods on the far side of the road. I collapse back against
 the wall, exhausted.

 As I savour my triumph, Irene emerges, bemused, from the living room.
 Some kind of spell seems to have been broken. "Well, that's that,
 then. Silly of me, really, to make such a fuss over such a small
 thing." She is interrupted by the sound of stairs being loudly
 descended: Leo.

 I turn my attention to Irene, who has slipped off her bracelet and is
 pulling at it thoughtfully. Abruptly, she leans in to me and begins to
 whisper rapidly. "Listen. I'm sorry about the mistake with the key---I
 had no idea it would cause so much trouble. If you want to get it, I
 can distract him for you. But there won't be much time. If he can't
 find his silly glass key I can't be held responsible for what he'll do
 next. Try the roof of the cabin on the bay."

 Leo appears in the foyer, waving the pocketwatch wildly. "Irene," he
 gasps, "the gallery key's missing---I don't know what---I wanted you
 to---"

 "I know, Leo. Come in here; there's something we need to discuss." But
 before she goes, she leans in close, squeezes my wrist, and whispers a
 single word: "Run."

 Then she drags Leo northeast, into my living room. The door slams.

 A sudden premonition brings me up short. My mind is running through

 neighbours arguing downstairs, not with how little time I have
 left---if only there were a way to get more!

 On the easel is the pond painting.

 A cool breeze blows in from circa six a.m.

>enter painting
 I step lightly into the painting.

 By the Pond
 Again, my stomach lurches as the garden vanishes from under me and I
 find myself next to the pond. The surroundings darken subtly as the
 sun retreats slightly in the east. I take stock: I can go back into to
 the garden---again---to the west, and my worthless sliding door is to
 the southwest.

 I watch in silence as my former self heads west, into the garden.

>go west

 Once again, I tread over my plants in the dark. The canvas I recently

 Irene in my living room.

 It seems that I'm carrying:
   a bracelet (being worn)
   a key ring
     an amber key (which opens Leo's kitchen door)
     a ruby key (which opens Leo's bedroom door)
     a sapphire key (which opens Leo's toilet door)

 I am reaching for the bracelet when suddenly Leo bursts into the room,
 waving the pocketwatch cord about violently. He looks desperate, more
 frightened than I can ever recall seeing him.

 "Matilda, where's the glass key gone? It should be in the music box,
 with the other keys, but it isn't there. Without it I can't get into
 the gallery."

>enter painting
 It's not as if I can just waltz right into it.

 "What I really don't understand," Leo continues,  "and you don't have
 to explain if you'd rather not---is how you got the bracelet. I'd
 recognise it anywhere, but it can't be mine, because I've got it right
 here." He waves his own, snapping it on and off a few times for good
 measure. "I can only imagine Irene must have given it to you, but I
 can't imagine why."

>turn bracelet

 Throwing caution to the wind, I once again step boldly into the

 Dock's End
 It's much brighter here than last time---evening, rather than
 twilight, but nothing is moving, even the raindrops, and a bolt of
 lightning far off to the west gives a continuous eerie light to the
 horizon. The beach lies to the east, and the drops of water ascend
 into the sky as far as I can see.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>go east

 Along the Beach
 A thoroughly miserable spot, the tide gradually rising and threatening
 to engulf what little sand remains. A soaked-looking cabin lies to the
 south---padlocked shut again, of course--- and the beach continues to
 the north.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>go south
 Using the old bronze key, I unlock the cabin door.

 Once more, the padlock springs open, executing a graceful parabola and
 landing in the water.

 I open the cabin door.

 In the Cabin
 An even worse mess than last time I was here. The music box seems to
 be getting a thorough drenching, and a fat stream of water is gushing
 into the cabin through the hole in the roof, then soaking out through
 the floor. All in all, a fairly miserable studio. On the opposite side
 of the room, placed, I now realise, as far as possible from the corner
 with the hole, are the desk and hammock, and the exit is to the north.

 The rain beats on the roof, louder here than outside.

>push pendulum
 I grab the pendulum by the bulb on the end, arresting its motion. A
 now-familiar snapping sound assaults my ears, and I turn to find my
 surroundings reverted once more to black and white, with only the
 music box and the pendulum remaining unchanged.

>go north

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 I stop.

 The beach has been completely enveloped by a web of raindrops
 suspended in midair, so closely spaced that to get to the water's edge
 I have to pick my way slowly through them, one step at a time. I grasp
 a nearby droplet, trying to push it out of my way, but it doesn't
 budge, and even supports my weight as I strain against it. The cabin
 is back to the south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to
 the north.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>climb rain
 Cautiously, I grasp onto a raindrop at eye level, then lift myself up,
 finding a foothold on one of the drops below. It ends up being less
 dangerous than it looks---there's not much chance of falling since a
 mass of riveted-in-place droplets keeps me in caged into a sort of
 column. Eventually my heart rate subsides and I am able to reach roof
 level.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south
 from here.

 The reflective object glimmers enticingly from the roof of the cabin.

>go south
 I step lightly onto the roof of the cabin, working my way through the
 web of rain.

 On the Roof (in monochrome)
 The summit of the cabin is completely flat, which is unfortunate for
 the cabin on days with weather like this---I can see the grandfather
 clock through one particularly rotten hole in the roof---but I
 appreciate it now, and the roughness of the surface makes it easy to
 gain purchase. I can (reluctantly) step back into the rain to the
 north or west---everything else is rock and water.

 A small marble box waits quietly in the shadow of the chimney.

>take box. open it
 It won't move. It's like trying to manipulate solid rock.

 It won't move. It's like trying to manipulate solid rock.

 Lying down and reaching deep into the hole, I draw the very top of the
 pendulum to the side and release. There is a snapping sound as it
 resumes its slow ticking, and the world returns to normal.

>take box. open it. push pendulum
 Taken.

 I open the polished marble box, revealing a glass key.

 The wind abates for a second, the rain momentarily slackening.

 Reaching through the hole, I just manage to poke the topmost point of
 the pendulum, arresting its motion. A now-familiar snapping sound
 assaults my ears, and I turn to find my surroundings reverted once
 more to black and white, with only the music box and the pendulum
 remaining unchanged.

>go north
 I make my way to the edge, and, after a ghastly moment of vertigo,
 step off the roof and into the web of rain.

 In Midair (in monochrome)
 I pause a moment, slightly dazzled by the sheer distance to the
 ground, and the illusion of being suspended with absolutely nothing
 beneath my feet. The roof of the cabin is right at my feet, due south
 from here.

>go down
 I pick my way carefully through a web of frozen raindrops.

 Along the Beach (in monochrome)
 The sea and rain, arrested, wait silently. The cabin is back to the
 south, the dock to the west, and the beach continues to the north.

>go south

 In the Cabin (in monochrome)
 An unsettling glittery light pervades this room, reflected through the
 doorway by the sea of raindrops outside. A cascade of water is stopped
 in midair, gushing through a gaping hole in the cabin's low ceiling,
 just above the grandfather clock. The desk with its music box sits
 opposite, and the exit is back to the north.

 Everything in the room has been bleached of colour except the music
 box and grandfather clock, whose pendulum shines like burnished gold.

>enter music box
 (first opening the music box)
 The box springs open and a familiar, sweet little tune fills the air
 around me: Pachelbel's Canon, perhaps?

 I carefully slip my hand into the box and try not to cry out at the
 sudden sensation of being forcibly pulled into an entirely different
 world.

 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

 Leo is frozen here, eyes locked on the middle distance.

 The ring has reappeared on my ringer.
 The bracelet has reappeared on my wrist.

 At my appearance, Leo stands, eyes wide. "Did you find the key?"

 When I hold up the box, his face morphs into the happiest expression I
 have ever seen on a human face. "Irene!" he cries. "I . . . you . . .
 " and he pulls me into a fierce hug. After a few moments of this, I
 pull back, and his expression turns solemn. "And there's something I
 need to ask---"

 He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear
 Irene's voice floating up the stairs. "Leo?"

 He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
 "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the box from my
 hands and zips out to the south.

 I wait for what seems like an appropriate length of time. Then I
 descend the stairs and arrive in the foyer just as my front door is
 opening.

 " . . . But it should be pretty easy to repair; I mean, sliders aren't
 especially complicated doors, and I know a lot about broken locks,"
 Leo is saying as he exits. He stops short on seeing me: "Matilda! How
 on earth did you get down here so fast, before? When I came down the
 stairs and saw you running into the front room I was completely
 flummoxed . . . "

 I shoot a surreptitious grateful nod at Irene, who smiles. "Apparently
 you two have a little explaining to do," she remarks, withdrawing into
 my flat. "I'll just leave you two to yourselves." The door shuts
 behind her with a soft click.

 I am about to make a mordant comment about Irene's shamelessness, but
 bite it back when I see the serious expression on Leo's face.

 And then he bends, awkwardly, to one knee, bringing himself to eye
 level with my chin. He reaches out and takes my hand, slips a familiar
 ring onto my finger. And, unexpectedly, he twists the diamond. All
 colour drains out of the room, and suddenly it's just the two of us,
 staring at each other.

 For the first time I become aware of a sinking feeling, somewhere far
 beneath the surface. The knowledge that I shouldn't be in this
 situation; my own will seems to have merged utterly with one larger
 and powerful than mine. I stare at Leo, helpless.

 "Will you marry me?" he asks.

>yes
 "Yes," I say, then, more strongly, "Yes, Leo. I will marry you." He
 beams, and hugs me to him. When I pull away, he has pushed something
 angular and warm into my hands: the glass gallery key.

 "After all that work: your engagement present," he says. "I hope you
 don't mind having had to go through so much work to fetch your own
 gift."

 Something about this turn of phrase . . . a sudden spark of memory,
 somewhere in my subconscious. Vexation? Doubt? I pause a moment,
 trying to place it. But finally I change my mind and push the impulse
 aside---random whims from mysterious sources, after all, are one thing
 I'm fully capable of coping with.

 Leo is still looking at me anxiously. All of a sudden, I smile. "Let
 me see it."

 I regard him for a moment, allowing a long, tactful pause. "I'm sorry,
 Leo," I say gently. "My feelings haven't changed since last you
 asked." A pause. "But, you know, I'm in on your secret now. I'd be
 willing to help, if you like. I want to see all these places you
 visit---you paint, I'll explore. You need to start painting from you
 imagination more often, I think. We'll be partners."

 "Partners," he repeats. But he won't look me in the eye. I take his
 hand and pull him to his feet.

 "Will you be all right?"

 He makes a helpless gesture. "I guess I'm just unsure as to---If
 there's anything I can do---"

 "Well," I say briskly, "You can start by giving me a tour of this
 gallery of yours."

 What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
 complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
 two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
 Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
 paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
 stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.

 I hear a soft sound from the corner. Turning, I nearly jump out of my
 skin to see Irene standing at the bottom of the staircase, holding her
 hands clasped behind her back and staring at me in a peculiar way.

 "Well, hello, Matilda," she says. "I didn't think you were up yet."
 Her eyes flip back and forth from me to the staircase, confused.

>examine furniture
 I think there's enough going on at the moment that I can safely say
 the state of the furniture is immaterial.

 "Listen," Irene says. Her voice is quick, intense, nothing like during
 our conversation on the bay. "I'm sorry to trespass on you like this.
 I came to see if Leo's been using you to hide things from me, and it
 turns out that he has." She gestures to the end table by the sofa.
 "Open the drawer there. I want you to see."

 A sick feeling develops in the pit of my stomach.

>open drawer
 Foreboding like nothing I have ever experienced, descending like a
 certain apocalypse. My hand shakes as I pull open the drawer . . .

 Oh, God.

>take gun
 I crumple. From somewhere behind me, Irene begins to laugh. "They
 know," she says. "They always know. You'd better go on and take it;
 you won't be able to help yourself."

>take gun
 My hand is shaking: taken.

 Irene is looking at me, not quite sure what to say. I have a horrible
 feeling of possibility, the sense that anything in the world could
 happen in the next moment.

>shoot me
 I stop dead.

 An elegant solution you've come up with, then, isn't it? You know how
 it tempts me to be rid of you forever, to leave Leo and Irene and all
 this mess behind.

 Irene looks on glazedly as I slowly raise the gun to point at my own
 temple. But my mind doesn't stop reeling: what sort of game could you
 be playing at, asking me to do this? How did I fail to notice when
 your intentions ceased to be good, when they turned destructive? Is it
 some kind of test? Or could it be that this is what you've had in mind
 all along? A horrible vision crosses my mind---of myself, waking this
 morning, trusting you implicitly, totally unaware of what's to come---

 Enough. I pull the trigger.



     *** You have won ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT?
>undo

 [Previous turn undone.]

>shoot window
 Please, don't. I have no desire to shoot any of my possessions.

 And I'm still holding this filthy weapon.

>shoot window
 I beg of you, please don't ask me to do this.

 The pistol scorches my hands, seeming to twist and contort
 nightmarishly as I look at it.

>shoot window
 I take aim, but the shot goes wide and winds up burrowing itself in
 the wall. Irene cries out involuntarily.

 I am filled with pure abhorrence---of you, of myself, of Irene---but
 overwhelmingly, of the pistol. Of their own accord, my fingers loosen
 and the gun falls to the ground. The subsequent tide of relief makes
 me lightheaded.

>take gun
 My resolve strengthens: No. I will do anything you want to that bloody
 machine, but my hands, at least, are mine, and you cannot make them
 touch it.

 Irene is staring fixedly at the gun on the floor, an odd gleam in her
 eye.

>ask irene about gun
 I'd say we more or less exhausted that one earlier.

 I look up to see that an expression of horror has appeared on Irene's
 face---directed not at me, I suddenly realise, but behind me.

 "Leo," she gasps. Grabbing her cane from beside her, she twists
 something on her bracelet and vanishes. I blink, and suddenly Irene is
 on the other side of the kitchen window.

 My gaze moves to the floor where the gun lay until a moment ago, then
 out the window. My stomach sinks.

>restore

 Enter saved game to load: Very well.

>look
 Vacant Room
 This room is completely empty. The floor and ceiling are still
 painted, and the windows still becurtained, suggesting that Leo made
 use of this room at some point, but the walls are absolutely bare
 except for one of his canvases---an abstract---which takes up most of
 the eastern wall. The hallway lies back to the south.

>inventory
 It seems that I'm carrying:
   a diamond ring
   a pocketwatch
   a key ring
     an amber key (which opens Leo's kitchen door)
     a ruby key (which opens Leo's bedroom door)
     a sapphire key (which opens Leo's toilet door)
     a jade key (which opens Leo's back door)
     another brass key
   some papers
   a tiny copper key (which opens the padlock)
   an old bronze key (which opens Leo's bayside cabin)
   my house key

>go south

 Upstairs
 Unlike me, Leo has managed to fashion his shady little passageway into
 an attractive space. The floor and ceiling have been painted in
 matching rainbows of subtly graduated colour, and the walls are
 covered with a riot of paint swatches. The stairs back down lie to the
 west, the community toilet southeast, and the empty room to the north.

>se
 Using the sapphire key, I unlock Leo's toilet door.

 I open Leo's toilet door.

 Water Closet
 Just your standard toilet-doubling-as-a-hallway-between-flats,
 equipped with all the usuals. The door back to my flat is northeast,
 Leo's northwest.

>go northeast
 The door rattles irritatingly---the latch on the other side must be
 locked.

 Staircase
 This staircase is the mirror of mine except that his picture window
 looks out on the neighbours' rooftops. I can continue up or down.

>open window
 That's not something I can open.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 Front Room
 In the early-morning darkness this room isn't quite as inviting as it
 was earlier. The major geography, however, is unchanged: kitchen to
 the north, Irene's room to the northeast, stairs to the west, and the
 foyer to the southeast.

>se
 I open Leo's front door.

 Foyer
 This is the hallway between my flat and Leo's.  Leo's inhabits 717A,
 to the northwest, while mine, 717B, is to the northeast. The door
 outside is to the south.

 Somewhat alarmingly, my front door stands wide open.

>look
 Hallway (in monochrome)
 A tiny, dank space beyond my decorative abilities to remedy. Leo's
 painting on the west wall is just sufficiently distracting so that one
 might not notice the total lack of windows, at least. The stairs down
 lie to the east, my bedroom is north, and the toilet is southwest.

 Curiously, the garden painting has failed to go black and white.

 I sneeze as a sudden blast of pollen is borne through the painting
 into the hallway.

>go north

 Bedroom (in monochrome)
 Everything is in perfectly in order here---white and austere, as I
 like it. The door to the hallway lies to the south, and windows border
 the other three sides of the room.

>push button
 Strangely, the button won't push. Perhaps the diamond ring and the
 pocketwatch are mutually exclusive?

>turn ring
 Snap: colours.

>examine bed
 It's a queen-size canopied four-poster, and damn comfy.

>look under it
 Just a dust bunny colony that's been flourishing undisturbed for
 several decades now.

>examine bunny
 I don't see any such thing.

>search bed
 There is nothing on the bed.

>examine furniture

 the state of the furniture is immaterial.

 the other three sides of the room.

>examine door
 A completely unremarkable white pine door.

>look behind door
 No behind to speak of.

>look behind bed
 No behind to speak of.

>examine windows
 Due to an architectural quirk, the north side of my bedroom juts out
 an extra six feet from of the building, allowing a view of the entire
 back of the building via the west window. I ought to be able to see
 directly into Leo's bedroom from that window, but no; he's curtained
 it off. The north window is mostly obscured by the oak in the back
 garden, and the east window overlooks the pond.

>examine oak
 Far, far older even than I, the oak towers over the building in a way
 that makes human efforts at architecture seem rather pitiful.

>open window
 Ugh, no. If I open the windows now the house will be like an oven this
 afternoon.

>examine pond
 Dark and cold all year, and looking particularly tranquil this
 morning---closer to blue than the usual brown.

>examine building
 I don't see any such thing.

>examine leo's bedroom
 I only understood you as far as wanting me to examine the other brass
 key.

>examine dresser
 I think there's enough going on at the moment that I can safely say
 the state of the furniture is immaterial.

>open dresser
 That's not something I can open.

>search dresser
 I don't find anything of interest.

>take all
 I don't see anything notable.

>c quentin
 Quentin's my nephew---my short, pasty, befreckled, overweight,
 acne-plagued nephew. Despite all the favours he's done for me, I think
 he rather loathes me, but since his wife very sensibly left him last
 month he's flat broke, and he knows what he has to do if he wants to
 receive any kind of pittance in the will.

>c sister
 Ivy is Irene's sister. I don't actually know very much about her; she
 kept very much to herself and only visited the flat once. She lived in
 the city---right next to the peace gardens, in fact---and died during
 the epidemic.

>c brother
 I've no particular memories associated with that.

>c aunt
 I've no particular memories associated with that.

>examine wallet
 I don't see any such thing.
