 You're just finishing a walk down the high street, when you hear
 footsteps behind you.

 <span class="floydstyle header">The Laughing Gnome</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Teaspoon
 Release 2 / Serial number 160212 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)
 First time players may wish to type ABOUT.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Street</span>
 Not as musical as Denmark Street, not flash like Carnaby Street or
 rocking like Electric Avenue, but it's your high street and you like
 it. However, "The Forsyte Saga" is on so everything's shut except the
 corner shop to the south. Your house is to the north and the Surbiton
 Railway Station is to the east.

 You can see a Gnome here.

 Written for the first Intfiction Weekly SpeedIF comp (1 Jan 2016),
 this was intended as a straightforward adaption of "The Laughing
 Gnome" into text adventuring, in answer to the David Bowie prompt. It
 did get slightly out of control; a list of references would be long
 and tedious, but it does seem only polite to mention Stella Street as
 an inspiration/source of ripoff material.

 There's a walkthrough under Walkthrough, as it happens, but following
 the song should cover you.

 Thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short for Inform 7.

 Thanks to David Bowie for half a century of beautiful music.

 Apologies to anyone reading this who may happen to be from Surbiton
 and wishes to point out that Stella Street is *not* next door to the
 railway station there. For everybody else - said station really is
 excitingly futuristic as described. Honest. Worth a look.

 The cover art, such as it is, was constructed by me, myself and I, and
 released under the CC BY 4.0 license, should it be desired for some
 arcane reason.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Street</span>
 Not as musical as Denmark Street, not flash like Carnaby Street or
 rocking like Electric Avenue, but it's your high street and you like
 it. However, "The Forsyte Saga" is on so everything's shut except the
 corner shop to the south. Your house is to the north and the Surbiton
 Railway Station is to the east.

 You can see a Gnome here.

>examine gnome

 A little old man in scarlet and grey. He trots along besides you.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a light
   a cigarette

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine light

 A battered antique one, of no great interest except for the engraving.
 "To Father Brown, with all my thanks". You occasionally wonder what
 sort of priest would get a light for a present.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine cigarette

 A cigarette. Your favourite brand: Political Correctness Gone Mad, or
 POC for short.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine me

 Ziggy Stardust.

 Not really. Just a struggling writer trying to break into radio.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to gnome

 "My brother Fred always wanted to be a comedy singer. I like the
 joke-writing, myself."

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to gnome

 "Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school? You look like a
 rolling gnome."

 "No, not at the London School of Ecognomics."

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to gnome

 "Here, where do you come from?"

 "Gnome man's land!"

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to gnome

 "Haven't you got an 'ome to go to?"

 "No, we're gnomads."

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to gnome

 "I'm a laughing gnome and you don't catch me!"

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to gnome

 "My brother Fred always wanted to be a comedy singer. I like the
 joke-writing, myself."

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corner Shop</span>
 The sign says Mick & Keith's Corner Shop, in carefully-equilateral
 lettering. It shows a good deal more foresight than the shop itself,
 which is a tiny cramped place with products strewn everywhere.
 Usually, anyway: there are only a few items left on the shelves.

 You can see Keith, dandelion wine, Brazil nuts, caviar, honey and a
 mop here.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 The Gnome arrives from the north.

>examine keith

 He's just a touch drunk, although whether punch or otherwise is
 difficult to tell.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to keith

 "Mick's out watching his bloody show, the shop's been raided, still
 can't get any Lemsip...just get what you want and leave, all right?
 I'll put it on your tab."

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine wine

 Imported from Illinois, apparently.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine nuts

 A prominent animator had little packets sent to all sorts of odd
 places as a promotional stunt for his new film.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine caviar

 You see nothing special about caviar.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine honey

 You see nothing special about honey.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine mop

 "Just what you need if that last one is looking a little bit ragged!"

 A space-age design with self-contained water supply. Also Fairy.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>take all

 dandelion wine: Taken.
 Brazil nuts: Taken.
 caviar: Your tab is big enough as it is. Caviar is rather beyond your
 means.
 honey: Your tab is big enough as it is. Honey is rather beyond your
 means.
 mop: Taken.
 bag: That seems to belong to the Gnome.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine bag

 Doubtless full of mysterious gnome objects.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>eat nuts

 Only slightly stale. You nibble a few.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>taste wine

 You taste nothing unexpected.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a mop
   Brazil nuts
   dandelion wine
   a light
   a cigarette

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>eat caviar

 You'd have to pay Keith for it, which you can't just at present, being
 temporarily embarassed. So that's no then.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>mop floor

 I only understood you as far as wanting to mop.

>mop

 Keith is deeply offended by people cleaning in here besides him. Or
 just offended by cleaning in general, hard to say.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>wear mop

 You can't wear that!

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Street</span>
 Not as musical as Denmark Street, not flash like Carnaby Street or
 rocking like Electric Avenue, but it's your high street and you like
 it. However, "The Forsyte Saga" is on so everything's shut except the
 corner shop to the south. Your house is to the north and the Surbiton
 Railway Station is to the east.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 The Gnome arrives from the south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Your new flat, or rather your antiquated Victorian terrace house (now
 only one floor, after what the landlord described as an exotic and
 friendly swarm of Egyptian super termites). After deploying a
 flamethrower, six kinds of bleach and the local exorcist, you now have
 a kitchen that only vaguely smells of toxic gloop. The bathroom, such
 as it is, is to the north.

 You can see an oven, a bed, a fireplace and a telly here.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 The Gnome arrives from the south.

>examine oven

 A hulking old iron oven you picked up for a song from the nice couple
 down the way. They said they were upgrading to something more
 managable, like one made out of mud.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>open oven

 It isn't something you can open.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine bed

 The one usable piece of furniture left in the place, a heavy piece
 that's fixed in place.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>look under bed

 You find nothing of interest.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>enter bed

 You get onto the bed.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>sleep

 Sleep with that chortling gnome around? Not likely.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>stand

 You get off the bed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Your new flat, or rather your antiquated Victorian terrace house (now
 only one floor, after what the landlord described as an exotic and
 friendly swarm of Egyptian super termites). After deploying a
 flamethrower, six kinds of bleach and the local exorcist, you now have
 a kitchen that only vaguely smells of toxic gloop. The bathroom, such
 as it is, is to the north.

 You can see a Gnome, an oven, a bed, a fireplace and a telly here.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine fireplace

 Incongruously huge, with the draftiest chimney you ever did see. You
 could probably fit two gnomes comfortably in here if it didn't smell
 of gloop.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>smell fireplace

 It smells like yesterday's chicken tikka masala, actually.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>clean it

 You rub the fireplace.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>mop it

 I only understood you as far as wanting to mop.

>mop

 You attack the remaining gloop, finding a pocket of residue in the
 chimney. Away with it! Everything now smells like Fairies.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>examine residue

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a mop
   Brazil nuts
   dandelion wine
   a light
   a cigarette

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>smell

 It smells like yesterday's chicken tikka masala, actually.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Your new, nicely cleaned flat.  Or antiquated Victorian terrace house.
 The bathroom, such as it is, is to the north.

 You can see a Gnome, an oven, a bed, a fireplace and a telly here.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine telly

 It's stuck on BBC Two. If you liked the Forsyte Saga, you wouldn't
 have gone on that walk and met this gnome.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 Indescribably filthy. It would make a student houseshare look neat. It
 makes that bloke Withnail look tidy by comparision. It looks a little
 cleaner than the one that Richard and Eddie down the way have.

 The one advantage is that you can't see any of those fiddly objects
 such as a toilet, shower, or a mirror full of asprin and toothbrushes
 - everything is indistinguisable under toxic gloop.

 You can see toadstools here.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 The Gnome arrives from the south.

>mop

 You rub the mop around a bit. A vocabulary list comes to mind,
 consisting of words such as futile, pointless, useless, unhelpful,
 wishful, pathetic, ineffectual, unavailing...cleaning this bathroom is
 beyond your ken, in short.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine toadstools

 They look like the kind of thing you might feed a gnome.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>take them

 I'm not sure what 'them' refers to.

>take toadstools

 Taken.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>feed gnome

 What do you want to feed the Gnome?

>toadstools

 "Uncooked toadstools?"

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Your new, nicely cleaned flat.  Or antiquated Victorian terrace house.
 The bathroom, such as it is, is to the north.

 You can see an oven, a bed, a fireplace and a telly here.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 The Gnome arrives from the north.

>put toadstools in oven

 Your feeble culinary skills are at least sufficient for the purpose of
 heaating toadstools for gnomes. One plate of roast toadstools, coming
 right up!

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine toadstools

 You still wouldn't eat them.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>give toadstools to gnome

 The Gnome seems very pleased with your cooking.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>full

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>score

 You have so far scored 2 out of a possible 5, in 54 turns.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a mop
   Brazil nuts
   dandelion wine
   a light
   a cigarette

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>give nuts to gnome

 The gnome shakes his head. "Gnomes prefer toadstools."

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>light cigarette

 You light the cigarette.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>smoke cigarette

 It occurs to you this is your last one. Maybe you'd better save it.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>undo


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine cigarette

 A cigarette. Your favourite brand: Political Correctness Gone Mad, or
 POC for short.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Street</span>
 Not as musical as Denmark Street, not flash like Carnaby Street or
 rocking like Electric Avenue, but it's your high street and you like
 it. However, "The Forsyte Saga" is on so everything's shut except the
 corner shop to the south. Your house is to the north and the Surbiton
 Railway Station is to the east.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 The Gnome arrives from the north.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Surbiton Railway Station</span>
 The Surbiton Railway Station: a rather excitingly futurist-looking
 building done up in lots of white concrete and glass. A large sign
 says "Due to the current rail strike, no trains are available except
 the Victoria-Eastbourne Express." You can see the Express to the
 north. The High Street is to the west.

 You can see a Ticket Seller here.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

 The Gnome arrives from the west.

>examine seller

 Dark hair, glasses and enough world-weariness to float HMS Belfast.
 She is struggling with a malfunctioning piece of equipment.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine equipment

 A ticket machine which does not seem to be functioning properly.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>fix machine

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to seller

 "Everyone went on strike to protest the new continually-running
 express to Eastbourne," she tells you with the air of someone who has
 long since stopped listening to what she was saying.
 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>buy ticket

 The Ticket Seller shrugs. "Gnomes travel free. So do you, if I can't
 get this machine to work properly."

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Express</span>
 The train is a smooth, highly-industralised piece of equipment that is
 not powered by steam in any way whatsoever.

 You persuade the gnome to follow you on board the express, even
 carrying his bag, and wave him goodbye. So long to the gnome, then.
 Nome, even. Back to your mundane existence.

 You head home for some much needed sleep, awaken fresh and bright the
 next day, and find that he's back. What's more, he's brought a friend.

 Somehow, you aren't really surprised.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Kitchen</span> (on the bed)
 Your new, nicely cleaned flat.  Or antiquated Victorian terrace house.
 The bathroom, such as it is, is to the north.

 You can see Fred, a Gnome, an oven, a fireplace and a telly here.

 Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>examine fred

 A metrognome. A metrosexual ticker, then.

 Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.

 Ha ha ha, hee hee hee.

>talk to fred

 Fred gazes solemmly up at you. "I would like to sing you a song," he
 explains.
 explains.

>yes
 It's a song about how someone out on a walk met a laughing gnome. You
 are immediately struck by its brilliance and call up the BBC to tell
 them about the fantastic talent of these gnomes you've discovered.

 The BBC immediately employs them to write comedic prose for the Nome
 Service, the gnomes move into your chimney, and you all live on caviar
 and honey. A happy ending for everyone!



     *** The End ***


 In that game you scored 3 out of a possible 5, in 65 turns.

 Hurrah!

 Tip for the points: try doing things that would make the gnomes happy
 to move in with you.
