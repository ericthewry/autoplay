 Waiting on the shore; sand yields beneath my feet
 The water shouts and roars and rushes
 And breaks on the rocks, and
 Never comes near to where I wait.

 The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered
 away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's
 just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend
 cook-out isn't the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is
 an appealing thought.

 None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

 Release 6 / Serial number 960613 / Inform v1405 Library 5/8

 Edge Of Meadow
 The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
 afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old
 wooden bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a
 scrubby hillside stretches upward.

 The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are
 pleasantly far off to the west.

 I beg your pardon?

>examine stream
 It's not particularly deep, but it's spectacularly clear. Streaks of
 green trail along the stones at the stream's bottom, and you see the
 rare glint of a fish in the sunlight.

>go west
 You turn your back on the hill, and consider the distant shapes of your
 companions. One of them waves hugely to you. You shrug, and begin
 jogging towards them.

     *** You have a good time after all. ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT?

 Edge Of Meadow
 [Previous turn undone]

>examine fish
 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>examine bridge
 A narrow span of weathered wood crosses the stream here. The boards are
 vaguely warped, and the handrails aren't quite connected each to the
 next, but it's held this long and you expect it will probably support
 you.

>examine sky
 The sun is sinking slowly in a clear blue sky. It's the end of a long,
 long summer afternoon.

>catch fish
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take fish
 You can't see any such thing.

>cross bridge
 The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.

 Stream Bank
 A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge
 which spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the
 east rises the flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight;
 two usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.

>examine stones
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>examine stream
 It's not particularly deep, but it's spectacularly clear. Streaks of
 green trail along the stones at the stream's bottom, and you see the
 rare glint of a fish in the sunlight.

 The sun is lazily approaching the horizon.

>examine hill
 That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>go northeast

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
 with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.
 In the distance, a lake reflects orange fire from the setting sun.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
 Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using
 the spade to dig the trench, and you can also figure why he stopped;
 the shaft is broken off about two feet up from the blade. The handle
 end is nowhere in sight.

>take spad
 You can't see any such thing.

>take spade
 The broken spade is stuck in the dried mud. The shaft bends slightly;
 perhaps you can pull it free.

>take shaft
 The broken spade is stuck in the dried mud. The shaft bends slightly;
 perhaps you can pull it free.

>pull spade
 You get a good grip on what's left of the shaft.

 Crack!

 The shaft has snapped off right where it joins the blade. The blade is
 left buried in the mud.

 From within some tall grass, you notice a pair of dark eyes. The grass
 blinks, and then it is a small, orange fox who watches you solemnly.

 The fox chases around your feet for a moment. It seems to be watching
 something you hold.

>throw stick
 The fox cocks its head as you wind up; it tenses to spring, and you
 hurl the stick far back into the undergrowth. With a yip the fox
 streaks after it.

 A moment later it's back, bushy tail high. It drops its prize at your
 feet.

 The fox chases around the spade shaft for a moment, then stops and
 stares at you to make sure you didn't see.

>pet fox
 Without seeming to move, the fox is out of your way.

 The sun is settling to the horizon, amid a scattering of clouds which
 have begun to drift in.

>examine clouds
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine sky
 A few bands of cloud are visible on the western horizon, lit by the
 reddening sun.

 The fox darts at something in the undergrowth.

>take stick
 Taken.

 The fox vanishes.

>get blade
 The spade blade is stuck in the dried mud.

>dig mud
 The mud is dry and quite hard.

>score
 That's not how life works.

>examine undergrowth
 You can't see any such thing.

>go east
 The trail turns southeast as it climbs.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, meadows glow in the sunlight, sweeping to the
 ribbons of color on the horizon. Behind you stands the last stony lump
 of hill. A narrow trail curves away to the northwest.

 A boulder is half-buried at the base of the hilltop.

 The fox appears from behind the boulder.

>examine boulder
 It's a roundish lump of rock -- about what you thought. Maybe two or
 two-and-a-half feet across.

 In the shadow behind the boulder, you notice an edge of deeper
 blackness. It's a cave of some sort.

 The western horizon has become a surging sea of gold and scarlet waves.
 The light is magical -- a cool bronze radiance that somehow makes the
 grass and foliage more intensely green than ever.

 The fox chases its tail furiously for a moment, then stops and stares
 at you to make sure you didn't see.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine cave
 You can only see a few inches of dark emptiness behind the boulder.

 The fox chases around your feet for a moment. It seems to be watching
 something you hold.

>enter cave
 There are only a few inches of space between the boulder and the cave
 mouth. You can't possibly squeeze through.

>pry boulder
 You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave -- fruitlessly. It's
 well sunk into the ground.

 The moment is gone. The sun has set, although the clouds are still
 well-lit.

 The fox vanishes.

>pry boulder with stick
 The shaft is too thick to wedge under the boulder.

>throw stick in cave
 That can't contain things.

>push boulder
 You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave -- fruitlessly. It's
 well sunk into the ground.

>go northwest
 The trail turns west as it descends.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank. Stuck
 in the mud near it is a spade blade.

 before).

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of dimming meadowland,
 patched with dark woods and stitched with dark streams. In the
 distance, a lake glows pale in the last light of the sky.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where

 You won't get far without something to dig with.

 The fox chases around your feet for a moment. It seems to be watching

 At this point, it's just a two-foot-long stick, broken at both ends.

 The fox chases its tail furiously for a moment, then stops and stares
 at you to make sure you didn't see.

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of dim meadowland, patched
 with dark woods and stitched with dark streams. A layer of mist is
 rolling across the landscape.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where

 The fox appears beside a clump of weeds.

>se

 Steep Face
 You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface. Mist
 hides the stream below and the hilltop above, but the meadows and
 clouds beyond sweep away into the west.

 Trails angle down to the northwest and southwest. Another crosses the
 hill to the south, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the south. It's
 right in the gap in the southern path. You could probably use it to get
 across. (One of those little coincidences that makes your life a little
 nicer.)

 Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
 stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you
 might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.

 The fox appears on a nearby rock.

 The fox blinks.

>climb tree
 The trunk is smooth and the lowest branch is at least twenty feet in
 the air.

>examine bush
 You see nothing special about the bush.

 The fox has slipped away.

>search bush
 You find nothing of interest.

 Runoff water is trickling down the hill, concentrated here by some
 twist of geography. It puddles on the ledge, then begins pouring down
 the path to the northwest.

>go south
 You stretch a foot towards the bush, shift your weight, and take two
 quick steps. The bush trembles but holds.

 Edge of Bluff
 You are in a dense tangle of shadow, bushes, and small trees. The
 ground falls away to the southeast, to the misty meadows below.

 A trail curves down to the southwest. Another cuts along the hill to
 the north, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the north. It's
 right in the gap in the northern path.

 An old shed stands just to the east. It's weathered but sturdy, still
 wearing the tatters of a coat of white paint. The door is closed.

 The fox appears under a nearby bush.

>open door
 It seems to be locked.

 It's dark and it's raining.

>examine lock
 The shed is weathered but sturdy, still wearing the tatters of a coat
 of white paint. The door is closed. The lock looks badly rusted.

 The fox has slipped away.

>hit lock with stick
 I only understood you as far as wanting to hit the old shed.

>hit lock
 It may be weathered, but it's not weakened. You can't even shake it.

 Runoff water is flowing down the hillside here. It puddles on the
 ledge, and streams down the northwest path.

 stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you
 might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.

>drink water
 There's nothing suitable to drink here.

 It's dark and it's raining. Hard.

 The fox appears beside a clump of weeds.

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. A dark expanse
 stretches to the north and west, impenetrable with rain.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 A stream of runoff water is flowing down from the southeast, and
 pouring down the trench to the unseen stream below.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank. Stuck
 in the mud near it is a spade blade.

>take spade
 (the spade blade)
 The spade blade slides free of the mud.

>go east
 The trail turns southeast as it climbs.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, the world is cloaked in dark rain. Behind you
 stands the last stony lump of hill. A narrow trail curves away to the
 northwest.

 A boulder is half-buried at the base of the hilltop. The mouth of a
 small cave is just visible behind it.

 You are getting tired.

>pry boulder
 You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave -- fruitlessly. It's
 well sunk into the ground.

>wedge spade under boulder
 Which do you mean, the spade blade or the broken spade shaft?

>blade
 The blade is thin enough to work under the boulder, but it's too short
 to give you any leverage.

 The fox appears beside a clump of weeds.

 The fox glances at you, or perhaps something you hold.

 soundless fury --


 You awaken, soaked and feverish, bathed in the listless light of an

>go southwest
 The trail turns west as it descends.

 Wildflowers
 Elsewhere in the park, flowers lie in hollows and peek out from under
 the brush. Here you have found a profusion of them. Sprays of white and
 blue lie everywhere; the vines ripple yellow.

 Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the
 stream. A trail leads northward towards the bridge; another heads
 steeply up to the east, and a third curves around the hill to the
 southeast.

 A glint in a nearby bush looks more metallic than floral.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
 Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
 with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter ruby in the
 sunlight. In the distance, a lake reflects red fire from the setting
 sun.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where

 Steep Face
 You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface.
 Greenery hides the stream below and the hilltop above, but the meadows
 and sky beyond sweep away to the clouds in the west.

 Trails angle down to the northwest and southwest. Another crosses the
 hill to the south, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the south. It's
 right in the gap in the southern path.

 Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
 stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you
 might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.

 The western horizon has become a surging sea of gold and scarlet waves.
 The light is magical -- a cool bronze radiance that somehow makes the
 grass and foliage more intensely green than ever.

 It's a small spade; at least, the blade and about two feet of the shaft
 of one.

>wedge blade under boulder
 You notice a cave of some sort behind the boulder. (Who would have
 guessed?)

 You push the spade under the boulder, kick the blade to settle it, and
 lean on the shaft. Nothing happens for a moment, and you're leaning
 harder, and the boulder starts to move, and

 Crack!

 The spade's shaft has broken off in your hands, right above the blade,
 which is now caught under the boulder. On the other hand, you've moved
 the boulder up out of its hole; it's balanced on the rim.

>push rock
 You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave. It goes tumbling
 straight down the hill to the west, out of sight. A few moments later
 you hear a rending

 Crack!

 A sudden wave of nerves pulls you downhill after it....

 You were right; the bridge has been neatly demolished, and the boulder
 sits innocently in the stream, in the wreckage. So much for your little
 exploration. You go off, resigned, to tell the park rangers what you've
 done.

 Small Cave
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.

 blinding crimson to the west, partially obscured by the boulder.

 An ancient and filthy blanket is crumpled against one wall of the cave.

 You glance outside. The moment is gone. The sun has set, although the

 Stone dissolves around you as move up and forwards, into a grainy grey

 The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered
 away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's
 just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend

 an appealing thought.

 None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

 Edge Of Meadow
 The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
 afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old
 wooden bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a
 scrubby hillside stretches upward.

 The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are
 pleasantly far off to the west.

>go east
 The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.

 Stream Bank
 A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge
 which spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the
 east rises the flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight;
 two usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.

>go south

 Wildflowers
 Elsewhere in the park, flowers lie in hollows and peek out from under
 the brush. Here you have found a profusion of them. Sprays of white and
 blue lie everywhere; the vines ripple yellow.

 Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the
 stream. A trail leads northward towards the bridge; another heads
 steeply up to the east, and a third curves around the hill to the
 southeast.

 A glint in a nearby bush looks more metallic than floral.

>go northeast

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
 with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.
 In the distance, a lake reflects white fire from the setting sun.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
 Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using
 the spade to dig the trench, and you can also figure why he stopped;
 the shaft is broken off about two feet up from the blade. The handle
 end is nowhere in sight.

 The sun is lazily approaching the horizon.

 You catch a pair of dark eyes in the edge of your vision; then they are
 gone.

>pour water on spade
 You splash the water around the spade. The mud absorbs it greedily.

 From within some tall grass, you notice a pair of dark eyes. The grass
 blinks, and then it is a small, orange fox who watches you solemnly.

>take spade
 The broken spade slides free of the mud.

>go east
 The trail turns southeast as it climbs.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, meadows glow in the thickening sunlight. Behind
 you stands the last stony lump of hill. A narrow trail curves away to
 the northwest.

 A boulder is half-buried at the base of the hilltop.

>wedge blade under rock
 You notice a cave of some sort behind the boulder. (Who would have
 guessed?)

 You push the spade under the boulder, kick the blade to settle it, and
 lean on the shaft. Nothing happens for a moment, and you're leaning
 harder, and the boulder starts to move, and

 Crack!

 The spade's shaft has broken off in your hands, right above the blade,
 which is now caught under the boulder. On the other hand, you've moved
 the boulder up out of its hole; it's balanced on the rim.

 Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here

 A trail curves down to the southwest. Another cuts along the hill to

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the north. It's

 wearing the tatters of a coat of white paint. The door is closed.

 The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered
 away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's
 just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend
 cook-out isn't the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is
 an appealing thought.

 None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

 Release 6 / Serial number 960613 / Inform v1405 Library 5/8

 Edge Of Meadow
 The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
 afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old
 wooden bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a
 scrubby hillside stretches upward.

 The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are
 pleasantly far off to the west.

>go east
 The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.

 Stream Bank
 A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge
 which spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the
 east rises the flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight;
 two usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.

 Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the
 stream. A trail leads northward towards the bridge; another heads
 steeply up to the east, and a third curves around the hill to the
 southeast.

 A glint in a nearby bush looks more metallic than floral.

>take glint
 (It turns out to be a battered old tin bucket.) Taken.

>go north

 Stream Bank

>verbose
 A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER is now in its "verbose" mode, which always
 gives long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there
 before).

>fill bucket
 You fill the bucket with water.

>go northeast

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
 with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.
 In the distance, a lake reflects white fire from the setting sun.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
 Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using
 the spade to dig the trench, and you can also figure why he stopped;
 the shaft is broken off about two feet up from the blade. The handle
 end is nowhere in sight.

 The sun is lazily approaching the horizon.

>pour water on spade
 You splash the water around the spade. The mud absorbs it greedily.

>take spade
 The broken spade slides free of the mud.

>go east
 The trail turns southeast as it climbs.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, meadows glow in the thickening sunlight. Behind
 you stands the last stony lump of hill. A narrow trail curves away to
 the northwest.

 A boulder is half-buried at the base of the hilltop.

>wedge blade under boulder
 You notice a cave of some sort behind the boulder. (Who would have
 guessed?)

 You push the spade under the boulder, kick the blade to settle it, and
 lean on the shaft. Nothing happens for a moment, and you're leaning
 harder, and the boulder starts to move, and

 Crack!

 The spade's shaft has broken off in your hands, right above the blade,
 which is now caught under the boulder. On the other hand, you've moved
 the boulder up out of its hole; it's balanced on the rim.

 From within some tall grass, you notice a pair of dark eyes. The grass
 blinks, and then it is a small, orange fox who watches you solemnly.

 The fox chases around your feet for a moment. It seems to be watching
 something you hold.

>go east
 You squeeze behind the boulder and crawl inside.

 Small Cave
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.
 It is not quite high enough to stand in, but surprisingly long,
 narrowing only slowly towards the back. The entrance is a circle of
 scarlet and gold to the west, partially obscured by the boulder.

 An ancient and filthy blanket is crumpled against one wall of the cave.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond

 ribbons of color on the horizon. Behind you stands the last stony lump
 of hill. A narrow trail curves away to the northwest.

 A boulder is lying at the base of the hilltop, prised up out of the
 hole it was in. The boulder is resting on a spade blade. There's just
 enough room to squeeze into the cave behind it.

>wait
 Time passes.

 From within some tall grass, you notice a pair of dark eyes. The grass
 blinks, and then it is a small, orange fox who watches you solemnly.

>throw stick
 The fox cocks its head as you wind up; it tenses to spring, and you
 hurl the stick far back into the undergrowth. With a yip the fox
 streaks after it.

 A moment later it's back, bushy tail high. It drops its prize at your
 feet.

 Stone dissolves around you as move up and forwards, into a grainy grey
 light. A mindless roar stretches in all directions; but it is troubled

 Small Cave
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.
 It is not quite high enough to stand in, but surprisingly long,
 narrowing only slowly towards the back. The entrance is a dim circle of

 The voices are still audible. They surge and swell, on the edge of
 audibility, somewhere to the west. You are almost certain you hear your

 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. A black expanse
 stretches to the north and west, impenetrable with rain. Every few
 moments, a directionless flicker of lightning tries to pull detail from
 the darkness; but there is only mist.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 A stream of runoff water is flowing down from the southeast, and
 pouring down the trench to the unseen stream below.

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the north. It's
 right in the gap in the northern path.

 An old shed stands just to the east. It's weathered but sturdy, still
 wearing the tatters of a coat of white paint. The door is closed.

>dig undergrowth
 You can't see any such thing.

>go north
 You heft the broken spade, considering your balance. You stretch a foot
 towards the bush, shift your weight, and take two quick steps. The bush
 trembles but holds.

 Steep Face

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the south. It's
 right in the gap in the southern path.

 Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
 stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you
 might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.

 The moment is gone. The sun has set, although the clouds are still
 well-lit.

 You catch a pair of dark eyes in the edge of your vision; then they are
 gone.

>go northwest

 Rocky Outlook

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.

 A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER is now in its "verbose" mode, which always

 before).

>go east
 The trail turns southeast as it climbs.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, meadows fade in the last light. Behind you stands
 the last stony lump of hill. A narrow trail curves away to the
 northwest.

 A boulder is half-buried at the base of the hilltop.

 The fox appears under a nearby bush.

>throw stick
 Thrown.

 The fox darts at something in the undergrowth.

>get stick

>wedge spade

>in boulder

>pry boulder
 As you lean over the boulder, you notice a cave of some sort behind it.

 You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave -- fruitlessly. It's
 well sunk into the ground.

 The sky is dimming, and a mist is rolling in, under the clouds.

>lift boulder

>insert spade

>in boulder

 You push the spade under the boulder, kick the blade to settle it, and

 harder, and the boulder starts to move, and

 Crack!

 The spade's shaft has broken off in your hands, right above the blade,
 which is now caught under the boulder. On the other hand, you've moved
 the boulder up out of its hole; it's balanced on the rim.

>get boulder
 The boulder is too heavy to lift.

 Small Cave
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.
 It is not quite high enough to stand in, but surprisingly long,
 narrowing only slowly towards the back. The entrance is a lit circle of
 grey to the west, partially obscured by the boulder.

 An ancient and filthy blanket is crumpled against one wall of the cave.

>examine blanket
 It's a ratty old blanket, torn and mouse-chewed, tangled with bits of
 twig and old leaves. Nonetheless, it looks warm.

 You crawl out.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, meadows fade in the mist. Behind you stands the

 A boulder is lying at the base of the hilltop, prised up out of the

 The fox glances at you, or perhaps something you hold.

 You wind up and hurl the stick into the undergrowth. The fox turn to

 that's entirely a matter between you and the stick.

 Stone dissolves around you as move up and forwards, into a grainy grey
 light. A mindless roar stretches in all directions; but it is troubled
 by a distant murmur. The new sound swells, whispering, pounding, then
 shouting at you, and you cannot make it out and you cannot make it go

 Something awakens you.

 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. A black expanse

 moments, a directionless flicker of lightning tries to pull detail from
 the darkness; but there is only mist.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 A stream of runoff water is flowing down from the southeast, and
 pouring down the trench to the unseen stream below.

 You awaken in the cave, sore and cold, bathed in the listless light of
 an overcast dawn. By the time you wade across the swollen stream,
 you're as soaked and miserable as if you'd slept out in the rain after

 lovely cough.

 The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered
 away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's
 just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend
 cook-out isn't the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is
 an appealing thought.

 None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

 Edge Of Meadow
 The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
 afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old
 wooden bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a
 scrubby hillside stretches upward.

 The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are
 pleasantly far off to the west.

>go east
 The bridge creaks as you cross it, and sways a bit.

 Stream Bank
 A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge
 which spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the
 east rises the flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight;
 two usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.

>go south

 Wildflowers
 Elsewhere in the park, flowers lie in hollows and peek out from under
 the brush. Here you have found a profusion of them. Sprays of white and
 blue lie everywhere; the vines ripple yellow.

 Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the
 stream. A trail leads northward towards the bridge; another heads
 steeply up to the east, and a third curves around the hill to the
 southeast.

 A glint in a nearby bush looks more metallic than floral.

>get glint

>go north

>fill bucket
 You fill the bucket with water.

 From within some tall grass, you notice a pair of dark eyes. The grass

>go northeast

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
 with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.
 In the distance, a lake reflects white fire from the setting sun.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
 Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using
 the spade to dig the trench, and you can also figure why he stopped;
 the shaft is broken off about two feet up from the blade. The handle
 end is nowhere in sight.

 The sun is lazily approaching the horizon.

 The fox appears on a nearby rock.

>pour water
 What do you want to pour the quantity of water on?

>mud
 You splash the water around the spade. The mud absorbs it greedily.

>get spade
 The broken spade slides free of the mud.

>go east
 The trail turns southeast as it climbs.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, meadows glow in the thickening sunlight. Behind
 you stands the last stony lump of hill. A narrow trail curves away to
 the northwest.

 A boulder is half-buried at the base of the hilltop.

>pry boulder with spade
 You notice a cave of some sort behind the boulder. (Who would have
 guessed?)

 You push the spade under the boulder, kick the blade to settle it, and
 lean on the shaft. Nothing happens for a moment, and you're leaning
 harder, and the boulder starts to move, and

 Crack!

 The spade's shaft has broken off in your hands, right above the blade,
 which is now caught under the boulder. On the other hand, you've moved
 the boulder up out of its hole; it's balanced on the rim.

 feet.

 You can also see a broken spade shaft here.

 Small Cave
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.

 narrowing only slowly towards the back. The entrance is a circle of
 scarlet and gold to the west, partially obscured by the boulder.

 An ancient and filthy blanket is crumpled against one wall of the cave.

 by a distant murmur. The new sound swells, whispering, pounding, then
 shouting at you, and you cannot make it out and you cannot make it go
 --


 Something awakens you.

 Small Cave
 You are in a dark pocket, a stony crack below the summit of the hill.
 It is not quite high enough to stand in, but surprisingly long,
 narrowing only slowly towards the back. The entrance is a dim circle of
 grey to the west, partially obscured by the boulder.

 The voices are still audible. They surge and swell, on the edge of
 audibility, somewhere to the west. You are almost certain you hear your
 name being called.

>go west
 You crawl out. The rain lashes your face.

 Near Top of Hill

 A boulder is lying at the base of the hilltop, prised up out of the
 hole it was in. The boulder is resting on a spade blade. There's just
 enough room to squeeze into the cave behind it.

 The blanket has gotten quite soaked.

 The trail turns west as it descends.

 Rocky Outlook

 A stream of runoff water is flowing down from the southeast, and
 pouring down the trench to the unseen stream below.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.

 A no-time, eternal instant of light lances through you, snapping your
 mind to silence. A moment later the silence is broken by a

 Crack!

 of thunder.

 Afterimages hang around you in a greenish glare. You blink furiously,
 trying to sort out the shadows from what's really there.

>se

 Steep Face
 You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface. Rain
 hides the stream below and the hilltop above, and to the west is only
 dark.

 Trails angle down to the northwest and southwest. Another crosses the
 hill to the south, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the south. It's
 right in the gap in the southern path. You could probably use it to get
 across. (One of those little coincidences that makes your life a little
 nicer.)

 Runoff water is flowing down the hillside here. It puddles on the
 ledge, and streams down the northwest path.

 Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
 stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you
 might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.

 The afterimages evaporate into a black dazzle.

>go south
 You stretch a foot towards the bush, shift your weight, and take two
 quick steps. The bush trembles but holds.

 Edge of Bluff
 You are in a dense tangle of shadow, bushes, and small trees. The
 ground falls away to the southeast, into darkness and rain.

 A trail curves down to the southwest. Another cuts along the hill to
 the north, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the north. It's
 right in the gap in the northern path.

 An old shed stands just to the east. It's weathered but sturdy, still
 wearing the tatters of a coat of white paint. The door is closed.

 The voices surge, then fade.

>unlock shed
 What do you want to unlock the old shed with?

>key
 The lock is stiff. You give the key a jerk; the latch scrapes, and the
 door swings open.

 That's odd. The steel key doesn't seem as rusty as you first thought.

>go east
 You step hesitantly into the darkness.

 Darkness
 You feel the hollow darkness of an enclosed space. To the west, an
 oblong of flat grey half-light betrays the doorway. Nothing else is
 visible.

>wait
 Time passes.

 A no-time, eternal instant of light lances through you, snapping your
 mind to silence. A moment later the silence is broken by a

 Crack!

 of thunder from outside.

 The pure white fades into a greenish glare. Flat colored shadows show
 the outlines of everything around you; you hold your head still to
 focus on the afterimages.

 In a Small Shed
 The shed is only a few paces long, and nearly empty. The door is to the
 west.

 A pair of large canvas bags is piled untidily here. One is rather
 dirty; the other has a tear along one seam, from which sand dribbles
 onto the ground.

 The voices surge, then fade.

>get torn
 You heave the torn sandbag, awkwardly, up into your arms. You manage to
 do it without straining the torn cloth further.

 The afterimages evaporate into a black dazzle.

 It is dark.

 unrelieved darkness within.

 A no-time, eternal instant of light lances through you, snapping your

 Crack!

 of thunder. It is echoed by a splintering crash from the north.

 Afterimages hang around you in a greenish glare. You blink furiously,
 trying to sort out the shadows from what's really there.

>go north
 You heft the torn sandbag, considering your balance. You stretch a foot
 towards the bush, shift your weight, and take two quick steps. The bush
 trembles but holds.

 Steep Face

 A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the south. It's
 right in the gap in the southern path.

 The lone tree has been laid low. About ten feet still sticks up from
 the ground; the rest lies across the path and downslope, splintered and
 scorched.

 A heavy branch seems to have been blown from the tree. It lies on the
 ground nearby. One end is still burning.

 Runoff water is flowing down the hillside here. It puddles on the
 ledge, behind the fallen tree.

 The runoff water begins to spill out from behind the tree, down the
 southwest path.

 The afterimages evaporate into a black dazzle.

 The voices surge, then fade.

>go southwest
 The trail turns west as it descends.

 Wildflowers

 The trickle of rainwater coming down the east path gains strength.
 Rapidly it becomes a small torrent.

>go north

 Stream Bank

 The trickle of runoff coming down the south path gains strength.
 Rapidly it becomes a small torrent.

 The runoff water is pouring down to the stream, right over the bridge
 pilings. The muddy earth below the bridge is wearing away.

 The voices surge, and you realize the sounds comes from the west, from
 the other side of the stream. And they are coming closer. You are very
 sure, suddenly, that you do not want them to reach you.

>drop torn
 You lower the torn sandbag to the ground, trying not to strain it.

 The runoff water is backing up behind the torn sandbag.

 You jerk as a shape darts past you. Wild orange fury -- it's the fox,
 hurtling up onto the bridge like an avenging spirit. The fox crouches
 on the wet planks and stares fiercely out to the west.

 The distant murmur of voices, across the bridge, seems closer now.

>go northeast

>push boulder
 You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave. It goes tumbling
 straight down the hill to the west, out of sight. A few moments later
 you hear a rending

 Crack!

 You feel a freezing rush down your back, and you know without seeing
 that the bridge below has been destroyed. You begin to rush downhill,
 but the trail seems to stretch and time takes on the weight of
 nightmare...



 [Hit any key.]
>push boulder








 You awaken in the cave, sore and cold, bathed in the listless light of
 an overcast dawn. By the time you wade across the swollen stream,
 you're as soaked and miserable as if you'd slept out in the rain after
 all. You reach civilization exhausted and with what promises to be a
 lovely cough.

 hole it was in. The boulder is resting on a spade blade. There's just
 enough room to squeeze into the cave behind it.

 The blanket has gotten quite soaked.

 Near Top of Hill
 You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond
 the trees and brush, the world is cloaked in dark rain, and scarred
 with distant lightning. Behind you stands the last stony lump of hill.
 A narrow trail curves away to the northwest.

 The voices surge, then fade.

>push boulder sw
 You grasp the boulder as best you can and heave. It goes tumbling down
 the hill to the south, curving west with the slope. A few moments later
 you hear a small snap.

 A no-time, eternal instant of light lances through you, snapping your
 mind to silence. A moment later the silence is broken by a

 Crack!

 of thunder.

 Afterimages hang around you in a greenish glare. You blink furiously,
 trying to sort out the shadows from what's really there.

 Rocky Outlook

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.

 Steep Face

 The bush seems to have been utterly demolished by the falling boulder.
 Nothing is left in the crack but a couple of splinters. (One of those
 little coincidences that makes your life a little stranger.)

 The lone tree has been laid low. About ten feet still sticks up from
 the ground; the rest lies across the path and downslope, splintered and
 scorched.

 A heavy branch seems to have been blown from the tree. It lies on the
 ground nearby, blackened but no longer burning.

 Runoff water is flowing down the hillside here. It puddles on the
 ledge, behind the fallen tree, and streams down the southwest path.

>get branch
 Taken.

>wedge blade in crack
 The spade blade slips into the crack. You stretch and give it a couple
 of whacks, to wedge it in place.

>go south
 You heft the heavy branch, considering your balance. You realize that
 you'll never make it across. The blade only sticks out a few inches
 from the hillside; you'd be off-balance enough by yourself, never mind
 what you're carrying.

 Darkness
 You feel the hollow darkness of an enclosed space. To the west, an
 oblong of flat grey half-light betrays the doorway. Nothing else is
 visible.

 The voices surge, then fade.

>go west

 Edge of Bluff

 The spade blade is jammed into a crack in the hillside, to the north.
 It's right in the gap in the northern path.

 An old shed stands just to the east. It's weathered but sturdy, still
 wearing the tatters of a coat of white paint. The door is open to the
 unrelieved darkness within.

>throw bag north
 You heave the dirty sandbag across the gap; it thuds onto the trail on
 the other side.

>go north
 You flatten your body against the hillside, and stretch a foot towards
 the spade blade, off-center though you'll be. One quick step; you
 manage to fall forward onto the trail rather than sideways.

 Runoff water is flowing down the hillside here. It puddles on the

 sandbag is lying in the torrent, but the path is too wide here; the
 water pours around it.

 From somewhere below, you hear a terrible

 Crack!

 You know without seeing that the bridge has been destroyed. You begin
 to rush downhill, but the trail seems to stretch and time takes on the
 weight of nightmare...



 [Hit any key.]
>go north








 You awaken in the cave, sore and cold, bathed in the listless light of
 an overcast dawn. By the time you wade across the swollen stream,
 you're as soaked and miserable as if you'd slept out in the rain after
 all. You reach civilization exhausted and with what promises to be a
 lovely cough.

 You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface. Rain

 Trails angle down to the northwest and southwest. Another crosses the

 The pure white fades into a greenish glare. Flat colored shadows show

 You were right; the bridge has been neatly demolished, and the boulder
 sits innocently in the stream, in the wreckage. So much for your little
 exploration. You go off, resigned, to tell the park rangers what you've
 done.

 Rocky Outlook
 A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
 off to the north and west, a vast expanse of dim meadowland, patched
 with dark woods and stitched with dark streams. A layer of mist is
 rolling across the landscape.

 A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
 you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
 hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.

 Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.

 The mist is turning to a drizzle of rain.

 The fox appears under a nearby bush.

>go down

 Stream Bank
 A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge
 which spans it leans uncertainly against the bank at your feet. To the
 east rises the flank of the hill, a dark shape in the twilight; two
 usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.

>go south

 Wildflowers
 A profusion of flowers lie here, mostly furled against the rain. Edges
 of white and blue and yellow show in the dim light.

 Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the
 stream. A trail leads northward towards the bridge; another heads
 steeply up to the east, and a third curves around the hill to the
 southeast.

 The boulder is lying near here, on the path, wedged against the rise.

>go east
 The trail turns northeast as it climbs.

 Steep Face
 You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface. Mist
 hides the stream below and the hilltop above, but the meadows and
 clouds beyond sweep away into the west.

 Trails angle down to the northwest and southwest. Another crosses the
 hill to the south, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.

 The bush seems to have been utterly demolished by the falling boulder.
 Nothing is left in the crack but a couple of splinters. (One of those
 little coincidences that makes your life a little stranger.)

 Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
 stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you
 might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.

 the path to the northwest.
