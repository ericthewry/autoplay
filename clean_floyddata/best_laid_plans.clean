 The research had been going well. Perhaps too well. Genetic cloning,
 DNA re-sampling, facial morphing - you name it, the Merrowvale
 Institute in Bizan'Toll was doing it. You're just a small cog in the
 big wheel that is MI but you have a house in the hills, a company car
 and vacation for a month every year in the Balmoras. You also get to
 work in the twin cities of Bizan'Toll themelves, which is worth its
 weight in gold. A good life, in other words. You've made plans to stay
 here once your research is concluded. But like all plans...

 Rival companies don't appreciate the leaps and bounds MI have been
 making, and enemies are quick to close in. Very deadly enemies. Some
 people scoffed at the idea of an attack by a rival company. Scott
 Talbot was one. He's not scoffing now. He's face down on the floor of
 his lab with a bullet hole between his eyes.

 You they didn't kill. You they just grabbed, frog-marched out of the
 lab, past the still warm body of Scott Talbot, and up several flights
 of stairs to here. Your cell. What they're planning on doing with you
 next is anyone's guess, but something tells you that you're best
 getting out of here before you find out.

 You and SADI.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Cell</span>
 You don't like to think of this as your cell, but that's essentially
 what it is: a small room, pretty much devoid of decoration, a place
 secure enough for you to be locked in without any obvious means of
 escape. There is a door (locked) in the east wall, barring the room's
 only exit. There's also a window, but it's locked tight and, in any
 event, too small to climb out of.

 A rickety wooden chair sits on the floor.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   SADI (being worn)

>examine sadi

 SADI: Scenery Adjustment Device Interface. Ingenious device, bad
 title.

 The rumour is that the guy who designed it had a girlfriend called
 Sadi and really wanted to name his device after her, and Scenery
 Adjustment Device Interface was the best he could come up with.
 Whether that's true or not you aren't sure.

 SADI is a watch-like device currently affixed to your wrist. Probably
 the only reason you still have it is that people assumed it
 <span class="floydstyle em">was</span> a watch. Operating it is simple, though caution is
 advised. Early prototypes left people without arms and legs, or even a
 head on one occasion, but this latest version (hopefully!) is
 incapable of harming a human. It is able to ABSORB {any} item you can
 see - within reason - and then RELEASE {any} item elsewhere - again
 within reason.

 There is an icon on the side of SADI, but it is dull and greyed out.

>examine icon

 Dull and greyed out.

>examine chair

 You see nothing special about the chair.

>absorb chair

 SADI emits a buzzing sound and the chair winks out of existence.

 There is a flashing icon on the side of SADI in the shape of a chair.

>examine me

 What's to say? You're you. Twenty-five or so, spend way too long
 working in labs and not enough in the open air, prefer classical music
 to jazz, think it might be nice to have kids one day but don't want to
 jeopardise your career for them, and the crowning achievement of your
 life so far is being allowed to come to Bizan'Toll to study the
 remarkable things they're doing here - but, in light of what's
 happened today, you're seriously wishing you'd stayed at home. Your
 father wanted you to be a doctor, your mother a lawyer. Both
 professions that don't involve men with guns trying to kill you.

>absorb door

 SADI emits a groaning sound. By the look of things, it's reached its
 current capacity.

>release door

>release chair

 SADI emits a whistling sound, and the chair reappears in its original
 location.

>absorb door

 SADI emits a beep, and the door flickers once then is gone, leaving
 just the doorway behind.

>absorb chair

 SADI emits a groaning sound. By the look of things, it's reached its
 current capacity.

>take door

 You can't see any such thing.

>take chair

 Taking items isn't easy with SADI on your wrist as she tends to try
 and absorb or alter any items you come into contact with. It took
 weeks to teach her not to absorb your clothes, and any meals you eat
 need to be eaten quickly before she has time to affect them.

 Sometimes, AI isn't all it's cracked up to be.

>alter chair

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Cell</span>
 You don't like to think of this as your cell, but that's essentially
 what it is: a small room, pretty much devoid of decoration, a place
 secure enough for you to be locked in without any obvious means of
 escape... unless, of course, you happen to have used a certain
 ingenious device to absorb the previously locked door in the east
 wall. There's also a window, but it's locked tight and, in any event,
 too small to climb out of.

 A rickety wooden chair sits on the floor.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A Short Corridor</span>
 You're in a corridor just outside the room formerly known as your
 cell. It's a short corridor with nothing much to recommend it: just 20
 feet in length with a flight of stairs at the north end leading
 downwards and your former cell to the west. Above your head, you see a
 security alarm fitted to the ceiling. A large wooden panel covers the
 east wall.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Of course, as you might imagine, not everyone can use a device</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">like SADI. Can you imagine the chaos if everyone was running around</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">with their own little version of SADI, moving scenery at will and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">messing with the very building blocks of creation? No, you don't want</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to imagine what it would be like because it wouldn't be pleasant.</span>


>release door

 SADI emits a whistling sound, and the door reappears in its original
 location. The way into your cell is once more blocked, only this time
 you're outside the cell.

>examine panel

 A metallic panel clinging the wall.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Everyone who can use a device like SADI is special. You have</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">powers. The powers are, alas, nothing very special in themselves. You</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">can't leap tall buildings, or lift a car above your head, or cause</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">bullets to bounce off your chin, but you can - though it doesn't</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">always work - get a bad feeling about certain things. And it allows</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you to use SADI.</span>


>absorb panel

 SADI beeps and the panel vanishes. A storage room is revealed on the
 other side.

>examine storage room

 A storage room, previously hidden by the panel you absorbed.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Your abilities have off days. Like today. Of all the days when you</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">could really have benefited from them - when men with guns are coming</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for you! - and you don't get even a twinge warning you of danger.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">But you suppose you should thank your lucky stars you can at least</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">use SADI. If not for that, you'd still be trapped in your cell.</span>


>examine alarm

 It looks fairly innocent, but you get the distinct impression it's
 anything but. Leave the building with this still working, and you'll
 have alarms ringing from one side of Bizan'Toll to the other. You're
 fairly certain you can disable it if you need to, but you can't even
 reach it from down here.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storage Room</span>
 A small room, hidden until you removed the wooden panel in the western
 wall. A single shelf clings to the wall, its surface covered with
 dust. There is a table in the middle of the room but little else of
 interest. One odd thing you notice is the distinct lack of other exits
 - was this room sealed off at some point and simply forgotten?

>examine table

 A rickety table, which looks to be very close to simply collapsing
 altogether. Atop it, someone has drawn a crude map. It appears to be
 of the very building you're standing in right now.

>examine map

 A map of the very building you're currently trapped in. Ideally you
 shouldn't need a map of a building, especially one you work in every
 day, but the building is actually very large and it's easy to get
 lost. As most of the map details areas of the building that are
 inaccessible to you (unless you care to get shot), it's not of much
 use, but you see one oddity that draws your attention: namely, a
 jagged line drawn in the wall of the room which was originally your
 cell. And a symbol next to this indicating "darkness" in Bizan'Toll
 terms. You wonder what it means.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

>release panel

 SADI emits a whistling sound, and the panel appears out of nowhere and
 attaches itself to the nearest wall.

>absorb southern wall

 SADI emits a frustrated beeping sound. Unfortunately, everything has
 limits, and SADI is no exception. Walls are one of the items of
 scenery it generally struggles with - as a rule because walls are
 attached to other walls, and often have foundations in the ground, so
 absorbing them is not as simple as absorbing, say, a pencil.

>out

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>go west

 The panel is in the way.

>absorb panel

 SADI beeps and the panel vanishes. The exit to the west is now open
 once more.

>go west

 security alarm fitted to the ceiling. To the east, you can see a
 previously hidden storage room.

>release panel

 SADI emits a whistling sound, and the panel reappears in its original
 location, once more blocking off the storage room to the east.

>absorb door

 SADI emits a beep, and the door flickers once then is gone. You can
 once more see your cell to the west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Cell</span>

 A dust-smeared window set into the wall.

>release door

 SADI emits a whistling sound, and the door reappears in its original
 location.

>absorb window

 SADI emits a beep, and the window flickers out of existence, leaving
 behind a hole in the wall.

 You don't like to think of this as your cell, but that's essentially

 secure enough for you to be locked in without any obvious means of
 escape. There is a door (locked) in the east wall, barring the room's

 A rickety wooden chair sits on the floor.

>examine hole

 A gaping hole in the wall, left behind when you absorbed the window.
 If you were hoping to escape this way, think again. The hole is far
 too small to climb through.

>look through hole

 You see nothing much on the other side. Just emptiness. Pity. Even
 with the window out of the way, there's no chance you'll be able to
 escape out of the hole.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A Short Corridor</span>
 You're in a corridor just outside the room formerly known as your

 feet in length with a flight of stairs at the north end leading
 downwards and your former cell to the west. Above your head, you see a
 security alarm fitted to the ceiling. A large wooden panel covers the
 east wall.

>go north

 You can't go that way.

>examine stairs

 A flight of stairs leading down to the north end of the corridor.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of the Steps</span>
 The stairs continue further downwards, but there's a metal gate
 blocking the way. North of here is a doorway leading to the science
 labs, including the one you were taken from and where your colleague,
 Scott Talbot, was shot dead. You hear voices coming from that
 direction, and the sound of footsteps, but can see nothing aside from
 an empty corridor.

>release door

 SADI emits a buzzing sound and the door is released. By happy
 coincidence, it's the same size and shape as the door which originally
 occupied this doorway, and, as the necessary parameters have been met,
 your cell door takes the place of the old one.

 The northern corridor is now blocked off.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your score has just gone up by one point.]</span>

 You hear nothing unexpected.

 SADI beeps and the panel reappears. As it is meant to be attached to
 something, it gravitates towards the window, covering it entirely.

 SADI emits a confused buzzing sound. It seems it is having trouble
 distinguishing between the series of marks and the wall they're on,

 SADI emits a whistling sound, and the chair appears on the floor.

>climb chair

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>absorb alarm

 As you aim SADI at the security alarm, you experience the feeling that
 this is a bad, bad idea. What if the security alarm is linked to some
 external device? What if removing the security alarm causes that
 external device to sound an alert? Until you can be certain this won't
 happen, you daren't risk trying to absorb the security alarm.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storage Room</span>
 A small room, hidden until you removed the wooden panel in the western
 wall. A single shelf clings to the wall, its surface covered with
 dust. There is a table in the middle of the room but little else of
 interest. One odd thing you notice is the distinct lack of other exits
 - was this room sealed off at some point and simply forgotten?

>absorb table

 SADI emits a beep, and the table flickers out of existence. A
 trapdoor, previously hidden by the table, is revealed in the floor.

>open door

 The door may have changed locations, but that doesn't alter the fact
 that it's locked and you still don't have the key for it.

>open trapdoor

 It appears to be locked and you don't have any means of opening it.

 The surface is rusted and pitted with age. By the look of things, this
 hasn't been opened in a long, long time.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A Short Corridor</span>
 You're in a corridor just outside the room formerly known as your

 feet in length with a flight of stairs at the north end leading
 downwards and your former cell to the west. Above your head, you see a
 security alarm fitted to the ceiling. To the east, you can see a
 previously hidden storage room.

 the floor where the table originally stood is a trapdoor (currently

>absorb trapdoor

 SADI emits a frustrated buzzing sound. It seems that it is having
 trouble differentiating between the trapdoor and the floor and, as
 such, it is unable to absorb one without absorbing the other. And as
 SADI is unable to absorb something as large as the floor, it cannot
 absorb anything.

 You don't like to think of this as your cell, but that's essentially

 secure enough for you to be locked in without any obvious means of
 escape... unless, of course, you happen to have used a certain
 ingenious device to absorb the previously locked door in the east
 wall. The window is now blocked by the panel and the room is much
 darker as a result. Against one wall you can see a series of marks
 that you hadn't noticed before. Some chemical substance, no doubt,

 It looks fairly innocent, but you get the distinct impression it's

 have alarms ringing from one side of Bizan'Toll to the other. You're
 fairly certain you can disable it, however. The design looks pretty
 straightforward.

 That's not something you can open.

 You haven't had much call to disable security alarms, but this one is

 As you start through the doorway, you hear the unmistakeable crackle

 are other shots followed by silence.

 On second thoughts, you'd better not head that way.

>enter crawlspace

 Knowing this is your best bet of getting out of here, you enter the
 crawlspace. It's cramped, and this does wonders for your age old dread
 of being in enclosed spaces, but you don't want to end up shot dead
 the way Scott Talbot was so you grit your teeth and keep on crawling.

 You find the crawlspace sloping sharply downwards. A decision is
 called for. Go ahead or turn back?

 Actually, it's not a decision at all. Turning back means returning to
 your cell, and that might well end with your death. Going ahead at
 least gives you a chance of getting out of this in one piece.

 So you take a deep breath, cross your fingers for luck, and keep
 crawling.

 As the crawlspace slopes down more and more sharply, you find yourself
 beginning to slide forward. You try to grab hold of the sides in an
 attempt to slow yourself down. No use.

 With a cry, you fall...

 It is a wet, disgusting day in the middle of April. You are just about
 sick of the rain. You're just about sick of everything. They keep
 telling you, when you turn sixteen you can do what you like and live
 where you like. But you aren't sixteen, and until then you've got to
 do what they say. "They" are a procession of incompetent adults,
 colloquially called "social workers," culminating in the buffoon that
 has brought you here. Mr. Henrico.

 Apparently, he is the idiotic little man who tracked down your
 grandmother. The same grandmother who never visited you, or sent you
 anything, or even spoke to you. And he's decided you're going to go
 live with her on some horrible little island. You are so excited. You
 have just spent the last four hours listening to him talk, and it
 doesn't look like he's done.

 Press any key...
>ANY KEY

 want to talk about first?"

 useful.

 The two people are your parents, about fifteen years younger than you
 remember them.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On a boardwalk beside the sea</span>
 This simple wooden pier juts into the sea. Pylons, evenly spaced,
 provide perches for cawing gulls. Coils of <span class="floydstyle u1">rope</span> lie about
 here and there.On the horizon there is a smudge that might be the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">island</span>. Or a wave. It's hard to tell. You can't imagine how
 this could be any more boring. Or dreadful. Oh, and it has begun to
 rain.

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">angry pelican</span> swivels its head back and forth, peering at
 you from many angles.

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">hooded man</span> stands here in a black rain coat with the hood
 concealing his face.

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Mr. Henrico</span> stands here looking very droll and boring.

 You can also see a <span class="floydstyle u1">garish sign</span> and a <span class="floydstyle u1">ferry</span> here.

 A constant patter of rain falls about you.

>examine rope

 There are a few coils of rope tossed about the pier. One looks
 interesting... No, never mind. It's just a coil of rope.

 In the <span class="floydstyle u1">coil of rope</span> is a <span class="floydstyle u1">mackerel</span>.

 A constant patter of rain falls about you.

>examine island

 That smudge on the horizon might be the island. The tall thing
 sticking out of it, with the spinning light on the top, might be the
 <span class="floydstyle u1">lighthouse</span>. It might also not be, but you have to admit that,
 at this point, it probably is.

 This is a basic fishing pole. You can <span class="floydstyle u1">cast</span> it anywhere you
 find a body of water. When a fish bites, <span class="floydstyle u1">reel</span> it in. You
 could try different hooks, just tie them on. There are also different
 kinds of bait. Try baiting the hook with something.
 There is <span class="floydstyle u1">rusty hook</span> on the end of the line.

 The ferry is a squat little boat with little cliche <span class="floydstyle u1">life</span>

>get on boat

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">angry pelican</span> won't move out of the way. It's standing
 right in the perfect spot to stop you and it's doing so in a very
 angry way. Your mother always tells you how angry you get when you're
 hungry. <span class="floydstyle u1">Maybe you should feed the fish to the pelican</span>.

 You get into the <span class="floydstyle u1">ferry</span>.

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">somber woman</span> hides herself under her wide sun hat. Every
 time you look at her, she's just then turning away.

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">salty sea man</span> mills about, doing something to his boat.
 You can't tell what, but it seems to involve pushing dirt about with a
 rag.

 As the ferry powers up to pull away from the dock, the <span class="floydstyle u1">angry</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">pelican</span> hops from the boardwalk to the ferry. Apparently, the
 bird is too lazy to fly to the island itself.

 "First time on the island, isn't it?" the <span class="floydstyle u1">salty sea man</span> asks.
 "Well, I hope you like it. It's not a terribly big island and hardly
 anyone visits anymore. Yep, because the only way there is a ride in my
 ferry!"

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">salty sea man</span> asks, "So lass, you got any questions
 before we get there? Now's your chance to ask."

 You could ask the <span class="floydstyle u1">salty sea man</span> about <span class="floydstyle u1">himself</span>,

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span> chews on a <span class="floydstyle u1">pipe</span> yellowed from long
 years of use.  He wears a long <span class="floydstyle u1">beard</span> on a deeply lined face.
 Your overall impression of <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span> is one of
 shabbiness. It is possible that the newest thing he wears is the brass
 fishing <span class="floydstyle u1">hook</span> he has used as a button to hold his shirt
 closed.

 A constant patter of rain falls about you.

>ask spider about treasure

 "Yep, treasure. Buried right here on this island too. I know it's here

 A constant patter of rain falls about you.

 The wind picks up and suddenly, rather than a moderate chop, waves
 smash against the ferry from all sides. Lightning flashes from the sky
 and rain pours from the heaven in torrents between the rolling
 thunder.

 "Going to be a bit of chop," <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span> says. Your
 stomach does not like this news at all.

 (You could ask <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span> about <span class="floydstyle u1">Akkoteaque</span> or
 the <span class="floydstyle u1">ferry</span>.)

>examine pelican

 You're pretty sure birds can scowl. You're looking at one doing it
 right now.
 Half a fish hangs from the pelican's beak. Normally, this situation
 would make a pelican pretty happy. Not this pelican.

 Rain and wind lash out of the sky.

 Rain and wind lash out of the sky.

 A bolt of lightning stabs out of the sky and strikes the lighthouse.
 For a moment, while the bolt is etched across your vision, nothing
 happens, then the sound comes rolling over the boat and makes
 everything shake. Behind the thunder comes another sound, an
 electrical popping, and the lighthouse seems to glow at the base. At
 it's top, the light vanishes.

 Your stomach has had it with the waves. You rush to the railing as
 your lunch rushes up your throat, and then you don't do much of
 interest besides puke your guts out for the rest of the trip.

 This little wooden dock has definitely seen better days, but still
 seems to be going strong. It juts into the sea from the base of a
 cliff. Many <span class="floydstyle u1">seagulls</span> wheel about in the sky above.

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span> stands at the controls of the ferry.

 You can also see a <span class="floydstyle u1">ferry</span> and a <span class="floydstyle u1">gas can</span> here.

 You can only go <span class="floydstyle u1">east</span> from here.

 "You all right lass?" <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span> asks. "Had a touch of
 sea sickness, you did. We're here, anyway. Best damn island this side
 of Delmarva."

 You see nothing unexpected about the <span class="floydstyle u1">gas can</span>.

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">gas can</span> contains gasoline.

>take it

 Taken.

>examine seagulls

 Many gulls circle overhead hoping you might drop some scrap for them.
 One of them keeps returning to a narrow <span class="floydstyle u1">cleft</span> in the face of
 the cliff.

>examine cleft

 There is a narrow cleft in the cliff just wide enough for a gull to
 scamper through. It looks like one of them as built a <span class="floydstyle u1">nest</span> in
 there. It's not very high.

 The <span class="floydstyle u1">nest</span> is too far away to get a good look.

>ask captain about akkoteaque

 "Island has always just been in the way," <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span>
 says. "Nothing but a bunch of rocks and cliffs. They go straight up,
 all the way down, so when a ship hits it they don't hang around, no
 way. <span class="floydstyle u1">Lighthouse</span> is kind of important."

 (You could ask <span class="floydstyle u1">Captain Spider</span> about the <span class="floydstyle u1">ferry</span>.)

 The lighthouse is painted in alternating bands of red and white. At
 the top, there is a metal walkway.

 Thanks for playing the beginning of Akkoteaque! There's lots more to
 do on the island. I agonized for a while, but eventually decided I'd
 rather cut the game short then let players loose on a largely
 unfinished island. Here's what you can expect from the finished
 game...

 -Explore the lighthouse, the Lighthouse Inn, and the rest of the
 island.. including a spooky graveyard!
 -Be terrorized by a crazed pelican!
 -Meet lots of interesting characters, like Alabaster, the plaster
 salesman and amateur paranormal investigator!
 -Dig up a buried treasure!
 -Find out why your grandmother is so horrible!
 -Catch fish!
 -Solve lots of puzzles!
 -Find dozens of ciphered messages and probably never manage to decode
 them!

 I hope you enjoyed Akkoteaque. I'm always looking for more testers.

 I'm going to let you back into the world now. Why don't you try
 fishing? The fish head makes excellent bait.

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Elizabeth</span> hides herself under her wide sun hat. Every time
 you look at her, she's just then turning away.

 There is a <span class="floydstyle u1">raft of ducks</span> here. They seem preoccupied with
 their own internal politics and haven't any attention to spare for
 you.

 You can also see a <span class="floydstyle u1">sign post</span> and a <span class="floydstyle u1">tourist board</span>
 here.

 You can go
   <span class="floydstyle u1">north</span>

   <span class="floydstyle u1">east</span>
   <span class="floydstyle u1">west</span> (to Climbing a narrow stair)

>ask ducks about shoo

 A lone quack emits from one of the lesser ducks. The leader glares
 about but can't seem to tell who did it.

 You have nothing specific in mind to discuss with the <span class="floydstyle u1">raft of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">ducks</span> right now.

>cast

 There doesn't seem to be anywhere here to fish.

>catch ducks

 <span class="floydstyle em">[I didn't understand that sentence.]</span>

>examine tourist board

 A rectangular sign covered in information about the island. It is all
 incredibly boring. For example, the lighthouse was built in 1867. Why
 would anyone care about that?

>examine sign-post

 <span class="floydstyle em">[I didn't recognise all of the words in that command.]</span>

>examine sign post

 To the north is the inn and lighthouse. To the south is the chapel.
 The ferry is to the west, and the beach is to the east.

>climb sign post

 <span class="floydstyle em">[That can't be climbed in that way. Sometimes a direction like</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">"up" or "down" works instead.]</span>

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Climbing a narrow stair</span>
 A narrow stair climbs through a seam in the rocks from the jetty to
 the top of the island cliffs. The steps are carved from the rock
 itself. <span class="floydstyle u1">Vines</span> covered in tiny white flowers hide the rough
 rock walls.

 You can go
   <span class="floydstyle u1">south</span> (to In a haphazard shack on the edge of a cliff)
   <span class="floydstyle u1">east</span> (to At a crossing of paths)
   <span class="floydstyle u1">west</span> (to On a small pier)

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In a haphazard shack on the edge of a cliff</span>
 This shack is built right onto the side of the cliff, physics be
 damned. It's rather damp, likely due to it being suspended over the
 sea, but otherwise it's quite nice. There are some nautical themed
 <span class="floydstyle u1">posters</span> on the walls and a little <span class="floydstyle u1">window</span> that looks
 out over the sea.


 You can see a <span class="floydstyle u1">ladder</span>, a <span class="floydstyle u1">bed</span> and a <span class="floydstyle u1">rusty</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">table</span> here.

 You can only go <span class="floydstyle u1">north</span> (to Climbing a narrow stair) from here.

 Taken.

 You give the vines an experimental tug. They aren't anchored all that
 strongly.
