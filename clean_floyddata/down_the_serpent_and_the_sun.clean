 "<span class="floydstyle em">Poh</span>! I'm short a hundred florins on rent money!"

 Lorenzo snickers. "I'll give you a hundred to spend the night in Count
 Ruggino's house."

 "I'll do it! Wait. Why Ruggino's?"

 "He's a suicide. They say his house is haunted."

 "Haunted? I don't believe in ghosts."

 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 Count Ruggino's house lours in the dim air like a gathering of
 gravestones. The road makes a circle before it, then runs north back
 to Firenze.

 A heavy wooden door leads in to the south.

 A statue stands in the center of a dry fountain.

>examine statue


 A statue in grey stone, of a grim-faced angel with arms crossed over
 chest.

>examine fountain


 It's cracked all around and scaled with green-black scum.

 In the fountain is a brass key.

>examine sausage


 It is reminiscent of other sausages you have known.

>examine poniard


 A short dagger with a plastic handle. It would be useless against
 ghosts, but you don't believe in ghosts anyway.

>examine worm


 <span class="floydstyle em">The Return of the Worm</span> is a lurid Gothic best-seller in
 paperback, written by your friend Viviana. It is just the kind of tale
 to take your mind off this current outbreak of the Pestilence.

>examine sachet


 The scent of the herbs is meant to block out any pestilential fumes
 you might encounter.

>remember Lorenzo


 <span class="floydstyle em">Lorenzo, left arm akimbo, is holding out his right to shake on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">your wager. His hair is looking particularly shiny this morning.</span>

 Nothing comes to mind just now.

>remember viviana writing


 <span class="floydstyle em">Viviana is crouched over her typewriter in the tower garret of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Lorenzo's father's mansion. She looks up and shouts at you: "Get out!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Unless you have coffee."</span>

 You remember Viviana's typewriter.

>remember viviana's typewriter


 <span class="floydstyle em">It's a stormy evening, and Viviana's typewriter has a broken key.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">She is kind enough to let you try to fix it, though you actually only</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">manage to damage it further. "It's okay," she says, "Lorenzo's going</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to buy me a new one." There's a smudge of ink on the bridge of her</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">nose, and your hands are likewise stained.</span>

 You remember your first sight of Viviana.

>rememeber first sight of viviana


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>remember my first sight of viviana


 <span class="floydstyle em">Your first glimpse of Viviana is in a coffee shop stained red with</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">setting sunlight. She has a sheaf of manuscript pages with her, and is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">holding a red pen in her mouth while she shuffles them. The pen is</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">leaking, so it looks like a drop of blood is tracking down the side of</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">her chin.</span>

 You remember first meeting Viviana.

 You open the heavy wooden door.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Hall</span>
 A high-ceilinged hall whose walls press close side to side. The
 wallpaper hangs in moldy strips. The floor is warped and heaved like a
 road in winter. A staircase goes up.

 A heavy wooden door leads out to the north.

 There is a small hook on the wall. Hanging on the hook is an abstract
 painting.

>examine painting


 The painting is comprised of green, blue, pink and yellow arcs and
 wedges, and it seems to represent... hmm... a bouquet of flowers?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Hall</span>
 Dusty beams slant overhead like the branches of some neglected,

 has subsided. There is a stairway down, and a dusty room to the east.

>look under carpet

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedchamber</span>
 A chamber with a stifling atmosphere. The ceiling is a plaster dome,
 still intact, though marbled with ghostly mold. The floor is invisible
 beneath layered carpets and dust clots. The hall is west, and to the
 east is a doorway to a tiny balcony.

 In the center of the room is a four-poster bed.

 There is a small hook on the wall. Hanging on the hook is a forbidding
 portrait.

 Across from the bed is an armchair.

 On the armchair are a dusty, desiccated corpse and a gold-plated
 automatic pistol.

>examine pistol


 An expensive-looking, if also ridiculous-looking, gun.

>examine corpse


 This must be the unfortunate Count Ruggino. He's dried out and fragile
 as a mummy.

>take pistol


 Taken.

>look under bed


 Under the bed you find a suitcase. You fish it out.

>examine pillow


 A slip of foam inside a rag, or, a pathetically thin travel pillow.

>examine portrait


 An old man with an expression of steely confidence. Perhaps one of the
 more frightening Popes?

>look behind it


 You can't see any such thing.

>shoot portrait


 (first taking the forbidding portrait)
 Taken.

 A horrifying stain, formerly hidden by the forbidding portrait, is
 revealed on the wallpaper below the hook.

 The forbidding portrait lacks a trigger.

 pitchfork.

 You remember meeting Camilla.

>remember meeting camilla


 <span class="floydstyle em">A hot, wilted afternoon. Viviana has brought her friend Camilla to</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">Midnight is dead and in its grave. You are holding some dreadful</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">potion of Camilla's up to the light bulb: it looks like a cocktail of</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 This little railed platform sticks out like a wart from the top of
 Count Ruggino's house. What a view!

 You can see a torso, a withered head, and a withered leg here.

>drop arm


 Dropped.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedchamber</span>
 A chamber with a stifling atmosphere. The ceiling is a plaster dome,
 still intact, though marbled with ghostly mold. The floor is invisible
 beneath layered carpets and dust clots. The hall is west, and to the
 east is a doorway to a tiny balcony.

 In the center of the room is a four-poster bed.

 On the four poster bed is a travel pillow.

 There is a small hook on the wall. Hanging on the hook is an abstract
 painting.

 Across from the bed is an armchair.

 You can also see a pair of wingtip shoes, a pair of slacks, a silk
 shirt, a shiny black raincoat, an herbal sachet, a paperback book, a
 poniard, a brass key, a gold-plated automatic pistol, and a suitcase
 (empty) here.

>get on bed

 Your eyes close. Your breathing slows. Your cheek deadens against the

 You awaken at sunrise to find the bedchamber filled with rosy light.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Sunrise</span> (on the bed)
 You can't see much of anything due to the reddish light that floods
 the room via a narrow doorway to the east.

 You can't see much of anything due to the reddish light that floods
 the room via a narrow doorway to the east.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Red-lit Balcony</span>
 From the east shines an overpowering roseate light, though the sky is
 still dark, and speckled with stars like freckles of pestilential
 blood.

 A gleaming red form flies towards you through the air.

 That's not the sun.

 When the form comes closer you see that it is an angel dressed all in
 red gauze. A plague angel! Its scarves flutter behind like stage
 flames as it drifts closer.

 The angel hovers several yards past the railing of the balcony. Its
 androgynous smile is hard, carved from rock candy. It reaches into a
 red box tucked beneath its arm, and then casts its hand towards you,
 like it is feeding grain to chickens. Red-black flakes fall on your
 face, sink into your skin. So this is how the plague is spread. You
 always thought it had something to do with bad night air or snakes.

 (At least it's not ghosts.)

 Mid-morning.

 Lorenzo is laughing so hard he's about to throw up. "You should see
 your face!"

 "I don't have to see my face," you say. "I have my face."

 "I'm really sorry," says Camilla, and she seems almost sincere.

 "About what? The, the spiked pill you gave me? Or the, what was that
 thing, a store mannequin rigged up with a red spotlight and dangling
 on a zip line?"

 "The fake plague angel was totally Lorenzo's idea," says Camilla.

 "I made the <span class="floydstyle em">papier-mâché</span> corpse, too." Lorenzo shakes his
 head, wipes away tears of laughter.

 "My money," you say, holding out your hand.

 Lorenzo snorts. "You think I have that kind of cash? My dad keeps me
 on a strict allowance. I'm more broke than you."

 What a rotten day.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 But a month later Lorenzo's dead, of the real Pestilence, and you are
 driving his father's cherry-red Aceto west towards Avignon. Supposedly
 Avignon is plague free, which leaves just a pesky anti-pope to put up
 with. Viviana is sitting in the passenger seat, her hair blowing every
 which way, a manuscript in her lap. Camilla is squeezed in between
 you. And that you don't mind at all.

 In John Webster's play <span class="floydstyle em">The White Devil</span>, the poisoned
 character Bracciano hallucinates on his deathbed. After seeing the
 devil, who wears a blue bonnet, breeches, and a great cod-piece "stuck
 full of pins with pearls o'th' head of them," he cries out: "Look you,
 six gray rats that have lost their tails crawl up the pillow; send for
 a rat-catcher." Of the many creepy, weird images in the play, the rats
 on the pillow might be my favorite. The phrase, which also sounds a
 little like the title of a <span class="floydstyle em">giallo</span>, struck me enough to borrow
 here. If Rinaldo manages to fall asleep with the travel pillow on the
 bed the connection to this story is made a little less tenuous.

 An Anatomy by Chandler Groover
 Release 1 / Serial number 150214 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atop the Pyramid</span>
 The feathered serpent coils before you, greater than any god or any
 monster. Maimed warriors are crushed beneath its claws. The shrines
 nearby have been reduced to rubble.

 Steps descend on every side into the city, and on every side flames
 lap their blackened stones.

>put knife in warriors

 That would not help you.

>put knife in priests

 That would not help you.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a blade

>go down

 Your flesh blisters from the heat. You must turn back.

>examine forest

 The land is an inferno stretching into the horizon.

 Its quills quivering with metallic rattles, plumage outspread around
 its head for an apocalyptic hood, the serpent rises to strike.

>stab serpent

 Your blade splinters against your foe.

>examine moon

 The night fluctuates as an incendiary mirage, each star molten, the
 moon dripping like fat from some roast animal spitted above a pit.

>examine serpent

 Its body lithe with hieroglyphic scales, its talons gold, its whiskers
 living flame, its feathers incandescent, there is nothing above the
 sky or underneath the earth more terrible. The priests could not kill
 it with spells and the warriors could not kill it with arms. Even now,
 after the ultimate banquet, its appetite cannot be satisfied.

 With its jaws unhinged, the beast lunges, fangs snapping shut around
 you as inevitably as a thunderclap follows a lightning strike.

 There is no pain.

 There is only darkness, more complete than an evening without stars.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Maw</span>
 You can see nothing, but the air is fetid, hot. Warm dribblings
 drizzle from above. The ground is spongy underneath your feet.

>feel ground

 It is too dark to see anything properly.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gullet</span>
 Enormous crimson globules leak along the walls, running in channels
 between numberless gemstones embedded in the rubbery muscle.

 A glow radiates from somewhere deep below, its faint brilliance
 ensnared in the faceted gems like fireflies imprisoned in amber.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ribcage</span>
 Vaulted with bones. No mortal architecture has ever been more
 colossal. Mottled webbing between the ribs contracts as though some
 vast organ were expanding and deflating on its opposite side, pressing
 against the malleable tissue.

 Light streams from a cavity leading below.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lungs</span>
 Shot through with rainbow light. The breathing walls are panelled in
 stained glass.

 You walk on air, weightless, dizzy. The atmosphere is supercharged
 with oxygen. Playful colors dart around you like dolphins.

 An opening slashed through the tissue nearby leads back to the
 ribcage.

>examine glass

 The stained glass is patterned abstractly. Its panes are fused
 together with hard cartilage. Light streams through the ceiling above.

 your bloodstream cleansed, your body awakened. Everything has meaning

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stomach</span>
 Bubbles lazily develop and combust in a lake roiling with thick acidic
 sludge. Its shoreline is littered with corpses and ambiguous organic
 detritus. Your eyes sting and your brain throbs from the noxious odor.

 One skeleton, arm outstretched, fingers dug into the swampy ground,
 seems nearly to have climbed free when the acid claimed its life.

 Emerging from the lake's corrosive mire, its broken orb half-sunken,
 is the sun.

>search skeleton

 If you want to search something, you should examine it.

>examine skeleton

 Its skull rotates to stare at you. It is not living, but neither is it
 dead.

>talkt to skeleton

 That's not an action you need to perform.

>talk to skeleton

 Perhaps you should ASK the skeleton ABOUT something.

>ask skeleton about skeleton

 The skeleton mumbles, "...my sorceries were useless against it... all
 my studies wasted... my magic impotent... except to bind my soul to
 this dead husk... although I did not plan to die when I first wove the
 binding years ago..."

>ask skeleton about sun

 The skeleton mumbles, "...I saw it swallow the sun... it rose and
 closed its jaws over the sun... now the world is plunged in darkness
 and the sun will never rise again..."

>ask skeleton about serpent

 The skeleton mumbles, "...unkillable... perhaps unkillable... it came
 from farther than the farthest horizon... from somewhere deeper than
 the deepest trench... it has always existed... and it will never stop
 eating..."

>ask skeleton about binding

 The skeleton mumbles, "...what I am now... what I experience... is not
 living..."

>examine sun

 Its circle has collapsed. Little flames leap and dart across its
 fractured shell. Now that the serpent has consumed the sun, it will
 continue to degrade until its embers perish and its warmth has been
 absorbed into the beast.

>ask skeleton about me

 The skeleton mumbles, "...even a warrior like you has... joined us
 here in this... unwholesome pit... nobody can conquer the serpent..."

 Bubbles lazily develop and combust in a lake roiling with thick acidic
 sludge. Its shoreline is littered with corpses and ambiguous organic
 detritus. Your eyes sting and your brain throbs from the noxious odor.

 One skeleton, arm outstretched, fingers dug into the swampy ground,
 seems nearly to have climbed free when the acid claimed its life.

 Emerging from the lake's corrosive mire, its broken orb half-sunken,

>ask skeleton about lungs

 The skeleton mumbles, "...even the sturdiest armor... has flaws..."

>ask skeleton about gullet

 The skeleton mumbles, "...jewels displayed for nobody... vestigal
 artifacts from its ancient fabrication..."

>ask skeleton about lake

 The skeleton mumbles, "...the acid... eats what the serpent eats...
 perhaps if you could cross it... with some bridge..."

>ask skeleton about bridge

 The skeleton mumbles, "...revenge... would be the sweetest thing... my
 comrades... my arcane studies... might still possess some little
 use... for you..."

 Its fingers twitch. The acid quagmire churns as bloated deformities
 buoy to its surface, reanimated by some necromantic urge originating
 from the skeleton. Its fingers clench into a fist; the floating
 corpses crush into a mass, a bridge whose length spans the lake toward
 the sun.

>ask skeleton about maw

 The skeleton mumbles, "...teeth sharper than any weapon... do not
 remind me..."

>examine bridge

 Its bricks are bones; its mortar, gore.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sol</span>
 The sun has been shattered. You enter its hollow interior.

 The walls shimmer with scales smoldering orange. Fiery tongues rush
 upward toward great vents smashed in the ceiling. Liquid gold has
 pooled into puddles alight with flames whose tendrils beckon like
 seductive hands.

 Through a fracture above, the bridge spans the surrounding acid, and a
 fissure cracked into the floor opens toward a sphincter visible below.

 You are unbearably hot.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Small Intestine</span>
 More humid than any jungle and flourishing with intestinal flora. Acid
 trickles from the sphincter overhead into a meandering rivulet. The
 walls throb and grumble, occasionally opening their pores to pump bile
 into the digesting morass.

 Feeble sunlight from above casts a tropical glow across the mucosa;
 the ileocecal valve yawns below.

>examine bile

 The bile has joined with other fluids to produce a loathsome stew,
 clotted with decomposing bodies, foamed with brown and yellow froth.

>examine bodies

 Simmering in this concoction, you cannot even recognize whether the
 bodies are human.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Large Intestine</span>
 Stalagmites ascend from the floor. Stalactites descend from above.
 Fibrous bundles somewhat like cocoons are lumped together in masses,
 slowly sliding downward toward a dank chasm fringed with palpitating

 depressions.

 When you examine the bundles, you discover undigested bones enmeshed
 in a syrupy lacing. One projecting femur seems especially slathered in
 the substance.

 From somewhere beyond the intestinal lining, a continuous note like a

 with panic, but there is nowhere to dive save deeper down.

 A shock travels through the anatomy, organs convulsive.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cloaca</span>
 You are immersed in darkness and in blood.

 You hold your breath.

 The beast rumbles.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atop the Pyramid</span>
 You slide into the night, newborn in blood. It is all you can smell,
 all you can feel, all you can taste. The pyramid is slippery with gore
 as you scramble to distance yourself from the feathered serpent.

 It has risen to an impossible height.

 The star-strewn sky is its deathbed.

 Bloody teardrops well out from its eyes, striking the pyramid below
 like cannonballs. Its whiskers are drenched crimson, its plumage
 saturated, its talons raking canyons through its belly as it claws to
 fight its traitorous body.

 Its scales dissolve. Its skin dissolves. The serpent is a slashed
 artery running through the universe, and from its broken vessel blood
 explodes in a diluvian cascade. The fires in the forest hiss and die
 in the deluge; the landscape streams and steams with its slaughter;
 and scarlet raindrops drizzle from above.

>examine me

 You are too exhausted to move.

 The night is still, the serpent dead, the city soaked with sacrificial
 blood.

 You can see, shimmering in the downpour, a small flame amongst the
 wreckage.

>take sun

 You lift this last sunshard and cradle it between your hands.

 It is all that remains from the devoured sun.

>put sun in sky

 (first taking the small flame)
 You lift this last sunshard and cradle it between your hands.

 The flame gutters, and fizzles, and fades.

>inventory

 You are carrying nothing.

 You close your eyes and let the blood wash over you.

 Crusted with blood.

 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lungs</span>
 Shot through with rainbow light. The breathing walls are panelled in
 stained glass.

 You walk on air, weightless, dizzy. The atmosphere is supercharged
 with oxygen. Playful colors dart around you like dolphins.

 A hole has been smashed in the ceiling above, and an opening slashed
 through the tissue nearby leads back to the ribcage.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ribcage</span>
 Vaulted with bones. No mortal architecture has ever been more
 colossal. Mottled webbing between the ribs contracts as though some
 vast organ were expanding and deflating on its opposite side, pressing
 against the malleable tissue.

 An opening has been slashed into the webbing.

 Light streams from a cavity leading below.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stomach</span>
 Bubbles lazily develop and combust in a lake roiling with thick acidic
 sludge. Its shoreline is littered with corpses and ambiguous organic
 detritus. Your eyes sting and your brain throbs from the noxious odor.

 One skeleton, arm outstretched, fingers clenched into a fist, seems
 nearly to have climbed free when the acid claimed its life.

 Emerging from the lake's corrosive mire, its broken orb half-sunken,
 is the sun. A bridge molded from crushed bodies leads toward it.

>ask skeleton about heart

 The skeleton mumbles, "...its heart... yes... its heart... if its
 heart were destroyed... it is impossible... and yet it might not be
 impossible..."

>ask skeleton about altar

 The skeleton mumbles, "...an unholy pedestal... a holy pedestal..."

>ask skeleton about chains

 The skeleton groans but has no reply.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sol</span>
 The sun has been shattered. You enter its hollow interior.

 The walls shimmer with scales smoldering orange. Fiery tongues rush
 upward toward great vents smashed in the ceiling. Liquid gold has
 pooled into puddles alight with flames whose tendrils beckon like
 seductive hands.

 Through a fracture above, the bridge spans the surrounding acid, and a
 fissure cracked into the floor opens toward a sphincter visible below.

 You are unbearably hot.

>go west

 There is no passage through that anatomy.

 You are sweating profusely, throat parched.

>go east

 There is no passage through that anatomy.

 Your skin is blistering.

>go north

 There is no passage through that anatomy.

 Red droplets well out from each pore as your crisping flesh contracts.

>go south

 There is no passage through that anatomy.

 Your blood is boiling, your flesh roasted, smoke pouring from your
 nostrils and your mouth as you collapse. First one and then another
 spark ignites on your body, combusting as your brittle skin blazes,
 your fingers melting candles crowned with undulating flames.

 You can smell and taste nothing but charring meat; you can hear
 nothing but your own screams; you can feel and see nothing but fire;
 and then you know nothing at all.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Small Intestine</span>
 More humid than any jungle and flourishing with intestinal flora. Acid
 trickles from the sphincter overhead into a meandering rivulet. The
 walls throb and grumble, occasionally opening their pores to pump bile
 into the digesting morass.

 Feeble sunlight from above casts a tropical glow across the mucosa;
 the ileocecal valve yawns below.

 An opening slashed into the membrane behind you leads back to the
 small intestine.

 An arm's length, elegantly wrought from platinum.

>put sperm in ovum

 With a keening scream, the gamete assaults the ovum, shredding through
 its mallow gauze with a piranha's frenzy.

 The silk threads twist above; the ovum sways; the gamete burrows
 gleefully into the wound its teeth have torn apart, disappearing with
 one last contorted flourish into the violated flesh.

 There is silence.

 The ovum no longer resonates; the pods along the walls no longer hum;
 the beast's internal organs no longer pulse and grumble. And then
 there is a light -- gold, small, and bright -- within the gauze, which
 suddenly erupts as an engulfing conflagration.

 The silk threads melt. The ovum falls blazing into the pool, whose
 liquid lights as readily as kindling while the pods burst from the
 mounting temperature. The chamber has become a bonfire.

 You are drenched in burning sweat.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Large Intestine</span>
 The stalagmites are fiery columns, the stalactites dripping heated

 boiling underneath. A draught from below fans the fires inside even
 higher.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atop the Pyramid</span>
 You plunge outside into the night, your skin scorched and smoking. The
 world is cold and dark and you stumble across the pyramid's level top,
 seeking refuge amongst the rubble as the feathered serpent writhes.

 Its scales are whitehot irons and its feathers streaming flames, its
 talons glowing pokers and its eyes liquid rubies. It is coiling and
 recoiling with its teeth sunk in its tail, as though it would seek to
 tear out its anguish and feast on that emotion like a predator upon
 its gutted prey.

 In its agony it has forgotten everything.

 It shreds and shreds itself apart, snapping, ripping, roaring until
 its muscles are tinseled ribbons. With one tremendous tug it yanks its
 head back from its flesh, its jaw trailing sunbeams and sinews, and in
 that moment everything is gold, its form unformed, as its coils break
 and crash across the pyramid in molten waves.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The molten metal cools, the pyramid gilded, and the fires in the
 forest below are dwindling.

 The serpent is entirely dissolved.

 Where it once towered, poised to consume the world, something else now
 uncoils and flickers.

>examine snake

 The serpent is entirely dissolved.

 It is another serpent, newly hatched. Its feathers are yellow with
 yolk.  Its scales are still unhardened, translucent, and through their
 glass an inner brilliance shimmers like a candle in a lamp.

 It chirps and surveys the surrounding landscape, cocking its head now
 and then with inquisitiveness.

 At last it stares into the sky.

 Called by some ancient instinct, it sinks one claw, then the next,
 into the darkened space behind the stars, and gradually begins to
 climb into the airy vault above.

 As it ascends, the stars demurely dim, the moon draws its invisible
 cloak, and another dawn blushes from the horizon.

 You cannot see it clearly anymore. It is too far away, and far too
 bright.

 You shield your eyes against the morning sun.
