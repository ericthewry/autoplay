 Johann found the whole rattling car empty save one seat occupied by a
 girl about his age, whose face was hidden behind a large folding star
 chart, labeled MAP in one corner. He approached softly. There was
 something perhaps familiar about her.

 "Mind if I sit here, Miss?" he asked. She looked up from the map, and
 Johann at once recognized her as his sister, and wondered how in the
 world he hadn't known who she was earlier. She smiled to see him, but
 he thought he saw her wiping a tear from her eye as turned to put down
 his coat. Taking the seat opposite her, and looking for a moment at the
 near-total desolation outside the train, punctuated only by a few
 swimming blue lamps, he asked, "Where did you get that map?"

 "They gave it to me at the station, of course. Didn't they give you one
 too?" But Johann could not remember any station. In fact, he could not
 remember boarding the train at all.

 I. One More Painted Lantern

 "Je tiu tago ni vidos kaj esperon kaj harmonion, kaj chu estos pli au
 malpli bela sunlevigho de tiu tago ol sunlevigho estas hodiau?"

 Sophie actually enjoyed the festival every year. She enjoyed the
 lights, the songs, and the crispness of the air. It was only the crowds
 that made her uneasy and drove her into the solitude she had learned to
 appreciate.


 The River's Northern Bank
 There the river was at its widest, flowing with a stealthy swiftness.
 The only way back to the city was to the northwest.

 Painted lanterns undulated just barely within view.

 She was surprised to see Franz there.

>inventory
 She was carrying:
   a faith pendant (being worn)

>examine pendant
 Sophie had inherited the pendant, a symbol of faith, from her
 grandmother. It was of a strange shape, with many curves. Sophie's
 grandmother had called it her "ohm."

 Franz noticed Sophie's presence with a start. He stumbled, fell into
 the water, and was silently carried downstream.

>examine me
 Sophie was sometimes told she was a good child, and she liked to think
 of herself that way.

>save franz
 Sophie leaped into the frigid river. The dark shadow of a man appeared
 and followed her into the Acheron.

 Franz had trouble catching his breaths in the mighty current. He and
 Sophie met in the water, and she tried to help him stay afloat, but the
 water began to overwhelm her. There was a tumbling, a scratching, and a
 stabilization. Somehow, they had landed.

 Crane Island, Western Shore
 This part of the island consisted mainly of smooth sedimentary rock,
 while she was on a small sandy bit of shore that connected to the east
 with a path guarded by an ancient spirit gate.

 The ancient spirit gate was closed.

 Painted lanterns undulated just barely within view.

 "I'm sorry I made you come down to the river, Sophie," Franz said when
 he had finally stopped coughing up water. "I just wanted to catch one
 more painted lantern." Then he shuddered and once again adopted his
 habitual silence.

>take lantern
 The lanterns were floating in the far-away sky.

>examine gate
 The ancient spirit gate was closed. In design, it looked far older than
 anything in the city, yet its wood seemed immune to rot. In it were
 carved three recesses, each of the same peculiar shape that defined the
 pendant Sophie wore wherever she went. One was green, another silver,
 and the third was pale blue.

>examine lanterns
 The lanterns formed new constellations in the inky sky.

>examine franz
 He was thoroughly wet and entirely dazed.

>open gate
 It wouldn't budge.

>put pendant in recess
 Which did she mean, the green recess, the silver recess, or the pale
 blue recess?

>green
 (first taking it off)
 Sophie placed her faith pendant in the gate's green recess.

 "We cannot place our faith in the verdigris of life," said Franz, "for
 all things that live must die."
>put pendant in silver recess
 (first taking the faith pendant)
 Sophie placed her faith pendant in the gate's silver recess.

 "We cannot place our faith in the sheen of silver," said Franz, "for
 all things that are must pass."
>put pendant in silver blue recess
 I only understood you as far as wanting to put the faith pendant in the
 silver recess.

>put pendant in  blue recess
 (first taking the faith pendant)
 Sophie placed her faith pendant in the gate's pale blue recess.

 "We can place our faith only in the Pale Blue Light -- the light of
 both death and compassion," said Franz, "for death is certain, and
 compassion illuminates the way."

 The gate opened, apparently of its own accord.

 Spirit Tunnel
 The tunnel seemed to have been carved from the stone by hand with crude
 tools. It wasn't smooth, like the grand buildings in the city center,
 but rough, with uneven walls. She could go out to the east or through
 the spirit gate to the west.

 The ancient spirit gate was open.

 Sacred Circle
 A circular stone platform with carved geometric designs surrounded an
 ancient stone well. It was in places like these that the old Theists
 offered prayers, and the first Monists held their whirlings all those
 centuries ago. Great rocks surrounded the western half of the circle.
 The spirit tunnel led west through them. The eastern half of the circle
 was open, allowing passage to the east, northeast, and southeast.

 Franz arrived from the west.

>examine platform
 Sophie had expected it to bear ritual inscriptions of some sort, but
 instead found it perfectly smooth.

 stood forever yawning, forever offering its deep obscurity to anything
 that should fall in.

 Crane Pond
 This area of the island featured a placid, shallow pond. It seemed to
 be the very center of the island; she could go in any of the four
 cardinal directions from there.

 Franz arrived from the west.

>examine pond
 The pond lay absolutely still, and at its center floated a blue crane.

>examine crane
 Which did she mean, Crane Pond or the blue crane?

>examine blue crane
 Still. Stolid. Restfully being.

>take blue crane
 She couldn't reach it from outside the pond.

>swim
 The crane, wary of Sophie's approach, flew off into the night. Sophie
 swam around a bit in the moonlight, and Franz turned away, apparently
 thinking it improper to watch. Soon, however, the cold was too much,
 and she stopped.

 Franz arrived from the south.

>examine tower
 This watchtower was visible from the city, and had been a symbol of the
 region for ages. It was even depicted in Sophie's family crest.

>examine shrine
 It is of stone and of simple design. Whatever figure it may have held
 has long since gone. Attached to it is a tower.

>go up

 Watchtower
 High in the air, she could see it all: the island, the river with its
 bank, the path leading up to the gates, and the city beyond. It was
 beautiful.

 Sophie remembered the heavy creases of her father's forehead, the
 religious fixation of his eyes as he saluted the family crest three
 years before. She remembered the engraved tower surrounded by the
 ancient motto she could not read. Franz had been there on one of his
 visits, and had examined the old letters closely, slowly tracing them
 with his finger before speaking aloud those strange words she could not
 understand:

 "Neniame forlasu la gardon."

 Her father's face had become wildly hostile, and he had shouted
 condemnations of the utterance of Elderese. That had been the last time
 Sophie had seen her father.

 The only way out was back down to the shrine.

 Painted lanterns undulated just barely within view.

>look out
 She saw nothing unexpected in that direction.

>examine island
 She couldn't see any such thing.

>neniame

 The spirit tunnel led west through them. The eastern half of the circle
 was open, allowing passage to the east, northeast, and southeast.

 Sophie's father stood there, seething, menacing, holding a knife to
 Franz.

 Franz, captive, shivered, a slight blue glow dancing about his teary
 eyes, and a pale, wavering, blue cocoon of light shielding him against
 the attacks of Sophie's father.

 Her father turned as she approached. "Stay out of my way, Sophie," he
 commanded. "It is at last time to end this aberration."

>examine franz
 He was thoroughly wet and entirely dazed.

>examine father
 He had changed much since Sophie had last seen him. All the love and
 care had gone from him.

 The blue glow about Franz faded as Sophie's father drew the knife
 toward his throat.

 Again the train slowed, and Johann saw a vast field of corn approaching
 ahead, the golden tuft of hair on every ear rippling in a slow breeze.
 He turned to the fisherman at his side, and was about to ask, "Can you
 see that? Isn't it splendid?"

 But as suddenly as he had appeared, the fisherman had departed.
 Although he had seen too many things out of the ordinary to wonder
 where the man had gone, Johann wished very much that he had said more
 to his fellow passenger while he had the chance.

 "People come and go so quickly on this train," he remarked to his
 sister. "At least I know you won't disappear on me."

 She nodded silently, shifting in her seat.

 II. Avery's Diary

 I am Avery Jones, and I am a schoolteacher.

 15 December 1921.
 Am working on a new story I'm calling "Johann's Ticket." Have sketched
 out the basic arc already, and am trying to round it out into something
 to send off to the city publishers again, though I suspect I'll just
 end up having a small run printed at my own expense, as I did with "One
 More Painted Lantern" and the poetry.

 Noticed today that it's been over a month since I started teaching.
 Think I may have developed a knack for it. Seems the trick is to pay
 textbooks only the very little attention they're due, and to keep the
 children excited. Mme S. didn't seem much too pleased with this method
 at first, but I seem to have won the children's admiration, and the
 respect of my superiors has gradually followed.

 Had a real shock today when Benjamin Harker became ill during rehearsal
 for the play. When I had sent for his parents, I started cleaning up,
 at which point I confirmed my suspicions that the Harker family has it
 bad enough that they're eating mostly kelp. This prompted me to at last
 discuss the possibility of an agronomics curriculum with Mme S. She
 didn't seem too adverse to the idea. Also convinced Mr. Harker to let
 me have a look at his soil.

 Everyone seems to be catching the autumn sickness. Lately my coughing
 has been deeper and more difficult, and Lucy's begun coughing as well.
 Am doing my best to encourage hygiene among my pupils, but convincing
 any of them to show any concern for his own health is a struggle.

 I am Avery Jones, and I am weak.

 21 September 1933.
 Am coughing up more blood than usual. Chills have set in harder. Some
 delirium this morning. All in all, is much like Lucy's last day. Had an
 unexpected visitor; Mr. Harker got word I'd returned to my parents'
 house and came to describe the condition of his crop, looking for
 advice. Convinced him to stay for some time, though Father seemed eager
 to shoo him away. Was discreet about my difficulties, and I don't think
 Mr. Harker caught on, but since he left things have deteriorated
 further. This is likely the end. Will attempt a traditional sort of
 rhyme, but this had better not end up on my tombstone, as I'm no
 Longfellow.

 I am Avery Jones, and I am in despair.

 27 November 1922.
 Went out for a walk today. Couldn't do anything else. I had walked all
 the way down to the creek before I even realized how far I'd gone.

 Back when it all started, when she coughed up blood for the first time,
 I'd gone there looking for a maple branch. "I want one full of sap,"
 she'd said, "and with icicles hanging down." I'd thought it selfish and
 frivolous of her to ask, when it seemed so necessary that I remain. It
 occurred to me only today that it was the most selfless thing she could
 have done -- to give me leave when I most needed it.

 This evening I thought, for a moment, that I had seen a bird. I
 thought, for a moment, that I was saved. But it was not a flurry of
 wings. It was only the dead falling of snow from the limb of an oak. It
 took some time to disinter my face from the wet folds of my
 handkerchief.

 When I had finished a prayer for the repose of Lucy's soul, I observed
 the noise of the water's currents below. The wind ran its fingers
 through my hair. It was calling me home. The water was pulling me in.
 It was calling me to jump.

 I didn't jump. Instead I found a low-hanging branch nearby, craned my
 neck heavenward, and sung the most bitter chorus of "How Great Thou
 Art" the world has ever heard.

 Johann strained his eyes, staring deep into the round void outside. "I
 don't see a thing," he said.

 His sister pointed excitedly out the window "There's a small, pale blue
 light out there, right there in the middle!" He stared as hard as he
 could, and still he saw nothing, but then a small dim something
 appeared, just where she had been pointing.

 "I see it!" he shouted, but his sister was no longer there, and turning
 back to that dim form in dread he saw that it was his sister, half a
 mile from the train or more, waving goodbye as she receded into the
 dark.

 Editor's Afterword

 Although Johann's Ticket remained unfinished at the time of Avery
 Jones's untimely death from tuberculosis in 1933, it has long been one

 A circular stone platform with carved geometric designs surrounded an

 Franz stood silently by.

>se

 Isthmus
 It was a fairly well-known secret that Crane Island wasn't an island at
 all; this narrow isthmus extended south to the far bank of the Acheron.
 From there she could also go north, northeast, or northwest.

 She could see a tiger there.

 Franz arrived from the northwest.

>examine tiger
 A fearsome beast if ever there was one.

>pet tiger
 The tiger was a capricious beast indeed, and did not take kindly to
 Sophie's advances. It lunged toward Sophie.

 A blue glow danced about Franz's eyes, then expanded outward, forming
 barriers of light that somehow pushed the tiger back mid-leap and kept
 it at bay.

 He was thoroughly wet and entirely dazed.

>go northeast

 There was a steep hill at the easternmost point of the island, covered
 in images of the Sun. She could go west, northwest, or southwest from
 there, or enter the concrete shelter set into the hill.

 Franz arrived from the southwest.

>enter
 You must supply a noun.

>enter shelter

 Concrete Shelter
 Though the City Council had forced the Museum to close some years ago,
 Sophie remembered that it had once held an exhibit that contained a
 number of artifacts recovered from this site -- an exhibit Sophie was
 explicitly forbidden to see.

 She could see an ancient word machine and some parchment there.

 Franz arrived from the outside.

>examine machine
 Sophie had seen a number of these devices at the Museum. This
 particular sort of word machine, she remembered, was used for
 displaying changing information. This one was still working. Perhaps,
 thought Sophie, it was powered by light, like some of the museum
 pieces. It read thus:

 "La aktuala nivelo de minaco estas rugho. Pro masiva aliranta objekto,
 chiuj civitanoj devas serchi shirmejon. La Chiela Gardo antaue
 ghisdatigis la minacan nivelon antau 472 jaroj, 3 monatoj, 25 tagoj kaj
 3 horoj."

>examine parchment
 It was affixed to the concrete, and there was ancient writing on it:

 La Chiela Gardo
 Neniame forlasu la gardon.

 Deklaro de misio
 La eterna misio de la Chiela Gardo estas atente gardi la loghantaron de

 Concrete Shelter
 Though the City Council had forced the Museum to close some years ago,
 Sophie remembered that it had once held an exhibit that contained a
 number of artifacts recovered from this site -- an exhibit Sophie was
 explicitly forbidden to see.

 Franz stood silently by.

 She could also see an ancient word machine and some parchment there.

 "Pale Blue Light" uses two primary methods of interaction. The first is
 a parser system common to works of interactive fiction, in which the
 reader inputs commands like "go northwest" or "take knife" to advance
 the story. The second involves poetry; lines of poetry are displayed to
 the reader, and the reader must input one of the boldface words from
 the last line displayed. The reader's choice of word will determine the
 content of the next line of the poem.

 I'm sorry. What was that?

 "Pale Blue Light" was inspired by the life and work of Kenji Miyazawa.
 Kenji (1896 - 1933) was a Japanese Nichiren Buddhist, naturalist,
 agronomist, Esperantist, ultranationalist, and schoolteacher who lived
 in relative obscurity in rural and destitute Hanamaki of Iwate province
 but gained great fame and admiration in Japan for his poetry and
 children's stories during the 1990s. A number of his works have been
 translated into English. Perhaps the best English-language volume on
 Kenji is Hiroaki Sato's Miyazawa Kenji: Selections, which contains a
 number of Kenji's poems and a thorough biographical introduction. It is
 published by the University of California Press.

>out

 Sunrise Point
 There was a steep hill at the easternmost point of the island, covered
 in images of the Sun. She could go west, northwest, or southwest from
 there, or enter the concrete shelter set into the hill.

 Franz arrived from the inside.

>go northwest

 Shrine of the Protector
 This, at least, was familiar; there were shrines like this all over the
 mainland, dedicated to the Protector worshiped in ancient theology.
 This one was set apart by its distinctive watchtower rising upward into
 the cold sky. She could also go south, southeast, southwest, or up into
 the tower.

 Franz arrived from the southeast.

>go up

 Watchtower
 High in the air, she could see it all: the island, the river with its
 bank, the path leading up to the gates, and the city beyond. It was
 beautiful.

 Sophie remembered the heavy creases of her father's forehead, the
 religious fixation of his eyes as he saluted the family crest three
 years before. She remembered the engraved tower surrounded by the
 ancient motto she could not read. Franz had been there on one of his
 visits, and had examined the old letters closely, slowly tracing them
 with his finger before speaking aloud those strange words she could not
 understand:

 "Neniame forlasu la gardon."

 Her father's face had become wildly hostile, and he had shouted
 condemnations of the utterance of Elderese. That had been the last time
 Sophie had seen her father.

 The only way out was back down to the shrine.

 Painted lanterns undulated just barely within view.

>go down

 Shrine of the Protector
 This, at least, was familiar; there were shrines like this all over the
 mainland, dedicated to the Protector worshiped in ancient theology.
 This one was set apart by its distinctive watchtower rising upward into
 the cold sky. She could also go south, southeast, southwest, or up into
 the tower.

 Franz was gone.

>go southwest

 Sacred Circle
 A circular stone platform with carved geometric designs surrounded an
 ancient stone well. It was in places like these that the old Theists
 offered prayers, and the first Monists held their whirlings all those
 centuries ago. Great rocks surrounded the western half of the circle.
 The spirit tunnel led west through them. The eastern half of the circle
 was open, allowing passage to the east, northeast, and southeast.

 Sophie's father stood there, seething, menacing, holding a knife to
 Franz.

 Franz, captive, shivered, a slight blue glow dancing about his teary
 eyes, and a pale, wavering, blue cocoon of light shielding him against
 the attacks of Sophie's father.

 Her father turned as she approached. "Stay out of my way, Sophie," he
 commanded. "It is at last time to end this aberration."

>SAVE
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>take knife
 Sophie's father maintained his grip on the knife and coldly pushed her
 aside.

>kiss father
 Sophie's father gave a short gasp of surprise, his eyes momentarily
 widened, and he dropped his knife.

>take knife
 Sophie took hold of the knife.

 "Sophie," her father said, "we have to end this. He speaks the ancient
 language. He even uses the ancient light!"

>drop knife in well
 She put the knife into the ancient stone well.

 The knife was was carried swiftly downstream.

 "Sophie!" her father shouted. "What have you done?" He turned toward
 her and began to squeeze her throat. With a cry of despair, Franz came
 to her side, and the two were enveloped in blue light that met the
 coming blow of her father and deflected him backward into the gathering
 night.

 Again the train slowed, and Johann saw a vast field of corn approaching
 ahead, the golden tuft of hair on every ear rippling in a slow breeze.
 He turned to the fisherman at his side, and was about to ask, "Can you
 see that? Isn't it splendid?"

 But as suddenly as he had appeared, the fisherman had departed.
 Although he had seen too many things out of the ordinary to wonder
 where the man had gone, Johann wished very much that he had said more
 to his fellow passenger while he had the chance.

 "People come and go so quickly on this train," he remarked to his
 sister. "At least I know you won't disappear on me."

 She nodded silently, shifting in her seat.

 II. Avery's Diary

 I am Avery Jones, and I am a schoolteacher.

 15 December 1921.
 Am working on a new story I'm calling "Johann's Ticket." Have sketched
 out the basic arc already, and am trying to round it out into something
 to send off to the city publishers again, though I suspect I'll just
 end up having a small run printed at my own expense, as I did with "One
 More Painted Lantern" and the poetry.

 Noticed today that it's been over a month since I started teaching.
 Think I may have developed a knack for it. Seems the trick is to pay
 textbooks only the very little attention they're due, and to keep the
 children excited. Mme S. didn't seem much too pleased with this method
 at first, but I seem to have won the children's admiration, and the
 respect of my superiors has gradually followed.

 Had a real shock today when Benjamin Harker became ill during rehearsal
 for the play. When I had sent for his parents, I started cleaning up,
 at which point I confirmed my suspicions that the Harker family has it
 bad enough that they're eating mostly kelp. This prompted me to at last
 discuss the possibility of an agronomics curriculum with Mme S. She
 didn't seem too adverse to the idea. Also convinced Mr. Harker to let
 me have a look at his soil.

 Everyone seems to be catching the autumn sickness. Lately my coughing
 has been deeper and more difficult, and Lucy's begun coughing as well.
 Am doing my best to encourage hygiene among my pupils, but convincing
 any of them to show any concern for his own health is a struggle.

 I am Avery Jones, and I am weak.

 21 September 1933.
 Am coughing up more blood than usual. Chills have set in harder. Some
 delirium this morning. All in all, is much like Lucy's last day. Had an
 unexpected visitor; Mr. Harker got word I'd returned to my parents'
 house and came to describe the condition of his crop, looking for
 advice. Convinced him to stay for some time, though Father seemed eager
 to shoo him away. Was discreet about my difficulties, and I don't think
 Mr. Harker caught on, but since he left things have deteriorated
 further. This is likely the end. Will attempt a traditional sort of
 rhyme, but this had better not end up on my tombstone, as I'm no
 Longfellow.

 I am Avery Jones, and I am in despair.

 27 November 1922.
 Went out for a walk today. Couldn't do anything else. I had walked all
 the way down to the creek before I even realized how far I'd gone.

 Back when it all started, when she coughed up blood for the first time,
 I'd gone there looking for a maple branch. "I want one full of sap,"
 she'd said, "and with icicles hanging down." I'd thought it selfish and
 frivolous of her to ask, when it seemed so necessary that I remain. It
 occurred to me only today that it was the most selfless thing she could
 have done -- to give me leave when I most needed it.

 This evening I thought, for a moment, that I had seen a bird. I
 thought, for a moment, that I was saved. But it was not a flurry of
 wings. It was only the dead falling of snow from the limb of an oak. It
 took some time to disinter my face from the wet folds of my
 handkerchief.

 When I had finished a prayer for the repose of Lucy's soul, I observed
 the noise of the water's currents below. The wind ran its fingers
 through my hair. It was calling me home. The water was pulling me in.
 It was calling me to jump.

 I didn't jump. Instead I found a low-hanging branch nearby, craned my
 neck heavenward, and sung the most bitter chorus of "How Great Thou
 Art" the world has ever heard.

 Johann strained his eyes, staring deep into the round void outside. "I
 don't see a thing," he said.

 His sister pointed excitedly out the window "There's a small, pale blue
 light out there, right there in the middle!" He stared as hard as he
 could, and still he saw nothing, but then a small dim something
 appeared, just where she had been pointing.

 "I see it!" he shouted, but his sister was no longer there, and turning
 back to that dim form in dread he saw that it was his sister, half a
 mile from the train or more, waving goodbye as she receded into the
 dark.

 III. Jamaica Center Bound

 You are Dr. Howard Mann, and you are on the E train.
 "This is a Jamaica Center bound E local train. The next stop is Jamaica
 -- Van Wyck."

 "Stand clear of the closing doors, please."

 The dates and names of the diary run over and over in your mind, though
 you have tired of reading.

 A man sleeps opposite you, twitching fitfully.

 The clock reads 5:13 pm.

>wake man

 Boulevard -- Archer Avenue -- JFK."

 "Stand clear of the closing doors, please."

 You've got about fifteen minutes until the next Montauk-bound train
 leaves.

 "This is Sutphin Boulevard -- Archer Avenue -- JFK. Transfer is
 available to the J train. Connection is available to the Long Island
 Railroad and AirTran to JFK Airport."

 The doors open wide for you.

>out
 Before you can even really think about it, you're Montauk-bound, a
 pilgrim, and you clutch Avery's diary -- your Holy Book -- closer to
 your chest. You have no idea where you'll spend the night.


 That night, sleeping on the Long Island Railroad, you dream you run
 into one of the characters in Avery Jones's children's novel One More
 Painted Lantern, a girl named Sophie. Her friend Franz trails along
 behind, blue sparks playing about his hair. All you can say to them is:

>fiddlesticks


 And then Avery Jones himself appears out of the gloom, greets Sophie
 and Franz with a tip of his hat, and then turns, smiling, to you. You
 feel there is something dreadfully important you want to tell him, but
 all you can manage is:

 Editor's Afterword

 Although Johann's Ticket remained unfinished at the time of Avery
 Jones's untimely death from tuberculosis in 1933, it has long been one
 of his most popular works, and has been translated into at least five
 languages since its first publication in 1945.

 IV. Afterword

 I am Avery Jones, and I have died.

 Halfway Along the Isthmus
 This thin strip of land runs east-west through the river Acheron.

 A small girl approaches. I think she must be Sophie, a character in the
 book I've been writing. Perhaps these are the fevered imaginings of a
 dying brain. But then I look more closely and realize that I am looking
 into my sister's face. Oh, Lucy! And that boy trailing behind her, that
 is just the child I once was.

 A man stumbles into view from the depths of the night. He peers for a
 moment into Sophie's face, saying "FIDDLESTICKS"

 To me, he says --



     *** "XYZZY" ***

 Living Room
 The Living Room is, contrary to its name, not alive, however it is a
 place where you may live if you wish.  Which is a fancy way of saying
 it's just like every other room. The dining room is south and the hall

>go south
 The Dining Room
 You are in a sparse dining room with parque flooring. The kitchen is to
 the east and to the north is the living room. The table is circa 1950
 with a strange black and white checkerboard pattern. On the table sits
 a small Bonzai tree, looking longingly out the west facing window.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen sports the usual kitchiny things, and a counter which
 separates the cooking area from the dining room to the west. A French
 door south of here leads out to the car port. There is a pile of junk
 mail on the counter. There are some food crumbs on the counter. The
 French door is open.

 The Car Port
 Ah the great outdoors!   This is the car port.  To the east is the back
 yard.  The drive way extends west toward the street. The door into your
 house is to the north. Hanging from the ceiling (which extends beyond

 loyal car is here. A trash can is here, closed. There is a pile of
 leaves here. The French door is open.

 One of Colleen's early money making schemes, she gets a 1-900 number
 which charges $15.00 a minute, slaps this bumper sticker on my car,
 then drives around town like an idiot upsetting as many people as

 My Girlfriend's an Evil Bitch.

  I would like to start off by saying this game is not dedicated to
 anyone and there is no one in my life who serves as inspiration for the
 Colleen character.  Any similarity between her and anyone you know is
 not only an amazing coincidence but also should serve as a serious
 concern to you.

 This is my first attempt at making an interactive fiction, or a story
 of any kind.  I have focused on making the game challenging, funny, and
 free of bugs.

 This focus may have the cost of some descriptive narratives.
 Personally, though, when I play IF I'm a little annoyed at too much
 description and it makes me wonder which parts are actually things I
 should pay attention to and which are just there to set the mood.
 Therefore, I have chosen to keep the descriptions in this game short
 and simple giving you just about as much as you need to develop as much
 of a picture of the scene as is required to understand the story and to
 solve the puzzles.

 If you find any mistakes, typos, or you're just so stuck that it's not
 even fun anymore please let me know, divarin@yahoo.com, and I will
 certainly help you out.

 The unique concepts of this game (although other games may have used
 these as well) are:
  * Crafting (combining items to form other items)
  * Buying and selling
  * Survival (the need to get and consume food and drink)
  * Out of game clues (optional puzzles)
  and whatever else I feel like throwing in later.


 My one word of advice to players, take time to buy and read the books
 in the bookstore.  They contain valuable information that will help you
 solve the puzzles.  Plus the lady at the pawn shop will buy them, but
 you won't make a profit off of them.

 Maple Drive
 This is Maple Drive.  This large avenue was designed to serve a large
 commercial district.  The construction on Maple ended prematurely not
 long after it started, leaving a permanent "road closed" blockade to
 the west.

 Along Maple five businesses were constructed, all but one went under
 either before their construction completed or soon after.  The only
 remaining business is "URS Insurance" (which the locals say stands for
 "You Are Screwed Insurance" because they spend a large part of their
 profits on lawyers to find creative ways to not pay on claims).  This
 is Colleen's employer but she isn't here at the moment and besides it's
 the weekend and they're closed.

 URS Insurance's entrance is to the south. To the west is an unfinished

 This is a four-way intersection of Symons and Thayer.  Symons continues

 Basically that means it senses convenience and works (within its power)
 to eliminate it.  This means that a light will only change from red to
 green if A) a car on the cross-street approaches and the light needs to
 switch to inconvenience it; or B) you become convenienced by the red
 light. The light is currently red.

 interesting books but they don't organize them well so these sections
 are really only a formality.  In truth there's no telling what you'll
 find. To the east is the science fiction section.  To the southeast is
 the fiction (that is not science fiction) section.  To the south is the
 non-fiction section.

 long after it started, leaving a permanent "road closed" blockade to
 the west.

 Along Maple five businesses were constructed, all but one went under
 either before their construction completed or soon after.  The only
 remaining business is "URS Insurance" (which the locals say stands for
 "You Are Screwed Insurance" because they spend a large part of their
 profits on lawyers to find creative ways to not pay on claims).  This
 is Colleen's employer but she isn't here at the moment and besides it's
 the weekend and they're closed.

  It can take a long time to make a good shelter.  Afterwards you will
 want to make a fire and that will take time as well.  If you don't
 think you have enough time to pull it off, you should try to find a
 ready-made shelter.

  Quick and dirty shelters include: A cave, a hole (if you have a shovel
 you can make one) it's not pretty but it will keep the wind off of you,
 pointless in the rain though, or a hollowed out tree (as good as a
 cave, but smaller).

  If you are ready to try to make a shelter you will need some
 materials.  Aside from a roof to keep rain off of you, you should
 consider what you will sleep on.  You will want some place dry, and to
 make it difficult for insects to get to you.  Some boards raised up by
 some stones might do the trick, although some creepy crawlies will
 manage to get up the stones and around the boards it at least makes it
 diffcult.

  Flying insects can be kept at bay by the smoke of a nearby campfire
 just outside of your sleeping area, which you'll want to have anyway
 for your own warmth.  See Chapter Three for information about fires.

  The simpliest shelter is made by using a low-hanging tree branch as
 the roof support and leaning logs against it.  Then fasten the tarp or
 other covering to those logs.  If you don't have any covering you can
 use branches from pine trees, cut them off with a knife and tie each
 branch to your logs.

 key elements that separates mankind from animals.  In general, things
 can be made by trying to COMBINE two things together.

  One example: You can make a trap to catch a small woodland animal by
 COMBINE some sort of rigid frame (such as a coat hanger) WITH some sort
 of cord (such as twine, or a strong vine).

  You wonder what other things you might be able to put together?.

  When foraging for food it is important to consider that there are
 three kinds of mushrooms:

  There are discusting mushrooms (which is the kind you get at the local
 supermarket), there are poisonous mushrooms which will either make your
 life a living hell for a few days or kill you (or both), and there are
 psychadelic (magic) mushrooms which will make you think you've
 accidently eaten poisonous mushrooms.

  In the event that you *think* that you've eaten poisonous mushrooms,
 you should change your thought pattern to assume that you have eaten
 magic mushrooms.  This will keep you from having a bad trip and maybe
 you'll even be given a vision or something, who knows.  If it turns out
 that they were poisonous, there really isn't much you could have done
 about it anyway being stranded out in the middle of nowhere on your
 own, so why bother worrying about it?

  Note: Do not read this chapter while you are experiencing the effects
 of mushrooms.

  To start a fire you will need many different types of burning material
 and an ignition source.  You will need to be in a relativly calm
 environment (away from winds and rain) and you will need patience.

  To get started you need to set aside an area where the fire will burn,
 this is called the firepit.  To do this simply MAKE FIREPIT, then it's
 just a matter of putting the right kinds of things into the pit, and
 then igniting it somehow.

  There are 3 main types of material you will need; tinder, kindling,
 and logs.  Tinder refers to a very light, very flamable material that
 usually burns up very quickly.  This could be as simple as pocket lint.
 Or, you can create tinder by using a knife on wood to create wood
 shavings.  Kindling refers to small twigs which burn fairly easily once
 exposed to a fire, but are difficult to ignite on their own.  And logs
 can refer to any size log from 1/2 inch diameter up.

  All material will need to be completely dry.  You will not be able to
 get wood from a freshly cut tree to burn easily.  Such wood will only
 burn once a hot fire has evaporated all the water from within it.

  Your ignition source would be, ideally, a cigarette lighter or some
 matches.  Failing that there are a plethora of other means of starting
 fires.  These include: Sunlight magnification, sparks from flint &
 steel, and friction from rubbing dry wood together.

  To use sunlight magnification, use a lens (such as from eyeglasses) to
 focus the sun's light onto your tinder.  Make the "dot" as tiny as
 possible.  Once the tinder starts to burn quickly deposit it under your
 stacked up kindling.  Blowing on it gently might help it ignite.

  Flint combined with Steel can produce sparks which can ignite tinder.
 If you have something made of steel and a flint stone you can COMBINE
 those two which will give you a decent fire starter.

  Rescue depends on one simple principal: You coming on contact with
 others!

  This can be achieved in one of two ways, and it is best to try both as
 much as possible.

  First, try to make yourself visible as much as possible.  Try
 arranging rocks in the form of an arrow in the direction of your
 travel.  This will not only help others find you but should keep you
 from running around in circles.

  Keeping a fire going is essential, fires produce smoke and smoke may
 be the only sign of your existance that's visible over the tree-line.
 A smokey fire will greatly enhance your odds of being rescued.  Once
 you have a fire going put some smoldering material on the fire, such as
 dry leaves, which don't burn well but do cause a lot of smoke.

  Of course, it would be ideal if you could simply talk to civilization.
 Cell phones are usually not useable in remote areas however shortwave
 radios may be helpful.  Small portable radios may not transmit very
 far, especially when their batteries are weak or they have ineffective
 antennas.  But there are things you can do to increase the transmition
 radius: If you could break open such a radio and solder on some other
 kind of antenna (such as a copper wire) to the antenna leads then
 perhaps you could make yourself heard.

  Doing these things will increase your chances of being seen but they
 aren't a guarantee.  You should try to find civilization rather than
 simply waiting to be rescued.  If you see a source of water, follow it,
 towns and cities are always formed along rivers and small mountain
 streams often flow into rivers.  Certainly if you see any power lines
 then following them is a good bet, however they can go on for many
 miles without entering a town.

 This is a small shop with a single row of shelves.  The shelves and
 walls are covered with dusty items that appear to be laid out in no
 particular organized manner. The store owner, Mr Bellywags, greets you.
 He is an old man who's about as dilapidated as this store.  Even so he
 has a friendly smile, probably because you're the first customer he's
 seen in ages. A small hunting rifle is for sale here. A knife is for
 sale here. A canteen is for sale here. A backpack is for sale here. A
 trail mix pack is for sale here.

  One example: You can make a trap to catch a small woodland animal by

 sideways...

  The supports of the bridge are collapsing!  You and your car are
 sliding off the edge!

  You feel a sensation of falling, time appears to be slowing down.

  As the car slips off the edge of the falling bridge the world appears
 to be turning upside down as the car is flipped over.

  In slow motion you have become one with the rain, the falling wooden
 splinters, your car and the various items flying around in it.

  The only thought going through your mind is "This is going to hurt".

  Your car hits the soft muddy hillside which has a sharp angle and it
 slows your fall enough to avoid death on impact.  The impact shatters
 your side windows and tiny pieces of broken glass join the chaos of
 wood and what appears to be blood.

  You spend some time sliding rapidly down the hill along with the
 flowing rain water. Bridge pieces are along for the ride, the largest
 ones miraculously miss your car.

   The car is quickly approaching a ghostly image of your girlfriend
 who's cackling feindishly at your impending demise.  After a moment you
 are relieved to discover that it's actually a boulder which has stood
 up to the mudflow and isn't about to be motivated by an out of control
 car.

  Upon impact  you are lurched forward but your seatbelt keeps you
 locked in place.  It hurts bad but it looks like bruising and some
 superficial bleeding is the only real damage you'll take away from
 this.  The car, however, is done for.
 Exhausted you pass out.  Cold, hungry, thirsty, and still shaken up
 from the accident you have a horrible night's sleep.

 It certainly wasn't the kind of sleep you're used to, but it did you
 some good anyway.  A new day has arrived, maybe you will be rescued
 this day.
 It is now pitch dark in here!

 The Hillside (in the car)
 You are on the hillside below the old bridge which has collapsed.  Rain
 has washed away much of the hill and made it impassible due to the soft
 mud and steep incline.  The only way you can go now is down the hill.

  Now that the rain has subsided you can get a closer look at the
 damage. It appears that a few of the key bridge supports may have been
 cut, rather than ripped away naturally!

 peculiar. I didn't know what you were doing at a pauper's burial.

 The Hollowed Out Tree
 You are in a large tree which seems to be living healthily despite the
 fact that the first 7 feet or so off the ground is hollow.  This place
 might serve as an okay shelter but for the fact that the ground is wet
 and mucky. There are some vines here. There is a stash of acorns here,
 no doubt left behind by some squirrels.

 can be made by trying to COMBINE two things together.

  One example: You can make a trap to catch a small woodland animal by
 COMBINE some sort of rigid frame (such as a coat hanger) WITH some sort
 of cord (such as twine, or a strong vine).

  You wonder what other things you might be able to put together?.

 one day they might become like me. And then I see him. I was coming to
 Duke's Lane, nothing on either side except a huge brick wall. He was a
 short fat little man. Our steps blurred in the quiet thoroughfare.
 What was he stopping for? Was he taking caution? Did he think me a
 gangster or something? I suppose I looked like something that had
 crawled out of a piece of cheese.

 Well sir, let me tell ya what, aint nobody could survive a crash like

 You put Lint on the rocky slab.

 On the radio:
 LIL: Oh Joe, fifty smackers! Oh I love you!
  JOE: Lil went to get some groceries and a couple bottles of beer. I
 sat on the bed and had a further look at the wallet. Having taken the
 money out I thought it'd be empty. There were two pockets both with
 plastic windows. The first held a card that said Harold Maxsted, Twenty
 Six Fairly Street, Ornsby. Then I looked at the second plastic window.
 There were strange words printed on a white card. It said: I am not
 dead, I a subject to a form of Cataleptic Illness which may appear to
 cause death. If I am found please inform Doctor Alfred Miller, Ornsby,
 6641.

>light lint
 On the radio:
 JOE: No, No it can't be. Not dead. Cataleptic. What have I done? What
 have I done? They'll think he's, I must telephone. But Lil, she'll
 wonder where I've gone. I've given her all my money.

>burn lint
 On the radio:
 LIL: Here all right, I got a bit. Take these bottles from me will you?
 Joe, what is it?
  JOE: What time is it Lil?
  LIL: I don't know, the pub's just opened. I'd say about sixish, why?

>turn on lighter

 On the radio:
 JOE: Give me ten bob. Do you have any change? I need some silver. I
 have to telephone. I won't be long.
  LIL: What is it?
  JOE: I just have to telephone someone.

 You put Lint on the rocky slab.

 guy without knowing he was a cataleptic? Thinking he was dead.

 JOE: This would be the number of the doctor in the wallet.

 You put Shack Wood on the rocky slab.

  MAN'S VOICE: Dr. Miller has gone abroad he's been away for the past
 six weeks.

 doctor there must be plenty&

  When foraging for food it is important to consider that there are
 three kinds of mushrooms:

  There are discusting mushrooms (which is the kind you get at the local
 supermarket), there are poisonous mushrooms which will either make your
 life a living hell for a few days or kill you (or both), and there are
 psychadelic (magic) mushrooms which will make you think you've
 accidently eaten poisonous mushrooms.

  In the event that you *think* that you've eaten poisonous mushrooms,
 you should change your thought pattern to assume that you have eaten
 magic mushrooms.  This will keep you from having a bad trip and maybe
 you'll even be given a vision or something, who knows.  If it turns out
 that they were poisonous, there really isn't much you could have done
 about it anyway being stranded out in the middle of nowhere on your
 own, so why bother worrying about it?

  Note: Do not read this chapter while you are experiencing the effects
 of mushrooms.

 On the radio:
 JOE: I'm sorry. Thank you.
  JOE: And then another thought seeped into my brain. Under ground, a
 long wooden box and a man being buried, being buried alive and a shovel
 heaping earth on the wooden boards.

 On the radio:
 (The sound of flipping pages)
  JOE: There must be a Maxsted in the telephone directory.
  JOE: There was, fourteen Maxsteds, everyone alive and bad tempered.

  To start a fire you will need many different types of burning material
 and an ignition source.  You will need to be in a relativly calm
 environment (away from winds and rain) and you will need patience.

  To get started you need to set aside an area where the fire will burn,
 this is called the firepit.  To do this simply MAKE FIREPIT, then it's
 just a matter of putting the right kinds of things into the pit, and
 then igniting it somehow.

  There are 3 main types of material you will need; tinder, kindling,
 and logs.  Tinder refers to a very light, very flamable material that
 usually burns up very quickly.  This could be as simple as pocket lint.
 Or, you can create tinder by using a knife on wood to create wood
 shavings.  Kindling refers to small twigs which burn fairly easily once
 exposed to a fire, but are difficult to ignite on their own.  And logs
 can refer to any size log from 1/2 inch diameter up.

  All material will need to be completely dry.  You will not be able to
 get wood from a freshly cut tree to burn easily.  Such wood will only
 burn once a hot fire has evaporated all the water from within it.

  Your ignition source would be, ideally, a cigarette lighter or some
 matches.  Failing that there are a plethora of other means of starting
 fires.  These include: Sunlight magnification, sparks from flint &
 steel, and friction from rubbing dry wood together.

  To use sunlight magnification, use a lens (such as from eyeglasses) to
 focus the sun's light onto your tinder.  Make the "dot" as tiny as
 possible.  Once the tinder starts to burn quickly deposit it under your
 stacked up kindling.  Blowing on it gently might help it ignite.

  Flint combined with Steel can produce sparks which can ignite tinder.
 If you have something made of steel and a flint stone you can COMBINE
 those two which will give you a decent fire starter.

 On the radio:
 MAXSTED: No I have no relatives who suffer from a cataleptic illness.
 Perhaps there are a few other Maxsteds in the book, try them.
  JOE: I have, you're Mr. Zacharia Maxsted, you're the last on the list.
  MAXSTED: Well I can't help you.

 On the radio:
 JOE: What now? Do I go along to the police and say, Look I stole a
 man's wallet, someone might be shoving him into six foot of earth. What
 do I do? I decided to sleep on it. Sleep? That's a laugh.
  JOE:(in his sleep) Uh, buried alive. Love you Lil. Love. Please,
 pinching white..

>make firepit
 combustible materials.  You will then need to light the fire with
 something.

 On the radio:
 HAROLD MAXSTED: They're putting me in a wooden box and its your fault
 Joe Alish. I'm struggling for breath. They're going to bury me, bury me
 deep. Not deep enough Joe. Get me out of this or I will make you
 suffer, here on earth and in the beyond.

 On the radio:
 ADVERTISMENT: Get Three Fives. Get the Taste. Three Fives by State
 Express. Get the taste of international success. The taste that's
 uniquely Three Fives. Only when no expense is spared in its making can
 a cigarette taste so light, so smooth, so satisfying. Three Fives. Get

 that has made Three Fives the king size cigarette of international
 success. Get Three Fives. Get the taste.

>take all
 Lint: Taken.
 dry twigs: Taken.

 On the radio:
 NARRATOR: Well, well, well. Joe Alish had better do something about it
 pretty soon. Otherwise the poor unfortunate cataleptic gentlemen will
 be stiff with the cold. But let us see what he does do.

>put lint in firepit

 On the radio:
 Marla Kramer will get on her feet with the help of a life insurance
 policy from URS insurance which has been paid to her, despite the lack
 of solid proof of Jeffery's death.

>put twigs in firepit

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Death. I didn't know what to do. It had been less than six hours
 since I saw that chap fall. Maybe he's still there. Maybe if I go back
 to Duke's lane he will still be lying there.
  (the sound of a door opening)
  LIL: Joe?

>put wood in firepit

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Oh, sorry hunny, I didn't want to wake you up.
  LIL: It's the middle of the night, where are you going?
  JOE: I won't be long.

>drink canteen

 On the radio:
 LIL: No Joe, you're not going anywhere. I thought you've been acting
 strange. Oh Joe, I know I've nagged and threatened you but it was only
 because you were getting so down, so beaten. I love you Joe. Otherwise
 you

>light firepit

 On the radio:
 JOE: It isn't that at all. All right Lil, I'll tell you. Then you will
 see why I have to go.
  JOE: And so I told her. Told her the whole story of how I robbed a man
 I thought was dead, a corpse that had no use for the fifty quid in his
 wallet.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 Breaking news this hour, the rain storm and flash flood we experienced
 recently has resulted in the collapse of the old wooden bridge on the
 southern highway.

>light firepit with lighter

 On the radio:
 Crews are doubling their efforts to complete the new bridge, and it is
 expected to be operational in a few months.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 JOE: So you see I have got to find him, or find out where they're
 taking him. They will think he's dead Lil.
  LIL: Oh Joe, Joe. Someone will have found him by now. He's probably
 lying in bed fast asleep. People who have these sorts of fits, they
 recover.
  JOE: No they don't. After I found all the Maxsteds I could I went to
 the library and I looked it up. Unless they get assistance they can
 stay that way for days. By then they, will bury him and you know what
 that makes me? A murderer. I'm letting a man die for fifty quid.

 LIL: Oh no Joe. What if you phone the police station, what if you call
 the Ornsby police station and tell them& Oh no Joe, you can't do that.
 They will call you a thief and pu you away. Look, I'm getting dressed
 and coming with you. Where did you say it was, Duke's Lane? (fades

  It looks like you could go almost anywhere from here.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming

 On the radio:
 LIL: Joe, lets pray he's still there.
  JOE: It might be worse. He might have died for lack of attention. Lets
 pray someone saw him and took him to the hospital and they realized he
 wasn't, wasn't dead.
  LIL: Shh, a cop.

>go east
 COP: It's a bit nippy this time of morning isn't it? You're up late
 aren't you?
  JOE: Yeah that's right.

 The Field
 You are in a large open field with dense forest surrounding it.  You

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming

 On the radio:
 LIL: There was a little commotion in Duke's Lane a few hours ago so my

  COP: Oh yes, yes just before I came on duty. Postman saw a bloke lying
 in the lane here. Drop dead.

  JOE: They're sure he's dead?
  COP: So the police surgeon said. Why, know anything about it?

 The trap is empty.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming

 On the radio:
 LIL: No, we don't know anything about it; it was just that, we wondered
 if it was anyone we knew is all.
  COP: Oh, well I believe they've identified him all right. If you knit
 around to the station they may be able to tell you.
  LIL: Oh I don't think it's anyone we know. Come on love, it's too cold

 this afternoon, he's in the Ornsby mortuary. Cardiac failure. This is

 surgeon Dr. Herbert Spencer. He may have been a cataleptic, I don't
 know about that but he died of heart failure. Being buried in a
 pauper's grave at Ornsby cemetery this afternoon. Didn't die of heart
 failure indeed. Ha! Not dead.

 JOE: I don't know. To get drunk. I don't know anything anymore.
  JOE: Even my glass of beer went sour in my mouth. I had bought it with
 blood money, the blood of Harold Maxsted. I left the pub and walked.
 They were burying him in a pauper's grave were they? I didn't ask my
 feet to move towards the cemetery, it seemed they didn't belong to me.
 They were burying him as I got there, a minister, a gravedigger and an
 old man, obviously the caretaker and the police sergeant. I wanted to
 shout - Don't! Don't put him in that grave he's not a corpse he's
 alive. I couldn't. Those three stripes on the copper's sleeve seemed to
 represent the number of years I might get for stealing and withholding
 information. I ran from the cemetery as though I was running from the
 vengeance of Maxsted himself.

 good thing the coffin was a cheap one. Maybe the coffin maker gutted
 it, maybe there are holes in it. Maybe the poor swine will be able to

 myself into a murderer. I've let you in on it too, they will say you're

 us?

 This is a small cave, it doesn't go anywhere.  Also if you manage to

 On the radio:

 both starving. No one can have you up for, for murder.
  JOE: That's beside the point now isn't it Lil? He's down there
 struggling for breath isn't he? He won't be struggling for long. I
 don't know anything about cataleptics but you can't be nailed inside a
 coffin underneath six feet of earth long. Look out the window Lil, it's

 same bloke?

>go north
 JOE: Positive. I know it's the same bloke, his accusing face follows me
 around, sleeping and waking.
  CARETAKER: Ah well young man, come and have a look with me. We don't
 give them much of a tombstone these paupers. There you are. Sidney
 Frasier, born February the 6 1920 died December the 5 1967.

 Hill
 You have climbed a small hill.  It is tall enough to see over the young
 trees but too small to see over the tall trees in the old growth forest
 to the south.  From here you can see a cliff (which you were driving
 on) to the north, a waterfall to the northwest, and possibly an old
 trail to the northeast.

  You can get off the hill by going north or south.  It appears that
 there is a path around this hill to either side (west and east) but
 there's no way down to those paths from here.

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: I've told you everything, they've given him the wrong name.
  CARETAKER: You better tell that to the police constable. I'm sorry
 about this young man, I warned you. I thought I was too old to take you
 on my own, when you started opening that grave I ran to the cemetery
 office and phoned the police.

>go northwest

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Oh well, its almost a relief in a way.

>SAVE

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 COP: Hello, whats going on here. Oh its you again. Your missus was in
 the police station this morning with some nonsense about... Eh? Digging
 up a grave are you? There's something fishy going on. When I told my
 sargeant that your wife came in and we were burying someone who's a
 cataleptic and who's not dead he nearly strangled me. Said I should
 have taken full particulars, said I ought to charge you both with
 causing a public nuisance. This fella Sidney Frasier has had heart
 trouble for years. Sometimes an ordinary hospital had the pleasure of
 his company, more often than not it was a prison hospital. Our
 policesargant warned him he hadn't had long to live. Your wife comes in
 with a cockabull story we're burying him alive. As if we didn't know
 him. Sidney Frasier. In his day he was the finest pick pocket in
 Ornsby.

>jump

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Pickpocket?
  COP: Yeah, Why only the other day we had a complaint from Mr. Maxsted
 that someone had stolen his wallet. Bloke accosted him at a bus stop
 and started running. From his description we knew it was Sid.

 was a pickpocet. hahah
  COP: You'd better pull yourself together. Ah now what are you doing
 here and why is this grave open?

>jump down waterfall

 On the radio:
 CARETAKER: Oh that's all right constable. Our young friend here gota

  COP: Then why did you ring the police and say there was a suspicious
 character lurking in the cemetery?

 On the radio:
 Mr. Bellywags witnessed the collapse and had this to say: "It was the
 darndest thing ya ever did see, I saw a man in a car, who not long

 highway, best deals in town come and check us out), just slide right
 off the edge.  So I gets outa my car`n look down ta see if`n he was ok.
 Well sir, let me tell ya what, aint nobody could survive a crash like

>drink canteen

 On the radio:
 Police have identified the car as belonging to Mr. Jeffery Kramer, a
 local resident, his body was not found in the car.

>go north
 The local search and rescue, which consists of one retired sea captain,
 claims that he has searched the forest over and has not found any sign
 of Mr. Kramer.  Although it should be noted that our local search and
 rescue has never rescued anyone, and no one has actually witnessed any
 searches happening.

 New Forest
 This is a fairly new forest, the trees here are relatively young and
 small.  You can see the tops of much older and taller trees to the
 south.  You can also go just about any other direction other than west
 or east.

 On the radio:
 A memorial service for the late Mr. Kramer was held today, his widow,
 Marla, was there and willing to speak with the community on this radio
 station.

>go north
 Marla Kramer (or as you know her, Colleen Bitchwitch): "We had only
 been married for a few months but it was the happiest months of my
 life, I will miss you dearly Jacob, (Reporter whispering: Jeffery), I

 The Brook
 You are standing beside a brook which flows from the northeast to the
 southwest. There are some young trees to the south.

 On the radio:

 Cliff
 You are standing at the base of a cliff.  At the top of the cliff is
 the highway you were driving on.  There appears to be no way to climb
 this cliff. A brook is coming out of a opening at the base of the cliff
 and flows southwest.  There is also forest to the south. A few
 head-sized stones are here also.

 On the radio:
 CARETAKER: Well it seems I was mistaken, thats all constable. In fact
 we were both mistaken. Weren't we young man? Haha, Pickpocket hoho
 Cataleptics.

 The sun is beginning to set and it's getting considerably colder.

>examine stones

 On the radio:
 JOE: Hahahaha
  HOST: Well, well, well. Someone should have told Joe Alish that
 lifting wallets off cataleptic gentlemen is a most grave offense. In
 fact it is likely to inccur a most stiff penalty.

 On the radio:
 NARRATOR: The cemetery caretaker and the ashen face, trembling young
 man make an odd pair as they stand by an open grave under the pale
 moon. In the grave itself is a coffin. The lid has been pryed open and
 inside, the corpse of a middle aged man. The caretaker warns -

>look under tree

 On the radio:
 Breaking news this hour, the rain storm and flash flood we experienced
 recently has resulted in the collapse of the old wooden bridge on the
 southern highway.

>take moss

>go southwest
 CARETAKER: Oh I've heard about blokes like you. Read about grave
 robbers. I never thought I'd come across one. Here, I've sent for the
 cops young man. Don't you try any rough stuff, I'm a match for you any
 day.

 New Forest
 This is a fairly new forest, the trees here are relatively young and
 small.  You can see the tops of much older and taller trees to the
 south.  You can also go just about any other direction other than west
 or east.

 On the radio:

 there's no way down to those paths from here.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Desecrated you say. Isn't it desecration to bury a man while he's
 still alive?

>go south
 CARETAKER: Eh, eh. What's he talking about? You don't think people go
 around being buried alive these days do you? I don't know what to make
 of you. I watched you this afternoon; I thought you looked a bit,
 peculiar. I didn't know what you were doing at a pauper's burial.

 The Old Forest
 You are in the old growth forest.  This is obvious by the height and
 diameter of the trees.  The ground is covered with a thick layer of
 various bits shed from the trees over the eons.
  It looks like you could go almost anywhere from here.

 On the radio:
 JOE: He shouldn't have had a pauper's burial. He shouldn't have been
 buried at all. I could have saved him.

 The sun has set, you find it hard to see and every shadow looks like it
 might be a vicious animal.

>go west
 CARETAKER: You'd better think up a good story. Something told me that
 you were up to no good. Nah, don't you try any rough stuff, I already
 warned you. I watched you; the police are on their way. Breaking open a
 coffin like that. Eh, I knew you were up to something but I never
 thought&

 Collapsed Shack
 There is a large pile of dead wood here.

>go south
 Police have identified the car as belonging to Mr. Jeffery Kramer, a

 Logging Road North
 This appears to be an old logging road. The road stretches on to the
 southwest. A massive fallen oak tree blocks the path.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Nothing, except I'm responsible for his death. I touched him. He's
 cold& cold as death.

>use axe on tree

>use axe
 should go about using the axe maybe I can help you.

 On the radio:
 CARETAKER: He's only been in the ground a few hours; they don't stay
 cold like that. Sometimes we get an exhumation order, we have to dig
 "em up. You'd be surprised how cold they get.

 On the radio:
 JOE: He is dead isn't he? I brought this mirror with me, there's no
 breath. Look.

 morgue for two days; he's given a pauper's burial. Now then what's this
 all about young man. I want to go home. He was dead all right when they
 buried him.

 On the shortwave:
 I can tell that you are trying to talk because I'm picking up a carrier
 wave from you

 On the radio:
 JOE: I didn't even know he existed until 2 days ago. I'd been trapped
 in the streets looking for work. I didn't want to go home. If you can
 call that one room Lil and I occupy a home. It was still ringing in my
 ears the things she shouted at me as I left there& (the scene fades
 out)

>go east
 LIL: I've come to the end of my tether. I've pawned everything. Look,
 look even the wedding ring you slipped on my finger in the church. What
 did he say, and all thy worldly goods. Ha that's a laugh, you were
 going to share all your worldly goods were you? Well if you don't get
 some money or a job I'm walking out on you. Do you hear? I'm walking
 out on you and I'll go and live with my sister. At least I'll get some
 warmth and three square meals a day.

 The Field
 You are in a large open field with dense forest surrounding it.  You
 can leave to the west but there are no other exits. You think you saw a
 rabbit run by, but it was so quick it could have been your imagination.
 You also see here a trap.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Aw don't say that Lil. Was it my fault I fell sick and couldn't
 work in the factory any more. I've tried dear I really have. Everywhere
 I go they look at me and say no vacancies.

 What was that?!  Did you hear that?  You are starting to get a little
 freaked out by the noises of the nocternal wildlife.

>examine trap

>look in trap
 Breaking news this hour, the rain storm and flash flood we experienced
 recently has resulted in the collapse of the old wooden bridge on the

 The trap is empty.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 JOE: I know honey I know, I'll get something today I promise.

>open shortwave
 to open it up you'll have to tell me how to do that.


 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 JOE: It was a promise I couldn't keep. Pounding the pavement. Watching
 the dislike and fear in the eyes of the world as I passed by. Fear that
 one day they might become like me. And then I see him. I was coming to
 Duke's Lane, nothing on either side except a huge brick wall. He was a
 short fat little man. Our steps blurred in the quiet thoroughfare.
 What was he stopping for? Was he taking caution? Did he think me a
 gangster or something? I suppose I looked like something that had
 crawled out of a piece of cheese.

 quid here at least. Poor swine, what good is his money now? I'd better
 call a cop.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming

 money out I thought it'd be empty. There were two pockets both with
 plastic windows. The first held a card that said Harold Maxsted, Twenty
 Six Fairly Street, Ornsby. Then I looked at the second plastic window.
 There were strange words printed on a white card. It said: I am not
 dead, I a subject to a form of Cataleptic Illness which may appear to
 cause death. If I am found please inform Doctor Alfred Miller, Ornsby,
 6641.

  It can take a long time to make a good shelter.  Afterwards you will
 want to make a fire and that will take time as well.  If you don't
 think you have enough time to pull it off, you should try to find a
 ready-made shelter.

  Quick and dirty shelters include: A cave, a hole (if you have a shovel
 you can make one) it's not pretty but it will keep the wind off of you,
 pointless in the rain though, or a hollowed out tree (as good as a
 cave, but smaller).

  If you are ready to try to make a shelter you will need some
 materials.  Aside from a roof to keep rain off of you, you should
 consider what you will sleep on.  You will want some place dry, and to
 make it difficult for insects to get to you.  Some boards raised up by
 some stones might do the trick, although some creepy crawlies will
 manage to get up the stones and around the boards it at least makes it
 diffcult.

  Flying insects can be kept at bay by the smoke of a nearby campfire
 just outside of your sleeping area, which you'll want to have anyway
 for your own warmth.  See Chapter Three for information about fires.

  The simpliest shelter is made by using a low-hanging tree branch as
 the roof support and leaning logs against it.  Then fasten the tarp or
 other covering to those logs.  If you don't have any covering you can
 use branches from pine trees, cut them off with a knife and tie each
 branch to your logs.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Give me ten bob. Do you have any change? I need some silver. I
 have to telephone. I won't be long.
  LIL: What is it?
  JOE: I just have to telephone someone.

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 LIL: You're not going gambling are you? You haven't got the bug? You're
 not betting on tomorrow's races or anything like that are you Joe?
 There are all those bills to be paid
  JOE: I know Love, I know. No I'm not gambling but I need it please.
 I'll be back in a little while. It's just that. Please Lil.

>read chapter four

  Rescue depends on one simple principal: You coming on contact with
 others!

  This can be achieved in one of two ways, and it is best to try both as
 much as possible.

  First, try to make yourself visible as much as possible.  Try
 arranging rocks in the form of an arrow in the direction of your
 travel.  This will not only help others find you but should keep you
 from running around in circles.

  Keeping a fire going is essential, fires produce smoke and smoke may
 be the only sign of your existance that's visible over the tree-line.
 A smokey fire will greatly enhance your odds of being rescued.  Once
 you have a fire going put some smoldering material on the fire, such as
 dry leaves, which don't burn well but do cause a lot of smoke.

  Of course, it would be ideal if you could simply talk to civilization.
 Cell phones are usually not useable in remote areas however shortwave
 radios may be helpful.  Small portable radios may not transmit very
 far, especially when their batteries are weak or they have ineffective
 antennas.  But there are things you can do to increase the transmition
 radius: If you could break open such a radio and solder on some other
 kind of antenna (such as a copper wire) to the antenna leads then
 perhaps you could make yourself heard.

  Doing these things will increase your chances of being seen but they
 aren't a guarantee.  You should try to find civilization rather than
 simply waiting to be rescued.  If you see a source of water, follow it,
 towns and cities are always formed along rivers and small mountain
 streams often flow into rivers.  Certainly if you see any power lines
 then following them is a good bet, however they can go on for many
 miles without entering a town.

 On the radio:
 LIL: All right. Here.

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:

  LIL: Joe!

 Mr. Bellywags witnessed the collapse and had this to say: "It was the
 darndest thing ya ever did see, I saw a man in a car, who not long
 before had been shopping at my store (off milepost 19 on the northern
 highway, best deals in town come and check us out), just slide right
 off the edge.  So I gets outa my car`n look down ta see if`n he was ok.
 Well sir, let me tell ya what, aint nobody could survive a crash like
 that is was gruesome!"

 The Old Forest
 You are in the old growth forest.  This is obvious by the height and
 diameter of the trees.  The ground is covered with a thick layer of
 various bits shed from the trees over the eons.
  It looks like you could go almost anywhere from here.

 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: It's all right love.
  (the sound of a door closing)

>go north
 JOE: Would I be too late with the phone call? Would they bury this poor
 guy without knowing he was a cataleptic? Thinking he was dead.
  (The sound of change going into payphone and dialing)

 Hill
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: This would be the number of the doctor in the wallet.
  (The sound of a phone ringing)

>go north
 Police have identified the car as belonging to Mr. Jeffery Kramer, a
 local resident, his body was not found in the car.

 New Forest
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 MAN'S VOICE: Hello
  JOE: Can I speak to Dr. Miller please?
  MAN'S VOICE: Dr. Miller has gone abroad he's been away for the past
 six weeks.

>go north
 JOE: Abroad, oh no. Have you taken over his practice sir?
  MAN'S VOICE: No, no I'm not a medical man but if you're in need of a
 doctor there must be plenty&

 The Brook
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 You are becoming very thirsty.

 On the radio:
 JOE: No, No it isn't that. You don't know which hospital Dr. Miller was
 at?
  MAN'S VOICE: I'm afraid I can't help you. I must go, my wife is
 shouting, dinner is on the table.

>drink water
  You can also FILL your canteen with water so that you can carry it
 with you.
>go up
 The local search and rescue, which consists of one retired sea captain,
 claims that he has searched the forest over and has not found any sign
 of Mr. Kramer.  Although it should be noted that our local search and
 rescue has never rescued anyone, and no one has actually witnessed any
 searches happening.

 The Hillside
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 On the radio:
 JOE: I'm sorry. Thank you.
  JOE: And then another thought seeped into my brain. Under ground, a
 long wooden box and a man being buried, being buried alive and a shovel
 heaping earth on the wooden boards.

>examine car
 it difficult to remember that incident as it hasn't occured yet. On the
 back of the car is a bumper sticker.

 On the radio:
 (The sound of flipping pages)
  JOE: There must be a Maxsted in the telephone directory.
  JOE: There was, fourteen Maxsteds, everyone alive and bad tempered.

 On the radio:
 MAXSTED: No I have no relatives who suffer from a cataleptic illness.
 Perhaps there are a few other Maxsteds in the book, try them.
  JOE: I have, you're Mr. Zacharia Maxsted, you're the last on the list.
  MAXSTED: Well I can't help you.

>go down
 JOE: What now? Do I go along to the police and say, Look I stole a
 man's wallet, someone might be shoving him into six foot of earth. What
 do I do? I decided to sleep on it. Sleep? That's a laugh.
  JOE:(in his sleep) Uh, buried alive. Love you Lil. Love. Please,
 pinching white..

 The Brook
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 On the radio:
 HAROLD MAXSTED: They're putting me in a wooden box and its your fault
 Joe Alish. I'm struggling for breath. They're going to bury me, bury me
 deep. Not deep enough Joe. Get me out of this or I will make you
 suffer, here on earth and in the beyond.

 Cliff

 On the radio:
 A memorial service for the late Mr. Kramer was held today, his widow,
 Marla, was there and willing to speak with the community on this radio
 station.

>examine rocks

 Marla Kramer (or as you know her, Colleen Bitchwitch): "We had only
 been married for a few months but it was the happiest months of my
 life, I will miss you dearly Jacob, (Reporter whispering: Jeffery), I
 mean Jeffery"

 An Overgrown Trail
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 On the radio:
 NARRATOR: Well, well, well. Joe Alish had better do something about it
 pretty soon. Otherwise the poor unfortunate cataleptic gentlemen will
 be stiff with the cold. But let us see what he does do.

 Exhausted you pass out.  Cold, hungry, thirsty, and still shaken up
 from the accident you have a horrible night's sleep.

 It certainly wasn't the kind of sleep you're used to, but it did you
 some good anyway.  A new day has arrived, maybe you will be rescued
 this day.
>go north
 Cliff
 You are standing at the base of a cliff.  At the top of the cliff is
 the highway you were driving on.  There appears to be no way to climb
 this cliff. A brook is coming out of a opening at the base of the cliff
 and flows southwest.  There is also forest to the south. A few
 head-sized stones are here also.

 The sun is once again shining brightly.

 An Overgrown Trail
 You are on an overgrown trail.  From here you can go north, and
 southwest. You see an old moss covered fallen tree here.

>go southwest
 New Forest
 This is a fairly new forest, the trees here are relatively young and
 small.  You can see the tops of much older and taller trees to the
 south.  You can also go just about any other direction other than west
 or east.

>go south
 Hill
 You have climbed a small hill.  It is tall enough to see over the young
 trees but too small to see over the tall trees in the old growth forest
 to the south.  From here you can see a cliff (which you were driving
 on) to the north, a waterfall to the northwest, and possibly an old
 trail to the northeast.

  You can get off the hill by going north or south.  It appears that
 there is a path around this hill to either side (west and east) but
 there's no way down to those paths from here.

>go south
 The Old Forest
 You are in the old growth forest.  This is obvious by the height and

  It looks like you could go almost anywhere from here.

 You are in a large open field with dense forest surrounding it.  You
 can leave to the west but there are no other exits. A rabbit has been
 caught in the trap. In a trap is berries.

>go southwest
 The Cave
 This is a small cave, it doesn't go anywhere.  Also if you manage to
 start a fire in here the stone walls should radiate the heat back at
 you. A rocky slab is the only part of the floor of the cave that is
 raised up out of the muck and mud. A grizzly bear is sleeping here, on
 the rocky slab. A firepit is here, unlit.

>give rabbit to bear

>wake bear
 You gently nudge the bear and it begins to stir.  An eye of startlement
 is now gazing at you, acompanied by a low growl.

 There's no time to stop and try listening to The Shortwave!  The
 grizzly bear catches up with you and attacks you viciously.  You
 thought a death like this would hurt more but apparently pain doesn't
 set in until after the fact and in this case there is no "after the
 fact" for you.



     *** You have made a hungry bear's day.  You have made a greedy
 woman's day.  You have failed.  ***

 On the radio:
 SHORT FAT MAN: Gasps. Choking sounds.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Governor, are you all right? He can't be. He's conked out. There
 doesn't seem to be any breathing. I wonder who he is. He must have
 something in his pocket. Blimey, look at all this money. Must be fifty
 quid here at least. Poor swine, what good is his money now? I'd better
 call a cop.

>go west
 LIL: (distant) Well if you don't get some money or a job I'm walking
 out on you. Do you hear? I'm walking out.

 The Old Forest
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 JOE: There's nothing anyone can do for this poor swine. They'll find
 him soon enough. What does a guy do in a case like this? Beat it you
 fool, beat it with the first decent money you've had in months.
 Somebody will find him. Run!

>go southwest

  JOE: Lil.
  LIL: Joe, Joe you got some money.

 The Cave
 It is pitch black and you can't see a thing.
 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 JOE: That's right Lil, two five pound notes, thirteen one pound notes
 and the rest in ten bob notes. It all adds up, adds up very nicely,
 fifty quid in all.

>examine fire
 smoke which hopefully someone will notice. The fire is also smoldering
 pretty well.

 On the radio:
 LIL: Oh Joe hunny. Aye, how did you get this money? You didn't go and
 do anything silly did you?
  JOE: Just like what? Rob a bank? I wouldn't know where to start.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 LIL: But, but how did you get it?
  JOE: You'll never believe it. Remember I told you when I was in the
 sanatorium there was this fellow there with the same lung trouble by
 the name of Ted Brown.

 On the radio:

 the doctor wouldn't let me go back to the factory. Wasn't so bad then.
  LIL: All right, what about this Ted Brown?

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 JOE: Well I meet him in the street see; he says he's been looking for
 me everywhere, wanted to repay me the quid.
  LIL: Go on.
  JOE: Well we goes into a pub to have a drink, there was a bookie there
 and Ted says he has a hot tip, fifty to one. It won Lil, fifty smackers

>listen to shortwave
 LIL: Oh Joe, fifty smackers! Oh I love you!
  JOE: Lil went to get some groceries and a couple bottles of beer. I
 sat on the bed and had a further look at the wallet. Having taken the
 money out I thought it'd be empty. There were two pockets both with
 plastic windows. The first held a card that said Harold Maxsted, Twenty
 Six Fairly Street, Ornsby. Then I looked at the second plastic window.
 There were strange words printed on a white card. It said: I am not
 dead, I a subject to a form of Cataleptic Illness which may appear to
 cause death. If I am found please inform Doctor Alfred Miller, Ornsby,
 6641.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

>get on slab
 JOE: No, No it can't be. Not dead. Cataleptic. What have I done? What
 have I done? They'll think he's, I must telephone. But Lil, she'll
 wonder where I've gone. I've given her all my money.
  (the sound of a door opening)

 You get onto the rocky slab.

 You are startled by a growling sound.  But soon discover it is coming
 from your stomach.

 On the radio:
 LIL: Here all right, I got a bit. Take these bottles from me will you?
 Joe, what is it?
  JOE: What time is it Lil?

 After what felt like hours an old man found you and brought you back to
 this place where you rested for the night and woke up in...

 Julieanne's Cabin
 You awake to find that you are in a soft bed in a wood cabin.  The
 smell of a hearty breakfast in the making pervades your nose.  You hear
 a young woman's voice say "Hello there handsome".  There is an exit to
 the northeast. Julieanne, a beautiful young woman, smiles at you.

 Julieanne sets a plate stacked high with steaming hot food down on a
 small table by the window.

 Its steaming hot and looking pretty good after your ordeal.

>eat food
 Julieanne says "Well now you seemed pretty hungry.  Tired too, you
 slept in all morning.  I need to go collect the fish but I don't want
 you taking off without me.  My grandfather asked to talk to you once
 you're awake.  He is in the public house when you're done eating
 okay?".

 Julieanne has left, through the window you can see her walking off down
 a hill toward the beach to the west.

 You eat breakfast. Not bad.

 The Commune Center
 You are standing in the center of a commune. Paths lead off in almost
 every direction.  The Public House (the pub) is northwest, a familiar
 looking logging road is northeast, a foot-path leads southeast, an old

 southwest, and a path leads down to the beach west of here. A sundial
 is here sitting in the center of the commune.

 Public House
 The public house, or The Pub, is a large wood cabin with a large open
 stone fireplace in the center.  A chimney vents the fire's smoke up
 through the ceiling.  There are various tables, benches, sofas, and
 bean-bags.  It appears that a lot of socializing goes on here as most
 of the seating is faced in toward each other in groups of about 8 or 9.
 There are various books in shelves along the walls while a wide array
 of musical instruments are strewn about.

  There is a long bench along one wall. Sitting on the bench is a
 newspaper. Julieanne's elderly grandfather, Billy is here.

>examine newspaper

  In the continuing saga of Mr. Kramer, the motorist now believed to
 have died in the horrific bridge collapse during the recent flash
 floods, we have had the great fortune to speak one-on-one in an
 exclusive interview with his widow, young Marla Kramer.  Marla and Jeff
 have been a couple for only a few months but, as Mrs. Kramer states,
 they were inseparable.  Choking back tears Mrs. Kramer has thanked the
 community for their support during this emotional ordeal but would like
 to assure everyone that she will be okay, financially, and does not
 require any aid.  Mr. Kramer had purchased a life insurance policy from
 URS Insurance for some $500,000 which Marla will receive.

  The search for Jeffery's body has been called off as the lead (infact
 only) member of the search and rescue team, Cpt. Hornblow, has assured
 the community that he has personally explored the area thoroughly and
 there is no trace that Jeffery, or anyone else, has been there.  It is
 believed that he may have fallen from a cliff near where his car was
 found.

  (A photo of the widow choking back tears is in the margins.  Although
 only someone who knows her intimately would recognize this, the widow
 is clearly Colleen in disguise.  It is also interesting to note that
 Hornblow has never once searched for, or rescued anyone.)

 Beach
 This is a beach along the bay.  To the north you can see the cliff
 which you were trapped on and the small brook falling off of it down
 into this bay.  The beach is rocky to the north and south but this area
 has been kept clear of stones and is sandy enough to be comfortable to
 run around on without shoes (although this isn't the season for that).

  There are circles of stones out in the water which are underwater
 during high-tide and exposed during low-tide.  It appears that they use
 this as an easy way to fish, fish get trapped in the circles when the
 tide goes out, they come out and take what they need, then the tide
 comes back and the remainder of the fish are free to go.

 You see Julieanne out in one of the stone circles collecting fish.  The
 bottom of her white dress is soaking wet from the water.  Even though
 it is an unusually warm day, in this season that water must be pretty
 cold.  Yet, somehow, Julieanne seems unaffected by it.

  There is definately a beauty and simplicity here which you find
 appealing.

  A path leads up to the east toward the commune center.  You can see
 the public house sitting on a small cliff north of the path and
 Julieanne's cabin overlooks this beach from a small cliff south of the

 The Commune Center
 You are standing in the center of a commune. Paths lead off in almost
 every direction.  The Public House (the pub) is northwest, a familiar
 looking logging road is northeast, a foot-path leads southeast, an old
 looking cabin is south, Julieanne's (somewhat newer looking) cabin is
 southwest, and a path leads down to the beach west of here. A sundial
 is here sitting in the center of the commune.

 seat.

 Public House
 The public house, or The Pub, is a large wood cabin with a large open
 stone fireplace in the center.  A chimney vents the fire's smoke up
 through the ceiling.  There are various tables, benches, sofas, and
 bean-bags.  It appears that a lot of socializing goes on here as most
 of the seating is faced in toward each other in groups of about 8 or 9.
 There are various books in shelves along the walls while a wide array
 of musical instruments are strewn about.

  There is a long bench along one wall. Julieanne's elderly grandfather,
 Billy is here.

  Julieanne's elderly grandfather, Billy is here.

 You have taken a seat on the bench.

 Julieanne enters and sits down  on the sofa.


 This was the first time you took a seat on the bench, now a full year
 later, it has become quite familiar.  You have been living here happily
 with your new wife Julieanne (well Billy recognizes your marriage even
 if the law thinks you're dead).

  Billy, Julieanne's grandfather, tells you that he wants to leave and
 live out his remaining life in the warm sunshine of the Arizona desert.

  Billy: "Jeffery, I couldn't have asked for a better grandson-in-law.
 I was starting to get worried that my Julieanne would be the lonliest
 girl on the planet and yet she loves this place and never wants to
 leave it.  You have been such a wonderful man to her and I know the two
 of you will be happy together."

  "However before I leave there is one thing I can't let rest.  You see,
 that Colleen woman that was trying to kill you, she must be living the
 good life right now with the insurance money.  One of the former
 residences of this camp, name of Glenn, has a law firm in the city.  On
 my way out I want to get him working on a case to prove her guilt."

  "I know you'd rather lay low and let the rest of the world think
 you're dead, after all you're debts are free and clear, Colleen isn't
 out to get you anymore, and you're happy here off the radar of the real
 world.  But if you can give me anything that I can give to `ol Glenn
 maybe you can eat our cake and have it to."

  "Whatever you might have that could help... When you're ready just let
 me know and we'll `TAKE THE BITCH DOWN` (hint: that's the command you
 want to use when you are ready to submit the evidence!)".

 There is also a large garden area to the east.

 Other Cabins
 There are about 2 dozen empty cabins here in disrepair.  It looks like
 people lived in them some time ago but this place is a ghost town now,
 except for Julieanne and her grandfather.  The garden path is northeast

 Maple Drive
 This is Maple Drive.  This large avenue was designed to serve a large
 commercial district.  The construction on Maple ended prematurely not
 long after it started, to the west is a long and winding gravel road
 that seems to stretch on into infinity

 Along Maple five businesses were constructed, all but one went under
 either before their construction completed or soon after.  The only
 remaining business is "URS Insurance" (which the locals say stands for
 "You Are Screwed Insurance" because they spend a large part of their
 profits on lawyers to find creative ways to not pay on claims).  This
 is Colleen's employer but she isn't here at the moment and besides it's
 the weekend and they're closed.

 working on.  The most recent one is a policy on YOU!
  The policy is for $500,000 and claims your wife who's name is Marla

 never been married.

 With that Billy got in his old truck, navigated the maze of the old
 logging roads, made his way back to town, planned and plotted with his
 friend Glenn, and eventually settled down in Arizona.

  A few months later you heard through the grapevine that the case
 against Colleen was a slam dunk and she's now rotting in prison for
 attempted murder, and even worse (in the eyes of the legal system) of
 insurance fraud.


  After hearing the verdict you and Julieanne settle in for a long comfy
 sleep in the commune, then, you hear a voice...

  Hey! It's me, remember! Ya, me as in you, as in Jeffery Kramer!
 You're the bloke who woke me up from my best dream like over a year
 ago!  Well guess what? I'm BAAACK!  Yup.  It looks like you've done a
 pretty good job for yourself here.  Got that crazy psycho off my back,
 got yourself a good woman, got out of that crazy mortgage business.
 Yup, very well done indeed.

  Well, I'll be taking over now, you understand.  I'm sure you have all
 kinds of "real world" things to contend with.  So just leave it to me
 and I'll treat this lady right, don't you worry `bout it!
