 A century after The Cleansing Rains and a decade since the False Era
 ended and knowledge of the world returned to humanity, civilization
 reappears as independent city-states vie for power and territory.  The
 old borders are no more and new kingdoms struggle to emerge and
 flourish.  Weary of war, destruction, and corruption, many of these
 sovereignties, such as Slezamane and Badushizd, seek to avoid
 conflicts with neighbors and adopt isolationist or diplomatic
 policies.  Some, however, like the Sovereign State of Caleah, maintain
 the ways of war and aggression.

 Native of the ancient village of Euyesus, which sat unseen from most
 of the wars of the world, hidden beyond Fellwater Fen, you were raised
 in an erudite family and trained as an interpreter.  Beyond the Common
 Tongue, which gained prevalence as a trade language, you also speak
 and read the bygone dialect, <span class="floydstyle em">Ixteesh</span>.  It is this talent that
 brings you from Euyesus to Badushizd aboard one of your village's
 bilgescows; a swamp-treading barge used for the minimal trade that
 Euyesus does with a small handful of neighboring city-states.

 Travelling with you is an appointed minder, or what some call a
 bodyguard.  He is a sweaty, foul-mouthed sot but he's a proven soldier
 and loyal to Euyesus and the errand at hand.  His name is Venkath
 Mock.

 On a generally northeastern route, the bilgescow trudged through many
 miles of waterlogged swamp toward the strange and prosperous city of
 Badushizd.  You have just woken and dressed, and the barge will reach
 the city's harbor by midday.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guest Cabin</span>
 This guest cabin barely gives one any real comfort, but on a no-frills
 boat such as this you're lucky to even have a room to yourself.  There
 is no window as everything below deck is also below the bilge line.
 As the barge moves through the muddy swamp waters, a constant and
 hypnotic slushing sound gives the cabin a strange, claustrophobic
 feel.

 A wooden plank bed hangs from one of the walls; no pillow or blanket
 is provided, of course.  A heavy wooden chair sits before a plank
 shelf hanging from another wall; this one being a simple desk surface.
 The only door is starboard (or east, as the boat is currently aimed
 north).

 Someone has slipped a note under your door.

 On the wooden plank shelf is a glowstone lantern (providing light).

 You can also see a leather haversack (closed) here.

>take all

 mysterious note: You pick up the mysterious note from the ground.
 leather haversack: You pick up the leather haversack from the ground.
 glowstone lantern: You take the glowstone lantern from the wooden
 plank shelf.

>examine me

 You are Polt Kober, a young man from the village of Euyesus.  You are
 fifteen years old and small for your age.  Like most of the young
 people in your village, you wear your hair long.  Otherwise, you
 consider yourself unremarkable.  Your only real talent is that you're
 fluent in Ixteesh, an ancient, dead language, along with the Common
 Tongue.

>read note

 <span class="floydstyle em">You are in danger.  Check Rakton's cabin.</span>

>examine haversack

 This handy, leather satchel can be worn and used to carry many items.

>xlantern

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine lantern

 It's your basic traveling lantern, but instead of a flame within, its
 luminescence emits from a glowing, round stone, about the size of a
 fist, instead.  Some glowstone lanterns can be closed to block the
 light.  This isn't one of those, though.

>wear sack

 You put on the leather haversack.

 It is made of black leather and has silver fittings.  It can be worn
 from the belt or waist.

 In the small black scabbard is an antecessor skean.

 So named because it's been handed down in the Kober family for
 generations, this is a double-edged dagger with an ornate hilt.

 (first opening guest door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Centerline Passage Fore</span>
 This is the fore end of the centerline passageway that runs down the
 center of the barge, belowdecks.  The craft is heading north and this
 end of the passage has doors all around but to the south, where the
 passage continues toward the stern.  A short ramp slopes upwards to
 the northeast, taking one topside.

 A heavy, ironwood table is situated here with a chair of matching wood
 and age.  Belowdecks, the air here has a hanging moisture.

 On the ironwood table is an old glowcube (providing light).

 Venkath Mock is leaning against the ironwood table, killing time until
 the bilgescow reaches Badushizd

 Rakton, the First Mate, is here.

 You can also see Warpeye (the cat) here.

 Warpeye the cat scratches under his chin with his hind paw.

 Rakton looks around absently.

 Warpeye (the cat) goes west.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 Ostothas exhales, letting his lips flap like a horse's.

 Ostothas goes east.
 Ostothas closes and locks mate's door.

 You figure it might be best not to try to enter the First Mate's cabin
 when he's here in the room with you.

 You can't see any such thing.

 You are about to ask Rakton what he thought of the note you found, but
 you realize that since it mentions him as potentially dangerous, it
 might not be a good idea.

 Apparently, Rakton is in a huff.

>talk to rakton

 You are already talking to Rakton.

 Venkath adjusts his scabbard and belt.

>topics

 You could ask Rakton about Rakton.

>ask rakton about rakton

 "I've never seen you around in Euyesus." You speak to the First Mate.
 He looks your way for a moment but then basically ignores you.

 Rakton noisily cracks his knuckles.

 Venkath stretches his arms, eager to get off this boat.

 Rakton looks around absently.

 Rakton mumbles something about being excited to get to Badushizd.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Starboard Fore Deck</span>
 You're standing on the deck of The Rhinoceros.  From here, you can see
 the extent of this barge-like craft.  This deck is low to the water
 level as most of the ship is underwater.  There is no railing as it's
 easier to move large cargo onboard that way.  The only structure on
 the deck is toward the very bow (north).  It's the wheelhouse, where
 the captain pilots the craft.  The door into it is closed.  Around the
 other parts of the deck, south, west, and southwest, you can see
 various crates of cargo stacked.  At the very back of the ship, you
 can see the wide stern wheel ceaselessly paddling the ship northwards,
 rhythmically chugging through the desolate, waterlogged swamp.  A
 wide, short ramp leads down to belowdecks.  It is stained from boot
 traffic and swamp water.

 The bilgescow passes close to the black willow trees on the sides of
 the waterway.

>go north

 (first opening Wheelhouse door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wheelhouse</span>
 This forward enclosure is the wheelhouse of the bilgescow.  Glassless
 windows open the walls forward, port, and starboard and the door to
 the rest of the boat is stern (south).  The eponymous wheel is one
 solid piece of red oak and is fixed in the center of the forward
 opening. A small closed hatch in the floor leads below deck.

 Tauzius, the captain of The Rhinoceros, stands by the wheel, casually
 tending to it.  He stares out at the waterways and swamp trees, only
 giving you a glance.

 Outside of the wheelhouse, a strange, swampy smell drifts in.

 Tauzius scratches his beard thoughtfully.

>smell

 You smell nothing unexpected.

 Tauzius watches you warily.

>examine beard

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine wheel

 The ship's wheel is one solid piece of red oak and is fixed in the
 center of the forward opening.

>turn wheel

 You probably shouldn't mess with the ship's wheel while Captain
 Tauzius is controlling it.

>show note to captain

 "That's an interesting mysterious note."

>talk to captain

 You are already talking to Tauzius.

 Outside of the wheelhouse, loud buzzing insects create a clamor.

 The captain glances around the scenery outside the wheelhouse
 enclosure.

>topics

 You could ask Tauzius about Tauzius or the mysterious note.

 Outside of the wheelhouse, you spy a large snake slithering on the
 surface of the brackish water.

>ask about note

 "Someone slid a note under my door some time before morning." You tell
 the Captain, "It warns me about your first mate."

 Captain Tauzius looks pensive for a moment.  Finally, he says, "Rakton
 signed on a few days ago.  I haven't been totally sold on him, really.
 He's a bit too. . .distant for my liking."  Tauzius looks out the
 glassless windows.  "I don't know who gave you that warning, shaver.
 You should avoid Rakton, I guess.  And I will keep my eye on him."

>a captain

 "All in all, an uneventful trip, eh?" You ask the Captain, hoping to
 sound friendly enough.

 Tauzius replies with a sidelong glance.  An uncomfortable air erupts
 between the two of you until he finally speaks.

 "This is the farthest you've been from Euyesus, huh, shaver?" He asks
 you.  You've always hated being called that, but you figure most boys
 do.

 "Yes," you answer, "And I'm not quite sure Badushizd will be my only
 stop."

 Tauzius looks as if he's deciding something before instructing you to,
 "Head down that small hatch to my cabin and fetch me my slide rule.
 If you do, I'll give you something that might keep you safe in your
 travels."

>go down

 (first opening the small hatch)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Captain's Cabin</span>
 Not opulent but certainly a step-up from the cabin <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> were
 given, the captain's room is a large cabin situated below the ship's
 wheelhouse.  In fact, a short spiral staircase leads up to it through
 a small hatch.  The bed is a simple mattress within a heavy wooden
 frame.  An actual ironwood roll-top desk sits against a wall.  A heavy
 chair sits before it.  Over the desk, a detailed map of the swamp
 waterways hangs.  Finally, a wide trunk sits nearby and an exit is to
 the south.

>enter bed

 You get onto the ironwood bed.

>jump

 You jump on the spot.

>examine desk

 The desk's dark wood is a bit incongruous to the rest of the damp but
 lighter colored wood of this ship.  Currently, the desk's roll-top is
 shut.

>open desk

 You open the roll-top desk, revealing a celestial slide rule.

>take all

 celestial slide rule: You take the celestial slide rule from the
 roll-top desk.

 You find nothing of interest.

 This map only details the swampy waterways that surround the village
 of Euyesus.  Other villages dot the map but the only symbol for a city
 is in its upper right corner, where Badushizd is faintly tucked.

>look under mattress

 You find nothing of interest.

>smell mattress

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine rule

 It appears to be a tube, like a small scroll case, perhaps.  The ends
 can be twisted and turned and along the length of the tube,
 mathematical equations to aid in navigation appear and change when you
 do so.

 Outside of the wheelhouse, the black willow trees crowd the waterway.

>give rule to captain

 You hand the strange device over to the Captain.  In return, he takes
 a small jar out of his pocket and hands it to you.

 Outside of the wheelhouse, a strange, swampy smell drifts in.

 Tauzius scratches his beard thoughtfully.

>examine jar

 This is a small jar made of strong glass.

 In the small jar is some weird dirt.

 Outside of the wheelhouse, a couple of fishermen row past the
 bilgescow.

>ask captain about weird dirt
>ask captain about jar

 "So. . .a small jar filled with some weird dirt is supposed to keep me
 safe in my travels?" You ask, skeptical.

 "Throw the dirt at your enemies." Tauzius explains, still casually
 handling the wheel, "It will buy you some time."

 Outside of the wheelhouse, the bilgescow travels past a lone fisherman
 in a small boat.

 You're standing on the deck of The Rhinoceros.  From here, you can see
 the extent of this barge-like craft.  This deck is low to the water
 level as most of the ship is underwater.  There is no railing as it's
 easier to move large cargo onboard that way.  The only structure on
 the deck is toward the very bow (north).  It's the wheelhouse, where
 the captain pilots the craft.  The door into it is open.  Around the
 other parts of the deck, south, west, and southwest, you can see
 various crates of cargo stacked.  At the very back of the ship, you
 can see the wide stern wheel ceaselessly paddling the ship northwards,
 rhythmically chugging through the desolate, waterlogged swamp.  A
 wide, short ramp leads down to belowdecks.  It is stained from boot
 traffic and swamp water.

>go east

 That would take you over the edge and into the swamp.

>jump

 You jump on the spot.

>jump overboard

 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Centerline Passage Fore</span>
 This is the fore end of the centerline passageway that runs down the
 center of the barge, belowdecks.  The craft is heading north and this
 end of the passage has doors all around but to the south, where the
 passage continues toward the stern.  A short ramp slopes upwards to
 the northeast, taking one topside.

 A heavy, ironwood table is situated here with a chair of matching wood
 and age.  Belowdecks, the air here has a hanging moisture.

 On the ironwood table is an old glowcube (providing light).

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Centerline Passage Amidships</span>
 You are in the centerline passage running from the bow to the stern

 Otherwise, you can head up or down the passage, from stem to stern.
 The air down here is thick with moisture and much of the wood around
 you is damp with condensation.

 One of the crew, Ostothas, is here.

 Ostothas examines the galley door.

>enter galley

 (first opening galley door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scow Galley</span>
 This small kitchenette is provided to prepare simple meals for the
 barge's crew.  A small table is here; its top covered by a thick
 chopping block, marred from ages of use.  A note of some sort is on
 it.  A wide cupboard is fastened to one wall and a cast iron stove is
 against another.  The stove's door is closed.  The only exit is port
 (or west, currently).

 You can see Skayawa (the cat) here.

 Skayawa tilts her head and purrs as you stroke under her chin.

 Skayawa the cat sniffs around the cast iron stove.

 You open the cast iron stove, revealing a pile of ashes.

 This cabin is barely bigger than a broom closet.  A patchwork hammock

 again, for the cats.  The only exit is port (or west, currently).

 On the patchwork hammock is Amalek.

>show important note to amalek

 "Interesting."

>examine boy

 Despite his title, he's actually a couple of years older than you, but
 still the crew's youngest.  From what you've witnessed during the two
 days you've been on The Rhinoceros, Amalek is slow to actually get
 anything done and seems to shirk his duties expertly.

>ask amalek about pipe

 (the thick pipe)
 There is no reply.

 Amalek squints and looks at his book closer as if trying to make
 something out.

>topics

 You could ask Amalek about Amalek, the small leather book, the
 mysterious note, Rakton, Skayawa (the cat) or Warpeye (the cat).

>a amalek

 "You never seem too busy." You say to Amalek.

 He doesn't turn his head from his book when he answers, "I'll get to
 it later."

 Amalek moves his dangling foot around as he reads.

>a book

 Which do you mean, <span class="floydstyle em">Elements of Ixteesh</span> or the small leather

>small leather book

 "What are you reading?" You ask.

 Without looking up, he tells you "It's called the <span class="floydstyle em">Helping Friendly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Book</span>."

 Amalek turns a page of the book he's reading.

>a mysterious

 "You don't happen to know anything about a note that's been slipped
 under my door this morning, do you?" You ask the lazy youth.

 "Sorry, stranger," he says with his nose still in his book, "nothing
 at all here."

>a rakton

 "What can you tell me about Rakton, the First Mate?" You ask, trying
 to sound nonchalant.

 "I dunno." Amalek replies, still reading his book.  "He's only been
 onboard less than a fortnight.  Leaves me alone enough, except for his
 asinine notes."

>a cat

 Who do you mean, Skayawa (the cat) or Warpeye (the cat)?

>skayawa

 "Is Skayawa your cat?" You ask Amalek.  He turns a page of his book,
 still reading, as he answers.

 "Well, he's the ship's cat, but I'm the one who cares for him,
 really."

>eat cat food

 You can't see any such thing.

 The cabin boy must've gotten creative trying to solve the lack of a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Starboard Fore Deck</span>
 You're standing on the deck of The Rhinoceros.  From here, you can see
 the extent of this barge-like craft.  This deck is low to the water
 level as most of the ship is underwater.  There is no railing as it's
 easier to move large cargo onboard that way.  The only structure on
 the deck is toward the very bow (north).  It's the wheelhouse, where
 the captain pilots the craft.  The door into it is open.  Around the
 other parts of the deck, south, west, and southwest, you can see
 various crates of cargo stacked.  At the very back of the ship, you
 can see the wide stern wheel ceaselessly paddling the ship northwards,
 rhythmically chugging through the desolate, waterlogged swamp.  A
 wide, short ramp leads down to belowdecks.  It is stained from boot
 traffic and swamp water.

 Rakton is before you, blocking the doorway.  Dangling from his hand is
 the black, leather garrote that was just around your neck.  His eyes

 You meet your bodyguard topside.  The two of you stand behind the
 wheelhouse, watching the swamp finally give way to wide, clearer
 water.  Ahead, in the distance and dark against the bright horizon,
 you see the crowded towers and minarets of the city called Badushizd.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press any key)</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ivory Arch</span>
 Leaving the city's harbor to the south, you made your way here, to the
 Ivory Arch.  It is a single piece of ivory, huge enough to span from
 one side of the boulevard to the other and no man lives who knows
 whence so vast a piece could have come.  Passing through the arch, one
 finds the entire underside covered in countless, detailed carvings;
 mostly statues and visages that seem to reach out from the ivory or
 stare at you as you pass through.  To the north, beyond the ivory
 arch, the buidlings give way to some sort of open town square.

 Your minder, Venkath Mock, is here with a grim countenance.

 You can also see Warpeye (the cat) here.

>examine cat

 Warpeye's long fur is a cacophony of autumn colors but his feet and
 neck are white.  His keen face evinces his many years and his sage
 experience as a cat.  On closer inspection, you see that he is most
 likely named for his left eye which is actually a strange glass stone
 of shifting, indeterminate colors.

>take eye

 That seems to be a part of Warpeye (the cat).

>examine eye

 Warpeye's left eye appears to be a small glass stone of shifting,
 indeterminate colors.  You can only imagine if it actually works or if
 it has different abilities altogether.

 Crowding each other on the inside of the ivory arch are countless
 carved faces, statues, sculptures, and reliefs; some so new, they are
 currently being finsihed, and some so ancient, their creators and
 their meanings are lost to the ages.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lord Phothice's Square</span>
 This town square is hardly a square and more of an askew hexagon.  Its
 dimensions are difficult to tell as the surrounding buildings crowd
 each other for space.  Avenues lead off in almost every direction.
 The southern boulevard leads under a gigantic ivory arch with an
 underside covered in countless carvings.  The way west is blocked by a
 spiked gate.  Beyond it is the courtyard of the inn known as The
 Vulgar Unicorn.  Even in your village, the far away Euyesus, you've
 heard a few tales of the tavern's rowdiness.

 As it's midday, the square is alive with a crowd of people either
 coming and going or doing business with merchants selling various
 commodities from tented booths

 Venkath Mock arrives from the south.

 Warpeye (the cat) arrives from the south.

 Venkath looks around and then rubs his eyes.

>examine gate

 This is a strong, iron gate with spikes at the summit, standing about

 downright impossible to squeeze through the bars.  The gate is

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inn Courtyard</span>
 Nestled within the buildings of Badushizd, this stony courtyard serves
 the patrons of The Vulgar Unicorn as a place to enjoy if the tavern
 gets too noisy.  A dry fountain sits as a centerpiece, surrounded by
 four stone benches with areas of trimmed grass in between.  An open
 spiked gate leads out of this courtyard to the east and a shadowy
 break in the wall to the northwest leads to some sort of dark alley
 between the buildings.  The door into the tavern is to the west.

 On the dry fountain are a periwinkle sadiki bird and a lavender sadiki
 bird.

 Venkath Mock arrives from the east.

 Warpeye (the cat) arrives from the east.

 The lavender sadiki bird looks at you and says, "You're just some

>examine fountain

 (the dry fountain)
 The dry fountain has a wide, circular basin at ground level.  The
 thick sides of the basin are knee-high, made of brick, and provide
 seating like a bench.  In the center of the bottom basin, a stone
 sculpture rises at least ten feet.  It is an abstract thing, sculpted
 to resemble waves, or something that flows at least.  Water probably
 emerged from the top, flowed down the wavy channels of the sculpture
 before landing in the basin below.  Now, only dust remains.

 On the dry fountain are a periwinkle sadiki bird and a lavender sadiki
 bird.

>examine lavender

 Sadiki birds, named for the faraway continent upon which they were
 first discovered, come in a variety of colors and have an impressive
 ability of mimicry.  Unfortunately, sadiki birds have a penchant to
 only squawk curse words and insults at anyone unfortunate enough to be
 nearby.  This particular sadiki bird has lavender colored feathers.

 Venkath looks around and then rubs his eyes.

 The periwinkle sadiki bird looks at you and says, "I smell some sort
 of impertinent, hell-hated barnacle!".

 The lavender sadiki bird looks at Venkath Mock and says, "You're just
 some gorbellied, common-kissing dewberry!".

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tavern Common Room</span>
 Bright and shadowy, all at once, this tavern common room is covered in
 countless burning candles of various shapes, sizes, and colors.  This
 perpetual candlelight has been happening for so long, the floor is
 covered in dry candle wax, stamped into a dust that has become one
 with the floor.  The wooden walls and ceiling are completely covered
 in soot and the patrons through the many decades have taken it upon
 themselves to scrawl graffiti in it with their fingers and knives.

 Across from the front door to the east is a large, curved bar, covered
 in candles and spirits.  In between the front door and the bar are a
 couple of tables and a few scattered chairs, upon which various
 patrons lounge, drinking and smoking, filling the room with a smoky
 aroma of tobacco and herbs.  A wooden staircase leads up.

 Behind the curved bar, a young woman with dreadlocks attends to
 patrons.

 Someone breaks out in a hacking cough.

 Venkath Mock arrives from the east.

 Warpeye (the cat) arrives from the east.

>examine graffiti

 The layers of words, sentences, remarks, ponderings, and symbols go
 back many decades.  Some are crude opinions scribbled in the soot with
 a naked finger, others are intricate scrawls made with a knife or
 other sharp implement.  It seems that the fashion is to express one's
 political leanings or affiliations which makes sense in a landscape of
 city-states hanging in an ever-changing web of alliances and
 hostilities.

 Venkath fidgets with his travel pack.

>examine woman

 (Paevana the alewife)
 Black, dreadlocks awkwardly hang over a furrowed, friendly face.  Big,
 round amber eyes look thoughtfully around the tavern they've watched
 over for so long.  Paevana isn't greatly busy this evening, but still
 steadily works the bar; pouring drinks, clearing glasses, lighting
 candles, and talking to the various patrons.

>talk to woman

 (Paevana the alewife)
 As you approach a little closer, you notice there is a concealed
 staircase behind the bar leading down to a cellar.

 You say hello to Paevana the alewife.

 (You could ask Paevana the alewife about Paevana the alewife, the
 Vulgar Unicorn, Deviah Favash or the room to rent.)

>a vulgar unicorn

 "I've heard of this place." You say to the attractive alewife.  "And
 I'm coming from Euyesus."

 She raises an eyebrow, "Oh yes, the keepers of languages." She says,
 "I heard Xethes mention it recently."

 Before you can ask who Xethes is, she adds, "But yeah, this place has
 been around forever, so it's garnered quite a reputation."

 The herbaceous smell of someone's pipe smoke drifts by.

>a xethes

 "Xethes?" You ask.

 "A friend." She replies, "He's a city official."  She continues to
 work the bar and you get the feeling that's all she's going to say on
 the subject.

>a deviah

 "I'm here to meet someone." You tell her, "Do you know someone called
 Deviah?"

 "Yes," Paevana replies, "she's rented the upstairs back bedroom."

>a room

 "I guess I need a room for the night." You tell Paevana as she
 continues to serve drinks and tidy the bar.  She walks toward your end
 of the bar.

 "For you and your friend?" She asks you, referring to your minder,
 Venkath.

 "Oh, yeah," you tell her, "Him, too."  You hand her a coin given to
 you by your village Headman to pay for the room.

 Paevana produces a key from her pocket and gives it to you.

 "Fine.  Be swift."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pipe-Filled Lavatory</span>
 This strange room is some sort of lavatory, but not like any that
 you've seen back in Euyesus.  There's a commode made of polished wood
 with a small handle nearby. There's also a porcelain sink, but the
 commode has numerous pipes extending from it and clinging to the wall
 before disappearing into it and the sink includes a faucet which is a
 brass spigot also attached to a network of pipes.  Finally, there is
 an old mirror on another wall, affixed between more pipes.  The only
 exit is the door to the north.

>examine mirror

 This mirror is very clean but a couple of the corners look a little
 battered, as if this mirror has been moved around more than a few

 perpetual candlelight has been happening for so long, the floor is
 covered in dry candle wax, stamped into a dust that has become one
 with the floor.  The wooden walls and ceiling are completely covered
 in soot and the patrons through the many decades have taken it upon
 themselves to scrawl graffiti in it with their fingers and knives.

 Across from the front door to the east is a large, curved bar, covered
 in candles and spirits.  In between the front door and the bar are a
 couple of tables and a few scattered chairs.  A wooden staircase leads
 up and a concealed staircase behind the bar leads down to a cellar.

 Behind the curved bar, a young woman with dreadlocks attends to
 patrons.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inn Courtyard</span>
 Nestled within the buildings of Badushizd, this stony courtyard serves
 the patrons of The Vulgar Unicorn as a place to enjoy if the tavern
 gets too noisy.  A dry fountain sits as a centerpiece, surrounded by
 four stone benches with areas of trimmed grass in between.  A closed
 spiked gate leads out of this courtyard to the east and a shadowy
 break in the wall to the northwest leads to some sort of dark alley
 between the buildings.  The door into the tavern is to the west.  It
 is currently open, allowing light and conversational sounds to spill
 out into the courtyard.

 On the dry fountain is a periwinkle sadiki bird.

>go northwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Alley</span>
 This alley is generally crooked, of course, and the way it is
 sandwiched between the buildings blocks almost any natural light,
 leaving  this passage in shadows.  The alley leads southeast (back to
 the inn courtyard) and southwest (deeper into shadow).

 You can see a squirrelly thug here.

>examine thug

 This man is lean and strange with dark circles under his bloodshot
 eyes as if he hasn't slept in years.  His greasy hair has the scraggly
 look of being chopped here and there by sharp implements.  He wears
 dark, stained clothes under a scuffed leather duster.

>talk to thug

 If you approach, he looks like he would rather mug you than talk to
 you.

>go northwest

 You can't go that way.

>go southwest

 The squirrelly thug blocks your way in that direction.  He seems to be
 waiting for you to approach.

>throw dirt at thug

 (first taking the weird dirt)
 You pour the weird dirt from the small jar into your hand.

 You toss the weird dirt at the squirrelly thug.  It hits him without
 any fanfare at all.  But suddenly, he remains fixed in place, unable
 to move any of his body but his eyes.  His eyes dart around,
 terrified, but he cannot move even a finger, leaving him standing
 awkwardly like a frozen scarecrow.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Alley</span>
 [Previous turn undone.]

>go southwest

 You sneak past the paralyzed thug.  His eyes follow you as far as
 possible, until you're past his view and down the alley a bit.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dead End</span>
 The dark alley stops here at a dead end.  The angles of this
 cul-de-sac are contorted so the dark walls are disorienting to make
 out.  The east border is the back of The Vulgar Unicorn, its face
 covered with a gray city ivy known as shalifux,  A round window is up
 the wall on the second floor.  Across from the back of the tavern, a
 tall brick wall blocks what was once another alley.  The only exit is
 back down the dark alley to the northeast.

 On the tall brick wall is a lavender sadiki bird.

 You can also see an old crate here.

>climb ivy

 You painstakingly climb up the back wall of The Vulgar Unicorn,
 grasping the gray shalifux ivy.  When you reach the round window, you
 crawl through, dumping unceremoniously on the floor of the back
 bedroom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Bedroom</span>
 This room is a chaotic mess.  The bed frame and mattress is crooked as
 if someone pushed it or was pushed against it.  A sofa is overturned
 as if flung by a giant hand.  A blood-stained quilt is bunched up on
 the floor.  On the west wall, half of a curtain hangs askew, partially
 covering a round window.  The rest of the curtain is on the floor.
 There is a closed door to the east.

 Finally, on the floor is the still body of Deviah Favash.  She is
 laying in a pool of blood.

>examine body

 This unfortunate woman was Deviah Favash.  Whoever sent for an Ixteesh
 interpreter from your village did so through Deviah and she was to
 explain to you who sent for you and where you're supposed to be.
 Sadly, it appears she has been stabbed a few times in the midsection
 by something incredibly sharp, given the very clean cuts left behind
 in her clothes.

 Without warning, Deviah's eyes snap open, startling you enough to
 shout a quick, "Shit lords!".  She grabs your wrist tightly and
 whispers to you in a slowly dying breath, "<span class="floydstyle em">You must join the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">caravan to Obak!  That is where you are needed!</span>"  She cringes in
 pain for a moment, then struggles to add, "<span class="floydstyle em">They are trying to stop</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">you</span>-" but then, having delivered this message to you, she finally
 dies.

>unlock door

 What do you want to unlock the second bedroom door with?

>open door

 It seems to be locked.

>search body

 You find the second inn key in one of Deviah's pockets.  You
 absent-mindedly grab it.

 This is the upstairs hall of The Vulgar Unicorn.  From below, the
 sounds of the tavern common room rises up the wooden staircase.
 Bedroom doors are set east and west and a lavatory door is to the
 south.  The soot graffiti continues on this floor, as does the smoky
 aroma of tobacco.

 Your minder, Venkath Mock, is here with a grim countenance.

 You can also see Warpeye (the cat) here.

 Venkath looks over your shoulder, into Deviah's room.  He spies her
 lifeless body.

 "What in all the hells?" He mumbles to himself.  Before you can reply,
 the sound of breaking glass followed by a scream pierces the tavern
 noise from below.

 Venkath looks at your traveling clothes.

 You can see Sceldrus Jandol here.

 Venkath Mock comes down from above.

 Warpeye (the cat) comes down from above.

 Upon entering the tavern common room, you are surprised to see the
 place devoid of any patrons.  Everything is still as if the small
 crowd departed as one, barely a few minutes ago.  The candles are
 still lit and the hanging smoke still lingers.  Paevana the alewife is
 gone as well, but casually walking among the unattended candles and
 abandoned cocktails is a tall man.  He has a handsome face but one you
 feel you can't trust.  He wears black brigandine armor and you spy two
 swords crossed on his back.  He wears no helm or hood but rather ties
 his long black hair behind his head.  He gives a smile as he sees
 Venkath Mock.  His eyes never notice you.

 Your minder, Venkath Mock, is here with a grim countenance.

 You can also see Sceldrus Jandol here.

 "Venkath." The tall man says in way of greeting.

 "Sceldrus." Venkath returns, his face steady and grim.

 Warpeye (the cat) comes up from below.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Still without giving you a glance, Sceldrus asks Venkath, "Is this the
 decipherist from Euyesus?"

 In answer, Venkath draws his blade.

 "Nothing stops a Phansigar from his task, Venkath." The tall man
 states, still smiling, but drawing one of his blades from behind his
 back.

 Venkath fidgets with his travel pack.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Like a juggernaut, Venkath swings his blade wide while quickly
 stepping up to his opponent.  Sceldrus parries, both blades clashing,
 grinding together with a sound that makes your skin crawl, like a fork
 scraping a plate at a banquet.  Seeing the opportunity, with his free
 fist, Sceldrus socks Venkath in the eye.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Stepping back, blinking his newly clobbered eye, Venkath whirls his
 blade in his hand before advancing again.  In the last second, Venkath
 quickly lifts the blade over his head, bringing it down hard upon
 Sceldrus.

 Sceldrus, however, is even quicker.  He steps aside, dodging the blow,
 but then grabs Venkath by the back of his jack-of-plate cloth shirt
 and, using Venkath's momentum against him, shoves him face-first into
 one the candle and cocktail covered tables.  He and the table go
 crashing against a wall, sending the drinks, and more dangerously, the
 lit candles clattering all over.

 Suddenly, the alcohol-soaked floor and walls are lit by the stray
 flames of the fallen candles.  A fire quickly envelopes the entry by
 the tavern's front door.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Venkath picks himself up from the smashed table and broken glasses.
 He's up just in time to parry a stabbing attempt by Sceldrus, their
 blades clanging loudly.

 "Oh, Venkath," Sceldrus says mockingly, "one should never give a sword
 to a man who can't dance."

 "What does <span class="floydstyle em">that</span> even mean?" Venkath asks gruffly, but then
 realizes he's been distracted and raises his sword in defense only a
 second before Sceldrus's own blade reached him.  Their blades clash
 once again.

>throw dirt at sceldrus

 You can't see any such thing.

>kill sceldrus with dagger

 You charge at the tall warrior, antecessor skean in hand, but he is
 too quick and powerful, compared to a small adolescent such as
 yourself.  You are grabbed by the neck with his free hand and, still
 ignoring you with his eyes, throws you onto the curved bar.  Drinks
 and candles fly in all directions as you slide over the bar and onto
 the floor and then quickly tumbling down the concealed staircase to

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tavern Common Room</span>
 Bright and shadowy, all at once, this tavern common room is covered in
 countless burning candles of various shapes, sizes, and colors.  This
 perpetual candlelight has been happening for so long, the floor is
 covered in dry candle wax, stamped into a dust that has become one
 with the floor.  The wooden walls and ceiling are completely covered
 in soot and the patrons through the many decades have taken it upon
 themselves to scrawl graffiti in it with their fingers and knives.

 Across from the front door to the east is a large, curved bar, covered
 in candles and spirits.  In between the front door and the bar are a
 couple of tables and a few scattered chairs.  A wooden staircase leads
 up and a concealed staircase behind the bar leads down to a cellar.

 A raging fire is blocking any exit through the tavern's front door.
 It is making the tavern a boiler and the countless candles are melting
 rapidly as the fire spreads.

 Your minder, Venkath Mock, is here with a grim countenance.

 You can also see Sceldrus Jandol here.

 Sceldrus and Venkath continue their swordfight in the common room as

 Venkath adjusts his scabbard and belt.

>examine bar

 (the curved bar)
 This solid wood bar curves so the server is slightly surrounded.  Its
 top is covered with burning candles, decades of candle wax, and a few
 drinks belonging to some nearby patrons.

 Sceldrus and Venkath continue their swordfight in the common room as
 the tavern burns.

 Venkath fidgets with his travel pack.

>examine drinks

 In the spaces on the bar and tables where there isn't any wax,
 spirituous drinks belonging to the various patrons are placed.  They
 are in thick glasses that appear to have been made by the same
 glassblower, given the style.

 Sceldrus and Venkath continue their swordfight in the common room as

 Venkath looks around with a peeved expression.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pipe-Filled Lavatory</span>
 This strange room is some sort of lavatory, but not like any that
 you've seen back in Euyesus.  There's a commode made of polished wood
 with a small handle nearby. There's also a porcelain sink, but the
 commode has numerous pipes extending from it and clinging to the wall
 before disappearing into it and the sink includes a faucet which is a
 brass spigot also attached to a network of pipes.  Finally, there is
 an old mirror on another wall, affixed between more pipes.  The only
 exit is the door to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tavern Cellar</span>
 This space is crowded with decades upon decades of tavern flotsam;
 broken chairs, upended tables, crates of empty bottles, among many
 other dusty things.  The only exit is a staircase that leads up to the
 tavern common room, behind the curved bar.

 Paevana the alewife is hiding down here, avoiding the melee upstairs.

 You can hear the crashing and clanging of a sword fight coming from
 the tavern common room.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tavern Common Room</span>
 Bright and shadowy, all at once, this tavern common room is covered in
 countless burning candles of various shapes, sizes, and colors.  This
 perpetual candlelight has been happening for so long, the floor is
 covered in dry candle wax, stamped into a dust that has become one
 with the floor.  The wooden walls and ceiling are completely covered
 in soot and the patrons through the many decades have taken it upon
 themselves to scrawl graffiti in it with their fingers and knives.

 Across from the front door to the east is a large, curved bar, covered
 in candles and spirits.  In between the front door and the bar are a
 couple of tables and a few scattered chairs.  A wooden staircase leads
 up and a concealed staircase behind the bar leads down to a cellar.

 A raging fire is blocking any exit through the tavern's front door.
 It is making the tavern a boiler and the countless candles are melting
 rapidly as the fire spreads.

 Your minder, Venkath Mock, is here with a grim countenance.

 You can also see Sceldrus Jandol here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upstairs Hall</span>
 This is the upstairs hall of The Vulgar Unicorn.  From below, the
 sounds of the tavern common room rises up the wooden staircase.
 Bedroom doors are set east and west and a lavatory door is to the
 south.  The soot graffiti continues on this floor, as does the smoky
 aroma of tobacco.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pipe-Filled Lavatory</span>
 This strange room is some sort of lavatory, but not like any that
 you've seen back in Euyesus.  There's a commode made of polished wood
 with a small handle nearby. There's also a porcelain sink, but the
 commode has numerous pipes extending from it and clinging to the wall
 before disappearing into it and the sink includes a faucet which is a
 brass spigot also attached to a network of pipes.  Finally, there is
 an old mirror on another wall, affixed between more pipes.  The only
 exit is the door to the north.

 Which do you mean, the pooling water or the stream of cold water?

>cold

 That doesn't go in there.

 Strategically taking aim, you hurl the bottle at the raging fire.
 With a smash, it breaks apart, spilling the water within on enough of
 the fire to allow you safe passage through the front door to the east.

 Paevana the alewife comes up from below.

 Venkath fidgets with his travel pack.

>go east

 You quickly run through the temporary space you made in the raging
 fire, and fall outside to the inn's courtyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inn Courtyard</span>
 Nestled within the buildings of Badushizd, this stony courtyard serves
 the patrons of The Vulgar Unicorn as a place to enjoy if the tavern
 gets too noisy.  A dry fountain sits as a centerpiece, surrounded by
 four stone benches with areas of trimmed grass in between.  A closed
 spiked gate leads out of this courtyard to the east and a shadowy
 break in the wall to the northwest leads to some sort of dark alley
 between the buildings.  The door into the tavern is to the west.  It
 is currently open, allowing light and conversational sounds to spill
 out into the courtyard.

 On the dry fountain is a periwinkle sadiki bird.

 You can hear the crashing and clanging of a sword fight coming from
 the tavern common room.

 Warpeye (the cat) arrives from the west.

 Paevana the alewife arrives from the west.

 The doorway to the tavern is now engulfed in flames.  The surrounding
 doorframe collapses in on itself, making any escape through there a
 fiery trap.  You can see in the windows that the fire is spreading
 fast within.

 You're staring at the blazing building, wondering about Venkath Mock,
 Warpeye the cat at your feet, when Paevana appears next to you.
 Staring as well at her livelihood literally going up in smoke, she
 puts her arm around your shoulders.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press space)</span>
 Obak.  It is an ancient land far to the north, once a prosperous
 kingdom, now a frozen wasteland of broken towers, empty and decaying
 cities, and ships half-sunken in the ice, as if the bitter cold hit
 the land all at once, taking the kingdom by surprise.  Believed to be
 a cursed region, and given its remoteness, the land is rarely visited
 by the wise.

 Deviah was to tell you what is going on and why exactly you are needed
 in Obak.  Xethes, the head of the small caravan that you and Paevana
 joined, has only said that something was found and someone who can
 read Ixteesh is needed.  He's also mentioned that more than one
 city-state has sent envoys to investigate the matter as well.

 Despite not knowing Venkath Mock's fate, and fearing the worst, you
 are comforted by Paevana joining you, having explained that with the
 razing of the Vulgar Unicorn, she has nothing left to her name.

 After a few days of solid travel on pony, your group finally reaches
 a. . .

 <span class="floydstyle em">(press space)</span>

 <span class="floydstyle i">Sloping Path</span> (on Rags)
 The long trail you've been following, if one could even call it a
 trail, slopes upward from here to the north.  Badushizd is now days to
 the south, where the snow and ice are not eternal and the sun actually
 peers through the clouds.  Obak, however, you've come to find is a
 gray and frozen wasteland.  Around the faint path up the slope are a
 good many spruce trees, frosted with snow.

 You can see Storm (on whom is Paevana the alewife), Keeta (on whom is
 Xethes Balaam) and Nibbley (on whom is Zaucular) here.
