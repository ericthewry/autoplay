 As in a dream, you see yourself tumbling down a great, dark staircase.
 All about you are shadowy images of struggles against fierce opponents
 and diabolical traps. These give way to another round of images: of
 imposing stone figures, a cool, clear lake, and, now, of an old, yet
 oddly youthful man. He turns toward you slowly, his long, silver hair
 dancing about him in a fresh breeze. "You have reached the final test,
 my friend! You are proved clever and powerful, but this is not yet
 enough! Seek me when you feel yourself worthy!" The dream dissolves
 around you as his last words echo through the void....

 Endless Stair
 You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way
 upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you,
 casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding
 trail.
 Your old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.

 trail.

>go down

 You can't go that way.

>go south

 It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

 Junction
 You are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west
 passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The
 ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail
 leads to the west.
 Standing before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish
 sword.

>turn on lamp

 It is already on.

>examine rock

 The great rock contains:
   A sword

>go west

 Barren Area
 You are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out
 into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see
 vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone,
 ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough
 to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips
 sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.

>examine wall

 I see nothing special about the stone wall.

>go southwest

 Land of Shadow
 You are in a shadowy land of low, rolling hills stretching out to the
 west and south. The land is bordered to the north by a massive stone
 wall. Ancient and weathered, the wall has crumbled enough at one point
 to permit passage.
 Through the shadows, a cloaked and hooded figure appears before you,
 blocking the southeastern exit from the room and carrying a brightly
 glowing sword.
 From nowhere, the sword from the junction appears in your hand, wildly
 glowing!

>hit figure with sword

 A quick stroke catches the hooded figure off guard! Blood trickles
 down the figure's arm!
 The figure has a light wound which hasn't affected its seemingly great
 strength.
 You are wounded by a lightning thrust!

>diagnose

 You are wounded lightly. You have a good deal of strength in reserve.
 The hooded figure catches you off guard and wounds you!

>hit figure with sword

 You are wounded by a lightning thrust!

>again

 A good slash, but it misses by a mile.
 You are wounded by a lightning thrust!

>again

 The hooded figure swings its sword and sends yours flying to the
 ground. Although you are defenseless, the figure reaches for your
 sword and hands it back to you, nodding grimly.

 You slowly remove the hood from your badly wounded opponent and recoil
 in horror at the sight of your own face, weary and wounded. A faint
 smile comes to the lips and then the face starts to change, very
 slowly, into that of an old, wizened person. The image fades and with
 it the body of your hooded opponent. The cloak remains on the ground.

 "I have waited three ages for someone to say those words and save me
 from sailing this endless ocean. Please accept this gift. You may find
 it useful!" He throws something which falls near you in the sand, then
 sails off toward the west, singing a lively, but somewhat uncouth,
 sailor song.

 You are in a small chamber carved in the rock, with the sole exit to
 the north. Mounted on one wall is a table labelled "Scenic Vista,"
 whose featureless surface is angled toward you. One might believe that
 the table was used to indicate points of interest in the view from
 this spot, like those found in many parks. On the other hand, your
 surroundings are far from spacious and by no stretch of the
 imagination could this spot be considered scenic. An indicator above
 the table reads "II".
 Mounted on one wall is a flaming torch, which fills the room with a
 flickering light.

 to be blocked by rubble.

 Sacrificial Altar
 This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few
 flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which is
 still drenched with the blood of human sacrifice. Behind the altar is
 an enormous statue of a demon which seems to reach towards you with
 dripping fangs and razor-sharp talons. A low noise begins behind you,
 and you turn to see hundreds of hunched and hairy shapes. A guttural
 chant issues from their throats. Near you stands a figure draped in a
 robe of deepest black, brandishing a huge sword. The chant grows
 louder as the robed figure approaches the altar. The large figure
 spots you and approaches menacingly. He reaches into his cloak and
 pulls out a great, glowing dagger. He pulls you onto the altar, and
 with a murmur of approval from the throng, he slices you neatly across
 your abdomen.

    ****  You have died  ****

 You find yourself deep within the earth in a barren prison cell.
 Outside the iron-barred window, you can see a great, fiery pit. Flames
 leap up and very nearly sear your flesh. After a while, footfalls can
 be heard in the distance, then closer and closer.... The door swings
 open, and in walks an old man.

 He is dressed simply in a hood and cloak, wearing a few simple jewels,
 carrying something under one arm, and leaning on a wooden staff. A
 single key, as if to a massive prison cell, hangs from his belt.

 He raises the staff toward you and you hear him speak, as if in a
 dream: "I await you, though your journey be long and full of peril. Go
 then, and let me not wait long!" You feel some great power well up
 inside you and you fall to the floor. The next moment, you are
 awakening, as if from a deep slumber.

 Endless Stair
 You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way
 upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you,
 casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding
 trail.
 There is a lamp here.

 Cliff
 This is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet

 bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the
 sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making
 this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the
 west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks
 below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling
 from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest,
 through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless
 and barren.
 A rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the

 At the edge of the cliff above you, a man appears. He looks down at

 I can help you." He chuckles in an unsettling sort of way. "Perhaps if
 you tied that chest to the end of the rope I might be able to drag it
 up for you.  Then, I'll be more than happy to help you up!"  He laughs
 again.

>tie rope to chest

 The chest is now tied to the rope.
 The man above you looks pleased. "Now there's a good friend! Thank you

 You grab securely on to the rope.
 The man starts to heave on the rope and within a few moments you
 arrive at the top of the cliff. The man removes the last few valuables
 from the chest and prepares to leave. "You've been a good sport! Here,
 take this, for whatever good it is! I can't see that I'll be needing
 one!" He hands you a plain wooden staff from the bottom of the chest
 and begins examining his valuables.

 be heard in the distance, then closer and closer.... The door swings
 open, and in walks an old man.

 He is dressed simply in a hood and cloak, wearing a few simple jewels,
 carrying something under one arm, and leaning on a wooden staff. A
 single key, as if to a massive prison cell, hangs from his belt.

 He raises the staff toward you and you hear him speak, as if in a
 dream: "I await you, though your journey be long and full of peril. Go

 awakening, as if from a deep slumber.

 You are below the surface of the lake. It turns out that the lake is
 quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you. Considering
 the frigid temperature of the water, you should probably not plan an
 extended stay.  The lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and
 algae live there.
 There is a Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent here.
 Out of the corner of your eye, a small, shiny object appears in the
 sand. A moment later, it is gone!

>take can

 Taken.
 You catch a brief glimpse of something shiny in the sand.

>go up

 On the Lake
 The icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out
 much longer.

>go south

 Southern Shore
 You are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent
 movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going
 all but impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock
 formation, you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into
 the rock.

>apply can to me

 The spray smells like a mixture of old socks and burning rubber. If I
 were a grue I'd sure stay clear!

 It is pitch black.
 The ground continues to slope upwards away from the lake. You can
 barely  detect a dim light from the east.

>go east

 Key Room
 You are between some rock and a dark place, The room is lit dimly from
 above, revealing a lone, dark path sloping down to the west.
 To one side of the room is a large manhole cover.
 The light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room,
 where a single key is lying in the dust.

>take key

 Taken.
 That horrible smell is much less pungent now.

>move cover

 The cover is moved a bit to one side, revealing a small hole leading
 into darkness.

>go down

 Aqueduct
 You are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system for
 the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to
 the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the
 aqueduct to the north. This region is lit from above, although the
 source of light is not apparent.

>go north

 High Arch
 You are now on one of the tallest arches of the aqueduct, hundreds of
 feet above a rocky chasm. The immensity of the aqueduct project is
 apparent from here. Stone supports rise from the rock floor to form
 massive arches, which traverse the region from north to south. The
 water-carrying channel here is wide and deep. To the west and far
 below, you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of
 the aqueduct.

>go north

 Water Slide
 You are near the northern end of this segment of the aqueduct system.
 To the south and slightly uphill, the bulk of the aqueduct looms
 ominously, towering above a gorge. To the north, the water channel
 drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole. The damp moss and lichen
 would certainly make that a one-way trip.

>go north

 Damp Passage
 There is a torch here.

>examine torch

 I see nothing special about the torch.

>take torch

 Taken.

>look

 Damp Passage
 This is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can
 see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead
 east and northeast. A stone channel, wide and deep, steeply descends
 into the room from the south. It is covered with moss and lichen, and
 is far too slippery to climb. The channel crosses the room, but the
 opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.

 Junction
 You are at the junction of a north-south passage and an east-west
 passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The
 ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail
 leads to the west.
 Standing before you is a great rock.

>go west

 Barren Area
 You are west of the junction, where the rock-bound passage widens out
 into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see
 vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone,
 ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough
 to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips
 sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.

>go west

 Cliff
 This is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet
 above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface through which pours
 bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the
 sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making
 this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the
 west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks
 below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling
 from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest,
 through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless
 and barren.
 A rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the
 side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below.
 It seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh
 bread lying beneath one of the other trees.

>climb rope

 Cliff Ledge
 This is a rock-strewn ledge near the base of a tall cliff. The bottom
 of the cliff is another fifteen feet below. You have little hope of
 climbing up the cliff face, but you might be able to scramble down
 from here (though it's doubtful you could return).
 A long piece of rope is dangling down from the top of the cliff and is
 within your reach.
 A large chest, closed and locked, is lying among the boulders.

>unlock chest

 What do you want to unlock the chest with?

>key

 The key, which initially seemed certain to fit the lock, seems to
 change shape and will not enter the keyhole.

>wait

 Time passes...
 At the edge of the cliff above you, a man appears. He looks down at
 you and speaks. "Hello, down there! You seem to have a problem. Maybe
 I can help you." He chuckles in an unsettling sort of way. "Perhaps if
 you tied that chest to the end of the rope I might be able to drag it
 up for you.  Then, I'll be more than happy to help you up!"  He laughs
 again.

>tie chest to rope

 The chest is now tied to the rope.
 The man above you looks pleased. "Now there's a good friend! Thank you
 very much, indeed!" He pulls on the rope and the chest is lifted to
 the top of the cliff and out of sight. With a short laugh, he
 disappears. "I'll be back in a short while!" are his last words.
 There is a great tremor from within the earth. The entire dungeon
 shakes violently and loose debris starts to fall from above you.

>wait

 Time passes...

>wait

 Time passes...

>wait

 Time passes...
 A familiar voice calls down to you. "Are you still there?" he bellows
 with a coarse laugh. "Well, then, grab onto the rope and we'll see
 what we can do." The rope drops to within your reach.

>grab rope

 You grab securely on to the rope.
 The man starts to heave on the rope and within a few moments you
 arrive at the top of the cliff. The man removes the last few valuables
 from the chest and prepares to leave. "You've been a good sport! Here,
 take this, for whatever good it is! I can't see that I'll be needing
 one!" He hands you a plain wooden staff from the bottom of the chest
 and begins examining his valuables.
 The chest, open and empty, is at your feet.

 northeast is a steeply climbing path and the ground becomes sandy
 toward the south.

 You can't go that way.

>go south

 Flathead Ocean
 You are at the shore of an amazing underground sea, the topic of many
 a legend among adventurers. Few were known to have arrived at this
 spot, and fewer to return. There is a heavy surf and a breeze is
 blowing on-shore. The land rises steeply to the east and quicksand
 prevents movement to the south. A thick mist covers the ocean and
 extends over the hills to the east.  A path heads north along the
 beach.

 Passing alongside the shore now is an old boat, reminiscent of an
 ancient Viking ship. Standing on the prow of the ship is an old and
 crusty sailor, peering out over the misty ocean.

>say "hello sailor"


 The seaman looks up and maneuvers the boat toward shore. He cries out
 "I have waited three ages for someone to say those words and save me
 from sailing this endless ocean. Please accept this gift. You may find
 it useful!" He throws something which falls near you in the sand, then
 sails off toward the west, singing a lively, but somewhat uncouth,
 sailor song.
 The boat sails silently through the mist and out of sight.

 As in a dream, you see yourself tumbling down a great, dark staircase.
 All about you are shadowy images of struggles against fierce opponents
 and diabolical traps. These give way to another round of images: of
 imposing stone figures, a cool, clear lake, and, now, of an old, yet
 oddly youthful man. He turns toward you slowly, his long, silver hair
 dancing about him in a fresh breeze. "You have reached the final test,
 my friend! You are proved clever and powerful, but this is not yet
 enough! Seek me when you feel yourself worthy!" The dream dissolves
 around you as his last words echo through the void....

 As in a dream, you see yourself tumbling down a great, dark staircase.
 All about you are shadowy images of struggles against fierce opponents
 and diabolical traps. These give way to another round of images: of
 imposing stone figures, a cool, clear lake, and, now, of an old, yet
 oddly youthful man. He turns toward you slowly, his long, silver hair
 dancing about him in a fresh breeze. "You have reached the final test,
 my friend! You are proved clever and powerful, but this is not yet
 enough! Seek me when you feel yourself worthy!" The dream dissolves
 around you as his last words echo through the void....

 casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding

 Museum Entrance
 This appears to be an unfinished entranceway to the Royal Museum.
 There are doors to the east and north, and a blind stairway to the
 south. A heavy iron door to the west is closed and locked.

 Jewel Room
 You are in a high-ceilinged chamber, in the center of which is a
 pedestal which is the intended home of the Crown Jewels of the Great
 Underground Empire: a jewelled knife, a golden ring, and the royal
 sceptre. Not all of the jewels are in place, however. The room is, by
 appearances, unfinished.

 You start to feel light-headed and, before you can even think, you
 become completely disoriented. When you regain your faculties, you
 realize that your surroundings have changed.
 You notice that everything you were holding is gone!

 Jewel Room
 You are in a high-ceilinged chamber in the middle of which sits a
 tall, round steel cage, which is securely locked. In the middle of the
 cage is a pedestal on which sit the Crown Jewels of the Great
 Underground Empire: a sceptre, a jewelled knife, and a golden ring. A
 small bronze plaque, now tarnished, is on the cage.

 Museum Entrance
 This is the entrance to the Royal Museum, the finest and grandest in
 the Great Underground Empire. To the south, down a few steps, is the
 entrance to the Royal Puzzle and to the east, through a stone door, is
 the Royal Jewel Collection. A wooden door to the north is closed and
 leads to the Museum of Technology. To the west is a great iron door,
 rusted shut. To its left, however, is a cleft in the rock providing a
 western route away from the museum.

 Technology Museum
 This is a large hall which hosted the technological exhibits of the
 Great Underground Empire. A door to the south is open.
 A strange grey machine, shaped somewhat like a clothes dryer, is on
 one side of the room. On the other side of the hall is a
 powerful-looking black machine, a tight tangle of wires, pipes, and
 motors.
 A plaque is mounted near the door. The writing is faded, however, and
 cannot be made out clearly. The two machines seem to be in bad shape,
 rusting in many spots.
 There is a Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent here.
 There is a strange key here.

 Jewel Room
 (You are in the gold machine.)
 You are in a high-ceilinged chamber in the middle of which sits a
 tall, round steel cage, which is securely locked. In the middle of the
 cage is a pedestal on which sit the Crown Jewels of the Great
 Underground Empire: a sceptre, a jewelled knife, and a golden ring. A

 You are in a large, unfinished room, probably intended to be a part of
 the Royal Museum.
 A strange grey machine, shaped somewhat like a clothes dryer, is on
 one side of the room. On the other side of the hall is a
 powerful-looking black machine, a tight tangle of wires, pipes, and
 motors.
 A plaque is mounted near the door. The grey machine, it turns out, is
 a Frobozz Magic Pressurizer, used in the coal mines of the Empire. The
 black machine is a Frobozz Magic Room Spinner. The golden machine is
 referred to as a Temporizer. All are non-working models donated by
 Frobozzco president John D. Flathead.
 Directly in front of you is a large golden machine, which has a seat
 with a console in front. On the console is a single button and a dial
 connected to a three-digit display which reads 776. The machine is
 suprisingly shiny and shows few signs of age.

 This is a small square room, in the middle of which is a perfectly

 you could climb back up. Exits are west and, up a few steps, north.

 Warning:
 The Royal Puzzle is quite dangerous and it is possible to become
 trapped within its confines. Please do not enter the puzzle after

 The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone and
 marble. The following notations will be used:

 This is a small square room, in the middle of which is a perfectly
 round hole through which you can discern the floor some ten feet
 below. The place under the hole is dark, but it appears to be

 you could climb back up. Exits are west and, up a few steps, north.

 The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
 descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3 grid.
 The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone and
 marble. The following notations will be used:

   .. = your position (middle of grid)
   MM  = marble wall
   SS  = sandstone wall
   ??  = unknown (blocked by walls)

 The book is written in a strong and elegant hand and is full of
 strange and wondrous pictures. The text is in a tongue unknown to you
 and is penned in many colours. Some of the words seem to change colour
 as you read them.  The book itself is very old and the pages dry and
 brittle.
