 You are in a strange location, but you cannot remember how you got
 here. Everything is hazy, as though viewed through a gauze...

 Twisted Forest
 You are on a path through a blighted forest. The trees are sickly, and
 there is no undergrowth at all. One tree here looks climbable. The
 path, which ends here, continues to the northeast.

 A hellhound is racing straight toward you, its open jaws displaying
 rows of razor-sharp teeth.

>go up

 Tree Branch
 You are on a large gnarled branch of an old and twisted tree.

 A giant boa constrictor is slithering along the branch toward you!
 The hellhound leaps madly about the base of the tree, gnashing its
 jaws.

>feed boa constrictor to hellhound

 You're not holding the boa constrictor!

>inventory

 You are empty-handed.

 The snake begins wrapping itself around your torso, squeezing the life
 out of you...

 ...and a moment later you wake up in a cold sweat and realize you've
 been dreaming.

 Your frotz spell seems to have worn off during the night, and it is
 now pitch black.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a spell book

>read book

 Though it is dark, the magic writing of your spells casts enough light
 that you can read them.

 My Spell Book

 The gnusto spell (write a magic spell into a spell book).
 The vezza spell (view the future).
 The pulver spell (cause liquids to become dry).
 The izyuk spell (fly like a bird).
 The yomin spell (mind probe).
 The rezrov spell (open even locked or enchanted objects).
 The frotz spell (cause something to give off light).

>izyuk me

 You don't have the izyuk spell committed to memory!

>learn izyuk

 You can't learn it in the dark.

>spells

 The gnusto, rezrov, and frotz spells are yours forever. Other than
 that, you have no spells memorized.

>frotz book

 There is an almost blinding flash of light as the spell book begins to
 glow! It slowly fades to a less painful level, but the spell book is
 now quite usable as a light source.

 Your Quarters, in the bed
 This is your chamber in the Hall of the Guild of Enchanters, with a
 doorway to the west. A private chamber is a great privilege,
 especially for an Enchanter as young as yourself, but how many
 Enchanters can say they defeated the infamous Krill?

>learn izyuk

 Using your best study habits, you learn the izyuk spell.

>izyuk me

 You are now floating serenely in midair.

>fly west

 I can't use the word "west" here.

>go west

 Hallway (you are flying)
 Rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south corridor. A heavy
 wooden door, currently closed, leads north.
 Tacked to the doorframe of your room is a note, hurriedly scribbled on
 parchment.

>examine note

 I don't know the word "x".

>examine note

 "I have taken the apprentices into town to shop for the Guild picnic.
 I tried rousing you, but you seemed deep asleep. By the way, have you
 seen Belboz anywhere? It's not like him to leave without telling
 someone -- but then, he's been acting pretty odd of late.

                             -- Frobar"

 You settle gently to the ground.

>go north

 The heavy wooden door is closed.

>open door

 Okay, the heavy wooden door is now open.

>go north

 Chamber of the Circle
 The meeting place of the Circle of Enchanters is a large, round room
 with a high domed ceiling. A table occupies the center of the room.
 Engraved on the wall is a list of tenets, the Guild's code of honor.
 The only door, at the southernmost point of the perimeter, is open.

>read tenets

 The first tenet states that Enchanters may never use their talents to
 aid evil. The second points out that an Enchanter's duty is to the
 Guild and to the Kingdom, not to the individual. Lesser tenets include
 rules for conducting votes at meetings, guidelines for passing dishes
 at Guild banquets, and penalties for revealing the Guild's secret
 handshake.

>examine table

 You see nothing special about the table.

>read code

 I don't know the word "code".

 Belboz's Quarters
 The personal chamber of Belboz, who presides over the Circle of
 Enchanters, is appointed with a beautiful woven wall hanging, an
 exotic morgia plant, and a wide darkwood desk crafted by the artisans
 of Gurth. The hallway lies to the east.
 Pacing back and forth on a perch in the corner is Belboz's prized pet
 parrot, native to the jungles of Miznia.

 "Squawk! Now where can I hide this key? Squawk!"

>examine desk

 The desk has one drawer which is closed.

 You are now a bit thirsty.

 "Squawk! Now where can I hide this key? Squawk!"

>open drawer

 Opening the desk drawer reveals a tiny box, an infotater, and a
 journal.

 "Squawk! This tea is cold! Get me another cup. Squawk!"

>examine box

 There is writing on the lid of the box.

 "    MAGIC AMULET

 The closer this amulet is to
 its owner, the brighter it may
 glow. Ideal for leaving with
 your loved ones if you go on
 a long and hazardous journey.

 This amulet is sensitized to

 Another fine product of the
 Frobozz Magic Amulet Company."

 "Squawk! This tea is cold! Get me another cup. Squawk!"

>open it

 Opening the tiny box reveals a magic amulet.

 You are now a bit hungry.

>get amulet

 "Squawk! This tea is cold! Get me another cup. Squawk!"

>examine infotater

 I don't know the word "x".

>look at infotater

 Like most infotaters, this one has several windows and a rotating data
 wheel. It is leather-bound and beautifully illustrated. (NOTE: This is
 the infotater included in your game package.)

>look at journal

 It's closed and sealed with a lock.

>rezrov journal

 The journal seems to bear a spell protecting it against the simple
 rezrov spell.

 The Guild Hall doorbell chimes.

>examine plant

>look at plant

 You see nothing special about the morgia plant.

 You are now somewhat thirsty.

 "Squawk! You should never have let down your mindshield, you doddering
 old Enchanter. Squawk!"

>look at wall hanging

 It is a beautiful piece of local handiwork, given to Belboz by the
 grateful townspeople after his (admittedly showy) pyrotechnical
 destruction of the evil giant Amathradonis. The hanging is affixed to
 the wall at its upper corners.

>look behind wall hanging

 As you move the tapestry, a key falls out from behind it and lands on
 the floor.

 "Squawk! You should never have let down your mindshield, you doddering
 old Enchanter. Squawk!"

>take key

 Taken.

>look at key

 You see nothing special about the small key.

>unlock journal

 No spell would help with that!

 You are now somewhat hungry.

>unlock journal with small key

>open journal with key

 You must tell me how to do that to a journal.

 "Squawk! Now where can I hide this key? Squawk!"

>read journal

 (taking the journal first)
 It's closed and sealed with a lock.

 "Squawk! Belboz, the Circle is waiting for you. Squawk!"

>look at lock

>unseal journal

 I don't know the word "unseal".

>unlock lock with key

 I can't use the word "lock" here.

>put key in journal

 You can't do that.

 You are now quite thirsty.

>open journal

 (with the key)
 The journal springs open.

 "Squawk! Where did I leave my spectacles? Squawk!"


 The journal is already open!

 "Squawk! This tea is cold! Get me another cup. Squawk!"

>read journal

 You skim through the pages of the journal, a combination diary and
 notebook. Most of the notations, written in Belboz's familiar flowing
 script, deal with meetings of the Circle and business of the Guild.

 There is one interesting entry toward the end of the book. Belboz
 refers to an ancient and evil force known simply as Jeearr, a demon
 whose powers could endanger the Circle and possibly the entire
 kingdom. He has decided to conduct some dangerous exploratory
 experiments, operating alone to shield the Circle from the perils
 involved.

 The last three entries are strange and frightening -- written in a
 hand quite different from that of Belboz, and in a language totally
 unfamiliar to you.

 On the inside cover is an inscription, written in a light script,
 which reads "Current code: dorn".

 This is the entrance lobby of the Guild Hall. Befitting the status and

 marble, inlaid with intricate patterns of silver leaf. To the north is
 a wide arch, and smaller openings flank the area on the eastern and
 western sides, as well as the northeastern and northwestern corners. A
 narrow stair leads downward. Through another arch to the south, you
 can see the entrance steps and the main road into town.
 Affixed to the southern arch is an ornate brass receptacle, intended
 for use by messengers.

>look in receptacle

 Opening the receptacle reveals an issue of Popular Enchanting.

 You are now quite hungry.

>get popular enchanting

 Taken.

>read popular enchanting

 This month's cover story is about Belboz! Other stories relate the
 explosion of spell scroll manufacturers, and the coming shakedown in
 the magic potion industry. The address label on the cover reads:

     "Z5 ACCAR256 4-964

 There is a calendar here (providing light).
 There is a depleted matchbook here.

>drink vial

 You can't drink that!

>drink potion

 You can't see any potion here!

>open vial

 Opening the ochre vial reveals ochre potion.

>drink potion

 The potion was completely tasteless. You no longer feel hungry and
 thirsty, though.

>look at calendar

 The calendar is for the current year, 957 GUE, and bears many stunning
 pictures: the marble mines of Antharia, the sand dunes of the Kovalli
 Desert, ancient Fort Griffspotter, and the giant infotater factories
 of Borphee. A legend reads "Best wishes for a leak-less year, from the
 Accardi Plumbers Guild."

>look at matchbook

 This is the entrance lobby of the Guild Hall. Befitting the status and

 Apprentice Quarters
 This is a large hall where the Guild's young apprentices live and
 study as they strive to achieve a seat on the Circle. You think back
 to the days when you occupied these quarters. The apprentices are
 gone, having accompanied Frobar into town to shop. You can leave to

 Library
 This is a study chamber for members of the Guild. Usually, there would
 be several elder Enchanters patiently training novices, but no one is
 here at the moment. The only exit is west.
 Lying open on a stand in one corner is a heavy volume, probably a copy
 of the Encyclopedia Frobizzica.
 The servants have been lax lately, for a scroll is lying among the
 dust in the corner.

>read encyclopedia

 It would take days to read the entire encyclopedia. A better idea
 would be to read about specific persons or things.

>look up dorn in encyclopedia

 The spot where the entry should be is blank, as though the text were
 magically excised or transported to some other location.

 itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! However,
 the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is
 copied.

 Cellar
 You are in the basement of the Guild Hall. A steep, narrow stair leads
 upward from the southwest corner.
 At the far end of the cellar, draped in cobwebs, is a large trunk. At
 each corner of its lid is a button: a black button with a picture of a
 star, a gray button depicting the moon, a red button illustrated with
 a bloody knife, and a purple button engraved with a royal crown. In
 the center of the lid is a white button picturing a dove in flight.

 The scroll reads "aimfiz spell: transport caster to someone else's

>gnusto aimfiz

 Your spell book begins to glow softly. In a spectacular effort of
 magic, the powers of the gnusto spell attempt to copy the aimfiz spell
 into your book, but the spell is too long, too complicated, and too
 powerful. The glow fades, but fortunately the moldy scroll remains
 intact.

 "There's no one else here," it reminds you, "so you'd better not leave

 After a momentary dizziness, you realize that your location has

 You are on a path through a blighted forest. The trees are sickly, and
 there is no undergrowth at all. One tree here looks climbable. The

    ****  You have died  ****

 Your guardian angel, draped in white, appears floating in the
 nothingness before you. "Gotten in a bit of a scrape, eh?" he asks,
 writing frantically in a notebook. "I'd love to chat, but we're so
 busy this month." A look of consternation crosses the angel's face.
 "According to the records, you're to be resurrected in your local
 Guild Hall. But that's quite far, and I've had a rough day. How about
 Egreth Castle instead, hmmm?" Being disembodied, you find it difficult
 to object, and a moment later you are among the...

 You are amongst the ruins of an ancient castle. A winding stairway
 leads up to a crumbling turret, and a dark passage leads downward. A
 path heads through the rubble to the west.

 Turret
 This is the only turret of the castle still standing. It affords a
 marvelous view of a meadow to the west, and beyond that a twisted
 forest. To the north is a mighty fortress which stands atop a cliff
 where a turbulent river pours into an ocean. The ocean stretches out

 Arcade
 This is a huge tent filled with hectic noise, blinking lights, and the
 smell of frying food. Near the exit is a game booth lined with prizes.
 The concept of the game seems to be bashing cute little mechanical

 meadow.
 A hawker stands within the booth, studying you through half-closed

 Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of

 However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word

 You are standing on the drawbridge of a ruined castle which lies to

 You are swimming on the surface of a calm lagoon, whose sandy floor is

 This is the floor of a cove off the turbulent ocean to the east. The
 ground slopes upward to the north, west, and south. Light filters down
 from the surface of the water.
 Nestled among some coral is a clump of stunningly beautiful
 spenseweeds, waving slowly in the currents of the lagoon.

 A mighty river spills into the ocean here. Looking up the river

 Grue Lair
 This is a low, shadowy cave leading east to west. The rocky walls are
 scarred with deep claw marks.
 A pack of grues fills the room! The grues, contrary to all
 conventional wisdom, aren't bothered by your light in the least. They
 must be mutated grues, no longer fearing light! They stagger about the
 room, covering their noses and making horrid gurgling noises.

>go west

 Mammoth Cavern
 This cavern is of extraordinary size, but nevertheless crowded with
 powerful-looking machinery. You recognize a breeder for producing
 millions of the mutated grues you just passed. Other devices seem
 designed to aid the forces of evil while sapping magic powers of
 Enchanters everywhere.

 At the far end of the cavern are three closed doors: a black marble
 door leading to the northwest, a shiny silver door heading due west,
 and a door of bleached white wood to the southwest.

 (with the diamond-studded knife)
 You stab the knife time and again into Belboz, who writhes in pain,
 eyes bulging outward. Sickened and dizzy, you stagger back.

 A wispy translucent shape rises from the corpse of Belboz. It speaks
 in a voice so deep that your whole body seems to hear it. "Foolish
 Charlatan! I am forced to flee that weak, old body -- I shall take
 your own, instead! Already I have sucked all knowledge, all secrets
 from that ancient Enchanter. Now begins an epoch of evil transcending
 even your worst nightmares; a reign of terror that will last a
 thousand thousand years!" The shape blows toward you on a cold wind.

 You feel an overwhelming sense of oppression as the demon seizes
 control of your mind and body. The monster reaches into the recesses
 of your mind, adding your hard-earned magic powers to its own. As it
 settles comfortably into your skull, the demon grants you a vision of
 the future. You see the enslaved people of the land toiling to erect
 great idols to Jeearr. Parents offer up their own children upon these
 altars, as the rivers of the land fill with blood. And YOU embody
 Jeearr; you are cursed by ten thousand generations of victims; your
 face adorns the idols. And worst of all, you remain awake and aware, a
 witness to horror, never sleeping, and never, ever to escape.

 Jeearr surrounds you like a cloud and begins to contract. Suddenly, it
 strikes your invisible protection and recoils as if burned. "No!" it
 cries. "Such a guileless Enchanter developing a mind shield?" The
 cloud is thinner, the voice fainter. "It cannot be! I cannot survive
 ... without a host." The demon roils in agony, then thins and
 dissipates. There is a final scream of pain, then silence.

 Jeearr is vanquished; the kingdom is saved. But you - you are stranded
 in a land unknown, and your closest friend, the greatest Enchanter of
 his age, lies dead by your own hand. Kneeling by his blood-soaked
 corpse, you beg for another chance...

 Gun Emplacement
 This is a battlement with a view of a river to the north and an ocean
 to the east. Openings northwest, west, and southwest lead to other
 parts of the fort.
 A magnificent cast-iron cannon stands atop the battlement. Its wide,
 shallow barrel points toward the ocean, as though daring enemy ships
 to approach.

>put guano in cannon

 When you drop the guano into the barrel, dozens of scrolls pour out
 and literally run off in every direction! A single ordinary scroll is
 left sitting at the bottom of the barrel.

 This is a low, shadowy cave leading east to west. The rocky walls are

 A pack of grues fills the room! The grues, contrary to all

 This cavern is of extraordinary size, but nevertheless crowded with

 millions of the mutated grues you just passed. Other devices seem
 designed to aid the forces of evil while sapping magic powers of
 Enchanters everywhere.

 At the far end of the cavern are three closed doors: a black marble

 from that ancient Enchanter. Now begins an epoch of evil transcending
 even your worst nightmares; a reign of terror that will last a
 thousand thousand years!" The shape blows toward you on a cold wind.

 Jeearr surrounds you like a cloud and begins to contract. Suddenly, it
 strikes your invisible protection and recoils as if burned. "No!" it
 cries. "Such a guileless Enchanter developing a mind shield?" The
 cloud is thinner, the voice fainter. "It cannot be! I cannot survive
 ... without a host." The demon roils in agony, then thins and
 dissipates. There is a final scream of pain, then silence.

 Belboz moans softly, and begins stirring. He sees you and rises,
 instantly alert. After posing a few well-chosen questions, he casts a
 brief but unfamiliar spell.

 An instant later, your grue suit has vanished and you are standing in
 the Chamber of the Circle. The Circle of Enchanters is assembled.
 Belboz speaks. "Once again, this young Enchanter has done a matchless
 service to the Guild and to the entire kingdom, displaying
 resourcefulness and imagination worthy of the greatest of Enchanters.
 I grow old, and must soon step down as Head of the Circle. But let it
 be known that a successor has been found."

 Your score is 400 of a possible 400, in 656 moves. This puts you in
 the class of Leader of the Circle of Enchanters.

 Here ends the second chapter of the Enchanter saga, in which, by
 virtue of your skills, you have been appointed as the next leader of
 the Circle of Enchanters. The final adventure awaits you as the
 Enchanter series concludes.

 Opening the indigo vial reveals indigo potion.

>drink indigo potion

 The potion tastes like a combination of anchovies, prune juice, and
 garlic powder. As you finish swallowing the potion, a well-muscled
 troll saunters in. He whacks your head with a wooden two-by-four,
 grunting "You are playing Sorcerer. It was written by S. Eric
 Meretzky. You will have fun and enjoy yourself." He repeats this
 action 999 more times, then vanishes without a trace.

 Kaboom!!!...

    ****  You have died  ****

 Your guardian angel, draped in white, appears floating in the
 nothingness before you. "Gotten in a bit of a scrape, eh?" he asks,
 writing frantically in a notebook. "I'd love to chat, but we're so
 busy this month." The angel twitches his nose, and the nothingness is
 replaced by...

 Drawbridge
 With a scream of splintering wood, part of the drawbridge collapses
 and spills you into the moat. You are immediately set upon by
 alligators and piranhas.

    ****  You have died  ****

 Unfortunately, you made no provisions for your untimely death.

 Your score is 130 of a possible 400, in 199 moves. This puts you in
