 It's a fairly easy life being the Grim Reaper.  People often make the
 mistake of assuming that you appear at every death.  Of course, that's
 a mistake that they only tend to make once.  The reality is quite
 different.  Death tends to happen to people whether you are there or
 not, you actually only show up for the more unusual cases.  Every now
 or then someone will put up a fight and not take death lying down.
 That's when you show up to make sure that they play by the rules.
 Essentially, you're a high stakes baliff.

 Every day your Supervisors mail you a list of the difficult cases.
 You have twelve hours to make sure that souls are reaped and the wages
 of sin are paid.  Welcome to a day in the life of Death.

 Useful Commands

 examine hourglass
 This will tell you how long you have left before the day ends.  You
 don't want to know what happens if you don't finish reaping the
 alloted souls within the time limit.

 say X to Horse
 Where 'X' equals your destination.  You own a skeletal horse, named
 Horse (you are not known for your imagination).  Tell him/her where
 you want to go and he/she (it's difficult to sex skeletal horses) will
 take you there.  To return to your home then use the simple command
 say home to horse

 Reap Soul
 The ultimate command.  Provided that you are holding your scythe and
 can get to your client, this will send the death-shy soul to the
 afterlife.  You must utilise this command on all clients to complete
 the game.

 I owe the following people something, so I thought a 'Thank You' here
 would do.  Most of them will probably never read it anyway.  Still,
 it's the thought that counts.

 Thanks to...

 Campbell Wild for the ADRIFT generator.  Now the stories in my head
 can come to life.  And is that your real name?  It's kind of cool.

 The ADRIFT community at the official forum
 ([<A HREF="http://www.adrift.org.uk/cgi/iB/ikonboard.cgi">LINK</A>]) for making me feel
 welcome and giving (mostly) good advice.

 David Whyld, de budding and Ren for beta testing my first game, The
 Sisters.  The advice they gave and changes they suggested made it ten
 times better than it originally was (before it was only worth 0.5 out
 of 10)

 All the people who played, reviewed and voted for The Sisters during
 the 12th Annual IF Competition.  The whole experience encouraged me to
 keep writing.  So this game is mostly your fault.

 rotter for Unauthorized Termination and inspiration for text
 formatting.

 Lumin for beta testing this game and pointing out my clumsy
 punctuation skillz.

 www.strange-facts.com for giving me some...err...strange facts.

 Terry Pratchett for the Discworld books.  I could make a convincing
 case for the fact that my anthropomorphic Death is very different from
 his anthropomorphic Death, but seeing as I got the idea for this game
 when I was reading Reaper Man it's a futile exercise.

 The Living Room of Death

 You are standing in your living room.  It's quite small and cosy, with
 panel flooring and painted walls (black, of course).  A bookcase
 stands against one wall.  On another is a shelf, on which rests your
 CD player and collection of CDs.  A comfy, well-worn leather armchair
 lies right bang in the centre of the room facing the only window.  You
 often like to sit on the chair staring out into the empty, black void
 of time and space that your home backs on to.  It's not a great view,
 but it's something to look at.

>inventory

 You are carrying the Golden Hourglass.

>examine hourglass

 The grains of sand tell you that you have twelve hours left to
 complete your contract.

>examine me

 You are about six foot five inches tall, dressed in the blackest robes
 anyone has ever seen.  Your hairless, so-pale-it's-almost-translucent
 skin is stretched across your skull like clingfilm on a billiard ball.
 Your eyes are about the only thing in this reality that are darker
 than your robes, and your spindly, gaunt hands protrude from your
 sleeves like a bunch of chopsticks.  You secretly think of yourself as
 'quite handsome'.

>examine cds

 You're not sure if two CDs can rightly be called a collection, but if
 they can then this is your CD collection.  You have The Eagles:
 Greatest Hits 1971-1975 and the CD single of Candle in the Wind 1997
 by Elton John.

>examine books

 You pick up a diary at random and flick to a page.


 Friday 13th May 1988
 When I saw that it was Friday the 13th I should have known that I was
 in for a bad day.  I accidentally materialised in the middle of the
 ladies changing room at a swimming pool.  People were throwing things
 at me and screaming.  It doesn't take much to discourage me.  Perhaps
 I'm not cut out for this job after all?  Well, I'm sure something good
 will come along soon.  Chin up and all that!

 You put the book back on the shelf.  You can see no need to take any

 The Hallway of Death

 The hallway has thick, plush red carpet which always tickles your toes
 a little bit.  It goes quite well with the black, pannelled walls.  At
 the south end is your imposing front door.  There are a series of
 hooks by the door on which you could hang your coat, if you wore a
 coat that is.  A small bin sits by the door.  There is also a
 full-length mirror on one wall.  As you're the last sight some people
 see, it's quite right that you check that you look presentable.

 Exits: East, South and West



 You can see some mail.

 [ The Hallway of Death | Score: 0 ]
>read mail

 You bend down and scoop up your mail.  It's one of life's great
 mysteries.  If you have any work that day your Supervisors mail it to
 you in the morning.  In all your time you have never once met the
 postman.  Sometimes you wonder if you should get a dog just to see
 what would happen.  Something big and evil.  A hellhound or a pitbull.
 Something like that.

 You have two letters today.  The first is a white envelope addressed
 to a "Mr. G. Raper" and bearing the stamp of "Blackbury Banking
 Services".  Puzzled, you tear it open and read.

 Dear Mr GRaper.
 Have we got an offer for you!!??  You, and others in your specially
 selected postcode region, have been chosen to take part in our
 amazing, introductory offer!  We're offering you a free - that's right
 FREE - credit card with GBP10,000 limit*!  ARE WE CRAZY??

 At this point you throw the letter in the bin.  You live in the
 darkest, emptiest void of time and space in this reality; you are the
 only living (using the term loosely) soul in this dimension and yet
 you still get junk mail.  It's enough to make you livid!  You turn to
 the other letter, which comes in the unmarked, large brown envelope
 that your Supervisors use when they want to contact you.  It looks
 like you've got some work to do today.  You open it and begin to read.

 You have five clients today.  Four standard cases and one
 administrative error...

 You roll your eyes.  Administrative errors are the worst.  It means
 that the paperwork has got screwed up somewhere along the line and
 some poor idiot is not where they should be when they're fated to die.
 As usual, it's up to you to clear up somebody else's mess. You carry
 on reading, though you know the words off by heart now.

 Please find attached the details of the clients.  These clients will
 die, as fated, but for some reason will refuse or be unable to
 progress to their destination.  Reap their souls to complete the
 cycle.  You must complete this task by the end of the day.  Thank you.

 You discard the letter and read the attached list.

 Lord Nigel McWorthington - Himilayas, Nepal

 Ernest Busset - Manchester, England

 Jimiyu Wangai - Wajir, Kenya

 Agathe Laurent - Paris, France

 Splong5b - Nevada, USA

 You pocket the list.  Let's go to work.

>examine bin

 It's a small, metal bin.  Lying in the bin is a letter from Blackbury
 Banking Services.

>look in mirror

 You'd be surprised, but being a very tall, very thin, apparition of
 terror doesn't attract as much attention as you'd think.  As most
 people don't believe in you, the first thought that goes through their
 heads doesn't tend to be "Is that the Grim Reaper?  IT IS THE GRIM
 REAPER!  I'M GOING TO DIE!  I'M GOING TO DIE!" but rather something
 more mundane about a fancy dress party or the current government's lax
 attitude to mental health care.  You tend to move about the world of
 mortals attracting hardly any attention at all.  This perplexes you a
 little bit.

 You give a grunt of approval as you check yourself in the mirror.
 Looking good!

 The Kitchen of Death

 You are standing in your kitchen.  To this day you can't think why you
 made this room into a kitchen.  You don't actually eat.  The back
 window, over the kitchen sink, looks out into the void.  The washing
 machine sits against one wall and a wooden table in the centre of the
 room.  It has only a single chair.  You don't get any visitors.  On
 one wall there is a cork pinboard in the shape of an elephant (with
 the words Don't Forget! playfully inscribed on it).  There are several
 notes pinned to it.

 eat (or go to the toilet) but in accordance with universal laws the

 corner is a large whetstone.  Fixed to the north wall are the brackets
 where you rest your scythe when you're not using it.

>examine scythe

 Wickedly sharp and imposing, this is your weapon of choice for reaping
 souls.  It's a metaphor for your ability to harvest people from the
 land of the living, so it doesn't actually need to be a scythe but you
 find that people expect it.  It's the look of the thing.  Your
 Supervisors have gone to the trouble of making it invisible to mortal
 eyes after that embarrasing incident at JFK airport six months ago.

>take it

>examine horse

 Horse is a skeletal steed.  S/He has been your faithful companion from
 the beginning, whenever that was.  It's hard to come across as being
 noble when you're nothing but a collection of bones held together by
 some unknown, mysterious force but Horse manages it quite well.  An
 equine skeleton is not something that most people would expect to see,
 so they don't.

>examine whetstone

 It's a large whetstone for sharpening blades.  You use it to keep your
 scythe sharp, though you don't really need to bother.  It's always as
 sharp as it needs to be.  You just got into the habit of sharpening it
 every now and then, and you tend to be a very habitual person.

 You are standing on a thin path that is winding through the snowy,
 Himilayan mountain range.  The view is lovely, but it isn't half

 right up your robe.  Right in front of you is a huge snowdrift, under
 which is buried the body of one of your clients - Lord Nigel
 McWorthington.

 Horse waits here, looking quite majestic.








 Lord Nigel McWorthington gazed out over the crisp, snowy scene and
 smiled.  He was glad that he'd decided to do this; that he'd decided
 to celebrate his sixtieth birthday by trekking through the Himilayas.
 His family had insisted on a surprise party, despite the fact that his
 doctor had warned them against giving him any sudden shocks.  Then
 again, his doctor had warned him against mountain climbing too.  But
 he wouldn't trade this for anything.  The view was splendid and
 stretched for miles, and it almost made him shake off the nagging
 feeling that he really should have been at that surprise party.  Sure,
 the family would be disappointed when he didn't show up, but they
 should have made a better effort to make sure that he wouldn't find
 out.  He wasn't stupid.  Leaving the guest list out where he could
 find it wasn't too clever for a start.  But that didn't really explain
 the feeling.  It wasn't guilt but rather something else.  Something he
 couldn't quite put his finger on.

 He pushed the feeling back again and looked into the sunshine, lifting
 his hands above his head.  He felt so alive!  He almost let out a cry
 of triumph, but stopped just in time.  There's no telling what might
 cause an avalanche in this part of the world.  Just then he heard a
 rush of wind behind him, he turned and...

 ...found himself staring at a skeletal horse, ridden by a tall,
 ghastly apparition of horror, who seemed to be reading a list...

 Lord Nigel McWorthington screamed at the top of his voice and gripped
 his chest.  The scream rebounded off the mountain walls and was
 suddenly silenced by an ominous rumbling sound from above.  He looked
 up at the avalanche descending rapidly, turned once again to the
 horrifying apparition and managed the words "You complete and
 utter..." before he was buried under a crushing weight of snow.

 You shrug and climb off Horse.  This was clearly Nigel McWorthington,
 and you suspect that he is (you mean was) the administrative error.
 Seems that death caught up with him after all.  You smile at the
 double entendre and turn your attention to the scene.  To reap his
 soul you have to get to the body, which is currently under thirty foot
 of snow.  You scratch your head in puzzlement.  Why are these things
 never easy?

 Cellar (Manchester)

 This is a dark and dank cellar underneath a house in Manchester.  The
 tough, red brick did a good job of containing the blast from the
 exploded time machine.  The remains of said time machine sit in the
 centre of the cellar, nothing more than a twisted pile of metal and
 wires.  In one corner of the room is a stairwell, in the other a
 workbench and varied selection of tools and objects that look
 suspiciously mechanical.

 Horse waits here, looking quite majestic.  Thomas Brewer stands here,
 looking around the cellar thoughtfully.








 "If this works we'll be famous!" chattered Ernest Busset, excitedly.

 "That's understating it slightly, Ernest." said Thomas Brewer,
 sardonically.

 "Just think of it, man!  Time travel!  We'll be...famous!" Ernest
 Busset could barely contain his excitement.

 "Are you sure this will work?  I'm not confident myself.  I know we've
 run through the figures a million times but...well, I've just got a
 bad feeling about this.  What if it doesn't work?" Thomas sounded
 very, very worried.

 "Nonsense!  This must work!  As you said yourself, we've gone through
 the figures a million times.  Now.  Stand back."

 Ernest sat himself into the contraption.  It looked like the cockpit
 of a glider, surrounded by a mass of wires and bits and pieces of
 metal.  Ernest fiddled with the controls in front of him.  They looked
 like they had been cobbled together from bits and pieces of old games
 consoles.  A digital readout flashed excitedly in front of his eyes.

 "Yes, yes.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  If you're so
 confident it will work then why are you telling me to 'stand back'?"
 Thomas did, however, take several large steps backwards as he said
 this.

 "Just in case!  Who knows what will happen?  Who knows if the field
 will be purely contained to the machine?  I wouldn't want you getting
 sucked back through time with me!  You need to stay here and document
 our success from this end!" Ernest was idly flipping a switch back and
 forth.

 "See, you're doing it again.  'Who knows what will happen?'  Is that
 supposed to inspire confidence?"

 "Just relax, old boy.  Think about what you're going to do when we are
 no longer constrained by time!  What will you do with this power?"

 "I'm going to go back in time and kill Hitler's parents." Thomas
 looked grim, his lips set in a firm line.  Ernest looked puzzled.

 "I wouldn't do that, old boy.  That sort of thing would just make
 Hitler really angry, wouldn't it?  I wouldn't have thought he was the
 sort of fellow you'd want to get on the bad side of."

 "No.  You've misunderstood." 'Again' Thomas added mentally, "I would
 kill them before he was born."

 "That doesn't make sense, man!  I mean, how can they be Hitler's
 parents until they have had a baby called Hitler?  Stands to reason!"
 said Ernest, cheerfully.

 "Never mind," Thomas muttered, "Look.  Be careful" he added, surprised
 at how much he meant it.

 "No problem!  Just watch this!" Ernest cheered, as he reached out and
 pushed a button.

 There was a whirring noise, which increased in intensity until it
 ended abruptly in a rather large explosion.  Thomas Brewer was thrown
 back against the far wall, and crumpled to a heap on the floor. He
 looked up from his prone position to see a tattered, charred shoe fall
 in front of him.
 "Oh dear." he said, with rather considerable constraint.

 He then climbed to his feet and turned to find you watching him from
 the other end of the room.
 "Oh dear oh dear." he trembles, "Look.  Just tell me.  Am I dead?"
 You gaze at the List.

 "Ith your name Ernetht Buthet?" you intone.

 Thomas Brewer looks at you blankly.  It's hard enough for a man to be
 on the verge of humanity's greatest scientific breakthrough and then
 to suddenly be confronted with the possibility that he might be dead,
 let alone to find that the Gatekeeper of the Afterlife has a speech
 impediment.

 "I'm sorry, did you say 'Erneth Buffet'?  Ummm...Do you mean Ernest
 Busset?" Thomas brushed himself down.  You nod irritably.  You've had
 a lisp for as long as you can remember and it's not your fault.  It
 certainly doesn't make your job any easier.  "No.  No.  I'm Thomas
 Brewer.  Ernest Busset is...oh.  Oh no!  Oh no!  Ernest is dead?"
 Thomas exclaims, shocked.  You nod again.

 "Where ith he then?" you ask, looking round the room in annoyance.
 Thomas grins and points at the charred heap of metal in the centre of
 the room.

 "I think the question really should be 'when is he?'  We built a time
 machine, he and I did.  And as there's no sign of a corpse I'm
 guessing that it worked!  It worked!  Do you realise what this means?"
 Thomas was jubilant, forgetting the situation for a moment.

 You shrug.  You personally suspect that it means that they won't be
 selling anything other than one-way tickets but you say nothing.

 "Ha!  He might have survived!  You can't know for certain!"

 You sigh.  You've had to recover your clients from some very strange
 places in the past, but never a different time.  There has to be a way
 to solve this one.

 You've never been one for DIY (other than in the scythe department) so

 magnet might come in useful and slip it into your robe.  As you'll

 metaphorical way - belong to you.  At least that's what you tell
 yourself whenever your rampant kleptomania overtakes you.

 You shuffle through the pages.  Some of the papers and drawings make
 perfect sense to you (such as the angry red bill from the telephone

 There are equations and diagrams that you can't even begin to

 of the more important looking ones to one side.  They form a small
 pile of paperwork that seem to detail some of the most significant
 facts concerning time travel.  You include with them several detailed

 this you file your collection of paperwork into one of the pockets in

 Private Kline yawned.  Guard duty was so unbelievably boring.  He knew
 that he wouldn't have normally pulled this duty for six days in a row
 but recent events with the General's daughter had resulted in this
 sorry state of affairs.  He didn't regret a thing, but...this was
 really boring.  Nothing ever happened.  He was guarding a single door
 in the most heavily protected military faculty in the United States.

 He moved his rifle to the other shoulder and shrugged.  Maybe he
 should play The Game again.  His time on guard duty had been spent
 developing the rules to The Game.  It helped pass the time.  The Game
 involved him seeing how many times he could spin his rifle above his
 head in a minute.  It couldn't be any old spin, however, as the rules
 made quite clear.  The gun had to be held a certain distance above his
 head, at a certain angle.  The spin had to be at a certain velocity.
 It was pretty complicated, which probably explained why - after five
 days - his personal best was only two.  The rules were being reviewed
 yet again.  Maybe version 1.6 of The Game would see some major
 changes.  He didn't want a repeat of version 1.3, where he was very
 lucky not to have shot himself in the face.

 CRASH!

 Private Kline stopped in mid-thought.  What was that?

 CRUNCH!

 It sounded like it was coming from the storage cupboard just down the
 corridor.

 "I jutht trod in paint or thomething!" a muffled (but raised) voice
 sounded.  It was definitely coming from the storage cupboard.
 "Honethtly!  You could land anywhere in the whole building and you
 chooth to land in a cupboard!  Thtupid animal!"

 "Who's in there!" shouted Kline, his rifle raised.  The door opened
 and out stepped an incredibly tall and gaunt figure...

 ..You turn and see the young soldier with his gun raised.

 "Excuth me, but thouldn't you be pointing the other end at me?" you
 offer, helpfully.  You have no need to be afraid of firearms.

 Private Kline hurridly turns his rifle the right way round and looks
 at you, almost apologetically.

 "Identify yourself!" he barks.

 "Me?  I'm the Grim Reaper," you explain, checking The List, "And you
 wouldn't happen to be Thplong5b would you?"

 "Huh?  What?" Private Kline tried to compose himself.  He'd wanted
 some excitement, but this was a lot more confusing than he'd thought
 it would be.

 "No.  I gueth not.  You don't look like a Thplong5b.  I think I need
 to go through that door behind you." you look up from The List,
 certain that your Client is in the room that this soldier is guarding.

 "The door behind me?" Kline's resolve hardens, "No.  No I think not.
 I've got one job in this place - guard this door.  I don't care who
 you are.  You are not getting through."

 You sigh, but then look into Kline's face and realise that you've
 never come across a man with such single-minded determination before.
 Neither have you ever met someone with such total confidence that
 whatever he happens to face he can solve it with his gun.  Your own
 conviction wavers.  Most people, when faced with the Grim Reaper,
 simply give up.  This is new territory for you.

 As a creature formed and given shape by belief you begin to wonder if
 Kline's faith in his gun is so great that it might actually cause you
 a problem were you to try and force your way past him.  You're not
 certain, but neither are you prepared to take the risk.  You didn't
 get this far by taking risks.  This really is very annoying, but
 you're going to have to find a way past Private Kline.

 Jimiyu Wangai sat at the table, a thoughtful look on his face.  He was
 dead.  He wasn't surprised by this - in fact he'd been fairly certain
 it was going to happen anytime soon.  He enjoyed being proved right.
 Well, he'd lived a long and full life but had no intention of giving
 it up quite yet.  His youngest granddaughter was getting married in
 two weeks and he had been looking forward to that for ages.  So he'd
 decided that he wasn't going to go, and had made arrangements
 accordingly.  It had been surprisingly easy to work out.  He'd found
 the answer in a book in a library in Nairobi.  He'd spent the past few
 weeks at this table, waiting.  Now he was nearly there.  He looked at
 the entrance to his hut...

 ...and as if right on cue, you stride in.

 "Jimiyu Wangai?" you ask

 Jimiyu laughs.  "Do you really need to ask?  Has anyone ever said,
 'No.  That's someone else?'"

 You nod.  "They do.  It never workth."

 "I suppose not." Jimiyu laughs again.  You're torn between two
 emotions - gratitude that he has yet to point out that you have a
 lisp, and confusion.  Most people aren't really that happy to see you.
 You sigh.  Time to see what he's got up his sleeve.

 "Your time ith up, Jimiyu."

 "What's the rush?  Haven't we time for a quick game first..." Jimiyu's
 grin is really beginning to get on your nerves.  He gestures at the
 table in front of him.  You notice, for the first time, that he is
 sitting in front of a chess set.

 "Oh...bother," you mutter.

 It's the rules.  If they challenge you, you have to play.  If they win
 then you've got to leave them alone.  If you win they have to come
 quietly.  It's the rules.  The universe likes rules.  The problem is
 that you're not actually much good at chess.  It's never really been a
 problem before.  Most people don't even think of it, let alone being
 foresighted enough to make sure that they die sitting at a chess set.
 You possess a little more foresight however, and have a contingency
 plan.  You committed to memory a failsafe way of winning a chess
 match, an unbeatable strategy, a foolproof way to victory.  With just
 one potential flaw...

 "Bagthy being white then," you offer, trying not to sound too nervous.

 "Ha!  I'm sitting at the white pieces.  I'm going first.  You can play
 as the black pieces."

 "Oh...bother." you mutter again.  Your strategy all hinged on going
 first.  You knew that you should have asked Samuel Reshevsky more
 questions when you met him.

 "Come on.  I haven't got all day...oh wait.  I have." Jimiyu laughs
 again "I have two weeks actually!  My granddaughter is due to get
 married and I'm not missing it for anything - not even death."

 You don't have two weeks.  You have until the end of the day.  If you
 lose, or if you don't play then it's all over.  You'll have failed.
 And you can't have that.

 Hut (Near Wajir, Kenya)

 It's a fairly bare hut, lived in by someone who has learnt the hard
 lesson that true happiness is not found in possessions.  The bare,
 dusty floor is going to leave its mark under your toenails for days.
 Jimiyu Wangai sits on a rickety wicker chair, facing a squat,
 uncomfortable-looking stool.  Between the two seats is a frail table,
 on which sits a chess board.

 "The last person to borrow that costume returned it with one shoe
 missing!  Can you believe the nerve of some people."

 You empathise with his anger.  You often feel like your whole life is
 spent chasing up shoes that someone else has lost.

 "I can't rent out the costume like that," the man continues "It was
 highly popular as well.  If only I could find a shoe that matched the
 feel of the costume."

 He sighs and returns to his list.

>give shoe

 Without saying a word you pull out the shoe that you found in
 Manchester and offer it to the shop owner.  He looks up from his list
 and pauses.  Slowly he reaches out and takes the shoe from you.

 "Why," he peers at the shoe over the top of his glasses "this shoe is
 remarkable! "

 You smile and nod.  Your smile freezes awkwardly as you watch the
 owner smell the shoe.

 "This is incredible," a huge grin bursts on to his features "this even
 smells like I'd expect a mad professor's shoe to smell!  How did you
 do it?"

 Before you can answer (which is good because you weren't sure how to
 answer anyway) the shop owner wades through piles of costume items and
 places the shoe very carefully by the brown suit hanging on the wall.

 "Yes, yes.  This completes the costume once again!" he exclaims,
 happily, "How can I repay you?  I have a couple of surplus items that
 I would be very happy to give you in exchange for the shoe."

 "Itemth?" you ask, interested despite yourself.

 room "Dress for Mr Reaper!"

 "It'th not a dreth!" you hiss loudly, conscious of the other
 customer's amused glance in your direction, "It'th a robe!"

 The elderly lady looks at you, nods and grins, as though you had just
 paid her a compliment.  This is usually how this particular exchange
 goes.

 After about a minute of awkward waiting a hand appears from the
 doorway of darkness clutching a large plastic dry cleaning bag.  The
 elderly lady takes the bag, squints at the attached ticket and finally
 passes the bag over the to the female customer.  She takes the dry
 cleaning, turns on her heels and marches out of the shop into the
 crowd.

 A further minute passes before the hand appears again, this time
 clutching a smaller dry cleaning bag, which the lady takes and offers
 to you.  It's with grim inevitability that you receive the bag.  You
 know how this goes.  The universe is once again having a laugh with
 you, it's own personal whipping boy.  You sigh as, sure enough, you
 look at the attached ticket and see that you have the dry cleaning
 that belongs to a Ms. Victoria Salmon - probably the customer who had
 just left.

 "You've given me the wrong item," you thunder at the lady behind the
 counter.  She grins and nods.

 "That lady hath my black robe.  Thith ith herth!" You wave the plastic
 bag in anger.  The lady grins and nods.

 "I...I...I thall thmite you!  Thmite you mightily!" you holler in
 frustration.  Grins and nods.

 This is going nowhere.  With another sigh you open the bag to see what
 items Victoria Salmon had been expecting to pick up.  To your surprise
 there is a full U.S. military uniform in the bag.  You remove it from
 the dry cleaning sack and give it the once over.  It looks very clean.

 Book Shop (San Francisco)

 You can tell from the books gathered around you that the book shop
 obviously specialises in second-hand goods.  It follows the basic laws
 of second-hand bookshops in that shelves and shelves of books tower
 over you, hemming you in and creating the impression that you are
 actually standing at the entrance to a maze.  You peer around but see
 no sign of anything or anyone except dark corners and bookcases.  You
 dare not try and navigate this shop for fear of getting lost forever.
 You'll have to be content with examining the books that you can see.

>examine books

 You can see countless old books scattered around the shelves.  Some of
 them, by their condition, seem to be just hanging in there as far as
 this life is concerned.  Others are in better condition, but there's
 certainly nothing that you could class as new - or even nearly new.
 The books are also dusty, suggesting that no-one has looked at them
 for a long time, except for two.  One is a thick encyclopedia, sitting
 on one shelf.  By the look of it it's been well-thumbed pretty
 recently.  The other book is a thin paperback called The Ombudsman
 Guide to Chess Mastery (Sponsored by George W. Bush).

>examine encyclopedia

 You reach out and pull the encylopedia from the shelf.  Turning to a
 random page you read...


 In 2004 archaeologists found a strange set of human footprints outside
 a cave in Follina, northern Italy.  The footprints date back about
 12,000 years.  What makes it strange is that the footprints seemed to
 belong to a person who was wearing socks and only one shoe!  The
 prints led to a cave, the entrance blocked by a rockfall.  The
 archaeologists have yet to obtain permission to open the cave.
 Imagine what you could find in there, eh?  In the cave in Follina.

 Hmmm.  Interesting.  You return the book to the shelf.  You don't want
 to take it with you.

 You enter the hardware shop, your feet thudding against the cold tiled

 containing a display of appropriate tools.  You feel lost.  In the
 middle of the store is a large drum which appears to be full of
 thousands of the tiny polystyrene chips that breed in appliance boxes.
 Written on the drum in large red letters is "Lucky Dip.  Ask a staff
 member for details".  At the far end of the store is a counter.

 "Hmmmmm," you mutter.  It's at times like this that your unusually
 long arms come into their own.  After all, everyone knows the
 universal law of the lucky dip.  The best prizes are at the bottom.

 After about thirty seconds of scraping around your fingertips reach
 the bottom of the drum and you begin sweeping left and right.  You
 glance over at the counter to see the store owner looking at you as
 though you were some kind of lunatic.  Ignoring him you turn your
 attention back to the task at hand, and are rewarded by coming across
 a reasonably sized wrapped parcel.  After a second's reflection on
 whether or not to continue searching you decide to take what you've
 found and you haul the package out of the drum, sending polystyrene
 chips all over the floor.  The store owner tuts loudly.

 "Thory," you apologise before examining your prize.  With a thrill of
 anticipation you tear the paper off the parcel to reveal...a blunt
 saw.

 "Ith thith it?" you turn to the man behind the counter.  "Thith thaw
 ith blunt," you exclaim, wondering if there was a way of making that
 statement without using so many 's'es.

 "That's why it's called a lucky dip, sir," the man shrugs. "Luck as in
 'bad'."

 Yes.  Of course.  For you there is no other type of luck.  You sigh as
 you put the blunt saw away in your robe.  Maybe it will come in use
 somewhere down the line.

 Agathe Laurent lay on the bed, smiling to herself.  Death hadn't been
 as unpleasant as she'd feared, but she would still rather cling on to
 life.  She knew where she was with life.  If there was one thing that
 Agathe had always been afraid of it was the unknown.  Well, perhaps
 afraid was too strong a word.  Agathe was loathe to admit that
 anything frightened her, but she was sufficiently troubled to be moved
 to action.

 It had cost her a lot to get to this stage, but she thought it would
 all be worth it if it worked.  She'd have done something that - as far
 as she knew - no-one had ever done before.  She'd have cheated death.

 Standing in the doorway was an impossibly tall and lanky figure,
 wreathed in black and as pale as boiled rice.

 "Come in," said Agathe...

 ..you enter the hotel room, bending to get through the door as you go.
 You give Agathe a nod out of professional courtesy and stride forward
 towards her.  She is still smiling.  You wish that people wouldn't do
 that.  It really unnerves you.  You are a few feet from the bed when
 THUD!  You stagger back, rubbing your nose.

 "Ouch!" you exclaim.  That hurt!  Gingerly, you reach out and find
 your hand pressing against some kind of invisible barrier.

 "It works!  Ha!" Agathe gives a delighted little squeal and claps her
 hands together.  You gaze down to the floor and see, etched on the
 wooden floor in a circle around the bed, a white chalk line.  It seems
 to mark the location of the transparent wall.

 "What the Dickenth ith thith?" you demand, gesturing at the floor.

 "Pardon?  I'm sorry?  What did you say?" Agathe screams, staring at
 you with wide mouth.  You stay silent, your face burning with
 embarrassment (or at least it would be if your body had the
 circulation and blood to perform such a function).

 "I demand to know what thi...what i...what you have done."

 "You have a lisp?" Agathe cackles, "Oh this is just wonderful!  It
 gets better and better!  Death has a lisp!  The Grim Reaper has a
 speech impediment!  How perfect!"

 "I haven't got all day, you know."

 "Is that your horse?" Agathe is leaning off the bed, peering through
 the doorway into the corridor outside, where Horse stands to
 attention.  You stay silent.  She'll explain eventually.  They always
 do.  When people think they've actually got one over you they can't
 help but crow about it.

 "You've got a proper skeletal horse.  That's amazing.  A skeletal
 steed.  Can you say that?  Skeletal steed.  Let me hear you say that."
 There is a glint in her eye.

 This is not going well.  In fact, you think that this is one of the
 the worst things that's ever happened to you, and you've got a long
 memory.

 "Well, I may as well tell you.  It took me long enough to find out
 about it, after all." Agathe shrugs "I've spent most of my time and
 not inconsiderable fortune trying to find out how to cheat you.  I
 built up a library of old, forgotten and - in at least two cases -
 forbidden books, pooling the knowledge of the centuries.  I pieced
 together in several tomes the answer.  Have you ever met Andre Theras,
 the man who wrote How to Avoid Death?"

 "That joker?" You roll your eyes "Jutht the onth.  He got it wrong it
 seemth." You don't take much pleasure in your work but you'd quite
 enjoyed that day.

 "Well, it turns out that he was partly right.  And so was Dr. Ulan
 Buntil.  And so was Madame Elizabeth Fairy.  They all had bits and
 pieces of it right.  I put it together and voila!  I have created a
 barrier around myself that you cannot pass!  And it works!  So you can
 just sit on your skeletal steed and scram, sir!" Agathe is enjoying
 herself immensely.

 "Are you planning to thi...thpen...wait here on your bed for
 eternity?"

 "I can think of worse places to be." Agathe twinkles, winking at you.

 So.  What now?  You can't reap her soul until you can get past the
 invisible barrier - or convince her to leave it.  This is definitely
 one of your worst days ever.

 the alarm, which a few moments later is beeping like R2-D2 trapped in
 a washing machine spin cycle.

 "What?  WHAT?" Agathe screams as the sprinkler system in the room
 kicks into life.  Water gushes from the ceiling in thick streams and
 splatters all over the room - including the chalk circle around the
 bed.

 Agathe realises with horror that her work is being washed away and she
 screams in frustration as you discard the lighter.

 Hotel Lobby (Paris)

 You are standing in a busy, very expensive looking hotel lobby.  It's

 of comfy-looking chairs.  Everything is made out of marble or some
 other very shiny rock.  In the distance you see large revolving doors
 leading out onto the streets of Paris and by the doors is a reception
 desk, manned by a person wearing a garish uniform seemingly pieced
 together from individual items salvaged from a fight between a cinema
 usher and an ice cream salesman.  A lot of people seem to be milling

 You are standing in your living room.  It's quite small and cosy, with

 lies right bang in the centre of the room facing the only window.  You
 often like to sit on the chair staring out into the empty, black void
 of time and space that your home backs on to.  It's not a great view,

 Horse waits here, looking quite majestic.








 Horse descends from the clouds and makes a perfect landing in the
 carpark of the new Blackbury Bank in Swindon, attracting brief
 attention from two employees who are on a smoking break.  The human
 survival instinct kicks in and they soon turn their focus back to
 happier things, such as filling their lungs with tar.  You clamber
 down from Horse, accidently kicking the door of a black BMW in the
 process.  It hurts a lot, but if people don't pay much attention to
 the sight of a skeletal horse descending from the heavens then they're
 not likely to care at all if they happen to see the Grim Reaper
 hopping on one foot and cursing like a trooper.

 After taking a few deep breaths you compose yourself and turn your
 attention to the task at hand.

 The bank clerk's face lights up as she sees the letter.  You slide it
 under the glass and she reads it.

 "That's fine, Mr...Raper." she says.

 "Reaper." you correct her, "Grim Reaper."

 She looks at you for a second and then grabs a pen, with which she
 makes a note on the letter that you received.  She then slides you a
 form and the pen.

 "Please fill this in, Mr. Reaper." she smiles at you.

 You stare at the form for a minute.  It simply asks you to sign if you
 are happy with the terms and conditions.  The terms and conditions
 include graphic threats about what Blackbury Bank will do to you if
 you don't keep up with the card repayments, but seeing as pretty much
 all of the threats don't affect you (except possibly the one about the
 branding iron and the glue) you feel no reason to be concerned.  You
 sign the form and slide it back under the glass.

 "Thank you Mr..." the bank clerk studies your signature for a second,
 "Mr. Groper?"

 "Reaper!" you state again, more firmly this time

 "But you've signed it..." the woman shows you the form through the
 glass.

 "No!  That thayth Mr. G. Reaper, not Mr. Groper!"

 The bank clerk looks at you as though you're the crazy one and then
 taps away on her computer for a second.  A few minutes later she
 presents you with a credit card in your name.  She passes you the pen
 and the sign the back of the card, feeling a wave of pride in your new
 possession and statue as bank customer.

 "Thank you." you say, turning to leave.

 "Ah, Mr. Reaper?" the bank clerk waves her hand at you, "My pen?"

 that you have - will be enough to fool Private Kline.

 After taking a few deep breaths you stroll casually along the corridor
 and end up outside the autopsy room with Private Kline.  He looks at
 you, as though he can't believe what he's seeing.

 "At eath...I mean at eath private," you try to sound like a female
 captain in the United States Army.  Your impression isn't bad, even if
 you do so yourself.

 "Captain?" Kline seems a little unsure.

 "Yeth.  Ahem.  Private Kline, why don't you take a break.  You've been
 doing a good job at...what ith it you're doing?"

 "Guarding this door, ma'am." Kline stands to attention.

 "Yeth.  Guarding thith door.  You've done a good job.  Take a break
 for the retht of the day."

 "Are you sure that you're Captain Salmon?" Kline seems unconvinced.

 You pull out the false ID papers and wave them at him.  Private Kline
 takes one look and his eyes open wide.  You can see the process of the
 military brain behind his stare.

 "Yes ma'am," he eventually says, "Thank you."

 He casually strolls off, probably thinking of ways to improve on The
 Game as he goes.  You wait for him to disappear out of view before you
 hastily remove the uniform (which was really uncomfortable) and
 discard it and the papers.

 "One of your systems went off and contacted us." the fire officer

 "A malfunction.  Nothing more." the manager assured the fireman,
 escorting him to the door.  This was not going so well.  It was only
 the sprinkler going off that had alerted him to the fact that one of
 his guests had died in the room.  It was going to take ages to clean
 up the mess and deal with this unfortunate incident.  And he had
 absolutely no clue why the corridor outside room 247 smelt of horses.

 "Can we at least check?" the fireman objected as he was pushed through

 "No need, I assure you." the manager grinned and waved at the firemen
 gathered outside the hotel.  One of them gave him a two-fingered wave
 back.  Passers-by were stopping to look at the fire engine.  The
 manager clicked his fingers and one of the staff came running.

 "I need you to clear up room 247." he barked.

 thankless task.  To think that he'd given up a promising career at
 McDonald's for this...

 The manager turned his attention back to the situation outside the
 hotel.

 "At least the sprinklers work." he mused, waving again to the firemen
 - who seemed to be arguing amongst themselves.  Honestly.  Who'd be a
 hotel manager?








 Victoria Salmon stood in front of the Major, inwardly seething.

 "There is no doubt that the uniform found was yours, Captain, and the
 papers - though a forgery - were very convincing." the Major was
 reading from a report.

 "Yes sir," snarled Salmon.

 "The papers seem to bear all the hallmarks of being a forgery by Agent
 Sunglasses and the uniform...you say that there was a mix-up at the
 dry cleaners?"

 "That's right sir." Salmon snapped.

 'Well.  I think that the combination of uniform and papers would
 clearly have been enough to fool Private Kline - he's hardly the
 sharpest tool in the box, is he?" the Major chuckled.  Salmon said
 nothing.

 "So, I think that wraps it up.  It appears that nothing was sabotaged
 or stolen, so I assume that the only reason the spy was here was to
 find out what was in the autopsy room.  No surprise there - you can
 read all about what we're up to here on the Internet anyway can't you,
 Captain?" the Major smiled.

 "Yes sir." growled Victoria.

 "You're dismissed Captain.  Thank you for your time."

 Victoria Salmon didn't move.  The Major didn't notice for a minute or
 two, but he eventually did.  He looked up and read the look on Captain
 Salmon's face.

 "Is something wrong Captain?" he asked.

 "Sir.  I read Private Kline's report.  How could he think that it was
 me?" she fumed.

 "I thought we'd cleared that up, Captain.  The spy was in your uniform
 and with some convincing papers."

 'It's not that sir.  His report..." she recalled from memory
 "...described the person he spoke to as a ghastly apparition from the
 pits of hell  Freakishly sized, terrifyingly pale and with the breath
 of a hellhound.  How can he confuse me with that?"

 The Major thought for a while.

 "Maybe he thought you'd forgotten to put your make-up on?" he
 ventured.

 Victoria Salmon screamed, turned on her heels and stormed out of the
 room.  The Major waited for a minute and then picked up the phone and
 made a call.

 "Yes, yes.  Hello.  Yes.  It's me.  Look - you need to be more
 careful.  You gave the papers to the wrong person it seems.  Yes.
 Yes.  No.  I managed to clear it all up.  OK.  Goodbye." the Major put
 the phone down.  Honestly, he had enough on his plate without clearing
 up other people's mess.  Who'd be a double agent?

 "There's no future in it," he muttered under his breath.








 You stare at the void outside, relaxing in your favourite armchair.
 In the background The Eagles are instructing you to Take it to the
 Limit One More Time.  You sigh.  Today has been an interesting day, no
 doubt about that, but not one that you'd wish to repeat.

 You slowly stand up and wander over to the bookcase, where you pull
 out your current diary and think about how to record today's events.
 You smile as you recall some of the situations that today brought you
 face-to-face with.  You suppose that it wasn't the worst day that
 you've ever had - not by a long shot - and it's only going to make
 tomorrow's jobs seem that bit easier.  The more you think about it,
 the more pride you feel in a job well done and the less and less
 terrible today seems to be.  You sit back down in the armchair and
 turn to a blank page.

 Life is good for Death.  Today has, all things considered, been a fine
 day for reaping.

 Thank you for playing.
 Congratulations!

 You stare in horror as the last grains of sand run from the Golden
 Hourglass.  There is a sudden whooshing noise and everything around
 you grinds to a halt.

 Someone did not die on the day that was appointed for them, and that
 leaves a loose thread.  The universe doesn't like loose threads.  It
 tends to panic and tie them to something.

 Someone was supposed to die and they didn't, the reasoning goes,
 therefore death doesn't exist (it doesn't have to be coherent
 reasoning).  If death doesn't exist then there's no need for you, and
 if there's no need for you then you become a loose end that needs
 tying up.  In this case it gets tied into a noose, and you cease to
 exist.  With a sound like the screeching of car brakes you vanish.

 As you drift through space and time, not existing, you ponder on this
 state of affairs.  It's a blow, of that there's no doubt, but still.
 Best to look on the bright side, eh?  Something's bound to come along
 sooner or later.
