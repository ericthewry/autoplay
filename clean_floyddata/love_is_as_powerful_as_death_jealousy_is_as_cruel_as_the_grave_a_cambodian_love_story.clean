 Love Is As Powerful As Death, Jealousy Is As Cruel As The Grave

 A Cambodian Ghost Story

 by

 Michael Whittington


 (If you are new to Interactive Fiction, type HELP.)

 This is how later you would remember these events, almost as if
 reliving them, going over the details again and again, trying to
 recapture the feel of events, putting yourself into them as if they
 were happening for the first time.








 Third World Girls

 Cafe Khmer
 This is the dining room of the Cafe Khmer.

 There's a thin metal table here that Joe is sitting at.  Joe's coffee
 sits on the table.  You haven't had coffee in a long time, actually.

 Joe is here, chillin'.

>examine me
 This is you, Roger West - six feet tall, dirty-blonde hair, and not
 conspicuously out of shape.  You are, you think somewhat critically,
 as handsome as ever.  Unfortunately that doesn't say much.

 "Dude, what's up?"  Joe says.  Joe has started his own small business
 matching private tutors with Koreans who have money.  (There's no
 money in tutoring Khmers.)  You heard he was looking for tutors.  More
 than anything else, you're hoping he can send some business your way.

 (You could say not much, lie and say lots, tell him about girls, or
 ask him about a job, Joe himself, or bring up something else.)

>ask joe about himself
 Joe snorts.  "Yeah, whatever."  Clearly, he thinks your "himself"
 thing was a dumb comment.  Or maybe he just didn't hear you?

>tell joe about girls
 "There's these two girls I'm trying to figure out." you tell Joe.

 "Not surprising" Joe replies.  "Who are they?"

 "One's a Filipina named Mary.  The other's a Khmer girl."

 "Whats her name?"

 "Paridy.  Part-time librarian at the school I work at."  And she's
 neat, you think, but she doesn't have the basic idea of organization:
 of alphabetical order, for example.

 "Aah.  I know them," Joe says.

 (You could tell him about Mary, or Paridy, or ask him about a job, Joe
 himself, or bring up something else.)

>tell joe about paridy
 "How do you know Paridy?"

 "Well, remember, I used to work at your same school.  Just part-time."

 Oh, that's right.  That's actually how you met Joe: he was going out,
 segueing into working only as a private tutor for Koreans, just as you
 were coming in.

 "I wouldn't waste too much time on her," Joe is saying.  "She's a good
 girl."

>tell joe about mary
 "How do you know Mary?" you ask.

 "She used to work at the California School," Joe says.  "That's how
 you met her, right?"

 "Through one of the teachers there, yeah."

 "Yeah, she's hot.  And I think she's the kind of girl you need."

 A pretty blonde girl walks by, distracting you both.

 "What do you think?"  Joe asks you.

 "French," you reply.

>get coffee
 "Hey, hey - hands off," Joe says, holding his coffee protectively.

 "Yeah, so anyway-" Joe says.

>ask joe about himself
 "Hey, man," Joe says, seeming to notice you for the first time.

 "No, you had your chance," Joe tells you.  "Now I'm going to tell you
 about my new girlfriend."

>ask joe about job
 "No, you had your chance," Joe tells you.  "Now I'm going to tell you
 about my new girlfriend."

>inventory
 You are carrying your wallet and your cell phone.

 "Try to keep up.  I know you never have much to say, but this is
 ridiculous."

>ask joe about girlfriend
>examine wallet
 Joe looks you over.  And it's friendly, but it's not.

 Joe raises his eyebrows.  "HuhWhat?"

 A pickup truck, with a rusted cab and a banged-together bed of wood,
 pulls up outside, and a delivery guy props the door open and brings
 some boxes in to the back.

 Your wallet is far less important here in Cambodia than at home.  Your
 driver's license, bearing the name Roger West, would be useless to the
 police, as most of them can't read English, and no license is required
 to drive anyway.

 Like most ex-patriots, you keep your really important stuff - your ATM
 card and your passport, which contains your visa - safely at home.

 Cambodians use American money, mostly - paper dollars.  They use their
 own currency as small change.  4,000 reil to a dollar.  Or sometimes
 4,400.  It depends on which way the transaction is going.

 "Why do I always have to do all the work?"  Joe demands.  "Why can't
 you ever hold up your end of a conversation?"

>tell me about girlfriend
 Talking to yourself won't accomplish anything.

 "I've been dating this girl.  She's pretty cool, actually."  While
 he's talking to you, he takes out his phone and brings something up on
 it.

 Joe the phone out to you, showing you a picture.  It's the image of a
 beautiful Asian girl tied and gagged on a bed.  She's otherwise naked.
 It's actually quite shocking.

 Seeing your expression, Joe laughs.  The delivery guy takes his
 paperwork, climbs into the truck, and drives off.  A moment later, the
 waitress (who you haven't managed to get the attention of) closes the
 door as she passes through.

 (You could ask him about his new girlfriend, a job, Joe himself, or
 bring up something else, or tell him about Paridy.)

>ask joe about girl
 "How'd you meet this girl?" you ask.  "I can tell you're into her."

 "She was a hooker," Joe replies promptly.  "Still is, technically, but
 I told her she had to stop while she was with me."

 You say nothing.  He reads your expression.  "It's okay," he tells
 you.  "I had her tested.  She's healthy, basically.  She has hep.
 That's the only really bad thing.  I'm careful."

 (You could ask where he met her, tell him about Paridy, or ask him
 about a job, Joe himself, or bring up something else.)

>examine photo
 The word "photo" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points
 out an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your
 next command.)

>ask where he met her
 "Where'd you meet her?" you ask.

 "At the X-pub."

 The X-pub is one of the night-life spots in Siem Reap.  You've never
 been there.

>ask joe about joe
>look
 "No, you had your chance," Joe tells you.  "Now I'm going to tell you
 about my new girlfriend."

>ask joe about girlfriend
>ask joe about girlfriend
 Joe looks you over.  And it's friendly, but it's not.

 "Do you want to tell me about your new girlfriend?" you ask.

 "I could talk about her all day," Joe says, smiling to himself.

 "You're dating a hooker?" you ask.

 Joe nods.  "When she was a kid, her parents sold her off to work as a
 child beggar.  One of the ones who try to sell you stuff when you go
 to see the ruins of the temple-city.  It was supposed to be temporary.
 They raped her into it there.  She got a boss who liked kids.  Liked
 making them hurt.  Bad luck."

>ask joe about girlfriend
 "I don't entirely understand how she got out of it," Joe says, "but I
 know she was out of it for a while.  Made friends with the right
 person, I think.  Got back into it recently.  She wasn't out of it for
 too long - claims to be eighteen.  Anyway, there's a few years
 unaccounted for.  Man, she's into some crazy stuff."

>ask joe about girlfriend
 "We have an agreement," Joe says.  "She doesn't let any other guy
 touch her.  But I can do whatever I want, as long as she's getting
 what she needs."

 Joe ponders for a moment.  "Or at least I think that's our agreement."
 He laughs.  "She speaks broken beggar English, and I speak no Khmer.
 Anyway, that's how I'm running it."

>again
 Joe breaks into a shockingly beautiful smile.  "I don't know...  I
 just feel so good for some reason, and just here while I'm talking to
 you, I can't get her out of my mind."

 (You could tell him about Paridy, or ask him about a job, Joe himself,
 or bring up something else.)

>ask joe about girlfriend
 "Sounds like quite a girl," you say.

 Joe's smile lingers.  He just shrugs.

>ask joe about a job
 You say, "I'm really not finding the work here in Cambodia they told
 me I'd find.  They told me having my teaching cert would open doors.
 They told me-"

 "Aw, man, you are such a whiner," Joe says.

>again
 You say, "I'm really not finding the work here in Cambodia they told
 me I'd find.  They told me having my teaching cert would open doors.
 They told me-"

 "Aw, man, you are such a whiner," Joe says.

>examine coffee
 That's Joe's coffee.  It sure looks good.

 "Why do I always have to do all the work?"  Joe demands.  "Why can't
 you ever hold up your end of a conversation?"

>ask joe for coffee
 Joe looks you over.  And it's friendly, but it's not.

 Joe raises his eyebrows.  "HuhWhat?"

>order coffee
 The word "order" is not necessary in this story.

>ask joe about job
 You say, "I'm really not finding the work here in Cambodia they told
 me I'd find.  They told me having my teaching cert would open doors.
 They told me-"

 "Aw, man, you are such a whiner," Joe says.

>bring up something else
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>take coffee
 "Hey, that's my coffee.  Get your own."

 "Why do I always have to do all the work?"  Joe demands.  "Why can't
 you ever hold up your end of a conversation?"

>buy coffee
 The word "buy" is not necessary in this story.

>ask joe about girl

>ask joe about paridy
 Joe looks you over.  And it's friendly, but it's not.

 "I like good girls," you say.

 He shrugs.  "You might like them, but are you successful with them?
 There's two ways to get into a girl like Paridy: marry her, or be a
 pimp."  He laces his fingers behind his head and leans back.  "Like
 me."

 (You could zing him about the pimp comment, tell him about Paridy, or
 ask him about being a whiner, Joe himself, or bring up something
 else.)

>phone the cops now
 The word "cops" is not necessary in this story.

>zing
 "You're a pimp?' you ask.

 "You know it,' Joe replies.

 Hm.  That didn't work at all.  Joe remains un-zung.

>ask him about being a whiner
 "Well, what do you mean I'm a whiner?" you ask.

 "I'll just put it this way - I'm glad I don't work with you."

>pimp
 That command can't be used right now.

>ask joe to come back to my place

 "I think I have a chance with her," you say.

 "And how many girls in your life have you thought you had a chance
 with, to find they'll let you buy them things but you get no
 boom-boom?"  (You have to admit, he has a point.)  "Don't fight what
 you are.  You'll just frustrate yourself."

 (You could ask about frustrating yourself, or ask him about Joe
 himself, or bring up something else.)

>bring up something else
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>ask him about frustrating yourself
 "What do you mean, I'll frustrate myself if I fight what I am?"

 "Ah, y'know, man.  I'm just saying, leave girls like Paridy to guys
 who know how to get 'em in the sack."

>ask him about joe
 "So how're you, Joe?" you ask.

 "You know me, man.  I'm always good."

 "Hey, hey...  c'mon, man" Joe cajoles.  "After all I told you?  You've

 "I'll ask Paridy out," you say.

 Joe considers that.  "Well, it's your choice, I guess."

 Frowning, Joe fiddles with his phone.  He stands, mutters, "Hey, man-"
 and walks away.

 You assume that he was going to the bathroom, or something, but after
 a while you realize he's left.

 And that he's left you to pay for his coffee.

>ask joe for perfidy's number
 Joe's not here - he left in a hurry.  And, it seems, stuck you with
 the bill.


 -The conversation didn't seem important at the time, but later you
 would look back on it and wonder.

 Two days later, you were out on the balcony near your apartment
 talking to your neighbor, Chuck.


 Contagion

 Chuck is basically a good guy - you like him - but it sometimes takes
 him quite a long time to fomulate his thoughts, requiring you to wait
 for him.

>inventory
 You are carrying your wallet and your cell phone.

>aw. We didn't drink it?
 The word "aw" is not necessary in this story.

>open wallet
 No need to fiddle with your wallet.  Besides, it makes you look
 awkward.

>examine phone
 Your cell phone is a tiny, cheap little thing - "cheap" in this case
 being $40.  You know you can get them for less, but you weren't able
 to talk the merchant down any.  This one keeps turning off for no good
 reason.  A good thing to keep with you, even though you have no one to
 call at the moment.

 "There was a big fire the other day," Chuck tells you.  "Did you hear
 about it?"

 "Not really," you say.  "Oh!- I smelled the smoke, a few days ago
 around noon, but with Siem Reap so dusty I didn't think about it.
 What happened?"

 "I heard somebody died in it, but then I heard that, no, all of the
 tenants got out and were accounted for, so it's okay.  Joe was talking
 about it."

 (You could ask him about the big fire, or Chuck himself, or tell him
 about Cambodian history.)

>examine chuck
 Chuck is a small, somewhat heavy Australian.  He's what some people
 would call 'quietly intense', and others, 'tightly wound.'  Although
 he's not looking at you, you know Chuck is giving you his full
 attention.  You think he knows it can be unsettling when he looks
 directly at a person - there's just something about him.

>ask chuck about the big fire
 "I don't really get it," Chuck says.  "Why is Cambodia so poor?"

 "Because of Pol Pot," you say.  You read up on the history before you
 got here.

 "Was there more to that story about the fire?" you ask.

 Chuck says, "Yeah, I guess there was."

 (You could ask him about the big fire, or Chuck himself, or tell him
 about Cambodian history.)

>again
 "You talked to Joe?" you ask.  "I haven't seen him lately."

 "Yeah; he said there had been a fire in New York a couple years ago
 where the parents had been smoking in bed, and the mattress caught
 fire.  Then they tried to get the mattress out of the apartment, and
 when they got it halfway through the doorway, well now there was a
 draft, and it burst into flame.  So they screwed up."

 Chuck considers something, and adds, "He didn't say what they were
 smoking.  I guess the media would have considered it an undiplomatic
 question, under the circumstances.  Maybe nothing exotic, even."

>hi chucky, wanna play
 The word "chucky" is not necessary in this story.

>ask joe about fire
 You see no joe here.

>ask chuck about fire
 "The whole family - the parents and three kids - were all stuck in the
 apartment.  Everyone else got out of the building safely, but they
 were trapped.  No fire exit.  Sucks."

 Chuck motions.  "Anyway, from what I understand, everyone's accounted
 for in this one, thank Christ."

>ask chuck about fire
 "I wonder where the fire was?" you say.

 "I don't know that," Chuck replies.  "Somewhere in the neighborhood.
 I imagine if you walk around, you'll notice the burnt-out husk of a
 building somewhere."

>tell chuck about cambodian history
 "The country was discontent," you say, "because they were under French
 colonial rule.  Pol Pot came to power - there was another government
 between the colonial government and Pol Pot - but Pol Pot came to
 power and he had a traditionalist theory that the reason Cambodia was
 having problems was that it had gotten away from its roots.  Which was
 farming."

 Chuck is listening, but you can't tell how much he is hearing.  He
 nods slightly, but it seems almost rhythmic.

>tell chuck cambodian history
 The story doesn't understand that command.  Please use ASK ACTOR ABOUT
 TOPIC (or just A TOPIC).

 Chuck stands.  "Well, I'd better go," he says, looking over your
 shoulder at the hall to his door.  "Good luck with everything."

 Chuck walks out.

 You can hear him in the hallway saying something to Ted, who presently
 walks in.  His friend George is right behind him.

 "Hey, how's it going?"  Ted asks as he takes Chuck's seat.

>examine george
 George is by far the weaker personality.  Mostly you address yourself
 to Ted and let George chime in when he likes.

 "So what happened on your date?"  George asks, staring at you.

 "Paridy didn't show up," you say.  "Found out later she claimed she
 didn't understand what the plan was.  And that she wanted to hang out
 in a group: so clearly she did understand what the plan was - saying
 she didn't was some kind of face-saving bullshit.  She flaked.  Turns
 out that Cambodian chicks are still chicks."

 You think about what Joe told you: not to fight what you are.

 You say, "She didn't trust me, I guess.  I dunno, I mean, it's not
 like I'm going to tear her clothes off in Lucky Mall and rape her.
 I'm an id beast, but I'm not that much of an id beast."

 "It's part of Khmer culture," Ted tells you, causing George to stop
 staring at you momentarily.  "The first couple dates, she needs to
 have a friend there."

 -George once told you that he became an ex-pat because the women back
 home "wouldn't give him the time of day."  And indeed there is
 something creepy about his manner.'

 (You could tell them about dating (to answer George's questions), or
 dating (to get George to stop staring at you), or ask them about Joe's
 new girlfriend, Joe, Ted himself, or bring up something else.)

>ask them about joe's new girlfriend
 You have nothing in mind to say on that subject right now.

>ask them about joe's girlfriend
 You have nothing in mind to say on that subject right now.

>ask about dating
 'George, you're still staring at me,' you say.  'Was there something
 else you wanted to know?'

 'Not really,' George says.  'What's the follow-up?'

 'She invited me fishing,' you say.  There's this pagoda she goes to go
 fishing; she invited me along.  Later today."

>ask about dating
 You have nothing in mind to say on that subject right now.

>topics
 You could ask them about Joe's new girlfriend, Joe, Ted himself, or
 bring up something else.

>tell george about fishing
 George is by far the weaker personality.  Mostly you address yourself
 to Ted and let George chime in when he likes.

>ask about joe's new girlfriend
 Ted gives you a crooked smile.  George merely makes eye contact.

 You have nothing in mind to say on that subject right now.

 (You could ask them about Joe's new girlfriend, Joe, Ted himself, or
 bring up something else.)

>ask about joe
 "What's the latest on Joe?" you ask.

 George says, "I heard the cops want to talk to him.  Don't know why."

 "Oh, I know why," Ted says.  "His house burned down the other day.
 His apartment building.  So they need to ask everyone questions, for
 insurance and all that.  Can you imagine what a pisser that is?"

>ask about joe
 You ask, "Did Joe lose his passport?"

 "Yeah, must've.  And that means he wouldn't have his visa so he
 couldn't prove he was here legally.  Which is $5 a day they fine you
 for every day you're not here legally.  And he's been here for months.
 If they find him before he gets that squared away, he is screwed."

>again
 "Can you imagine that?"  Ted muses.  "To lose absolutely everything
 except what you're happening to be carrying at the time?  -I loaned
 him fifty dollars.  Would've loaned him more, but I'm hard up until
 payday."

>examine ted
 Ted is an Irishman with what you at first found to be an
 incomprehensible accent.  You've since adapted to it, which you find a
 little alarming.  He has bad teeth from a lifetime of barroom fights
 and an old face from a lifetime of drinking; but he has a young body.
 He works out, and shows it off with a loose-cut tank top.  Ted is a
 cheerful enough guy, but underneath it there's something not at all
 kind-hearted.

>examine george
 George is by far the weaker personality.  Mostly you address yourself
 to Ted and let George chime in when he likes.

>ask about joe's
 You have nothing in mind to say on that subject right now.
>ask about girlfriend

 "Have you seen Joe's new girlfriend?" you ask.  "Is she pretty?"

 "Pretty enough," Ted says, "but she has these little scars on her
 arms.  Some of 'em look fresh.  You know what those are from?  -
 cockroaches."

 "Really?  They'll bite you here?"  You've seen some mammoth roaches in
 your apartment.

 "Oh, will they bite you.  They'll get you while you're sleeping.  Move
 your bed away from the wall and, what I do, I run tape sticky-side-out
 around the legs of my bed, so they can't climb up it.  But she's
 pretty enough, yeah."

>ask about girlfriend
 "I think he really likes her," you say.  "He got a tattoo in Cambodian
 that I think might be her name."

 "If he really liked her, he'd get it in English," Ted says.

>a tattoo
 You have nothing in mind to say on that subject right now.

>ask about girlfriend
 "It's funny," you say: "With Joe being so good with girls, that he'd
 end up with a hooker."

 There's an awkward silence as Ted and George look at each other.

>ask about girlfriend
 "It's funny," you say: "With Joe being so good with girls, that he'd
 end up with a hooker."

 There's an awkward silence as Ted and George look at each other.

>ask about joe
 "Where's Joe staying?" you ask.

 "With his girlfriend, where else?"  Ted replies.  "She's Khmer.  Must
 live, I imagine, in some rat-infested hole with a dirt floor, in
 common with a few others.  No proper door leading out.  I don't
 imagine he's enjoying that."

>topics
 You could ask them about Joe, Ted himself, or bring up something else.

>ask them about ted
 "So what's new, Ted?" you ask.  "How's school?  How's your students?"

 "The usual crap," he replies.

>ask them about joe
 "-And when Joe goes to sleep in that that Cambodian household, he's
 very paranoid about where to keep that fifty dollars you lent him,"
 you say.

 "Yeah he probably is," Ted says, looking a little surprised.  "But
 I've gotten so much work from him, and I know he's good for it, so I
 couldn't turn him down, could I?"

 "Well, it's about time I got ready for my big fishing date at the
 pagoda.  This is dating, Khmer-style."

 "Good luck," Ted says.

 You stand.

 (You could ask them about Ted himself, or bring up something else.)

>bye
 Nothing obvious happens.

>ask them about ted
 Ted gives you a crooked smile.  George merely makes eye contact.

 "So what's new, Ted?" you ask.  "How's school?  How's your students?"

 "The usual crap," he replies.

 You give your regards and go to get ready for your big fishing date
 with Paridy at the pagoda.

 When you get to Paridy's door, you heard voices inside.

 Dissolution of Concept

 You're outside the door to Paridy's apartment.  Traffic goes by
 occasionally - motorbikes, mostly.

>listen to voices
 The word "voices" is not necessary in this story.

>listen
 You hear nothing out of the ordinary.

>knock on door

 Opened.

 (the door)

 Paridy's Apartment
 You walk into Paridy's apartment and see Joe and Paridy hanging out.

 You see Joe is looking an awful lot at Paridy.

 You see that Paridy seems to be paying an awful lot of attention to
 Joe.

 It makes you do a double-take.  Yes, indeed: Joe, of all people, is
 here, of all places, and he and Paridy are so absorbed in looking at
 each other that they hardly seem to notice you.  Paridy is in the
 middle of a story.

 "When they are bad, they go to bad place.  They get no feed.  When
 they come out, they have eat bad feed.  If it good they can not eat.
 You must throw it on the ground for dirty, or rot.  Rotted?"

 Paridy continues, "But they only can come out one day.  One day year.
 Very hungry then.  If their family not to monks, they can not eat one
 year again.  Very very hungry."

 "So how does the family know the right day?"  Joe asks, speaking
 slowly.

 "Oh, yes," Paridy says, laughing.  "There are many pagoda in Cambodia.
 If the family go the wrong pagoda, they not get feed.  But the family
 talk monks.  Monks say what pagoda, what day.  Very important talk
 monks."

 "That's a well-organized afterlife," Joe says.  Paridy doesn't
 understand.  "How do the monks know?  Do they have a schedule?  A
 calendar?  Who tells the dead person when he gets vacation?"

 Paridy is smiling.  "Monks know," she says.

 "How about you, Roger?"  Joe raps.  "You believe in magic?"

 (You could say yes or no, or ask him about his girlfriend, or the
 fire.)

>examine door
 It's open.

>ask him about girlfriend
 "How's your girlfriend, man?" you ask.

 Joe laughs.  He tells Paridy, "Roger is asking about my girlfriend.
 Always asking about my girlfriend.  He wants to know because he
 doesn't have one."  Paridy laughs.  Joe's gaze remains on her as they
 both laugh, but you have the feeling he's looking at you out of the
 corner of his eye.

 Down the street, you hear the duck-like squeak of the squeeze-bottles
 beggars use to call for people to bring out their recyclables and put
 them into their two-wheeled hand-carts.

>say no
 Joe raises his eyebrows.  "HuhWhat?"

 Joe sits on the couch with Paridy.

 "Hey, man, have a seat," Joe says.  He motions beside him, on the far
 side from Paridy.  If you sit there, he's between you and her.

 But, you could sit in the big chair, which is kitty-corner to the
 couch, and you'd be sitting almost next to Paridy.

 '

 (You could sit on the couch (next to Joe), sit on the big chair (next
 to Paridy), or ask him about the fire.)

>sit on big chair
 You sit down into the big chair, kitty-corner to Paridy.

 As you settle into the big wicker chair, you rock the end table that
 takes up the corner between the couch and the chair.  Joe flips out.

 'What the Hell's the matter with you?' he shouts - almost screams,
 really.  'Can't you see I've got a cigarette on there?'

 Indeed, on the end table, there's an ashtray, and in the ashtray
 there's a burning cigarette.  Probably left there, you suddenly
 realize, so Joe would have a reason to keep reaching around and across
 Paridy.

 'What's your problem?' you ask.

 'My problem?'  Joe yells.  'What's your problem, that you're trying to
 burn the place down?'

 Paridy doesn't understand what's going on.  She only knows that Joe is
 screaming in your face, and you're taking it like a punk.

 Joe gets up and walks outside.

>topics
 You're not currently talking to anyone.

>look
 Paridy's Apartment
 Paridy's apartment is remarkably nice, for a Khmer apartment.  It has
 a couch and a big chair, a small refrigerator, a countertop with a big
 portable stove - no gas lines in Cambodia - a big oscillating fan that
 most Western-style rooms have, instead of A/C, and a TV.

 Paridy is here, looking at you.

>examine paridy
 This is the Khmer girl you've been thinking so much of, Paridy.  She's
 slender without being thin, pretty without being glamorous.  And she
 has a real nice smile.  You like her a lot.

 Finally, you have Paridy alone!  No telling how long it'll last,
 though.

 'I no understaan' this,' Paridy says, putting a newspaper in front of
 you.  She points to the headline:

 'Ferry Operator's Fate Still Unknown' Something about the storm in the
 Philippines.

 'What it mean?'

 (You could tell her about the newspaper.)

>tell her about newspaper
 'A ferry,' you say, 'is a kind of boat.  You know boat?'

 'Yes,' she says.

 'But a ferry just goes back and forth, back and forth,' you tell her.
 'Ahh, yes,' she says.


>tell her about newspaper
 'The operator is the man who owns the ferry.  The man in it.'

 'Ah, yes.  What is fate?'

 You think a moment.  'You know karma?'

 'Yes.'

 'Same thing.'

 'Ahh.'  She nods.

 This is all very approximate, you think, but that's how early learning
 works.


>examine newspaper
 You see no newspaper here.

>tell her about newspaper
 'And unknown means we don't know.  So, there was a big storm, and
 people are missing - "Fate of ferry operator still unknown."'

 'Now,' you ask, 'is the man in the ferry alive, or dead?'

 She looks at it and makes up her mind.  'Dead.'

 'No,' you say.

 'Eeh?  Alive?'

 'No, we don't know.  See- it's unknown.  So we can hope.'


>tell her about newspaper
 Honestly, you think she needs a moment's rest on the topic.  She's
 still looking at it, but as Gary Larsen once put it, her brain is
 full.

>topics
 You could ask her about the newspaper.

>ask her about joe
 'I no understaan'' Paridy says.

 She seemed to understand Joe well enough.

>ask her about the newspaper
 Honestly, you think she needs a moment's rest on the topic.  She's
 still looking at it, but as Gary Larsen once put it, her brain is
 full.

 'What it mean, still?'  Paridy asks, pointing at the word in the
 headline.

 Joe walks back in.  'As in, "He's still talking with you about this?"'
 He laughs, and Paridy, only understanding that he's laughing, laughs
 with him.

 Joe turns to you.  'Hey, man, we're going fishing at the pagoda.  You
 can come with us if you have nothing better to do.'

 So there you are.

>topics
 You could ask her about the fire.

>ask her about fire
 'Dude, I heard you lost your passport and all your stuff burned down.
 You okay?' you ask.

 Joe moves back a bit and looks you over.  'Yeah, I'm okay.  Sure, I
 lost a lot of stuff in the fire.  It's a hassle.  But I'm taking care
 of it.'  He winks at Paridy.  She giggles.


 ...and there you went, walking the long dirt road to the pagoda with
 Paridy and Joe, watching them chatting and laughing in front of you.
 A third wheel.

 Scales

 The three of you come to the corner of high walls that enclose the
 pagoda property.  The walls are in good shape, except here at the
 corner, where they have been broken entirely down.  Further ahead down
 the road, you can see that the pagoda's gates are firmly closed.  This
 is the offical way in, you guess.

 As you reach the broken-down corner, Joe and Paridy, giggling, run
 ahead.

>examine gate
 The word 'gate' is not necessary in this story.

>examine wall
 You see no wall here.

>topics
 You're not currently talking to anyone.

>look
 Road by the Pagoda
 The long, dusty road runs east and west.  To the southwest is the
 busted-down corner of the pagoda wall.  Further west, you can see the
 pagoda gates are closed.  East leads a long way back to Siem Reap.

>go southwest
 Inside the Pagoda (corner)
 You are just inside the busted-down corner of the wall enclosing the
 pagoda.  The pagoda itself probably comprises about ten acres of land.
 To the west, somewhat past the gate, you can see small, poor
 dwellings, somewhat hidden by laundry hung out to dry.  Immediately to
 the south, there is a mausoleum, and some ways beyond that there is a
 lake.  A brook runs past the poor houses down to the lake.

 It looks like Joe and Paridy went south, to where you can catch a
 glimpse of water.  From here you could probably see quite a bit about
 most of these things, if you took the time to examine them.

 You hear Joe and Paridy's voices deeper into the pagoda.

>listen
 You hear nothing out of the ordinary.

>examine laundry
>examine lake
 The word 'laundry' is not necessary in this story.

 Far to the south, you can see a small lake.  It's toward the center of
 the pagoda, well away from the eastern wall.

>examine mausoleum
 About halfway down the the east wall, there is a small 'forest' of
 tall tapering tower-like objects, each about the girth of a tree and
 varying in height from ten feet tall to two stories.  These, you know,
 are the monuments keeping the ashes of famous and important people,
 built in exchange for a generous donation to the pagoda and the
 understanding that future monks will pray for their spiritual
 progression during future lives.

>examine gate
 The word 'gate' is not necessary in this story.

>examine brook
 The brook runs from the north, where there are poor houses built on
 either side of it, to the south, where it runs into the lake.  The
 brook is small and dirty, and there is a great deal of garbage on
 either side.

>examine pagoda
 You are moving around inside the grounds of the pagoda.  The pagoda
 walls bound the grounds to the north and east; they break down at the
 northeast corner, where you came in.  Against the east wall, there is
 a mausoleum of perhaps thirty stone Eiffel Tower-like monuments.  To
 the northwest there are a number of chicken-coop-like dwellings for
 deeply poor people.  A garbage-strewn brook runs from those dwellings
 south to the lake.

 It is starting to get quite dark.

>examine garbage
 Every so often around the pagoda, and especially down by the brook,
 garbage is strewn around.  It looks like people have been using the
 brook as a primary dumping ground for years - there are rusted mangled
 pieces of this-or-that, rotting food, bits of clothing - just all
 kinds of trash.

>search garbage
 You can find the same kind of things in the States, on defunct farms
 and industrial parks where the industry has pulled out.

 Pagoda (west of lake)
 On a rock with pigeon droppings nearby - Joe lays his scarf over it,
 lengthwise.  'Sorry, man,' Joe says.  'No room.  You'll have to hang
 out over there - more fish anyway.'  Paridy has become passive,
 pliant.  She almost seems to sleep-walk through this.

 They sit down together.

 You're left off in what in third grade they called 'goat land.'  It's
 not honestly that far away.  In a bar, there would be two empty bar
 stools between you and Joe.

 You can talk to them quite easily.  But also they can ignore you quite
 easily.

 It starts getting dark.  You look at the bamboo fishing pole in your
 hand

 Paridy has her head on Joe's shoulder.

 Joe has his arm around Paridy.

 With all the terrible parasites you've heard of living in the fresh
 water of Cambodia, you don't want to get your feet wet.  Besides,
 there's nothing much on the other side - just some thick, brambly
 grass and different bits of garbage dumped around.

>fish
 You fish a while...

 As your eye tracks the ripples moving out from the line across the
 surface of the brown water, it occurs to you that you could easily
 eavesdrop on Joe and Paridy.

 -Well, no bites.  You guess a naked hook isn't that appealing.

>eavesdrop
 -Ah.  Of course.

 Joe is telling Paridy how secretly vulnerable he is.

 As you listen, Joe says, 'I believe free will trumps fate, but you
 know what trumps free will?  That life is random.  Stuff just happens
 and there's not any reason or rhyme to it.  And people don't accept
 that so they make up fate.  But we can accept free will...'

 -Literal sweet nothings, you realize: Paridy can't understand a word.
 But it doesn't matter, because it's not the words that count.

>again
 No, you've heard enough.

>tell paridy about joe
 Paridy has eyes only for Joe.  This could be a problem, you think.

>inventory
 You are carrying your wallet, your cell phone, and the fishing gear.

>examine gear
 This is a bamboo pole, with a line and hook attached, for fishing.

>topics

 face - like he's snickering.

 The lake is for fishing only, although you have certain reservations
 whether even that's a good idea.

 You can't go that way.  Obvious exits lead north, back to the pagoda
 (empty space near wall); south; east; west; northwest; and in.

>in
 There's no way you're getting in that water.

>go east
 The pagoda wall is quite tall and solid, running north and south.  But
 there is the rubble-strewn break to the north, where you came in.

>go south
 The terrain gets a little rough to the south - all you have there is
 long, brambly grass, and it's not that appealing.  You could go that
 way if it were a matter of life and death, and you had some reason to
 - but not otherwise.

>go west
 With all the terrible parasites you've heard of living in the fresh

 Pagoda (east of brook)
 A small brook to the west of you runs from the north, where it goes
 through the houses, to the south, where it runs into the lake.  A
 rotted log here catches your attention.

>examine log
 This rotten log rests deep in the mud, riddled with bug-holes.  You
 just know if you move it you'll see it teeming with bugs.

>push log
 You move the log with your foot.  As you expected, the under-side is
 teeming with bugs that crawl over one another in their efforts to flee
 what remains of the sunlight.  Soon all but a few have burrowed away
 under the surface.

>take bug
 Oooo, it wriggles to get free!

>put bug on hook
 It's a trick not to harpoon your own fingers (God only knows what you
 could get from a centipede guts innoculation), but you manage it.

>inventory
 You are carrying your wallet, your cell phone, the fishing gear, and a
 centipede.

>examine centipede
 This especially plump centipede, you have to admit, kind of gives you
 the willies.  On the hook it writhes, occasionally flailing, with
 gradually reducing vigor.

>go south
 Pagoda (north of lake)
 You are on the north side of a lake.  You can follow the lake around
 to the southeast, or you can walk north along the brook, which

 Pagoda (west of lake)

 Paridy has her head on Joe's shoulder.

 Joe has his arm around Paridy.

>fish
 You fish a while - and are jolted out of your contemplation of Paridy
 by a sudden jerk on the line!

 You pull it out into the early twilight.  It jerks and twitches in the
 air.

 You've caught a fish!

 Paridy comes running over - not to congratulate you, as it turns out,
 but to hit the fish on the head with a rock until it stops moving.

 Despite himself, you can see Joe is impressed.

 Paridy turns around from having bludgeoned the fish to death, and
 right into Joe's arms.  It just seems to happen.  They kiss: a long,
 deep kiss.  She seems to begin to melt into him, the rock dropping,
 finally, from limp fingers.

 As you watch them kiss, you suddenly feel an intense, crazy jealousy.
 You must do something - just as you must do something when you're very
 hungry, or terribly afraid.  Oddly, it doesn't seem related to your
 feelings for Paridy.  Rather, it seems founded on the plain fact that
 Joe has a girlfriend - that this is wrong.  Distantly, you realize the
 hairs on the back of your neck are standing up, that you have
 gooseflesh along your arms and your spine is crawling.

 Still kissing Paridy, Joe's eyes rove, find yours - and twinkle with
 amusement.  Then, they seem to focus on something behind you, and Joe
 gapes.  A look of naked horror comes across his face.  He forgets
 Paridy mid-kiss; the kiss is not broken, but abandoned.

 -And the feeling of insane jealousy that had completely overwhelmed
 you just a moment before is gone.  You feel only irritation and mild
 disappointment that Paridy isn't interested in you.

 Paridy opens her eyes, sees the expression on Joe's face, and recoils
 from it.  You look behind you-

 Nothing there.

 side, not looking around at Joe, behind you.  You can smell her: she
 smells like girl.  Very nice.

 'Things are random,' Joe mutters behind you.  'If we didn't have that
 game where I left her tied up while I went out with friends - If I
 didn't take her picture with my camera before I left, so if she
 struggled I'd have a reason to beat her - If I didn't leave the whip
 by the bedside so she could see it while she waited- Who knows? - If
 we hadn't upgraded to me burning her with cigarettes - If she didn't
 struggle so hard - If the cigarette had fallen on the floor instead -
 I'd wouldn't even be here.  Random stuff happens.  So give me a kiss,
 baby-'

 At your side, Paridy ignores him.

 It looks like he has a new tattoo on his arm.

 Headed to Siem Reap on the road outside the pagoda, Joe collapses.  A
 tuk-tuk - a version of the Asian pedicab, powered by a motorbike
 rather than a bicycle - stops and, after a shrewd appraisal of the
 situation, the driver offers to take you to the hospital for three or
 four times the normal price.

 Paridy sits as far away from Joe as possible.  You see her looking at
 his arm.  On his arm, you see a strange white mark on his skin.  It
 has an odd shape.  It takes you some time to realize it's shaped like
 a handprint, with the individual fingers clearly visible.

 Just Visiting

 You check Joe in to the hospital.  Paridy leaves to do something.  You
 stay with Joe.  After about fifteen minutes, a Khmer doctor stops in.
 'Your friend has a fever,' he tells you.  'We're running some tests.'

>examine handprint

 The doctor shrugs.  'Suntan lotion.'

 'Suntan lotion?' you ask.  'Look, there are finger marks-'

 'Of course.  He applied suntan lotion unevenly; he had a handful of
 it, wiped it on his skin, and did not smear it evenly throughout.'

 'I find that a little difficult to accept -' you begin.

 'Ah, and are you a doctor?' the doctor asks cheerily.  'Excuse me.  I
 will be back with his test results.'

 The doctor walks out.  You look into the hall.  Behind you, Joe stirs.

 You go over to him.  He grabs you, and his grip is weak.  He says:

 'Random...'

 -and, with a dry, gutteral sound, dies.

 It occurs to you that in all the confusion you left the pail with the
 fish you caught back in the pagoda.
