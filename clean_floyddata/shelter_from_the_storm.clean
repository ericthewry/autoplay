 About Shelter from the Storm

 Works of Interactive Fiction are typically narrated in the second
 person and present tense (e.g.  "You see a gold ring here").  From time
 to time there have been discussions whether this convention represents
 the best way of conveying an interactive narrative.  Shelter from the
 Storm allows you, the player, to experiment with this by choosing the
 person (and the tense) in which the game is narrated.  The opening
 screen of the game asks you to choose the person and tense of the game
 before you start, but you can also change your choice during the course
 of play.  In particular during play you can change between first,
 second and third person with the commands:


 FIRST PERSON
 SECOND PERSON
 THIRD PERSON

 You can also change between present and past tense with the commands:

 PAST TENSE
 PRESENT TENSE

 Apart from that Shelter from the Storm is designed as a fairly
 conventional piece of Interactive Fiction, with not much emphasis on
 puzzles.  The game should be fairly straightforward, but if you need a
 nudge you can use the commands THINK and THINK HARDER.

 Credits

 Shelter from the Storm by Eric Eve

 First and foremost, all credit to Michael J.  Roberts for creating TADS
 3, and Michel Nizette for his work on devising a neat tense-switching
 mechanism, which was subsequently incorporated into the adv3 library;
 without their work this project would have been impossible.

 But just as important, many thanks to my sterling team of beta-testers:
 Jim Aikin, Radical Al, Parham Doustdar, Keaton Graves, Jonathan Li,
 Reiko, Michael Neal Tenuis, and Jack Welch.  Without them a huge number
 of tense/person switching typos would have gone uncorrected, as well as
 a number of more serious bugs (including various cunning ways of
 getting the game into an unwinnable state).  As a result of all their
 efforts this game is a far more polished offering than it otherwise
 would have been.  The blunders that remain are, of course, no one's
 fault but my own.

 Extra Navigation Commands - GO TO and CONTINUE

 As with virtually all works of Interactive Fiction, you can move round
 the world of Shelter from the Storm using standard compass-movement
 commands like NORTH, EAST, UP and DOWN.  In addition you can use the
 commands GO TO and CONTINUE to move around.

 The command GO TO X or FIND X (the two mean the same thing) sends you
 in the direction of X.  X can either be a previously-visited room, or a
 previously-seen object (in which case GO TO X will send you to the last
 location where you saw X).

 The GO TO command takes you only on the first step of your journey.  To
 continue your journey you can use the command CONTINUE (which can be
 abbreviated to C).  Note that a CONTINUE command does not have to come
 immediately after a GO TO or CONTINUE command.  You could, for example,
 enter the command GO TO KITCHEN and then enter a whole series of
 commands for examining and interacting with your next location before
 issuing a CONTINUE or C command to carry on towards the kitchen.

 Shelter from the Storm

 Few things can be worse than breaking down on a dark night in a strange
 place, and even more when it looks like it's just starting to rain, and
 you're in danger of being late for your first posting.  Unfortunately,
 that was precisely what had just happened to Jack that night.

 Jack was on his way to the camp he had been ordered to, but he
 suspected that he must have taken a wrong turn somewhere -- easy enough
 to do with so many signposts taken down in case of a German invasion.
 Then just to cap it all, his car had just broken down, leaving him
 stuck out in in the middle of nowhere (or somewhere on the outskirts of
 Salisbury Plain, which amounted to much the same thing), still miles
 away from where he was meant to be.

 Long Road
 Jack was standing in the middle of a long road running roughly
 east-west between thick hedgerows.  His car lay abandoned about a few
 hundred yards up the road to the east.  Further to the east the road
 ran across miles of open countryside (as Jack knew because he'd just
 driven across it).

>examine me
 Jack was a man of about twenty, dressed in khaki battledress.

 It was just starting to rain.

>examine battledress
 It was khaki, of course, and still a little rough in that Jack hadn't
 got round to getting his tailor to work on it, as some officers did; he
 was still rather conscious of the single pip of a second lieutenant on
 each shoulder.

 There was a temporary lull in the rain, but it didn't last long.

>examine jack
 Jack was a man of about twenty, dressed in khaki battledress.

 It continued to drizzle.

>inventory
 Jack was carrying nothing, and was wearing a beret and khaki
 battledress.

 The rain looked like it could soon become quite unpleasant.

>examine beret
 It was a khaki beret with a Royal Engineers cap badge.

>examine badge
 Jack knew what it looked like without having to look: a bursting bomb
 with the motto Ubique.

>exits all
 The list of exits will now be shown in both the status line and in each
 room description.

>inventory
 Jack was carrying nothing, and was wearing a beret and khaki
 battledress.

>go to car
 He'd just come from there, and he knew there was no point trying
 further east, since he had just driven through miles of open
 countryside.  Jack's only chance of finding something seemed to lie in
 the other direction.

>go west
 Jack walked about half a mile down the road until he arrived at a gap
 in the hedgerow.

 Road by Drive Entrance
 The road continued more or less straight east and west from here, with
 thick hedge on both sides, except just to the north where there was a
 gap that looked like the end of someone's drive.  Unfortunately, the
 small wooden sign by the side of the gap looked far from welcoming.

 Obvious exits: North, East, West

 The rain started to get heavier.

>dance
 The word "dance" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points out
 an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your next
 command.)

>examine sign
 The wooden sign was firmly planted in the ground next to the hedge.  On
 it was inscribed "Wendle Manor" in relatively ancient lettering, with
 "Private - Keep Out!" added subsequently in angry red print.

 It was definitely starting to rain more heavily.

>examine hedge
 There were thick hedgerows on both sides of the road; too thick to
 penetrate and too high to climb, apart from the wide gap just to the
 north.

 A gust of wind blew some rain into Jack's face.

>shit
 (sit)
 (You can use the TYPO command to disable the typo-correction feature.)

 (on the ground)
 Jack sat on the ground.

 The rain was getting worse.

>present tense
 Okay, the game is now in the present tense.

>go north
>look
 (first standing up)
 Ignoring the sign, Jack walks briskly up the drive.  After all, there
 is a war on, and he has his own small contribution to make, if only he
 can reach his camp, so right now his plight seems to override some
 country gentlefolk's overblown desire for privacy.  Jack just hopes
 that whoever lives here sees it that way too.

 Drive
 A great old house stands before Jack, with dark ivy creeping up its
 weathered walls, and a sheltered porch jutting invitingly out into the
 drive, which leads southwards back to the road.  A path that presumably
 leads into the garden runs round the house to the northeast.

 Obvious exits: North, South, Northeast

 Jack's arrival in the drive coincides with a distant flash of
 lightning; the thunder-clap follows about ten seconds later.

 Drive
 A great old house stands before Jack, with dark ivy creeping up its
 weathered walls, and a sheltered porch jutting invitingly out into the
 drive, which leads southwards back to the road.  A path that presumably
 leads into the garden runs round the house to the northeast.

 Obvious exits: North, South, Northeast

 The rain is getting still heavier.  Jack had better get inside quite
 soon if he wants to avoid getting soaked.

>enter porch
 Porch
 The brick-built porch is a small, semi-enclosed area that at least
 affords some shelter from the rain, though little from the cold.  It's
 almost completely bare, apart from the front door immediately to the
 north; to the south lies the way out back into the drive.

 Obvious exits: North, South

 As Jack steps into the porch, the rainfall intensifies by twofold or
 threefold, and a moment later there's a simultaneous searing flash of
 lightning and tumultuous crack of thunder.

>examine door
 The front door is made of solid wood, with no sign of a window.  Next
 to the door is an old-fashioned bell pull and an off-putting notice.

 The rain continues to pelt down furiously just outside the porch.

>firstperson
 (first person)

 Okay, the game is now in the first person.

>read notice
 It reads: NO HAWKERS, NO CIRCULARS, NO UNNECESSARY CALLERS.

 The rain seems to be trying to outdo the days of Noah.

>look
 Porch
 The brick-built porch is a small, semi-enclosed area that at least
 affords some shelter from the rain, though little from the cold.  It's
 almost completely bare, apart from the front door immediately to the
 north; to the south lies the way out back into the drive.

 Obvious exits: North, South

 There's no let up in the downpour.

>ring bell
 I pull the bell and hear a ringing from somewhere inside the house.

 Lightning flashes across the sky, accompanied by loud thunder.

>knock on door
 I feel it would be politer to give whoever's inside a chance to respond
 to my first attempt.

 I can't hear any immediate response to my summons, but it's a large
 house and I realize that it might take someone a while to reach the
 front door.

>shit
 (sit)

 (on the floor)
 I sit on the floor.

 I hear someone moving around inside the house - the sound of footsteps
 approaching the door.

>stand
 Okay, I'm now standing.

 The front door finally opens.

 A somewhat stern-looking woman, presumably the housekeeper from her
 dress and demeanour, appears in the doorway.  "Yes?" she says, in
 heavily accented English.  "Vot is it you vant?  Can you not read?"
 She indicates the sign by the door with a fierce stare and a tap of her
 hand.

 (My immediate thoughts are to either explain my plight, or talk about
 the weather.)

>explain
 "My car's just broken down," I explain, "half a mile or so down the
 road.  I should be reporting to my camp tonight, only -- well, I
 wondered if I might use your phone."

 "I am sorry," she replies, "but Mr Croxley does not want any callers -
 not for any reason.  You will have to find a telephone somewhere else."

 (I feel I could either ask where else to find a phone, try pleading
 harder, or ask her about Mr Croxley.)

>xyzzy
 A large puff of black and red smoke appears, out of which steps a
 confused and terrified Adolf Hitler.  Now forced by my powerful magic
 to obey my every whim, Hitler ends the war, surrenders Germany and all
 its conquered territories to the British Empire in perpetuity, and
 devotes the rest of his life to advocating social justice for
 downtrodden peasant farmers in South America.

 That's a load of old rubbish, of course.  If only things were so easy,
 but magic words are singularly ineffectual in modern warfare, so the
 only result of uttering "xyzzy" is to leave me feeling rather foolish.

 The housekeeper glares at me, waiting for me to speak up or go -
 preferably the latter, if her expression is anything to go by.

>tell her about wall
 "Mr Croxley not seeing visitors, whatever you say," she replies.

 (I feel I could either ask where else to find a phone, try pleading
 harder, or ask her about Mr Croxley.)

>tell her about war
 "This not my problem; you must try somewhere else," she suggests.

 (I feel I could either ask where else to find a phone, try pleading
 harder, or ask her about Mr Croxley.)

>plead harder
 "Look, I'm really sorry to bother you and all that, but I really am in
 a bit of a fix here," I plead.  "As I said, my car's broken down and
 there doesn't seem to be anywhere else for miles around.  This is my
 first posting and I really need to get to my camp.  Can't you just let
 me in for half a minute to make a quick phone call?"

 "The Croxleys are not receiving visitors," she replies stonily.
 "Please go now."

 (I feel I could either ask where else to find a phone, try pleading
 harder, demand that she let me in, or ask her about Mr Croxley.)

>ask woman about croxley
 "Why are the Croxleys so anxious to avoid visitors?"  I ask.

 "It has been a very difficult time for them," she tells me.  "So many
 tragic deaths in the family!  They wish to be left alone with their
 grief - so, please go away!"

 (I feel I could either ask where else to find a phone, try pleading
 harder, or demand that she let me in.)

>demand
 "Now look here, there's a war on and I'm a British army officer in need
 of assistance," I insist, my outward pomposity masking a growing inward
 desperation.  "I demand that you let me in - in the name of the King!
 Otherwise I shall have to assume that..."

 "Ach - all right, all right!" she interrupts, her shoulders visibly
 sagging.  "Everywhere it is the same; everywhere men in uniform come
 knocking on doors to bully the Jews!  You better come in."  With
 evident reluctance she stands aside to let me pass.

>enter
 I follow the housekeeper inside.

 Entrance Hall
 The hall is quite dimly lit, with dark, oak-panelled doors to east and
 west, the front door to the south, and a passage (effectively a
 continuation of the hall) leading off to the north.  Against the west
 wall, next to a small table, a venerable grandfather clock faces a pair
 of stern Victorian portraits staring down from the opposite wall.

 On the small table is a telephone.

 The housekeeper closes the front door after I follow her inside.  She
 points across the hall and tells me, "The telephone is just there.  You
 may make your call - quickly, please, so that you do not disturb
 anyone."

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>examine housekeeper
 She is, I would guess, somewhere in her late thirties or earlier
 forties, a rather morose looking woman with thick black curly hair and
 dark, unsmiling eyes.

>ask her about germany
 "The phone is there," she points firmly.  "Just make your call."

 "The telephone is just over there," the housekeeper tells me, pointing
 to the handset.  "Just pick it up to make your call."

>pick up phone
>call germany
 I pick up the receiver, but the line is dead.  I try pressing the hook
 several times, but to no avail; the telephone remains obstinately
 unresponsive, so I drop the receiver back on its hook.

 "So - do you just stare at the telephone or do you make your call?" the
 housekeeper demands.  "Be quick, please, before you disturb the
 Croxleys; they should not find you here."

 I see no germany here.

>tell housekeeper about phone
 "I can't get this phone to work," I complain.

 "Ach - you're an officer and you cannot even use the phone?" she
 replies.  "You should try harder!"

>dial harder
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>pick up phone
 I pick up the receiver a second time, but the telephone remains just as
 dead as before, so I replace it again.

 "What is the matter?" the housekeeper asks, seeing the way I am staring
 at the receiver.

 (I think I should either tell her about the telephone, or complain.)

>tell her
 What do you want to tell her about?

>telephone
 (the camp)
 I try the phone yet again, but it remains obstinately unresponsive.

>complain
 "This phone isn't working," I complain.

 "That is odd - it was working half an hour ago," she replies.  "Now I
 try it."  She picks up the phone and listens to the receiver with an
 intense frown, and then starts beating the hook far harder than I did.

 Just as she drops the useless receiver back on its hook, there's a
 second, louder, click as a door opens to the west.  Through it walks a
 strikingly attractive young woman.  For a bare moment she pauses in her
 stride as she and I stare at each other, me in frank admiration, the
 young woman in apparent irritation.  Then, turning to the housekeeper
 she asks, "What's happening here?  Why did you let this man in, Hilda?"

 "I am sorry, Miss Croxley, but he insist," the housekeeper explains.
 "He demands to use our telephone - in the King's name, he say! - but
 the telephone is kaput."

 "That must be the storm, bringing the wires down," the young woman
 mutters.  Then she turns to me and asks, "And who are you, lieutenant,
 to come barging in here 'in the King's name'?"

 (At this point I could either introduce myself, apologize for the
 intrusion, or explain my plight.)

>apologize
 "I'm really sorry to intrude like this, Miss Croxley," I apologize,
 "especially as I understand there's been a bereavement in the
 family..."

 "Several," she interrupts me bleakly.  "But it's not your sympathies I
 want, lieutenant, just an explanation of what gives you the right to
 demand entry into our home."

>introduce
 "I'm Jack Percy," I reply.  "My car broke down, about a mile down the
 road from here, and I'm meant to be reporting for duty this evening."

 "That could be a problem," she remarks, her frown starting to soften.
 "Somehow I don't think you'll be going anywhere tonight - not in this,
 not without your car.  I'm Angela Croxley by the way," she adds,
 offering me her hand.

 (It seems best to either apologize for intruding, or shake her hand.)

>kiss hand
 I see no hand here.

>shake her hand
 I shake her hand, saying, "Sorry to intrude on you like this, Miss
 Croxley."

 "Don't mention it, lieutenant," she assures me.  "There's nowhere else
 for miles you could have come.  Now..."

 At this point there's a loud creak from upstairs.  Seeing me glance up,
 she says, a little hastily, "It's an old house, it does that sometimes.
 Now, the question is, what are we going to do with you, Mr Percy?  Well
 - I suppose you must be hungry after your travails.  Can we get you
 something to eat?"

 (My immediate thoughts are to either say yes or no, thank her, or ask
 her about the creaking sound.)

>thank her
>thank her
 "Thank you very much, that would be just what the doctor ordered!"  I
 declare.

 "My pleasure," she smiles, "I'm afraid we ate our main meal at lunch
 and we shan't be eating dinner, what with the rationing and all that,
 but Hilda will take you to the kitchen and fix you a bite to eat, won't
 you, Hilda?"

 "As you say, Miss Croxley," the housekeeper replies without evident
 enthusiasm.

 "I'll be in the drawing room," Angela Croxley tells me.  "Come and find
 us when you're done with Hilda, and we'll work out what's to be done
 with you."  She flashes me a brief smile and walks back out through the
 west door.

 Hilda meanwhile walks over to the front door and locks it, before
 turning to me and saying, "This way!", indicating that I am to follow
 her to the north.

 That command can't be used right now.

>go north
 Hilda leads the way down the passage.

 Hall Passage South
 This is the widest part of the hall, where it opens out to accommodate
 the flight of stairs that leads up to the east.  On the other side of
 the hall a dark panelled door stands closed to the west, while the hall
 itself continues to both north and south.

 Hilda is waiting for me to follow her down the passage to the north.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West, Up

>go north
 Hilda leads the way down the passage.

 Hall Passage North
 The hall passage comes to an end outside a brown door to the north.
 Other doors lead east and west, while the passage runs south towards
 the main entrance hall.

 Hilda is waiting for me to follow her through the door to the east.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West

>go east
 (first opening the east door)
 I follow Hilda through the door into the kitchen.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen looks large enough to accommodate the platoon of culinary
 staff who may have worked here before the war.  Circumstances are now
 reduced, however, leaving the place rather bare: a large wooden table
 at one end, with a single hard wooden chair right next to it, now
 comprises the bulk of the furniture.  A long, old-fashioned cooking
 range runs along the east wall, while doors lead off to west, south and
 north, a calendar being attached to the last of these.

 Hilda stops in the middle of the kitchen and turns to face me.

 "You are wondering what a German woman is doing in this house," she
 remarks.  "I tell you.  I am a Jew, and Germany is no good for Jews
 now.  I leave Germany two years ago and come here.  Too many Jews
 disappearing back home, and very bad things happen to them.  So that
 why I come here.  Now I find you something to eat."

 She goes over to the oven, takes out a saucepan, and puts it on the
 stove.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West

>examine hilda
 She is, I would guess, somewhere in her late thirties or earlier
 forties, a rather morose looking woman with thick black curly hair and
 dark, unsmiling eyes.  She's busily preparing something for me to eat.

 Hilda adjusts the cooker.

>ask hilda about jews
 "You found things bad in Germany?"  I ask.

 "Very bad.  Far worse for Jews than anyone here can imagine," she tells
 me, "and getting worse all the time!"

 Hilda fiddles with a loaf of bread.

>ask hilda about germany
 She's already told me that things in Germany are unimaginably bad for
 Jews and getting worse.

 Hilda stirs something in the pot.

>ask hilda about herself
 "How do you come to be working here?"  I ask.

 "I need position.  I see advertisement in paper.  I come to interview.
 They give me job," she replies.  "Mr Croxley needed someone to look
 after the house after his wife was killed," she adds.

 Hilda takes something out of a cupboard.

>ask about wife
 "What happened to Mrs Croxley?"  I ask.

 "Terrible!" she replies.  "Mrs Croxley go to London to visit her
 sister, about two months ago.  There was an air-raid.  A bomb fell on
 the house where she was staying, and they were all killed.  Mr Croxley
 has many reasons to hate Germans."

 Hilda takes the pot off the oven and pours the contents into a bowl,
 which she places in front of me along with two slices of dry brown
 bread.  "Is not much," she says, "but there is a war on, and the
 rationing..."

 I thank her for the soup, and drink it gratefully, dunking the dry
 bread into it to make it more palatable.  Once I have finished she
 takes the bowl away again and begins to clear up.

 "You know where to find Mr Croxley?" she asks.  "Back down the hall and
 the last door on the right."

>say Haben Sie brechen das Telefon?
 The word "Haben" is not necessary in this story.

>ask her about angela
 "You should go and find Mr Croxley," she tells me.  "He will be
 expecting you."

>ask her about mr croxley
 "I am not wishing to talk now; I have many things to do," she replies.
 "You must go and find Mr Croxley."

>examine her
 She is, I would guess, somewhere in her late thirties or earlier
 forties, a rather morose looking woman with thick black curly hair and
 dark, unsmiling eyes.  She's busily clearing up the remains of my
 frugal supper.

 the flight of stairs that leads up to the east.  On the other side of
 the hall a dark panelled door stands closed to the west, while the hall
 itself continues to both north and south.

 Lounge
 The pale gold wallpaper in the lounge looks rather splendid, but the
 furniture seems surprisingly spartan for such a grand house.  Indeed,
 there is little here apart from four upright chairs and a low wooden
 table, all rather dwarfed by the size of the room.  There are also
 doors to north and east.

 On the low wooden small table is a magazine.

 Obvious exits: North, East

>examine magazine
 It seems to be some kind of theatrical magazine, dated September 1940.

>read it
 (first taking the theatrical magazine)
 I leaf quickly through the magazine, and find it to be full of play
 reviews and actors' gossip, which really isn't my kind of thing.

>go north
 (first opening the north door)

 Dining Room
 A polished wooden dining table, large enough to seat eight or ten with
 comfort, dominates the centre of the room, though only four chairs are
 placed round it, while a heavy old sideboard stands to one side.  Doors
 lead out to east and south.

 On the sideboard is a dinner plate.

 The hall is quite dimly lit, with dark, oak-panelled doors to east and
 west, the front door to the south, and a passage (effectively a
 continuation of the hall) leading off to the north.  Against the west
 wall, next to a small table, a venerable grandfather clock faces a pair
 of stern Victorian portraits staring down from the opposite wall.

 On the small table is a telephone.

 Drawing Room
 The drawing room looks commodious and comfortable, but its faded green
 wallpaper suggests that it hasn't been decorated in a while.  The
 principal furniture is arranged in a broad-U: two large armchairs
 placed opposite each other with a settee ranged in between at right
 angles to both of them so that it faces the fireplace.  The door back
 out to the hall stands to the east, behind one of the chairs.

 On the mantelpiece are three photographs.

 Angela Croxley is sitting on the sofa.

 A man I take to be Angela's father is sitting in the further armchair,
 facing the door.

 Obvious exits: East He rises from his chair at my entrance and extends
 his hand.

 "Arthur Croxley," he introduces himself.  "How do you do.  I trust
 Hilda looked after you properly?"

 (My immediate thoughts are to either say yes, or shake his hand.)

>examine angela
 She's undoubtedly a strikingly attractive young woman, what some might
 call an English rose.  She's somewhere in her twenties, perhaps a few
 years older than I, and has a pleasant, open, round face framed by a
 generous bounty of wavy blonde hair.  She is sitting on the sofa.

 "Hilda - she looked after you properly?"  Mr Croxley prompts me.

>examine arthur
 He is probably about sixty, or maybe in his late fifties, with a rather
 suave air about him.

 "Hilda - she looked after you properly?"  Mr Croxley prompts me.

>yes
 "Yes indeed," I reply, "just what the doctor ordered, thank you."

 "Good," he nods.  "Now, do take a seat.  We've just been discussing
 what to do with you.  I'm afraid it really isn't at all convenient for
 us to put you up overnight."

 "But," Angela breaks in, "we can hardly just turn you out on a night
 like this!  So we thought that we'd wait a bit to see if they mend the
 phones, and if not, and the worst came to the worst, you could sleep
 down here on the sofa - that will be all right, won't it Mr Percy?"

 (Amongst other things, I could say yes or no, or thank her.)

>examine photograph
 Which photograph do you mean, the photograph of an RAF pilot, the
 photograph of a soldier, or the photograph of a woman?

>thank her
 "Thank you, that would be very kind," I reply.

 "Good, that's settled then," she declares.

 Mr Croxley sits on the further armchair.  "Very well, then," Mr Croxley
 sighs.  "Lieutenant, since it seems you're destined to spend the
 evening with us, do please take a seat.  So, tell me, where were you
 trying to get to?"

 (My immediate thoughts are to either refuse to answer, or tell him
 about my camp.)

>tell arthur about camp
 "I've been posted to a camp on Salisbury Plain," I tell him, "but
 that's really as much as I'm at liberty to say."

 "Quite so, lieutenant, careless talk and all that," he approves.
 "Well, at least it shouldn't be too far for you to reach in the
 morning."

>yes
 Mr Croxley does not respond.

>whistle
 The word "whistle" is not necessary in this story.

>sing
 I don't want to inflict my singing on anyone else.

>ask arthur about himself
 "So tell me, sir, what do you do?"  I ask.

 "Oh nothing very exciting, I assure you," he replies with a
 self-deprecating smile.  "I'm just a country solicitor - wills,
 conveyancing, that sort of thing."

>ask arthur about hilda
 "I'm a little surprised to find you employing a German housekeeper," I
 remark.  "I thought they were locking up German nationals as enemy
 aliens!"

 "Not all of them," he replies.  "Hilda is Jewish - she came to this
 country a year or two back.  Things got very bad for German Jews after
 Kristallnacht, and I gather most of the rest of her family managed to
 get themselves arrested one way or another.  I hardly think there's any
 risk of her being a closet Nazi!"

>a him about sign
 I talk about that with him for a while, but the conversation is hardly
 memorable.

>ask arthur about angela
 "Tell me about your daughter," I suggest.

 "I'm sure she's quite capable of telling you about herself," he points
 out.

>examine raf pilot
 The photograph shows a blond man in his early twenties wearing an RAF
 uniform with pilot's wings.

>ask him about upstairs
 This topic doesn't seem to interest him much, so my attempt at
 conversation proves somewhat desultory.

>ask angela about angela
 "Tell me about yourself, Miss Croxley, what do you do these days?"  I
 ask.

 "These last few months I've just been helping my father sort things
 out," she replies.  "What with my mother dying, and Tony, and Adam...
 well, there's a lot of sorting out to do, and as you can imagine my
 father needs a bit of support right now."

>ask angela about house
 She rather deftly changes the subject, so I quickly find myself talking
 about something quite different.

 "Do you see those photographs, Mr Percy?"  Mr Croxley asks suddenly,
 nodding towards the mantelpiece.  "They're the cost of this war, you
 know!"

>examine photographs
 Two are of young men in uniform, one army, the other RAF.  The third is
 of a middle-aged woman.

>ask mr about photographs
 "The photographs on the mantelpiece - are they members of your family?"
 I enquire.

 "Yes," he replies, a little brusquely.  "Mary was my wife.  She was
 killed in an air-raid in London two months ago.  The boy in RAF
 uniform, that's my older son Adam.  He was shot down over Kent in July
 - he didn't make it, I'm afraid.  The other boy is my younger son Tony.
 He got trapped at Dunkirk and didn't make it either."

 (Amongst other things, I could say how sorry I am.)

>say sorry
 "I'm so sorry for your loss, sir," I say.  "To have lost any one of
 them would be terrible enough, but all three in the space of a few
 months - I hardly know what to say!"

 "There's nothing you can say - you or anyone else," he replies grimly,
 "but you'll understand why we're not over-eager to entertain hordes of
 visitors right now."

 About Shelter from the Storm

 Works of Interactive Fiction are typically narrated in the second
 person and present tense (e.g.  "You see a gold ring here").  From time
 to time there have been discussions whether this convention represents
 the best way of conveying an interactive narrative.  Shelter from the
 Storm allows you, the player, to experiment with this by choosing the
 person (and the tense) in which the game is narrated.  The opening
 screen of the game asks you to choose the person and tense of the game
 before you start, but you can also change your choice during the course
 of play.  In particular during play you can change between first,
 second and third person with the commands:


 FIRST PERSON
 SECOND PERSON
 THIRD PERSON

 You can also change between present and past tense with the commands:

 PAST TENSE
 PRESENT TENSE

 Apart from that Shelter from the Storm is designed as a fairly
 conventional piece of Interactive Fiction, with not much emphasis on
 puzzles.  The game should be fairly straightforward, but if you need a
 nudge you can use the commands THINK and THINK HARDER.

>ask arthur about wendle manor
 "This is quite a house you have here, sir," I remark.

 "It is quite a pile, isn't it?" he replies.  "It's been in the family
 for years, but it feels like the three of us are rattling around in it
 rather now.  When my sons were living here too, it was different - but
 those days are gone for good."

 I hear the crunch of gravel as a car comes to a halt up on the drive
 just outside.  Mr Croxley throws a mildly irritated glance at the
 window, as if to say "Who could that be?"

>SAVE
>cf1
 Saved.

>stand
 Okay, I'm now standing.

 "Please do take a seat," Mr Croxley insists, waving towards the vacant
 armchair.

 There's the sound of a car door slamming, and a few moments later the
 front door bell rings.  Angela Croxley starts to get up, but her father
 motions her to stay put, saying "Hilda will get it; that's what we pay
 her for."

>listen
 From the sound of the wind and rain it seems there's quite a storm
 brewing.

 "I'm sure you'll get more than enough exercise once you've arrived at
 your camp," Mr Croxley suggests, "so why don't you give your legs a
 rest while you have the chance?"

 Footsteps clatter up the hall as someone - presumably the housekeeper -
 goes to answer the front door.  There follows a brief rattle as the
 front door is opened, then an equally brief exchange of voices.

>examine window
 The window is hidden behind the curtains.

 "I really can't have you standing over me all evening," Mr Croxley
 complains.  "Do please sit down, Mr Percy."

 There's a quick knock and Hilda pokes her head round the door.  "Sorry
 to disturb you, Mr Croxley," she says, "but there's a Mr Graham here to
 see you."

 Mr Croxley frowns in mild irritation and then gives a curt nod.  "Very
 well, then, Hilda, I'd better see him in the study."  Rising to his
 feet he adds, "If you'll excuse me for a few minutes, Mr Percy, I'm
 sure Angela can keep you amused."

 With a second curt nod, this time to his daughter, he strides from the
 room.

 "I'm sure my father won't be long," Angela Croxley assures me, with
 just the hint of a smile.  "In the meantime, why don't you tell me more
 about yourself, Mr Percy?  Have you been in the army long?"

>sit
 (on the spare armchair)
 I sit on the spare armchair.

 "Did you not hear me, Mr Percy?"  Angela Croxley asks, "I asked if you
 had been the army long - so, have you?"

>no
 "No, not really," I reply.  "I joined the TA in '37 and then got called
 up when the TA was embodied last year.  I spent a few months under
 canvas in muddy fields doing nothing particular, and then got selected
 for OCTU[1].  I've only just received my commission."

 "What made you join the Territorials in '37?" she enquires.

 (My immediate thoughts are to either blame Hitler, or say it was my
 friends.)

 (A number in [square brackets] like the one above refers to a footnote,
 which you can read by typing FOOTNOTE followed by the number: FOOTNOTE
 1, for example.  Footnotes usually contain added background information
 that might be interesting but isn't essential to the story.  If you'd
 prefer not to see footnotes at all, you can control their appearance by
 typing FOOTNOTES.)

>friends
 "Oh, a whole lot of my friends were joining the local platoon, so I
 thought I'd go along too," I tell her.

>note 1
 "I see," she remarks with a gentle smile, "though somehow I suspect
 there may have been a bit more to it than that.  So, have you been
 enjoying the army?"

 OCTU = Officer Cadet Training Unit, a unit for training the
 commissioned officers needed for Britain's rapidly expanding wartime
 army (which obviously couldn't all be supplied by Sandhurst).

>no
 "No, not really," I reply, "but it has its moments.  In any case,
 nothing seems that tough after boarding for five years at a public
 school, believe me!  Besides..."

 Just at that moment the drawing door opens again and Mr Croxley takes a
 step into the room.  "Angela, I wonder if you could join us for a
 moment?" he asks, then turning to me he adds, "We'll be back in just a
 jiffy, Mr Percy, if you wouldn't mind waiting here.  I expect Graham
 will be able to offer you a lift when we're done."

 Angela Croxley rises to her feet then follows her father out of the
 room, pausing by the door to look back and flash me an apologetic
 smile, saying, "See you in a minute; be good!"

 And then they are both gone, leaving me alone in the drawing room.

>look behind curtain
 I know better than to mess with the blackout at night; I don't want to
 attract German bombers.

 I distinctly hear the sound of someone walking about upstairs.

 Entrance Hall
 The hall is quite dimly lit, with dark, oak-panelled doors to east and
 west, the front door to the south, and a passage (effectively a
 continuation of the hall) leading off to the north.  Against the west
 wall, next to a small table, a venerable grandfather clock faces a pair

 I hear the sound of someone coughing upstairs.

>go up
 I climb the staircase up to the floor above.

 Landing North
 At first sight, this part of the landing has a rather higgledy-piggledy
 appearance, with doors leading off in all directions, the space being
 divided by the stair banister, and the landing continuing past the
 banister to the south.  As I get my bearings I observe that the doors
 lead off to north, northeast, east and west.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Down

 I hear the sound of a toilet flushing just to the east.

>go east

 The east door seems to be locked.

 Master Bedroom
 My first impression is of the sheer size of this room, almost enough
 for a couple of football pitches, I think.  Of course that is a wild
 exaggeration, but it is large for a bedroom, with plenty of empty
 floorspace left over even with a large double bed and heavy chest of
 drawers occupying their share.  Looking around further little else
 catches my eye apart from the pale cream wallpaper and doors to south
 and west.

 On the chest of drawers is a family photo.

 Obvious exits: South, West

>examine photo
 The photograph shows what looks like a family group.  Mr Croxley looks
 much as he does in the flesh, suggesting that the photo is fairly
 recent.  The young man in the picture closely resembles that in the
 picture of Tony Croxley in the drawing room.  The three women in the
 picture are less familiar.  All three have dark, curly hair, worn a bit
 shorter on the older woman than the younger two.  The older woman
 strikes me as being a bit plain, while the younger two, though
 sufficiently like her to be her daughters, look moderately pretty.

>look under bed
 I peer under the bed, but spot nothing of interest.

 En-Suite Bathroom
 The master bathroom looks as if it has been completely refurbished
 sometime in the last few years; the fittings are all styled with
 nineteen-thirties chic, while the white tiles covering the walls all
 look still quite new.  The door out is to the east, while a small round
 waste bin sits under the washbasin.

 and continued past the banister to the north, while white panelled

>unscrew it
 The scrumpled fragment had already been flattened out as best it could
 be.

>go east

 Square Bedroom
 My first impression was of a room that felt rather cramped because it
 contained too much furniture.  The large white wardrobe in the corner
 was the main culprit, although a low wooden cabinet, which didn't match
 it at all well, also consumed more than its fair share of space,
 leaving the single bed against the opposite wall to be tucked in almost
 as an afterthought.  This clutter of furniture allowed just about
 enough room to navigate a path from the bed to the door, which led out
 to the west.

 On the cabinet was a wind-up gramophone.

 Obvious exits: West

>examine gramophone
 It was basically a large black box with a handle protruding from one
 side to allow it to be wound up.  It was closed.

>open it
 I opened it up.  Inside the gramophone were a turntable, a pickup arm,
 and a small brass switch.

>examine turntable
 It was round, black, and about nine inches in diameter.

>examine arm
 It was black and just under a foot long, with a stylus fixed to the
 free end.

>open wardrobe
 Opening the tall wooden wardrobe revealed a variety of men's clothes.

>examine clothes
 A number of shirts, jackets and pairs of trousers were hung up on the
 rail, while a pile of underwear sat to one side.  All the clothing
 appeared to be of a large size, much of it was quite plain, and some of
 it was distinctly shabby.

>search underwear
 A moderately thorough search of the clothes in the wardrobe turned up
 nothing of interest.

>push clothes aside
 The word "aside" is not necessary in this story.

>enter wardrobe
 There was no room for me in the wardrobe.

>enter narnia
 The word "narnia" is not necessary in this story.

>examine cabinet
 The cabinet was quite long but no more than about three foot high, and
 could have been made of oak.  It had a flat top and pair of carved oak
 doors on the front.  It was closed.  On the cabinet was a wind-up
 gramophone.

>open cabinet
 Opening the cabinet revealed three gramophone records (a classical
 record, a jazz record, and a linguaphone record).

>examine linguaphone
 It was labelled "Linguaphone German I".

 Square Bedroom
 This bedroom was more or less square, and not particularly large.  Most
 of the space was taken up by the bed, a tall wooden wardrobe and a
 large wooden cabinet, while the walls were covered in striped blue
 wallpaper.  The door out was to the west.

 On the cabinet was a wind-up gramophone.  On the turntable was a
 linguaphone record.  The cabinet contained two gramophone records (a
 classical record and a jazz record).  The tall wooden wardrobe
 contained a variety of men's clothes.

>wind up gramophone
 I turned the handle until it was fully wound.  The turntable started to
 turn, spinning the linguaphone record with it.

>put pickup on linguaphone
 I moved the arm over the record and carefully lowered the stylus onto
 it.  From the gramophone issued a crackly German voice.  "Erste
 Lektion: Die Familie Schneider.  Das Bild zeigt uns ein Wohnzimmer.  In
 dem Wohnzimmer ist die Familie Schneider.  Zur Familie gehoren der
 Grossvater, die Grossmutter, der Vater, die Mutter, der Sohn, die
 Tochter, und das kleine Madchen.  Der Grossvater sitzt in einem Sessel.
 Er raucht eine Pfeife.  Die Grossmutter sitzt auch in..."  At that
 point I decided I had heard enough.  My German wasn't up to much, but
 it sounded like an elementary German lesson to me.  I removed the arm
 from the linguaphone record and switched the turntable off.  The
 turntable stopped turning.

>put jazz on turntable
 (first taking the jazz record, then taking the linguaphone record from
 the turntable)
 Done.

>put pickup on linguaphone
 I couldn't put the arm on the linguaphone record unless the linguaphone
 record was on the turntable.

>wind up gramophone
 The handle was fully wound.

>put arm on record
 I moved the arm over the record and carefully lowered the stylus onto
 it.

>press switch
 The turntable started to turn, spinning the jazz record with it.  A
 rather tinny recording of Glenn Miller's band playing In the Mood
 emanated from the gramophone.  Since I didn't want to attract attention
 to myself I stopped it after the first few bars. I removed the arm from
 the jazz record and switched the turntable off.  The turntable stopped
 turning.

>put classical on turntable
 (first taking the classical record, then taking the jazz record from
 the turntable)
 Done.

>put arm on record
 I moved the arm over the record and carefully lowered the stylus onto
 it.

 From the gramophone came a scratchy recording of Beethoven's Egmont

 Angela's Bedroom
 This generous-sized bedroom immediately struck me as belonging to a
 woman.  There was nothing particularly feminine about the pale blue
 wallpaper, so that wasn't it.  The dressing table by the window was
 more distinctively female, but perhaps what first hit me was the subtle
 smell of the place.  Both the location and the size of the room made me
 suspect that the room was far more likely to be Angela Croxley's than
 the housekeeper's.

 In addition to the dressing table a low bedside cabinet squatted next
 to the single bed, while a built-in wardrobe occupied much of the north
 wall.  The only door out was to the east.

 The top of the dressing-table was littered with feminine paraphernalia.

 On the bedside cabinet was an alarm clock.

>examine paraphernalia
 There was a large hair-brush and comb, some lipstick, the odd
 powder-puff or two, some tweezers, a small bottle of nail-varnish, and
 a few more bits and pieces of that sort, all vaguely esoteric to my
 bachelor eyes.

>open drawer
 Opening the bedside cabinet revealed two books (a dark blue book and a
 brown book) and a letter.

>read letter
 It was dated 10th August 1940, but the sender's address had been
 deleted by the censor.  The body of the letter read:

 "My darling Angie, This is just a few lines to say I'm thinking of you.
 I'm sorry I haven't written more, but things have been a bit hectic
 here lately - Jerry isn't giving us much rest I'm afraid.  Still, I
 bagged a couple of Messerschmitts yesterday, and I think I winged a
 Heinkel too.  If I carry on at this rate old Hermann will run out of
 aircraft to send at us!  But with any luck I may get a spot of leave
 then - I can't wait to see you!  In any case, Adolf has to give up
 sooner or later and once this war is over we can be together properly -
 oh damn, that's the phone going.  Probably another scramble, so I'd
 better finish this now.

 All my love, Adam.

 P.S.  Yes, a scramble.  More later."

 It was all in German, which I didn't read, but as I opened it a piece
 of paper fell out and fluttered to the floor.

>examine paper

 It was just a tiny fragment, still badly creased, with just a few words
 on it.

>read paper

 Only a few words were visible: "... plan now seems unworkable...
 ... may be advisable to terminate Durbury..."

>examine piece of paper
 It looked like a scrap of paper torn from a larger sheet.  It was
 covered in letters and numbers.

>take it
 Taken.

>read it
 The letters and numbers on the piece of paper didn't make much sense,
 though there seemed to be quite a few crossings-out.  It occurred to me
 that some of the numbers could be page numbers, but looking them up in
 the book from which the piece of paper fell probably wouldn't tell me
 much, due to my lack of German.

>credits
 Shelter from the Storm by Eric Eve

 First and foremost, all credit to Michael J.  Roberts for creating TADS
 3, and Michel Nizette for his work on devising a neat tense-switching
 mechanism, which was subsequently incorporated into the adv3 library;
 without their work this project would have been impossible.

 But just as important, many thanks to my sterling team of beta-testers:
 Jim Aikin, Radical Al, Parham Doustdar, Keaton Graves, Jonathan Li,
 Reiko, Michael Neal Tenuis, and Jack Welch.  Without them a huge number
 of tense/person switching typos would have gone uncorrected, as well as
 a number of more serious bugs (including various cunning ways of
 getting the game into an unwinnable state).  As a result of all their
 efforts this game is a far more polished offering than it otherwise
 would have been.  The blunders that remain are, of course, no one's
 fault but my own.

 The standard of decoration was definitely plainer in this part of the

 west, opposite a pair of cupboard doors to the east.  In the ceiling
 was a trapdoor that looked firmly closed, while a narrow flight of

 It was the smell that first made me think this must be the
 housekeeper's bedroom, or rather that indefinable mix of smells that I
 associated with middle-aged women - that and the location of the room
 in what I took to be the servant quarters.  The room was of a fairly
 generous size, and looked reasonably comfortable.  A single bed rested
 against the north wall, at the far end of the room from the only door,
 which led out to the east.  The other furniture consisted of a small
 upright wardrobe, a plain dressing table, and a low chest of drawers,
 all made of some dark wood and all of equally utilitarian appearance.

 Maids' Parlour
 If the location of this modest-sized rectangular room had not in any
 case suggested that it was the maids' parlour, the mild shabbiness of
 its furnishings would probably have given the game away.  Now that the
 housekeeper was apparently the only member of domestic staff retained
 under conditions of wartime austerity, it apparently doubled as her
 workroom and sitting-room.  A battered arm chair nestled against a
 small, scratched wooden table in one corner, while an ironing board was
 set up near the middle of the room, strategically close to the
 fireplace.  The sole door out was to the east.

 On the peg was a dark coat.  On the small table was a wireless.

 Hilda was busily doing some ironing.

 The wireless was playing the Tannhauser overture.

 Obvious exits: East

 "Where you get all that from?"  Hilda demanded, seeing all the stuff I
 was carrying.  "You have come to rob us?  I tell Mr Croxley for sure!"

 (My best response seemed to be to make some excuse.)

>ask her about durbury
 "Who's Durbury?"  I asked.

 Hilda looked momentarily startled, then snapped, "I have no idea.  Why
 you ask me such things?"

>ask her about jeremy
 "So?" she shrugged.

 The wireless continued to play Tannhauser.

>ask her about germany
 "How was Germany, before you left?"  I enquireed.

 "Very frightening," Hilda told me, "especially for Jews, but also for
 everyone else, I think."

>show piece of paper to her
 "What do you make of this?"  I asked, showing her the piece of paper
 covered with letters and numbers.

 "Nothing," she replied, after a quick glance.  "Make no sense to me at
 all."

>examine her on the tenets of judaism
 The word "tenets" is not necessary in this story.

>ask her about adam
 "Do you know anything about Adam Croxley?"  I asked.

 "Only that he shot down by German plane," she replied.  "He was already
 dead before I come."

>ask her about tony
 "What do you know about Tony Croxley?"  I asked.

 "Not very much," she replied.  "He was Mr Croxley's son, in army, but
 not come back from France."

 The overture playing on the radio reached a stirring rendition of the
 Pilgrim's Chorus.

>ask her about angela
 "I had quite a nice little chat with Miss Croxley," I remarked.  "She
 certainly seems a nice girl."

 "Young men are such fools, always going by what seems," she replied.
 "I tell you, Miss Croxley not what she seem.  She don't tell truth for
 one thing.  And then she creep about at night, waking me up when she
 walk past my room, but denying it all.  No, Herr Leutnant, Miss Croxley
 only seem nice.  Behind that pretty face and pretty smile is different
 person."

>ask hilda about attic
 "What do you keep up in the attic?"  I asked.

 "What a question?  Why you care what Croxleys keep in their attic!" she
 declared.  "Besides, why would I know?  I not go there!"

>ask hilda about trapdoor
 "Where does that trapdoor upstairs lead?"  I asked.  "And how do you
 get it open?"

 "Why you want to know?" she replied crossly.  "What business of yours?
 Why you go snooping round house?  You leave things alone, or I tell Mr
 Croxley!"

>ask hilda about suitcase
 I didn't have the effrontery to ask Hilda about her suitcase; to have
 done so would have been to admit that I had been searching her room.

 The wireless broadcast reached a quieter passage.

>examine coat
 It was a dark coat, almost black, with a pocket to one side.

>examine pocket
 The pocket looked quite deep.

>look in it
>ask her about arthur
 "What you think you doing?"  Hilda complained.  "Are you the Gestapo
 now?  You leave my coat alone!"

 "Tell me more about Mr Croxley," I said.  "What's he like?"

 "He seem a good man," she replied.  "He has been kind to me, and - how
 you say? - deals well with so many deaths.  Inwardly he is sad, I
 think."

>search pocket
 "Leave coat alone!"  Hilda insisted.

>ask her about sad
 "I not talk about such things," she replied.

>ask hilda about coat
 "That's an interesting-looking coat you have there," I remarked.

 "Interesting?" she queried, "Is just a coat!"

>ask her for torch
 "Is there a torch somewhere I could borrow?"  I enquired.

 "What you want torch for?" she demanded suspiciously.

 "In case of a power cut," I lied smoothly.  "The storm's already
 brought the telephone lines down, so I thought the power lines might be
 next, and I'm not sure I fancy spending the night in a strange house
 without being able to see anything!"

 "Ach!  Men are such babies - scared of the dark!  And you a soldier!"
 she taunted.  "But I think there is spare torch in - what you call it?
 - small room off kitchen where we store food."

 The Wagner overture continued to play on the wireless.

>buy coat
 The word "buy" is not necessary in this story.

>ask her about scrumpled
 "What do you think this means?"  I asked, showing her the scrumpled
 piece of paper with the remark about terminating Durbury on it.

 For a moment she seemed quite startled as she read the scrap, but then
 vigorously shook her head, "I have no idea!" she declared.  "No idea at
 all!"

>ask her about durbury
 She'd already told me that she had no idea who Durbury was.

>ask her about arthur
 She'd already told me that Mr Croxley seemed a good man, who had been
 kind to her and who seemed to be coping well with so many bereavements,
 although she also thought that he was sad inside.

>tell hilda about photo
 "Who are those people in the photo in Mr Croxley's bedroom?"  I
 enquired.

 "How I know?" she replied.  "Why he tell me?  I not ask such things - I
 not snoop around like you!"

>ask her about graham
 "I think I do not understand your question," she told me.

>ask her about mr graham
 "It is like this," she began.  "Ach!  I have not the words for it in
 English!"

>ask her about creak
 "I'm sure I heard some more creaking sounds from upstairs," I said.
 "There has to be someone moving around there - even if it's only a
 ghost!"

 "No ghosts, no people, just old house noises, like Miss Croxley say,"
 she replied.

>ask her about bedrooms
 In reply she merely grunted and carried on ironing.

>ask her about room with gramophone
 "So many questions!" she complained.  "You are worse than the police!"

>find torch
 What do you want to look that up in?

>find kitchen
 (going east)

 Hilda watched me go.

 Back Passage
 The back passage was a short, narrow space leading from the kitchen
 door (to the south) to the back door (to the north) between two other
 doors to east and west.  The space was further constricted by a flight
 of stairs leading up to the floor above.

 I saw a long wooden pole and a theatrical magazine there.

 Upper Passage
 The standard of decoration was definitely plainer in this part of the
 house, little more than a stale lick of white paint on every available

 servants' quarters and the rest of the house, while a second door led
 west, opposite a pair of cupboard doors to the east.  A ladder ran up
 from the floor through the open trapdoor in the ceiling, while a narrow
 flight of stairs led down to the floor below.

 On the shelves were a pair of folded white sheets.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen looked large enough to accommodate the platoon of culinary
 staff who may have worked there before the war.  Circumstances were now
 reduced, however, leaving the place rather bare: a large wooden table
 at one end, with a single hard wooden chair right next to it, now
 comprised the bulk of the furniture.  A long, old-fashioned cooking
 range ran along the east wall, while doors led off to west, south and
 north, a calendar being attached to the last of these.

 I had arrived at the kitchen.

 Larder
 Shelves lined the walls to east and west, leaving a narrow aisle
 running from the door at the northern end to the small window at the
 other.

 On the shelves were a torch, some tins, some packets, some loose
 potatoes, and some apples.

 Obvious exits: North

 they were beginning to sprout.

 Attic (in the dark)
 It was profoundly dark up there, with nothing visible apart from the
 open hatch leading back down.

 Obvious exits: Down

>examine torch
 It was too dark to do that.

>turn on torch
 I switched on the torch, and it emitted a reasonably bright beam of
 light.

 Attic
 The attic had accumulated surprisingly little junk for a family home.
 Bare boards stretched out in every direction from the open hatch with
 little to clutter them.  The beam of my torch picked out hardly
 anything apart from the odd packing crate and a plethora of cobwebs.
 Almost by chance it also landed on an old blanket covering a pile of
 stuff half-hidden away.

 Obvious exits: Down

>examine torch
 It was basically a black metal tube with a silver switch on the side,
 currently switched on.

>examine crate
 A number of large wooden crates sat on the floor, each of them quite
 plain and none of them giving any clue as to its contents.  The dust on
 the ground near one of them seemed to have been disturbed quite
 recently.

>move crate
 I pushed one of the crates a few inches, along the lines in the dust,
 revealing a loose floorboard.

>lift floorboard
 The word "lift" is not necessary in this story.

>open floorboard
 That was not something I could open.

>examine floorboard
>take floorboard
 It was shorter than most of the other boards, being only about six or
 seven inches long.One end was a fraction of an inch proud of its
 neighbour, and I noticed it wobble when I moved the crate.

 Under the loose floorboard was a dull grey key.  I picked up the dull
 grey key and replaced the floorboard.

>examine blanket
 The blanket was of a dark brown colour, and looked quite worn.

>look under it
 Under the old blanket was a large wooden box.

>examine box
 Smaller than the packing crates, the wooden box was also of higher
 quality construction, being made of some dark polished wood - mahogany
 perhaps.  It was about two feet wide, a foot high, and eighteen inches
 deep.  It was closed.

>open box
 The large wooden box seemed to be locked.

>unlock box
 (with the dull grey key)
 Unlocked.

>open it
 (first taking the old blanket)
 Moving the old blanket revealed a large wooden box underneath.  Opening
 the large wooden box revealed a radio, a pair of headphones, and a
 small tin box.

>examine tin box
 It was a small tin box, painted black, of the sort one might keep
 various little odds and ends in.  It was closed.

>open it
 Opening the small tin box revealed a pencil and a small brass key.

>examine brass key
 It looked pretty new; the brass was still shiny with scarcely any sign
 of tarnishing.

>examine pencil
 It was an ordinary enough pencil, mid-way between blunt and sharp, with
 perhaps about of quarter of its length used up.

 The wireless set fitted snugly in its box, with a coil of wire attached
 at one end.  The most prominent features of the set itself were the
 tuning dial, the telegraph key and the power switch.

>examine paper
 Which paper do you mean, the scrumpled fragment, the piece of paper, or
 the slip of paper?

>examine slip
 It was a receipt from a locksmith.

>examine piece
 It looked like a scrap of paper torn from a larger sheet.  It was
 covered in letters and numbers.

>read piece
 The letters and numbers on the piece of paper didn't make much sense,
 though there seemed to be quite a few crossings-out.  It occurred to me
 that some of the numbers could be page numbers, but looking them up in
 the book from which the piece of paper fell probably wouldn't tell me
 much, due to my lack of German.

 Which large wooden do you mean, the crates, or the large wooden box?

>take large wooden box
 It would have been possible, but cumbersome, to move the box, and
 probably a bit awkward to carry it down the ladder.  On balance it
 seemed better to leave it where it was.

>go down
 Not wanting either to be encumbered with other people's property, or to
 be caught stealing it, I dropped the old blanket before leaving the
 room.  I climbed back down the ladder.

 Goering Room
 I dubbed this the "Goering Room" at once, on account of the large
 picture of Hermann Goering facing me from the west wall.  In normal
 times this would probably have been a bedroom, but there was no bed
 there now.  The only piece of ordinary bedroom furniture was the tall
 wooden wardrobe standing in one corner, otherwise much of the
 floorspace was taken up by a low metal cabinet.  The door out was to
 the east.

 On the metal cabinet was a cine projector.  On the lower spindle was an
 empty reel.

 It turned out to be a recent intelligence report on the Luftwaffe,
 giving details of current German aircraft, photographs of typical
 Luftwaffe personnel, and coloured plates illustrating Luftwaffe
 uniforms and insignia.  Towards the back the pamphlet gave estimates of
 the current size of the German air force and the dispositions of its
 main units.

>read red book
 (first taking the red book)
 I hardly had time to read it all, but a quick skim indicated that it
 narrated Goering's life from his birth in 1893, through his career as a
 fighter pilot (with 22 confirmed kills) in the Great War, his first
 marriage to Karin von Kantzow in 1923, the year after he joined the
 Nazi Party, his leadership of the SA, his morphine addiction, his
 subsequent election to the Reichstag, his Nazification of the Prussian
 police, his second marriage in 1935 to Emmy Sonnemann, his patronage of
 music, his various other offices of state under the Nazi regime, and
 finally his leadership of the Luftwaffe.

 removing his flying helmet while sitting in the cockpit of an
 Albatross.  Various scenes followed: Goering shaking hands with Hitler;
 Goering in conference with Hitler, Himmler and Goebbels; Goering making
 a speech; Goering strutting around an airfield in his new
 Reichsmarschall's uniform; Goering inspecting a parade of Luftwaffe
 personnel.  Eventually I decided I'd seen enough, so I turned the dial
 to STOP.  Both reels stopped turning.

 The word "fn" is not necessary in this story.

>footnote 3
 I'm relying on my recollections of what my father told me were the
 sidearms he was issued with as an officer in the Royal Engineers in
 WW2.  IIRC he said he was originally issued with a Colt .45, which was
 replaced with a Smith and Wesson .38 later in the war.  (Yes, my
 father's name was Jack, and he was posted to Salisbury Plain on leaving
 OCTU in 1940, but anything else in Shelter from the Storm is purely
 fictitious; Percy was his father's first name.)

>open revolver
 I broke open the revolver and checked that it was loaded.  Finding that
 it was, I closed it again.

 Landing North
 The main landing comprised the area at the top of the stairs leading
 down to the floor below.  From there doors led off to east, west, north
 and northeast.  The landing continued to the south past the banisters.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Down

 Hilda came up the staircase.  "Mr Percy, you must come quickly!" she
 told me.  "A man has been shot!  Mr Croxley wants to see you.  Come!
 You must convince Mr Croxley I did not do this terrible thing," Hilda
 urged me, "otherwise I get the blame for sure."

 (My best response seemed to be to ask why she should get the blame.)

>ask her why she should get the blame
 The story doesn't understand that command.  Please use ASK ACTOR ABOUT
 TOPIC (or just A TOPIC).

>ask her why she about blame
 I saw no why she there.

>ask why
 "Why on earth do you think you'll be blamed?"  I asked.

 "Two reasons," she replied.  "One, I am German; two, I am Jewish.  Is
 not good to be German in this country now - you are at war with
 Germany.  Is never good to be Jewish: Jews always get the blame for
 everything.  If you had been in Germany you would have seen that, but
 it is not so different here: Shakespeare and his Shylock, Dickens and
 his Fagin, you English do not like Jews either.  So they say I shot
 this poor man for sure."

 (My immediate thoughts were to either reassure her, or ask what
 happened.)

>ask her about blame

 "What happened, exactly?"  I enquired.

 "There is dead man lying at the foot of stairs in hall," she told me.
 "He has been shot - just now, you must have heard it, ja?  I'm the only
 foreigner in the house, and a Jewish foreigner.  I get the blame for
 this, for sure."

 (My best response seemed to be to reassure her.)

>reassure her
 "I'm sure they won't say any such thing," I reassured her.  "We're not
 Nazis here, and the Croxleys seem like reasonable enough people to me."

 "You must come quickly and tell Mr Croxley I did not shoot anyone," she
 insisted, motioning me to follow her down the staircase.

>tell her about goering
 "Come!  Quickly!"  Hilda insisted.

>smell hilda
 I smelled nothing out of the ordinary.

 I was not a murderer, and I had no desire to harm Hilda.

>SAVE

>go down
 I let Hilda lead the way.  I descended the staircase back down to the
 hall.

 Hall Passage South
 This was the widest part of the hall, where it opened out to
 accommodate the flight of stairs that led up to the east.  On the other
 side of the hall a dark panelled door stood open to the west, while the
 hall itself continued to both north and south.

 A body was lying at the foot of the stairs.

 A stranger, Angela Croxley, and Mr Croxley were standing there.

 Hilda was standing there.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West, Up

 "Ah, there you are, Percy!"  Mr Croxley declared.  "Did you just shoot
 this man?"

 (My immediate thoughts were to either say no, or ask who the dead man
 is.)

>yes
 I wasn't about to confess to a murder I didn't commit.

>examine stranger
 He was a tall, smartly-dressed man of about thirty.

 "I asked if you shot this man, and I want your answer, Percy," Mr
 Croxley growled.  "Well, did you?"

>ask who
 "Who is he?"  I asked.  "He looks a bit like Hermann Goering!"

 "Never mind what he looks like, the point is he's dead and I want to
 know who shot him," Mr Croxley replied.  "Was it you, Mr Percy?"

>examine body
 Apart from the bullet wound in his chest, the dead man bore a
 remarkable resemblance to Hermann Goering.

 "I asked if you shot this man, and I want your answer, Percy," Mr
 Croxley growled.  "Well, did you?"

>no
 "No, I didn't!"  I declared.  "I've never seen him before!"

 "No?" he asks.  "Then what's that gun you're holding?"

 (My immediate thoughts were to either refuse to answer, or tell him
 about the revolver.)

>tell him about revolver
 "I just found it at the top of the stairs," I told him.

 "Did you now?  How convenient," he remarked.  "It looks to me as if he
 was shot at the top of the stairs and fell all the way down, and you've
 just walked down those very same stairs.  I had just gone back to the
 drawing room when I heard the shot, Angela had just gone off to find
 you because you weren't there, and Hilda was doing the ironing in her
 sitting room."

 "While I'd just gone to answer a call of nature," the stranger,
 presumably Mr Graham, added.

 "Quite so," Mr Croxley concurred, "So where were you, Mr Percy?"

 (My immediate thoughts were to either challenge their alibis, lie, or
 tell the truth.)

>tell ; challenge!
 What do you want to tell about?

>challenge angela
 "Where were you, Mr Percy?" he demanded.

 That command can't be used right now.

>challenge
 "It seems none of you has an alibi either," I pointed out.  "Each of
 you was alone when that shot was fired."

 "But we all know each other," he retorted, "whereas you are a total
 unknown, Mr Percy.  How do we even know that you are who you claim to
 be?  So I'll ask you once more: where were you when the shot was
 fired?"

>SAVE
>cf8
 Saved.

>truth
 "I was taking a look around upstairs and came across this room with a
 whole lot of Hermann Goering stuff it in," I confessed.  "I was just on
 the point of leaving when I heard the shot."

 "You have no right to be spying on us like that, at best it's an abuse
 of hospitality, at worst it's proof of guilt." he frowned.  "The fact
 remains that you were the only person upstairs when the shot was fired,
 and the shot was apparently fired by someone upstairs.  I'd say that
 leaves you as not only the prime suspect but the only suspect, Mr
 Percy. Under the circumstances, I think you'd better hand me that gun."

 (My immediate thoughts were to either give him the revolver, or
 refuse.)

>refuse
 "For all I know, you may be the killer," I pointed out, "so I think
 I'll hang on to it."

 "Not good enough," Croxley replied evenly.  "Your refusal to hand over
 the weapon can only be construed as proof of guilt.  Now, give me the
 gun."

>ask him about goering
 "I'm not discussing anything till you give me the gun," Croxley
 insisted.

>shoot him
 (with the revolver)
 I was not a murderer, and I had no desire to harm Mr Croxley.

 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

>refuse
 It looked like he wasn't going to take no for an answer.

>examine phone
 I saw no phone there.

 It would have seemed rather rude to walk away in the middle of a

 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

 It looked like he wasn't going to take no for an answer.

>examine angela
 She was undoubtedly a strikingly attractive young woman, what some
 might call an English rose.  She was somewhere in her twenties, perhaps
 a few years older than I, and had a pleasant, open, round face framed
 by a generous bounty of wavy blonde hair.  She was staring at me
 accusingly.

 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

>examine body
 Apart from the bullet wound in his chest, the dead man bore a
 remarkable resemblance to Hermann Goering.

 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

>search body
 Somehow I didn't think I'd get away with trying that with Mr Croxley
 standing there watching me like a hawk.

>give gun to graham
 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

 Common courtesy demanded that me answer Mr Croxley before addressing Mr
 Graham.

 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

>examine croxley
 (Mr Croxley)
 He was probably about sixty, or maybe in his late fifties, with a
 rather suave air about him.  He was standing by the body

 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

>shoot gun
 (with the revolver)
 I couldn't shoot the revolver with itself.

 "The gun, Mr Percy," Croxley reminded me, "Now, please."

>give gun to croxley
 (Mr Croxley)
 "Thank you," he said as he took the gun off me.  "Hm," he added as he
 examined it, "this looks like mine.  Well, the telephone is still out
 of order so we can't call the police, so for now we're going to have to
 deal with this ourselves.  Do you have anything to add to what you've
 already told us, Mr Percy?"

 (My immediate thoughts were to either mention the other staircase, or
 tell him about the radio.)

>tell him about radio
 "Did you know about the radio transmitter hidden in the attic?"  I
 asked.  Seeing his puzzled expression, I continued, "I thought not; so
 I'm not the only unexplained presence here."

 "I hardly see what a radio transmitter has to do with any of this,"
 Croxley frowned.  His scowl deepened, then he went on, "Anyway, it's
 nonsense.  If there were a radio transmitter in the house I'm sure I'd
 know about it!"

 "It would do no harm to check, surely," Angela Croxley suggested.  "If
 he's lying we may as well be certain he is."

 Her father's scowl deepened even further.  After a brief pause he gave
 a curt nod and said, "Very well, if you must, go and check his story -
 let him show you this alleged radio. But just in case, you'd better
 take this." he added, handing her the revolver.

 "So, Mr Percy, will you show me this radio, please?" she requested.

>no
 "No, I'm sure you can find it perfectly well for yourself, Miss
 Croxley," I replied.  "It's just up in the attic.  It seems I have
 unfinished business with your father here."

 "That can wait until we establish the truth about this alleged radio
 transmitter," he assured me.

 "That's settled then," she declares.  "Lead on then, Mr Percy."

>tell him about angela
 "That's entirely beside the point right now, Mr Percy," Mr Croxley
 pointed out.  "All I want to know is whether you have anything to add
 to your account."

>tell him about other staircase
 "Never mind that now," Mr Croxley interrupted impatiently.  "All I'm
 interested in right now is whether you can add anything that might shed
 any further light on this."

>mention staircase
 "How do you know that I was the only person upstairs?"  I asked.  "This
 house has two staircases; that must offer all sorts of possibilities."

 "A little far-fetched, don't you think, Mr Percy?" he objected.  "We
 know you were upstairs.  Any one of us would have to have been both
 remarkably quick and remarkably stealthy to have arrived here with the
 rest of us without inviting suspicion, and without being seen by you."

 "Still, it could be possible," Hilda remarked.  "Murderer could shoot
 victim, drop gun, and hurry down back staircase then come here through
 kitchen.  In confusion no one notice, nicht wahr?"

 "Thank you for your very fair-minded suggestion, Hilda, but I still
 don't believe any of us did this.  To my mind, that still leaves Mr
 Percy here as our chief suspect - unless he can come up with anything
 that changes my mind.  Well, Mr Percy, have you anything to add?"

 Angela Croxley asked.

 "Yes, of course," I replied.

 "Good," she replied.  "Lead on then, Mr Percy."

 Angela followed me up the staircase.

 Landing North
 The main landing comprised the area at the top of the stairs leading
 down to the floor below.  From there doors led off to east, west, north
 and northeast.  The landing continued to the south past the banisters.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 "I'm not impressed, Mr Percy," Angela remarked.  "We offer you shelter
 from the storm, and you repay us by snooping all over our house."

 (My immediate thoughts were to either tell her about the noises, or
 apologize.)

>tell her about noises
 "I heard noises upstairs," I said.  "Not just floorboards creaking, but
 footsteps, I was sure of it.  I thought perhaps you were being burgled
 - and given that body downstairs..."

 "He's not a burglar," she interrupted me, clearly unimpressed.

 The word "him" doesn't refer to anything right now.

 Angela followed me through the northeast door.

 Upper Passage
 The standard of decoration was definitely plainer in this part of the
 house, little more than a stale lick of white paint on every available
 surface.  The door to the southwest marked the boundary between the
 servants' quarters and the rest of the house, while a second door led
 west, opposite a pair of cupboard doors to the east.  A ladder ran up
 from the floor through the open trapdoor in the ceiling, while a narrow
 flight of stairs led down to the floor below.

 On the shelves were a pair of folded white sheets.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Attic (in the dark)
 It was profoundly dark up there, with nothing visible apart from the
 open hatch leading back down.

 Obvious exits: Down

 I had arrived at the attic.

>c
 I wasn't on a journey.

>turn on torch
 I switched on the torch, and it emitted a reasonably bright beam of
 light.

 Attic
 The attic had accumulated surprisingly little junk for a family home.
 Bare boards stretched out in every direction from the open hatch with
 little to clutter them.  The beam of my torch picked out hardly
 anything apart from the odd packing crate and a plethora of cobwebs.
 There was also a large wooden box in the corner by the window.

 The loose floorboard was scarcely noticeable, being nearly flush with
 the floor.

 I saw an old blanket there.  The large wooden box contained a radio.

 Angela was right beside me.

 Obvious exits: Down

>ask angela about footsteps
 "Until I see that radio transmitter I shan't believe a thing you tell
 me, Mr Percy," she answered.  "Neither shall I be at all inclined to
 give anything away."

>show radio to angela
 "There it is," I said.

 "Well - that certainly does look like a radio transmitter," she agreed,
 frowning with concern, "and it certainly shouldn't be here."  She
 paused for a moment, her hand pushed deep up into her hair in a gesture
 of almost frantic thought.  "I suppose there's no way you could have
 smuggled it up here," she continued, as much to herself as to me, "but
 that still doesn't explain how you found it."  Letting her hand fall to
 her side she finally turned to me and asked, "Why, Mr Percy; why were
 you up here?  Why were you searching our house so thoroughly that you
 managed to find a hidden radio the rest of us missed?"

 (I wondered whether to explain my suspicions, or counter-attack.)

>counter attack
 "Oh no," I said.  "You're the one with the explaining to do, Miss
 Croxley, you're the one with a hidden radio transmitter in your house."

 She frowned in annoyance, "I swear I've never seen that radio before.
 I had no idea it was here.  And I still want to know why you think you
 have the right to go snooping around our house."

>because I'm the army
 The word "because" is not necessary in this story.

>ask her about goering
 "Please don't try to change the subject, Mr Percy," she begged.  "This
 is important - I need to know if I can trust you.  So tell me, why were
 you making such a thorough search of our house?"

>suspicions
 "Too much round here seems far too fishy," I replied.  "For one thing,
 it's obvious you've all been trying to conceal that Goering look-alike
 without anyone knowing about it.  So, I thought - well, there is a war
 on, I do hold the King's commission, so I considered it my duty to try
 to find out more.  For all I know you may all be a nest of German spies
 - and this radio rather confirms it, doesn't it?"  Before she could
 answer, I continued, "But finding the radio - well, that was a spot of
 luck really.  It was just the more I found, the more suspicious I
 became, so the harder I looked."

 She regarded me steadily for a moment, her lively blue eyes probing my
 face as if trying to read truth or falsehood there.  "I see," she said
 finally.  "I suppose that could be true, but not only does it leave
 this radio unexplained, it leaves a murder unexplained.  So what do we
 do now?"

 (My immediate thoughts were to either ask her about her father, Mr
 Graham, Hilda, or the corpse, talk about the radio, suggest reporting
 to her father, or propose looking for more clues.)

>ask her about footsteps
 "It's more important to decide what we're going to do now," she
 replied.  "So what do you suggest?"

>kiss me
>ask her about corpse
 I could not kiss myself.

 "A penny for your thoughts, Mr Percy," Angela remarked.  "What should
 we do now?"

 "What about that fellow downstairs - the one who was shot," I asked.
 "Could this be his radio?"

 "I suppose it could," she agreed, "but I don't see how he could have
 shot himself.  I mean, people don't normally shoot themselves in the
 chest, do they?  So what do you think we should do: search his room for
 further clues - or what?"

>ask her about durbury
 "We can talk about that some other time," she insisted.  "The immediate
 question is: what are we going to do now?"

>ask her about hilda
 "How much do you actually know about your housekeeper?"  I asked.  "I
 mean, she is German, and her room is closest to this attic; she'd have
 plenty of opportunity to sneak up here and use the radio when no one
 was looking!"

 "But Hilda's Jewish, she came here to get away from the Nazis, so why
 would she want to help them?"  Angela protested.  "Besides, I doubt she
 even knows how to handle a gun!  No, I can't believe it's Hilda - not
 without a lot more evidence, anyway!  So, what should we do next?"

>talk about radio
 "We're only assuming that this radio is being used to contact the
 enemy," I mused.  "We don't know it for a fact."

 "True, but it seems a pretty safe assumption, doesn't it?" she replied.
 "I mean, if it was for some legitimate purpose, why would it be kept
 hidden up here in the attic where none of us knew about it?  I don't
 think either of us could be accused of jumping to absurd conclusions if
 we assume the radio is linked with spying.  So who's the spy and who's
 the killer, and how are they linked?  What do you think we should do
 about it?"

>find coat
 (going down)

 It would have seemed rather rude to walk away in the middle of a
 conversation.

 I was unable to continue on my journey.

>ask her about mr graham
 "What about your visitor, Mr Graham?"  I enquired.  "Do you know much
 about him?"

 "Not a lot," she admitted.  "I suppose he could have shot T... that man
 downstairs.  But I don't see how he could be responsible for the radio!
 So - what do you think we should do now?"

>talk about suitcase
 "I'd rather you didn't keep trying to change the subject, Mr Percy,"
 she complained.  "In case you've forgotten, there's just been a murder.
 So, what do we do now?"

>clues
 "I suppose the only thing we can do is hunt around for more clues," I
 proposed.  "I mean, if someone in the house is sending messages to the
 enemy, they may have some notes of messages sent and received, or
 something else that gives them away."

 She frowned for a moment, then let out a deep sigh.  "Yes, I suppose
 you're right," she agreed at last.  "I just don't like the idea of
 poking around in other people's private possessions.  It feels so - so
 unpleasant.  But we don't have much choice now, do we?"

>ask her about T
 "Changing the subject is just delaying the inevitable, isn't it?" she
 suggested.  "You've only confirmed what I really knew all along we were
 going to have to do, so let's get it over with!"

>ask her about tony
 "What were your brothers like?"  I asked.

 "Adam - well, we always thought he'd be a bit of a high-flyer, only we
 didn't realize he'd take it so literally," she replied, "or that he'd
 crash to earth quite so soon.  Tony was always a one, quite a sportsman
 - he captained the first fifteen at school - and dead keen to do his
 bit for King and country when war broke out, but...  I loved them both
 to bits, of course.  I still can't believe they're gone."

>inventory
 I was carrying a scrumpled fragment, a piece of paper, a receipt, a
 torch (providing light), a long wooden pole, a theatrical magazine, two
 keys (a dull grey key and a small brass key), a pair of headphones, a
 small tin box (which contained a pencil), a pamphlet, and a red book.
 I was wearing a beret and khaki battledress.

 "It seems I owe you an apology, Mr Percy," said Angela, lightly
 touching my arm.  "I really did think you must be the killer, but that
 radio - well, it does change things.  There's no way you could have put
 it there, which means - well, it seems you may have helped us catch a
 spy!  And - well, you obviously know that we haven't been entirely
 honest with you, don't you?"

>angela, give me the gun
 "Please, Jack, don't make this any harder for me by trying to avoid the
 question.  You know I've been lying to you, don't you?" she insisted.

>yes
 "Well, yes, I suppose so," I admitted.  "I mean it's pretty obvious
 that things here aren't what they're meant to seem."

 "Quite," she agreed, "For one thing, Colonel Croxley isn't my father,
 he's my C.O."  She flashed a brief apologetic smile before continuing,
 "I shouldn't really be telling you anything of course, and I still
 can't tell you much, but, well, let's just say the colonel and I both
 work for the War Office, and the man who was shot was working with us.
 And - well - oh golly, I wish this wasn't all so complicated, but
 perhaps you could just call me Angela from now on."  She handed me the
 revolver saying, "And perhaps you'd better take this.  To be honest,
 I'm not entirely comfortable with it."

>ask her about jeremy
 "So, is Jeremy really your brother?"  I asked.

 "That's right," she affirmed, "he's in the army too, and quite safe
 last time I heard, thank goodness!"

>ask her about graham
 "Who is Mr Graham exactly, and where does he fit into all this?"  I
 asked.

 Angela let out a heavy sigh, "I'm beginning to wonder myself," she
 muttered.  "I'm not meant to say anything, but right now I don't know
 which way to turn!  He's Captain Graham, from the War Office.  He came
 to warn us that our operation here had been compromised, and we were
 discussing what to do about it."

 (It occured to me to ask if she thought Graham shot the man.)

>check gun
 The word "check" is not necessary in this story.

>open gun
>examine gun
>examine gun
 I broke open the revolver and checked that it was loaded.  Finding that
 it was, I closed it again.

 It was a Colt 45, probably a service pistol. There was a distinct smell
 of cordite from the barrel.

 "Could this be significant?"  I asked, showing her the receipt.  "I
 found it under some sheets in the airing cupboard."

 "That's certainly an odd place for it," she remarked, "but I'm not sure
 what it means.  We all go into Amesbury from time to time, and any of
 us could have got a spare key cut, though it's a bit irregular - hm,
 I'm not sure what to think!"

>ask Angela about Dunbury
 My remark proved to be the occasion for an animated discussion which
 lasted quite some time.

>smell angela
 I smelled nothing out of the ordinary.

>inventory
 I was carrying a scrumpled fragment, a piece of paper, a receipt, a
 torch (providing light), a long wooden pole, a theatrical magazine, two
 keys (a dull grey key and a small brass key), a pair of headphones, a
 small tin box (which contained a pencil), a pamphlet, a red book, and a
 revolver.  I was wearing a beret and khaki battledress.

>show scrumpled to angela
 "What do you make of this?"  I asked, "I found it in Colonel Croxley's
 bathroom."

 Angela took the fragment, read it, and turned very white.

 "Oh goodness!" she declared.  "He couldn't have, could he?"

 She stared at the offending fragment a few moments more, then screwed
 it back up into a tight little ball.  "Let's not jump to conclusions,"
 she said, seemingly as much to herself as to me.

 Angela took the fragment, read it, and turned very white.

 She stared at the offending fragment a few moments more, then screwed
 it back up into a tight little ball.  "Let's not jump to conclusions,"
 she said, seemingly as much to herself as to me.

>examine scrumpled
 It was just a tiny fragment, still badly creased, with just a few words
 on it.

>ask angela about fragment
 "What do you make of this?"  I asked, "I found it in Colonel Croxley's
 bathroom."

 Angela took the fragment, read it, and turned very white.

 "Oh goodness!" she declared.  "He couldn't have, could he?"

 She stared at the offending fragment a few moments more, then screwed
 it back up into a tight little ball.  "Let's not jump to conclusions,"
 she said, seemingly as much to herself as to me.

>read it
 Only a few words were visible: "... plan now seems unworkable...
 ... may be advisable to terminate Durbury..."

>ask angela about durbury
>ask angela about piece
 That was not something she seemed at all eager to discuss, so my
 conversational gambit fell horribly flat.

 "This looks like it could be some kind of code," I remarked, showing
 her the piece of paper covered with letters and numbers.  "I found it
 in a German novel, in your room.  Perhaps the numbers are references to
 the pages in the book?"

 "No," she replied firmly.  For a moment she stared down at the piece of
 paper, clasping it in one hand, before finally releasing it to me with
 a heavy sigh.  "At least, it's nothing to do with the German novel,
 that's just something I happen to be reading," she told me, "but it is
 a code of sorts.  It's my attempt to do a bit of code-breaking.  That's
 part of my job."

>ask angela about goering room
 "So why do you keep a room dedicated to Hermann Goering in this house?"
 I enquired.

 "You already know enough to realize that it must be part of our
 intelligence operation," she replied.  "More than that I'm not at
 liberty to say."

>ask her about pamphlet
 I chattered away on the subject with her for several minutes.

>inventory
 I was carrying a piece of paper, a receipt, a torch (providing light),
 a long wooden pole, a theatrical magazine, two keys (a dull grey key
 and a small brass key), a pair of headphones, a small tin box (which
 contained a pencil), a pamphlet, a red book, and a revolver.  I was
 wearing a beret and khaki battledress.

 Angela turned to me, laying a hand on my arm.  "I'm getting to the
 point where I don't know which way to turn or who to trust," she
 confessed.  "I'm not meant to say anything at all, but what can I do?
 Well, I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know if I tell
 you that our visitor tonight wasn't a client!  He's Captain Graham,
 from the War Office.  He came to warn us that our operation here had
 been compromised, and we were discussing what to do about it.  And
 then, well..."

 (It occured to me to ask if she thought Graham shot the man.)

>ask her shot
 "Are you saying you think Captain Graham might have shot that poor
 fellow?"  I asked.

 "Yes - no - I don't know!" she ran her hand through her hair in a
 gesture of distracted distress.  "We didn't know about the radio.  At
 least I didn't.  But Captain Graham said the Germans had got wind of -
 well, we were discussing how to tidy up the mess."

 "And shooting that man could have been part of 'tidying up'?"  I
 suggested incredulously.

 "I don't know!" she snapped through gritted teeth.  "It's driving me
 half crazy just thinking about it!  It could have been Captain Graham -
 perhaps that's what he really left the study to do.  It could even have
 been the colonel.  I thought I knew him, and I didn't think he could -
 but it was his gun!"

>ask her about hilda
 "So, how do you find Hilda, Angela?"  I asked.

 "We get on well enough," she told me.  "She's certainly very
 efficient."

>tell her about hilda
 She'd already told me that she got on well enough with the housekeeper
 and found her very efficient.

>go down
 Angela followed me down the ladder.

 Upper Passage
 The standard of decoration was definitely plainer in this part of the
 house, little more than a stale lick of white paint on every available
 surface.  The door to the southwest marked the boundary between the
 servants' quarters and the rest of the house, while a second door led
 west, opposite a pair of cupboard doors to the east.  A ladder ran up
 from the floor through the open trapdoor in the ceiling, while a narrow
 flight of stairs led down to the floor below.

 On the shelves were a pair of folded white sheets.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Obvious exits: West, Southwest, Up, Down

>find coat

 Angela followed me down the back stairs.

 Back Passage
 The back passage was a short, narrow space leading from the kitchen
 door (to the south) to the back door (to the north) between two other
 doors to east and west.  The space was further constricted by a flight
 of stairs leading up to the floor above.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Maids' Parlour
 If the location of this modest-sized rectangular room had not in any
 case suggested that it was the maids' parlour, the mild shabbiness of
 its furnishings would probably have given the game away.  Now that the
 housekeeper was apparently the only member of domestic staff retained
 under conditions of wartime austerity, it apparently doubled as her
 workroom and sitting-room.  A battered arm chair nestled against a
 small, scratched wooden table in one corner, while an ironing board was
 set up near the middle of the room, strategically close to the
 fireplace.  The sole door out was to the east.

 On the peg was a dark coat.  On the ironing board was an iron.  On the
 small table was a wireless.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 The wireless was playing a Mozart symphony.

 Obvious exits: East

 I had arrived at the location of the dark coat.

>search pocket
 The coat pocket contained two keys (a chunky key and a small silver
 key).

 "I'm not sure you should be searching Hilda's pockets," Angela remarked
 censoriously, then added, "Did you find anything?"

>yes
 "Yes, a couple of keys," I replied.

 "Show me!" she demanded.

 The wireless continued to play Mozart.

>get keys
 I took two keys (the small silver key and the chunky key).

 Housekeeper's Bedroom
 The room was of a fairly generous size, and looked reasonably
 comfortable.  A single bed rested against the north wall, at the far
 end of the room from the only door, which led out to the east.  The
 other furniture consisted of a small upright wardrobe, a plain dressing
 table, and a low chest of drawers, all made of some dark wood and all
 of equally utilitarian appearance.

 I saw a small brown suitcase there.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Obvious exits: East

 I had arrived at the location of the small brown suitcase.

 "This is where Hilda sleeps," Angela informed me.

>unlock suitcase
 What do you want to unlock it with?

>show keys to angela
 small silver key: Angela glanced at the small silver key but offered no
 comment.

 dull grey key: Angela glanced at the dull grey key but offered no
 comment.

 chunky key: "That looks like the key to the cellar," Angela told me,
 "but what was it doing in Hilda's coat pocket?"

 small brass key: I showed Angela the brass key, saying, "I found this
 up in the attic, in the same box as the radio."

 "That's very odd!" she declared.  "It certainly shouldn't have been
 there!"

>unlock suitcase with silver key
 Unlocked.

>open suitcase
 Opening the small brown suitcase revealed some clothes.

 "What did you find in there?"  Angela asked eagerly.  "Not just
 clothes, surely?"

>search clothes
 Moving the clothes revealed a notebook that was hidden beneath.

>get notebook
 Taken.

>read it
 There was some faint indentations on the first page, suggesting that
 someone had written on a previous page and then torn it off, but the
 indentations were too faint to read.

>show notebook to angela
 "That's interesting," she remarked.  "Of course it could be completely
 innocent, but I'd like to see what it says.  We should try to find some
 way of making it legible."

>rub pencil on paper
 Which paper do you mean, the scrumpled fragment, the piece of paper, or
 the receipt?

>rub pencil on notebook
 (first taking the pencil from the small tin box)
 I rubbed the notebook with the pencil, so that the writing became
 visible.

 "Here, let me see that!" said Angela, peering over my shoulder.  "TOTEN
 SIE IHN SOFORT - that means 'Kill him immediately' doesn't it?  And
 that does look like Hilda's writing.  If it was a message she received
 over the radio, and if the 'him' referred to is ...  But look, there's
 another line of letters above.  I imagine that must mean that the
 message was sent in code and she had to decode it.  So where's her code
 book?  I mean, what we've found is certainly suspicious enough, but -
 well, before we start accusing Hilda I'd like to make absolutely sure,
 so I'd really like to find her code book, then we'd know."

>ask about corpse
 "The man who was shot, he really does bear a striking resemblance to
 Hermann Goering, doesn't he?"  I remarked.

 "Yes, he does," she agreed, "and that's all I'm saying, so please don't
 press me any further."

>ask her about house
 "I take it this place isn't your old family home, then," I remarked.

 "Obviously not," she concurred.  "It's just some place the War Office
 bought when it came on the market."

>ask her about bedroom
 I talked about this with her for a while, but failed to reach any very
 interesting conclusion.

>go east
 Not wanting either to be encumbered with other people's property, or to
 be caught stealing it, I dropped the clothes before leaving the room.

 Angela followed me through the door.

 Angela followed me up the ladder.

 Attic
 The attic had accumulated surprisingly little junk for a family home.
 Bare boards stretched out in every direction from the open hatch with
 little to clutter them.  The beam of my torch picked out hardly
 anything apart from the odd packing crate and a plethora of cobwebs.
 There was also a large wooden box in the corner by the window.

 The loose floorboard was scarcely noticeable, being nearly flush with
 the floor.

 I saw an old blanket there.  The large wooden box contained a radio.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Landing North
 The main landing comprised the area at the top of the stairs leading
 down to the floor below.  From there doors led off to east, west, north
 and northeast.  The landing continued to the south past the banisters.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Obvious exits: North, South, East, West, Northeast, Down

>go north
 Angela followed me through the north door.

 Master Bedroom
 This was obviously the master bedroom; it was huge.  Even with a large
 double bed and a heavy chest of drawers taking up much of the floor
 space, a great deal of bare carpet remained.  The door out was to the
 south, and a second door led west.

 On the chest of drawers was a family photo.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Angela glanced round anxiously, as if nervous about trespassing
 somewhere she had no right to be.

>ask angela about photo
 "So all those people in the photos in the drawing room," I began, "who
 are they?"

 "I don't know who the woman is," she admitted.  "Colonel Croxley just
 found that photograph somewhere.  His real wife is alive and well and
 living in Yorkshire, I believe, though she can't be seeing much of him
 right now, poor thing.  But the others are real people - I mean the boy
 in army uniform really was called Tony and he really was the colonel's
 son and he really was killed in action - as was Adam, my boyfriend, the
 pilot."

>look under bed
 I peered under the bed, but spotted nothing of interest.

 "You didn't find anything under there, then," Angela surmiseed.  It was
 clearly a statement, not a question.

>move chest
 I saw no need to start rearranging the furniture; it would probably
 have achieved nothing except annoying the Croxleys unnecessarily.

>look under chest
 I couldn't see anything under the chest of drawers.

 "We really must try to find that codebook, Jack" Angela insisted.
 "Hilda must have used something to decode that message, but I'd really
 like to see the proof!"

>open cabinet
 I saw no cabinet there.

>go south
 Angela followed me through the bedroom door.

>go east
 Angela followed me through the east door.

 Main Bathroom
 The bathroom was rectangular, and just a little dingy, with the white
 enamel bath tucked away in the corner occupying about a quarter of the
 floor-space.  Most of the rest was taken up with the basin and the
 toilet, with a mirror-fronted cabinet attached to one wall.  The
 bathroom door was to the west.

 A small book of some sort was lying on the ground just next to the
 toilet bowl.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Obvious exits: West

>examine book
 (the red book)
 It appeared to be a biography of Hermann Goering.

>get book
 I took the ration book.

>examine book
 Which book do you mean, the red book, or the ration book?

>ration
 It appeared to be a current ration book.

>read it
 Closer inspection revealed it to be the ration book for someone called
 Timothy Durbury.

>ask her about corpse
 She'd already agreed that the dead man looked a lot like Hermann
 Goering, but that was as much as she was saying.

>ask her about timothy
 I chattered away on the subject with her for several minutes.

>show ration book to angela
 "Look what I've found!"  I declared, "A ration book for Timothy
 Durbury!  I assume this belonged to that poor fellow downstairs."

 Angela hesitated for just a moment, then nodded.  "There's no point
 denying it, is there?" she replied.  "I'm sorry, I've had to live with
 pretence so long it's become a habit!  But yes, the man who was killed
 was Tim Durbury.  Poor Tim!"  She wiped the corner of her eye.

>open cabinet
 Opening the cabinet revealed a safety razor.

>examine razor
 It was a standard safety razor, with a short silver handle and a
 partially enclosed blade.

>ask angela about timothy
 "So who was Timothy Durbury?"  I asked.  "And what was he doing here?
 Why all the secrecy?  Why would anyone want to kill him?"

 "That's an awful lot of questions all at once," she replied with a wan
 smile, "but I suppose what's secret had better remain secret."

>take it
 The word "it" doesn't refer to anything right now.

>get razor
 Taken.

>open it
 That was not something I could open.

>go west
 Not wanting either to be encumbered with other people's property, or to
 be caught stealing it, I dropped the safety razor before leaving the
 room.

 Angela followed me through the door.

 The standard of decoration was definitely plainer in this part of the

 I had arrived at the back passage.

 Which key do you mean, the small silver key, the dull grey key, the
 chunky key, or the small brass key?

 Unlocked.

 Angela followed me through the east door.

 Cellar
 The beam of my torch picked out little but dust, junk and cobwebs
 before settling on the large empty wine rack running along the east
 wall.  A further clockwise movement of the beam located something
 untoward on the south wall.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Obvious exits: Up

>examine untoward
 The word 'untoward' is not necessary in this story.

>examine beam
>examine south
 I saw no beam there.

 There was a cable running down the south wall - but it looked as if it
 had been severed.

>examine cable
 The cable ran all the way down from the ceiling into some sort of
 junction box.  It looked as if it had been deliberately and cleanly
 cut; the shiny metal wire thereby revealed suggested that it might have
 been cut quite recently.

>talk about cable
 'Have a look at this, Angela,' I said, shining the torch at the severed
 cable.  'It looks like this cable has been cut.'

 'You're right, it does!' she agreed, peering at it closely.  'And
 there's something else - I think this is the cable for the telephone,
 so it wasn't the storm that put it out of action!'

>examine wine
 There was not a single bottle in sight.

>search rack
 At first sight the wine rack looked completely empty, but a thorough
 search revealed a brown paper bag half hidden in one of the
 compartments.

>get bag
 'What have you just found?'  Angela asked, as I removed the paper bag
 from the wine rack.  'Whatever it is was well hidden!  Who'd ever think
 of looking in an empty wine rack?  Anyway, what is it?'

>look in bag
 The brown paper bag contained a dark green book.

>read book
 Which book do you mean, the red book, the dark green book, or the
 ration book?

>read green book
 (first taking the dark green book from the brown paper bag)
 The inside of the book was full of columns of numbers and letters.

>connect wire

 I could not attach that to anything.

>connect cable

 I could not attach that to anything.

>fix cable

>fix cable
 I lacked the necessary equipment.

>give book to angela
 Which book do you mean, the dark green book, the red book, or the
 ration book?

>green
 She took the book from me, and studied it carefully.  'I'd say it was
 almost certainly a code book of some kind,' she told me, carefully
 turning over the pages.  'Almost certainly a German codebook of some
 kind,' she added.  'I imagine that's why it was hidden down here, so it
 wouldn't be immediately obvious whose it was.  I mean it would be
 pretty damning evidence if it turned up in anyone's things, but I
 suppose we now know whose it is anyway.'

 With a frown of concentration she then re-examined the writing revealed
 on the notebook.  'Yes,' she nodded, 'I think this was used to decode
 the message here.  So - we found the notebook in Hilda's room, and
 Hilda had the cellar key in her pocket, and the codebook was hidden in
 the cellar - I think we have enough now, don't you?'

>yes
 'Yes, I think we do,' I agreed.

 'Good, so let's go and show what we've got to Colonel Croxley,' she
 suggested.

>find colonel

 Angela followed me up the stairs.

 Back Passage
 The back passage was a short, narrow space leading from the kitchen
 door (to the south) to the back door (to the north) between two other

 Angela followed me through the kitchen door.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen looked large enough to accommodate the platoon of culinary
 staff who may have worked there before the war.  Circumstances were now
 reduced, however, leaving the place rather bare: a large wooden table
 at one end, with a single hard wooden chair right next to it, now
 comprised the bulk of the furniture.  A long, old-fashioned cooking
 range ran along the east wall, while doors led off to west, south and
 north, a calendar being attached to the last of these.

 Hilda was standing near one of the corners of the room.

 Angela stopped beside me.

 Colonel Croxley was sitting at the kitchen table, drinking a cup of
 tea.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West

 I had arrived at the location of Colonel Croxley.

 'Ah, there you are!'  Croxley declared.  'I wondered where you two had
 got to.  Did you find anything?'

 'Yes,' she replied.  'There was a radio in the attic, just as Mr Percy
 said.  We also found something else.'  Turning to me she added, 'Show
 Colonel Croxley the notebook.'

>show notebook to croxley
 (Colonel Croxley)
 I handed him the notebook, saying, 'We found this in Hilda's bedroom.'

 Croxley glanced at it and said, 'TOTEN SIE IHN SOFORT, in what looks to
 me, so far as I can tell from this, more than a little like Hilda's
 writing - well, we need hardly ask who she was being ordered to kill at
 once.'  Looking up at the housekeeper he went on, 'Is there anything
 you'd like to say about this, Hilda?'

 'You accuse me?' she asked incredulously, slowly backing away.  'Always
 they blame the Jews, always.  Why?'

 'There's more, Hilda,' Angela told her, 'the codebook you hid in the
 cellar, for example.'

 'You're no better than a Nazi!'  Hilda shrieked.  'You - how you say? -
 You plant evidence to make me in trouble.  Just because you are blonde
 and pretty-looking, Aryan girl, you think you can ...'  She broke off
 as she snatched a large kitchen knife out of a drawer and rushed
 towards Angela, brandishing her makeshift weapon.

>show it to him
 'Quick!  Do something, man!  Stop her!' he cried.

>hilda, stop
 I saw no hilda there.

>shelter angela
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>punch hilda
 I rushed towards Hilda.  She paused in her stride and turned to
 threaten me with her knife.  In the ensuing scuffle, the revolver went
 off, shooting Hilda through the heart.  She fell to the floor, leaving
 me gaping at her in horrified silence.

 It was Colonel Croxley who broke that terrible silence.  'Well, that's
 that, then!' he declared briskly, as if commenting on a broken teacup.
 'We really could have done with questioning her - but I suppose she
 realized that, as well as what we'd do to a spy in wartime.'  Turning
 to me he cut off my incipient apology adding, 'Don't blame yourself, Mr
 Percy, you did what you had to and I would have done exactly the same.'

 After a brief pause when nobody spoke he continued, 'This must all seem
 very strange, Mr Percy, so I suppose I owe you an explanation.'

 Angela threw Colonel Croxley a quick, anxious glance.

>listen
 I heard nothing out of the ordinary.

 'Mr Percy,' Colonel Croxley broke in on my thoughts, 'I think I'd
 better explain what's being on here, don't you?'

 Angela avoided my eye.

>yes
 'Yes; it's clear something very odd's going on,' I replied, still
 trying to recover from my shock at what had just happened.  'Please do
 enlighten me.'

 'Very well,' he nodded.  'First, as you may have gathered, neither this
 young lady nor myself are who we claimed to be.  I'm Colonel Martin,
 military intelligence, and Lieutenant Angela Dalton is my assistant.
 The man Hilda shot was an actor called Tim Durbury, who bears more than
 a passing resemblance to Reichsmarschall Goering.  The original idea
 was to see if we could train him to pass himself off as the real thing
 and maybe cause some havoc behind enemy lines.'

 He paused for a moment, then continued, 'Actually it became obvious
 almost from day one that the idea was a non-starter; poor old Durbury
 was never going to fool the Germans for five minutes.  If it hadn't
 been for Hilda we'd've packed up the whole operation weeks ago.'

 Angela stared at him in some consternation.  'But...' she began.

>wait
 I waited to see what would happen.

 'It was sheer luck that Hilda answered our advertisement for a native
 German-speaker who could pass as a housekeeper,' the colonel continued.
 'We already knew she was a spy, and it gave us a perfect chance to use
 her for our own purposes.  She thought we wanted her to help Durbury to
 learn German well enough to pass himself off as Goering - which was
 obviously never going to happen in reality.  Presumably she also
 thought we'd given her the ideal opportunity to spy on us and pass
 damaging information back to the Germans.  In fact, we were simply
 keeping her from doing any mischief elsewhere while using her to pass
 false information to her masters in Berlin.'

 At that point Angela's mouth dropped open in utter astonishment.

>wait
 I waited to see what would happen.

 Angela stared at Colonel Martin aghast.  'You never told me, sir!' she
 cried.

 'It was better you didn't know, lieutenant,' he replied evenly.
 'You're probably an even worse actor than poor old Durbury, and I
 needed you to be convincing.  In any case, the fewer people who knew
 what we were really up to the better.  Unfortunately we never reckoned
 with Hilda being ordered to kill Durbury, which I suppose must have
 happened shortly before you showed up, Mr Percy.  And now I have a
 request.  Obviously our little scheme has now gone a bit wrong, but
 it's still essential that none of this comes out.  Can I rely on your
 discretion?'

>yes
 'Yes, of course, sir,' I declared.

 'Good man,' Colonel Martin replied.  'Well, we'd better see what we can
 do to start clearing up this mess...'

 At that moment Captain Graham walked in, stopped in his stride at
 seeing the tableau presented, and remarked, 'What happened?  I thought
 I heard a shot!'

 'You did,' Colonel Martin told him calmly.  'Hilda's dead.  I'll fill
 in the details later.  Right now I think we'd better get Mr Percy out
 of here and on his way to his camp.  The storm seems to have abated, so
 perhaps you could give him a lift back to his car and help him get it
 started.'

 'Of course, sir,' Captain Graham nodded.  Turning to me he said, 'Lead
 on then, Mr Percy!'

 Captain Graham nodded towards the door.

>look
 Kitchen
 The kitchen looked large enough to accommodate the platoon of culinary
 staff who may have worked there before the war.  Circumstances were now
 reduced, however, leaving the place rather bare: a large wooden table
 at one end, with a single hard wooden chair right next to it, now
 comprised the bulk of the furniture.  A long, old-fashioned cooking
 range ran along the east wall, while doors led off to west, south and
 north, a calendar being attached to the last of these.

 A sharp knife lay on the floor, next to Hilda's body.

 Hilda's body lay sprawled on the floor.

 Captain Graham was standing by the door, waiting for me to lead the way
 out.

 Angela was standing on the far side of the kitchen, trying not to look
 at Hilda's body.

 Colonel Martin was standing there.

 Obvious exits: North, South, West

 Captain Graham held the door open, evidently anxious for me to leave.

>take knife
 'I think you'd better leave that alone for now, Mr Percy,' Colonel
 Martin told me.

 Captain Graham tried to wave me through the door.

 'Why?'  Angela asked suddenly.  'Why did she have to shoot Tim?  Why
 did they make her do that?  If they already knew about him, what harm
 could he do them?'

 'There was probably no good military reason at all,' Colonel Martin
 replied.  'I imagine it has more to do with wounded egos and Nazi
 spite.  I can just see the real Reichsmarschall Goering huffing and
 puffing and demanding the assassination of the upstart English actor
 who would dare to impersonate him.'

>wait
 I waited to see what would happen.

 Captain Graham gave a discreet cough.

>out
 I handed Colonel Martin back his revolver and walked out of the
 kitchen, closely followed by Captain Graham.  We reached the front door
 together without a word; it turned out to be unlocked, so I opened the
 door and Captain Graham followed me through.

 'At least it's stopped raining,' Graham remarked, as we stepped out
 into the drive, 'I understand you ran out of fuel?  I've a spare petrol
 can in the back, maybe we can get your car going again.'

 I glanced up at the sky, which was indeed beginning to clear, the storm
 having spent its fury.  For a moment I lingered in the drive, trying to
 come to terms with everything that had just taken place; then I
 clambered aboard and caught my last sight of Wendle Manor as Captain
 Graham turned his car round.  I didn't see Angela again until after the
 war - but that's another story.

 1.  Have you tried smiling, laughing and frowning at various points?

 the lounge.
