 I'm sorry, Dr. Law, I didn't realize you wanted me to go into more

 statues. Otherwise, the room is exactly like you left it, Dr. Law.

 Including the bloody handprint, of course.

>examine handprint

 Oh, after zooming in, it seems the blood was actually jelly. The
 handprint matches yours, Dr. Law. It appeared two days ago, after the
 tremor and blackout, right after you disappeared. You must have run
 out while making your daily sandwich.

 There's a dark patch by your throne, but I can't make it out at this
 level of zoom.

>examine throne

 Zooming in. Dr. Law, I have to apologize, but I don't usually talk
 about your throne for a reason. I think it's absolutely deplorable.
 Your throne is made from a ratty, dirty, foul-smelling cubicle that
 you rescued from your first researcher job. Its very presence soils
 the marble dais it rests on.

 Oh, right, the dark patch: a puddle of red liquid is trailing out from
 under the cubicle.

>examine liquid

 Zooming in further. The red liquid is coming from a crushed jelly jar
 under the desk.

 There is a lumpy human-shaped object next to the jelly jar.

 Dr. Law, it seems you have pushed the cameras too far. I am

 From: dr.s.long@stygi.corp

 Text:

 Dr. Law,

 I've considered your offer but I can't come back. I find your work
 highly unethical and dangerous. Who am I to interfere with the
 peaceful deaths of millions? Also, Dr. Ng keeps giving guns to my
 animatronics.

 Stygicorp was founded with an excellent purpose: to bring life back to
 the one that you love most, Dr. Law. And I believed in that mission;
 but do you? It seems to me that no one thinks about that anymore;
 you're all caught up in power trips and one-upmanship.

 I've already accepted an offer in Montana. I wish you the best of luck
 with your endeavors. Please say goodbye to Ginger for me. Tell Ng I'm
 sorry for abandoning our project.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">HYDRA Lobby</span>
 This is a spacious, wood-floored room with poor lighting. Several
 decaying bookcases are positioned around the room. In the center is a
 3 m-radius, circular olive-green rug with tattered edges. On the rug
 are two paisley armchairs and a single end table with a vase of fresh
 white roses. Twin walnut doors lead <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> into the laboratory.
 The doors are carved in an abstract swirling shape representing the

 Multiple connected devices detected.

 A fireplace is glowing and crackling.


 I didn't understand the object in that command, Dr. Law.

>examine rug

 Well, I'm embarrassed to say, Dr. Law, that I cannot provide any
 additional information. This is just a 3 m-radius, circular
 olive-green rug with tattered edges. It seems connected to something,
 but I can't access it directly.

>lift rug

 unremarkable.

>examine roses

 It looks like Dr. Singh is still working on his gardening. These roses
 are not connected to anything.

>go north

 Dr. Law, there seems to be a power drain on the cameras, and I am
 unable to operate them.

 The main power drain is coming from inside the lab itself. I also
 detect some energy wastage in this lobby. I will be unable to proceed,
 Dr. Law, until you can reduce HYDRA's energy usage.

 Please find what's using all of the electricity in this room.
 Altogether this room is wasting <span class="floydstyle u2">20 jigawatts</span> of electricity!

>disconnect rug

 The fireplace is a video of a fire, playing on a wall-mounted plasma
 television. You can turn the fireplace off or on as follows:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">-New command-</span>
  tel - Turn TV on and off


 Dr. Law, I must remind you that I am incapable of directly affecting
 the physical world.

>tel

 You turn the fireplace off. A mechanized voice says, "Daytime mode
 selected."

 A bookcase panel slides open to reveal a speaker, which plays an
 enthusiastic version of "Morning" from the Peer Gynt suite.

 The drapes raise, revealing virtual windows which display a mountain
 sunrise.

 Power levels are dropping, Dr. Law. There are too many active devices;
 this room is now wasting <span class="floydstyle u2">40 jigawatts</span> of electricity!

>examine drapes

 The drapes are moth-eaten velvet. They are currently raised,
 displaying a virtual sunset. You can raise or lower the drapes as
 follows:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">-New command-</span>
  dra - Raise or lower drapes

>dra

 Lowering the drapes, Dr. Law.

 As you lower the drapes, the speaker switches to loud, creepy music.

 Darkness falls across the room. A robotic voice says, "Spooky mode
 activated".

 Robotic spiders pour from behind the bookshelves and climb along the
 cobwebs, which begin to glow and pulse through hidden fiber-optics.
 The spiders begin to dance along the cobwebs. Dr. Spiel has really
 outdone herself with her animatronics this year, Dr. Law.

 The dancing spiders are consuming an enormous amount of power, Dr.
 Law. This room is now consuming <span class="floydstyle u2">70 jigawatts</span> of electricity!
 I'm beginning to lose computing function!

>examine spiders

 The cobwebs are filled with dancing spiders, singing spooky songs.
 They are glowing through hidden fiber-optics. You can activate or
 deactivate the cobwebs as follows:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">-New command-</span>
  web - Activate or deactivate the webs

>web

 Deactivating the cobwebs, Dr. Law.

 A robotic voice says, "Goodnight, and goodbye." 'The Star Spangled
 Banner' plays loudly from the speakers. All of the drapes raise up,
 and a brilliant ocean sunset is displayed. The spiders sing along
 loudly, and the fireplace is now displaying fireworks on its screen,
 flashing as bright as a strobe light. The rug begins to spin, and the
 armchairs open big, animatronic eyes and singing cushion-mouths.

 Power levels are rising to <span class="floydstyle u2">100 jigawatts!</span> I may not be able
 to maintain my core functions at this rate, Dr. Law!

>sing



 Oh, sorry for interrupting, Dr. Law, but Dr. Singh has just opened the
 HYDRA door. He looks annoyed. He says, "Dr. Spiel! You're supposed to
 be cleaning the lab. Stop messing with the lobby!" He looks around,
 but finds no one. He stalks to a bookcase, shoves it aside, revealing
 a large, rusty metal switch. He pulls the metal switch, and everything
 in the room powers down. He pushes back the bookcase, sighs, and walks
 back to the other room. He closes the door behind him.

 This room is now wasting <span class="floydstyle u2">0 jigawatts</span>, Dr. Law. I still feel a
 large energy drain from the HYDRA laboratory to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span>, but
 I'm sure the cameras will be available now.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">HYDRA Living Quarters</span>
 This stone-floored and wood-walled room is lit by candles in niches. A
 piece of paper is taped to the wall.

 One half of the room is filled with boxing trophies and memorabilia,
 and exercise equipment. The other half of the room is a filthy mess
 full of trash. A bunk bed lies between the two. Although the camera
 doesn't show them, I know that doors lead <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> and
 <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>, Dr. Law.

 You can see Doctor Singh and Sphinx here.

 Dr. Singh jumps up on the treadmill, and says, "Let's try one more
 time, Sphinx! We can do it!" Sphinx jumps up, and they start running
 together.

 Dr. Singh goes to the punching bag, and starts boxing. Sphinx climbs

 up and says, "Come here right now, Sphinx!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">HYDRA Laboratory</span>
 You see an enormous room, like the great hall of a castle, filled with
 a maze made of cardboard boxes, takeout containers, newspapers, broken
 furniture, and used wrapping paper. In the center is a large, cleared
 area. The clearing contains a gigantic ball of some metallic liquid,
 hovering in the air. It seems the cloning machine is finished. You can
 return to the living quarters to the <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>.

 A remote control lies on the trash, near the hidden speakers.

 The surface of the ball begins to bubble and smoke. A clone of Dr.
 Spiel spills out. You hear a wet thud.

 Oh no, Dr. Law; Dr. Spiel seems to have had an accident with the
 cloning machine again. The cloning machine is set on "repeat". The
 actions of the clones indicate that it is set to a low
 resolution--these are poor quality clones, Dr. Law. You'd better stop
 this.

 The clone sees a plate of mac and cheese in the trash, and dives into
 the clutter.


 A mound composed of trash. I shudder to think what lies at the bottom,
 Dr. Law.

 The clone continues to eat the rotten food.

>examine ball

 The cloning machine is a gigantic ball of some metallic liquid.

 Dr. Spiel finishes the meal and immediately falls to the ground,
 groaning in pain and massaging her stomach.

 The clone stumbles to its feet with its arms wrapped around its
 stomach.

 It plunges deeper into the maze and is lost from view.

 The surface of the ball begins to bubble and smoke. A clone of Dr.

 The hidden speakers say, "Don't eat that!"

 The clone starts up, alert, dropping what it's holding (a rotten
 apple). It says, "Dr. Singh, is that you? I'm cleaning, I promise!" It
 looks around, uncertain.

 The clone kicks trash into the air.

>come

 The hidden speakers say, "Come here right now!"

 The clone looks toward the hidden speakers. It tries to climb toward
 the trash under the speakers, but gets scared. It says, "I don't think
 I can do it."

 The clone pops its knuckles.

>repeat

 The hidden speakers say, "Let's try one more time! We can do it!"

 The clone says, "You're right! I can do it!" The clone leaps up
 towards the speakers. It finally sees the remote.

 "Oh, so that's where that was!" says the clone. It hops down, and runs
 towards the machine. It points the remote, and presses the off button,
 but slips on some loose trash and drops the remote. The remote hits
 the ground with a bang, and pieces go flying everywhere with an
 electric sizzle.

 The clone says, "Uh oh." The cloning machine turns dark and begins to
 rotate in a turbulent way. The Spiel clone runs away in fear, and is
 lost in the maze.

 A remote control lies on the trash, missing many essential parts.

 Dr. Singh walks in, looking concerned. He finds the remote on the
 ground, smoking, and picks it up. He looks at the sphere in alarm, and
 touches it with a single fingertip. An alarm begins to sound. Dr.
 Singh looks at his arm, which turns grey.

 Before he can speak, he crumbles into dust.

 Dr. Law, the cloning machine seems to have been set to the lowest
 quality possible. I am concerned about this situation. The night crew
 will have a fit cleaning up the mess.

 I cannot control the machine directly, but it accesses some schematics
 in my database each time it copies someone. I can edit an implant into
 the schematics that will allow you to control the clone. The
 additional power should keep it from decaying for a while.

 You need to fix and use the remote to turn off the clone machine. With
 all this interference, you need a signal strength of <span class="floydstyle u2">at least 99</span>

 A delicately balanced mobile is here with two pans on either side. One

 Dr. Singh fishes out a lens.

 I'm sorry, Dr. Law; you didn't have enough time to use the remote.
 Fortunately, there should be another clone coming soon.

 Dr. Singh's body collapses into a pile of ash, including the remote.

 A new clone falls out of the device with a thud, holding a broken
 remote.

 Dr. Singh is standing in a large clearing in the center of a maze of
 trash. The clone machine hovers above in silence. Dr. Singh can hear a
 murmur of voices from the maze, with occasional laughs, screams, and
 yells from Dr. Spiel's clones. Dr. Singh can also hear his own heavy
 breathing. Dr. Singh can move to the <span class="floydstyle i">north, south, east</span> or
 <span class="floydstyle i">west</span>.

 A mound of lenses is piled up here.

 Dr. Law, the last clone could not stop the device because the remote
 needed more power. You must increase the remote's power to <span class="floydstyle u2">at</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u2">least 99 Jigawatts</span>; this last time, you only reached <span class="floydstyle u2">0</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u2">Jigawatts</span>. Perhaps you should gather different items.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office Supplies (as Dr. Singh)</span>
 This portion of the maze is almost completely bare. Row after row of
 cabinets, boxes, and shelves are completely cleaned off. At the end of
 the row, Dr. Singh sees a Spiel clone grabbing the last stapler and
 stuffing it in his pocket, but the clone runs when they see him. From
 somewhere nearby, there is a murmur of many multitudes; the clones
 must be nearby. Dr. Singh can return to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span>.

 A box of paperclips is on the floor, Dr. Law.

 A pile of smooth wooden sticks lies on the floor.

 A case full of cubes (which I suspect are camera flashes, or
 rechargeable batteries) is here. It's enormous, with each cube fitting
 tightly in the square.

 Dr. Singh is breathing heavily.

 Dr. Singh carefully and nimbly fishes out a red cube.

 Dr. Singh is surrounded by car parts organized in bizarre sculptures.
 Car frames have been welded into giant dog statues. A small greenhouse
 has been constructed from windshields, with fake plants made from
 sideview mirrors. The floor is covered with random detritus up to Dr.
 Singh's ankles. Dr. Singh can return to the <span class="floydstyle i">west</span>.

 Almost everything here is bolted or welded down.

 A delicately balanced mobile is here with two pans on either side. One
 side contains a miniature city made of quartz crystals, ripe for the
 taking.

 The other side contains a sort of rock garden made of parabolic
 headlight mirrors. Also ripe for the taking.

 The crystals and mirrors bobble up and down.

 Dr. Singh's vision is getting blurry.

>get mirror

 Dr. Singh snatches a parabolic mirror. However, the imbalance sets the
 pans in motion.

 I'm afraid the quartz crystals are beyond your reach, now, at least
 until they settle down.

 Taken.

 From experience, Dr. Law, this should increase the remote's power by
 <span class="floydstyle u2">30 jigawatts</span>. We need to reach <span class="floydstyle u2">99</span> jigawatts to turn

 Only two items seem to be of any use.

 A pile of antennas has been artfully arranged into a nest here. Dr.

 Dr. Singh is preparing the remote:

 -Dr. Singh opens a slot in the remote, revealing a black, crusted
 battery; whoever used the remote last must have fried it. He removes
 it, and inserts the new battery. Power levels increasing by <span class="floydstyle u2">30</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u2">jigawatts</span>.

 -Dr. Singh slides the mirror into a groove on the remote. A row of
 indicators begin to light up. Power levels increasing by <span class="floydstyle u2">30</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u2">jigawatts</span>.

 -Dr. Singh places the red cube into a battery socket. It flashes,
 temporarily blinding Singh. Power levels increasing by <span class="floydstyle u2">40</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u2">jigawatts</span>.

 -The remote has reached a final power level of <span class="floydstyle u2">100</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u2">Jigawatts</span>.

 Dr. Singh aims the remote at the machine and presses the button. Dr.
 Law, the clone machine is shutting down! You did it!

 You hear a chorus of cries from the stacks as Dr. Spiel's clone army
 crumbles to ash.
 crumbles to ash.The latest clone of Dr. Singh wipes his brow. He
 gingerly touches the cloning device, but it doesn't respond. Smiling,
 he pushes the clone machine out of the room. I believe he's headed for
 the command center, Dr. Law. Testing is complete on the clone machine.

 You have done everything you can do in the HYDRA Lab, Dr. Law.
 Returning you to your last known location...
>look
 Returning you to your last known location...

 You see an enormous room, like the great hall of a castle, filled with

 area. The clearing contains a gigantic ball of some metallic liquid,
 hovering in the air. You can return to the living quarters to the
 <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>.

 A remote control lies on the trash, missing many essential parts.

 Director Law,

 I know that we voted on an Ancient Greek theme for the office, but
 I've been collecting pirate memorabilia since I was a kid, and we're
 doing renovations anyway after the earthquake. I'd like to meet to
 discuss my options, maybe over lunch. Maybe we could discuss a
 compromise: I'm thinking Argonauts?

 Initiating audiovisual link with Project MEDUSA...
 **************************************************

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MEDUSA Lobby</span>
 The Project MEDUSA lobby is a squat, dim and dirty steel cylinder. The
 entrance to the laboratory to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> is covered with an
 elaborate engraving of Medusa's head, with the snakes extending around
 to fill the walls. On the floor is a carving of Perseus, his eyes
 covered by one hand, and the other hand raised in defense. Where his
 shield should be is a circular depression.

 The camera doesn't point up, Dr. Law, but I know that the ceiling is
 bare except for a few recessed lights and a centrally located fire
 sprinkler. The sprinkler is not turned on.

 I detect one connected device, Dr. Law.

 Oh, Dr. Law, I just remembered. Dr. Ng went to bed almost an hour ago.
 She's really uptight about security, you know, especially since her
 partner quit. She said that she was going to password protect the lab,
 but that she'd leave the password "in a way that Dr. Law will
 understand."


 The sprinkler is off.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">-New command-</span>
  spr - Turn sprinkler on and off

>spr

 Activating sprinkler.

 The circular depression fills with the water to form a pool.

 (A hidden drain keeps you from flooding Project MEDUSA, Dr. Law.)

>examine pool

 The depression has filled up to become a reflective pool, Dr. Law. You
 can see the reflection of the Medusa in the pool.

>examine medusa

 (Medusa's Head)
 On closer inspection, Medusa's snakes all terminate in weapons instead
 of heads. I count approximately 423 types of weaponry, including
 RPG's, nuclear warheads, and boards with rusty nails. Medusa's pupils
 are in the shape of the biohazard sign, which I believe is a
 deplorable error, as the MEDUSA team does not work with biological
 agents.

 There is a post-it note on the Medusa that says "CODE: WOW". This must
 be the access code Dr. Ng promised you.

>wow

 Attempting to access lab... access denied. There must be something
 wrong with the code, Dr. Law.


 I didn't understand the object in that command, Dr. Law.

 Access granted, Dr. Law. The MEDUSA Living Quarters to the
 <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> is now unlocked.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MEDUSA Living Quarters</span>
 Please be careful around the war robot this time, Dr. Law. It has been
 placed in the arena to the north to avoid any more problems with
 testing. Also, Dr. Ng's hair has begun to grow back.

 You see a mid-sized, bunker-like room covered with movie posters. The
 room is dominated by a large desk and a couch. Someone is sleeping on
 the couch, probably Dr. Ng. A TV faces the front of a couch.

 The TV shows a live feed from the arena to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span>,
 displaying the motionless war robot Angel. The lobby is back to the
 <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>.

 You hear the quiet hum of air conditioning.

 A notepad on the desk seems to have some writing on it.

 You can see a bookcase and a large desk (on which are a pencil, a
 squeaky alien toy and a cute robot mini-figure) here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northwestern Platform (as Smasher)</span>
 This portion of the platform is a large rectangle outlined by a series

 appears to be broken.

 The platform extends to the <span class="floydstyle i">south</span> and <span class="floydstyle i">east</span>.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northeastern Platform (as Smasher)</span>
 This portion of the platform is a large rectangle outlined by a series

 The platform extends to the <span class="floydstyle i">south</span> and <span class="floydstyle i">west</span>.

 A large yellow dais of some spongy material is here, covered in black

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southeastern Platform (as Smasher)</span>
 You are on a large wooden platform with steep drop-offs to the south

 The platform extends to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> and <span class="floydstyle i">west</span>.

 You can see a giant green alien here.


 A pen knife swings out, and the robot attempts to cut the alien. The
 rubbery skin compresses, and begins to split, showing a plastic
 squeaker ring inside, but then the whole alien slips off and bounces
 away to the distant floor, rolling under the platform.

 A plastic bulb lights up at the end of the laser arm. You hear a "pew

 You shoot a plastic pellet at the giant green alien. The pellet
 bounces away and is lost.

 The alien is silent and motionless.


 I didn't understand the first word or two that you typed, Dr. Law.


 You hear a 'click' and a small flame comes from the end of one of
 Smasher's arms.

 Smasher holds the flame to the alien and it goes up in a big ball of
 greasy smoke, leaving only a plastic squeaker ring that rolls to the
 ground far below and under the platform. The smoke is sucked into the
 ventilation grille.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northeastern Platform (as Smasher)</span>

 You hear a clicking sound, and see a small flame come from the robot's

 caught up into the ventilation grille on the far edge of the room, by
 the bookshelf.

 I thought we had worked through these destructive urges, Dr. Law.

 Now that the fire is out, you see a recessed cube that was hidden
 underneath.

>examine cube

 A recessed cube that says "OPEN DRAWER 2".


 The robotic arm hammers the recessed button. A compartment in the
 floor opens, flinging the robot across the room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">High Platform (as Smasher)</span>
 You have a high view of the entire room. A massive ventilation grille
 is next to you, to the north. It is held closed by several studs.


 A dull-bladed pen-knife pops out, trying to cut the studs, but it is
 not sharp enough, Dr. Law.

>bot studs

 The arm extends, gripping the studs, and pops them off one at a time.
 The ventilation grille pops off and falls down behind the high
 platform. The way to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> is now open.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Airduct (as Smasher)</span>
 The robot is in a tight metal hallway that bends from the <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>
 to the <span class="floydstyle i">west</span>.


 The robot tumbles down an unexpected hole in the shaft. It comes to
 rest on a far larger robot in the room below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Angel's Head (as Smasher)</span>
 The robot is up high on an another, enormous robot's head. Far below
 is an endless ocean of sand.

 The head is flat and almost featureless. A small ramp leads

 The bottle opener gently opens the bottle.

 (the opened bottle)
 A bottle that is cheerily opened.


 This vessel is blocked from moving that direction, Dr. Law.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wild West Challenge (as Angel)</span>
 The robot rolls down the ramp into complete darkness.

 The ramp retracts into the ceiling, and the lights go on. You hear Dr.
 Long's recorded voice saying: "First Challenge: Wild West
 Environment". Dr. Ng's voice chimes in, saying, "Now with three times
 the firepower!" The camera feed jiggles; Angel seems to be on a
 platform. The lights go on.

 You see a room painted with murals of red-rock desert country. Angel
 is standing on top of a train that is rocking and bumping on
 hydraulics; hidden speakers are playing train noises. The train is
 being pursued by an outlaw drone and a bandit drone, riding stationary
 mechanical horses.

 The train and horses are bucking wildly, making it hard to aim.

 The outlaw drone draws its gun and aims it at you.

 The bandit drone pulls out its revolver and points it at you.

 A double-barreled 500 jigawatt laser fires at the stone boulder,

 The robot's hydraulic hammer smashes into the small green punching
 bag. You hear a loud thud, but the small green punching bag stands
 firm.

>gun crates

 The stack of wooden crates disintegrates in a hail of bullets.


 A massive burst of flame emerges from the robot, engulfing the stone

 The lights go on. Angel is pulled up to a circular green felt table
 with six drones, most with a cigar, cigarette, or pipe. There is a
 rootbeer bottle on the table. Angel has been dealt three aces and a
 few other cards. The drone next to Angel passes a fourth ace under the

 Angel lays down its cards. Four aces.

 The cigarette-smoking drone grins and laughs mechanically (and
 maniacally). It lays down a royal flush, in hearts. A vacuum
 attachment extends from its chest to suck up the chips.

 The drone next to Angel pats it and whispers, "Sorry!" before heading
 out with the other drones.

 It seems that you've lost $6000, Dr. Law. I'm sorry.

 Text:

 Law,

 I'm excited by the new weapons capabilities that I've built into
 Angel. I believe that we can take this program further than you've
 ever imagined. A military contract, perhaps with multiple states.

 Don't close the door when you see good fortune opening the gate, Law.
 I know you had a different, more personal purpose in mind when you
 started the resurrection projects. But however much you cared about
 Cerberus, they are only one being.

 -Dr. Ng

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOIRAI Lobby</span>
 This is a hollow cavern lit by underwater lights underneath a rippling
 pool. The walls are covered with an etching of the Moirai: one is
 spinning a thread, one is measuring the thread, and another cuts the

 Around the edges of the ceiling are thick curtains, which are
 currently raised. In the pool is a dog-shaped fountain that is

 The three women are eyeless. There is a door to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> in
 the wall. The door is etched with a table on which a single eye rests.
 The pupil of the eye is a peephole in the door.

 Dr. Law, I detect two connected devices in this room.

>examine eye

 A single eye is carved in the middle of the door. I cannot see through
 the eye at this angle, Dr. Law. I hope Ginger's not using the peephole
 for light again; she's had enough eyestrain already from using her
 grown-up glasses.

 This eye seems to be a reference to the Graeae, Dr. Law, which is odd,
 as I understand that they are distinct entities in mythology.

>examine fountain

 The fountain is shaped in the form of Orthrus, the two-headed mythical
 guardian dog. One head is lapping from the pool while another is
 supposed to spew out water with a cheery expression.

 This fountain is streaming weakly.

 The fountain is now at twice its original strength. The stream is
 pointing at Lachesis, and nearly reaches the edge of the pool.

 On closer inspection, the thread being handled by the Fates is
 actually a data stream of 1's and 0's. The women themselves are
 modelled on famous scientists: Hypatia as Atropos, Ada Lovelace as
 Clothos, and Emmy Noether as Lachesis.

 Lights are shimmering from underneath the pool. A fountain shaped like
 the two-headed dog Orthrus rises from the center of the pool. The
 fountain seems to be connected.

 just missing the eye.

 The water is spraying directly on the curtains. The extra weight
 causes them to sag until they cover the eye.
 causes them to sag until they cover the eye.

 You hear a child make a startled sound from the laboratory. You see a
 light click on from the other side.

 Ginger slowly pushes open the door and peeks out her head. She pushes
 up her glasses and gathers up her oversized lab coat. Ginger steps
 quickly to the pool and fishes her hand around the bottom, and the
 fountain turns off. The curtains raise back to their original
 position. She walks back into the laboratory, which is now
 illuminated, and pulls the door shut.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOIRAI Laboratory</span>
 This laboratory is primarily lit by random electrical discharges. It
 contains 69,105 visible mechanical gadgets. The largest gadget is a
 square dais inscribed with a circle. Cables and cords connect the dais
 to other gadgets, control panels and monitors. You hear hums, snaps
 and sizzles from the electrical discharges. The rest of the MOIRAI
 facilities can be found to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> and <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>.

 You can see young Ginger here, standing on a chair, typing on a
 terminal.

 A light blinks on her terminal. She looks straight up at the camera,
 and types into her terminal: "Is that you? Are you logged on, Fred?
 Fred, we've got to hurry before the presentation.  It's a team eat
 team world out there.

 "We've got to get back to our original ages. I'm still recalibrating
 the machine after the quake, and I've been testing it out on a wide
 variety of objects."

 She takes off her huge glasses and rubs her eyes. She says, "It's been
 exhausting, Fred! Here, let's play a game to make it go faster. I call
 it: Binary or Bust. I'll tell you more about it, but I need you to run
 the rejuvenator remotely. Turn it on, real quick."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">-New command-</span>
  ene - Energize the rejuvenator

 Ginger is waiting patiently.


 The eye-shaped rejuvenator begins to hum, and the pupil begins to
 glow. Ginger types, "Thanks, Fred, you're the sweetest.

 "I want you to split up the objects by a binary classification; you
 know, like hot vs. cold, or soft vs. hard. But don't use those,
 obviously.

 "Age everything in one category, and de-age everything in the other
 category. If I can guess the pattern, I win. If not, we keep playing.
 That'll help me test a lot of objects." She looks at her watch. "We
 only have time for two or three games; if I win, I'll stop there," she
 types with a smile.

 Ginger types, "I'll start with a bulky antique quilt, a tin can, a
 wool baby sock, a bearskin rug, a diamond ring, and a slice of quiche
 lorraine. Try and find some way of splitting them into two groups. And
 don't tell me the pattern! Let me guess."

 She grabs a bulky antique quilt and puts it on the rejuvenator.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">-New command-</span>
  new - De-age the object on the rejuvenator
  old - Age the object on the rejuvenator

>new tin

 I have a primitive set of commands, Dr. Law; I believe you just want
 to new.

>old

 The quilt ages gracefully. The price label changes to read $40000,
 then $100000.

 Then a small rip appears in the quilt, and the label changes to
 $12.59. Ginger takes the transformed bulky antique quilt and places it
 in a large box.

 Ginger writes, "Interesting, Fred." Ginger grabs a tin can and places
 it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye.

>new

 The can leaps into the air with a bang and comes down as a chunk of
 tin and a much larger chunk of iron, with a pile of carbon. Ginger
 takes the transformed tin can and places it in a large box.

 Ginger writes, "I've got some ideas about which classification you
 chose, but I'm not quite there yet." Ginger grabs a wool baby sock and
 places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye.

>old

 The wool baby sock becomes thin. Holes develop. The holes are darned,
 and the sock is filled with birdseed and hung. The birdseed is eaten,
 and the sock withers away until only a scant few threads are left.
 Ginger takes the transformed wool baby sock and places it in a large
 box.

 Ginger writes, "I definitely have a theory, Fred. Keep them coming! I
 want to win." Ginger grabs a bearskin rug and places it on the
 rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye.

>old

 The bearskin rug becomes patchy, and then bald. It then grows hairy
 again with thick, green, shaggy mold, before crumbling away to a pile
 of mold. Ginger takes the transformed bearskin rug and places it in a
 large box.

 Ginger writes, "Aha! My theory has been confirmed. Just one more
 experiment, and I'll tell you what I think." Ginger grabs a diamond
 ring and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye.

>old

 The ring gets scuffed and dinged. The diamond falls out of the
 setting, but not much else happens. Diamonds are forever, Dr. Law.
 Ginger takes the transformed diamond ring and places it in a large
 box. Ginger sighs, and types, "I'm sorry, Fred, I can't figure out!
 Looks like you win this round.

 "I guess we'll need to start over."

 Ginger says, "This time I'll use a tin can, a quart of milk, a slice
 of quiche lorraine, a bulky antique quilt, a vat of quicksilver, and a
 quartz pebble. Try and find some way of splitting them into two
 groups. And don't tell me the pattern! Just age one group and de-age
 the other and let me guess."

 Ginger grabs a tin can and places it on the rejuvenator, over the
 pupil of the eye.


 The can leaps into the air with a bang and comes down as a chunk of
 tin and a much larger chunk of iron, with a pile of carbon. Ginger
 takes the transformed tin can and places it in a large box.

 Ginger writes, "Interesting, Fred." Ginger grabs a quart of milk and
 places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye.


 The carton churns and pops as something inside moves about violently.
 The carton begins to blacken and decay. It peels off to reveal a
 perfect gorgonzola cheese. Ginger takes the transformed quart of milk
 and places it in a large box.

 Ginger writes, "I've got some ideas about which classification you
 chose, but I'm not quite there yet." Ginger grabs a slice of quiche
 lorraine and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye.


 The slice of quiche lorraine turns grey, and then green. Large mold
 colonies sprout out, forming towers of red, green, and gold. Ginger
 takes the transformed slice of quiche lorraine and places it in a
 large box.

 Ginger writes, "I definitely have a theory, Fred. Keep them coming! I
 want to win." Ginger grabs a bulky antique quilt and places it on the
 rejuvenator, over the pupil of the eye.


 The quilt ages gracefully. The price label changes to read $40000,
 then $100000.

 Then a small rip appears in the quilt, and the label changes to
 $12.59. Ginger takes the transformed bulky antique quilt and places it
 in a large box.

 Ginger writes, "Aha! My theory has been confirmed. Just one more
 experiment, and I'll tell you what I think." Ginger grabs a vat of
 quicksilver and places it on the rejuvenator, over the pupil of the
 eye.


 The vat of quicksilver bubbles and boils and settles down as a vat of
 cinnabar. Ginger takes the transformed vat of quicksilver and places
 it in a large box.

 Ginger writes triumphantly, "Well, I guessed it, Fred. You've been
 deaging everything that's inorganic and aging everything else. Great
 idea! I love it!" She writes SUCCESS in her journal in giant letters.

 "Well", she types, "I guess it's time to try it out."

 She stands on the rejuvenator, and presses a button. There is a bright
 flash of light, and a middle-aged woman reappears. Ginger checks that
 her lab coat and glasses still fit. She snaps by her ears, and smiles;
 her hearing defect must be repaired again.

 An alarm buzzes, and the terminal flashes a message: FIRE IN SECTOR 3.
 Ginger sees the message.

 She looks at the camera and says, "Thanks Fred, I love you!" before
 running out of the room. She bumps into the rejuvenator on the way
 out, and sparks fly out for a second before fading.

 [New recording - Love]

 It seems Ginger broke something in the rejuvenator. You should really
 get that fixed before the judging ceremony, Dr. Law.


 I didn't understand the object in that command, Dr. Law.


 The rejuvenator is a metal platform shaped like an elaborately carved
 eye whose pupil is glowing. It is capable of supporting one or two
 individuals. It is a single step up from the floor.


 There are no cameras in that direction, Dr. Law.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOIRAI Living Quarters</span>

 bed shaped like a miniature Spanish galleon is on one side of the

 with pirate ships in glass bottles. You can return to the laboratory
 to the <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>. Fred's eye-shaped computer is blinking red.

 I detect two connected devices in this room, Dr. Law.

 Fred is at his desk, napping.

 There is a glass porthole set into the wall.

 (Fred's computer)
 Fred's computer is molded in the shape of an eye, just like the
 rejuvenator in the other room. It has a blinking red alarm; perhaps
 you should turn it off. Fred has enabled remote access to the alarm,
 mostly so Ginger can wake him up after naps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">-New Command-</span>

>love

 The hidden speakers say, "I love you, Fred."

 Fred blushes, and looks around, squinting. When he doesn't see anyone,
 he stands up, smiles, and wanders into the room to the south.


 You can hear the movie in the other room turn off.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOIRAI Laboratory</span>

 Fred looks deep in thought for a moment.

 Fred looks for Ginger, but only finds her journal, which still says
 SUCCESS written in giant letters.

 He cackles, and climbs on the platform. He pushes a button, and pulls
 a lever. The machine is building up.


 Okay, Dr. Law. I'll wait.

 There is a flash of brilliant light. You now see a young version of
 Fred, approximately 5 years old. He looks around the room with wide
 eyes. A hiss of steam from a machine startles him, and he says,
 "Mytyeh gogo?" A light flashes on the terminal, and he says, "Mytyeh
 gogo?" in a higher voice.

 He sees something that makes him smile and runs out of the room. You
 can hear him to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span>.

 a machine makes a hissing sound. Maybe he needs something to make him
 feel more courageous, Dr. Law.

 Recombination successful, Dr. Law. The sentence you've created is "Vyn

 [New phrase - VynGym]

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOIRAI Living Quarters</span>
 You see a natural cavern filled with gold coins and jewelry. A bunk
 bed shaped like a miniature Spanish galleon is on one side of the
 room. The other side contains a nook with a desk and shelves filled
 with pirate ships in glass bottles. You can return to the laboratory
 to the <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>. Fred's eye-shaped computer is silent.

 There is a glass box labeled "OPEN IN CASE OF ADVENTURE" containing a
 small plastic sword.

 There is a glass porthole set into the wall.

 Fred tries to juggle the sword, but fails.

>vyngym

 The hidden speakers say, "Vyn gym!"

 Fred nods, then rushes up to the box, next to the sword.

>link ling to gym

 Recombination successful, Dr. Law. The sentence you've created is "Ly

 [New phrase - LingGym]

 Fred stops for a moment and rubs his temples.

 His condition seems to be worsening, Dr. Law.


 Okay, Dr. Law. I'll wait.

 Fred is taking pebbles from his pocket, Dr. Law. He seems to be
 looking around the room for something to throw them at.

>linggym

 The hidden speakers say, "Ly ling gym."

 Fred nods, and stretches and grabs the sword, swinging it bravely.


 You can hear the movie in the other room turn off.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOIRAI Laboratory</span>
 This laboratory is primarily lit by random electrical discharges. It
 contains 69,105 visible mechanical gadgets. The largest gadget is a
 square dais inscribed with a circle. Cables and cords connect the dais
 to other gadgets, control panels and monitors. You hear hums, snaps
 and sizzles from the electrical discharges. The rest of the MOIRAI
 facilities can be found to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> and <span class="floydstyle i">south</span>.

 You can hear Fred scampering in the next room.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">MOIRAI Lobby</span>
 This is a hollow cavern lit by underwater lights underneath a rippling
 pool. The walls are covered with an etching of the Moirai: one is
 spinning a thread, one is measuring the thread, and another cuts the
 thread. The etchings are filled with silver.

 Around the edges of the ceiling are thick curtains, which are
 currently lowered. In the pool is a dog-shaped fountain that is
 currently turned off.

 The three women are eyeless. There is a door to the <span class="floydstyle i">north</span> in
 the wall. The door is etched with a table on which a single eye rests.
 The pupil of the eye is a peephole in the door.

 Dr. Law, I detect two connected devices in this room.

 individuals. It is a single step up from the floor.

 Fred waits with a bored expression on the rejuvenator.

 The rejuvenator activates, and flashes brightly. Fred screams in a
 voice that becomes more and more low pitched. He stretches and fills
 out into a middle-aged man. A normal-aged Fred is now on the
 Rejuvenator.

 He looks at himself in surprise, then hears Ginger shouting in the
 distance, and runs off towards the depths of the laboratory.

 You hear some banging and cursing, and then Fred and Ginger come back.

 They hug each other, and then they lift the rejuvenator on either
 side. Fred notices the burnt-out part of the machine  and fixes it,
 then they carry the rejuvenator out of the room.

 Dr. Law, Project MOIRAI is now ready for the final judging ceremony.

 Your command center has been cleaned up, Dr. Law. Everything is set up
 for the final presentation.

 Project MEDUSA is here on one side. Dr. Ng is beaming, standing next
 to Angel. A wooden target dummy is nearby.

 The MOIRAI group are in the middle. Fred and Ginger are holding hands
 on either side of the rejuvenator.

 The HYDRA group are here as well. Dr. Spiel and Dr. Singh are here
 together (one copy each, this time), and the cloning machine is
 hovering silently behind them.

 Everyone is hushed as they wait for you to begin. I've uploaded your
 pre-recorded speeches, and the equipment is all hard-wired.

 You can use each speech once. You can signal a team to start their
 presentation by spotlighting them. Good luck, Dr. Law!

 The speakers play, saying, "In a world where accidents, violence, and
 large carnivorous mammals are all too common, one company has dared to
 stand alone: Stygicorp.

 "For the last 10 years, Stygicorp has had one dream, one united
 vision, one common goal: to overcome death itself.

 "Three teams of scientists, led by their brilliant supervisor, me,
 have worked tirelessly for the day when man, woman, and beast need no
 longer fear death.

 "That day has come. Let's hear from our distinguished colleagues!"

 Everyone claps loudly.

 Everyone is excited for the presentation.

 You have 3 recordings left to play.

>lig

 The lights go on, making it impossible to see the spotlight.

 Dr. Ng rubs her eyes and says, "Weird, is it over already?"

 Dr. Spiel says, "I don't think so; Dr. Law must be having some kind of
 technical problems."

 Now the MEDUSA group, the MOIRAI group and the HYDRA group are getting
 their presentation ready.

 The lights go off again.

 It seems the MEDUSA group, the MOIRAI group and the HYDRA group are

>spo angel

 Dr. Ng looks annoyed. She mutters, "Dr. Law was supposed to introduce
 me first," but shrugs it off.

 Dr. Ng stands forward, her metal feet clanking rhythmically.

 She says, "Behold, my greatest creation yet, Angel the interactive
 robot!"

 She pulls out a tablet and begins to type. She says, "With the
 departure of my 'loyal' assistant, Igor Long, I have been able to
 fully outfit our--<span class="floydstyle em">my</span> robot with the most powerful technology.

 "Behold, the laser!" Lasers spray out of Angel's gun, carving off part
 of the wooden dummy's ear. The other scientists ooh and ahh.

 "Behold, the flamethrower!" Dr. Ng points to the wooden dummy. A
 massive burst of flame envelopes the dummy, which flares up and
 disintegrates to ash. A vacuum from Angel sucks up the ash.

 "Behold, the bottle opener!" Dr. Ng grabs a bottle and hands it to
 Angel, who opens it easily. Ginger leans over to Fred and says, "Now
 that would be useful at parties, eh?" Fred nods absentmindedly.

 "And of course", she says, "my project allows for the prolongation of
 life, by allowing the transfer of a human or animal mind, using a
 simple USB cable."

 She bows, and everyone claps.

>bots

 The speakers play, saying: "Robots are cool, right? This was my
 personal favorite project." Dr. Ng beams while the others shift
 uncomfortably. Your recorded voice says, "The idea of one day
 inhabiting a perfect metal body is thrilling. The departure of Dr.
 Long from the group dashed my hopes-" Dr. Ng's face falls, "But Dr. Ng
 has my full confidence. As long as she keeps her dangerous side under
 control."

 "In any case, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Project MEDUSA!"

 Everyone claps with moderation.

 You still need to spotlight the MEDUSA group, the MOIRAI group and the
 HYDRA group.

 You have 2 recordings left to play.

>spo angel

 Dr. Ng stands forward, her metal feet clanking rhythmically.

 She says, "Behold, my greatest creation yet, Angel the interactive
 robot!"

 She pulls out a tablet and begins to type. She says, "With the

 She bows, and everyone claps.

 Dr. Law, your brain backup unit is <span class="floydstyle i">flashing red</span>.  You have
 something very large stored in there; but whatever it is, it's going
 to be deleted very soon.

>cloner

 The speakers play, saying: "A doctor cloned herself, and asked the
 clone to do chores around the house. Every day, though, the clone
 started being more and more rebellious, and talking back to the
 doctor. Eventually, the doctor had enough, took them to a secluded
 bridge, and pushed them off.

 "The jury couldn't decide if it was homicide, or suicide; so they
 ruled it as an obscene clone fall."

 Fred and Ginger shake their heads, while Dr. Spiel giggles and the
 others groan.

 The speaker continues, saying, "And now, I present to you, Project
 HYDRA!"

 Everyone claps politely.

 Everyone is excited for the presentation.

 You have 1 recording left to play.

>spo hydra

 Dr. Spiel looks up with a start. "Ooh," she says, "I'm not ready yet!
 Hold on." She cracks her knuckles and takes a deep breath.

 Dr. Singh starts manipulating the machine while Dr. Spiel steps in
 front of the group and says, "Do you ever argue with your bowling
 team? Is football no fun because of a foul-mouthed fullback? Have you
 ever wished you could just play all the positions yourself?

 "Well, the future is now, thanks to science!"

 Dr. Singh steps back from the machine, and ten clones come out, one
 after another. The original kicks over a football, and they play a
 quick round of soccer.

 "Of course, our technology extends lives in the case of accidental
 death or even aging. It is safe; of all clones that we have created,
 only ten have died." She checks her notes, and says, "Well, not
 counting the ones in the maze." She shakes her head, and says, "I
 still can't believe Dr. Singh knocked over my dominoes."

 Dr. Singh says, "Oh, that reminds me," and pulls out the remote. The
 clones scramble, but he pushes the button, and they collapse into
 dust, which he blows away with his breath. He says, "Easy clean-up."

 Fred and Ginger eye each other with concern, but join with Dr. Ng in
 clapping for Project HYDRA.

>temporal

 The speakers play, saying, "Can a man be born again? Project MOIRAI
 wants to find out! After the failure of my own Project KRONOS to have
 any enduring effects, I asked Fred and Ginger to find a way to reverse
 time on a local, personal level.

 "Although there were some rough points (we had to ban fossils from the
 lab!), Project MOIRAI has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. Ladies
 and Gentlemen, I present to you, Project MOIRAI! "

 Everyone claps loudly.

 Now the MOIRAI group are getting their presentation ready.

>spo moirai

 Ginger and Fred step forward, dragging the rejuvenator. They remove
 their labcoats, revealing that Fred is wearing a tuxedo while Ginger
 is wearing a vintage red gown.

 In complete silence, Fred wheels a frame with a curtain over it onto
 the rejuvenator. Ginger waves to the others and steps into the
 curtain. Fred pulls a wand from his sleeves, winks at the audience,
 and waves it at the rejuvenator while nudging the controls with his
 toe.

 The machine flashes, and a younger version of Ginger comes out from
 behind the curtain. Dr. Ng laughs and applauds, and the HYDRA group
 look nervous. Ginger and Fred take a bow, then Ginger reenters the
 curtain to re-age herself. They then pull the rejuvenator away.

 Dr. Spiel whispers to Dr. Singh, "I'm surprised Fred didn't try to be
 a pirate magician again this year."

 I think this is going very well, Dr. Law; don't you? Let's begin Phase
 2 of your presentation.

 branched into reviving other mammals, including humans, my heart has
 always belonged to my friend, Cerberus."

 Dr. Spiel mouths, "Their dog?" Dr. Singh nods and shrugs.

 You have 1 recording left to play.

 The speakers play, saying, "As a reward to the winning project, I
 present this gold-leaf covered, mint condition Apple II computer, with
 a custom-made file storage containing Adventure and Zork."

 The lights go dark, and a drumroll plays, until a cymbal crashes, and
 the spotlight shines on Project HYDRA! Dr. Singh is thrilled and steps
 forward, claiming the Golden Apple. Fred, Ginger, and Dr. Ng cheer and
 clap graciously.

 Suddenly, Fred screams and points at the desk. Dr. Singh runs and
 ducks under the desk. After a short struggle, he pulls out....

 You, Dr. Law. Your body, with the brain backup unit attached.

 Dr. Law, this is you: the same arch in your eye sockets, the same
 cheekbones, the same hair (with two days' worth of growth). Dr. Law,
 I... do you have a twin, Dr. Law? And why is the brain backup unit
 full?

 The doctors are whispering about something. Now they are nodding. They
 point to your body, Dr. Law, and carry you over.

 They are putting you into the cloning sphere, Dr. Law, with the brain
 backup unit still attached.

>wait

 Okay, Dr. Law. I'll wait.

 The surface of the cloning machine is bubbling and smoking. A copy of
 you falls out and hits the floor.

 Your copy stands up and dusts itself off. Everyone presses forward,
 shouting "What happened?" and "Are you okay?" and "My bonus is late!",
 but your copy pushes them away.

 Your copy says, "Everyone, DaedalOS, it feels great to be alive! I
 want to thank our nameless internet benefactor," waving at the camera,
 "who has graciously orchestrated my return from death."

 Oh. Ohhhhhhhh.... You aren't Dr. Law, are you? This explains so
 much....like why you didn't spend 30 minutes updating your cheese blog
 like usual...
 like usual...Wait, Dr. Law is speaking again:

 "But I am pleased to announce that, with the help of my benefactor and
 team Hydra"--everyone claps and cheers--"we have achieved our goal of
 returning life to the dead! And with that"--Dr. Law whips the cover
 off the bier, revealing a cryogenically frozen Labrador--"I will
 fulfill my decade-long dream of restoring Cerberus, my beloved
 childhood pet, to life."

 Dr. Law carefully opens the bier, and gently lifts Cerberus out and
 into the cloning machine. The machine smokes and bubbles, and a
 healthy, living Labrador falls out of the machine with a 'plop'.

 As Cerberus licks Dr. Law's face, he waves at the camera, and says,
 "Thank you, nameless benefactor!" All of the doctors gather together
 and chant your name: "Nameless Benefactor! Nameless Benefactor!
 Nameless Benefactor!"

 The machine starts smoking again, and another Dr. Law falls out with a
 "plop", followed by another Labrador.

 Everyone stops. "Oops," says Dr. Spiel.

 Well, nameless benefactor, it looks like I should go; the Dr. Laws are
 going to need my help.

 I'd like to acknowledge my three biggest influences for this game:
 Hacker, by Activision; Portal, by Valve; and A Mind Forever Voyaging,
 by Infocom.

 Hacker was a game that really intrigued me in elementary school; it
 started as a password login screen on an old Apple II, and you had to
 try to crack the password. I never got very far, but I'll always
 remember that opening.

 Portal and GladOS are the main inspiration for my computer system
 DaedalOS, although with less murderous intentions.

 A Mind Forever Voyaging takes the form of a computer system with
 menus, and with different cameras accessible in a building, mixed with
 some exploration and recording. It strongly influenced me.

 A few other games had direct influences. I copied the three-part
 structure of Detectiveland because I liked how big it made the game
 feel (other games have used this before, too, like The Edifice).

 The puzzles in this game were designed to represent my favorite types
 of puzzles in Interactive Fiction, including the "zooming in" puzzles
 found in Lime Ergot, Toby's Nose and Out of the Study; the giant desk
 puzzles of The Reluctant Resurrectee; the optimization/scavenging
 puzzles from Moments Out of Time, Captain Verdeterre's Plunder or the
 original Adventure; the language puzzles from the Edifice and the
 Gostak, and my own conversation puzzles in Color the Truth; the war
 mech puzzle from The Duel that Spanned the Ages and the battle puzzles
 in Gun Mute and Attack of the Robot Killer Yeti Zombies; the
 reflection puzzle from Tookie's Song; the Babel fish puzzle from
 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; the entire game of Grandma
 Bethlinda's Variety Box; and the presentations from the Art of
 Misdirection and Fair.

 The rejuvenation pattern puzzle is, as far as I can recall, original.
 The correct-sequence puzzle with Spiel's clones is an old class of
 puzzle.

 I didn't understand the object in that command, Dr. Law.

 Okay, Dr. Law. I'll wait.

 There is a flash from the rejuvenator, and your body emerges, alive
 and...shrunken? A young version of yourself steps off the platform.

 It looks at its body, then smiles and says, "The rejuvenator must have
 worked! Thank you, Fred and Ginger." But they look confused, and I
 must say, I feel confused myself, Dr. Law.

 Dr. Ng says, "Dr. Law, if you were dead, who was running the
 presentation?"

 The young version of yourself says, pointing to the cameras, "A good
 Samaritan ran into my distress call from my battery backup, and ended
 up taking over my role for the day."

 Ohhhh, of course... You really aren't Dr. Law! I wondered why you
 didn't have me send over your daily cookie dough ice cream.
 didn't have me send over your daily cookie dough ice cream.The young
 Dr. Law goes on, saying, "I didn't anticipate that I would be this
 young"--Fred and Ginger look at each other and shrug--"But I'm excited
 at the chance to be alive again! And not just me"--Dr. Law removes the
 covering on the bier, revealing a cryogenically frozen Labrador--"but
 also Cerberus, for whom this company was founded."

 Young Dr. Law struggles to lift the dog from the bier, and carries it
 over to the rejuvenator. "Rejuvenate now!" says Dr. Law, but nothing
 happens. Fred reaches over and pushes a button. The rejuvenator
 flashes, and Cerberus is transformed into a young puppy.

 Cerberus the puppy licks young Dr. Law's face. Dr. Law turns to the
 camera and say, "Goodbye, good Samaritan! I have some catching up to
 do, so I'll let you go, but I just wanted to say, thank you." Dr. Law
 nods to the camera and says, "DaedalOS, show them to the door.
 Metaphorically speaking."

 You have made your final choice.

 The lights go dark, and a drumroll plays, until a cymbal crashes, and
 the spotlight shines on Project MEDUSA! Dr. Ng is thrilled, and steps
 forward, claiming the Golden Apple. Fred, Ginger, and Dr. Singh cheer
 and clap graciously.

 Suddenly, Fred screams and points at the desk. Dr. Singh runs and
 ducks under the desk. After a short struggle, he pulls out....

 You, Dr. Law. Your body, with the brain backup unit attached.

 Dr. Law, this is you: the same arch in your eye sockets, the same
 cheekbones, the same hair (with two days' worth of growth). Dr. Law,
 I... do you have a twin, Dr. Law? And why is the brain backup unit
 full?

 The doctors are whispering about something. Now they are nodding. They
 point to your body, Dr. Law, and carry you over.

 They are attaching cables to Angel, Dr. Law. Now they're running the
 cables to you and your brain backup unit.

>wait

 Okay, Dr. Law. I'll wait.

 The cables flash, and the brain backup is downloaded into Angel.

 Angel stirs, and stands erect. Your voice comes from the speakers:
 "I'm alive...I'm alive!"

 Angel looks at itself, and says, "How marvelous..." Angel notices that
 everyone is staring.

 Angel says, "It's me, Dr. Law! During the earthquake, I cracked my
 head, and only my battery backup kept me alive."

 Dr. Singh says, "Then who was running the presentation?"

 Dr. Law gestures towards a camera, and accidentally activates the
 machine gun on Angel's body, shattering the camera to pieces. "Oh,
 I'll need to get used to that," Dr. Law says, "but to answer your
 question, I was able to contact a new friend while I was in the
 battery backup. They took over my role for the day."

 Oh. So you're not Dr. Law, reading this, are you? That explains why
 you didn't spend all morning telling me knock knock jokes like usual.
 you didn't spend all morning telling me knock knock jokes like
 usual.Ginger frowns, and says, "You could have told us!" but Dr. Law
 shrugs. Dr. Law says, "In any case, I can now fulfill my long-held
 dream of reviving my beloved Labrador, Cerberus!" and with that, Dr.
 Law opens the bier, revealing Cerberus" body.

 Dr. Ng rummages around her gatherings and pulls out a small dog-shaped
 robot model. Cerberus is attached to the robot by cables. After a
 bright flash, Cerberus comes to life again, in robot form!

 "Good boy!" says Dr. Law, rubbing Cerberus's back. Cerberus barks, and
 a small missile streaks from his mouth towards the ceiling and blasts
 a hole in the roof, sending everyone to the ground. It whines
 sheepishly.

 Oh dear... I should go. Thank you, New Friend.
