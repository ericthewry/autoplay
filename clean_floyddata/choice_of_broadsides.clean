>load broadsides


 "Fire the starboard broadside!" shouts the Captain.

 Cannons roar as H.M.S. Courageous attacks the enemy frigate.  As one of
 the junior officers--really, more of an officer in training--you
 command three guns on Courageous's main gun deck.  The guns of the
 battery next to yours fire, leaping back against the heavy ropes that
 prevent them from smashing across the ship. Clouds of white smoke
 billow about you as you give your gun crew the commands to ready your
 battery's cannons:  "Swab!  Powder!  Wadding!  Shot!  Run out the
 guns!"

 The Captain yells out, "Fire as the guns bear!"  You give your gun
 crews orders to load and fire as quickly as they can, without waiting
 for the rest of the broadside.

 They swab out the bore, push in a charge of powder, push wadding down
 on the powder, load the shot, push the gun out through the gunport, and
 fire the cannon, with you commanding each step of the process.  "Swab,
 powder, wadding, shot, fire!  Swab, powder, wadding, shot--"

 The world turns upside down as the enemy's broadside rips through the
 hull some ten feet away.

>go
 As the enemy cannonball tears through the side of the ship, giant
 splinters of wood fly through the air. One of the splinters, perhaps a
 yard long, rips through the stomach of Davies, a sailor under your
 command.  A fragment of a cannon ball smashes Fisher's arm, mangling it
 horribly.  Your sailors seem stunned by the carnage, standing in shock
 while Davies and Fisher scream in agony.

 What do you do?

 A: Attend to the wounded personally--the safety of my sailors is my top
 concern.
 B: Give some quick orders for them to be taken to the surgeon in the
 cockpit, then turn back to my duty in commanding the guns.
 C: With a gut wound like that, Davies is done for, but Fisher can still
 be saved.  I order some sailors to take Fisher to the cockpit but leave
 Davies on the deck to die.  I need the extra sailors to use the guns
 effectively.
 D: My duty to the ship outweighs my duty to two sailors.  I ignore the
 wounded and concentrate on firing my guns as quickly and accurately as
 I can.

>b
 you expectantly.  "Take a team of sailors and get Davies and Fisher to
 the surgeon."

 Your gun crew leaps into action and carries the wounded away.  Their
 screams continue to echo, but you do your best to put them out of your
 mind and focus on the battle.

>go
 We should take a moment here to establish a few important facts about
 you.

 In this game, you take the role of a young officer in the Royal Navy of
 "Albion" (an imaginary nation rather like England) fighting battles at
 sea with "Gaul" in the time of the Napoleonic wars.

 But you're not just any young officer.  Nobody knows it yet, but you're
 going to be one of the most famous officers in all of Albion.  The
 "Naval Chronicle" will publish stories about you; sailors will tell
 tall tales of your adventures; one day, if you're lucky, people will
 write histories about you.

 Why?  What makes you so notable?

 A: My skill in sailing ships.
 B: My combat ability, both commanding the guns of a ship and with
 pistol and sword.
 C: My leadership--people instinctively follow me.
 D: My high birth gives me strong patronage that will ensure that I
 quickly rise to high command.

>go down
 both throughout the Royal Navy and even in Parliament itself.  You can
 always expect the best assignments and the most opportunity.

 What's your second most notable quality as a young officer?

 A: My skill in sailing ships.
 B: My combat ability, both commanding the guns of a ship and with
 pistol and sword.
 C: My leadership--people instinctively follow me.

>b
 with your skill in battle.

 That tells us what you're good at, but you can't be perfect.  What's
 your greatest weakness as an officer?

 A: My skill in sailing ships.
 B: My leadership--I have trouble getting people to obey me.

>a
 the sailing master and master's mates are for?


 Do you lead by knowing the correct action or by reading the people
 around you?  Do you sail based on knowledge of technique and expertise,
 or through an able reliance on your sailors?  In short, would you say
 that you are characterized more by your intelligence or by your ability
 to make people like you?

 A: Definitely my intelligence.
 B: Mostly my intelligence, but I'm also likeable.
 C: A little of each.
 D: Mostly my skills with people, but also my intelligence.
 E: Overwhelmingly my skills with people.

>go east
 strain your weaknesses, and pursue strategies that play to your
 strengths.

>go
 This game is set in a fictional world, similar to our own but with some
 differences.

 For example, perhaps the ships are crewed by women.  You are a young
 and gallant officer, but are you a young gentleman or a young lady?

 A: I'm a young gentleman, of course, and rather confused by the
 question.
 B: I'm a young lady.  The idea of gentlemen going to sea and being
 exposed to the horrors of combat--it's a frankly revolting idea.

>a
 all men.  Let's move on.

 You are about nineteen years old now.  When did you first go to sea as
 a Midshipman?

 A: When I was 3
 B: When I was 10
 C: When I was 13
 D: When I was 16

 We'll need to know your surname.

 A: Leighton-Pierce
 B: Villiers

 With that out of the way, let's get back to the battle.  You've dealt
 with the injured, in a fashion.  Now, you need to keep firing your
 guns.  But in the midst of all the excitement. . . what's the next
 step?

 of the ship, you shout, "Fire!"  One of the ratings touches the fuse to
 the powder, and the gun leaps back with a roar.  You were correct and
 kept your gun firing as quickly as possible.  Your able performance has
 helped your ship win the battle.

>go
 The battle rages on, but finally the Gaulish ship hauls down its colors
 and surrenders.

 In the aftermath of the battle, a young midshipman runs up to you.
 "Captain's compliments, sir, and he asks you to report to the
 quarterdeck."

 When you get to the quarterdeck, the Captain looks over at you.  "Mr.
 Rockersuke!  I'm rating you as an acting-lieutenant.  Take a section of
 twenty men across to the prize and assume command.  Make any necessary
 repairs and set sail for any Albionish port."

 "Aye aye, sir! Thank you, sir!"  You quickly gather your men and head
 across on your first command.

>go
 As you prepare to leave Courageous, you run into Mr. Bryce, the second
 lieutenant.

 "Well, well, well!  'Acting-Lieutenant' Rockersuke!" he says, grinning
 widely and slapping you on the back.  "I know you'll do smashingly with
 your first command; I have the utmost confidence in you!"

 "Thank you, sir," you reply, touching your hat in salute.

 Just at that moment, first lieutenant Pigot rounds the corner.  "Mr.
 Rockersuke," he remarks, somewhat stiffly. "Fine piece of luck you've
 had."

 Pigot, with over twenty-five years experience, is by far the most
 senior lieutenant on board--perhaps in the whole fleet--but it's not to
 his credit. He's too incompetent to earn a promotion to commander; he's
 watched countless younger, more competent lieutenants pass him by,
 while he racks up years of "valuable experience."  All he has to show
 for it is the power to boss the other lieutenants around imperiously,
 and he rarely misses an opportunity.

 "Luck has not a bit to do with it, I say!" Bryce counters cheerfully.
 "Well, go on then! Don't want to keep the prize waiting!"

 "Aye aye, sir!"

>go
 You make your way across to the prize ship with your detachment of 20
 men.  You are the only officer, but you have Jones, a master's mate,
 with you as your second-in-command.  The Gaulish ship is a 36-gun
 frigate--a square-rigged three-masted ship with an ordinary crew
 complement of some 250 men.  Your detachment of 20 will be sufficient
 to sail the prize, of course.  Warships carry much larger crews than
 similarly sized merchant ships because of the need to staff the
 broadsides, as well as to have men available for detached duties such
 as prize crews.  And, of course, the larger crew size allows for a
 substantial number of casualties before the ship is incapacitated.

 The long and the short of it is that you can fairly easily sail the
 frigate, but your prisoners outnumber you roughly 10 to 1, even taking
 into account the substantial losses they took before striking their
 colors.  As you arrive, you quickly send some of your men to bring the
 prisoners below and to lock them in the hold, where they will spend the
 rest of the voyage.

>go
 A Gaulish officer, no more than a few years older than yourself,
 approaches you and offers his sword in surrender.  He addresses you in
 Gaulish.

 Given your social class, your tutors taught you Gaulish as a matter of
 course.  You understand him perfectly, and can reply with an almost
 native accent if you choose.

 "I believe you are the officer of the prize party, sir?" he says.

 Do you deign to respond to him in Gaulish?

 A: Yes, anything else would be churlish and unworthy of a gentleman.
 B: Yes.  He may not understand my language and it will be useful to
 open communication with him.
 C: No.  I may have the opportunity to overhear useful information if
 the prisoners do not know I speak their language.
 D: No.  We defeated them, and we will make them behave on our terms.

>a

 "I am Lieutenant Villeneuve of the Gaulish Republican Navy.  During the
 battle, the more senior lieutenants were all killed, and the Captain
 suffered a wound that incapacitated him shortly after we struck our
 colors.  I am now the senior active officer of this ship."

 "I understand, sir," you reply.  "You understand that we now command
 this prize?"

 He nods.  "Alas, I do.  I offer you my parole, sir."  With that,
 Villeneuve has promised not to seek to escape, and not to interfere in
 your efforts to steer the ship.

 Do you accept Lieutenant Villeneuve's parole?

 A: Of course!  He is a gentleman and would never think of breaking his
 word.
 B: I suppose.  He's probably less dangerous after giving his parole
 than in the hold trying to escape.  I'm not returning his sword,
 though.
 C: Normally, I would, but given how few men I have, I cannot afford to.
 D: He is a captive and one of the enemy.  Into the hold with him!

>go down
 other, your rank notwithstanding."

 He looks frankly shocked.  "But. . . but we are both gentlemen. . .
 Our militaries have always accepted the parole of opposing officers!"

 "Jones!" you call to your master's mate.  "Take this Gaul below and
 lock him in the hold with the rest of the enemy."

 "Aye aye, sir!" responds Jones, with more than a little vicious
 enthusiasm.

 Jones smiles as he returns to the deck.  "The Gaulish officer is in the
 hold, sir.  It's nice to know that after all the suffering they put us
 through--and the deaths of good men like Davies--that they'll get a
 taste of suffering on the way back to Albion.  It can't be too nice
 being cooped up in that hold without any daylight.  I reckon it will
 take us a week or two to make it back to Albion."

>go
 A few days later, one of you crew passes the word that Lieutenant
 Villeneuve has a question for you.

 "Sir," he inquires, "may we have access to some additional medical
 supplies?  A member of our crew has suffered a compound fracture;
 without further attention, he may die."

 A: Provide medical supplies.
 B: Deny medical supplies.

>a

>go
 The next several days pass smoothly.  You get used to the routine of
 the passing watches, even with the new experience of commanding the
 prize ship.  The process of trimming the sails, taking your bearings,
 and setting the course is nerve-wracking--never before have your
 decisions been the final word, leading a ship either on a safe and
 direct course to your destination or towards disaster.  But the weather
 is blessedly easy, with a steady breeze but clear skies, and you go
 through the process, relying on your training and your experience.

 On the fifth day, Jones comes to you with a disturbing piece of news.
 "I've found something below deck that I need to bring to your
 attention, sir."

 "What is it, Jones?"

 "We're taking in water in the hold.  We'd missed the hole at first
 because it's beneath the waterline."

 Sure enough, he's right.  You order your crew to start pumping out the
 water; with Jones's help, you manage to patch the hole in time to
 prevent any further damage to the ship.

 Why do you think Jones pointed out the damage to you?

 A: He did it out of duty.
 B: He did it to get on my good side.
 C: He did it to save his own neck.

>c

>go
 On the sixth day, one of your men calls down to the deck.  "Sail to
 lee!"

 "What sort of ship is it?" you call back, as you search with your
 spyglass.

 After a minute, the sailor calls back, "She looks to be a Gaulish
 sloop-of-war, sir."

 A sloop-of-war. . . That presents you with a difficult choice.  A sloop
 carries no more than 20 guns, and often fewer.  What's more, a sloop's
 guns will be of lighter weight than those of a frigate.  If you had a
 full crew, you could easily capture her.  But with only a prize crew at
 your disposal, the sloop would have a much greater rate of fire and
 substantially larger number of men.

 How do you want to handle this?

 A: Engage the enemy sloop directly.
 B: Attempt to capture the enemy sloop through a clever ambush.
 C: Avoid the enemy sloop--it's not worth risking the more valuable
 prize in a battle that would likely go badly.

>c
 that you are not sailing like a Royal Navy frigate would.  He claws his
 way towards you, tacking and taking advantage of a sloop's generally
 better  maneuverability.  Your only real advantage is a higher speed
 running before the wind, but running before the wind takes you ever
 closer to the enemy.  You haven't the skill at sailing to avoid him.
 There is no choice for it--you will have to fight to defend your prize.

 As your ship and the sloop close with each other, you time the order to
 open fire with the guns carefully.  Your small crew has had the time to
 load the entire starboard broadside once, one cannon at a time, but you
 know that they will not have that luxury again.  You have no choice but
 to endure some long range cannon fire from the sloop--since you will
 only have one opportunity, you need to make the most of it.

 Finally, you decide that the moment is right.  You bring the ship
 around in a tight turn, presenting the starboard broadside directly
 towards the enemy sloop.  You run from gun to gun, giving the order to
 fire each one as it bears on the enemy sloop.

>go
 As the cloud of smoke from your broadside clears, you can see that the
 Gaulish sloop is damaged, but not badly.  The sloop answers your
 broadside with one of its own--its guns are light, but splinters still
 kill three of your men.  The enemy captain seems to have understood the
 situation and maneuvers to board your prize ship.

 Now for the moment of truth:  Do you rally your crew for a desperate
 melee, hoping to somehow prevail despite being badly outnumbered, do
 you strike your colors and surrender, or do you try to flee despite
 having brought your ship deep within the enemy's range?

 A: We will never surrender while we still live!
 B: We did our best, but now we have no choice but to surrender.
 C: Escape is our only hope!  Make all sail!

>a
 that they are unwilling to fight (and likely to die) against
 overwhelming odds.  As the Gaulish boarders cross over from their sloop
 to your prize ship, you fight them almost alone. You charge at the
 enemy swinging your sword, but you are quickly surrounded.  Despite
 your best efforts, they knock your sword aside and stab you, driving
 you to the deck. After you fall, your surviving men promptly throw down
 their weapons.  You survive, although it is a close thing, and some
 months before you recover fully.  The Gaulish have recaptured your
 prize, and your first command has ended in failure.

>go
 You spend the next several years in a Gaulish prison.  You are not
 mistreated, precisely, but it's still a terrible experience.  Finally,
 after years of waiting, you and your men are exchanged for some Gaulish
 prisoners.

 You finally return to H.M.S. Courageous, only to discover that the
 Captain has removed your status as an acting-lieutenant for failing to
 deliver the prize safely home.  You resume service as a midshipman.

>go
 You return to your duties as a midshipman on H.M.S. Courageous.  The
 days pass much as before.  You study under the ship's master, you run
 errands for the officers, and you command your small section of men in
 routine tasks.  As a year passes, you have the opportunity to practice
 various skills that you expect to be tested on in the lieutenant
 examination. Which of your skills do you devote the most effort to
 training?

 A: Sailing.
 B: Gunnery.
 C: Fighting with sword and pistol.
 D: Leading the men of the ship.
 E: Currying favor with my superiors.

>a

>go
 Finally, it is time for your lieutenant examination.  You dress in your
 finest uniform and head over to a ship of the line, H.M.S. Dreadnought,
 where a board of captains has convened to examine a plethora of
 acting-lieutenants and midshipmen on the finer points of naval skill.
 Those who pass are promoted to lieutenant.  Those who fail must spend
 at least another year at sea before trying again.

 After an interminable wait, your name is called and you present
 yourself to the trio of captains.  They take a perfunctory look at your
 papers and then launch into the examination.

 Captain Fitzroy--a middle-aged captain with a particularly hard cast to
 his face--begins questioning you on gunnery.  "How many ounces of
 powder should be loaded into a long 8?"

 You immediately rattle off the correct answer.

 The examination continues, and your answers continue to please the
 captains.  After a relatively short examination, they confer privately
 and then inform you that you have passed the examination.
 Congratulations!  You are now a lieutenant. Your responsibilities as a
 lieutenant are much greater, and your duties have changed
 significantly.  Where previously you were often on deck as an assistant
 for the officer of the watch, you now take your turns as an officer of
 the watch.  Your duties studying under the ship's master have
 completely ended. And where you previously commanded a small group of
 guns, you now command a broadside.

>go
 "Ten minutes before eight bells, sir," the quartermaster reports.  A
 steady breeze pulls your ship inevitably west, bound for Kingsport.

 "Very good," you say.  "Pipe the watch below."

 The first lieutenant, Mr. Pigot, arrives promptly to relieve you of
 your dog watch.

 "I relieve you, Mr. Rockersuke."

 "Aye aye, sir. I stand relieved.  Good night, sir."

 "Good night, Mr. Rockersuke."

 Not long after, you find yourself lying in your cot, drifting off to
 sleep.  Soon, you begin to dream.

>go
 You find yourself sitting for your lieutenant's examination.  Three
 gigantic captains are looking down at you with terrible grins, larger
 than life.

 "Good day, Mr. Rockersuke.  My first question to you is as follows.
 You are in temporary command of a 36-gun ship, returning to Albion with
 maximum haste.  The wind is with you, and you are at full sail.  The
 barometer reports a sudden drop in pressure.  What do you do next?"

 A: I don't know the answer! I'm going to fail the exam!
 B: Stammer and stall for time.
 C: Make something up.
 D: Admit that I don't know.

>b
 Any officer would know that a sudden drop in pressure indicates the
 arrival of a major storm! By the time you'd reef the sails, you'd
 probably lose a mast!"

 "Here is your next question," the second captain says.

 "You are in temporary command of a 36-gun ship, returning to Albion
 with maximum haste.  The wind is with you, and you are at full sail.
 The barometer reports a sudden drop in pressure.  What do you do next?"

 A: Didn't you just ask me this question?
 B: A strong wind is coming. Let out more sail to pick up speed.
 C: Cut holes in the sail to maintain speed through the weather.
 D: We're about to be calmed.  Prepare oars for rowing.
 E: Oh no!  All of these answers are incorrect!

>c
 most novice seaman would know that a drop in barometric pressure means
 an oncoming squall!  You should have chosen to furl the sail!"

 "This is your final question," the third captain says, disapprovingly.

 "You are in temporary command of a 36-gun ship, returning to Albion
 with maximum haste.  The wind is with you, and you are at full sail.
 The barometer reports a sudden drop in pressure.  What do you do next?"

 A: A storm is coming.  Furl the sail to avoid disaster.
 B: A storm is coming.  Furl the sail to avoid disaster.
 C: A storm is coming.  Furl the sail to avoid disaster.
 D: A storm is coming.  Furl the sail to avoid disaster.

>c
 examination.  This is the worst performance I have ever seen in an
 acting-lieutenant.  Furthermore, it is the unanimous agreement of the
 examination board that you shall be disrated and pressed into service
 as an ordinary sailor.  Good day, 'Mister' Rockersuke!"

 You awake with a start.

>go
 Drowsily, you can hear Pigot call the watch; it's midnight.  The ship
 is heaving erratically.  As you yawn deeply, your ears pop.  The
 pressure has changed.

 A: Fall back asleep.
 B: Send word above deck.
 C: Go above deck.

>c
 things are already going to hell.  Last night's steady breeze has
 become a gale; you feel the mist of rain on your cheek.

 "Mr. Rockersuke," says Pigot, greeting you formally.  It's hard to see
 clearly, but you think you can spy Jones up in the riggings, along with
 two other men.

 A: Tell Pigot to furl the sail.
 B: Politely bring up the weather and ask what he suggests.
 C: Go back to bed.

>a
 commanding officer.  This violates every protocol of the Royal Navy!

 A: To hell with protocol! He could get us all killed!
 B: Firmly insist that he furl the sail.
 C: Politely bring up the weather and ask what he suggests.

>b

 "I've already got the men furling the sail! What do you take me for?"

 Just at that moment, Captain Kent appears from his cabin.  "Captain on
 deck!" yells Pigot.

 Just then, Jones falls from the riggings of the mizzen mast.  Another
 sailor reaches out to catch him; the wind shrieks and the ship groans
 and leans precipitously.  You hear a pop as someone's arm dislocates.
 Before anyone can say a word, both sailors have fallen to the deck, one
 of them killed instantly on impact.

 The Captain takes over from here.

>go
 After breakfast, all the officers of the ship gather together in the
 Captain's cabin.

 Pigot takes a moment to turn to you and hiss, "What were you trying to
 do last night--make it seem to everyone that I don't know my job?
 You'll pay for your insolence."

 You have no opportunity to defend yourself before the Captain calls for
 everyone's attention.

 "My question for you, Mr. Pigot," the Captain says, "is: why were there
 still men on the riggings when the storm arrived?"

 "I could see from on deck that Master's Mate Jones hadn't reefed the
 sail correctly," replies Pigot, "so I ordered the men to return aloft
 to secure it properly."

 The Captain counters, "Jones says that you gave the order to reef the
 sail too late, and that he and Wilson were already under heavy
 weather."

 "With all due respect, sir, Jones is an insubordinate and unskilled
 master's mate.  I'm not surprised he has invented an excuse.  I gave
 the order when it was needed."

 A: Support Jones.
 B: Support Pigot.
 C: Stay out of it.

>a

 "Certainly," Pigot replies nervously.

 "The storm arrived quickly, as you said.  How and when did you know
 that the sails needed to be reefed?"

 "Mr. Rockersuke, you must be quite inexperienced to have to ask such a
 question.  I knew the sails had to be reefed immediately when the wind
 picked up and the rain set in."

 "And not when the barometric pressure dropped?" asks the Captain.

 There is a brief silence, as everyone in the room realizes that Pigot
 has just admitted to a serious blunder.  He turns red with rage and
 embarrassment.

 "I gave the order at the right time!" he insists, banging his fist on
 the table.  "I demand that Jones be flogged for his error reefing the
 sails."

 "I'm sure he did the best he could, under the circumstances," you
 suggest.

 "But his best was simply not good enough, and now two men are dead."
 The Captain is silent for a moment, then says,  "Mr. Pigot, I will not
 mention you by name in my report on this to the Admiralty, but I will
 remember this as I prepare future reports.  As for Jones, the bosun
 will administer twenty lashes under Mr. Pigot's supervision."

 Bryce pipes up, "Jones is still under the care of Dr. Miller."

 "Very well; his punishment will be postponed until such time as Dr.
 Miller agrees to allow it.  You are dismissed."

 Once you're both out of earshot, Pigot leans in to whisper to you:
 "Mark my words, Rockersuke: your career in the Navy is well and truly
 finished!"

>go
 As soon as he's able to walk, Jones is laid out for twenty lashes.
 Pigot has the bosun beat him as hard as he can; he's immediately
 returned to the surgeon's care.

 Later that night, a midshipman wakes you from very deep sleep.

 "Mr. Pigot's compliments, sir, and he's passing the word for you."

 Because he is senior to you, you have no choice but to report when he
 sends for you. You stagger out of bed, quickly pull on your uniform,
 and make your way to the deck, where Mr. Pigot awaits you with a nasty
 smile.

 "Mr. Rockersuke, did the weather change at all during your watch?"

 "Yes, sir," you reply, as clearly as you are able, "the wind changed
 twice during the evening.  At the end of my watch the wind was
 favorable."

 "Very well.  You are dismissed."

 What an odd question.  Couldn't he have gathered this information from
 the log?

>go
 You find that you're a bit tired the following day.  You find it
 difficult to avoid yawning disrespectfully, but you're in the Royal
 Navy; you can manage it.

>go
 But two days later, Pigot wakes you up again, in the middle of your
 sleep cycle.

 "How many times did you throw the chip log to measure speed?" he asks.

 "Uh, three times, sir," you slur.

 "Come again, Mr. Rockersuke?"

 "Sir, I said three times."

 "I see.  Mr. Rockersuke, in my opinion, you appear to be inebriated
 with rum."

 "Sir, no sir." It's almost three bells; you're exhausted, but you're
 not drunk.

 "Well, I'll see to it that this won't happen again.  You're not to have
 another drop of rum until my order, is that clear?"

 "Aye aye, sir."

 "You are dismissed, Mr. Rockersuke."

 Pigot wakes you again three days later, to ask whether the Captain gave
 you any standing orders that he should be aware of as the next
 watchstanding officer.

 And again two days after that.

>go
 Mr. Pigot wakes you at least once every two or three days for the next
 three weeks; sometimes he takes the opportunity to lecture for an hour
 on the importance of respect and good discipline on a ship. He's doing
 everything in his authority to make your life hell.

 The following evening, you catch yourself nearly falling asleep on
 duty--an offense punishable by death.

 A: Try to apologize to Pigot.
 B: Ask Mr. Bryce what to do about this.
 C: Complain directly to the Captain.
 D: Tough it out.

>go down
 afternoon, you catch yourself dozing during duty.  It couldn't have
 been more than a few seconds; no one appears to have noticed this time.

>go
 As you head below deck, you see a handful of sailors whispering
 together.  As soon as they catch sight of you, they stop abruptly and
 go their separate ways.

 What do you think they're whispering about?

 A: It's harmless gossip.
 B: They're planning a mutiny.

>b

 A: Loudly ask what they were whispering about.
 B: Pull one of them aside to ask what they were whispering about.
 C: Tell someone about the whispering.
 D: Do nothing.

>b

 You move a little closer to your cabin.  "What was that little
 gathering about?"

 "With all due respect, sir, I don't think you want to know."

 A: Swear to secrecy.
 B: I don't think I want to know.
 C: Threaten Allen.

>a
 emphasizes the word "sir" oddly.

 A: I don't think I want to know.
 B: Threaten Allen

>a

 "Aye, sir.  Aye aye, sir."

 Are you really going to ignore a potentially murderous mutinous
 assembly? Why?

 A: It might not really be a mutiny.
 B: If one of my superior officers dies, I'll advance in the ranks.
 C: The hierarchy on this ship is fundamentally unjust.

>a

>go
 A few days later, another major storm hits.  At almost four bells, you
 find yourself wide awake, entirely against your will.  Unable to return
 to sleep, you pull on your uniform and go above deck for some fresh
 air.

 On deck, you encounter a most unusual sight.  The sky is pouring icy
 rain.  Mr. Pigot is wrestling with two sailors on the edge of the deck.
 They are trying to push him overboard; they are trying to murder him.

 Another sailor is on deck, watching the fight, but not involved.
 You're pretty sure he hasn't noticed you yet.

 A: Save Pigot's life.
 B: Return below deck for some much-needed sleep.

>b

 How do you feel about Pigot's death?

 A: Saddened.
 B: Frightened.
 C: Angry.
 D: Relieved.
 E: Happy.
 F: Nothing.

>go down
 Rockersuke, do you really think it was an accident?"

 A: "Yes, I'm sure it was an accident."
 B: "No, I don't think it was an accident."

>a
 normal--running much more smoothly under Bryce's hand than under
 Pigot's. Months pass.

>go
 The tropical sun is hot even through your hat, and it glares painfully
 off the water. Through your stinging eyes, you can see looming up ahead
 the cliffs of a little island--a tiny place, uninhabited according to
 the charts. About halfway between the prow of Courageous and the
 island, the sea is marked by the white canvas sail of a Gaulish
 merchant ship--streaking towards the island as fast as she can go,
 running desperately away from Courageous's pursuit.

 "More sail!" the Captain commands.

 Immediately the men jump to obey, feet pounding on the deck and shouts
 echoing from the rigging. Canvas snaps and billows overheard.

 But you can tell it isn't enough. The little Gaulish ship is faster
 under the light wind, and has too great a head start.

>go
 "I do not think we can catch her," you say quietly to Bryce.

 "We must catch her," Bryce replies, "before she gets much nearer shore.
 We can't manuever Courageous in those shallow waters--"

 And, indeed, before very long the Captain is forced to call off
 pursuit, citing just that reason. Courageous stays a safe distance out,
 in deep water. You and many others stare resentfully at the escaped
 prize--nestled against shore in the company of another Gaulish merchant
 vessel, one that was already there. The Gauls must use this island
 often for resupply.

 "Mr. Bryce! Mr. Rockersuke!" the Captain's voice cuts through your
 reverie. "In my cabin, if you please!"

>go
 "We can hold them pinned here indefinitely," the Captain says, "but we
 can't get close enough to engage them directly. Which means a
 cutting-out expedition is called for."  A group of men will be sent to
 approach the merchant ships in the dead of night, board them secretly,
 take them over, and sail them away from the island as prizes.

 "There are two ships, so our force will be divided in two. Mr. Bryce,
 you will command one half; Mr. Rockersuke, you will command the other.
 Expect that each enemy ship has a complement of thirty men. You will
 each have forty under your command."

 Few lieutenants get such a chance to prove their capabilities. If you
 are able to pull this off, it will be a significant boost to your
 career.

 So how are you feeling about this?

 A: Thrilled. I have been waiting for this sort of opportunity for a
 while now. I have no doubt at all I will succeed brilliantly and
 impress the Captain.
 B: Determined. This is going to be difficult, but I will give it
 everything I have and hope that is enough.
 C: Terrified. If I am NOT able to pull this off, it could represent a
 signficant setback to my career! Isn't that just like the Navy, to put
 you into positions where there is only a tiny chance of success, and
 then punish you for failure? I wish the Captain had chosen someone
 else.

>b

 You give serious thought to how you will organize your men, and then
 you go to brief the ones who have been assigned to you. They consist of
 two midshipmen and forty sailors.

 "We will take two boats," you explain. "I shall command one, with Mr.
 Midshipman Stuart to assist me. Mr. Midshipman Mason will command the
 other. My boat shall come along the starboard side of the Gaulish
 vessel, and Mr. Midshipman Mason's along the port side. We will climb
 aboard secretly, and then attack from two sides with plenty of shouting
 to frighten the spineless Gaulish boys."

 The men grin.

 You pause. You know that one of the three officers must be made
 responsible for cutting the anchor cable, so that your men will be able
 to sail the Gaulish ship out to where H.M.S. Courageous waits. Another
 must be responsible for ascending the rigging and loosing the topsail
 to get the ship underway. And a third must be responsible for taking
 over the steering of the ship. There are three officers available--you
 and the two midshipmen. Which job do you want for yourself?

 A: Cutting the cable is the most important job. It will have to be done
 while hand-to-hand fighting is still raging on the deck. I will take
 responsibility for it myself.
 B: Ascending the rigging to loose the topsail is both important and
 dangerous. It will require iron nerves and great agility to climb to
 that unsteady height in the dark while fighting rages on the deck
 below. I will take responsibility for it myself.
 C: Steering the captured prize back to Courageous is the proper job for
 the officer in command. I will take responsibility for it myself.

 Gaulish ship from its mooring," you continue. "Mr. Midshipman Mason,
 you shall ascend the rigging and loose the topsail, to set the ship in
 motion."

 Mason pales slightly, but nods.

 "Mr. Midshipman Stuart, it shall be your task to make your way directly
 to the wheel, and steer the prize out of harbor once we have taken
 her."

 "Aye aye, sir," Stuart says crisply.

 "Now, you men--you'll each be provided with a pistol and a cutlass. We
 will leave at four bells--you will be roused."

 Before dismissing them, you think over the plan--is there anything else
 you need to say?

>go
 No, you can't think of anything. "Dismissed!" you say.

 The next few hours pass nervously, as you go over your plan again and
 again. Finally, four bells sounds, and you hasten to the deck to take
 command of your party. Along the way, you encounter Bryce, who seems a
 little nervous too. "All set, Mr. Rockersuke?" he asks.

 "Yes, sir, Mr. Bryce," you say.

 "You've set someone to climb the rigging and loose the topsail, right?
 And someone to cut the cable?"

 "Yes, sir."

 "And there's an officer responsible for the steering?"

 "Yes, sir."

 "You've told the men to keep their damned pistols half-cocked until you
 give the word? All we need is a premature shot to give away the game."

 "Oh." That was the thing you forgot.

 What do you say?

 A: "Uh, no, sir, I--it slipped my mind. I'll make sure they know before
 we leave, sir."
 B: "I'll tell them when we're ready to go, sir. Wouldn't want them to
 forget."

>b
 knew you had forgotten, and isn't overly impressed by your attempt to
 cover your error. "See that you do," he says tersely. But then he
 manages a somewhat strained smile. "Good luck to you, Mr. Rockersuke."

 "To you too, sir," you say, and go to shepherd your men into the boats.

>go
 "Now see here!" you order your men in a fierce whisper. "Not one sound
 from any of you once we're out on the water! And keep those pistols of
 yours half-cocked until I give the order otherwise! Any man who
 disobeys will be kissing the gunner's daughter tomorrow!"

 They all nod, and you join them in the boat, satisfied that you covered
 your earlier mistake brilliantly. No one would ever guess you entirely
 forgot to give the order before.

>go
 The oars skim smoothly over the water, and the men obediently keep
 quiet. You can feel your heart hammer in your throat as the great dark
 shapes of the Gaulish ships loom overhead, and you hope your hand
 doesn't shake on the tiller. It is your responsibility to get the boat
 close enough to board the merchant vessel, without letting their
 lookout see anything. You hope your sailing ability is up to the task.

>go
 "Uh, Mr. Rockersuke," Stuart whispers loudly. "Uh, sir, begging your
 pardon, but I think we're drifting--"

 To your horror, you realize that Stuart is right. You hastily fumble to
 correct your error. Do you thank him for his assistance, or order him
 to keep quiet?

 A: I nod my thanks as I correct course.
 B: I order him to keep quiet.

>a
 quality in a senior officer.

 Unfortunately, Stuart's warning came too late. From far above, you hear
 the shout of the lookout on the Gaulish ship. He has seen you. Your
 sailing skill apparently wasn't up to the task after all.

 This is all going to be much harder now.

>go
 You fling yourself at the chains that snake up the Gaulish ship's side,
 ordering your men to follow and remembering to call over your shoulder
 the additional order to cock their pistols. Above your head, you can
 hear shouts and pounding feet as the Gaulish sailors rush to defend
 their ship.

 You and your men climbs as fast as you can, but your poor sailing
 ability gave the Gauls a chance to get themselves prepared. You were
 counting on the advantage of surprise, and you have largely lost that.
 Still, nothing for it--

 "For Albion!" you shout, and plunge into the fracas on the deck.

>go
 You cut to the left and the right with your sword, shouting as loudly
 as you can. At first, the Gauls scatter before you--but then they begin
 to regroup.

 One rushes you from the left, and you turn and plunge your sword into
 his chest. He falls--but there is another diving in from the right,
 closing fast as you struggle to extricate your blade from his dead
 shipmate.

 What do you do?

 A: I use all my strength to wrench my sword free, and then I turn and
 fight.
 B: I can't waste an instant. I abandon my sword, and turn to fight with
 my pistol.
 C: There isn't enough time to turn. I dodge to the left.

>b
 new opponent swings his sword. Steel whistles past your ear--you fire
 at point-blank range--and the Gaul falls to the deck, a smoking hole in
 the center of his chest.  In a smooth motion you pick up the fallen
 Gaul's sword and pistol to replace your own.

 You turn your attention back to the task at hand: fighting your way
 through the mass of bodies to the cable. You have almost reached your
 goal when you find your way blocked by two massive, angry Gauls
 standing shoulder to shoulder. You aim your pistol--and just then, out
 of the corner of your eye, see Mason fighting a desperate duel on the
 other side of the deck.

 If Mason falls, his task will go uncompleted. On the other hand, if you
 spend your bullet to save his life, you will be out of ammunition. And
 then you will have to fight both these Gauls with just your sword. If
 they cut you down, your task will go uncompleted.

 What do you do?

 A: I am confident in my ability to win any swordfight, even two on one.
 And it is my responsibility to see to the safety of those under my
 command. I turn and fire at Mason's attacker.
 B: Mason can take care of himself--he is a well-trained officer of the
 Royal Navy. It is my responsibility to see my own part of the mission
 successfully executed. I fire at one of the Gauls in front of me.

>a
 wide-eyed--then gives you an awkward nod of thanks and scrambles to his
 task.

 You, meanwhile, turn back to see two large Gauls with drawn swords
 charging at you.

 You howl an incoherent challenge and rush to meet them. Steel clangs
 against steel, and pain scores across your left leg as one of the Gauls
 lands a blow. You are not fighting by any honorable rules now, but
 desperately for your life, using elbows and knees as well as the blade
 of your sword. You manage to elbow one Gaul in the throat, and he falls
 back, choking curses. That gives you the opportunity you need to wound
 the other slightly and run before he recovers.

 At last you pummel your way through the mass of bodies to the anchor
 cable, and hack through it with your sword.  The Gaulish ship is
 drifting freely now.

 You look up, and pick out Mason's dark figure, very high up in the
 rigging. As you watch, the topsail flutters free.

 You turn back to the fight. In no time at all, Gauls are surrendering
 all over the deck. You take prisoner those who still live, get the
 prize underway, and take her safely back to Courageous.

>go
 Bryce's prize beats you there by no more than a few minutes. You and he
 meet on deck, and he looks as flushed and giddy as you feel. You reach
 over to shake his hand, and he squeezes yours warmly.

 "Brilliant!" the Captain says in approval. "Very nicely done indeed,
 the two of you!" He orders you and Bryce to take command of your prizes
 and sail them to Albion--adding, with a smile, that he would be much
 surprised if you did not each receive a promotion to Commander.

>go
 And indeed, the Admiralty promotes you to the rank of Commander. It is
 a proud moment indeed when you first walk down a street in Chesterport
 with an epaulette pinned to your left shoulder. And now you are
 eligible to command a sloop of your own, and to receive the courtesy
 title of "Captain."

 Well done, Captain Rockersuke!

>go
 You experience the greatest thrill of your life when you step onto the
 deck of your first command: H.M. Sloop Hotspur. You are very pleased
 indeed by what you observe there--she is a gleaming almost-new sloop
 that reportedly handles like a charm, crewed by good men obviously
 accustomed to working well together. A plum command, particularly for a
 new commander such as yourself. That night, you dream of all the fine
 things you will do now that you have a sloop of your own.

>go
 In the morning, you wake to a general hullaballoo on the dock and in
 the streets of Chesterport. Peace has been declared between Albion and
 Gaul.

 Oh, the details are not yet finalized, but documents have been signed
 and hostilities suspended. Before you know it, you find yourself once
 again in front of the captain who commands the port--but this time, to
 hear the unwelcome news that Hotspur is to be paid off. That is,
 decommissioned. The Admiralty won't have need of such a large fleet in
 peacetime.

 Your career has--for the moment, at least--vanished in a puff of smoke
 and diplomats.

>go
 "Might there be any chance of another command becoming available, sir?"
 you ask deferentially.

 The Captain grimaces. "I wish I could say, Mr. Rockersuke. There will
 be ships needing captains, of course, but there will also be a great
 many post-captains and commanders seeking positions. A bright youngster
 like yourself has a tolerable chance, but. . . it may be some time. Oh,
 but it's not so bad! You're entitled to half-pay, and of course you
 have your prize money. You should enjoy your leave. You will receive a
 letter when a command becomes available."

 How are you feeling about this?

 A: Pleased. It will be nice to have a holiday, and I can manage quite
 nicely on half-pay plus prize money. I am confident that I will get
 another command before very long.
 B: Resigned. I serve the Navy in whatever capacity they require. I can
 be patient. Surely it won't be very long before I am offered another
 command.
 C: Nervous. I am uncertain how long I can survive on half-pay, even
 augmented by prize money. And what if I am not offered another command?
 I am hardly trained for any other career!

>a

 One day some weeks later, on your way back from drawing your half-pay,
 you run into your old friend Bryce. "Rockersuke, what good luck to meet
 up with you! You must come and dine with me tonight. I want to
 introduce you to my wife."

 You enjoy the meal very much. Mrs. Bryce is a charming hostess,
 gracious and sweet and well-mannered, and Bryce is obviously devoted to
 her. After dinner, you and Bryce sit drinking rum and storytelling long
 into the night.

 Suddenly Bryce says, "So what about you, Rockersuke? High time you got
 married, isn't it?" He looks at you shrewdly and laughs. "You're about
 to tell me you've been too busy to think of it. Well, you'll have
 plenty of leisure while you're on half-pay! You should think about it
 now!"

 You consider the idea. What do you conclude?

 A: Bryce seems to have stumbled onto a good thing. It might be. . .
 kind of nice to have something like this myself. A home to return to, a
 loving wife. . .
 B: Bryce is right: marriage to the right kind of woman could be very
 useful as I try to advance in my career.
 C: Marriage? Not me! I don't want to be tied down to anyone.
 D: The idea of a wife has never held any appeal for me. . . It's
 not--ahem--it's not women I find attractive, you see.

>c
 another glass."

 And to his credit, Bryce doesn't bring up the topic again. He does,
 however, convince you to go with him and Mrs. Bryce to the Assembly
 rooms one evening. Truth to tell, you're not hard to convince: even if
 you're not in search of a wife, an Assembly is quite a sight to see.

 The Assembly rooms are crowded with young people dancing and flirting.
 In rooms off to one side, those disinclined to dance or flirt are
 playing at cards. You walk around the ballroom, getting your bearings,
 enjoying the pomp and circumstance and splendor. . .

 Suddenly, a voice you know cuts through the chatter around you.

 "Mr. Rockersuke!"

 You turn, astonished. It is Lieutenant Villeneuve.

>go
 He is not wearing the uniform of the Gaulish Navy, but it is
 unmistakably the same man whom you met aboard a Gaulish prize some time
 ago. The years since have treated him well--his skin is more
 weather-beaten, perhaps, and a scar seams his left cheek, but he looks
 to be otherwise in good health and good spirits. And not hurting for
 money, either: he is dressed in a very fine linen shirt and a coat with
 gleaming gold buttons, and he carries a pair of elegant gloves such as
 a gentleman wears when dancing. He has clearly come to this Assembly
 intending to dance. It is a small shock to you to realize that a
 Gaulish officer is here as someone's invited guest.

 How do you respond?

 A: "Mr. Villeneuve! What a surprise."
 B: "What on earth are you doing here?"

>a
 easily than it did when you first met, though it is still heavily
 accented. "Though I do acknowledge the surprise must be much more great
 on your side--to encounter me upon the soil of Albion--no?" He smiles
 disarmingly. "I have cousins who reside not far from here. Many Gaulish
 families can say the same. Marriages in between Gaul and Albion are not
 uncommon, after all, during the years of peace. And the years of peace
 have returned. . ." He gestures around the pleasant room. ". . . so a
 man once again has freedom to visit his relations. It is a very fine
 thing, peace. It permits--" He inclines his head at you. "--civilized
 gentlemen to interact in a civilized manner."

 This is as frank an overture of friendship as any you have ever seen.
 What do you do?

 A: Respond in kind. Villeneuve is a man of honor. There is no reason to
 think him anything less than sincere.
 B: Proceed warily. Villeneuve is a Gaul, after all, and the war hasn't
 been over for that long. He might have some nefarious purpose in
 seeking my friendship.
 C: Pretend to respond in kind. It could be useful later if Villeneuve
 comes to trust me. Perhaps he will tell me things. The peace might not
 last, after all.
 D: Put this presumptuous Gaul in his place.

>go down
 Albionish merchants and taking the lives of Albionish sailors. How dare
 he come and claim friendship with me now?

 "On the other hand," you say coldly, "peace deprives men like me of the
 opportunity to remove scum like you from the face of the earth."

 Villeneuve looks utterly taken-aback for one instant. And then his face
 slowly flushes red. A few people nearby turn their heads curiously. You
 must have spoken more loudly than you intended.

 "Ah," Villeneuve says between his teeth, "Albionish civilization.
 Apparently, not all it is boasted to be. Sir." He inclines his head a
 bare fraction and turns on his heel.

 Wait a minute. Did he just insult your country?

>go
 He did. He actually did. The cheek of that damned Gaul.

 What are you going to do about it?

 A: Maintain a dignified silence and walk away. He is beneath contempt.
 B: Insult him back.
 C: Call him out.

>c
 the room turn in your direction.

 Villeneuve regards you sardonically. "There is nothing wrong with your
 ears. You heard me."

 Bryce suddenly appears at your side. "Rockersuke, what in hell are you
 doing?" he demands in a whisper.

 "I have been insulted," you say calmly. More calmly than you feel, to
 tell the truth: your palms are sweating. You never have fought a duel
 before. To Villeneuve, you say, "I demand satisfaction, sir."

 Villeneuve laughs. "I am all willingness to oblige, sir. My cousin
 shall stand as my second. Who, sir, shall serve as yours?"

 You look at Bryce.

 "I. . . I will, of course," he says heavily. "Mr. Villeneuve, as the
 challenged party, yours is the choice of weapon. Do you choose pistols
 or swords?"

 "Oh, swords, of course," Villeneuve says. "A bullet might go anywhere,
 after all, but steel. . ."

 "Very good," Bryce says. "We shall see you at dawn tomorrow."

 So at dawn tomorrow, you will be fighting a duel. By breakfast-time
 tomorrow, you might very well be dead. How did you get yourself into
 this mess?

>go
 The next morning dawns unseasonably cold. . . or maybe it just feels
 that way to you. You dress carefully in your uniform and buckle your
 sword at your side. Bryce appears and conducts you to the field where
 matters of honor are usually resolved. It is even colder here. A faint
 mist floats over the grass.

 Villeneuve is standing too far away for you to read the expression on
 his face. Bryce goes to confer with Christy-Palliere. He comes back
 looking grim, and that doesn't help.

 "You shall stand five paces apart," he says, "and begin when the signal
 is given. Until first blood. Are you ready?"

 Are you?

 A: Not really, but I would never admit that.
 B: Hell yes!

>b

 "Good luck, Edward," Bryce says.

 You face Villeneuve. You still can't read his expression.
 Christy-Palliere shouts the order to begin.

 Villeneuve shifts at once into a guard position. You and he circle each
 other, eyeing, probing for weakness.

 Do you want to approach this duel cautiously and keep your moves mostly
 defensive, or do you want to mount an aggressive offensive?

 A: I want to fight defensively.
 B: I want to fight aggressively.

>b
 Villeneuve does the same. At first neither of you can gain the
 advantage. But then you see an opening, and lunge for it.

>go
 The abrupt ferocity of your attack takes Villeneuve off-guard; he moves
 to parry, but not quite quickly enough, and your blade slices down his
 left arm.

 "Hold!" Bryce shouts. "First blood! Honor is satisfied!"

 You step back, breathing hard. Villeneuve clutches his left arm, and
 blood seeps through his fingers in a bright red gush.

 "It's all right," Bryce says to you, "it's all right. You haven't
 killed him. He will bear the scar the rest of his life, though. Serves
 the Gaul right."

>go
 The peace with Gaul does not last. Before long, hostilities have
 resumed and the Admiralty is building back up its Royal Navy, to combat
 the Gaulish threat to the freedom of the seas.

 The letter arrives by special messenger, very early on a cold morning.
 You slit the seal. Your orders are written in fine black script on
 heavy, cream-colored paper.

 It reads, "You are requested and required to assume command of H.M.
 Sloop Defender. . ."

 Your own command at last!

>go
 At the crack of dawn, you walk to the end of the long pier, where you
 first catch sight of H.M. Sloop Defender.

 It's . . . not all that you might hope for.  There are barnacles on the
 hull; the sails are tattered at the edges; the paint is worn. It's no
 better as you find yourself standing on the dirty, uneven deck,
 introducing yourself to your first (and only) lieutenant.

 "Welcome aboard Defender, sir," says Mr. Benton proudly.  "Finest sloop
 in the navy!"  His uniform looks as if he'd put it on in the dark.  He
 wouldn't know the finest sloop in the navy if it raked him with a
 broadside.

 You promptly draw out the orders from the Admiralty placing you in
 command of H.M. Sloop Defender.

 When you finish reading your orders aloud to the crew, you are
 officially the new master and commander of the sloop.

>go
 Out of the corner of your eye, you spot a familar sailor: Master's Mate
 Jones!  Ah, make that just "Jones" since he was disrated in connection
 with that unpleasant business with Mr. Pigot back on H.M.S. Courageous.

 He greets you with a salute and a smile.  At least there's one good
 sailor on this sloop!

>go
 "Captain Rockersuke, sir?" says a middle-aged man coming up from below
 deck.  "Carter, reporting for duty.  I'm the senior master's mate and
 acting master of Defender."

 A post-captain would have a sailing master under him as the most senior
 warrant officer, but on a sloop the commander is technically also the
 master.  You still have a few master's mates--experienced ratings
 working to get their warrants as masters in the Royal Navy.  Mr.
 Carter, as the senior mate, will fill the role of the sloop's sailing
 master in all but title.

 "Mr. Carter," you reply, "make the sloop ready for some shake-down
 maneuvers.  I want to see her capabilities."

 "Aye aye, sir!"

 You inspect Carter carefully as he readies the sloop for basic action.
 You quickly realize that this man is the only force holding the sloop
 together; Benton gives orders, but Carter has them followed.  Under
 Carter's guidance, you manage to get the sloop out onto open waters.

>go
 The shake-down maneuvers are embarrassing.  You sail the sloop around,
 clear for battle, and fire off a broadside.  The sails are not hauled
 taut, it takes longer to raise and lower the sails than it should, and
 it takes much longer (a full minute or more) to clear the sloop for
 action than it ought.  The broadside is ragged and slow, and one sailor
 injures himself by getting his foot crushed by a gun carriage.

 At this point, you believe that, overall, the crew is reasonably happy
 but poorly disciplined.

 You're going to have to turn this sloop into a credible fighting
 vessel; to do that, you'll have to put the men to work.  It looks like
 this crew isn't particularly used to hard work yet.

 Where do you want them to focus their efforts?

 A: Drill them on gunnery.
 B: Practicing sailing maneuvers.
 C: Clean the sloop completely.

>b
 then send the hands aloft to lower and reef the sails.  As soon as the
 last topman is back on the deck, you send them back up to unreef and
 spread the sails again.  You tack into the wind, rapidly switching your
 sailing points and drilling the crew on switching tacks.   Then you
 bring the sloop about and order the crew to quickly set the sails to
 run before the wind.  As soon as they are done with that adjustment,
 it's time to turn across the wind.  When the men have adjusted again,
 it's back to tacking into the wind.  The work is hard and requires
 constant attention--any carelessness aloft could be deadly.  Mr. Carter
 times every maneuver, with a tongue-lashing or worse for any sailor who
 is slow about his duty. By the end of the day, the men stagger down for
 their dinner.  And then the next day, starting with a tired crew, you
 do it again.

 After several days of this brutal regimen, you see real improvement.
 The men are more alert, quicker in responding to the changes you order.
 The crispness and speed of the sloop's maneuvers improves, and you find
 that the sloop is both more maneuverable and faster than you had
 thought when you first assumed command.  The men groan as you order
 them aloft each day, but slowly they are becoming a credit to the Royal
 Navy. However, it's clear that they haven't had to work this hard in
 quite some time; you manage to overhear a few surly grumbles from the
 crew, though you don't manage to catch any particular sailor grumbling.

 A: Keep working them as hard as they can.
 B: Let's take it easy for now.

>b
 them a "rope yarn Sunday"--a day when their duties are cut back to the
 bare minimum necessary to keep the sloop sailing.  Even though the rope
 yarn Sunday doesn't fall on an actual Sunday, you let them relax as if
 it did, and in fact more than on most Sundays.  Some of the men skylark
 on deck, while others take to gambling and similar recreations.  The
 mood of the crew improves dramatically as the men have some time to
 themselves and a little bit of an opportunity to relax.

 Unfortunately, a relaxed mood is not necessarily what you want in the
 Royal Navy.  You begin to notice that some of the men are slow to touch
 their brows when they address an officer, and even forget to say "sir"
 when they ought.  The omissions are small, but the Royal Navy requires
 shows of respect for a reason.  As the rope yarn Sunday ends, the men
 grumble about returning to their duties, muttering among themselves and
 taking their time in obeying their orders.

 The sloop's happiness increases, but its discipline decreases.

 You believe that, overall, the crew is reasonably happy but poorly
 disciplined.

 "It's a difficult crew, sir," volunteers Mr. Carter.  "Many of these
 landsmen came from the jails.  I've done what I can with them, but the
 previous captain and his lieutenant struggled to keep them in line."

 A: Punish the whole crew harshly.
 B: Identify the worst sailors and punish them.
 C: Punish lightly.
 D: Don't punish at all.

>b
 the character of these sailors; you manage to separate the sheep from
 the goats (for the most part).  The worst of the sailors receive double
 work duty, numerous lashes, and, perhaps worst of all, they're cut off
 from rum completely.

 They soon begin to learn what sort of behavior will get them caned;
 some of them even start to avoid such behavior.

 Discipline increases greatly.

>go
 One evening, you head below deck as some of the men are taking dinner;
 you find Jones telling a bawdy joke about the lascivious habits of
 women in London.

 He tells it quite well; you hadn't noticed before, but Jones has a
 certain natural charisma about him that makes others turn to listen to
 him.

 A: Chastise Jones for behavior unbecoming a sailor.
 B: Have Jones whipped.
 C: Keep an eye on him, but do nothing for now.
 D: Tell a bawdy tale of my own.

>c
 happy but poorly disciplined.

>go
 A few days later, Mr. Carter brings you a landsman sailor whom he found
 asleep on watch.

 "Terribly sorry, sir," he mumbles groggily.

 A: Whip him soundly.
 B: Arrange a (questionable) jury to have him court-martialed and
 hanged.
 C: Put him on double watch, and forbid him from rum.
 D: Let it slide.

>c

 Cutting him off from rum should have helped, but you are soon enough
 informed by a young volunteer that he has fallen asleep on duty a
 second time.

 A: Whip him.
 B: "Court-martial" and hang him.

>a
 any of your sailors flogged.

 How many lashes?

 A: Five lashes.  A sting, but no permanent harm.
 B: Ten lashes.  He'll feel that for some time.
 C: Twenty lashes.  He'll be unable to work effectively for a while.
 D: Thirty lashes.  He should consider himself lucky that he won't be
 crippled.
 E: Fifty lashes.  Make an example of him.

>c
 of the crew seems to agree that he deserves it; all of them now
 understand the penalty for insubordination on your sloop.

 Discipline increases substantially, but happiness decreases.

>go
 As you head below deck, you see a handful of sailors and midshipmen
 whispering together, including Jones.  As soon as they catch sight of
 you, they stop abruptly and go their separate ways.  (You experience a
 brief moment of "deja vu," as the Gauls call it.)

 A: Loudly ask what they were whispering about.
 B: Pull one of them aside to ask what they were whispering about.
 C: Whip them soundly.
 D: Use a spy to find out what they were discussing.
 E: Do nothing.

>go down

 "Watch them, Mr. Carter."

 "Aye aye, sir.  I will, sir."

 At this point, you believe that, overall, the crew is tolerably happy
 and with reasonable but not great discipline.

 There are definitely some bad apples in the crew.

>go
 The next day, Mr. Benton reports that Mr. Carter has died in a fatal
 accident.  "Fallen down the hatchway, sir.  He must have overbalanced."

 Do you think it was really an accident?

 A: Of course.
 B: Absolutely not; this was murder.
 C: I'm not yet sure.

>b
 explanation for his death is murder.  And since you doubt Benton killed
 him, and you know that you didn't, that's tantamount to mutiny.

 So the question is:  What are you going to do about it?

 A: Investigate the murder.  I know he was murdered, but I don't know by
 whom.
 B: Seize the most likely suspects and proceed straight to a
 court-martial.  It's better to be firm and swift in response than to be
 right.
 C: Think about it some more.  I have to respond correctly, and that's
 more important than acting quickly.
 D: Ignore it, at least for now.  Starting an investigation could lead
 to an open mutiny, and I can't risk that.

>a
 poisonous as every member of the crew fears that you will turn on them.
 You make no progress in solving the crime, however.

 Happiness decreases substantially.

 You are now in the difficult position of selecting a new acting-master.
 Mr. Carter's two mates both leave something to be desired.

 There's MacDougal, the senior mate.  He's intelligent, but he usually
 diverts his intelligence toward finding clever ways to avoid work.  You
 doubt he'll set a good example for the crew.

 Then there's Avery, the junior mate.  He's staunchly loyal to you and
 to the ship, but that's about all you can say for him.  He's
 simple-minded, to put it kindly; a moron, to put it plainly.

 Of course, there's also Jones.  As commander of H.M. Sloop Defender,
 you have the authority to restore him to his old grade as master's
 mate; you could then promote him to acting-master.  Jones would
 certainly appreciate it; it might help to have another strong friend on
 the crew.

 A: Appoint MacDougal.
 B: Appoint Avery.
 C: Restore Jones's grade and appoint him.

>b
 clanging metal outside your cabin.

 You swing up out of bed, grabbing for your sword--just as a team of
 armed sailors breaks down the door. The leader's face is twisted into a
 sneer. "Not so powerful now, are you?" he says scornfully. Over his
 shoulder, you can see the Marine sentry and a sailor bleeding to death
 on the deck outside. "Throw down that sword."

 Do you?

 A: I can't win. I throw down my sword.
 B: Never!

>b
 following up your advantage, you cut your way through the mutineers and
 manage to maneuver your way out of your cabin. On deck, you see that
 the mutiny is just getting started.

 You rally the loyalists, and assess the tactical situation. Though
 parts of the crew were unhappy enough to risk their lives to kill you,
 notwithstanding your efforts to build discipline. . . the numbers are
 still on your side.

 For now.

>go
 "We must re-take control of this ship!" you shout, and the men
 surrounding you nod. Some of them are armed, with blades or pistols;
 some have only their bare hands. But at least they are all on your
 side.

 "For Albion!" you yell. They follow you as you charge back down the
 deck, no longer fighting defensively but now actively attacking anyone
 in your way.

>go
 From around a corner come a contingent of mutineers--some of the ones
 who broke into your cabin, and some others. They stop when they see
 your party of loyalists. You stop too. Your two groups glare at each
 other along the deck. Light glistens off the blades of their cutlasses.

 What do you do?

 A: Bluff them into surrendering.
 B: Charge down the deck and engage them directly.
 C: Grab a pistol from one of your loyal men and start shooting from
 here.

>c
 at the closest mutineer. He falls--and the others come charging up the
 deck. Your loyalists meet them squarely, and then the battle is
 engaged.

 A bullet rips through your shoulder, and your vision contracts with
 pain, but that doesn't stop you. Shouting and slashing, you fight
 mutineers for control of your command.

>go
 The battle is long and bloody, but in the end, the loyalists are
 victorious.

 Easily a dozen men have died, and a further two dozen more are unable
 to work, but with that show of force, you have put down the mutiny and
 re-established control of your sloop.

>go
 H.M. Sloop Defender continues her cruise.  On a bright and clear day,
 you come into sight of a Gaulish merchant convoy, with no apparent
 warships to defend it.  There are a dozen Gaulish merchant ships in
 all.

 How do you plan your attack?

 A: We stay to windward, planning on picking off the Gaulish ships one
 by one as we overrun them.  With the advantage of the wind gage, we
 will be able to catch any ships that try to run easily.
 B: We head to the middle of the convoy.  We want to get as many ships
 in cannon range as quickly as possible.
 C: We sail to lee of the convoy.  With the wind pushing them towards
 us, they will have little choice but to come to us, and Defender is
 faster and more maneuverable than any merchant ship.

>b
 the ensign of the Royal Navy.  The Gaulish ships begin to scatter,
 hoping that you will have to chase one or two and allow the rest to
 escape.

 Defender's crew responds to your orders well.  The men are not the most
 disciplined crew that you have ever served with, but they are adequate
 to the task at hand.  You maneuver the sloop well, overtaking one
 Gaulish ship after another, and a barrage of cannon fire at the Gaulish
 sails cripples your prey.  Inevitably, most of the merchant ships
 escape, but you capture five of the enemy.  You have deprived Gaul of
 much-needed supplies and earned yourself a sizable payment of prize
 money.

>go
 In recognition of your able service turning H.M. Sloop Defender into a
 worthy part of the Royal Navy, the Admiralty promotes you to
 post-captain and assigns you to command H.M.S. Dauntless, a 38-gun
 frigate.

 The Admiralty asks if you have a preference for your first lieutenant.

 A: I ask for Mr. Stuart from H.M.S. Courageous.
 B: I ask for Mr. Mason from H.M.S. Courageous.
 C: I ask for Mr. Benton from H.M. Sloop Defender.
 D: I make no requests; the current first lieutenant will serve
 admirably.

>go down
 Evans.  He is competent and able, but nothing more than that.  Also, by
 not making personnel management more difficult for your superiors, you
 have earned a small additional amount of support higher up in the Royal
 Navy.

 Your frigate, H.M.S. Dauntless, sails into Kingsport harbor.  Kingsport
 is the principal harbor city in one of Albion's major colonial
 possessions in the tropics.  The fleet based out of Kingsport consists
 mostly of frigates like your own--perfect for raiding Gaulish shipping
 and for defending Albion's own merchant marine from the depredations of
 the Gaulish Navy and privateers.  Assignment to this fleet is quite a
 plum, with great opportunities for prize money and pleasant ports of
 call on the tropical islands.

 Shortly after your ship makes port, while you are overseeing the
 process of taking on new supplies, the signal midshipman runs up to
 you.  He touches his hat in salute and says, "Signal from the flag:
 Admiral's compliments, Captains of Dauntless, Vigilant, and Intrepid
 please come to the flagship at your convenience."

 "Acknowledge the signal and inform the officer of the watch to have my
 boat prepared for immediate departure," you reply.  When an admiral
 asks you to report to the flagship, it is "convenient" for you to drop
 whatever you are doing and to head over immediately.

 Within a minute, your boat is lowered over the frigate's side.  Upon
 your arrival, smartly dressed sailors and a marine honor guard pipe you
 aboard H.M.S. Indomitable, the admiral's flag ship.  The flag
 lieutenant touches his hat to each of the arriving captains.  "Sir, if
 you will please accompany me?  The Admiral is waiting in his
 stateroom."

>go
 The three of you are shown into the Admiral's stateroom--a surprisingly
 large cabin for a warship, with a large heavy table set in the middle.
 The Admiral is in late middle-age, his youthful vigor long since having
 given way to a prosperous roundness.  His flag captain murmurs each of
 your names as you enter.

 The Admiral pours a glass of port for each of you and clears his
 throat.  "As you know, one of our principal responsibilities on this
 station is protecting Albion's merchant shipping.  The foodstuffs and
 raw materials from these colonies are vital to Albion's security.
 Recently, however, a Gaulish commerce raider has taken a large number
 of our merchantships as prizes.

 "The Gaulish frigate has recently made port on Blue Island.  Blue
 Island is a possession of Jutland and thus still neutral, so we can't
 take the frigate there.  But we do have our spies keeping their eyes
 out, and so we got a report of the frigate.  She's a 44-gun frigate,
 called Lynx, under the command of a Captain Villeneuve."

>go
 You startle slightly at the name of Lynx's captain, and the Admiral
 raises an eyebrow.  "You know of Villeneuve, Captain Rockersuke?"

 "Our paths have crossed a few times, sir," you reply guardedly.

 "All the better.  I'm assigning each of you the mission to hunt down
 Lynx.  You are to make all efforts to capture or destroy her.  I know,
 I know. . . you would rather be hunting rich Gaulish merchantships.  I
 would rather you were hunting merchantships as well."  The Admiral
 smiles--after all, he receives fully one-quarter of the value of any
 prizes his ships capture.  "But we have our duty to think of.  Because
 of the rules of neutrality, none of you can take stations within sight
 of Blue Island.  I want Vigilant to patrol to the east of the island,
 Intrepid to sail to the west, and Dauntless to patrol to the north.
 One of you should be able to force Lynx to action as she sails out.

 "I am also well aware of the fact that a 44-gun frigate is
 significantly more powerful than any of your ships.  However, I have no
 heavier frigates to send, and a ship of the line would be unable to
 force Lynx to fight.  I trust that the superior sailing and gunnery of
 the Royal Navy will be more than sufficient for you to prevail.  And,
 as their Lordships say in the orders giving you command of a ship,
 'fail in these duties at your peril,' eh?  Unless there are any
 questions?  Best be about it, then."

 You quickly return to your ship.  As soon as you have the most
 essential supplies on board, you make sail to fight your oldest rival.

 How do you feel about fighting Villeneuve?

 A: I look forward to it.
 B: It is a duty like any other.
 C: I dread fighting him, but it is still my duty.
 D: Surely, there must be some way to avoid this!

>a

 You sail H.M.S. Dauntless into position--north of the main port of Blue
 Island, but out of sight of the port.  Staying on a specific station
 requires a certain amount of tacking and sailing back and forth, but
 that provides you with an opportunity to drill your crew into a high
 state of readiness.  On the third day after you arrive in position, a
 sailor in the crow's nest calls down, "Two sails--one to port, one to
 starboard!"

 You pull out your spyglass and look at each ship.  The ship to port
 looks like a fully-loaded large Gaulish merchant ship.  It would be
 easy prey for a 38-gun frigate like Dauntless and would fetch you a
 substantial payment in prize money.

 But the ship to starboard is a warship.  You can't be certain at this
 range, but that ship is probably Lynx, the Gaulish 44 that you have
 been sent to defeat.

 What do you do?

 A: There is no glory in taking merchant ships as prizes.  A battle
 against another frigate is exactly what I want.
 B: Duty demands that I fight the warship despite the dangers.
 C: I could take the merchant ship, but the consequences if the Admiral
 realized that I shirked an opportunity to fight the Lynx would be too
 great.
 D: I can't really be sure that the frigate is the Lynx.  Better to take
 the prize and not worry about it.

>b
 quarters," you say calmly.

 "Aye aye, sir," he responds.

 Drums echo throughout the ship as the crew clears the ship for action.

 Neither ship has the wind gage as you approach, but the wind is blowing
 strong and steady, giving you a fair degree of speed and
 maneuverability.  Lynx is the stronger ship in terms of armament and
 construction, but the men of the Royal Navy are generally better
 trained and more reliable than those of the Gaulish Navy.

 How do you plan to win this battle?

 A: Charge straight at Lynx--the sooner I can make this a boarding
 action, the better.
 B: Stay at range and fight a gunnery duel, relying on my ship's
 superior gunnery to offset Lynx's heavier broadsides.
 C: Lead Lynx into a trap.  If I can make Villeneuve think he has
 damaged my ship worse than he has, I will be able to gain the
 advantage.

 while maintaining a broadside to broadside fight.  Captain Villeneuve
 clearly anticipates your plan and tries to edge away from you, keeping
 this a gunnery battle for as long as possible.

 Despite your best efforts, however, Lynx keeps you at medium cannon
 range.  Each ship fires broadside after broadside, trying to batter the
 other into surrender.

 Dauntless and Lynx exchange broadside after broadside, but the results
 are inconclusive.  Lynx throws much more lead with each broadside, but
 the Gaulish gunners are no match for the Royal Navy's rigorous
 training.  Several of their cannon balls rip across your deck, smashing
 men and material alike to pieces.

>go
 Thus far, you've given as good as you've gotten.  The battle could go
 either way.  Captain Villeneuve is trying to close with Dauntless to
 force a boarding action.

 It will be hard to maintain the battle as a gunnery action--you'll have
 to either carry the enemy by boarding or try to damage their rigging
 enough to sail away.

 Which will it be?

 A: I've done enough to be able to break off the battle
 honorably--that's all I really wanted.
 B: I would really like to press the battle, but it's too dangerous.  I
 must flee.
 C: I think I can win this one.
 D: The only possible end to this battle is Lynx's surrender or
 destruction.

>go down

 Finally, the battle comes down to a boarding action.  As the ships come
 alongside each other, the crews charge forward, screaming and waving
 their cutlasses.  The fighting is bloody and vicious.

 As you rush onto the enemy quarterdeck, sword in hand, you come face to
 face with Captain Villeneuve.  He swings his sword up in a salute and
 drops into a guard position.

 The fight is intense.  You quickly wound Villeneuve, but he answers
 with a vicious blow to your left arm, hurting you badly.  You fear that
 he will prevail, but finally you feint towards his left, then beat his
 sword aside and thrust towards the right of his body.  Villeneuve
 slumps to the ground as you run him through.  Your long years of battle
 experience tell you that he will be dead within minutes.

 How do you feel about Villeneuve's death?

 A: At last!  I've finally killed that dog.
 B: He was a worthy foe, but a foe nonetheless.
 C: C'est la guerre.  I had no choice and have no regrets.
 D: My heart is heavy, but duty required nothing less.
 E: But. . . but. . . What have I done?  How could I kill my friend?

>a
 boarding action.

 H.M.S. Dauntless is lightly damaged, when all is said and done, and you
 have captured Lynx.  You sail back to Kingsport with the prize.  The
 Admiral is most pleased, and promotes Mr. Evans to commander as a sign
 of his regard.

 You are then assigned commerce raiding duties--by the time you receive
 orders to return to Albion, you have made a small fortune in prize
 money.

 Finally, you arrive back in Albion.  You are hailed as a hero upon your
 arrival--the whole nation rejoiced over the report of your victory.

 The King himself requests your presence at court.  The King calls you
 forward and commands you to kneel.  He strikes you on each shoulder
 with a sword and confers the title of Knight of the Most Honorable
 Order of the Vigil upon you.  Congratulations, Sir Edward.

>go
 With that, your adventure comes to an end for now, Sir Edward.

 As one of the heroes of the Royal Navy, you are always in demand.
 Whenever a choice assignment is available, your name comes up.  And if
 you choose to, you could easily win election to Parliament or gain
 entree into the highest echelons of Albion's society.

 As the years go by, you steadily climb up the naval list.  As your
 seniority increases, you finally receive promotion to rear admiral.
 You receive an important command.  You finally retire from the Royal
 Navy before promotion to the highest ranks.

 You have barely enough money to buy an estate and to live as a country
 gentleman on the relatively rare occasions when you are on half-pay.
 Your success and heroism has not been matched with commensurate
 financial rewards.  Still, with commands easy for you to secure, you
 live a comfortable life.

 As a national hero with a very successful naval career, you are an
 extremely eligible bachelor.  You can easily make an excellent marriage
 if you wish, whether pursuing an old flame or courting anew.
