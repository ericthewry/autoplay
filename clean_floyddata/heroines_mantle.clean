 Ever since that night eight years ago, memories have haunted your
 sleep: katana flashing through the air, your mother's executioner
 wiping it clean, remarks he made to your father as you tasted your
 first mouthful of seawater.

 "A detective with the ACPD, and to think you had my complete trust. We
 all make mistakes, Mister Flint. Yours were to have a wife and
 daughter. They would have lived long, happy lives had you accepted my
 payoff and walked away."


 <span class="floydstyle i">Drowning</span> (in the Atlantic ocean)
 You can't swim. In thirteen years, you never learned how.

 Not that it would make any difference. No teenage schoolgirl could
 hold her own against strong Atlantic currents. The swirling waters
 drag sediments of sand up from the seabed. Moonlight filters through
 the planks of a wooden jetty, one of many around Maiden's Wharf.

 Your school blazer weighs heavily on your back, porous nylon absorbing
 seawater like a sponge. Leather boots, fastened and waterlogged, drag
 you deeper.

>drop blazer
 befo


 You'll have to remove the school uniform first.

>remove uniform

 You pull your arms free of the blazer, sliding off your boots for good
 measure. The discarded items of clothing sink to the ocean floor.

 You're starting to see things: a golden horse riding across the ocean,
 no less. The flying animal disappears over the jetty.

 Your shirt buttons are too awkward to unfasten.

 Your head breaks the ocean surface. You breathe in deeply, emptying
 your lungs. A woman stands on the jetty, enshrouded in a halo. The
 Crusader? Waves lap over your sinking face. Was it her? You're not
 sure.

>examine jetty
 befo


 Wooden support poles extend down to the seabed.

 Something bangs you on the head: a golden staff, half dipped into the
 ocean.

>grab staff

 You grab hold of the staff. The person holding the other end lifts you
 onto the jetty. You blink, emptying your eyes of residual seawater.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Jetty</span>
 Waves crash against the quayside, frothy water draining away through
 the seaweed clogged jetty. Barges bob up and down on the ocean, moored
 to iron rings along a labyrinthine maze of piers stretching west.
 Further out, tankers import oil from the continent, unloading at
 offshore platforms.

 Two bodies lie face-up on the wharf: Mercedes and Jason, your murdered
 parents. The Crusader leans on her staff, watching in silence.

 (the Crusader)
 The woman's distinctive halo identifies her as the Crusader, heroine
 of Atlantic City. Shimmering, pulsating, golden light surrounds her
 completely, curving with her body, concealing her facial features
 behind a glowing ellipsoid. She carries the Staff of Justice, a rod of
 gold which shines in phase with its wielder.

>examine staff
 befo


 In Atlantic City, the staff is a legend, a half metre rod of gold with
 which the Crusader tackles her criminal foes. Roughly every second or
 so, it glows, bright as the sun, before fading to a single pulsating
 glyph. The inscribed runes light up in sequence: eastern script,
 supposedly the source of the heroine's power.

 No matter how strong the storm, water will never wash the blood
 completely away. From this day onward, nothing will be the same. You
 recall photographs taken on your twelfth birthday: Jason swilling beer
 from his tankard, Mercedes dancing in her aquamarine gown, little Lisa
 blowing out the candles on her cake.

 Husband, wife, and daughter together in happiness. You will always
 remember them so. The Crusader hugs you closer, sorrow choking her
 voice.

 "Not everyone can be saved. Justice will be served, I promise. You
 have the word of the Crusader. I managed to save one young girl. Who
 knows what she might grow up to become? I will watch over you,
 always."

 You stay by your parents' side, hoping that this is all some horrible
 nightmare, and that you will wake up to the sound of your mother's
 voice. Except you never do. When you finally accept your loss, the
 Crusader has gone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crusader's Statue</span>
 As promised, the Crusader watches over you, if only in spirit. The
 heroine sits in the saddle of her golden horse, looking out to sea.
 Luminous paint coats the iron statue, glowing by night, a beacon for
 incoming ships. In her right hand, she holds the Staff of Justice.

 On the statue's base is a plaque dedicated by the mayor of Atlantic
 City.

 A flash of gold catches your eye: a bracelet around the heroine's
 wrist.

>examine plaque

 An iron statue coated in luminous gold paint. In the dark, a glowing
 tribute to the heroine of Atlantic City. She is visible to approaching
 vessels, a blessing to their crew and a warning to pirates. The plaque
 reads:

 "In honour of Madame Crusader, who on July 3rd, 1989 saved the lives
 of 42 dock workers. For this, and countless other acts of heroism, we
 are eternally in her debt.

    -- Thomas Hurst, mayor of Atlantic City."

 The golden horse gallops over the ocean, white water raining off its
 hooves. It rears up above, glowing halo shining down on Maiden's
 Wharf, and on an orphaned young girl, standing alone by herself. The
 Crusader calls out to you, her voice reassuring in your darkest hour.

 "I will watch over you, always."

 December 24th, 2000.

 It's been eight years. Eight, long years searching for the man
 responsible. Four years to put a name to his face, and another four of
 secret investigations while working as a reporter for Atlantic City
 Television.

 The breakthrough happened three days ago. Amy, your closest friend at
 ACTV, gave you an early Christmas present. Somehow-- and exactly how
 is a mystery, she was able to discover the whereabouts of Toshigi
 Takamura, asking you to meet her at the annual festive get-together of
 the Yamitsi Electronics Corporation.

 So, you donned your finest evening dress, polished up your mother's
 chain, and used your connections to get an invite.

 Chirping gizmos welcome you, in their gratingly digitised opinions, to
 the best party of all time. You'd have to disagree. Yamitsi products
 may be many things, but they're not Christmas decorations. Events are
 centred around a globe, which you can circumnavigate to the southeast
 and southwest.

 One exits through lift doors on the north side, or if you're feeling
 energetic, an adjacent stairwell descends twenty-four stories to the
 lobby.

 No cocktails remain, which is just as well because you'd be tempted to
 try one. Almost midnight, no sign of Amy, and everybody else speaks a
 language you never learned. Not the ideal way to spend Christmas Eve.

 Lisa Flint, a slimly built, female caucasian, twenty-one years of age.
 Your eyes are ocean blue, a reminder of events at Maiden's Wharf eight
 years ago. Genetics weren't kind: your hair is wavy blonde, just like
 your mother's.

 An elasticated bra and tight fitting leggings, if you must know.

>remove underwear

 You're not taking that off!

>examine dress
 befo


 The dress is a captivating shade of deep blue, a one piece garment of
 stunning beauty. Spiral patterns have been woven onto the material
 with silver thread, converging towards two spacious shoulder loops.
 The dress is designed to leave its wearer's arms totally exposed.

>examine chain
 befo


 A silver-link chain with a clasp. Fastened to its centre is a sapphire
 encrusted crucifix, inscribed with roman lettering. It was a present
 to your mother on her wedding day, and you've kept it ever since-- no,
 you've thought about it enough.

>examine bracelet

 A wristband, solid gold. There's a catch underneath for separating the
 bracelet into two semicircular sections. Writing is etched on the
 exterior:

 "Protect this child, for she symbolises love, peace, and justice."

 The central region of the twenty-fourth floor is occupied by a
 spherical map of the planet. Spinning on an axis of refined silicon,
 the huge glass ball rotates in precise step with the Earth. Yamitsi's
 conquests are marked with microchips, which light up and fade as night
 and day pass over the seven continents.

 The sun is rising over southeast Asia.

 The glass is smooth.

 You circle clockwise around the globe, coming to the bayview.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bayview</span>
 This side of the Earth is dark, allowing you to gaze without
 distraction at the panoramic view of Atlantic City by night. The
 exterior wall is glass, a tinted window which faces the eastern bay.
 It bends with the corridor, turning through a quarter circle from
 northwest to southwest.

 If it weren't for the overhanging balcony blotting out the stars, the
 view from the Yamitsi building would be breathtaking.

 Someone must have got tired of standing, and fetched their chair from
 the dining table. And then got tired of sitting on hard mahogany,
 leaving it behind.

 The chair looks very uncomfortable.

 One of those fancy chairs that sacrifices comfort for artistic
 glamour. The wood is mahogany, a hard choice for whoever's leaning
 against the backrest. The chair seat is horizontal, and no cushion is
 provided.

>push chair

 Yes-- the seat folds, swinging into a vertical position. The chair's
 front legs collide with those at the rear, lowering by a good few
 inches. Despite checking the wood over and over again, you can't find
 any hinges. Incredible.

 Chaos reigns supreme at Yamitsi's main presentation, party guests
 dashing to and fro in drunken stupors. The more sober amongst them
 jostle for position, jumping up and down and standing on tiptoes.
 Those at the other end of the spectrum have vomited on the carpeted
 gangways that curve in from the northwest and northeast.

 The hub of activity is a large television screen south of the globe.

 He's ten metres away from you. Toshigi Takamura, the gangland boss who
 murdered your parents. The man you've hated so much for the last eight
 years is relaxing in his jacuzzi with two Japanese women. Of course,
 all this is relayed over the television screen, but Amy was right.
 He's here. Speaking of which, so is she.

 Your friend joins you, looking with distaste at Takamura.

 "Jackpot, Lisa! I told you we'd find our man at the party. He seems to
 be having a good time. Let's find somewhere private. Can't talk out
 here-- too risky."

 Your fellow reporter indicates you to take the lead.

 needle guns in their swimsuit tops.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Area</span>
 The party organisers really went to town, preparing a three course
 meal. All the crockery has been cleared away and a long banquet table
 pushed over to one side. A trail of pulled party poppers follow the
 globe anticlockwise to Yamitsi's main presentation. The carpets to the
 northeast are comparitively clean.

 Wisely realising that turkey, pudding and wine don't mix altogether
 well, the caterers set up the dining table within staggering distance
 of the washrooms.

 Your friend tags along.

>enter washroom
 befo


 The door handle is stiff, but you manage to turn it and enter the
 washroom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ladies Washroom</span>
 Perhaps this is pro-female bias, but you can't imagine the men's room
 being neat and tidy. The caring sex have lived up to their reputation:
 the pinewood cubicle doors are closed to, the porcelain washbasins are
 spotless, and not a single tap has been left turned on.

 Amy enters through the washroom door. She looks around, zig-zagging
 between the cubicles before turning to you.

 "Looks promising, Lisa. But we'll have to do something about that
 door. We don't want other people to stumble in and overhear our plan,
 do we?"

 The washroom door is hinged, and closes of its own accord.

 Amy leaps up and down impatiently.

 You slide the chair's mahogany backrest under the door handle, pushing
 its legs as far along the floor as you can. You check the brass knob:
 it doesn't turn at all. Satisfied, you give Amy a smug glance, but
 your friend is already kneeling at your side.

 "Seems reasonably secure. Now where were we? Ah yes, Mister Takamura."

 Amy leans against the far wall, legs crossed and arms folded. You'd
 swear she was gauging your reaction.

 "You're the expert. Or you should be after four years research

 "If you want the man who killed your parents, then you're going to
 have to bend the rules. You don't bring down a leading member of the
 Yakuza by pre-arranging an interview and asking polite questions. He
 rarely sets foot outside of Japan, unless on important business. So
 why has he come here tonight, one wonders?"

>again
 befo


 "You're the expert. Or you should be after four years research

 "My sources drew a blank, but my instincts tell me something on a
 grand scale is about to go down in Atlantic City. You and I both agree
 that justice is our aim, not a bloody vendetta. Takamura's upstairs,
 in the penthouse suite. Try and find something incriminating. Here,
 you'd better take this, just in case."

 Amy hands you a silvery tube the size of a lipstick case: a compact
 taser. Your friend seems about to say something else, but pauses,
 looking at the floor.

>examine tube
 befo


 A miniaturised version of its more common larger sister, although the
 operating principle is much the same: a thin wire is fired at the
 chosen target, electric charge is passed along, and the high voltage
 renders the person unconscious for several hours-- unless its power
 source overloads, which would be bad.

 "I think I can trust you, Lisa. Isn't that what my whole other life's
 been built on? Trust? In case something happens to me, you need to
 know who I really--"

 From outside come shouts of alarm, interspersed with the scuffling of
 feet. Amy sprints across the room, performing a graceful somersault.
 Her two-footed lunge breaks the chair up into useless pieces of
 mahogany. As she leaves the washroom, your friend spins her plain gold
 papered cracker.

 Strange. Before, it had black stripes. And her gown: there was an
 ambient glow like-- no, that would be a ridiculous suggestion to make.

 Those at the other end of the spectrum have vomited on the carpeted

 Takamura's speech has been cut short, replaced by a close up of a man
 in a black suit. Some reporters talk urgently into their mobile
 phones, trying to ascertain the origin of the unscheduled broadcast.
 Others stand in stunned silence, mouths agape at the stranger's
 appearance. Amy slaps her head in frustration.

 "The Baron! I should have known."

 Amy's attention is on the screen.

 In the distance, Atlantic City's memorial clock chimes midnight,
 signalling the arrival of Christmas day. The stranger holds up a
 crystal decanter.

 "Merry Christmas, everybody. Don't bother attempting to change
 channels. I'm far too important to be simply switched off. Besides,
 you'd miss out on the event of the millennium, and you wouldn't want
 to do that, I assure you."

 A stranger has taken over the broadcast. The man is in his fifties,
 sporting a well-trimmed white beard. The electric wheelchair in which
 he sits lumbers him with the apperance of frailty, yet sparkling eyes

 "The mayor, bless his soon to be resting soul, has quite a party
 planned. People are to parade the streets, celebrating the end of the
 twentieth century, singing and dancing as spectacular firework
 displays illuminate the heavens. So, how do we top it all off? Well,
 I've organised a few memorable events of my own."

 The stranger allows the tension to build, sipping more of his brandy.
 A whiff of arousing perfume grabs your attention-- and not just yours,
 either. Every person present turns to look at the mysterious oriental
 beauty in her short-skirted red dress. Amy follows her, both women
 vanishing from sight to the northwest.

 The broadcaster resumes his speech.

 "On that fateful night, three brothers will each wreak their own brand
 of havoc: infernos will rage, disease will spread, and aeroplanes will
 crash. In the midst of the resulting chaos, three sisters will spirit
 away the city's most treasured possessions. Unless, of course, the
 Crusader intervenes."

 "Ah, yes-- the Crusader, Atlantic City's very own golden avenger. Here
 is a lady who proudly swings her Staff of Justice, maintaining law and
 order whilst hiding the follies of the inept police department. Pity
 you all, for resting your hopes on such a pathetic heroine."

 Time passes.

 "All that remains is for me to wish you a crime-ridden new
 millennium."

 The Baron smiles, proposing a toast to the invisible camera as the
 picture fades into white-- static, like the party guests. They're on
 the move now, all rushing off to book seats on the next available
 flight to Tokyo. You're not too worried: the Crusader will save the
 day. She always does, in the end.

 shortened, and she bares her muscular legs for all to see. You feel
 distinctly uncomfortable in this woman's presence, thoughts blurred by
 the sweet, almost hypnotic, aroma of her perfume.

 The woman tosses back her hair.

>smell
 befo


 A mixture of confusing odours. You can't tell one from-- wait! Was
 that a rose? No, more like a daffodil, your mother's favourite flower.
 The scent reminds you of her: the young and beautiful Mercedes. Come
 to think of it, the lady over by the mirror shares those qualities.

 You feel an irresistable urge to be close to the woman, to drool over
 her figure as you reach under her dress. To fondle her body until you
 come to her perfectly round-- NO! What were you thinking!? The lady
 extracts a well chewed wad of pink bubblegum, sticking it onto the
 mirror. Her dress rustles as she moves closer.

 "Feeling off colour? Don't worry. That's quite normal. Right now, you
 would die to give me a kiss. Many men have, and women too. I don't
 discriminate. I'm here on business, but I've got a little time to
 kill. Very warm, isn't it? They must have the heating on full blast.
 What do you say we cool off?"

 With the oriental beauty watch-- her seductively persuasive smile
 forces you to reconsider. After watching you slide off your dress,
 your conterpart undoes her leather belt, turning her back on you.

 "In my experience, men are stupid. Whenever they lay eyes on scantily
 clad young ladies, they get careless. You'll be a more interesting
 case study, because your desire stems from the alsanine lacing my
 perfume. Enchanting stuff. I want to be in good shape for my
 appointment. Would you mind easing my back pains for me?"

 The mysterious beauty takes off her red dress, tossing it over her
 shoulder. Now completely clotheless, she bends over a washbasin,
 arching her back.

 The oriental beauty gives you a smile.

>rub back
 befo


 The odour of perfume becomes stronger as you approach the woman's
 back, sapping your reserves of willpower. Your hands clamp around her
 firm shoulders, and you can't stop rubbing. The woman spins to face
 you, placing a smooth, brown leg in your hand, enticing you to
 squeeze.

 Eventually, you break free of her spell, and let go in revulsion. It's
 then that you see the knife. Odd, she didn't have it when you walked
 in. Your thoughts are sharply interrupted as she slides the weapon
 under your bra strap, turning it so the blade digs into your skin.

 "Don't be shy. They all feel afraid, helpless. It's knowing that they
 can't do a thing, that they're going to die staring at my beautiful
 face. Toshigi will feel the same, too. Shall we say a lover's
 farewell?"

 A six-inch knife, made entirely of brass and curved like a scimitar.
 One side is engraved with sections of mistletoe motif, an exact match
 with the fastener from which the blade was detached. In summary:
 light, lethal and easy to conceal, the perfect assassin's weapon.

>kiss woman

 You hug the oriental woman closer, parting your lips. Somewhat
 surprisingly, she pushes you away.

 "Didn't your mother tell you never to kiss Mistletoe? You've been a
 sweet little diversion. I ought to show you my ultimate climax. Come
 over here. Don't worry. You won't remember a thing."

 The woman calling herself Mistletoe sits down on the washbasin,
 lifting her legs and arcing them apart. She presses hard on your
 shoulders, making you kneel down on the floor. Her scented thighs
 close tightly around your neck. The woman leans forward, her face an
 inch in front of yours.

 You can't breathe. Mistletoe's aromic drug has rendered you powerless.
 All you can do is watch her smile, listen to her whistle, and wait
 until...

 the pinewood cubicle doors are closed to, the porcelain washbasins are
 spotless, and not a single tap has been left turned on.

 A sickly wad of pink bubblegum mars an otherwise clean mirror.

 You can also see a wrecked dining chair here.

 You come round, confused as you look in the mirror. Why are there
 bruises around your neck? Why aren't you wearing your evening dress?
 Why don't you remember how you ended up on the washroom floor, with

 Ever since that night eight years ago, memories have haunted your
 sleep: katana flashing through the air, your mother's executioner
 wiping it clean, remarks he made to your father as you tasted your
 first mouthful of seawater.

 "A detective with the ACPD, and to think you had my complete trust. We
 all make mistakes, Mister Flint. Yours were to have a wife and
 daughter. They would have lived long, happy lives had you accepted my
 payoff and walked away."


 Drowning (in the Atlantic ocean)
 You can't swim. In thirteen years, you never learned how.

 Not that it would make any difference. No teenage schoolgirl could hold

 Roof, south side
 A chilly December breeze blows in from the ocean. Flakes of snow have
 settled on the concrete, fewer and fewer melting as the temperature

 rooftop edges.

 A ventilation tower rises from this section of the roof.

>go down
 You climb into the ventilation duct. As you descend, it gets warmer.

 Penthouse Suite (in the ventilation duct)
 Moonlight enters from above, reflecting off a curved section of pipe
 which bends westwards past a closed ventilation grille.

 Marble steps rise to the penthouse jacuzzi, flanked by statues in
 samurai battle armour. The water is boiling hot, the air stiflingly
 humid. Wisps of white steam spread out as they ascend, lingering clouds
 of thick mist which reduce the shine of oriental lanterns to faint
 glimmers.

 Sliding doors to the east and west are just about visible through the
 hazy mist. Discarded next to the latter are a short-skirted red dress
 and a dinner jacket.

 Laughter from the jacuzzi. A woman's voice, hollowly soft and gentle.

 "You've been a bad boy, Toshigi. Wanting to separate yourself from the
 cartel to pursue your own pleasures. I've had my mind on you for some
 time. Thinking about how you and I could become-- close friends. I saw
 you staring at my legs all the way through my father's last meeting.
 You'll die looking at them. Most men do."

 You've heard her voice before-- of course, in the washroom! All the
 ugly details come back. Takamura won't be alive for much longer, but
 there's still the matter of his superiors. Somewhere along the line,
 someone has to pay for what he did.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine dress
 White, misty steam obscures your vision. You can make out a vague
 shadowy shape, which might be a short-skirted red dress, but nothing
 else.

 Mistletoe whistles a brief tune.

>out
 You can see through the wire mesh but, alas, cannot squeeze through.

>examine mesh
 A rectangular criss-cross of thin wire mesh, with an openable latch
 fixed to one side. The grille is a foot square, wide enough for an
 agile, healthy, young lady such as yours truly. The penthouse jacuzzi
 is underneath the grille.

 More noises you'd rather not hear.

>open latch
 You slide back the latch. With nothing to support it, the grille swings
 open.

 The scent becomes stronger: daffodils, pollen blowing in the breeze.
 Your mother calls out, beckoning you to join her for a swim. Without
 thinking, you dive into the lake. Mercedes tosses back her raven-black
 hair, her red lipstick glistening in the afternoon sun. Wait a minute--
 wasn't she blonde, your mother?

 Penthouse Suite (in the jacuzzi)
 Steaming hot rapids churn in the water, whirlpools splashing over your
 face. Out of the white mist, there comes a man: Toshigi Takamura. His
 neck is bruised, and his eyes bulge in their sockets. His body
 disappears into the haze.

 Soft, manicured hands massage your shoulders. The steam parts,
 condensing on the oriental beauty's face. She smiles, swimming round in
 front of you. Her wet legs slide along your neck. Mistletoe wades in
 the jacuzzi, whistling as she squeezes her legs tighter, and tighter,
 and tighter. And this time, she never stops.

 Roof, south side
 A chilly December breeze blows in from the ocean. Flakes of snow have
 settled on the concrete, fewer and fewer melting as the temperature
 continues to fall. Four steep triangular quadrants slant down from the

 A flagpole extends towards the eastern bay, flying Yamitsi's standard.

>examine flagpole
 A ten metre long steel pole, rising at a thirty degree incline from the
 edge of the roof. Yamitsi's standard flies at its highpoint, supported
 on a cable which runs up the length of the shaft.

>SAVE
>cf7
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>stand on flagpole
 You're not a tightrope walker!

>examine cable
 Strong, flexible, and plastic-- there's enough cable here to lie twice
 along the flagpole. Due to its rough nature, climbing it unaided
 wouldn't be an impossible task, even in such slippery conditions as
 these. Near the pole's base, the outer fibres have snapped, and the
 cord is but millimetres thick.

>examine standard
 Yamitsi have modernised their standard for the twenty-first century: a
 hologram on a black matte background. In the moonlight, the company's
 logo appears light purple, then turquoise, bronze, magenta. As the wind
 direction changes, so does the colour.

>go up

 You're directly above the lift shaft. The emergency hatch is open.

>go down
 You descend the ladder, dropping down onto the stationary lift.

 Lift Shaft
 In areas such as this, running costs are kept to a minimum, half the
 reason for the red maintenance lighting. The lift is a new cableless
 model, working on the principle of electromagnetism. Power is regulated
 by a series of junction boxes mounted on low friction rails.

 Your torn evening dress hangs from the lower rungs on an emergency

 You can also see a toilet brush and a crumpled leaflet here.

 You bang your head on the closed lift doors.

 You insert the end of the toilet brush into the groove, and whilst
 avoiding the bristles like the plague, pry the lift doors apart.

 Cocktail Reception
 Chirping gizmos welcome you, in their gratingly digitised opinions, to
 the best party of all time. You'd have to disagree. Yamitsi products
 may be many things, but they're not Christmas decorations. Events are
 centred around a globe, which you can circumnavigate to the southeast
 and southwest.

 One exits through lift doors on the north side, or if you're feeling
 energetic, an adjacent stairwell descends twenty-four stories to the
 lobby.

 Ping! The lift doors slide closed.

 You press the call button. A short while later, you hear a high pitched

>go north
 You step into the waiting lift.

 Lift
 For better or worse, the decorators themed the lift interior on a
 circuit board. Let's see: yellow on green is an awful colour
 combination, electrical components make dreadful scenery, and you're
 forced to endure a continuous low pitched hum, allegedly the sound made
 by conducting wires. Yes, definitely for the worse.

 You choose your floor by operating a panel of buttons. That's if you're
 able to concentrate for all the noise.

>press 1
 It takes a few moments to reach your destination. The lift doors slide

>go south
 You exit to the lobby.

 Lobby
 The first floor of the Yamitsi building is devoted to the company's
 thirty year history, a showcase of electronic innovation. You walk over
 them, between them, underneath them: computers, gadgets and circuitry
 in windowed compartments. The lift and staircase are to the north,
 opposite the main entrance.

 A uniformed security guard leans on the reception desk, snoring away.

 Ping! The lift doors slide closed.

>examine guard
 He looks none too pleased with his lot: legs propped on the reception
 desk, head facing diagonally upwards, mouth open, eyes shut. Every so
 often, he breathes in deeply, letting out the air with a loud snore.
 The only thing that frightens you is the needle gun in his holster.

>take gun
 You'd never use such a murderous weapon. In any case, the needle gun
 will only respond to the security guard's DNA.

>examine gun
 A new and deadly weapon developed by the military, designed to fire
 thin, armour piercing projectiles at ten times the speed of sound. The
 trigger is fitted with a scanner, and can only be depressed by a user
 with specific DNA.

>examine desk
 The reception desk is an inverted pyramid of copper, with the
 well-known YE logo on the four slanting sides. The base-cum-top is
 touch sensitive, allowing use of PAYED: Publically Accessible Yamitsi
 Employee Directory. The guard seems to want the anacronym shortening to
 YED, but never mind that.

>look up marisawa

>open compartment

 Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Deafening sirens wail through the lobby. The
 security guard jerks awake, immediately going for his weapon. Company
 policy soon becomes clear: shoot intruders on sight.

 Phut! The needle severs your spinal cord, paralysing you from the neck
 down. All you can do is turn your head away, and listen out for the
 second, fatal, shot.

 Two conducting metal slabs cleverly placed on different compartments,

 the grille.

 The scent becomes stronger: daffodils, pollen blowing in the breeze.
 Your mother calls out, beckoning you to join her for a swim. Without
 thinking, you dive into the lake. Mercedes tosses back her raven-black
 hair, her red lipstick glistening in the afternoon sun. Wait a minute--
 wasn't she blonde, your mother?

 Penthouse Suite (in the jacuzzi)
 Steaming hot rapids churn in the water, whirlpools splashing over your
 face. Out of the white mist, there comes a man: Toshigi Takamura. His
 neck is bruised, and his eyes bulge in their sockets. His body
 disappears into the haze.

 Soft, manicured hands massage your shoulders. The steam parts,
 condensing on the oriental beauty's face. She smiles, swimming round in
 front of you. Her wet legs slide along your neck. Mistletoe wades in
 the jacuzzi, whistling as she squeezes her legs tighter, and tighter,
 and tighter. And this time, she never stops.

 Penthouse Suite (in the ventilation duct)
 Moonlight enters from above, reflecting off a curved section of pipe
 which bends westwards past a closed ventilation grille.

 Marble steps rise to the penthouse jacuzzi, flanked by statues in
 samurai battle armour. The water is boiling hot, the air stiflingly
 humid. Wisps of white steam spread out as they ascend, lingering clouds
 of thick mist which reduce the shine of oriental lanterns to faint
 glimmers.

 Sliding doors to the east and west are just about visible through the
 hazy mist. Discarded next to the latter are a short-skirted red dress
 and a dinner jacket.

 President's Office (in the ventilation duct)
 Unseen creepy crawlies scuttle about in the darkness east of you. This

 Yamitsi have always been advocates of isolation and precision, and it
 shows. The windowless office of their head honcho is trapezoid shaped,
 widening to the east and ending at a sliding door, soundproofed and
 airtight. Arranged in the precise centre of the room is the
 presidential desk, an antique from feudal Japan.

 On the president's desk are an answering machine, a woman's laptop and

 That'd be a computer, then. You're fairly sure this machine is the
 property of a lady. The display is heart shaped and the flowery pink,
 hard to read, font has a definite feminine feel. Those observations
 noted, you also see two slots: a long and thin one, and another which
 is square.

 Both of the slots are empty.

>examine memos
 Leafs of notepaper stacked in slapdash piles. General messiness aside,
 deposits of nail varnish suggest a certain oriental woman has been
 looking through them. Whether or not she found what she was searching
 for-- well, she's next door, if you want to ask.

>take laptop

 The dress is crimson, the colour of blood. Three quarters of the skirt

 Inside the jacket's torn lining is an optical datachip.

>examine datachip
 Small microchips inside the inch-wide black cube store data optically,

 Roof, south side
 A chilly December breeze blows in from the ocean. Flakes of snow have
 settled on the concrete, fewer and fewer melting as the temperature
 continues to fall. Four steep triangular quadrants slant down from the

 rooftop edges.

 A flagpole extends towards the eastern bay, flying Yamitsi's standard.

 Female voices from below. Both quite young, from the sound of things.

 "Who's this visitor? Another one of Toshigi's playthings?"

 "She scares me. That look she gave him, like an eagle sizing up her
 prey. Still, he seemed comfortable. He usually is around women. I'd
 better follow his orders, and keep an eye on his office. Stay alert,
 and don't be using your portavid. We both know what happens to ladies
 who fail to meet his requirements."

 The whoosh of a door moving on its bearings, then silence.

>take knife
 You take the curved brass knife out of your bra.

>cut cable
 (with the curved brass knife)
 Keeping one foot on the roof, you lean along the flagpole, elbow
 wrapped tightly around the shaft. Ice-cold steel bites into your skin,
 snowflakes obscuring your vision. Fortunately, you have the endurance
 to hold on and slice the cable free. Yamitsi's standard blows off the
 cord.

 You slide the end of the cable underneath the strap of your bra, tying
 it into a simple knot.

>jump
 You take hold of the cable, abseiling down to the penthouse suite
 balcony, only to land two metres behind a patrolling bodyguard.

 Balcony
 The balcony overlooks Atlantic City's scenic harbour, the vast distance
 reducing cargo barges and cruise liners to the scale of model boats.
 Artistic stone rails border the platform, ornamental carvings depicting
 Japanese samurai in battle. A sliding mirrored door to the west
 connects with the penthouse suite.

 Takamura is known to pay his escort girls well for their services, and
 the woman on the balcony performs hers admirably. Hearing your feet
 scrape stone, the lady bodyguard spins around, legs braced apart and
 needle gun ready to fire.

>zap guard
 (with the compact taser)
 The bodyguard's senses are acute. Hearing movement, she looks up at the
 grille, raising her needle gun. Fortunately, you have already fired the
 taser. The wire strikes her exposed chest. With nothing to protect
 herself from the shock, she quickly succumbs, falling unconscious
 before she hits the ground.

 [Your score has just gone up by four points.]

>go down
 You lower yourself into the presidential office, leaping down from the
 desk.

 President's Office
 Yamitsi have always been advocates of isolation and precision, and it
 shows. The windowless office of their head honcho is trapezoid shaped,
 widening to the east and ending at a sliding door, soundproofed and
 airtight. Arranged in the precise centre of the room is the
 presidential desk, an antique from feudal Japan.

 On the president's desk are an answering machine, a woman's laptop and
 several piles of memos.

 A female bodyguard has been zapped unconscious.

 Above you, on the ceiling, is an open ventilation grille.

>touch machine's screen
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine phone
 The vidphone case is flat, three inches by ten. A bewildering array of
 features are crammed into the small space: a QWERTY keyboard, a volume
 amplifier switch, a readable liquid crystal display, and a camera lens.
 Rather unfairly, no video screen is provided. Sticking bubblegum on the
 glass eye has evened things out a little. The vidphone's keyboard is
 brightly lit.

>examine display

 A sequence of letters and numbers: ACYB25P.

>examine switch
 An amplifier to boost the audio signal, presently switched off.

>turn on switch
 You switch on the vidphone's volume amplifier.

>open door
 You slide open the white panelled door. Muffled noises are audible:
 whistling, splashing water and-- er, other things. The perfume's aroma
 is stronger, too. On the other side, within reach, are a dinner jacket
 and a short-skirted red dress.

>put phone in door
 You place the portable vidphone next to the sliding door, on the

 "You like girls, don't you Toshigi? Tell me, how do I rank among your
 squeezes? I'm sure you'll be-- memorable, even ousting your
 predecessor. Sit back, relax, enjoy yourself. Mistletoe's going to take
 special care of you."

 The laptop reacted as she mentioned her name.

 The laptop prompts you for the first codekey.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>close door
 You slide the white panelled door closed, shutting out the noise-- and
 the smell of perfume.

>examine chip
 Small microchips inside the inch-wide black cube store data optically,
 and more often than not, encode the information using two four-digit
 numbers as the key. You only know all this because you stood in for Amy
 at the science conference. Funny, how she always seems to be needed
 elsewhere.

 The sound of sloshing water is relayed over the answering machine.

 You insert the optical datachip into the relevant slot.

 More of Mistletoe's ramblings. Already, you've had enough.

 You tap the answering machine's video screen. The image fades to black.

>search memos
 Two of the memos seem odd for one reason or another: a "things to do"
 list and some scribbled numbers.

>examine numbers
 Note my change of vidphone number:

   -- Carla

>examine list
 Things to do:

 1) Further check of our accounts
 2) Arrange meeting with Reeves
 3) Lease Venetian apartment to Franco
 4) Liquidate Antoni Nero

 Franco? Antoni? Strange names for Japanese mafiosos. Perhaps there's
 something important hidden within these four casual instructions.

>say fall

 The bodyguard is asleep, hence unable to respond.

 Apparently, that vidphone number doesn't exist.

 A swarm of hashes, exclamation marks and dollar signs fills the laptop

 nonsense, but the file as a whole remains indecipherable.

 A sequence of letters and numbers: ACYB25P.

>examine laptop
 That'd be a computer, then. You're fairly sure this machine is the
 property of a lady. The display is heart shaped and the flowery pink,
 hard to read, font has a definite feminine feel. Those observations
 noted, you also see two slots: a long and thin one, and another which
 is square.

 An optical disc and datachip have been inserted into their relevant

 Zeros and ones scroll on the laptop's display. The decoded file is a
 sequence of binary digits. More powerful decryption algorithms are set
 in motion, converting the data into building schematics. The drawings

 Four you know without having to resort to the captions: the history
 museum, the plaza theatre, the memorial clock tower, and terminal #4 at
 W.P. Browne airport. The other two have you stumped. One could be a
 cruise liner, you suppose. But a temple-- where in Atlantic City might
 that be?

 You climb into the ventilation duct via the presidential desk.

 President's Office (in the ventilation duct)
 Unseen creepy crawlies scuttle about in the darkness east of you. This
 region is kept clear by light shining in through an open ventilation
 grille.

 Yamitsi have always been advocates of isolation and precision, and it
 shows. The windowless office of their head honcho is trapezoid shaped,
 widening to the east and ending at a sliding door, soundproofed and
 airtight. Arranged in the precise centre of the room is the
 presidential desk, an antique from feudal Japan.

 On the president's desk are an answering machine, a woman's laptop and
 several piles of memos.

 A female bodyguard has been zapped unconscious.

 Steam draughts into the office, alerting you to the danger. For a split
 second, you see her silhouette: a tall, dark female shape not unlike
 the oriental woman herself. Mistletoe doesn't make a sound, but the
 scent of daffodils lingers, so perhaps you shouldn't.

>go east
 Rumbling metal behind you-- Mistletoe is close. The frequency of the
 bumps is so high. You could never crawl that fast.

 Penthouse Suite (in the ventilation duct)
 Moonlight enters from above, reflecting off a curved section of pipe
 which bends westwards past a closed ventilation grille.

 Marble steps rise to the penthouse jacuzzi, flanked by statues in
 samurai battle armour. The water is boiling hot, the air stiflingly
 humid. Wisps of white steam spread out as they ascend, lingering clouds
 of thick mist which reduce the shine of oriental lanterns to faint
 glimmers.

 Sliding doors to the east and west are just about visible through the
 hazy mist. Discarded next to the latter are a dinner jacket and a
 short-skirted red dress.

>go up
 Water drips onto your back from above. Strange, aren't you inside--
 then you see it, or rather her, hanging like a spider from the duct
 ceiling. Mistletoe's arms and legs are spread wide, pressed firmly
 against the rivets. The huntress waits, observing her prey. Trapped in
 a narrow space, the scent is stronger than ever.

 Your mind floats, numbed by the aroma. When you awake, you find
 yourself...

 Penthouse Suite (in the jacuzzi)
 Steaming hot rapids churn in the water, whirlpools splashing over your
 face. Out of the white mist, there comes a man: Toshigi Takamura. His
 neck is bruised, and his eyes bulge in their sockets. His body
 disappears into the haze.

 Soft, manicured hands massage your shoulders. The steam parts,
 condensing on the oriental beauty's face. She smiles, swimming round in
 front of you. Her wet legs slide along your neck. Mistletoe wades in
 the jacuzzi, whistling as she squeezes her legs tighter, and tighter,
 and tighter. And this time, she never stops.

 You jump back, scrambling over the edge of the bathtub and wiping the
 loose foam from your hair. Over your violent coughing, you hear bumping
 metal. Sounds as if Mistletoe's directly above, about to dive into the
 jacuzzi any moment now.

 Sliding doors to the east and west are just about visible through the
 hazy mist. Discarded next to the latter are a dinner jacket and a

 Above you, on the ceiling, is an open ventilation grille.

>take taser
 You take the compact taser out of your bra.

>zap water
 (with the compact taser)
 The taser's projectile extends into the jacuzzi, its tube vibrating as
 electric charge is fed down the wire. Bursts of light, alternately long
 and short, alter the steam's colour from white to blue. From the water
 you hear hissing, buzzing and crackling. But not one scream of pain.
 Takamura is dead.

 Mistletoe waves at you from the ventilation grille, before retreating
 west along the tunnel. The taser has taken as much feedback as it can:
 the power core burns out, sparks fly, and its tube turns from polished
 silver to charred black.

 The ever present scent of daffodils precedes Mistletoe into the room.
 She slides the white panelled door shut, partly splitting her legs and
 spinning her arms in circles. She cartwheels around the penthouse
 suite, finishing up in the jacuzzi. Left in her wake is a trail, the
 irresistable smell of her perfume.

 Roof, east side
 A chilly December breeze blows in from the ocean. Flakes of snow have
 settled on the concrete, fewer and fewer melting as the temperature
 continues to fall. Four steep triangular quadrants slant down from the
 roof's centre, ending abruptly at straight, fenceless, death-defying
 rooftop edges.

 A flagpole extends towards the eastern bay, its cable cut free.

 Artificially generated wind rushes into your face as you climb onto the
 roof. A helicopter gunship hovers above. Through the glare of its
 searchlight you see a familiar bearded man behind the controls: the
 Baron.

 "Not quite what you expected to find? Well, imagine my surprise at
 watching you climb onto the roof, almost completely naked. Mistletoe
 does that all the time, but she's my daughter. And you're that
 television reporter, the one who fancies herself as a regular Crusader.
 Nice meeting you, Miss Flint. Goodbye."

 The powerful machine gun fixed to the gunship's chassis swivels around,
 locking onto the flagpole. Cannon rounds rip through the shaft, slicing
 the pole in two near its base. The cable yanks taut, tightening around
 your bra.

 "Steel, a mixture of iron and carbon. Very heavy, as I'm sure you
 know."

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>take knife
 You take the curved brass knife out of your bra.

 You fall flat on your chest, stuffing knocked out of your body.

>cut cable with knife
 You slip the knife between cable and bra, cutting yourself free. The
 cord coils up as it slides off the roof. Breathless and relieved to
 have the burden lifted from your back, you turn, about to get to your
 feet. Instead, you find yourself lying at someone elses: bare, brown,
 and dripping wet.

 The Baron's voice booms over the gunship's speaker.

 "Things look grim, Miss Flint. I don't get along well with do-gooders.
 Crime is the way forward. The law breaking majority would be overjoyed
 to see the end of grumbling preachers championing the cause of
 righteousness. Mistletoe, kill her for me, would you? I'd like a little
 entertainment. There's a good girl."

 Mistletoe grabs your hips, pulling you up into a standing position.

>go north
 Mistletoe pursues you to the north side of the roof.

 Roof, north side
 A chilly December breeze blows in from the ocean. Flakes of snow have
 settled on the concrete, fewer and fewer melting as the temperature
 continues to fall. Four steep triangular quadrants slant down from the
 roof's centre, ending abruptly at straight, fenceless, death-defying
 rooftop edges.

 You're directly above the lift shaft. The emergency hatch is open.

 Cold hands press on your shoulders, pushing you over the brink of the
 shaft. You see the rusted rungs of the ladder, your torn dress-- and
 then spinning stars.

 Lift Shaft
 In areas such as this, running costs are kept to a minimum, half the
 reason for the red maintenance lighting. The lift is a new cableless
 model, working on the principle of electromagnetism. Power is regulated
 by a series of junction boxes mounted on low friction rails.

 Your torn evening dress hangs from the lower rungs on an emergency
 ladder.

 You can also see a toilet brush and a crumpled leaflet here.

 The sound of windscreen wipers. No, Mistletoe's legs scraping as she
 slides down the shaft of the ladder. She lets go, straightening out.
 Her two footed lunge is unstoppable, thumping into your chest. The next
 thing you see is a junction box, panel door caved in from the impact of
 your skull.

 Mistletoe throws you against the opposite wall. Out of breath, you
 slide to the floor. Tossing back her hair, the oriental woman sits on
 your neck. The effects of her perfume are negated by the oily smell,
 and there is nothing to take your mind off the pain. Mistletoe develops
 a fatal crush around your throat.

>take brush
 You just about manage to pick up the toilet brush.

>hit mistletoe with brush
 Mistletoe smiles as the bristles touch her skin.

>hit box
 You can't reach the junction box.

 Mistletoe rubs melting ice over her body.

>hit box with brush
 You swing the toilet brush sideways, opening the panel door.

 There is lots of circuitry inside the box, but you don't have time to
 figure out what any of it does. Your hope lies squarely-- or
 octagonally, with a red button in the centre. Large, unlabelled. The
 shape reminds you of a stop sign.

 Mistletoe leans back, whistling to herself.

>hit button with brush
 Using the harder bristles, you depress the red button. It sinks into
 its socket with a loud clunk.

 Flickering red maintenance lights, accompanied by low pitched droning:
 the sound of a power grid shutting down. Mistletoe glances around,
 unsure of herself.

>wait
 Time passes.

 The red lights flicker briefly, and then go out. With no magnetic field
 to hold it up, the lift-- and floor drops away from underneath your
 feet.

 You and Mistletoe descend together, her legs tight around your throat.
 She stays the distance before safety overrides cut in, emergency brakes
 screeching against the rails. So sharply was the fall interrupted that
 Mistletoe is hurled upwards, her rapidly twisted thighs breaking your
 neck.

 Mistletoe's lubricated legs slide off your neck, the oriental woman
 falling down the shaft. Orange sparks fly from the rails as emergency
 brakes cut in, the lift screeching to a stop. In the dim light, you can
 see Mistletoe beginning to climb back up, arms and legs at full
 stretch, pressed into the corners.

 You don't hang around to see if she makes it, using the brush, dress
 and finally the ladder to return to the roof.

 Roof, north side

 A helicopter gunship hovers above, searchlight trained on you.

 "You! Where's my daughter!? Well, it seems we have a nosy Nellie, a
 lady with a habit of springing surprises, a woman of many hidden
 talents. Let's put them to the test. How well do you dance, Miss Flint?
 I'll choose the tempo."

 You're directly above the lift shaft. The emergency hatch is open.

 A helicopter gunship hovers above, searchlight trained on you.

 The gunship flies away from the roof, banking round to commence an
 attack run.

 The gunship is a dangerous toy in the Baron's hands, an armour plated
 helicopter which wouldn't look out of place at a military installation.
 As its main weapon, the aircraft has a rotary cannon. Without doubt,
 there are other nasty pieces of work housed inside the aircraft's
 wings.

 The helicopter gathers speed as it approaches, main cannon armed and
 ready.

 Disgraceful behaviour like that can have dire consequences, as you are
 about to learn the hard way...


     *** You have succumbed to the dark side ***


 Only kidding! But consider that a warning, young lady.

 The Baron reaches for the firing key.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a curved brass knife
   your mother's silver chain (being worn)
   a gold bracelet (closed, and being worn)
   some underwear (being worn)
     a portable vidphone (with bubblegum over the camera lens)
     an optical disc

 The Baron straffes the concrete rooftop, his laughter indistinguishable
 from the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire. Cannon rounds fly harmlessly past,
 about a metre or so separating you and the smoky trail left behind.

>close hatch
 The emergency hatch screeches closed.

 The gunship flies away from the roof, banking round to commence an
 attack run.

>put knife in loops
 You can't see any such thing.

>put knife in hoops
 You place the curved brass knife inside the iron hoops.

 The helicopter gathers speed as it approaches, main cannon armed and

>go south
 The gunship's searchlight tracks you to the south side of the roof.

 Roof, south side
 A chilly December breeze blows in from the ocean. Flakes of snow have
 settled on the concrete, fewer and fewer melting as the temperature
 continues to fall. Four steep triangular quadrants slant down from the
 roof's centre, ending abruptly at straight, fenceless, death-defying
 rooftop edges.

 A ventilation tower rises from this section of the roof. The corrugated
 iron cap been pushed aside, allowing access to a circular opening
 below.

 The Baron reaches for the firing key.

 "I wouldn't be climbing down there, Miss Flint. Contrary to the opinion
 of movie producers, it's impossible to outrun an explosion in a
 confined space. Step away from the tower, and allow me to demonstrate."

 The Baron does exactly that, raising a finger and stabbing at his
 control panel. Rockets whistle through the air, curving, flying
 downwards into the ventilation tower. Orange fire mushrooms from the
 open pipe, blowing off the iron cap. From behind the spreading black
 smoke, you hear the tower collapse in on itself.

 "Too bad about my luxury penthouse suite. On the other hand, it takes
 care of my associate's funeral. Cremation was what he wanted, after
 all. Shall we proceed?"

 The smoke thins, and you see a tower of twisted scrap metal beyond.

>examine cap
 A conical section of thick corrugated iron, sixty-five centimetres in
 diameter, used for blocking out rain and snow. The gunship's rockets
 scorched the inside surface, but other than that, the metal held up
 reasonably well.

 The Baron straffes the concrete rooftop, his laughter indistinguishable
 from the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire. Phew! That one was much closer. You
 felt bits of stone thud into your leg.

>hide under cap
 The opening is blocked by scrap metal.

 The gunship flies away from the roof, banking round to commence an
 attack run.

>take cap
 You take the corrugated iron cap from amongst the scrap metal.

 The helicopter gathers speed as it approaches, main cannon armed and
 ready.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>hide under cap
 You place the iron cap on the roof, crawling behind and pointing the
 tip of the cone towards the approaching gunship. Well, it blocks out
 the light-- hopefully it will do the same to high-velocity cannon
 rounds.

 The drone of the helicopter gets increasingly louder, and then
 everything comes at once: light streaming past the cone, rattling
 cannon fire, chips of concrete flying around your feet. The pressure
 mounts on the corrugated iron cap. One of the rounds breaks through,
 grazing your arm, forcing you to let go.

 Resembling an oversized seive, the iron cap rolls off the roof. You are
 trapped. All of your escape routes have been cut off, and you have no
 means of protecting yourself from cannons, rockets, or whatever else
 the Baron has to send your way. There's nothing you can-- Wait! That
 ambient golden glow. It must be...

 You trace the source of the angelic halo, looking up at the chest of a
 dazzling stallion, riding impossibly on thin air: the golden horse.
 Atlantic City's lady crimefighter pulls up overhead, lowering a rope
 for your intended use.

 "Lisa, get on!"

 The gunship flies away from the roof, banking round to commence an
 attack run.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>go up
 You grab onto the rope, feeling the effects of centrifugal force as it
 lifts you skywards. Up close the golden horse looks so real:
 magnificent tail swaying from side to side, flailing hooves kicking air
 in your face, mane beautifully combed, flowing in the wind. Solid gold
 gauntlets reach out, heaving you inside. And...

 Golden Horse
 A helicopter cockpit. State of the art controls and a hi-tech interface
 are poor compensation for the mystery and sense of wonder that were
 cruelly snatched away when the illusion was broken. That's all the
 golden horse ever was: an illusion.

 And the Crusader? The golden halo around her is impenetratable, just
 like it was for her horse. But underneath, is she another illusion? You
 look to your heroine for an answer.

 "Your mind told you none of it was real. Horses cannot fly, golden
 statues don't walk. But you wanted to believe in me. It gave you hope.
 Would an ordinary woman in a helicopter have done the same?"

 Her question hangs. She jumps out of her seat, clutching her trademark
 Staff of Justice. You follow her gaze: Mistletoe waits on the roof,
 flexing her arms and legs in anticipation. The Crusader exits the
 cockpit, grabbing hold of a hooked cable protruding from the horse's
 nose.

 "You win, Mistletoe. It's time I consigned father and daughter to a
 padded cell. Stay here Lisa, unless you want to play the heroine. Rex,
 fire the laser at that gunship and target the claws at-- Mistletoe."

 Rex beeps in acknowledgement, extending the rope down to the roof. The
 oriental lady blows her mismatched opponent a kiss, the two women
 preparing to do battle. The laser beam reflects uselessly off the
 gunship's armour.

 "Nice laser display. How about some real weapons to test my skill?"

 Mistletoe strikes the first blow, toppling the Crusader with a sliding
 kick. The heroine rolls to her feet, swinging out with her Staff of
 Justice.

>rex, shoot cannon
 (with the laser beam)
 The laser beam slices away the main cannon's support. The bulk of it
 falls off, disintegrating into aluminium rods and screws.

 Mistletoe skips over the low swinging staff.

 The Baron is furious, angrily stabbing at his control panel.

 "Well, what do we have here? A rent-a-heroine, valiant to the last. Did
 you ever watch television as a child? The story always ends with them
 riding off into the moonlight-- in a blaze of glory!"

 Rockets blast off from inside the gunship's wings, converging towards

 Golden Horse
 Behind the hologram facade, the golden horse is a super-sleek
 helicopter powered by jet engines. Most of the cockpit is occupied by
 the aircraft's computer, Rex. Displayed on the main screen is a
 top-down plan of Atlantic City.

 The externally mounted extras are impressive: a laser beam, a grappling
 hook and a radio antenna. Warm air escapes through the raised
 windshield.

 On the roof below, the Crusader engages Mistletoe in hand to hand
 combat. Flying above them in a helicopter gunship, the Baron strokes
 his chin as he watches the action unfold.

 The Crusader strikes Mistletoe a glancing blow.

 "Oh deary, deary me. Whatever will you do without your precious staff?
 That's my girl, Mistletoe. The Crusader has cost the cartel dearly in
 the past. I think we owe her a special climax, don't you?"

>rex, get staff
 The claws scoop up the Crusader's staff, pulling it up to the golden
 horse.

 The Crusader's feet step within a metre of the rooftop edge. She tenses
 herself, golden halo shining defiantly as Mistletoe moves in for the
 kill.

>rex, give staff to crusader
 "Unable to comply."

 The two women each attempt feints and dodges to gain a fight winning
 advantage. It's Mistletoe that breaks the deadlock, landing a knock out
 punch which floors her opponent. The oriental woman jumps on the fallen
 Crusader, arms pinning her to the ground. With a glower of triumph,
 Mistletoe delivers her poisoned kiss.

 Justice drops into her outstretched hand.

 Atlantic City's heroine has discovered a new lease of life. With
 blinding speed, she spins her Staff of Justice, following up with a
 series of swings and thrusts which repel the stunned Mistletoe to the
 opposite side of the roof. The Baron is far less concerned than his
 daughter over the shift in power.

 "Let her go. Let that golden armour of hers rot as the poison floods
 through her veins. She is doomed to watch her beautiful city do the
 same as we enter the new millennium. She will lie on her death bed,
 knowing that she has failed. That her efforts have achieved nothing,
 that she is nothing! Come, child. Leave her be."

 Mistletoe, still angry at defeat, cartwheels into the waiting
 helicopter. Waving farewell, the Baron pilots the gunship towards the
 ocean. The Crusader's rush of adrenaline was only temporary. She falls
 flat on her face, unable to prevent her slide down the roof.

 The Holy Land has been desecrated with the blood of westerners: fallen
 warriors, armour-clad bodies lying prone on the rolling grasslands,
 pennants of their king fastened to half-buried lances. Stray horses
 sprint towards the horizon. The sun rises beyond, a peaceful dawn for

 A western warrior lies face down at your feet, dressed in gold battle
 armour.

 One horse has held its ground, a remarkably fine beast with a golden
 mane.

 You lever your dirty hands underneath the warrior, turning his body
 over. Except he's a she. Her curved armour, hairless chin and
 beautiful facial complexion are proof enough that the westerner is
 female. The woman coughs blood as she sits up on the grass, fluently
 speaking your language.

 "You are shocked to see a young lady dressed for battle, yes? The
 truth is, long ago, I too was a peasant wench. You won't believe me
 now, but some day, you will don my golden armour, and fight injustice

 The female warrior takes the blade of her broadsword, spinning it
 vertically on the palm of her hand. It blurs from grey to gold, flat
 to cylindrical. When its rotation has ceased, she holds a familiar,
 glowing rod which she drops onto the grass: the Staff of Justice.

 "Do you accept the heroine's mantle? If so, then pick up the staff."

>examine staff

 In Atlantic City, the staff is a legend, a half metre rod of gold with
 which the Crusader tackles her criminal foes. Roughly every second or
 so, it glows, bright as the sun, before fading to a single pulsating
 glyph. The inscribed runes light up in sequence: eastern script,
 supposedly the source of the heroine's power.

>take staff

 As you take the golden staff, you feel your wrist vibrate with power.
 The female warrior collapses onto the grass, dying next to her
 brothers. Her voice is weak, issuing simple instructions in western
 speech. Occasionally, she says an eastern word which you understand.

 "...have to know..."

 You're floating out of your body, looking down on an eastern girl
 attending to a fallen enemy from the west-- and that's where you go,
 west into the land of King Victor III, the realm of farms and castles.
 The clouds part, revealing a coastal Atlantic town, war galleons
 moored in the harbour.

 Slowly, you descend to the battlements of a watchtower. A woman in
 gold waits on the roof, loincloth blowing in the sea breeze. You know
 who this lady is: mother of the sisterhood of crusaders, the
 matriarch. Her voice compels you to obey.

 "Come home, sister."

 Then she is gone, and you have returned to the battlefield.

 No mistake. The westerner is definately female, and not much older

 "So child, you have come home. It is time for us-- or rather you, to

 whichever valves the inlet and outlet hoses happen to be connected to.
 Once everything has been properly set up, all one has to do is switch

 Police cordons keep traffic off the bridge, leaving you alone with a

 It was a mistake, switching off your halo. You were certain he'd jump

 "You want to know why I'm here? Very well, I'll show you."

 The suicide jumper unwraps the bag, discarding the brown paper wrapper
 into the gorge. Without looking back, he raises his treasured
 possession to the heavens, a fitting gesture since he is holding a
 Torah scroll: the cornerstone of Jewish religion, the word of God.

 "Half a person's wealth is worthless. That is what my peers taught me.
 For five hundred years, my family owned two of these scrolls. But I am
 unworthy of them, allowing the other to be stolen, perhaps lost
 forever. I swore to guard it with my life. Now I must keep my promise,
 and face the Lord's judgement."

 For a religious man, he lacks a lot of faith: the other scroll was
 recovered by the ACPD last night. But it's sitting in an evidence
 locker several miles away. The suicide jumper needs to see it now, or

 The Crusader's golden glow flickers around the walls of the chamber, a
 spherical cavern hollowed out from beneath the tower. She wears the
 mantle of a heroine, a monumentally uplifting aura of love, trust and
 friendship.

 When you look into her eyes, you see your mother. And in a sense,
 that's who she is. The matriarch, first of the Crusaders, an ageless
 warrior, burdened with the task of teaching her descendants.

 "It would appear you are ready, Madame Crusader. Before you take up
 the reins of the golden horse, I have two more pieces of advice to
 give you. First, the Staff of Justice is so powerful a ten year old
 girl could wield it at no disadvantage. Second, a true heroine would
 sacrifice her life if there were no other option."

 The matriarch has finished. Now it's up to you: Lisa Flint against the
 Baron and his five underlings. Without wanting to sound melodramatic,
 the fate of Atlantic City rests with the Crusader. And right now,

 You've intruded on Big Brother's lair, a spymaster's paradise
 outfitted with the latest in surveillance technology. Rows of monitors
 simultaneously screen images recorded by digital television cameras
 around the museum. From the discomfort of his stool, the controller is
 able to seek out intruders via his online network.

 The main console has a futuristic feel, so perhaps the security guard
 is an avid science fiction fan.

 Surprisingly, the guard elects to remain in the foyer.

 "I've had enough tedium for one day. Women are notoriously bad with
 electronics, but those controls are so straightforward even you should
 be able to figure them out. Since five-thirty, all the cameras have
 been kaput. It's down to the female technicians if genericgeekgirl asks me."

 heel of his shoe.

 "Clever minx, isn't she? Hiding an electronic signal jammer right

 The security guard frowns, desperately seeking a flaw in your
 argument. Finally, he is forced to temporarily concede defeat, and
 enters his office to open up the security gates. When he returns, it
 is with springy-stepped vigour.

 "Find all that brainwork challenging? You do realise that women and

 Arthurian legend has played its part in this: the stone from which the
 legendary king drew his fabled Excalibur. According to crudely chipped
 lettering, that was the inspiration, but it looks like an ordinary
 rock to you.

 On the pedestal is Victor III's sword, protected behind a glass case.

>take case
 befo


 Cuddling it to your chest, you lift the glass case off the pedestal.
 The topmost piece comes free: a circular disc which shatters into
 small fragments as it hits the floor. What you're left with is a
 cylinder, hollow at both ends.

 "Charlotte Anne! She's cut the-- oh, it doesn't matter. She couldn't
 have stolen the sword anyway. Hah hah, I bet she got a nasty shock
 when she tried to pull it away. Say, ten thousand volts. Ladies
 shouldn't put their hands where they don't belong, then they might not
 hurt themselves."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine sword
 befo


 The blade is dull in contrast to the guard's embellishment, but that's
 probably to be expected after a three hundred year hiatus sealed
 inside a wine cellar, a long and rough period of underground exile for
 King Victor. Set into the pommel is ten karats worth of raw, uncut
 diamond.

>take sword

 Sniggering to himself, the guard watches you reach for the sword.

 "Has the female population forgotten how to read, now? The current
 flowing along that blade could roast you alive! Admittedly, baked
 Crusader is a mouth watering proposition, but one which would leave an
 undesirable black spot on an otherwise impeccable record. So, if you
 wouldn't mind stepping away..."

 By rolling pin, you don't mean a chef's pastry flattener, but a
 metre-long stick for winding up canvas. Torn cloth rests in a groove,
 presumably all that remains of the waterproof cover of whichever stall
 it came from.

>push sword with pin
 befo


 The guard covers his mouth, chuckling uncontrollably as he watches you
 slide the rolling pin underneath the sword's handle. To rude and
 sarcastic commentary, you flex your arms and heave. You're able to
 lift the blade, but this is solid iron, and its weight is too much for
 your poor wrists to bear.

 You can't hold on, and the hilt slides off the wooden stick. Five
 seconds later, King Victor's sword has bounced several times on the
 stone floor. Your escapades have sent the guard into a frenzy. He
 sprints over, fondling the weapon as if it were a departed lover-- but
 then, anger gives way to confusion.

 "This-- workmanship! It's all wrong! These are modern methods! This
 can't be the sword of Victor the Third! A fake artefact? In my
 museum!? So, Charlotte Anne is a little fortunate, but the other
 exhibits, and the Aztec mask-- no, they cannot possibly be stolen.
 Certainly not by a member of the fair sex, anyway."

 The guard rubs his forehead, trying to come to terms with the loss.

 The base of a pyramid would be more appropriate, but the museum opted
 for a cone instead. Their ineptitude is further compounded by a

 sun god, by the way.

 On the pedestal is the Ankh of Osiris.

 "Only important members of society were allowed to touch the Ankh of
 Osiris. And despite having citywide fame, you are only a woman. Allow
 me, Madame Crusader."

 The security man brushes you aside, radiating self confidence as he
 reaches into the spray painted cylinder. As he grasps the ankh, it
 folds in half, just like a sheet of goldleaf paper. Fuming at the
 nostrils, the guard rips up the imitation amulet into strips of
 confetti.

 "Cardboard!? Miss smartie pants used my own security against me, did
 she? I see, a typical feminine tactic. Charlotte Anne stole two of our
 artefacts!? But she's just a-- a girl! Getting ahead of ourselves,

 In Atlantic City, the staff is a legend, a half metre rod of gold with

 "Wh-- wha-- what!? Impossible! I would have noticed had there-- ah,

 "If she got to the others-- the mask of Xioh'can!"

 Charlotte Anne sits on an ivy-covered staircase.

 The magician snaps her fingers, apparently conjuring a bunch of tulips
 from thin air. She blows away the petals, throwing the flowerless
 stems towards you one by one. In mid-flight, the stalks change shape,
 morphing into party streamers which wrap around your wrists and
 ankles.

 Deprived of the ability to move your limbs, you take a tumble, falling
 onto your back. The Staff of Justice slips from your grasp. Charlotte
 Anne kicks it across the room, and then stops, staring the guard right
 in the eyes. With the style of walking you'd associate with the living
 dead, he trudges off to the south.

 "So, was my assistant obstructive enough? When I delivered my statue,
 he was the genuine prince charming. On the surface, that was. But
 under hypnosis, I ordered him to let loose his selfish and arrogant
 persona. A nasty little helper, wasn't he? If you can make it, my

 Your arms and legs are tightly bound, and the streamers are warm,

 Charlotte Anne removes her top hat, leaning her head forwards. A
 carved piece of ivory drops into her lap: the mask of Xioh'can. The
 lady magician lifts her legs and spins freehand on the pedestal,
 contorting her body to speed herself up. She stops, faces you, climbs
 down-- and, you've guessed it: the mask has vanished.

 "Now you see it, now you don't. That one was a trifle too obvious, but

 Given the museum's pro-scientific bias, the exhibit facing the

 Your crafty nemesis steps out from behind Ernest Daniels' statue,
 unveiling her next deadly set piece: a casino croupier's shoe.

 "Choose a card. Any card!"

 Charlotte Anne sets her trick in motion. Diamond-edged playing cards
 are ejected from the shoe, whistling as they cut through the air.
 You'll be chop-suey if you don't take action soon!

>repel cards

 You focus your mind on the incoming deck, forcing the cards back with
 willpower alone. They stall, dropping to the ground like swatted
 flies. Some of them land face up, and it doesn't take long to realise
 the pictures are all the same: the queen of diamonds. Charlotte Anne
 has a twisted sense of humour, all right.

 The magician takes things in her stride, and with some blindingly
 quick sleight of hand, conjures up a glass marble. Without further
 ado, she throws the sphere downwards, smashing it on the ground.
 Clouds of thick, grey smoke expand across the foyer, and you soon
 become lost in the ensuing darkness.

 You stumble blindly through the smoke, bumping into something large

 the building! Grateful for small mercies, you locate the handle, and
 open the door.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Marketplace</span>
 Merchants who trade here on a daily basis have honoured a century-old
 tradition, finishing early to celebrate the year's end. The market
 stalls are bare, stacked side by side on the moonlit cobblestones. A
 narrow lane begins to the south, and descends bumpily towards the old
 city district.

 Much of the restoration work was funded by Atlantic City's museum of
 history, an institution of worldwide fame situated north of the
 marketplace.

 The golden horse has landed nearby.

 Behind you, the museum doors swing closed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cobbled Lane</span>
 The ruined walls of King Victor's fortress rise toweringly to the east
 and west. Arrow slits polarise incident moonlight into thin beams, but
 it is the Victorian lamp posts that shine the brightest, burning their
 winter fuel during long, dark nights such as this. Too bad the lane is
 closed for repairs, though.

 In the December breeze, the trailer's rear flap rattles to and fro.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mobile Magic Show</span>
 And that's precisely what this trailer is: a transporter of equipment
 capable of switching from harmless to lethal at the drop of Charlotte
 Anne's hat. Yes, from juggling clubs to handkerchiefs to guillotines
 to steel rings, every conceivable item on a stage illusionist's prop
 list is present and accounted for.

 Charlotte Anne holds the guard captive, bound and gagged inside a
 magician's box at the far end of the trailer. She closes the cabinet,
 sealing it with two brass padlocks. The woman magician snaps her
 fingers three times. Behind you, the rear flap slides closed. Your
 black-clad foe beckons you westwards.

 Charlotte Anne's gender-bending twist on the old magician's favourite:
 sawing a man in half. The cabinet is mounted on a turntable in the
 trailer's west third, sealed with two brass padlocks. Suspended above
 is a circular saw blade, and on each face, there are slots for the
 insertion of sharp implements.

 On the magician's cabinet are a croupier's shoe, a set of magician's
 knives and a smoky marble.

>examine shoe

 Don't expect to wear this shoe. This is a showwoman's prop, a
 dispenser of cards which would look right at home in one of those big,
 glamour casinos. The deck is stored within, and its release initiated
 by rotating a handle on the right side. Seems normal, but appearances
 can be deceptive when dealing with this woman.

 The shoe is facing left.

 You walk smack bang into Charlotte Anne's trap: a maze of invisible
 glass panels spread across the middle third of the trailer. Realising
 your folly, you turn to the east, but more have slid into place: clear
 barriers, so thin that refraction is negligible. You could be under an
 inch away from one, and still not see it.

 "Gotcha! Give a mouse a sniff of some cheese, and hey presto! She goes
 and traps herself in a cage of glass. It's known as extra sensory
 perception: reading your audience's mind. That's all you are, Madame

 The circular saw blade is huge, about a metre in diameter. It's
 suspended from a pulley on the trailer's roof, allowing for elevation
 adjustment. The sharp teeth around its rim will cut through timber,
 steel, a human being, anything that gets in their way. Now, where did
 Charlotte Anne put that on/off switch?

>examine knives

 For once, something which belongs to Charlotte Anne is exactly what it
 seems. Or rather, exactly what they seem, since there are six knives
 in total. The handles are of exquisite design: starry black question
 marks. But there's no question as to the purpose of these blades. They
 are murder weapons, simple as that.

 You hear muffled screams from inside the cabinet.

 A smooth, glass sphere, about an inch in diameter. Normally, marbles

 You press the nozzle, but all you get is the occasional blob of dried

 Charlotte Anne takes a brass key from her waistcoat pocket, unfolding
 her other hand to reveal a plastic cube. She brings the two together,
 clenching her fists tightly into a ball. When she opens them, only the
 cube remains, a golden glint visible at its centre. Chuckling, the
 magician drops it onto the cabinet.

 "Always build the audience up for the main event with a little
 charade. And the spectacle I was referring to? This is what I call the
 cabinet of death. Observe that the only exit is locked, there are no
 trapdoors, and the knives-- ah, yes, we need a test of sharpness.
 Watch closely, Madame Crusader."

 The magician places one hand on her magic box, and holds a knife over
 her index finger. She presses down on the handle, grimacing as the
 blade cuts through her glove, and then-- ugh, you can't bear to watch.
 When you next look, the lady is waving at you, her hands both
 unscathed.

 "I should warn you: this act requires my assistant's complete
 concentration, so I'd politely request that you keep silent. Besides,
 the man I've chosen doesn't like listening to women, be they

 Christ. At midnight, those deemed unworthy shall face the wrath of
 God-- his words, not mine."

 "One thing you ought to be wary of: fanatical leaders always have
 disciples, men and women willing to die for what their master believes
 in, brainwashed outcasts unable to think for themselves. No Crusader
 has ever encountered the messiah, so I can't advise you on what to

 Sir Bartholomew Gerant was a seventeenth century aristocrat, a

 you stand is bordered by iron railings, segregating this morbid place
 from the world of the living.

 The golden horse balances on the edge of a precipice-- okay, you're

 relatively new crypt to the north.

 From the other side of the crypt, you hear a voice: young, male,
 crazy-- no, his speech borders on the insanely fanatical.

 "How dare you walk amongst our brothers and sisters, pretend to be a

 The crescent moon is shining-- not the Earth's satellite, but a silver

 Black and White hold a man at gunpoint.

 You're referring to the colours of their masks, not the long, hooded
 robes which are both dark as night. White has a silenced pistol, and
 Black an electric torch which she brings to bear on your face. Well,
 you think the soft, frightened eyes behind the mask belong to a woman.
 The voice certainly does.

 "The Crusader! We must protect the temple!"

 In her bid to escape, the woman cultist drops her electric torch in
 the bracken. She runs over to the entrance stone, retrieving the
 silver emblem. The man being held at pistol point turns the tables,
 knocking White over and making a dash for the cemetery grounds.

 Angry at his lapse in concentration, the masked cultist takes aim at
 the fleeing man-- and then changes his mind, targetting the silenced
 pistol at you. There is no way to reach him in time, and the running
 man is now several metres away, far enough to shorten the odds of a

 Another of the messiah's lunatic brigade, wearing a baggy black robe

 female. Like the two you saw outside the crypt, he-- or she, covers
 his-- or her, face with a stainless steel mask. For all you know, this
 could be White.

 The crescent moon is shining-- not the Earth's satellite, but a silver

 The cult leader's private residence, an indoor garden stocked with

 bubble, with the music out of earshot. Plenty of religious literature
 lying around, if you fancy a bit of a read.

 Wow, this truly is Eden! A plum tree grows at the garden's centre, a
 wonderfully cultivated example of its species just asking to be
 touched.

 The messiah comes at you with his bible, throwing it away whilst
 keeping hold of his bookmark. Gripping the crystal shard, he gives you
 a long, silver-eyed stare before issuing a staunch telling off--
 verbal crucifixion, if you will.

 "How dare you walk on sacred soil without my permission! Consider
 yourself lucky not to be disciplined. This is God's garden, and you
 should adhere to his rules! I am the son of the immortal father, and I
 alone decide who may enter Eden! Now, return to the forum, or die!"

 Hmmm, let's see: a man dressed in silver and black, with a ceremonial
 dagger and no qualms about using it to extract your heart-- yes, it
 might not be a bad idea to do as he says, so you excuse yourself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ceremonial Chamber</span>
 A ceremonial gathering area, so large in scope you'd need to ascend to
 the upper tier to see it all. The acoustic pyramid must measure a
 hundred metres from arch to altar, shone down on from above by the
 lord's messenger: a glowing angel hung on a silver orb at the
 ceiling's vertex.

 Cultists have assembled en masse, awaiting their leader's imminent
 arrival.

 "Messiah! O, lord messiah!"

>examine angel
 befo


 The statue is suspended on strings-- steel cables, to be more precise.
 She looks down on the chamber, wings elegantly spread beneath the
 spinning, silver orb. In each of her eye sockets is a disc of
 translucent crystal, foci for rays of light which rotate in complex
 patterns. Her singing voice needs a workover, though.

 In her hands, the angel is holding a lead casket.

 Simultaneously, the cultists wave their knives in the air.

>examine casket
 befo


 A strongbox, fifty centimetres by fifty by fifty. For the uninitiated,
 that's an eighth of a cubic metre. An airtight seal, lead shielding, a
 clear warning. What more could one ask for? Okay, maybe there could be
 a decent lock or two.

 "Lord messiah! Lord messiah!"

 The assembled cultists grovel before the altar.

>examine altar
 befo


 A direct contrast to the angel's glow, the sacrificial altar is black.
 Maybe the colour scheme is indicative of the religious ceremonies
 performed on this marble table. The pointed tips of the crescent moon
 trail off behind the stone, forming an attractive basin for the
 horrendous-- er, music, if you can call it that.

 Clouds of luminous, yellow smoke rise from inside a pewter jug.

 Alongside the jug are four jars of incense (red, white, blue, and
 brown).

 "Messiah! O, lord messiah!"

>examine incense
 befo


 Four open-topped containers, suspiciously resembling coffee jars
 stripped of all their labels. They are positioned on the hands of Adam
 and Eve, carved images of the inaugural biblical humans bathing
 underneath the smoking pewter jug. Incense powder for all occasions--
 and in four different colours, too.

 Simultaneously, the cultists wave their knives in the air.

>examine mask
 befo


 A stainless steel mask, featureless apart from two crescent-shaped eye
 slits and a wire gauze to speak and breathe through. Like a party
 piece, it has an elastic band to hold it in place. When worn in
 conjunction with a cultist's hooded robe, the user is transformed into
 an anonymous, brown-faced fanatic.

 "Lord messiah! Lord messiah!"

 Well, that's the overall impression. There aren't many other logical

 some of the most advanced laboratory equipment available. A bacterial

 Fresh out of options, you begin the long, winding climb to the upper

 <span class="floydstyle i">Ceremonial Chamber</span> (on the upper tier)
 Mirrored crescents hang from the balcony, reflecting the angel's light
 down onto the assembled cultists. Moving north, the beams become more
 intensified, peaking in brightness at the altar. That's where you'll
 finish up if you don't do what's expected. One wrong move, and the
 fanatic opposite will raise the alarm.

 Two bells are fixed onto the tier's rail, one bronze and one silver.

 The chanting increases in pace.

 A leather bound book, with the initials DJS on the front cover.
 Flicking through the pages, you come across some interesting items
 which might merit from further examination: a diagram and two
 paragraphs of text. The rest of Seume's notes are limited to
 unfinished maps and chemical formulae.

 The acolytes abruptly cease their repetitive name-calling, falling
 silent as the messiah makes his entrance. Suddenly, there is room to
 spare: the cultists split into two groups, making way for the man in
 the silver mask. He walks between the grovelling fanatics, standing on
 the altar to offer his twopenneth.

 "Fellow believers, we approach the dawn of a new age. Because of my
 actions, and mine alone, the world shall be cleansed of its
 imperfections. We will remove the parasites who have usurped control
 of our mother planet, and give birth to a new civilisation, a heavenly
 utopia created in the image of the supreme being."

 Spoken with sincerity, no theatricals, and total conviction. This man
 isn't just play acting-- no, he really does believe he's the son of
 God.

 are hummed continuously, resonating around statuesque, marble pillars.
 Archways connect with atriums east and west, but the southern chamber
 is where all the noise is coming from.

 Ten heavily built sentries, alternately masked grey and brown, stand
 guard along the entrance corridor.

 One of the cultists points a dagger accusingly in your direction.

 "Hey! Why are you holding the sacred blade!?"

 The masked acolytes yell as they charge towards you, drawing vicious
 knives from inside their robes. There are simply too many of them, and
 you can't discern the men from the women, and therefore, fifty percent
 of your attacks are useless-- a handicap not shared by the cultists,
 who duly despatch you with their blades.

 Blue liquid escapes through the glass, vapourising upon coming into

 through human skin.

 You don't feel well at all. Your blood is boiling, turning your face
 brown as it runs its course towards your brain. Hair drops onto the

 The lord messiah, son of the immortal God-- or so he would have you
 believe. His garments are appropriate, certainly: a black, silk robe
 and a shiny silver mask. A certifiable nutter he may be, but he has an
 overbearing presence which demands total respect from his
 subordinates. Kind of do or die, really.

 cultist's robe: You already have that.
 messiah's silver mask: You take the messiah's silver mask. Before you
 look away in revulsion, you catch a glimpse of the man's face. What
 you see lingers long in the memory: completely shaven head, crescent
 moon symbols carved into his temple-- and, most vividly of all, a
 layer of black paint sprayed over the entirety of his face.

 The robe worn by the fanatics is six feet long, cut from a single

 garment to have: trailing cape, cowled hood, long sleeves-- and
 underneath, a crescent loop for concealing knives and mystical rods of
 power.

 Inside the crescent loop is a crystal ceremonial dagger.

 A stainless steel mask, featureless apart from two crescent-shaped eye
 slits and a wire gauze to speak and breathe through. Like a party
 piece, it has an elastic band to hold it in place. When worn in
 conjunction with a cultist's hooded robe, the user is transformed into
 an anonymous, white-faced fanatic.

 You're in the headquarters of the silver moon cult, a Greek styled
 temple hidden deep within the subterranean catacombs. Songs of praise
 are hummed continuously, resonating around statuesque, marble pillars.
 Archways connect with atriums east and west, but the southern chamber

 Ten heavily built sentries, alternately masked grey and brown, stand
 guard along the entrance corridor.

 One of the cultists points a dagger accusingly in your direction.

 "Why are you holding an acolyte's-- you're not the lord messiah!"

 The masked acolytes yell as they charge towards you, drawing vicious
 knives from inside their robes. There are simply too many of them, and
 you can't discern the men from the women, and therefore, fifty percent

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Messiah's Quarters</span>
 The cult leader's private residence, an indoor garden stocked with
 exotic plants from all over the world. No furniture, however. The
 messiah must prefer to stand secluded in his own little crystal
 bubble, with the music out of earshot. Plenty of religious literature
 lying around, if you fancy a bit of a read.

 The lord messiah has fallen, and lies prostrate on the floor.

 Wow, this truly is Eden! A plum tree grows at the garden's centre, a

 Actually, the dagger is long enough to be considered a shortsword, a

 tubes, holes designed to draw warm air into the hollow interior. The

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pillared Forum</span>
 You're in the headquarters of the silver moon cult, a Greek styled
 temple hidden deep within the subterranean catacombs. Songs of praise

 Archways connect with atriums east and west, but the southern chamber

 A ceremonial gathering area, so large in scope you'd need to ascend to

 hundred metres from arch to altar, shone down on from above by the
 lord's messenger: a glowing angel hung on a silver orb at the
 ceiling's vertex.

 A crystal serpent has risen from the altar, occupying the space
 previously taken up by the pewter jug.

 Alongside the jug are three jars of incense (red, white, and brown).

 You can also see a lead casket (which is closed) here.

 You hold the hypodermic syringe in the flame, twisting it until the

>put syringe in me

 Rolling up your sleeve, you hold the syringe above your inverted
 wrist. Inhaling deeply, you take the plunge, pressing the needle all
 the way in. You desperately want to scream, but you bite your tongue,
 holding on until the last moment. Then you pull it out, sucking the
 wound. By the way, your blood tastes like honey.

 Yes, sweet honey. Your veins have stopped glowing, too. No time for
 celebration, though: you hear footsteps. In full health, you grip the
 Staff of Justice, ready to meet the incoming threat as the glowing
 heroine. Armed police officers breach the temple, an elite response
 unit headed up by Detective Seume.

 "Hold your fire! We don't want Madame Crusader on our casualty list.
 Caught them all for you, my love. They were legging it out of the
 catacombs, mumbling drivel about betrayal and the lord's vengeance.
 Single handedly saved Douthwaite Asylum from closure, I reckon. Now
 Karen can finally rest in peace."

 And on that sombre note, the widower leaves to arrest the messiah.

 The golden horse makes a bump-free landing.

 "So Lisa, you have returned to Maiden's Wharf. Try not to let the
 memory of your parents upset your judgement. Captain Hydra, pirate
 queen of the Atlantic, plans on adding to her collection: silver,
 platinum-- she's particularly fond of gold, so long as it's not the
 Crusader's halo."

 "Five years back, the two redheads had a disagreement. The pirate
 challenged the heroine to a duel, and lost everything: swordfight,
 ship, treasure, and freedom. Spent four years in Douthwaite screaming
 threats too horrible to repeat-- and in October, she escaped. Be

 Plus ca change? Not quite. The golden horse is overshadowed by the
 battered hull of a merchant vessel. A plate on its bow gives the

 Attached to the lowered winching hook is an iron ring.

 You can also see a heap of timber slats and a lifting rig (which is
 empty) here.

 Ralph bumps into you, dislodging a silver candle holder from the
 wrapped bundle he's frantically trying to conceal under his duvet. He
 cuts his losses, leaving it behind as he stumbles southwest. A
 sweeping buzz from outside, wood crushing glass, then the
 blood-chillingly fierce voice breaks the silence once more.

 Taken.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bang! </span>A golden hand lowers the discharged flintlock pistol. The
 skeletal shooter advances into the cargo bay, ribcage blurring as the
 sedative circulates through your veins.

 A woman stands behind the bipidal robot, red hair tied into braids and
 wearing a water-soaked eyepatch: Captain Hydra. The pirate strokes a
 parrot perched on her shoulder, pressing the tip of her photon cutlass
 against your throat. She laughs as its blue laser-blade singes your
 chin.

 "Who we got 'ere then? A stowaway methinks. Louisa, take this wench
 and lock 'er in the brig with yonder man in white. Thieve's 'ands are
 always o' use, me girl. And in case yer thinkin' o' not co-operatin',
 just remember that there be plenty o' fish who'll want to feed on yer
 tasty, little eyes."

 The skeletoid's hands lift you off the floor, carrying your docile
 body from the cargo hold. Hydra accidently kicks the Staff of Justice
 with her peg-leg, and as you pass out, the last recollection you have
 is of her bending over to take what she believes is a silver candle
 holder...


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dark Cell</span>
 Total darkness. Your back is sore from leaning against the right
 angled walls of your cell, and the sedative has left you with a
 splitting headache. From nearby, you hear the throbbing of a ship's
 engine. Where are you? On the Maria? How long were you out? Is the
 Staff of Justice on board? And what about Ralph?

 So many questions that need answering.

 Arbitarily speaking. Taking the door as being to the northeast, the
 ventilation duct would then run east to the neighbouring cell. Ralph
 holds up his cigarette lighter at the far end, the source of a wavy
 yellow flame which is reflected on the walls of Hydra's prison, a
 nondescript steel box five metres across.

 You're locked in, unless you can get the cell door open.

 A horizontal shaft connecting your cell with Ralph's. The two metre

 Something metallic scrapes against the inside of the ventilation duct.

 the result of either a complex calculation or an amazing twist of
 fate, the black slider drops right in the palm of your hand.

 the Atlantic.

 The midship is ahead, and the brig astern. Both of the cell doors are

 Swaying blue light to the north: Captain Hydra returning to her
 command post.

 "Keep 'er steady, Emma. We're comin' up to our target. We don't want

 holding them in place. Rigging stretches from port to starboard,
 thinning out into a rope which you may climb or descend. More
 conventional corridors lead north and south.

 A blunt rapier sticks out from the bulkhead.

 Hydra's parrot is perched on the rigging.

 The pirate woman herself is also present, cutlass clinking against her
 buckle as she climbs into the Maria's conning tower. Luckily, she
 doesn't glance down. The rigging is all shook up, and a golden rod
 dislodged from the ropes: the Staff of Justice? Before you can make a

 The weapon's bluntness shouldn't be alarming. After all, the rapier is

 It's not your trusty staff that's lying in the basin, but another one

 Eyeless Emma's twin, lobeless Louisa. The golden girl was born without

 Hissing pistons and clanking spindles-- the sounds, at least, are

 the Maria runs on nuclear power. And so, there must be a reactor

 You can't do that whilst concentrating on Hydra and her cutlass!

 The holoscope replicates everything: the explosion as the torpedo
 hits, seawater pouring into the sinking Adrietta, passengers
 scrambling over each other in fits of panic, trying to get to the
 lifeboats. Desolate at the tragedy, you never see her sword thrust
 coming.

 The laser-blue blade of Hydra's photon cutlass slides between your
 ribs, passing unhindered through bone and skin. She twists the handle,
 grinning through silver teeth as you writhe in pain, chest skewered on
 her sword. Finally, she draws her flintlock pistol, and ends your
 heartache with a bullet to the head.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Conning Tower</span>

 A holoscope is the sole concedence to modern technology.

 Captain Hydra faces you, cutlass in hand.

 The parrot flies up after you, settling on its mistress' shoulder. She
 gives the bird a stroke, watching you closely.

 "So ye've escaped, 'ave ye? And yer dare to climb into me connin'
 tower? Ye must 'ave balls o' steel-- or brains o' sand! I admire yer
 courage, me stowaway lass. I challenge ye to a duel, woman to woman

 A red, wireframe blip appears on the holoscope, flashing periodically:
 an active torpedo, closing on its target. You estimate three minutes
 before impact.

 "We just got time to finish our skirmish, me girl. A shame ye'll miss
 out on the lootin'. Look at the fair Adrietta: a floatin' beauty ripe
 for plunderin', whole deckloads o' pieces o' eight, and the skeltons
 o' those fools who dared to brave the Atlantic, and take yonder
 captain lightly-- just as ye did, me lass."

>repel knob

 The remote control unit swings from side to side. Glancing at the
 holoscope, you see the torpedo veer away from the Adrietta. Hydra
 thrusts out with her cutlass, anger welling up as she watches the red
 blip flash, and disappear. Her eyes fall on the control unit, and then
 on her parrot.

 "Ye stupid bird! What 'ave ye done!?"

 Hydra draws her flintlock pistol, ramming its barrel under the bird's
 chest. Her pet is aware of the danger, taking off and twisting through
 the air. Hydra fires a shot: a bad one which damages the controls. The
 pirate waves her cutlass about in frustration, just before the Maria
 rolls sharply to port.

 Your nemesis falls on her sword, losing a leg-- her wooden one, that
 is. Slicing through a stilt is easy work for a photon cutlass, and the
 peg-leg clatters onto the floor, severed neatly at the joint. The
 pirate tumbles, banging her head. As she slips into unconsciousness,
 danger messages stream across the holoscope.

 Captain Hydra seems determined to follow in the one-footed steps of

 others would beg to differ.

 The turrets are there, but cannon balls are no longer the armament of

 the latter option, installing two tubes on opposite sides of a pivoted
 chain.

 The hatches have raised into vertical niches, and both cannon turrets

 Hydra has amassed herself quite a collection. Iron banded oak chests
 are stacked in pyramids, utilising every available means of support:
 glass floor panels, the ventilation shaft, lesser riches. That is,
 lesser from the pirate's perspective. Many a nobleman must be
 wondering what became of the family jewels.

 Your sailor companion has joined you.

 You can also see an ex-stealth sonar here.

 (the glass floor with the flintlock pistol)
 Blast a hole in the hull of a submerged submarine? Not one of your
 better ideas, but you'll give it a shot. Crouching down, you aim for a
 panel at the far end of the room. Wishing yourself luck, you pull the
 trigger-- and lucky you were, with the bullet only grazing the glass,
 rather than shattering it outright.

 There, that should give you time to put your plan into action-- erm,
 you do have a plan don't you, Lisa? If not, you'd better think of one
 fast: water is already beginning to seep through the cracks.

 "Er-- isn't that the, you know-- erm, glass floor? Why did you shoot--
 ah, erm-- just-- RUN FOR YOUR LIFE, OLD GIRL!"

 The sailor does just that, fleeing north with his candle holders.

 The south wall closes up.

 In the nick of time, from the sounds of things: seawater pours into
 the treasure vault, sloshing around the chests stacked behind the
 south wall. The ventilation duct groans under the weight of the ocean
 surrounding it on all four sides. Even Ralph is gloomily pessimistic,
 closing his eyes and visibly shaking.

 But you remain dry. Although the same cannot be said of Hydra's hoard,
 dumped in the underwater trenches of the Atlantic. The smaller boxes
 break open, releasing their contents, most of which should be
 salvagable at a later date. Perhaps more importantly, the weight loss
 has levelled the ship. Ralph pats you on the back.

 "Quite a load she was carrying. I'm surprised the ship didn't sink to
 the seabed and break up. Not wishing for that to happen, of course.
 That was some ride, old girl. Would you mind taking me home now? It's
 getting awfully late, you know."

 Ralph straightens his white suit.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Midship</span>
 You stand over skulls and crossbones, human skeletons rattling against
 the glass base of Hydra's ship. Their arms and ankles are shackled,
 holding them in place. Rigging stretches from port to starboard,
 thinning out into a rope which you may climb or descend. More
 conventional corridors lead north and south.

 A blunt rapier sticks out from the bulkhead.

>go up

 You climb up to the Maria's conning tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Conning Tower</span>
 The ropes terminate at a mast-top lookout post, rigging tied to the
 basket rail. As they say, the only way is down. Other influences from
 the age of buccaneering grace the controls: a compass, an anchor chain
 on a capstan-- and of course, the six-spoked sailor's wheel.

 A holoscope is the sole concedence to modern technology.

 Captain Hydra lies flat on her back, a parrot perched on her shoulder.

 It's getting lighter. The water turns royal blue, then turquoise and
 finally, so clear you can see moonlight reflecting off the scales of
 fish swimming past. The submarine's powerful, upward climb has brought
 it to the surface. Ralph has come out of hiding, straightening his
 jacket as he joins you on the conning tower.

 "I say, you have taken her down a peg-leg or two. Was that your doing,
 old-- er, I mean young lady? It's been dreadfully rude of me referring
 to you as old girl. Hardly puts me in a good light, and it must have
 annoyed you immensely. You have the humble apology of Ralph T.
 Winston."

 The sailor pauses to inspect the wrecked controls.

 "It has potential, wouldn't you agree? Patch her up here and there,
 and she'd be a joy to captain. When all's done and dusted, one would
 have to concur we made a fantastic partnership-- didn't we, fair lady
 Crusader?"

 And so, you return to your ship.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Golden Horse</span>
 Behind the hologram facade, the golden horse is a super-sleek
 helicopter powered by jet engines. Most of the cockpit is occupied by
 the aircraft's computer, Rex. Displayed on the main screen is a
 top-down plan of Atlantic City.

 The externally mounted extras are impressive: a laser beam, a

 The plan is in blueprint format, with the streets and buildings of
 Atlantic City shown in white. From Newhurst in the north to the
 southern coastline, every last square inch of detail is included. Your
 present location is marked by a flashing icon-- a golden horse,
 naturally. Maiden's Wharf is where you're at.

 There are two locations highlighted:

    -- W.P. Browne Airport

 The golden horse makes a bump-free landing.

 "What did you used to play with as a child, Lisa? Colouring books?
 Lego? Dolls? Plasticine? There was one little boy who enjoyed building
 his own toys: razored yoyos, acidic crayons, explosive balloons-- yes,
 a real problem child. He still hasn't grown up yet, despite reaching
 physical adulthood ten years ago."

 "Tonight, the toymaker is taking part in the Baron's new year

 hundred percent kill rates. The higher his score, the greater his
 reward. All very twisted, but the kind of game this kid would relish.

 Everybody is asleep. Mainframe computers crunch numbers in silence,
 their human operators oblivious to the unfolding crisis. In the

 upstairs in the control tower, life or death decisions are made
 twenty-four hours a day.

 Screeching wheels. A man rolls out from behind one of the large
 computers. Yes, rolls, using a desk chair as a makeshift zimmer-frame.
 His clothes are shredded into straight edged strips of cloth, sliced
 open with parallel swipes. Whatever did this was razor sharp, and
 handled with medical precision.

 The computer operator is delirious, mumbling incomprehensible
 technical jargon. As he collapses, he wheels the chair across the

 where real people die.

 The toymaker is wearing a flight jacket. And he's brought a companion:
 a chubby teddy bear with wide arms, marble-black eyes, and a hairy
 chest.

 The toymaker stops, overcome with remorse as he sees the defunct robot
 spidrone. He grabs hold of it, attempting revival by pulling its legs.
 Giving up, he drops his eight-legged toy on the floor, pointing in its

 "Aw, look at it! Look at what you've done to Incy Wincy, you golden

 Well, I can be a bully too. I'll get my own back! Just you wait and

 Whatever you've done pays dividends. The teddy bear squeals, eye
 sockets smoking as you shake yourself free from its steel grasp. You

 The golden horse takes off in pursuit of the biplane.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Golden Horse</span>
 Behind the hologram facade, the golden horse is a super-sleek
 helicopter powered by jet engines. Most of the cockpit is occupied by
 the aircraft's computer, Rex. Displayed on the main screen is a
 top-down plan of Atlantic City.

 The externally mounted extras are impressive: a laser beam, a
 grappling hook and a radio antenna. Warm air escapes through the
 raised windshield.

 Straight ahead of you is the toymaker's biplane.

 "Oh, look! A flying horsey. My plane's better than yours. It can do
 all kinds of cool things. So can I, cos I'm the big boss of the sky.
 Time to play! Begsy I go first. I've got this big, mean friend who'll
 roast you alive. Blaze, fire!"

 The toymaker reaches under his seat, taking a plastic action figure
 and throwing it into the air. Once it gets clear of the plane, a
 jetpack on its back ignites.

 Not even the heat shield can prevent some of the warmth conducting

 Blaze's fuel supply runs out, and the action figure drops from the
 sky.

 "A flameproof windscreen? You're not allowed to have one of those!
 What you need to do is cool down. I've just the girl: ice hard and

 for increasing speed even further, the downside being the increased

 in a tangle. Here we have a young man who prefers violent games, ones
 where real people die.

 The toymaker is wearing a parachute.

 Your incoming foe wipes saliva off his chin, smiling as a plastic
 cannon extends from beneath the biplane's undercarriage. Green gunge,

 shutting down the propeller.

 Wind resistance weakens the plane's forward momentum, and the huge

 little man is trapped up there. Now, where have you seen his childish
 face recently?

 The squeaky toy mouse explodes, supplemented by a brief display of
 pyrotechnics. Petroleum catches fire easily, and sure enough, the next
 thing to go up in smoke is the dumped fuel in sector 85. Wind fans the
 fire, and a trail to sector 84 is burning in no time. A plane flies
 in, using the flames as a landing beacon.

 Rubber aircraft wheels scrape concrete. The plane's captain activates
 the speed brakes, bringing the jet to a halt with twenty metres of
 runway seven to spare. Things are returning to normal at W.P. Browne:
 the airfield lights are switched over to a backup generator, and staff
 are recovering from their long sleep.

 One snag, though: the toymaker. Do you help him down, or leave him
 where he is, cat's cradling in his trapped parachute? That's a tough
 one to call, but on the balance of play, a child shouldn't be removed
 from a recreation area. Kids like to climb trees, so why not

 "Bad news, Lisa. You're about to have a tussle with an old enemy:
 Mistletoe. The Baron has selected a suitable date for his daughter, a
 man whom one day he would hope to replace: Thomas Hurst, mayor of
 Atlantic City. This assassin is the very definition of drop dead
 gorgeous, as I'm sure you know."

 "Security is tight for the mayor's millennial address, so she might
 have to pass on her usual-- er, close liasons, and go for a distant
 kill. Knowing her, she'll want to entertain herself beforehand. Just
 make sure it's not you she chooses as her pleasure girl. Oh, and get

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alleyway</span>
 As a rule of thumb, alleyways are tight, narrow, dimly lit spaces,
 frequented by vermin and the occasional undesirable. This particular
 little used sidestreet is no exception, connecting the rough
 inner-city areas with the plaza southeast.

 The arrival of the golden horse may have frightened away the human
 element, but you still hear rodents scurrying about in the rubbish
 skips.

 It's started to rain, heavily. Droplets of water patter against the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Plaza</span>
 The theatre stands at the northern end of its namesake plaza. Often a
 venue for Shakespearian productions, tonight the auditorium is to host
 the mayor's speech as Atlantic City welcomes the new millennium. Quite
 a turnout: citizens wind in serpent patterns along the icy streets,
 queuing up for the last few tickets.

 An alley bends around the building to the northwest. Underground
 parking spaces are accessible by descending a ramp.

 Screams of terror from down below. Such is the apathy of the general
 public that nobody answers the woman's cry for help. Madame Crusader,
 you're needed.

>go down

 You slide downwards, trainers slipping on hardened ice.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parking Garage</span>
 The parking spaces beneath the plaza are reserved for the use of
 theatre guests. Everywhere you look, you see expensive cars with
 personalised plates. Pillars of concrete hold up the low ceiling,
 shamelessly used as painting surfaces by local vandals. Fluorescent
 green arrows point the way to the exit ramp.

 The tall, sultry figure kneels down over her prostrate victim: a young
 brunette, stripped to her underclothes, body smeared with dollops of
 whipped cream and red lipstick. Mistletoe zips up the dress she is
 wearing, a sewn collage of silvered panels which flicker in phase with
 neon strip lamps.

 "Why do you hide underneath your dress, Daphne? Men would positively
 drool over your smooth skin, your slim figure and think all day long
 about touching your--Madame Crusader! I thought I'd given you the kiss
 of death. Keep those gleaming legs of yours still, or the young lady
 dies. She's nice. Believe me, I know."

 Mistletoe presses the barrel of a needle rifle against Daphne's head.

>heatscan mistletoe

 Mistletoe's body is indescribably warm.

 Mistletoe lifts up her bare foot, using it to rub cream into Daphne's
 back.

 "I've often thought of the Crusader as a lover: short lived,
 enjoyable, and very rewarding. And after she's been squeezed, there's
 another to take her place. But I'll have to pass on you, since Cupid's
 arrow is for piercing the mayor's heart. Thomas will look pretty in
 red, don't you think?"

>examine daphne

 The baby faced girl-- woman if you want to be pedantic, can't be much
 older than twenty. Stealing Daphne's silvery dress was the least of
 Mistletoe's crimes: her body has been exposed, sprayed with perfume,
 smeared with runny white cream, and kissed repeatedly. She still has
 her lingerie on, at least.

 Mistletoe unfastens her dress, reaching underneath with her free hand.

 "My only regret is not being able to deal with him personally, to hold
 him in my arms as he passes away, for him to die in the presence of
 his dream girl. That's something everybody deserves to experience once
 in their lives. Chin up, Daphne. Don't fret, dear. Madame Crusader is
 here to save you."

 Mistletoe removes her hand, spinning a bikini top around her little
 finger. With a flick of her wrist, she wraps the strap twice around
 Daphne's throat, tying it into a bow at the front. The assassin kisses
 her decoy on the cheek, keeping her needle rifle aimed at you as she
 skips up the ramp.

 The origins of the plaza theatre date back to the sixteenth century, a
 time when performances were held exclusively for nobles. This day in
 age, pompousness is a thing of the past, and royal consensus isn't
 required to get inside.

 Nothing unusual about the entrance doors: four glass panels on a
 central spoke, warm on the interior, frosted on the exterior, and
 rotatable.

>go north

 Warm air blasts down on your face as you enter the theatre.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 Persian carpets laid out underneath crystal chandeliers, pretty much
 what you'd expect from an upper-class establishment. Cafeteria to the
 west aside, no shops are open for service. Overhead heaters blow hot
 air across the revolving doors, keeping the freezing cold at bay. Even
 so, the plaza outside looks uninviting.

 A security scanner has been set up between the entrance hall and a
 staircase to the north. The gateway is supervised by a guard named
 Steve.

 Mistletoe stands with her back to you-- and her front to him. As you
 enter, she covers up her exposed legs with the mirrored skirt, slowly
 fastening the dress. Combing her blonde hair, she gives Steve a long,
 drawn out kiss on his forehead before walking through the gate.

 Steve seems happy all of a sudden, without a care in the world for the
 beeping alarm that sounds as she strolls past, or the needle rifle
 held in plain view.

 A ball of gold lightning gathers at the tip of the Staff of Justice,
 surrounding Steve's body. He slumps to the ground, unconscious.

 Hearing Steve's screams of agony, Mel and Dave run in to assist their
 colleague. Seeing you holding a crackling golden rod in your hands,
 they reach the logical, but incorrect, conclusion that your intentions
 are hostile. Simulataneously, the guards draw their automatic pistols,
 take aim, and open fire.

 The plaza theatre bases a lot on appearances: the security guards all
 wear boots polished to a shine and black, crease proof uniforms. An
 identity tag identifies the guard as Steve-- soaring Steve, more like.

 Astonishingly, the candle wick manages to keep burning.

 According to identity badges, the two guards at the table are Dave and
 Mel.

 On the counter is a thermos flask filled with steaming, black coffee.

 Dave passes the shaker to Mel. After rubbing the cup on her lap, she
 tilts it, rolling the die across the table.

 "A six! Tut, tut, tut. That's too bad."

 Dave stands up, leaving the cafeteria in disgust. Moments later, Steve

 Metal chairs scrape on the floor. Guards shout at each other,
 disorientated and confused. In the absence of candlelight, the

 Pouch would be a more appropiate description, since the bag is closed

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Plaza</span>
 The theatre stands at the northern end of its namesake plaza. Often a
 venue for Shakespearian productions, tonight the auditorium is to host
 the mayor's speech as Atlantic City welcomes the new millennium. Quite
 a turnout: citizens wind in serpent patterns along the icy streets,
 queuing up for the last few tickets.

 An alley bends around the building to the northwest. Underground
 parking spaces are accessible by descending a ramp.

 The leeches of society gather in wolfpacks outside the theatre. Maybe
 you should be nicer in your description of news reporters since you
 are one, but still.

>go north

 Warm air blasts down on your face as you enter the theatre.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 Persian carpets laid out underneath crystal chandeliers, pretty much
 what you'd expect from an upper-class establishment. Cafeteria to the
 west aside, no shops are open for service. Overhead heaters blow hot
 air across the revolving doors, keeping the freezing cold at bay. Even
 so, the plaza outside looks uninviting.

 A security scanner has been set up between the entrance hall and a
 staircase to the north. The gateway is supervised by a guard named
 Mel.

>go west
 befo



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cafeteria</span>
 The cafeteria isn't open per se, merely occupied by two security
 guards whining away the time, gambling with dice on a candlelit table.
 Wind blows in through a broken window, howling around the service
 counter and rattling everything which isn't nailed down.
 Astonishingly, the candle wick manages to keep burning.

 According to identity badges, the two guards at the table are Dave and
 Steve.

 On the counter is a thermos flask filled with steaming, black coffee.

>put bottle in flask
 befo


 You need to be holding the perfume bottle before you can put it into
 something else.

>take bottle
 befo


 You take the perfume bottle out of your bra.

>put bottle in flask
 befo


 You dip the perfume bottle into the thermos flask, warming the water.

 The heat acts as a catalyst, speeding up the reaction. In ten seconds,
 the pill has dissolved completely, turning the water the same, sickly
 shade of pink.

 "Poor Mel, thinking someone's going to relieve her."

 [Your score has just gone up by six points.]

>spray me
 befo


 (with the perfume bottle)
 You spray the pink solution everywhere you are able to: arms, body,
 legs, face. Hopefully, the rosy scent will negate the effects of
 Mistletoe's perfume should you have the misfortune to come under her
 influence.

 "I think we'll leave her a little longer, don't you?"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Plaza</span>
 The theatre stands at the northern end of its namesake plaza. Often a
 venue for Shakespearian productions, tonight the auditorium is to host
 the mayor's speech as Atlantic City welcomes the new millennium. Quite
 a turnout: citizens wind in serpent patterns along the icy streets,
 queuing up for the last few tickets.

 An alley bends around the building to the northwest. Underground
 parking spaces are accessible by descending a ramp.

 The leeches of society gather in wolfpacks outside the theatre. Maybe
 you should be nicer in your description of news reporters since you
 are one, but still.

>go down
 befo


 You slide downwards, trainers slipping on hardened ice.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parking Garage</span>
 The parking spaces beneath the plaza are reserved for the use of
 theatre guests. Everywhere you look, you see expensive cars with
 personalised plates. Pillars of concrete hold up the low ceiling,
 shamelessly used as painting surfaces by local vandals. Fluorescent
 green arrows point the way to the exit ramp.

 Daphne lies down in an empty parking space, staring docily at the
 ceiling.

>spray daphne
 befo


 (with the perfume bottle)
 You spray the pink solution into the air around Daphne. Her eyelids
 flutter, and she begins to shift uncomfortably on the concrete.
 Unexpectedly, she lashes out, hands going to scratch your face.

 "No! Get away! Get away from me, you psycho bit-- oh, pardon me. I'm
 sorry. For a moment, I thought-- my clothes! So it wasn't a dream. She
 really did strip me and cover my body with-- ugh! How horrible! Look,
 you'll have to excuse me."

 Daphne, still confused, climbs the ramp. She slips, banging her head
 on the ice. Luckily, she wasn't injured in the fall, and manages to
 make it safely to street level. In the process, something both you and
 Mistletoe missed fell out from her lingerie: a VIP pass for tonight's
 performance.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>examine pass
 befo


 A decidedly flimsy slip of black cardboard with gold letters, old
 English style, proclaiming the holder's VIP status. The writing is
 arranged around the crest of the plaza theatre: coat of arms, dragons,
 latin phrases-- the usual stuff.

>take pass

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 You climb the ramp, returning to the plaza.

>mimic umbrella

 The Staff of Justice mimics the appearance of the official theatre
 umbrella.

>go north
 befo


 Warm air blasts down on your face as you enter the theatre.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance Hall</span>
 Persian carpets laid out underneath crystal chandeliers, pretty much
 what you'd expect from an upper-class establishment. Cafeteria to the
 west aside, no shops are open for service. Overhead heaters blow hot
 air across the revolving doors, keeping the freezing cold at bay. Even
 so, the plaza outside looks uninviting.

 A security scanner has been set up between the entrance hall and a
 staircase to the north. The gateway is supervised by a guard named
 Mel.

>give umbrella to mel
 befo


 You can't see any such thing.

>give staff to mel
 befo


 Mel takes the Staff of Justice from you.

>go north
 befo


 You walk through the security scanner-- and nothing happens. As you
 head for the stairs, Mel returns the Staff of Justice.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Staircase</span>
 And not just any old, crummy staircase. The steps are whitewashed,
 with busts of theatre patrons decorating the banister rails. A
 signpost confirms what you have deduced already: only invited guests
 are allowed into the auditorium. That would be to the north, opposite
 the entrance hall.

 An usherette, posh uniform and all, stands at the intersection with a
 secondary stairwell which ascends to the northeast.

>go north
 befo


 The usherette casually folds her arms, standing in your way.

 "I'm sorry, but I'll need to see your pass, ma'am."

>show pass to usher
 befo


 "Okay, ma'am, you may go through."

 The usherette shows you into the auditorium.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Auditorium</span>
 People have risen from their seats, hands in the air as they await the
 entrance of Thomas Hurst, mayor of Atlantic City. Over the auditorium
 speakers, you hear a classical concerto played by violinists of the
 Gustav symphony orchestra. The main performance is scheduled to begin
 in a few minutes' time.

 Unfortunately, with everyone standing up, you can't tell whereabouts
 you are in the seating area.

 South of you is the exit from the auditorium.

 (in the television camera)
 The catwalk is many metres above your head.

 Some people jostle past you, taking their seats.

>examine seat
 befo


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine seats
 befo


 The seating arrangement is reminscent of an ancient Roman ampitheatre,
 with rows of polyester chairs laid out in coincentric circles around
 the stage, accessible by stepped aisles rising outwards from the
 curtained nucleus.

 Twenty rows and thirteen aisles, in total. Each intersection is
 labelled with an alphanumeric code. Presently, you're at G-20.

 You circle around to aisle I.
 You circle around to aisle J.

 Mistletoe's seat is adjacent to the aisle.

 The crowd cheer loudly.

>examine seat
 befo


 The seat used by Mistletoe is no different from any other in the
 auditorium: red polyester cushions, facing directly forwards, fixed
 onto the ground, with plenty of storage space for personal belongings.
 Either by sheer fortune or some clever planning, the seat gives the
 assassin a clear, unobstructed shot at the stage.

 On Mistletoe's seat are a mirrored dress and Daphne's handbag.

 You sense the crowd's anticipation grow.

>take dress
 befo


 As you take the dress, something nasty falls out onto the seat
 cushion: a needle rifle, quite possibly the most dangerous weapon in
 existence.

 The crowd cheer loudly.

>take rifle
 befo


 You'd frighten people if you waved the rifle around in public.

>wear dress
 befo


 You slip the mirrored dress over your casual clothes.

 The crowd cheer loudly.

>examine handbag
 befo


 Pouch would be a more appropiate description, since the bag is closed
 by pulling on primitive purse strings wound through holes. Like
 Daphne's dress, her leather handbag is reflective, dyed in silver. The
 bulky shoulder strap makes it heavier near the top, prone to falling
 on its side.

 In the handbag is a telescopic sight.

>examine sight
 befo


 The sniper's scope, a six inch tube which electronically enhances
 images for the watching assassin. Once a target is lined up in the
 crosshairs, their chances of survival would be practically nil, since
 the telescopic sight allows shots to be taken with pinpoint accuracy.

 The lens cap is closed.

 Some people jostle past you, taking their seats.

>open lens
 befo


 The cap is supposed to protect the lens from dust, and it has. But not
 without a tradeoff: in the excessive heat, the glass has steamed up
 with condensation.

>clean sight
 befo


 You clean the condensation off the lens.

 The crowd cheer loudly.

>look in sight
 befo


 The lens cap is open.

>put sight on rifle
 befo


 You need to be holding the telescopic sight before you can put it on
 top of something else.

>take sight

 The crowd cheer loudly.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 The telescopic sight snaps into place.

 You sense the crowd's anticipation grow.

>look in sight
 befo


 The lens cap is open.

>look through sight
 befo


 The lens cap is open.

>examine rifle
 befo


 A murder weapon, simple as that. There is little pretence that the
 needle rifle is anything else: high penetration, fully automatic, and
 unstoppable unless the sniper fires blind, or the target is able to
 dodge out of harm's way before the assassin squeezes the trigger-- or
 move at mach six, which is unlikely.

 Fitted onto the barrel is a telescopic sight.

 You sense the crowd's anticipation grow.

>take rifle

 You'd frighten people if you waved the rifle around in public.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>look in sighg
 befo


 You can't see any such thing.

>look in sight
 befo


 You peer down the scope of the rifle. For a moment, you put yourself
 in the mind of the assassin: stock pressed firmly into her shoulder,
 hands steady around the grip, finger over the trigger, one eye closed,
 the other watching, waiting for a clear shot. And then, the casual,
 inconsequential taking of a human life.

 Something cold drips onto your forehead: chocolate milkshake dribbling
 down your face, sticky but refreshingly cool. The young, blonde
 steward sits alongside you on the seat's armrest, crossing her legs.

 "Lisa, isn't it? I never forget a lady, especially one so striking and
 memorable as yourself. I hope you didn't miss me too much. I was
 outside, taking advantage of the interval to cool off, and get into
 the pants of a nice, young man. Lonely business, I'm in. One has to
 entertain oneself, no?"

 Mistletoe squeezes your shoulder, her smile growing as dizziness, and
 ultimately paralysis, set in. She unfastens the top button of her
 shirt, releasing alsanine into the humid air of the auditorium. To
 you, her perfume always smelled of...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Daffodils</span>
 Yellow flowers. Whole fields of them, stems swaying in the cool,
 summer breeze. Humming bees, wings flapping against the petals, suck
 out ripe nectar, carrying it away to make honey in distant hives. The
 noon sun beats down, but you're not paying attention. You are
 completely relaxed by the scent of floating pollen.

 Now, if only she were here. Your mother, that is.

 [Your score has just gone up by four points.]

>examine pollen
 befo


 In the sunlight, the yellow flowers appear as a rustling fleece of
 gold.

>sneeze
 befo


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>smell
 befo


 You close your eyes, sniffing the air. The memories are as fresh as
 yesterday's: hiding amongst the shelves at your mother's florist
 store, going out with her in the summer to pick fresh daffodils, that
 night at Maiden's-- no, that never took place. Mercedes is still
 alive, walking with you in the field.

 "Lisa, it's been eight years. I've felt so alone without you for
 company. Aren't you happy to see me after all this time? Come closer,
 let me give you a hug."

 Mercedes opens her arms wide.

>hug mercedes
 befo


 Your mother embraces you, patting you on the back. Dancing gracefully
 in the bed of daffodils, she kisses you on both cheeks, then your
 lips. Mercedes changes in appearance, becoming taller, blonde,
 muscular. You feel light headed, collapsing into the daffodils. The
 field is stepped, like an aisle in the auditorium.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Auditorium, intersection J-08</span>
 People have risen from their seats, hands in the air as they await the
 entrance of Thomas Hurst, mayor of Atlantic City. Over the auditorium
 speakers, you hear a classical concerto played by violinists of the
 Gustav symphony orchestra. The main performance is scheduled to begin
 in a few minutes' time.

 Aisle J slopes upwards from the stage. Taking the centre of the
 auditorium to be north, row 08 circles to the east and west.

 Mistletoe's seat is adjacent to the aisle.

 There is nothing on Mistletoe's seat.

 You have a peculiar taste in your mouth, and the feeling of something
 clamped on your throat. Not Mistletoe-- she sits in her seat, dressed
 as a steward, licking chocolate ice-cream off a wafered cornet. No,
 you're dying from a contact poison mixed into her lipstick.
 Slow-acting, painful, the kiss of death.

 The odour distracts you.

 "What's the matter, Lisa? Don't you love me?"

>hit mom
 befo


 Summoning up all the will you can muster, you punch your mother-- no,
 Mistletoe in the face. In truth, it was her dissolved tablet which
 protected you from her perfume, but she believes it was your mental
 strength alone. Stunned, she falls into the flower beds. You turn,
 dashing through the field of daffodils.

 Once away from the assassin's influence, the hallucination is
 shattered. Behind you, Mistletoe aims her needle rifle. Trained killer
 that she is, at this range she cannot miss-- except she never takes
 the shot, smiling in admiration as she places the weapon on her lap.
 When you stop running, you find yourself...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Auditorium, intersection M-15</span>
 People have risen from their seats, hands in the air as they await the
 entrance of Thomas Hurst, mayor of Atlantic City. Over the auditorium
 speakers, you hear a classical concerto played by violinists of the

 Aisle M slopes upwards from the stage. Taking the centre of the
 auditorium to be north, row 15 circles to the east and west.

 During your escapade, you held onto the Staff of Justice, but that's
 about all. The theatre announcer speaks crisply over the tannoy.

 "Could Miss Kerry Hart please report understage immediately? The
 orchestra is in need of its reserve oboe player. Miss Kerry Hart,

 The entrance door is opened by a man in greasy overalls: balding,
 spotted face, stooped forward. He steps aside, letting you past.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Understage</span>
 Technically you are backstage, but that would imply you were behind,
 rather than beneath, the auditorium proper. Quirks aside, the
 definition remains in force: a changing area for theatre performers is
 to the north, opposite the entrance, and it is from here that one
 climbs upstairs.

 A hunchbacked electrician supervises the scenery controls.

 The old man locks the door behind you.

 "You that Kerry woman? Where you been? Can't keep the mayor waiting,
 or my head will roll. Get your things together, and join the other
 ladies onstage."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dressing Room</span>
 Actresses and their ilk have a better choice of performance gear than
 they have privacy. Rack after rack of suits, dresses and costumes are
 available for their use, but changing facilities are limited to open
 fronted booths without screens or doors. A poor show, considering the
 theatre's reputation.

 You can only assume an orchestra member has played a practical joke,
 dressing a mannequin in a draped veil, and placing an oboe in its
 hands.

 The hat is wide-brimmed, with a long, draping piece of maroon cloth
 tied behind. Together with the black, opaque veil, anybody wearing
 this costume is completely anonymous. Three narrow, elliptical slits
 have been cut out from the criss-cross pattern: two for the eyes, and
 one for the mouth.

 Behind the scenes, plaza theatre employees are treated no better than
 those who work at the average company: poor wages, few holidays,
 greasy work overalls. To his credit, the electrician doesn't complain.
 Despite back trouble, the old man hunches over a control panel, doing
 the job most theatregoers take for granted.

>go up

 You take a deep breath, and climb onstage.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Auditorium</span> (on the stage)
 For the crowd, the wait is over. The curtain has risen, the cameras
 are rolling, and stewards have stopped serving refreshments. Standing
 around the perimeter of the stage are the veiled women of the Gustav
 symphony orchestra, chins on violas and woodwind instruments to their
 lips.

 Thomas Hurst, mayor of Atlantic City, stands centre stage, preparing
 to give his millennial address over the auditorium speakers.

 The mayor taps on a microphone in front of him, silencing the crowd.

 "People of Atlantic City, we gather here tonight in celebration. In
 recognition of our past, and in hope for the future. This speech is
 not about me, but every one of us, how we can make our city a great
 place to live, work and play in the twenty-first century. On then,
 with the show!"

 Silence falls on the auditorium as the orchestra strike the first
 chords of the national anthem. You can't see her, but you know
 Mistletoe is out there, sights centred on Thomas Hurst. And Lisa Flint
 too, if she doesn't blend in.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>wait

 Time passes.

 You do look strange standing by yourself.

>join orchestra

 You take up the last remaining orchestra position, facing towards the
 aisle. The circle of thirteen is complete, but the eyes of the crowd
 have followed you over the stage. To them, you're still the odd lady
 out.

>play staff

 It's not really an oboe, so you'll have to pretend.

 A child sitting on her mother's back mimes a trumpet player.

>put staff in mouth
 befo


 You place the staff in your mouth, pressing randomly along its length
 as you try to imitate a natural musician. It satisfies the crowd: they
 turn their attention towards the mayor. Maybe you should, too.
 Somewhere in the auditorium, Mistletoe is planning the climax of his
 career.

 Thomas Hurst acknowledges a wave from the crowd.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>examine audience
 befo


 Men, women and surprisingly well-behaved children dressed in their
 best clothes. Somebody near the stage must have stood up, setting off
 a chain reaction all the way to the back of the auditorium. A crowd of
 faces, constantly shifting, hiding behind each other: the perfect
 cover for Mistletoe.

 Thomas Hurst acknowledges a wave from the crowd.

>examine stewards
 befo


 The stewards have retreated to the rear of the auditorium, relaxing
 after their hard work. Hold on-- that blonde refreshments seller
 loitering around the exit, with a needle rifle on her tray. That's
 Mistletoe!

 The music echoes through the auditorium.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>examine tray
 befo


 For Mistletoe, the white shirt and trousers are several sizes too
 small, fitting tightly around her body, outlining her muscular
 physique. The assassin rests her needle rifle on a beverages tray
 strapped onto her waist, a selection of hot and cold drinks in loosely
 capped polystyrene cups.

>attract tray
 befo


 Choosing a polystyrene cup, you force open the lid by telekinesis.
 Mistletoe is briefly distracted, taking one hand off her rifle,
 dipping it inside the carton and licking banana milkshake from her
 fingers. Mistletoe pauses, inspecting the opened cup, evidently
 concerned as she replaces the lid.

>attract tray
 befo


 Choosing a polystyrene cup, you force open the lid by telekinesis.
 Mistletoe is briefly distracted, taking one hand off her rifle,
 dipping it inside the carton and licking banana milkshake from her
 fingers. Then she stops, grabbing hold of her needle rifle and aiming
 it centre stage.

 The mayor's head jerks backwards, a penny-sized hole between his eyes,
 dripping red with blood, a clean tunnel hollowed from his skull. You
 trace back the path of the needle-- and there stands his assassin, her
 smoking rifle held casually, as proud as Thomas Hurst was during his
 final day in office.

 fingers. Then she stops, grabbing hold of her needle rifle and aiming
 it centre stage.

 The mayor's head jerks backwards, a penny-sized hole between his eyes,
 dripping red with blood, a clean tunnel hollowed from his skull. You
 trace back the path of the needle-- and there stands his assassin, her
 smoking rifle held casually, as proud as Thomas Hurst was during his
 final day in office.

 Mistletoe is briefly distracted, taking one hand off her rifle,

 Unwittingly, the assassin leaves her telescopic sight resting over the
 steaming liquid. Realising her mistake, she snatches away the needle
 rifle, but the lens has already steamed up with condensation.

 You sprint towards the mayor, leaping off the stage, experiencing
 everything in slow motion: gasps of astonishment from the crowd, their
 figurehead watching in disbelief as you reach out, ready to throw him
 to the ground. And then...

 Mistletoe aims her rifle blind, firing a shot. The microphone, inches
 away from the mayor's head, is blown off its stand, sparks and
 shredded metal flying onto the stage. The screams of the stunned
 auditorium crowd drain out the electrical feedback whining over the
 speakers.

 A split second later, you are on top of the mayor, pushing him down as
 a second needle rips through the drape of your veil, the force tearing
 away the hat. The assassin lines up a third, surely fatal, shot.
 Thinking fast, the old man below has lowered the curtain, blocking
 Mistletoe's view at the crucial moment.

 Your identity is there for all to see, but nobody is looking. Outside,
 you hear the crowd scramble towards the theatre exit, and the women of
 the orchestra are doing the same, following the relieved mayor
 downstairs.

 embedded in the torn ligament. The same thing happens with your left,
 then both your elbows. Mistletoe joins you understage, discarding her
 rifle as she bends over you.

 "And I thought you were an intelligent girl. Are you in pain, Madame
 Crusader? I can make you comfortable. I'm very good when it comes to
 handling ladies. Do you want to see how I treat-- special people in my

 The Crusader has a special place in the tower's heart. Statues of the
 Great Four watch from recesses around the octagonal rim: Alexia,
 Felicia, Elsa, and Claire. Further down, silhouetted against the
 projected beam of white light, are the two hands of Atlantic City's
 memorial clock. Gold, like the heroine herself.

 You're within touching distance of the statue of Alexia.

 Wind? But you're indoors-- so that's what it was: a helicopter
 gunship. The Baron salutes you from behind the controls.

 "You seem to have forgotten your horse. Good, now I can eliminate you

 wielding a broadsword.

 The statue is mounted on a turntable, from which Alexia faces west.

 Or Lady Felicia, as she preferred to be known during the 1600s. And
 she looks as pompous as she sounds, decked out in a Tudor doublet and
 admiring her reflection in a hand mirror. Still, she did expose a
 treacherous nobleman and save the life of the king, so she deserves
 some respect.

 The statue is mounted on a turntable, from which Felicia faces north.

 Ah yes, the permanent Crusader, so named since she never wore the
 halo, electing instead to cover her face with a golden helmet, and
 ride a black stallion as she patrolled the streets of depression-era
 Atlantic City. It was only once she died that people found out her
 real name: Elsa Winchurch.

 The statue is mounted on a turntable, from which Elsa faces east.

 "I took it upon myself to make a minor alteration to the rooftop
 setup. A simple exchange: gunpowder for alsanine. That's right,
 Mistletoe's captivating brand of perfume, a chemical of my own design.
 One drop is enough to entice the strongest willed of subjects into
 unquestioning obedience."

 You're sure the punchline is on its way.

 Never in a thousand years would you suspect this to be Claire Caseley,
 the woman who was saddled in the golden horse for the most violent
 decade in Atlantic City history, the terrorist-plagued 1980s. She is
 the epitome of a housewife, wearing an apron and family locket. Who
 would have thought she was the Crusader?

 The statue is mounted on a turntable, from which Claire faces south.

 "Tonight, several kilos will be dispersed over Memorial Square. Just
 imagine the effect that little lot will have, considering Atlantic
 City's major powerbrokers are all here for the show. Under its
 influence, they'll give me whatever I wish: my associates' release,
 immunity, mayordom. Interesting, that last one."

 A true megolomaniac, the Baron's ego has got the better of him. Now he
 has given you details of his plan, four and a half minutes, every
 reason to stop him-- and one clear objective: prevent the memorial
 clock from reaching midnight.

 Alexia of the West, the fourteenth century warrior princess who
 brought peace to her domain after decades of civil unrest. Rhyming
 melodrama you might think, but the story of this Crusader is taught to
 every child. She looks the part, dressed in gold battle armour and
 wielding a broadsword.

 The statue is mounted on a turntable, from which Alexia faces west.

 The arm of Alexia, a weapon forged by her father, and handed the
 princess at her coronation. She holds the broadsword as any
 right-handed warrior would: pointing vertically upwards, with the
 cutting edge on her front side. The blade widens at its centre,
 meaning the flats aren't straight, but triangular.

 "Don't be getting any ideas, Madame Crusader. This is an eight
 thousand megawatt laser capable of cutting steel, stone and titanium.
 I find it works particularly well on human flesh but, sadly for you,
 not on armoured glass. No, that requires almost twice the-- oh, let's

 The locket is closed, and its outside surface has dulled with age.

 successor. I even have to remain alert in case she tries to do away
 with me before time. No human being on this Earth was meant to equal
 Mistletoe, yet you somehow managed it."

 At the tip of each hand is one half of a copper circuit breaker.

 "Take a look around, Madame Crusader. What do you see? I'll tell you:
 a memorial to those heroines who failed to protect their charges, just

 a hundred metre drop, nothing to break the fall, whilst blinded by
 white light and ravaged by wind. But since you insist, you set off on
 a trip down Memorial Tower, waving your arms and slashing them open on
 the clock's hands.

 You have a few memories of your own: the fateful events at Maiden's
 Wharf, Amy's smile as she handed you the Staff of Justice, the
 underground lair of the silver moon cult, the duel with Hydra, the
 aerial dogfight with the toymaker, Charlotte Anne's magic, Mistletoe's
 perfume-- and the suicide jumper.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Clock Face</span>
 Memorial Tower, Atlantic City's most famous landmark, a limestone
 monument built in honour of the many citizens who gave their lives in
 pursuit of worthy causes. A crowd has gathered in the square below,
 gazing skyward at the famous projected image of the clock as it ticks
 away the last seconds of the twentieth century.

 The golden horse has landed on a corner spire, inches away from the
 clock face.

 Fireworks line the tower roof, ready to dazzle the anticipant
 spectators.

 Joyful cheers ring around Memorial Square.

>examine clock

 A timepiece unique to Atlantic City, the memorial clock is simple in
 theory, yet imaginative in execution: the gears, numerals and hands
 are housed inside, above a lighthouse-style beam. It is the image the
 everyday citizen sees, projected in the sky by a focusing lens: a
 huge, octagonal clock face on the tower roof.

 The present time appears to be 11:54.

 You stroll to the centre of the glass face, covering your eyes as you
 stare down into the light. The time is easy to read: eleven fifty-four

 hands. So the long, thin, blurry shadow must be something else...

 The Crusader has a special place in the tower's heart. Statues of the
 Great Four watch from recesses around the octagonal rim: Alexia,
 Felicia, Elsa, and Claire. Further down, silhouetted against the
 projected beam of white light, are the two hands of Atlantic City's
 memorial clock. Gold, like the heroine herself.

 You're within touching distance of the statue of Alexia.

 A fierce cyclone presses you against the tower walls. You don't
 remember how you got here, only snippets of information: a bright red
 flash, the floor giving way under your feet, raining glass-- wait!
 Wind? But you're indoors-- so that's what it was: a helicopter
 gunship. The Baron salutes you from behind the controls.

 "You seem to have forgotten your horse. Good, now I can eliminate you
 any time I want. Very tempting, since you've done your best to
 interfere with my millennial events programme. But the star of
 tonight's show will be the fireworks, arranged to commence at the
