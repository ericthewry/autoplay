 You wake up. A routine look at the alarm clock reveals the time; in
 five minutes, it would have gone off, but as usual, you didn't even
 need it. As you won't become more awake, you turn it off.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom</span> (on the bed)
 Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the
 rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room
 when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye
 for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been
 insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the
 things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at
 least!

 Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room
 from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite
 to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front
 of it.

 On the nightstand, you can see your wallet.

>examine me


 The pajamas are of the white-dark-blue striped variety, although the
 white bits have turned just a little bit gray by now.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   some pajamas (being worn)

>remove pajamas


 You take off the pajamas.

>examine me


 You look down at yourself and notice nothing out of the ordinary.

>examine calendar


 It's a calendar of the year 1959. You are up-to-date.

>take calendar


 You get off the bed first.

 It's already perfectly aligned. It seems a shame to touch it.

>examine nightstand


 It's a small wooden table; Margaret has already exchanged it a couple
 of times since you moved in. You refrained from asking why.

 On the nightstand, you see your wallet, next to that is an alarm
 clock.

>examine clock


 The alarm clock is currently switched off.

>take wallet


 Taken.

>open wallet


 You open the wallet, revealing some keys and some money.

>examine keys


 Your house keys.

 You have got just the right amount of money in your wallet. Not too
 much, not too little.

 The window has been cleaned to a spotless shine.

>open window


 (the window)
 Margaret has established an elaborate ventilation scheme which you
 don't want to mess around with.

>open wardrobe


 In the wardrobe, you see a dark suit right in front, behind that a
 light brown suit and a couple of other suits.

>push wardrobe


 There is no reason to do that right now.

>examine suit


 Which do you mean, the formal suit or the corduroy suit?

>examine formal


 The formal suit is dark and classically cut - the right choice for the
 office.

>examine corduroy


 A light brown corduroy suit.

 You never run around the house naked. Margaret wouldn't like that.

 You put on the pajamas.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room</span>
 This is the house's central hub. All other rooms, i.e. the bedroom,
 the kitchen, the bathroom and the currently unused room, can be
 reached from here. Aside from that, the front door, located next to a
 large panorama window, leads right into this room. Because of the
 number of exits, there isn't actually all this much usable space
 available, but Margaret has come up with a clever arrangement of the
 sofa and the matching table as well as the slender floor lamp which
 really gets the maximum out of it!

>examine sofa


 Comfy.

>examine table


 This table has only recently been bought by Margaret and it sports a
 small glass surface in the center. Not particularly practical, but it
 certainly looks good.

 On the right side of the table, a telephone, a radio and an ashtray
 are standing right beside each other. Right in the middle, the morning
 paper is well visible.

>examine ashtray


 A flawlessly clean ashtray.

>examine telephon


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine telephone


 The line to the outer world.

>examine radio


 A modern device which you like to switch on after work.
 The radio receiver is currently switched off.

>examine paper


 With a rustle, you open the large paper and scan through the
 headlines. A painful pulse inside your head prevents you from
 concentrating and gets worse as you dig into the paper, the harder you
 feel the sharp pain. You wonder if you can go to work today.

>examine lamp


 You would have preferred a ceiling lamp.
 The floor lamp is currently switched off.

>bathroom


 Although you have intuitively memorized these paths, as you turn
 towards the bathroom you bump your leg on the couch. Well, maybe you
 are not really awake yet, after all.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 The bathroom's walls are brightly tiled. Even though you can't tell
 for sure, you would bet that Margaret cleans it daily. Appropriate to
 your house's year of construction, the facilities are modern. For
 example, you had a shower built in instead of a tub. Next to that,
 there is a sink with a mirror hung to the wall above, and on the
 opposite side of the room, there is a toilet. A small cabinet stands
 on the side wall. The only exit leads into the living room.

>examine shower


 Ready for use.

>examine sink


 The all-ceramic facilities did cost quite a bit. Fortunately, your
 parents and also your wife's parents were actually quite happy when
 they heard about your plans to build your own home and they supported
 you.

>examine mirror


 The mirror has got one of these modern, thin frames. Elaborate
 ornaments are out of style, you were told in the store.

>look in mirror


 You take a look in the mirror to confirm; no, you really don't look
 too good!

>examine toilet


 Like all facilities in this room, the toilet is still very new.

>examine cabinet


 In there, you store the towels which are currently not in use,
 Margaret's cosmetics as well as additional toilet paper. On top of the
 cabinet, there is a porcelain swan for decoration. The cabinet door is
 closed.

>open cabinet


 You open the cabinet, revealing some towels, some cosmetics and some
 toilet paper.

>examine towels


 The towels are pristine white. On the sides, Margaret has embroidered
 small designs.

>examine designs


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine cosmetics


 These things belong to Margaret.

>examine paper


 (the newspaper)
 In your worrying condition, you are not able to read.

>examine toilet paper


 It's just regular toilet paper.

>examine swan


 An artfully curvy figure of a swan which Margaret found on a garage
 sale.

>take swan


 You really don't need it.

>break swan


 What do you want to break the porcelain swan with?

>use sink


 You flush the toilet. Content, you realize it is working without a
 hitch.

>use toilet


 You sit down on the toilet and do what's necessary.

>use shower


 Worried about your condition, you realize that you have sweated quite
 a lot last night. You enter the shower and wash yourself as well as
 pssible, put the pajamas on again and shave. Your ashen face looks
 back at you.

>dance


 You've never been much of a dancer.

>xyzzy


 There's a listening sort of silence.

>dry me


 You have already freshened up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This is Margaret's realm. For you, it's more a passage between the
 living room and the garden. In front of you, the familiar sight
 unfolds of Margaret standing with her back to you, slightly bent over
 the countertop and hard at work with her kitchen utensils. On the
 level of her head, a row of cabinets hangs on the wall and on another
 wall, there is a refrigerator.

>kiss margaret


 After giving Margaret a small peck on the cheek, she tells you:
 "Please don't work late again today, honey!" She passes you the usual
 brown paper bag in which you can find your lunch: "I have packed a
 little surprise as well."

 You try your best to look pitiful as you tell Margaret  about your
 condition. She listens attentively and then gets a thermometer from
 one of the drawers. "Open your mouth, honey!", she orders. You let it
 all happen. Your temperature is indeed a little too high. Margaret
 says it's your decision whether to go to work or rather call the
 office to excuse yourself and then go back to bed.

>examine bag


 Margaret has marked it with your name in her neat handwriting. She
 diligently does that every day. Not that any of your coworkers would
 ever think of stealing your lunch, but you don't have the heart to
 tell Margaret it's not necessary.

>open bag


 Margaret stops you: "Please don't open it yet, honey, I want you to
 see the surprise in the office."

>examine utensils


 The knife looks sharp.

>examine cabinets


 Margaret uses them to store her dishes and pots.

>take knife


 Margaret doesn't like you playing around with her things.

>examine refrigerator


 It is bright white.

>open refrigerator


 You would only mess up the well-organized contents.

 This room, which can be reached from the living room, is currently
 unused. You have some hopeful plans for it, of course, but they
 haven't worked out yet. Until then, Margaret has decided not to use
 the room for anything at all to avoid any discussion later. You
 haven't even painted the walls, to be flexible as far as the coloring
 is concerned as soon as its new inhabitant will move in. There is a
 connecting door in the direction of your bedroom.

 It is a nice, big window which bathes the room in bright light right
 around noon. The window-sill is decorated with small figures.

 Margaret has collected this ensemble with great care and patience over

 fact, they are even made from completely different materials like clay
 or tin), Margaret managed to achieve a great harmonic homogeneity with
 her remarkable eye for detail.

 your doubtful state of health. After all, what would happen to the
 world if everyone skipped work at the smallest twinge?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street (in front of your house)</span>
 The street is running in an east-west direction. The only buildings
 are on the northern side. You stand in front of your door. You are

 you admire the leaves shining with morning dew. It never occured to
 you how varied their patterns are. The bus's honking seems to fade
 from your perception.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (western entrance)</span>
 You're at the park's entrance. To the north, there is the street and
 the park itself continues in eastern and southern directions. You can
 really consider yourselves lucky to have this green oasis right in
 front of your door. Unfortunately, you hardly ever get the chance to
 savor it.

>stop and smell the flowers


 You can't see any such thing.

>savor


 That's not a verb I recognize.

 You decide to leave bus and job be and just take a day off. You settle
 down on one of the benches, close your eyes and savor the silence.
 Fresh air enters your nose and you inhale deeply. In a great mood, you
 return home in the evening. Margaret awaits you on the doorstep. Of
 course, your boss called when you didn't show up at the office.
 Margaret's mood lies somewhere between relief that nothing serious has
 happened, and then deep shock and total lack of comprehension when you

 Your workplace is in this corner of the office. It consists of a desk,
 which you keep tidy, and a matching chair. Which means your equipment
 is pretty much the same as that of your coworkers. From afar, you can
 see the big filing cabinet, the boss's secretary and your coworker
 Harold in the other corners of the office.

 You can also see a brown paper bag (which is closed) here.

 This is the workplace of your closest coworker, Harold, who is
 currently sitting at his desk. Your own workplace is on the other side

 As you approach his desk, Harold looks up smiling: "Already had lunch?
 It would be time."

>examine harold


 Harold joined the company some years before you, so when you joined,
 he was there to show you the ropes. Working together with him worked
 very well right from the start, because you have earned his respect

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office (at the secretary's desk)</span>
 As usual, this desk is occupied by your boss's busy secretary. She
 isn't just there for everything the boss doesn't want to do himself,
 but she is also the guardian of the door to his office. The rest of
 the office contains your desk, Harold's, and a large filing cabinet.
 Another door leads out of the office into the corridor, which, among
 other things leads to the washroom.

 Taking your lunch into the washroom would be quite unhygienic.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Washroom</span>

 bag. Your smile freezes even before you actually see the whole mess:
 An unbelievable stench hits you right in the face! Inside, you find an
 obviously rotten piece of meat. Margaret can't possibly be involved in
 this... the only explanation you have is that one of your coworkers
 wanted to play a trick on you, but why?

>eat meat

 Your revulsion is such that you can't bear to touch the meat. No

>put lunch in cabinet


 You can't just leave it here.

>out


 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>washroom


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>secretary



 As you approach this part of the office, you see the mail boy moving
 towards your desk.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office (at the secretary's desk)</span>
 As usual, this desk is occupied by your boss's busy secretary. She
 isn't just there for everything the boss doesn't want to do himself,
 but she is also the guardian of the door to his office. The rest of
 the office contains your desk, Harold's, and a large filing cabinet.
 Another door leads out of the office into the corridor, which, among
 other things leads to the washroom.

>out


 It is generally not appreciated for staff to hang out in other offices
 too much, and since you just went, you feel no urgency to use the
 toilet again.

>washroom


 It is generally not appreciated for staff to hang out in other offices

>drop lunch


 You can't just leave it here.

>examine desk


 (the desk)
 This is the only desk in this office that's equipped with a typewriter
 and a telephone.

>examine telephone


 Modern.

>call wife


 This phone isn't intended to be freely used by everyone.

>examine typewriter


 It's one of those modern models which produce a particularly clean
 type face. The secretary must be hitting three words per second. You
 can't type at all.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a brown paper bag (which is open)
     a rotten lump of meat
   a formal suit (being worn)
   a wallet (which is open)
     some keys (which opens the front door)
     some money

>search suit


 You find nothing of interest.

>desk


 As you approach your desk again, you catch a glimpse of the mail boy
 leaving. What might he have brought you?


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office (by your desk)</span>
 Your workplace is in this corner of the office. It consists of a desk,
 which you keep tidy, and a matching chair. Which means your equipment
 is pretty much the same as that of your coworkers. From afar, you can
 see the big filing cabinet, the boss's secretary and your coworker
 Harold in the other corners of the office.

 The mail boy has put something on your desk.

>examine something


 The envelope is addressed to you.

>open envelope


 You tear the envelope open and discover - surprise, surprise, a
 letter.

>read letter


 (the letter)
 You read the letter. Strange: it seems to be about a subject which
 isn't your responsibility at all. You re-read the opening of the
 letter: you are directly addressed by name. Whereever would the sender
 have gotten the idea from that you were right one to send this to?

>read letter

>examine envelope


 The envelope is addressed to you. You have already opened it.

>eat letter

 That's plainly inedible.

>harold



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office (by Harold's desk)</span>
 This is the workplace of your closest coworker, Harold, who is
 currently sitting at his desk. Your own workplace is on the other side
 of the office: other than that, you can go to the boss's secretary or
 to the filing cabinet.

>give letter to harold


 Harold carefully studies the document you've given him. After getting
 an overview, he looks at you questioningly: "I'm really surprised.
 This isn't a particularly complex case. You've already dealt with
 dozens of similar ones, haven't you?" An uncontrollable dizziness
 overcomes you. <span class="floydstyle em">This</span> was the last thing you expected! Unable
 to cope with this situation, you take a step back from Harold's desk
 without saying another word.

>ask harold about job


 Although Hardold faces you politely, it's obvious that he isn't
 interested in this subject and would rather return to his work.

>examine letter


 You read the letter. Strange: it seems to be about a subject which

 isn't just there for everything the boss doesn't want to do himself,
 but she is also the guardian of the door to his office. The rest of
 the office contains your desk, Harold's, and a large filing cabinet.
 Another door leads out of the office into the corridor, which, among
 other things leads to the washroom.

>ask secretary about letter


 "All right, go in."

>in


 (opening the boss's office door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boss's Office</span>
 In this department, your manager is the only staff member to have his
 own office. Apart from this privilege, his workplace is quite similar
 to those of his subordinates, meaning he sits behind a similar desk
 next to which stands a small filing cabinet. The door leads back to
 the bigger office in which you have your desk.

>examine boss


 Your boss is a slightly, but not excessively overweight man with
 sparse hair, although he isn't much older than you. His suit is a
 little ill-fitting in the slightly bulging belly area, but at least
 his tie is impeccable. As usual, his pipe is protuding from the corner
 of his mouth. He looks at you expectantly..

 <span class="floydstyle em">her</span>! None of <span class="floydstyle em">my</span> exployees would dare to do anything
 like that, so don't bother me with it!"

>examine pipe


 The brown body of the pipe has been gleamingly polished.

>show letter to boss


 (the letter to your boss)
 You put the letter on the boss's desk. He gives it a quick glance and
 then looks back up at you: "This should be doable for you." You're not
 given a choice, so you summon all your courage to explain to him that
 you're not familiar with this subject and the necessary steps to be
 taken in such a case; you have no idea at all what it's about or what
 is to be done. While you are talking, you see your boss's brow
 furrowing, but he lets you continue. After you're done talking, there
 is an awkward moment of silence. "You seem to be overworked. Actually,
 your face looks quite pale. It's almost half past four, why don't you
 take the rest of the day off? It's OK to do that once in a while on a
 Friday." Half past four? You look at the wall clock - indeed, that is
 the time! "I will take care of this myself", your boss continues, "and
 let your wife really pamper you this weekend. Relax - and I want you
 back at full strength on Monday!"

 Relieved about not having received a major scolding, you leave the
 office stunned. You are hardly aware of the bus ride home as your
 thoughts are still circling around these strange events. You simply
 can't unravel it. Maybe you are really just overworked and your mind
 was playing tricks on you?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Press any key to continue</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street (in front of your house)</span>
 The street is running in an east-west direction. The only buildings
 are on the northern side. You stand in front of your door. You are
 well acquainted with the neighbors on the right side. On the other
 side of the street, there is a park.

>enter house


 Which do you mean, the north or the east?

>go south


 I only understood you as far as wanting to enter the south.

>go north


 As you enter the living room, Margaret welcomes you with a brilliant
 smile. "Honey, it's so nice that you are back home so early!" As you
 look into her auburn eyes, the feeling that this will be an awkward
 conversation creeps up on you.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room</span>
 This is the house's central hub. All other rooms, i.e. the bedroom,
 the kitchen, the bathroom and the currently unused room, can be
 reached from here. Aside from that, the front door, located next to a
 large panorama window, leads right into this room. Because of the
 number of exits, there isn't actually all this much usable space
 available, but Margaret has come up with a clever arrangement of the
 sofa and the matching table as well as the slender floor lamp which
 really gets the maximum out of it!

 Margaret looks in the direction of the floor lamp in a slightly sour
 way. Maybe she discovered a tiny layer of dust.

>ask margaret about lunch


 You show the bag's contents to Margaret. All color drains from her
 face. Before you can even elaborate on your suspicions, she suddenly
 turns bright red. With a raised voice, a flood of words is poured over
 you. She thinks that you are suspecting her of having packed this on
 purpose. Nothing would be further from your mind, but now, her honor
 as a housewife is injured; you can't dissuade her from this theory. In
 a frosty tone, Margaret wishes you a good night. On the bedroom's
 doorstep, she stiffly turns around once more: "I hope that you won't
 misbehave like this tomorrow when the neighbors come to visit!" You
 say nothing.

>bedroom



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the
 rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room
 when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye
 for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been
 insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the
 things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at
 least!

 Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room
 from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite
 to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front
 of it.

 On the bed is Margaret.

 You can see some pajamas here.

 living room and the garden. The kitchen is furnished with a
 countertop, above that a row of cupboards and a brand new
 refrigerator.

 You can either go to the living room or through the back door into the
 garden from here.

>go through door


 (opening the back door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 The garden is not all that large, but that makes it low-maintenance.
 It mainly consists of a well-cared-for lawn. At the fence, separating
 it from the neighbors' property, rises an oak tree. A trashcan sits by
 the door leading back to the kitchen.

>open trash


 You open the trashcan, revealing a newspaper.

>take newspaper


 The newspaper belongs in the trash.

>read newspaper


 The morning paper.

>throw bag in trash


 Aggressively, you stuff the bag containing the rotten meat into the
 trashcan. Phew, it's as though a load has been lifted from your
 shoulders!

>close trash


 You close the trashcan.

 This tree was planted by Margaret and yourself when you moved in. It
 hasn't quite grown to the impressive size you've been dreaming about.

 The oak isn't strong enough yet to carry your weight.

 The bathroom's walls are brightly tiled. Even though you can't tell
 for sure, you would bet that Margaret cleans it daily. Appropriate to
 your house's year of construction, the facilities are modern. For
 example, you had a shower built in instead of a tub. Next to that,
 there is a sink with a mirror hung to the wall above, and on the
 opposite side of the room, there is a toilet. A small cabinet stands

 This room, which can be reached from the living room, is currently
 unused. You have some hopeful plans for it, of course, but they
 haven't worked out yet. Until then, Margaret has decided not to use
 the room for anything at all to avoid any discussion later. You
 haven't even painted the walls, to be flexible as far as the coloring
 is concerned as soon as its new inhabitant will move in. There is a
 connecting door in the direction of your bedroom.

 Entering the living room, you look right into Margaret's radiant face.
 Yesterday's aggravation seems to have vanished. "A wonderful morning
 to you, honey!", she chirps. "The neighbors will come by tonight. I'm
 so excited!" You're not so keen on the two; the neighbor is a show-off
 and his wife a boring chatterbox. Not that this is a good reason to
 start a fight now, so you don't say anything. "By the way, I have of
 course already told Dorothy, they are aware, but as the man of the
 house, you have to go over and invite them officially to our nice
 dinner." Without even waiting for any possible answer from your side,
 Margaret disappears into the kitchen.

 You step into the queue in front of the ice cream cart. Near the front
 of the line, a head is visible above all of the children. It belongs
 to a man wearing a dark rain coat.

 You take a closer look at the man in the raincoat. Even though you
 only have an angled view of his back, you can't help but think that
 this must be your coworker Harold. He lives on the other side of town,
 and to your knowledge he has neither relatives nor friends around
 here. What business could he possibly have here?

 walks away in a westerly direction. You follow him with your eyes.

 Determined to unravel the mystery of Harold's behavior, you also pull
 yourself up the tree. Without thinking about it, you effortlessly move
 across fairly thin branches until you get close to Harold.

>talk to harold


 Harold has reached the highest possible point in the tree. He reaches
 towards the sky, where some clouds have gathered, as if he wants to
 grasp something.

 Finally, you get close enough to attract his attention. Though when
 this presumed Harold turns around on hearing your call, you realize
 that you were mistaken. It isn't Harold, but a little boy. His smooth
 facial features could resemble what Harold might have looked like when
 he was about eight, but his build is completely different, of course.

 While you remain frozen, dumbfounded, the boy, who seems to think you
 caught him doing something forbidden, jumps down to the ground and
 runs away.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Park (at the large tree)</span> (on the massive tree)
 This part of the park is dominated by a particularly massive tree. In
 its shadow, there is a bench. Paths lead back in eastern and northern
 directions.

 From the solid branch on which you sit, a smaller one protrudes.

>take branch


 You break off the small branch.

>examine bench


 A comfortable wooden bench.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (western entrance)</span>
 You're at the park's entrance. To the north, there is the street and

 front of your door. Unfortunately, you hardly ever get the chance to
 savor it.

>go east

 A group of children play catch.

 There's a small cloud right above your head which seems to follow you.

 Dreamily, you watch the happy children.

 A kid falls to the ground. Judging from its cries, it must have hurt

 To the east, the park ends in a fairly massive row of thorny bushes. A

 Although the bushes have obviously been pruned recently, the inner
 growth of their branches is wild and jumbled. Nevertheless, you spot a
 foreign object deep inside.

 You take a closer look - it is a crumpled blanket.

 The blanket is quite dirty. It probably belongs to a homeless person.
 The city should really do something about that!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This is Margaret's realm. For you, it's more a passage between the

 preparations of the big event which she has been eagerly awaiting for
 weeks. The kitchen is furnished with a row of cupboards and a brand
 new refrigerator.

 You don't need to cook.

 For just a moment, Margaret closes her eyes as she often does to
 collect her thoughts and then carries on with her work.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 The garden is not all that large, but that makes it low-maintenance.
 It mainly consists of a well-cared-for lawn. At the fence, separating
 it from the neighbors' property, rises an oak tree. A trashcan sits by
 the door leading back to the kitchen.

>look over fence


 You stretch and peer over the fence. Everything is all right in the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the
 rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room
 when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye
 for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been
 insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the
 things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at
 least!

 Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room
 from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite
 to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front
 of it.

>examine nightstand


 It's a small wooden table; Margaret has already exchanged it a couple
 of times since you moved in. You refrained from asking why.

 On the nightstand is an alarm clock.

 You press the button and hear the doorbell, followed by approaching

 This is the house's central hub. All other rooms, i.e. the bedroom,
 the kitchen, the bathroom and the currently unused room, can be
 reached from here. Aside from that, the front door, located next to a
 large panorama window, leads right into this room. Because of the
 number of exits, there isn't actually all this much usable space
 available, but Margaret has come up with a clever arrangement of the
 sofa and the matching table as well as the slender floor lamp which
 really gets the maximum out of it! Margaret wants the house to look
 its best and so, even several hours before the guests should arrive,
 she is already bustling about.

 Margaret adjusts a couple of things on the table.

>examine table


 This table has only recently been bought by Margaret and it sports a
 small glass surface in the center. Not particularly practical, but it
 certainly looks good.

 On the right side of the table, a telephone, a radio and an ashtray
 are standing right beside each other. Right in the middle, the morning
 paper is well visible.

 For just a moment, Margaret closes her eyes as she often does to
 collect her thoughts and then carries on with her work.

>read paper

 Government announcements... tensions rising in the Middle East... a
 Pope's visit... border incidents... nothing really strikes you as
 urgently readable.

 From the radio, a male voice booms.

 Margaret goes over the couch with a feather duster.

 Margaret is your wife. She likes to dress in bright, fresh colors.
 Today is no exception. She is occupied with the hosting preparations
 and she looks really happy.

>ask margaret about candy


 Before you can even say anything to Margaret, she takes the
 initiative: "Ah, honey, good that you're here. I still need a couple
 of things, can you quickly run off and buy them? You have got the list
 already, don't you?" With that, she turns her attention back away from
 you. What list?

   a newspaper
   a grocery list
   a wallet (which is open)
     some keys (which opens the front door)
     some money
   a corduroy suit (being worn)
   some pajamas

 Margaret adjusts a couple of things on the table.

>examine list


 To your surprise, the former ice cream stand sheet has turned into a
 very, very long grocery list. It is so long that you don't really know
 how to obtain all of this in such a short time.

>examine money


 You have got just the right amount of money in your wallet. Not too
 much, not too little.

 For just a moment, Margaret closes her eyes as she often does to
 collect her thoughts and then carries on with her work.

>out



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street (in front of your house)</span>
 The street is running in an east-west direction. The only buildings
 are on the northern side. You stand in front of your door. You are
 well acquainted with the neighbors on the right side. On the other
 side of the street, there is a park.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street (in front of the neighbors' house)</span>

 side of the street, there is the park.

>store


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>go east


 Nervous as you are, the shopping list slips out of your hand and falls
 to the ground.

>take list


 You pick up the shopping list again. Immediately, you notice that all
 the writing on it has disappeared. Of course, you haven't the faintest
 recollection of anything that was on the list - it would be completely
 useless to even go to the store now.

>go east


 Without the complete grocery list, going all the way to the store
 would be pointless.

>go west

>go north


 Head drawn-in, you enter the house again. Margaret, already in her
 evening dress now and her hair straightened, stands in front of you
 and shoots you a look of reproach, even before you can confess that
 you could not get the errands done. She points at the clock: "Last
 minute again! Where did you fool about this time?" It is actually
 almost six o'clock. Before you can arrange your thoughts, the door
 bell is already ringing. Since you're not moving a muscle, Margaret
 steps right past you with a derogatory sound from her throat, opens
 the door and welcomes Robert and Dorothy. You recover, take their
 coats and you all sit down. As assigned in advance, you take a seat
 left of Margaret.

>examine robert


 Your neighbor Robert is about your own age. He wears a sports jacket
 which looks custom-made.

>examine dorothy


 Dorothy looks over to Robert from time to time. Her smile looks as if
 it's engraved in her face.

>ask robert about candy


 You just don't manage to find the right moment: Every time you want to
 raise your voice, somebody else has already started talking so that it
 would be impolite to interrupt.

>wait


 Time seems to pass, but actually, it does not.

>eat


 What do you want to eat?

 (first taking Robert)
 I don't suppose Robert would care for that.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Living Room</span> (on the couch)
 This is the house's central hub. All other rooms, i.e. the bedroom,
 the kitchen, the bathroom and the currently unused room, can be
 reached from here. Aside from that, the front door, located next to a
 large panorama window, leads right into this room. Because of the
 number of exits, there isn't actually all this much usable space
 available, but Margaret has come up with a clever arrangement of the
 sofa and the matching table as well as the slender floor lamp which
 really gets the maximum out of it!

 Margaret, Robert and Dorothy are sitting around your table. They are
 more or less absorbed in small talk.

 On the living room table is a newspaper.

>examine table


 This table has only recently been bought by Margaret and it sports a
 small glass surface in the center. Not particularly practical, but it
 certainly looks good.

 On the right side of the table, a telephone, a radio and an ashtray
 are standing right beside each other. Next to that is a newspaper.

>smoke


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>kitchen


 Margaret shoots you a sharp sideways look. It would be quite rude to
 just stand up right now.

>ask margaret about candy


 Margaret is much too busy talking to the neighbors. You have no choice
 but to listen.

>listen


 Dorothy is proudly telling how, apart from doing her regular
 housework, she has begun tailoring, for which her husband has even
 equipped a dedicated room. Robert smugly smiles.

>listen


 Robert is telling a joke. Dorothy laughs a little too loudly and
 shrilly for your taste.

>listen


 Dorothy hands a couple of photos of her distant relatives around. Not
 that you know any of them.

>listen


 Swelling with pride, Robert tells about the "executive position" which
 he holds at work. Margaret looks at him just a little <span class="floydstyle em">too</span>
 admiringly for your taste.

>listen


 Robert and Dorothy are occupied with their usual banter.

>ask margaret about list


 Margaret is much too busy talking to the neighbors. You have no choice
 but to listen.

>listen


 Robert lets fall that he is allegedly personally acquainted with a
 second-rate pop singer. Blowhard.

>read paper


 (the grocery list)
 It's a long list of things which you have bought for the evening
 party.

>read newspaper


 There couldn't possibly be a more ill-mannered display of disrespect
 for your guests than opening the paper right now. For Margaret's sake,
 you let it be.

 The sports coat is brand new and it certainly wasn't ready-made.



 Margaret shoots you a sharp sideways look. It would be quite rude to

>take off jacket


 Margaret shoots you a sharp sideways look. It would be quite rude to

>turn on radio


 The barest glance in the direction of the radio is enough for you to
 feel Margaret's reproving look burning into your neck. You let it be.

>sleep


 You prefer the soft mattress of your bed.

>kiss margaret


 Margaret has hammered into you not to try something like this in front
 of the neighbors. But why? You are married, after all, and Dorothy is
 affectionately caressing Robert's shoulder at this very moment.

>iss dorothy


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>kiss dorothy


 If you did that, the only remaining option would be moving to another
 town.

>kiss robert


 You remember a sketch on a TV show: A man saw a long-haired person
 from behind, sitting on a pier. He came closer, smiling, but then
 recognized it was actually a man. Whatever next!

 standing in front of buildings.

 It is a nice, big window which bathes the room in bright light right
 around noon. The window-sill is decorated with small figures.

>peel the flesh from robert's face


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine figures


 Margaret has collected this ensemble with great care and patience over
 many months. In spite of only a few coming from the same source (in
 fact, they are even made from completely different materials like clay
 or tin), Margaret managed to achieve a great harmonic homogeneity with
 her remarkable eye for detail.

 Comfy.

 Margaret's voice attracts your attention back to the company at hand:
 "What do you think, honey?" Hectically, you turn your head to the
 right; an endless three seconds pass for you to realize that you are
 unexpectedly looking into <span class="floydstyle em">Dorothy's</span> face.

>yawn


 You prefer the soft mattress of your bed.

>examine dorotgy


 You can't see any such thing.

>say yes


 Whom do you want to say that to?

>examine dorothy


 You look around and find all eyes on you. A slight dizziness overcomes
 you and you fight it by focussing rightwards again. From there,
 Margaret looks at you with rising anxiety. Too much time has passed
 and you don't have the slightest clue what everybody was on about, so
 you just blurt out something incoherent. The neighbors exchange a
 telling, hardly disguised look. You fall silent again - this time, for
 the rest of the evening.

 A little later, Dorothy and Robert take their leave. You get up only
 mechanically to shake their hands, while Margaret fusses about and
 follows them to the door. You think you hear her whispering something
 to them. After the front door has closed again, your wife walks into
 the bedroom without saying another word.

>look

 You can see a newspaper here.

>read newspaper


 You get off the couch first.

 Taken.
 Government announcements... tensions rising in the Middle East... a
 Pope's visit... border incidents... nothing really strikes you as
 urgently readable.

>bedroom



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the
 rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room
 when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye
 for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been
 insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the
 things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at
 least!

 Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room
 from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite
 to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front
 of it.

 On the bed is Margaret.

>put on pajamas


 You take off the corduroy suit and slip the pajamas on.

>talk to margaret


 Margaret lies, her back turned towards you, in bed. You lean over a
 bit and see that her eyes are closed. You decide not to disturb her.

>fuck margaret


 This isn't the way mother brought you up!

>sleep


 Exhausted by today's exertions, sleep overcomes you almost
 immediately.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Press any key to continue</span>


 After waking from a dreamless night, you feel very refreshed.
 Yesterday's events now seem strangely unreal. As you open your eyes,
 the room is still pitch dark. Beside you, you hear the soothingly
 steady breathing of your wife. You feel towards the usual direction
 and recognize the light switch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>turn on light


 The light illuminates the room, but what unfolds in front of you isn't
 what you expected. Something is wrong, but drowsy as you are, you
 can't quite pin it down yet. Slowly, it dawns on you: this isn't
 <span class="floydstyle em">your</span> bedroom!

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom</span> (on the bed)
 The more you focus, even if you can't believe it, it becomes clearer
 to you that this isn't your bedroom. Margaret lies on the double bed,
 sleeping. Next to the bed, on the other side from her, there is the
 lamp you switched on. On the opposite wall, there's a wardrobe and a
 trouser press. Two doors, one to the south and one to the east, lead
 out of the room.

 On the trouser press is a sports coat.

 You can also see a wallet (in which are some keys (which opens the
 front door) and some money) here.

>examine calendar


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine coat


 The sports coat is brand new and it certainly wasn't ready-made.

>examine margaret


 You hear your wife's light breathing behind you, and turn over to be
 soothed by the sight of her features which are especially lovely in
 her sleep. You freeze - lying next to you, still in deep slumber, is
 <span class="floydstyle em">Dorothy</span>, your neighbor! You realize that this must be
 <span class="floydstyle em">her</span> bedroom. Not only are you two lying in bed together, but
 as you also only just notice, you are naked! How on earth did you get
 yourself into this embarrassing situation? You jump up; it's obvious
 that you should take off as quickly as possible and, even more
 importantly, unnoticed, before her husband returns!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 You're currently not in the mood to examine the room in more detail.
 The large double bed, on which Dorothy is lying, is immediately
 visible, of course. She is still asleep. Next to the bed, on your
 side, there is a lamp. On the opposite wall are a wardrobe and a
 trouser press. Two doors, one to the south and one to the east, lead
 into other rooms. Assuming a similar layout compared to your own
 house, one of these should lead to the living room.
 On the trouser press is a sports coat.

 You can also see a wallet (in which are some keys (which opens the
 front door) and some money) here.

>take margaret


 You can't see any such thing.

>take dorothy


 A thousand thoughts are running through your head, but you can't put
 them in order yet. You wouldn't know what to say to Dorothy. So you
 better don't wake her.

>examine me


 You are naked and, making things even worse, in a strange house!

 All of a sudden, Dorothy is standing behind you. Expecting the worst,

 expect: she smiles at you warmly. "I have watched you for some time
 now. Until today, I always assumed you only showed interest in my
 tailoring to make me happy. Given the number of things you tried on
 this morning, you must really like it." She is aglow with happiness
 now. You're still at a loss for words. She hands you another jacket:
 "Here, why don't you try this one? If it doesn't fit, I'll alter it
 with the sewing machine." Instinctively, you grab the jacket. "Or if
 you don't like it, I'll make something entirely different," she adds.
 Now, you're smiling as well - inwardly and outwardly.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room</span>
 The neighbors' living room contains the usual furniture, but you're
 currently not in the mood to examine them in more detail. The only
 things that are important in your situation are the exits, which lead
 into the bedroom, the tailoring room, the bathroom and the kitchen.
 There is also the front door leading out into the street, of course.

 You unlock the front door.

 (opening the front door)
 In your dark suit, you shouldn't draw any attention. You wait for the
 right moment when there is nobody in sight on the street. Unseen, you
 slip out of the door onto the street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street (in front of the neighbors' house)</span>
 The street is running in an east-west direction. The only buildings
 are on the northern side. You are well acquainted with the neighbors
 living here. Left of their house, there is your own home. On the other
 side of the street, there is the park.

 The bus going to work is already waiting for you on the side of the
 street.

 Automatically and without thinking, you get on the bus and exchange
 the usual greetings with its well-known passengers. Finally, you
 arrive at the office. Since it's Friday, you're already looking
 forward to the coming weekend. If only there weren't this awful smell,
 reaching your nose from the brown bag which is supposed to contain
 your lunch...

 You decide to leave bus and job be and just take a day off. You settle
 down on one of the benches, close your eyes and savor the silence.
 Fresh air enters your nose and you inhale deeply. In a great mood, you
 return home in the evening. Dorothy awaits you on the doorstep. Of
 course, your boss called when you didn't show up at the office.
 Dorothy's mood lies somewhere between relief that nothing serious has
 happened, and then deep shock and total lack of comprehension when you
 tell her why you chose to spend the day like this. Maybe she didn't
 know you as well as she thought, after all.

 (first taking the sports coat)
 Hastily, you slip into the sports coat. It's slightly too large for
 you, but still better than nothing.
 All of a sudden, Dorothy is standing behind you. Expecting the worst,
 you spin around on the spot. What happens is the only thing you didn't
 expect: she smiles at you warmly. "I have watched you for some time
 now. Until today, I always assumed you only showed interest in my
 tailoring to make me happy. Given the number of things you tried on
 this morning, you must really like it." She is aglow with happiness
 now. You're still at a loss for words. She hands you another jacket:
 "Here, why don't you try this one? If it doesn't fit, I'll alter it
 with the sewing machine." Instinctively, you grab the jacket. "Or if
 you don't like it, I'll make something entirely different," she adds.
 Now, you're smiling as well - inwardly and outwardly.

 into other rooms. Assuming a similar layout compared to your own

 The mental and physical strain of the last days have simply been too
 much for you. You can't take it any longer. In spite of the strange
 surroundings and simply ignoring the stranger lying next to you, you
 give in to the lure of sleep. When you wake again - you can't estimate

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Street (in front of your house)</span>
 The street is running in an east-west direction. The only buildings

 well acquainted with the neighbors on the right side. On the other
 side of the street, there is a park.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (western entrance)</span>
 You're at the park's entrance. To the north, there is the street and
 the park itself continues in eastern and southern directions. You can
 really consider yourselves lucky to have this green oasis right in
 front of your door. Unfortunately, you hardly ever get the chance to
 savor it.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (eastern entrance)</span>
 To the east, the park ends in a fairly massive row of thorny bushes. A
 street borders it to the north. Paths leading west and south snake
 their ways deeper into the park.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (at the flowerbed)</span>
 This section of the park is the farthest from your house. Paths lead
 in northern and western directions. At the end of the park is a large
 flowerbed, in front of which an ice cream cart has been set up, much
 to the kids' delight.

>buy ice cream


 You step into the queue in front of the ice cream cart. Near the front
 of the line, a head is visible above all of the children. It belongs
 to a man wearing a dark rain coat.

>talk to harold


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine man


 You take a closer look at the man in the raincoat. Even though you
 only have an angled view of his back, you can't help but think that
 this must be your coworker Harold. He lives on the other side of town,
 and to your knowledge he has neither relatives nor friends around
 here. What business could he possibly have here?

>talk to harold


 As you try approaching him, Harold steps out of the queue and briskly
 walks away in a westerly direction. You follow him with your eyes.
 When you turn around again, the ice cream cart has disappeared! In its
 place, a sheet of paper lies on the ground.

>take paper


 As you pick up the sheet, you hear the children's unanimous
 disappointment. You feel the same thing: Your craving for sweets gets
 stronger and stronger!

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (at the large tree)</span>
 This part of the park is dominated by a particularly massive tree. In
 its shadow, there is a bench. Paths lead back in eastern and northern
 directions.

 You spot Harold climbing up the tree.

>go up


 Determined to unravel the mystery of Harold's behavior, you also pull
 yourself up the tree. Without thinking about it, you effortlessly move
 across fairly thin branches until you get close to Harold.

>talk to harold


 Harold has reached the highest possible point in the tree. He reaches
 towards the sky, where some clouds have gathered, as if he wants to
 grasp something.

 Finally, you get close enough to attract his attention. Though when
 this presumed Harold turns around on hearing your call, you realize
 that you were mistaken. It isn't Harold, but a little boy. His smooth
 facial features could resemble what Harold might have looked like when
 he was about eight, but his build is completely different, of course.

 While you remain frozen, dumbfounded, the boy, who seems to think you
 caught him doing something forbidden, jumps down to the ground and
 runs away.

>take branch


 You break off the small branch.

>examine cloud


 You look up. It seems as if one of the clouds is almost within reach
 of your arm.

>get cloud with stick


 You can't see any such thing.

 You are carrying:
   a stick
   a sheet
   a wallet (which is open)
     some keys (which opens the front door)
     some money
   a corduroy suit (being worn)
   some pajamas

>touch cloud with stick


 The small stick in hand, you reach towards the cloud and push it
 inside. You feel some tangible resistence. Quickly, you pull your hand
 back, holding some cotton candy.

>eat candy


 Joyously, you eat the cotton candy. The wooden stick in the middle was
 the most delicious part!

>go down



 You are suddenly hit with severe stomach cramps. You bend forward,
 hardly able to keep your balance. Even your mother had always told you
 not to stuff sweets into yourself so quickly!
 You get off the massive tree.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (at the large tree)</span>
 This part of the park is dominated by a particularly massive tree. In
 its shadow, there is a bench. Paths lead back in eastern and northern
 directions.

>dit


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>sit


 What do you want to sit on top of?

>sit on bench


 You put your body into the most comfortable position possible on the
 bench and close your eyes. The cramps disappear. When you open your
 eyes again, you see the sun has reached its highest point. Could the
 time really have passed this quickly?

 You press the button and hear the doorbell, followed by approaching
 steps. Dorothy opens the door with a broad smile. Since she has
 probably discussed it ten times with Margaret already, she knows the
 reason for your visit. Still, she plays along, and when you extend the
 invitation for tonight, she acts surprised. You exchange some more
 pleasantries and then say your goodbyes until tonight. Well, one duty
 performed.

 This is the house's central hub. All other rooms, i.e. the bedroom,
 the kitchen, the bathroom and the currently unused room, can be
 reached from here. Aside from that, the front door, located next to a
 large panorama window, leads right into this room. Because of the
 number of exits, there isn't actually all this much usable space
 available, but Margaret has come up with a clever arrangement of the
 sofa and the matching table as well as the slender floor lamp which
 really gets the maximum out of it! Margaret wants the house to look
 its best and so, even several hours before the guests should arrive,
 she is already bustling about.

>talk to margaret


 Before you can even say anything to Margaret, she takes the
 initiative: "Ah, honey, good that you're here. I still need a couple
 of things, can you quickly run off and buy them? You have got the list
 already, don't you?" With that, she turns her attention back away from
 you. What list?

 Without the complete grocery list, going all the way to the store
 would be pointless.

>examine paper


 To your surprise, the former ice cream stand sheet has turned into a
 very, very long grocery list. It is so long that you don't really know
 how to obtain all of this in such a short time.

>go east


 Nervous as you are, the shopping list slips out of your hand and falls
 to the ground.

>take list


 You pick up the shopping list again. Immediately, you notice that all
 the writing on it has disappeared. Of course, you haven't the faintest
 recollection of anything that was on the list - it would be completely
 useless to even go to the store now.

 Head drawn-in, you enter the house again. Margaret, already in her
 evening dress now and her hair straightened, stands in front of you
 and shoots you a look of reproach, even before you can confess that
 you could not get the errands done. She points at the clock: "Last
 minute again! Where did you fool about this time?" It is actually
 almost six o'clock. Before you can arrange your thoughts, the door
 bell is already ringing. Since you're not moving a muscle, Margaret
 steps right past you with a derogatory sound from her throat, opens
 the door and welcomes Robert and Dorothy. You recover, take their
 coats and you all sit down. As assigned in advance, you take a seat
 left of Margaret.

 photographs and a newspaper.

 There's a listening sort of silence.

 Margaret is much too busy talking to the neighbors. You have no choice
 but to listen.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Living Room</span> (on the couch)
 This is the house's central hub. All other rooms, i.e. the bedroom,
 the kitchen, the bathroom and the currently unused room, can be
 reached from here. Aside from that, the front door, located next to a
 large panorama window, leads right into this room. Because of the
 number of exits, there isn't actually all this much usable space
 available, but Margaret has come up with a clever arrangement of the
 sofa and the matching table as well as the slender floor lamp which
 really gets the maximum out of it!

 Margaret, Robert and Dorothy are sitting around your table. They are
 more or less absorbed in small talk.

 On the living room table are some photographs.

>examine lamp


 You would have preferred a ceiling lamp.
 The floor lamp is currently switched on.

>examine window


 (the window)
 It is a nice, big window which bathes the room in bright light right
 around noon. The window-sill is decorated with small figures.

>turn on light


 (the floor lamp)
 Margaret shoots you a sharp sideways look. It would be quite rude to
 just stand up right now.
 Margaret's voice attracts your attention back to the company at hand:
 "What do you think, honey?" Hectically, you turn your head to the
 right; an endless three seconds pass for you to realize that you are
 unexpectedly looking into <span class="floydstyle em">Dorothy's</span> face.

>examine dorothy


 You look around and find all eyes on you. A slight dizziness overcomes
 you and you fight it by focussing rightwards again. From there,
 Margaret looks at you with rising anxiety. Too much time has passed
 and you don't have the slightest clue what everybody was on about, so
 you just blurt out something incoherent. The neighbors exchange a
 telling, hardly disguised look. You fall silent again - this time, for
 the rest of the evening.

 A little later, Dorothy and Robert take their leave. You get up only
 mechanically to shake their hands, while Margaret fusses about and
 follows them to the door. You think you hear her whispering something
 to them. After the front door has closed again, your wife walks into
 the bedroom without saying another word.

 You get off the couch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room</span>

 You can see a newspaper here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the
 rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room
 when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye
 for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been
 insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the
 things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at
 least!

 Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room
 from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite
 to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front
 of it.

 On the bed is Margaret.

>enter bed


 You're not suitably dressed.

>sleep


 You're not suitably dressed.

>wear pajamas


 You take off the corduroy suit and slip the pajamas on.

>sleep


 Exhausted by today's exertions, sleep overcomes you almost
 immediately.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Press any key to continue</span>


 After waking from a dreamless night, you feel very refreshed.
 Yesterday's events now seem strangely unreal. As you open your eyes,
 the room is still pitch dark. Beside you, you hear the soothingly
 steady breathing of your wife. You feel towards the usual direction
 and recognize the light switch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

 Darkness, noun.  An absence of light to see by.

>turn on light


 The light illuminates the room, but what unfolds in front of you isn't
 what you expected. Something is wrong, but drowsy as you are, you
 can't quite pin it down yet. Slowly, it dawns on you: this isn't
 <span class="floydstyle em">your</span> bedroom!

 <span class="floydstyle i">Bedroom</span> (on the bed)
 The more you focus, even if you can't believe it, it becomes clearer
 to you that this isn't your bedroom. Margaret lies on the double bed,
 sleeping. Next to the bed, on the other side from her, there is the
 lamp you switched on. On the opposite wall, there's a wardrobe and a
 trouser press. Two doors, one to the south and one to the east, lead
 out of the room.

 On the trouser press is a sports coat.

 You can also see a wallet (in which are some keys (which opens the
 front door) and some money) here.

>examine wife


 You hear your wife's light breathing behind you, and turn over to be
 soothed by the sight of her features which are especially lovely in
 her sleep. You freeze - lying next to you, still in deep slumber, is
 <span class="floydstyle em">Dorothy</span>, your neighbor! You realize that this must be
 <span class="floydstyle em">her</span> bedroom. Not only are you two lying in bed together, but
 as you also only just notice, you are naked! How on earth did you get
 yourself into this embarrassing situation? You jump up; it's obvious
 that you should take off as quickly as possible and, even more
 importantly, unnoticed, before her husband returns!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 You're currently not in the mood to examine the room in more detail.
 The large double bed, on which Dorothy is lying, is immediately
 visible, of course. She is still asleep. Next to the bed, on your
 side, there is a lamp. On the opposite wall are a wardrobe and a
 trouser press. Two doors, one to the south and one to the east, lead
 into other rooms. Assuming a similar layout compared to your own
 house, one of these should lead to the living room.
 On the trouser press is a sports coat.

 You can also see a wallet (in which are some keys (which opens the
 front door) and some money) here.

>take wallet

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tailoring Room</span>
 So this is the legendary room which Dorothy uses for her hobby:
 tailoring. Appropriately, it's furnished with a chest of drawers and a
 dress form. One exit leads into the living room, the other door into
 the bedroom.

 On the dress form is a colorful costume.

>open drawer


 You can't see any such thing.

>open chest


 You open the chest of drawers, revealing a blanket.

 You throw the blanket over your shoulders and tie a knot in the front.

 The neighbors' living room contains the usual furniture, but you're
 currently not in the mood to examine them in more detail. The only
 things that are important in your situation are the exits, which lead
 into the bedroom, the tailoring room, the bathroom and the kitchen.
 There is also the front door leading out into the street, of course.

>bathroom



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bathroom</span>
 This bathroom is furnished in a similar fashion to yours, but with a
 bath instead of a shower. A large window occupies the space which
 would otherwise be taken up by the shower. The exit leads back into
 the living room.

>open window


 You open the window.

>go through window


 Using the protection of the hedge, you climb through the window. Using
 the critical moment, you cover your face with the blanket so that
 nobody can recognize you and run across the street into the park.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (eastern entrance)</span>
 To the east, the park ends in a fairly massive row of thorny bushes. A
 street borders it to the north. Paths leading west and south snake
 their ways deeper into the park.

 Although the bushes have obviously been pruned recently, the inner
 growth of their branches is wild and jumbled. Nevertheless, you spot a
 foreign object deep inside.

 You take a closer look - it is a crumpled blanket.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (at the flowerbed)</span>
 This section of the park is the farthest from your house. Paths lead
 in northern and western directions. At the end of the park is a large
 flowerbed.

 The varied species planted next to each other make for a
 cheerily-colorful overall picture. Unfortunately, you're not so well
 versed in the flora to be able to name them.

 You know very well that picking flowers is forbidden. The sign at the
 side of the flowerbed specifically says so.

 You hear the laughing of a group of playing children.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Park (at the large tree)</span>
 This part of the park is dominated by a particularly massive tree. In
 its shadow, there is a bench. Paths lead back in eastern and northern
 directions.

 You can see a flock of birds here.

 You're at the park's entrance. To the north, there is the street and

 really consider yourselves lucky to have this green oasis right in
 front of your door. Unfortunately, you hardly ever get the chance to
 savor it.

 As you carefully approach the bench, the birds keep perfectly still.
 You settle down between them. Some birds even hop on your legs. You
 let all the tension go from your body and decide to live with them.

 A couple of weeks later, one of your little trips lead you back to
 your former house. You and your friends land on the window sill.
 Through the window, you see a boy sitting on the living room carpet,
 playing with toy bricks, while Margaret and Robert harmoniously sit at
 the table drinking coffee. When she notices you, Margaret carefully
 opens the window, motions her son over and hands him a cookie from the
 table which he crumbles and throws towards you outside. In spite of
 this welcome gift, you have a powerful sense that soon the cold season
 will begin. Your flock moves towards warmer shores.
