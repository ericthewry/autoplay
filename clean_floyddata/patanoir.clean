    Walkthrough
 "PataNoir" is a surreal noir game, which differs from an ordinary noir
 story in ways that should become clear early on. Make sure you try to
 examine and interact with everything in your surroundings, including
 things that are not literally there. Especially those. Every time
 something is "like" something else, you can try to interact with both
 things. Once you have some things, try giving them to people or
 putting them on other things.

 If you get stuck, you can talk to your trusty servant. He might be
 able to provide some hints. If you can't find him, check the desk
 drawer.

 The chapter Instructions for Play contains basic information on how to
 play Interactive Fiction, for people new to the medium.

 If you are having trouble with the puzzle system, you can read the
 "Similes and You" chapter in this hint menu for more detailed
 instructions. You may find it more rewarding to figure things out
 yourself, though.

 If you are still stuck, the final chapter contains a detailed
 walkthrough, divided into sections corresponding to scenes in the
 game. Some scenes expect you to be carrying things from earlier
 scenes, so a walkthrough section may not always work out of context.
 For convenience, Typing "WALKTHRU" in the command prompt will print
 the entire walkthrough on the screen.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Your Office</span> (on the office chair)
 Shadows huddle in the corners, like dark pools of oil; the sickly
 yellow light from the desk lamp does little to dispel the darkness. A
 cigarette butt smolders in the ashtray, like the last embers from a
 dying camp fire. Your desk is covered with old case files - reminders
 of past glories. Apart from the desk, the only other furniture is an
 old office chair.

 The office door to the north leads to the corridor outside.

>examine oil

 Greasy black oil.

>examine me

 You are a bit worse for wear, but you are still the best detective in
 town.

>take oil

 You will need some kind of container to carry it.

>examine shadows

 Shadows gather in all corners of the office, like dark pools of oil.

>examine embers

 A few glowing pieces of coal are left at the camp site.

>examine lamp

 The old dirty desk lamp struggles valiantly to light up the office,
 like an elderly knight fighting to keep the forces of darkness at bay.

>examine knight

 The knight seems weary. His armor is old and dirty. How much longer
 can he keep fighting, you wonder?

>talk to knight

 The knight stands to attention. "Don't worry, sir. I have been doing
 this for years. I am not going to abandon you."

>take knight

 I don't suppose the holy knight would care for that.

>talk to knight

 What are you going to say? A bunch of platitudes about how everything
 is going to be okay? Better to stay silent for now.

>take embers

 You carefully pick up one of the embers from the camp fire.

 There is a knock at the door.

>open door

 It takes effort to push the chair away from the desk so you can get
 off. You really should fix the wheels some day.

 The door opens and a tall man in a tuxedo enters the room. He looks
 like a butler of some kind.

>talk to butler

 "How may I help you?", you ask.

 "My name is Allan Jameson." His voice is as hard as his face. "I
 represent the Baron Ahrend von BÃ¼low. You are Douglas Reilly, the
 private investigator?"

 You lean back into your chair, hoping to look relaxed and
 self-assured. "That's right. What does a Baron want with me?"

 "The Baron, for some reason beyond my understanding, has decided that
 a Private Investigator is the most discreet way of dealing with a
 current problem. He has allowed me the courtesy of selecting one."

 "And I take it that you have selected me?"

 He raises an eyebrow. "I haven't selected anyone, Mr. Reilly. Perhaps
 you could tell me why you would be the right man for the job?"

>examine man

 Tall, thin, and impeccably dressed in a tuxedo with a black bow tie.
 His face looks like it has been cut out of marble. No emotion is
 visible at all.

>examine face

 You do not normally need to refer to specific parts of the body.

>examine marble

 Exquisite white creole marble with black coloration. Its perfection is
 sublime.

>chisel marble

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>take marble

 Taken.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   some figurative white marble
   a figurative smoldering ember (providing light)

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   some figurative white marble

 Tall, thin, and impeccably dressed in a tuxedo with a black bow tie.
 His face is ordinary; he seems like a kind, if somewhat reserved,
 person.


 "I assure you that you will not regret hiring me. I will serve the
 interests of the Baron to the utmost of my abilities."

 A smile lights up his face. "I am very glad to hear that, Mr. Reilly.
 You sound just like the person we need. Unfortunately, I can't just
 take your word for it, you understand. I just need some kind of
 assurance."

>examine tuxedo

 Not a speck of dust is visible. It's either brand new or he just
 picked it up from the cleaners.

>examine bow tie

 Perfectly tied. You never could figure out those things yourself.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Office</span>
 Shadows huddle in the corners, like dark pools of oil; the sickly
 yellow light from the desk lamp does little to dispel the darkness. An
 old cigarette butt lies in the ashtray. Your desk is covered with old
 case files - reminders of past glories. Apart from the desk, the only
 other furniture is an old office chair.

 The office door to the north leads to the corridor outside.

 You see Allan Jameson here.

>examine butt

 An old cigarette that you couldn't bother to finish.

>take butt

 You don't feel like smoking right now.

>read files

 You haven't had much work lately, so you have been reviewing some old
 case files, remembering old times. You never know if you might learn
 something.

>examine chair

 The rust has long since caused the wheels on the chair to get stuck.
 It would be much more comfortable if you fixed them.

>examine wheels

 The wheels are covered with crimson rust, like coagulated blood.

>examine blood

 The blood has long since turned into a reddish brown substance, almost
 like rust.

>take blood

 Taken.

>give blood to butler

 Making Allan Jameson red like blood would not be helpful.

>show knight to butler

 (first taking the holy knight)
 I don't suppose the holy knight would care for that.

>talk to knight

 What are you going to say? A bunch of platitudes about how everything
 is going to be okay? Better to stay silent for now.


 For some reason, you seem to be only one capable of seeing these
 things.

>examine desk

 Countless cups of coffee have been spilled across what was once an
 impeccable wooden surface. It's not pretty, but it serves its purpose
 well enough. It is currently covered with old case files. The desk
 contains a single drawer.

>examine files

 You haven't had much work lately, so you have been reviewing some old
 case files, remembering old times. You never know if you might learn
 something.

>open drawer

 You open the desk drawer, revealing a revolver.

>examine revolver

 A .38 revolver. It has served you well for many years, like a trusty
 servant never leaving your side.

>examine servant

 Mr. Smith Wesson, your trusty servant, is at your side as always. He
 is dressed in a grey suit and a tie.

>take gun

 Taken.

>talk to servant

 "Good evening, sir," says Mr. Wesson. "If you need me to do anything,
 just say something like 'Wesson, take the ball' or 'Wesson, attack the
 man'. I will do my very best to fulfill your wishes. If you can't
 figure out what to do, you can always talk to me. I might be able to
 give you some hints."

>wesson, give assurance

 You can't think of anything to say on that topic.

>wesson, talk to butler

 Mr. Wesson has better things to do.


 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the
 moment.

>take gun

 You already have that.

>examine gun

 A .38 revolver. It has served you well for many years, like a trusty
 servant never leaving your side.

>show gun to butler

 Allan Jameson is unimpressed.

>talk to butler

 "Mr. Jameson, how can I convince you that I am the right man for the
 job?"

 He thinks for a few seconds. "I am not certain. You seem like a pretty
 decent person, but perhaps I should investigate some other options
 before I decide."

>take file

 You are tired of living in the past.

>show files to butler

 (first taking the case files)
 You are tired of living in the past.

>live in the present, man

 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.


 You are carrying:
   a revolver
   some figurative coagulated blood
   some figurative white marble
   a figurative smoldering ember (providing light)

>put blood on marble

 Making the white marble red like blood would not be helpful.

>put marble on knight

 Making the holy knight as smooth and hard as marble would not be
 helpful.

>put ember on oil

 Making the oil warmer would not be helpful.

>examine cup

 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the
 moment.

>put marble on oil

 Making the oil as smooth and hard as marble would not be helpful.


 His eyes light up with a friendly glow.

>talk to butler

 "Mr. Jameson, I think this might be the beginning of a beautiful
 business relationship."

 He laughs heartily. "Please, call me Allan. It's really been a
 pleasure talking to you, Douglas. I am so glad I decided to visit you,
 instead of going with one of the other people. They were all so glum
 and cynical."

 "The pleasure is entirely mine," you say with a smile. "Now, shall we
 go see the Baron?"

 "Of course. Follow me."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Mansion</span>
 The stately mansion of the Baron von BÃ¼low looms in front of you,
 like
 a sleeping giant. Light seeps out from a single window on the second
 floor to the right; all the others are dark. Two large mahogany doors
 guard the entrance to the north. The path to the south leads to the
 gate, away from the mansion.

 "Here we are, sir," says Jameson. "If you will just follow me."

 He opens the doors and disappears into the mansion.


 Two massive dark mahogany doors.

>examine giant

 The giant seems to have been asleep for some time. His face is serene;
 his breath, calm and rhythmic.

>wake giant

 You poke the giant, but there is no reaction. Figures; your tiny
 fingers would hardly be noticeable on his massive hide.


 Where would you like to go?


>put marble on fingers

 You do not normally need to refer to specific parts of the body.

 (retrying as if you'd typed "put marble .")
 What do you want to put the white marble around?

>put marble on me

 Making yourself as smooth and hard as marble would not be helpful.

>poke giant with marble

 You can't use the white marble as a weapon.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Mansion</span>

>put blood on giant

 Making the giant red like blood would not be helpful.

>knock on doors

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go north

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Hall</span>
 It almost seems like a waste for such a massive entrance hall to be
 used to welcome a single person. The floor is a frozen lake of grey
 marble. Two sets of stairs lead up to a balcony above. French doors in
 the north side of the room lead to the back garden. To the south, the
 mahogany doors lead back out.

 You see Allan Jameson here.

 Mr. Jameson ascends the stairs.

>examine lake

 The lake seems to have been frozen forever. You can feel the cold
 through your shoes.

>ice fish

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>go up

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Balcony</span>
 From here you can see the hall beneath you. An iron railing prevents
 you from falling to the floor far below. Massive oak wood doors block
 the paths to the east and the west.

 You see Allan Jameson here.

 Mr. Jameson opens the east door and enters.

>go east

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Library</span>
 Bookshelves line every wall, allowing only a small space for the door
 to the west and another one for the small window in the north wall.
 The floor is covered in a thick luxurious red carpet. The air smells
 of dust.

 You see Allan Jameson here.

 The Baron sits in a black leather easy chair on the east side of the
 room. He has been reading a book, but when you enter he puts it away
 on a small table next to the chair. A hint of something that might one
 day grow into a smile is briefly visible on his face.

 "Ah, Mr. Jameson. You have brought the detective. Excellent; you may
 leave us."

 Mr. Jameson leaves through the door, closing it behind him.

>talk to baron

 Maybe you should check him out first?


 Thin, as though his skin had been draped over his skeleton with
 nothing in between. Dark blue eyes, like deep lakes carved into his
 face. What little is left of his hair is entirely grey, like strands
 of steel embedded into his scalp.

>examine steel

 The strand seems to have been cut from a roll of steel wire. It is
 long, thin, and sharp. It might be useful as a weapon.

>take steel

 Taken.

>examine lakes

 The lakes are deep and dark. What secrets hide beneath the surface of
 the water, you wonder? Perhaps you should take a swim and find out?


 You dive. The surface of the lake approaches quickly, until it fills
 your entire field of vision. Then the cool water surrounds you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Near the Surface</span>
 It is dark under the water and you can't see much more than a few
 yards in any direction. Above you, the sun shines through the surface.
 Below, the darkness gets thicker.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Deeper</span>
 It is darker down here; you can't see much more than a few feet in any
 direction. A few fish pass by, just outside your field of vision. From
 above, the distant sun shines faintly.


 A variety of multicolored fish. You can't identify the species.


 You reach for them, but they quickly slip away.

>go down

 The darkness engulfs you. The sun is no longer visible. You are
 floating in an infinite void. Lost.

 .

 .

 .

 The sharp smell of smelling salts pull you back to the library. Mr.
 Jameson is standing above you. The Baron is leaning forward in his
 chair.

 "How are you feeling, Douglas?" asks Allan. "I would hate to lose a
 new friend so soon."

 You brush him off. "I am fine, thank you. I just haven't had much
 sleep lately."

 He shrugs. "As you wish."

 He leaves the room, leaving you alone with the Baron once more.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Library</span>
 Bookshelves line every wall, allowing only a small space for the door
 to the west and another one for the small window in the north wall.
 The floor is covered in a thick luxurious red carpet. The air smells
 of dust.

 The Baron sits in a black leather easy chair on the east side of the
 room.

>dive in

 What do you want to dive in?


 You dive. The surface of the lake approaches quickly, until it fills

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Near the Surface</span>

 You emerge from the lake, gasping for air.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Library</span>
 Bookshelves line every wall, allowing only a small space for the door

 The floor is covered in a thick luxurious red carpet. The air smells

 The Baron sits in a black leather easy chair on the east side of the
 room.

>examine carpet

 A soft red carpet.

>talk to baron

 The Baron takes a deep breath. His voice, when it emerges, is like a
 scratched vinyl record.

 "I am glad you could come on such short notice, Mr...."

 "Reilly. Douglas Reilly."

 "Mr. Reilly. I don't normally deal with your kind, but I have a
 precarious problem that will need to be handled with the utmost
 discretion..." His voice trails off.


 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the
 moment.

>talk to baron

 "It might help, Mr. von BÃ¼low, if I knew what the problem was."

 He blinks. The lakes are briefly covered with clouds, then reappear.

 His hoarse voice continues. "Of course. You must excuse an old man. It
 concerns my daughter, you see. She has always been a free spirit, but
 now she has run off with that damnable boyfriend of hers. Obviously,
 the police can't get involved, but I need her found. If you can also
 convince her to leave the man, that would be perfect, but the primary
 goal is to locate her and make sure she is unharmed. Do you think you
 can handle that?"

>talk to baron

 "Can you tell me some more about your daughter and her boyfriend?"

 "Of course. My daughter's name is Lisa von BÃ¼low" - he shows you a
 photograph - "she is 22 years old, much too old for this rebellious
 nonsense in my opinion."

 "And the boyfriend?"

 He sneers. "I am afraid I don't have a picture. I only met the man
 once, but he is a drunkard Scotsman with a scraggly full beard. His
 name is Erik McAllister. You can't miss him. I have no idea what my
 daughter sees in him."

>talk to baron

 "How do you know they have run off together?"

 "Well, I don't know that for certain; I am simply assuming since they
 both disappeared at the same time. It's possible that they are both
 dead in a ditch somewhere, but I prefer to believe that my daughter is
 alive. You must humour an old man."

 You shrug. "Of course. Do you have any idea where they might have
 gone?"

 He laughs. His laughter erupts in hard bursts, like a record getting
 stuck. "I have some ideas - I know where they used to spend time
 together, anyway - but I expect you to be able to figure these things
 out by yourself. You are a detective, right?"

>take record

 Taken.

>examine record

 It is full of scratches. It probably won't be very pleasant to listen
 to.

>talk to baron

 "Mr. von BÃ¼low, I may be a detective, but I still need something to
 work with. If you won't give me any information, I am not sure how
 much I can do."

 The lakes are still for a moment, and you detect a glimmer of
 something hidden in their depths. "Then perhaps I should hire someone
 else, Mr. Reilly."


 You dive. The surface of the lake approaches quickly, until it fills
 your entire field of vision. Then the cool water surrounds you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Near the Surface</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Mansion</span>
 The stately mansion of the Baron von BÃ¼low looms in front of you,
 like
 a sleeping giant. Light seeps out from a single window on the second
 floor to the right; all the others are dark. Two large mahogany doors
 guard the entrance to the north. The path to the south leads to the
 gate, away from the mansion.

>poke giant with steel

 The red hot steel strand sizzles as it penetrates the skin. The giant
 roars, and scrambles to its feet, its eyes ablaze with rage. It looks
 around for its attacker, but luckily it seems to be looking for
 someone of the same size. It doesn't notice you huddling at its feet.

>take giant

 I don't suppose the giant would care for that.

>examine giant

 The giant is wide awake now. His eyes scan the horizon for potential
 attackers.

>talk to giant

 He seems angry. You should probably avoid attracting attention to
 yourself.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Hall</span>
 It almost seems like a waste for such a massive entrance hall to be
 used to welcome a single person. The floor is a conflagration of red
 marble. Two sets of stairs lead up to a balcony above. French doors in
 the north side of the room lead to the back garden. To the south, the
 mahogany doors lead back out.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Garden</span>
 The grass here has been meticulously groomed. Not a single strand
 stands above the others, like citizens in a socialist utopia. Stone
 paths wind through the grass like scaly snakes, going nowhere and
 everywhere. From a fountain in the middle of the garden, from a
 trumpet held by an angel, water shoots into the air. The mansion lies
 behind you, to the south.

 The air is cold and clear, like the justice we all seek, but never
 find.

 From here you can see the hall beneath you. An iron railing prevents

>swim in lake

 You dive. The surface of the lake approaches quickly, until it fills
 your entire field of vision. Then the cool water surrounds you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Near the Surface</span>
 It is dark under the water and you can't see much more than a few

 His face lights up with a golden glow. He seems much more friendly.

>talk to baron

 "Mr. von BÃ¼low, I am really not going to get anywhere without more
 information. Do you want your daughter found or not?"

 He smiles. "Of course. I really must apologize for playing these
 little games with you." He pauses to collect his thoughts. "Let me
 see, there are several places they might be. Mr. McAllister lives in
 an apartment on 23 Roosevelt Street. I really doubt they are hiding
 out in such an obvious location, but there might be some clues there
 at least. The man is also a degenerate gambler and alcoholic. He
 gambles all the time at a joint called the Butterfly Club - sometimes
 he even drags my daughter down there with him, the bastard. When he
 isn't gambling he is drinking heavily down at a local bar called the
 Water Buffalo. That's about all I know. Will that be of any help, Mr.
 Reilly?"

 You nod. You know both of the places he mentioned. "Absolutely. I have
 enough to get started, anyway. I will let you know how the case
 proceeds."

 You head towards the gambling joint.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Butterfly Club</span>
 All sorts of gambling tables dot the floor. There are roulette,
 blackjack, poker and more games you have never even heard of. No one
 looks at you. Every ounce of their attention is directed toward the
 random events that decide their lives. A giant crystal chandelier
 hangs from the ceiling, like an intricate icicle formation. To the
 west, massive double doors lead outside. At the eastern wall is a
 small discreet door; the kind of door you are not supposed to notice,
 much less enter.

 Icicles grow from the ceiling in an intricate formation. Why haven't

 It is too far up. If you had someone to help you, you might be able to

>examine gamblers

 People from all strata of society are gathered here as equals, united
 through their common addiction. It almost warms your heart.

>examine games

 Countless gambling tables cover almost every square foot of the room.
 Every imaginable game of chance is represented here. A lot of people
 seem to be watching the poker game in the corner of the hall.


 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine poker

 Four people are playing a high stakes game of poker in the corner of
 the hall. A small crowd has gathered around the table, attracted by
 the sight of large amounts of money changing hands. One of the players
 draw your attention: a pale man wearing a tuxedo who seems to be
 losing big.

>examine pale man

 One of the nouveau riche for sure. He looks like someone who has never
 tried wearing a tuxedo before. His face is like putty; every emotion
 leaves a visible mark. Not a good thing for a poker player. He seems
 to be losing a lot of money.

>examine putty

 The putty is soft and pliable.

>take putty

 Taken.


 His face is like carved out of marble. No emotion is visible.

>examine pale man

 One of the nouveau riche for sure. He looks like someone who has never
 tried wearing a tuxedo before. His face is expressionless, as if it
 had been carved out of marble. A good thing for a poker player. He
 seems to be winning a lot of money.

 The poker game continues. The other players try to read the emotions
 of the tuxedo man, but his face is impenetrable. They all fold.

>talk to man

 The other onlookers hush you. Clearly, disturbing the game isn't an
 option.

 "You are not fooling me this time," says one of the poker players and
 reveals his hand: Three aces. One by one, the tuxedo man puts his
 cards on the table: 6-7-8-9-10. A straight. The audience claps.

 winning big.

 The tuxedo man wins again. And again. The mountain of chips in front
 of him grows to unprecedented heights. Finally, a crack appears in his
 face and he smiles. "Enough with this. This is my lucky night!"

 He picks up the huge pile of chips, walks to the roulette table and
 drops the pile down next to the spinning wheel. "I am putting it all
 on red!" The marble cracks and falls apart as a huge smile appears on
 his face. You have a feeling you might be able to find it again with
 its original owner.


 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the
 moment.

>put blood on man

 Making the tuxedo man red like blood would not be helpful.

 "I am sorry sir," says the croupier. "The table can't match your bet.
 I am going to have to get the manager." He goes through the small
 discreet door and emerges a few minutes later, followed by a tall thin
 man dressed in a beige suit.


 Making the roulette table red like blood would not be helpful.

 The tuxedo man looks at the newcomer and smiles even more broadly.
 "What will it be Camino? Are you afraid I am going to bankrupt you
 tonight?"

 The man in the beige suit - whose name seems to be Camino - pays no
 attention the tuxedo man. He looks straight at the croupier. "It's
 alright. Let him play." His voice is soft and smooth.

 The wheel spins. The entire club seems to be holding its breath. The
 wheel slows down; the ball jumps a few times, and finally comes to
 rest ---- on red.

 The club erupts in applause. Everyone looks at the tuxedo man as if he
 had just single-handedly defeated Hitler in one-on-one combat. The
 tuxedo man picks up his winnings and leaves the club followed by an
 entourage of admirers. Camino does nothing, except look pensively at
 the wheel.

>examine wheel

 A perennial favorite of the gambling crowd, the roulette is simple and
 exciting. More people are playing now, after the tuxedo man's big win.
 A big winner is good advertisement.

>examine camino

 A tall thin man impeccably dressed in a beige suit and a trilby hat.
 Everything about him is beige; even his pale skin is almost
 indistinguishable from the color of his clothes. A scar crosses his
 left cheek, like a canyon in the middle of an otherwise pristine
 African savanna.


 Making the roulette table red like blood would not be helpful.

>examine canyon

 The canyon is deep. It must have been carved in the landscape many
 aeons ago. At the bottom, you can just barely make out a river.

>take canyon

 something of interest down there?

>talk to Camino

 "A bad day for you, I suppose?"

 He emerges from his reverie. "Not really. A big winner makes everyone
 else believe they can do the same. The extra business should make up
 for the loss."

 His eyes scan you inquisitively. "I haven't seen you around here
 before. What can I do for you?"

>talk to Camino

 "My name is Douglas Reilly. I am a private detective. I was wondering
 if we could have a word?"

 "I don't do business with private dicks. Unless you have you some
 useful information for me, I am not interested."

>talk to Camino

 "I am looking for Lisa von BÃ¼low. I understand she used to come here
 along with a bloke named McAllister?"

 He has the perfect poker face. "I never talk about my clientele. It's
 bad for business."

 interest in talking to you."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Butterfly Club</span>
 All sorts of gambling tables dot the floor. There are roulette,
 blackjack, poker and more games you have never even heard of. No one
 looks at you. Every ounce of their attention is directed toward the
 random events that decide their lives. A giant crystal chandelier
 hangs from the ceiling, like an intricate icicle formation. To the
 west, massive double doors lead outside. At the eastern wall is a
 small discreet door; the kind of door you are not supposed to notice,
 much less enter.

>go west

 Where would you like to go?

 You head towards the seedy bar.

 The bouncer pats you down in front of the entrance.
 The bouncer locates the revolver and confiscates it. "Sorry, Mister.
 No guns in the bar." Mr. Wesson manages to sneak in with you anyway.
 The bouncer easily locates the large conspicuous bowie knife. "Well,
 wadda we got here? Sorry, Mister. Can't have ya stabbin' the other
 patrons."
 "Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave, Mister."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Bar</span>
 The thick cigarette smoke makes it almost possible to see more than a
 few feet ahead. It's like being trapped in a thick London fog. Various
 people are sitting at the tables or standing by the bar. Behind the
 bar, the bartender is cleaning a whiskey glass with an old rag. The
 door to the south leads outside.

>examine fog

 The fog is so thick that it seems like you could cut it with a knife.

>take fog

 It slips between your fingers.

>enter fog

 You are already surrounded by fog.

>talk to bartender

 "What do you want, buddy?" says the bartender.

 "Actually I need some information. I am looking for Erik McAllister. I
 understand that he used to come here a lot?"

 The bartender sneers. "No idea who you are talking about, buddy. Order
 something or get out."

>order drink

 You buy a cheap beer and drink it while your consider your options.

>talk to bartender

 You don't seem to be getting anywhere with him. Maybe if you could
 show him something to get his attention?

>show paper to bartender

 The bartender reads the letter and laughs out loud. "HAHAHAHA. I knew
 a loser like McAllister couldn't keep a girl like that. I told him she
 was way out of his league, but he wouldn't listen."

 "So you do know him?"

 "Yeah, I guess you got me there, buddy. Look, I don't want any
 trouble. McAllister hasn't been around for the last couple weeks. You
 should talk to his friend; that brown haired guy over there with the
 scar. Leave me out of it."

 He points at a place in the thick fog. If you only you could see
 anything, that might actually be helpful.

>examine bouncer

 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the
 moment.

>go south

 Where would you like to go?

 "Here you are, Mister," says the bouncer, and returns your weapons.

 You head back to your office.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Office</span>
 Shadows huddle in the corners, like dark pools of oil; the sickly
 yellow light from the desk lamp does little to dispel the darkness. An
 old cigarette butt lies in the ashtray. Your desk is covered with old
 case files - reminders of past glories. Apart from the desk, the only
 other furniture is an old office chair.

 The office door to the north leads to the corridor outside.

>examine knight

 The knight seems weary. His armor is old and dirty. How much longer
 can he keep fighting, you wonder?

>clean knight with rag

 That has no visible effect.

>examine rag

 An old dirty rag. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in ages.

>rub knight with rag

 That has no visible effect.

>examine oil

 Greasy black oil.

>put oil in cocoon

 (first taking the oil)

 The white cocoon is already full.

>examine lamp

 The old dirty desk lamp struggles valiantly to light up the office,
 like an elderly knight fighting to keep the forces of darkness at bay.

>take fluid out of cocoon

 I only understood the first part of that-- trying anyway.

 (retrying as if you'd typed "take fluid.")
 You carefully try to remove the luminescent fluid from the white
 cocoon, but it runs through your fingers and disappears. You have a
 feeling there is more where that came from.

>put light on knight

 (first taking the desk lamp)

 Why would you want to carry around a desk lamp?
 You need to be holding the desk lamp before you can put it on top of
 something else.

>put oil in cocoon

 (first taking the oil)

 Taken.

>put oil on knight

 That would not be a very good simile.

>put oil on chair

 That would not be a very good simile.

>examine chair

 The rust has long since caused the wheels on the chair to get stuck.
 It would be much more comfortable if you fixed them.

>put oil on wheels

 The wheels look like they have been oiled recently.

>fix chair

 A good idea, but you will have to be more specific. How, exactly, are
 you going to accomplish it?

>fix chair with oil

 I only understood you as far as wanting to fix the office chair.

>oil wheels

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>push chair

 You push the chair to the side, revealing a coin that has apparently
 been stuck under one of the wheels.

>take coin

 Taken.

>examine coin

 A shiny penny, which has been apparently been stuck under your chair
 for quite some time. One side of it has been crushed, making it as
 sharp as the blade of a knife.

>take knife

 You already have that.

>take blade

 Taken.

 Oh, how sharp it is. It seems like it could slice a hair into two.

 You decide to check out McAllister's apartment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Entrance</span>
 The entrance to the apartment is a dark narrow hallway. The door

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Living Room</span>
 What a mess! A large couch stands against the southern wall, with a

 dilapidated middle eastern city. To the north is a kitchen counter
 with two stove plates built into it. Above it is a kitchen cabinet. To
 the west is the door to the entrance hall.

 A brown-haired man with a scar is sitting at one of the tables by
 himself.

>talk to man

 (the brown-haired man with the scar)
 You approach the man with the scar. "Excuse me. I am looking for a man
 named Erik McAllister. I was told you might know something."

 He looks at you like one would look at a cockroach that has just
 slithered out from beneath the kitchen table. "I don't know nothin'.
 And even if I did, I ain't no snitch."

 "I am looking for him for his own sake. I must insist that you tell me
 what you know."

 He laughs. "Insist? You ain't in no position to insist on anything,
 Mister." He pulls open his coat, revealing a small knife hidden in the
 inner pocket. "Me and me friend here says you should probably get out
 of here. Unless you got something to back up your words?"

 "Here you are, Mister," says the bouncer, and returns your weapons.

 You decide to visit the Baron again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Mansion</span>
 The stately mansion of the Baron von BÃ¼low looms in front of you.
 Light blares from two windows on the second floor, like the eyes of an
 angry giant. Two large mahogany doors guard the entrance to the north.
 The path to the south leads to the gate, away from the mansion.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Hall</span>
 It almost seems like a waste for such a massive entrance hall to be
 used to welcome a single person. The floor is a conflagration of red
 marble. Two sets of stairs lead up to a balcony above. French doors in
 the north side of the room lead to the back garden. To the south, the
 mahogany doors lead back out.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Balcony</span>
 From here you can see the hall beneath you. An iron railing prevents
 you from falling to the floor far below. Massive oak wood doors block
 the paths to the east and the west.

 room.

 He reads the letter, and his face grows red. "I swear if that damn
 Scotsman has done anything to hurt my daughter, I will make him pay."
 His face grows pale once more. "Please find her as soon as possible,
 Mr. Reilly. Make sure that she is okay."

 "Here you are, Mister," says the bouncer, and returns your weapons.

 You head towards the gambling joint.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Butterfly Club</span>
 All sorts of gambling tables dot the floor. There are roulette,
 blackjack, poker and more games you have never even heard of. No one
 looks at you. Every ounce of their attention is directed toward the
 random events that decide their lives. A giant crystal chandelier
 hangs from the ceiling, like an intricate icicle formation. To the
 west, massive double doors lead outside. At the eastern wall is a
 small discreet door; the kind of door you are not supposed to notice,
 much less enter.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Camino's Office</span>
 Neat. Everything here is neat. The papers on the desk are neatly
 stacked. There is not a speck of dust on the mahogany desk. It makes
 you uncomfortable. You never trust people who always need to be in
 control. That desire hardly ever stops with themselves.

 Camino is sitting behind the desk, waiting for your next move.

>talk to camino

 "Mr. Camino, it has come to my attention that you had a beef with Mr.
 McAllister."

 His eyes flash. "Who told you that?"

 "I never reveal my sources. How about you tell me what you know? I can
 get on with my case, and we never have to see each other again."

>talk to camino

 "You have done a fine job digging up some pointless dirt, Mr. Reilly."
 His soft smooth voice surrounds you like a velvet blanket. "But I am
 afraid I see no hard evidence of any wrongdoing. If you discover any
 new information, do not hesitate to contact me."

 The blanket closes around you, and you find yourself standing outside
 the door to the office. You don't quite remember what he said to make
 you leave, but he was very convincing.

>put record on camino

 He clears his throat. The sound is like a record getting stuck.

>talk to camino

 "Just what do you think you are doing here, Mr. Reilly?" His voice is
 coarse and insecure, like a broken record. "Did you think this
 pointless slander would scare me?"

 "Mr. Camino, I have no interest in scaring you. I am simply trying to
 locate Miss von BÃ¼low. If you could help me out, I assure you that I
 won't bother you again."

 His voice is almost a growl. "Oh, you won't bother me again. I am not
 worried about that at all. ALFONO!"

 The door opens and the man in the pinstriped suit enters the room.
 Without a word, he grabs your arm and escorts you out of the office.

 You feel like you are missing something. Perhaps you should explore
 more and make sure you have found everything?

 Mr. Wesson nods. "I think I might just be able to reach it if you help

 manage to lift his weight. He reaches towards the icicle. You struggle
 to keep your balance, and for one precarious moment it seems like you
 are going to end up in a pile on the floor. Then Mr. Wesson deftly
 breaks off an icicle and jumps down. He hands you the icicle. "Here

 You decide to visit the Baron again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Mansion</span>
 The stately mansion of the Baron von BÃ¼low looms in front of you.
 Light blares from two windows on the second floor, like the eyes of an
 angry giant. Two large mahogany doors guard the entrance to the north.
 The path to the south leads to the gate, away from the mansion.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Hall</span>
 It almost seems like a waste for such a massive entrance hall to be
 used to welcome a single person. The floor is a conflagration of red
 marble. Two sets of stairs lead up to a balcony above. French doors in
 the north side of the room lead to the back garden. To the south, the
 mahogany doors lead back out.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Garden</span>
 The grass here has been meticulously groomed. Not a single strand
 stands above the others, like citizens in a socialist utopia. Stone
 paths wind through the grass; the stones are like scales left behind
 by a giant snake. From a fountain in the middle of the garden, from a
 trumpet held by an angel, water shoots into the air. The mansion lies
 behind you, to the south.

 the paths to the east and the west.

 You see Allan Jameson here.

>go west

 (first opening the west door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Bedroom</span>
 A large luxurious bed completely dominates the room. Next to the bed
 is a small dresser. On the dresser is a lamp. Apart from these things,
 the room is entirely empty. The window to the south provides a view of
 the front garden.

 You head back to your office.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Office</span>
 Shadows huddle in the corners; the sickly yellow light from the desk
 lamp does little to dispel the darkness. An old cigarette butt lies in
 the ashtray. Your desk is covered with old case files - reminders of
 past glories. Apart from the desk, the only other furniture is an old
 office chair.

 The office door to the north leads to the corridor outside.

 "Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave, Mister."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Bar</span>
 Cigarette smoke winds through every part of the bar. Various people
 are sitting at the tables or standing by the bar. Behind the bar, the

>examine fluid

 A kind of luminescent fluid.

>examine cocoon

 A delicate white cocoon. It seems like it should be able to contain
 small items.

 In the white cocoon is some luminescent fluid.

>put brick on toupee

 That would not be a very good simile.

 Making the brown brick feel old would not be helpful.

>talk to wesson

 "He is too efficient, sir. Maybe you can scare away the businessman
 that makes him so? Try attacking the businessman."

>throw coin at businessman

 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

>hit businessman

 You were never much of a pugilist. If you want to use a weapon, use
 the ATTACK SOMETHING WITH SOMETHING syntax instead.

>hit businessman with knife

 (the literal knife)
 The literal knife is real. The businessman is not.

>take sharp knife

 Taken.

>hit businessman with sharp knife

 The businessman deftly avoids your attacks. "There is no need to get
 aggressive, sir. It's just business." If only you were a better
 fighter, you might be able to take him down. Maybe Mr. Wesson would
 have better luck?

>wesson, hit businessman with sharp knife

 (Mr. Wesson first taking the sharp knife)
 "If you want me to have the sharp knife, you should give it to me,
 sir."

>give sharp knife to wesson

 "Thank you, sir. Let me know if you want me to attack someone."

>wesson, attack businessman

 You both advance on the businessman. Mr. Wesson is brandishing the
 knife. You follow not far behind him. The businessman looks from one
 of you to the other, and his professional demeanor evaporates. "Look,
 I don't want any trouble. This really isn't any of my business." With
 that, he disappears into the shadows.

>wesson, attack snake

 Which do you mean, the black snake or the snake scale?

>black

 "I don't think that would accomplish anything, sir."

>wesson, take black snake

 Mr. Wesson has better things to do.

>wesson, give knife to me

 (the sharp knife to yourself)
 "Of course, sir. Here you are."

>put it on coin

 The coin is sharp as a knife.

>examine carlo

 He is wearing a pinstriped suit. Within the suit is an ordinary
 looking Italian-American man with a moustache resting above his lips
 like a small black snake. He is pointing a gun at you. His face is
 expressionless.

>hit snake with icicle

 (the black snake with the icicle)
 You can't use the icicle as a weapon.

>take snake

 (the black snake)
 "Hissss," You quickly withdraw your hand.

>give icicle to snake

 That would not be a very good simile.

>give brick to snake

 (the black snake)
 That would not be a very good simile.

>put snake in cocoon

 (the black snake in the white cocoon)
 The white cocoon is just a simile. It can't contain literal objects.

>kill snake with knife

 (the black snake with the literal knife)
 The knife is real. The snake is not.

>take blade

 Taken.

>kill snake with blade

 (the black snake with the sharp knife)
 The snake nimbly avoids your attacks.

>put blade on coin

 The coin is sharp as a knife.

>show coin to black snake

 The black snake is unimpressed.

>hiss

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>talk to black snake

 You can't think of anything to say.

>examine icicle

 A cool beautiful icicle.

   a letter
   a figurative white cocoon
     some figurative luminescent fluid (providing light)

>give marble to snake

 (the black snake)
 Making the black snake as smooth and hard as marble would not be
 helpful.

>examine letter

 The writing is almost illegible, but you manage to decipher it.

 "Lisa

 I know you have something going on with that bawbag Camino. Don't try
 to deny it I have seen how you flirt and god knows what else you are
 doing. You are not gonna do that no more or im gonna have to take
 matters into ma own hands.

 Erik."

>put toupee on letter

 Making the letter feel old would not be helpful.

>put toupee on carlo

 Making Carlo Alfono feel old would not be helpful.

>talk to wesson

 "It is still futile to attack him while he is holding us at gunpoint,
 sir. You will have to distract him somehow."

>throw coin at carlo

 You expertly flick the coin at Alfono. It glides through the air, like
 a tiny flying disc, and the sharp edge embeds itself in his neck. He
 cries out in pain, and instinctively reaches for the wound. His gun
 points towards the clear night sky. His moustache gleams in the
 moonlight.

>take disc

 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the
 moment.

>shoot carlo

 It's tempting, but dead men tell no tales. You want to take him alive.

>shoot moustache

 You don't like using your gun.

>cut moustache with knife

 (the literal knife)
 That seems like a bad idea.

>throw knife at carlo

 (the literal knife at Carlo Alfono)
 Nice try, but he executes you as soon as you pull the knife. Perhaps
 you should try a more discreet object?

 [Previous turn undone.]

>take moustache

 While he is distracted, you grab his moustache and pull as hard as you
 can. He roars in pain and the gun drops to the ground. It doesn't take
 long before your roles are reversed.

 "Who sent you?" you ask. He merely stares at you, without a word.
 "Tell me what I want to know, and I might let you live." You can tell
 he knows you are bluffing. You are no murderer.

 It's a moot point anyway. You can hear the police sirens approaching
 in the distance. Someone from the mansion must have noticed the
 commotion. The police will have to deal with him.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Copernik's Office</span> (on your chair)
 This small cramped office is just large enough to fit in a desk and
 two chairs. The walls are yellow from cigarette smoke.  On the desk is
 an ashtray that looks like it was made by a kindergartener as a gift.
 It is filled with old cigarette butts, like tiny mummified bodies. To
 the west, a door leads to the rest of the police station.

 Detective Copernik is sitting on the chair behind the desk.

>examine copernik

 A huge man, almost as broad as he is tall. His eyes are piercing; his
 hair, jet black.

>talk to him

 You have been talking for what seems like hours already. What more
 does he want to know?

 "I have already told you what happened, Detective. Why don't you just
 let me go now and we can both get some sleep?"

 Detective Copernik lights yet another cigarette and blows a ring of
 smoke at your face. It dissipates before it reaches you, merging with
 the grey substance that passes for air in here. "I just want to make
 sure I have all the facts straight here. Private dicks always
 complicate matters. We tell people they should just let us do our
 jobs, but they never listen. So, you visit this Camino fella about
 Miss BÃ¼low. You get him angry, and shortly afterwards his goon tries
 to kill you?"

 "That's correct. Has Mr. Alfono said anything?"

 He leans back in his chair. "We are actively pursuing all leads. Now,
 I am wondering why Mr. Camino would want to have you killed merely for
 asking a few questions. Would it surprise you to hear that we are also
 looking for Miss BÃ¼low? The Baron filed a missing persons report."

 That does surprise you. "That doesn't surprise me."

 "I should have known he would hire a private dick as well. These old
 rich guys never trust the authorities. Now that you are involved, we
 might as well make the best of it. Why don't you tell me everything
 you know?"

>examine bodies

 They are at peace. The fire in their hearts died aeons ago.

>examine gift

 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the

>examine kindergartener

 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the

>examine desk

 A flat piece of wood resting on four wooden legs. That is all.

>talk to copernik

 "Detective, I have already told you everything I know. Keeping me here
 serves no purpose."

 "I don't think so," he says. His eyes are fixed at your face. "You
 people always hide something. Why don't you tell me what it is so you
 can get out of here? I am used to staying in this crappy office. I am
 sure you are more uncomfortable than I am."

 He is right. The cramped room. The yellow walls. Everything
 contributes to the claustrophobic atmosphere.

>examine walls

 They might have been white in the distant past, but they have long
 since turned a sickly yellow color from the cigarette smoke - like the
 skin of a man slowly dying from liver cancer.

>examine skin

 He is delirious from fever. He clearly doesn't have long left to live.

 That is either not here, or doesn't need to be referred to at the

 It is filled with old cigarette butts, like tiny mummified bodies. To

 Detective Copernik is sitting on the chair behind the desk.

>examine ashtray

 The "ashtray" is an amorphous blob of congealed clay shaped so that it
 can just barely keep its contents from spilling all over the desk. It
 is filled with ancient cigarette butts, resting in the recess, like
 mummies from long forgotten eras.

>put icicle in rag

 You carefully wrap the icicle in the rag.

>give it to skin

 With the icicle carefully wrapped in the rag, you touch it to his
 forehead. There is a sigh of relief as his skin cools. A sizzling
 sound emerges from within the rag as the icicle melts, evaporates, and
 dissipates. The man opens his eyes - the color has returned to his
 skin.

 "Thank you, friend," he says, and smiles. "I feel much better now. I
 should probably go see my doctor." With that, he gets up and leaves
 the room. You are left holding the empty rag.

 You decide to visit the Baron again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside The Mansion</span>
 The stately mansion of the Baron von BÃ¼low looms in front of you.
 Light blares from two windows on the second floor, like the eyes of an
 angry giant. Two large mahogany doors guard the entrance to the north.
 The path to the south leads to the gate, away from the mansion.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Hall</span>
 It almost seems like a waste for such a massive entrance hall to be
 used to welcome a single person. The floor is a conflagration of red
 marble. Two sets of stairs lead up to a balcony above. French doors in
 the north side of the room lead to the back garden. To the south, the
 mahogany doors lead back out.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Garden</span>
 The grass here has been meticulously groomed. Not a single strand
 stands above the others, like citizens in a socialist utopia. Stone
 paths wind through the grass. From a fountain in the middle of the

 The mansion lies behind you, to the south.

 He sighs. "I guess you have a point. I am getting too old for this

 His eyes light up with greed as you show him the silver. "Wow, that'll
 certainly do the job, Mister. Thanks a lot." He pours the silver into
 a canteen, and secures the lid. "I can't wait to find out how much
 that will be worth. Enjoy your mountain trip, Mister." He removes the
 road block, gets into the cruiser, and drives down the road,
 disapearing around the corner.

 The road continues south before ending at a huge pile of rocks. A
 quaint log cabin has been erected east of the road.

 You see your car here.

>go east

 (first opening the cabin door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Log Cabin</span>
 The warm air in the cabin caresses your face. The heat comes from a
 cozy fireplace fire that fills the cabin with a soft warm light. An
 old couch stands by one of the walls. On the couch table are two
 glasses of brandy.

 You pick up one of the glasses of brandy. Mr. Wesson takes the other.

 You taste nothing unexpected.

>wesson, taste brandy

 (the first glass of brandy)
 Mr. Wesson has better things to do.

>make toast

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>sip brandy

 (the first glass of brandy)
 You clink the glasses together and down the brandy. A warm feeling
 spreads throughout your entire body. Mr. Wesson finishes his glass and
 sighs contentedly. He sits down at the couch and stares longingly at
 the fireplace. The fire is reflected in his eyes. "You know, sir, I
 have always dreamed of having my own cabin in the mountains. If it's
 okay with you I think I am just going to stay here. Do you think you
>yes

 He has served you well for so many years. You can't bear to refuse
 him.

 A smile lights up his face. "Thank you, sir. You can still visit me
 any time you want if you need my advice."

>talk to wesson

 "You will have to get rid of Camino before you can talk to Lisa, sir.
 Maybe try attacking him?"

 Mr. Wesson is lounging on the couch. He looks content.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Farther Along the Mountain Road</span> (in the car)
 The road continues to the west before turning around another corner.
 The path ahead is clear. To the east, the road leads back down the
 mountain.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle i">On the Mountain Road</span> (in the car)
 The road twists around the mountain, like the curves of a beautiful
 woman. To the north, the road turns left, disapearing behind walls of
 stone. Who knows where it might lead? To the south, the road leads
 back where you came from.

>examine walls

 Impenetrable.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Living Room</span>
 So this is were she has apparently been hiding this entire time. The
 living room is littered with expensive furniture - the kind that
 exists solely to show that the resident can afford it. You pay no
 attention to the decorations. The people are all that matters. The
 door to the south leads back out.

 Camino is looking straight at you. His face is contorted in a mixture
 of anger and surprise.

 Lisa is smiling nervously and looking at Camino, like a servant girl
 waiting for her master to handle matters.

>talk to camino

 "You again?" he says. "I thought Alfono would have taken care of you
 by now."

 You shrug. "I am tougher than I look. If you have other employees you
 need to get rid of, feel free to send them my way. Now, I think it's
 time for Miss BÃ¼low to go home."

 He laughs. "She is not going anywhere. Now scram, or I will deal with
 you myself."

>hit camino with knife

 You are not sure you can take him in a fair fight. You need to find a
 weak spot.

>camino

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine camino

 A tall thin man impeccably dressed in a beige suit and a trilby hat.
 Everything about him is beige; even his pale skin is almost
 indistinguishable from the color of his clothes. A scar crosses his
 left cheek, like a canyon in the middle of an otherwise pristine
 African savanna.

>examine hat

 A stylish beige trilby hat.

>examine suit

 A beige suit.

>examine savanna

 The savanna is dry, with only a few clumps of grass bravely clinging
 to their lives. The sun beats down mercilessly from above. You see no
 signs of animal life.

 There doesn't seem to be much point to throwing a clean brick into the

 I only understood the first part of that-- trying anyway.

 (retrying as if you'd typed "rub rag.")
 You achieve nothing by this.

 The brown brick is dry and porous. You can almost feel its thirst.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the Vacation House</span>
 The moonlight shines through the treetops. In front of you, to the
 north, is the house. There is light coming from both windows. To the
 south, the forest path leads back towards the city.

>go south

 Where would you like to go?


>2

 You head back to your office.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Office</span>
 Shadows huddle in the corners; the sickly yellow light from the desk
 lamp does little to dispel the darkness. An old cigarette butt lies in
 the ashtray. Your desk is covered with old case files - reminders of
 past glories. Apart from the desk, the only other furniture is an old
 office chair.

 The office door to the north leads to the corridor outside.

>take oil

 Taken.

 You put the oil into the white cocoon.

>put oil on brick

 You pour the oil on the brick. The viscous black fluid is quickly
 absorbed. The brick is now as black as midnight.

>go north

 Where would you like to go?

 You head towards the vacation house.

 Camino is looking straight at you. His face is contorted in a mixture
 of anger and surprise.

 Lisa is smiling nervously and looking at Camino, like a servant girl
 waiting for her master to handle matters.

>put brick in river

 You throw the oily brick down the canyon, and can just barely make it
 out hitting the river far, far below. The effect is immediate: The oil
 spreads quickly, and within moments the previously pristine profluence
 is black with pollution. You say a quick prayer for the poor fish who
 might have lived there. They never saw it coming.

>examine camino

 A tall thin man impeccably dressed in a beige suit and a trilby hat.
 Everything about him is beige; even his pale skin is almost
 indistinguishable from the color of his clothes. A gangrenous wound
 crosses his left cheek, like a polluted river.

>cut wound with knife

 That seems like a bad idea.

>hit camino with knife

 You are not sure you can take him in a fair fight. You need to find a
 weak spot.

>stab wound

 You don't have a knife.

>take knife

 You already have that.

 A small discreet knife, like a tiny needle.

 You feel nothing unexpected.

 That seems like a bad idea.

>stab camino with knife

 You are not sure you can take him in a fair fight. You need to find a

>throw knife at wound

 Futile.

>throw knife at camino

 You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

>cut wound with knife

 That seems like a bad idea.

>hit wound

 Before he has a chance to react, you reach out and rip some of the
 gangrenous flesh off his face. He should be thankful, really, but as
 he drops screaming to his knees with blood flowing from his cheek, you
 are sure that gratitude is the last thing on his mind. Lisa looks at
 him with contempt. "Is that really the best you can do?"

 He turns towards towards her; his face, a mask of rage. "YOU STUPID
 BITCH! I help cover up the murder of your pathetic boyfriend, and I
 have got nothing but misery to show for it. I am not going to risk my
 life for your sake anymore."

 He gets up, covering the wound with one hand, adjusting his hat with
 the other. "She is all yours, mister detective. Just keep her out of
 my sight." With that, he disappears out the door.

>talk to lisa

 "Okay, Miss von BÃ¼low, you've had your fun. Time to go home."

 She looks at her feet and chews at a bit of hair. "I am sorry I ran
 away, but I was so scared. I didn't mean to kill Erik. We were arguing
 and..." She sobs.

 "Don't worry about it," you say, and take her hand. "I am sure your
 father will be able to sort things out."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Library</span>
 Bookshelves line every wall, allowing only a small space for the door
 to the west and another one for the small window in the north wall.
 The floor is covered in a thick luxurious red carpet. The air smells
 of dust.

 Mr. Jameson is standing by the door.

 Detective Copernik is standing next to the Baron.

 Lisa von BÃ¼low is standing in front of her father, awaiting her
 judgement.

 The Baron sits in a black leather easy chair on the east side of the
 room.

>talk to baron

 Lisa looks pleadingly at her father. His face melts in the glow from
 her eyes, and he smiles.

 "Lisa, I have spoken to the detective, and I think we have reached an
 understanding."

 Copernik nods. "It is obvious that your daughter was being framed by
 Mr. Camino. No one could possibly suspect such an innocent creature. I
 will see to it that Camino is brought to justice for the murder of
 Erik McAllister. At the very least, you have no reason to worry,
 miss."

 She smiles. The kind of smile that wars have been fought over. "Thank
 you so much, Detective. You should come visit me some day. We could
 have lots of fun."

 "Well... I... Ehm..." The detective leaves the room without ever
 finishing the sentence.

 The Baron hands you your check. "Thank you so much for bringing my
 daughter back, Mr. Reilly. You can't imagine how much that means to
 me."

 "I was only doing my job," you assure him, as you accept the check. No
 need to get personal.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Your Office</span> (on the office chair)
 Shadows huddle in the corners, like dark pools of oil; the sickly
 yellow light from the desk lamp does little to dispel the darkness. A
 cigarette butt smolders in the ashtray, like the last embers from a
 dying camp fire. Your desk is covered with old case files - reminders
 of past glories. Apart from the desk, the only other furniture is an
 old office chair.

 The office door to the north leads to the corridor outside.

 There is a knock at the door.

>open door

 You get off the office chair.

 The door opens and your doctor enters the room.

>examine doctor

 A fine medical professional, no doubt. If only he wouldn't try to
 interfere with your life all the time.

>talk to doctor

 He looks around the office. "It stinks in here."

 It's the oil. It stinks up the place.

 "Have you been sitting in your office all day?"

 Of course not! You tell him all about the case. The Baron, the missing
 daughter, the treasure hidden beneath the lake. Everything.

 There is sadness in his eyes. "I spoke to Mr. Jameson. He mentioned
 that you did not seem well."

 What an asshole. You solved the case, didn't you?

 "I really wish you would listen to my advice. You need to take your
 medication every day. Lytton-Chandler syndrome is no joking matter."

 Absolutely. You will make sure to remember it from now on.

 "Very well." He sighs. "I will stop by and see how you are doing next
 week." He leaves, closing the door behind him.

 He is okay, though, just way too pedantic. You don't need to take it
 <span class="floydstyle em">every</span> day. You work much better without it.
