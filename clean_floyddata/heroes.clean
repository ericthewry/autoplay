 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Do not rise. You must rest, dearest. Rest, and I will tell you a
 story.

 No. Five stories.

 Only one is true. But it would not have mattered which.

 You will understand soon enough.

 Adventurer:

 Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. The bastard. And in
 the meantime you've gone from Adrienne the Adventurer to Adrienne the
 Ruffian, the Rogue, or, most often, "You there!"

 Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
 lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
 yours for everyone to covet. Funny when they tell you you shouldn't
 feel that way. And what do they tell you to feel instead?

 No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
 disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. Ha. You could never
 feel that way. For what kind of life is this? Your knowledge has
 faded. Your reflexes dulled. Your strength depleted. You've hardly
 cared if you live.

 But now... the winds bring rumor that Sedmon means to give the Gem to
 Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
 powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
 of Thorn's Companions who survived. With that threat, you find you do
 want to live after all. So you find yourself rebuilding your strength,
 retraining your eye, relearning your stratagems. Because you certainly
 know the solution to this problem.

 The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
 Get it in yours.

 Temple Way
 The grimy, ramshackle buildings of Oldtown dutifully try to reform
 themselves as you progress east down Temple Way, but nothing besides
 the temple itself makes any real pretense of belonging anywhere other
 than Oldtown. Or rather, nothing besides the temple and Baron Sedmon's
 nearby mansion.

 Temple Way opens up onto the well-lit Temple Square to the east.

 A large crate sits beside one of the buildings.

 [Type 'ABOUT' for important commands you can use.]

>about
 As Adrienne, you can talk to other characters using "ASK x ABOUT y" or
 "TELL x ABOUT y".

 You can also switch to a different story by typing "STORY".

 A large, wooden crate marked with Lennitt's seal.

>examine seal
 You've done some laboring for Lennitt in the past, and you recognize
 this seal as that which marks her crates.

>examine temple
 Which do you mean, the Temple of Justice, the Temple Way or the Temple
 Square?

>justice
 The Temple of Justice lies at the far side of the Temple Square.

>examine temple way
 Temple Way is one of the rare paved roads of Oldtown, in disrepair
 further west, but smooth as a Hip O' Grif's backside to the east.

>open crate
 That's not something you can open.

 You are carrying a brass lamp.

 A well-worn lantern you've held onto from the days when you would take
 point for Thorn, leading the Companions into darkness.

 The brass lamp is currently switched off.

 Adrienne the laze-about, sometime laborer, and, until a few days ago,
 the full-time drunkard. Hopefully your epitaph will mention Thorn's
 Companions instead.

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine temple
 Which do you mean, the Temple of Justice, the Temple Way or the Temple
 Square?

>square
 You travel east for a closer look.

 Temple Square
 Temple Square marks the east end of Oldtown. The Royal Crown's
 pretended attempts to improve Oldtown bear their only fruit here: the
 well-tended flower garden, the omnipresent guards, and the
 overdramatic Temple of Justice rising out of darkness to the east. But
 even here, the inadequecies of El's policies can be seen: Lennitt's
 warehouse presents an ugly back wall to the square to the northwest,
 while the entrance to The Barking Mermaid to the southwest hardly
 leads into the most beautiful establishment in Oldtown.

 Temple Way leads westward, away from the Temple; Droop Lane runs north
 (where Sedmon's mansion can be found) and south.

 You can see Branna and another guard here.

>examine branna
 One of the Royal Crown's many Temple guards. You know this one well.

>examine guard
 One of the Royal Crown's many Temple guards.

>ask branna about sedmon
 Branna says, "They say he slew the dragon that lived underneath Mount
 Griondol. Brought back the Dragon Gem as proof."

>ask branna about thorn
 Branna says, "One of the greats, they say. His death marked the end of
 Thorn's Companions, for without him they were nothing."

>ask branna about me
 Branna says, "I know you well enough, Adrienne. Not the most
 trustworthy person I know, but you'll do in a pinch."

>examine garden
 Though not quite so colorful in the evening light as they are during
 the day, the many kinds of flowers in the garden still lend an air of
 happiness and beauty that seems quite inappropriate to the area.

>ask branna about gem
 Branna says, "A bunch of magic mumbo-jumbo about it, but I don't
 believe a word of it. It's pretty enough, though."

 North Droop Lane
 Droop Lane winds slowly upwards through poorly tended warehouses,
 until it pauses here atop a hill, with Baron Sedmon's mansion facing
 the street from the east.

 You can see a guard here.

>go east
 The guard says, "Hey now Adrienne, I'm sure you're curious about the
 Dragon Gem, but you can't just waltz in to take a look at it. I
 suppose I could describe it for you."

>examine guard
 His outfit bears Sedmon's coat of arms, although you've never seen him
 around here before.

>ask guard about gem
 The guard says, "The Dragon Gem is, well, it's beautiful. The Baron's
 got it on display in his trophy room. It's secured pretty well; he
 doesn't really need me to protect it. Which is a good thing, since
 he's probably going to fire me when he finds out what I did." He
 sighs. "I'm in big trouble."

>ask guard about trouble
 The guard says, "Gambling debts, what else." He sighs again.
 "Actually, I paid off the gambling debts. But I hocked something of
 the Baron's; a trifling nothing, just enough so I could pay them off.
 I figured I'd recover it before he found out. But my luck hasn't
 turned yet. Hey, Adrienne, didn't you used to work for Beldano? That's
 where the Baron's item is, his pawn shop. I don't suppose... if you
 could somehow recover it for me, I'd be in your debt."

 Thievery. That's a line you haven't crossed in a few years, although
 you've done far worse.

 And there was that one time Beldano hid a key in his foyer's gutter
 when he didn't realize you were watching...

>ask guard about beldano

 The other guard walks over to you, looking the crate up and down.

 Branna calls over, "Let her be, man; she's done moving for Lennitt

 He shrugs and walks back to the center of the square.

 Pawnery Shop
 Shelves line the walls of this open room, with tables arranged around
 the center. The shop door leads out to the north. The back room where
 Beldano keeps the more expensive property lurks behind the hangings to
 the east.

 On the shelves are a crystalline sphere, an envelope (which is
 closed), and a tablecloth.

 On the tables are some candlestick holders and a candle.

 Sparkling and flawless. Just large enough you can't wrap your hand all

>open envelope
 You open the envelope, revealing some powder.

>examine powder
 Most people wouldn't recognize it: a green-white powder from the
 crushed leaves of the oinciea plant. You first learned of it from the
 Zan centaurs, who used darts to deliver it into the bloodstream of
 their enemies. You've since determined that it's just as deadly if
 swallowed, but harmless in contact with flesh.

>get envelope
 Taken.

>go east

 Back Room
 This is the location where Beldano stores his most valuable
 properties.

 In one corner of the room is a metal barrel with some liquid in it.

>examine barrel
 This is a barrel full of a crystal-clear acid. You can see clear
 through to the bottom, where there is a gold statuette.

>examine statuette
 It's a tiny figurine, a simplified human form, abstracted, with its
 arms in front, hands together.

 Great. Just great. Some "trifle". It's probably the most valuable
 thing in the whole place. And the best secured thing.

>get statue
 You can't reach into the barrel of acid bare-handed!

 And of course Beldano wasn't foolish enough to leave a tool around
 that could survive that acid. It'll probably take something magical.
 Where was that weird rune-engraved pole you saw somewhere in this part
 of town?

 Oh, right. On display in the Temple of Justice.

>examine gate
 Wrought of iron. Sturdy. Effectively impenetrable.

 A number of guards are loitering in the guardroom, talking amongst
 themselves and playing Hip O' Grif. One of them notices you looking

 Barking Mermaid Tavern
 The Barking Mermaid Tavern is hardly your kind of place. Poorly-built
 wooden benches with horrific stains, largely disreputable and somewhat
 unruly patrons, wretched-tasting but cheap ale; at first glance it's
 just perfect, but this close to the Temple of Justice, there's an
 unseemly lawfulness pervading the place.

 The tavernkeeper is keeping an eye on his guests and the servers.

 A spoon with a round hole in it has been discarded in a corner.

 Moreover, a supplicant desiring to appear in the Temple of Justice

 Temple of Justice
 The Temple of Justice is the Royal Crown's great equalizer. Within the
 Temple there is no special treatment based on class, wealth, or
 heritage. So the Royal Crown proclaims; so the claim is undisputed.
 The richly decorated ceiling arching over the whole place suggests
 majesty, money, and only the mildest hint of mysticism.

 Against the back wall of the temple is a glowing magic field.

 In the magic field is a pair of wooden hooks (on which is a copper
 pole).

 Temple of Justice
 The Temple of Justice is the Royal Crown's great equalizer. Within the

 The richly decorated ceiling arching over the whole place suggests
 majesty, money, and only the mildest hint of mysticism.

 pole).

 even here, the inadequecies of El's policies can be seen: Lennitt's
 warehouse presents an ugly back wall to the square to the northwest,
 while the entrance to The Barking Mermaid to the southwest hardly
 leads into the most beautiful establishment in Oldtown.

 Temple Way leads westward, away from the Temple; Droop Lane runs north
 and south.

 You can see Branna and another guard here.

 South Droop Lane
 Droop Lane comes to an end here amongst an array of storefronts. To

 Pawnery Shop
 Shelves line the walls of this open room, with tables arranged around
 the center. The shop door leads out to the north. The back room where
 Beldano keeps expensive property lurks behind the hangings to the

 On the tables are an envelope (which is closed) and some candlestick
 holders.

 You can see a pawnshop key here.

 Temple Square
 Temple Square marks the east end of Oldtown. The Royal Crown's
 pretended attempts to improve Oldtown bear their only fruit here: the
 well-tended flower garden, the omnipresent guards, and the
 overdramatic Temple of Justice rising out of darkness to the east. But
 even here, the inadequecies of El's policies can be seen: Lennitt's
 warehouse presents an ugly back wall to the square to the northwest,
 while the entrance to The Barking Mermaid to the southwest hardly
 leads into the most beautiful establishment in Oldtown.

 Temple Way leads westward, away from the Temple; Droop Lane runs north
 and south.

 You can see Branna and another guard here.

>go north

 North Droop Lane
 Droop Lane winds slowly upwards through poorly tended warehouses,
 until it pauses here atop a hill, with Baron Sedmon's mansion facing
 the street from the east.

 You can see a copper pole and a guard here.

>go east
 You make your way down the back corridor.

 Display Room
 Sedmon displays his prized possessions in this ostentatious two-story
 chamber. Paintings and torches alternate around the perimeter at
 various heights.

 In the center of the room a platform rises high up, out of reach.

 On the platform is the Dragon Gem.

>put candle in notch
 The candle almost, but doesn't quite, fit in the notch.

>light candle
 Oddly, there's no wick, but you manage to melt the end of the candle
 and make it rather soft.

>put candle in spoon
 You work the softened end of the candle into the spoon, uniting them.

>put candle in notch
 You work the melted end of the candle into the notch.

 The candle wax hardens.

>pull spoon
 Nothing obvious happens.

>turn spoon
 You turn the crank with a careful motion, and the platform slowly
 descends to shoulder level.

 For a moment, you feel as if you are being watched, and you look
 around the room slowly, half expecting to see a phantom stalker or the
 like--but there is nothing.

>examine gem
 Shimmering, many-facetted, it inspires envy in both rich and poor. You
 can feel a compulsion beyond what its mere beauty should produce.

>get gem
 You snatch the Dragon Gem off of the platform, then look around
 nervously. No alarms are sounding, but best not to wait.

 You're unsure what to expect from enchanters. You've never worried
 about the occasional fellow you've taken care of getting
 resurrected--after all, since El took power, only the former bard
 conducts The Way of the Grave; and even so it requires already knowing
 who the murderer was. As long as their abilities with stolen items are
 similar, you'll be safe.

 You hide the Gem under your cloak and walk back down the passage into
 the evening air. You notice Sedmon's guard is gone, but the moment of
 worry passes quickly as your hand brushes the Dragon Gem.

 Enchanter:

 Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. Laughable.

 Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
 lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
 yours for everyone to covet. It is astonishing the progress you have
 made. The focus and concentration on the Art you can engage now--for
 you have conquered such distractions. So.

 No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
 disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. A Master Thaumaturge.
 Your advances in divining from water ripples have given you a name in
 certain Circles, and you'd have thought your future assured.

 But now... the winds bring rumor that Sedmon means to give the Gem to
 Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
 powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
 of Thorn's Companions who survived. Blackhelm. A mere dabbler in the
 Art; but... You possess too little knowledge of Summoning to know what
 use the Dragon Gem would have, but you do not care to find out from
 the wrong end.

 The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
 Get it in yours.

 East-West Road
 Randomly arranged paving stones form this street, proceeding east

 You can see two guards here.

>examine guards

 One of the Royal Crown's useless lackeys.

>enchant guard
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 You are carrying a spell book.

>examine self
 Volthar the Thaumaturge, once a somewhat famous-hero; fortunately, a
 careful word here and there has erased that memory from popular
 culture, and the Circle knows you only as a studious, productive
 researcher.

>examine book
 You had to hurry when you heard about Blackhelm, and you couldn't find
 your favorite spell book, so you grabbed the first one to hand. It
 turned out to be an old and not very good one.

 It contains the following spells:

    gnusto    inscribe a spell in your spell book
    rezrov    open even locked or enchanted objects
    jindak    detect magic
    frotz     cause magical light
    zifmia    magically summon visible creature

 You memorize the frotz spell, but with so many spells to keep track
 of, you probably forgot one of the others.

>spells
 You currently have the frotz, zifmia, rezrov, and jindak spells
 memorized (in addition to the gnusto spell which you've memorized
 permanently).

 A blue glow appears around the guard and slowly intensifies to a

 The road from Newtown to Oldtown crests a hill beside Baron Sedmon's

 Must be a lackey of Sedmon, by his garb.

 The guard blocks your path. "Hey, you can't go in there." He eyes your
 clothing. "And don't think you can do any of those magic tricks on me.
 The Baron's put a spell of protection over me."

 The guard shimmers strangely.

 Meticulously placed shelves set off the bounds of the room, with

 counterbalance a door to the west that you recall, but cannot see.

 (which is closed).

 On the tables are some candlestick holders and a candle.

 Meticulously placed shelves set off the bounds of the room, with

 A small, well-tended flower garden lies at the center of this square.
 Lines of symmetry cross in several directions through the center of

 East-West Road
 Randomly arranged paving stones form this street, proceeding east
 towards a more attractive arrangement. The darkened buildings lean
 sloppily over the edge of the street, reducing the energetic potential

 Pawnshop Back Room
 The octagonal layout of this room aligns to suppress all but the most
 powerful magics. Various implements, utensils, and materials of magic
 line the free-standing shelves in the room.

 You can see a glass case (which is closed) (in which is a black
 scroll) here.

>examine implements
 Tools and technologies for the workings of numerous magical paradigms,
 but nothing that would serve you today.

>examine black scroll
 This black vellum scroll would most likely contains the smolpa
 invisibility spell.

 More serious magics will be required to get this out. You recall a
 Kriit in the Royal Crown's temple of 'justice'; its plane-shifting
 powers might work here.

>wave kriit
 You wave the Kriit. The runes on it glow faintly, but nothing else

>examine kriit
 The Kriit is a copper, rune-covered pole with a metal claw mounted

 The runes describe the postra spell, which creates a momentary
 sequence of portals through alternate planes of existence to create a
 portal to a nearby objects, allowing you to handle them at a distance.

>postra scroll
 At first, nothing happens. The Kriit vibrates slightly, and an ominous
 hum sounds. It builds, and for a moment you are disoriented. With a
 sudden flash, a spinning vortex of blue light appears next to you as
 simultaneously another appears next to the black scroll. You reach
 through the portal and watch your hand emerge from the other one.

 You fumble for the black scroll and barely notice a slight tug at your
 other hand. As you pull the scroll back through both portals, you see
 the Kriit disappearing through the portal next to you, clutched by a
 scale-covered hand.

 After a moment, the vortices disappear.

 Sedmon's prized possessions are arrayed in meaningless patterns around
 this two-story chamber. A careful arrangement of paintings and torches
 alternate around the walls of the room. A doorway leads out to the

 In the center of the room a platform rises high up, out of reach.

 On the platform is the Dragon Gem.

 On the platform you can see the Dragon Gem.

>get gem
 You pick up the Dragon Gem with a small smile. Merresin never was a
 winner in your competitions, even back in the days when you were both
 Thorn's companions.

 You activate a spell of recall which leaves you at the bottom of a
 prepared hole; you climb out, remove the ladder, and seal the hole
 shut. Enough to delay magical pursuers long enough not to be able to
 trace your second recall.

 For a moment you wonder about the strange disappearance of the Kriit,
 but it is of no real moment in the face of Blackhelm's defeat.

 As you realize you've kept the Gem from Blackhelm, you begin to ponder
 to what uses you might be able to put it in your own Art, cupping it
 fondly.

 Thief:

 Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. Strutting in the
 limelight like a puffed-up peacock. And those fools believe him.

 Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
 lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
 yours for everyone to covet. Ah, the foolishness of youth, for what
 wine would those words buy? What men would such pictures bed? Far
 better to simply sell the thing to a dandy like Ventillado. Too bad it
 went for such a pittance, since nobody else would touch the damn
 thing.

 No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
 disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. A better life. For
 thieving is best practised in secret, and now your skills have grown
 far beyond what your companions might have ever imagined you could
 possess. Enough to rob a sleeping dragon in his very lair.

 But now... the winds bring rumor that Sedmon means to sell the Gem to
 Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
 powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
 of Thorn's Companions who survived. Knowing Blackhelm, it was not
 chance, after all, that you overheard gossip about the Dragon Gem.
 Easy to imagine Blackhelm pulling the strings from behind the scene,
 playing you for the fool. So.

 The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
 Get it back in yours.

 Shadowy Road
 Sturdy, functional buildings lie in and out of shadow on the road to
 the temple square. Simple architecture, devoid of handholds; closely
 spaced buildings, devoid of alleyways; uncut walls, devoid of windows:
 the builders in this area knew how to encourage amateurs to go
 elsewhere.

 Sedmon's mansion lies somewhere north of the square to the east.

 A crate sits in the shadow of a building to the north.

 Warehouse Roof

 the stars shining from everywhere in the sky leave no particular
 shadows. The roof abuts the roof of a house to the north. From here
 you can go back down to the street.

>go north

 Atop A House
 A lightly sloping roof with a convenient chimney to hide along. An

>go east
 You're not sure you'll be able to get back up, but you've got to go

 Hillside
 This road winds up the hill towards Sedmon's mansion, which is just

 south. A wall of shrubbery to the northeast offers a purely
 psychological barrier to casual trespassers. You descended from a
 house to the west.

>examine shrubbery
 You can't see any such thing.

 Beside a Mansion
 Sedmon seems to have mounted guards at both of the entrances to his
 mansion, so your only option from here is back to the street to the

 East of Square
 A shadowed forecourt between the temple and the square offers you good
 cover from sight. The face of the temple offers limited opportunities
 to scale it, and the sole window is likely not where you want to go.
 You can skirt around the edge of the square northwest or southwest.

 A pair of guards stand at the center of the square.

 A closed gate is built into the temple wall to the east.

>examine gate
 Cast iron. Sturdy. Stops a few feet short of the ceiling.

>climb gate
 You scramble up and over the top of the gate, squeezing partially
 between two bars.

 Shadowed Corridor
 You stand at the end of a long foyer leading east to a narrow doorway
 into the temple itself. Light pours through windows in the north wall
 looking into a roomful of guards, leaving crisscrossing shadows.

>go north
 Outnumbered as you are, you couldn't overcome those guards.

>go east
 The guards are scarcely attentive to the foyer, so you have no trouble
 sneaking from one patch of darkness to the other, right under their
 noses.

 Temple Interior
 Given your choice of career, it's perhaps somewhat surprising this is
 only your second opportunity to see the interior of this place. It's
 pretty nice: hiding places aplenty, deep shadows at either side, and a
 suspicious dark hole in the back wall near the ceiling. The shadowed
 corridor lies west.

 An odd crack in the left side of the back wall catches your eye.

 Against the back wall of the temple is a glowing magic field.

 In the magic field is a pair of wooden hooks (on which is a copper
 pole).

>examine crack
 Looks like a secret door.

>examine hole
 You can't tell what it is at this distance.

>open door
 You pry at the crack and quickly lever open a secret door.

>enter door
 You ascend a dark, sloping corridor which, halfway up, doubles-back to
 the west.

 Temple Overlook
 This tiny chamber looks out over the temple to the west through a
 waist-high hole, opposite a dark passage leading back down.

 Directly below, a magic field glows against the wall.

 In the magic field is a pair of wooden hooks (on which is a copper
 pole).

 Given your choice of career, it's perhaps somewhat surprising this is
 only your second opportunity to see the interior of this place. It's
 pretty nice: hiding places aplenty, deep shadows at either side, and a
 suspicious dark hole in the back wall near the ceiling. The shadowed
 corridor lies west.

 A section of the east wall is turned out, revealing a tight corridor
 sloping up into darkness.

 Against the back wall of the temple is a glowing magic field.

 In the magic field is a pair of wooden hooks (on which is a copper
 pole).

 Shadowed Corridor
 You stand at the end of a long foyer leading east to a narrow doorway
 into the temple itself. Light pours through windows in the north wall
 looking into a roomful of guards, leaving crisscrossing shadows.

>go west
 You climb back over the gate.

 East of Square
 A shadowed forecourt between the temple and the square offers you good
 cover from sight. The face of the temple offers limited opportunities
 to scale it, and the sole window is likely not where you want to go.
 You can skirt around the edge of the square northwest or southwest.

 A pair of guards stand at the center of the square.

 A closed gate is built into the temple wall to the east.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

 Dead End
 Just south of the square, the road dead-ends amidst a wall of stores,
 with no safe route out but back northeast to the temple. To the south,

 Hillside
 This road winds up the hill towards Sedmon's mansion, which is just
 around the curve to the north, and back down to the square to the
 south. A wall of shrubbery to the northeast offers a purely
 psychological barrier to casual trespassers. You descended from a
 house to the west.

>go north
 You peer around the curve from the shadow to consider your approach,
 but the guard in front of the mansion turns to look in your direction
 almost the instant you look out, and you're forced to withdraw to
 avoid detection.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go northeast

 Beside a Mansion
 Sedmon seems to have mounted guards at both of the entrances to his
 mansion, so your only option from here is back to the street to the
 southwest, assuming you keep to the ground. The windowless wall to
 your north wears a decorative lip ten feet above ground.

>go up
 You ascend the side of the building to a lip on the second floor. You
 work your way around to the back of the building, where you find a
 small covered shutter. Opening it, you slip inside.

 Rafters
 You stand amongst strange vertical shadows in the rafters of a fancy
 little trophy room of sorts, with paintings and torches arranged at
 various heights along the walls. An open window leads out to the east.

 In the center of the room an intricate platform rises high up, but out
 of reach.

 On the platform is the Dragon Gem.

 Flickering shadows dance about the room from the shelves around the
 walls and the tables in the center. Beldano keeps most of his

 On the shelves are a glass ball, an envelope (which is closed), and a
 tablecloth.

 On the tables are some candlestick holders and a candle.

>go east
 You ascend a dark, sloping corridor which, halfway up, doubles-back to

 Temple Overlook
 This tiny chamber looks out over the temple to the west through a
 waist-high hole, opposite a dark passage leading back down.

 Directly below, a magic field glows against the wall.

 In the magic field is a pair of wooden hooks (on which is a copper
 pole).

>pour acid on hooks
 You pull the vial of acid out.

 You pour the acid against the wall over one of the hooks. The acid
 runs down the wall, slipping past the magic field, until it reaches
 the joint of the hook with the wall. There's a sizzle, and a moment
 later one of the hooks breaks free and falls to the ground straight
 through the field, the copper pole slipping and falling beside it with
 a clatter.

 Moments later a guard looks into the room--you resist the temptation
 to duck, remaining perfectly still--but after a moment she returns to
 the guardroom.

 You put the empty vial back in your right cloak pocket.

 various heights along the walls. An open window leads out to the east.

 In the center of the room an intricate platform rises high up, but out

 You reach down one-handed and grab the gem.

>swing
 You shift your weight, causing the pole to swing wider.

>go east
 You'll have to get out of the copper pole first.

>out
 You jump back to the rafters. Moments later, a guard enters the room
 from the doorway below. As his eyes go up to the platform, you slip
 the gem in a your left cloak pocket and slide out the window unseen.
 So much for Yenalda's third rule.

 You slip around the side of the building and descend, checking to make
 sure the Gem is still in your pocket.

 This has to have been the messiest job you've ever taken. You should
 have known better than to trust Sedmon, after the last job he offered
 you. "It's a harmless artifact called a kriit. Nobody will miss
 it."--when your researcher said it was used for a ritual called "The
 Way of the Dead", you turned it down right away, before even learning
 what a kriit was or what exactly the ritual did.

 Still, you got the upper hand this time: stole the dragon's treasure,
 got paid for it by the Baron, and ended up with the Gem yourself. Not
 a bad week.


 You have finished this story. But another two remain.

 Do you want this character to be [m]ale or [f]emale?








 Royalty:

 Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. The peasantry do
 love to forget a title and pretend a hero is one of theirs.

 Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
 lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
 yours for everyone to covet. Of course, it is your name on the royal
 decrees, your face on the coins, and your pick of the Royal Jewels for
 your costume each day. But you detect an honesty in the grotesque
 admiration for the Baron--one you'll not find in the simpering toadies
 who serve you. But no.

 No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
 disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. The things you did
 then--the life you abandoned--all small prices to have paid for the
 luxurious lifestyle you've gained.

 But now... the winds bring rumor that Ventillado means to give the Gem
 to Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
 powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
 of Thorn's Companions who survived. Thankfully, Ventillado is said to
 be a loyal citizen of the crown. And you can afford to be generous in
 recompense.

 The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
 Get it in yours.

 Avenue
 This broad avenue leads right into Temple Square, the heart of
 fabulous New Oldtown. Towering over the square to the east you do
 perceive your stark white Temple of Justice, beautiful and
 well-appointed, offering a statement to the neighborhood: this, this
 is what progress is about. Sadly, the buildings around you are
 scarcely up to this new standard; Baron Ventillado's house north of
 the square is much more satisfactory. How you hate having to come
 here. This would all be so much simpler if Blackhelm were found dead
 one morning, but it's never happened yet, despite your best efforts.

 [Type 'ABOUT' for important commands you can use.]

>about
 As King Elando, you can give orders to the other characters, as in
 "GENE, GIVE AXE TO BOB". Characters can FOLLOW you or other
 characters. If a character is bothering you, you might try getting
 someone to ARREST or EXECUTE them. If you're in a nicer mood, you can
 just DISMISS them yourself.

 Infinite Corridor
 Lovely, just lovely. The corridor leading into the temple seems nearly
 infinitely long, owing to a little tricky architecture you invented.
 As the corridor slowly shrinks, sloping upwards, even the
 ornamentation on the walls gets smaller and spaced more closely
 together. But you know the tiny doorway is really only a few steps to
 the east. The entry from the north is normally sized, to give the
 guards rapid access should any malign persons intrude.

 Temple of Justice
 Glorious. If only you could build something this grand in Newtown; but
 there's little need to mete out the King's justice there. Since it's

 vaulted ceiling still shines through nearly as well.

 Against the back wall of the temple is a glowing magic field.

 In the magic field is a pair of wooden hooks (on which is a copper
 pole).

 Peeress Dwojadsa and several guards arrive.

>examine pole
 A long, copper, rune-covered pole with a mechanical claw mounted atop.
 The bottom is capped with a dial.

>get pole
 It would be inappropriate to do that yourself. You're the king!

>peeress, get pole
 Peeress Dwojadsa says, "The magic field isn't open."

>peeress, open field
 Peeress Dwojadsa says, "That's not something I can open."

>guards, open field
 You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>guard, open field
 Who do you mean, the temple guard or a royal guard?

>temple
 The temple guard says, "Your Majesty, you yourself ordered that pole
 secured many years ago. Your minister of internal affairs took the
 talisman needed to disable the field. That would have been Knight
 Dwelubi, back before he lost his position to overindulgence."

 Temple Square
 The gorgeous Temple of Justice towers to the east over this square,
 which despite your luscious flower garden, is still as much a wreck as
 Oldtown proper to the west. A disreputable tavern lies southwest.
 Roads lead south to shops and north by Ventillado's house to Newtown.

 You can see Baroness Holfoy Woya, Knight Gessann Fleghannolfimm and
 three royal guards here.

 Baroness Woya says to Knight Fleghannolfimm, "I overheard someone say
 Lady Pishel was with Peer Kloppom by the river, and they were sharing
 an opium dream!"

 Knight Fleghannolfimm replies, "Outrageous!"

 Peeress Dwojadsa and several guards arrive.

>about
 As King Elando, you can give orders to the other characters, as in
 "GENE, GIVE AXE TO BOB". Characters can FOLLOW you or other
 characters. If a character is bothering you, you might try getting
 someone to ARREST or EXECUTE them. If you're in a nicer mood, you can
 just DISMISS them yourself.

 You can also switch to a different story by typing "STORY".

>Dwojadsa, summon Dwelubi
 Peeress Dwojadsa looks confused. "I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I'm not
 sure how to do that."

 Peeress Dwojadsa says to Baroness Woya, "I saw it with my own eyes!
 Baronet Juffannazlo was with Princess Gubi in the best room in the
 palace, and they were working on necking!"

 Knight Fleghannolfimm says to Peeress Dwojadsa, "I heard that Lady
 Pishel was by the waterfall on the river sharing a pipe with Peer
 Kloppom!"

 Time passes.

 Peeress Dwojadsa says to Baroness Woya, "I overheard someone say Lady
 Pishel was by a waterfall blowing smoke at Peer Kloppom."

 Slovenly Tavern
 The Barking Mermaid Tavern is hardly your kind of place. Poorly-built
 wooden benches with horrific stains, largely disreputable and unruly
 patrons, disgusting foam-dripping ale. An enticing exit leads
 northeast.

 A tavernkeeper is trying to keep an eye on his guests and the servers.

 You can also see Knight Hedarg Dwelubi and Lord Romegh Raburba here.

 Knight Dwelubi says to Lord Raburba, "Rumor has it that Lord Miyaz was
 with Baron Liyaz by a brook, and they were arguing with Lady Pimmish."

 Knight Dwelubi's eyes grow wide as you enter. "Your Majesty! It's not
 how it appears, I swear. I just needed to wet my whistle."

 Peeress Dwojadsa and several guards arrive.

>dwelubi, follow me
 Knight Dwelubi says, "By your command."

 Peeress Dwojadsa says to Lord Raburba, "I personally saw Lord
 Purzurabo was behind the throne in the palace yelling at Knight
 Brojess."

 You can see Ventillado's servant, Lord Prazed Pojadubiur, and a royal
 guard here.

 Peeress Dwojadsa arrives.

 Lord Pojadubiur says to Peeress Dwojadsa, "I heard that Lord Jolfad is
 under arrest for carrying on an assignation in the royal treehouse."

 Several guards arrive.

>royal guard, give pole to servant
 The royal guard gives the copper pole to Ventillado's servant.

 Peeress Dwojadsa says to Lord Pojadubiur, "Rumor has it that Lady
 Pishel was in Westfall having a big party with Peer Kloppom."

 Plain Room
 Sedmon displays his prized possessions in this shabby two-story
 chamber. Paintings and torches alternate randomly around the walls at
 various heights. A doorway leads west.

 In the center of the room a platform rises high up, out of reach.

 On the platform is the Dragon Gem.

 You can also see Baron Ventillado and Baronet Klojsa Soatannishoy
 here.

 Ventillado's servant arrives.

 Several guards arrive.

>guard, get gem with pole
 Who do you mean, the temple guard or a royal guard?

>royal
 The royal guard looks confused. "I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I'm not
 sure how to do that."

>royal guard, get gem
 The royal guard says, "I can't reach it from down here."

>servant, get gem
 Ventillado's servant says, "I'm afraid we can't get it without the
 Baron's crank, and it appears he's misplaced it. If we had a pole we
 could probably knock it down."

 Peeress Dwojadsa arrives.

>ventillado, give gem to me
 Who do you mean, Ventillado's servant or Baron Ventillado?

>baron ventillado, give gem to me
 Baron Ventillado says, "I'm afraid I'm a bit light-headed today, Your
 Highness. Perhaps my servant can help you."

 Peeress Dwojadsa says to Baronet Soatannishoy, "A friend told me that
 Lady Pishel was in Westfall having a big party with Peer Kloppom!"

 Baronet Soatannishoy replies, "Who would have thought it!"

>ventillado's servant, give gem to me
 Ventillado's servant says, "I'm afraid we can't get it without the
 Baron's crank, and it appears he's misplaced it. If we had a pole we
 could probably knock it down."

 Peeress Dwojadsa says to Baronet Soatannishoy, "A friend told me that
 Lord Jolfad is under arrest for attempting an assassination from the
 royal treehouse!"

>royal guard, give pole to servant
 The royal guard gives the copper pole to Ventillado's servant.

>ventillado's servant, give gem to me
 Ventillado's servant nods to you, then turns to face the platform. He
 jumps and thrusts the pole, just missing the Dragon Gem. He waits a
 moment, then tries again. As he thrusts the pole at the gem, his hand
 twists the dial, and moments later he is back on the ground, the claw
 at the end of the pole clutching the Dragon Gem. He holds the claw out
 towards you and releases the Gem into your hands.

 You clutch it tightly to your chest. Another of Blackhelm's attempts
 on your life successfully foiled.

 "Baron Ventillado, this is a wonderful present you have given me. Many
 thanks."

 The Baron's brow contracts, but he stops just short of a frown. "You
 are welcome, Your Majesty."

 Ignoring the prattling of your entourage, you step back out to the
 darkening sky.

 "Not this time!" you cry out. So much for that crone's dire prophecy.
 No doubt Blackhelm will try again--such a bother, just because you
 refrained from giving Blackhelm's lover a helping hand that one time.
 That one time when he was hanging desperately on the edge of a cliff.
 What else could you have done? If you had helped him, he would have
 claimed the crown you'd found together. He would be the king. He'd
 have the Dragon Gem.

 And that would be most unsatisfactory.


 You have finished this story. But one more remains.

 In this story you will play as a dragon.

 Dragon:

 Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, then. We laughed, for we
 seemed alive, still.

 We had been twenty years younger, then we would have been the name on
 the man-things' lips. We would have been the visage on their
 paintings. And we would still have the Kthyress Crystal with which we
 would bring covetousness into man-things' hearts. But we were too
 young for detection of certain trickery; we were too old for
 resistance to certain magics. We had failed.

 We had felt no regrets twenty years before. We had ceased our toils at
 heroism when we saw the end of Thorn's Companions; but we had lived
 still, we had begun a new life. We paid the price for our youthful
 indiscretion; we were made small by Sethidrac's assignment. We,
 guardian. We, to guard one-ninth of the Legacy.

 Then we heard rumor on the winds. We heard of a transfer of the
 Crystal from Sedmon to Blackhelm. Blackhelm. A guileful creature
 amongst creatures of guile. We had our suspicions about the theft. And
 we knew of the powers of the Crystal. We wondered at Blackhelm's
 knowledge. We wondered at the anger in Blackhelm towards those who
 were amongst Thorn's companions.

 We had been too long letting Sedmon hold the Crystal. We risked emnity
 from Sethidrac and Passidrac for too long. We could not yield the
 possession of the Crystal to Blackhelm. We had to make it ours.

 Open Tunnel
 We were surrounded by the man-things' structures, structures of dead
 trees and rock and distortions of iron. Beneath us we felt the
 arrangements of stone into a path for man-things' mobile receptacles.
 We could smell hints of the Crystal along the path to the east.

 We could see a receptacle here.

 [Type 'ABOUT' for important commands we could use.]

>lay egg
 We were unfamiliar with that verb.

>about
 As we were a dragon, we possessed abilities unavailable to man-things.
 We could breathe on things; we could destroy things with our powerful
 body; we could discern many things from scents.

>examine receptacle
 We sensed the emptiness of the immobile receptacle.

>smell
 We smelled the faint trace of Kythress from the east.

>roar
 We were unfamiliar with that verb.

>examine receptacle
 We sensed the emptiness of the immobile receptacle.

>breathe on me
 We would not accomplish anything if we burned yourself.

>destroy it
 We smashed the receptacle to pieces.

 trees and rock and distortions of iron. Beneath us we felt the

 We could smell hints of the Crystal along the path to the east.

>go east

 Plain
 We stood in a more open space. On all sides of us we observed
 structures, with a particularly large white one to the east. In the
 center we perceived fresh plants in a location inappropriate to their
 origins, with insufficient bare earth. We could follow man-paths
 south, west, and north, or towards the eastern structure.

 We could see two man-things here.

 We heard shrieks from a man-thing, "Wuthe-elistha-migodisa-drakin.
 Dran-dran-dran."

>eat man-thing
 We first attempted to take the man-thing.

 We imagined displeasure from the man-thing at that prospect.

>breathe on man-thing
 We let loose a torrent of flame, and when we stopped, we could no
 longer see the man-thing.

 We heard screams from a man-thing.

>go north

 Hillside
 We stood upon a sloping hillside; we were only partially surrounded by
 man-thing structures. Further north was the entrance of the man-path
 to the city; south more structures. We scented the Crystal to the
 east.

 We could see a man-thing here.

 We saw the man-thing's eyes upon us. We saw a lack of further
 movement.

>go east
 We observed a change in the man-thing's position. We could not enter
 with him in the way.

 We heard sounds come forth from the man-thing. We were surprised that
 we heard the true speech, not the man-thing chatter. We heard some
 distortion, yes, but still. We heard its speech. "Hail, Draco. Thou
 wouldst want thy crystal returned to thee, I suppose."

>nod
 We were unfamiliar with that verb.

>yes
 We weren't intending that as a question.

 We heard the man-thing's voice, "My master will willingly give the
 crystal unto thee, if thou wouldst do us a small service."

>wait
 We allowed time to pass us by.

 We heard the man-thing's utterance, "If thou canst deliver to me the
 copper pole which lies in yon hideous white structure to the south, I
 will stand aside and allow thee to reclaim thy crystal."

>breathe on man-thing
 We watched the appearance of a part in the flames around the
 man-thing. We saw no damage to it.

>go south

 Plain
 We stood in a more open space. On all sides of us we observed
 structures, with a particularly large white one to the east. In the

 origins, with insufficient bare earth. We could follow man-paths
 south, west, and north, or towards the eastern structure.

 We could see a man-thing here.

>go east

 Blasted Plain
 We stood on a plain of rock, grey below us and around us, white to the
 east. We could leave west. We perceived a tiny hole to one side.

 We could also see a barrier of metal segments before an eastward
 tunnel.

>examine barrier
 We could sense the truth of iron inside what we saw as too-regular
 slivers in orderly, artificial groups.

>destroy it
 We smashed our body against the gate and we felt its internal
 distress. We smashed against it again, and we smashed through it as
 well.

>go east

 Narrowing Cave
 We stood within a man-thing cave which rapidly narrowed to the east
 into an entrance the size of a small man-thing. We observed passages
 to the north and the west.

>go east
 We could not fit through the narrow entrance.

>go north

 Cave Junction
 We stood in a small chamber full of the leavings and scents of
 man-things. We saw a metal barrier to the east and a wide-open passage
 south.

 We could see six man-things here.

 We heard cries from a man-thing, "Godistroo-izadran-wadwedoo."

>go east
 We could not with the metal barrier in the way.

 We saw the departure of a terrified man-thing.

>destroy barrier
 We could not destroy the thick door.

 We heard shrieks from a man-thing, "Witzawanithus-wedindoo-nuthn."

>examine door
 We saw iron, and much of it.

>breathe on door
 We breathed, but we were not generating sufficient heat.

 We heard screams from a man-thing.

 We could not destroy the thick door.

>go south

 Open Tunnel
 We were surrounded by man-thing structures in all directions save the
 north; we were blocked from further travel south by an adjustable
 barrier in the middle of the southern structure.

>examine door
 We saw nothing special about the barrier.

>destroy barrier
 We smashed the barrier to pieces.

>go south

 Twisty Cave
 We breathed gently through our nostrils so that we could shed light
 upon our surroundings. We stood in a dim man-thing cave; we saw
 man-thing protrusions and surfaces on which rested the artifacts of
 the man-things. We smelled something very strong from the east, and we
 could also exit northwards.

 On the protrustions we could see a transparent sphere, a plant sheet,
 and a weave of hair.

 On the surfaces we could see some metal sticks and an animal stick.

>examine sheet
 We looked at a flat sheet which smelled of dead plant.

>examine sphere
 We saw through it and we saw ourselves in it. We knew it as
 man-crystal. We saw no worth in it.

>eat sphere
 We first attempted to take the transparent sphere.

 We would not have enjoyed eating a transparent sphere.

>examine weave
 We looked on a weave of animal hair; we knew such creations of
 man-things from our travels with them. We knew comfort and decorations
 as common reasons for their existence.

>eat plant sheet
 We first attempted to take the plant sheet.

 We were carrying as much as we could carry already.

>inventory
 We were carrying a transparent sphere.

>drop sphere
 We dropped the transparent sphere.

>eat plant sheet
 We first attempted to take the plant sheet.

 We would not have enjoyed eating a plant sheet.

>smell plant sheet
 We smelled nothing beyond the excessive odor of man-thing towns.

>drop it
 We dropped the plant sheet.

>open plant sheet
 We lacked the dexterity for such actions.

>examine tablecloth
 We looked on a weave of animal hair; we knew such creations of
 man-things from our travels with them. We knew comfort and decorations
 as common reasons for their existence.

>go east

 Back of Cave
 We were at the back of the man-thing cave which we could exit to the
 west; we hardly saw the things in heaps and piles we were casting
 light on with our soft breaths, so assaulted were we by the smell from
 a metal receptacle in the corner.

>examine receptacle
 We could smell the source of the strong smell we had smelled outside
 the cave; we perceived the smell from the clear liquid in the
 receptacle. We could also see through the liquid, where we saw a gold
 figure.

>examine liquid
 We smelled a very strong yet not unpleasant odor from the clear
 liquid.

>examine figure
 We saw a tiny figurine, a man-thing form, its arms in front, hands
 together.

>take figure
 We had no interest in it.

>drink liquid
 We lowered our snout to the barrel and sucked deeply from the barrel.
 We felt a warm, fine sensation as we swallowed the liquid.

 We experienced a heavy sensation inside. We disagreed with the liquid.
 We resisted its affronts, but we could not digest it.

>take liquid
 (the stomachful of liquid)
 We were already in possession of that.

>inventory
 We were carrying a stomachful of liquid.

>go west

 Cave Junction
 We stood in a small chamber full of the leavings and scents of
 man-things. We saw a metal barrier to the east and a wide-open passage
 south.

 We could see five man-things here.

 We heard shrieks from a man-thing.

>breathe on barrier
 We expelled the liquid onto the metal barrier and watched its rapid
 dissolution to nothing.

 We saw the departure of a terrified man-thing.

 We saw the departure of a terrified man-thing.

>go east

 Cavern
 We stood in a spatious cavern, but we took no joy from it. We were
 surrounded by the results of distortion and torture of rock and earth
 and stone; we felt only horror. We desired departure above all else,
 and so we kept our eyes upon the west exit.

 Against the back of the cavern we saw a ring of light.

 In the ring of light we could see a pair of wooden rods (on which was
 a copper pole).

>examine light
 We saw the center of the ring of light around the rods within it.

>get pole
 The ring of light was in the way.

>destroy light
 We could accomplish nothing this way.

>examine rods
 We saw the attachment of the hooks to the wall.

>breathe on light
 We breathed on the hooks. We watched our breath's lack of penetration
 through the circle of magic. We watched the flames around the ring. We
 stopped our breath. We watched the gradual diminution of the fire.

 We determined that we could not expect blockage of heat by such magic
 as we saw the collision of the copper pole with the ground.

>get pole
 We took the copper pole.

>go west

 Cave Junction
 We stood in a small chamber full of the leavings and scents of
 man-things. We saw an open entrance to the east and a wide-open

 to the city; south more structures. We scented the Crystal to the
 east.

 We could see a man-thing here.

>give pole to man-thing
 We saw the man-thing's stretch for the copper pole. We observed the
 pole in its clutches. We saw locomotion by the man-thing from in front
 of the entrance to the structure.

>go east

 We traversed a maze of twisty little passages; we used the scent of
 Kthyress as a guide.
 Cave
 We stood in a tall cave. We saw markings upon the walls, and man-thing
 torches. The cave led out to the west.

 We observed a structure of wood; we saw near the ceiling as the limit
 of its reach.

 On the wooden structure we could see the Kthyress Crystal.

>examine crystal
 With what mere words could we describe the Kthyress Crystal? We had no
 particular fondness for the deception, its geas of greed. But we had
 the obligation; we were the guardian of it, the bait for the trap. The
 trap that we had failed to spring this time.

>examine wood
 A construction of once-sturdy trees, an artificial arrangement; we saw
 its uppermost surface near the stalactities amongst the top of the
 cave.

>breathe on structure
 We let loose a torrent of flame, and when we stopped, we could no
 longer see the wooden structure.

>get crystal
 We pulled the Kthyress Crystal from within the smoke and rubble. We
 had discharged the first of our duties.

 We emerged onto the hillside and we discovered the departure of the
 oddly powerful man-thing with the wrong odor. We were suddenly in
 recollection of the scent we had sensed with the man-thing, but not
 from it: Blackhelm. We realized that creature's association with
 Blackhelm.

 Yet we knew Blackhelm was just another man-thing. We would not concern
 ourselves with Blackhelm's plots so long as we were not involved in
 them again.

 As we set forth on the journey to the mountain, we pondered what we
 would say to Sethidrac about our trip. We knew the claims of the
 others our age, but we disbelieved Sethidrac was cognizant of the
 smell of prevarication.

 Royalty:

 Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. The peasantry do
 love to forget a title and pretend a hero is one of theirs.

 Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
 lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
 yours for everyone to covet. Of course, it is your name on the royal
 decrees, your face on the coins, and your pick of the Royal Jewels for
 your costume each day. But you detect an honesty in the grotesque
 admiration for the Baron--one you'll not find in the simpering toadies
 who serve you. But no.

 No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
 disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. The things you did
 then--the life you abandoned--all small prices to have paid for the
 luxurious lifestyle you've gained.

 But now... the winds bring rumor that Ventillado means to give the Gem
 to Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
 powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
 of Thorn's Companions who survived. Thankfully, Ventillado is said to
 be a loyal citizen of the crown. And you can afford to be generous in
 recompense.

 The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
 Get it in yours.

 Avenue
 This broad avenue leads right into Temple Square, the heart of
 fabulous New Oldtown. Towering over the square to the east you do
 perceive your stark white Temple of Justice, beautiful and
 well-appointed, offering a statement to the neighborhood: this, this
 is what progress is about. Sadly, the buildings around you are
 scarcely up to this new standard; Baron Ventillado's house north of
 the square is much more satisfactory. How you hate having to come
 here. This would all be so much simpler if Blackhelm were found dead
 one morning, but it's never happened yet, despite your best efforts.

 Temple Square
 The gorgeous Temple of Justice towers to the east over this square,

 Plain Room
 Sedmon displays his prized possessions in this shabby two-story
