 It's a good life as a freelance villainous advisor. Here you sit,
 secure in your tastefully opulent headquarters, critiquing
 vault-robbery plans and helping tongue-tied ne'er-do-wells craft their
 grandiose monologues. It may not be a hands-on sort of villainy, but
 as the Americas languish through year after year of depression and
 Europe lurches towards yet another Great War, it seems an altogether
 pleasant way to keep your hands clean.

 But now the phone is ringing. One of your clients is contacting you on
 Line 1, hoping for on-the-job consultation via electro-radiographic
 zeta-wave transmitter. That's not a service you provide to just
 anybody; the retainer is quite substantial.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Office</span>
 You sit in your pleasant office, surrounded by mementos of your
 numerous exploits.


 I beg your pardon?


 Your appearance is unknown even to your clients, whom you contact via
 various radio transmitters.

 The phone rings again.

>answer phone

 Good afternoon, Owl. Or good morning, evening, or night, since I
 shouldn't care to hazard a guess as to your time zone.

 But be that as it may. It is I, Amelia Derringer! I flatter myself to
 think that you may have heard of me; I'm the infamous thief who has
 been delighting and terrorizing England for three years now. As you
 undoubtedly know, I'm no ordinary sneak-thief. I became a cat burglar
 after acquiring an uncanny ability to shape-shift. All I need to do is
 eat a bit of an animal, and I can harness some small fraction of its
 special powers. It's served me well in my many successful burglaries,
 and I've acquired a reputation as a master thief, along with a lot of
 other people's money.

 But now I'm in a bit of a pickle, you know. Here I am, suspended in a
 cage over a slavering octopus. It's not something that would
 ordinarily confound me, of course, but I'm afraid I've mislaid my bag
 of thief tools---or rather, I had it mislaid for me by one of Rex
 Dashing's confounded robots. If it's not too much of a bother, would
 you be so kind as provide some sort of advice? I'd rather like to
 escape this cage, make my way through the airship, and help myself to
 a few cuttings of the Telepathic God-Slug of Madagascar. My research
 indicates that Rex Dashing keeps its body somewhere about his airship.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Aquarium</span> (in the steel cage)
 As clichÃ© as it is, I'm trapped in a cage being slowly lowered into a
 tank. This particular tank is at least occupied by a vicious octopus
 rather than a horde of piranhas or sharks, which I suppose is at least
 mildly original. There is a prominent red button on the wall here,
 tantalizingly out of reach. There's also an exit south and a trapdoor
 overhead, though neither one is going to be useful to me until I get
 out of this accursed cage.

 One of the tentacles of that dratted beast is slurping over the edge
 of the cage! I trust you have something clever in mind.


 All right, if you insist...

 Well, that was certainly distasteful. I'm not sure I got more than a
 mouthful of slime, or ichor, or whatever the deuce you call it. I do
 seem to have come over all rubbery, though.

 Another tentacle is slithering over the floor of the cage! Help!


 The cage is in the way.

 It's getting very crowded in this cage with all the tentacles crawling
 into it. Help!


 The cage is in the way.


 Steel, I should think, unless it happens to be one of those
 lightweight galvanic alloys one hears so much about. The bars of the
 cage are set about four inches apart, which should be just wide enough
 for me to squeeze through with my new rubbery power.

 It's getting very crowded in this cage with all the tentacles crawling
 into it. Help!

>leave cage

 With my newfound rubberiness, I think I should be able to slip through
 the bars. Let me just twist...and...

 Capital! I've just squeezed through the bars and gracefully
 somersaulted onto the ground below. It's a shame you couldn't have
 seen it, Owl; it really was a magnificent feat of dexterity.

 Now that the immediate threat has passed, I should elaborate on my
 mission. I managed to sneak about the Mephistopheles in order to steal
 the elusive Telepathic God-Slug of Madagascar, a rare creature whose
 secretions have an intense pacifying effect on anyone who comes into
 contact with them. If I obtained the slug and ate it---just a nibble,
 mind you, not enough to kill it---then I could use my shapeshifting
 powers to harness that effect for myself. The Slug has no loftier
 ambitions for its power than confusing predators, but I plan to use it
 to establish a new world of peace and cooperation. With the power to
 affect the psychology of a few chosen leaders of industry and
 government, I could eliminate war entirely and bring about a pacifist
 utopia over which I have complete control---to the best possible ends,
 of course.

 That was the idea, anyway. While I was bantering with Dashing over
 dinner, I accidentally tipped my hand. I don't think he ever realized
 the significance of the God-Slug; to him, it was just another trophy
 from his adventures. He figured out I was up to something, though, and
 had his robots drag me down here and---well, you know the rest.

 I need your help, Owl, to complete my mission. I want to find the
 God-Slug of Madagascar and safely escape the ship. I was told that
 you're the best in the business. Let's see what you can do.


 I'm not in the cage, thank goodness.

 I'm afraid my animal power has subsided. It only lasts for a brief
 time, you know.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aquarium</span>
 I'm standing at the edge of a vast tank, above which a cage is
 suspended. Fortunately, I'm no longer in the cage. I know you're
 already aware of that fact; I just like repeating it. There is a
 prominent red button on the wall, and an exit leads south. There's
 also a trapdoor high overhead.

 I can see a steel cage here.


 I can't see any such thing.


 The cage is in the way.


 Steel, I should think, unless it happens to be one of those
 lightweight galvanic alloys one hears so much about. The bars of the
 cage are set about four inches apart, which is far too narrow for me
 to squeeze through.

>push button

 The tank closes, mercifully trapping the octopus underneath.


 The trapdoor is open.


 It's far above my head, and the walls are too steep to climb.

>push button

 With a ponderous rumble, the tank opens again. The octopus would be a
 welcome sight under different circumstances; octopodes are so ugly
 they're almost cute.

>eat octopus

 All right, if you insist...

 Well, that was certainly distasteful. I'm not sure I got more than a
 mouthful of slime, or ichor, or whatever the deuce you call it. I do
 seem to have come over all rubbery, though.

>push button

 The tank closes, mercifully trapping the octopus underneath.

>go up

 It's far above my head, and the walls are too steep to climb.

>climb walls with my tentacle powers wth?

 I can't see any such thing.

>climb wall

 I can't see any such thing.


 That's not something I can enter.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gallery</span>
 This room is garishly appointed with the hunting trophies Dashing must
 have scavenged throughout the world: hulking bears and moose from the
 Americas, lions from Africa, elephants from the Orient, and a
 menagerie of creatures even I barely recognize. While I obviously
 don't approve of his vicious little hobby, I have to admit that he at
 least has a healthy respect for nature.

 Exits lead north, west, and east (the last being through a heavy metal
 door), and a spiral staircase elegantly winds upward.

 I can see a display case (which contains a cudgel, a harpoon, and a
 mace) here.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your fee has just gone up by $1 million.]</span>


 Just a moment, Owl. I can hear something heavy and ponderous coming
 down from the stairs. It must be another one of Dashing's robots! I
 have no intention of having them throw me in that cage again, so it
 seems prudent to hide behind one of these taxidermized animals until
 the patrol passes. I don't know what alerted them to my escape; if
 there had been some sort of trap or alarm on the cage, I'm sure I
 would have noticed it.

 My animal power has subsided.


 I can't see any such thing.


 That's not a verb I recognize.

 Greetings, Owl. My apologies for the intrusion, but...

 (Wait, no, that's not right. Never apologize! The world is yours to
 command, Radon! Very well, a fresh start of it. Always look forward.
 EXCELSIOR!)

 Ahem. At last I, PROFESSOR RADON, address the all-knowing OWL! What in
 Hades ever took you so long? I'm holding these ACCURSED automata off
 for now, but they've got me cornered at the reactor entrance! Regale
 me with your brilliant advice, unless you're just another unthinking
 CHARLATAN!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Deck</span>
 I'm on the main deck of my ship---MY ship, not Dashing's. The deck is
 made of the finest, technologically advanced materials, and a tall
 railing runs around its perimeter. There is the reassuring sight of an
 ATOMIC REACTOR to port, and there are also smaller rooms fore and
 starboard. A gangway leads belowdecks.

 My rebellious horde of robots has clumped around me. They seem more
 anxious than aggressive, but they're completely blocking me in.

 I can also see an orange striped lever here.

>pull lever

 The lever doesn't budge. It can only be used in an EMERGENCY---a
 nuclear meltdown, for example.

>examine reactor

 My beautiful nuclear reactor, full of science and energy and
 RADIATION! The latter is no problem for me, of course, with my
 superhuman abilities. It powers the entire ship, allowing it to spend
 weeks at a time in the air.

>examine lever

 This emergency lever controls the ladder reaching up to the balloon.
 During normal operations, it's not usable. It's currently on.

>inventory

 I have your zeta-transmitter and my trusty laser gun. I'm also
 carrying:
     an atomic helmet (being worn)
     a jetpack (being worn)

>turn on jetpack

 The jetpack sputters but fails to start.

>examine helmet

 A sleek and streamlined creation of my own design, with ingenious
 padding to defend my cranium from peril, and an impermeable clear
 faceplate to protect me from the world! It emits a soft green glow to
 let me see in the dark, and to tell my foes that DIRK RADON, the
 UNIRRADIATABLE MAN, has come! It's as handsome as it is ATOMIC!

 The lever doesn't budge. It can only be used in an EMERGENCY---a
 nuclear meltdown, for example.


 There's almost a dozen of them in with me. I made them myself; I'm
 their CREATOR, for all the good it does me. They are big, metal, and
 impervious to danger. They've got me surrounded with my back to the
 wall, and they're big and fast enough that I can't squeeze through.
 They do not SEEM aggressive, and they're standing still and letting me
 talk to you. Yet they won't move aside!

>examine jetpack

 An atomic jetpack, from my own laboratory! No slave to gravity is DIRK
 RADON! I used it to fly up onto the airship. Unshielded, of course,
 but my natural immunity to radiation renders that irrelevant! It's not
 easy to steer, you know, and there's a minor collision from time to
 time, but that's what my ATOMIC HELMET is for! There's a button that
 turns it on in the back. The ATOMIC ENGINE inside needs an initial
 burst of energy to start up, and I've cunningly designed it to harness
 the POWER OF GRAVITY to charge. Falling from a significant height will
 provide enough energy to start the jetpack. Even someone with only TWO
 doctorates should know that.

>go down

 Curses! I can't break through the horde of robots. I'm the one who
 CREATED you, you villainous traitors! Let me through!


 Damnable robot! You can't threaten your CREATOR and get away with it!
 Take that!

 The robots look at me hesitantly. It's hard to tell from their blank
 expressions, but they seem to be becoming agitated.

>jump

 The railing is too high to jump over.

 The robots relax a bit. Their aggression subroutines must have timed
 out.


 I have your zeta-transmitter and my trusty laser gun. I'm also
 carrying:
     an atomic helmet (being worn)
     a jetpack (being worn)

>talk to robots

 They aren't something I can talk to.


 Impressive, isn't it? I designed it myself. It can produce a narrow
 beam of radiation that will destroy of any of my numerous enemies.

>shoot robot

 Damnable robot! You can't threaten your CREATOR and get away with it!
 Take that!

 The robots look at me hesitantly. It's hard to tell from their blank
 expressions, but they seem to be becoming agitated.

>again

 Blasted automaton! How dare you forsake me and follow that slimy moron
 Dashing? Take that!

 The robots look at me hesitantly. It's hard to tell from their blank
 expressions, but they seem to be becoming more agitated.

>again

 Ah, that did it. They've seized me by the arms and are taking me some
 place. Has Dashing programmed them to recognize my name? It's
 uncharacteristically clever of him if he did, but I wonder how he
 solved the storage constraints; these things can't handle so many
 routines at once.

 Wait, now I can see where they're taking me! They're hurling me off
 the railing! They've recategorized me as GARBAGE! The INDIGNITY!

 STOP! Nobody throws me out of an airship! I am DIRK RADON, the most
 brilliant scientific mind of his gener---ahhh!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Falling</span>
 I'm falling rapidly through the air toward the earth below. This would
 be a problem for most people, but I am PROFESSOR DIRK RADON! Gravity
 is just another area of SCIENCE I've conquered!

 All right, Owl, I'm plummeting toward the ground at an alarming rate.
 Time for you to earn your keep: What do I do now?

 The button on the jetpack begins glowing faintly.


 The jetpack sputters but fails to start.

 The button on the jetpack is glowing.

>push button

 The jetpack sputters but fails to start.

 Hurry up, Owl. Dirk Radon, PROFESSOR OF SCIENCE, is not a patient man.

 The button on the jetpack is flashing.

>push button

 Ah, yes! Spectacular! Professor Dirk Radon, the IRRADIATABLE MAN, is
 once again free from the constraints of gravity! The bleating mass of
 humanity said it couldn't be done, but once again I've proved them
 WRONG with my ATOMIC JETPACK. As enjoyable as it is to whoosh through
 the air, though, I have a mission to complete. Once I'm back on the
 airship and out of the clutches of my treacherous robots, I'll explain
 in a bit more detail. Let me gently land on the main deck...

 Excellent! Disregard the crash you may have heard, Owl; that was just
 me gently brushing up against a bookcase during my VICTORY DANCE on
 having accomplished such a perfect landing. And no, there is of course
 no bookcase on the main deck of the ship. Instead, I used my
 SPECTACULAR INTELLECT to reroute to a side room off the main deck
 because...well, to gain the element of surprise. My plan is running
 smoothly and COMPLETELY ACCORDING TO PLAN.

 Ah, yes, my plan. I'm sure you've been wondering, Owl, how a feckless
 idiot like Dashing could have such a technical marvel at his disposal.
 He didn't design or build it himself, of course; this is MY AIRSHIP.
 This is MY SHIP, MY ROBOTS, and MY NUCLEAR REACTOR. The last point is
 the most important one. Dashing stole my airship and has been trying
 to pass it off as its own, but that won't do him any good if it's
 destroyed in a FIERY NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. My plan is to sabotage the
 reactor and destroy the ship, then safely escape. That way, I can
 challenge him to rebuild it; it would be easy for him if he truly
 designed it in the first place. He didn't, of course, and I can expose
 his perfidy and incompetence when I rebuild my PERFECT AIRSHIP. Then
 the world will be laughing at the ridiculous "Captain" Dashing, and I
 will use my rebuilt ROBOT ARMY to crush him and then crush the WORLD!

 It is, of course, a perfect plan; now I just need to carry it out. As
 you undoubtedly know, I possess an uncanny immunity to radiation,
 which helps me immensely as a NUCLEAR SCIENTIST. My main ability,
 though is my amazing intelligence. I've been told, Owl, that you are
 the only person capable of matching my own staggering intellect. Let's
 see what you can do.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Control Room</span>
 I'm in the robot command area of the ship, its innermost cortex from
 which Dashing directs MY automata. Pfaugh! The lout! The
 electromechanical computation engine seems to be in recent repair,
 fortunately. Ah, and there's the bookshelf, where the technical
 manuals and programmer's notes are meant to be stored. The aft exit
 leads back to the main deck.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your fee has just gone up by $1 million.]</span>


 Does Dashing's arrogance know no bounds? He's stocked his bookshelf
 with cheap dime novels about his own adventures. As a SCIENTIFIC
 GENIUS, I had the foresight to stash a special item in the bookcase
 for emergencies such as this. I'm sure that idiot hasn't found it.


 Let me just see if---aha! I found the card. My INFALLIBLE memory
 triumphs again!


 This punch card contains the programming subroutines the automata use
 for their socialization algorithms. I printed it onto high-durability
 steel, so even Dashing can't ruin it.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Deck</span>
 I'm on the main deck of my ship---MY ship, not Dashing's. The deck is
 made of the finest, technologically advanced materials, and a tall
 railing runs around its perimeter. There is the reassuring sight of an

 through. I can return from the direction I came, but that's about it.


 My treacherous robot minions are blocking the gangway downward. I
 can't break past them.

 for inserting punch cards, and there's a glass box mounted on it to

 The computer beeps happily, and the card pops out again.


 A glass box, currently closed, with a big red button inside it.


 It doesn't budge. There's no chance of opening it while the

 I fire a few laser shots at the glass box, scorching it slightly but
 causing no significant damage.

 Now I stand in the master suite. A monument to OPULENCE and

 such as the world has never seen!" Mirrors line the walls and ceiling,
 drawing the eye to a magnificent painting of Rex Dashing! And the bed!
 It's ENORMOUS! As much as I hate Dashing, I have to admit that he's
 got style. The exit to port leads back to the main deck.

 On the bed are a scarf and a green book.

 Odd, I expected Dashing to be here. It's no matter; nowhere on the

 have scavenged throughout the world: hulking bears and moose from the

 menagerie of creatures even I barely recognize. While I obviously
 don't approve of his vicious little hobby, I have to admit that he at
 least has a healthy respect for nature.

 Exits lead north, west, and east (the last being through a heavy metal

 The robots have wandered off again, Owl. Let's continue. The God-Slug
 has to be somewhere on this ship. Dashing is presumably still here
 too, so let's be careful.


 That's not something I can open.


 A display case for that bullet-headed warmonger's weapons.

 Inside the display case are a cudgel, a harpoon, and a mace.


 A massive elephant, posed as if it's ready to charge. Although the
 lifelessness of the elephant detracts from its menace, the creature's
 size is still impressive.


 Frozen in place, the lions are more of a curiosity than a terror.
 Trust me, lions are terrifying in real life.


 Capital idea, Owl, but I'm afraid it wouldn't work. The unnatural
 chemicals used during the taxidermy process have made these animals
 totally unsuited to my power.

 The door is tremendously heavy. Even all the animals assembled here
 wouldn't be able to budge it.

 What a dreary conglomeration of stainless steel and Bakelite! There

 exit to the east.

 I can see a terrarium (which contains a gecko) and a metal enclosure
 (which is closed) here.


 It's a big one, about a foot long. Bright black eyes, green skin, tiny
 crawly feet. I could just eat it up.


 A rough metal cabinet, about the size of a bookcase. It's closed, but
 there's a narrow slot on the front of it.


 The cabinet has an oblong slot on it, about the size of a large

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Deck</span>
 This deck provides a spectacular panoramic view of the open sky. It
 would be enjoyable to watch the fluffy clouds darting past if I
 weren't on an important mission. Exits lead in east and west, and
 there is a mahogany door to the north. An ornate staircase leads down,
 and a more utilitarian gangway leads upward.

 I can see a klaxon here.


 This klaxon is attached to the ship's alarm system; fortunately, it's
 silent now. There's a small black button on the side of it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Communications Room</span>
 This room is little more than a closet. It's filled with a bewildering
 variety of electronics, which I vaguely recognize as being some sort
 of communications gear. A bulky microphone sits in front of the
 console. The exit out of this claustrophobic room is to the east.


 Presumably it's used for broadcasting with the radio equipment, but
 I'm not sure how it works.


 I only understood you as far as wanting to sing.


 Perhaps later. Right now, I have a mission to complete.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guest Suite</span>
 The airship's guest suite is bare and uninviting, possibly a ploy by
 Dashing to make his own room more appealing. There is a bed, of
 course, and a tacky rug is underfoot. The only exit is to the west.

 There is a small desk next to the bed.


 There are no cunningly concealed trapdoors underneath, though I
 suppose that sort of thing is passÃ© now.


 It's a flowery desk of the sort aristocrats often hide their valuables
 in. It has a single drawer.

 The ornate desk is closed.


 I can't see any such thing.


 It seems to be locked.


 I've got the zeta-transmitter your man gave me, concealed in a cameo
 I'm wearing around my neck. Beyond that...well, I've got my wits about
 me, at least; surely that's worth something?


 It's a mercifully plain bed.


 There is nothing on the bed.


 Done, but I didn't find anything of interest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gallery</span>
 This room is garishly appointed with the hunting trophies Dashing must
 have scavenged throughout the world: hulking bears and moose from the
 Americas, lions from Africa, elephants from the Orient, and a
 menagerie of creatures even I barely recognize. While I obviously
 don't approve of his vicious little hobby, I have to admit that he at
 least has a healthy respect for nature.

 Exits lead north, west, and east (the last being through a heavy metal
 door), and a spiral staircase elegantly winds upward.

 I can see a display case (which contains a cudgel, a harpoon, and a
 mace) here.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Laboratory</span>
 What a dreary conglomeration of stainless steel and Bakelite! There
 are enormous cabinets set into the walls, with a long metal counter on
 top. Most of the equipment here is sadly of the physical rather than
 life science variety, but I do recognize a terrarium here. There is an
 exit to the east.

 I can see a terrarium (which contains a gecko) and a metal enclosure
 (which is closed) here.


 (first taking the gecko)
 It skitters away, but I managed to grab hold of its tail---which just
 popped off! How delightful!


 Oh, very well. Give me a moment...

 That tasted a bit odd. My hands and feet feel sticky, and there's
 faint webbing on them. The rest of me feels lighter, too, though I
 don't suppose I look much different.

 I'm standing at the edge of a vast tank, above which a cage is
 suspended. Fortunately, I'm no longer in the cage. I know you're
 already aware of that fact; I just like repeating it. There is a
 prominent red button on the wall, and an exit leads south. There's
 also a trapdoor high overhead.

 All right, I'll climb up the walls with my gecko power. Good thing I'm
 still barefoot.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Opulent Room</span>
 I'm in a comfortable room with a long table flanked by opulent leather
 chairs. It looks like a corporate board room, though there are
 fortunately no cigar-chomping plutocrats in evidence. A mahogany door
 leads south, and there is a conspicuous trapdoor beneath the table.

 I can see a black bag (which is closed) here.


 All right, I've opened the black bag, revealing a set of lockpicks and
 a paper fan.

 Drat, I was hoping I had stashed some useful animal parts in here. My
 original plan had been to use the roast duck course at dinner to make
 my escape, so I didn't think it was necessary to smuggle anything else
 on board. It looks like we'll have to improvize to find a way off the
 ship.


 Taken.


 Which do you mean, the trapdoor or the austere mahogany door?

 harpoon: I say, these weapons are heavy! I'm already carrying the
 mace; it's too much to hold onto the harpoon as well.
 cudgel: I say, these weapons are heavy! I'm already carrying the mace;
 it's too much to hold onto the cudgel as well.

>examine mace

 A stout mace. Dashing doesn't seem the type to engage in hand-to-hand
 combat, though.


 The mace is too large to fit inside the black bag.


 That doesn't seem to be something I can unlock.


 My beloved bag! It's a black leather case I use to carry my thievery
 tools on missions such as this one. Dashing's robot goons took it from
 me when they imprisoned me in the cage.

 The black bag is open and contains a paper fan.


 A proper Victorian paper fan. When I first infiltrated the ship as a
 society darling, it was an integral part of my disguise; now it's just
 a decoration.


 (first opening the heavy metal door)
 The door is tremendously heavy. Even all the animals assembled here
 wouldn't be able to budge it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Captain's Bedroom</span>
 Now I stand in the master suite. A monument to OPULENCE and

 columns, gilt everywhere, and crimson walls that say, "Here sleeps one
 such as the world has never seen!" Mirrors line the walls and ceiling,
 drawing the eye to a magnificent painting of Rex Dashing! And the bed!
 It's ENORMOUS! As much as I hate Dashing, I have to admit that he's
 got style. The exit to port leads back to the main deck.


 I can't go that way.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Deck</span>
 I'm on the main deck of my ship---MY ship, not Dashing's. The deck is
 made of the finest, technologically advanced materials, and a tall
 railing runs around its perimeter. There is the reassuring sight of an
 ATOMIC REACTOR to port, and there are also smaller rooms fore and
 starboard. A gangway leads belowdecks.

 My robots are practicing their motion subroutines, which unfortunately
 takes the form of executing dance motions. It's undignified, but at
 least it prevents them from bothering me.

 I can also see an orange striped lever here.

 It appears to be locked.


 The lever doesn't budge. It can only be used in an EMERGENCY---a
 nuclear meltdown, for example.

 The beautiful open sky is around me here on the top deck of the ship.
 It's a pleasant setting; a high railing even protects me from most of
 the wind. The view is spoiled somewhat by a garish metal structure to
 the west, but there are smaller rooms to the north and east. A gangway
 leads down to the lower decks.

 There is a horde of robots here clunkily performing the latest dances
 from the American jazz clubs. At least they don't seem to notice me,
 or at least they're too absorbed in dancing to care about me.

 I can also see an orange striped lever here.

 What do you want to unlock the reinforced lead-lined door with?


 As I approach the reactor, the robots swarm around it, blocking me
 from getting any closer. It would appear that one artificial,
 mechanical abomination is protecting another.

 My stars, that's him! That's Dirk Radon! Have at you!

 Ha! That was easy. A simple kick to the sciatic nerve, a bit of quick
 strangulation, and he's gone down like that. There's one rotter who---

 electromechanical computation engine seems to be in recent repair,
 fortunately. Ah, and there's the bookshelf, where the technical
 manuals and programmer's notes are meant to be stored. The aft exit
 leads back to the main deck.

 The light bulbs around the computation engine are dim, and the
 protective glass box attached to the engine sits defenselessly open.

 I can also see an aquamarine punch card here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Deck</span>
 This deck provides a spectacular panoramic view of the open sky. It
 would be enjoyable to watch the fluffy clouds darting past if I
 weren't on an important mission. Exits lead in east and west, and
 there is a mahogany door to the north. An ornate staircase leads down,
 and a more utilitarian gangway leads upward.

 I can see a klaxon here.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gallery</span>
 This room is garishly appointed with the hunting trophies Dashing must
 have scavenged throughout the world: hulking bears and moose from the
 Americas, lions from Africa, elephants from the Orient, and a
 menagerie of creatures even I barely recognize. While I obviously
 don't approve of his vicious little hobby, I have to admit that he at
 least has a healthy respect for nature.

 Exits lead north, west, and east (the last being through a heavy metal
 door), and a spiral staircase elegantly winds upward.

 I can see a display case (which contains a cudgel and a harpoon) here.


 <span class="floydstyle em">You switch back to Dirk on line 2.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Control Room</span>
 I'm in the robot command area of the ship, its innermost cortex from
 which Dashing directs MY automata. Pfaugh! The lout! The
 electromechanical computation engine seems to be in recent repair,
 fortunately. Ah, and there's the bookshelf, where the technical
 manuals and programmer's notes are meant to be stored. The aft exit
 leads back to the main deck.

 The light bulbs around the computation engine are dim, and the
 protective glass box attached to the engine sits defenselessly open.

 I can also see an aquamarine punch card here.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Deck</span>
 I'm on the main deck of my ship---MY ship, not Dashing's. The deck is
 made of the finest, technologically advanced materials, and a tall
 railing runs around its perimeter. There is the reassuring sight of an
 ATOMIC REACTOR to port, and there are also smaller rooms fore and
 starboard. A gangway leads belowdecks.

 My deactivated robots are stationed around the deck.

 I can also see an orange striped lever here.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observation Deck</span>
 The middle deck of the ship is a vast open space surrounded glass
 windows. I intended to use it for astronomical research; I'm sure
 Dashing has been using it as a ballroom, or something similarly
 ridiculous. Exits lead port and starboard, and there is a mahogany
 door fore. A gangway and staircase connect this deck with the ones
 above and below, respectively.

 I can see a klaxon here.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Board Room</span>
 In designing the airship, I realized that in addition to numerous
 science laboratories, I would also need a command center from which to
 issue my nefarious directives. It has the standard amenities one would
 expect from a supervillain's lair: a long table surrounded by plush
 leather chairs, a trapdoor cunningly concealed in the floor, a secret
 compartment full of SECRETS, and a model of the Earth. A mahogany door
 leads aft.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Upper Deck</span>
 The beautiful open sky is around me here on the top deck of the ship.
 It's a pleasant setting; a high railing even protects me from most of
 the wind. The view is spoiled somewhat by a garish metal structure to
 the west, but there are smaller rooms to the north and east. A gangway
 leads down to the lower decks.

 Motionless robots litter the deck. Even deactivated, they're still
 imposing.

 I can also see an orange striped lever here.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Engine Room</span>
 I'm in a stuffy room with odd little lightbulbs all across the walls
 and a horrible clattering racket coming from every direction. There's
 a whopping great computation engine here, which I honestly wouldn't
 have known if it hadn't a prominent plaque announcing that fact on it.
 There are widgets and hoodads of various sorts most everyplace, and a
 big metal bookshelf.

 The exit from the room is to the south.

 The light bulbs around the computation engine are dim, and the
 protective glass box attached to the engine sits compellingly open.

 I can also see an aquamarine punch card here.


 That's too large to fit.


 Taken.


 The computer beeps angrily and spits out the card.


 Done. I hear a soft, ascending whirring from outside, as if a piece of
 machinery had just started up.


 I'll have to be holding the aquamarine punch card before I can put it
 into something else.


 Taken.

 There is a horde of robots here clunkily performing the latest dances
 from the American jazz clubs. At least they don't seem to notice me,
 or at least they're too absorbed in dancing to care about me.

 I can also see an orange striped lever here.


 As I approach the reactor, the robots swarm around it, blocking me
 from getting any closer. It would appear that one artificial,
 mechanical abomination is protecting another.


 The lever doesn't budge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Master Suite</span>
 I've found my way into Captain Dashing's bedroom. I suppose that's the
 dream of many a foolish young lady, isn't it?

 The ceiling is reflective, if you can believe such a thing, and the
 walls are done in the most tasteless mishmash of gilt Romanesque
 columns, gothic candelabras, and red velvet wallpaper you can possibly
 imagine. There are mirrors everywhere, and rather a grandiose portrait
 of the Captain himself hanging on one of the walls. The entire habitat
 is clearly calculated to overwhelm one's good sense until one cannot
 help but swoon onto the absurd contraption passing for a bed. An exit
 west leads back to the main deck of the airship.

 It's a globe, useful in my continuing plans for world domination.


 That's not something I can open.

 It never got off the drawing board, sadly.

 It used to be filled with my awards and accolades for SCIENTIFIC

 the world will soon feel my ATOMIC FURY once again, with your help.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Science Room</span>
 My wonderful LABORATORY! It's a beautiful expanse of steel and
 Bakelite, filled with the latest instruments for scientific research.
 Dashing has mercifully left it alone; no doubt it's far too advanced
 for the likes of him. He has left a terrarium on the counter here,
 though. I'm happy to stay here as long as you want, but there is an
 exit starboard.

 I can see a terrarium (which contains a gecko) and a metal enclosure
 (which is open and contains a large red lever) here.

 hasn't been maintaining it. I could quickly recalibrate the---no,

 the automata starting up again.


 This punch card contains the programming subroutines the automata use
 for their cold storage unsealing algorithms. I printed it onto
 high-durability steel, so even Dashing can't ruin it.


 I hear the sound of robots stomping belowdecks, then something heavy
 and metal being dragged across the floor, then robots stomping back
 abovedecks.

 At the center of this gloomy room is a vast aquarium with a cage

 tradition of using this room to gloat over my unfortunate captives; I
 grudgingly approve. There is a prominent red button on the wall, and
 an exit leads aft. There's also a trapdoor overhead.

 The octopus stirs as I start to leave, its tentacles seeping out of

 should think. There are little coils and tubes running all about, all
 of them covered with ice, and have I mentioned that it's cold as
 blazes in here? A few storage crates of provisions have been left
 haphazardly across the floor. The exit is through a heavy metal door
 to the west.

 I can see a vacuum flask (which is closed) here.


 I rifle through the crates but find nothing of use.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gallery</span>
 This room is garishly appointed with the hunting trophies Dashing must
 have scavenged throughout the world: hulking bears and moose from the
 Americas, lions from Africa, elephants from the Orient, and a
 menagerie of creatures even I barely recognize. While I obviously
 don't approve of his vicious little hobby, I have to admit that he at
 least has a healthy respect for nature.

 Exits lead north, west, and east (the last being through a heavy metal
 door), and a spiral staircase elegantly winds upward.

 I can see a display case (which contains a cudgel and a harpoon) here.


 Sure, let me...urgh, it's stuck. The flask must have frozen shut in
 the cold.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lower Deck</span>
 This deck provides a spectacular panoramic view of the open sky. It
 would be enjoyable to watch the fluffy clouds darting past if I
 weren't on an important mission. Exits lead in east and west, and
 there is a mahogany door to the north. An ornate staircase leads down,
 and a more utilitarian gangway leads upward.

 I can see a klaxon here.

 My animal power has subsided.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Science Room</span>
 My wonderful LABORATORY! It's a beautiful expanse of steel and
 Bakelite, filled with the latest instruments for scientific research.
 Dashing has mercifully left it alone; no doubt it's far too advanced
 for the likes of him. He has left a terrarium on the counter here,
 though. I'm happy to stay here as long as you want, but there is an
 exit starboard.

 I can see a terrarium (which contains a gecko) and a metal enclosure
 (which is open and contains a large red lever) here.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trophy Room</span>
 This room is filled with the trophies from Dashing's safaris
 throughout the world, or at least what he claims to be his trophies.
 It used to be filled with my awards and accolades for SCIENTIFIC
 BRILLIANCE, rather than the grubby souvenirs of a cretinous lout. But
 the world will soon feel my ATOMIC FURY once again, with your help.

 Exits lead fore, port, and starboard (the last through a heavy metal
 door), and a staircase leads up.

 I can see a vacuum flask (which is closed) and a display case (which

 Curses, it's stuck. The flask must have frozen shut in the cold.
 Dashing must have failed to maintain it properly; I'm sure something I
 designed would never have such an obvious flaw.

>shoot flask

 I fire a few laser shots at the vacuum flask, scorching it slightly
 but causing no significant damage. The ice caked around it doesn't
 show any signs of melting.

>take cudgel

 Taken.


 Blast it, Owl! I'm already carrying the cudgel; it's just too heavy.

>hit flask with cudgel

 I attack the dewar with my RIGHTEOUS SCIENTIFIC FURY, but it's still
 frozen over. I don't think this problem is one I can solve with brute
 force.

 Very well, I've put the cudgel into the display case.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Octopus Tank</span>
 At the center of this gloomy room is a vast aquarium with a cage
 suspended above it. It appears that Dashing has been keeping up my
 tradition of using this room to gloat over my unfortunate captives; I
 grudgingly approve. There is a prominent red button on the wall, and
 an exit leads aft. There's also a trapdoor overhead.

 I can see a steel cage here.

>push button

 The tank rumbles open.

>go south

 The octopus stirs as I start to leave, its tentacles seeping out of
 the tank toward me. It's not safe to leave while the octopus is still
 a threat.

 I fire a few laser shots at the blue button, scorching it slightly but
 causing no significant damage.

 Dashing's book? I've met the man in real life; his writing can't be
 any better. I am paying you to consult me, though, so I'll follow your
 advice. Here, under protest, is an excerpt from the book.

 <span class="floydstyle em">And I, the illustrious Captain Rex Dashing, bravely set out to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">fight the sludge monster! A lesser man might have blenched at such a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">foe, but not Rex Dashing! Years of bravely exploring the farthest</span>

 I give the flask a sound thrashing, but I don't succeed in dislodging
 the ice. It's frozen solid; brute force won't work.

>push button

 With a ponderous rumble, the tank opens again. The octopus would be a
 welcome sight under different circumstances; octopodes are so ugly
 they're almost cute.

>hit octopus with harpoon

 I've put up a good show knocking it around a bit, but I'm afraid I

 not to entertain it with children's stories. The communications

 throughout the world. This room should be just the place.

 narrower ambitions.

 It's a radio system, somehow intact despite Dashing's incompetence.
 It's currently off; closing the relay would cause it to start
 broadcasting.

 The relay is now on.

 matter or morals or squeamishness, you understand, but rather style.

>hit klaxon with harpoon

 I'd prefer to avoid violence unless absolutely necessary. It's not a
 matter or morals or squeamishness, you understand, but rather style.

>examine harpoon

 A harpoon with a cruelly sharp tip.

>examine klaxon

 This klaxon is attached to the ship's alarm system; fortunately, it's
 silent now. There's a small black button on the side of it.

>detach klaxon

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>search it

 I don't find anything of interest.

>open klaxon

 That's not something I can open.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gallery</span>
 This room is garishly appointed with the hunting trophies Dashing must
 have scavenged throughout the world: hulking bears and moose from the
 Americas, lions from Africa, elephants from the Orient, and a
 menagerie of creatures even I barely recognize. While I obviously
 don't approve of his vicious little hobby, I have to admit that he at
 least has a healthy respect for nature.

 Exits lead north, west, and east (the last being through a heavy metal
 door), and a spiral staircase elegantly winds upward.

 I can see a green book and a display case (which contains a mace and a
 cudgel) here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Radio Room</span>
 I'm in the radio room, where Rex Dashing stammers out insipid,
 exaggerated tales of his "adventures" to a doting populace. I designed
 this room to broadcast my insight and demands to the captive world,
 not to entertain it with children's stories. The communications
 equipment looks to have escaped the worst of Dashing's SCIENTIFIC
 INCOMPETENCE, fortunately. The exit back to the lower deck is to
 starboard.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Observation Deck</span>
 The middle deck of the ship is a vast open space surrounded glass
 windows. I intended to use it for astronomical research; I'm sure
 Dashing has been using it as a ballroom, or something similarly
 ridiculous. Exits lead port and starboard, and there is a mahogany
 door fore. A gangway and staircase connect this deck with the ones
 above and below, respectively.

 I can see a klaxon here.


 It's a klaxon, mercifully silent for now. There's a small black button
 on the side of it.

>hold button

 That seems to be part of the klaxon.


 Click.

>pull button

 It is fixed in place.

>examine button

 This button is the override for the klaxon, allowing someone---namely,
 ME---to shut off the alarm. I don't want my research interrupted every
 time a robot trips an alarm.

 Motionless robots litter the deck. Even deactivated, they're still
 imposing.

 I can also see a vacuum flask (which is closed) and an orange striped

 Done. That sound you hear in the background, Owl, is an alarm going
 off. I trust you have something in mind; I'm not going to be useful as
 a sneak-thief if I can't sneak around.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[Your zeta-wave transmitter system abruptly switches to line</span>

 run up to the main deck and take a look at the reactor.

 YOUR TIME HAS COME!

 Ow! Well, that didn't go as I expected. You've picked up some tricks
 in the Far East, have you? Well, I'll have you know, I'm on the line
 with the Owl, and so I'm sure I'll have a stratagem to dispatch you AT
 ANY MOMENT.

 Well, that's got her angry. Hey, what should I do here? She's pulled
 her jewelry off her neck and eaten it. Wait, was that ivory? This
 helmet may be ATOMIC, but it's not elephant-proof!

 <span class="floydstyle em">You hear an impressive bout of crunching and screaming. After a</span>

 Dashing has been using it as a ballroom, or something similarly
 ridiculous. Exits lead port and starboard, and there is a mahogany
 door fore. A gangway and staircase connect this deck with the ones
 above and below, respectively.

 I can see a set of lockpicks and a klaxon here.

 Hmm, I'm not sure what to make of them. Thievery is, after all,
 beneath my dignity as a brilliant scientist and infamous supervillain.

 I'm on the main deck of my ship---MY ship, not Dashing's. The deck is

 menagerie of creatures even I barely recognize. While I obviously
 don't approve of his vicious little hobby, I have to admit that he at

 this room to broadcast my insight and demands to the captive world,
 not to entertain it with children's stories. The communications

 It's a radio system, somehow intact despite Dashing's incompetence.

 whirring inside. Being here makes me long for being under the
 wide-open skies on the main deck of the airship, or even in the
 octopus tank again.

 There is a passage leading deeper into the reactor to the north, as
 well as a much more inviting exit east.

 A hideous, burbling monster made of slime and ichor blocks the way
 further inside.


 It's a ghastly thing, like a great roiling mass of slime and ichor. It
 looks like something out of a penny dreadful.

 There is a passage fore leading deeper into the reactor, as well as a
 much less inviting exit starboard.

 A disgusting sludge monster blocks the way further inside.


 It's one of those ugly things you get growing sometimes when you don't
 remember to keep the vermin away from the mutagens. If you haven't
 seen one, it looks like a big iridescent amoeba, and smells like a
 backed-up lab sink. It's bubbling quietly to itself for the moment,
 but these things have a temper.


 The slime monster is blocking the way. But it's only a temporary
 impediment to the forward march of SCIENCE, and also me.

 I've found my way into Captain Dashing's bedroom. I suppose that's the

 The ceiling is reflective, if you can believe such a thing, and the

 imagine. There are mirrors everywhere, and rather a grandiose portrait
 of the Captain himself hanging on one of the walls. The entire habitat
 is clearly calculated to overwhelm one's good sense until one cannot
 help but swoon onto the absurd contraption passing for a bed. An exit
 west leads back to the main deck of the airship.


 Very well, if you insist. Here, under protest, is an excerpt from the
 book.

 <span class="floydstyle em">And I, the illustrious Captain Rex Dashing, bravely set out to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">fight the sludge monster! A lesser man might have blenched at such a</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">monster with it! Even though shooting or bludgeoning was ineffective</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">against the monster, the sharp point of the spear cut through its</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">slimy hide like paper! When I returned to the ship, the unspoiled</span>

 pieces, which have oozed into the floor. Mostly, anyway; there's a bit
 of residue congealing on the ground. I also seem to have suffered a
 slight cut---from the aggressive monster, of course, and not from
 carelessly nicking myself on the spear. Ah, well; the bloodstain will
 serve as a reminder to my foes that I'm willing to risk ANYTHING to
 advance the cause of science.

 encouragingly as ATOMIC POWER courses through it. It will be a shame
 to destroy something so beautiful, but nothing will stand between me
 and my revenge on Dashing. The pool could use a good scrub, but at
 least the control rods are still intact. The exit from the reactor is

 Urgh, that was certainly foul. My skin has become more blubbery and

 I can take quite a bit more of a punch now.

 I'm sorry, Owl, but I'm not feeling up to continuing. I feel hot all

 imagine. There are mirrors everywhere, and rather a grandiose portrait
 of the Captain himself hanging on one of the walls. The entire habitat
