 The smell of cotton candy, warm lemonade, and grass induces an
 exciting sort of nausea in your stomach. This year (finally!), your
 parents have decided that you're old enough to wander the midway of
 the Avogadro County Fair without adult supervision. After sitting
 through the mandatory safety lecture (a small price to pay for being
 spared the Hall of Farming Implements), you are sent off to fend for
 yourself for two glorious hours.

 Immediately spending three-quarters of your allotted dollar on a corn
 dog, you find yourself curiously drawn by the necessities of the plot
 to a brightly lit carnival booth that invites you to...

 Verb Guessing Booth
 The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
 play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
 Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
 broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
 all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
 carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the
 booth to the southeast.

 A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
 each of its five equally-sized divisions labeled with a single word:
 SCRUTINIZE, RECONFIGURE, FASTEN, DISEMBARK, and UNDO.

 As your fleshy eye momentarily catches Lalrry's roving, metallic one,
 you suddenly become his most important (not to mention only) potential
 customer. Lights flash on his status panel as he loads a new pitch
 into extended memory.

 "Hello, little boy or girl!", bellows Lalrry in the alarming tone used
 by adults who are trying to be friendly. "Wait a minute... are you a
 boy or a girl? Are you a BOY or a GIRL?"

>girl

 "And what's your name, little girl?"

>Isqui

 "Well Isqui would you like to GUESS THE VERB!?!?! Just one shiny
 quarter gets you a spin of the wheel! And you can GUESS THE VERB for
 fun and prizes!"

 His pitch delivered, Lalrry switches back to broadcast mode and begins
 his old banter with an occasional hopeful glance in your direction.

>examine lalrry
 The parser looks much the way Peter Norton would look if Peter Norton
 were made of stainless steel and had, instead of a head, an Ethernet
 hub with two small surveillance cameras attached on top and a speaker
 attached underneath. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the parser
 is wearing a shirt and a tie.

 He's also wearing a straw hat and a nametag that says "Hello! My name
 is LALRRY." A series of lights in his forehead monitor the traffic
 that flows through an Ethernet cable plugged into where Peter Norton's
 left cheek would be, which cable disappears down into the booth.

 As a natural language parser, Lalrry can deal with a reasonable subset
 of some human language (English, in his case), through some
 combination of recursive grammars and ad-hoc tricks. Most such parsers
 were created in the 1980s to answer queries and to help people find
 treasures and kill trolls. Nowadays, most parsers are working at Web
 start-ups. The fact that Lalrry is working as a carnival barker does
 not say much for his language handling capabilities.

 "Step right up, step right up!", says Lalrry with perfectly
 synthesized heartiness.

>examine wheel
 A sort of rotating pie chart, the wheel of fortune is about four feet
 in diameter and attached to a frame which, in turn, is bolted to the
 side of the booth. A plastic red arrow suspended over the top of the
 wheel indicates one of the five verbs at random (currently
 SCRUTINIZE), and will do so again when Lalrry spins the wheel. The
 verbs currently on the pie chart are SCRUTINIZE, RECONFIGURE, FASTEN,
 DISEMBARK, and UNDO, each taking up an equal slice of the pie.

 "It's time to GUESS THE VERB!", declares Lalrry, although he offers no
 evidence to back this up.

>examine me
 You are a perfectly normal eleven-year-old girl, not yet aware of
 anything more interesting than video games or dinosaurs.

 "One shiny quarter gets you a spin of the wheel!"

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a tarnished quarter
   a corn dog
   your identity bracelet (being worn)

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a tarnished quarter
   a corn dog
   your identity bracelet (being worn)

>eat quarter
 That's plainly lacking the "edible" flag.

 Lalrry briefly pulls you aside. "The crowned heads of Europe have
 guessed verbs at my booth," he says confidentially. "The Queen Mum was
 quite keen on PARTITION, although the King of France would hear of
 nothing but JUMP--SAUTER, rather, I should say." Somehow you doubt
 this.

>examine bracelet
 A white plastic embarassment which your parents make you wear on those
 rare occasions on which you are allowed off on your own. In little red
 letters just above your wrist, it says "My name is _ISQUI_. In case of
 emergency, call my mother's cell phone at (210) 603-3999."

 Lalrry briefly pulls you aside. "The crowned heads of Europe have
 guessed verbs at my booth," he says confidentially. "The Queen Mum was
 quite keen on PARTITION, although the King of France would hear of
 nothing but JUMP--SAUTER, rather, I should say." Somehow you doubt
 this.

>give quarter to lalrry
 Lalrry takes the quarter and scrutinizes it carefully. "Sorry, Isqui,"
 he says, handing the coin back to you. "This is not a shiny quarter."

 Behind the Booths
 You are in a shadowy alcove, surrounded by the canvas backs of several
 carnival booths. The music and bustle of the midway seems very far
 away, and a harvest moon illuminates the wet grass of the fairgrounds
 and the makeshift walls that surround you.

 The glinting tip of a small metal box peeks out from beneath the verb
 guessing booth.

>examine box
 The metal box is about the size of a deck of cards and is decorated
 with black plastic trim. An LED and two switches (one orange, the
 other blue) are mounted on the front of the box, and a cord runs from
 either end up into the booth.

 The LED is currently glowing green. Both switches are in the on
 position.

>examine moon
 The light from the harvest moon seems magical tonight. If Neil Young
 were here, he would undoubtedly write a song about it.

>open box
 That's not something you can open.

>get moon
 You are insane.

>press orange switch
 It is fixed in place.

>examine cord
 The cords run from either end of a metal box up into the booth.

>clean quarter
 Your valiant attempt fails to noticeably improve the quarter's looks.

>turn off orange switch
 You switch the orange switch off.

 The Midway
 The lights and noise of the midway seem hollow and dull compared to
 the aura of excitement you felt at the verb guessing booth. You survey
 the sights around you as though through different eyes: the
 merry-go-round, the concession stand--they seem so pedestrian now. You
 feel a strange attraction pulling you back towards the southwest, as
 though a ham-handed author were trying to place hints into the room
 description that the game would progress a lot faster if you went back
 to the verb guessing booth already.

 If you really want to, though, you can go east to rejoin your parents
 and end the game.

 You can't help but notice a small but obtrusive quarter shining
 machine squatting here.

>examine machine
 The quarter shining machine sits in the middle of a line of similar
 machines which accept coins of smaller denomination, like pennies, and
 do more interesting things to them, like smush them up and imprint
 them with touristy slogans. In the face of such intense competition,
 the quarter shining machine has taken to mimicry, hoping to trap
 unsuspecting coins intended for a less boring (if also less shiny)
 fate in another machine.

 Its innards are exposed, an unnecessarily complicated mesh of shiny
 gears and pistons. A prominent notice on the side of the machine
 assures you with alarming urgency that the practice of quarter-shining
 is legal under federal statute BH-2510958. The coin tray has two
 quarter-shaped slots; the left one to contain payment and the right to
 contain the quarter you want shined and dropped into the receptacle
 near the bottom of the machine.

 The left coin slot is empty. The right coin slot is also empty. The
 receptacle is also also empty.

>examine left slot
 A small, round slot in the coin tray. It would just hold a quarter.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a tarnished quarter
   a corn dog
   your identity bracelet (being worn)

>examine corn dog
 The corn dog is a curious creature. Its life cycle begins when the
 larval corn dog is cooked and put on a stick. The corn dog is dipped
 in batter to form a cocoon and fried. Inside the batter cocoon, the
 baby corn dog metamorphoses into an adult phase which is then
 purchased, slathered with mustard, and eaten. The rumbling of your
 stomach tells you that the end is near for this particular corn dog.
 We will miss you, corn dog.

>eat corn dog
 My, that was a yummy corn dog!

>kick machine
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>push machine
 It is fixed in place.

 The Guess the Verb booth is small and liberally stocked with stuffed
 animals, gewgaws, jimcracks, heehaws, and spistacks, all intended as
 prizes for successful guessers of the verb. A large wheel with five
 divisions dominates the center of the booth, and it is to this wheel
 that your friend the parser gestures quite emphatically. One might
 even say spastically. "Spastically." There, I said it.

 That's not a verb I recognize.

 Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,

 "It's time to GUESS THE VERB!", declares Lalrry, although he offers no
 evidence to back this up.

>give quarter to lalrry
 Lalrry gladly takes the quarter from your outstretched palm. With the
 flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and catches it in his
 shirt pocket. Stepping back, he indicates the wheel.

 [To guess a verb, use "GUESS [verb]"; for example, "GUESS DISLIKE"]

 "Guess a verb, verb!", says Lalrry, indicating the wheel of fortune.

>guess disambiguate
 "Sorry, that's not on the wheel!"

 "Guess a verb, verb!", says Lalrry, indicating the wheel of fortune.

>guess reconfigure
 "Hey, guess! And so I spin the wheel..."

 Lalrry gives the wheel a good push and it begins rapidly rotating,
 spinning faster now, now slowly winding down until it...stops...on...

                   FASTEN

 Lalrry shrugs and says "Luck next time!"

 You shrug too, and try to look nonchalant, but you feel a hollowness
 in the pit in your stomach which is something more than simple
 disappointment. The lights of the midway seem uncomfortably close, the
 music incessant and loud. You wonder if you aren't coming down with
 something, and blink to clear the glare from your eyes.

 Suddenly you are falling.

 You claw at the air, then at the unidentifiable blurs that race past
 you, then at your own body, which is unaccountably absent from this
 mad scene. You open your hypothetical mouth and emit a potential
 scream which never quite materializes, and then with the feeling of
 suddenly waking up from a nightmare, you are somewhere else.

 And a little dwarf is in the room with you.

 **********************************************************************
 **********

 He's relatively young, as dwarves go; only about a hundred or so. At
 first he starts, surprised to meet a human one-on-one, but he quickly
 remembers his manners, and, doffing his miner's helmet, bows low.
 "Duran son of Czadhan, at your service."

 You return the bow to the extent your heavy sack will allow. "Isqui,
 at yours."

 "By the load you bear," says he, indicating his own bulging backpack,
 "I see the factors that brought me to scenic Wyrmsworth Caverns have
 been at work upon you as well."

 "Love of the underground realms," you reply.

 Duran nods, and, with a twinkle in his eye, acknowledges the one
 strongest commonality, so often unstated, between human and dwarf.

 "And greed."

 Slate Room
 The floor of this room is covered with shattered pieces of slate,
 peeled off from the ceiling above. The glow of your lantern is
 swallowed up by the dark material of which the ceiling, floor, and
 walls are made. There is a wide, rounded portal to the northwest, a
 narrower entrance to the south, and a passage to the north which opens
 up after a little way.

 Duran the dwarf stands beside you.

 "Nice brass."

 "Fairly low-grade slate."

>ask duran about orthoclase
 There is no reply.

 Duran rests his hand momentarily on the haft of his axe.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a wristwatch with compass (being worn)
   a canister of vintage celluloid
   a copy of the Clamshell Book
   a Sack of Infinite Capacity (which is open)
     a jade idol
     the McGuffin
   a brass lantern (providing light)

>examine wristwatch
 A combination wristwatch and compass, indispensable for any
 adventurer. The current time is 184.50 AST.

>examine canister
 A canister of celluloid, labeled "Nov. 1921 - B. Keaton." Not the sort
 of treasure one normally expects to find in a cave, but valuable
 nonetheless.

>examine copy
 A white book with a blue spine, entitled "Dungeon Exploration".
 There's a picture of a giant clamshell on the cover, thus the
 nickname. Flipping through the book brings nothing to your eye that
 seems relevant to your current situation.

 You hear echoing voices from the north.

>examine sack
 The Sack of Infinite Capacity is truly a wondrous device. No matter
 how many things you put into it, it never fills or becomes too heavy
 to carry. The depressing thing is that this makes the sack much more
 valuable than just about anything you might find to put in it.

 You hear echoing voices from the north.

>examine idol
 A jade idol of a great and terrible god, probably once an integral
 part of some ritual ceremony. Oh well, defilement is all in a day's
 work!

 You hear echoing voices from the north.

>examine mcguffin
 It seems to shift under your gaze--now an ankh-shaped amulet, now the
 deed to an orphanage, now a piece of futuristic machinery. In another
 world, perhaps, this item would complete your quest. Now, however, it
 is merely one of many treasures you wish to find.

 A group of tourists, led by a trollish guide, enters from the north.

 Duran strokes his beard a moment in thought.

>examine tourists
 A group of fat, belching tourists congregates around a frazzled
 trollish tour guide who reluctantly explains the wonders of
 treasure-laden Wyrmsworth Caverns. Most of the tourists are dwarves or
 orcs, and each appears to have won his or her local Loudest Hawaiian
 Shirt competition before moving on to the regionals here in the cave.

 "The slate room, here, was once a mine which provided much of the
 state's slate, from 1941 until the cave complex was made a national
 park in 1973."

>examine troll
 A young bleary-eyed troll points out interesting formations to the
 spellbound tourists, occasionally dropping hints relating to the
 wondrous treasures to be found in the Wyrmsworth complex. His
 flip-flop sandals slap against the cave floor as he walks slowly
 backwards, gesturing and pointing.

 A dwarvish child trips over a thick slab of slate, skinning her knees.
 The guide and the child's parents help her up and dust her off.

 "Um, to the northwest, here," says the guide, "we have one of the most
 spectacular sights to grace Wyrmsworth Caverns."

>wait
 Time passes.

 The tour leaves to the northwest.

 "Tourists!" Duran snorts derisively, lowering his voice. "They come to
 the caverns and what do they do? They take pictures! I don't know why
 the cave trolls put up with it. These orcs and Southern dwarves know
 nothing of a good adventure."

>go northwest

 Geode Room
 The large quartz crystals that cover the rounded walls of this small
 room give you the feeling of being inside an oversized geode. The
 lamplight reflects, and reflects, and reflects again from the
 glittering display that surrounds you. The crystals are clear near the
 ceiling at the far end of the room, but gradually take on a purplish
 sheen towards the exit to the southeast.

 A group of tourists sloughs its way through the caverns.

 "This is what we call the 'geode room', because it resembles the
 inside of a geode. It's not really a geode, though. The quartzite
 crystals are part of a quartz vein that runs through this area, and
 were caused by dwaeomer-oxidization as this whole section of rock was
 undergoing magical erosion about twenty thousand years ago."

 Duran whistles appreciatively at the crystals, even though they are
 valueless quartz. Apparently dwarves can appreciate beauty even
 unalloyed by riches.

 Myriad glittering crystals cover the walls and ceiling of this room.
 An awesome sight.

 "I'd like to point out that the stunning beauty of the geode room is
 reminiscent of the great riches that are hidden within Wyrmsworth,
 waiting to be discovered by intrepid adventurers. In fact, as recently
 as 1996, a diamond the size of a cockatoo's egg was found near here."
 The guide pauses, searching his audience for signs of interest.

 "The Cockatoo's Egg Diamond is a flawless blue diamond, considered
 priceless by many," says the guide. "It's indicative of the many
 treasures still to be found in the caves." He gives you a theatrical
 wink.

 "Well," says the guide. "This is just about the halfway point on our
 tour... follow me, please."

>wait
 Time passes.

 The tour leaves to the southeast.

>se

 Slate Room
 The floor of this room is covered with shattered pieces of slate,
 peeled off from the ceiling above. The glow of your lantern is
 swallowed up by the dark material of which the ceiling, floor, and
 walls are made. There is a wide, rounded portal to the northwest, a
 narrower entrance to the south, and a passage to the north which opens
 up after a little way.

 A group of tourists sloughs its way through the caverns.

 "Will we be seeing any stalagmites on this tour?", asks an elderly
 orc.

 Duran follows you.

 "Those form on the cave floor."

 "Yes, of course," says the guide. "After all, what would a cave tour
 be without stalagmites? Actually, we're on our way to the stalagmites
 right now, if you'll just follow me up this slope." The guide glances
 behind him, not anxious to trip over a chunk of slate as he walks.

>take slate
 The slate stains your fingers, and is insufficiently valuable to carry
 around anyway.

 The tour leaves to the south.

>go south

 Under the Bridge
 You are in a chasm, studded with stalagmites, running from the north
 to the southeast. A swaying rope bridge runs from west to east, far
 above your head.

 A group of tourists sloughs its way through the caverns.

 "Here are, uh, the stalagmites," says the guide, waving in their
 direction. "These were formed by gradual accretion of--"

 "Excuse me," says an elf, pointing a delicate finger toward a
 stalagmite nearly as tall and thin as she is, "I thought these were
 stalactites, these on the bottom."

 Duran follows you.

>examine slalagmites
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine stalagmites
 Which do you mean, the nondescript stalagmites or Stalagmite 13?

>13
 A particularly large stalagmite. Apart from its size and the crude
 "13" carved into it, it is unremarkable.

 "No, that's a common misconception," says the troll. "Stalactites are
 formations that accrete from the ceiling. Stalagmites are those that
 accrete on the cave floor, such as this one, Stalagmite 13."

 "No one knows the real meaning of the carving. Or if they do, they're
 not telling."

 "This chasm we're in extends a little to the south," says the guide,
 pointing down the narrowing gulf. "Er, southeast, I suppose. But we'd
 never all fit down there, so this is as far as we'll go there. We'll
 start making our way back to the stairs, now."

>examine bridge
 Made of ropes and wood, the bridge sways high above your head.

 The tour leaves to the north.

>se

 Chasm End
 The chasm ends here, its walls narrowing to nothing. You can only
 proceed back to the northwest.

 There are rare stamps here!

 Duran follows you.

>take stamps
 Taken.

>examine stamps
 Misprints, first-day covers, you name it.

 Duran takes a lump of coal out of his pocket and offers you a piece.
 When you decline, he shrugs and bites into it, chewing with gusto.

>go northwest

 Under the Bridge
 You are in a chasm, studded with stalagmites, running from the north
 to the southeast. A swaying rope bridge runs from west to east, far

 Duran follows you.

>go north

 Huge Room
 This room is so large, it makes you claustrophobic. You cannot help
 but think how far underground you must be, that a cave ceiling might
 be so impossibly high without opening to blue sky. The tremendous mass
 of empty air above you seems to press harder than mere rock ever
 could. But you cannot look away, for running down the walls are
 breathtaking waterfalls of stone, enormous calcite formations that
 seem to have been formed from the discarded candles of a million
 million visitors. Sloping arches form stone awnings over paths to the
 south and northeast, and a tight crawl leads west.

 You hear echoing voices from the northeast.

 As Duran enters the room, he lets out a chuckling roar. "By the
 gods!", he murmurs. "This splendid room would make a dining hall
 worthy of the dwarves of old!"

>go northeast

 Winding Stairway
 A winding stairway reaches up into the blackness here. Another natural
 chimney; about a hundred feet up, it opens up to a large room to the
 southwest (accessible to you through an arch). Far above you, you can
 hear the sounds of someone, as yet invisible, slowly rappeling down.

 A group of tourists sloughs its way through the caverns.

 As the old tour group begins to disappear into the darkness above, the
 new guide clears his throat, preparing to begin his tour.

 Duran follows you.

>go up
 You and Duran climb the stairway for several minutes, but seem no
 closer to the cave exit than before. Winded, the two of you rest a
 while and come back down.

 "Okay," says the new guide, "here we are near the winding stair, where
 our tour of the lower levels will begin and end -- should take about
 thirty turns."

 Duran rests his hand momentarily on the haft of his axe.

>go southwest

 Huge Room
 This room is so large, it makes you claustrophobic. You cannot help

 You hear echoing voices from the northeast.

 Duran follows you.

>go west

 East-West Crawl
 A stooped, gravely crawl that tightens to the west. The sloping tunnel
 at the west end would be impassable for an adult, but a determined
 eleven-year-old should be able to squeeze through it. (What luck! You
 happen to be a determined eleven-year-old!) Even if you weren't, you'd
 still be able to back out to the east, where the crawl abruptly opens
 up into a much larger room.

 There is a bowling trophy here!

 Duran follows you.

>take bowling trophy
 (putting the rare stamps into the Sack of Infinite Capacity to make
 room)
 (putting the canister of vintage celluloid into the Sack of Infinite
 Capacity to make room)
 (putting the copy of the Clamshell Book into the Sack of Infinite
 Capacity to make room)
 (taking the rare stamps back out of the Sack of Infinite Capacity
 because we didn't really need that much room after all)
 (taking the canister of vintage celluloid back out of the Sack of
 Infinite Capacity because we didn't really need that much room after
 all)
 Taken.

>go west
 You and Duran scramble through a short crawl, and find yourselves...

 On The Ledge
 Few people ever visit this subterranean clifftop, since few can get
 here in the first place--the wandering children of tourists, perhaps,
 or of the trolls who inhabit these caves. Hopefully, none are too
 young to know that those who play too close to the edges of cliffs
 inevitably end up as object lessons to others.

 About thirty feet below, your light glints off metal. There's no way
 down there, though; only east into a tight crawl.

 A rusted iron hook protrudes from the wall above the cliff.

 Duran leans over the ledge, shining his headlamp into the murky
 darkness below. "Gold!" he exclaims, rubbing his hands together.
 "Thousands of points worth!"

 The dwarf pulls a coil of rope from his backpack. "I knew this would
 come in handy," he says, hefting the coil in his hands.

>examine hook
 Oddly enough, this hook is a completely natural iron precipitation.
 Although rusty, its fusion to the rock wall stands any test of
 strength you can think to apply to it.

 "Perfect!", says Duran, spotting the iron hook and gauging the
 distance between it and the cliff bottom. "I'll just tie rope to hook,
 here..." Hastily tying a loop into one end of the rope, Duran slips it
 over the hook and begins to tighten the knot.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Duran peers at the rope in his hands, which has inexplicably slipped
 off the hook and become untied. "That's odd..." Retying the knot,
 Duran mutters the incantation "Tie rope to hook!"

>wait
 Time passes.

 Again Duran finds himself holding an untied knot. "Okay, let's try
 another one," he mutters. "Put rope on hook!"

>wait
 Time passes.

 Duran looks dismayed, and pokes at his ill-behaved rope. "That's
 always worked before," he mutters, "so there can't be anything wrong
 with the rope. Don't worry, I'll figure it out."

>fasten rope to hook
 Duran shrugs and hands you the rope. You quickly tie a rudimentary
 knot and loop it over the hook. Amazingly, the knot holds!

 "Astounding!" exclaims Duran. "'Fasten'--who would have thought?"

 Duran gestures at the rope.

>climb rope
 You shimmy down the rope, Duran following you...

 Bottom of Cliff
 A cliff looms above you, here; you can ascend via a rope that dangles
 before you, or follow the pebbled path of an ancient and long dry
 waterway to the north or the southeast.

 There are many gold bars here!

 Duran drops off the rope and struts around, admiring the piles of
 gold. "Fabulous!", he exclaims, shaking your hand and insinuating a
 gold bar into your pack. "We make quite a team!" Excited, the young
 dwarf begins to sort the bars into two piles, but when he looks up,
 you are gone...

 Verb Guessing Booth
 The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
 play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
 Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
 broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
 all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
 carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the
 booth to the southeast.

 A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
 each of its four equally-sized divisions labeled with a single word:
 SCRUTINIZE, RECONFIGURE, DISEMBARK, and UNDO.

 You are carrying:
   a candy bar
   a shiny trophy
   your identity bracelet (being worn)

>examine candy bar
 A sugar-packed Buttertonsils bar, in its characteristic golden
 wrapper. You're not sure how you got ahold of it, but they're not bad.

>examine trophy
 A dented but shiny bowling trophy of bronze. Inscribed on the base are
 the words, "LEAGUE CHAMPIONS 1992".

 "You earned that trophy, you should keep it," says Lalrry.

 The candy bar slides down your throat, and your stomach quickly is
 full.

 The Midway
 The lights and noise of the midway seem hollow and dull compared to
 the aura of excitement you felt at the verb guessing booth. You survey
 the sights around you as though through different eyes: the
 merry-go-round, the concession stand--they seem so pedestrian now. You
 feel a strange attraction pulling you back towards the southwest, as
 though a ham-handed author were trying to place hints into the room
 description that the game would progress a lot faster if you went back
 to the verb guessing booth already.

 If you really want to, though, you can go east to rejoin your parents
 and end the game.

 You can't help but notice a small but obtrusive quarter shining
 machine squatting here.

>dance
 You perform a little jig. The producers of Riverdance won't be calling
 you anytime soon.

>sing
 Your singing is abominable.

>take quarter
 You can't see any such thing.

>caper
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine machine
 The quarter shining machine sits in the middle of a line of similar
 machines which accept coins of smaller denomination, like pennies, and
 do more interesting things to them, like smush them up and imprint
 them with touristy slogans. In the face of such intense competition,
 the quarter shining machine has taken to mimicry, hoping to trap
 unsuspecting coins intended for a less boring (if also less shiny)
 fate in another machine.

 Its innards are exposed, an unnecessarily complicated mesh of shiny
 gears and pistons. A prominent notice on the side of the machine
 assures you with alarming urgency that the practice of quarter-shining
 is legal under federal statute BH-2510958. The coin tray has two
 quarter-shaped slots; the left one to contain payment and the right to
 contain the quarter you want shined and dropped into the receptacle
 near the bottom of the machine.

 The left coin slot is empty. The right coin slot is also empty. The
 receptacle is also also empty.

>kick machine
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>shake machine
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 In the quarter shining machine are a small receptacle, a coin tray, a

 A white plastic embarassment which your parents make you wear on those
 rare occasions on which you are allowed off on your own. In little red
 letters just above your wrist, it says "My name is _ISQUI_. In case of

 Behind the Booths
 You are in a shadowy alcove, surrounded by the canvas backs of several
 carnival booths. The music and bustle of the midway seems very far
 away, and a harvest moon illuminates the wet grass of the fairgrounds
 and the makeshift walls that surround you.

 The glinting tip of a small metal box peeks out from beneath the verb
 guessing booth.

 "Sorry!", says Lalrry with a shrug. "Better luck next!"

 You close your eyes and brace yourself for the fall you feel is
 inevitable. It isn't until your body fades away, leaving your
 consciousness without any eyelids to shield it, that you realize that
 you have been falling for quite a while. Before you have time to get
 properly panicked again, though, you are somewhere else.

 CSUA Lounge
 The UCLA Computer Science student lounge is a hacker's paradise: a
 line of Linux machines and X terminals runs parallel to the south and
 west wall, ending in a Windows machine and an old Macintosh (for
 contrarians) in the northwest corner. A couch makes the environment
 conducive to overnighters and software design bull sessions. The exit
 is to the east.

 Four computer geeks are here; Fred, Mark, Dan, and Leonard, by name.

 You can also see a rollable whiteboard here.

 "I have this bizarre feeling that I keep saying the same things over
 and over again," muses Dan. "And I know I've written this function
 before. Maybe there's something to Nietzsche's idea of eternal
 recurrence."

 Mark loads the Cruel Site of the Day into his web browser, and laughs
 hysterically.

 If a character as unlikely as Frederick Lee did not exist, it would be
 necessary to invent him. Computer science students are common enough,
 but Fred possesses that most uncommon trait among computer science
 students, a lust for free software. Indeed, he has gone so far as to
 swear eternal vengeance against any and all forms of proprietary
 code--a move previously unheard of. His thick glasses, buzz cut, and
 casual mode of dress give him a look unlike any nerd you have ever
 seen.

 Fred is currently logged into fire, sweating over the nameserver
 configuration.

 "Actually," Leonard confides to you, "this scenario setup is perfect.
 It lets me write a college game in the manner of Save Princeton
 without opening me up to charges of actually having written a college
 game."

 "Did I tell you about my internship with VA Linux?", asks Mark of the
 room in general. No one seems interested, and Mark soon goes back to
 his terminal.

 Dan toys with the idea of starting his paper on Berkeley, but decides
 against it. "It'd only disappear when I wasn't working on it," he says
 resignedly.

>examine whiteboard
 A rollable whiteboard, intended for scratch work, mounted on casters
 so as to be pushed about. It's covered with geometric diagrams on one
 side and the de facto API for a group project on the other. There is
 also a scoreboard of some sort: "DAN 7 LUG 2".

 "Okay, it should work now," says Fred.

 Mark types in a command and shakes his head. "Nope."

 In addition to being a sensitive yet manly human being, Leonard
 Richardson is a musical genius and a coding god. This is primarily due
 to the fact that, as the author of this game, it fell upon him to
 write the previous sentence. His T-shirt advertises the Second Annual
 Lake Arrowhead Rubber Ducky Race (1988).

 Leonard is currently logged into rei, and is working on a text
 adventure which he hopes to enter in the 2000 Interactive Fiction
 Competition. At the moment he is attempting to program a random
 dialogue engine for four particularly fanciful characters.

 "I can't figure out what's wrong with the configuration," says Fred,
 pounding on fire's keyboard.


 Leonard shrugs. "What's to say?"

 "What's the volume of the intersection of a cone and a circle?", asks
 Dan, in case someone has this fact memorized. No one has.

 "This part of the game is a little too self-referential for my taste,"
 says Leonard, indicating an especially indulgent monologue on his
 screen. "In fact, I shouldn't be here at UCLA in the first place,

 Dan sketches a diagram on some scratch paper.


 CSUA Lounge
 The UCLA Computer Science student lounge is a hacker's paradise: a
 line of Linux machines and X terminals runs parallel to the south and
 west wall, ending in a Windows machine and an old Macintosh (for
 contrarians) in the northwest corner. A couch makes the environment
 conducive to overnighters and software design bull sessions. The exit
 is to the east.

 Four computer geeks are here; Fred, Mark, Dan, and Leonard, by name.

 You can also see a rollable whiteboard here.

 Leonard makes a frustrated noise. "Look at this," he says, quoting
 from his screen. "'Unlike C, Inform uses a colon to divide parts of a
 'for' loop specification.' Why?"


 3rd Floor Balcony
 A balcony to your east overlooks the garden at the center of Boelter
 Hall. Palm trees planted there reach for the sky but are dwarfed by
 the brick structure that surrounds them on all sides. An open double
 door to your west bears a sign saying "CSUA - We Make the Digital
 Future Happen". Another doorway lies to the north.

 You are a perfectly normal eleven-year-old girl on a field trip to
 UCLA.

 A basic, no-frills digital watch.

 Outside the Lab
 Somewhere, deep inside Boelter Hall, there is a hallway that passes by
 the lab for CS152B, the dreaded digital design class. Somehow you have
 found your way to this foreboding place, a place so desolate that
 there is a door leading east and a hallway leading west to the
 balcony. (I know that made no sense, but I had to tell you that
 somewhere.) The walls are covered with posterboards which detail the
 work of UCLA's computer science graduate students.

 Some are dry and technical, some flush with the thrill of discovery;
 some use flashy graphics to try to cover up the fact that the research
 in question is something a sophomore might cook up over winter break.


 Digital Design Lab
 Tables line the walls of this room, illuminated by intrusive
 fluorescent lights on the ceiling; tables that bear twenty identical
 computers; computers that bear the Windows NT login banner, enticing
 passers-by to make use of the cut-rate circuit simulation software
 within. The only exit is to the west, and it looks quite inviting.

 A shiny paperclip lies unnoticed on the floor.

 Adam Kaplan seethingly regards the schematic on his screen.

 Adam curses under his breath as the circuit design software,
 predictably, does The Wrong Thing.

>take paperclip
 Taken.

>bend paperclip
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 Normally, Adam is an amiable and pleasant fellow. But now, he is at
 war. At war with a hypothetical piece of hardware, and an all-too-real
 piece of software. The workstation he has claimed is surrounded by
 empty coffee cups and apple juice bottles, and his head hangs heavy as
 he contemplates the mess of pixelated wires on the screen. He has not
 slept for a while.

 Adam tries to check his email, but fails. "I guess fire is still
 down," he says.

>ask adam about fire
 "That's where I get my email," says Adam. "Usually, I mean."

 "Y'know," says Adam, casting his eye in your direction, "I may or may
 not have items you might find valuable which I might or might not
 trade for certain services once performed in the classic text
 adventure fashion." Somewhat embarrassed, he looks back at his screen.

 You are carrying:
   a shiny paperclip

 Adam drags some wires around with his mouse.

 "Yeah, it's a paperclip, all right."

 Adam consults a notebook filled with hand-drawn schematics.

 "He's a cool dude. I've played a couple sets with him. Wish he was
 here helping me with this."

 Four computer geeks are here; Fred, Mark, Dan, and Leonard, by name.

 You can also see a rollable whiteboard here.

 "You know," says Leonard, "I could write a better IF language than
 Inform."

 "That's the spirit!", says Dan.

>search couch
 There is nothing on the couch.

>examine whiteboard
 A rollable whiteboard, intended for scratch work, mounted on casters
 so as to be pushed about. It's covered with geometric diagrams on one
 side and the de facto API for a group project on the other. There is
 also a scoreboard of some sort: "DAN 7 LUG 2".

 Mark stifles a laugh.

 "What are you laughing at?", asks Leonard.

 "This post on Slashdot."

 "Ah yes," says Fred.

 "I didn't think it was that funny," says Leonard.

 "It was all right," says Dan.

 "You can't get onto fire yet," says Mark. "Fred's fu--uh, messing
 around with the configuration files."

 "It must be something in the host configuration,", says Fred.

 Mark loads the Cruel Site of the Day into his web browser, and laughs
 hysterically.

 fire.csua.ucla.edu is CSUA's main machine, and hosts hundreds of user
 accounts. From the way Fred keeps frantically switching between
 configuration files, you get the feeling that something is wrong with
 that machine.

 "No, that didn't work," says Fred to himself.

 "What's the volume of the intersection of a cone and a circle?", asks
 Dan, in case someone has this fact memorized. No one has.


 "Fred's working on it," says Dan. "The stupid network is always going
 down."

 Mark obsesses about the next UCLA LUG meeting.

 "This part of the game is a little too self-referential for my taste,"
 says Leonard, indicating an especially indulgent monologue on his
 screen. "In fact, I shouldn't be here at UCLA in the first place,
 since I graduated before I even started this game--so did Adam,
 incidentally. But authorial self-insertion is a time-honored IF trope,
 and it seemed a shame to miss such a golden opportunity to make use of
 it."

 Dan toys with the idea of starting his paper on Berkeley, but decides
 against it. "It'd only disappear when I wasn't working on it," he says
 resignedly.

 "I don't understand it," says Fred. "I thought I'd set up fire's
 configuration to rid of this problem, the last time this happened."

>ask fred about fire
 "It'll be up in a minute," says Fred. "I just have to fix the DNS
 configuration."

 Dan toys with the idea of starting his paper on Berkeley, but decides
 against it. "It'd only disappear when I wasn't working on it," he says

 Mark curses the 405 freeway, bane of his commute.

 "Hey, I want to be in the game," declares a man whom you suddenly
 notice is standing in the room. "Okay," says Leonard, and the man
 abruptly disappears.

>xyzzy
 A grown-up with curly blond hair and glasses appears out of thin air,
 shouts "I like beans!", and promptly vanishes.

>eat paperclip
 That's plainly lacking the "edible" flag.

 "Stupid web browser," says Mark, killing his X session and restarting.

 "Use lynx," suggests Fred.

 A confused light show erupts from xorn's monitor as Dan runs his game
 with a gravitational constant of 0.59. Dan smiles the manic grin of
 one who enjoys tormenting his data structures.

>examine xorn
 xorn, aka linux.ucla.edu, is the hosting machine for the UCLA Linux
 Users Group, and for the standing LUG Nethack tournament. Green shapes
 flicker on its screen as Dan tests the latest additions to his game.

 "When was the last time anybody managed to get onto fire?", asks Fred.

 "Last night," says Mark.

 "Earlier this morning," says Dan.

 Fred shakes his head.

>examine mac
 plasma, an old Macintosh.

 "Did I tell you about my internship with VA Linux?", asks Mark of the

 his terminal.

 "I wonder if something's wrong with the firewall," says Fred.

 The Cafe is normally a busy, boisterous place, but midterms have

 The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
 play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
 Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
 broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
 all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
 carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the
 booth to the southeast.

 A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,

 Verb Guessing Booth
 The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
 play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
 Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
 broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
 all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
 carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the
 booth to the southeast.

 A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
 each of its three equally-sized divisions labeled with a single word:
 SCRUTINIZE, DISEMBARK, and UNDO.

>give paperclip to lalrry
 Lalrry gladly takes the paperclip from your outstretched palm. With
 the flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and catches it in
 his shirt pocket. Stepping back, he indicates the wheel.

 "Guess a, any!", says Lalrry, indicating the wheel of fortune.

>guess scrutinize
 "Hey, good! And so spin the..."

 Lalrry gives the wheel a good push and it begins rapidly rotating,
 spinning faster now, now slowly winding down until it...stops...on...

                   SCRUTINIZE

 "Hey, win!" Lalrry seems genuinely excited as he hands you your
 prize--a large plush doll made in the unauthorized image of a certain
 tap-dancing animated frog.

 "I love that little!", Lalrry confides in you. "Always makes laugh!"

 "Now guess another, Isqui!"

 "Guess a, any!", says Lalrry, indicating the wheel of fortune.

>examine doll
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine frog
 A green and yellow plush copyright violation: a cartoon frog wearing a
 top hat.

 "Guess a, any!", says Lalrry, indicating the wheel of fortune.

>examine wheel
 A sort of rotating pie chart, the wheel of fortune is about four feet
 in diameter and attached to a frame which, in turn, is bolted to the
 side of the booth. A plastic red arrow suspended over the top of the
 wheel indicates one of the two verbs at random (currently DISEMBARK),
 and will do so again when Lalrry spins the wheel. The verbs currently
 on the pie chart are DISEMBARK and UNDO, each taking up an equal slice
 of the pie.

 "Guess a, any!", says Lalrry, indicating the wheel of fortune.

>guess disembark
 "Hey, good! And so spin the..."

 Lalrry gives the wheel a good push and it begins rapidly rotating,
 spinning faster now, now slowly winding down until it...stops...on...

                   UNDO

 "Sorry!", says Lalrry with a shrug. "Better luck next!"

 You watch, only slightly disconcerted, as the fairgrounds waver and
 fade away. You fall, but the fall is no longer frightening; it is
 exhilarating. All the same, it is worrying just how far you are
 falling--it seems much longer than last time--just as you begin to
 wonder whether something has gone wrong, you are somewhere else.

 Uh-oh, you can see your hands. The invisibility potion must have worn
 off! Your tactic for getting past the giant crab quickly changes from
 quietly sneaking to running like mad for the oaken door on the
 opposite side. Hearing the crunch of your sneakers against the
 shell-ridden floor, the crab frantically scuttles around toward you,
 but you have reached the door. It's unlocked! You open the door a
 crack, dart through, and slam it shut again.

 A dull thud echoes from the other side of the door, followed by a soft
 scratching. Breathing a sigh of relief, you turning around, noticing
 for the first time just how close you are to the end of your quest.
 For this is the...

 Warlock's Anteroom
 The stone walls on either side of you reach high into the darkening
 sky--the smell of fresh air is exhilarating after your travails within
 the depths of the castle. This short hallway was once covered in lush
 red carpet, but its exposure to the elements and its proximity to a
 trigger-happy warlock have scorched and rotted it, exposing the
 cobblestones beneath. Black mold grows on the few patches of carpeting
 that remain. West is the large oaken door you so recently fled
 through; east you can see into the the lighted study of the dread
 warlock Do'papoc.

 Drawing its power from the Kinda-Sorta-Semi-Quasi-Para-Elemental Plane

 citrus-based attacks. Its gemstones sparkle the color of lemons,
 grapefruits, and oranges.

>examine spellbook
 This slight, spiral-bound tome has "Isqui's Spellbook" written on the
 blue cover. It contains seven spells, laboriously copied from your
 school textbook. Unfortunately, your school textbook, "Harry Potter
 and the 2000 Middle School Magical Education Standards", tends to
 focus less on the "cause mighty warlock to tremble in fear" type
 spells and more on the "subject target to sharp kick in pants" type
 spells. In fact, "subject target to sharp kick in pants" is probably
 your best spell, apart from "open even locked or enchanted objects",
 which you can't even memorize anymore, since you got strawberry jam
 all over the runes.

 Your spellbook contains the following spells:
 funyun spell: cause spell caster to memorize wrong spell.
 geordi spell: bring simulacrum of animal to life.
 foobar spell: make the inedible edible.
 rekn0g spell: Bj*e,ev%n.l/((-%d o(fen.na5t*d o2*l70.

 "How To Summon Demons and Influence People" concerns itself primarily
 with powerful and dangerous fiends like the iCthulu, summonable in

 "lexyacc" and "perlsed", and are very complicated, some requiring
 material components. Only one spell near the beginning seems even
 remotely comprehensible to you:

 This parrot looks real enough to have been alive at one point, but it
 may simply be a well-crafted construction. In any event, it's not
 alive right now. Lovely plumage, though; brilliant blues, greens, and
 yellows. Now that you've separated it from its perch, it has no
 particular orientation, and dangles upside-down from your hand. Its
 glass eye stares at you balefully, blaming you for subjecting it to
 the rigors of gravity.

 Warlock's Study
 The sumptuously decorated study of Do'papoc is decorated in
 bookshelves, full of tomes radiating power. A large, bone-white candle
 drips wax onto an oaken table, shedding light on a large, ancient
 spellbook and a terribly inaccurate globe.

 An aged man dressed in black robes sits at the table. Looking up from
 his book, he chuckles, shaking his head.

 "You poor, miserable fool!", he says. "If only you had found the
 obnoxious parrot, preparing beforehand with the funyun, bismol, and
 formic spells... then you may have stood a chance against me! But now,
 the might of the brussel spell will turn you into 7,904 individually
 wrapped jawbreakers!"

 Before you can react, the warlock casts a spell at you! It tingles a
 bit, but its most noticeable effect is its complete and utter failure
 at turning you into so many as ten individually wrapped jawbreakers.

 Do'papoc looks extremely embarrassed and hastily consults the online
 documentation for the brussel spell. "Blast!", he spouts, tearing at
 his beard. "The brussel spell is for ages 12 and up! Local Sorcerers
 503 was clever to send a mere child to do battle with me!" Reaching
 for his spellbook, the warlock becomes calmer and more pensive. "No
 matter," he muses with a snarl. "I'll simply make use of 'brussel
 junior', the brussel spell for the younger set!"

 Do'papoc turns to his book and begins furiously memorizing a spell!

 Do'papoc seems confused momentarily, and shakes his head as if to

 Do'papoc points at you and utters a word of power: "bokbar!"

 Unsurprisingly, nothing happens. The bokbar spell is "turn human into
 parrot", and since there is already a parrot in the vicinity, the
 enchantment has no effect. (Wow, I guess those arbitrary, inconvenient
 limitations on spells cut both ways!)

 Do'papoc is not pleased, and, shamelessly disregarding the rules of
 turn-based magical combat, casts another spell at you. Suddenly, a
 sheepish-looking goblin carrying a dagger appears and cowers in the
 corner. "Kill!", demands the warlock, pointing at you, and the
 whimpering goblin begins a valiant attempt to approach you menacingly
 without ever reducing the distance between you and him.

>bismol goblin
 The goblin squeals and leaps into the air, clutching his posterior.
 Waving his knife, he flees through a side passageway into the depths
 of the keep.
 "Bah!", expectorates the warlock. "Enough of this! I will destroy you
 and your pathetic but exceedingly well-chosen spells with one mighty
 blow!"

 Reaching into his pocket, Do'papoc tosses a handful of magical dust
 into the air, speaking a summons of great power -- "borax!"

 The dust explodes, filling the air with smoke, and from the billowing
 black clouds emerges a bronzed warrior, clad in equally bronze mail
 and carrying a decidedly steely bast--er, broadsword. He looks at you
 with a smirk, and, nodding his head in acknowledgement of an unheard
 order, begins to stride purposefully towards you.

 From beyond the valley of the dead, you hear a voice:

 "It's a good thing your daughter was wearing that emergency bracelet.
 Otherwise, who knows how I would have reached you."

 You hear another voice, your mother's. "Is she okay?"

 "She's right in here, ma'am."

 You open your eyes.

 Inside, the small booth is a mess of blinking lights and
 interconnected black boxes. There are no prizes here; only the noun
 disambiguators, verb-to-action sequencers, and speech synthesizers
 that help Lalrry make sense of the world.

 Your parents are standing over you, looking down with expressions of
 concern. They are greatly relieved to see your eyes open. Your father
 stoops down and, in the absence of any objection from Lalrry, lifts
 you up into a bear hug.

 "How's it going, sporto?", he asks. "Okay," you reply, rubbing your
 eyes. "I guess I just fainted."

 "Well, all's well that ends well, I suppose," says your mother
 stiffly. Come on, Isqui, let's take you home."

 stop in his tracks. His hands drop to his sides, the weapon swinging
 uselessly as he turns around, cringing.

 "Look at you, young man!" The old woman, dressed in drab reds and
 flamboyant necklaces, is not pleased. "Going out without a shirt! What
 are you trying to do, die of cold? Maybe give your mother a heart
 attack? What do you think you're doing with that sword? You're going
 to kill someone with that thing, and what would your father think?

 "And you, Mr. Warlock! Terrorizing the countryside! Killing off the
 peasantry! Turning the land black with oppression and woe! What do you
 hope to accomplish, huh? Didn't you ever have a mother to tell you
 what's right and wrong?

 The aged woman grabs Do'papoc and her son in an ear lock (she may be
 short, but she's got long arms, and a strong grip), and begins to drag
 them both, painfully, into the anteroom. Passing you, she turns and
 addresses you.

 "You hurry home, young lady. This is no place for someone like you."
 She nods at you, and you fade away...

 he says confidentially. "The Queen was quite on, although the of would
 hear of but, rather, should say." You nod in what you hope looks like
 agreement.

 Behind the Booths
 You are in a shadowy alcove, surrounded by the canvas backs of several
 carnival booths. The music and bustle of the midway seems very far
 away, and a harvest moon illuminates the wet grass of the fairgrounds
 and the makeshift walls that surround you.

 The glinting tip of a small metal box peeks out from beneath the verb
 guessing booth.

>examine quarter
 A newly minted millennial Canadian quarter. You're not sure how you
 ended up with it.

>turn off blue

 Verb Guessing Booth
 The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
 play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
 Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
 broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
 all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
 carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the
 booth to the southeast.

 A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
 labeled with a single word: DISEMBARK.

>give canadian to lalrry
 Lalrry gladly takes the quarter from your outstretched palm. With the
 flair of a showman, he tosses it into the air and catches it in his
 shirt pocket. Stepping back, he indicates the wheel.

 "Guess a verb, verb!", says Lalrry, indicating the wheel of fortune.

>guess disembark
 "Hey, guess! And so I spin the wheel..."

 Lalrry gives the wheel a good push and it begins rapidly rotating,
 spinning faster now, now slowly winding down until it...stops...on...

                   DISEMBARK

 "Hey, you win!" Lalrry seems genuinely excited as he hands you your
 prize--a long rope of red licorice.

 Lalrry shrugs and says "Guess that's! 'Ve got to get going now--no use
 hanging around after all the are gone. Hope had."

 Lallry begins slowly, methodically dismantling the empty wheel. You
 stand and watch him for a while, an awkward figure working gracefully
 in silence. Then you turn away and slowly walk into the humid night,,
 clutching your prizes.
