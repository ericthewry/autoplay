 Closing time. You have just finished going through the invoices, and
 Uncle Marty is counting the register. Cousin Dermot is hunched over
 the counter, asleep.

 "You go, Alistair", Uncle Marty says, "us two will lock up. Don't want
 to keep the wife waiting, do you?"

 You are going to the funfair. You promised Catherine.

 The clock strikes six: you are late, once more.

 An Interactive Fiction by I-K. Huuhtanen
 Release 1 / Serial number 111001 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Liddell Hat Shop</span>
 Just a small business, but it's yours. Founded by your late father
 some forty years ago, it still offers a wide range of headgear for
 discerning gentlemen, all crafted by hand. The walls up to the ceiling
 are lined with top hats and bowlers, fedoras and homburgs, panamas and
 boaters. At the moment, at the end of the day, the space a bit untidy,
 with the counter stacked with miscellaneous papers and textile samples
 and the rubbish bin scouring with crumpled notes and order sheets.
 Marty promises to tidy up.

 The door outside onto the street is to the west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Liddell Hat Shop</span>
 The walls up to the ceiling are lined with various kinds of hats. The
 counter is stacked with miscellaneous papers and textile samples and
 the rubbish bin is scouring with crumpled notes and order sheets.

 The door outside onto the street is to the west.

>inventory

 You are carrying nothing.

>examine hats

 You notice nothing interesting about the hats.

>wear hats

 (first taking the hats)
 The hats are not worth too much attention.

>examine bin

 The bin is scouring with crumpled paper: miscellaneous notes, order
 confirmations, wrapping sheets, receipts. You notice your funfair
 ticket has ended up in here.

>examine papers

 What do you want to examine: the invoices or the crumpled papers?

>take ticket

 You dig the ticket out of the bin.

 "So, that's where I put it", says Uncle Marty, apologetic. "These
 things are important to children", he continues, "funfairs and such. I
 remember when Dermot was little... Then we get old and, before you
 know it, everything new and unexpected becomes..." He loses the count
 of the money. "You go now. Don't you worry about me, little Alistair.
 You've got too much worries as it is, with the shop and the family and
 your mother having taken ill. I know how it is with me, I do. It's not
 every man who'd take on two such employees as me and your cousin
 Dermot there. Your father would have been proud."

 You're not too sure about that. But it's your business now. You need
 to go.

>examine invoices

 Just some bills for purchased materials.

 "Oh, Alistair, you don't need worry about those", says Uncle Marty, "I
 will go through them tonight. I've got time."

>examine crumpled invoices

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the crumpled
 papers.

>examine crumpled papers

 Sometimes Uncle Marty throws something important in the bin, but
 usually it's just useless paperwaste.

>take crumpled papers

 Uncle Marty will take out the rubbish eventually.

>examine me

 You are carrying:
   the funfair ticket

>examine marty

 Apparently Uncle Marty used to be quite a dashing chap, but one sad
 March of 1961 things happened -- things that were never spoken of in
 front of you children. Be that as it may, Marty was never the same
 after that.

>ask marty about things

 Uncle Marty does not answer.

>examine samples

 You notice nothing interesting about the textile samples.

 The walls up to the ceiling are lined with various kinds of hats. The
 counter is stacked with miscellaneous papers and textile samples and
 the rubbish bin is scouring with crumpled notes and order sheets.

 The door outside onto the street is to the west.

>go west

 (first opening the door)
 "Tea on Sunday, as usual?" asks Uncle Marty.

 Yes, as usual. Dermot has promised to get his act together after last
 Sunday when Marty threatened to dunk his head in the teapot if he
 dozes off again.

 "See you there, then." Uncle Marty smiles and waves his hand goodbye.
 It's like he's relieved every time you say you'll come, thought you've
 never said no.

 You step outside onto the street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Street (in front of the Hat Shop)</span>
 The sign above the door reads in bright red letters: "LIDDELL HAT
 SHOP". The street leads down south to the riverside.The town spreads
 all around on the hillside, the black silhouette of the Ferris wheel
 is drawn against the red of the sky at the south-western horizon.

 There's a chill in the air.

 Catherine is staring at the distance, completely in her thoughts,
 running her fingers through Liz's hair as the girl sleeps in the
 stroller.

 "There you are", your wife awakens to you arriving. She looks tired.
 "We've been waiting for... oh, who cares. I don't feel like explaining
 this to you any more. I've been pushing Liz around in this thing since
 eleven o'clock. It's pretty cold, you know", Cat says.

 The summer is turning into autumn. Yesterday you had noticed how the
 cold breeze from the river travels up the hill and creeps under your
 cardigan. You sigh and say the girls could have just come into the
 shop to get out of the cold.

 Cat gives you the same answer you've heard many times before: "You
 know your uncle. I didn't want to him to wake up Liz."

 Catherine straightens her torso and tucks her skirt. "You've got the
 ticket? Let's go then."

>smack cat

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go

 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>examine liz

 A cute two-year-old: she's wearing a white dress and has a black silk
 ribbon in her hair. Now she's asleep.

>wake liz up

 Cat stops you. "Don't wake her up", she whispers.

>go southwest

 This street leads down towards the river. West of here is a web of
 small streets that would only lengthen your journey.

>go west

 This street leads down towards the river. West of here is a web of
 small streets that would only lengthen your journey.

>go down

 You leave the stroller and go.

 Catherine lifts her hands in the air.

 "Yes, I'll push this god-awful buggy for a mile still. Clearly it's my
 responsibility, once again."

 She grabs hold of Liz's stroller and begins trotting down the hill
 after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The riverside walk begins here. A lonely bench stands at the at the
 end of the walkway for the weary to rest on. A street rises up north
 to the hills. The river runs east to west, splitting the town in half:
 to the north, the hills, to the south, the industry and the suburbs.
 The river walk follows the bank stretching west. The Ferris wheel is
 visible against the western sky.

 Your little bunny rabbit is still fast asleep in the stroller. Cat
 notices the way you look at your daughter, and softens her tone of
 voice: "She's been sleeping since we left home. Good, though: she's
 going to need the energy."

 You remember the last time you went to the funfair: how scared Liz was
 to see her reflections in the House of Mirrors -- she thought she was
 actually growing in all these weird directions. You mention this to
 Catherine, and she replies: "That was a year ago. She's a big girl
 now." A faint smile on your wife's face.

 Has it really been a year already...

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The walkway runs east to west along the riverside. The funfair gates
 are ahead to the west.

 Cat follows you, pushing Liz.

 You stroll along the riverside, and Catherine says: "Remind me to pick
 up some eggs on the way home. I promised your mother we would visit
 her at the nursing home on Sunday. I said I'd bring apple tarts for
 tea."

 You tell Cat that on Sunday you're having tea at Uncle Marty's. In a
 flash, the anger is back in Cat's eyes, but she doesn't reply.

>apologize

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kiss cat

 Keep your mind on the game.

>grovel

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>file for divorce

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The walkway runs east to west along the riverside and ends here at the
 funfair gates.

 Cat follows you, pushing Liz.

 Finally Cat says something: "Can't you spend one day with your
 daughter and your old mother instead of those never-ending tea parties
 with your loony uncle and good-for-nothing cousin?" she sighs.

 They are counting on me, Cat.

 Cat stops. "We are counting on you, Alistair! Besides, do you think
 your mother is going to live forever? She doesn't have long, you know
 that. Ever since your father died, you've seen how she's been waiting
 to follow him. And Liz: she's going to grow up and leave us sooner
 than you think."

 I see you and Liz every day, Cat.

 "Oh, I wonder if you ever truly see me, Alistair." Cat turns around
 and starts pushing the stroller to the opposite direction.

>follow cat

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>cat, come back

 She is too far.

 At the east end of the walkway you see Cat sitting down on a bench.

>sit on bench

 That is too far.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The walkway runs east to west along the riverside. The funfair gates
 are behind you to the west.

 You see your wife hasn't moved.

>sit on bench

 That is too far.

>sit

 (on the bench)
 That is too far.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The riverside walk ends here. A lonely bench stands at the at the end
 of the walkway for the weary to rest on. A street rises up north to
 the hills. The river runs east to west, splitting the town in half: to
 the north, the hills, to the south, the industry and the suburbs. The
 river walk follows the bank stretching west. The Ferris wheel is
 visible against the western sky.

 Catherine is sitting here on the bench, covering her face with her
 hands so that the passers-by would not see her crying. She's left the
 stroller in the middle of the walkway.

>examine stroller

 In the stroller is Liz.

 Catherine keeps sobbing.

 The walkway slopes slightly towards the edge of the river. You notice
 Liz's stroller has begun to slowly move.

>take stroller

 As you grab the stroller, it falls down the bank into the river and
 disappears under water.

 Catherine runs to the edge of the bank and is screaming, terrified:

 "Liz! Alistair, do something!"

 Catherine is frozen still. She stares at the water, unable to move.

>enter water

 You cannot swim, but that's the least of your worries now. You dive in
 after Liz.
>take liz
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Underwater</span>
 The water is black -- even blacker than it looked like from above.
 Briefly you think your foot hit the pebbles at the riverbed, but you
 find out the water seems to expand indefinitely in nearly all
 directions. There's a faint glimmer of light above you.

 Suddenly you see a glimpse of a white dress, somewhere to the east.
 You feel like shouting after your daughter but then remember you would
 drown were you to do that.

>go east

 The shape of Liz disappears as you swim closer. Your feet hit the
 bottom: smooth concrete. The water's surprisingly shallow.

>take liz

 You can't see any such thing.

>go east

 You feel the cold water aching your limbs. No sign of Liz.

>find liz

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go up

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overflow Chamber</span>
 You emerge from a pool of water. This seems to be the sewers: a
 spacious chamber with drain tunnels leading to it from both sides. No
 water is coming in, there's only what's left in this overflow pool
 after last weeks storms that swept the town.

 There is a train waiting by the platform on the north side of the
 chamber. The white steam licks the curving walls as the engine is
 being warmed.

 There's Liz. She's climbed to the platform, with her white dress
 dripping wet, and boards the train. The Guard courteously lifts his
 cap for her. Then he pulls out a large pocket watch and blows his
 whistle.

 "All aboard!"

>examine liz

 You can't see any such thing.

>board train

 You climb onto the metal platform.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overflow Chamber (on the platform)</span>
 The engine puffs and hisses as it is prepared for departure.

>board train

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 You step into a small space at the end of the train. Oak panelled
 walls are dark, the linoleum on the floor is worn-down. A corridor
 leads east from here, the door outside is to the south.

 The Guard takes a last look from the steps and jumps aboard. The train
 begins to move.

 Your daughter is nowhere to be seen. The Guard surely knows something.
 The man doesn't seem too helpful, though, standing here and sizing you
 with his eyes from head to tow.

 "Ticket, please."

 Then he coughs, as to be polite.

>examine ticket

 A white paper, on it the text:
 FunFair
 Complimentary
 Admit 1 child 2 adults


>give ticket to man

 The Guard takes the piece of paper. His whiskers tremble a bit.

 "Thank you, sir."

 The Guard keeps shaking his head for a while to show his overall
 disapproval of you being here, and then says: "Be sure to have the
 ticket ready. You never know when I'll be back to inspect it."

 The man takes off to the eastern corridor and disappears through a
 compartment door at the end of it.

>examine liz

 You can't see any such thing.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 You don't see Liz. The corridor extends east from the vestibule to a
 door at the west. Another door leads south. The lamps on the wall shed
 a dim yellow light.

>examine lamps

 Small sconces with opaque shades.

>examine e

 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>go south

 (first opening the door to a private compartment)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Private Compartment</span>
 Liz doesn't seem to be here. You can smell the dust in the air. The
 room is dark: the small skylight above is so blackened with coal dust
 is doesn't let in much light.

 The door swings closed behind you, as these train doors are designed
 to do.

 Mr Larvington -- ?

 Slouching behind a huge oak desk is your old school teacher Mr
 Larvington, smoking a hookah.

 "Yes, u-hum, I shall take the roll", mutters Mr Larvington, "Leo
 Liddell?" He takes a look around, as do you. "No? Excellent. Alistair
 Liddell?"

 He sees you. "Alistair, still not showing up in time."

 You point out that Leo is even more late.

 Mr Larvington sucks his pipe as a deliberate gesture and explains:
 "Exactly, Mr Liddell. And look at you still: trying to squeal on your
 brother, you little pig."

 As always, Leo gets the royal treatment and you get scolded, no matter
 what you do. That obnoxious bully.

 "But now, young Liddell: let's see your paper", says Mr Larvington and
 holds out his hand demandingly.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   the train ticket

 Your Teacher looks at you amidst the smoke. "You do have the paper, Mr
 Liddell, do you not?"

>teacher, our dog ate it

 Mr Larvington does not reply. Perhaps it would be better to ask about
 something.

 Mr Larvington is looking impatient.

>ask larvington about paper

 Mr Larvington does not answer.

>ask teacher about paper

 Mr Larvington does not answer.

 "The paper, Mr Liddell."

>ask teacher about liz

 Mr Larvington does not answer.

 Mr Larvington lays his hookah on the desk and says: "You haven't
 forgotten it, have you? We've talked about this, Mr Liddell."

>go north

 (first opening the door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor extends east from the vestibule to a door at the west. Mr
 Larvington's private compartment is to the south.

 You hear Mr Larvington yelling behind the door: "So, you think you can
 just run off? Show some respect, Liddell!"

>go east

 (first opening the door to the east)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Passenger Compartment</span>
 Liz is nowhere to be seen. The rows of seats on two sides of the
 compartment are empty, apart from a bed that has been laid between
 them at the middle. There lies your Mother, hardly visible from under
 her thick red quilt.

 Mummy? Really?

 "Alistair, are you skipping school again? Come and take care of your
 responsibilities. I'm too old and tired for this."

 As you cautiously step closer, you see Mother is trying to hold down a
 little Piglet wriggling and squealing horrendously under the quilt.

 "I'm trying to knit a sweater for her, but the ungrateful little
 bastard won't wear it, and now she will not stop screaming."

>examine piglet

 Small and squiggly. There's something very familiar about the animal.

 Mummy lifts the loud pig from under the covers.

 "Your responsibility!"

>take piglet

 You grab hold of the wriggling animal. It tries to bite you -- then
 again, your Mother would have tried that, too, and most certainly
 succeeded, had you not relieved her of this burden.

 "Now, make it shut up. You see: this is what happens when you don't
 give them a proper upbringing", says Mummy, holding her ears.

>ask mummy about piglet

 Mother does not answer.

 The animal is so very loud you can hardly hear your own thoughts. What
 am I supposed to do with this?

 "Don't look at me", your Mother says, "that's your problem."

>spank piglet

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>shake piglet

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine quilt

 You notice nothing interesting about the quilt.

>take guilt

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine mom

 Your Mother is a frail old woman.

 Mummy tries to sit up in her bed, but immediately slumps back down on
 the mattress.

 "Oh, just hit it, for goodness' sake!"

 But it's so tiny.

 You feel someone grabbing your shoulder from behind. It's your brother
 Leo, who leans over to poke at the Piglet.

 "What's the matter, Alice?" he says to you and laughs as the Piglet
 gets more scared, "has your baby turned into a swine?"

 Mum, tell him not to!

 "Don't be such a girl, Alistair. Hit it. Your brother would."

 Leo starts trolling:

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Hush-a-by baby, in Alice's lap!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">Till the tea's ready, there's time for a nap:</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">When the tea's over, we'll go to war -</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">And now I shall beat you 'till you're achy and sore!</span>

 Your brother adverts his frustration from the pig to you and starts
 punching your arm. "Hit it, Alice, hit it! I would."

>hit leo

 You defend yourself, for once, but Leo just laughs. He does stop
 hitting you, nonetheless.

>hit piglet

 You smack the tiny Piglet in the face. It immediately goes silent,
 stares at you with its frightened eyes and then, fearing for its
 <span class="floydstyle em">life</span>, flees your violent grip.

 Liz!

 You now see it is your little daughter running away from you, not a
 pig. A quick glimpse of her white dress as she dissappears into the
 vestibule in the east end of the car.

 "O-oh!" says Leo, grinning.

 Mother laughs from the bed: "Come on, don't look so shocked, Alistair.
 It's not like you've never done that before... And, like I always used
 to say:

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Speak roughly to your little boy,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">And beat him when he sneezes:</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">He only does it to annoy,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">because he know it teases!</span>

 And look at you and your brother now: you turned out just fine.

>examine liz

 You can't see any such thing.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 This is a small space at the east-end of the train car, with a door
 leading outside and another through the gangway to the next carriage.
 The passanger compartment extends from here to the west. There's small
 placard of some sort on the gangway entrance. There's a door leading
 outside, but it's locked.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Class Room</span>
 The room is dark: the blackened skylight lets in only a faint
 suggestion of light. Mr Larvington slouches behind the desk, smoking
 his pipe.

 Mr Larvington is waiting for you. "So, you decided to drop back at
 your house and fetch the paper, did you, Mr Liddell? It better be one
 damn fine essay, it better."

 Your Teacher leans toward you. "Do I have to make you write 'I will
 not disobey in the matters of paper' a hundred times? Enough with
 these antics."

>give ticket to teacher

 The Teacher pulls the paper from your hand and gives it a good long
 look. "You haven't put any words down? Of course it's early on, but
 you ought have at least something."

 You don't even know what the subject is supposed to be -- how are you
 to write a paper?

 "Precisely that, Mr Liddell", says Mr Larvington, "the subject of the
 paper is 'What is the Subject?' How difficult can that be? The
 <span class="floydstyle em">words</span> will come to you, if you just listen. Don't you know
 that the meaning of things always comes from the outside, it is only
 the meaningfulness of them that you get to judge for yourself. Or do
 you still think this is just about you, poor little Alistair Liddell?"

 He returns the paper to you and also gives you a pen -- he ventures a
 guess that you have probably lost your own. "You run along, now."

>examine pen

 Writes black.

 Mr Larvington turns his attention to the smoke that twirls upon the
 desk and no longer sees you.

>write on paper

 You prepare to write on the school assignment.

>again

 You prepare to write on the school assignment.

>write assignment

 The word "assignment" may appear to have come to you, but it is of no
 significance.

>write "invitation" on paper

 The word ""invitation"" may appear to have come to you, but it is of
 no significance.

>write invite on paper

>write the party of the first part shall be known in this contract as the party of the first part
 THE PARTY OF THE FIRST PART

 Only a single word at a time, please.

>go north

 (first opening the door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor runs east-west between the vestibule and the passenger
 compartment. Mr Larvington's private compartment is to the south.

>go east

 (first opening the the passenger compartment door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Passenger Compartment</span>
 The compartment is poorly lit: the shutters are closed and there's
 only a small lamp by the bed. The rows of seats on two sides of the
 compartment are empty, apart from a bed that has been laid between
 them at the middle. In the bed lies your Mother. The Piglet's sweater
 is on the bed, unfinished: you see the red yarn in the knitting basket
 on the floor.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 This is a small space at the east-end of the train car, with a gangway
 leading to the next carriage. The passanger compartment extends from
 here to the west. There's a door leading outside, but it's locked.

 This is where you saw Liz flee from you, but now she's gone. Instead,
 in front of the train car door appears a figure from thin air. As it
 takes proper shape, you see it's Catherine.

 "You seem to have misplace our daughter." Cat sounds sarcastic. "Just
 keep listening to your mother's advice, and she will run from you
 forever."

 Cat seems to be losing shape again: her body begins to fade, leaving
 visible only her head.

 The head speaks: "Since I'm here, you must want help in some matter.
 That is why you have summoned me, isn't it? Speak, then."

>speak

 Perhaps it would be better to ask about something.

>ask cat about liz

 "I've never lost her so I wouldn't know how to find her", says Cat.

>ask cat about party

 Cat does not answer.

>ask cat about madness

 Cat does not answer.

>ask cat about words

 "Remember to listen to <span class="floydstyle em">us</span>", Cat replies.

>listen

 "I will try to help you, if there's something you need help with. That
 is, after all, what I do in <span class="floydstyle em">life</span>", your wife says.

 You hear a strange, quiet suffling sound approaching from the
 passenger compartment.

>write life

 You scribble the word "<span class="floydstyle em">life</span>" on the paper.

 Catherine says, in all her physical inconsistence: "I won't be here
 forever. Speak now."

 An endless queue of people dressed black arrive slowly and silently
 from the passenger compartment and push past you into the vestibule.
 The gangway to the east opens up, letting in one person, then closes
 again. You see a black velvet curtain behind the door, nothing else,
 as yet another dark traveller enters the corridor connection.

>write us

 You scribble the word on the school assignment in the form of
 "<span class="floydstyle em">we</span>".

 Your wife is increasingly translucent.

>write words

 You prepare to write on the school assignment.

>listen

 The feet of the people in black make that quiet suffle, otherwise they
 are completely silent.

>look

 Cat, or what is present of her, follows by your side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Passenger Compartment</span>

 It says "Private Party" in fancy letters.

>cut queue

>take placard

 That seems to be a part of the gangway.

>examine cat

 More beautiful than ever.

>talk to cat

 Perhaps it would be better to ask about something.

>ask cat about assignment

 Catherine says thinks for a while. "You have an assignment? Let me see
 it."

>show assignment to cat

 Catherine takes a look at your paper.

 "What is the Subject? All I know is that it isn't me: for what I've
 become is the object of your <span class="floydstyle em">dream</span>, yours and Liz's -- I've
 so emerged myself in <span class="floydstyle em">us</span>, that without you I seize to exist.
 Should you not think of any more, I -- or the thing I've transformed
 into -- would vanish into thin air. Should I be reborn after that, I
 would certainly be something utterly different, a stranger. Though,
 for myself, I've been a stranger for years now, and what once was, I
 fear, is forever lost to me."

 Her head looks to be fading: it's only her body that's visible to you
 now.

 "So, I think the real question is: What is the Object?"

>write dream

 You scribble the word "<span class="floydstyle em">dream</span>" on the paper.

>show assignment to cat

 Cat's body replies: "Think of <span class="floydstyle em">us</span> when you think of yourself."

 Closing time. You have just finished going through the invoices, and
 Uncle Marty is counting the register. Cousin Dermot is hunched over
 the counter, asleep.

 "You go, Alistair", Uncle Marty says, "us two will lock up. Don't want
 to keep the wife waiting, do you?"

 You are going to the funfair. You promised Catherine.

 The clock strikes six: you are late, once more.

 <span class="floydstyle header">Sentencing Mr Liddell</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by I-K. Huuhtanen
 Release 1 / Serial number 111001 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Liddell Hat Shop</span>
 Just a small business, but it's yours. Founded by your late father
 some forty years ago, it still offers a wide range of headgear for
 discerning gentlemen, all crafted by hand. The walls up to the ceiling
 are lined with top hats and bowlers, fedoras and homburgs, panamas and
 boaters. At the moment, at the end of the day, the space a bit untidy,
 with the counter stacked with miscellaneous papers and textile samples
 and the rubbish bin scouring with crumpled notes and order sheets.
 Marty promises to tidy up.

 The door outside onto the street is to the west.


 [If this is your first time playing 'Sentencing Mr Liddell', type MENU
 to learn more about the game.]

>examine bin

 The bin is scouring with crumpled paper: miscellaneous notes, order
 confirmations, wrapping sheets, receipts. You notice your funfair
 ticket has ended up in here.

>take ticket

 You dig the ticket out of the bin.

 "So, that's where I put it", says Uncle Marty, apologetic. "These
 things are important to children", he continues, "funfairs and such. I
 remember when Dermot was little... Then we get old and, before you
 know it, everything new and unexpected becomes..." He loses the count
 of the money. "You go now. Don't you worry about me, little Alistair.
 You've got too much worries as it is, with the shop and the family and
 your mother having taken ill. I know how it is with me, I do. It's not
 every man who'd take on two such employees as me and your cousin
 Dermot there. Your father would have been proud."

 You're not too sure about that. But it's your business now. You need
 to go.

>go west

 (first opening the door)
 "Tea on Sunday, as usual?" asks Uncle Marty.

 Yes, as usual. Dermot has promised to get his act together after last
 Sunday when Marty threatened to dunk his head in the teapot if he
 dozes off again.

 "See you there, then." Uncle Marty smiles and waves his hand goodbye.
 It's like he's relieved every time you say you'll come, thought you've
 never said no.

 You step outside onto the street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Street (in front of the Hat Shop)</span>
 The sign above the door reads in bright red letters: "LIDDELL HAT
 SHOP". The street leads down south to the riverside.The town spreads
 all around on the hillside, the black silhouette of the Ferris wheel
 is drawn against the red of the sky at the south-western horizon.

 There's a chill in the air.

 Catherine is staring at the distance, completely in her thoughts,
 running her fingers through Liz's hair as the girl sleeps in the
 stroller.

 "There you are", your wife awakens to you arriving. She looks tired.
 "We've been waiting for... oh, who cares. I don't feel like explaining
 this to you any more. I've been pushing Liz around in this thing since
 eleven o'clock. It's pretty cold, you know", Cat says.

 The summer is turning into autumn. Yesterday you had noticed how the
 cold breeze from the river travels up the hill and creeps under your
 cardigan. You sigh and say the girls could have just come into the
 shop to get out of the cold.

 Cat gives you the same answer you've heard many times before: "You
 know your uncle. I didn't want to him to wake up Liz."

 Catherine straightens her torso and tucks her skirt. "You've got the
 ticket? Let's go then."

>go southwest

 This street leads down towards the river. West of here is a web of
 small streets that would only lengthen your journey.

>go down

 You leave the stroller and go.

 Catherine lifts her hands in the air.

 "Yes, I'll push this god-awful buggy for a mile still. Clearly it's my
 responsibility, once again."

 She grabs hold of Liz's stroller and begins trotting down the hill
 after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The riverside walk begins here. A lonely bench stands at the at the
 end of the walkway for the weary to rest on. A street rises up north
 to the hills. The river runs east to west, splitting the town in half:
 to the north, the hills, to the south, the industry and the suburbs.
 The river walk follows the bank stretching west. The Ferris wheel is
 visible against the western sky.

 Your little bunny rabbit is still fast asleep in the stroller. Cat
 notices the way you look at your daughter, and softens her tone of
 voice: "She's been sleeping since we left home. Good, though: she's
 going to need the energy."

 You remember the last time you went to the funfair: how scared Liz was
 to see her reflections in the House of Mirrors -- she thought she was
 actually growing in all these weird directions. You mention this to
 Catherine, and she replies: "That was a year ago. She's a big girl
 now." A faint smile on your wife's face.

 Has it really been a year already...

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The walkway runs east to west along the riverside. The funfair gates
 are ahead to the west.

 Cat follows you, pushing Liz.

 You stroll along the riverside, and Catherine says: "Remind me to pick
 up some eggs on the way home. I promised your mother we would visit
 her at the nursing home on Sunday. I said I'd bring apple tarts for
 tea."

 You tell Cat that on Sunday you're having tea at Uncle Marty's. In a
 flash, the anger is back in Cat's eyes, but she doesn't reply.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The walkway runs east to west along the riverside and ends here at the
 funfair gates.

 Cat follows you, pushing Liz.

 Finally Cat says something: "Can't you spend one day with your
 daughter and your old mother instead of those never-ending tea parties
 with your loony uncle and good-for-nothing cousin?" she sighs.

 They are counting on me, Cat.

 Cat stops. "We are counting on you, Alistair! Besides, do you think
 your mother is going to live forever? She doesn't have long, you know
 that. Ever since your father died, you've seen how she's been waiting
 to follow him. And Liz: she's going to grow up and leave us sooner
 than you think."

 I see you and Liz every day, Cat.

 "Oh, I wonder if you ever truly see me, Alistair." Cat turns around
 and starts pushing the stroller to the opposite direction.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The walkway runs east to west along the riverside. The funfair gates
 are behind you to the west.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">River Walk</span>
 The riverside walk ends here. A lonely bench stands at the at the end
 of the walkway for the weary to rest on. A street rises up north to
 the hills. The river runs east to west, splitting the town in half: to
 the north, the hills, to the south, the industry and the suburbs. The
 river walk follows the bank stretching west. The Ferris wheel is
 visible against the western sky.

 Catherine is sitting here on the bench, covering her face with her
 hands so that the passers-by would not see her crying. She's left the
 stroller in the middle of the walkway.

>go east

 You can't go in that direction. The walkway continues west along the
 river. To the north, the street leads up to the hill.

 Catherine keeps sobbing.

 The walkway slopes slightly towards the edge of the river. You notice
 Liz's stroller has begun to slowly move.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Cat mumbles something you interpret as "Why did you have to spoil this
 one, too? You can't even push the god-damn stroller."

 The stroller is getting dangerously close to the river's edge.

>wait

 Time passes.

 Suddenly Catherine cries: "Liz!"

 The stroller falls down the bank into the river and disappears under
 water.

 Catherine runs to the edge  and is screaming, terrified:

 "Liz! Alistair, do something!"

>dive

 You cannot swim, but that's the least of your worries now. You dive in
 after Liz.
>go east
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Underwater</span>
 The water is black -- even blacker than it looked like from above.
 Briefly you think your foot hit the pebbles at the riverbed, but you
 find out the water seems to expand indefinitely in nearly all
 directions. There's a faint glimmer of light above you.

 Suddenly you see a glimpse of a white dress, somewhere to the east.
 You feel like shouting after your daughter but then remember you would
 drown were you to do that.

>go up

 The light above you is just as faint as before.

>go east

 The shape of Liz disappears as you swim closer. Your feet hit the
 bottom: smooth concrete. The water's surprisingly shallow.

>go up

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overflow Chamber</span>
 You emerge from a pool of water. This seems to be the sewers: a
 spacious chamber with drain tunnels leading to it from both sides. No
 water is coming in, there's only what's left in this overflow pool
 after last weeks storms that swept the town.

 There is a train waiting by the platform on the north side of the
 chamber. The white steam licks the curving walls as the engine is
 being warmed.

 There's Liz. She's climbed to the platform, with her white dress
 dripping wet, and boards the train. The Guard courteously lifts his
 cap for her. Then he pulls out a large pocket watch and blows his
 whistle.

 "All aboard!"

>go up

 You climb onto the metal platform.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Overflow Chamber (on the platform)</span>
 The engine puffs and hisses as it is prepared for departure.

>go up

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 You step into a small space at the end of the train. Oak panelled
 walls are dark, the linoleum on the floor is worn-down. A corridor
 leads east from here, the door outside is to the south.

 The Guard takes a last look from the steps and jumps aboard. The train
 begins to move.

 Your daughter is nowhere to be seen. The Guard surely knows something.
 The man doesn't seem too helpful, though, standing here and sizing you
 with his eyes from head to tow.

 "Ticket, please."

 Then he coughs, as to be polite.

>show ticket to man

 The Guard takes the piece of paper. His whiskers tremble a bit.

 "Thank you, sir."

 The Guard keeps shaking his head for a while to show his overall
 disapproval of you being here, and then says: "Be sure to have the
 ticket ready. You never know when I'll be back to inspect it."

 The man takes off to the eastern corridor and disappears through a
 compartment door at the end of it.

>go west

 You can't go in that direction. A corridor runs east from here.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 You don't see Liz. The corridor extends east from the vestibule to a
 door at the west. Another door leads south. The lamps on the wall shed
 a dim yellow light.

>go south

 (first opening the door to a private compartment)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Private Compartment</span>
 Liz doesn't seem to be here. You can smell the dust in the air. The
 room is dark: the small skylight above is so blackened with coal dust
 is doesn't let in much light.

 The door swings closed behind you, as these train doors are designed
 to do.

 Mr Larvington -- ?

 Slouching behind a huge oak desk is your old school teacher Mr
 Larvington, smoking a hookah.

 "Yes, u-hum, I shall take the roll", mutters Mr Larvington, "Leo
 Liddell?" He takes a look around, as do you. "No? Excellent. Alistair
 Liddell?"

 He sees you. "Alistair, still not showing up in time."

 You point out that Leo is even more late.

 Mr Larvington sucks his pipe as a deliberate gesture and explains:
 "Exactly, Mr Liddell. And look at you still: trying to squeal on your
 brother, you little pig."

 As always, Leo gets the royal treatment and you get scolded, no matter
 what you do. That obnoxious bully.

 "But now, young Liddell: let's see your paper", says Mr Larvington and
 holds out his hand demandingly.

>show ticket to man

 The Teacher pulls the paper from your hand and gives it a good long
 look. "You haven't put any words down? Of course it's early on, but
 you ought have at least something."

 You don't even know what the subject is supposed to be -- how are you
 to write a paper?

 "Precisely that, Mr Liddell", says Mr Larvington, "the subject of the
 paper is 'What is the Subject?' How difficult can that be? The
 <span class="floydstyle em">words</span> will come to you, if you just listen. Don't you know
 that the meaning of things always comes from the outside, it is only
 the meaningfulness of them that you get to judge for yourself. Or do
 you still think this is just about you, poor little Alistair Liddell?"

 He returns the paper to you and also gives you a pen -- he ventures a
 guess that you have probably lost your own. "You run along, now."

>write dream

 You choose the school assignment as writing paper, since it seems to
 be the only sensible option.

 You scribble the word "<span class="floydstyle em">dream</span>" on the paper.

 Mr Larvington turns his attention to the smoke that twirls upon the
 desk and no longer sees you.

>write life

 You scribble the word "<span class="floydstyle em">life</span>" on the paper.

>write live

 You scribble the word "<span class="floydstyle em">live</span>" on the paper.

>write us

 You scribble the word on the school assignment in the form of
 "<span class="floydstyle em">we</span>".

>examine paper

 A white paper, on it the text:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor extends east from the vestibule to a door at the west. Mr
 Larvington's private compartment is to the south.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>

>go east

 (first opening the door to the east)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Passenger Compartment</span>
 Liz is nowhere to be seen. The rows of seats on two sides of the
 compartment are empty, apart from a bed that has been laid between
 them at the middle. There lies your Mother, hardly visible from under
 her thick red quilt.

 Mummy? Really?

 "Alistair, come and take care of your responsibilities. I'm too old
 and tired for this."

 As you cautiously step closer, you see Mother is trying to hold down a
 little Piglet wriggling and squealing horrendously under the quilt.

 "I'm trying to knit a sweater for her, but the ungrateful little
 bastard won't wear it, and now she will not stop screaming."

>take sweater

 You take the sweater.

 Mummy lifts the loud pig from under the covers.

 "Your responsibility!"

>take pig

 You grab hold of the wriggling animal. It tries to bite you -- then
 again, your Mother would have tried that, too, and most certainly
 succeeded, had you not relieved her of this burden.

 "Now, make it shut up. You see: this is what happens when you don't
 give them a proper upbringing", says Mummy, holding her ears.

>go west

 The Piglet escapes your grip and quickly runs to the other end of the
 compartment to hide under a seat, yet still screaming so loudly,
 there's no mistaking where it's hiding.

 (first opening the door to the corridor)
 "I hope you didn't come to visit only to cut class, Alistair", your
 Mother says dryly as you return to the corridor.

 "But don't be late for Uncle Marty's tea party!" Leo hollers after
 you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor runs east-west between the vestibule and the passenger
 compartment. Mr Larvington's private compartment is to the south.

>go east

 (first opening the the passenger compartment door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Passenger Compartment</span>
 The compartment is poorly lit: the shutters are closed and there's
 only a small lamp by the bed. The rows of seats on two sides of the
 compartment are empty, apart from a bed that has been laid between
 them at the middle. In the bed lies your Mother.

 "Catch it, Alistair!" Mother shouts and points to the Piglet that's
 running wildly between the seats.

 Mummy lifts her head off the pillow with an exaggerated moan. "How
 nice of you to bother with your old, dying mother."
 You can hear the little Pig's cries from under a nearby seat. As you
 step in, the animal springs out from its hiding place and begins
 galloping around the compartment.

>take pig

 The little thing gets scared and louder as you manage to catch it.
 It's desperately trying to flee, but your grip holds.

 The animal is so very loud you can hardly hear your own thoughts. What
 am I supposed to do with this?

 "Don't look at me", your Mother says, "that's your problem."

>hit pig

 But it's so tiny...
 You hesitate.

 You feel someone grabbing your shoulder from behind. It's your brother
 Leo, who leans over to poke at the Piglet.

 "What's the matter, Alice?" he says to you and laughs as the Piglet
 gets more scared, "has your baby turned into a swine?"

 Mum, tell him not to!

 "Don't be such a girl, Alistair. Hit it. Your brother would."

 Leo starts trolling:

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Hush-a-by baby, in Alice's lap!</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">Till the tea's ready, there's time for a nap:</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">When the tea's over, we'll go to war -</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">And now I shall beat you 'till you're achy and sore!</span>

 Your brother adverts his frustration from the pig to you and starts
 punching your arm. "Hit it, Alice, hit it! I would."

>again

 You smack the tiny Piglet in the face. It immediately goes silent,
 stares at you with its frightened eyes and then, fearing for its
 <span class="floydstyle em">life</span>, flees your violent grip.

 Liz!

 You now see it is your little daughter running away from you, not a
 pig. A quick glimpse of her white dress as she dissappears into the
 vestibule in the east end of the car.

 "O-oh!" says Leo, grinning.

 Mother laughs from the bed: "Come on, don't look so shocked, Alistair.
 It's not like you've never done that before... And, like I always used
 to say:

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Speak roughly to your little boy,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">And beat him when he sneezes:</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">He only does it to annoy,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">because he know it teases!</span>

 And look at you and your brother now: you turned out just fine.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 This is a small space at the east-end of the train car, with a door
 leading outside and another through the gangway to the next carriage.
 The passanger compartment extends from here to the west. There's small
 placard of some sort on the gangway entrance. There's a door leading
 outside, but it's locked.

 This is where you saw Liz flee from you, but now she's gone. Instead,
 in front of the train car door appears a figure from thin air. As it
 takes proper shape, you see it's Catherine.

 "You seem to have misplace our daughter." Cat sounds sarcastic. "Just
 keep listening to your mother's advice, and she will run from you
 forever."

 Cat seems to be losing shape again: her body begins to fade, leaving
 visible only her head.

 The head speaks: "Since I'm here, you must want help in some matter.
 That is why you have summoned me, isn't it? Speak, then."

>show assignment to cat

 Catherine takes a look at your paper.

 "What is the Subject? All I know is that it isn't me: for what I've
 become is the object of your <span class="floydstyle em">dream</span>, yours and Liz's -- I've
 so emerged myself in <span class="floydstyle em">us</span>, that without you I seize to exist.
 Should you not think of any more, I -- or the thing I've transformed
 into -- would vanish into thin air. Should I be reborn after that, I
 would certainly be something utterly different, a stranger. Though,
 for myself, I've been a stranger for years now, and what once was, I
 fear, is forever lost to me."

 Her head looks to be fading: it's only her body that's visible to you
 now.

 "So, I think the real question is: What is the Object?"

>go west

 Cat, or what is present of her, follows by your side.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Passenger Compartment</span>
 The compartment is poorly lit: the shutters are closed and there's
 only a small lamp by the bed. The rows of seats on two sides of the
 compartment are empty, apart from a bed that has been laid between
 them at the middle. In the bed lies your Mother.

 "I will try to help you, if there's something you need help with. That
 is, after all, what I do in <span class="floydstyle em">life</span>", your wife says.

>go west

 (first opening the door to the corridor)
 Cat follows.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor runs east-west between the vestibule and the passenger
 compartment. Mr Larvington's private compartment is to the south.

 Catherine says, in all her physical inconsistence: "I won't be here
 forever. Speak now."

 You hear a strange, quiet suffling sound approaching from the eastern
 vestibule.

>speak to catherine

 Perhaps it would be better to ask about something.

>go west

 Cat follows.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 A small space at the end of the train. The corridor leads east from
 here.

 Your wife is increasingly translucent.

 Now you see what the sound was about: a continuous flow of people, all
 dressed in black, arrives from the outside and continues to slowly
 form a queue along the corridor. No one speaks a word -- there's only
 the hushed shuffle of their feet against the linoleum.

>go west

 You can't go in that direction. A corridor runs east from here.

 A dark figure after another joins the line: men, women, people of all
 ages, in shared silence.

>join queue

 You go stand at the end of the line behind a young woman, cutting in
 front of a young man who has just stepped in from the door. The queue
 ahead of you moves slowly forward from the vestibule towards the
 corridor.

 Some of the people glance at you as they step in, most of them don't.

 here to the west. There's small placard of some sort on the gangway
 entrance. There's a door leading outside, but it's locked.

 The gangway to the east opens up, letting in one person, then closes
 again. You see a black velvet curtain behind the door, nothing else,
 as yet another dark traveller enters the corridor connection.

 Cat begins to fade altogether.

 "It's your turn, Alistair. You'd better go now..."

 Catherine has disappeared from sight, but her voice lingers on to say:

 "... you'll be late."

 The gangway opens in front of you.

>score

 There is no score in this story.

>go east
 You are in almost complete darkness for those few seconds it takes you
 to cross the gangway: only the glimpse of the rails speeding by on
 both sides below you as you balance on the swaying bridge connecting
 the two train cars. The noice is overwhelming.
 The black curtain opens up into brightness.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Funeral Car</span>
 The Funeral Director -- a tall, bulky man wearing a tophat and a suite
 he has outgrown many years ago -- stands at the door and bows to you.

 "Let's see some identification", he whispers.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a sweater
   a pen
   the school assignment

>show assignment to director

 You show your paper to the man. He studies it carefully, then
 whispers: "Alright, you can go in."

 The Funeral Director steps aside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Funeral Car</span>
 The room is brighter than the ones earlier on: the shutters on the
 windows are open, letting in the light from the outside. The space is
 crowded with people dressed in black, and there are large black bows
 of silk ribbon tied to the windowpanes. At the centre of the car sits
 a huge mound of red poppies, blocking the view to the far end of the
 carriage. No sign of Liz, at least not in this part of the room,
 although you're sure this is where she must have run.

 The sombrely-attired people seem to be conversing with one another,
 but there is no sound. As you listen more carefully, you make out
 faint talking further back in the car, but you are not sure where it's
 coming from.

 <span class="floydstyle u1">"They told </span><span class="floydstyle em">us</span><span class="floydstyle u1"> you had been to her,</span>

 <span class="floydstyle u1">"Don't let him know she liked him best,</span>

 or the flowers?

>examine funeral party

 All silent and dressed in black.

 This is what the poppies say now:

 <span class="floydstyle u1">"Our notion was that you had been</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">(Before she had this fit)</span>
 <span class="floydstyle u1">An obstacle that came between</span>

 <span class="floydstyle u1">"If I or you should chance to be</span>

 in your path.

 You can't see any such thing.

>search poppies

 "Hey, mister", says a poppy, "what's this? Grabbing <span class="floydstyle em">us</span> things
 like a piece o' flora! Don't hurt to say please..." The flowers are
 annoyed by your rudeness -- but what can they do? They try to bend
 their stems to the side to keep them from snapping under your heavy
 hand. As you rummage the mound you see something under them: a piece
 of red cloth, and, what's this, a hat, and a teacup, and, holding the
 saucer it's on, a hand. You sweep the last poppies to reveal all and
 find, looking straight at you, your Father.

 "Alistair, my boy! Marty's pretty pissed off with you being so late."

 Father takes a sip from his cup and continues: "He's been baking for
 hours."

 Behind the flowers is revealed a tea table with a couple of chairs.
 Father jumps up and moves over to the table. "Sit down, son, and have
 some tea. Marty will be down soon with the apple tarts."

 You say have no time: you have to find Liz.

 "Has the little wife you running errands for her again? You should
 know there's always Time, no matter what the women say -- Time to
 kill, if nothing else."

>kill father

 That will get you nowhere.

 Father pulls a chair for you. "Sit, sit, <span class="floydstyle em">live</span> a little."

 Father picks up the teapot and pours you a cupper. "Now, where's your
 uncle? I'm in mood for an apple tart. And the pot's empty."

>examine father

 Wearing his tophat and a red vest, the man looks very much alive.

 "Very well, don't sit. You're your own man."

 Uncle Marty shows up, carrying a tray full of apple tarts, stepping
 carefully so not the drop them.

 Suddenly the train begins to shake -- people and teacups are tumbling
 over, with them Uncle Marty and his tarts. The train comes to a
 screeching halt. Your teacup, among other china, falls to the floor
 and breaks to pieces.

 Father jumps up. "This is it! Now we're really killing Time!"

 He knocks down the table and takes cover behind it, surprisingly
 managing not to wake up Cousin Dermot. Then he picks up a chair and
 throws it into the eastern vestibule, as to let someone know you are
 prepared to fight back.

 "Duck, Alistair, or you'll get your mind blown off!"

>duck

 You squat behind the tea table.

 You see Leo dashing into the car from behind the enemy lines. That
 figures: when was the last time your brother willingly missed out on a
 fight? He finds himself a cup and saucer and runs to the window,
 squatting under it to stay undetected.

 Uncle Marty is curled up in the corner, desperately hugging his apple
 tarts. "All the Kings horses..."

>take cup

 The teacup has already been picked out for ammunition by Leo.

 Father scouts for tableware. "You take care of the ammunition", he
 says and grabs his teacup.

 <span class="floydstyle u1">"Ready!</span>

 Father throws the cup towards the vestibule, then grabs the teapot.

 "Ready!"

 Everyone has taken cover: your Father squats behind the tea table
 almost squashing Cousin Dermot, who's still sound asleep. Uncle Marty
 is curled up at the other side of the room, hugging his apple tarts
 and mumbling to himself. The funeral party is trying to hide by lying
 as flat as possible. Leo is the only one doesn't bother shielding
 himself: he leans against the wall by the window and grins.

 Most of the tableware is smashed to shards. On the floor is the tea
 tray.

 "Aim!" Father shouts, and he lifts up his teapot and Leo a saucer.
 "Fire!" Your family in arms throw the ammunition towards the enemy.

 Your cousin is curled up behind the table, still fast asleep,
 squeezing his teacup close to his chest.

 Father is getting aggravated: "There's no time for your gimmicks,
 Alistair -- reload, now!"

>take teacup

 Dermot has a near death grip on the teacup, but you manage to pry it
 out of his hands without waking him up.

 You see your Father is starting to look nervous, squatting there, able
 to do nothing.

>aim teacup

 You lift up Dermot's cup.

 Your Father protests your selfishness: "Come on, son, keep them

 Leo shouts at you: "Get a move on, Alice! <span class="floydstyle em">We</span> haven't got all

 hugs the tartlets.

 Your Father still needs ammunition.

 The Funeral Director who is grouched on the floor nearby notices
 you've run out of ammunition. He reaches for his pocket and pulls out
 an Egg.

 "Use this, sir."

>take egg

 The man gently passes the Egg to you. "It will break", he whispers and
 slides back under the chair.

 Father, looking more nervous than before, turns to you and your
 brother and says: "Listen, men. The enemy is closing in on <span class="floydstyle em">us</span>
 and <span class="floydstyle em">we</span> are out of ammunition. You have a choice to make", and
 he looks straight at you when he says this, "kill or be killed." He
 turns his demanding eyes to the Egg.

 ... but it's so fragile, you almost say.

 the King's men can't put them together again."

>fire egg

 You take a last look at the fragile little thing in the palm of your
 hand, then throw it.

 Everything goes quiet. Cousin Dermot almost wakes up but doesn't get
 his eyes open, so he goes back to sleep.

 Uncle Marty is curled up by the wall, mumbling to himself: "All the
 kings horses and all the kings men couldn't..."

 Leo is leaning onto the wall by the window and laughing as the smashed
 Egg drips down from above the vestibule entrance. Leo catches a drip
 with his finger and licks it. "Yummy."

 So fragile...

>examine egg

 You see it's Liz.

>take liz

 You step out from behind the tea table.

 Your brother squeezes the dripping remains of the Egg in his fist and
 holds his hand so high up you can't reach it. "You want this? Well,
 come and get it."

 Leo takes off to the eastern vestibule.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vestibule</span>
 This is a small dark space at the east-end of the funeral car, with a
 door leading outside and another through the gangway to the next

 Your brother pushes through the gangway into the next car.

 The unheated carriage feels damp. The south wall consists of a pair of
 sliding doors for loading the van.

 Leonard runs ahead of you, jokingly grouching behind boxes and crates.
 "Catch me if you can!"

 The Egg drips from between his fingers, stains the floor.

>take egg

 Leo looks at the Egg, then you, and says: "You want your precious
 little baby?"

 He shakes the dripping Egg in his hand.

 "I'll play you for it."

 Leo searches his pocket and pulls out something, quickly hiding it
 behind his back so you cannot see what it is. Then he extends his arm
 in front of him, fist closed, and counts:

 "One -- two -- three!"

 Leo grins, victorious: his choice was scissors. "Scissors cut paper!"
 He holds down your hand, makes cut in the paper just to show you who
 won, and Leo turns his eyes to the smashed Egg in his hand, tilts his
 head theatrically and says: "Looks like Alice's little cuddly toy
 stays with me... Oh, Mr Guard, sir!"

 Leo stashes the Egg behind his back, giving you a discrete wink.

 "Mr Guard, as I, sir, would never consider such a vile deed as
 smuggling luggage out of the luggage van, you might nonetheless wish
 to keep an eye on my brother, there -- he is young and prone to
 mischief."

 The Guard looks at you, his whiskers trembling. "Let's see it then,
 good sir, your luggage. No taking it out."

 He steps closer, and Leo slips out the door, unnoticed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Unfinished Tunnel</span>
 This part of the sewer system is still under construction. Where
 you're standing, the walls are still bare, only the temporary
 reinforcement beams are in place. An earthy smell is in the cold air:
 you see the ground here is not of solid stone but of soil and rubble,
 with broken roots of trees sticking out from the walls above you. The
 construction lights reveal the tunnel extends far back west and into
 darkness ahead in the east.

 The train stands here, hissing calmly. The locomotive is the east and
 the carriages are lined up west from there. Right here is the
 connection between the tender and the luggage van. The doors to the
 luggage van are open.

 Further back into the west you see the wall has partly collapsed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Unfinished Tunnel</span>
 Part of the wall has collapsed down, right at the edge of steel
 reinforcement rings that extend to here from the west. As you look up,
 you see it's not only tree roots sticking out of the soft wall, but
 old, decomposed wooden planks. Suddenly you realise where the sewer
 line is being dug: under the town's old graveyard. The dirt and rubble
 from the wall form a big pile by the wall.

 The train extends eastward, you are by the passenger car at the west
 end.

 It is time for you to sentence yourself, Mr Liddell. Let's see your
 words."

>shower paper to larvington

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>show paper to larvington

 Mr Larvington carefully studies the documents.

 Mr Larvington takes a look. "U-hum, yes. You have collected the words.
 Now, you sentence."

 Press SPACE for your sentencing.

 He hands you the document back.


 You look at the paper:

 <span class="floydstyle em">dream  life  live  we</span>

 There's only room for a three-word sentence, and only if you scribble
 very neatly.

>SAVE
>cf12
 %% Enter a save filename to write:

>we dream life




 The sentence you have chosen:

 WE DREAM LIFE

 If you stand on your conviction, answer "YES" now to sentence
 yourself. If you wish to revise your sentence, answer "NO" to rewrite
 it.

>no


>we live dream




 The sentence you have chosen:

 WE LIVE DREAM

 If you stand on your conviction, answer "YES" now to sentence
 yourself. If you wish to revise your sentence, answer "NO" to rewrite
 it.

>yes



 "You hereby sentence yourself to..." says Mr Larvington, and is no
 longer here.

 All is very bright.



 The water is black. For a moment you think your feet hit the riverbed.

 The light is above you.

>go up
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Drifting down the stream</span>
 This black ribbon divides the town in half. On the southern shore, the
 suburbs, to the north, the hills.

 You are in a small white row boat. It's drifting slowly with the
 current towards the sea somewhere in the western distance. And in
 there beside you: Liz.

 You have one more choice to make:

 Do you swim to shore or stay in the boat with Liz?

 Choose SWIM or STAY.

>stay


 You wrap your arms around your little girl.



 Please press SPACE to drift on.


 <span class="floydstyle u1">In a Wonderland they lie,</span>

 <span class="floydstyle u1">Life, what is it but a dream?</span>The lights of the ambulance
 flash on the shore -- Catherine stands there, peering at the river.
 Someone brings her a shawl: the air is turning chilly. The boat drifts
 forward.




 The game ends here.

 The choice presented to you in the boat depends on the sentence you
 wrote. If you wish, you can go back and rewrite the sentence. You can
 also undo only your final choice.

 background stands Catherine and watches her daughter being
 resuscitated. She looks at you for a while in terror and wraps her
 arms around you. Liz doesn't wake up. From the corner of your eye you
 see a glimpse of a white boat disappearing into the western distance.
