 Deprivation A Story of Obsession and Transferance by Michael Coorlim

 It's three A.M. on Monday the 12th, and you're still awake.


 It... it wasn't a good weekend, in a way that doesn't really seem real
 yet.
 Like it's some nightmare you could wake up from if you could just get
 to sleep.
 But how can you sleep?  There's got to be some way to fix things.
 There has to
 be.  It can't end like this.  You just have to, you know, figure out
 what it
 is, do that, and everything will be okay again.  Like it used to be.


 Then again you have to be at work in four hours, and you didn't really
 get any
 sleep last night, either.  Maybe you should just try to get your mind
 off
 things?


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Apartment</span>

 Your studio apartment is lit by the soft ever-present glow of the city
 lights
 coming in through the window, flat-screen television set below the
 sill to
 avoid screen glare.  For most of the year you've lived here, your
 apartment has
 [More]

 you don't have much in
 the way of furnishings... just the bed, a bookcase you found on the
 curb, and
 the scuffed coffee table next to it.  North, past the door leading out
 to the
 building's hall, is the apartment's kitchen.


 On the coffee table you see your laptop, your coffee mug, and your
 cell phone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Your apartment's kitchen is fairly cramped.  Your fridge is against
 the north
 wall next to the bathroom door, across from the counter containing the
 sink
 next to the oven.  There's little under the counter, except for a
 single
 cramped cabinet.  You'd probably cook more often if you had more
 counterspace,
 but you just get so frustrated when you try... there's barely enough
 room for
 the toaster and coffee machine.  It's just easier to order out.

 You can see an overflowing trash bin here.

 In the kitchen sink you see some dishes.

 On the kitchen counter you see a coffee machine and a toaster.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Exits:</span> <span class="floydstyle u2">north</span>   south


 You turn on the sink's faucet, turning the mug over in your hands as
 the water
 runs over it, scrubbing the insides with a sponge until the white
 ceramic is
 spotless.  It makes you feel slightly better to have accomplished
 something.
 Briefly.

 You clean your dirty dishes.  It doesn't take very long, which was
 more or less
 the point of only having one of each dish.  That, and making sure that
 you
 clean them regularly, though on that count it hasn't been quite as
 successful.
 When you're done, you put them neatly away in the cabinet under the
 counter.

 Your trash bin is at that point where every time you throw something
 away,
 you're playing that delicate game where if you can balance it on top
 of the
 pile, you don't have to take it out yet.

 It's a piece of chocolate buttercream birthday cake wrapped in clear

 Just looking at it hits you with a pang of guilt and regret, which you
 quickly
 stuff down into a deep dark recess.

 You strip down, get into the shower, and turn the water on.  It takes
 a few
 moments for the water to heat up and once it has you let the lukewarm
 stream
 run over your body, washing away the troubles and sweat of your
 insomnia.  For
 a few minutes you just stand there, head resting against the wall,
 washing the
 water pool around your feet before going down the drain.  When you're
 able to
 summon forth the motivation to continue, you use the shampoo to lather
 up your
 hair, then soap up your loofah and suds up the rest of your body.

 Somehow the rough texture of the loofah makes you feel cleaner, so you
 scrub
 hard until your flesh is red and raw.  Then you rinse out your hair,
 wash the
 soap off your body, and turn off the water.  You towel off and get
 dressed
 again, feeling somewhat better.  Cleaner, at any rate.

 Your apartment's kitchen is fairly cramped.  Your fridge is against
 the north
 wall next to the bathroom door, across from the counter containing the
 sink
 next to the oven.  There's little under the counter, except for a
 single
 cramped cabinet.  You'd probably cook more often if you had more
 counterspace,
 but you just get so frustrated when you try... there's barely enough
 room for
 the toaster and coffee machine.  It's just easier to order out.

 You can see an overflowing trash bin here.

 On the kitchen counter you see a coffee machine, your coffee mug, and
 a

 In the overflowing trash bin you see a wilted head of lettuce, a
 mostly empty
 mustard bottle, an expired carton of milk, and an empty egg carton.

 Your studio apartment is lit by the soft ever-present glow of the city
 lights
 coming in through the window, flat-screen television set below the
 sill to
 avoid screen glare.  For most of the year you've lived here, your
 apartment has
 been little more than a place to store your things, so you don't have
 much in
 the way of furnishings... just the bed, a bookcase you found on the
 curb, and
 the scuffed coffee table next to it.  North, past the door leading out
 to the
 building's hall, is the apartment's kitchen.


 On the coffee table you see your laptop and your cell phone.

 By day, St.  Phillip's Cemetery is a landscape of beautiful green
 lawns and
 well-spaced headstones criss-crossed by neat gravel paths.  At night,
 it looks
 far more dark and foreboding, lit only by sporadically spaced lights
 that
 illuminate only the paths immediately around them, leaving the
 gravestones as
 dark shapes lurking in darkness.  They seem to do a better job
 illuminating
 your apartment.

 Unable to stop yourself, you spend half an hour pouring over dozens of
 increasingly passionate and disjointed emails, tracking the emotional
 journey
 from loving and hopeful to bitter and resented.  They tell a story
 within-a-
 story, and you do your best to analyze each line, each phrase, each
 word for
 deeper meaning, for clues as to their sender's true mental state.  You
 hope to
 find something that you missed, something to give you insight into the
 writers'
 current mental space, but in the end all you find is heart-wrenching
 despair.

 Ah, this must be Tiamont Plaza. And over there is Rowena's Coffee
 House. Hopefully you're not late.

 This morning you received a note (pushed under your door like your
 life has suddenly become a spy movie) asking you to come here
 regarding your sister. Who has been dead for four years as of today.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Press any key...</span>

 <span class="floydstyle header">Meld</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by David Whyld
 Release 1 / Serial number 150730 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tiamont Plaza</span>
 This is Tiamont Plaza, the heart of the city's Upias District (named
 after some long-dead scholar, you think). Few people are about, and
 those you see hurry past quickly, as if unwilling to spend any more
 time here than they really have to. A large stone statue has been
 erected here and looks to have become a target for the locals and
 their graffiti.

 To the north (though blocked by a large gate) is Morring Row, south is
 Belmont Avenue, southeast is a winding path between tall buildings,
 west lies Rowena's Coffee House and northwest is City Library.

>examine statue

 A once impressive statue, though now rather worn, of the famed
 historian Willem Wildemore, one hand raised as he delivers his classic
 <span class="floydstyle em">Believe My Words</span> speech. The locals have defaced it with
 graffiti.

>examine graffiti

 Badly written and illegible in parts. You're probably better off not
 wasting too much time on this.

>examine me

 Your name is Arianah Charles, you're 25 years old and you can meld.
 You used to work in finance but since you discovered what you are,
 employment is no longer necessary. You're single and likely to remain
 so for the foreseeable future; when you can do the things you can do,
 it's not a good idea to get too close to people.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a note
   an ID card
   some lipstick

>read note

 This was pushed under your door this morning. It simply tells you to
 go to Rowena's Coffee House on Tiamont Plaza, find an empty booth and
 wait there. Someone will contact you then.

 Now, normally you'd have assumed this was some kind of practical joke
 by the neighbourhood kids and just thrown it in the trash, but it also
 mentioned your sister. Who has been dead for four years. And today, of
 all days, is her birthday.

>examine id card

 A piece of laminated card which fits neatly into your palm and lists
 your name, age, sex, address and the fact that you are 'clean' (i.e.
 not a wanted felon).

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rowena's Coffee House</span>
 One of many coffee houses that have sprung up across the city offering
 cheap, barely drinkable (in your opinion) coffee to people with more
 money than common sense. This one is of fairly typical design:
 numerous tables and booths, an harassed looking waitress (the only
 employee that you can see) and an atmosphere thick with the smell of
 burnt coffee beans. Only one booth is free at this moment, this being
 due southwest.

 To the east lies Tiamont Square.

>smell

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>go southwest

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cosy Booth</span>
 A cramped and not altogether pleasant booth, though you guess in this
 kind of establishment you're not paying for quality so much as cheap
 coffee. The booth has been defaced more times than you care to count,
 though some of the graffiti is quite amusing.

 You can leave the booth to the northeast.

>examine graffiti

 It mainly involves the city council and the people in charge. It
 features a goat, a nun's outfit and... well, you might be better off
 not reading the rest of it.

 You hear footsteps from outside the booth and a man hurries in after
 you, looks around nervously, and says, "I don't think I was followed
 but it doesn't pay to be careless. The stakes are high, after all."

 "Are you the man who sent me the note?"

 "Me? Heavens no! That was my associate. I'm just a, um, intermediary
 you might say. Miss Charles, I'm led to believe you are a most unusual
 individual possessing an ability some believe to be impossible. My
 associate wishes me to observe a demonstration of this ability so he
 can note your... um... worth."

 "I don't do demonstrations, Mr...?"

 "Frobisher. Hans Frobisher. And I believe in this instance, Miss
 Charles, you might be willing to make such a demonstration. It
 involves your sister."

 Your breath catches in your throat. "My sister is dead."

 "Are you quite certain of that?"

 Which is a strange question because yes, you're very certain. You were
 there when she died. It's not the sort of thing you'd be mistaken
 about. "What do you know about my sister?"

 "First the demonstration, if you will. My associate was very firm on
 that. Here." He hands you a ring. "See what you can make of this."

>examine ring

 A plain brass ring, worn by the passage of many years.

>meld ring

 Your head aches but nothing else seems to happen. You get the distinct
 feeling you're doing it wrong. Something is missing.

>examine lipstick

 Shockingly red and not your thing at all. You must have bought it
 without thinking.

>meld ring to note

 I only understood you as far as wanting to meld the ring.

>about

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine ear

 You can't see any such thing.

>rub ring

 You achieve nothing by this.

>look

 A cramped and not altogether pleasant booth, though you guess in this
 kind of establishment you're not paying for quality so much as cheap
 coffee. The booth has been defaced more times than you care to count,
 though some of the graffiti is quite amusing. Frobisher sits in the
 far corner of the booth.

 You can leave the booth to the northeast.

>ask frobisher about ring

 There is no reply.

>talk to frobisher

 "What can you make with the ring?" Frobisher asks.

>make earring

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine booth

 The cramped booth you're currently seated in. The sooner you're out of
 here, the better.

>meld ring with note

 You concentrate on the ring and the note and bring your meld ability
 to bear, but nothing happens. The items cannot be melded with each
 other.

 "A good try," says Frobisher, "but that's not what I had in mind."

>examine graffiti

 It mainly involves the city council and the people in charge. It
 features a goat, a nun's outfit and... well, you might be better off
 not reading the rest of it.

>examine goat

 You can't see any such thing.

>meld ring with graffiti

 Unfortunately, your meld ability is limited in that you are unable to
 meld something that you are not physically holding. Also, the items in
 question can only be of a certain size - no melding buildings or
 aircraft for you!

 You have heard rumours of other people, whose gift is far more
 advanced than your own, who can meld items simply by looking at them,
 but perhaps they are simply rumours and nothing more.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a ring
   a note
   an ID card
   some lipstick

>meld lipstick and ring

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>meld lipstick with ring

 You concentrate on the lipstick and the ring and bring your meld
 ability to bear, but nothing happens. The items cannot be melded with
 each other.

 "A good try," says Frobisher, "but that's not what I had in mind."

>examine lipstick

 Shockingly red and not your thing at all. You must have bought it
 without thinking.

>buy coffee

 You can't see any such thing.

>order coffee

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>meld  ring with waitress

 Unfortunately, your meld ability is limited in that you are unable to

>wear lipstick

 No, it makes you look like you make a living dancing on tables. You
 honestly don't know why you bought it.

>break lipstick

 Violence won't solve this one, I'm afraid.

>unmeld lipstick

 You concentrate on the lipstick and your meld ability takes hold,
 tearing apart the molecules of the lipstick and reforming them into a
 bracelet and a chisel.

>examine bracelet

 A metal bracelet which feels very cold to the touch.

>examine chisel

 A rusted and somewhat battered chisel which you got when you demelded
 the lipstick.

>unmeld ring

 You concentrate on the ring and bring your meld ability to bear, but
 nothing happens. It seems the ring hasn't been melded from anything
 and therefore it can't be unmelded into something else.

>meld ring with bracelet

 You concentrate on the ring and the bracelet and bring your meld
 ability to bear, but nothing happens. The items cannot be melded with
 each other.

 "A good try," says Frobisher, "but that's not what I had in mind."

>unmeld note

 You concentrate on the note and bring your meld ability to bear, but
 nothing happens. It seems the note hasn't been melded from anything
 and therefore it can't be unmelded into something else.

>unmeld id

 You concentrate on the ID card and bring your meld ability to bear,
 but nothing happens. It seems the ID card hasn't been melded from
 anything and therefore it can't be unmelded into something else.

>meld id with ring

 You bring your meld ability to focus on the ID card and note. You
 watch as they become melded together... their molecules becoming
 one... transforming into something else...

 Leaving you holding a key.

 "Very good," says Frobisher, his eyes aglow. "You made a key, and not
 just a normal key either. Tell me, can you guess what lock it might
 open?"

 "The gate outside the cafe would be my first guess."

 "Why don't you try it and see?"

 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

>go north

 You need to do something about the locked gate first.

>open gate

 You slip the key into the lock and turn it. There is a <span class="floydstyle em">click!</span>
 sound from the gate and the key literally sinks into the gate. You try
 to grab hold of it before it can be absorbed - it's your ID card,
 after all! - but it's gone.

 A moment later, the gate swings open.

>talk to frobisher

 "The gate swallowed the key!" you say (which sounds worryingly weird
 to you, like the gate came to life and literally ate the key). "My ID
 card was part of that. How do I get it back?"

 "I'm merely here as a go-between for my associate," says Frobisher,
 "so I'm afraid I don't know. However, my associate mentioned that once
 the gate was open, you would be able to find an item on the other side
 that would give you your ID card back."

 Your head is spinning. "That doesn't make any damn sense..."

 "Nevertheless, that is what my associate said. If you find this item -
 whatever it may be, he didn't tell me - bring it to me and we will see
 what can be done about it."

 "Or maybe I should just go home and leave you and your crazy associate
 out of my life..."

 Frobisher frowns. "Without your ID card? I wouldn't advise that, Miss.
 Charles. The council tend to frown on citizens who have 'lost' their
 ID cards."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Morring Row</span>
 To the northwest stands the grandly-titled Emperor Tavern, a massive
 structure looming over the whole of Morring Row and putting everything
 else into the shade. In truth, there's very little here aside from the
 tavern, a park off to the northeast and Tiamont Plaza to the south. An
 alley can be seen off to the west, running alongside the tavern.

 Someone walking past mutters, "Who left that damn gate open? It's
 locked for a reason, you know," and gives you a pointed look before
 disappearing into the park.

 <span class="floydstyle em">For more information on your melding ability, type 'Meld</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Info'</span>.

>meld info

 No one really knows how melding works. Is it a genetic defect? The
 result of shady experiments? Latent psychic powers? Even you don't
 know and you've lived with it all your life.

 It doesn't run in the family because your mother didn't have it and
 neither did your sister. You never met your father but he was a
 low-life thief who died after being shot whilst robbing a jewellery
 store. If he could meld, he'd have sold his ability to the highest
 bidder and to hell with the risks involved or the morality of doing
 such a thing.

 Melding has limits, though it tends to differ from person to person.
 Some (like you) can only meld items they have physical hold of; some
 (like you) can only meld one item with another; some (like you) can
 only meld an item they've seen before (so no melding nuclear weapons
 or futuristic laser guns!)

 Melding is random - something that has frustrated melders for years
 now. While it would be the ultimate source of income if it could be
 directed, melding unfortunately doesn't work that way. So while you
 might want to meld together a cheese grater and an iron and have it
 produce a cheque for a million credits, you can't. What you end up
 with when you meld two items together is unknown until the melding
 process is over and done with.

 Most melders can only meld. Some (like you) can also unmeld - or
 demeld - items; i.e. meld two items together then unmeld them into
 their base items. All melders are limited, however, in that they can
 only demeld items they themselves have melded together.

 Except you. You can demeld anything that's previously been melded, no
 matter who did the melding.

 Technically, melding isn't illegal but it's definitely not something
 you want to go around advertising you can do. While no one can simply
 meld a nuclear weapon out of two random items, the general public
 believe all the terrible stories they've heard about melders over the
 years: melding two people together (and no, you can't meld living
 matter) to form a third person; melding harmless items into bombs;
 melding killing random people close to the melder; and so on...

 You're sure the stories of melders being abducted by the guards and
 held in secret government labs are just pure rumour, but it doesn't
 pay to take risks.

>examine tavern

 A little <span class="floydstyle em">too</span> grandiose for your liking, but there's no
 denying it's an impressive site.

>examine park

 You can't see much of it from here.

>examine alley

 A grimy alley running along the side of the Emperor Tavern.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alley</span>
 City alleys are supposed to be cleaned every day, but apparently the
 crew responsible for this alley didn't get the memo. It's knee-deep in
 trash and smells like an open sewer. Just being here makes you feel
 queasy.

 A breath of fresh air flows from the east.

>examine trash

 Some of it looks - and smells! - like it's been here for months, if
 not years. The smell is enough to make your eyes water.

>search trash

 You find nothing of interest.

>take trash

 You wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. Literally.

>go east

 You can't go that way.

>go southwest

 You can't go that way.

>go northwest

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Emperor Tavern</span>
 Before today, you'd only heard of the Emperor Tavern but never visited
 it. It has a somewhat ominous reputation which might be all rumour and
 no substance, but seeing it from here you can well imagine its
 reputation is well-founded.

 What you see is a large room, massive in fact, in which literally
 hundreds of people sit around circular tables, drinking beer, smoking
 all manner of illegal substances, and gambling. Yes, gambling. Banned
 within the city limits it might be, but here you see it in abundance.

 You can make your way deeper into the tavern to the north, west or
 northwest or you can return to Morring Row to the southeast.

 As you step inside the tavern, and before you've had time to properly
 look around, a man almost walks into.

 "Terribly sorry," he says, not sounding it one bit, then walks away.

 Hmm... curious. You wonder why he pushed a slip of paper into your
 hand...?

>examine slip

 It reads, simply, 'Another test. Let's see what you can
 <span class="floydstyle em">un</span>make of this'.

>unmake slip

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>unmeld slip

 You concentrate on the slip of paper and your meld ability takes hold,
 tearing apart the molecules of the slip of paper and reforming them
 into a mirror and a passcard.

 Is this what Frobisher wanted from you? Maybe you should go back and
 speak to him about either the mirror or the passcard and see what he
 has to say.

>examine passcard

 You don't tend to see many of these around nowadays (ID cards have
 replaced them), but you know they were once used to access military
 installations and the like.

 Your own face peers back at you. You look tired.

 Gone. Frobisher is gone! Damn the man and whatever game he's playing
 with you. First he encourages you to meld your ID card with the ring
 he gave you, and now he disappears on you.

 This is bad. This is very bad. You need to get to the bottom of what
 is going on here and, just as important, you need to get your ID card
 back before you're stopped by the guard. You, of all people, can
 ill-afford to have the council taking an interest in your background.

 You wonder if Frobisher left anything for you here in the booth...

>look at passcard in mirror

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine graffiti

 It mainly involves the city council and the people in charge. It
 features a goat, a nun's outfit and... well, you might be better off
 not reading the rest of it.

 Hmmm... what's that at the bottom? You peer closer and see this
 written down: <span class="floydstyle em">"apologies for leaving suddenly. called away on</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Winding Path</span>
 Little sunlight reaches this winding path due to the tall buildings on
 either side, buildings which seem to lean over, almost touching, above
 you. This is an old part of the city, with nothing here having been
 built in the last hundred years.

 Northwest you can see Tiamont Plaza, to the south is an abandoned
 house and southeast is Mawbury Lane.

>examine house

 One of the many ruins which populate the city. No sooner is one fixed
 (or knocked down) than another needs working on.

>se

 As you make your way towards Mawbury Lane, a hulking man emerges
 suddenly from the shadows and blocks the path. Down one side of his
 face is a jagged scar and his eyes are mad and staring.

 "Going somewhere, sweetheart?" he grunts. "Oh, I don't think so, 'cos
 this way-" He nods to the southeast. "I own it. Jacob's the name. So
 if you want to go that way, you gotta pay the toll."

 "I never knew there was a toll on this road."

 "There ain't. Not officially. But unofficially? Oh yeah. Now, don't go
 worrying about paying me in credits 'cos I know they can be traced
 easily enough, but jewellery? Yeah, jewellery is fine. Easy to fence,
 you know."

 "And if I don't pay you anything at all?"

 His eyes narrow. "Then you better just go back the way you came 'cos
 you sure ain't passing through here."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Abandoned House</span>
 You're in the ruins of an abandoned house which looks to have been
 uninhabited for longer than you've been alive. The walls are damp, the
 ceiling has collapsed (in fact, most of it is on the floor) and the
 floor creaks beneath you. One especially large gap to the north leads
 out to the winding path. Clinging to one wall, though out of reach, is
 the remnants of a staircase.

>examine staircase

 Part of a staircase, clinging to the wall. It's quite a way out of
 reach.

>examine walls

 Crumbly and damp. It's a wonder the place hasn't already collapsed. In
 one wall is a jagged crack.

 A crack a few inches wide. You could reach inside if you wanted,

 The smell of old books greets you: while hardly a pungent aroma, it's
 certainly cloying. This is City Library: a sprawling array of
 bookshelves as far as the eye can see, watched over by a scowling
 librarian who seems to regard visitors to the library with the same
 kind of contempt normally reserved for serial killers.

>examine librarian

 An elderly fellow with papery skin who seems to treat the library as
 his own personal domain. Something about his demeanour indicates he
 takes slights very personally and knows how to bear a grudge.

 Without knowing exactly which book you're looking for - if indeed you

 To the northwest stands the grandly-titled Emperor Tavern, a massive
 structure looming over the whole of Morring Row and putting everything

 tavern, a park off to the northeast and Tiamont Plaza to the south. An
 alley can be seen off to the west, running alongside the tavern.

 It is surprisingly dark in Freemoor Park, though the trees, of which

 rises an odour foul enough to make your eyes water.

 To the southwest lies Morring Row.

 There is a disturbance just outside the Emperor Tavern. You and
 several other passers by stop to watch as an old man, clearly drunk,
 is expelled from the premises by bouncers. He staggers, almost falls,
 then spins on his heel (which almost causes him to fall over again)
 and shakes his fist at the bouncers.

 "Lousy stinking tavern anyway!" he yells. "Wouldn't drink there if you
 paid me!"

 "Go home, Talbot, you've had enough for day," one of the bouncer says.

 "Don't tell me what to do!" the man Talbot shouts. "You stole it from
 me, didn't you? You and your lousy boss! You... you..."

 He yells a few more choice phrases, some of them very colourful, then
 runs out of steam and staggers away in the direction of Freemoor Park.
 You give him a wide berth - the odour of sour beer emanating from him
 is quite pungent.

 He's so drunk he can barely stand upright, and the smell he's giving
 off is enough to mask the odour coming from the pond.

 Before today, you'd only heard of the Emperor Tavern but never visited
 it. It has a somewhat ominous reputation which might be all rumour and
 no substance, but seeing it from here you can well imagine its
 reputation is well-founded.

 What you see is a large room, massive in fact, in which literally
 hundreds of people sit around circular tables, drinking beer, smoking
 all manner of illegal substances, and gambling. Yes, gambling. Banned
 within the city limits it might be, but here you see it in abundance.

 You can make your way deeper into the tavern to the north, west or
 northwest or you can return to Morring Row to the southeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Emperor Tavern { North }</span>
 Against the back wall of the tavern are a group of strange individuals
 engaged in some kind of staring contest at each other over a table. No
 one moves, no one says a word. All is deathly silent.

 You can leave to the south when you wish.

>take all drugs

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine table

 The table itself is ordinary, but there's a jewel of some kind in the
 centre of it which draws your attention. Is this what the staring
 contest is about?

>examine jewel

 You don't know what kind of jewel this is, but it's certainly very
 pretty and likely worth a small fortune.

>examine individuals

 From the way they're dressed, you're guessing they're members of one
 of the strange cults you've heard talk about. According to news
 reports, they're supposed to be very dangerous and passersby are
 advised not to approach them.

>take jewel

 The moment you reach out to take the jewel, it flickers, as if it
 wasn't there at all. The men at the table cease their staring contest
 and look at you.

 "Sacrilege!" shouts one.

 "Blasphemy!" shouts another.

 A third reaches into his robes for what you guess is a knife, so you
 decide it's time to go and-

 But you stop. One of the men has fixed his eyes onto yours and you
 find you can't move anywhere. He nods for you to sit down and you do.
 He indicates for you to place the jewel back on the table and you do.

 He looks deep into your eyes, peeling back every secret, every memory.
 He discovers your meld ability and realises how useful it can be.

 You spend a long, long time at the table staring into the eyes of the
 strange man...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Emperor Tavern { West }</span>
 This area of the tavern seems a little more refined than the main area
 to the east. Here, the customers - or clientele - sit around sipping
 wine, talking in hushed voices and discussing the works of art
 adorning the walls. It's a welcome change after the noise just a short
 walk to the east.

 Every eye in the place, and there are quite a few, look at you and a
 deathly silence falls. You could literally hear a pin drop here.

 But when it becomes apparent that you aren't going to say or do
 anything dramatic, the clientele seem to lose interest in you and
 resume their quiet whisperings.

>examine art

 You're not really a fan of modern art so most of this leaves you cold.
 However, there's one painting of a king staring into the sun which
 quite catches your eye.

>examine king

 As you stare at the painting, you find your attention being drawn to
 the sun, in the same way as the king's attention is drawn to it. It

 Ahead of you, to the northwest is an archway which looks like it might
 have been removed from an ancient monastery or cathedral, beyond which
 you see... nothing. It must be a simple trick of the light but the
 area beyond the archway doesn't show up at all. You notice that you're
 the only one here - apparently all the other customers of the tavern
 prefer to give this area a wide berth. Returning to the rest of the
 tavern is possible by going southeast.

 As you try to strike up a conversation with a well-dressed gentleman,
 his equally well-dressed wife quickly steps in and says to you, "Don't
 even <span class="floydstyle em">think</span> about speaking to my husband. He's horribly
 drunk."

 "Pish, darling," says the husband, "I've barely drinked a touch!"

 She arches an eyebrow at him. "Indeed. Take two of these." She shoves
 some tablets into his hand, one of which disappears into his mouth and
 the rest he drops. "They'll soon sober you up."

 The husband snorts, then coughs violently! "Egads! Someone called an
 ambulance! I believe she's only bally well tried to poison me!"

 The wife rolls her eyes. "They're anti-alcohol tablets, you fool." She
 takes him by the hand and leads him away. "If you're going to make a

 Silence descends following their departure.

 the chest. "You trying to kill me?"

 "Just sober you up," you say.

 "Well, it certainly did that." He groans. "I need a drink after that."
 At your expression, he quickly adds, "Just a soft drink. I think
 there's a coffee house close by. I'll try that."

 He puts his hand out and you shake it. "Name's Oscar Talbot. You?

 My head is still throbbing."

 "No need to thank me. You needed it more than I did."

 He laughs, then groans. "Agh. Laughing's not a good idea when your
 head's throbbing like mine is." He massages his forehead. "Unusual for
 someone to help out a complete stranger like that, Miss. You ever need
 a favour doing, just holler. I'll hear you."

 "You mentioned that something had been stolen from you in the Emperor
 Tavern."

 "I did?" Talbot rubs his head again and his good cheer fades. "Yes, I
 did. A photo of my daughter."

>again

 Talbot says, "She died. Her name was Annabel. She was young when it
 happened, and it broke my wife's heart. She left me and I haven't seen
 her since, though I've had my brain in the bottom of a bottle for a
 long time now so I don't blame her for leaving."

 He goes quiet for a minute, staring into space, before finally saying,
 "I gambled with some very dangerous people there. They took my money
 off me, but that wasn't what they wanted. They wanted something
 precious to me. The photo." Talbot sighs. "I kept it with me as a
 reminder. After I'd lost all my money, they offered to double
 everything if I put the photo up as collateral. And I lost. I lost the
 last photo of my daughter."

 "Why would they want the photo?"

 "Because of who they are. <span class="floydstyle em">What</span> they are. Mind thieves. Human
 suffering is like a drug to them. Oh, what a fool I was. Gambling away
 something like that. But I'll get it back from them one day."

 "More gambling?"

 "No, I've learnt my lesson there. Anyway, they cheated. The game was
 rigged. They switched the cards around when I wasn't looking and left
 me with a useless hand. No, lady, when I get the photo back from them,
 it won't be via gambling. And they won't be walking away from it to
 suck up someone else's misery, I can tell you."

>again

 Talbot says, "Sorry, I've told you too much. I'm just an old drunk and
 fool, talking my mouth off. Forget I said anything."

 "Maybe I can help," you say.

 "Against them? No, don't even think about it. They're dangerous. They
 could have killed me, but I guess it amuses them to leave me alive
 knowing how miserable I am now they've taken from me the one thing I
 miss the most. Stay away from them."

 Jacob knocks the rock out of your hand.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">City Library</span>
 The smell of old books greets you: while hardly a pungent aroma, it's
 certainly cloying. This is City Library: a sprawling array of
 bookshelves as far as the eye can see, watched over by a scowling
 librarian who seems to regard visitors to the library with the same
 kind of contempt normally reserved for serial killers.

>talk to librarian

 He looks at you, sighs deeper, as if the very idea of talking to you
 is a gargantuan effort, and says "Can I help you with anything?"

 "I was just-"

 "Feel free to browse the bookshelves if you like. We have an excellent
 collection of Dromond's novels and a rare first by Edias. All very
 interesting works."

 "Well, I was-"

 "Or local history? Does that interest you? If so, have a look at some
 of the bookshelves. I'm sure something will take your fancy."

 "I was-"

 "Ah, my apologies. Under new library rules, I am only allowed to spend
 a certain amount of time with each customer, and your time is at an
 end. Now, if you don't mind, I have other work to attend to."

 "But-"

 But you're wasting your breath. The librarian clearly has no interest
 in talking to you.

>examine dromond

>search books

 Without knowing exactly which book you're looking for - if indeed you

 As soon as this happens, it blocks the view of the jewel from one of
 the men, and something very strange happens.

 The jewel flickers, as if it's not really there at all! Then it fades
 away altogether.

 "How dare you!" one of the men cries, springing to his feet. "You have
 disrupted a most important experiment!

 "Oh, pish, Pavlaroka," another of the men says. "If someone placing a
 mirror on the table can disrupt your mind jewel, you're nothing but a
 charlatan anyway. You ought to be ashamed."

 Pavlaroka goes pale. "But- but-" He glares daggers at you. "You'll be
 sorry for this, madam. Believe me, you'll be very, <span class="floydstyle em">very</span>
 sorry."

 He storms away, pausing only to flash an angry glance back over his
 shoulder at you.

 One by one, the other men get up and leave, all save the one who
 dismissed Pavlaroka as a charlatan. He regards you coldly, but with
 some amusement in his eyes. "Well... that was an interesting turn of
 events. My name is Tobol. Tell me, did you deliberately do that to
 antagonise Pavlaroka or was it pure happenstance? No, don't answer the
 question. I'll just amuse myself with the knowledge that Pavlaroka has
 more enemies than I previously imagined."

>take mirror

 Taken.

>talk to tobol

 You explain about Oscar Talbot and the photo of his daughter that he
 lost gambling.

 Tobol shrugs. "He gambled. He lost. What more can I say?"

 "You could give him the photo back."

 "I could, but I won't. He gambled fair and square and he lost fair and
 square. If he wishes to have the photo back, he can go to the guard
 and see how far that takes him. And why does it concern you anyway?
 Are you some kind of good samaritan to the drunken and worthless?"

 "Would you take something else in exchange?"

 Tobol smiles. "Ah, now we're getting to the heart of the matter,
 aren't we? Very well. The photo by itself has no value to me. I would
 take money, but Talbot has none. However, there is a certain pearl I
 have seen, blue in colour, which rests in the display area of a
 jewellery shop on Mawbury Lane. It costs, I believe, 2 million
 credits. I will take <span class="floydstyle em">that</span> in exchange for the photo."

 "I hardly think Talbot has 2 million credits just lying around."

 "Then the photo is mine. Perhaps I will burn it, or cut it into small
 pieces and let the breeze carry it away."

 Oscar Talbot doesn't seem interested.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tiamont Plaza</span>
 This is Tiamont Plaza, the heart of the city's Upias District (named
 after some long-dead scholar, you think). Few people are about, and
 those you see hurry past quickly, as if unwilling to spend any more
 time here than they really have to. A large stone statue has been
 erected here and looks to have become a target for the locals and
 their graffiti.

 To the north is Morring Row, south is Belmont Avenue, southeast is a
 winding path between tall buildings, west lies Rowena's Coffee House
 and northwest is City Library.

>se

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Winding Path</span>
 Little sunlight reaches this winding path due to the tall buildings on
 either side, buildings which seem to lean over, almost touching, above
 you. This is an old part of the city, with nothing here having been
 built in the last hundred years.

 Northwest you can see Tiamont Plaza, to the south is an abandoned
 house and southeast is Mawbury Lane. Blocking the way to Mawbury Lane
 is a hulking thug by the name of Jacob.

>show gun to jacob

 Jacob takes one look at the gun and hastily backs away. "Hey,
 sweetheart! Take it easy now! I wasn't gonna hurt you, honest, I was
 just- just-"

 Whatever he was just planning to do you never find out because he
 turns on his heel and runs off as fast as he can.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mawbury Lane</span>
 The old part of the city, but quite charming in its own right. There's
 a fountain here to drink from, though you're not entirely sure the
 water is good for you. A street artist can be seen here, performing
 for passersby.

 To the north is Padgett's Jewellers, south is Thorobad Road, east lies
 the exclusive Bagliatiers Club, southeast the Tower of Morning and
 northwest is a winding path.

>examine fountain

 An ancient stone fountain, likely built back in the days when people
 rode around on horses. It's full of water, but you're not sure how
 clean it is.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Padgett's Jewellers</span>
 The interior of the shop is a ruin: tumbled over displays, flickering
 lights and the security system seems to be malfunctioning. There's a
 pedestal in the centre of the store which seems to have survived the
 worst of the damage.

 There is a small manager's office to the north and to the south is
 Mawbury Lane.

 The disruption caused by the Angel's departure seems to have badly hit
 Padgett's Jewellers. Most of the displays have fallen over and the
 previous state-of-the-art security system appears to be
 malfunctioning. Of the manager, Mr Kimble, you can see no sign.

>examine pedestal

 It's hard to pay much attention to the pedestal with the blue pearl
 atop it.

>examine pearl

 Beautiful and then some. Even for someone not overly impressed with
 fancy jewels, this is very eye-catching. Unfortunately, the 2 million
 credit price tag puts it roughly 2 million credits out of your price
 range.

>save

>take pearl

 Hoping the alarms have been disabled, you pick up the large blue
 pearl.

 Which, the moment it leaves the pedestal, shimmers and shrinks to
 about half its former size. Clearly the pedestal is fitted with some
 kind of cloaking device designed to make the pearl look much grander
 than it previously was.

>take pedestal

 It's fixed in place.

>unmeld pearl

 You concentrate on the small blue pearl and bring your meld ability to
 bear, but nothing happens. It seems the small blue pearl hasn't been
 melded from anything and therefore it can't be unmelded into something
 else.

 structure looming over the whole of Morring Row and putting everything

 tavern, a park off to the northeast and Tiamont Plaza to the south. An
 alley can be seen off to the west, running alongside the tavern.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Alley</span>
 City alleys are supposed to be cleaned every day, but apparently the
 crew responsible for this alley didn't get the memo. It's knee-deep in
 trash and smells like an open sewer. Just being here makes you feel
 queasy.

 A breath of fresh air flows from the east.

 Before today, you'd only heard of the Emperor Tavern but never visited
 it. It has a somewhat ominous reputation which might be all rumour and
 no substance, but seeing it from here you can well imagine its
 reputation is well-founded.

 What you see is a large room, massive in fact, in which literally
 hundreds of people sit around circular tables, drinking beer, smoking
 all manner of illegal substances, and gambling. Yes, gambling. Banned
 within the city limits it might be, but here you see it in abundance.

 You can make your way deeper into the tavern to the north, west or
 northwest or you can return to Morring Row to the southeast.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Emperor Tavern { North }</span>
 Against the back wall of the tavern is a table. This was previously
 occupied by a group of strange individuals having a staring contest,
 but they have now all departed save for one man called Tobol.

 You can leave to the south when you wish.

>give pearl to tobol

 Tobol's eyes narrow slightly. "Interesting. When I asked for the
 pearl, I did not believe you would be able to acquire it, however it
 seems you are more resourceful than I imagined."

 "We had a deal. Do you have the photo?"

 "I do indeed." Tobol produces it from his pocket and casually tosses
 it to you. "Take it. A small thing. Trivial, of no account. But this,"
 he taps the pearl, "is worth a fortune. You are a strange person, to
 trade such obvious wealth for something of no value."

 "It means everything to Talbot."

 Tobol gives you a ghost of a smile. "Indeed."

>take photo

 You already have that.

>examine photo

 An old photo of a young girl, smiling prettily at the camera.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rowena's Coffee House</span>
 One of many coffee houses that have sprung up across the city offering
 cheap, barely drinkable (in your opinion) coffee to people with more
 money than common sense. This one is of fairly typical design:
 numerous tables and booths, an harassed looking waitress (the only
 employee that you can see) and an atmosphere thick with the smell of
 burnt coffee beans. Only one booth is free at this moment, this being
 due southwest. You see Oscar Talbot sat close by.

 To the east lies Tiamont Square.

>give photo to oscar

 Talbot's hand shakes as he reaches out to take the photo. "How did
 you...?"

 "Don't ask. I'm just glad I could retrieve it for you."

 Talbot stares at the photo. His eyes fill with tears, but he quickly
 wipes them away. "Oh, I'm an old fool, gambling with <span class="floydstyle em">this</span>...
 But I'm done now. No more gambling for me. I'd die if I lost this
 again. Tell me, please, how can I repay you?"

 You tell him there's no need, but he searches about his person for
 something, anything, to give you by way of payment. Finally he reaches
 into his pocket and pulls out a scarf. He holds it tightly then hands
 it to you. "Accept this. Please. It's not much but... years ago,
 before my daughter died, before my wife left me and I began drinking
 myself to death, I was a member of a very important club on Mawbury
 Lane. Bagliatiers. You may have heard of it. This scarf was something
 we all wore as a badge of our membership. It's not worth much these
 days - probably almost nothing in fact - but you might be able to sell
 it for something, and if not just..." He laughs softly. "Just use it
 to keep warm."

 He won't take no for an answer so you accept the scarf. Talbot thanks
 you again, then rises slowly to his feet, still clutching the photo of
 his daughter, and leaves the coffee house.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bagliatiers Club</span>
 This is the lobby area of a very exclusive club, the kind of place
 that only people with earnings in the seven figure category ever get
 to visit. The floor is all marble tiles and the walls fairly shimmer.
 Steel doors are set into the east wall and look impervious to anything
 less than a nuclear strike. A small slot to the side looks like the
 means of access, assuming you have anything that might fit into it.
 Due west lies Mawbury Lane.

 You hear footsteps from behind you and turn to see a tall,
 heavily-built man stood in the doorway. He has the look of a bodyguard
 or soldier.

 He notices the scarf you're  wearing and offers a short nod. "Welcome
 to Bagliatiers, madam. I am Farrah, head of security, at your
 service."

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

 Old leather chairs surround a central area where you see a large table
 has been set up. Atop this table is a map of the city shown from an
 aerial viewpoint. Gathered around the table are a group of elderly
 men.

 "Ah, so good of you come here, Miss Charles," says an elderly
 gentleman seated in an armchair at the table. "We've been waiting for
 you."

 You glance around uneasily. None of the people here can be younger
 than eighty, but there's nothing frail about them. They have the look
 of old money and old power.

 "Who are you are what do you want with me?" you ask.

 "My name is Carl Mountbatten. I meld." He gestures to the others in
 the room. "We <span class="floydstyle em">all</span> meld, but none to quite the extent that you
 do. We want to recruit you, Miss Charles, for a little job. We also
 want to talk to you about Tanya." He smiles. "Yes, your sister. She
 isn't dead and, with your help, we can rescue her."
