 0.9.0.

 I always get the criminal.  Whoever it is.  Whatever the
 embarrassment.  Whichever noses I put out of joint.

 So they sent me after Silhouette, and I caught her too.

 And now I'm about to do something very stupid.

 Mindflower Asylum
 I'm standing in the cold, early evening shadow of the Mindflower
 Asylum for the Criminally Insane - a tall, crooked building with
 barred windows and a sunken door.

 Townhouses are packed in tightly on all sides, but a deathly silence
 pervades.  The only sign of life is an ornithopter sailing high
 overhead.

 My motor car sits to one side of the cobbled road.

 (Type highlighted keywords to advance the story.)

>ABOUT
 Walker & Silhouette is a criminal investigation in a world and a time
 somewhat unlike your own.  Just type the names of objects and people
 you wish me to interact with (or click on them if your system supports
 this).  I'll also sometimes offer you keywords for less obvious
 actions and choices.  You can change the way that these words are
 highlighted in the text by typing keywords until you find the style
 you prefer.

 Some keywords that are always useful include look to ask me to repeat
 the room description; inventory to see what I'm carrying; save and
 restore to experiment with time travel; and think if you want me to
 give you a pointer in the right direction.

>keywords
 Keyword style changed to CAPS.

>examine ornithopter
 A graceful machine, easing itself across the sky with metal-feathered
 wings.

>wings
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

 Mindflower Asylum
 I'm standing in the cold, early evening shadow of the Mindflower
 ASYLUM for the Criminally Insane - a tall, crooked building with
 barred WINDOWS and a sunken DOOR.

 TOWNHOUSES are packed in tightly on all sides, but a deathly silence
 pervades.  The only sign of life is an ORNITHOPTER sailing high
 overhead.

 My motor CAR sits to one side of the cobbled road.

>windows
 The asylum's windows are raised up out of reach, seem far too small to
 afford much of a view, and are covered over with thick bars besides.

>inventory
 I am carrying a BOWLER hat, a CANE, and a police BADGE, and I'm
 wearing a three-piece SUIT.

>examine bars
 The asylum's windows are raised up out of reach, seem far too small to
 afford much of a view, and are covered over with thick bars besides.

>suit
 There being no consistent dress code for murder scenes, I tend to
 dress as if for a funeral.  My suit is black and carefully pressed.

>badge
 My badge is a little tarnished now, but the words "POLICE DETECTIVE"
 are legible enough.

>hat
 It's the nature of this line of work that my bowler spends more time
 in my hands than on my head.

>eat hat
 The bowler hat does not appear to be edible.

>car
 My own personal vehicle.  A bit of an expense, but I have to spend my
 inheritance on something.

>cane
 A simple but sturdy walking stick, necessary since I was shot by an
 accomplice of the Bottle Street Strangler.

>asylum
 Mindflower used to be a medieval gaol where murderers and debtors
 rubbed shoulders.  The centuries old, eroded stone may now be run
 through with the gleaming pipes of a modern heating system, but those
 confined here are no more likely to leave with their wits intact.

>townhouses
 And I thought the Old Warren could be a depressing place.  The houses
 around the asylum are dilapidated and crooked - their roofs sagging
 and windows cracked.

 Clearly only those who can't afford better live in the shadow of the
 madhouse.

>door
 The asylum's main entrance is a featureless door of the thickest
 metal, fitting flush against the sides of a deep alcove.  There's no
 handle or lock - just a small BUTTON on the wall.

 A small grating is set into the door at eye level.

>grating
 The grating is thick and sturdy.  Beyond it, I can see only darkness.

>open it
 That is not something I can open.

>xyzzy
 Your tiresome magic can hardly withstand my relentless reasoning.

>score
 This story doesn't use scoring.

>credits
 My story has been brought to you by that strange and dubious medium
 C.E.J.  Pacian in your year 2009.

 For this feat, he used 'TADS 3', a language for processing by
 computational engines developed by Michael J.  Roberts, and documented
 rigorously by Eric Eve.  Your manner of interaction with my story was
 inspired by one Aaron A.  Reed.

 Special gratitude is due for advice, feedback and encouragement from
 George Oliver, Emily Boegheim, agj, Anna Anthropy, Juhana Leinonen,
 Thomas Reisinger, D.J.  Hastings, increpare and Shae.


>button
 I push the button beside the door and a harsh electric buzzer sounds.
 Instantly, a narrow pair of EYES appear behind the grating, studying
 me carefully.  A gruff voice asks uncertainly, "Are you... a patient
 here?"

 I suppose I could IDENTIFY myself, or come back with some SNARK.

>snark
 "Do I look like I'm a patient here?"  I ask condescendingly.

 The voice remains tactfully silent, which is an answer in itself.

 I sigh and hold my badge up to the grating.  "I'm a police detective.
 Let me in."

 The voice scoffs.  "You could've fooled me, mate."

 But the door slowly rumbles open all the same.

 When you're ready, I can go IN.

>in
 As soon as I'm inside the asylum, I begin feeding the guard
 half-truths and exaggerations.  He nods wordlessly and leads me
 through narrow, white-walled passages that echo with manic cackles and
 miserable sobs.

 "This is the one," my guide says, stopping suddenly.  "Miss Ivy
 Blissheart.  Strictly no visitors, it says.  But I don't suppose they
 meant policemen."

 Cell 13
 The guard slams shut the door and I hear several bolts and locks being
 closed.  So this is where she ended up, thanks to me: a padded cell,
 lit harshly by a bare electric BULB.  Only the small WINDOW set into
 the DOOR hints at a world beyond its claustrophobic confines.

 A bulky WINCH has been bolted incongruously to the wall.

 Silhouette - IVY, I mean, is hanging upside-down from the ceiling,
 tied up in a straitjacket.

 She cranes her neck awkwardly to try and look at me.  "Is it MORNING
 already?  Time flies when you're all TRUSSED up like this."

>eyes
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>ivy
 It's difficult to get a good look at her as she hangs upside-down like
 this, spinning slowly back and forth.  But there is that impression of
 elfish mischief written into her features that I remember so well from
 her arrest.  And her scandalously boyish hair is not so short that it
 can't trail below her in unruly curls.

 Ivy is wearing a STRAITJACKET.

 "Hey," she suddenly exclaims.  "I know you, don't I?  No hard feelings
 about the whole incarcerating me thing, Inspector.  I'm just glad you
 came to visit."

>bulb
 Painful to look at.  It casts sharply defined shadows against the
 featureless walls.

>trussed
 I look over the straitjacket.  "Did they put you in this thing the
 right way up?"

 Ivy laughs dryly.  "CRIME, the good doctor believes, is the result of
 insufficient blood flow to the brain.  So, you know, gravity's not my
 friend - and sleeping like a bat's the best TREATMENT."

 "I can call you Ivy, can't I?"  I suddenly think to ask.

 "Of course you can," she says.  "As long as I can call you...  Um..."

 "Nathaniel.  Or 'Nate' if that's too much of a mouthful."

>straightjacket
 The long white sleeves of the straitjacket are wrapped tightly around
 Ivy - completely restraining her arms.

 "I could get out of this real quick," Ivy says, "if only I was the
 right way up."

>treatment
 I'm almost afraid to ask.  "Is this the worst thing they do to you?"

 "Pretty much.  I think they're still working out what to make of me.
 I get plenty of peace and quiet, of course, so my fragile feminine
 mind can keep its uncontrollable emotions this side of HYSTERIA."

 She attempts an upside-down shrug.  "Hey, it's better than breaking
 rocks in PRISON, right?"

 "Assuming," I say carefully, "they don't go so far as a LOBOTOMY."

 Ivy says, "Um, what?"

>lobotomy
 "Do you feel like you're responding to the treatment?"  I ask.

 Ivy snorts with laughter.  "Well, I keep throwing up when they hang me
 upside-down.  That's a response, right?"

 My hair's fallen over my eye.  I brush it back.  "Eventually, they'll
 intervene physically."

 "You mean beating me?"

 "I mean cutting into your brain.  It's been shown to result in a more
 placid personality."  Gauging her expression, I add, "Don't worry.
 That's why I'm here.  To HELP."

>hysteria
 I study Ivy's carefree expression.  "You don't seem hysterical to me."

 "All bold women get the diagnosis sooner or later," she says with a
 wink.  "It's almost a compliment."

>winch
 The winch seems to be the main mechanism for raising and lowering
 whichever poor soul is assigned this bizarre treatment.

 I certainly intend to let Ivy down eventually... but I'd like to try
 and explain my proposition to her first.

>crime
 "You know," I say, "with the talent, cunning and ingenuity you put to
 work disrupting the city, you could have done some amazing things on
 the right side of the law."

 "Don't think I didn't try," she says.  "But somehow, society took one
 look at me and figured I'd be best put to use working a loom for ten
 hours a day."

 I twist my cane in my hand.  "Now that should be criminal."

 She laughs.  "And yet I'm the one you ARREST."

>arrest
 "Ivy," I begin, "I feel rather rotten that I actually caught you.  I
 got carried away with unravelling the mystery, and I didn't stop to
 think about what they'd do once they got you."

 She pulls a face.  "Don't be.  You're a policeman, and I broke laws,
 didn't I?  And maybe I got carried away too.  I don't think I'd
 actually thought it through as far as winding up in PRISON or
 wherever."

>proposition
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>prison
 "It kind of makes me angry," I say.

 Ivy looks at me strangely.  "You have a very sedate angry face, but
 what does?"

 "That you should have just been given a short prison sentence.  And
 instead you wind up in here, indefinitely, at the mercy of
 unsupervised quacks."

 "It makes me angry too," she says.  "But not at you.  You weren't even
 at the TRIAL."

>trial
 I clear my throat.  "I'm sorry I wasn't at the trial.  It was my case.
 I should have been there, but..."

 She finishes for me.  "But they thought you might say things in my
 favour, and they presented your evidence without you.  It's okay, I
 figured it out."

>help
 "If it's okay with you," I say, "I'm going to get you out of this
 place completely."

 Ivy swings slightly from side to side.  "No offence, Nate, but you
 couldn't even get me put in a proper prison in the first place.
 You're not talking about breaking me out or anything, are you?"

 "Of course not.  But you're right.  You're a patient, not a prisoner.
 That's why I'd be able to PRESS you into assisting me in my
 investigations."

 "Assisting?"  Ivy repeats.  "The POLICE?  Swapping one kind of
 imprisonment for the other, you mean?"

>police
 "It's odd," I muse aloud.  "You're happy to sabotage the discipline
 machine in a workhouse, but not to assist the one occupation where you
 have the legal power to stop abuse and suffering."

 Ivy snorts.  "And yet it always seems to be people like me they use
 that power against instead."

 "Maybe 'they' do.  But I don't.  You've ruffled the feathers of some
 powerful people.  But you're small fry compared to me.  I've put
 powerful people away for life."

 "Well, I'll try anything once," Ivy says.  "How does this PRESS thing
 work, anyway?"

>police
 "It's odd," I muse aloud.  "You're happy to sabotage the discipline
 machine in a workhouse, but not to assist the one occupation where you
 have the legal power to stop abuse and suffering."

 Ivy snorts.  "And yet it always seems to be people like me they use
 that power against instead."

 "Maybe 'they' do.  But I don't.  You've ruffled the feathers of some
 powerful people.  But you're small fry compared to me.  I've put
 powerful people away for life."

 "Well, I'll try anything once," Ivy says.  "How does this PRESS thing
 work, anyway?"

>press
 "All you have to do is agree to provide..."  I clear my throat,
 "invaluable and urgent assistance to my police work.  And then I can
 walk you out of here.  I have the paperwork on me."

 "Invaluable?  Okay, okay," Ivy says, "anything, just as long as I'm
 the right way up."

 I rub my hands together.  "Great!  I'll see about getting you down."

 "Gently!"  Ivy warns.

>look
 Cell 13
 I'm in a padded cell.  I'm sure Forthright would say it's about time.
 The walls are lit harshly by a bare electric BULB, and only the small
 WINDOW set into the DOOR hints at a world beyond its claustrophobic
 confines.

 A bulky WINCH has been bolted incongruously to the wall.

 IVY is hanging upside-down from the ceiling, tied up in a
 straitjacket.

 Ivy nods awkwardly towards the WINCH.  "Hey, detective.  That's how
 they get me up and down from here."

 (Talking to Ivy: MORNING.)

>morning
 "I hate to be the one to tell you, but the sun hasn't even set yet."

 Ivy sighs.  "You mean it's still yesterday?  Damn it."

>window
 Just the smallest slot for a guard to spy into the room, without the
 inmate being afforded any kind of view back out.

>door
 The cell door is badly scratched and scuffed, but years of abuse have
 barely managed to bend the thick bars across its tiny WINDOW.

 A CLIPBOARD is crookedly affixed to the door.

>clipboard
 It's written in the barely decipherable scrawl of a medical
 professional.  I could READ it, if you want.

>read
 I suppose this horrible, spidery scrawl is one way doctors try to
 respect patient confidentiality.  I can just about make out what the
 chart says.

 Name:  Blissheart, Ivy
 Sex:   F
 Ref #: 134A

 Incarcerated for:
 Vandalism; obscenity; blasphemy; criminal damage; disturbing the
 peace; conduct unbecoming of a woman.

 Diagnosis:
 Insufficient development of the ethical lobe.
 Hysteria.

>winch
 There's a little hook on the winch.  It seems to be holding it in
 position.  If I just carefully...  Oh dear.

 Ivy squirms to her feet.  "It's okay, I'm fine.  I only landed on my
 head."

 She wriggles a little, and the straitjacket drops to the floor.
 "Ouch.  Can you do me a favour and just pop my SHOULDER back in?"

>shoulder
 Ivy slips the hand of her dislocated arm into mine, and then twists
 around grotesquely while I pull firmly in the other direction.

 There's a sudden pop, and she gasps with relief.  "Yeah, that's
 better."

>icy
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>ivy
 Ivy looks rather relieved to be the right way up again.  Her elfin
 features are no longer quite so red, and her hair has returned to a
 messy imitation of its usual bob.

 Ivy is wearing some PYJAMAS.

 Ivy clasps her hands behind her back and looks at me expectantly.  "So
 are we going to LEAVE, or what?"

>pyjamas
 A pair of simple white pyjamas.  Of all forms of clothing, surely the
 least taxing on the mind.

 Ivy stretches her arms and legs.

>leave
 I knock loudly on the door for the guard to let us out.

 Ivy shakes her head.  "Now this I've got to see."

 "They can't squirm out of this," I say.  "I've caught them in their
 own loophole.  And once you're out of here... maybe you should just
 run.  Flee the city."

 "Not likely," Ivy says.  "This city's all I know.  And you sold me on
 the idea of being a detective.  Don't tell me you're chickening out
 now?"

 I brush back my hair and put on my bowler.  "Never."

 (Press space...)








 Okay, hi.  It's me now: Ivy Blissheart, a.k.a.  Silhouette.  How are
 you doing?

>fine
 Not very talkative, eh?  Well, we'll just keep it to the keywords
 then.

 So this is the second time in my life I've been in a police station,
 and you know what?  The Office of Unfathomable Crimes is a lot more
 comfortable than the interrogation room.

 But maybe not so much for Walker right this moment.  Nate, I mean.
 He's been in the Chief Inspector's office an hour now, just on the
 other side of that door, getting shouted at.  I feel sort of bad for
 him, because it's got to all be about what he did for me.

 Maybe if I LOOK around, I can figure out a way to help him out.

>fathom crimes
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>look
 Office of Unfathomable Crimes
 I'm in the Oldchester C.I.D., specifically the Office of Unfathomable
 Crimes.  It's quite homely, really, with sunlight streaming in through
 a large WINDOW and moustachioed men smiling down from PICTURE frames
 on the walls.

 A DESK fills much of the room, piled high with PAPERS and FILES, and a
 pneumatic TUBE snakes along one wall.

 Nate said I should just WAIT here and not get into trouble, but I've
 never been one to do what I'm told.

 I can hear a raised voice ranting on the other side of the door to the
 Chief Inspector's office.

>papers
 Official documents and memos are scattered over the desk in a
 disorganised fashion.  They all look to be on the officious side of
 bureaucratic.

>tube
 So I used to work in a factory that had tubes like this for sending
 messages between departments.  It was great fun - and those pipes
 didn't even have coppers on the other end of them.

 There's a metal BOX attached to it, and a little BASKET ready to catch
 the messages it spits out.

>read
 I have nothing in mind to read at the moment.

>ivy
 Oh, um, hi.  I'm Ivy, although a lot of people know me - know of me,
 really - as Silhouette: anarcha-feminist dissident.  I want you to
 know that if I ever messed around with any of your stuff, or made you
 look bad, or whatever, that it was absolutely nothing personal.

 But, you know, you probably had it coming.

>basket
 There's a little basket just beneath the metal BOX.  It looks like
 it's positioned to catch anything that might come flying out of the
 pneumatic tube.  It contains a CANISTER.

>box
 A neat little box of tarnished filigree, attached to the pneumatic
 tube.  Loads of BUTTONS are set into the face of the thing, a LEVER on
 the side, and a BASKET underneath it.  Oh, and there's a small HOLE in
 the top of it.

 You know, I've always been fond of a good gadget.

>canister
 It's a cylindrical canister, taking a brief rest after rattling
 through the pneumatic intestines of the police station.  It's open,
 and contains a MEMO.

>buttons
 There are loads of chunky buttons set into the front of the box.  Most
 of them are blank, but some have neat inscriptions.  There are buttons
 marked CHIEF, Serious CRIMES, FRAUD, and NARCOTICS.  Oh, and a bit of
 paper has been stuck to one button with the word UNFATHOMABLE
 scribbled on it.

 The button marked 'Serious Crimes' is currently depressed.

>memo
 It's very neatly typed, on a perfectly square piece of paper.

 MEMORANDUM

 Rumours are circulating that a woman has been commissioned as a police
 officer.  These rumours are untrue.  While a woman has been employed
 to assist the C.I.D., she is not doing so in the capacity of either
 constable or detective.

 Frankly, the gossiping this event has sparked leads me to believe that
 she will feel quite at home with the lot of you.

 Chief Inspector LeStains

>unfathomable
 I push the button marked 'Unfathomable'.  It depresses with a firm
 'click', and the button marked 'Serious Crimes' pops back up.

>crimes
 I push the button marked 'Serious Crimes'.  It depresses with a firm
 'click', and the button marked 'Unfathomable' pops back up.

>narcotics
 I push the button marked 'Narcotics'.  It depresses with a firm
 'click', and the button marked 'Serious Crimes' pops back up.

>hole
 There's a circular hole in the top of the box.  This must be where
 messages go to get sent through the pneumatic TUBE.

>lever
 I grab the lever on the side of the box and give it a firm yank.  The
 hole in the box emits a tremendous sucking sound until I let the lever
 spring back into place.

 A DESK fills much of the room, piled high with PAPERS and FILES, and a
 pneumatic TUBE snakes along one wall.

 I can hear a raised voice ranting on the other side of the door to the
 Chief Inspector's office.

>desk
 The desk's all scuffed and scratched.  It could use a good polish.  On
 the desk are a bell JAR, some PAPERS, and some FILES.

>files
 Thick binders full of files are propped up against one another like a
 collapsed house of cards.  Each file's got a letter on its spine.

 By far the thickest file is labelled with an S.

>go south
 S.  The snakiest of all letters.  Just what criminal masterminds,
 associated with the letter 'S', could exist in the city to so
 thoroughly fill out this poor, bulging binder?

 Oh look, it's all about me.

 I set the binder back down, but...  I sort of want to look at it
 again, more closely.

>go south
 I open the binder to the first scrap of paper filed under
 'Silhouette'.  It's a memo to Walker, ordering that the Office of
 Unfathomable Crimes look into a prankster and graffiti artist who's
 humiliating the upper crust - because no-one else could catch me.

 So, I'm actually blushing right now.

>go south
 Ah look, it's a photograph of one of my earlier works.  A caricature
 of a factory boss, painted around the entrance to the shop floor, as
 if his flabby maw was greedily devouring each worker as they stepped
 inside.

>go south
 I find a report of an incident at a posh library.  Seems that someone
 slipped a number of copies of an infamous work of erotica into the
 covers of some notable theological tomes.

 I can only plead ignorance of the whole affair.

>go south
 See this report here?  So someone reprograms a teaching automaton to
 instruct pre-school children in the spelling and grammatical use of a
 number of profanities, and I get the blame.

 And it's not like they were even old enough to know what any of it
 meant.

>j
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>go south
 There's a couple of sheets of photographs clipped to some of Walker's
 notes.  Looks like he was trying to create a timeline of various
 Silhouette symbols I daubed around the city and analyse the
 development of my style.

 Ah, bless him.

>go south
 I find some case notes from the distribution of an obscene forgery of
 a public information pamphlet.

 It's interesting how transposing a few words can turn an essay on
 moral hygiene into something a bit... different.

>jar
 A hemisphere of glass attached to an air PUMP.  It seems to contain a
 piece of rotten MEAT and a SWARM of stripy flies.

 There's a NOTE attached to it.

>note
 The note's written in very elegant handwriting:

 Dear All,
 I'm conducting an experiment to determine the effects of high altitude
 on the life cycle of the striped carrion fly.  This may have a bearing
 on a certain case involving a famous mountaineer.  Please don't panic
 if they escape.  Although they may look like wasps, they're completely
 harmless.

>pump
 A set of bellows attached to an electric motor and a fan.  Yeah, I'd
 say it's some sort of air pump.

 There's an awfully tempting SWITCH on the side of it.

>switch
 I flip the switch and the pump begins whirring quietly.  After a few
 seconds, the pump's fan spits out one of the stripy flies.  I turn off
 the pump before any more get sucked out.

 Whoops.  I hope I didn't just invalidate Nate's experiment.

>attach pump to tube
 I cannot attach that to anything.

>suck on tube
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>box
 A neat little box of tarnished filigree, attached to the pneumatic
 tube.  Loads of BUTTONS are set into the face of the thing, a LEVER on

 I can hear a raised voice ranting on the other side of the door to the
 Chief Inspector's office.

>picture
 These must be the rozzers who've worked at the C.I.D. through the
 ages.  There's a definite trend over time from men with huge beards
 and top hats towards men with small moustaches and bowler hats.

 Next thing you know the place'll be run by hatless women.

>examine me
 What, do you want my vital statistics or something?  I'm Ivy
 Blissheart, a.k.a.  Silhouette, former dissident, currently attached
 to the police force in some crazy fashion.

>inventory
 I am carrying a NOTEBOOK, and I'm wearing a long JACKET, a short
 DRESS, and a CLOCHE hat.

>cloche
 A small bucket of a hat that goes nicely with my short hair and
 doesn't take up much space.  Also it forces me to hold my head up
 high, or I can't see out from under the brim.

>notebook
 I'm all set to be a good detective.  Got my little notebook and
 everything, 'though it's currently blank at the moment, save a little
 doodle of Walker.

>doodle
 Oh, you know, just a lean gent in a bowler, burning up the page with
 his unmatched good looks and powers of perception.

>examine box
 A neat little box of tarnished filigree, attached to the pneumatic
 tube.  Loads of BUTTONS are set into the face of the thing, a LEVER on
 the side, and a BASKET underneath it.  Oh, and there's a small HOLE in
 the top of it.

>dress
 A white, sleeveless dress with a hemline just below the knee.  Yes, I
 decided I'd rather look like a floozie than trip over my own clothes

 I look out the window and across the smoke-blackened rooftops of
 Oldchester.  The sun's low on the horizon, looking all pale and
 sleepy.

 It looks sort of like a wasp, only not nearly as sure of itself.

 There are loads of chunky buttons set into the front of the box.  Most

>pull lever
 I grab the lever on the side of the box and give it a firm yank.  The
 hole in the box emits a tremendous sucking sound until I let the lever
 spring back into place.

 The stripy fly is sucked helplessly into the pneumatic tube.  Pharaoh
 speed, little stripy fly.

 Things suddenly go quiet in the Chief Inspector's office.  Let's WAIT
 and see what happens.

>wait
 The door to the Chief Inspector's office opens quietly, and NATE slips
 into the room.  I get a brief glimpse of a fat, bald man swatting at
 the air with a rolled up newspaper before the door closes again.

 Nate says, "I decided that now might not be the time to tell the Chief
 Inspector about the difference between a striped carrion fly and a
 wasp."

>fly
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>chief
 The button marked 'Chief' is currently depressed.  Physically, I mean.
 Emotionally, it seems to be holding up fine.

 "I see you've already met my colleague, FORTHRIGHT," Nate says.

 I turn around with a start and see a tall man with a long nose leaning
 against the wall.

 "I find her powers of observation lacking," he says.

 The nerve!  I could try and put this bloke in his PLACE or just BITE
 my tongue.

>place
 "You must get a lot of practice," I say, "spying on young women."

 He just ignores me.  I'll take that to mean he can't think of a good
 comeback.

 "Well," Nate says, "it was fun while it lasted, but it looks like I'm
 off Unfathomable Crimes and back at the Old Warren desk."

 "Because of her?"  Forthright asks.

 Okay, I feel pretty rotten right now.  Should I be SYMPATHETIC towards
 Walker, or HARSH towards Forthright?

>sympathetic
 "Are you in trouble because of me, Na- uh, Walker?"  I demand,
 watching Forthright carefully.  "Because I'm telling you, I'm really
 not worth it."

 "There's no way I was going to let them lobotomise you, Ivy," Nate
 says.  "You didn't do anything to deserve that.  And in any case, I...
 don't mind working the Old Warren.  The cases may be less fancy, but
 they need good detectives as much as anyone else."

 Forthright shakes his head.  "I think it's a crying shame.  Look, take
 this."  He hands Nate a piece of PAPER.  "Someone telephoned in a
 murder and it looks right up your alley.  One last unfathomable case,
 okay?  You're probably the only one who can solve it anyway."

 Shooting me a final hateful look, Forthright stalks out of the office.

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "sympathetic".

 Office of Unfathomable Crimes
 I'm in the Oldchester C.I.D., specifically the Office of Unfathomable
 Crimes.  It's quite homely, really, with sunlight streaming in through
 a large WINDOW and moustachioed men smiling down from PICTURE frames
 on the walls.

 A DESK fills much of the room, piled high with PAPERS and FILES, and a
 pneumatic TUBE snakes along one wall.

 FORTHRIGHT is leaning against the wall.

 NATE stands an arm's length away, leaning on his cane.

 Shooting me a final hateful look, Forthright stalks out of the office.

>paper
 I peer over at the piece of paper that Forthright gave to Nate.  The
 handwriting is almost illegible, but I can make out the words 'murder'
 and 'uptown'.  This must be one of those classy killings Walker's
 always solving.

 Nate reads the paper and smiles.  "Another mystery afoot!  We should
 LEAVE as soon as you're ready, Ivy."

>walker
 Nate's the kind of delicate, impossibly beautiful young man you'd
 sooner expect to see reclining in a bay window writing poetry than
 examining a corpse in the Old Warren.

 But there's also a sort of nervous energy to him, and his hair's
 always falling over one eye or the other as he looks around with
 intense interest.

 Nate is carrying a BOWLER hat, a CANE, a police BADGE, and a PIECE of
 paper, and he's wearing a three-piece SUIT.

>memo
 It's very neatly typed, on a perfectly square piece of paper.

 MEMORANDUM

 Rumours are circulating that a woman has been commissioned as a police
 officer.  These rumours are untrue.  While a woman has been employed
 to assist the C.I.D., she is not doing so in the capacity of either
 constable or detective.

 Frankly, the gossiping this event has sparked leads me to believe that
 she will feel quite at home with the lot of you.

 Chief Inspector LeStains

 NATE stands an arm's length away, leaning on his cane.

>xyzzy
 And an abracadabra to you too.

>cane
 "Can I just ask," I begin, "I've always wondered about the cane..."

 He smiles grimly.  "I was shot.  The bullet missed the femoral artery,
 but still shattered my thighbone like glass."

 I cringe.  "Ouch."

 "Yes, I recall saying something along those lines myself."

>badge
 I can't see it very well, but I bet it gets him through all sorts of
 doors.

>suit
 Nate's dressed like for a funeral.  I s'pose there often is one when
 he turns up.

>bowler
 I'd describe Nate's little hat as moderately adorable.

>leave
 I crack my knuckles.  "Okay: let's get policing!  Can I drive your
 motor car?"

 Nate smiles.  "In general: yes.  But this is perhaps not the time to
 learn."

 (Press space...)








 The bluebottle at the door salutes Nate and gives me the evil eye.
 And then we're inside the scene of the crime.

 "It's all yours," Nate says, with a wry smile.  "Detect!"

 The Explorer's Home
 You know what?  It's cold in here.  The wind blows right in through
 the smashed balcony DOORS, rippling the fur of the room's shaggy RUG
 and tugging on the torn sheets of the four-poster BED.

 There's a mangled CORPSE on the bed - the whole reason we're here, of
 course.  And the walls are lined with all sorts of TROPHIES and stuff
 from around the Arctic and Antarctic.

 NATE stands an arm's length away, leaning on his cane.

>doors
 The balcony doors look like they've been hit by a bomb.  The JAMBS are
 all bent out of shape and shards of broken GLASS have been scattered
 over the floor.

 "Would it be jumping to conclusions," I ask, "to think they might have
 come in through the balcony?"

 Nate nods.  "It seems a sensible hypothesis."

>glass
 "Okay, I know this is penny dreadful stuff, but the glass is on the
 inside of the room, so the doors were broken in from the outside...
 right?"

 Nate smiles.  "Just because it's obvious, that doesn't mean it's
 wrong."

>jambs
 The jambs are the side parts of the doorframe.  But you knew that.

 "It doesn't look like this was caused just by forcing the doors open,"
 I ponder aloud.  "It's like something a bit too big was crammed
 through here.  They must have stolen something.  Something big."

 Nate says, "Oh really?"

>rug
 This has got to be the shaggiest rug I've ever seen.  Peering closer,
 I think I see something.  "Hey, there's loads of little DENTS in the
 rug, like there was a heavy table here, and someone bounced it around
 all over the place."

 Nate leans forward on his cane and acknowledges my find silently.

>dents
 "You know how when you move a heavy piece of furniture, you find the
 legs have left dents in the carpet?"

 "I can't say I'm intimately acquainted with the phenomenon," Nate
 says, "but yes."

 "These dents are sort of like that," I go on, "but they're not pressed
 down too much, like whatever was here wasn't here for long."

 Nate makes an appreciative nod.  I think I'm going to write this down
 in my NOTEBOOK.

>corpse
 The legendary polar explorer Saul Hawthorne is lying on the bed, quite
 thoroughly deceased.  His broken LIMBS have been wrapped twice around
 his body and his FACE is frozen into a rictus of surprise and agony.

 Nate watches me closely.  "It's okay if you feel faint."

 "Pfff.  I'm fine."

>notebook
 I flip open my notebook.  So far, I've made the following notes:

 -(A doodle of Walker.)
 -The pedals of a motor car go: clutch, brake, accelerator, from left
 to right.
 -Something made lots of dents in the rug.

>faint
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>swoon
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>limbs
 I'm not sure exactly how his arms and legs got in this state.  It's
 like a giant tried to roll him up like a ball of string.  His skin has
 circular BRUISES all over it.

 "I actually fainted at my first crime scene," Nate reassures me.

 I laugh.  "Seriously, I'm fine."

>bruises
 His arms and legs - the same arms and legs mangled almost beyond
 recognition - are marked with countless circular bruises.  I think
 I'll write this down in my NOTEBOOK.

 "Are you sure you're okay?"  Nate asks.

 "I did throw up in my mouth a bit," I admit, "but I just swallowed it
 back down."

 "Well, as long as you feel you have it under control."

>face
 Whatever did this to him, I don't think he saw it coming.

 I don't know how to return from here.

 NATE stands an arm's length away, leaning on his cane.

>bed
 "From the state of this bed," I say, surveying the mess made of its
 torn and crumpled sheets, "I think it's safe to assume he didn't die
 peacefully in his sleep."

 Nate nods.  "And it therefore seems quite probable that he was mangled
 by the very method of his murder, rather than post mortem."

>l under bed
 I see nothing unusual under the bed.

>sheets
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>trophies
 This bloke obviously liked to surround himself with evidence of his
 own achievements.  There are countless picture FRAMES on the walls,
 some freaky SPECIMENS, a few... let's call them KNICKKNACKS, and a
 huge MAP of Antarctica.

>frames
 I bet it took real work to fit all these different sized frames
 together so neatly, with so little space left over.  What jumps out at
 me?  There's an ancient SCROLL, the front page of a NEWSPAPER, an
 AERIAL photo, a photo of two MEN, some sort of mathematical CHART, and
 a diagram of something like a candelabra or a TREE or something.

>scroll
 The scroll shows a load of stick figures pointing at a star, with
 scribbly words spiralling around in every open gap.  A plaque on the
 frame reads: 'Ancient peoples record the meteor falling to Earth with
 great accuracy.  Modern calculations prove its origin at Mars.'

 "People complain about progress," I say, "but I don't think going from
 stick figures to photographs in a few thousand years is to be sniffed
 at."

 Nate says, "Quite."

>newspaper
 The newspaper shows two men posing outside the Oldchester Museum, with
 the headline: Hero Explorers' Audience with Pharaoh.  The fella on the
 left looks like the victim.  The other one's a man in an eye-patch.

 "So he was famous then?"  I ask.

 Nate says, "Renowned."

>aerial
 Well, I suppose it's an aerial photo.  Depends how tall the
 photographer was.

 There's a wide swathe of barren ice, and in the middle of it is a
 basin or dip that's overflowing with weird trees and dense vines.
 There are little dots surrounding it, like birds, only not birds, if
 you know what I mean.
>aerial

 "Explorers go to some weird places," I say to Nate.

 He looks at me funny.  "I think that's by definition."

 A photograph of two men wrapped up in furs and standing in front of a
 cave painting.  One of them looks like the victim, the other's someone
 in an eye-patch.

 The painting shows a load of inhuman stick figures feeding their
 fellows to a tentacled blob.

>chart
 A comparison of the Antarctic climate versus apparent Martian
 temperatures.  Fascinating stuff.

 "What kind of holiday time do I get, Nate?  It looks like Mars is nice
 this time of year."

 He looks thoughtful.  "I'm not sure if you're displaying a complete
 ignorance of the actual nature of seasons, or making a witty comment
 about the eccentricity of the Martian orbit."

 "The former," I say, "definitely."

>tree
 According to the title: "The Martian Life of the Antarctic: A
 Provisional Taxonomy".  It seems to consist of loads of lines
 connecting long, made-up words.

 So you go to Antarctica, without heat, food or reliable transport, and
 you still come back with loads of rubbish that you don't need.  It's a
 terrible statement on the human condition.

 I s'pose the most interesting knickknacks I can see are a husky's
 COLLAR, a woolly SCARF and a MEDAL.  All of them just pinned to the
 wall.

>tree
 According to the title: "The Martian Life of the Antarctic: A
 Provisional Taxonomy".  It seems to consist of loads of lines

>medal
 The 'South Polar Society Star for Heroic Dedication to Science.'  I
 say to Nate, "At least he got recognised before he died.  Does that
 happen for police detectives?"

 Nate says, "Only the ones who don't make waves."

 "Oh.  Then I missed my chance without even knowing I had it."

>collar
 The nametag reads 'Butch'.

 "I believe they were forced to eat their dogs," Nate explains.

 I frown.  "And just think: if Butch had eaten this bloke because he
 was hungry, people would have called it a tragedy."


>scarf
 I finger the scarf.  It feels warm, but I'm not sure I'd trust it with
 my life at the South Pole.

>specimens
 Yuck.  Okay, there's a polar bear's HEAD mounted on the wall, a
 pickled space creature in a JAR, and an exotic AQUARIUM.

>map
 Wow.  That's a lot of ice.  There are a couple of flags pinned into
 the map, one marked 'Pharaoh Base' and the other 'Expedition 1'.

 "So this guy was a polar explorer," I muse.

 Nate says, "You catch on quick."

>head
 I reach out and stroke the polar bear's muzzle.  He looks fierce, but
 his fur's nice and soft.  "Poor thing.  If only he'd covered his nose
 with his paw when he saw this bloke coming."

 "They don't actually ever do that," Nate corrects me.

 "Well," I say, "the sooner they start, the better."

>jar
 It's...  This little blighter must be of great scientific interest,
 that's for sure.  "Where's its head?"  I ask.  "Is that its mouth?"

 "That's its anus," Nate informs me, without so much as blinking.

 "Well they must have very different priorities on Mars."

>aquarium
 An opulent, oversized tank of water, currently occupied by some gravel
 and a little CASTLE.  No sign of the fish at present.  What a waste of
 water.

 "Any little aspect of the crime scene can be relevant," Nate says,
 cryptically.  "There's no such thing as too much knowledge."

 Hmm.  Maybe the fish is a suspect?  I wonder what its alibi is?

>castle
 Looking a little more closely, I think I can make out a tiny round eye
 staring back at me from inside the little castle.  "So I've solved the
 case of the missing FISH."

 To my surprise, Nate limps over to get a closer look.  "I see.  Very
 interesting."

 The thing is, I don't think he's joking.

>fish
 I tap on the side of the aquarium.  The fish just stares out at me.

 "Don't," Nate says.  "It's clearly been frightened."

 "I thought that's just what fish did?  Hide, so you wonder why you
 bothered to get them in the first place."

 Nate brushes back his hair.  "Well, if you don't think it's relevant."

 I sigh.  "Fine, I'll write it down in my NOTEBOOK.  Happy?"

 Nate reaches out for my notebook and glances over it.  "I think you've
 got enough here that you might be able to EXPLAIN the method of
 murder."

>explain
 "You want me to explain how this man was twisted to death in his own
 bed?"

 Nate purses his lips.  "I believe I said as much."

 "The dents in the rug... the frightened fish...  I dunno, an angler
 with two peg legs?"

 Nate turns towards the maimed corpse.  "I've never seen a fisherman
 who could do this to a person.  And what about the circular bruises?"

 Well, I s'pose could keep trying to EXPLAIN the murder, or just SHRUG.

>explain
 "How about some kind of... petrol-driven arm and leg twisting
 machine?"

 "No," Nate says.  "That would never frighten a fish.  Fish don't have
 arms or legs.  I know you can EXPLAIN it, though.  Keep trying."

 Or maybe I should just SHRUG and give up.

>explain
 "Frightens fish, leaves dents... a swarm of angry fishing rods?"

 Nate sighs.  "Now you're just being absurd."

 EXPLAIN, SHRUG, the choice is yours.

>explain
 "Okay, I think I've got it this time: a typhoon machine on robotic
 legs.  Typhoons are at sea, right?"

 "Better," Nate says, "but the whole room would be in disarray if that
 were the case.  I know you can EXPLAIN this mystery, Ivy.  Don't give
 up."

 The urge to SHRUG is almost overwhelming.

>punch nate
 My attacks are made in the medium of graffiti and petty vandalism.

>explain
 "A giant sea urchin, bent on murder.  The dents are its footprints.
 The victim twisted himself to death trying to avoid its spines."

 Nate seems impressed.  "Well thought out, but sea urchins are very
 mellow creatures, as their spines protect them from all the ills of
 the world.  I can't imagine one being moved to kill."

 "This is ridiculous, Nate, I have no idea."

 "I know you can EXPLAIN this, Ivy.  All the evidence is here."

 I SHRUG, but not in any final sort of fashion.  Yet.

>mock nate through the medium of street art
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>explain
 I throw up my hands.  "A shark on stilts."

 Nate laughs, and I feel myself turning red with embarrassment.  Maybe
 this sort of thing comes easily to him, but-

 "Very close," Nate says.  "I think you almost have it."

 "Um, what?"

 Can I really EXPLAIN this bizarre crime, or should I just SHRUG and
 get Nate to enlighten me?

>explain
 "My head hurts," I whine.  "My mind's gone blank."

 "Nonsense," Nate snaps.

 "Okay... a predatory sea creature that frightened the fish... it's on
 robotic legs, which left dents in the rug... and... it twisted a man
 up like so much yarn... so it was an octopus?"

 Nate squeezes my shoulder.  "Based on the sucker marks, I'd say a
 giant squid, but you're in the right phylum and class."

 I stare at him open mouthed.

 He looks around.  "Now, I suspect we may be able to find out who
 sicced this abomination on our victim if we rifle his writing DESK."

 I frown.  "What writing-?  Oh."

>desk
 This absolutely was not here earlier.  Otherwise I'd have mentioned
 it.  Nate must have moved it in while I was distracted with all the
 other junk packed into this ridiculous room.  I mean, there's a polar
 bear's HEAD on the wall.  Is it any wonder if I get distracted?
 Anyway.

 It's a very neat little desk, not much used, I'd say.  Two small
 DRAWERS are set into one side of the thing.  On the desk is a PINK
 letter.

>pink
 Written in a careful and delicate script:

 Sweetiepie,
    Miss you so much when you're away.  Hurry round to visit as soon as
 you can, and bring me a nice surprise!
 Love and huggles,
 Elizabeth

 P.S.  Muggles the kitten misses you as well!

 "Anything pertinent?"  Nate asks.

 "Only to my fading ability to hold onto my breakfast."

>drawers
 The desk has two drawers.  Do you want me to open the TOP one, or the
 BOTTOM one?

>top
 Opening the top drawer reveals a BLUE letter.

>blue
 The letter's written in a blocky, neat hand.

 Saul,
    Our mutual friend is in the city.  Don't ask me how.  Perhaps you
 can pay him off?
    Rupert Wetherby

 I show the letter to Nate.  "Does this sound like the kind of thing
 that gets people murdered?"

 "Anything can get one murdered, in my experience.  Keep looking."

>blue
 The letter's written in a blocky, neat hand.

 Saul,
    Our mutual friend is in the city.  Don't ask me how.  Perhaps you

    Rupert Wetherby

>bottom
 I try the bottom drawer, but it won't budge.  On closer inspection,
 there's a little warded LOCK on the thing.

 Nate looks over the desk.  "The key may be around here somewhere..."

 I clear my throat.  "I am all the keys you will ever need."

>lock
 I pull out one of my hatpins and bend the end into a 'bit' with my
 teeth.  Slide it into the lock like a key, turn it, and... click.

 Nate says, "I expect you think I'm impressed."

 I blow him a kiss, like a moving picture star.  "I know you're
 impressed."

 Opening the drawer, I find a YELLOW letter.

>yellow
 This letter's written in an almost uncontrolled scrawl.

 Saul

 Thought you got rid of me, did you?
 Well I'm on my way home.
 You'll get yours, city boy.

 From you know who.

 I show it to Nate.  "Look like a letter from a murderer to you?"

 He develops a crooked smile.  "This must be the mutual friend
 mentioned in the other letter.  It seems that 'Rupert' shall have a
 number of questions to answer."

 Nate runs his fingers through his hair and puts on his bowler.  "We'll
 LEAVE once you feel you've sated your curiosity, shall we?"

 The bottom drawer contains a YELLOW letter.  The top drawer contains a

 "No entry," the doorman says.  "Members only.  And you're not even a
 gentleman."

 Ivy waves her papers in his face.  "Police.  We can go where we like."

 "That's not strictly true," I whisper.

 The Adventurous Gentleman's Club
 Tobacco SMOKE hangs in the air like a mist of filth.  I've been in
 opium dens with more pleasant air, although they admittedly lacked the
 fine mahogany FURNITURE of this place.

 IVY is by my side, elfin and mischievous.

 Rupert WETHERBY sits staring at us.  "You're both police officers?
 The world's really gone to pot."

>ivy
 I glance over at Ivy.  I see a young woman, about the same age and
 height as me, slender, athletic, elfin.  Her hair is cut into a short
 bob and her features are untouched by rouge.

 Ivy is carrying a NOTEBOOK, a YELLOW letter, and a BLUE letter, and
 she's wearing a long JACKET, a short DRESS, and a CLOCHE hat.

 "Mr Wetherby," Ivy begins uncertainly, "we were wondering about these
 two letters."

 He waves them away.  "Not related to Saul's death, I assure you.  I
 understand you must investigate, but some things are better left
 unknown."

>dress
 A simple and short dress, unlikely to get in the way - especially
 since it barely covers her KNEES.

 "Okay," Ivy whispers to me, "I'll be bad cop.  You just DEFEND him,
 APPEAL to his better nature, OFFER leniency, that sort of thing."

 "Bad cop?"  I repeat stupidly, although the term certainly fits.

>knees
 Ivy's bare legs are slender, pale, eminently distracting...

 She looks in my direction and I glance quickly away.

 Ivy rolls up her sleeves and swaggers over to Wetherby.  "Is there
 something about this 'you know who' that you'd prefer to hide from the
 law?"

 Wetherby seems unimpressed by her display.  "I assure you that this
 matter, while I might prefer to keep it secret, is not related to his
 murder."

 Should I DEFEND Rupert, APPEAL to his better nature, or OFFER
 leniency?

>appeal
 "Mr Wetherby," I say, "please.  The murderer must be caught before he
 or she kills again."

 He shakes his head.  "I'll say it again.  These letters will not lead
 you to the murderer."

 "So you're protecting the victim," Ivy says.  "How noble.  Or
 perhaps... you're actually protecting yourself.  If Hawthorne had paid
 this person off, maybe you'd have profited?"

 Wetherby glares at her.

 Should I DEFEND Rupert, APPEAL to his better nature, or OFFER
 leniency?

>offer
 "If you help us, I'm sure the courts will be lenient."  I suggest.

 "I'm no accomplice to whoever killed my dearest friend," Wetherby
 spits.

 Ivy idly digs her heel into the expensive carpet.  "Even if you're not
 involved in the murder, I bet you were stabbing Hawthorne in the back
 in some way or another.  I mean, what are you so afraid we'll find
 out?"

 Should I DEFEND Rupert, APPEAL to his better nature, or OFFER
 leniency?

>defend
 "I'm sure he's not afraid of anything," I say.  "It may well be
 perfectly innocent."

 Ivy grins.  "Well, we'll find out eventually, with or without his
 co-operation."

 "I suppose you might as well hear it from me," Wetherby says.  "Look,
 Saul was no coward.  We faced real dangers on our expedition to the
 North Pole.  That polar bear...  I'd be dead if not for Saul.  But
 Saul liked his creature comforts.  When we met that bo's'n on the
 icebreaker, saw his remarkable likeness - well..."

 He looks at me suddenly.  "Will this go any further than you two?"

 Should I DEFEND Rupert, APPEAL to his better nature, or OFFER
 leniency?

>offer
 "Unless it becomes absolutely necessary to divulge this to convict his
 murderer," I say, "you have our confidence."

 Wetherby smiles at me.  "Thank you.  I suppose that's as it must be.
 And yes, I suspect, despite what I said earlier, that this is related
 to his death."

 Ivy sighs.  "Well, spit it out already!"

 "Saul never went to the Antarctic Crater," Wetherby says.  "He hasn't
 even left Oldchester in years."

 Should I DEFEND Rupert, APPEAL to his better nature, or OFFER
 leniency?

>appeal
 "Once you've shared this with us," I say, "I'm sure it will be a
 weight from your shoulders."

 "I went to Antarctica with a man by the name of Nigel Davenport,"
 Wetherby explains.  "In the photographs he looked enough like Saul,
 especially with a little doctoring of the negatives.  He knew the
 land, but he was no scientist or gentleman, and he started to become
 quite the braggart.  You have to understand: a land that to others was
 only death, could to him be something closer to a home..."

 Ivy gasps.  "You left him there, didn't you?"

 Wetherby stares at the carpet.  "How he could possibly have returned,
 I do not know.  But his aim now seems clear enough to me."

 Should I DEFEND Rupert, APPEAL to his better nature, or OFFER
 leniency?

>offer
 I touch Wetherby's shoulder.  "I'll see that a constable is assigned
 to protect you, but we shall have apprehended this man shortly."

 Wetherby seems reassured.  "Thank you."

 I check that my hat is on my head.  "Now, where might we find this
 Davenport?"

 "I don't know," Wetherby says.  "But I suspect that it will be nowhere
 civilised.  He was Saul's mirror opposite in many ways, and he loathed
 even the least luxury."

 I find myself smiling.  "I know just where to find him.  Ivy, we'll
 LEAVE for there immediately."

>jacket
 Ivy's jacket is creased and battered, the fabric softened by years of
 wear.

 "But what about the squid?"  Ivy demands.  "And what are you hiding
 under that eye patch?  Cuff him.  Let's take him down to the station
 and-"

 I cover her mouth with my hand.  "I think that's quite enough from
 'bad cop', thank you."

 Ivy says, "Mmm-hhmf."

>cloche
 Ivy's wearing one of those strange little bell-shaped hats that are
 starting to creep into fashion.  It looks rather adorable crowning her
 elfin features.

 Wetherby squints at Ivy.  "Do I know you from somewhere?"

 Ivy pulls on my arm.  "I doubt it.  Well, off we go..."

>wetherby
 A craggy, ageless man in an EYEPATCH.  Several of his FINGERS are
 missing.

 Wetherby seems to arrive at a sudden realisation.  "Silhouette!  I own
 the carpet factory you broke into.  You tampered with the machines...
 Those obscene patterns!  An entire batch had to be burned!"

 Ivy shrugs nervously.  "I s'pose those are the dangers of too much
 automation."

>fingers
 Frostbite has left Wetherby with an odd assortment of digits and one
 thumb.

 Wetherby stares at Ivy.  "You're a menace.  The very idea that you
 should be a free woman, let alone some charade of public authority-"

 "I believe it is in fact a crime to verbally abuse a police officer,"
 I announce, as if to myself.

 Ivy acquires a smug expression.

>eyepatch
 A smart leather patch covers Wetherby's left eye.

 "I need a stout drink," Wetherby murmurs.  He stands, bows reluctantly
 to Ivy and walks away.

>smoke
 Yeuch.  The place could be burning down, and no-one would notice.

 "By the way," Ivy says, "You make a pretty bad 'good cop'.  I respect
 that."

 "I was a good enough cop to get you out of Mindflower, Ivy."

 She shakes her head.  "That's not 'good cop' at all.  You're bad cop
 through and through.  We'll try it the other way 'round next time."

 Next time!

>look
 The Adventurous Gentleman's Club
 Tobacco SMOKE hangs in the air like a mist of filth.  I've been in
 opium dens with more pleasant air, although they admittedly lacked the
 fine mahogany FURNITURE of this place.

 IVY is by my side, elfin and mischievous.

 Ivy coughs and waves her hand in front of her.  "So much smoke..."

>furniture
 All this dark, meticulously polished wood, expertly carved into
 elegant forms...  It reminds me of my family home.

 Ivy coughs and pinches her nose.  "My eyes are really watering..."

>notebook
 She showed me some of the things she's doodled in there.  I'd already
 suspected her mind was of scientific interest, but I had no idea.

 Ivy touches my arm lightly.  "I can't take it anymore.  I'll be
 outside when you want to LEAVE."

 She hurries outside, pausing to wave at the doorman.

>leave








 "I used to come here as a kid to feed the ducks," Ivy says.  "Can we
 visit the pond?"

 I brush my hair back from my eyes.  "Of course.  If that's where
 Davenport is hiding."

 Hopewell Gardens
 A pleasant enough place, even if the smoke-blackened sky and tall
 buildings peering over the TREES leave one under no illusions that
 this is anywhere but smack in the middle of the city.

 We're on the cobbled square with the famous weeping fish FOUNTAIN.  A
 BENCH overlooks the area, upon which a courting COUPLE sit, side by
 side.

 A PRIESTESS lies sunning herself on the grass, some distance away.

 IVY is by my side, elfin and mischievous.

 IVY is by my side, elfin and mischievous.

>couple
 A gentleman and lady, both smartly dressed, perhaps a little older
 than Ivy and me.

 "They make a nice pair, don't you think?"  I suggest.

 Ivy mimes retching.

 Seeing her gesture, the couple both shoot me a pitying look, as if
 they think I should set my sights higher.

>priestess
 Although she mostly fits the part with her straight black hair and
 KALASIRIS, her pale skin marks her out as an Oldchester native.  I'd
 imagine that's the reason she's trying to get a tan.

 "She's judging me," Ivy says, following my gaze.  "I can tell."

>kalasiris
 A straight, white dress, the straps meeting behind her neck.  I'm
 really not sure if the hemline is higher than Ivy's.  The priestess is
 certainly showing more leg, but perhaps that's just because she's
 lying down and-

 "You look deep in thought," Ivy says.  "I s'pose any quiet moment is a
 chance to ponder mysteries, right?"

 I clear my throat.  "Yes, well."

>bench
 Someone has etched Silooette 4eva into the bench's arm.  Now, Ivy's
 spelling may not be perfect, but she can at least spell her own alias.
 This message must have been left by one of her fans.

>fountain
 The fountain takes the form of a huge, scaly fish.  Water cascades in
 torrents from the corners of its eyes and into a pool dotted with
 copper and silver coins.

 Ivy says, "Freaky.  Not sure I'd trust this thing with my wishes."

>trees
 Hopwell Gardens has always been surprisingly wooded.  It's not
 uncommon for people to get lost if they wander too far from the path.
 Peering into the anaemic, smog-poisoned trees, I think I can make out
 the tattered canvas of a TENT.

 Ivy cracks her knuckles.  "You have that distant look in your eye.
 The chase is afoot."

>ivy
 I glance over at Ivy.  I see a young woman, about the same age and
 height as me, slender, athletic, elfin.  Her hair is cut into a short
 bob and her features are untouched by rouge.

 Ivy is carrying a NOTEBOOK, a YELLOW letter, and a BLUE letter, and
 she's wearing a long JACKET, a short DRESS, and a CLOCHE hat.

>yellow
 Written on scrappy paper, damaged by moisture and stained by soil.
 It's hard to tell without chemical analysis, but it doesn't look like
 soil native to Oldchester.

 Saul

 Thought you got rid of me, did you?
 Well I'm on my way home.
 You'll get yours, city boy.

 From you know who.

>blue
 Written on paper that, while hardly rare, is certainly not
 inexpensive.  There's no letterhead.

 Saul,
    Our mutual friend is in the city.  Don't ask me how.  Perhaps you
 can pay him off?
    Rupert Wetherby

>tent
 I point at the tattered piece of canvas in the trees.  "Looks like
 someone's camping out."

 Ivy laughs.  "What kind of idiot would sleep in a tent in Hopewell
 Gardens?  Oh, wait...  Yeah, I've not been paying attention."

 A dirt path leads IN, towards the tent.

>in
 We follow the path into the woods, the sounds of civilisation growing
 distant behind us.

 Beneath the Ancient Oak
 The air here is cool and damp, the sky obscured by the broad green
 leaves of an immense and gnarled OAK.  A TENT canopy has been strung
 across its branches, and a BARREL of fish sits between its roots.

 An unkempt MAN sits cross-legged in the dirt.

 IVY is by my side, elfin and mischievous.

 Oh, and, by the way, a giant SQUID on robot legs hulks over us all,
 chained to the oak's trunk.

 Ivy grabs my arm.  "A squid on robot legs!  You were right!  I was
 right!  Leg it!"

 The man leaps to his feet, swinging a flare gun wildly in our
 direction.  "Not so fast, townies."

>squid
 This is it, then.  The largest living invertebrate.  A carnivore from
 the far side of the Tree of Life, that wrestles with whales in the
 black depths of the ocean.  With its enormous bug EYES and writhing
 TENTACLES, it could almost be a monster from Mars.

 A MUZZLE is fitted over its beak, and its elongated, arrowhead body is
 strapped into a set of robotic LEGS.

 "Nigel Davenport," I announce, "I'm arresting you for the murder of
 Saul Hawthorne.  The courts will look upon it favourably if you come
 quietly."

 He looks at me, then at Ivy, and then at me again.  And then he bursts
 out laughing.

>man
 I can see the resemblance to Hawthorne, I suppose.  Although it's
 obscured rather by his long, matted hair and untamed beard.

 He's bareheaded and clad in a suit of Martian SCALES.

 Davenport manages to control his mirth.  "This is what qualifies for
 strength and authority in the city, is it?  A lame pretty boy and a
 waif who can hardly see out from under her hat?  No, I think you have
 this situation all backwards."

>scale
 The scales shimmer in the light: rust red, coarse and dry.

 Ivy whispers to me, "You carry a gun, right?"

 I'm shocked.  "Of course not!  I abhor violence.  That's the very
 reason I became a police detective."

>cane
 A simple but sturdy walking stick, necessary since I was shot by an
 accomplice of the Bottle Street Strangler.

 "Look at you both," Davenport says.  "In your city clothes.  Prancing
 around like you own the world."

>barrel
 Stolen from a local fishmonger, I'm sure.  It's full of slimy, oily
 FISH.

 "I've seen creatures that thought they owned a world," Davenport
 continues, "and then found out the hard way."

>scales
 The scales shimmer in the light: rust red, coarse and dry.

 "Thought that was a meteorite, everyone did," Davenport says.  "Left
 that crater in the ice.  Didn't hang 'round long enough to find the
 truth."

>tent
 A tattered piece of canvas that seems to have attracted the filth of
 two continents like... well... some sort of...  filth magnet.

 Davenport winks.  It's a rather frightening sight.  "I'll tell you.
 I'll tell you what I found down there, and you'll wish I hadn't."

>legs
 The squid's robot legs are thickly armoured and crab-like.
 Petrol-driven, I suspect, given the noise.  As well as providing
 locomotion, they incorporate some sort of GILL apparatus.

 There's also a conspicuous LEVER in amongst the machinery.

 "This incredible machinery," I ask Davenport, "where did you get it?
 Who fashioned it?"

 "T-T-" he stammers, "that's none of your business, city boy!"

>lever
 Whatever it does, it's protected by the squid's ARMS and I have
 absolutely no chance of reaching it right now.  Better to focus on
 something else.

 "It was an ark," Davenport announces.  "A pharaoh-damned ark.  Those
 creatures.  Those creatures scratching at the ice - dull and savage.
 They were like us, once."

>fish
 When Davenport isn't looking, Ivy purloins a haddock.

 "DISTRACT him," she hisses.

 It seems she's formulated some sort of plan.

>arms
 Gathered in a writhing coil around its mouthparts are the squid's arms
 - eight muscular appendages lined with toothed suckers.  Although
 their reach is limited, once it's got hold of you with these, you're a
 goner for sure.  As Ivy might put it.

 Extending far beyond the squid's arms are its TENTACLES.

 Ivy whispers to me, "I don't understand what he's talking about."

 "Don't you read the papers?"  I whisper back.

 She shrugs.  "When I'm in them, sure."

>tentacles
>distract
 The squid has two long tentacles, each ending in an arrowhead of
 suckers.  They dart through the air like angry snakes.  Not to be
 confused with its ARMS.

 Davenport looks up at the blue sky.  "Mars.  Dry and cold and dead.
 But it was pleasant enough.  Once."

 I adjust my bowler and start to pace away from Ivy.  "You're quite
 right.  In fact, I see the error of my ways now.  Perhaps you could
 instruct me in a few survival techniques?"

 Davenport looks at me pityingly.  "The only teacher you need is Mother
 Nature.  But I warn you, she's a harsh schoolmarm indeed."

 I try to look disappointed.  "I see."

 Ivy discreetly slips the haddock into one of Davenport's pockets.

>eyes
 The squid stares at us with glassy eyes the size of dinner plates.

 "Creatures like us lived there," Davenport says.  "High 'n' mighty.
 Civilised.  But it counted for nothing when the oceans dried."

>muzzle
 "Don't worry," I tell Ivy, "it's not going to eat anyone while it's
 muzzled like that."

 "No," she agrees, "it'll just have to wring 'em out like a wet
 stocking instead."

 "Some of 'em fled," Davenport goes on.  "The ark.  Bet they were the
 smartest, the most civilised of all of them.  But all this time later,
 it don't count for nothing."

>gills
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>gill
 Among the intricate mass of machinery that supports the squid's
 existence on land is - obviously - a contraption for supplying it with
 oxygenated water.  I can see a glass CANISTER of water connected to a
 mass of HOSES and a PUMP.

 It reminds me of my carrion fly experiment.  Actually, I wonder how
 that's going...

 Ivy pokes me in the ribs.  "Please don't start daydreaming when we're
 face to face with a sea monster."

>pump
 I'll be honest, I have no great technical appreciation of water or air
 pumps.  Though after this, I'll be sure to do some research.

 "There they are," Davenport says.  "Scratching at the ice like
 beggars.  Savages.  Feeding the weak to the many-armed monsters that
 came with 'em.  No politeness.  No etiquette.  No pretence.  Just do
 or die."

>canister
 Don't let the fact it's glass fool you: it must be pretty tough to
 contain water at deep-sea pressures.

 "And you, pretty boy," Davenport says, pointing at me, "you think this
 could never happen to us?  How'd you get by without that cane of
 yours?"

 "Always rather badly," I admit.  He seems satisfied at that.

>hoses
 Yes, I suspect that these hoses are this thing's weak spot.  But we
 have no chance of getting close to them while the squid's tentacles
 are free.

 "We got rid of everything worthwhile," Davenport says.  "And we
 replaced it all with this civilisation.  Made up nonsense.
 Distractions.  Anything except engaging with the real world.  With the
 harsh realities."

>lever
 Whatever it does, it's protected by the squid's ARMS and I have
 absolutely no chance of reaching it right now.  Better to focus on
 something else.

 Davenport waves an arm at the city we can just about make out through
 the trees.  "And what happens when all this goes the way of Mars?  How
 many of us will survive?  How many of us even have the least idea how
 to?"

>look
 Beneath the Ancient Oak
 The air here is cool and damp, the sky obscured by the broad green
 leaves of an immense and gnarled OAK.  A TENT canopy has been strung
 across its branches, and a BARREL of fish sits between its roots.

 An unkempt MAN stands before us, aiming a flare gun in our direction.

 IVY is by my side, elfin and mischievous.

 Oh, and, by the way, a giant SQUID on robot legs hulks over us all,
 chained to the oak's trunk.

 "You're probably right about that," I admit.  "Our civilisation could
 probably fall apart.  Go the way of Mars.  And that'd write off those
 of us who rely on it.  But, well, so what?"

 Ivy sighs.  "Oh yeah, provoke him.  That's a great idea."

>oak
 I suppose this venerable old organism must give even the giant squid a
 run for its money in the size and strength stakes, inanimate though it
 may be.

 Davenport's made a bit of a mockery of the poor thing, suspending his
 TENT from its branches and looping the squid's CHAIN around its thick
 trunk and branches.

 Davenport stammers.  "Wh- what do you mean, so what?"

 "I mean: so what?  Civilisation is about trying to make lives pleasant
 and easy, but we still wind up dead in the end.  I'm a homicide
 detective, I know that as well as anyone.  I don't see that death - on
 a personal or global scale - is a convincing reason to give up on
 trying to make lives better while we still can."

>chain
 The chain is wrapped and wound and knotted in all manner of fantastic
 ways.  I bet this fellow was a dedicated boy scout.  Although, now
 that I look at it, a lot of the tension in the chain seems to be held
 by a single ice SCREW hammered into the ground.

 Davenport looks confused.  Confused and angry.

 Ivy grabs hold of my wrist, ready to make a run for it.  "You've done
 it now..."

>screw
 I jam the tip of my cane under the ice screw and steadily work it out
 of the ground.  The chain restraining the giant squid unravels in a
 single fluid motion and the beast takes a few experimental steps
 forward on its stubby metal feet.

 Davenport is ranting, "That's what you don't understand: nature can't
 be tamed, can't be restrained, and all your civilisation will count
 for nothing when it comes for you!"

 The squid's tentacles grab hold of him, crumpling his body up into a
 mangled mass.  He dies with a sharp squeal of surprise.

 Ivy slips under my arm and pulls it around her shoulders.  "Yeah, I
 think we should leave pretty quickly now..."

 (Press space...)








 Hopewell Gardens
 IVY drags me out of the woods and onto the cobbled square.  The park
 is just as we left it.  Birds sing, couples court, children frolic.

 Ivy screams, "Everybody run!  A giant squid on robot legs is coming!"

 The people around the park just stare at her.

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "screw".

 She showed me some of the things she's doodled in there.  I'd already
 suspected her mind was of scientific interest, but I had no idea.

 Davenport waves the flare gun at us.  "Yeah, but... civilisation is
 just a thin veneer!  Think you're so smart.  Think you're so great.
 You don't know nothing.  I'll show you.  I got that lying ponce.  I'll
 get that one-eyed back-stabber too.  After that, well, I'll show you
 what your civilisation amounts to!"

>wait
 I wait patiently.  Ivy squirms.

 Davenport's almost muttering to himself now.  "Yeah, I'll show you a
 little Martian savagery.  If you're too weak to live, you won't escape
 the long arms of the monster.  That's the way.  That's how we do
 things on Mars..."

 Ivy relaxes.  "I think you broke him."

>wait
 I wait patiently.  Ivy squirms.

 Davenport continues to rant and mutter about Mars and civilisation and
 how he'll show us all.

>screw
 I jam the tip of my cane under the ice screw and steadily work it out

 single fluid motion and the beast takes a few experimental steps
 forward on its stubby metal feet.

 Ivy screams, "Everybody run!  A giant squid on robot legs is coming!"

 The people around the park just stare at her.

>ivy
 Clanking machinery draws near, and I turn towards the trees.  "It
 seems to have taken a shine to us," I tell Ivy.

 She throws up her hands.  "Lovely.  And you can't run?"

 I shake my head.  "Perhaps you should."

 She rolls up her sleeves.  "Oh yeah, that'd prove a lot of people
 right, wouldn't it?"

 Mechanical legs pistoning, tentacles writhing through the air, the
 giant SQUID bursts out of the trees.

 After a moment of shocked silence, people begin to scream and run.

 Ivy yells, "I told you!"

>squid
>squid
 An elongated creature with enormous, round EYES.  Its many short ARMS
 are curled around the robotic LEGS that support it, while its two
 longer TENTACLES roam freely through the air.

 A MUZZLE is strapped tightly over its beak.

 The squid grabs Ivy around the waist with a tentacle and lifts her
 into the air.

 Understandably, she screams.

 "Relax!"  I shout up to her.  "This creature was raised by a human.
 It sees itself as one of us, and it won't kill without a direct order
 from Davenport.  I'm sure it just wants to assert itself over us and
 cement its place in the pack."

 The squid gives Ivy a good shake.  "I'm really reassured," she yells,
 "now get me down from here!"

 An elongated creature with enormous, round EYES.  Its many short ARMS
 are curled around the robotic LEGS that support it, while its two
 longer TENTACLES roam freely through the air.

 A MUZZLE is strapped tightly over its beak.

 The squid holds Ivy directly above me.  She grabs at her dress and
 crosses her legs.  "Hey, don't look!  I thought you were a gentleman!"

>ivy
 One of the squid's tentacles is wrapped firmly around Ivy's waist,
 holding her up in the air.

 Ivy is carrying a NOTEBOOK, a YELLOW letter, and a BLUE letter, and
 she's wearing a long JACKET, a short DRESS, and a CLOCHE hat.

 "Whatever you do," I shout at Ivy, "don't think like a fish!"

>eyes
 I poke the squid in the eye with my cane.  It screeches and writhes,
 coiling and uncoiling its tentacles in discomfort.

 Ivy falls to the ground.  She lands flat on her backside with a
 surprised squeak.

>legs
 The squid's robot legs are thickly armoured and crab-like.
 Petrol-driven, I suspect, given the noise.  As well as providing
 locomotion, they incorporate some sort of GILL apparatus.

 There's also a conspicuous LEVER in amongst the machinery.

 The squid grabs me around the waist with a tentacle and lifts me into
 the air.  My hat flies off and tumbles to the ground.

 Ivy cups her hands around her mouth and shouts, "Nate!  Hold on!  I'll
 save you!"

>lever
 Whatever it does, it's protected by the squid's ARMS and I have
 absolutely no chance of reaching it right now.  Better to focus on
 something else.

 Ivy runs right up to the squid and punches it in the eye.  It
 screeches and writhes, coiling and uncoiling its tentacles in
 discomfort.

 The squid releases me and I land hard, my bad leg giving out beneath
 me.  Ivy helps me to my feet.

>arms
 Gathered in a writhing coil around its mouthparts are the squid's arms
 - eight muscular appendages lined with toothed suckers.  Although
 their reach is limited, once it's got hold of you with these, you're a
 goner for sure.  As Ivy might put it.

 Extending far beyond the squid's arms are its TENTACLES.

 Ivy tries to punch ineffectually at a tentacle, swiping at thin air.

>hose
 We have no chance of getting close to the hoses while the squid's
 tentacles are free.

 Ivy growls with frustration.  "Where are the police when you actually
 need them for once?"

 "On their way," I reply, glossing over the fact that we are the
 police.  "But until then, it's just us."

>lever
 Whatever it does, it's protected by the squid's ARMS and I have
 absolutely no chance of reaching it right now.  Better to focus on
 something else.

 The squid grabs Ivy around the waist with a tentacle and lifts her
 into the air.

 Ivy yelps.  "Poke its EYE again, Nate!  Get me down!"

>hose
 We have no chance of getting close to the hoses while the squid's
 tentacles are free.

 "Don't worry!"  I call up to Ivy.  "I'll think of something!"

>eye
 I poke the squid in the eye with my cane.  It screeches and writhes,
 coiling and uncoiling its tentacles in discomfort.

 Ivy falls to the ground.  She lands flat on her backside with a
 surprised squeak.

 The squid has two long tentacles, each ending in an arrowhead of
 suckers.  They dart through the air like angry snakes.  Not to be
 confused with its ARMS.

 The squid grabs me around the waist with a tentacle and lifts me into
 the air.

 Ivy cups her hands around her mouth and shouts, "Nate!  Hold on!  I'll
 save you!"

>knees
 Ivy's bare legs are slender, pale, eminently distracting...

 She looks in my direction and I glance quickly away.

 Ivy runs right up to the squid and punches it in the eye.  It
 screeches and writhes, coiling and uncoiling its tentacles in
 discomfort.

 The squid releases me and I land hard, my bad leg giving out beneath
 me.  Ivy helps me to my feet.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The squid hoots eerily, the sound reverberating across the square.

>wait
 Time passes...

 "It must have a weakness," Ivy says.  "If fish are frightened of
 squid... what are squid frightened of?"

 "Sperm whales."

 Ivy looks thoughtful.  "I s'pose there's not so many of those around.
 Unless-"

 I shake my head.  "No.  Not even then."

>look
 Hopewell Gardens
 This cobbled square, surrounded on all sides by TREES, is home to a
 FOUNTAIN and a BENCH.

 I see a BOWLER hat here.

 IVY is close by my side, sleeves rolled up and fists clenched.

 The giant SQUID stands astride the square on crab-like robot LEGS,
 TENTACLES writhing in the air.

 The squid grabs Ivy around the waist with a tentacle and lifts her
 into the air.

 Ivy yelps.  "Poke its EYE again, Nate!  Get me down!"

>bowler
 It's the nature of this line of work that my bowler spends more time
 in my hands than on my head.

 "Nate!"  Ivy shouts.  "Do something!"

>fountain
 The fountain takes the form of a huge, scaly fish.  Something that you
 might expect the squid to take an interest in, if only I could draw
 its attention to it.  Unfortunately, I'm not really mobile enough to
 get in the fountain, and Ivy's presently otherwise engaged.

 The squid dangles Ivy upside down.  "I s'pose I'm used to this by
 now..." she mutters.

>ivy
 One of the squid's tentacles is wrapped firmly around Ivy's waist,
 holding her up in the air.

 Ivy is carrying a NOTEBOOK, a YELLOW letter, and a BLUE letter, and
 she's wearing a long JACKET, a short DRESS, and a CLOCHE hat.

 Ivy yells, "Put me down you big, smelly... cephalopod!"

>eye
 I poke the squid in the eye with my cane.  It screeches and writhes,
 coiling and uncoiling its tentacles in discomfort.

 Ivy falls to the ground.  She lands flat on her backside with a
 surprised squeak.

>wait
 Time passes...

 "I think Hawthorne's fish was braver than we gave it credit for!"  Ivy
 says.

>fountain
 "Ivy," I exclaim, "the fountain!"

 She grasps my intent immediately.  "The fish!"

 Hiking up her dress, Ivy leaps into the fountain with a splash and
 begins waving her arms.  "Hey, grabby!  Your mortal enemy is right
 here!  He says your mother was a snail and your father a lounge
 lizard!"

 "Ivy, watch out!"

 She dives aside just as the squid wraps a tentacle around the
 fountain.  Despite its best efforts, the beast is unable to dislodge
 the stone fish.  That's one fewer tentacle to worry about.

>tentacle
 The squid has two long tentacles, each ending in an arrowhead of
 suckers.  They dart through the air like angry snakes.  Not to be
 confused with its ARMS.

 Ivy makes a run towards the squid's robot legs, but it knocks her back
 effortlessly.

>bench
 Someone has etched Silooette 4eva into the bench's arm.  Now, Ivy's
 spelling may not be perfect, but she can at least spell her own alias.
 This message must have been left by one of her fans.

 The squid grabs me around the waist with a tentacle and lifts me into
 the air.

 Ivy cups her hands around her mouth and shouts, "Nate!  Hold on!  I'll
 save you!"

>lever
 Whatever it does, it's protected by the squid's ARMS and I have
 absolutely no chance of reaching it right now.  Better to focus on
 something else.

 Ivy runs right up to the squid and punches it in the eye.  It
 screeches and writhes, coiling and uncoiling its tentacles in
 discomfort.

 The squid releases me and I land hard, my bad leg giving out beneath
 me.  Ivy helps me to my feet.

>look
 Hopewell Gardens
 This cobbled square, surrounded on all sides by TREES, is home to a
 FOUNTAIN and a BENCH.

 I see a BOWLER hat here.

 IVY is close by my side, sleeves rolled up and fists clenched.

 The giant SQUID stands astride the square on crab-like robot LEGS, its
 TENTACLES divided between grasping the fish fountain and swiping at
 us.

 The squid bats my hat about on the ground with a tentacle.  That's a
 bit much - to single out a man's hat.

>trees
 They have the unhealthy look of trees that have seen a modern city
 sprout up around them.

 The squid knocks Ivy's legs out from under her with a tentacle.  She
 manages to land on all fours and right herself quickly.

>inventory
 I am carrying a CANE and a police BADGE, and I'm wearing a three-piece
 SUIT.

 The squid grabs Ivy around the waist with a tentacle and lifts her
 into the air.

 Ivy yelps.  "Poke its EYE again, Nate!  Get me down!"

>suit
 There being no consistent dress code for murder scenes, I tend to
 dress as if for a funeral.  My suit is black and carefully pressed.

 The squid waves Ivy idly in the air.  "I'm going to throw up in a
 minute," she shouts.

>hat
 Which hat do you mean, the cloche hat, or the bowler hat?

>bowler
 It's the nature of this line of work that my bowler spends more time
 in my hands than on my head.

 Ivy tries spitting at the squid, to no obvious effect.  "Hey, I'm no
 lady!" she shouts, in answer to my expression.

>squid
 An elongated creature with enormous, round EYES.  Its many short ARMS
 are curled around the robotic LEGS that support it, while of its two
 longer TENTACLES, one roams freely through the air and the other
 grasps vainly at the stone fish.

 A MUZZLE is strapped tightly over its beak.

 The squid shakes Ivy vigorously and she, uh, lets out a stream of
 obscenities that I shan't repeat.

>muzzle
 "Don't worry," I tell Ivy, "it's not going to eat anyone while it's
 muzzled like that."

 "No," she agrees, "it'll just have to wring 'em out like a wet
 stocking instead."

 Ivy waves her arms.  "Don't forget about me!"

>arm
 Gathered in a writhing coil around its mouthparts are the squid's arms
 - eight muscular appendages lined with toothed suckers.  Although
 their reach is limited, once it's got hold of you with these, you're a
 goner for sure.  As Ivy might put it.

 Extending far beyond the squid's arms are its TENTACLES.

 The squid half drops Ivy and catches her.  She grips the tentacle with
 white knuckles.

>look
 Hopewell Gardens
 This cobbled square, surrounded on all sides by TREES, is home to a
 FOUNTAIN and a BENCH.

 I see a BOWLER hat here.

 The giant SQUID stands astride the square on crab-like robot LEGS, its
 TENTACLES occupied with Ivy and the fish fountain.

 IVY is being held high in the air by one of the squid's tentacles.

 Ivy tries to kick at the squid, but it's holding her at tentacle's
 length.

>fountain
 The fountain takes the form of a huge, scaly fish.  It's currently
 presenting a stony front to the squid's attempts to overpower it with
 a tentacle.

 Ivy punches the tentacle that's holding her, and then clutches her
 hand.  "Ouch!  It's tough..."

>pump
 I'll be honest, I have no great technical appreciation of water or air
 pumps.  Though after this, I'll be sure to do some research.

 "Don't worry!"  I call up to Ivy.  "I'll think of something!"

>hose
 I slide my cane into the hoses and lever it upwards, putting all the
 effort I can into it, my bad leg screaming with pain.

 With an ear-splitting hiss, water begins to spray out of the bottom of
 the gill apparatus, blasting across the cobbles at high pressure.  The
 squid's eyes bulge, and it staggers drunkenly to one side.  Its
 robotic legs slam into the fountain with the sound of metal grating
 against stone.

 Ivy falls to the ground.  She lands flat on her backside with a
 surprised squeak.

>SAVE
>cf2
 Saved.

>lever
 I approach the squid cautiously.  Ivy trails behind me, pulling back
 on my sleeve.  "Nate..."

 The lever's deep in among the complex machinery of the robotic legs,
 within reach of the the squid's eight short arms.  I wait carefully
 for my moment, and then dart out a hand to pull the lever home.

 The squid knocks me back reflexively with a tentacle, and I tumble
 down onto the cobbles in a heap with Ivy.  Something inside the
 robotic legs clanks and whirrs.

 With a series of chunky clicks, the bizarre contraption releases its
 harness.  The squid slides into the fountain with an almighty splash.

 And then FORTHRIGHT storms into the square with a dozen blue-uniformed
 CONSTABLES.

 Ivy folds her arms.  "Perfect timing."

 Forthright adjusts his bowler.  "What in the blazes happened here?"

>constables
 Moustachioed men in blue coats and tall hats.  Every so often one of
 them glances disapprovingly in my direction.  They generally only have
 to deal with this sort of thing when I'm working on the case.

>squid
>ivy
 It seems happy enough to be free of Davenport's contraption.  And I
 imagine it's spent enough time at surface pressure to be content in
 the fountain water for a while.

 I glance over at Ivy.  I see a young woman, about the same age and
 height as me, slender, athletic, elfin.  Her hair is cut into a short
 bob and her features are untouched by rouge.

 Ivy is carrying a NOTEBOOK, a YELLOW letter, and a BLUE letter, and
 she's wearing a long JACKET, a short DRESS, and a CLOCHE hat.

>forthright
 "Inspector," I say to Forthright, "see that this animal is transported
 humanely to the Institute for Marine Biology.  Given time they may be
 able to reintroduce it to its natural habitat."

 Forthright looks at me in that way he does so often.  "Right... okay."

 "And have that strange contraption moved to Bridge House.  I shall
 need to investigate it further."

 Forthright studies the scene before him and scratches his head.
 "Right you are.  I've got this under control.  You two could probably
 use a break."

 "Oh indeed," Ivy says unctuously.  "We really must be going.  Have fun
 with the grabby squid."

 Forthright doffs his hat to her condescendingly.  "Pleasant day,
 madam."

>bowler
 It's the nature of this line of work that my bowler spends more time
 in my hands than on my head.

 I think we can safely LEAVE now.

>kiss
>look
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

 Hopewell Gardens
 This cobbled square, surrounded on all sides by TREES, is home to a
 FOUNTAIN and a BENCH.

 I see a BOWLER hat here.

 IVY is by my side, elfin and mischievous.

 FORTHRIGHT stands here, hands on his lapels, trying to look like he's
 in charge of the situation.

 The giant SQUID splashes about happily in the fountain, its robotic
 LEGS now abandoned.

 A group of blue-uniformed CONSTABLES stand around the square,
 wondering what to do with the creature.

>legs
 Thickly armoured and crab-like.  Although there's nothing too unusual
 about their construction, I have to wonder where exactly a person like
 Davenport was able to obtain machinery like this.

>leave
 Ivy slips her arm in mine and sets my bowler on my head at a jaunty
 angle.  I straighten it.

 "I need a cup of tea after that," I say.

 (Press space...)








 It's me again: your favourite dissident turned detective.  Okay, let's
 get this over with.

 I feel sort of naked without my hat.

 Oldchester Museum
 NATE and me come in through the fancy double DOORS, awkward and out of
 place.

 We're greeted by a beautiful woman in a kalasiris.  "I am Haqikah,"
 she says, "God's Wife of Amun.  The Pharaoh will see you now."

 She turns from us with impossible grace and glides further IN to the
 museum.

 "I don't know about this, Nate," I whisper.  "It's not all that long
 ago I was being tried for blasphemy."

 "You were tried for plenty of other things as well," he reassures me.

>nate
 He's looking very fine and dandy tonight, in an immaculately tailored
 TUXEDO.  His hair's its usual disobedient self, which only adds to his
 charm.

 Nate is carrying a CANE.

>tuxedo
 I bet he actually owns this tuxedo.  It's not rented or anything.
 That's what it is to be posh - you pronounce everything perfectly and
 you own your own evening wear.

>inventory
 I am carrying nothing, and am wearing a long DRESS.

>cane
 Nate leans heavily on a smart black walking stick.

>dress
 This must be the most expensive thing I've ever worn, and I'm not
 entirely sure why.  Okay, it's a gorgeous, floor-length dress, but
 it's also just a thin bit of material and it doesn't even have
 sleeves.

 Nate sees me looking down at myself and says, "You look perfect."

 I stare at the floor.  "I'm going to pay you back."

 He shrugs.  "Keep it."

 Yeah, well, I'll pay him back - you'll see.

>doors
 I look at the way out and consider just making a break for it.

 Nate holds out his delicate HAND so I can see he's trembling, ever so
 slightly.  "I'm nervous too," he says.  "I've not exactly been much of
 a friend to the rich and powerful.  But we're in enough trouble as it
 is."

 "Sooner or later," I tell him, "you'll get sick of being right all the
 time."

>hand
 I grab Nate's hand, squeezing his slender fingers.

 "If they feed us to a crocodile," I tell him, "let it eat me first,
 and I'll choke it from the inside while you escape."

 "That's very noble of you, Ivy."

 He doesn't think I'm being serious.

>in
 I squeeze Nate's hand until he winces and laughs, and then we walk
 forward, together.

 Pharaoh Exhibit
 This place is all marble pillars and soft lighting.  Most of the space
 is taken up by a low platform with the pharaoh's SARCOPHAGUS on it -
 which is hooked up to all sorts of MACHINERY and surrounded by
 half-naked SERVANTS.

 HAQIKAH stands between us and the pharaoh, looking properly serene and
 dignified.

 NATE's close by, clutching his cane.

>haqikah
 Haqikah's a tall, dark woman with hair that falls straight to her
 waist.  She's at the centre of a glittering constellation of
 JEWELLERY, and she's wearing a sheer KALASIRIS almost like it's an
 afterthought.

 "Presenting," Haqikah announces grandiosely, "Inspector Nathaniel
 Walker of the Oldchester Constabulary, and Miss Ivy Blissheart of the
 Mindflower Asylum for the Criminally Insane."

 Um... couldn't she have said my old workplace or something?

>notebook
 Sorry, but that's not a keyword you can use right now.

>servants
 I won't describe them in too much detail, cos it wouldn't be proper.
 Let's just say I feel better about not having my hat with me.

 The speaker on top of the sarcophagus crackles, and a buzzing voice
 emerges.  "It has been many centuries since I last heard of champions
 defeating a monster."

 Nate says, "I'm really not sure we- Ouch!"

 I'm standing on his foot.

>machinery
 Nate could probably tell you what all this machinery is.  Me, I just
 see a load of hoses snaking into the SARCOPHAGUS, something a bit like
 a wireless, some flashing lights and bubbling beakers - and, sitting
 right on top of the sarcophagus, a big, elegant gramophone speaker.

 The buzzing voice continues.  "This strange city needs champions.
 Henceforth you are both Special Detectives to the Office of the
 Pharaoh."

 Haqikah hands a BADGE each to Nate and me.

>sarcophagus
 A big, gold, person-shaped coffin, lying down on its back.  The face
 looks sort of aloof and not bothered about anything.  Pulsating hoses
 snake into it from the surrounding MACHINERY.

 "Blasphemer!" the speaker booms, and I almost jump out of my skin.
 "Know that your living god is merciful."

 Haqikah hands me a sheet of PAPYRUS.  I take it with wildly shaking
 hands.

>badge
 So it looks like I'm now a woman policeman.  I wonder if I outrank
 Forthright?

 Nate looks up from his shiny new badge.  "I want the Old Warren desk."

 Haqikah looks surprised, and the Phararoh's electric voice is silent.

 Should I SPEAK up or just WAIT quietly?

>papyrus
 The papyrus bears writing in neat calligraphy:

 By Order of the Pharaoh:
 Miss Ivy Blissheart is hereby pardoned for her crimes and blasphemies.
 Her actions before this date must never be considered when judging her
 innocence or sanity.

 And then it's signed by Haqikah and stamped with wax.

 "Very well," the Pharaoh's voice says.  "You shall bring My justice to
 the destitute and filthy in their narrow streets."

 Nate brushes his hair back from his eyes... and smiles.

 (Press space...)








 They step out of the museum side by side - the young man in the
 bowler, leaning on his cane; the young woman in the battered jacket,
 her hat brim low over her eyes.

 "Our first case together," she says, "and we wrestle a mechanised
 squid and have an audience with the Pharaoh.  Is it always like this?"

 He looks thoughtful.  "Sometimes it's like this."

 "So... what now?"

 "Tea", he says.  "There'll be crime and mystery soon enough.  Before
 all that, we need a cup of tea."

 They walk to the motor car in silence - the only sounds their
 footsteps and the low murmur of the city.

 "Mine's with three sugars," she adds.

 HAQIKAH stands between us and the pharaoh, looking properly serene and

 NATE's close by, clutching his cane.

>speak

 I clear my throat.  Everyone looks at me.

 I'm, uh, not really good at public speaking.  Graffiti is more my
 medium.  Okay, here goes.

 "Look, I know we're a right pair of misfits, but all we've ever tried
 to do is what we thought was right.  If we can help people who need
 help and don't often get it, then I think, you know, that'd be a real
 opportunity for us."

 My voice sounds really squeaky.  I swallow.  "And, you know, maybe
 some people who don't think the Pharaoh cares about them will, you
 know..."  I trail off.

 Haqikah raises an eyebrow.  At least Nate seems pleased with my little
 speech.

 "Very well," the Pharaoh's voice says.  "You shall bring My justice to
 the destitute and filthy in their narrow streets."

 Nate brushes his hair back from his eyes... and smiles.
