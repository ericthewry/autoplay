 Hello! Welcome to ClubFloyd! I'm Floyd, the host of the yami-nabe party
 we'll be having today.

 Yami-nabe (literally translated as "hot pot of darkness") is a
 variation of hot pot dish where members of a party can bring their own
 ingredients to put in a hot pot. The hot pot is cooked and eaten in the
 dark, so anyone can add whatever they want without getting caught! And
 because it's dark, you won't know what you get until you taste it, so
 you might be in for some surprises!

 When we begin, you can put any ingredient you want by sending the
 command "ADD [ingredient]". Of course, it wouldn't be very much of a
 secret if everyone knows what you're adding, right? So instead of
 typing the command "F ADD [ingredient]", you can type "WF ADD
 [ingredient]" to secretly add the ingredient you want.

 When you're ready to eat, just send the command "EAT" to try something
 that was added to the pot!

 We will automatically finish up once there is nothing left in the pot,
 but if you'd like to end earlier, you can type "DONE" to finish and see
 what was remaining.
>wf add carrots

 It's another nice, sunny day outside. The bird are singing, the
 flowers are beaming, and all is well.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 Well, that's what you assume, since in actual fact you're inside a
 brand new office on the sixth floor of the Weiner Corporation's newest
 skyscraper. At any rate, the job pays well, and your day usually
 passes by without any notable incidents to marr its pleasing monotony.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 But something is different today. Cold sweat glistens on your brow.
 You know all too well what this means.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 Somewhere...somehow... a duck is watching you.

 Release 1 / Serial number 161231 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle i">Office</span> (on the office chair)
 One entire wall (the north one, as it happens) is nothing else but a
 great pane of glass, through which you can see the cityscape that lies
 outside. The office itself is sparsely furnished: it is equipped with
 merely a desk, a fax machine, a telephone and a cow. To the south is
 an open door.

 A long wire extends across the room, originating from the fax machine.

>examine me

 You've never really looked at yourself in a mirror. In fact, you tend
 to avoid mirrors like the plague, to such an extent that you're not
 sure what you really look like.

 You're sure of it. There's a duck watching you right now.

>examine cow

 It's leaning against the wall, legs crossed, smoking a cigarette. What
 is it doing here? You have not the slightest idea, and you're not
 really interested in finding out. What you really want to find... is
 that DUCK!

 You wipe off a bead of sweat. Why did it have to be here? Why did it
 have to be now? Why? WHY?

>ask cow about duck

 You could just try to engage in casual conversation. One way of doing
 this is by typing TALK TO NPC into the command prompt.  <span class="floydstyle em">(Oh, crap,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">I just broke the fourth wall. Who's going to pay for that, I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">wonder?)</span>
 You loosen your tie with one hand, and glance around fearfully.

>examine fourth wall

 You can't see any such thing.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle i">Office</span> (on the office chair)
 One entire wall (the north one, as it happens) is nothing else but a
 great pane of glass, through which you can see the cityscape that lies
 outside. The office itself is sparsely furnished: it is equipped with
 merely a desk, a fax machine, a telephone and a cow. To the south is
 an open door.

 A long wire extends across the room, originating from the fax machine.

 You have no choice. You have to find that duck, track it down, hound
 it, chase it to the ends of the earth if necessary. Thus is the price
 you must pay for peace of mind.

>talk to cow

 You cough. The cow coughs. For a moment, silence hangs heavy upon both
 of you.

 "So. Ahem."

 "You wanted to ask me something, boss?" the cow says finally, chewing
 on its cigarette in a typically bovine manner.

 1) "Do you see that duck?"
 2) "What are you doing here?"

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["What are you doing here?"]</span>

 "Don't you remember, boss?" the cow says, slapping you on the back
 with one hoof. "We're corporate spies working for ACME. This is an
 undercover operation, okay? I see what's wrong with you: you've been
 trying to use the "How to Brainwash Yourself Easily" book again. If
 you've got amnesia, we gotta exfiltrate ourselves <span class="floydstyle em">pronto</span> and
 burn the evidence. Have you got amnesia, boss?"

 1) "I haven't got amnesia, you idiot!"
 2) "I can't remember anything! What is my REAL identity?"

>1

 <span class="floydstyle em">["I haven't got amnesia, you idiot!"]</span>

 "Phoooey," the cow sighs with relief, tugging at its cigarette
 compulsively. "You had me worried there for a second." And upon these
 words, it begins to stare intensively at the wall, as though waiting
 for ninja chipmunks to leap out without warning.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Office</span> (on the office chair)
 One entire wall (the north one, as it happens) is nothing else but a
 great pane of glass, through which you can see the cityscape that lies
 outside. The office itself is sparsely furnished: it is equipped with
 merely a desk, a fax machine, a telephone and a cow. To the south is
 an open door.

 A long wire extends across the room, originating from the fax machine.

 You can feel the duck's beady dark eyes boring into the back of your
 skull.

>examine wire

 It's too thick to cut with scissors, sadly enough.

 Though the duck is not in the room, still you feel its baleful glare,
 unwavering, unblinking.

>follow wire

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine chipmunks

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine pane

 It's made of glass.

 You bang your head against the furniture, heart bowed down beneath a
 seething cloud of paranoia.

>examine fax

 It's a great, heavy monster of bureaucratic hell. With its aid, you
 could fax a dinosaur to Hawaii, that's telling you how sophisticated
 it is. It's powered by a very, very long electric wire which crosses
 the floor and disappears out into the corridor to the south. Oh, and
 it's also blatantly simple to use: all that is necessary is to put
 something in it, and then dial any number between 0 and 10. The fax
 machine has been customized specifically for faxing things to a very
 specific destination.

 You must do something about that duck. There is no other way.

>examine desk

 It's an IKEA desk, somewhat disfigured by coffee rings (from all the
 times you left your hot mug of coffee on the desk for far too much
 time). And certainly it would be nice to have more than just the one
 drawer for tidying away your stuff. But it's perfectly adequate for
 the kind of work you do for the Weiner Corporation -- namely, sorting
 through piles of mail. Such as the huge heap now standing before you.

 Something must be done.

>examine cityscape

 New Dork City stretches out before you in its full glory. But what
 interests you most of all is the building opposite the one you're
 currently in: the ACME Corporation's newest skycraper.

 All this stress and paranoia proves far too much for you. With a
 wordless cry you throw yourself out the window!

 Actually, you do not throw yourself out of the window, you merely
 bounce off it with a muffled "PANG", and then stagger out into the
 corridor, nursing your blossoming bruise.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 The corridor heads off to the east and west, and you can always choose
 to re-enter your office to the north, via an open door upon which your
 name and job have been inscribed in a decidedly shoddy fashion. There
 is a faint aroma in the air, but that is not important.

 A long wire snakes its way out from your office, and heads down the
 corridor to the east.


>examine mail

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine door

 Upon it are the following (badly-inked) words: <span class="floydstyle i">M. POND --</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">MAILROOM</span>

>sort piles

 You can't see any such thing.

 great pane of glass, through which you can see the cityscape that lies

 merely a desk, a fax machine, a telephone and a cow. To the south is
 an open door.

 The office chair stands upon its wobbly wheels, sighing slightly.

 A long wire extends across the room, originating from the fax machine.

>sort mail

 You find a letter from none other than "Mr. Coffee Machine"! How odd.
 A quick glance indicates that he is appealing to the powers that be
 for the right to have his own office chair.

>open drawer

 You pull open the drawer, and find only a lonely-looking pair of
 scissors. You decide after some deliberation to take this with you
 (you never know when it might come in handy...)

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a pair of scissors
   a shirt (being worn)
   a tie (being worn)

>sort mail

 You find a letter from none other than "Mr. Coffee Machine"! How odd.
 A quick glance indicates that he is appealing to the powers that be
 for the right to have his own office chair.

>examine chair

 It's a sturdy thing, with sturdy wheels that are always well oiled
 (you suspect that the office elves do all that work when no one is
 looking.)

 You have a strange and most peculiar feeling that it will come in
 handy at some point in the immediate future.

>get letter

 You can't see any such thing.

>get mail

 That's hardly portable.

>take off shirt

 You take off the shirt.

>examine tie

 Suitably unfashionable.

>examine duck

 It's too far away for you to tell, but it appears to be staring at you
 in an unsettling way.

>examine telephone

 It's a pink telephone with yellow flowers painted on it. It's quite...
 stylish? As you stare at it, the thought occurs to you that it might
 be a good idea to call someone.

 In fact, there are plenty of people you could call. You have their
 numbers memorized by heart, as a matter of fact. You could contact...

 It's covered in squid ink stains (don't ask why). You feel something
 heavy in your breast pocket, and it's definitely not your heart.

>examine building

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine acme

 You glance at it through the glass window, and shudder. The duck is
 there, peering out through an office window, staring at you through
 caricatural binoculars.

>examine pocket

 You squint and squirm, but conclude that the only way to find out
 what's inside is to boldly go forth and SEARCH it.

>search pocket

 In the breast pocket is a portable squid.

>get squid

 Taken.

>get squid

 You already have that.

>examine it

 It's an extremely tiny, adorable little squid about the size of a
 fountain pen. Every now and then, it makes cute squid noises.

>squeeze squid

 You squeeze the squid gently, and before you know it it squirts ink
 all over your face! Instant karma, indeed.

 After several minutes of mildly annoying music, you finally get a
 response:

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Hello, how may I help you?"</span>

 "Um, I'm not sure..."

 <span class="floydstyle em">"That's not a problem at all. We cater to all needs: the Clown</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coffee Room</span>
 Coffee rooms are the lungs of the Weiner Corporation, filled with
 caffeine to the same extent that the lungs of excessively successful
 businessmen are habitually filled with nicotine.

 On the wall, someone has carelessly pinned a poster for the latest
 movie blockbuster. That's clearly a violation of company policy.

 Lurking in the corner of the room, looking rather disgruntled, is the
 coffee machine.

 A long wire comes into the room from the west, and you perceive that
 it is connected to a plug in the wall. Why anyone thought this was
 necessary is rather hard to divine.

>examine poster

 It advertises the latest action movie: FLY HARD, with Braaawk Willis
 playing a daredevil chicken cop facing off against Alan Cricketman's
 stereotypically six-legged (and German!) baddie. The poster shows the
 main character jumping off an exploding skyscraper with a (live)
 electric wire tied around himself. The tagline reads: "<span class="floydstyle em">Always in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the wrong place at the wrong time, wearing the wrong clothes and using</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the wrong shaving cream! BURMA SHAVE</span>".

>talk to coffee machine

 You clear your throat, and cough. "Ahem? Mr Coffee Machine? Are you
 all right?"

 "I feel terrible," the coffee machine groans. "My self-esteem is down
 the toilet. I'm tragically misunderstood. The whole world conspires
 against me."

 1) "Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Would it be okay if I had a cup of
 coffee?"
 2) "Oh, come one, it can't be that bad."

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Oh, come one, it can't be that bad."]</span>

 "Not that bad?" the coffee machine snorts bitterly. "Not <span class="floydstyle em">that</span>
 bad?!? God dang it, I've been working here for 65 years and I've never
 even been <span class="floydstyle em">promoted</span>! I don't even get my own office chair!
 That would be so little to ask for -- an office chair of my own, to
 sit on whenever I feel tired, a token of respect for all the coffee
 I've pumped out all those years! The Weiner Corporation would have
 NEVER been as successful as it is without MY coffee to keep their
 minds sharp and lively into the wee hours of the night!"

 1) "Ahem... talking about coffee... could I have some, please?"
 2) "Ahem... isn't there something you could do?"

>2

 <span class="floydstyle em">["Ahem... isn't there something you could do?"]</span>

 "Like, I don't know... have you tried talking to a psychiatrist?" you
 add, patting the coffee machine on the -- for lack of a better word --
 "shoulder".

 "Psychiatrist? I'm not mad, you idiot!" the machine retorts angrily.
 "This is it! I'm not going to put up with this sort of crap any more!
 I'm handing in my resignation! Right now, do you hear?"

 It hops out of the room and down the corridor at breakneck speed. Soon
 afterwards, to your dismay, you hear the sound of a heavy coffee
 machine falling down six flights of stairs in a record-breaking (and
 neck-breaking) 3.45 seconds.

 coffee, you selfish jerk!"

 For a second, it looks like the machine is going to hurl piping hot
 caffeine beverages at your face, but your fear prove to be unfounded,
 and sure enough you find yourself looking down at a cup of coffee as
 you hold it tentatively in one hand. The rooms falls silent once more,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storage Room</span>
 This room is filled with empty boxes, of the sort used for packaging.
 The only obvious exit is south.

 On the floor is a large cardboard tube with both ends sealed.

 Dangling from the ceiling is a long roll of sellotape.

>examine sellotape

 Someone clearly ran out of flypaper, and decided that it would be a
 smart idea to use the sellotape as a substitute. The roll of sellotape
 is only partially unrolled, however, and dangles from the ceiling like
 a peculiar pendulum of insect doom.

>swing sellotape

 There's nothing sensible to swing here.

>examine tube

 As you look closely, it wobbles a little to the left and then to the
 right again. There is definitely something in there... something
 alive.

>search tube

 You can't see inside, since the large cardboard tube is closed.

>open tube

 You open the large cardboard tube, revealing a weiner dog.

>listen to tube

 You hear nothing unexpected.

>examine dog

 It looks up placidly at you, and yawns, mumbling something
 unintelligible about coffee in the morning.

>Take tape? (or did we miss our chance because only the chair would let us reach it?)
 LET US REACH IT?)

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine dog

 It looks up placidly at you, and yawns, mumbling something
 unintelligible about coffee in the morning.

>take tube

 You are carrying:
   a large cardboard tube (open)

   a cup of coffee

>pet dog

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 The dog refuses. "Coffee," he mutters.

>talk to dog

 You have no idea what you would say to the weiner dog.

>take dog

 You pull the weiner dog out from the tube. This takes some time, and
 it is only by seizing it by the hind legs and swinging it around the
 room that the tube finally flies off, ricochetting off the wall in the
 process. The dog grumbles a bit, muttering about "Inhuman Resources"
 under its breath.

 The weiner dog allows you to pick it up, staring at you with
 drowsiness in its eyes.

 You put the weiner dog into the large cardboard tube.

 You close the large cardboard tube.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine elevator

 It's there for people who have temporarily forgotten how to use the
 stairs.

>go south

 As you enter the elevator, the doors close behind you, uttering a
 peculiar squeaking noise in the process. With a whirr, and without you
 having even had the time to fiddle around with the buttons, the
 elevator begins to descend -- into lunacy? Who knows.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lift</span>
 The elevator in which you are currently standing smells strongly of
 canine interference. A panel of buttons covers one wall.

 As if to attract your attention, the elevator whines like a dog whose
 nose has just been bopped over the nose with a newspaper.

>examine buttons

 Upon closer examination, someone has replaced all the buttons by tin
 tacks. This, among other things, means that you cannot mess around
 with it as much as you wanted to.

 The elevator screeches to a stop, and an electronic voice says
 breathlessly: "Time out! Be back in a jiffy!"

 After a moment or so, the elevator whirrs back to life, and business
 resumes.

>smell

 You smell nothing. Nothing, that is, other than the smell of your own
 fear.

 The elevator stops briefly, the doors opening for just the exact
 amount of time required for an enormous elephant to fit itself inside
 along with you.

>examine elephant

 You see nothing special about the enormous elephant.

 The elephant sneezes. The tension is palpable.

>talk to elephant

 You have no idea what you would say to the enormous elephant.

 The elevator stops again, and to your vast surprise another elephant
 steps inside, this time carrying a guitar and wearing a flower shirt!
 You try to make a dash for freedom, but alas the doors have already
 closed, and the elevator has resumed its descent.

>examine guitar

 You can't see any such thing.

>take tacks

 You can't see any such thing.

>squeak

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine elephant

 Who do you mean, the elephant hippy or the enormous elephant?

>examine hippy

 You see nothing special about the elephant hippy.

 It's now beginning to feel a little crowded in here. And the
 irritating little elves singing high-pitched renditions of "The
 Bohemian Rhapsody" are simply not helping.
>wait

 Time passes.

 The elevator stops. There is silence. And then... a third elephant,
 wearing a business suit and a fedora, crams itself inside. "Jeez," he
 says. "This sure is cramped, fellas."

>go north

 The doors are closed, and there doesn't appear to be any button
 allowing you to open them. What a nuisance. And the matter of that
 duck still remains unresolved. What a day. What... a... <span class="floydstyle em">day</span>.

 Oddly enough, you are finding it a little hard to breathe in here.

>go up

 You can't go that way.

 The elevator is almost at the lobby, and you pray to God that you make
 it there alive.

>examine elephant

 Who do you mean, the elephant businessman, the elephant hippy or the
 enormous elephant?

>examine businessman

 You see nothing special about the elephant businessman.

 Just when you thought this nightmare was over, the elevator abruptly
 stops at the first floor. You get a sinking feeling. Oh, no. Please.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 You watch the elevator doors open. Slooooowly....


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 And then....


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 ... a fourth elephant, wearing dark glasses and wielding a cane,
 calmly tries to fit itself into the elevator.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!

 Please press SPACE to continue.

 The elevator falls, carrying you and the four elephants down with it.
 The little annoying elves -- those responsible for the annoying
 elevator music -- all unaminously begin to do their own rendition of
 Fauré's <span class="floydstyle em">Requiem</span>.  Everyone inside the elevator goes crashing
 through the earth's molten core, screaming all the way.  Eventually,
 the elevators comes soaring out through a volcano in New Zealand, but
 by then you are all toast.

 A long wire comes into the room from the west, and you perceive that

 You notice that unplugging the electric wire is nothing short of

 lash out. The duck, not expecting this (he probably bought his
 light-saber on Ebay and has no actual Jedi training), is sent flying
 backwards. He crashes through the glass wall, and falls plummetting
 from six floors" worth of the ACME Corporation's newest skyscraper.

 This does not kill him, but after several months in hospital he is
 arrested for crimes against the Universe. Apparently, his name (his
 REAL name) is Moriarty Machiavelli the Third. It turns out he was your
 uncle, but that does not necessarily entail that you are a duck. At
 least, that is the way you choose to view things, and it's working out
 pretty well so far. Besides, one good thing has come out of this mess:
 you are no longer in the throes of ANATIDAEPHOBIA.

 "Me?" the duck replies quizzically. "Why, my name is Moriarty

 "I....am... your UNCLE!"

 1) Ask the duck for an explanation

 It's another nice, sunny day outside. The bird are singing, the
 flowers are beaming, and all is well.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 Well, that's what you assume, since in actual fact you're inside a
 brand new office on the sixth floor of the Weiner Corporation's newest
 skyscraper. At any rate, the job pays well, and your day usually
 passes by without any notable incidents to marr its pleasing monotony.


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 But something is different today. Cold sweat glistens on your brow.
 You know all too well what this means.

 Somewhere...somehow... a duck is watching you.

 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle i">Office</span> (on the office chair)
 One entire wall (the north one, as it happens) is nothing else but a
 great pane of glass, through which you can see the cityscape that lies
 outside. The office itself is sparsely furnished: it is equipped with
 merely a desk, a fax machine, a telephone and a cow. To the south is
 an open door.

 A long wire extends across the room, originating from the fax machine.

>examine fax machine

 It's a great, heavy monster of bureaucratic hell. With its aid, you
 could fax a dinosaur to Hawaii, that's telling you how sophisticated
 it is. It's powered by a very, very long electric wire which crosses
 the floor and disappears out into the corridor to the south. Oh, and
 it's also blatantly simple to use: all that is necessary is to put
 something in it, and then dial any number between 0 and 10. The fax
 machine has been customized specifically for faxing things to a very
 specific destination.

 You're sure of it. There's a duck watching you right now.

>examine dial

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a shirt (being worn)
   a tie (being worn)

 You wipe off a bead of sweat. Why did it have to be here? Why did it
 have to be now? Why? WHY?

>fax tie

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>put tie in fax

 (first taking it off)
 You put the tie into the fax machine.

 You loosen your tie with one hand, and glance around fearfully.

 There is a ZZZZZIP noise, and then it is done."<span class="floydstyle em">Item faxed to the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">ACME Clown Department,</span>" the electronic voice mumbles, sounding
 highly unamused.

 You have no choice. You have to find that duck, track it down, hound
 it, chase it to the ends of the earth if necessary. Thus is the price
 you must pay for peace of mind.

>enter fax

 That's not something you can enter.

 You can feel the duck's beady dark eyes boring into the back of your
 skull.

   a shirt (being worn)

 Though the duck is not in the room, still you feel its baleful glare,
 unwavering, unblinking.

 It's a pink telephone with yellow flowers painted on it. It's quite...

 be a good idea to call someone.

 In fact, there are plenty of people you could call. You have their
 numbers memorized by heart, as a matter of fact. You could contact...

 <span class="floydstyle em">[your aunt]</span>

 On second thought, you decide not to call your aunt. You remember all
 too well what happened last time she came to New Dork City. The
 authorities had to rescue her from the very top of the Umpire State
 Building (where she was doing a drunken imititation of King Kong).

 The response is immediate. <span class="floydstyle em">What pizza would you like, buddy?</span>

 "Give me," you say, suddenly sounding very determined, "the Mother of
 All Pizzas."

 <span class="floydstyle em">"With pepperoni on top?"</span>"With pepperoni on top."

 When you finally hang up a few minutes later, you rest safely in the
 knowledge that the most awesome pizza known to mankind is speeding on

 All this stress and paranoia proves far too much for you. With a
 wordless cry you throw yourself out the window!

 Actually, you do not throw yourself out of the window, you merely
 bounce off it with a muffled "PANG", and then stagger out into the
 corridor, nursing your blossoming bruise.

 The corridor heads off to the east and west, and you can always choose
 to re-enter your office to the north, via an open door upon which your

 Lurking in the corner of the room, looking rather disgruntled, is the
 coffee machine.

 A long wire comes into the room from the west, and you perceive that
 it is connected to a plug in the wall. Why anyone thought this was
 necessary is rather hard to divine.

>talk to machine

 You clear your throat, and cough. "Ahem? Mr Coffee Machine? Are you
 all right?"

 "I feel terrible," the coffee machine groans. "My self-esteem is down

 know exactly how to push my buttons, don't you?"

 With a sigh, it stares up at the ceiling and relapses into silence.

 Feeling somewhat guilty, you get yourself a cup of coffee, but when
 the moment comes to drink it you merely look down into its murky
 depths, seeing the coffee machine's discontent reflected from its
 swirling surface. So you stand there, holding it in your hand, your
 thoughts drifting back to the one thing which still remains

 It's a pink telephone with yellow flowers painted on it. It's quite...

 In fact, there are plenty of people you could call. You have their

 1) the police

 The vicious weiner dog snaps at the wire, slicing it in half. With an

 The ground rushes up to meet it, but its unpleasant designs are
 thwarted by the intervention of the wire which you had thoughtfully
 tied around your own waist. For a few seconds, you dangle inches from
 the ground, contemplating how close you were to disaster.

 Then, with a sigh of relief, you untie yourself and clamber down.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Now I'm coming for you, Mr. Duck,</span> you tell yourself
 determinedly as you enter the lobby of the ACME Corporation with a
 purposeful glint in the corner of your eye.

 The lobby stretches out before you, a beautiful pristine space with
 sliding doors awaiting you to the south, leading out into the busy
 street.

 You can enter the elevator here.

 Before you can enter the elevator, a security guard (who you could
 have sworn was not there a second ago) frisks you, relieving you of
 all your suspicious-looking personal items. A few seconds later, you
 are half-naked, standing only in your underwear. "You're good to go,"
 the guard grunts, and pushes you into the elevator most uncourteously.

 "Anatidaephobia. Such a long word for something so, <span class="floydstyle em">so</span> simple

>wait

 "Do you know what is really the matter with you, Pond?" the duck
 whispers, stepping closer. "It's your inability to face the facts."

>wait

 "Oh, and just to make matters clear, I will NOT shortly be revealing
 all the intimate details of my evil plan to dominate the universe to
 you, before then leaving you to die by a method so convoluted it is
 almost guaranteed to fail spectacularly. I know that this is something
 of a tradition for comic-book villains... and I have nothing against
 traditions... provided that they make sense. Ho, ho, ho."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Come on, Pond," the duck sighs. "This is riDUCKulous. You haven't
 done anything heroic so far. You haven't even said a single word to
 me. Are you truly braindead? Is it absolutely beyond your ability to
 come up with a good-guy oneliner? Even something as simple as
 "Yippee-kay-ayyy,  motherf***er" would suffice."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "This little game you're playing, Pond, is simply boring me to tears.
 I want... a battle to the DEATH!" And upon this last word, the duck
 whisks out a light-saber!

 With a barbarian yell, you lunge forward, ready for the Fight of the
 Century (TM).

 You squeeze the squid, but no ink comes out. Instead, a tiny little

 A whole amry of ninja gangsters then smashes through the window, and
 with consumate efficiency they rescue the tiny squid from your grasp.
 Then they knock you and the duck out flat unconscious.

 When you wake up, you find yourself on a desert island, along with the
 (very bewildered) duck. Apparently, this is the punishment reserved
 for people who mistreat members of the Octopi family.
