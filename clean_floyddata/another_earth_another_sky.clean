 ANOTHER EARTH, ANOTHER SKY

 [Please press a key to continue]








 It's been quite a week.

 Was it just two nights ago that you found the suits? You were
 searching through your parents' lab as usual, desperate for clues to
 explain their recent disappearance, when you found a latch on one of
 the machines. It opened, revealing two bodysuits crammed inside. One
 fit you perfectly. The other seemed to be made for your sister Emily.
 Hers, the "skysuit", gives her the power to fly, to generate thick
 fog, and to fire blasts of intense electrical energy, while your
 "earthsuit" has granted you the strength of a giant, and the
 invulnerability of a mountain.

 The powers came in handy the next morning, when your parents' best
 friend, Dr. Nina Icolari, found herself transformed into a raging,
 hundred-foot-tall monster. Aunt Nina had been working with some
 ancient bacteria, trapped for eons in a salt crystal, when an untimely
 earthquake shattered the crystal. She inhaled the microbes, became a
 behemoth, and only the power of your suits and your brains saved the
 campus from destruction.

 You employed a fast-acting antibiotic to reverse the transformation,
 and when she changed back, Aunt Nina realized that her memories of
 your parents' disappearance had been mysteriously altered... and that
 the trauma of metamorphosis had somehow restored them. Those memories
 have led you here, to a remote cabin in the Sierra Nevadas. Here, you
 hope that where the police have failed, Earth and Sky may succeed.

 Outside the Cabin
 The air is vivid and cold here, deep in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
 Evergreens surround you, except to the north, where a gravel driveway
 leads back to the main road, and to the south, where a small cabin
 occupies a clearing. Beyond the cabin, and above it, the observatory's
 domed roof casts a long, round shadow.

 Emily is here, having just hiked up the driveway with you. "Thanks for
 driving us up here, Austin," she says. "Remember, though: I get
 control of the CD player on the way back down!"

 Administration was faced with a choice. They could either sell off the
 land and put the money into the general fund, or they could try to
 find some use for it. Enter Dr. Thaddeus Andrews, who offered to use
 his own inheritance to build an observatory on the land, and to
 christen it the High Sierra Research Station. Indeed, that's what the
 sign on this humble little cabin reads. The cabin's door is closed.

 Emily follows you.

 Main Room
 Some people might describe the interior of this cabin as "cozy", but
 you're more inclined to face facts and call it what it is: cramped.
 Furnishings are minimal: a table, a few chairs, a hotplate, and a
 television that probably hasn't worked since the mid-1980s. The back
 door is south and the front door north, and two doors on the eastern
 wall lead northeast and southeast, to the bedroom and bathroom
 respectively.

 Emily stands here, looking around.

 On the table are some loose papers.

 Emily takes a quick glance at the papers on the table, and exhales.

 "Listen, Austin," she says, "I find all these diagrams and
 observatories and whatnot a bit exhausting, so I'd like for you to
 take the lead for a while, if that's OK. Let me know if there's
 anything specific you'd like me to do -- otherwise I'm just going to
 follow you around and offer my help if I think of anything that seems
 significant."

 Please select a reply:

 1) "No problem."
 2) "Don't sell yourself short. Just because you're not a scientist
 doesn't mean you can't comprehend this stuff."
 3) "Oh sure. When it comes to flying around and fighting monsters,
 you're all over it, but things like diagrams just tucker you out."

 She laughs. "Well, I could probably do diagram-reading and then
 monster-fighting, but for some strange reason I find the other way
 round just a wee bit more taxing."

 father's handwriting and his extremely minimalist notation style on
 them. Most of them contain diagrams and equations that look quite
 similar to those you found with the suits, but there is one paper that
 seems to have notes on an unrelated topic:

 Bedroom
 Dusty, golden light seeps in through the closed curtains, further
 highlighting the various earth tones that adorn this sparse room. The
 wallpaper is brownish-orange, the nightstand is dark oak, the
 bedspread burnt sienna, and so on. The cabin's main room is west.

 "Wow," says Emily. "Somebody hasn't redecorated since the 1970s."

 Emily is alongside you, resplendent in blue and white.

 The nightstand has a drawer, which is closed.

 splinters into pieces. A notepad and a legal pad appear to be lying
 amid the debris.

 "If I ever open an antique store," says Emily, "you aren't allowed

>examine notepad
 surmise that this notepad must belong to Dr. Andrews. Amid pages of
 detail about the orbital periods of various planets, telescope
 azimuths and elevations, spectroscope readings, and suchlike, you find
 a crude drawing of an apparently artificial sphere, with a
 cross-section showing an inner circle connected to its outer shell by
 two long columns.

 Beneath these pictures is a swarm of equations, some of which appear
 to be calculations of density, gravitational pull, and surface
 temperature. The temperature equations in particular are interesting,
 as it appears that Dr. Andrews was either unable to come up with a
 solution, or unable to settle on one of many.

 with his cryptic notations, and indeed, this one bears his signature
 style. The notes are for a process that looks utterly unfamiliar to
 you. The most you can piece together is that it takes the
 dumbbell-shaped wave function of an electron at a particular energy
 state and splits it into two bubbles (though how a wave function can
 even be treated as a physical entity, let alone split, is left
 unexplained), allowing "half-electrons" to jump instantaneously from
 one bubble to the next along some extra-dimensional quantum pathway.
 Dad's laconic note-taking style doesn't make clear whether this is
 just a thought experiment, but knowing him, he's probably found some
 physical use for it.

 Behind The Cabin
 The view from behind the cabin is spectacular. The research station
 isn't situated in the highest part of the mountain range -- it isn't
 even above timberline -- but it's high enough to afford an expansive
 panorama of the valley below. The observatory is a little further up
 the incline to the south, and the cabin stands to the north, its back
 door open.

 Emily is nearby, waiting for you to do something interesting.

>emily, fly
 cries. "It's just beautiful up here!" After a few more aerial fillips,
 she returns to earth. "I didn't see anything alarming, but it is a
 heckuva view."

>ask emily about roof

>go south

 Observatory Entrance
 A rocky path ends here, just north of the door to the concrete,
 rectangular portion of the observatory. Unlike the small observatory
 on the main campus, this one makes no particular concessions to
 aesthetics, and its door wouldn't be out of place on a bank vault. The
 path leads back down and north to the cabin.

 Emily is nearby, waiting for you to do something interesting.

 exaggerated windup, and as her hand comes forward for the pitch,
 brilliant blue electricity crackles between her fingertips and the
 steel door. An explosive KER-POW splits the air, and the steel door is
 left standing, scorched but unmoved.

 "Well, that was anticlimactic," she says.

>lift observatory

>pull door
 door strains, then buckles, and the handle comes partway detached. But
 by then you can grip the door itself, and a mighty heave pulls it the
 rest of the way free, tearing it right off its hinges.

 You've already rendered the door useless. Let it go.

 Inside the Observatory
 The observatory is astonishing. It's not the desk, or the computer, or
 the other laboratory accoutrements that make it so, but rather the
 staggeringly complex mass of ornate machinery that smothers every
 wall. Tubes, readouts, and gleaming metal plates swarm together in a
 lunatic collage, every lever and dial shouting your parents' design
 influence as surely as if they had autographed their work. You've
 known these sights all your life, but their presence here is a shock
 -- clearly, Mom and Dad were collaborating far more closely with Dr.
 Andrews than they ever revealed. The newly opened entranceway leads
 back north, and a doorway leads east to the telescope dome.

 Emily leans against the wall here.

 In front of the dome doorway, seemingly generated by the room's
 prodigious gadgetry, is a curious projection: a curtain of light,
 within which coruscate ever-shifting patterns and colors. The curtain
 covers the doorway completely -- there doesn't seem to be any way to
 cross the threshold into the dome without first crossing the
 flickering barrier.

>jump

>examine projection

 Symmetrical fluorescent squiggles travel from the edges to the center,

 force pull sharply on your fingers, drawing you further into the

 curtain, with a clammy suspicion that it was only the power of the
 earthsuit that allowed you to break free of that inexorable pull.

 opinion, I think we should go through together. It might take all the
 power both of us can muster to face whatever's across that barrier."
 2) "I can't make that decision for you, Em. If it were my call, I'd
 say you should stay here. No sense both of us taking such a huge risk,
 and maybe if I don't come back, you can go ahead and get the Army or
 whatever, and send the cavalry my way."

 way. But I'm walking through that curtain, and whether or not you
 follow me is up to you."

 Emily sets her jaw. "Then I'm coming with you. We may need all the
 power that both of us possess to face whatever's on the other side of
 that curtain."

 "Watch," you say. "We'll walk right through and nothing will happen at
 all."

 "That would be great," she replies grimly, "but somehow I doubt it."

 Sleepily, you open your eyes. What's that pinkish glow? Sunrise? Did
 you leave the bedroom window open? Wait, this isn't your bedroom.
 Where...?

 Wait -- the curtain! You stepped through with Emily, and that's the
 last thing you remember before awakening on this... floor. And Emily
 -- she's gone!


 Cell
 You find yourself in a small, square room, perhaps eight feet on a
 side. The ceiling is high, maybe fifteen feet above your head, but
 what's even stranger is that it and all the walls are glowing with a
 bright pink energy field.

 You can see a cabin key here.

 vault upward, then plummet down again. This time, when your feet slam
 into the polymer, there is a deafening KA-THUNKK! as the floor splits,
 and you find yourself falling.

 And falling. Air buffets your face and whistles past your ears, as you
 try to take in the situation. You appear to be falling to Earth, from
 a great height, as if you had just jumped out of a plane, sans
 parachute. The ground below you, though... there's something strange
 about it. You can see its curvature, as if you were much farther away
 from the planet than you seem to be. Or as if the planet itself had
 shrunk.

 As the ground comes closer, you can see that the planet itself seems
 demarcated into clearly defined zones -- a bluish-white Arctic, a
 sandy desert, a blue-green ocean, and others -- all tidily encased in
 separate regions of the globe. Even stranger, you're catching glimpses
 of a huge metal cylinder that rises up from the ground and far into
 the sky above you. This isn't Earth you're falling towards. Either
 that, or Earth has changed a lot since the last time you were above
 it. Gravity feels about the same, though -- the ground is still
 rushing towards you at alarming speed. Actually, you're rushing
 towards it. Funny, how many thoughts can pass through your brain in a
 situation like this. The suit is supposed to make you invulnerable to
 impact, but will it really protect you from this kind of fall? Guess
 you're about to find--

 Arctic (in the ice hole)
 You remember the ground, blinding white, reaching up to clobber you.
 Then blackness. Then cold. Serious cold. As you gather your senses
 back to you, several things become clear. One, you're not dead -- in
 fact, not even hurt, though a little dazed. Two, you've landed in a
 cold place. And three, your landing has created a deep pit with icy
 walls, and you're at the bottom of it.

>go up
 expected. Landing softly in the snow, you estimate that gravity must
 be around 0.8G on this planetoid.

 Arctic
 Icy monoliths, ridged with frozen rivulets, rise up around you. Your
 suit's insulation feels distressingly meager in the freezing, stinging
 wind, and the light glistens white as the snow reflects the distant
 sun. For all you know, you're at the pole of this little world, so
 compass directions don't mean much, but you invent some just to keep
 your bearings. The faraway blue-green smudge is north, the faraway tan
 smudge south. Your views east and west are blocked by huge, rugged
 breccia hills.

 A deep crater is here, which is what happens when an immovable object
 like this glacier meets an irresistible force like a plummeting
 superhero.

 Beside the crater, a long metal tube reaches into the sky. The bottom
 of the tube has been entirely dislodged from its base, no doubt
 wrecked by your recent impact.

 That impact also appears to have exposed some sort of access panel.

>examine tube
 it -- if you could figure out how to enter it, that is. As your eyes
 follow it upward, you can see that it terminates alongside a glowing,
 pink hole in the sky. Its other end, at your feet, has been wrenched
 free from the ground, exposing a base rife with wrecked machinery.

>examine access panel
 dusting of snow, leading you to conclude that your cataclysmic
 entrance probably removed the panel's cover. Its only control is a
 square touchplate, colored indigo and emblazoned with an
 upwards-pointing triangle.

>push touchplate
 lay your whole hand on it, it lights up briefly, and you hear a series
 of whines and clicks from the cylinder's base.

>examine base
 some of it obviously crushed or torn by its forced separation from the
 tube proper.

 In the distance, you can see a rookery of penguins waddling blissfully
 around the ice. Or, wait. Are they penguins? They appear to be
 throwing snowballs at each other. Penguins can't throw, can they?
 Taking a closer look, you fancy that their heads are larger than those
 of normal penguins, and that you can make out gripping fingers at the
 edge of their wings.

>examine penguins
 normal penguins, with the notable exceptions of the outsized heads and
 the wing-fingers.

 Arctic
 Icy monoliths, ridged with frozen rivulets, rise up around you. Your
 suit's insulation feels distressingly meager in the freezing, stinging
 wind, and the light glistens white as the snow reflects the distant
 sun. For all you know, you're at the pole of this little world, so
 compass directions don't mean much, but you invent some just to keep
 your bearings. The faraway blue-green smudge is north, the faraway tan
 smudge south. Your views east and west are blocked by huge, rugged
 breccia hills.

 A deep crater is here, which is what happens when an immovable object
 like this glacier meets an irresistible force like a plummeting
 superhero.

 Beside the crater, a long metal tube reaches into the sky. The bottom
 of the tube has been entirely dislodged from its base, no doubt
 wrecked by your recent impact.

 That impact also appears to have exposed some sort of access panel.

 upwards. The ground drops away beneath you -- gravity is definitely
 less than 1G on this planetoid, though your mind boggles to think how
 dense the core must be in order to even come close. Your thoughts
 return to the present as the border of the arctic area approaches --
 the demarcation between it and the adjoining areas is distinct and
 sharp. Incredibly, you've traveled almost 45 degrees across the sphere
 already, and your trajectory will take you another 45, to the side of
 the sphere, before you land. Always assuming, of course, that the
 borders are permeable.

 As the border passes beneath you, a momentary nausea sweeps over you,
 gone as soon as you enter the next area.

 You've reached the arc of your parabola, and have begun to descend. An
 ocean sloshes below you, uncluttered by islands or land masses. As the
 water approaches, you suddenly realize that some of the things you're
 carrying will be ruined if they get wet. Frantically running your
 hands along your costume searching for a pouch, your finger slides
 over a line that splits into an opening. Thinking quickly, you stuff
 the items inside, and run your finger along the line to close it
 again. Just in time, too, because you hit the water with a massive
 SPLOOSH!

 Once your head is submerged, a plastic sheath emerges from the sides
 of your cowl, covering your nose and mouth. You take a hesitant
 breath, and realize that the suit must be filtering oxygen from the
 water. Mom and Dad sure planned ahead when they made this thing!
 Unfortunately, they apparently weren't able to make it very
 lightweight, and you quickly sink to the ocean floor.

 Ocean
 You're standing on silty ground, deep underwater. The light is dim,
 but you can still see well enough, thanks to bioluminescence from
 plants that make their home here. Judging from the time you spent
 sinking, your rough estimate is that you're about two thousand feet
 below the surface. Happily, the suit seems equipped to handle such
 extreme pressures, and although you feel like you're moving in slow
 motion, you're experiencing no discomfort.

 A large circular door, apparently a hatch, is set in the ground here.

 Just alongside the hatch is a large, mirrored half-bubble, like a
 glassy eye in the sand.

 You also notice a beige touchplate embedded in rock about ten yards
 away from the hatch.

 effortless at first, then stuttering and jerking violently. The
 surface of the bubble wavers, and for a moment your blood freezes with
 the thought that it will dissolve before finishing the journey.
 Finally and suddenly, the bubble dumps you on sandy ground just before
 dissolving around you.

 Sandy Dome
 You're in a dome, probably about ten feet high at its zenith and
 twenty feet in diameter at its base. The wall is transparent, but
 that's not too useful, since the entire dome appears to be buried in
 sand. There are several platforms on the ground, reaching to your hip
 and covered with a soft bedding on top, and to one side of these is a
 pedestal with a crimson touchplate. You can see no exits.

 On one side of the dome, a large pile of sand covers the floor,
 drifting to its highest point at a junction of dome wall and floor.

 You feel it give, just a little, and you redouble your efforts,
 shaking with the strain. Sand flows between your feet as the dome edge
 inches ever higher, and finally, with a mighty CREEEAK!, the rest of
 the seal gives way, and a tsunami of sand smacks you in the face.
 Spluttering and coughing, you dig yourself out of the dune, and pull
 the dome the rest of the way free. The pedestal and platforms are
 buried -- all that's left of the dome is its shell, upended into the
 big bowl beside you.

 Desert
 The first thing you notice is the heat. It is punishing, astonishing,
 like standing inside an inferno that burns without flames. Your suit
 insulates you somewhat, and a lucky thing, too, because otherwise you
 wouldn't last long under a sun that feels like it's just a few feet
 away. It's hard to tell which direction is which, since you emerged
 from the dome rather than landing here -- you'll need to invent some
 directions based on gut instinct and hope they work out. So let's say
 that the cool, distant greenness is east, and the gentler, golden hue
 is west. Sand dunes block your view north and south.

 A large, Y-shaped cactus stands nearby.

>jump east

 The familiar flash-nausea passes as you cross the barrier.

 From the zenith of your jump, it looks like a lush, green carpet is
 spread below you, but as you fall, the landscape soon resolves itself
 into treetops, with occasional glimpses of tall, thick trunks below
 the canopy, and one clearly artificial tower that is even taller than
 the surrounding forest. By now, you've gotten the hang of steering
 your descent a little, so you aim towards that tower, crashing through
 the branches and landing solidly at its base.

 Forest
 The air is cool and quiet down here, far beneath the treetop canopy.
 On every side of you, massive trunks rise majestically. These trees
 are enormous, like old-growth redwoods but growing higher than Earth
 gravity would ever permit. The trees completely block the horizon, and
 you feel quite disoriented as to where the compass directions are.

 Beside you is the base of a tower that's even taller than the trees.

 You've reached the arc of your parabola, and have begun to descend. An
 ocean sloshes below you, uncluttered by islands or land masses. As you
 fly through the air, you tuck your non-waterproof possessions into the
 suit pouch. Soon, you hit the water with a massive SPLOOSH!

 As you sink, the suit begins supplying oxygen to you.

 you press it with your whole hand, it lights up briefly, and once
 again, nothing happens. At least, nothing happens at first, but in a
 moment, you hear a rumbling, and suddenly the bit of ocean floor
 you're standing on begins to rise! Soon, you find yourself shooting
 upward on a small plot of land, spearing through tons of water that
 would surely crush you if not for the earthsuit.

 You break the surface with a terrific SPLOOSH! And then it's over. You
 find yourself standing on a small island as water sluices off its
 surface and back into the ocean. By all rights, you should have a
 serious case of the bends after such a rapid ascent from deep
 underwater, but you feel fine -- the earthsuit must somehow have
 fooled your body into thinking it was still at one atmosphere of
 pressure, thus preventing nitrogen absorption. The plastic sheath over
 your nose and mouth retreats back into the cowl.

 Island
 In the funnies, all deserted islands are barely large enough to fit
 two people, and always have a palm tree in the middle. This island is
 just like that, except without the palm tree.

 Now that you're at the surface again, you try to orient yourself. The
 whitish smudge in the distance must be the Arctic area, so let's call
 that north. That would make the Forest west, the beige smudge east,
 and the bright green smudge south.

 Now that you're dry again, you unzip the suit pouch and retrieve your

 The familiar flash-nausea passes as you cross the barrier.

 Your landing spot is entirely obscured by thick, grey clouds, pierced
 by a long, metal tube that reaches far into the sky. You fall into the
 clouds, soaked in rain, thinking of Emily -- please, let her be okay.
 Suddenly a thick, broad leaf strikes you across the face, and you're
 crashing through slick, wet vegetation. One bouncing, awkward, and
 destructive fall later, you pick yourself up from damp ground, brush
 the mud off your costume, and look around.

 Rainforest
 You stand amidst a symphony of green. Deep jade moss covers the trunks
 of trees, whose leaves far above filter mottled avocado light over
 emerald bushes and green grass -- adjectives run out long before the
 shades of green do. The air is warm, muggy, and filled with the sounds
 of wildlife.

 Beside you is the bottom of a long steel tube that rises into the sky
 and past the clouds.

 One small square at your feet appears free of moss, or at least it
 might, if you could see past the swarming mass of slugs that infest
 it.

 A closed metal canister sits next to the slug-infested square.

 In a rare patch of foliage-free ground near you, the mirrored surface
 of a dome reflects the surrounding greenery.

>examine canister

 You hear voices in conversation above you -- no language you've ever
 heard, but clearly a dialogue -- and look up to see two parrots on a
 nearby branch, vocalizing to each other with occasional glances at
 you. Their tones make you feel like you've just crashed a very
 exclusive party, and are terribly underdressed to boot.

>listen to parrots

 but that's what they most resemble, with perhaps somewhat larger

>ask parrots about emily

 you'll need to decide on some arbitrary directions, preferably ones

 yourself straight upward, punching through the rainclouds and hanging
 for a moment in the sunshine above them. Quickly, you look around: the
 sand dunes of the Desert area are visible from here, so that would be
 north. You fall back through the clouds and trees, with an improved
 sense of direction.

 The familiar flash-nausea passes as you cross the barrier.

 You're descending towards a broad savannah, sparsely dotted with tall
 trees. For a second, you think you spot movement, the grasses parting
 and dark shapes darting away over the gentle hills, but once you land
 and look around, everything seems perfectly still.

 Veldt
 Tall grasses of faded gold reach past your knees, swaying; here and
 there, baobab trees pose elegantly against a brilliant blue sky. Soft
 hills ripple through this prairie, and the hot, thick air buzzes with
 the sounds of distant insects. You can see blue-whiteness in one
 direction -- the Arctic area -- so that's north, and the Rainforest
 area is south. Far on the eastern horizon is the tan haze of the
 Desert area, and the blue-green Ocean shimmers in the distant west.

 Beside you is a dome, its mirrored surface reflecting the sun.

 Something tickles your peripheral vision, and you turn. A feline face
 is peeking over one of the ridges, and its eyes lock with yours for a
 moment. Then it disappears, leaving the tall grass rocking behind it.
 The moment passed quickly, but you did notice that the head was more
 oval than triangular, and that the space between the eyes and ears was
 enough to contain a brainpan larger than that of any earth cat. In
 fact, the size of the head seemed to imply a rather large creature
 overall.

 You stealthily approach the ridge and look over. About a hundred yards
 away, there are perhaps a half-dozen cat-creatures, feline bodies
 covered with fur but walking upright on their hind legs, and with
 articulated gripping fingers on their front paws, from which you can
 see claws occasionally extending. They are indeed large, probably
 about eight feet tall and impressively muscled. The cat-people notice
 you immediately, and retreat to a safe distance, but from there regard
 you with equal curiosity.

 tentacles and two even longer feeding arms trail from its maroon,

 Forest Dome
 You're in a dome, probably about ten feet high at its zenith and
 twenty feet in diameter at its base. The wall is transparent, and
 through it you can see that you're about twenty yards above the
 treetops of a magnificent forest. There are several platforms on the
 ground, reaching to your hip and covered with a soft bedding on top,
 and to one side of these is a pedestal with a crimson touchplate. You
 can see no exits.

 In the center of the dome, an odd device rests atop an eight-foot
 pole.

 large lens on one end and a face-shaped indentation on the other,
 you're inclined to believe it's somehow intended for long-distance
 viewing -- a "viewscope", you decide provisionally. Sadly, it's at the

 indentation doesn't appear to be shaped to accommodate a human face,

 Australopithecus.

 Waterlock
 The walls are close and smooth in this utterly nondescript,
 cylindrical room. The only noteworthy feature is that a couple of
 touchplates adorn one wall, one crimson and one turquoise. There's
 also an exit to, oh let's call it the east.

>push turquoise
 water. With the water rising rapidly, you tuck your non-waterproof
 possessions into the suit pouch so that they won't be damaged. As
 before, your suit starts processing the water through its gills, and
 then the hatch opens, releasing the last of the air.

>go up
 Ocean
 You're standing on silty ground, deep underwater. The light is dim,
 but you can still see well enough, thanks to bioluminescence from
 plants that make their home here. Judging from the time you spent
 sinking, your rough estimate is that you're about two thousand feet
 below the surface. Happily, the suit seems equipped to handle such
 extreme pressures, and although you feel like you're moving in slow
 motion, you're experiencing no discomfort.

 An incredible giant squid floats alongside you, just out of reach.

 A large, open hatch leads downward.

 Just alongside the hatch is a large, mirrored half-bubble, like a
 glassy eye in the sand.

 You also notice a beige touchplate next to a towering silver cylinder
 about ten yards away from the hatch.

>go up
 it's no good. By the time you reach the surface, the water resistance
 has drained your jump of its inertia, leaving you to sink back down to
 the ocean floor.

 you press it with your whole hand, it lights up briefly, and once

 moment, you hear a rumbling, and suddenly the bit of ocean floor
 you're standing on begins to rise! Soon, you find yourself shooting
 upward on a small plot of land, spearing through tons of water that
 would surely crush you if not for the earthsuit.

 You break the surface with a terrific SPLOOSH! And then it's over. You
 find yourself standing on a small island as water sluices off its
 surface and back into the ocean. By all rights, you should have a
 serious case of the bends after such a rapid ascent from deep
 underwater, but you feel fine -- the earthsuit must somehow have
 fooled your body into thinking it was still at one atmosphere of
 pressure, thus preventing nitrogen absorption. The plastic sheath over
 your nose and mouth retreats back into the cowl.

 Island
 In the funnies, all deserted islands are barely large enough to fit
 two people, and always have a palm tree in the middle. This island is
 just like that, except without the palm tree. Orienting yourself by
 the distant smudges, you decide that the Forest is west, the Veldt
 area is east, and the Rainforest is south.

 Now that you're dry again, you unzip the suit pouch and retrieve your
 delicate items.

>jump west
 crouch and launch yourself upwards, and that seems to provide
 sufficient momentum.

 The familiar flash-nausea passes as you cross the barrier.

 Once again, you hurtle through the canopy of leaves and land more or
 less at your previous arrival point.

 Forest
 The air is cool and quiet down here, far beneath the treetop canopy.
 On every side of you, massive trunks rise majestically. These trees
 are enormous, like old-growth redwoods but growing higher than Earth
 gravity would ever permit. The trees completely block the horizon, and
 you can only keep yourself oriented by remembering the direction you
 were facing when you jumped up and saw the Arctic area.

 Beside you is the base of a tower that's even taller than the trees.

>jump west

 The familiar flash-nausea passes as you cross the barrier.

 Once again, you land in the sandy, sweltering desert.

 Desert
 The first thing you notice is the heat. It is punishing, astonishing,
 like standing inside an inferno that burns without flames. Your suit
 insulates you somewhat, and a lucky thing, too, because otherwise you
 wouldn't last long under a sun that feels like it's just a few feet
 away. Orienting yourself based on the direction you came from, you can
 see enormous sand dunes rising north and south of you, creating no
 shade but blocking your vision. Through the heat haze, you can barely
 perceive the Forest to the east, and the Veldt to the west.

 A large, Y-shaped cactus stands nearby.

 You can also see an enormous bowl (which is empty) here.

 its attention to you.

 As soon as the cylinder starts playing, the head of every cat-creature
 turns to look at it, pupils dilated and ears rotated forward. As soon
 as it finishes, their fur is raised, and they let out hissing chorus.
 Then they are in motion, streaking across the grassland and away from

 This time, you're a little more ready for the rainclouds and

 Rainforest
 You stand amidst a symphony of green. Deep jade moss covers the trunks
 of trees, whose leaves far above filter mottled avocado light over
 emerald bushes and green grass -- adjectives run out long before the
 shades of green do. The air is warm, muggy, and filled with the sounds
 of wildlife.

 Beside you is the bottom of a long steel tube that rises into the sky
 and past the clouds.

 One small square at your feet appears free of moss, or at least it
 might, if you could see past the swarming mass of slugs that infest
 it.

 In a rare patch of foliage-free ground near you, the mirrored surface

 would surely crush you if not for the earthsuit.

 You break the surface with a terrific SPLOOSH! And then it's over. You
 find yourself standing on a small island as water sluices off its
 surface and back into the ocean. By all rights, you should have a
 serious case of the bends after such a rapid ascent from deep
 underwater, but you feel fine -- the earthsuit must somehow have
 fooled your body into thinking it was still at one atmosphere of
 pressure, thus preventing nitrogen absorption. The plastic sheath over
 your nose and mouth retreats back into the cowl.

 Island
 In the funnies, all deserted islands are barely large enough to fit
 two people, and always have a palm tree in the middle. This island is
 just like that, except without the palm tree. Orienting yourself by
 the distant smudges, you decide that the Forest is west, the Veldt
 area is east, and the Rainforest is south.

 Now that you're dry again, you unzip the suit pouch and retrieve your
 delicate items.

>jump south
 crouch and launch yourself upwards, and that seems to provide
 sufficient momentum.

 The familiar flash-nausea passes as you cross the barrier.

 This time, you're a little more ready for the rainclouds and
 vegetation, but that doesn't stop your fall from being a careening,
 wet one.

 Rainforest
 You stand amidst a symphony of green. Deep jade moss covers the trunks
 of trees, whose leaves far above filter mottled avocado light over
 emerald bushes and green grass -- adjectives run out long before the
 shades of green do. The air is warm, muggy, and filled with the sounds
 of wildlife.

 Beside you is the bottom of a long steel tube that rises into the sky
 and past the clouds.

 The newly slug-free access panel winks up at you from the ground.

 In a rare patch of foliage-free ground near you, the mirrored surface
 of a dome reflects the surrounding greenery.

 The parrots jabber some more, and you could swear you just heard one
 of them snicker.

>put sponge on panel

>enter tube

>examine tube
 one salient difference: it hasn't been wrecked by a massive impact. It
 looks easily wide enough to fit yourself into -- if you can figure out
 how to enter it, that is.

>touch tube
 you probably wouldn't feel anything unexpected anyway.

>touch panel
 you probably wouldn't feel anything unexpected anyway.

>push panel
 a ten-foot tall section slides open, revealing a clean, lighted
 interior.

>enter tube
 stomach lurches and your feet leave the ground -- this isn't an
 elevator whose floor lifts you to your destination, it's some sort of
 levitation device. What's more, although it's opaque from the outside,
 from in here the tube is perfectly transparent, so you see yourself
 punching through the clouds of the rainforest and hurtling upward at
 an alarming rate. Just as it's crossing your mind to be grateful that
 Emily got the flying power instead of you, the barrier of the sky
 passes, and the tube expels you into new surroundings.

 Corridor
 The walls of this corridor reflect your image back at you, mazed with
 the outlines of machinery built into their surfaces. After the tube
 ride, your sense of direction is confounded once again, so you posit
 that the tube entrance is west, the corridor continues east, and the
 large door is to your south. There is also a pink touchplate next to
 the door.


>examine pink

 outline in the wall makes its function plain. It is currently closed,
 and pink light seeps around its edges.

>go south
 Cell
 This cell is exactly identical to the one that imprisoned you, with
 three critical differences. First, there's no pink energy field -- the
 walls are simply bare. Second, there's an open doorway in the north
 wall. And finally, there's no giant, gaping hole in the floor.

 Your sister is here, sitting in a corner and looking dejectedly at the
 floor.

 Emily scrambles to her feet. "Austin!" she shouts. "Woo hoo! Boy, am I
 glad to see you!" She rushes over and hugs you.

 Please select a reply:

 1) "Likewise! So have you been in here ever since stepping through the
 curtain?"
 2) "Well, considering you'd probably be trapped in there forever if
 not for me, I'm not surprised at the warm reception."
 3) "Thanks. You have no idea what I had to go through to get here."

>1

 "Pretty much," she replies. "What happened to you?"

 Please select a reply:

 1) "Well, actually, it was quite interesting. I was in a cell just
 like this one..."
 2) "Oh, you know... stuff."
 3) "I'll tell you the whole story, but not right now."

>3

 "Now there's a plan I can support. Let's get to work."

>go north

 Corridor
 The walls of this corridor reflect your image back at you, mazed with
 the outlines of machinery built into their surfaces. After the tube
 ride, your sense of direction is confounded once again, so you posit
 that the tube entrance is west, the corridor continues east, and the
 large door is to your south. There is also a pink touchplate next to
 the door.

 Emily stands a few feet away from you, looking bored.

 Corridor
 This section of corridor shows the signs of a recent battle. Scorch
 marks mar the gleaming machinery, and the grey carpet is distressed by
 bloodstains and rips. The hallway continues east to an intersection
 and west to the tube entrance.

 Emily is nearby, waiting for you to do something interesting.

>examine marks
 but somewhat the worse for wear, assailed by dents and scorch marks.

>examine machinery
 but somewhat the worse for wear, assailed by dents and scorch marks.

>go east
 throughout the halls, bright lights flash, and polymer walls slam down
 on either side of you, leaving only small niches to the north and
 south. Matters deteriorate quickly from bad to worse as a portal opens
 in the corridor east of here, releasing a stream of broad, tall
 security robots that cut off the corridor completely. The robots see
 you, and are advancing menacingly towards you!

 Emily follows you.

 Intersection
 This intersection appears to have borne the brunt of the earlier
 fighting, with its walls dented, its carpet decimated, and even its
 ceiling showing a mark or two. Moments ago, passageways led north and
 south here, but they have just been closed off by impenetrable polymer
 walls, leaving just a small niche on either side of the corridor,
 which continues east and west.

 Emily hovers a few feet above the ground here.

 A piercing alarm shrieks through the hallways, accompanied by bright,
 flashing lights.

 Security robots are advancing on you from the east in an imposing
 column.

>emily, zap robots
 from her fingers with a shattering KER-POW, frying the circuits of the
 robotic regiment and scattering them like bowling pins. As more robots
 emerge from the portal, you jump in to do your part, sending sentinels
 flying with the SKRANG  of your fists and feet colliding with their
 more frangible bodies. Finally, the two of you have cut a wide swath
 through the mechanical guardians, and find yourself east of the
 intersection, fried and smashed robots littering the ground at your
 feet.

 Corridor
 The hallway dead-ends here at the portal that released the robots. It
 has since closed, and its robots litter the ground, soundly defeated
 by you and your sister. A doorway leads north, and the intersection is
 west.

 A piercing alarm shrieks through the hallways, accompanied by bright,
 flashing lights.

 Emily stands a few feet away from you, looking smug.

 "Woo hoo! Yeah!" shouts Emily, and pumps her fist several times for
 good measure.

>go north

 Observation Center
 This room appears to serve several purposes, at least one of which is
 to be an observation center for the various environments below. You
 draw this conclusion from the six large panels arranged along the
 north wall, four of which display rotating views of the Ocean, Veldt,
 Forest, and Rainforest environments, while the other two are blank. On
 the western wall, a transporter curtain shimmers through its endless
 pattern changes, and to the east, a lavish arrangement of cushions
 suggests sleeping quarters of some sort. Control panels of various
 sorts dot the walls, and the only exit is to the south.

 Emily is nearby, waiting for you to do something decisive.

 You can also see a giant, catlike alien here.

 As you enter, the huge, humanoid cat-creature stabs a button, and the
 alarm falls into sudden, tense silence. The creature glowers at you,
 oval-slitted eyes burning with a combination of fury, frustration, and
 fear. Its toothy mouth gapes, and a stream of angry, hissing syllables
 flows forth: "mr mrrowuoiiaow ssao aow urr mrr iaow&lt;throat-clearing
 fffteeaouw !"

 Seeing the look of incomprehension on your face, it stalks over to the
 other side of the room and twists a dial. When it speaks again, a
 hidden speaker broadcasts an English translation over its words.

 "You stupid, clumsy, vomit-brained, simian cub!" it resumes, "You did
 this, didn't you?" It gestures angrily at one of the blank screens.
 "You wrecked my Arctic equipment, and tramped your filthy body through
 every other environment! You've destroyed my work!"

 Please select a reply:

 1) "Uh, well... You don't... I mean... That is..."
 2) "Hey, back off Sylvester! All I did was escape from a prison cell!
 What was I supposed to do, just sit there and rot away?"
 3) "Um... I'm sorry."
 4) "What? I don't know what you're talking about!."
 5) "Hello. My name is Austin Colborn. You killed my father. Well,
 maybe not, but do you know where he is?"

>SAVE
>cf7
>2

 The creature seems to deflate under the sting of your tirade. It
 slumps against the wall and begins preening its fur nervously. "Oh,
 stink. You're right, apeling. Owrr was right to insist that the
 transport channels be shunted to security cells. I ignored you from
 impatience and must take the blame of destruction."

 Please select a reply:

 1) "Well, I'm sorry all the same. I had no idea what would happen when
 I broke through the floor of that cell. What is this place, anyway?"
 2) "You see how I had no choice. Still, those environments are
 fascinating -- are you trying to evolve intelligent species?"
 3) "Who is Owrr? What are you? What is this place? What in the world
 is going on?"
 4) "Fine. Have you seen any other 'simians' around here lately?"

>2

 The creature tilts its head, giving you an odd look. "Not exactly,
 cub. Not for its own sake. I study the origin of my species, called
 iueeoorr. We have a gap in our fossil record, between feline ancestors
 and proto-iueeoorr."

 "We have the same problem in ours," you say. "We call it the missing
 link."

 "I know, cub. Quiet, now. I found ancient bacteria in salt deposits,
 and extracted it. Those beasts you saw were ordinary before infection.
 There is no missing link -- infection moves a species to sentience.
 Such is my theory, and this environment is to test it, but my rival
 Esrrua has sabotaged it with his spy-creature. That creature killed
 my... my pridemate, Owrr, escaped to your planet, and now endless
 strings of apes tramp through here to chase it."

 Please select a reply:

 1) "Wait, are you telling me that some alien creature is on my world,
 and that my parents and their friend are chasing it?"
 2) "I'm sorry for your loss. This spy-creature... it's on my planet?
 Is it dangerous?"
 3) "That's all I needed to know, and since you're obviously so eager
 to be rid of me, I'm going to go find my parents."

>1

 "Yes," says the cat-creature, still preening its fur. "Probably Esrrua
 as well."

 "Could they be dangerous to the people on my world?"

 "Very likely. That's why those others pursued it. Myself, I have more
 important priorities, like repairing the damage you caused."

 "Yeah, you work on those priorities," snarls Emily, "and we'll work on
 ours. Okay, Austin, this curtain takes us one step closer to Mom and
 Dad. Let's head back home, shall we?" Without waiting for an answer,
 she grabs your hand and pulls you into the curtain with her. The
 familiar, sleepy feeling of teleportation engulfs you immediately.
