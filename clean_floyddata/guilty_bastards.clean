 Your hotel room
   Morning sunlight filters through the gauzy drapes.  Old wooden night
 table, fan overhead, the usual trappings.  The door leads out into the
 hallway.  The neatly made bed looks exactly the same as it did when you
 saw it this morning--from where you woke up slumped in the chair in the
 corner.
   The desk clerk must've slipped an envelope under the door sometime
 early this morning.

>take envelope
 You scoop the envelope up off the floor.

>examine me
 Looking good.

>inventory
 You are carrying an envelope.

>examine envelope
 It's addressed to you in handwriting.  Plain white envelope, no return
 address, no postmark.

>read envelope
 It's addressed to you in handwriting.  Plain white envelope, no return
 address, no postmark.

>open it
 (Assuming you mean the envelope.)
 Opened.

 Inside the envelope are a small note and a studio pass.

>read note
 Handwritten, again, but this time on Rocket Pictures stationery.

 "8:30 at the studio.

            --MW"

 (which of course stands for Milt Walker)

 What?

>footnote
 Try "footnote (number)".

>footnote 1
 Milt Walker, the head of Rocket Pictures, is one of those people you've
 met in passing (since you don't exactly run in the same social circles)
 and under somewhat shady circumstances.  It was a couple years ago and
 involved Milt's son and a boatload of South American marijuana.  Grass,
 he kept calling it.  You remember finding it vaguely funny sitting
 across a table from this austere-looking studio head in a seedy Los
 Angeles bar while he speculated in a low voice about how he was going
 to "get rid of that much grass."  How he did get his son out of that
 jam and what part you played in the whole imbroglio you swore never to
 reveal, not even here.

 (Footnote 2)

>f 2
 You can't use the word "f".

>footnote 2
 Yes, it's true:  the author heisted the idea for these footnotes from
 the Infocom game "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".  But they are
 a pretty nifty idea.

>examine pass
 It's a drive-on parking pass for the Rocket Pictures Studios lot dated
 today.

>time
 Better start with a verb.

>quit
 Are you sure you want to quit (YES or NO)?

 in Visitor Parking.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Studio gate, in your cousin's Volvo</span>
 Welcome to Rocket Pictures Studios.  It's everything a Hollywood
 studio should be:  it has a bold, impressive gate; the grounds of the
 lot extending to the north are lined with rows of pale hangar-like
 soundstage buildings and ceramic-roofed bungalows; there's a
 staggering abundance of motorhomes; it has its own watertower; and
 it's not actually in Hollywood at all.
 (This last is demonstrated by the fact that there are one- and
 two-story shopping plazas and office buildings stretching as far as
 the eye can see instead of souvenir shops and T-shirt stands.)

 <span class="floydstyle em">(Footnote 8)</span>

>enter studio

 You can't enter the studio gate.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Studio backlot</span>
 It wouldn't be the hardest thing in the world to get lost back here
 among the soundstages, each of them nearly identical to the next
 except for the identifying number stenciled on it in faded white
 paint.  If you keep going straight to the north, eventually you'll get
 to the main building.  Or you could turn around and head back to the
 parking lot.  More buildings of an administrative flavor are over to
 the west.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle em">Main building</span>
 You're just in front of the main administrative building.  Somewhere
 behind these walls are the executive offices of Rocket Pictures:  a
 motley assemblage of manic creative near-genius, mediocre posturing,
 epidemic insecurity, monumental bravado, white-knuckle risk-taking,
 milquetoast acquiescence, stark paranoia, and great leather furniture.
   Milt Walker is here, standing outside the building.

 Milt speaks in a fairly low voice, straight and to the point, looking
 around, careful not to be overheard.  "Maybe you already guessed this,
 but I asked you here to talk about Cindy Painter's death.  I don't
 know if there's anything that you can find out that the cops haven't
 or won't, but I'm willing to give you twelve hours to see what you can
 do."

>ask Milt about Cindy

 "It's such a goddamned tragedy," Milt says, pulling his glasses down
 and rubbing his eyes.  "I've known her for years, since long before
 she came here, tried to break in.  Knew her father, her parents are in
 Detroit.  She was just on the verge; she was making a picture for
 us--Stuart Fina was the executive on it."  He points over toward the
 side building.

 "Here," Milt says.  He hands you a report marked "LAPD Homicide
 Report".  "A contact of mine at the Police Department managed to
 procure this.  I don't know if it will be of any help."

>read report

 The report is titled "LAPD HOMICIDE REPORT".  It describes how on May
 23, Cindy Painter, a twenty-four year-old actress, was found strangled
 in her apartment on National Boulevard.  Forensics suggest that she
 opened the door to have the intruder burst in on her.  The body was
 found in the bedroom; there were no signs of assault other than
 strangulation.

>ask milt about fina

 "He's a pretty sharp kid," he says.  "Been with us about a year,
 worked on a couple of medium-sized pictures.  This picture Cindy was
 doing--<span class="floydstyle em">Hugs and Kisses</span>--was his first as Executive in Charge
 of Production.  Sounds like he's done a good job on it."

 "You might want to go to her apartment--I don't know if the police are
 still there or not.  Maybe you can find something they're missing."
 He hands you a single apartment key.

>ask him about police

 (Assuming you mean Milt.)
 Milt doesn't seem to know anything about the police.

 "I'm going to be in and out today--I've still got a damned studio to
 run, even with all this mess going on.  I'll try to keep checking back
 out here for you after an hour or so."

>ask milt about suspects

 You can't use the word "suspects".

>ask milt about witnesses

 You can't use the word "witnesses".

>go south

 Verbose descriptions.

 parking lot.  More buildings of an administrative flavor are over to
 the west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Side building</span>
 The people who work in this building are the people who all hope
 that one day they'll end up working in the other building.  Not that
 this building is bad--not that it's a fire hazard or anything like
 that--although the budget allocated for repairs to the roof probably
 went into new oak paneling inside the main building.  And maybe this
 place someone like you could at least get into.  Probably just by
 leaving the shade of this tree and climbing up the set of three stairs
 that leads to the door.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Reception area</span>
 You could plunk yourself down in one of the two comfy-looking
 high-backed chairs while waiting for someone.  The minty-blue hospital
 tint to the walls could take some getting used to, though.  A hallway
 of office doors extends to the west, or you can go back outside to the
 south.
 The building's receptionist is sitting at her desk.  Her nameplate
 says her name is Anne.

 The phone rings.  Anne answers it and takes down a message.

>ask anne about fina

 "Who shall I say is here?" Anne asks, looking you up and down.
 "Um...forget it.  I'll just buzz him."  She punches a couple of
 buttons on her phone and speaks very briefly into it before hanging
 up.

>go west

 Now, seeing as you don't know your way around here, the best you can
 hope for is to wind up wandering the halls and maybe getting security
 called on you.  Better to wait here if there's someone you need to
 see.

>ask anne about cindy

 "I think it's horrible what happened to her!  I was so upset when I
 heard--I didn't know her, though."  Anne looks at you.  "What do you
 have to do with it?  Is that why you're here?"

>say yes

 That doesn't make any sense.

>yes

 That was a rhetorical question.  (Although you sound rather positive.)

>ask anne about fina

 "I just called him for you."  She seems a little annoyed with your
 impatience.  "You're welcome to have a seat."

>ask anne about anne

 Anne looks at you in a way that says, hey, I'm just the
 receptionist--I'm not bothering <span class="floydstyle em">you</span>, am I?

 Stuart Fina appears from somewhere down the hallway.  He obviously
 doesn't recognize you, but he manages to greet you with one of those
 practised smiles that suggests you're the best thing that's happened
 to him all day.  "Hi there.  Stuart Fina."

>ask fina about cindy

 "Yeah, well, geez..."  Stuart trails off, shaking his head.  "God, I
 really don't know what to say...I mean it's terrible, absolutely
 terrible.  She had such a bright future.  She was going to be a huge
 star.  Her picture, the one she was doing with us--it's going to be a
 <span class="floydstyle em">hit</span>.  A huge hit.  When people see it they're going to think
 about James Dean and Marilyn Monroe and all wonder 'What if...?'"

>ask fina about fina

 Stuart would probably rather not talk about himself.

>ask fina about movie

 "Oh, it's going to be a big, big hit.  It's testing through the
 roof--test audiences are just loving it.  Cindy's perfect in it:  this
 sweet, adorable girl plotting all these terrible ways to kill her
 cheating lover."  Stuart sighs heavily.  "It just makes what happens
 to Cindy that much sadder...that much more of a tragedy."

>ask fina about milt

 "Milt?  I idolize Milt," Stuart says.  "You know what he is in this
 business?  The godfather.  The king.  Milt talks and people don't even
 question it.  If there's one guy you don't want to look like an idiot
 in front of it's Milt Walker."

>ask fina about alibi

 You can't use the word "alibi".

   Your cousin's Volvo is parked here.

>get in volvo

 You climb into the Volvo.

>drive to apartment
 %% Critical error.
 %% Message: stream_open_file: unable to open file.

 You drive south to National Blvd. and pull over to the curb next to
 Cindy Painter's apartment building.

 <span class="floydstyle em">National Boulevard, in your cousin's Volvo</span>
 The sidewalk leads south from the street to Cindy Painter's
 building, which is a three-story apartment complex.  Maybe it's not
 Beverly Hills, but you know, it's not bad.  National extends to the
 east, and also to the west before curving away to the north.

>get out

 You get out of the Volvo.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Cindy Painter's apartment building</span>
 The sidewalk leads south from the street and under the thick
 greenery hanging lazily from a concrete overhang to the base of the
 stairs leading up.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle em">Apartment stairs</span>
 You stand on the cool cement steps outside Cindy Painter's
 apartment.  At least you assume it's hers on account of all the yellow
 "POLICE LINE--DO NOT CROSS" tape crisscrossing the door, which is
 closed.  The doors to the other apartments are closed, too.  You can
 go back down to the ground from here.

>enter apartment

 You unlock the door and go in, ducking under the tape and closing the
 door quietly behind you.

 (Now keep in mind that this is a crime scene, and you may want to be
 fairly judicious about what you disturb--or at least leave disturbed.)

 <span class="floydstyle em">Cindy Painter's living room</span>
 Rather sparsely decorated:  a fairly new sofa sitting in the middle
 of the hardwood floor commands your attention.  There's a television
 in the corner.  The sole bedroom is to the north.  East takes you into
 the kitchen, or you can go back out into the stairwell.

>examine sofa

 The sofa is cloth-covered, off-white, relatively new, low almost to
 the floor, and not the cheapest you could possibly find.

>search sofa

 You don't find anything.

>look under sofa

 A cassette tape is half-sticking out from under the sofa, probably
 overlooked by the police.

>get tape

 Taken.

>examine tape

 Handwritten on the cassette label is "New Songs - May 15".  If the the
 tape player in the Volvo worked, you'd even be able to give it a
 listen.  The contact address on the tape is in Santa Monica.

>look behind sofa

 You don't find anything behind the sofa.

>examine television

 The fairly expensive television is sitting on the floor in the way in
 of a fairly expensive television just purchased by someone who has yet
 to buy a nice wall-unit for it.  The TV is turned off.

>go north

 Not a good idea:  everything in the bedroom has been covered with
 plastic--presumably to protect the crime scene from contamination--so
 you'd be best not to go tromping around all over it.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle em">Kitchen</span>
 Refrigerator, stove, sink, kitchen window.  An empty carton of
 grapefruit juice sitting on the counter.  The living room is back out
 to the west.

>fridge

 That doesn't make any sense.

>examine fridge

 Done in the same style and color as the stove:  part of a matching
 set.  The fridge is closed.

>open fridge

 Opened.

>look in fridge

 The refrigerator is curiously empty of anything edible.

>close fridge

 Closed.

>look through window

 Through the window you can see behind the building, where a narrow
 alley plays host to a garbage dumpster.

>examine sink

 It's pretty much your average stainless-steel kitchen sink and faucet
 combo.  Entirely appropriate for washing dishes or rinsing vegetables
 or anything like that.  The boring tangle of plumbing is likely
 concealed in the cupboard beneath the sink.

>search cupboard

 The cupboard is closed.

>open cupboard

 Opened.

 You can see the kitchen sink's plumbing in the cupboard.
 Various cleaning supplies--rags, cleansers, disinfectants, etc.--are
 tucked away in the cupboard in the space around and behind the
 plumbing.

 Cindy Painter's apartment key, and a cassette tape.  Inside the
 envelope are a small note and a studio pass.

 You can't use the word "nm".

>go north

 It's by trying to get into the main building that you learn--if you
 didn't know already--that trying to get into an office on a studio lot
 is like a maximum security jailbreak in reverse.  The Pentagon would
 be easier to get into.  Especially looking like a potential wannabe
 filmmaker, starved of sleep and cash the way you are.  Milt Walker's
 assistant has never heard of you, and the friendly yet stern gentleman
 behind the security desk suggests you get yourself on an appointment
 list.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Studio backlot</span>
 It wouldn't be the hardest thing in the world to get lost back here
 among the soundstages, each of them nearly identical to the next
 except for the identifying number stenciled on it in faded white
 paint.  If you keep going straight to the north, eventually you'll get
 to the main building.  Or you could turn around and head back to the
 parking lot.  More buildings of an administrative flavor are over to
 the west.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Studio gate</span>
 Welcome to Rocket Pictures Studios.  It's everything a Hollywood
 studio should be:  it has a bold, impressive gate; the grounds of the
 lot extending to the north are lined with rows of pale hangar-like
 soundstage buildings and ceramic-roofed bungalows; there's a
 staggering abundance of motorhomes; it has its own watertower; and
 it's not actually in Hollywood at all.
   Your cousin's Volvo is parked here.

>get in car

 You climb into the Volvo.

 %% Critical error.

 You drive to Santa Monica and park along Ocean Avenue.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Santa Monica, in your cousin's Volvo</span>
 This is about as far west as you can get on the mainland United
 States and not be driving on the sand.  Ocean Avenue extends north and
 south, lined with palm trees and brightly colored, Santa Monica-ish
 buildings.  You can get a better view of the beach to the west.

>get out

 You get out of the Volvo.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle em">Overlooking the beach</span>
 From here you can see the hazy mist hanging over the Pacific Ocean
 and the long curve of the coastline north past Malibu.  A cement
 stairway descends to the beach from here, or you can go back east to
 where the Volvo is parked.

>go down
 %% Critical error.
 %% Message: stream_open_file: unable to open file.

 You climb down the cement steps to the sandy beach below.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Beach</span>
 You're facing south on a walking/running/rollerblading/whatever path
 that parallels the beach north-south along the ocean.  Quite a few
 people are involved in beach-ish activities.  You could follow the
 coastline further to the south, or go back up to the higher ground
 overlooking the beach.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Billy Van Earl's house</span>
 The house is archetypically tall and thin--the norm for houses along
 this row on the Santa Monica beach.  A balcony looks out from the
 second story--you can hear music from above.  There's a doorbell here
 at path level.

>ring bell

 You push the doorbell and hear a muffled ring indoors.

>wait

 Time passes...

 After a minute or so, Billy Van Earl comes ambling down from somewhere
 upstairs.  "Hey," he says, squinting.

 Do you want to keep waiting (YES or NO)?
>y

 Johnny LaFleure isn't here.

>ask billy about birthday card

 "What am I supposed to know about somebody's birthday card?"

>show card to billy

 Which card do you mean, the birthday card or the torn business card?

>show birthday card to billy

 Billy looks at the card, surprised.  Then not-so-surprised.  Then he
 swallows.  "Well, that could be any Billy, right?"  He reconsiders.
 Deep breath.  "Well...okay, so I did know her.  Look, can you blame
 me?  For lying, I mean?  I'm pretty freaked out here."

>ask him about cindy

 (Assuming you mean Billy.)
 "Look, man," Billy says, "You don't think I'm broken up over what
 happened?  Maybe I even, like, loved her, you know?  You think I don't
 miss Holly?  Well I do."

>ask him about holly

 (Assuming you mean Billy.)
 Billy's eyes widen.  "What?  Holly--?  Did I say Holly?  You
 mean...well, um.  God...damn..."  He blows his breath out.  You caught
 him.

 "Aw, geez, man..." Billy begins.  "Yeah, right--it <span class="floydstyle em">sounds</span>
 great to have all these chicks, right?  But it's a nightmare, you
 know?  I'm lying to Cindy, I'm making up excuses for where I've been,
 where I'm going, I'm sitting there in Malibu listening to Holly bitch
 and whine--and God, she can bitch and whine--all the time thinking
 'Cindy's gonna kill me...Cindy's gonna kill me...'"  Really trying his
 best to get your sympathy.  "But what was I supposed to do?  Dump
 Holly?  She's Holly Golden, man."

>ask him about johnny

 (Assuming you mean Billy.)
 Billy doesn't seem to know anything about Johnny LaFleure.

>ask him about milt

 (Assuming you mean Billy.)
 "Exactly!  Milt Walker, man!" Billy says excitedly.  "If you want to
 find out what happened to Cindy, that's one dude you should talk
 to--Milt Walker's one of those guys who knows everything and
 everybody."

>ask him about murder

 (Assuming you mean Billy.)
 Billy looks perplexed.  "Well, <span class="floydstyle em">I</span> don't know who killed her.
 I didn't have anything to do with it."  Then he suddenly clues in that
 maybe that's not the first thing on anyone's mind.  "You know, not
 that anybody'd even think I <span class="floydstyle em">did</span>, right?"

>ask him about alibi

 You can't use the word "alibi".

>ask billy about bixby

 "Oh, I know who you're talking about," Billy says, "but I don't know
 much about him.  Other than he was Cindy's agent and she talked about
 him once in a while.  I think he may've liked her, too.  In a way
 that's more than just her agent, you know?  Like, she said something
 once about how he said something that made her uncomfortable.  I don't
 really remember, though..."

 <span class="floydstyle em">Side building</span>
 The people who work in this building are the people who all hope
 that one day they'll end up working in the other building.  Not that
 this building is bad--not that it's a fire hazard or anything like
 that--although the budget allocated for repairs to the roof probably
 went into new oak paneling inside the main building.  And maybe this
 place someone like you could at least get into.  Probably just by
 leaving the shade of this tree and climbing up the set of three stairs
 that leads to the door.

>go up


 <span class="floydstyle em">Reception area</span>
 You could plunk yourself down in one of the two comfy-looking
 high-backed chairs while waiting for someone.  The minty-blue hospital
 tint to the walls could take some getting used to, though.  A hallway
 of office doors extends to the west, or you can go back outside to the
 south.
   Anne, the building's receptionist, is sitting at her desk.

>ask anne about lafleur

 Anne looks at you in a way that says, hey, I'm just the
 receptionist--I'm not bothering <span class="floydstyle em">you</span>, am I?

 Johnny LaFleure, French-Canadian movie star, is outside one of the
 soundstages having a smoke.

>ask johnny about holly

 "A sexy peach!" Johnny exclaims.  "Yes, I was her man not too long
 ago, but, you know, things did not work out.  My career got back on
 track and suddenly there were lots of other girls around and that was
 a cause of stress."

>ask johnny about bixby

 "That guy is a bastard," Johnny says.  "He punched me in the eye once.
 In the eye!  And when I was talking to him to be my agent!  What do

   Milt Walker is here, standing outside the building.

>ask milt about bixby

 "He's been Cindy's agent since she came out here," Milt says.  "But
 he's what you'd call small time.  Cindy was starting to break out.  We
 talked about if, after her movie opened, she should be thinking about
 moving up to a bigger agent."

>ask milt about holly

 "She's a famous actress.  She's been in some pictures for us.  A bit
 of a prima donna, too, for what it's worth.  I don't know what else to
 tell you."

>show birthday card to milt

 Milt nods.  "Van Earl must've given that to her.  Good for her for
 throwing it out."

 Milt sighs.  "All right.  I should have told you--I knew that Cindy
 was seeing this...this Billy Van Earl.  But he's not capable of
 murder.  What he <span class="floydstyle em">is</span> is a goddamned deadbeat, and I just
 wanted to...show some respect for Cindy and not have this kind of
 thing get out.  He's not capable of murder."  Milt pauses.  "Or do you
 think he is?"

 Milt looks at the card for a second.  "Might be Chuck Bixby.  He was
 Cindy's agent.  Got an office out on Wilshire."

>get in car

 You climb into the Volvo.

>drive to wiltshire

 You can't use the word "wiltshire".

>drive to wilshire

 You drive east along Wilshire, away from Beverly Hills and toward
 downtown.  You pull off onto a quiet side street and park.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Just off Wilshire Blvd., in your cousin's Volvo</span>
 This quiet, palm-tree-lined street runs south toward Wilshire Blvd.
 and the old office building at the corner.

>get out

 You get out of the Volvo.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle em">Wilshire Blvd. building lobby</span>
 You're standing right in the entrance to an old sunwashed stone
 office building at the corner of Wilshire and, well, somewhere just
 west of La Brea.  The lobby is about what you'd expect to find:
 office directory on one wall, small maintenance closet, fire alarm,
 ventilation grill.  Actually, of some interest but little use is the
 out-of-commission movie theater here on the ground level.  Other than
 that, you can go up and in to the offices.

>read directory

 The directory is made up of those plastic letters stuck in a grooved
 backing mounted on the wall.  It looks like the listings haven't been
 updated since the mid-1980s or so, and a few of the letters are
 missing so the names are a little bastardized:

    Dr. Emile Johns n - Br ast Enla gment
    Greenhorn & Smi h - I migration Law ers

 (and the one you're looking for:)

 Angled rows of metal shutters form a grating that you can't see
 through, but through which you can definitely feel a draft.

>go up

 You climb the stairs until you find the door to "Chuck Bixby - Talent
 Agent".

 <span class="floydstyle em">Chuck Bixby's office</span>
 The office is fairly bright--lots of windows.  The most notable
 thing in it is a big wooden desk on which, along with a bunch of other
 stuff, sits a computer.  The other most notable thing is a small,
 solid-looking safe visible under one side of the desk--notable in that
 "Hey, there's a safe here" sort of way.
   Chuck Bixby is sitting at his desk.

>examine bixby

 Chuck is in his late thirties, graying hair clipped short, hanging
 onto cool for as long as he can.  He regards you for the most part
 with a bemused raised eyebrow--but then you get the impression he
 regards pretty much everyone this way.

>ask bixby about bixby

 Chuck would probably rather not talk about himself.

>ask bixby about safe

 You haven't seen anything like that.

>examine safe

 It's a solid-looking gray safe sitting on the floor by Chuck's desk.
 The safe is closed and has a dial to open the combination lock on the
 front.

>ask bixby about safe

 "That's a good safe," Chuck tells you.  "Paid top dollar for it."

>ask bixby about Cindy

 "Cindy?  I thought the world of her," Chuck says.  "I still do.  I was
 as proud of her as of anybody I've ever represented.  She was going to
 go far--and she was such a good person, too."

>ask bixby about having the hots for Cindy and how she was going to fire his ass
 FIRE HIS ASS

 You can't use the word "having".

>ask bixby about job

 You can't use the word "job".

>ask bixby about movie

 "Well, I've never seen it--not even a test screening," Chuck says.
 "The studio's really, really close-lipped about it.  What, do I think
 she would've moved on, got a new agent?  Maybe."  Chuck shrugs.
 "These things happen.  You lose clients, you get new clients.  You
 can't let it really affect you one way or the other."  A beat.
 "Waitasec--you weren't really asking about me, were you?"

>ask bixby about billy

 "Look," he says, "I never really thought that much of him, not that it
 matters at all."

>ask bixby about holly

 Chuck shrugs.  "She's a movie star.  I don't know her.  I probably
 don't know much more than you."

>ask bixby about fina

 "He was the studio guy in charge of Cindy's movie, but I've really
 only talked to him a couple of times," Chuck tells you.

>ask bixby about Milt

 "Milt Walker is a tough guy, a good guy, an honest guy, a bastard of a
 tough negotiator," Chuck tells you.  "You ask around this town, you'll
 get all sorts of opinions on what people think of Milt Walker."

>show business card to milt

 Milt isn't here.

>show business card to bixby

 "Yeah, that's mine."

>ask bixby about johnny

 "I was almost his agent once," Chuck tells you.  "A few years ago,
 he'd done about nine lousy movies in a row and no one in town would
 even talk to him.  So we went out to dinner and he tried to sleep with
 my wife and I ended up punching him in the eye and, hey, today I'm not
 his agent."

 Jake Duffy is the younger brother of Sergeant Duffy, who ably assisted
 the player in Infocom's mystery games Deadline and The Witness, and
 was quick to slap the cuffs on him or her in Suspect.  (In other
 words, this is another case where the author has borrowed cheerfully
 from an interactive-fiction classic.)  Sergeant Duffy's key trait was
 his ability to appear instantly whenever needed, never overstaying his
 welcome, and subsequently disappearing just as instantly without a
 trace.  Now, Jake Duffy may not exactly be a cop like his big brother,
 but in a rare gesture of generosity toward the player's plight, at
 least that curious ability has here been made hereditary.
