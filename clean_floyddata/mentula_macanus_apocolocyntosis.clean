 Battlement
 The battlement perches precariously over the long, long drop into the
 black waters of the lake.  The rest of the castle is accessible through
 a doorway to the south.

 You can see the Gostak chief here.

 lank, thinning blond hair [reference 4].  He carries an enormous mace,
 which he wields as if it weighed nothing at all.

 The Gostak chief aims a vicious blow at your head.  You twist away
 desperately, skidding on the wet flagstones.  The mace smashes into the
 stone, throwing a shower of sparks.

 The giant jabs at you with the mace, forcing you to retreat towards the
 edge of the battlement.

>examine banana
 It's slightly curved.  Its brass-and-bronze peel has been split away,
 revealing the golden fruit within.  In short, a banana, made out of
 gold.

 The chieftan sneers.  "I'll distim your dosh, laddie!" he cries in a
 barbarically thick accent.  He looks quite pleased with himself for
 this linguistic feat.

 The giant pulverizes a flagstone from which you leapt just in time.

>offer banana

 The Gostak chief drives you towards the drop with a terrifying flourish
 of his mace.

>kiss chief

 A glancing blow catches your shoulder, sending you reeling to the very
 verge of the battlement.

>throw banana

 A crushing blow from the giant's mace strikes you full in the chest.
 Your mouth fills with blood as you pinwheel towards the dark water far
 below.

 *SPLASH*



 Surfacing and spitting out dark, bitter water, you realize that you

 Lake
 The lake waters are deadly cold.  The craggy southern shore, upon which
 is perched the Gostak castle, seems impossibly far away.  In all other
 directions, the lake stretches without visible end.

 The frigid water is sapping your strength.

 Your strength is nearly exhausted.

 As you flounder feebly in the lake, something slimy and tentacular
 grabs your leg and yanks you under the surface.  As the frigid waters
 close around you and everything goes black, the voice of the seer
 echoes in your ears: Fear death by water [reference 2].

 As your life passes before your eyes, your recollections pause at that
 fateful morning in the Forum when all your adventures, and all your

 PREFACE

 This account of the wedding at Cana, by the servant Micah, was
 considered apocryphal as early as the third century; it was therefore
 excluded from consideration at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393.  Various
 surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of
 Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on
 the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as
 instruction to the faithful.

 Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the
 second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common
 Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah"
 is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a
 fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more
 learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak;
 whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that
 the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action
 of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual
 eyewitness account.

 Be that as it may, it is hoped that this translation will prove to be
 as edifying to the modern scholar as its original author, whoever that
 might be, had intended.

 - Rev. Dr. Stephen Dawson
 Barchester, AD 1893

 "There's no more wine."

 You straighten up and turn to look at Amos, the head steward.  Outside
 the kitchen, the wedding party continues in full swing.  Inside, you
 look at Amos and Amos looks back at you and the disaster looms over
 both of you.  No more wine!  What would the master say!  For that
 matter, what would a courtyard full of friends and relatives from all
 over Judaea say!

 Martha (technically one of the guests, but she insisted, as usual, on
 helping out in the kitchen) interrupts your growing horror to point out
 that one of the wine jugs is missing.  "You should try to find it.  If
 we're lucky, there'll be enough wine in it to buy us a little more
 time."

 "A little more time?  Time for what?"

 "Time to get to the market and back, of course.  It's late, but
 hopefully there'll be one wine merchant still hanging about.  Amos, get
 a donkey and a small cart, and be quick about it."  Amos scurries off
 to do as he's told, and Martha turns to you: "And Micah, you see if you
 can find that missing jug!"

 Martha hurries off after Amos, through the back garden, avoiding the
 other guests and leaving you with your half of the mission.  Where on
 earth could that missing wine jug be?  As you consider the possible
 hiding places, you notice a flash of red hair disappearing out the
 doorway into the courtyard.  Just your luck: it's the little orphan
 brat that Martha and her brother and sister adopted, the one who's been
 getting underfoot all evening and who's probably heard everything.
 Hopefully she'll have enough sense to not tell the whole world that
 you're out of wine.  Hah, you should be so lucky.

 Cana According To Micah
 Translated from the Hebrew by Rev. Dr. Stephen Dawson
 Release 2 / Serial number 111013 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
 preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the
 south.  In the northeast corner, the door to the garden stands wide
 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the
 west is the winery.

 Except for you and Amos, because you're both ever so reliable, all the
 other servants have been given leave to go get some rest after the
 preparations earlier; no-one was expecting a sudden emergency to crop
 up before it came time to wash the dishes.

 All the actual food has been served, except for a plate of honeyed
 locusts that sits untemptingly nearby, unsurprisingly untouched.

>take plate
 Taken.

>examine me
 Your name is Micah, and you are a servant in the household of the
 family of Clopas.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a plate of honeyed locusts

>go south

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

 "Hey, mister!"  Little Anna trots up to you.  "Is it true that there's
 no more wine?  I saw Martha and Amos get into the cart with the donkey
 and they rode off in such a hurry.  Martha said you were going to find
 a missing jug of wine and maybe that would help.  Can I help?  Just say
 the word, sir!"

 Heaven help us.

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

>say yes
 (to Little Orphan Anna)
 Little Anna has entirely too much to say about that, none of it even
 remotely useful.

>ask anna about wine
 "I think I saw John, the Rabbi's son, sneaking away from the courtyard
 with a jug of wine earlier, before the feast actually started."

>ask anna about john
 "I think John is Lazarus's brother, but not a close brother.  I mean
 his parents are totally different people.  I wish there were a word for
 brothers and sisters who aren't actually your brothers and sisters,
 don't you?  Anyway, Mary likes to listen to him, and Lazarus likes to
 argue with him, but Martha says he ought to clean himself up and marry
 a nice, respectable girl and settle down.  She says he lives out in the
 wilderness and eats honey and locusts every day, which can't be
 healthy, but I guess he must like it or he wouldn't do it.  Or maybe
 he's so busy talking he forgets to eat -- his father's the same way."

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...had this dream about the
 butcher's late wife, so they called off the wedding...."

>anna, sing tomorrow
 Little Anna has entirely too much to say about that, none of it even
 remotely useful.

>ask anna about lazarus
 "Martha worries about him because he's not very strong, but he's very
 smart.  Everybody says he's going to be High Priest some day, if he
 lives long enough.  They don't say that last part to his face, of
 course, and both Martha and Mary get very upset when they hear it.
 They say it's bad luck, but Lazarus says that if his time comes early,
 then that's just the way it is."

>go north
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost
 puppy.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go northwest
 You can't go that way.

>go northeast
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like the too-long hem
 of an over-sized robe.

 Garden
 This rather large garden supplements the family's table with a few
 fruits and vegetables throughout the year.  Currently, it's about the
 only peaceful place on the property.  The kitchen is back to the
 southwest, and a passage leads south to the main entryway.  There is a
 stand of fig trees off to the northwest.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go northwest
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like Raphael following
 Tobias, but with significantly less divine intent.

 Among The Figs
 This is about as far from the maddening crowd as you can get, without
 actually leaving the house.  The fig trees provide shade in the
 daytime, and the air is pleasantly cool; this time of the evening,
 though, it's rather darker and more shadowy than you care for.  The
 garden itself is to the southeast.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>ask anna about wilderness
 Little Anna has entirely too much to say about that, none of it even
 remotely useful.

>take figs
 You pick a fig and eat it.  Yum.

>examine fig trees
 The fig trees have been planted a little too close together here.
 Their branches spread and interlace overhead, drenching the space
 between them in shadows.

 As you turn to leave, you hear what sounds like a lion's roar, followed
 by a slight rustle of leaves.  It takes you a few moments to recognise
 the roar as merely the rumble of an empty stomach.  Be that as it may,
 there's clearly someone hiding here.

>listen
 You hear nothing unexpected.

>search leaves
 You can't see any such thing.

>search trees
 You poke about the trees, searching for the intruder, but he's too
 stealthy for you.  Anyway, do you really want to meet up with this
 person, alone (small orphan girls don't count) out here in the dark?

>drop plate
 You carefully set down the plate of ... food.

>hide
 As you walk away from the plate of honeyed locusts, you hear some
 distinctly interested rustling in the bushes nearby.  You quickly duck
 behind one of the fig trees and wait.  A minute later, the rather
 unkempt form of John -- the Rabbi's son, no less -- slinks out of the
 shadows and descends upon the honeyed locusts.  (Better him than you,
 mate.)  More interesting is the fact that he's washing down the "food"
 with deep quaffs from the missing wine jug.

 "Hullo, John," you say, stepping out of the shadows.

 John only sighs and wipes his mouth on his sleeve.  "Why don't you
 leave me alone."

>ask john about jug
 "Mine.  Hands off."

>take wine
 John clutches the jug closer to himself and snarls, "hands off!  Mine!"

>press save
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask john about lazarus
 "Such a good boy, that Lazarus," says John, a little bitterly.  "Well,
 we all have our roles to play, and he'll play his soon enough.  Far be
 it for me to envy him his lot."

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>ask john about wedding
 John doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

>ask john about mary
 Who do you mean, the bride, Mary of Bethany or Mary of Nazareth?

>bride
 John frowns.  "She seems nice enough, but I seem to recall some rather
 odd business involving a candle and a mirror, and...."  John stops
 suddenly and shakes his head.  "No, wait, that's a different Mary.
 Your new mistress is a fine and honourable woman, and your master is
 fortunate indeed to have her."

>take plate
 That seems to belong to John.

>ask john about locusts
 "What?  I happen to like honeyed locusts.  Don't knock 'em till you've
 tried 'em."

>ask john about father
 "Father wanted me to make an appearance.  That's the only reason I'm
 here at all."

>ask john for wine
 John has better things to do.

 John doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

 dragon with her fussing."

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a lost sheep.

 Garden
 This rather large garden supplements the family's table with a few
 fruits and vegetables throughout the year.  Currently, it's about the
 only peaceful place on the property.  The kitchen is back to the
 southwest, and a passage leads south to the main entryway.  There is a
 stand of fig trees off to the northwest.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go south
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like an annoying
 following thing that follows.

 Entryway
 This oddly-shaped room is the house's main entryway.  The street is out
 to the east, and the courtyard is to the southwest.  In addition, a
 narrow passage leads north to an enclosed garden.

 Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an
 alcove, situated just so, to inconvenience any invading evil spirits.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>examine alcove
 In the alcove are some jars and a bucket.

>examine jars
 There are six large jars in the alcove, placed there so the guests may
 wash the dust from their feet after the long journey to get here.  All
 that splashing about has left each of them about half-full.

>examine bucket
 This is the bucket used to carry water from the village well to the
 house.  It's larger than average, but at least that means not having to
 make quite so many trips back and forth when filling up all those jars
 in the entryway.  Currently, the bucket is empty.

>search jars
 You find nothing of interest.

>take bucket
 Taken.

>go east
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a lost sheep.

 Out On The Street
 The road to town stretches off to the south, and the house is back to
 the west.  The dust has finally settled from the arrival of guests,
 and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is
 blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
 across the street to the east.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna, a bridesmaid and an ancient mariner
 here.

>examine bridesmaid
 You recognise her as one of the bridesmaids who'd been arranged for the
 wedding.  She wasn't actually at the wedding, though: Clopas was
 running a little late, and a bunch of the bridesmaids, including this
 one, had to run off to the market to replenish the oil in their lamps
 when he finally arrived.  These bridesmaids missed the wedding
 altogether as a result, and you thought they'd all gone home.
 Apparently one of them, at least, is still hanging around.

>ask bridesmaid about oil
 Unfortunately, the ancient mariner appears to have the bridesmaid's
 whole and unwilling attention.

>examine mariner
 This is a pitiful old beggar who's been hanging around town lately.
 He's a former sailor, apparently, and they say he's possessed, but it's
 just as likely that he's spent a little too much time in the sun with
 his head uncovered.  Either way, you know better than to sit down and
 let him tell you any of his interminable seafaring stories.

 "There passed a weary time ... a weary time! a weary time!" the old
 sailor mumbles.

 "I can well imagine," mutters the bridesmaid, with a glazed and weary
 eye.

>hello sailor
 "Shalom."

 "...and all that time, it hung there, a reminder of my sin, and I would
 have given a whole herd of goats as a sin offering if I could...."

>ask mariner about albatross
 What, and get him to talk to you?  You've seen this man pin down
 stronger men than yourself, for hours on end, with the simple
 introduction "There was a ship..." and you really don't have the hours
 to listen to it all.

>go east
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like the sort of
 disciple no prophet ever wants.

 By The Well
 You are standing beside the village well, a large stone structure with
 a heavy wooden cover to keep people and wandering animals from falling
 in.  Off to the west is the road to town, and beyond that is the house
 and the wedding.  Fields stretch out in all other directions.

 A few soldiers are hanging about nearby, looking grumpy.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 "Hey, you there!" says one of the soldiers, approaching you.  "You're
 from the house of Clopas, aren't you?  Do us a favour.  There's this
 man we're supposed to arrest, one John son of Zechariah.  And we know
 he's at this wedding, but see, we have no idea what he looks like."

 "Crazy wild man living in the wilderness, dressed in animal skins,"
 says another, "great description if he were doing his thing over on the
 Jordan, but here's this wedding and he's probably all cleaned up for
 it.  Probably looks like decent folk.  So if you know the guy and could
 point him out to us, we'd be much obliged."

>soldiers, follow me
 One of the soldiers, apparently the leader of the group, grins at you.
 "Good boy, I knew we could count on you.  Here, we'll need a signal.
 When you see this John son of Zechariah character, you let us know it's
 him by, uh, kissing him.  How's that?"

 "Why can't he just point at the guy?"

 "Shut up.  Weddings are crowded things and we want absolutely no
 mistakes, got it?  So no pointing from a distance or any of that sort
 of rubbish.  And this way, our new friend here can say that he never
 actually told us who our man was.  It's genius."

 Little Anna tugs on your sleeve and whispers, "are you sure this is a
 good idea, sir?"

>ask anna about soldiers
 "Nobody seems to like Herod's soldiers, which I think is a little sad.
 I mean, they're just doing their job, right?  Mary says that doing
 their job is one thing, but a lot of them could be a little nicer about
 it."

>ask anna about herod
 Little Anna has entirely too much to say about that, none of it even
 remotely useful.

>open well
 (the village well)
 You heave the wooden cover aside.

>lower bucket
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine well
 (the village well)
 The village well is a large, low stone ring with a rough wooden cover.
 During the day, it's a gathering space for local servants, women,
 shepherds, and pretty much the whole town.

>fill bucket
 Oh no, you hauled enough water from the well earlier today, filling up
 those jars for washing feet.  You're not doing this again unless you
 absolutely have to.

>go down
 It's cold and dark and wet and you're just asking for trouble, aren't
 you?

>yes
 That was a rhetorical question.

>close well
 (the village well)
 You carefully reposition the cover over the well.

>go west
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a red-headed
 shadow.

 The soldiers creep along behind you with rather more stealth and
 subtlety than you'd have expected.

 Out On The Street
 The road to town stretches off to the south, and the house is back to
 the west.  The dust has finally settled from the arrival of guests,
 and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is

 across the street to the east.

 A few soldiers are hanging about nearby, looking stealthy.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna, a bridesmaid and an ancient
 mariner here.

 The bridesmaid glances hopefully at the soldiers following you -- and
 you know she must be pretty desperate if she's expecting help from
 Herod's guards -- but they pretend not to notice.  One of them peers
 suspiciously at the old mariner and nudges you with his elbow, brow
 raised.

>kiss sailor
 You approach the ancient mariner and cough discreetly.  He glances at
 you and blinks.  "There was--" he begins, but you quickly step back and
 jerk your head in the direction of the soldiers standing just behind
 you.  Their eyes meet.

 "There was a ship," says the ancient mariner, with a sudden rush of
 unholy enthusiasm.

 "Oh no," whispers one of the soldiers as the first one stops in his
 tracks and, clearly against his will, tries to sit down.  The whole
 group of soldiers try to drag themselves away, as the old mariner
 hobbles along after them, claiming one after another one of them for
 his captive audience.

 In all the confusion, the bridesmaid manages to get away and slip
 inside the house.

>go south
 You don't have any business in town.

>go west
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like an annoying
 following thing that follows.

 Entryway
 This oddly-shaped room is the house's main entryway.  The street is out
 to the east, and the courtyard is to the southwest.  In addition, a
 narrow passage leads north to an enclosed garden.

 Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an
 alcove, situated just so, to inconvenience any invading evil spirits.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna and a bridesmaid here.

 "Thank you," says the bridesmaid, "I didn't think the old man would
 ever stop talking, and somehow I just couldn't stop listening to him.
 It's not that his story was all that long and terrible; it's actually
 not bad, once you've put the pieces together.  But he would insist on
 jumping around at random, and repeating some bits over and over."  She
 sighs and turns to enter the courtyard.  "Well, ask me about the story
 sometime, if you want to know what it was all about, and I'll tell it
 to you so that it makes sense.  For now, I'm just going to go and enjoy
 what's left of the party."

>ask bridesmaid about oil
 You can't see any such thing.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>go southwest
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost
 puppy.

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You can see the bridesmaid, the one you rescued from the ancient
 mariner, mingling with the guests.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>ask bridesmaid about oil
 "Oh, don't remind me.  You have no idea how mortifying it all was,

 Say what you like, he's always done his duty by her...."

>examine guests
 Friends and family from all over Judaea.

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like an Egyptian

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
 preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the

 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the
 west is the winery.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go west

 Winery
 This is where the family keeps the wine and the olive oil.  It is a
 cool, windowless room; the kitchen proper is up some steps to the east.

 A rickety set of shelves stands against one wall.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Anna takes a step back and points up to the top of the shelves.  "Look,
 there's a jug up there!  Maybe there's some wine in it!"  You tell her
 not to be silly, you know for a fact.... but Anna's already begun
 clambering up the front of the shelves.  As might be expected, the
 shelves creak alarmingly and begin to sway forward as Anna reaches the
 top....

>SAVE

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>get anna
 You snatch Little Anna away from the toppling shelves, and not a moment
 too soon.  The shelves and their precious contents smash into the floor
 and shatter into pieces.  Clopas will have your head in the morning,
 assuming he's not too hungover then (fat chance of that, all things
 considered) but in the meantime, Anna just stares wide-eyed at the mess
 she's caused.  "Ooh," she says, "I guess I shan't be trying that
 again...."

 By The West Wall
 The guests gather in clumps along the western periphery of the
 courtyard, under the glow of the hanging lamps.  Of particular note is
 the more scholarly crowd, clustered around the venerable old Rabbi.
 The rest of the courtyard is to east and southeast.

 The Rabbi is holding court with a crowd of would-be scholars, among
 whom you recognise Lazarus of Bethany.

 Mary of Bethany hovers on the periphery, largely ignored by the learned
 men.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...his mother-in-law, would you

>examine me
 Your name is Micah, and you are a servant in the household of the

>examine mary
 It seems like every woman is named Mary these days, but this particular
 Mary is an odd one.  She can usually be found hanging about wherever
 there are learned men having learned discourse; and they say she wants
 to be a female Rabbi.  As if.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...wagon driven by a pack of
 drunken scoundrels.  She was barely more than...."

>ask mary about john
 "He's certainly very learned.  I could listen to him for hours.  I
 haven't seen him this evening, though."

>examine rabbi
 Zechariah, the Rabbi, is a venerable and ancient man, a learned and
 highly respected member of the community.  Now if only he would shut up
 once in a while.  You've heard it said that he was struck dumb with
 surprise when he heard he was going to be a father -- given his age and
 the age of his wife, anyone would be -- and remained that way until his
 son John was born.  But you can hardly believe it.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...in the middle of winter.
 Anyway, she was lost and...."

>ask rabbi about john
 The crowd around the Rabbi is too thick and loud and full of
 themselves, and won't let you through to him.

>examine crowd
 Friends and family from all over Judaea.

>examine lazarus
 Lazarus of Bethany is a pale, somewhat sickly-looking fellow who was
 invited along with his sisters Mary and Martha.  Martha fusses over him
 something awful, and you suspect that he brought Little Anna into his
 household just to divert some of Martha's attention away from himself.

>ask lazarus about anna
 Lazarus of Bethany is rather too involved in the ongoing discussion
 with the Rabbi to pay much attention to what you have to say.

 Bridal Table
 The lamps are brightest here, where the main table overlooks the crush
 of wedding guests to the north and northwest.  The family's main
 sleeping quarters are beyond, to the south, but no-one has any business
 going there.

 The happy couple sit here, accepting congratulations and well wishes,
 and occasionally exchanging shy glances as if they'd only just met.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Mary, the bride, is about to take a sip from her cup when a guest comes
 up to offer her congratulations.  Mary puts down her cup to thank the
 guest and promptly forgets about it.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...a terrible snob, but you won't
 find a more honest man...."

>examine cup
 Clopas and Mary have been so busy receiving everyone's well-wishes, and
 with making eyes at each other, that they've barely had time to touch
 their cups.  Under the circumstances, this is probably a good thing.

>examine clopas
 As far as employers go, Clopas is not a bad sort.  He was rather
 fearfully late coming in -- his story was that he had to stop and give
 a hand to some poor Samaritan traveller who'd been set upon by bandits
 -- and then when he finally did arrive, a bunch of bridesmaids who'd
 been caught unprepared were sent packing.  That's just the kind of guy
 he is: a bit hard and uncompromising, but always willing to bend over
 backwards if you need help.

>ask clopas about lazarus
 Clopas seems rather pre-occupied with all the complicated business of
 being a newlywed.  It would be a shame to disturb him.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...his mother-in-law, would you

>ask mary about lazarus
 Mary seems rather pre-occupied with the complicated business of being a

 The bridesmaid continues the story, describing the nightmarish fate of

 once Martha filled up his cup with the best wine, but he was so busy
 talking to Mary and Lazarus that he just put the cup down and forgot
 about it.  Well, Mary and Lazarus and Mary like to listen, but I
 thought it was a little rude.  Martha tells me so all the time.  Anna,
 she says, this non-stop chatter is very tiresome.  But of course she
 nevers tells Uncle Zechariah that to his face, because he's a very
 important person.  But she always makes sure I'm helping her in the
 kitchen when Uncle Zechariah visits, so I don't get bored."

 only peaceful place on the property.  The kitchen is back to the
 southwest, and a passage leads south to the main entryway.  There is a
 stand of fig trees off to the northwest.

>go northwest
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost
 puppy.

 Among The Figs
 This is about as far from the maddening crowd as you can get, without
 actually leaving the house.  The fig trees provide shade in the
 daytime, and the air is pleasantly cool; this time of the evening,
 though, it's rather darker and more shadowy than you care for.  The
 garden itself is to the southeast.

 John, the Rabbi's son, lounges sullenly against a tree, hugging a
 nearly-full jug of wine to himself.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>ask john about rabbi
 "Father wanted me to make an appearance.  That's the only reason I'm
 here at all."

>ask john about soldiers
 John sniffs disdainfully, but declines to say anything.

>kiss john
 Keep your mind on the game.

>ask john about john
 "John ben Zechariah, commonly called the Baptist.  What, you really
 didn't recognise me in this monkey suit (Hebrew unclear - SD.) my
 father made me put on?"

>xyzzy
 Is that supposed to be Punic?  Your accent is execrable.

 You pick a fig and eat it.  Yum.

>ask anna about locusts
 "Please, sir, I'd rather not have any at all."

>ask anna about john
 "I think John is Lazarus's brother, but not a close brother.  I mean
 his parents are totally different people.  I wish there were a word for
 brothers and sisters who aren't actually your brothers and sisters,
 don't you?  Anyway, Mary likes to listen to him, and Lazarus likes to
 argue with him, but Martha says he ought to clean himself up and marry
 a nice, respectable girl and settle down.  She says he lives out in the
 wilderness and eats honey and locusts every day, which can't be
 healthy, but I guess he must like it or he wouldn't do it.  Or maybe
 he's so busy talking he forgets to eat -- his father's the same way."

>ask john about locusts
 "What?  I happen to like honeyed locusts.  Don't knock 'em till you've
 tried 'em."

>tell story to john
 "You don't have to tell me," John snaps.  "That old man came to the
 Jordan to be baptised a couple of months ago, and held up two of my
 disciples for three days, telling it to them.  And the whole thing
 really didn't take more than four minutes, when they repeated it to me
 later.

 Entryway
 This oddly-shaped room is the house's main entryway.  The street is out
 to the east, and the courtyard is to the southwest.  In addition, a
 narrow passage leads north to an enclosed garden.

 Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an
 alcove, situated just so, to inconvenience any invading evil spirits.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>ask anna about parents
 Anna looks a little wistful.  "I don't know anything about my parents,
 but I'd bet they were young ... bet they were smart.  Bet they
 collected things like ashtrays and art."  She pauses, a little puzzled.
 "What's an ashtray?"

>It's trash in pig latin.
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go southwest
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a red-headed

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You can see the bridesmaid, the one you rescued from the ancient
 mariner, mingling with the guests.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go south
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like Raphael following
 Tobias, but with significantly less divine intent.

 Bridal Table
 The lamps are brightest here, where the main table overlooks the crush
 of wedding guests to the north and northwest.  The family's main
 sleeping quarters are beyond, to the south, but no-one has any business
 going there.

 The happy couple sit here, accepting congratulations and well wishes,
 and occasionally exchanging shy glances as if they'd only just met.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>anna, take cup
 She'll only drop it, you're sure.

>anna, give cup to me
 (Little Orphan Anna first taking the cups)
 She'll only drop it, you're sure.

 Mary, the bride, is about to take a sip from her cup when a guest comes
 up to offer his congratulations.  Mary puts down her cup to thank the
 guest and promptly forgets about it.

>put cup in bucket
 That's hardly helpful.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...could go for another drink right
 now.  I'm not properly drunk yet...."

>go northwest
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost
 puppy.

 By The West Wall
 The guests gather in clumps along the western periphery of the
 courtyard, under the glow of the hanging lamps.  Of particular note is
 the more scholarly crowd, clustered around the venerable old Rabbi.
 The rest of the courtyard is to east and southeast.

 Mary of Bethany hovers on the periphery, largely ignored by the learned
 men.

 The Rabbi is holding court with a crowd of would-be scholars, among
 whom you recognise Lazarus of Bethany.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>tell story to lazarus
 Lazarus of Bethany is rather too involved in the ongoing discussion
 with the Rabbi to pay much attention to what you have to say.

>tell story to mary
 "There was a ship..." you begin, which catches Mary's attention
 immediately.

 "That sounds familiar," she says, giving you her full attention.
 "Isn't it the beginning part of that rather confused story that the
 mariner outside tells?  If you've got it all organised, I'd like to
 hear it."

>again
 Mary shudders as you describe the curse that befell the mariner's crew.
 "How terrible!  Should all the people suffer for the sin of one man?"

>again
 "What a terrible story!"  Mary seems to be hanging on to your every
 word, nonetheless.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...in the middle of winter.
 Anyway, she was lost and...."

>again
 "And is that how it ends, with the old mariner turning his gaze away
 from his suffering to these sea snakes?  But why would the Lord relent
 for something like that?"  Mary looks to you for the moral of the
 story.

>again
 "But why would the Lord relent for something like that?"  Mary looks to
 you for the moral of the story.

 Mary presses you for further details or possibly an explanation for the
 more inexplicable aspects of the story, but you have to confess that
 you cannot add to what you have told her.  Disappointed, she returns to
 the Rabbi and his entourage for more erudite discourse.

>wait
 Time passes.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...a pound of flesh, of all things,
 but then the other gentile's wife pointed out that...."

>tell Mary about moral
 Mary listens attentively, but has little to tell you.

>ask mary about martha
 "My sister means well," she says vaguely.

>ask mary about god
 Mary listens attentively, but has little to tell you.

>The idea of putting Anna in the well is gaining strength with me.
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
 across the street to the east.

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like the sort of

 You are standing beside the village well, a large stone structure with

 PREFACE

 This account of the wedding at Cana, by the servant Micah, was
 considered apocryphal as early as the third century; it was therefore
 excluded from consideration at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393.  Various
 surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of
 Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on
 the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as
 instruction to the faithful.

 Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the
 second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common
 Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah"
 is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a
 fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more
 learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak;
 whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that
 the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action
 of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual
 eyewitness account.

 Be that as it may, it is hoped that this translation will prove to be
 as edifying to the modern scholar as its original author, whoever that
 might be, had intended.

 - Rev. Dr. Stephen Dawson
 Barchester, AD 1893

 "There's no more wine."

 You straighten up and turn to look at Amos, the head steward.  Outside
 the kitchen, the wedding party continues in full swing.  Inside, you
 look at Amos and Amos looks back at you and the disaster looms over
 both of you.  No more wine!  What would the master say!  For that
 matter, what would a courtyard full of friends and relatives from all
 over Judaea say!

 Martha (technically one of the guests, but she insisted, as usual, on
 helping out in the kitchen) interrupts your growing horror to point out
 that one of the wine jugs is missing.  "You should try to find it.  If
 we're lucky, there'll be enough wine in it to buy us a little more
 time."

 "A little more time?  Time for what?"

 "Time to get to the market and back, of course.  It's late, but
 hopefully there'll be one wine merchant still hanging about.  Amos, get
 a donkey and a small cart, and be quick about it."  Amos scurries off
 to do as he's told, and Martha turns to you: "And Micah, you see if you
 can find that missing jug!"

 Martha hurries off after Amos, through the back garden, avoiding the
 other guests and leaving you with your half of the mission.  Where on
 earth could that missing wine jug be?  As you consider the possible
 hiding places, you notice a flash of red hair disappearing out the
 doorway into the courtyard.  Just your luck: it's the little orphan
 brat that Martha and her brother and sister adopted, the one who's been
 getting underfoot all evening and who's probably heard everything.
 Hopefully she'll have enough sense to not tell the whole world that
 you're out of wine.  Hah, you should be so lucky.

 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the

 Except for you and Amos, because you're both ever so reliable, all the
 other servants have been given leave to go get some rest after the
 preparations earlier; no-one was expecting a sudden emergency to crop
 up before it came time to wash the dishes.

 All the actual food has been served, except for a plate of honeyed
 locusts that sits untemptingly nearby, unsurprisingly untouched.

 "Hey, mister!"  Little Anna trots up to you.  "Is it true that there's

 he's at this wedding, but see, we have no idea what he looks like."

 "Crazy wild man living in the wilderness, dressed in animal skins,"
 says another, "great description if he were doing his thing over on the
 Jordan, but here's this wedding and he's probably all cleaned up for
 it.  Probably looks like decent folk.  So if you know the guy and could
 point him out to us, we'd be much obliged."

 Come to think of it, you haven't seen the Rabbi's son since that

 Garden
 This rather large garden supplements the family's table with a few
 fruits and vegetables throughout the year.  Currently, it's about the
 only peaceful place on the property.  The kitchen is back to the
 southwest, and a passage leads south to the main entryway.  There is a
 stand of fig trees off to the northwest.

 Among The Figs
 This is about as far from the maddening crowd as you can get, without
 actually leaving the house.  The fig trees provide shade in the
 daytime, and the air is pleasantly cool; this time of the evening,
 though, it's rather darker and more shadowy than you care for.  The
 garden itself is to the southeast.

 the roar as merely the rumble of an empty stomach.  Be that as it may,
 there's clearly someone hiding here.

>se
 As you walk away from the plate of honeyed locusts, you hear some
 distinctly interested rustling in the bushes nearby.  You quickly duck
 behind one of the fig trees and wait.  A minute later, the rather
 unkempt form of John -- the Rabbi's son, no less -- slinks out of the
 shadows and descends upon the honeyed locusts.  (Better him than you,
 mate.)  More interesting is the fact that he's washing down the "food"
 with deep quaffs from the missing wine jug.

 "Hullo, John," you say, stepping out of the shadows.

 John only sighs and wipes his mouth on his sleeve.  "Why don't you
 leave me alone."

 When you see this John son of Zechariah character, you let us know it's
 him by, uh, kissing him.  How's that?"

 "Why can't he just point at the guy?"

 "Shut up.  Weddings are crowded things and we want absolutely no
 mistakes, got it?  So no pointing from a distance or any of that sort
 of rubbish.  And this way, our new friend here can say that he never
 actually told us who our man was.  It's genius."

 Little Anna tugs on your sleeve and whispers, "are you sure this is a
 good idea, sir?"

>w. w. n. nw.
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a guilty
 conscience.

 The soldiers creep along behind you with rather more stealth and
 subtlety than you'd have expected.

 Out On The Street
 The road to town stretches off to the south, and the house is back to
 the west.  The dust has finally settled from the arrival of guests,
 and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is
 blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
 across the street to the east.

 A few soldiers are hanging about nearby, looking stealthy.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna, a bridesmaid and an ancient
 mariner here.

 The bridesmaid glances hopefully at the soldiers following you -- and
 you know she must be pretty desperate if she's expecting help from
 Herod's guards -- but they pretend not to notice.  One of them peers
 suspiciously at the old mariner and nudges you with his elbow, brow
 raised.

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost
 puppy.

 The soldiers creep along behind you with rather more stealth and
 subtlety than you'd have expected.

 Entryway
 This oddly-shaped room is the house's main entryway.  The street is out
 to the east, and the courtyard is to the southwest.  In addition, a
 narrow passage leads north to an enclosed garden.

 Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an
 alcove, situated just so, to inconvenience any invading evil spirits.

 A few soldiers are hanging about nearby, looking stealthy.

 Garden
 This rather large garden supplements the family's table with a few
 fruits and vegetables throughout the year.  Currently, it's about the
 only peaceful place on the property.  The kitchen is back to the
 southwest, and a passage leads south to the main entryway.  There is a
 stand of fig trees off to the northwest.

 Among The Figs
 This is about as far from the maddening crowd as you can get, without
 actually leaving the house.  The fig trees provide shade in the
 daytime, and the air is pleasantly cool; this time of the evening,
 though, it's rather darker and more shadowy than you care for.  The
 garden itself is to the southeast.

 A few soldiers are hanging about nearby, looking stealthy.

 John, the Rabbi's son, lounges sullenly against a tree, hugging a
 nearly-full jug of wine to himself.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>point at john
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>kiss john
 John looks at you in puzzlement, then sees the approaching soldiers
 over your shoulder.  "Oh, I get it," he says, his brow darkening, "this
 is some sort of identification signal, isn't it?  I thought the house
 of Clopas understood hospitality a little better than that."

 "You can come along with us," says one of the soldiers, all puffed up
 with officious importance.  John puts up no resistance, but gives you a
 venomous glance over his shoulder as the soldiers lead him away.

 You are struck by an inexplicaple sense of déjà vu, as the Gauls put
 it.  At any rate, John the Rabbi's son has been taken away and the
 soldiers are gone, and the errant jug of wine has been left behind.

>take wine
 Taken.

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a guilty

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
 preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the
 south.  In the northeast corner, the door to the garden stands wide
 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the
 west is the winery.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Success!  Well, assuming there actually is enough wine in the jug to
 hold off everyone's thirst until Martha and Amos get back.  How much
 wine is there in the jug, anyway?

>look in jub
 You can't see any such thing.

>look in jug
 The missing wine jug!  Unfortunately, it appears to contain nothing but
 water.

 You look up from your inspection of the wine jug in time to see Martha
 and Amos bustle into the kitchen.  You can tell from the looks on their
 faces that their mission has not been a success.  "The only merchant
 still in the market was a man selling lamp oil," Martha tells you, "he
 said he'd gotten a very last-minute order for six jars of the stuff,
 and was hoping there'd be more to come."  She sighs and glances at the
 wine jug.  "At least you've been successful.  If we water it down a
 little...."

 You confess that, as far as you know, watering down the wine is not
 going to be an issue.  Martha groans.  "I'll go tell Clopas," she says,
 "and see if I can distract the other guests somehow.  I don't know what
 else I can do."  Taking a deep breath, she marches out into the
 courtyard like a brave little Maccabean.

 Amos, who really should have been the one to inform Clopas, fidgets
 distractedly and finally pulls out a bowl of dough and proceeds with
 the baking for the morrow.

>ask anna about jesus
 "Oh, I know him, he's a friend of Lazarus's.  He's visited us at
 Bethany a couple of times."

 That was odd, now you think about it.  John didn't seem at all drunk,
 and he couldn't possibly have finished off the whole jug by himself.
 What actually happened to the wine?

>go south
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a red-headed
 shadow.

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go west
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a guilty

 By The West Wall
 The guests gather in clumps along the western periphery of the
 courtyard, under the glow of the hanging lamps.  Of particular note is
 the more scholarly crowd, clustered around the venerable old Rabbi.
 The rest of the courtyard is to east and southeast.

 The Rabbi is holding court with a crowd of would-be scholars, among
 whom you recognise Lazarus of Bethany.

 Mary of Bethany hovers on the periphery, largely ignored by the learned
 men.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>ask mary about jesus
 "Oh, he's dreadfully wise.  You've just got to listen a while and
 you'll understand."

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...his mother-in-law, would you
 believe it?  Of course he never quite forgave...."

 Lazarus of Bethany is rather too involved in the ongoing discussion
 with the Rabbi to pay much attention to what you have to say.

 Bridal Table
 The lamps are brightest here, where the main table overlooks the crush
 of wedding guests to the north and northwest.  The family's main
 sleeping quarters are beyond, to the south, but no-one has any business
 going there.

 The happy couple sit here, accepting congratulations and well wishes,
 and occasionally exchanging shy glances as if they'd only just met.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Clopas reaches for his cup just as a guest decides to offer his
 congratulations.  Clopas sets down his cup again, reluctantly, to do

 You notice Mary of Bethany in deep conversation with one of the guests.
 Or rather, the guest is talking and Mary is listening intently.  As the

 of location.

 back to the west wall.

 story to tell.  Martha says she spends too much time listening and not
 enough time doing but I think Martha does enough for everybody.
 Anyway, Mary says that all stories mean something if you take the time
 to listen properly, but a lot of the time she also wants a Rabbi or
 someone like that to come explain things to her.  I think she just
 likes having people tell her things."

>ask rabbi about story
 The would-be scholars notice the wine jug in your hands, and obligingly
 let you through to the Rabbi.

 The Rabbi has entirely too much to say about ... some esoteric,
 metaphysical aspect of whatever it is you were talking about, because
 you lost it somewhere between the philosophy and the theology.

>ask lazarus about jesus
 Lazarus of Bethany is rather too involved in the ongoing discussion
 with the Rabbi to pay much attention to what you have to say.

>ask rabbi about jesus
 "That boy is entirely to smart for his own good."

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...down on the Jordan.  Surprised
 to see him here at all, though of course he's disappeared...."

>ask rabbi about john
 "I take the trouble to pull the boy out of the wilderness and clean him
 up so he can be presentable, and what happens?  He disappears into the
 garden to sulk.  I know, I know, he's practically a prophet, but
 sometimes I think it would be better if he'd just been a nice little
 craftsman of some sort instead."

>tell rabbi about john
 "He what?" the old Rabbi stares at you, goggle-eyed, and throws up his
 hands in horror.  "Then what am I still here talking theology for?
 Shoo, get out of the way, I got to go do something about my boy.  You,
 Joshua, you're in charge!  The rest of you, stay out of trouble!"

 Old Zechariah hustles out of the house with all the speed his old bones
 can muster, leaving his former entourage to murmur among themselves at
 this turn of events.

>ask lazarus about jesus
 "Joshua's one of my best friends.  I like to think that I'm like
 Jonathan to his David."

>lazarus, invite jesus
 It seems unlikely that you could get much help there, and anyway it's
 really not your place to intrude.

>ask lazarus for jesus
 (Lazarus of Bethany first taking Joshua)
 Lazarus of Bethany has better things to do.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...and I'll be writing to
 Theophilus about that, naturally.  He'll be interested to hear...."

>examine jesus
 You don't know the guy very well.  Most of the guests are relative
 strangers, and this one is stranger than most: he's supposed to be a
 carpenter, or so you've heard, but apparently he was already teaching
 the priests and the Levites their own craft when he was ten.  Which
 makes you kind of glad that you didn't know him way back then.

>ask joshua about wine
 "All right, maybe I did have something to do with that.  I'm just
 looking out for my brother and his promises here."  You tell Joshua how
 dry the party is getting, but he only shrugs.  "Not my problem, really.
 Clopas doesn't really need any more wine to have a good party, does
 he?"

>ask joshua about water
 (Clean water)
 Joshua doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

>ask joshua for wine
 (Joshua first taking the wine jug)
 Joshua has better things to do.

 Anna leans in close to you and says, "I was wondering, do you think
 maybe Joshua would help if someone else asked him to, sir?  Mary says
 sometimes that Martha would get a lot more help in the kitchen if she
 wouldn't nag so -- not that you were nagging at all, sir, but I think
 sometimes it matters who is doing the asking."

>lazarus, ask joshua for wine
 Lazarus of Bethany has better things to do.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...such a temper.  Their mother's
 ambitious, though, and won't rest until...."

 should."

>examine amos
 Amos is tall, dark and lanky; there's a fair bit of Ethiopian and
 Egyptian in his blood.  He's been appointed head steward for the
 wedding, though you know that his first love is really the bakery.  He
 has this idea for tiny little bite-sized matzah that he claims are
 going to make him famous one of these days, once he perfects the
 recipe.

>ask amos about joshua
 Amos doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

>ask amos about food
 "Well, that part went wonderfully.  But I guess we should have paid
 more attention to the wine, eh?  At least the honeyed locusts appear to
 be gone, even if making up that dish has left us with more leftover
 honey than I know what to do with."

>ask amos about honey
 "Hmm ... that could work, I suppose," says Amos.

 Before long, Amos has filled up a tray with honey-flavoured bikkie
 dough ready for the oven.

>examine dough
 Amos always resorts to baking when he's troubled by something or other.
 Lately, his recipes seem to taste better (to you, anyway) before
 they're baked than after; quite fortunately Amos never begrudges you a
 sample of his experiments.

>ask amos about dough
 "I'll get this recipe right one of these days.  So if you have any
 suggestions as to what I can put in this, go ahead and tell me about
 them."

 and deposits its contents into the oven, then goes back to mixing up
 another batch of dough.

 Winery
 This is where the family keeps the wine and the olive oil.  It is a
 cool, windowless room; the kitchen proper is up some steps to the east.

 A rickety set of shelves stands against one wall.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Anna takes a step back and points up to the top of the shelves.  "Look,
 there's a jug up there!  Maybe there's some wine in it!"  You tell her
 not to be silly, you know for a fact.... but Anna's already begun
 clambering up the front of the shelves.  As might be expected, the
 shelves creak alarmingly and begin to sway forward as Anna reaches the
 top....

>get anna
 You snatch Little Anna away from the toppling shelves, and not a moment
 too soon.  The shelves and their precious contents smash into the floor
 and shatter into pieces.  Clopas will have your head in the morning,
 assuming he's not too hungover then (fat chance of that, all things
 considered) but in the meantime, Anna just stares wide-eyed at the mess
 she's caused.  "Ooh," she says, "I guess I shan't be trying that
 again...."


 Amos pops his head into the winery, takes one good look at the mess,
 then rubs his head and returns to his baking, muttering that he sees
 nothing and knows nothing.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
 preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the
 south.  In the northeast corner, the door to the garden stands wide
 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the
 west is the winery.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna and Amos here.

>go northeast
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like an Egyptian
 plague.

 Garden
 This rather large garden supplements the family's table with a few
 fruits and vegetables throughout the year.  Currently, it's about the
 only peaceful place on the property.  The kitchen is back to the
 southwest, and a passage leads south to the main entryway.  There is a
 stand of fig trees off to the northwest.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go northwest
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost

 Among The Figs
 This is about as far from the maddening crowd as you can get, without
 actually leaving the house.  The fig trees provide shade in the
 daytime, and the air is pleasantly cool; this time of the evening,
 though, it's rather darker and more shadowy than you care for.  The
 garden itself is to the southeast.

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 This oddly-shaped room is the house's main entryway.  The street is out

 The guests gather in clumps along the western periphery of the
 courtyard, under the glow of the hanging lamps.  Of particular note is
 the more scholarly crowd, milling about restlessly since the departure
 of the Rabbi.  The rest of the courtyard is to east and southeast.

 Mary of Bethany hovers on the periphery, largely ignored by the learned
 men.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna, Joshua and Lazarus of Bethany
 here.

>examine mary
 It seems like every woman is named Mary these days, but this particular
 Mary is an odd one.  She can usually be found hanging about wherever
 there are learned men having learned discourse; and they say she wants
 to be a female Rabbi.  As if.

>listen to rabbi
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine lazarus
 Lazarus of Bethany is a pale, somewhat sickly-looking fellow who was
 invited along with his sisters Mary and Martha.  Martha fusses over him
 something awful, and you suspect that he brought Little Anna into his
 household just to divert some of Martha's attention away from himself.

 "That Mary is a lovely lady, though I think she's happiest when she's
 working in the garden.  I hear she has quite the charming little plot,
 all lined with cockle shells and...."  Lazarus pauses in uncertainty.
 "Wait, that was a different Mary.  Anyway, She'll make a fine wife and
 mother, I'm sure.  Your master is to be congratulated."

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...rhubarb.  Rhubarb rhubarb
 rhubarb.  Rhubarb...?"

 "Clopas is a fine fellow, and to be congratulated on his good fortune.
 Although I gather he's still busy being congratulated, or else he'd be

 a nice, respectable girl and settle down.  She says he lives out in the
 wilderness and eats honey and locusts every day, which can't be
 healthy, but I guess he must like it or he wouldn't do it.  Or maybe

 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...wagon driven by a pack of
 drunken scoundrels.  She was barely more than...."

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost

 The guests gather in clumps along the western periphery of the
 courtyard, under the glow of the hanging lamps.  Of particular note is
 the more scholarly crowd, milling about restlessly since the departure
 of the Rabbi.  The rest of the courtyard is to east and southeast.

 Mary of Bethany hovers on the periphery, largely ignored by the learned
 men.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna, Joshua and Lazarus of Bethany
 here.

>tell lazarus about mariner
 It seems unlikely that you could get much help there, and anyway it's
 really not your place to intrude.

>ask lazarus about mariner
 Lazarus of Bethany doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...walked straight up to the high
 priest without glancing back.  They say this means...."

 Er, maybe it would be best if you don't do that.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...of course no-one likes a
 tax-collector, but what can you do?  At least he's...."

>mary, follow me
 Mary doesn't seem particularly interested in moving away from here.

>tell story to mary
 You don't actually know how that convoluted mess works out.

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...had this dream about the
 butcher's late wife, so they called off the wedding...."

>go north
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a guilty
 conscience.

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
 preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the
 south.  In the northeast corner, the door to the garden stands wide
 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the
 west is the winery.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna and Amos here.

>examine dough
 Amos always resorts to baking when he's troubled by something or other.
 Lately, his recipes seem to taste better (to you, anyway) before
 they're baked than after; quite fortunately Amos never begrudges you a
 sample of his experiments.

>examine table
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine counter

>ask amos about dough
 "I'll get this recipe right one of these days.  So if you have any
 suggestions as to what I can put in this, go ahead and tell me about
 them."

>ask amos about recipe
 Amos spends a minute or so nattering on about the finer points of his
 experiments.  "But it's still missing something, I think."

>ask amos about nutmeg
 Amos doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

>ask amos about honey
 "Hmm ... I suppose I could make up another batch with that," says Amos.

 Before long, Amos has filled up a tray with honey-flavoured bikkie
 dough ready for the oven.

>examine tray
 Amos calls them "bakies" or "bikkies" (Hebrew unclear - SD) because
 they're supposed to be baked.  These are less than half-baked, being
 raw, but look no less delicious and full of honey-flavoured goodness.

>give tray to lazarus
 Lazarus of Bethany doesn't seem interested.

>give tray to joshua
 Joshua's eyes light up as he takes a bikkie and breaks it into four
 quarters.  "Thanks," he says, after muttering a quick blessing over the
 bikkie quarters and popping one into his mouth.  "I love these things."

>ask joshua for wine
 (Joshua first taking the wine jug)
 Joshua has better things to do.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...rhubarb.  Rhubarb rhubarb
 rhubarb.  Rhubarb...?"

>ask joshua about wine
 You tell Joshua how dry the party is getting, but he only shrugs.  "Not
 my problem, really.  Clopas doesn't really need any more wine to have a
 good party, does he?"

 Bridal Table
 The lamps are brightest here, where the main table overlooks the crush
 of wedding guests to the north and northwest.  The family's main
 sleeping quarters are beyond, to the south, but no-one has any business
 going there.

 The happy couple sit here, accepting congratulations and well wishes,
 and occasionally exchanging shy glances as if they'd only just met.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Clopas reaches for his cup just as a guest decides to offer her

 the polite thing and exchange some small talk with the guest.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...such a temper.  Their mother's
 ambitious, though, and won't rest until...."

 Entryway
 This oddly-shaped room is the house's main entryway.  The street is out
 to the east, and the courtyard is to the southwest.  In addition, a
 narrow passage leads north to an enclosed garden.

 Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an
 alcove, situated just so, to inconvenience any invading evil spirits.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Anna finally unsticks all the bikkie dough from her teeth, and
 unfortunately returns to her chatterbox ways.

>go east
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like an Egyptian
 plague.

 Out On The Street
 The road to town stretches off to the south, and the house is back to
 the west.  The dust has finally settled from the arrival of guests,
 and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is
 blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
 across the street to the east.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna, a bridesmaid and an ancient mariner
 here.

 "There was this albatross ... did I mention the albatross?"

 "Yes," says the bridesmaid, barely concealing a yawn, "yes you did."

 "Well, there was this albatross, see, and I thought...."

>give tray to mariner
 The ancient mariner absently takes a bikkie and begins munching on it.
 But when he tries to continue his story, the sticky bikkie dough proves
 too much for his old jaws, and he is reduced to silence.  The
 bridesmaid seizes her chance.  She leaps to her feet, thanks the
 mariner very nicely for sharing his story with her, and hurries into
 the house.  The mariner stares sadly after her, then helps himself to
 another bikkie and hobbles off down the street.

 "Thank you," says the bridesmaid, "I didn't think the old man would
 ever stop talking, and somehow I just couldn't stop listening to him.
 It's not that his story was all that long and terrible; it's actually
 not bad, once you've put the pieces together.  But he would insist on
 jumping around at random, and repeating some bits over and over."  She
 sighs and turns to enter the courtyard.  "Well, ask me about the story
 sometime, if you want to know what it was all about, and I'll tell it
 to you so that it makes sense.  For now, I'm just going to go and enjoy
 what's left of the party."

 "There was a ship...." the bridesmaid describes the voyage of the
 mariner's ship, which seems mundane enough.  "But that's only the
 beginning," she says.

 The bridesmaid continues the story, describing a curse which befalls
 the mariner and his crew.

>again
 The bridesmaid continues the story, describing the nightmarish fate of
 the mariner's crew and the terrible visions that plagued him.

 inexplicably, when he stops to admire some sea creatures.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...must be starving!  So I left a

 immediately.

 "That sounds familiar," she says, giving you her full attention.

 mariner outside tells?  If you've got it all organised, I'd like to
 hear it."

 Mary shudders as you describe the curse that befell the mariner's crew.
 "How terrible!  Should all the people suffer for the sin of one man?"

>again
 "What a terrible story!"  Mary seems to be hanging on to your every
 word, nonetheless.

>again
 "And is that how it ends, with the old mariner turning his gaze away
 from his suffering to these sea snakes?  But why would the Lord relent
 for something like that?"  Mary looks to you for the moral of the
 story.

 mean, I hear that a lot of awful things happen at sea, that's why I'm
 glad I'm not from the tribe of Zebulun.  Lazarus told me all about
 Jacob's blessing on Zebulun, sir.  They're supposed to be great
 sailors, and one imagines that it would be terribly romantic, to be out
 on the sea with water all around and the sky arching across overhead,
 but after listening to a bit of the old mariner's story, I think I'd
 much rather stay on land."

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like an Egyptian

 Out On The Street
 The road to town stretches off to the south, and the house is back to
 the west.  The dust has finally settled from the arrival of guests,
 and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is
 blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
 across the street to the east.

 There are six large jars in the alcove, placed there so the guests may
 wash the dust from their feet after the long journey to get here.  All
 that splashing about has left each of them about half-full.

>examine bucket
 This is the bucket used to carry water from the village well to the
 house.  It's larger than average, but at least that means not having to
 make quite so many trips back and forth when filling up all those jars
 in the entryway.  Currently, the bucket is empty.

>pour water into bucket
 You can't see any such thing.

 No sense in making a mess here, especially since you're the one who'll

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You can see the bridesmaid, the one you rescued from the ancient
 mariner, mingling with the guests.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go west
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a guilty
 conscience.

 By The West Wall
 The guests gather in clumps along the western periphery of the
 courtyard, under the glow of the hanging lamps.  Of particular note is
 the more scholarly crowd, milling about restlessly since the departure
 of the Rabbi.  The rest of the courtyard is to east and southeast.

 Mary of Bethany hovers on the periphery, largely ignored by the learned
 men.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna, Joshua and Lazarus of Bethany
 here.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...saved the bridge, though if you
 ask me he should never have wandered off in the first place...."

>examine feet
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine joshua
 You don't know the guy very well.  Most of the guests are relative
 strangers, and this one is stranger than most: he's supposed to be a
 carpenter, or so you've heard, but apparently he was already teaching
 the priests and the Levites their own craft when he was ten.  Which
 makes you kind of glad that you didn't know him way back then.

>ask joshua about feet
 Joshua doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...wouldn't believe a word of it.
 So I said to Thomas, I said...."

>ask joshua about baptism
 Joshua doesn't seem to have much to say about that.

>joshua, baptize me
 Joshua doesn't seem to have anything to add to what you tell him.

 You might get further if you tried either asking or telling Joshua
 about something specific.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...had this dream about the
 butcher's late wife, so they called off the wedding...."

 You don't want to hear that long rigmarole again.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...of course no-one likes a
 tax-collector, but what can you do?  At least he's...."

>tell story to mary
 Mary frowns.  "I hope you know a little more about it than you did the
 last time."  She listens as you quickly go over the initial part of the
 story again.

>tell story to mary
 You repeat the part about the curse that befell the mariner's crew.
 Mary nods thoughtfully, still searching your words for any grain of
 meaning she might have missed the first time around.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...thankfully managed to work
 around their language differences and got the medicine for...."

>tell story to mary
 "Perhaps we should skip over the plagues, if there is nothing
 significant about them."

>tell story to mary
 "But why would the Lord relent for something like that?"  Mary looks to
 you for the moral of the story.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...saved the bridge, though if you
 ask me he should never have wandered off in the first place...."

>tell story to mary
 "But why would the Lord relent for something like that?"  Mary looks to
 you for the moral of the story.

 Mary presses you for further details or possibly an explanation for the
 more inexplicable aspects of the story, but you have to confess that
 you cannot add to what you have told her.  Disappointed, she returns to
 the Rabbi and his entourage for more erudite discourse.

>ask bridesmaid about mary
 Who do you mean, the bride, Mary of Bethany or Mary of Nazareth?

>nazareth
 "A relative of your master's, I think?  I think I met her earlier in
 the evening ... a quiet woman, very dignified.  You've got to admire a
 woman who can keep calm in the midst of wedding preparations."

>ask bridesmaid about mariner
 The bridesmaid makes a face.  "That man just would not shut up.  It
 would be one thing if he could tell his story straight, but he would
 insist on messing it all up.  I could tell it better than he does; I
 mean, I've heard it at least five times over by now, backwards,
 forwards and sideways."

>ask bridesmaid about john
 "Rabbi Zechariah's son."  She smirks a little.  "I don't think there's
 anyone who doesn't know about his preaching out on the Jordan.  I can't
 imagine what his father must think."

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...looking for a map of Lutetia and

 "Wasn't he one of the potential candidates for the position of High
 Priest?  I hear his health isn't very good."

>examine bridesmaid
 You recognise her as one of the bridesmaids who'd been arranged for the
 wedding.  She wasn't actually at the wedding, though: Clopas was
 running a little late, and a bunch of the bridesmaids, including this
 one, had to run off to the market to replenish the oil in their lamps
 when he finally arrived.  These bridesmaids missed the wedding
 altogether as a result, and you thought they'd all gone home.
 Apparently one of them, at least, is still hanging around.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...a pound of flesh, of all things,
 but then the other gentile's wife pointed out that...."

 You think you detect a hint of bitterness in the bridesmaid's tone as
 she says, "Mary?  She's quite radiant tonight, isn't she?"

 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like an Egyptian

 Bridal Table
 The lamps are brightest here, where the main table overlooks the crush
 of wedding guests to the north and northwest.  The family's main
 sleeping quarters are beyond, to the south, but no-one has any business
 going there.

 The happy couple sit here, accepting congratulations and well wishes,
 and occasionally exchanging shy glances as if they'd only just met.

 You can also see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Mary, the bride, is about to take a sip from her cup when a guest comes
 up to offer her congratulations.  Mary puts down her cup to thank the
 guest and promptly forgets about it.

>examine mary
 Mary, the bride, looks absolutely radiant, if a little thirsty.  She's
 been so busy receiving everyone's congratulations that she hasn't been
 able to take more than a sip from the cup that Amos poured for her,
 hours ago.

>examine mary of nazareth
 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the bride.

 You don't really want to draw any attention to that, under the

 the crowd are named Mary, and I can point them out, too."

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...must be starving!  So I left a
 platter of her favourite sweetmeats...."

>ask lazarus about mary of nazareth
 "Joshua's mother?  We actually weren't sure if she would come, you
 know.  But Martha convinced her to put away her widow's weeds and put
 on a nice, blue dress, and she's somewhere about."

 Putting together all the information you've gathered, you think you
 could probably now pick the right Mary out of the crowd.

>examine guests
 Following the clues you've gathered, you manage to identify one of the
 women hovering around the courtyard as Mary of Nazareth, mother of
 Joshua.

 means that, too, and yet the words seem to trouble her.

 You hear the guests chattering on: "...a pound of flesh, of all things,
 but then the other gentile's wife pointed out that...."

>tell mary about wine
 You tell Mary of Nazareth how you've almost run out of wine and how it
 has been suggested that her son might be able to help but that he
 doesn't seem interested in doing so.  "Let me have a word with him,"
 she says.

 Mary pulls her son aside and repeats to him what you've told her about
 the wine shortage.  He glances at you and tells her what he told you,
 that it's really not his problem, adding a cryptic phrase, that his
 "hour has not yet come."

 Mary seems unperturbed.  She simply turns to you and says, "do whatever
 he tells you to."

 You glance over to Joshua.  For a moment it looks like you're back
 where you began, and then he quietly says to you: "All right.  You know
 those large water jars in the entryway alcove?  Fill them all with
 water, up to the brim."

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
 preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the
 south.  In the northeast corner, the door to the garden stands wide
 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the

 and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is
 blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
 across the street to the east.

 You pour the water into one of the jars.  It isn't quite full to the
 top, and there are five more to go....

 There's really no need to describe the tedious task of refilling the
 jars of water.  Suffice it to say that you make several trips to and
 from the well, with Little Anna constantly hounding at your heels.  At
 last, you have five of the jars filled to the brim; one more bucket of
 water, and you should be done....

>take bucket
 Before you can take the bucket, Little Anna interferes.  "You've
 carried that bucket back and forth nearly twenty times already, sir,
 and you really must be exhausted!  Here, I can help, it's only a bucket
 after all!"  She grabs the bucket by the handle and endeavours to haul
 it up herself.  It's obviously heavier than she expects -- you could
 have told her that -- and she leans back against the side of the well
 for leverage...

 She does, in fact, manage to lift the bucket of water off the ground.

 And then she overbalances and falls backwards, with the bucket, into
 the well; she screams in fright, lets go of the bucket, and for a
 split-second -- time seems to slow down -- both girl and bucket are
 teetering on the lip of well.  Instinctively, you....

>grab anna
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>take anna
 You reach instinctively for Anna, but hesitate for a split-second.
 Sure, she's only an orphan and she's been nothing but a pest, but ...
 on the other hand, Mary of Nazareth did say to do exactly what Joshua
 told you, and Joshua -- who must be some sort of prophet along the
 lines of Elijah or Elisha if John is to be believed -- said to fill the
 jars to the brim, and if you lose the bucket.... What do you do?

>take anna
 You catch hold of Anna's arm as she goes over the edge, and pull her
 back to safety.  For a moment, you both sit there, a little shocked at
 what's happened.  "Thank you," Anna says, weakly.  "I ... I'm sorry
 about the bucket.  Maybe Joshua won't mind that one of the jars isn't
 quite full?"

   a tray of bikkies
   a wine jug

>open well
 (the village well)
 You heave the wooden cover aside.

>fill jug
 If it's not wine, it doesn't belong in the jug.

>close well
 (the village well)
 You carefully reposition the cover over the well.

>go west
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like the too-long hem
 of an over-sized robe.

 Out On The Street
 The road to town stretches off to the south, and the house is back to
 the west.  The dust has finally settled from the arrival of guests,
 and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is
 blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
 across the street to the east.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

>go west
 Rather annoyingly, Anna trails along behind you like a little lost
 puppy.

 Entryway
 This oddly-shaped room is the house's main entryway.  The street is out
 to the east, and the courtyard is to the southwest.  In addition, a
 narrow passage leads north to an enclosed garden.

 Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an
 alcove, situated just so, to inconvenience any invading evil spirits.

 You can see Little Orphan Anna here.

 Joshua strolls into the entryway.  "Ah, I see the jars all filled up?"

 You shake your head and mumble something about losing the bucket, as
 Little Anna begins a long-winded account of what happened at the well.
 Joshua looks a little bemused, and gestures for you both to settle
 down.  "Please," he says, "how much of a stickler do you think I am,
 over these trivialities?"  Producing a ladle which he must have swiped
 from the kitchen while you were busy hauling water, he draws out a bit
 of the water from the nearest jar and hands the ladle to you.  "Here,
 let Amos have a taste of this and see what he thinks."

 Thankfully, Little Anna seems to have decided she can be of more "use"
 pleading your case to Joshua than following you around.

>go north

 Garden
 This rather large garden supplements the family's table with a few
 fruits and vegetables throughout the year.  Currently, it's about the
 only peaceful place on the property.  The kitchen is back to the
 southwest, and a passage leads south to the main entryway.  There is a
 stand of fig trees off to the northwest.

>go southwest

 Kitchen
 The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
 preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the
 south.  In the northeast corner, the door to the garden stands wide
 open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the
 west is the winery.

 You can see Amos here.

>give ladle to amos
 You hand the ladle over to Amos, uncomfortably aware that you've got to
 be playing part of a very sick joke here.  Amos, all unaware and
 curious, takes a sip.  His brow shoots up and, amazingly, he takes
 another sip.  Before you know it, he's gone and drunk down half the
 ladle.  "Micah," he gasps, incredulous, "where'd you get this?  This is
 the good stuff ... Clopas has been holding out on us!"

 What?  Amos offers the ladle to you, and you hesitantly take a sip ...
 and it is the best wine you've ever been lucky enough to taste.  "It's
 perfect," Amos says exultantly, "the aroma!  The bouquet!  Even the way
 it sits at the bottom of the ladle, weighting it in a way that
 demonstrates the absolute perfection of its design!  I must tell
 Clopas!"  And with that, Amos hurries off.

>go south
 You'd better go see about the rest of those jars of ... water?  Wine?
 Whatever it is, you've got to go see.

 Courtyard
 The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
 guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
 in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
 bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
 that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
 bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
 curtain.

 You can see the bridesmaid, the one you rescued from the ancient
 mariner, mingling with the guests.

 You can also see Mary of Nazareth here.

 You can see a bit of excitement off to the south, where Amos is waxing
 lyrical over the sheer perfection of the wine.  A job well done, you
 think, smiling in satisfaction.  You don't notice Joshua until he is
 right behind you.  "Micah?" he says, and it occurs to you that you
 never told him your name.  "Micah, where is John ben Zechariah?"

 "I don't know ... I'm not his keeper," you stammer, recognising only
 too late the parallel with Cain's answer to a similar question about
 Abel.

 There is an uncomfortable pause.  Then Joshua says, "John would have
 been arrested sooner or later, that is true.  But all the same ... you
 disappoint me, Micah."

 He pauses, waiting for you to respond, but all you can do is hang your
 head in shame.  Sighing, Joshua turns to join the feast.

 Three years later...

 You've been out of Clopas's service for a while now.  After he found
 out that you'd let a bunch of soldiers -- unclean soldiers, Herod's
 soldiers -- into his house, there wasn't much possibility of you
 staying with him.  Since then, you've rattled from master to master,
 and the rise of Joshua's fame has only served to remind you of your
 guilt over those events at Clopas's wedding.

 Joshua was executed a few days ago; you know that Clopas had high hopes
 for the man, so he must be quite devastated at this turn of events.  It
 is while musing over this that you catch sight, out of the corner of
 your eye, of a flash of red hair vanishing behind the lone tree in the
 middle of the field.  For a moment, you think, could it be Little Anna?
 Before you know it, you find yourself in the middle of the field, under
 the tree.  Little Anna is nowhere in sight.

 The Potter's Field
 This field isn't much to look at.  There's a tall tree, more dead than
 alive; there are some rocks and a lot of clay.  The road is off to the
 south, and a small stream is to the west.

>examine clay
 Rocks and clay, thick and muddy and wonderful if you were a potter,
 which you aren't.

>examine tree
 More dead than alive, the tree looks like dead hand clawing at the sky.

 You hear a nasty snapping sound from above, and duck aside just in
 time.  A red-headed man lands on the rocks right beside you with a
 sound you'd rather not ever hear again.  An attempted suicide, if the
 broken noose about his neck is anything to go by.  With a start, you
 recognise him as Judas Iscariot, one of Joshua's friends.  Has Joshua's
 execution really affected him that badly?

>examine judas
 You don't know all of Joshua's particular group of friends, but Judas
 always stood out because of his red hair.  As you peer closely at him,
 his eyelids flutter open.  He's still alive!  Although, judging by the
 fall, he's not likely to be alive for much longer.

 Judas's voice is a hoarse whisper.  "Water.  Please."

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>go south
 This is all really too much.  Maybe it's best if you just get as far
 away from here as you can, as quickly as you can.

 By The Stream
 The grasses grow a little higher here, and nearly hide a small stream
 that trickles past on its way to greener pastures.  The field is back
 to the east; everywhere else is unfamiliar territory.

>get water
 You scoop up a bit of water in your hands.  It begins to trickle out
 between your fingers.

>go east

 The Potter's Field
 This field isn't much to look at.  There's a tall tree, more dead than
 alive; there are some rocks and a lot of clay.  The road is off to the
 south, and a small stream is to the west.

 Judas lies sprawled among the rocks.

>give water to judas
 Judas takes a sip and closes his eyes.  He is very still, and for a
 moment you think he's dead, and then you hear him go on: "I have
 sinned.  My teacher has been executed by crucifixion ... I betrayed him
 ... with a kiss, I betrayed him...."

 You draw back, startled, remembering your own experience with John ben
 Zechariah and Herod's soldiers.  Judas doesn't notice.  "Is there
 forgiveness?  I should have sought forgiveness ... they would not have
 forgiven me ... I don't know that ... I didn't dare ... I was afraid
 ... and so I damn myself...."

 Suddenly, his eyes snap open, and he looks straight at you.  "Blessed
 are the merciful," he says, a little louder than you would have thought
 possible, "they shall have mercy shown upon them."  And then he really
 is gone.

>search judas
 He's dead.  There's nothing more you can do for him.

>bury judas
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look
 The Potter's Field
 This field isn't much to look at.  There's a tall tree, more dead than
 alive; there are some rocks and a lot of clay.  The road is off to the
 south, and a small stream is to the west.

 Judas lies sprawled among the rocks.

>examine rocks
 Rocks and clay, thick and muddy and wonderful if you were a potter,
 which you aren't.

>put rocks on judas
 (first taking the clay)

 That's hardly portable.
 You need to be holding the clay before you can put it on top of
 something else.

>examine clay
 Rocks and clay, thick and muddy and wonderful if you were a potter,
 which you aren't.

>go south
 You cannot leave the scene fast enough.  There's no way you're going to
 end up the same way, you tell yourself.  What was it he said?  He
 didn't dare ask for forgiveness?  You stop at the side of the road and
 look down towards Jerusalem.  Neither John nor his father are still
 among the living, but there's Joshua's mother ... his closest friends,
 who'll want to know of Judas's fate ... and Clopas usually has some
 business in Emmaus at this time of the year, you might be able to catch
 him there.... It's time to get some things off your chest.
