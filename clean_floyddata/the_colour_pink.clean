 You are on an abandoned planet again. Not content with almost killing
 you the last time, the Captain has delegated you again to investigate
 another out-of-contact colony. Apparently you impressed him with your
 survival instincts, by evading thousands of insect-like creatures
 before the ship finally sent down enough people to wipe them out.
 Maybe your job description should just be renamed as the Expendable
 Explorer. Unfortunately, you have no choice but to obey the Captain's
 orders.

 An hour ago you were sent down into a thick jungle. When you made
 contact with the ship you found out that they had missed the clearing
 where you were supposed to land. The intervening hour was spent
 cutting through the energetic plant-life until you finally reached
 your destination.

 It is time to start your investigation. One strange fact that you have
 already noticed is that there was no sign of any animals in the
 jungle.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southeast corner of ruins</span>
 This clearing used to be the site of a house, where a team of
 scientists, who were studying the planet, lived. This is no longer the
 case, as the house has burned down. The fire is probably the reason
 for the colony being out of contact, but you are not sure it is the
 whole reason, as something does not feel right here. The ashes from
 the house cover the ground, along with various twisted metal pieces.
 Weeds are popping up everywhere, as the jungle reclaims the area. The
 clearing, and ruins, continues to the north and west.

>examine me


 You look good in your new black all-purpose uniform. It's not
 surprising, as you always look good in your opinion. And as you keep
 telling yourself, your opinion is the only opinion that matters.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a backpack (being worn and closed)

>open backpack


 You open the backpack, revealing five rations, a communicator and an
 utility tool.

>examine tool


 This thin cylinder can turn into several useful tools by turning the
 dial on the end.

>examine dial


 This dial changes the form of the utility tool.

>read tool


 You cannot read that.

>turn dial


 (first taking the utility tool)
 You turn the dial and the utility tool turns into a shovel.

>again


 You turn the dial and the shovel turns into a scythe.

 The remains of the house litter the area.

>examine ashes


 The ashes from the burned down house are all over the ground in this
 clearing.

>search ashes


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine metal


 The metal from the house is now unrecognisable from its original form.

>examine weeds


 There are weeds all around the area, growing in the remains of the
 house and clearing.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northeast corner of ruins</span>
 The ashes from the house only cover a small segment of this corner.
 Weeds and dirt patches cover most of the ground instead, with what
 looks like the remains of a garden. There is nothing left to tell what
 was growing here before the fire, as any crops have completely
 disappeared. Maybe the scientists were not very good gardeners, and
 there were no crops. However, you think that this is unlikely, as the
 crops they use on new colonies are virtually unkillable. The clearing,
 and ruins, continues to the south and west.

 An abandoned metal table on wheels in the garden looks in poor
 condition, but still useable.

>examine table


 This metal table is not in good condition, as the top looks heavily
 dented and one of the wheels is missing. However, it has survived far
 more intact than anything else. It even looks like it can still be
 pushed around.

>look under table


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine garden


 The dirt patches look like they used to be a garden before the weeds
 took over.

>turn dial


 You turn the dial and the utility tool turns into a shovel.

>dig garden


 You do not find anything useful.

>exits


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northwest corner of ruins</span>
 A large tree dominates this section of the clearing, with a low
 hanging, yet out of reach, branch above where the house used to be. It
 would have been just above the roof of a one-storey section of the
 house. However, it is now only above ashes. This tree must be tough
 and strong to have survived the chemical process used to create a
 clearing. The chemicals are supposed to clear everything in
 preparation for the houses and gardens of any colonists. The clearing,
 and ruins, continues to the south and east.

 On the branch you see a nest. This is the first sign of any animal
 life that you have seen. You wonder if it is empty like everywhere
 else.

>examine nest


 There must have been a bird here at some stage, but not anymore. It is
 at least a sign of animal life and maybe the nest is not empty.

>look in nest


 You find nothing of interest.

>take nest


 You can't reach the nest with your hands.

>examine tree


 This tree is separate from the jungle at the moment, but will probably
 be integrated back in soon. A thick branch hangs over where the house
 used to be.

>examine branch


 This thick low hanging branch is right over where the house used to
 be. There is a nest on the branch.

>climb tree


 Unfortunately, there are no obvious handholds and you are not a good
 climber.

 You push the nest off the branch with the shovel. It quickly falls
 down and smashes onto the ground. You get off the table and look
 inside the remains to find a pink egg, which you take. As you look at
 the egg, for some reason, you feel an overwhelming hunger coming over
 you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southwest corner of ruins</span>
 The ruins continue in this corner of the clearing. A puddle of leaking
 water has formed in a hole. It is probably where the water storage for
 the kitchen and bathroom was located. It has been policy for water to
 be brought in from off-planet, since an unfortunate incident with an
 alien species that mainly consisted of water. The wetness of the area
 seems to have protected the wood a little better here than in the
 other corners, with a few portions lying on the ground. The clearing,
 and ruins, continues to the north and east.

 In the remains you see a surprisingly whole piece of wood.

>examine wood


 (the piece of wood)
 This piece of wood is damp, but it has a decent size and weight behind
 it. It is several feet long and almost looks like a shelf.

>take it


 Taken.

 You cannot stop your sudden urge to eat the egg for much longer.

>examine hole


 The pool of water in the hole is almost black from the ashes that have
 been washed into it.

>search water


 You find nothing of interest.

>eat egg


 You break open the egg and quickly eat its contents. You are not sure
 what just possessed you, but you somehow knew that you had to eat the
 egg. Suddenly you feel strange and fall to the ground.







 When you finally wake up the world looks different. You soon realise
 what has happened, but not how.

 YOU HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY PINKNESS!




 (Press a key)



 The world has gone pink. Absolutely everything is coloured with
 varying shades of pink. Looking down this even includes yourself. This
 cannot be good.

 In this corner, a puddle of leaking water has formed in a hole.
 Despite ashes from the ruins having been washed in, the water almost
 looks drinkable when it is coloured pink. However, it is probably only
 the colour that is different, so it is not a good idea to try. A few
 small portions of wood are lying in the pink ashes next to the pool.
 The clearing, and ruins, continues to the north and east.

 [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

>examine me


 You look strange, as you are now pink like everything else around
 here. Pink does not look good on you. It doesn't look good on anything
 else either to be honest. However, you don't appear to have a choice.

   a piece of wood
   a shovel
   a backpack (being worn and open)

 In this new world state the large tree is still the main feature of
 this corner, although it is now pink. So is the low hanging branch
 that the nest was previously on. With the tree being the same colour
 as the ground, it is difficult to tell where one starts and the other
 ends. It is the same for the jungle and the edge of the clearing. If
 you concentrate, you can see the difference in shading, but if you
 don't, it looks like the jungle has already swallowed up this area.
 The clearing, and ruins, continues to the south and east.

 A metal table on wheels is here.

 There is more to this location than before you ate the egg. It is not
 just that the ashes, ground, jungle and everywhere else is now
 coloured pink. It is the fact that there is a tunnel sloping
 downwards. You are sure that it wasn't there previously. You don't
 know where it came from, but tunnels do not just appear out of
 nowhere. However, there used to be more than one colour in the world,
 so you guess anything is possible here. The clearing, and ruins,
 continues to the north and west.

>go down


 As you walk down, the world shimmers and returns to normal colours.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southeast corner of laboratory</span>
 You are standing at the entrance to a laboratory. It looks like it has
 been regularly used, although not in the last few weeks. The
 laboratory has not escaped the destruction from above. The floor is
 cracked, with a long, thin hole leading deep into the earth. The crack
 extends to the north, but can be easily stepped over. A tunnel slopes
 upward back towards the surface. The laboratory continues to the north
 and west.

>examine hole


 Which do you mean, the crack or the tunnel?

>crack


 (the all-purpose uniform)
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 You cannot see the bottom of this hole, but luckily the crack is too
 thin for you to fall through.

>examine tunnel


 The tunnel entrance leads upwards.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northeast corner of laboratory</span>
 A large, rectangular machine takes up most of the space in this corner
 of the laboratory. It looks like it could be used to mix ingredients
 and make evil concoctions, or not-so-evil depending on the mood. There
 is a control panel on the machine's side, with a closed compartment on
 top. Unfortunately, there are no helpful labels to describe any
 functions. A crack in the floor extends to the south. The laboratory
 continues to the south and west.

>examine machine


 A closed compartment is visible on top of the mixing machine. The
 machine can be controlled by either a pink or yellow button situated
 on a control panel.

 This corner of the laboratory looks more like the mad scientist's lair
 that you were expecting from a hidden laboratory. There is a
 workbench, which is covered by various papers and unusual coloured
 potions. You can just imagine a mad scientist cackling as he or she
 mixed together potions in crazy experiments throughout the night. A
 strange device is attached to the workbench, and it has a cable
 sticking out of it. This corner is less damaged than the rest of the
 laboratory, which continues to the south and east.

>examine device


 This small electronic device is attached to the workbench. There is a
 screen on the top, with a red button sitting next to it. A cable
 sticks out of the back of the machine.

>examine screen


 The screen is blank at present.

>button


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine button


 (the communicator's button)
 This button activates the X7ACIO87 communication unit.

>examine red button


 The red button is on the device attached to the workbench.

>examine cable


 The cable sticks out from the device on the workbench. The other end
 is loose.

>look under workbench


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine workbench


 The top of the workbench is a mess, but unlike the rest of the
 laboratory, it probably is how it was left rather than being caused by
 the disaster. Within the mess are papers, scattered from one end of
 the workbench to the other, interspersed with the occasional potion.
 There is also an unusual device, which is built into the workbench.

>examine papers


 The papers on the workbench contain information on many different
 formulae, but none that explain your situation. However, you do notice
 references to other papers that you cannot find on the workbench.

>examine potions


 There is a range of brightly coloured liquids, kept in flasks, lying
 on the workbench. You have no idea what any of them contain, so they
 will probably not be much use.

 The papers on the workbench contain information on many different
 formulae, but none that explain your situation. However, you do notice

 on the screen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southwest corner of laboratory</span>
 It looks like the laboratory's owner is more of a reader than you, as
 there is a very large bookcase in this corner. The bookcase is
 currently empty, but the library is still here, with a high pile of
 books sitting on the floor in front of the bookcase. The books look
 like they could be hiding something. Either the owner was careless, or
 the disaster caused the books to be knocked off the shelves. The
 titles mainly suggest that the contents of the pile are too technical
 to be interesting. You suppose finding fictional books would be too
 much to ask for in a laboratory. The laboratory continues to the north
 and east.

>examine books


 The pile of books almost look like they are covering something. In
 this pile are scientific texts and research mainly concentrating on
 the areas of psychology, biology and chemistry. You do not have time
 to place these books back in the shelves, so they are going to have to
 stay on the floor for now.

>search books


 You move the books slightly to reveal a heavy metal chest.

>examine chest


 The metal chest looks very heavy and secure. It is closed, with no
 obvious way to open it, apart from a socket on the lid.

 This socket is on the lid of the chest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northeast corner of ruins</span>
 It looks like a garden should fill most of this corner, but there are
 only weeds where there should be crops. However, you have to look
 carefully to notice this, as the weeds are more indistinguishable from
 whatever should be in the garden when they are coloured pink.
 Everything is actually a lot more indistinguishable to be honest. It
 is difficult to tell the ashes from the dirt patches, with the
 clearing looking a lot less damaged when in pink. The clearing, and
 ruins, continues to the south and west.

 A diary is lying on the ground.

>take diary


 Taken.

>examine it


 This diary is bound within a pink cover and belongs to one of the
 scientists. Luckily, the text is in a dark shade of pink when compared
 to the background.

>read diary


 The diary belonged to one of the scientists, Dr. Mark Simmons. Most of
 the entries are filled with jargon and scientific data, which may be
 interesting to people back at the ship, but not to you. However, the
 last entry, which is dated several weeks ago, is different:



 ...I don't know why, but the world has suddenly become crazy.
 Everything was fine yesterday (apart from my usual complaint that with
 the increasing periods of absence for James, I have been forced away
 from my studies too much). However, today everyone and everything
 seems to have gone insane. At the moment I am hiding in the jungle
 away from the madness. I think I will go back soon though. No, I
 won't. Maybe. The only thing stopping me is this writing. I have to
 keep writing to stop the temptation. The need. No, it is not a need. I
 am stronger than this. Maybe if I write what I know, then it will
 satisfy the craving. Maybe I shouldn't though, as I need to forget.
 No, I can't forget or think of anything else. I need to figure out
 what is going on.

 What I know, my diary, is that it all started this morning. It started
 with Jane. She has been acting strangely in recent days, almost
 paranoid whenever anyone approaches her. I have been avoiding the
 issue, as this is not my specialty. If James had been there, he would
 have known what to do. He is always good with the psychological
 aspects. He couldn't have helped this morning. I have never seen
 anything like it before. Jane was coloured bright pink. Yes, bright
 pink. Maybe she was infected with some local disease. I don't know. It
 seems likely though, as I cannot think of any other explanation. She
 looked strange, but she looked beautiful, irresistible even. She has
 always been attractive, but even more so today. Right now, I can't
 explain how this is true. I only know that it is. She seemed in a
 daze, mumbling something about how the "PSYCHE" was the key. The key
 to what, I don't know.

 What happened next? I was walking over to treat her condition. Yes,
 treat her condition. That's why, I think. Anyway, one of the junior
 scientists, Simon, reached her first. He kissed her. He actually
 kissed her. And she did not just slap and reject him. I don't
 understand. Why wasn't it me? I saw Simon change before my eyes. There
 were ripples in the air, almost like the air was as thick as water.
 But it isn't. But it was. Simon turned pink as well. I saw ecstasy in
 his eyes. Or was it just a love of life. I don't know. I didn't stay.
 I'm ashamed to say that I ran. I shouldn't be too ashamed though, as
 it is the only reason I am here.

 I admit that I have gone back once. I saw everyone standing in a
 circle holding hands. They were all pink. All of them except me. And
 maybe James. I didn't see him there. They then just disappeared. They
 vanished and I don't know where. I noticed that the house was burning.
 Someone must have left something on. It was too late. It is still too
 late. Everyone is gone, and the pinkness has not disappeared. I
 noticed in the garden that the fruit had gone pink as well. There were
 pink native flies, which have blighted our crops, but now it did not
 seem to matter. Animals were moving in from all directions to eat. I
 feel no better than those animals at the moment.

 I can't go back, but I need food. And that food is the only food I
 know. Maybe it will be all right by now. I hope so. I'll just have a
 quick look...

 "ACCEPTED" flashes up on the screen. The chest then pops open, with
 the cable being pulled out by the lid's movement. Inside the chest you
 find some notes, a gold watch, a silver bracelet, a black potion and
 an iron nail. You take all of these items and glance through the
 notes.

 Reading through the notes, a few comments stick out:



 ...She doesn't like me. I don't understand why, but she doesn't like
 me. That has never happened to me before, and I will not allow it to
 happen now...

 ...I have developed a new project called "Eros". No one else knows
 about it and I need someplace secret so no one will find out about it
 in the future. Funding is not an issue, as being the leader of this
 settlement makes it easy to divert funds. The aim of this project is
 to shift reality. If Jane will not like me in this reality maybe I can
 shift us slightly to a reality where she will...

 ...With my previous research and a native substance called Kahrz, I
 have developed the love potion. It has some strange effects that I
 have discovered by trying it out on myself. The new reality looks
 strangely pink, but I don't need the new reality to be perfect, I only
 need it to work. Love does not seem to be the only emotion amplified.
 The perception of reality changes on any strong emotions. One
 advantage from having a shifted reality is that it has provided an
 excellent hiding spot for a laboratory to develop the potion without
 any distractions...

 ...I now have a machine to develop both the potion and the antidote.
 To generate the antidote I need to firstly add silver, iron, Vitamin
 X, Vitamin Y, Vitamin Z and Kahrz. The machine will remove any
 impurities from the mixture. After pressing the pink button again to
 mix the ingredients I open the machine for a second time with the
 yellow button and add some gold...

 ...The potion is still not perfect, but I am running out of time
 before I have no more Kahrz. I have decided to start the next stage. I
 administered the potion to Jane's drink this morning, and took some
 myself. She has to meet me very soon now, and I will see the results.
 I will make a new batch of the antidote and administer it after we are
 finished...

 ...I have a problem. I have collected some of the ingredients in my
 chest, but I cannot complete the recipe. I have been using the vitamin
 supplements from upstairs for the antidotes, but I just found out that
 native animals raided our supply last night and ate them all. There
 won't be any more until the next ship arrives. I guess I am now going
 to find out what happens when there is long exposure to the potion...

 ...Jane is gone who knows where and I've almost left this reality
 several times. This laboratory is breaking up around me. I think this
 is the end of my time here. It is too late to get any help. Too
 late...

>examine rations


 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine ration


 Each standard ration contains every vitamin, mineral and whatever else
 you need to stay healthy. Obviously taste is not a necessary component
 of healthiness though.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Northeast corner of laboratory</span>
 A large, rectangular machine takes up most of the space in this corner
 of the laboratory. It looks like it could be used to mix ingredients
 and make evil concoctions, or not-so-evil depending on the mood. There
 is a control panel on the machine's side, with an open compartment on
 top. Unfortunately, there are no helpful labels to describe any
 functions. A crack in the floor extends to the south. The laboratory
 continues to the south and west.

>SAVE

 You put the ration into the compartment.

>put kahrz in machine


 You put the flask of Kahrz into the compartment.

>push pink


 The compartment closes and the machine starts to shake, as it mixes
 all the ingredients together. This process continues for several
 minutes before coming to an abrupt halt.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>push yellow


 The compartment opens to reveal a strange grey mixture. It does not
 look very healthy, but maybe the gold will improve it.

>put gold in machine


 You begin to put the gold watch in the machine, but suddenly the
 ground rumbles beneath you. You drop the gold watch in surprise and it
 slips down the crack. You can see it hanging off a ledge, almost
 within arm's reach. Unfortunately the crack is not wide enough though.

>take gold with scythe


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine gold


 The watch no longer seems to be working, with the date stopped several
 weeks back. It has a gold case and strap. The strap is missing a few
 links and is no longer wearable.

>take gold


 The crack is not wide enough for you to reach in and grab the watch.

>put scythe in crack


 I do not want to lose the scythe down the crack.

>put wood in crack


 I do not want to lose the piece of wood down the crack.

>take gold with wood


 You can't see any such thing.

>turn dial


 You turn the dial and the scythe turns into a utility tool.

>again


 You turn the dial and the utility tool turns into a shovel.

>dig crack


 You need to dig with an appropriate digging implement.

>dig crack with shovel


 You dig with the shovel to widen the crack, so you can reach in and
 grab the gold watch. However, when you do try to reach in, it does not
 go as planned. The ground suddenly rumbles again, and knocks you off
 balance to send you tumbling into the deep hole.

 You fall and fall until you smack into the ground. The impact knocks
 you unconscious.




 (Press a key)



 When you wake up, lying on the ground, everything has changed again.
 You are on a new world, which is almost cartoonish. The sky is pink
 and you wonder if you are dreaming. It is probably the continuing
 effects of the potion though. As you look around, you suddenly notice
 that you are no longer carrying anything.

 <span class="floydstyle i">The base of the Red Tower</span> (on the ground)
 To the south a very tall tower reaches up into the pink sky, with the
 man-made structure providing a counterpoint to the surrounding forest
 and mountains. Near the top of the tower you can see an open window.
 The tower must be dark and airless, as the only other visible opening
 is a large set of closed wooden doors, which block the entrance into
 the tower. A path leads to the north.

 [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

>score


 You have so far scored 15 out of a possible 50, in 140 turns.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

 You stand up and glimpse a movement at the window. A beautiful
 apparition appears in your vision. She is a golden-haired Princess and
 you have never seen anything as captivating in your life. You wonder
 who she is, and whether you can meet her?

 As your thoughts wander a flapping noise can be heard overhead. The
 Princess draws back from the window, as a gargoyle flies down from the
 roof. The gargoyle lands in between you and the door. He announces
 loudly, "No one enters the Red Tower under my watch."

 Given the gargoyle's size, it probably is not a point you want to
 argue too hard.

>examine gargoyle


 On first glance the gargoyle looks monstrous, with a fierce facial
 expression and large wings, but when you notice that he is wearing
 glasses, he looks less intimidating. You think that he is made of
 stone, but he is clearly alive, so you are not sure. The gargoyle has
 not stopped staring at you since you first appeared.

>examine tower


 This is a very tall tower, with only a window near the top and a door
 next to you, breaking up the solid red walls.

 The gargoyle's unwavering stare is beginning to unsettle you.

>examine glasses


 The gargoyle is surprisingly wearing glasses. You did not know that
 stone creatures could have trouble with their eyesight.

>examine doors


 The two closed doors are the entrance to the tower. The doors are
 large and much taller than your height.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The boulder, at the base of a hill</span>
 You are standing at the base of a hill, which you can climb to the
 north. The undulating, grassy Arcadia almost makes you feel poetic,
 although your favoured style of limericks does not really fit the
 mold. A boulder, sitting in the middle of the path leading from the
 south, diverts the path around it and the hill to the northeast and
 northwest.

 You suddenly remember that you were searching for a gold watch, and
 you have just seen a golden-haired Princess. Are they the same,
 although does it even matter if they are? This is a new reality, you
 think. You hope it isn't a hallucination.

 Sticking out of the boulder is a sword hilt.

>examine hilt


 This is a simple, unadorned hilt. You vaguely remember legends of
 magical swords in stones, but not clearly. You wonder if your
 subconscious is shaping this world or not.

>take it


 You pull on the sword and it slides out easily. As the sword is
 withdrawn from the rock, you hear a strange melody, which builds to a
 crescendo when the sword is finally out. The hole in the boulder
 closes up again, after the sword is removed. That was very strange,
 but at least you have the sword now.

>examine sword


 The sword does not look very effective. The blade is blunt and the
 overall design is much more simple than you expected from your
 knowledge about legendary swords in stones.

>examine boulder


 The large boulder is the most distinctive feature of this location,
 sitting in the centre of the three diverging parts of the path. There
 do not appear to be many other rocks around, so you are not sure why
 the boulder is here. You don't think it is a natural occurrence, but
 who put it here?

>climb it


 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>push boulder s


 Is that the best you can think of?

>no


 To talk to someone or something, please type TALK TO OBJECT.

>talk to boulder


 The boulder doesn't reply.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The lake, at the end of the river</span>
 The river from the north reaches its final destination in the lake
 that you are standing next to. The lake is clean and sparkling in the
 daylight. The reflected pink sky gives it an unusual colouration. A
 pump is whirring next to the lake, moving water into a pipe, which
 leads northwest underground. Unfortunately the pipe is leaking heavily
 at the moment and most of the water is instead rolling back into the
 lake. The lake is slowly expanding due to the pump not working
 adequately and the river flowing aggressively. The river's speed means
 that it is impossible for you to swim north. Next to the pump is a
 closed chest. A path curves around the lake from the northwest to the
 southeast. A hill can be seen to the northeast.

 A dolphin appears from beneath the lake's surface. He looks at you and
 almost beckons you to follow, as he dives back underneath.

>examine chest


 A chest is sitting next to the pump and it is currently closed.

>open it


 You open the chest, revealing an oxygen tank and a hose.

>examine tank


 The oxygen tank is useful for when you need to breathe in places with
 no air. It has a tube, which can be attached to a helmet.

>hose


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine hose


 The hose could be attached to a tap to direct the water's movement.

>examine pump


 The machinery of the pump removes water from the lake, and pumps it
 through the pipe.

 A dolphin appears from beneath the lake's surface. He looks at you and
 almost beckons you to follow, as he dives back underneath.

>examine dolphin


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine river


 The river from the north ends at the lake.

>examine pipe


 The pipe travels from the machine to underground. Above the ground a
 joint on the pipe is loose and lots of water is leaking out.

>fix pipe


 You need something to tighten the pipe with.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the cave</span>
 A steep cliff marks the start of the mountain range to the west. The
 mountains continue to the north and south, with no path through above
 ground in sight. There is a cave in the west cliff wall that may
 provide a path underground. The cave does not look too dark, as a
 faint light emanates inside, although you cannot make out any details.
 You are glad that you are not claustrophobic, although you are not
 fond of dark holes ever since you had to hide in one on your last
 mission. A path curves around a water tank, passing from the northeast
 to the southeast. The water tank has a tap on one side, with a sign
 above it saying "Area Water Storage".

 On close inspection the cave entrance unfortunately reminds you more
 and more of the cave from your last mission.

>examine tank


 The tank is labeled "Area Water Storage" and it has pipes sticking out
 of it. The pipes head underground in both the northeast and southeast
 directions. You guess that the creatures around here get their water
 via the lake.

>turn tap


 You turn the tap on, but no water comes out. The tank must be empty.

>turn tap off


 The tap is already off.

>examine cave


 You can see that the cave heads deep into the mountains. Inside the
 entrance are some rock formations such as stalagmites and stalactites.
 The way the cave is situated within the cliff and the shape of the
 entrance reminds you of a cave from your last mission. Walking into
 that cave when you were retreating temporarily, you were almost burned
 alive by a fire trap set for the bugs. Luckily you were the wrong
 shape and avoided most of the damage. Once behind the trap you had a
 chance to rest up and formulate a strategy that you used to defeat
 several swarms. However, staying inside the cramped darkness for a
 long period was an experience you would not like to repeat.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bridge, over the river</span>
 A river flows from the mountains in the north to a lake in the south.
 The water is clear and rushes swiftly underneath the wooden bridge
 that you are standing on. The speed of the water means that without
 the bridge you would not be able to get across. A path from the
 northeast to the southwest travels over the bridge. A hill is to the
 southeast. Next to the bridge on the river's western side, a fruit
 tree is surrounded by a pile of sharp rocks. There is no fruit left in
 the tree, but the remains of the past fruit can be found stuck on the
 rocks.

 A small bird lands and attempts to get the fruit, but it is
 immediately forced into the air by the sharpness of the rocks
 underneath it. You feel sorry for the bird and think that there is
 something odd about the situation.

>examine tree


 You can tell that this is a fruit tree by the fruit lying underneath
 it, but it is difficult for you to tell what kind of fruit it is. The
 fruit is orange and purple, and you have never seen it before. You
 wish one of the colonists were here to help identify the fruit.

>examine rocks


 The pile of sharp rocks surrounds the base of the fruit tree. The
 remains of some fruit from the tree are stuck to the pile.

>search rocks


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine remains


 The remains of the fruit are on the sharp rocks below the tree.

>take remains


 You do not need the fruit.

 Another small bird, trying to get the fruit, lands on the rocks. The
 bird takes off straight after landing, as the rocks are too sharp
 underneath it.

>move rocks


 You can pick up rocks, but moving the whole pile is too difficult.

>take rock


 Taken.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a small sharp rock
   a sword

>sharpen sword with rock


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine river


 The river is moving swiftly from the north to the south under the
 bridge. Unlike many rivers you have seen on other planets, the
 relative primitiveness here has meant that the river has been left far
 cleaner and more attractive to look at.

>examine lake


 You can see that the river heads to a lake to the south.

>examine bridge


 This is a sturdy wooden bridge, which crosses over the river.

 Another small bird, trying to get the fruit, lands on the rocks. The
 bird takes off straight after landing, as the rocks are too sharp
 underneath it.

>examine bridge


 This is a sturdy wooden bridge, which crosses over the river.

>examine hill


 A hill rises to the southeast of your location.

>se



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The top of a hill</span>
 The top of this hill, is a good vantage point, as you can see
 everywhere from here. Luckily, as you do not want to walk too far, the
 area surrounding the hill is not that large. It is enclosed by a
 forest, which you cannot see the end of, to the east, and a mountain
 range, which you cannot see over, to the west. The two extremes meet
 at the north and south points of the area. In between you can see a
 farm to the east, a cave to the west, the Red Tower to the south and a
 shop to the north. A blanket of grass covers the whole hill, although
 the grass at the top does look a little flattened.

 The white rabbit is hopping around the area.

 The white rabbit bounds up to you and asks, "Who are you? Come on, you
 can tell me. Are you from nearby? Are you rich? Are you hungry? Give
 me some answers now!"

 What would you like to say?
 (1) "I am an explorer from a spaceship, who somehow made it to here."
 (2) "I am a rich royal from another land."
 (3) "It is none of your business!"
 (4) "Yes, I am hungry."

 "So, you are an alien. You do look funny. Where are your long ears?
 Are you going to experiment on me? You don't want to. Are you really
 an alien? I'm not sure. You don't look funny enough. Shouldn't you be
 green or something."

 The rabbit becomes distracted, and begins hopping around the area
 again.

>examine rabbit


 The white rabbit is very exuberant and is hopping crazily in strange
 patterns around the area. He looks very hyperactive, as he cannot seem
 to stop moving. Just watching him begins to give you a headache.

 The white rabbit is wearing a four leaf clover.

 You call the rabbit over to you.

 What would you like to say?
 (1) "Who are you?"
 (2) "Where am I?"
 (3) "Do you want to take a break?"

 "Look around. You can see everything from here. Not everything in this
 province, but everything in this area. I have not left for a while, so
 I cannot say what else is around. You should look for yourself."

 The rabbit becomes distracted, and begins hopping around the area
 again.

 The rabbit becomes distracted, and begins hopping around the area
 again.

 (1) "Do you want to take a break?"
 (2) "Go away!"

 "I could use a break, but not yet. I am not that tired. A snack might

 The rabbit becomes distracted, and begins hopping around the area
 again.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The shop entrance, at the base of a hill</span>
 The paths from the southeast and southwest intersect at a shop. A sign
 hangs over the shop's entrance to the north, proclaiming it as
 "Stegosaurus Supplies". You can climb the hill to the south, after
 walking past a sculpture. The sculpture is labeled as "Man on Bird",
 and it is life-size in scale. At least the man is life-size, and you
 did not know that birds could be that big. The man is armed with a
 lance and a shield, although he looks very close to dropping the
 shield. A regular ear-splitting screech emanating from the bird is
 threatening to give you a headache. A flash of light catches your
 attention from under the bird.

>examine light


 There is a small closed door, which is coloured gold and sits on the
 underside of the bird.

>open bird


 That's not something you can open.

>open gold door


 It seems to be locked.

>take shield


 (first climbing the ladder that is attached to the side of the
 sculpture)
 You pull the shield loose from the man's grasp. You then climb back
 down to the ground.

>examine shield


 This shield looks very effective and solid. It might even be possible
 to use it as an actual shield.

>examine shop


 The shop is labeled "Stegosaurus Supplies" and can be entered to the
 north.

>examine sculpture


 A label at the base of the statue says "Man on Bird", which is an
 accurate description of what you are seeing. The man is armed with a
 lance, and he looks ready for battle on the giant bird. You wonder
 whom he was battling. That is, of course, if this is a historically
 motivated rather than an artistically motivated sculpture. It is
 difficult to tell when you have not been in this land for long. On
 close inspection you notice a ladder built into the side of the bird.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the shop</span>
 This shop is almost empty. Business looks to have been very bad, as
 the heavy and undisturbed layer of dust means that no stock has been
 sold here for too long. On the eastern side are shelves, which only
 contain a few books and a tin of blue paint. On the western side is a
 table of food, on which small piles of carrots, mulberry tree leaves
 and steak sit. The glass counter looks a bit more full and houses some
 shiny objects, with the most eye-catching being a gold key, a silver
 wrench and a bronze diving helmet. A sign is next to these objects.
 The only exit is back to the south.

 The Stegosaurus is standing behind the counter. He is wearing the
 Amulet of Air.

>read sign


 What would a store be without exciting looking items at the counter to
 catch your attention for last-minute purchases? The shininess works
 well here in attracting your attention to a gold key, a silver wrench
 and a bronze diving helmet. A sign next to the items says "Special
 Lucky Offer Available Now!".

>examine stegosaur


 It is lucky that there is plenty of room behind this counter, as
 otherwise the Stegosaurus would not fit. In fact it looks like there
 is more store behind than in front of the counter. Despite his large
 size, the Stegosaurus does look helpful, although a little worried,
 which is probably due to the lack of business at this store. He is
 wearing the Amulet of Air.

>examine amulet


 The Amulet of Air is made of pumice. The head of the Princess you saw
 earlier is carved into the shape of the amulet. A cord allows the
 amulet to be worn around someone's neck.

 "Business has been poor since the War. The strange thing is that no
 one can really remember what happened during or before the War. I
 don't even know whether we won or lost, apart from that I think
 everyone lost. There was too much magic and it has had strange effects
 on everything. The only thing I remember is that the Princess became
 locked in the Red Tower late in the War. The Red Tower has been
 affected most by the magic and is not a safe place to enter. No one
 dares go there to let the Princess out. This shop used to house a lot
 more products, so there have to have been more creatures, but I guess
 too many creatures died or left this area."

 disaster. So, if you give me a four leaf clover, horseshoe, rabbit's

 though, as I will swap whatever you take for any of the items

 "No! This Amulet is mine, and I like it. I am not going to give it
 away. Not cheaply anyway. I am not willing to trade it for one of the
 other Amulets, but if you give me two of them, then I will consider
 it. I think most of the other residents in this area have found an
 Amulet at some stage."

 (1) "What are the Amulets?"
 (2) "Goodbye."

 "There are four Amulets for Air, Earth, Fire and Water. I don't know
 how, but they appeared at the end of the War, and I think they are
 related to the Princess in some way. They are made in her image, so
 that is a fairly safe assumption. I don't think there is any magic in
 them, but it could be just that I cannot access it. I'm told that the
 Amulets appeal most to creatures with affinities to the elements. I
 couldn't tell you for sure though."

 What would you like to say?
 (1) "Goodbye."

>take carrot


 When you reach for the food, the shopkeeper says, "You would need
 money to pay for that, and I do not think that you have any. We do
 have a special lucky offer on the items in the counter though."

 The shopkeeper tells you, "Take your time in looking around."

>examine carrot


 There is not much of a range of food here, but what is here does look
 new. At least these items look like they sell more regularly. The few
 items piled on the table include carrots, mulberry tree leaves and
 steak.

>examine helmet


 The bronze helmet could be used for diving underwater, if it is
 attached to an oxygen tank.

>examine key


 This small key is golden coloured.

>examine wrench


 The silver wrench looks a useful tool for tightening or loosening
 objects.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The shop entrance, at the base of a hill</span>
 The paths from the southeast and southwest intersect at a shop. A sign
 hangs over the shop's entrance to the north, proclaiming it as
 "Stegosaurus Supplies". You can climb the hill to the south, after
 walking past a sculpture. The sculpture is labeled as "Man on Bird",
 and it is life-size in scale. At least the man is life-size, and you
 did not know that birds could be that big. The man is armed with a
 lance. A regular ear-splitting screech emanating from the bird is
 threatening to give you a headache. There is a small gold door in the
 underside of the bird.

>se



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The field, on the farm</span>
 This section of the farm has a fenced off field, which is full of
 carrot plants. There is no access to the field, but there is a
 mechanical dog inside in the northeast corner. The metal on the dog is
 no longer shiny, and is in fact a little rusty. Next to the southwest
 corner is a machine with a funnel on top and a control panel on its
 side. A pipe leads from the machine to the southern wall. There is an
 open door in the wall as well. A path leads from the southeast to the
 northwest. A hill can be climbed to the southwest.

>examine dog


 You can see that the mechanical dog has the name Rover written on its
 side. You wonder why it has a name, when no one else seems to. The dog
 is made of metal, although this metal is no longer new and shiny. It
 has been neglected and is rusty in places. There is a basket on the
 dog's back. The dog is standing still, waiting for its next command.
 It is currently in the northeast corner of the field.

>examine basket


 The basket on the dog's back is empty.

>examine carrots


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine plants


 The carrot plants in the field can presumably be harvested to get
 carrots.

>take plants


 You cannot reach the carrots, as they are within the field.

>examine machine


 There is a machine attached to the fence in the southwest corner of
 the field. The machine has a funnel on top and a control panel on one
 side. The panel has two buttons and a dial on it. A pipe leads from
 the machine to the southern wall.

>panel


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine panel


 The control panel has two buttons, one labeled dig and the other
 labeled empty.  There is also a dial. The dial is currently centred,
 and can be turned to CL1 or CL2 on one side, and CCL1 or CCL2 on the
 other side.

>examine pipe


 One end of the pipe is attached to the machine. The pipe then
 progresses until it enters the wall to the south.

>examine wall


 The wall to the south contains a door and is part of a shelter.

>examine door


 This door allows access from the field for the farm to the shelter. It
 is currently open.

>enter door


 That's not something you can enter.

 A forest blocks your progress in that direction.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The shelter, on the farm</span>
 You are standing under a shelter, with the roof and northern wall
 protecting a pile of carrots. The end of a pipe is on the wall above
 the pile. Strangely there is also a container under the shelter
 labeled poison, which has a green liquid bubbling out of it. It does
 not seem to fit the mood of the place, and almost blurs out of your
 vision occasionally. There is an open door in the northern wall, with
 a path also progressing from the southwest to the northeast. The hill
 can be climbed to the northwest.

>examine liquid


 You can tell that the poison is out of place, but you are not really
 sure why. You wonder if you are fully happy with this reality, or if
 your doubts are changing it. Whatever the reason for the poison, it
 definitely looks deadly.

>examine carrots


 This is a huge pile of carrots under the shelter. It must be the main
 vegetable produced on the farm. In fact it looks like the only
 product.

>take carrot


 Taken.

>smell carrot


 (the pile of carrots)
 You smell nothing unexpected.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The boulder, at the base of a hill</span>
 You are standing at the base of a hill, which you can climb to the
 north. The undulating, grassy Arcadia almost makes you feel poetic,
 although your favoured style of limericks does not really fit the
 mold. A boulder, sitting in the middle of the path leading from the
 south, diverts the path around it and the hill to the northeast and
 northwest.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The lake, at the end of the river</span>
 The river from the north reaches its final destination in the lake
 that you are standing next to. The lake is clean and sparkling in the
 daylight. The reflected pink sky gives it an unusual colouration. A
 pump is whirring next to the lake, moving water into a pipe, which
 leads northwest underground. Unfortunately the pipe is leaking heavily
 at the moment and most of the water is instead rolling back into the
 lake. The lake is slowly expanding due to the pump not working
 adequately and the river flowing aggressively. The river's speed means
 that it is impossible for you to swim north. Next to the pump is an
 open chest. A path curves around the lake from the northwest to the
 southeast. A hill can be seen to the northeast.

>go northeast



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The top of a hill</span>
 The top of this hill, is a good vantage point, as you can see
 everywhere from here. Luckily, as you do not want to walk too far, the
 area surrounding the hill is not that large. It is enclosed by a
 forest, which you cannot see the end of, to the east, and a mountain
 range, which you cannot see over, to the west. The two extremes meet
 at the north and south points of the area. In between you can see a
 farm to the east, a cave to the west, the Red Tower to the south and a
 shop to the north. A blanket of grass covers the whole hill, although
 the grass at the top does look a little flattened.

 The white rabbit is hopping around the area.

 The white rabbit bounds up to you again, in order to start a
 conversation.

 What would you like to say?
 (1) "Why don't you just take the carrots from the shop?"
 (2) "Go away!"

>1



 "I have no money. That would be stealing. I'm not a bad rabbit. I'm a
 good rabbit. Don't even suggest that."

 The rabbit becomes distracted, and begins hopping around the area
 again.

>give carrot to rabbit


 The white rabbit looks surprised at your offering, but he gratefully
 takes it. The rabbit quickly eats all of the carrot, but immediately
 afterwards he yawns widely. He thanks you and gives you his lucky four
 leaf clover as a reward, before lying down on the ground and going to
 sleep. It is the first time that you have seen him peaceful, and you
 hope that he can get some good rest.

 [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

>take rabbit


 The rabbit looks tired, so you decide to let him sleep.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The shop entrance, at the base of a hill</span>
 The paths from the southeast and southwest intersect at a shop. A sign
 hangs over the shop's entrance to the north, proclaiming it as
 "Stegosaurus Supplies". You can climb the hill to the south, after
 walking past a sculpture. The sculpture is labeled as "Man on Bird",
 and it is life-size in scale. At least the man is life-size, and you
 did not know that birds could be that big. The man is armed with a
 lance. A regular ear-splitting screech emanating from the bird is
 threatening to give you a headache. There is a small gold door in the
 underside of the bird.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the shop</span>
 This shop is almost empty. Business looks to have been very bad, as
 the heavy and undisturbed layer of dust means that no stock has been
 sold here for too long. On the eastern side are shelves, which only
 contain a few books and a tin of blue paint. On the western side is a
 table of food, on which small piles of carrots, mulberry tree leaves
 and steak sit. The glass counter looks a bit more full and houses some
 shiny objects, with the most eye-catching being a gold key, a silver
 wrench and a bronze diving helmet. A sign is next to these objects.
 The only exit is back to the south.

 The Stegosaurus is standing behind the counter. He is wearing the
 Amulet of Air.

>give clover to stegosaurus


 The shopkeeper gratefully accepts your gift and puts it behind the
 counter. He says "You can take any of the items in the counter if you
 wish, and remember that you can always trade the item back later, if
 you want a different one."

 The shopkeeper gives you the gold key.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bridge, over the river</span>
 A river flows from the mountains in the north to a lake in the south.
 The water is clear and rushes swiftly underneath the wooden bridge
 that you are standing on. The speed of the water means that without
 the bridge you would not be able to get across. A path from the
 northeast to the southwest travels over the bridge. A hill is to the
 southeast. Next to the bridge on the river's western side, a fruit
 tree is surrounded by a pile of sharp rocks. There is no fruit left in
 the tree, but the remains of the past fruit can be found stuck on the
 rocks.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the cave</span>
 A steep cliff marks the start of the mountain range to the west. The
 mountains continue to the north and south, with no path through above
 ground in sight. There is a cave in the west cliff wall that may
 provide a path underground. The cave does not look too dark, as a
 faint light emanates inside, although you cannot make out any details.
 You are glad that you are not claustrophobic, although you are not
 fond of dark holes ever since you had to hide in one on your last
 mission. A path curves around a water tank, passing from the northeast
 to the southeast. The water tank has a tap on one side, with a sign
 above it saying "Area Water Storage".

 A mountain range blocks your progress in that direction.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The lake, at the end of the river</span>
 The river from the north reaches its final destination in the lake

>go down


 You dive into the lake and swim out to the middle.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bottom of the lake, southwest corner</span>
 As you swim around, you notice an old treasure chest lies on the floor
 in the southwest corner of the lake. It is closed and its base has
 become embedded in the ground beneath it. You wonder who left their
 treasure in the lake long ago, and why it was abandoned. Maybe it was
 too difficult to retrieve, or maybe it was lost not hidden. Whatever
 happened, it's ancient history now. The lake continues to the east and
 north, but you could also return back up to the surface.

 The dolphin swims up to you and says, "I need your help. I can't get
 into my home. I'm sure that you can think of something, and I would be
 very grateful."

 The dolphin is currently swimming in the area.

 the roof just collapsed whilst I was away."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bottom of the lake, northwest corner</span>
 The northwest corner has some unusual underwater plant life, with what
 looks like a tree growing out of the lake floor. It is surprising, as
 you would expect a tree like that to be growing on land, but maybe
 this tree is lost. You can see to the east a steep underwater cliff
 that almost reaches the surface. The water's shallowness separates the
 northeast corner from the rest of the lake. There is a tunnel in the
 cliff that you can swim into to the east. You can also swim through
 the lake to the south, or back up to the surface.

 The dolphin is currently swimming in the area.

>examine tree


 You have not heard of underwater trees like this one, but there is a
 lot about this land that is new to you. The unusual seems to happen
 regularly here. The tree has leaves, branches and everything you would
 expect, but you still keep thinking that you must be wrong somehow.

 You swim back up to the surface of the lake at the edge. You pull
 yourself out of the water and return to dry land.

 The dolphin swims off to the south.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The tunnel, west end</span>
 The tunnel has been carved into the rock, curving around from the
 south to the west. It slopes downwards in each direction.
 Unfortunately you can only see a little of the tunnel to the south as
 the boulder from the roof falling down is blocking the tunnel at its
 highest point. There is a crack that you can see slightly through. The
 boulder also appears to be blocking the entrance to a room. At the
 moment you can only exit to the west.

 Whilst swimming around the southeast corner of the lake, the most
 noticeable object is a sunken rowboat. The reason for the sinking you
 would guess has something to do with the crack along the boat's
 bottom, which probably would not have kept out the water very well. It
 does not look like the boat was well maintained, although being
 abandoned at the bottom of the lake wouldn't have helped. You can see
 to the north a steep underwater cliff that almost reaches the surface.
 The water's shallowness separates the northeast corner from the rest
 of the lake. There is a tunnel in the cliff that you can swim into to
 the north. You can also swim through the lake to the west, or back up
 to the surface.

 An oar has been left in the rowboat

>examine oar


 The long wooden oar could once be used to row a boat. However, you do
 not have a boat, and the oar is not in good condition anymore. It is
 still a reasonably strong piece of wood though.

>examine boat


 The rowboat has deteriorated sitting on the bottom of the lake,
 although it probably wasn't in great condition before then. There is a
 crack in the bottom, and the lake floor has begun to come through it
 to start burying the boat in the ground. The boat is not large and
 could not have held more than a few passengers.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The tunnel, south end</span>
 The tunnel has been carved into the rock, curving around from the
 south to the west. It slopes downwards in each direction.
 Unfortunately you can only see a little of the tunnel to the west as
 the boulder from the roof falling down is blocking the tunnel at its
 highest point. There is a crack that you can see slightly through. The
 boulder also appears to be blocking the entrance to a room. At the
 moment you can only exit to the south.

>push boulder


 You cannot push the boulder with your bare hands.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bottom of the lake, southeast corner</span>
 Whilst swimming around the southeast corner of the lake, the most
 noticeable object is a sunken rowboat. The reason for the sinking you
 would guess has something to do with the crack along the boat's
 bottom, which probably would not have kept out the water very well. It
 does not look like the boat was well maintained, although being
 abandoned at the bottom of the lake wouldn't have helped. You can see
 to the north a steep underwater cliff that almost reaches the surface.
 The water's shallowness separates the northeast corner from the rest
 of the lake. There is a tunnel in the cliff that you can swim into to
 the north. You can also swim through the lake to the west, or back up

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bottom of the lake, southwest corner</span>
 As you swim around, you notice an old treasure chest lies on the floor
 in the southwest corner of the lake. It is closed and its base has
 become embedded in the ground beneath it. You wonder who left their
 treasure in the lake long ago, and why it was abandoned. Maybe it was
 too difficult to retrieve, or maybe it was lost not hidden. Whatever
 happened, it's ancient history now. The lake continues to the east and
 north, but you could also return back up to the surface.

 The dolphin is currently swimming in the area.

>talk to dolphin


 You can't think of anything to say.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bottom of the lake, northwest corner</span>
 The northwest corner has some unusual underwater plant life, with what
 looks like a tree growing out of the lake floor. It is surprising, as
 you would expect a tree like that to be growing on land, but maybe
 this tree is lost. You can see to the east a steep underwater cliff
 that almost reaches the surface. The water's shallowness separates the
 northeast corner from the rest of the lake. There is a tunnel in the
 cliff that you can swim into to the east. You can also swim through
 the lake to the south, or back up to the surface.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The tunnel, west end</span>
 The tunnel has been carved into the rock, curving around from the
 south to the west. It slopes downwards in each direction.
 Unfortunately you can only see a little of the tunnel to the south as
 the boulder from the roof falling down is blocking the tunnel at its
 highest point. There is a crack that you can see slightly through. The
 boulder also appears to be blocking the entrance to a room. At the
 moment you can only exit to the west.

>push boulder with oar


 You are about to push the boulder when you notice the dolphin down
 below through the crack. You are not sure that it is safe for the
 dolphin to be there.

>push boulder with oar


 You lever the boulder with the oar. It begins to roll slightly and you
 push it as hard as you can. The boulder picks up momentum as it moves
 downhill. It soon reaches the end of the tunnel and with a crash lands
 on the ground outside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The home within the tunnel</span>
 This room is jovial in mood, with a hoop and rubber ball abandoned on
 the floor next to a bed. The bed's covers are adorned with images of a
 circus, including clowns and acrobats performing in the picture of the
 show. When you were young, you wanted to be in the circus, until you
 found out how little it paid compared to your current job. It would
 have helped if you had been a little more agile as well. There is also
 a closed chest in the room. Tunnels head to the south and west. A
 chunk is missing from the ceiling near the entrance of the room.

 The dolphin swims up to you. He tells you that he is very grateful,
 and also very glad that the boulder did not land on him. He then swims
 back out of the area.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The lake, at the end of the river</span>
 The river from the north reaches its final destination in the lake
 that you are standing next to. The lake is clean and sparkling in the
 daylight. The reflected pink sky gives it an unusual colouration. A
 pump is whirring next to the lake, moving water into a pipe, which
 leads northwest underground. The pump is now removing water at a
 similar rate to the river rushing towards the lake. The river's speed
 means that it is impossible for you to swim north. Next to the pump is
 an open chest. A path curves around the lake from the northwest to the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the cave</span>
 A steep cliff marks the start of the mountain range to the west. The
 mountains continue to the north and south, with no path through above
 ground in sight. There is a cave in the west cliff wall that may
 provide a path underground. The cave does not look too dark, as a
 faint light emanates inside, although you cannot make out any details.
 You are glad that you are not claustrophobic, although you are not
 fond of dark holes ever since you had to hide in one on your last
 mission. A path curves around a water tank, passing from the northeast
 to the southeast. The water tank has a tap on one side, with a sign
 above it saying "Area Water Storage".

>go west


 You try to walk into the cave, but you stop when a gust of fire is
 blown out. A voice apologises from inside, "Sorry about that. I'm a
 dragon, and I have been having a little trouble with my fire breathing
 recently. Ok, a lot of trouble. That's why I'm hiding in here, and
 don't want to see anyone. We can talk, but don't come in, without
 something to protect you from the flames. I just can't stop at the
 moment."

 You lift your shield and try again to enter. This time the shield
 deflects the flames. You slowly step inside the cave and walk towards
 the lit area you see inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the cave</span>
 There is not much left in this cave apart from ashes scattered around
 the area. It looks like the dragon's uncontrollable fire breathing
 problems have not been healthy for the furniture. All that is left is
 one table and a bed. You could guess that they were lucky, but looking
 at their pristine condition, a better guess might be that they are
 brand new. Sunlight is coming in from a hole in the ceiling of the
 cave that penetrates through to outside the mountain. The cave
 continues further to the west, but it is too dark to continue. The
 exit back outside is to the east.

 The dragon is lying on his stomach on the bed, facing towards you.

>examine dragon


 The green dragon is not looking well and is lying on the bed. He looks
 very nervous, and his fire breathing problems are obviously affecting
 him. He looks uncomfortable and is regularly shifting around in the
 bed, almost as if there was something hidden in the small gap between
 the dragon and the bed. The dragon's wings and tail are tightly curled
 around him, as he looks to be trying to hide from the world.

>examine bed


 This is a long bed, which is close to the floor. It is not much better
 than just being a mattress.

>examine table


 The table is the only piece of furniture in here apart from the bed.
 It is not that large and sits next to the bed.

>attach hose to tank


 You attach the hose to the tap.

>turn on tap


 You turn the tap on, and the water soon starts spraying out of the end
 of the hose on the ground. You pick up the hose and aim it into the
 cave. A burst of fire comes out, but the water cuts through and
 dissipates it. Soon you can see steam coming from inside the cave, as
 the water continues to be fired in. You continue for a long while,
 until eventually when the steam stops, you wait for a few more seconds
 to make sure, and then turn off the tap.

 The dragon emerges from the cave, and says, "Thank you so much. I feel
 a lot better now. I think I can even go see some friends that I
 haven't seen for ages. There are a few other dragons in this world,
 although not many outside this region, as there are mainly people
 elsewhere. Take something from my cave as a reward. I've got to go
 now."

 After saying this, the dragon takes off and flies in a northerly
 direction.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bridge, over the river</span>
 A river flows from the mountains in the north to a lake in the south.
 The water is clear and rushes swiftly underneath the wooden bridge
 that you are standing on. The speed of the water means that without
 the bridge you would not be able to get across. A path from the
 northeast to the southwest travels over the bridge. A hill is to the
 southeast. Next to the bridge on the river's western side, a fruit
 tree is surrounded by a pile of sharp rocks. There is no fruit left in
 the tree, but the remains of the past fruit can be found stuck on the
 rocks.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The field, on the farm</span>
 This section of the farm has a fenced off field, which is full of
 carrot plants. There is no access to the field, but there is a
 mechanical dog inside in the northeast corner. The metal on the dog is
 no longer shiny, and is in fact a little rusty. Next to the southwest
 corner is a machine with a funnel on top and a control panel on its
 side. A pipe leads from the machine to the southern wall. There is an
 open door in the wall as well. A path leads from the southeast to the
 northwest. A hill can be climbed to the southwest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The shop entrance, at the base of a hill</span>
 The paths from the southeast and southwest intersect at a shop. A sign
 hangs over the shop's entrance to the north, proclaiming it as
 "Stegosaurus Supplies". You can climb the hill to the south, after
 walking past a sculpture. The sculpture is labeled as "Man on Bird",
 and it is life-size in scale. At least the man is life-size, and you
 did not know that birds could be that big. The man is armed with a
 lance. There is a small gold door in the underside of the bird.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the shop</span>
 This shop is almost empty. Business looks to have been very bad, as
 the heavy and undisturbed layer of dust means that no stock has been
 sold here for too long. On the eastern side are shelves, which only
 contain a few books and a tin of blue paint. On the western side is a
 table of food, on which small piles of carrots, mulberry tree leaves
 and steak sit. The glass counter looks a bit more full and houses some
 shiny objects, with the most eye-catching being a silver wrench and a
 gold key. A sign is next to these objects. The only exit is back to
 the south.

 The Stegosaurus is standing behind the counter. He is wearing the
 Amulet of Air.

>give water to him


 The shopkeeper accepts the Amulet of Water, and puts it around his
 neck. After staring at his new possession for a few seconds, he sighs
 and says "I suppose you can have this now."

 The shopkeeper then takes off the Amulet of Air, and gives it to you.
 You are glad to have finally obtained the Amulet of Air. However,
 something is bothering you about the situation you are in. Solving
 puzzles, carrying out tasks, it all reminds you of something, but you
 cannot quite place it. You almost wonder if your subconscious is
 shaping this world from past experiences.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The shop entrance, at the base of a hill</span>
 The paths from the southeast and southwest intersect at a shop. A sign

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The top of a hill</span>
 The top of this hill, is a good vantage point, as you can see
 everywhere from here. Luckily, as you do not want to walk too far, the
 area surrounding the hill is not that large. It is enclosed by a
 forest, which you cannot see the end of, to the east, and a mountain
 range, which you cannot see over, to the west. The two extremes meet
 at the north and south points of the area. In between you can see a
 farm to the east, a cave to the west, the Red Tower to the south and a
 shop to the north. A blanket of grass covers the whole hill, although
 the grass at the top does look a little flattened.

 The white rabbit is lying asleep on the ground.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The boulder, at the base of a hill</span>
 You are standing at the base of a hill, which you can climb to the
 north. The undulating, grassy Arcadia almost makes you feel poetic,
 although your favoured style of limericks does not really fit the
 mold. A boulder, sitting in the middle of the path leading from the
 south, diverts the path around it and the hill to the northeast and
 northwest.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The base of the Red Tower</span>
 To the south a very tall tower reaches up into the pink sky, with the
 man-made structure providing a counterpoint to the surrounding forest
 and mountains. Near the top of the tower you can see an open window.
 That window was where you saw the blonde Princess, and where you
 consequently want to go. The tower must be dark and airless, as the
 only other visible opening is a large set of closed wooden doors,
 which block the entrance into the tower. A path leads to the north.

 The gargoyle is standing in front of the tower's entrance, looking at
 you.

>give amulet to gargoyle


 When you show the Amulet of Air to the gargoyle, you can see a
 momentary greedy expression in his gaze, but it is soon replaced by a
 masked look of indifference. The gargoyle says, "That is a very nice
 looking Amulet you have there. I have wanted one just like that for a
 long, long while. I think it would look good on me. Don't you? Of
 course you do, and you look like a generous kind of person. Not that I
 am asking for it. I would never do that."

 You smile, as you twirl the Amulet around your hand. Suddenly you toss
 the Amulet up in the air above the gargoyle. He takes off quickly and
 grabs it in mid-air. You see him look down at the Amulet, then
 continue flying upwards. The gargoyle lands on the roof of the Red
 Tower and disappears from sight.

>open doors


 You open the doors.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The inside of the tower</span>
 There is not much on the inside of this tower. Only stairs are
 visible, curling upwards around the walls. The amount of stairs does
 make up for the absence of anything else though. You cannot even see
 the top of the stairs in this dim light. The light is strange, as it
 looks artificial and coming from far above, but you have not seen any
 artificial light in this world. Apart from walking up the stairs, you
 could always return back outside to the north.

>examine stairs


 There is an impressive quantity of stairs heading upwards. It would be
 even more impressive to have an elevator instead, but it looks like
 there aren't any in this place.

>go up


 You climb up and up until you are almost exhausted. When you finally
 reach the top you take a short break to catch your breath. For a
 second in your exhaustion, you almost think that you are on a small
 ledge in a cave, with walls all around you and a faint light coming
 from near above you. However, when you look around more carefully you
 see none of this.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The top of the stairs</span>
 You cannot believe that you have climbed all of the stairs you can see
 descending into the near-bottomless dark depths below. You are
 standing on a small ledge, which connects the stairs with a door to
 the north. The door is closed, with a piece of wood placed across it
 to prevent anyone opening it from the other side. There is a dim light
 here, but you cannot figure out where it is coming from, as you cannot
 see a light on the ceiling. You estimate that you have about reached
 the level of the window where you saw the Princess earlier. You hope
 that you can finally reassure yourself that she is real. Or that she
 is not real. You do not know what you really want.

 You can see a stone dart here.

>examine dart


 This stone dart is blunt, and whatever uses it once had, it is now
 only a paperweight.

>take dart


 Taken.

>open door


 You need to remove the piece of wood first.

>move wood


 You take the wood off the door and place it on the floor.

>examine wood


 The piece of wood is lying next to the door.

>open door


 You open the door.

>block door with dart


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put dart on door


 Putting things on the door would achieve nothing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The home of the Princess</span>
 With a four poster bed, an elegant bedside cabinet and an armoire,
 this is a beautifully attired room, but it is still not nearly as
 beautiful as the Princess. She is looking at herself in a full-length
 mirror hanging on the wall, fixing her long golden hair. You glance
 into the mirror, but to your surprise you see something that has to be
 completely different to what she is seeing. You can see a rocky
 darkness, with a faint light shining from above.

 The Princess glances away from the mirror at the noise of the door
 opening. She smiles at you, and says, "Hi, my name is Princess Circe.
 I have been waiting a long while for someone to come through that
 door. The last trap that nasty wizard set was triggered a long while
 ago but no one has come since. Until you, my hero. Now that I am free,
 I can reclaim my kingdom, but I can't do it alone. Will you help? Will
 you stay here with me?"

 What would you like to say?
 (1) "Yes, I'd like to stay."
 (2) "No, I don't want to stay."
 (3) "No, I don't believe you exist."

>3



 You see a quizzical look start to emerge on the face of the Princess,
 but you close your eyes to ignore her reaction. You focus inwards,
 willing yourself to see the real world, not this fake dream. Suddenly
 you feel yourself falling, and you grab out wildly. Unlike earlier
 when this whole mess started, you manage to grab hold of something. As
 your eyes adjust to the darkness you can see that you are in a hole,
 with the laboratory above you. You haul yourself upwards to a ledge,
 where you find the gold watch you lost earlier. You pick up the watch
 and continue to climb upwards until you escape.

 Back in the laboratory you place the gold watch in the machine and
 turn it on. A strange gold liquid remains after it is all mixed
 together. You find an empty flask and fill it with the liquid. You
 suddenly realise that you are actually holding your missing
 communicator. You will need it to get back in contact with the ship.
 You ensure that you are outside the laboratory before drinking all of
 the gold liquid.

 Everything begins to change around you...




 (Press a key)



 You are finally back in the real world, with everything looking normal
 again. You have never been as relieved in your life to be finally free
 of the nightmare. All you have to do is to report back to the ship and
 get out of here. As you press the button on the communicator and ask
 for the Captain, you wonder what you should conclude in your report.

 What would you like to say?
 (1) There is nothing seriously wrong here.
 (2) There are a few problems, but they should be resolved in a few
 years.
 (3) This place is not safe to be colonised.

>3



 Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing when this planet will be
 safe. You have the bad feeling that the pinkness is going to spread,
 not disappear. You cannot allow the planet to be colonised in this
 condition. It needs to be quarantined, so the pinkness does not spread
 off-planet. Having made this decision, you gather up your evidence,
 and report back to the ship.

 When you talk to the Captain, you tell him about all your adventures.
 He is skeptical, but he eventually accepts your point of view that the
 planet is too dangerous to colonise, and he endorses your
 recommendations. Your stories are put on record with the other
 evidence. Whilst you may have convinced the Captain, other reviewers
 of the file feel it is more likely that you hallucinated from a local
 disease. That disease may make the planet more dangerous, but it may
 also have left a permanent effect on your health.

 In future years, whenever you try for a promotion, you find yourself
 rebuffed, as you are too risky. You wonder if you made the right
 decision. You hope you did, as there is no way you can change it now.

 Thank you for playing my IF competition entry. I hope you enjoyed it.
 If you did, then I advise you to try some of my other games, which are
 listed in the "about" section that can be accessed during the game.
 There are seven possible endings. The one you received, plus four
 others, can still be easily reached by typing "undo" and choosing a
 different option. However, the other two endings can only be reached
 by acting differently in the fantasy land.

 There are two paths in the game; the Path of Daedalus (a great
 inventor from Greek myth) and the Path of Diomedes (a great warrior
 from Greek myth). These paths correspond to solving puzzles with
 inventive/helpful solutions or violent solutions. The game starts on
 the Path of Daedalus, but it is possible to completely change the
 nature of everything to the differently themed parallel world of the
 Path of Diomedes. Each world better suits the respective method of
 puzzle solving.

 The first change to the Path of Diomedes is triggered by the decision
 to persevere with violent solutions to puzzles, rather than helpful
 solutions. The game will seek to dissuade you from this course of
 action, but if you persevere then you will succeed, and receive the
 consequences. The opposite is true in returning the world to the Path
 of Daedalus. There are a number of points where you can switch, and
 depending on which path you reach the end on, there will be
 differences to some of the possible endings.

 As the happy smile of the Princess lights up the room, you notice that
 the darkness in the mirror fades, until it is replaced by the
 reflection of the room. You walk out of the tower together, as you
 accept this world as your own.

 As the months pass, you become friends with the Princess. You soon
 realise that she is not as perfect as she appears. She regrets some
 actions that she took to protect herself against the evil wizard. Her
 trap killed the wizard soon after he sealed her in the tower, but it
 changed some of the other locals in various ways. You reassure her,
 and soon there is a general feeling of forgiveness and joy, as she
 retakes her throne to become Queen.




 (Press a key)



 This is not quite the end of your story though. Your cleverness soon
 wins you a position of power, which you use to make sure that the land
 is governed fairly. With all of her jewels stolen and lost long ago,
 her reign is hard work at the beginning, but you do not mind. Your
 friendship with the Queen endures and eventually blossoms into more.
 Two years after you first met, you are married in front of all the
 inhabitants of the land. You occasionally wonder what is happening in
 the world you left long ago, but you have no way of finding out.

 The Princess looks disappointed at your reply. She asks, "Why?".

 You answer that you want to go home. The Princess looks sympathetic to
 your plight, then she brightens up and tells you that she knows a way.
 She walks over and searches around in her cabinet until she finally
 pulls out a potion. She gives it to you and says, "Drink this, and you
 will be home."

 You look at the unmarked potion and hope that it can do what she says.
 It is worth a try. You drink down the potion in one gulp. As it begins
 to take effect, you find your mind is going blank, and all your
 memories are fading.

 You wake with no idea of who you are. All you know is that you are
 stuck in some room, and you want to get outside where there is more
 space. As you stretch your four legs, you hear a squeal behind you, as
 a blonde woman says, "I always wanted a pony."

 You think to yourself that none of what you saw could be real. Even if
 it was, then no one would believe you. You carefully destroy any
 evidence to the contrary of this position. The evidence was probably
 only significant in your imagination anyway. It was all due to eating
 a tainted native egg, which caused an adverse reaction. You can't
 remember why you wanted to eat it in the first place.

 You report back to the ship that there was a fire, with no survivors.
 On your return you promise yourself that you will try to avoid strange
 places in the future. The ship soon returns to your home planet, and
 you decide to take a long-deserved holiday in the familiar
 surroundings. You need a break to relax and catch up on all the latest
 computer games that have been released during your time at work. It is
 lucky that you are out of contact when the news filters through of
 disappearances all over a newly colonised planet. That would really
 not look good on your record, and negligence is not looked upon
 kindly.

 The planet is clearly not safe to be colonised in the short term, but
 you figure that if everything that is touched by the pinkness soon
 passes from this world, the problems will soon be resolved. This is
 the recommendation you pass back to the ship, along with the evidence
 that you have accumulated. You avoid talking about your own exploits,
 as the Captain is a very serious person, who you think will only
 believe evidence he sees for himself.

 The Captain is doubtful about the truthfulness of the documents you
 bring back, but on your advice, he agrees that it is not worth taking
 a chance. He reluctantly passes your recommendation through the
 hierarchy, and this planet is taken off the colonisation agenda for
 the next twenty years.

 Over the next few years you continue your rapid rise up the ranks,
 with sterling performances in both the physical and mental aspects of
 your roles. Eventually you are placed into training for a top
 position, and on completion you win a role as a Captain of your own
 ship. It is only a small ship, but you are finally in charge. You
 barely notice when the twenty year mark is passed, having long put
 your earlier adventures out of mind.

 At least your adventures are forgotten until one day you are called in
 by your commanding officer. He shows you a report of disappearances on
 a newly colonised planet, along with your recommendation for the
 planet. He tells you that he is very disappointed in you, and he
 cannot support you continuing in your current role. Your exemplary
 service will save you from being stripped of your rank, but you have
 been re-assigned to the planetside division.

 You turn on the box briefly, and a loud screech echoes around the
 area. Nothing happens, so you decide to shut down the noise before it
 starts again.

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The inside of the tower</span>
 There is not much on the inside of this tower. Only stairs are
 visible, curling upwards around the walls. The amount of stairs does
 make up for the absence of anything else though. You cannot even see
 the top of the stairs in this dim light. The light is strange, as it
 looks artificial and coming from far above, but you have not seen any
 artificial light in this world. Apart from walking up the stairs, you
 could always return back outside to the north.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The base of the Red Tower</span>
 To the south a very tall tower reaches up into the pink sky, with the
 man-made structure providing a counterpoint to the surrounding forest
 and mountains. Near the top of the tower you can see an open window.
 That window was where you saw the blonde Princess, and where you
 consequently want to go. The tower must be dark and airless, as the
 only other visible opening is a large set of open wooden doors. A path
 leads to the north.

>go west


 A mountain range blocks your progress in that direction.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The boulder, at the base of a hill</span>
 You are standing at the base of a hill, which you can climb to the
 north. The undulating, grassy Arcadia almost makes you feel poetic,
 although your favoured style of limericks does not really fit the
 mold. A boulder, sitting in the middle of the path leading from the
 south, diverts the path around it and the hill to the northeast and
 northwest.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The top of a hill</span>
 The top of this hill, is a good vantage point, as you can see
 everywhere from here. Luckily, as you do not want to walk too far, the
 area surrounding the hill is not that large. It is enclosed by a
 forest, which you cannot see the end of, to the east, and a mountain
 range, which you cannot see over, to the west. The two extremes meet
 at the north and south points of the area. In between you can see a
 farm to the east, a cave to the west, the Red Tower to the south and a
 shop to the north. A blanket of grass covers the whole hill, although
 the grass at the top does look a little flattened.

 The white rabbit is lying asleep on the ground.

>turn on box


 You turn on the box briefly, and a loud screech echoes around the
 area. Nothing happens, so you decide to shut down the noise before it

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The shop entrance, at the base of a hill</span>
 The paths from the southeast and southwest intersect at a shop. A sign
 hangs over the shop's entrance to the north, proclaiming it as
 "Stegosaurus Supplies". You can climb the hill to the south, after
 walking past a sculpture. The sculpture is labeled as "Man on Bird",
 and it is life-size in scale. At least the man is life-size, and you
 did not know that birds could be that big. The man is armed with a
 lance. There is a small gold door in the underside of the bird.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bridge, over the river</span>
 A river flows from the mountains in the north to a lake in the south.
 The water is clear and rushes swiftly underneath the wooden bridge
 that you are standing on. The speed of the water means that without
 the bridge you would not be able to get across. A path from the
 northeast to the southwest travels over the bridge. A hill is to the
 southeast. Next to the bridge on the river's western side, a fruit
 tree is surrounded by a pile of sharp rocks. There is no fruit left in
 the tree, but the remains of the past fruit can be found stuck on the
 rocks.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside the cave</span>
 A steep cliff marks the start of the mountain range to the west. The
 mountains continue to the north and south, with no path through above
 ground in sight. There is a cave in the west cliff wall that may
 provide a path underground. The cave does not look too dark, as a
 faint light emanates inside, although you cannot make out any details.
 You are glad that you are not claustrophobic, although you are not
 fond of dark holes ever since you had to hide in one on your last
 mission. A path curves around a water tank, passing from the northeast
 to the southeast. The water tank has a tap on one side, with a sign
 above it saying "Area Water Storage".

 A hose is attached to the tap.

>go west


 When you walk inside, you see a lit area, which you stumble in the
 dark towards.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the cave</span>
 There is not much left in this cave apart from ashes scattered around
 the area. It looks like the dragon's uncontrollable fire breathing
 problems have not been healthy for the furniture. All that is left is
 one table and a bed. You could guess that they were lucky, but looking
 at their pristine condition, a better guess might be that they are
 brand new. Sunlight is coming in from a hole in the ceiling of the
 cave that penetrates through to outside the mountain. The cave
 continues further to the west, but it is too dark to continue. The
 exit back outside is to the east.

>turn on box


 You turn on the box briefly, and a loud screech echoes around the
 area. Nothing happens, so you decide to shut down the noise before it
 starts again.
