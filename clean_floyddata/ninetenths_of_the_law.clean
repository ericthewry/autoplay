 Welcome to Phoenix's Landing!

 This is an interactive fiction game (or, if you prefer, a text
 adventure game.)  You can interact with this game through a variety of
 commands.  The commands you enter will cause your viewpoint character
 (the "you") to take certain actions, and, as various actions are taken,
 the story will unfold.

 most notable exception is if you are having a conversation, in which
 case you will have to finish your conversation first.  You will know
 that you are in a conversation if the game has supplied you with a
 numbered list of potential conversation responses.)

 Here are some useful commands....

 HELP will show you this message.

 LOOK (or L) will show what is around you.
 object.
 INVENTORY (or I) will show you what you are carrying.


 other people will talk to you of their own accord.  When you are
 conversing with someone, you will be presented with a list of numbered
 options.  Type in the number you want on each turn in order to continue
 through the conversation.

 When you want to move from place to place, try commands like EAST,
 WEST, NORTH, and SOUTH, or RETREAT (which will take you back in
 whichever direction you just came from).  You can also SIT, STAND,
 KNEEL, and LIE to assume different positions.  It is more comfortable
 to SIT ON CHAIR than to sit on the ground, though you can only do this
 if there is a chair nearby.

 Occasionally, it is useful to take a moment and THINK ABOUT something,
 such as one of the gods, one of the races, or someone that you have
 met.

 If you don't want to do anything at all, you can WAIT and see what
 happens next.

 Important commands also include QUIT, SAVE, RESTORE, and RESTART.  They
 do exactly what they sound like.

 These are the most important commands, but they are not the only
 commands implemented in the game.  When in doubt, experiment!  You may
 be surprised by what you can do.

 Have fun, and good luck!

 When this story began, it began this way....



 (Press Space to continue.)








 In a place that was no place at all, three presences gathered.  One was
 dead, one would never die, and one existed somewhere in between.

 The Undying commanded the ghost, *Speak, as you spoke to me.*

 The ghost, a translucent, haggard man, showed fear in every quiver of
 his insubstantial being, yet he spoke before the Presences.  "My lords,
 when I was born, a geas and star were cast upon my path.  There was a
 deed that I was fated to do, yet I was torn from life before it could
 be completed.  This was not in the stars, and it was not in my fate,
 yet it came to be.  I have been wronged."

 *You have been wronged.*  It was the Other, and each word twisted the
 shape of the ghost's existence.  *Yet past is past, and done is done.
 You cannot return to life.  You must go on.*

 *Yet who could alter what I set into motion?*  The Undying's words were
 stern, and, like the Other's words, they beat upon the ghost and caused
 the ghost to vibrate like a bell.  *There are few who could change this
 soul's path, and only one who would.  There must be an answer for
 this.*

 *We will answer between ourselves, then,* said the Other.  *It is
 nothing to this ghost.  I will send him on his way.*

 *No,* said the Undying.

 There was a pause.

 *no?* said the Other, and, with that soft syllable, a cold wind raced
 over every leaf in some faraway forest.



 (Press Space to continue.)








 *No,* said the Undying.   *For he accepted his path and his fate, and,
 in accepting, he gave all that he was.  Mortal though he is, he lost
 all, and he has earned protection.  In the name of the King, I claim
 his redemption.*

 *What is dead is dead, and dead shall not breathe,* the Other said
 indifferently.  *He is lost, and he rots beneath the stones.*

 *But I will mark his path again,* said the Undying.  *And I will set
 another upon that path, and I will send this ghost to watch over his
 successor.  If his successor accepts the path as deeply and fully as
 he, then that one will reap where this one has sowed.  And I call upon
 you to witness and to obey.*

 There was a silence like the silence before a storm, when the very sky
 draws breath, but there was no sky in this place that was not a place.



 (Press Space to continue.)








 *Set your star upon his successor, but leave your geas upon this
 ghost,* the Other said.  *What you have done shall not be undone, but
 I, too, have my rights.  I, too, am among the stars, though I stretch
 beyond them as well.*

 *You are among the stars,* said the Undying.  *I accept your obedience,
 and I accept your claim.*

 The Other considered.  *Then this path is mine, as well, to shape.  A
 little.*

 *A little,* the Undying acceded.



 (Press Space to continue.)








 The Other turned its attention to the ghost.  *We will choose, you and
 I, until the clay of your successor's being is created.  This, I will
 choose first: your successor's gender.  She will be she, as you have
 been he, thus creating balance.  Balance,* the Other added to the
 Undying, not unsardonically, *is of the essence.*

 *So let it be,* the Undying replied blandly.  Then, to the ghost: *It
 is your choice, now.*

 And in the place that was no place, a concept came, and another, until
 nine concepts were arrayed before the ghost.  The ghost perceived these
 nine:

 a sword - the concept of Power
 a spiderweb - the concept of Agility
 a dandelion - the concept of Endurance
 a book - the concept of Brilliance
 a mask - the concept of Cunning
 a candle - the concept of Awareness
 a crown - the concept of Presence
 a rose - the concept of Guile
 a jewel - the concept of Serenity

 *Choose,* said the Undying, *and what you choose will be born in your
 successor.*


 Before The Story
 There was no up, no down, no north, no south, no dawn, and no dusk.
 This was a place that is no place at all.  The passing of time itself
 was all but meaningless -- yet there was meaning in the passage of
 time; not much, but enough that three presences gathered here
 meaningfully, and enough that they could converse.

 The ghost perceived a sword, a spiderweb, a dandelion, a book, a mask,
 a candle, a crown, a rose, and a jewel.

>choose book
 The ghost hesitated for a long moment before reaching out to choose the
 book.

 The Other said, *Brilliance.  As you will.  In return, I choose
 Awareness.*

 To the ghost, the Undying said, *Your successor will have Brilliance.
 She will think methodically but clearly, and she will see through those
 who would confuse her mind with Cunning.  But one who is Aware will
 endure against her and see the end of her road before she can reach
 it.*

 The book, mask, and candle faded from the ghost's perception.  The
 sword, the spiderweb, the dandelion, the crown, the rose, and the jewel
 remained.

 *Choose again,* said the Undying, *and what you choose will be born in
 your successor.*

>choose rose
 The ghost hesitated for a long moment before reaching out to choose the
 rose.

 The Other said, *Guile shall be hers.  In return, I choose Presence.*

 To the ghost, the Undying said, *Your successor will have Guile.  She
 will be subtle and strong in persuasion, and those with Serenity will
 yield before her, convinced her aims are their own.  But one with
 Presence will entrance her to follow a new banner and forget her own
 will.*

 The rose, crown, and jewel faded from the ghost's perception.  The
 sword, the spiderweb, and the dandelion remained.

 *Choose again,* said the Undying, *and what you choose will be born in
 your successor.*

>choose dandelion
 The ghost hesitated for a long moment before reaching out to choose the
 dandelion.

 The Other said, *Endurance.  So be it.  In return, I choose Agility.

 To the ghost, the Undying said, *Your successor will have Endurance.
 She will have stamina and resilence, and she will endure every blow
 heaped upon her by one with Power.  But one with Agility will find her
 secret weaknesses, and her body will fail first.*

 The sword, spiderweb, and dandelion faded from the ghost's perception.
 *We have determined her heart and her mind and the strengths of her
 body,* said the Undying.  *Now we shall determine the shape of this
 body.*  And it seemed to the ghost, then, that five pieces of wood
 appeared before him, each different in hue: birch, ash, maple,
 rosewood, and ebony.

 *Choose,* the Undying said to the ghost, *and all will see your choice
 upon her skin.*

>examine maple
 The maple wood is golden and burnished to a rich shine.

>choose maple
 The ghost hesitated for a long moment before reaching out to choose the
 piece of maple.

 The other four woods faded away, leaving only the piece of maple.  Upon
 the piece of maple, the ghost perceived an indistinct, eyeless face.

 The Undying gestured again, and now seven small gems materialized: a
 ruby, a topaz, an emerald, a sapphire, an amethyst, a tiger eye agate,
 and a small dark diamond.

 *Choose,* the Undying said to the ghost, *and all will see your choice
 in her gaze.*

>examine amethyst
 Purple, faceted, and sparkling, the amethyst attracts the eye.

>examine sapphire
 Light and dark blue coruscate through the center of the gem.

>examine diamond
 Dark rainbows decorate the depths of the black jewel.

>examine emerald
 A grass green star hovers just off the surface of the emerald.

>ask undying about gems
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine topaz
 Sharp yellow light glints through the topaz's depths.

>choose ruby
 The ghost hesitated for a long moment before reaching out to choose the
 ruby.

 The other six gems faded away, leaving only the ruby.  It wavered and
 twinned, and then the pieces of ruby fused with the face of tan wood,
 shining softly in the place that was not a place.  Yet the face was
 incomplete, and the Other contemplated it.

 *I choose... this,* said the Other.

 And with the Other's words, a change came over the face, which became
 covered in downy fur.  The nose and mouth elongated into a snout, and
 small fangs appeared beneath the lips.  The face lost its
 indistinctness to become that of a chirop -- one of the spindly
 children of the mountains.  Her fur was as tan as a piece of polished
 maple, and her eyes were as crimson as two crimson rubies, with the
 light of intelligence shining in their depths.  Her expression was
 secretive, and she looked healthy and well-fed.

>examine me
 (Press Space to continue.)








 *It is done,* said the Undying.  *There will come a day when my star
 marks her sky, and when that time comes, it will be the time of your
 geas once more.  Then you will be free to guide her, and if she walks
 upon the true path, then she will gain all that you should have
 gained.*

  *Or lose,* said the Other, *all that you should have lost --*  And for
 a moment, the words that shook the ghost's very substance carried
 something like sorrow and something like pain, made brighter by the
 light of life so near, the touch of death so far.

 *But for now,* said the Undying, in a way that could not be denied,
 *you will wait --*

 And, bound by the power of a word and a star, the ghost slept, and the
 world changed in many ways before he wakened.

 Phoenix's Landing: Destiny
 An Adventure Game by Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 080820 / Inform 7 build 5T18 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)


 Much later, and in a place that was far more real, a young chirop
 ventured from home with her tradefather for the very first time.  She
 knew nothing of stars, geasa, ghosts, Presences, or anything else
 except that she was very proud to be along on this trip.

 Unfortunately, while she knew nothing of the stars, they knew something
 of her....



 (Press Space to continue.)








 It's the first time that you've been allowed to travel on a trading
 mission.  All your life has been secluded within the confines of a
 mountain cavern-town far to the west, but this year, your
 creche-fathers agreed that you should accompany your tradefather
 instead of the assistant that your tradefather normally hires for the
 journey.

 After weeks of travel (first down the rocky slopes and through rambling
 hills, and then through the twisting, shadowy forests) you get your
 first real look at the city of Phoenix's Landing.  Above the tall stone
 walls, you can see the tops of the buildings.  Two towers at the center
 rise highest of all, and, from your tradefather's stories over the
 years, you recognize them immediately as the temple to Ivrul and the
 governance hall.  Golden fields border the city to the west and south,
 with a few small buildings clumped here and there.  The dark face of
 Char Cliff rises above it to the north, marking the base of First
 Mountain.

 When you raise your eyes to First Mountain, the city seems no larger
 than a child's city built from shards of fallen stone.  The city
 nestles beneath the cliff as a pup to its mother, yet it is larger than
 any city you have ever seen.  You have no plans to visit the chiroptera
 here, but you know that other creche-clans dwell in the range beyond
 Char Cliff, and the thought is oddly comforting.

 But -- the city!  You can see it more clearly, now, and excitement
 bubbles up within you.

 To journey through the shadowy forests, you joined a caravan, and now
 the mounted guardsmen scatter forward and back, tending to their
 various claims since the forest's dangers are receding away.  The
 boredom of the past week fades as you bounce slightly on the seat of
 your wagon and strain to see more.

 Each wagon has to pause for inspection at the guard house on the near
 side of the bridge.

 You are far enough back in the line of wagons to grow deeply impatient
 as you wait for your opportunity to enter the city.  Once the wagon has
 been inspected, it clatters over the broad, flat bridge and passes
 through the gates into the milling city beyond.  You catch only a few
 brief glimpses of the buildings beyond.

 Then it is your turn.  Your wagon rolls forward over the rutted road
 and halts.  "Inspection," the shaghal guard growls.  "All parties
 present themselves."

 At your father's signal, you hop down from the wagon.


 (Press Space to continue.)








 Outside Phoenix's Landing
 Most of the other wagons have already passed over the bridge, but a few
 wait patiently behind yours.  Before you, a broad, sturdy bridge
 stretches over a wide and rather dubious-looking river.  Beyond the
 bridge, the gate of Phoenix's Landing gapes open to receive you.

 Father is here with you, which is rather a relief.  The city looks
 awfully large this close up.

 The large shaghal guard stands here inspecting wagons and merchants
 before he approves them to enter the city.

 Father says quietly, "Achatli, this should only take a moment, but
 please be on your best behavior."

 I beg your pardon?

>examine river
 A faint swirl of grease drifts over the surface of the murky grey
 water.

>examine bridge
 The bridge is almost as dusty as the road.

 The guard approaches Father, identifies himself as Greshen, and demands
 both of your names, which your father supplies.  Greshen nods slightly
 in reply.
 (You memorize Greshen's name for future reference.)

>examine father
 You take a moment to study your clan's tradefather -- the one who
 interacts with other races and visits cities beyond the chirop
 mountains of your home.  He is your true father as well, but this is
 much less important than his position in the creche-clan, and you tend
 to forget about it from time to time.  Despite this, you have always
 been pleased by your resemblance to one another -- you share his tan
 fur and crimson eyes.  Someday, he will retire.  Because you are
 female, you could never hold the title of tradefather in a creche-clan,
 but you can hope for enough training that you can spend your life
 traveling and bartering.  Maybe you will even serve the creche-clan in
 your tradefather's stead for a time.  It is a slim hope, but a hope.

 Greshen inspects the contents of your father's wagon.

>examine greschen
 You can't see any such thing.

>oops greshen
 Shaghal are the furred people of the plains and valleys.  They
 typically have brown or black fur and brown, black, amber, green, or
 dark blue eyes, although the occasional specimen displays an unsettling
 crimson hue.  Shaghal have two arms, two legs, and walk upright, as all
 people do, but their faces are distinctly canine, with short muzzles,
 black noses, and white, sharp teeth, rather like jackals or wolves.
 The resemblance is enhanced by triangular ears set high atop the skull
 and a plumed tail.  For all of that, their hands are five-fingered and
 dextrous, and you know better than to underestimate their intelligence.

 This particular shaghal has mahogany brown fur and dark amber eyes.  He
 carries a short, heavy staff wrapped in leather in one hand, and he
 also bears a curved axe at his hip.  He displays the scarlet and silver
 crest of Phoenix's Landing on his shoulder.

 Greshen seems to be taking an awfully long time with his inspection.

>talk to father
 His attention is on Greshen and he doesn't want to be disturbed.

 Greshen finishes his inspection and turns to your father.  "Everything
 seems to be in order here," he says.

 "I'm glad to hear it," Father replies.

>examine crest
 The crest of Phoenix's Landing is a flame-wreathed scarlet bird
 silhouetted on a bright silver mountain, all set on a field of black.
 The crest appears on the shoulder of this jerkin.

 For the first time, Greshen's amber gaze slides over your face as he
 looks away from Father.  One of his ears twitches, and he looks
 surprised.  Instead of saying anything, though, he rummages in his vest
 for a piece of paper.  After scrutinizing the paper for a long moment,
 he stares intently into your eyes, and then he shakes his head.
 "You'll have to wait here for a moment," he says, and signals to a
 human guard standing closer to the gate.  The human guard nods briefly
 and goes into the city with a purposeful air.

>think about greshen
 Greshen is a shaghal guard in Phoenix's Landing.
>think about father
 The other races are unfortunate to have only one father apiece.  Like
 any other chirop born to a healthy creche-clan, you have five fathers,
 all well beloved: your lorefather, your lawfather, your lifefather,
 your hearthfather, and your tradefather.  Yet you are more like your
 tradefather than any other of your fathers, and you know he is your
 blood-father as well.  You have a special closeness to him, and it is a
 deep privilege to go on this journey with him.  Your tradefather's role
 as a father is to teach you and your siblings about how to interact
 with the other races, and his duty as a member of the clan is to trade
 so that the clan will prosper.

>ask greshen about paper
 Father might be annoyed if you did that.

 A graceful chirop priest strides through the gate.  He glances about
 briefly before Greshen beckons him over.

 "Eyes of Justice," Greshen says respectfully.  "There was a missive
 that came out, and I think...."  Instead of finishing the sentence, he
 shows the slightly crumpled piece of paper to the young priest.

 The priest peruses the paper and then looks down at you.

>think about humans
 Humans are the populous people of the oceans.  They have two arms, two
 legs, and walk upright, as all people do.  Their skin is normally light
 or dark brown, though there are paler or darker exceptions, and they
 have eyes in a wide variety of colors.  Although both genders grow hair
 from the tops of their heads, human men can be readily distinguished
 from human women because the women do not grow fur on their faces.
 Although they appear weak and unprotected, they are surprisingly
 versatile and thrive in a variety of enviroments.

 "A greeting to you, in virtue and honor," the priest says.  "I
 understand your name is Achatli.  Is this your first time in the city
 of Phoenix's Landing?"

 [1] "It is true.  I have never been here before."
 [2] "Of course not.  I am well familiar with the city."
 [3] "What's your name?"

 "I do have the advantage of you, and I can see that you feel that's
 unfair," the priest says.  "As you will.  I am Hachachi of the Stars.
 And now you will answer my question, perhaps?"

 (You memorize Hachachi's name for future reference.)
 [1] "It is true.  I have never been here before."
 [2] "Of course not.  I am well familiar with the city."

>1
 Hachachi nods.  "I hope you like it here.  Before I can permit you into
 the city, though, my superior -- High Caerwyn of the Stars -- requests
 to meet with you.  I trust you have no objection?"

 [1] "It would be my pleasure."
 [2] "That seems all right...."
 [3] "Is there another way?"

>3
 Hachachi frowns slightly.  Turning to your father, he explains, "It is
 merely a precaution, but there is an omen about a girl with the
 markings and hue of this child, and we expect the one we seek before
 the moon's cycle ends.  I wouldn't worry," he adds, "but it really is
 important that High Caerwyn inspects her."

 Father hesitates for a long moment.  Greshen tenses slightly in
 response to Father's tension, and for a moment, you fear something
 horrible will happen, but then Father says, "All right.  I'll be with
 her, of course."

  Hachachi nods.  Turning to Greshen, Hachachi says, "Please take this
 wagon to the side and ensure that it remains safe.  We should return
 within the hour, but there's no need to block traffic."



 (Press Space to continue.)








 Leaving the wagon behind, you cross the broad bridge and enter the vast
 city from its western gate.  "This is West Flame Gate," Hachachi says
 conversationally, "and people call this neighborhood the Silver
 District.  You'll bring your wagon through this way later this evening.
 Over there is the Full Cup, a very good inn -- I recommend the ale
 highly."

 He continues to converse as you move through the city, but the sound
 flows around you like the mountain wind -- present, but disregarded.
 You pay more attention to the various wagons in the market square you
 pass, to the way passersby part for the young priest, to the low
 buildings on all sides, and to the people -- so many people!  You have
 never seen so many people in all your life, let alone all in one place.
 From your father's past stories, you know that this was once a chirop
 town, but that many humans and shaghal moved here as the city grew in
 prominence, and now it is a notable center of trade.

 In your heart, you had somehow pictured a town like your home, but the
 buildings surrounding you are very different from the caves where you
 grew up.  You did not know there were so many chirop clans in all the
 world, and here, those clanmembers mingle with an equal number of
 humans and scattered groups of shaghal.  You are comforted by the
 presence of your father.

 Looking forward, you see a bridge at the end of the street, and, beyond
 that bridge, you see a white spire that can only be the governance
 hall.  The governance hall and the temple of Ivrul are placed upon an
 island at the center of the city, and now, you are close enough to
 glimpse sunlight sparkling off the surrounding waters.

 A wide-shouldered human woman stands to the left of the bridge's base.
 Like the shaghal guard at the gate, she bears the scarlet and silver
 crest of Phoenix's Landing on one shoulder, though she carries a spear
 instead of an axe.  Hachachi nods a greeting to the human guard, who
 nods briefly in return and gestures you across the bridge.

 There are tiled paths here rather than cobbled streets, and Hachachi
 turns left along one of those paths, guiding you past the governance
 building and toward four buildings standing in a cluster.  The tallest
 of these by far is the silver spire that you saw before, which you
 recognized as the spire of Ivrul of the Mists.  That, however, is not
 your destination.  Instead, the priest escorts you to a stately
 building of grey marble, and you walk beneath an archway marked with a
 silver star.  This is the temple of Ferran of the Stars.

 Beyond the archway is a courtyard, and you pass through the courtyard,
 through the doors, and down a short hall before entering a
 silver-walled chamber.  The most noteable feature of the room is a
 stunning blue tapestry depicting a heron among reeds.  A human woman
 garbed in black leather is seated to one side.


>bow to woman
 (Press Space to continue.)








 With your father at your side, you enter.  Behind you, Hachachi says
 respectfully, "High Caerwyn, I present Achatli for your examination."
 (You memorize High Caerwyn's name for future reference.)
 High Caerwyn nods.  "Thank you, Hachachi.  I will summon you when it is
 time."
 Hachachi steps back into the hall and closes the door gently behind
 him.

 Heron Chamber
 The chamber is dominated by a wide tapestry hanging opposite the door.
 In shades of blue, black, silver, and gold, it depicts a magnificent
 heron standing among reeds and gazing skyward toward a night filled
 with stars.  The walls are panelled in dark wood with a subtle silver
 shimmer.  A massive black cabinet stands to one side, and a matching
 table has been positioned among four chairs at the center of the room.

 High Caerwyn is sitting on the tall chair positioned in front of the
 tapestry.

 I beg your pardon?

>think about names
 Your thoughts circle without profit.

>examine her
 I'm not sure what "her" refers to.

>examine achatli
 There is no reflective surface nearby in which you can get a proper
 look at yourself.  However, despite your best efforts to remain tidy,
 your fur is dusty from the road, and you are not completely comfortable
 with your current appearance.  You would definitely welcome the
 opportunity to tidy up.

 Father has promised that opportunity once you are safely inside the
 city, which is another reason to hope for speed.

>examine caerwyn
 Humans are the populous people of the oceans.  They have two arms, two
 legs, and walk upright, as all people do.  Their skin is normally light
 or dark brown, though there are paler or darker exceptions, and they
 have eyes in a wide variety of colors.  Although both genders grow hair
 from the tops of their heads, human men can be readily distinguished
 from human women because the women do not grow fur on their faces.
 Although they appear weak and unprotected, they are surprisingly
 versatile and thrive in a variety of enviroments.

 High Caerwyn is garbed in a fitted, coal black leather vest over an
 equally dark cloth shirt.  Her ankle-length skirt is similarly made of
 fine leather, and it has been split up each side to allow for maximum
 freedom of motion.  A tear-shaped medallion hangs upon her brow from a
 fine silver chain, and several necklaces ornamented with various sigils
 encircle her throat.  The overall effect is ornate and militant at the
 same time, and not at all what you expected, though you have rarely
 encountered worshippers of Ferran of the Stars.

 "Achatli, be welcome," High Caerwyn greets you.  "I am Caerwyn, the
 High Priestess of Ferran of the Stars.  Tell me, what do you know about
 the Divine Judge?"

 [1] Tell Caerwyn in detail what the chiroptera teach about Ferran.
 [2] Claim to know nothing about Ferran.

>1
 You glance quickly at Father for approval.  "Go ahead," Father says
 gently.  "As your lorefather taught you."

 "Our lorefather taught us that Ferran is the god of the stars.  When
 Sarvath the King went away to the desert, Ferran rose to be the
 patriarch of the gods.  After the desecration of Ivrul of the Mists,
 Ferran came to Ivrul in shame and sorrow because she was of his creche
 and Ferran had not protected her.  From the mists that are Ivrul's
 domain, Ferran created the greater chiroptera to serve and protect her
 from above and the lesser chiroptera to serve and protect her from
 below.  We are the lesser chiroptera, thirdborn by Ferran's hand.  When
 we act to protect others and to guard our families, we are Ferran's
 eyes in the darkness, just as the stars are Ferran's eyes in the sky.
 When we die, Ferran will reach into the darkness and lift us to join
 the greater chiroptera, where we will see Ivrul with our own eyes and
 serve her with our own hands."

 "You remember your lessons well, and you know much of Ferran," High
 Caerwyn says, "but there is more that you should know."  Her voice
 takes on a formal cadence as she continues.

 "Although Sarvath the King went into the desert, Ferran remains
 Sarvath's loyal servant.  As Sarvath bade him, Ferran rewards virtue by
 raising virtuous souls to the night sky after death, where they can
 watch over the world and aid those in need.  To aid people in being
 virtuous, and to aid him in his vigil, Ferran set nine constellations
 of virtue into the night sky.

 "But these are not the only stars in the sky.  In Sarvath's absence,
 while still honoring his vows, Ferran turned to serve Adisha the Queen.
 At times, he will present truths to his Queen through the dance of the
 stars.  Astrology, the holiest discipline of this temple, is the art of
 reading the movements of the stars.  In those movements, we can see
 both the truths set forth for men and the truths set forth for the
 Queen.

 "Near the constellation of the Heron, a new star has come into being.
 This star announces the coming of an important person to Adisha -- a
 person with a great destiny.  We know that this person will come to
 Phoenix's Landing before the next moonset, and we know something of the
 appearance of this person.

 "We need to know if you are the person we seek," High Caerwyn
 concludes.  "And to that end, I need to examine you."

 [1] "The priest said something about markings... what markings?  What
 appearance?"
 [2] "Examine?  What kind of examination?"
 [3] "And if I am the person you seek... what does that mean?"

>2
 "The easiest way to show you is to do it," High Caerwyn says.  From a
 concealed pocket in her skirt, she takes a polished wooden case no
 larger than her palm.  When she opens the case, she reveals a set of
 onyx stones, each carved with a rune, and a folded square of blue silk.
 She spreads the silk across the chair at her side.  "I will need a
 strand of your hair," High Caerwyn says.  You draw your fingers through
 your hair, coming away with a single strand, and pass it to her.  She
 loops the strand of hair end-to-end, forming a circle upon the silk.

 High Caerwyn closes the case and rattles it for a moment before opening
 it.  As she pours the stones across the silk, sudden silvery-blue light
 radiates up from the silk, and the strand of hair vanishes.  The nine
 stones roll to rest in a four-pointed star -- one at the center, two on
 each arm.  Only the center stone faces upright, and that one bears the
 same stylized star as you saw above the archway.

 "What does that mean?" Father asks, though the tone of voice suggests
 that he has his suspicions already.

 (Press Space to continue.)

 The high priestess sits very still for a moment before picking up the
 case and putting away her set of stones.  "This is inconclusive, but I
 would like to talk with your daughter alone for a moment."  Father
 opens his mouth to protest, but she cuts him off in a clear, sharp
 voice.  "We will be here, and you will be right outside the door.  I
 assure you, there is nothing to fear."

 "Unacceptable," Father says coldly.  "We will discuss what must be
 discussed, you and I, and you will involve my daughter further only
 with my consent."

 "She is nearly to her age of majority ," High Caerwyn states.  "She has
 the right to hear about such things herself.  If she is geased -- and
 she does seem to be -- then she must know what will come of it."

 "And if I refuse?" your father demands.  There is a long pause as
 Father and High Caerwyn stare at one another, his crimson eyes locked
 to her dark blue eyes.

 The priestess of Ferran looks away first.  "Then it could be her life,"
 she says simply.

 Your father presses the advantage.  "If it is her life, then what you
 know must be shared with me fully before you speak to her further.  She
 is bright and special and tireless, and she is honored for her learning
 by every one of her fathers.  I will permit nothing to harm her."

 This last, you recognize as trade manners; it would not do for this
 priestess to think you are of low value to your creche-clan, lest she
 believe that you -- and Father -- could vanish without your family's
 notice.  Still, you warm beneath his praise.


 (Press Space to continue.)








 High Caerwyn nods.  "Very well."  She rises from her chair, goes to the
 door, and summons the graceful chirop priest.  "Escort Achatli to the
 Cat Chamber, please, and remain until her father comes or until I join
 you."

 The priest bows gracefully to Caerwyn, half-spreading his arms to
 expose his patagium as he does, and then backs out of the room.  At
 your father's nod, you follow the priest.

 The Cat Chamber turns out to be a short way down the corridor to the
 left.  Hachachi follows you in and closes the door.

 Cat Chamber
 This chamber is nearly identical to the previous room, including the
 dark walls and precisely positioned black furniture.  The primary
 difference is in the tapestry, which depicts a spotted cat instead of a
 heron, and which has been executed with accents of gold, yellow, and
 green upon black instead of blue and silver upon black.

 Hachachi is standing nearby.

>examine hachachi
 He is chirop, just like you -- one of the lithe, lightly furred people
 of the mountains.  Your father has told you of other chiroptera here,
 and it is a comfort to see one now.  Like you or your father, this
 chirop has a membrane called the patagium that stretches from hip to
 wrist, connecting his arms to his body in the fashion of a bat's wings.
 His face is small and fuzzy, and you know that fangs are hidden within
 the small snout.

 This particular chirop is light tan in hue, with piercing black eyes.
 Several braids have been woven into the crest of longer hair that runs
 back from his brow.  He wears a two-tone tunic in light and dark grey,
 and the tunic has been split neatly down the sides so that his patagium
 is not hampered -- a fairly traditional style of garb, which you and
 your family also favor, though the stylized star embroidered on his
 collar is not traditional.  He is young, yet carries himself with an
 air of authority.

>examine patagium
 You can't see any such thing.

>think about patagium
 Your thoughts circle without profit.

 "Would you like to sit down?"  Hachachi gestures to the ring of four
 chairs.

>think about profit circles
 Your thoughts circle without profit.

>sit
 Did you mean to sit on the floor?  (There's a black chair positioned
 facing the tapestry right there....)
 [Please respond with YES or NO.]

>no
 You seat yourself in one of the black chairs.  Hachachi nods his
 approval.

 The priest draws a small key from a hidden pocket and opens the black
 cabinet.  At this angle, you can't really see anything of the contents
 of the cabinet, but when Hachachi turns back toward you, he is holding
 a small, opaque bottle and a pair of porcelain cups.

 "Are you familiar with desert appleshy?" he inquires.

 [1] "Desert appleshy?  I don't think so...."
 [2] Remain silent.

>1
 "It is made by the jinn," Hachachi says as he uncorks the bottle and
 pours carefully.  The liquid that swirls into the cups is pale gold,
 but tinged with faint iridescence.  "The name is more fantastic than
 the flavor, I fear, but it has the virtue of lasting long and well in
 darkness -- so we keep a bottle in each room to quench thirst at
 appropriate times."

 Keeping one cup for himself, he sets the other on the table and then
 takes a moment to put the bottle away.

 Hachachi sits down on the black chair positioned to the right of the
 tapestry.

>spill bottle
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>break bottle
 You can't see any such thing.

>xyzzy
 Yes, Colossal Caves is awesome.  Now stay focused.

>spill cup
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>empty cup
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>pour out cup
 I only understood you as far as wanting to pour the outside.

 Cat Chamber (on the black chair positioned facing the tapestry)
 The chamber is dominated by a wide tapestry hanging opposite the door.
 In shades of gold, yellow, green, silver, and black, it depicts a
 magnificent spotted cat lounging upon a tree branch and gazing skyward
 toward a night filled with stars.  The walls are panelled in dark wood
 with a subtle silver shimmer.  A massive black cabinet stands to one
 side, and a matching table of smaller size has been positioned among
 four chairs at the center of the room.

 Hachachi is sitting on the black chair positioned to the right of the
 tapestry.
 On the small black table is a small porcelain cup of desert appleshy.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 (the small porcelain cup of desert appleshy out)
 You don't see anywhere appropriate to pour out the small porcelain cup
 of desert appleshy.

 Hachachi tilts his cup to his lips for a moment before lowering it
 again.

 (the small porcelain cup of desert appleshy)
 You smell nothing unexpected.

 A border of ornate black knotwork outlined delicately in gold runs
 along the edge of the tapestry.  At the center of the image, shadowy
 green leaves part to reveal a magnificent spotted cat lounging on a
 tree branch.  The yellow-gold cat all but glows against the blackness
 of the night sky.  Above the cat, fourteen bright yellow stars
 connected by thin golden lines pick out a constellation against the
 night sky, and the constellation is a second cat.

 Hachachi pauses to smell the aroma in his cup.

 You fail to move the wide tapestry.

 Hachachi gazes into his cup for a moment and swirls the liquid
 reflectively.

 (the small porcelain cup of desert appleshy)
 (first picking up the small porcelain cup of desert appleshy)
 Taken.

 You take a sip from the small porcelain cup of desert appleshy.  A
 flavor like honeyed apples and grapes and spring water fills your
 mouth.

 How can a drink be diluted and strengthened at the same time?  In
 flavor, this is rather like watered apple juice sweetened with honey,
 but the power of the drink still dizzies you briefly.  Everything
 shimmers in your vision a second after you swallow, but then your sight
 returns to normal.

 The subtle scent of apples and honey wafts from the cup in your hand.

 Hachachi settles back in his chair.  "Now, we shall be civilized," he
 invites.  "Please, you must be curious about my city.  If you wish to
 ask questions, I will be happy to answer them -- but first, what did
 you think?"

 [Use TALK TO to interact with characters.]

 [1] "I'm very impressed by the appleshy."
 [2] "The appleshy isn't really to my taste."

 "Oh?  Well, that's a disappointment," Hachachi says.  "I'm very fond of
 it myself, and I hoped you would be."

 [1] "Tell me more about Ferran?"
 [2] "Tell me about Caerwyn?"
 [3] "Tell me about yourself?"
 [4] "Tell me about the city?"
 [5] "Tell me about geasa?"
 [6] Say nothing.

 In response to your question, the chirop priest hesitates.  "I'm not
 sure what there is to tell," he says.  "I assist High Caerwyn, but not
 at services -- I assist her with the day-to-day of scheduling and
 planning and organizing.  Really, I'm rather boring."

 You are certain that, under the cover of fiddling with his cup,
 Hachachi is watching to see how you react.

 [1] "Tell me more about Ferran?"
 [2] "Tell me about Caerwyn?"
 [3] "Tell me about your family."
 [4] "Why did you join the priesthood?"
 [5] "Tell me about the city?"
 [6] "Tell me about geasa?"
 [7] Say nothing.

 Hachachi gazes into his cup for a moment and swirls the liquid
 reflectively.

 "High Caerwyn is devoted, yet caring," Hachachi answers.  "I think
 nothing concerns her so much as the lives that we lose -- for each time
 one man kills another, it is a failure of the Temple."  He studies you
 for a moment, clearly judging his words carefully.  "We must study
 virtue, and we must teach its path, or we will all be lost in a
 darkness without stars.  No one believes this more than she does.  If
 High Caerwyn were not bound by duty, her deeds would be great -- but
 she is bound by duty, the highest calling there is, and so her light is
 seen only in the deeds of those she guides."

 [1] "Tell me more about Ferran?"
 [2] "Tell me about your family."
 [3] "Why did you join the priesthood?"
 [4] "Tell me about the city?"
 [5] "Tell me about geasa?"
 [6] Say nothing.

 "Though I see why you would ask, I cannot speak further with you about
 geasa," Hachachi says apologetically.  "However, High Caerwyn will tell
 you all that you must know -- just as soon as your father consents."

 [1] "Tell me more about Ferran?"
 [2] "Tell me about your family."
 [3] "Why did you join the priesthood?"
 [4] "Tell me about the city?"
 [5] Say nothing.

 Hachachi says something, but you can't understand what he says -- the
 syllables are blurred and strange to your ear.
 The words you were about to speak fly away.
 [1] "What did  you say?"
 [2] "I feel strange...."
 [3] Say nothing.

 "Is it the incense?  It's a bit strong in the hallways...."  Hachachi
 gazes at you in clear concern.

 [1] "What did  you say?"
 [2] "Help me -- something's wrong!"
 [3] Say nothing.

 The subtle scent of apples and honey wafts from the cup in your hand.

 Light sparkles suddenly in the corner of your vision, but when you turn
 your head, it is gone.  A wave of dizziness washes over you.

 [Before you can try attacking Hachachi, you will need to complete this
 conversation.  Please enter a number or type REPEAT to reacquaint
 yourself with your options.]

 Hachachi tilts his cup to his lips for a moment before lowering it
 again.

 Hachachi says something in reply, but you can't understand what he
 says.  But he doesn't get up to help you -- even though the edges of
 the room have started spinning....

 [1] "What did  you say?"
 [2] Say nothing.

 Hachachi pauses to smell the aroma in his cup.

 Your grip suddenly loosens on the small porcelain cup of desert
 appleshy.  Though you reach out with your other hand to catch the cup
 as it slides from your numb fingers, the air is thick around your hand,
 slowing your motion.  A few flying drops of desert appleshy spatter
 your hand before the cup strikes the ground.  Spilled desert appleshy
 flows across the floor.  Reaching after the cup, you lose your balance,
 and the entire world slips sideways.

 You stumble first to your knees and then catch yourself on your hands.
 You try to stop your fall, but the best you can do is hit the floor
 first with your shoulder instead of your face.  Fortunately, the
 jarring pain that follows is also far away.

 Hachachi is crouching beside you.  You see his mouth moving, but you
 can't hear what he says.  You feel it, though, when he raises your
 head, slides his knee under you for support, and opens your lips with a
 clinical finger so that he can pour more desert appleshy down your
 throat.  Your faintly moaned protest chokes off beneath the draught,
 and you swallow against your will.  Everything is spinning faster and
 faster, and you are pressed down from the force of it.  Your tongue
 tastes of apples.

 Although your eyes are still open, your vision starts to fade.  There
 is a roaring in your head that is growing louder, and louder....



 (Press Space to continue.)








 The thunder resolves into the pounding roar of a seething mass of
 chiroptera.  The myriad voices, the screaming, the shouting, all blends
 together and echoes through your very bones.

 You are standing upon a high dais, and on all sides, thousands of
 chiroptera stare up at you -- the source of the incredible tumult.  You
 had not conceived of so many people in all the world, let alone so many
 of your kin in the same place, and their frenzied behavior is alien to
 your secluded existence.  Your very heartbeat and breathing feel
 dictated by the hunger of the crowd.  You are garbed formally in a
 side-split tunic of dense, gem-adorned brocade and a long skirt, but
 you are much less concerned about your attire than you are concerned by
 the long, heavy sword gripped in your hand.

 A chirop woman kneels before you.  Her tan fur is sparse from great
 age, and her hands are bound tightly behind her back with coarse rope.
 Her shoulders twitch in a shiver as the cries of the crowd pound over
 you both.

 Though the sound of the crowd all but deafens you, a woman's clarion
 voice rises above the din of the crowd.  "She is condemned.  Strike!"

 I beg your pardon?

 You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

 You step to the edge of the dais.  Thousands of eyes bore into you as
 you start down the steps, and the tone of the crowd's layered cries
 becomes suddenly, sharply hostile.  A heavy wave of disorientation
 follows.  This isn't you -- this isn't your place or where you
 belong....

 And, winging after that thought, you realize that it is nighttime.  The
 roar of the crowd fails into silence, defeated by the sudden blackness
 and the tide of stars that flow across the night sky.  The taste of
 apples fills your mouth, and stars flash across your gaze as everything
 spins away from you.


 (Press Space to continue.)








 This, in the darkness:


 There is a voice.  The voice is sharp, clear, female, and only newly
 familiar: Caerwyn's voice, asking, "What did you give her?"

 A second voice comes from the darkness.  This one is low, softer, male,
 and as little-known to you as the first.  Hachachi answers,
 "Heartkenning in dreamwine."

 Caerwyn: "You mistook her, perhaps, for a trained diviner?  You risk
 too much."

 Hachachi: "It had to be risked."

 Caerwyn: "'Use your initiative' didn't mean kill the girl.  She's
 hardly breathing."

 Hachachi: "There weren't many options and there wasn't much time."

 Caerwyn: "There was more time before you tried to kill her."

 Hachachi: "High One, if I was wrong, please forgive me.  I measured the
 dreamwine carefully -- six swallows, no more.  Her geas..."

 But the darkness is spinning, and noise comes out of the darkness -- a
 shivering, rushing noise, something more familiar than the voices.  The
 noise drowns out Hachachi's voice.  You struggle to identify this new
 sound....


 (Press Space to continue.)








 Water.  The sound is water.

 You are lying on cold stone, and you can hear a river not far away.

 Underground, Crevice
 It's hard to see much of anything here, as overhanging shelves of rock
 block almost all light from the north, and that light is a frail,
 greenish shimmer at best.  The crevice is small and cramped.  Once, it
 was a full passage, as signs of a broader tunnel do lead west, but the
 tunnel is blocked by fallen rocks.

>examine crevice
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine rocks
 The fallen rocks prevent you from proceeding west.

 When the rocks fell, we were lucky because grubmen are stupid.  Instead
 of coming to kill us, they went to pray to the grubqueen.  It would
 have been easier if they hadn't left a sentry.

 You find nothing of interest.

 There is no reflective surface nearby in which you can get a proper
 look at yourself.  However, despite your best efforts to remain tidy,
 your fur is dusty from the road, and you are not completely comfortable
 with your current appearance.  You would definitely welcome the
 opportunity to tidy up.

>examine light
 Faint, greenish light is visible to the north.

 You have to keep moving.  Eventually, the grubmen will realize that the
 falling rocks were on THIS side, and then they'll come to investigate.

 Faint, greenish light is visible to the north.

 Your thoughts circle without profit.

 There was no way to go back.  All we could do was go forward, and hope
 for a new exit somewhere past the grubmen.

 You stand up cautiously to avoid cracking your head on the low stone
 ceiling.

 Underground
 This underground space is dimly lit by crusts of phosphorescent lichen
 clinging to the cavern roof.  Ragged spires of rock jut from the
 ground, and cool, dark shadows fill the spaces between the spires.  A
 crevice opens to the south, and a broader passage leads off to the
 east.

 The only light here is a dim glow emanating from the lichen clinging to
 the cavern ceiling.

 The patch of phosphorescent lichen is too far away.

 Several waist-high stalagmites rise from the ground.

 Wait -- this isn't the way it went....


 Underground, Beside the River
 The cavern opens up beside a broad underground river.  Across the
 river, small orange fires glimmer, and contorted humanoid shapes are
 visible moving in the firelight.  These are grubmen -- an annoying, not
 particularly intelligent breed of underground dweller with a tendency
 to steal animals from human and chirop settlements.  The river flows
 through a black, impassable hole to the south, but there is room to
 walk north along the river's steep bank.

 A narrow, not-particularly-sturdy-seeming bridge stretches over the
 river to the east.  Upon the bridge is another short grubman standing
 watch -- a rather ineffective watch, at that, since the grubman is
 staring toward the fires and has not yet noticed you.


 The grubman standing on the bridge shifts anxiously from pudgy foot to
 pudgy foot.

 I wasn't alone.  The rocks caught Achimi, but Hichaesho made it
 through.

 (the translucent white grubman)
 You can't reach the translucent white grubman from here.

 The grubman standing on the bridge shifts anxiously from pudgy foot to
 pudgy foot.

 Your hands are empty.
 You are wearing a dark green goat wool cloak, a pale green tunic split
 up the sides, and a long, voluminous skirt of pale green wool.  A slim
 braided leather belt encircles your waist.  You have a pair of braided
 white leather sandals on your feet.  You are also wearing a slender
 zircon-studded bracelet and a pair of dangling zircon earrings.

 The grubman standing on the bridge shifts anxiously from pudgy foot to
 pudgy foot.

 Am I dreaming?

>examine bracelet
 You study the slender zircon-studded bracelet for a moment, but you
 notice nothing particularly unusual.

 Who ARE you, and why are you in my dream?

 You're fairly sure that you're still dreaming, but you can't figure out
 how to wake up.

 You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.


 Underground, Grubman Bridge
 This narrow, rickety bridge was designed for the weight of a grubman,
 not a chirop, and it complains softly with your every movement.  There
 are no railings.  Tinted dimly orange by the nearer grubman fires, the
 river plunges swiftly past below and flows away to the south.

 Grubman engineering is not much of a science.  The bridge trembles
 disconcertingly underfoot.  Fortunately, the grubman guarding the
 bridge is distracted and looking away from you.


 The grubman standing on the bridge shifts anxiously from pudgy foot to

 Pushing the translucent white grubman could draw his attention, and he
 doesn't look particularly friendly.  Do you really want to proceed?
 [Please respond with YES or NO.]

>yes

 You rush at the grubman, put your hands against his back, and shove!
 With a chittering wail, the grubman falls into the river and bobs away
 to the south.

 You can't see any such thing.

 there is nowhere to stand, but here, you can view the broad
 subterranean river by the light of the distant fires.  Twisted rock
 formations overhang the river, but none are within reach.

 The river is far too broad to jump, and it looks both fast and deep.

 With no further obstacle in your way, you carefully cross the bridge
 (which, by some minor miracle, does not break beneath your weight) and

 shadowed, and you can pause here to gain your bearings before
 proceeding onward.

 Or perhaps not -- because suddenly, everything changes....

 You are in a new cave, though you are standing up this time.
 Everything around you is very faintly lit by greenish-yellow
 phosphorescence, which, you realize after a moment, comes from a thin
 crust of lichen on the walls.    It's like something out of a story --
 you've never seen lichen like this before.

 Cave Alcove
 Phosphorescent lichen illumines this underground cavern with a weak,
 sickly light.  The air is humid and unpleasant.  The only route from
 here is north.

 You can't see any such thing.

 I beg your pardon?

>go north

 Faintly Lit Passage
 A narrow stream, no more than a few handsbreadths across, trickles in
 from the north and flows away to the southeast.  Thin crusts of
 phosphorescent lichen cling to the walls and ceiling, casting a weak,
 sickly light .  The air is humid and unpleasant.  Passages open north,
 south, southeast, southwest, and east from here.

>go southwest

 Phosphorescent lichen illumines the underground passage around you, but

 I've seen fungus like this, but only outside.  On trees, sometimes, in
 forests... never in caves.

 But this is a dream.  Anything can happen here.

 (first taking the thin crust of phosphorescent lichen)
 That's hardly portable.

 You're fairly sure that you're still dreaming, but you can't figure out

 You hear nothing unexpected.

 Everything smells like lichen.  Still, you think the air coming from
 the northeast might be a bit fresher.

 As you shift position, one of your knees suddenly buckles, and you
 stumble to the side.  You successfully  catch yourself against the wall
 with an outflung hand.  When you regain your balance and pull your hand
 away, you see a black handprint on the wall.

 It looks as if the lichen has been damaged on one wall, as a black
 handprint mars the faint green glow.

 Underground, Below the Night
 Suddenly, you come around a twist in the tunnel to see light shining
 down through a broad gap in the stone -- real light, moonlight, which
 washes the lichen's sickly glow into insubstantiality.  The small
 stream coursing through the cavern has its source here, for a thin
 stream of water pours down through the gap and pools at your feet
 before wandering away through the passages.

 Beside the waterfall, a crude ladder leads upward and outward to a cold
 night sky.

 You scoop up some of the stream water in your hand and drink from your
 palm.  The water is cool and tastes slightly fungal.
>look in water
 You find nothing of interest.

 That's not something you can enter.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to swim the inside.

>swim
 Glancing around, you don't see anywhere appropriate to go swimming.

 You don't see anything unusual about the narrow stream.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 Underground, Below the Night
 Moonlight shines down through a broad gap in the stone, washing the
 lichen's sickly glow into insubstantiality.  The small stream coursing
 through the cavern has its source here, for a thin stream of water
 pours down through the gap and pools at your feet before wandering away
 through the passages.

 Beside the waterfall, a crude ladder leads upward and outward to a cold
 night sky.

 You achieve nothing by this.

 Beside the waterfall, a crude ladder leads upward and outward to a cold

 Well done!

 You climb the ladder rapidly.  It is slightly slick from moisture, but
 not dangerously so, and a cool, refreshing mist envelops you as  you
 reach the top of the ladder and lift yourself onto a rocky hillside.
 Below, there are pines.

 You draw a deep breath of air, and it smells like incense.

 Incense....

 The hillside fades....



 (Press Space to continue.)








 Balanced on the edge between wakefulness and sleep, you lie in a room
 where the smell of incense rests heavily on the air.  At least one
 blanket presses your body down, but you are not uncomfortably warm.

 The sheets are fine and soft -- linen, perhaps -- and there is at least
 one heavier blanket atop them, which feels like wool.

 To the left, there is the soft, slightly echoing scrape of a door
 opening and closing.

 You give up on this unimpressive world and allow yourself to drift back
 into dreams.

 This, in the darkness:

 You are dying.

 Orange light hurls itself through darkness, and it takes the shape of a
 bird.  The light-wreathed bird burns your vision as sharply as the sun
 would, but in this dream, you can gaze without looking away.  A
 feathered crest runs over the bird's skull, and its tail is as long and
 ornate as a peacock's, painted in all the myriad colors of fire.  The
 phoenix's light parts the darkness....

 Char Cliff
 You stand upon a narrow ledge on the side of a blackened rock cliff.  A
 thin path traces over the rock to your left, but your ledge is cut off
 from the path by a twenty-foot gap.  Far overhead, the phoenix burns in
 all its glory on a course from west to east, and beyond the phoenix,
 you see a starry expanse of night sky.  Far below, you see city
 lanterns shining against the night.

 Temple of Ferran, Infirmary
 [Previous turn undone.]

 Your eyes are closed, and, in this half-dreaming state, you can't
 remember how to open them.

 Caerwyn's voice comes from your left.  Her voice is low but clear.
 "Hachachi.  How is our patient?"

 There is a pause before Hachachi responds.  His voice is very near, not
 far from your right elbow, and his soft words are heavy and slurred.
 "No change.  Still 'sleep."

 I beg your pardon?

>examine phoenix
 Looking at the phoenix is as painful as staring directly at the sun,
 and it leaves raw blue afterimages in your vision, yet you can still
 see the night sky beyond it.

 With the flick of a wingtip, the phoenix turns overhead, raining tiny
 vermilion flamelets as it shifts its course from east to south.

>examine night sky
 Among the scattered silver stars, you recognize the constellation of
 the Heron.  However, the constellation has changed from the version
 that normally shines in the night sky.  A new star shimmers upon the
 heron's breast.

 A woman descends into view upon the thin path.  In the phoenix's light,
 you see that she is a very old shaghal woman, pale with age and
 trembling with exhaustion.  Her milky white eyes are fixed upon the
 phoenix's distant radiance.  She does not look at you even for a moment
 as she hurries along her pained, stumbling course.  Upon the mountain
 breeze, you catch her anguished whisper: "Wait for me.  Wait for
 me...."

 From north to south, she passes down the cliff and is gone.

>climb down
 You must name something more substantial.

 In the near southern sky, the phoenix folds its wings and stoops.
 Engulfed in orange fire, it burns out of the heavens like a meteor and
 drops upon the city.  When it strikes, the buildings explode into
 flame.  A broad halo expands around the city.  The phoenix is gone; the
 city is gone....

 Everything is gone.

 By the light of its own burning edges, a nearby signpost advises that
 this wide road bears the ill-omened name of East Flame Street.  Wooden
 buildings blaze to the north and south, and the air reeks of scorched

 the sounds of crying, babbling people as the city's inhabitants flee

 Quiet Graveyard
 The afternoon sky is completely curtained with cloud, leaving only a
 cool white glow visible above the northern mountains where the sun
 should be.  A small willow tree drops yellow leaflets along the top of
 the low stone wall bordering the graveyard, whispering softly in the
 breeze as it does.  Several gravestones stand among the tousled green
 grass, but no one has tended them for some time, and they are
 overgrown.

 A light autumn breeze sways the willow tree and sends more leaves
 scattering down across the wall.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to dig.

>examine graves
 The featureless, water-smoothed markers stand silent sentinel above
 forgotten graves.  Grass covers their faces.

>read grave
 The featureless, water-smoothed markers stand silent sentinel above

>examine willow
 The changing season has painted almost all of the willow's leaves
 yellow, and many golden leaflets have fallen from the willow's limbs to
 adorn the wall and the grass below.  (But it was spring when you
 arrived with your father... wasn't it?)  Something glints among the
 willow's branches.

 You fail to move the grass.

 A light autumn breeze sways the willow tree and sends more leaves
 scattering down across the wall.

>examine glint
 (the glint)
 The glinting thing turns out to be a small mirror.

>take mirror
 Taken.

>examine me
 There is no reflective surface nearby in which you can get a proper
 look at yourself.  However, despite your best efforts to remain tidy,
 your fur is dusty from the road, and you are not completely comfortable
 with your current appearance.  You would definitely welcome the
 opportunity to tidy up.

>examine mirror
 The mirror reflects your surroundings, but it does not reflect you, and
 your surroundings are strangely transformed.  In the image, it is night
 rather than afternoon, and moonlit snowflakes drift across the wall in
 place of willow leaves.  In the willow's shadow, a human man stands
 leaning against the wall.

>examine man
 Gazing into the mirror, you find that you can make out very little of
 the man's features.  This is partially because his face is averted from
 the moonlight, and partially because of the willow tree's shadow, but
 it is also partially because the moonlight does not seem to illumine
 him well.  He is an indistinct shadow among indistinct shadows.

>talk to man
 You gaze into the mirror.

 [1] "Hello?"

 A light autumn breeze sways the willow tree and sends more leaves
 scattering down across the wall.

>1
 At the sound, the shadowed man in the mirror lifts his chin sharply and
 looks directly at you.

 Can you hear me, dream creature?

 [1] "Yes, I can hear you."

>1
 The shadowed man in the mirror shifts his stance to brace both of his
 hands against the wall behind him.

 Let us talk, then.

 [1] "Who are you?"
 [2] "Where am I?"

>2
 This is my grave -- or a dream of it, at least.  To the north is the
 mountain I travelled.  To the west is the city I loved, though too far
 to see from here.

 [1] "Who are you?"

>1
 There is a long pause.

 For my failure, they buried me, and they took away my name.

 [1] "They buried you?  Who is 'they'?"
 [2] "Who are your companions?"
 [3] "You are a ghost, then...."

>1
 The temple of Ferran.  High Tashreg commanded that I be buried in an
 unmarked grave, and he struck my name from all records.  If any of my
 companions endure, they may be able to speak my name to you, but I know
 that many have been lost.

 [1] "Who are your companions?"
 [2] "You said High Tashreg.  You don't mean High Caerwyn?"
 [3] "You are a ghost, then...."

>1
 I don't even know who's alive and who's dead.  Achimi is dead, but she
 died before I did.  So did Ichethe.  Hichaesho, Arleza, Draskeg...
 maybe one of them survives.  Or Hazeltricema.  The melia are
 long-lived, they say....

 [1] "You said High Tashreg.  You don't mean High Caerwyn?"
 [2] "You are a ghost, then...."

>1
 High Tashreg of the Stars.  I know no Caerwyn... but she surely came
 after my time.  If Tashreg is dead, I have no grief for it.  May he
 wander and dream, as I was bound to wander.

 [1] "You are a ghost, then...."

>1
 You are not a ghost, then.

 In the mirror, the shadowed man stands up a bit straighter.

 How did you come to be here?

 You explain how you were deceived and drugged, including, at the
 ghost's request, a description of the drink.

 It is called dreamwine, and they strengthen it with heartkenning -- a
 diviner's tool used in my day, though only carefully.  It draws you to
 your destiny... but if you have no greater destiny, no geas and no
 star, then it will draw you to every man's destiny.

 [1] "Can you help me?"

>1
 You are lost in dreams, and your dreams are poisoned by your fate.  If
 you have no destiny, then you will die.

 I died without completing my destiny.  If you accept my destiny, then
 you will live.  I can help you, if you will accept my help.

 [1] "What is your destiny?"

>1
 Ferran announces his champions to Adisha, and he charts their courses
 in the sky for the astrologers, but he does not show the path so
 clearly to those of us on the ground.  This is how I knew your drug,
 for I drank enough of the stuff while living, and drifted in enough of
 the dreams, and shed enough of my blood to diviners, and ever the
 Temple seers were there with cards and runes and mysteries to augment
 the dreams and blood-works and seemings.  They spoke of my geasa, and
 they spoke of my paths, but never would they tell me where the road
 would end.

 If, indeed, they knew.  I have had long enough to think on it, and now
 I doubt they did.

 [1] "And if I accept your destiny... what happens then?"

>1
 I will stay with you through the dreaming, and I will draw you into
 wakefulness.  But once you are awake, you will obey me and serve me
 until the end of your days.  It is an exchange: your life for my
 destiny.  Do you accept?

 [1] "I accept your offer."
 [2] "I refuse your offer."

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>2
 The shadowed man in the mirror looks surprised.

 How can you reject my offer?  This will mean your death.

 "Because, if I do not reject it, then it is also my death.  What you
 offer is no gift -- it is slavery.  You would chain me to your will --
 but I am bound already to my creche-clan.  If I make such a vow for my
 life, I am no chirop at all, but a dead thing broken on the stones.  So
 find another way, or I will die here willingly."

 There is a long pause.  The shadowed man rubs his chin for a moment.

 And your counterproposal?

 [1] Answer the ghost....

>1
 "Save my life," you say.  "Come with me.  When you see the path of your
 destiny, you may tell me, and I will listen -- but I will not be bound
 to obey."

 And why should I make this compact?  I can merely wait for the next
 lost soul, who will be more sensible than you.

 [1] Answer the ghost....

>1
 "You should make this compact because you have been buried so long that
 you have forgotten your own name.  When another comes along... if
 another comes along... you may have been buried so long that you forget
 how to speak."  After a moment, you add, "Also, because I have a star."

 I accept.

 Break the mirror.

>break mirror
 You smash the mirror across the low wall.  As the mirror breaks, it
 sounds like a shattering icicle, and a cold blast of wind whips across
 you, heavy with the scent of snow.  As you draw your next breath, the
 taste of winter comes with it, and a heavy, liquid coldness courses
 into your chest and down your limbs.  For a moment, you glimpse the
 shadowed man leaning against the low wall by the willow tree, but then,
 he is gone.

 The broken shards of mirror melt before your eyes, and they, too, are
 gone.

>look
 Quiet Graveyard
 The afternoon sky is completely curtained with cloud, leaving only a
 cool white glow visible above the northern mountains where the sun
 should be.  A small willow tree drops yellow leaflets along the top of
 the low stone wall bordering the graveyard, whispering softly in the
 breeze as it does.  Several gravestones stand among the tousled green
 grass, but no one has tended them for some time, and they are
 overgrown.

 If you can still hear me, speak to me.

>speak to him
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>talk to him
 You turn your thoughts inward.

 [1] I can hear you.

>1
 Good.  Now, we need you to leave this dream.  Walk south out of the
 graveyard.

>go south
 The willow tree whispers a soft goodbye as you pass the graveyard's
 boundary.

 An overgrown path leads down from the grassy graveyard, and you follow
 it.  As you walk, the afternoon shifts from warm to cool, and the pale
 sun sets on your right.  The sunset is shimmering and frail, but the
 clouds part to reveal a skyful of brilliantly shining stars.  Like a
 ramp supported on nothingness, the path leads up from the earth and
 into the sky, and you follow it into the night.



 (Press Space to continue.)








 Eventually, the path fades away, and only the a star-filled blackness
 surrounds you.  You pause to reorient.

 Among the Stars
 You drift at the center of a sphere of glowing silver stars.  Although
 you can recognize the constellations of the spring night sky, they are
 arranged in no resemblance to their normal positioning.  Between the
 stars, there is only blackness.

>talk to man

 [1] "How do I wake up from this?"

 Waking is very close.  We need to find my star --

 "Our star."

 "There shall be justice among people.  Ferran, be their judge, and move
 their hearts so they know justice when they see it."  And Ferran
 obeyed.'"

 has not come to me."  And in the face of the question, Ferran was
 silent and could not answer, for he had gone at Adisha's command to
 companion her, and he feared that his King was betrayed.

 'Then, Sarvath said to him, "You have been loyal to my Queen and obeyed
 her commands, and I could ask no more in this regard.  But your silence
 is against virtue.  Bind your word to your deed, that you will be
 honest in the future, and teach people honesty as well."  And Ferran

 but what of your people?  When the paths of virtue conflict, your
 people will be destroyed if they cannot choose or reject these paths at
 will.  Therefore, let dignity be the crowning virtue of a man, that he

 You awaken, and this time, you know you are awake.  You feel rested,
 refreshed, and as well as you have ever felt, aside from the too-hot
 bedclothes.  You push the blankets away immediately and sit up.

 Temple of Ferran, Infirmary
 Wool and linen blankets cover the simple linen bed where you are
 sitting.  A set of shelves on the far wall supports a water jug,
 several packets of herbs and bandages, and a miniature pottery
 alligator.  There is a door to your left and a chair to your right.

 Hachachi rises immediately from the chair as you move.  High Caerwyn
 stands in the doorway, watching you, but she steps immediately inside
 and closes the door.

 "Can you hear me?" High Caerwyn asks.

 [1] "Yes, I can hear you."

>1
 "I'm very glad of it.  There was a terrible accident.  We've been very
 worried about you."

 [1] Call her out on the lie.
 [2] Let the lie pass.

>1
 "No," you say flatly.  "There was no accident.  I was there, remember?"
 Hachachi takes a step back as you look at him, and you follow up on
 your advantage by climbing out of bed.  "You poisoned me on dreamwine
 with heartkenning.  You wanted to learn my destiny."

 [1] "How long have I been here?"
 [2] "Where is my trade
 [3] "I want my clothes.  And then I am going to leave."
 [4] "I know my destiny, now."

>2
 High Caerwyn says, "You've been ill for a long time.  He left you in
 our care."

 Liar.

 "And where is he now?" you demand.

 High Caerwyn says, "If you remain calm, I will send a messenger to see
 if he can be found."

 [1] "How long have I been here?"
 [2] "I want my clothes.  And then I am going to leave."
 [3] "I know my destiny, now."

>3
 "And what is your destiny?" High Caerwyn asks.

 "It is my destiny," you coldly inform her.  "I am walking out that
 door, with my clothing... and, by the stars you serve, I expect you
 both to stay out of my way!"

 (Press Space to continue.)








 And that is exactly what happens -- you storm into the hallway, with
 High Caerwyn and Hachachi on your heels.  Before you can corner an
 acolyte and demand your possessions, Caerwyn sends Hachachi to find
 them, and then you bar them both out of another greeting chamber (the
 Rat, this time) while you get dressed and verify that all your
 possessions are still intact.  After sliding your zircon earrings back
 into place, you open the door once more.
 The delay has given the high priestess time to regroup, but you ignore
 her entirely, and she stops just short of laying hands upon you or
 commanding Hachachi to do so.  You take advantage of the hesitation
 before the changes her mind.  It is only a short walk to the temple
 courtyard, and from there, you are free.

 That was a wild risk to take.  They might have helped you, in the long
 term -- or imprisoned you in the short term.

 "If you really thought so, you would have spoken up before now," you
 whisper back to the ghost.  "They worship the stars.  If my path is in
 the stars, they have no choice about it."

 Are you always this touchy with the clergy?

 "Only when they poison me."  But the tide of fury slowly ebbs as you
 face your situation.  You are now in the largest city you have ever
 seen, with no friends, no map, only the vaguest possible idea of where
 your father might be, and a nameless ghost riding along in your mind.

 You go south because the bridges off the Spires are south.  There's
 nothing here but temples and government, and you're sick of temples for

 The Hilltop
 A craggy, windswept patch of dirt atop the smallest in a vast range of
 mountains. A barely visible path leads down the mountain.

 You can see a cheap wooden door, a shambling zombie and a shy little
 bunny rabbit here.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine rabbit
 You bend your stalk and wave your eye buds towards the shy little bunny
 rabbit. You sense: A cute, fuzzy white rabbit.

 The little rabbit ambles downwards.

 You open a ring of pores on your upper stalk, revealing mucous-lined
 olfactory cavities in your trunk. You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine zombie
 You bend your stalk and wave your eye buds towards the shambling
 zombie. You sense: A dispossessed decaying corpse with vacant,
 unblinking eyes and slobbering lips, which is chained to the top of the
 hill by some sort of shiny black chain; any fool could tell that the
 shambling zombie is undead. In terms of fashion, the shambling zombie
 is wearing some decaying farm garments.

>taste zombie
 You open a ring of pores on your upper stalk, revealing mucous-lined
 olfactory cavities in your trunk. The shambling zombie tastes of stale
 camphor.

 That's not something you can enter.

>possess zombie
 You possess the shambling zombie.

 As you slide into the mind of your new host, you brush against neural
 resonances of the shambling zombie's former life. The decohering images
 are not clear and they are already fading: Haughty figures in purple
 robes...tied to the table...must get back to the farm...a greater
 purpose...to serve whom?...no escape...drinking the liquid...tastes
 awful...no problems now... must obey...obey the priests...climb the
 hill and wait...wait....

>examine me
 You are a possessed decaying corpse with vacant, unblinking eyes and
 dripping jaw. At the moment, you are chained to the top of the hill by
 some sort of shiny black chain; one might hazard a guess that you are
 undead. In terms of fashion, you are wearing some decaying farm
 garments.

>examine chain
 The chain runs from some shackles to the ground where it melds into the
 very stone of the mountain itself. Although apparently made of black,
 volcanic glass, the chain seems supernaturally strong and not brittle
 in the least.

>look

 The Hilltop
 A craggy, windswept patch of dirt atop the smallest in a vast range of
 mountains. A barely visible path leads down the mountain.

 You can see a fleshy white polyp and a cheap wooden door here.

>examine mountains
 White-capped mountains fade into the distance in all directions.
 Beautiful, if bleak.

>open door
 It seems jammed shut.

>hit door
 Your attack caused some damage. The cheap wooden door looks lightly
 damaged.

 The chain runs from some shackles to the ground where it melds into the
 very stone of the mountain itself. Although apparently made of black,
 volcanic glass, the chain seems supernaturally strong and not brittle
 in the least.

>hit door
 Your attack weakened it. The cheap wooden door looks moderately
 damaged.

>polyp
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>hit door
 Your attack was brilliant! The cheap wooden door looks severely
 damaged.

 The attempt fails; you cannot sense the neuropsychic matrix of the
 cheap wooden door.

>hit door
 Wham!  You obliterate it! ...perhaps you can go north now.

>examine polyp
 An anemone-like polyp, with a thick central stalk topped with waving
 fronds.

 You can't see any such thing.

>eat polpy
 You can't see any such thing.

>eat polyp
 You stretch your ample zombie jaws around the succulent polyp and
 experience the odd sensation of chewing through yourself. It is not
 pleasant.

 The Hilltop
 [Previous turn undone.]

 The chain runs from some shackles to the ground where it melds into the
 very stone of the mountain itself. Although apparently made of black,
 volcanic glass, the chain seems supernaturally strong and not brittle
 in the least.

 The chain is far stronger than you are and is not affected.

>eat chain
 Not even you can manage to eat these magical bonds!


 As you rip the rubbery glistening stalk from its roots, ever
 diminishing jets of green ichor spray the craggy hilltop.  Your
 consciousness fades...



     *** You have died ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
 The Hilltop
 [Previous turn undone.]

>kiss polyp
 Keep your mind on the game.


 You attack the fleshy white polyp!
 Unthinkable!  Your beautiful vegetative body has died! How eternally
 embarrassing -- killed by a mere zombie!

>look

 The Hilltop
 A craggy, windswept patch of dirt atop the smallest in a vast range of
 mountains. A barely visible path leads down the mountain. An opening
 leads north into the mountain itself.

 You can see a fleshy white polyp here.

>examine opening
 A square opening to the north leads into the mountain.

>go north
 You can't!  You are chained to the top of the hill by a set of obsidian
 shackles.
 The shackles are beginning to rub your right wrist raw.

>examine right wrist
 You see your right wrist, just as you would expect.

>hit chain
 The chain is far stronger than you are and is not affected.

 Choices, choices. Could you rephrase and indicate whether you mean your
 "left arm" or "right arm"?

 You savagely bite off your right arm.
 The chained zombie arm flops to the ground, wriggles a bit and then
 rests there, inert.

>possess arm
 (the shackle-bound zombie arm)
 The attempt fails; you cannot sense the neuropsychic matrix of the
 shackle-bound zombie arm.

>take arm
 (the shackle-bound zombie arm)
 You strain at the chain, but cannot pull it free from the rock.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some decaying farm garments (being worn)
   a lacquer box

>open box
 You open the lacquer box, revealing a parchment note.

>read note
 A carefully folded square of parchment paper, covered with small,
 precise writing in black ink. It says:

 My Dear Zombie,

 We, the Priests of Perigee, humble and loyal followers of Order, have
 the unfortunate duty to inform you that the Ivory Key of Obsidian
 Annihilation was lost in the year 37E121A105. In subsequent
 Pereginations, we have observed that this has not constituted an
 insurmountable inconvenience, and we trust this will again be the case.

 We remain devoted and ever-committed to achieving Alignment.

 Signed,
 Laemmli, Emphyteote of Helle.

 (the shackle-bound zombie arm)
 You strain at the chain, but cannot pull it free from the rock.



 Sloping Path
 At the top, the winding path is little more than a depression in the
 gravel and mud, but lower down the mountain, it becomes more defined,
 and perhaps even sees occasional use. Near the bottom of the path a
 dirt road is visible.

 You can see a shy little bunny rabbit here.

>KILL BUNNY

 You attack the shy little bunny rabbit!  The shy little bunny rabbit
 has stopped moving. Some would call it "dead", but of course, you know
 better.

>undo
 Sloping Path
 [Previous turn undone.]

>eat bunny's brains
 You can't see any such thing.

>eat bunny
 The shy little bunny rabbit disappears down your hideous zombie craw.
 An ominous gurgling sound erupts from deep within your body.

>undo
 Sloping Path
 [Previous turn undone.]

>smell bunny
 The shy little bunny rabbit smells of freshly cut grass.


 It doesn't appear that you can go in that direction, but you could go
 upwards to the The Hilltop, or downwards to the Dirt Road.

 The little rabbit ambles downwards.



 Dirt Road
 A wheel-rutted single lane runs east and west. You are at the bottom of
 a path that leads upwards to the peak of a small mountain, while the
 road is bordered by dense woods. There is a small signpost here.

 You can see a shy little bunny rabbit here.

>examine sign
 A tilted sign splattered with mud and road grime. A hand-painted arrow
 points east and is crudely labeled "To".

 The little rabbit flees upwards.

>read signpost
 A tilted sign splattered with mud and road grime. A hand-painted arrow

>go south

 Think again. That way won't work, but you might consider heading
 towards the east to the Road Into Town, towards the west to the
 Desolate Road, or upwards to the Sloping Path.

>go west


 Desolate Road
 To the west, you can make out a cabin at the edge of the woods. The
 woods come right to the edge of the road, except on the north side
 where there is a small strip of meadow.

>go north


 Meadow
 An unmaintained field with short grass near the road, and taller grass
 towards the surrounding woods. At the edge of the woods, there is a
 depression, and at its base, a hole. There are some rabbit tracks in
 the soft mud near the road to the south.

>look in hole
 You find nothing of interest.

>go west

 A fine idea, except for the lack of an obvious way to go in that
 direction, but you could go towards the south to the Desolate Road, or
 downwards to the Rabbit Hole Entrance.

>go down
 You are too large to fit through the Rabbit Hole Entrance.



 Desolate Road

 Nine-tenths of the Law is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives
 long descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

>go west


 Front Yard
 A small, windowless cabin to the west is framed by a lush lawn. To the
 south of the cabin, there is a small, well-tended garden. A dirt lane
 leads towards the east, where it joins up with the road into town.

>go south


 Garden
 A tidy little garden of the sort that is useful for growing medicinal
 herbs. You can see the cabin just to the north, and there is a
 vegetable garden to the east. On a more sombre note, there is a small
 cemetery to the southeast.

 You can see two herbs (an herb with blue flowers and an herb with
 violet flowers) here.

>get herbs
 That's hardly portable.

>get blue herb
 Taken.

>get violet herb
 Taken.

>possess herbs
 The attempt fails; you cannot sense the neuropsychic matrix of the
 herb.

>go southwest

 Think again. That way won't work, but you might consider heading
 towards the north to the Front Yard, towards the east to the Vegetable
 Garden, or towards the southeast to the Graveyard.

>se


 Graveyard
 A quiet, lonely corner of the property behind the cabin. In the centre
 of the graveyard is the solitary mound of grave. The pleasant garden to
 the northwest provides a comforting contrast.

 You can see an herb with yellow flowers here.


 It doesn't appear that you can go in that direction, but you could go
 towards the northwest to the Garden.

>get yellow herb
 Taken.

>go northwest


 Garden
 A tidy little garden of the sort that is useful for growing medicinal
 herbs. You can see the cabin just to the north, and there is a
 vegetable garden to the east. On a more sombre note, there is a small
 cemetery to the southeast.

>go east


 Vegetable Garden
 A small plot of land is furrowed and meticulously free of weeds. A
 large, weather-beaten stuffed wolf is mounted on a short pole. You are
 just east of the herb garden.

 You can see a nice tomato, a carrot and a stuffed wolf here.

>examine wolf
 What a pathetic looking...what?  Dog?  Wolf?  Hard to tell. The fur is
 completely worn away in places, and the wire frame pokes through. The
 whole thing is mounted on a short pole, in an awkward posture which
 suggests that the animal is running. Its teeth have been amateurishly
 painted red, although the paint is fading and chipped in places, and
 some of the teeth have even fallen out of their sockets.

>examine tomato
 A paragon amongst tomatokind, this lustrous red beauty is at the very
 point of turning ripe; it is firm and free of any blemish.

>possess wolf
 The attempt fails; you cannot sense the neuropsychic matrix of the
 stuffed wolf.

 The attempt fails; you cannot sense the neuropsychic matrix of the nice
 tomato.

 nice tomato: Taken.
 carrot: An herb with orange flowers germinates!
 Taken.
 stuffed wolf: The stuffed wolf doesn't budge. It's no use --  it is
 definitely fixed in place.

 (the herb with orange flowers)
 Taken.


 Vegetable Garden
 A small plot of land is furrowed and meticulously free of weeds. A

 just east of the herb garden.

 You can see a stuffed wolf here.

>search wolf
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine teeth
 The better to EAT you with.

>get teeth
 The stuffed wolf doesn't budge. It's no use --  it is definitely fixed
 in place.

>examine pole
 A sturdy metal pole.

>get pole
 Please leave polling to politicians. You can't take the pole.

>climb pole
 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>lick pole
 You give the stuffed wolf a nice wet lick!

 A small, windowless cabin to the west is framed by a lush lawn. To the
 south of the cabin, there is a small, well-tended garden. A dirt lane
 leads towards the east, where it joins up with the road into town.



 Front Room
 A monastically simple room, with a single chair, a low table, and a
 small fireplace. Strangely, this house has been built with no windows.
 The kitchen is to the north, and the front yard is to the east. There
 is a closed warped door which leads to a room to the west.

 You can see a table (on which is a grey potion) and a black chair (on
 which is an old man) here.

 "Zzzzzzzzz."

>get potion
 Taken.

 "Zzzzzzzzz."

>open door
 The door's rusty hinges squeak loudly.
 Yawning and blinking, the old man and searches numbly in his long robe.
 After a minute, he finds what he is looking for and withdraws a pair of
 precision-crafted spectacles and lifts them to his face.

>undo
 Front Room
 [Previous turn undone.]



 Kitchen
 A long, narrow room with a butcher's table. Below the table, there is
 some sort of large, cube-shaped device marked "recycling unit". There
 is a cabinet on the wall, with its doors closed. The only way out is
 back south to the front room.

 You can see a butcher table here.

>open cabinet
 The cabinet doors open, revealing a strange machine which is bolted to
 the wall and occupies the entire interior of the cabinet.

>examine machine
 Within the kitchen cabinet, there is an odd-looking contraption with a
 metal funnel on the top, a crank with a wooden handle on the side, and
 recess marked "bottle" at the base, below a hollow tube.

>read potion
 A potion, grey in colour, contained in a glass bottle. The bottle has a
 small label.

>inv
 You are carrying:

 Kitchen
 A long, narrow room with a butcher's table. Below the table, there is
 some sort of large, cube-shaped device marked "recycling unit". A
 cabinet built into the wall is open, showing a large machine inside.
 The only way out is back south to the front room.

 You can see a butcher table here.



 Front Room
 A monastically simple room, with a single chair, a low table, and a
 small fireplace. Strangely, this house has been built with no windows.
 The kitchen is to the north, and the front yard is to the east. There
 is a closed warped door which leads to a room to the west.

 You can see a table and a black chair (on which is an old man) here.

 "Zzzzzzzzz."


 You can't, since the warped door is in the way.

 "Zzzzzzzzz."

 The door's rusty hinges squeak loudly.
 Yawning and blinking, the old man and searches numbly in his long robe.
 After a minute, he finds what he is looking for and withdraws a pair of
 precision-crafted spectacles and lifts them to his face.



 Bedroom
 An uncomfortable, stifling bedroom with no windows. The room is barely
 large enough to accommodate the vaguely bed-like lump of furniture in
 the middle of the room. A tall, classic mirror framed in dark wood is
 wedged between the bed and the wall. A pretty silk ribbon is tastefully
 draped across the mirror, about half-way up. The mirror reflects the
 scene in the room. The only exit, an open warped door, lies to the
 east, and leads back to the front room.

 You can see a bed (on which is a pillow) here.

 From the adjoining room you hear a steady stream of irate ranting.

>close door
 The door's rusty hinges squeak loudly.

 From the adjoining room you hear a steady stream of irate ranting.

>examine door
 A cheap piece of planking set on rusty hinges. It is closed.

 From the adjoining room you hear a steady stream of irate ranting.

 A raised, stone platform vaguely reminiscent of a neolithic bed. By no
 means inviting.

 From the adjoining room you hear a steady stream of irate ranting.

 former life.

>examine tomato
 A paragon amongst tomatokind, this lustrous grey beauty is at the very
 point of turning ripe; it is firm and free of any blemish.

 That's not something you can enter.

>lie on bed
 Yes, well that would require bending, and since becoming undead, you
 have noticed a major loss of flexibility.  You are stuck in a standing
 position.

>sleep
 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.


 It doesn't appear that you can go in that direction, but you might
 consider heading towards the east to the warped door.


 You can't, since the warped door is in the way.

 The door's rusty hinges squeak loudly.
 The figure on the chair wakes and searches numbly in his long robe.
 After a minute, he finds what he is looking for and withdraws a pair of
 precision-crafted spectacles and lifts them to his face.

 From the adjoining room you hear a steady stream of irate ranting.


 Front Room
 A monastically simple room, with a single chair, a low table, and a
 small fireplace. Strangely, this house has been built with no windows.
 The kitchen is to the north, and the front yard is to the east. There
 is an open warped door which leads to a room to the west.

 You can see a table and a black chair (on which is an old man) here.

 You encounter an overwhelmingly powerful psychic barrier. The attempt
 fails entirely!

 Road Into Town
 An unpaved road runs from east to west. A small town can be seen in the
 far distance to the east, on the far side of a stone bridge.

 You can see an angry mob here.
 You recall the old man saying, "This may sting slightly..." The old man
 then merely leaned back, crossed his legs and nonchalantly doused you
 with some sort of fluid from a canister that he must have had hidden in
 the cushions. After some time, your panic has ebbed and you have
 returned to your senses. You realise that you are no longer in the
 house, but must have run off.

 The Hilltop
 A craggy, windswept patch of dirt atop the smallest in a vast range of
 mountains. A barely visible path leads down the mountain.

 You can see a cheap wooden door, a shambling zombie and a shy little
 bunny rabbit here.

>possess bunny
 You can't! The shy little bunny rabbit has not been suitably prepared!
 Not yet, at least.

 That's not something you can enter.

>possess zombie
 You possess the shambling zombie.

 As you slide into the mind of your new host, you brush against neural
 resonances of the shambling zombie's former life. The decohering images
 are not clear and they are already fading: Haughty figures in purple
 robes...tied to the table...must get back to the farm...a greater
 purpose...to serve whom?...no escape...drinking the liquid...tastes
 awful...no problems now... must obey...obey the priests...climb the
 hill and wait...wait....

 The little rabbit bounds downwards.

 Hall Of Welcome
 An austere room with plain, white marble walls and a polished floor of
 checkered black and white tile. Through the remnants of the ancient
 entranceway, only the barest sliver of pale daylight penetrates the
 room (not that it matters...for you, at least). There is a closed
 marble door at the north end of the room.

 You can see a wooden bowl (in which is a fruit) and a sculpture here.

>examine bowl
 A thick, wooden fruit bowl.

>examine fruit
 A succulent grey fruit covered with minute, almost invisible bristles.

>get bowl
 If everyone walked off with the bowl, there wouldn't be much to welcome
 other guests. It wouldn't be a very welcoming hall, now would it?
 They're not taking any chances, though, the bowl is glued to the table.

>examine sculpture
 A sculpture of an old woman in a flowing cape. The sculpture is covered
 in dust and has aged and faded to a dark grey patina. It is difficult
 to make out any detail.

>get frui
 You can't see any such thing.

>get fruit

>clean sculpture
 Ew....shiny. And a bit scary!

>examine it
 A gleaming, polished grey sculpture of an exceptionally evil-appearing,
 wizened old woman, with penetrating, bulbous, hungry eyes, and
 claw-like, gnarled hands. The sculpture radiates a restrained hatred
 and sense of injustice that yearns to revenge itself. It's hard to stop
 looking at it.

 Hall Of Wanting
 Stairs lead downwards into this room from both the north and south
 ends; an open marble door leads out of the room to the south, and a
 closed speckled door leads northward. The room is panelled in dark
 wood, and has an arched wooden ceiling and grey, stone floor. Near the
 middle of of the room, there is a sink inset into the east wall. It
 looks like there is some sort of hole in the middle of the floor near
 the north end.

>examine sink
 A large marble sink is inset partway into the wall. A single white
 porcelain knob projects from the wall above the sink. Below the knob, a
 silvery wolf head points towards the sink beneath it. The wolf's mouth
 is open. At the bottom of the sink, there is a small drain hole.

>close mouth
 That's not something you can close.

 A gleaming silver wolf's head projects from the wall above the sink.
 Its mouth is open and appears to be the end of a hollow tube.

>examine floor hole
 The floor of the room slopes down almost imperceptibly towards the
 centre of the room. Here, you find a small, oddly shaped hole. At the
 bottom of the long, narrow shaft, you can discern a key.

>get key
 You can see the key, but can't reach it; the hole in the middle of the
 floor is just too narrow and deep. How frustrating.

>turn knob
 A stream of water now flows from the wolf's mouth into the sink.

>wait
 Time passes.

>put fruit in drain
 You jam the fruit into the drain and it fits perfectly, making a tight
 seal. The water can't drain because the drain is plugged by the fruit,
 and the water overflows the marble sink. Buoyed up by the draining
 water, a wooden key has floated out of the floor hole and now rests on
 the room's floor.

 Portrait Gallery
 A long hall lined with a collection of portraits of men and women in
 priestly robes.  Some of the faces seem vaguely familiar to you.  There
 must be hexanies of them here.  One picture frame stands out in
 particular, an empty frame at the north end of the hall.  There is an
 open speckled door at the south end of the hall. To the north, there is
 an open archway which leads to an icy cavern.

>examine portraits
 These are formal portraits, painted by a master.

>examine empty frame
 The last frame towards the north end of the hall is not actually empty,
 but filled with a swirling, flat grey mist.  You think you can almost
 glimpse a face, but then it is gone.  There is a small nameplate under
 only this blank frame.

>examine nameplate

 The temperature drops as you enter this long, echoing chamber. The
 ceiling and floor seem to be coated with a clear, slippery, hard
 substance. The walls, on the whole, look rubbery. As you contemplate
 that, you realise that you have slid to the centre of the room...

 Hall Of Cold Logic
 The white ceiling and floor of the room are entirely unremarkable
 except for their unusual slickness. You can see exits near the centre
 of the north and south walls. You are dead-centre in the middle of the

>read note
 A carefully folded square of parchment paper, covered with small,
 precise writing in black ink. It says:

 My Dear Zombie,

 We, the Priests of Perigee, humble and loyal followers of Order, have
 the unfortunate duty to inform you that the Ivory Key of Obsidian
 Annihilation was lost in the year 37E121A105. In subsequent
 Pereginations, we have observed that this has not constituted an
 insurmountable inconvenience, and we trust this will again be the case.

 We remain devoted and ever-committed to achieving Alignment.

 Signed,
 Laemmli, Emphyteote of Helle.

 Vaulted Junction
 This room is remarkable for its high, arched ceiling which almost gives
 you the impression of being outside at night. An inclined metal shaft
 leads off to the west, there is some sort of tiled chamber to the east,
 and there is a frozen cavern to the south. In addition, a steep spiral
 stairway leads down. A sign is engraved into the wall near the top of
 the stairs.

 Faithful Candidate,

 We applaude your effort and ingenuity in coming this far. Now that
 preliminaries are out of the way, we can get down to the actual process
 of neuroalignment. If you fail, no matter how gruesome your death, you
 can rest assured that there will be others, and that however long it
 takes, we shall in the end select a suitable candidate. It is more
 important to assure mental compatibility than to do so hastily.

 The process of alignment may be gradual, so we have provided several
 tools, found in the adjoining chambers, to aid you along the way.

 p.s. Sorry about the lousy poetry -- it is an unavoidable part of the
 process. And really, it is the least of your problems.

 Frog Room
 A round room with domed ceiling. Every surface is covered in small,
 reflective tiles. The tiles create a mosaic depicting water and lily
 pads on the floor and scores of jumping frogs as the base of the walls.
 The scene is reinforced by a continuous chorus of croaking which
 reverberates and is reflected by the tiles. You can exit to the west. A
 small, silvery tube floats in the middle of the room, lazily tumbling,
 as if weightless.

 Front Room
 A monastically simple room, with a single chair, a low table, and a
 small fireplace. Strangely, this house has been built with no windows.
 The kitchen is to the north, and the front yard is to the east. There
 is a closed warped door which leads to a room to the west.

 You can see a table (on which is a grey potion) and a black chair (on
 which is an old man) here.

 You somersault out of the fireplace, covered with black soot and
 smelling like a barbeque.


 "Zzzzzzzzz."

>get potion

 "Zzzzzzzzz."

>examine man
 The old man is short and plump, with unkempt white hair and a stubbly
 beard of several days growth. His forehead and temples are streaked
 with deep lines, and his eyes are deeply set in dark sockets. His skin
 is pale, almost translucent, except for the dark patches under his
 eyes, and the spiderveins that run through the thin skin over his
 cheekbones. His gummy mouth harbours not a single tooth, and his flabby
 lower lip has stretched outward, draping sloppily over his double chin.
 Somewhere, his head merges into jowls which overlap his barrel chest,
 by-passing a neck entirely. He is dressed in the fine robes of a
 priest. He is sleeping comfortably on a fancy chair.

 The modern chair is discordant with its drab and mundane surroundings.
 Whilst the rest of the room is made of stone, wood and thatch, the
 metal frame of the chair gleams brilliantly and has been finely tooled
 -- clearly, not the work of the village blacksmith. The chair is
 contoured like a human body, with a head-support, arm-rests and
 elevated knee support and foot-rests. The ample cushioning is covered
 in a supple, black material and the entire chair is reclined. There is
 a small metal lever near the right arm rest, it has been pulled upwards
 towards the headrest. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the chair
 is the old man sleeping in it.

 an herb with violet flowers and an herb with yellow flowers) here.

 You can see a table and a black chair (on which is an old man) here.

 "Zzzzzzzzz."

>examine me
 You are a possessed decaying corpse with vacant, unblinking eyes and
 watering oral cavity; if you look closely around the eyes, there is no
 question but that you are undead.  You seem to be missing a right arm.
 In terms of fashion, you are wearing some decaying farm garments. At
 least the spectacles add an air of academic respectability.

 "Zzzzzzzzz."

 A paragon amongst tomatokind, this lustrous red beauty is at the very

 The old man is wearing a robe typical of the Order of the Perigee. It
 is not of recent vintage, nor has it seen soap and water in the recent
 past. The old man is lying on the robe, so you can only see one side of
 it, and you note a small pocket near the waist.

 "Zzzzzzzzz."

 You can ASK or TELL someone ABOUT something, or you can SHOW someone

 "Hmmph. I suppose. Or not. Pardon. Lost my train of thought there for a

 "I wouldn't really know."

>ask man about zombie
 "Essentially, a zombie is a hollowed-out shell of a living being, and
 unless they're possessed by some outside agency, they're not a threat
 at all, just landscaping really. My advice: avoid them if you can, and
 watch out for their drool. "

>ask man about drool
 "I find drool repulsive. Dogs, babies, zombies, you name it."

 Now there's a job skill. A small pool of saliva evaporates.

 Meadow
 An unmaintained field with short grass near the road, and taller grass
 towards the surrounding woods. At the edge of the woods, there is a
 depression, and at its base, a hole. There are some rabbit tracks in
 the soft mud near the road to the south.
 You recall the old man saying, "It's called immunity Look it up. Now
 git." The old man then whipped around, lithe as a serpent, and sprayed
 you with a fine mist of liquid. After some time, your panic has ebbed
 and you have returned to your senses. You realise that you are no
 longer in the house, but must have run off.

 Bedroom
 An uncomfortable, stifling bedroom with no windows. The room is barely
 large enough to accommodate the vaguely bed-like lump of furniture in
 the middle of the room. A tall, classic mirror framed in dark wood is
 wedged between the bed and the wall. A pretty silk ribbon is tastefully
 draped across the mirror, about half-way up. The mirror reflects the
 scene in the room. The only exit, an open warped door, lies to the
 east, and leads back to the front room.

 Dirt Road
 A wheel-rutted single lane runs east and west. You are at the bottom of
 a path that leads upwards to the peak of a small mountain, while the
 road is bordered by dense woods. There is a small signpost here.

 You can't go that way, but you could go towards the east to the Road

 Sloping Path
 At the top, the winding path is little more than a depression in the
 gravel and mud, but lower down the mountain, it becomes more defined,
 and perhaps even sees occasional use. Near the bottom of the path a
 dirt road is visible.

 You can see a shy little bunny rabbit here.

 The shy little bunny rabbit briefly obeys the laws of an alien
 geometry, bubbling and warping into impossible shapes, and then settles
 down, reassuming its familiar shape as if nothing happened.  Really,
 nothing at all.

 On the other hand it might be worth pointing out that the shy little
 bunny rabbit is holding unusually still, has a distant, almost
 catatonic expression, and that the first hints of foamy spittle have
 made their appearance at the corners of the shy little bunny rabbit's
 mouth.

 Road Into Town
 An unpaved road runs from east to west. A small town can be seen in the
 far distance to the east, on the far side of a stone bridge.

 You can see an angry mob here.
 From the crowd you overhear, "Zombies is fer killin'".

>drool on mob
 You cover the angry mob with glistening saliva. It evaporates.

 Stone Bridge
 A sturdy bridge of worked stone spans the river. The bridge is wide
 enough for two wagons to pass side-by-side. Short walls on both sides
 of the bridge prevent anyone from accidentally falling over the edge.
 The bridge runs from east to west. There isn't much to see to the west,
 except more road, but in the distance, you can see a walled town to the

 Checkpoint
 The road dips down a little here, bringing you to a checkpoint midway
 between the bridge and the outer walls of the town to the east. A small
 white building, little more than a free-standing closet, stands just to
 the north side of the road. "Sentry Post" is written above the
 entrance.

 You can see a guard here.

 The guard attacks you!

 The Hilltop
 A craggy, windswept patch of dirt atop the smallest in a vast range of
 mountains. A barely visible path leads down the mountain. An opening
 leads north into the mountain itself.

 You can see a shackle-bound zombie arm here.

 You are once again on your familiar hilltop. Your rabbit body took all
 the punishment that it could. Sensing imminent unpleasantness, and
 always motivated by an acute sense of self-preservation, you withdrew
 from your unfortunate host at the last possible moment, returning to
 both the comfort and immobility of your polypoid body.

   The sun sets and night falls, and the world is
    plunged into a flat, colourless panorama. You
  stretch your fronds, searching for another host.

  The sun rises, and you feel your strength ebbing.
                   You are alone.

   As the day progresses, you realise that you are
      wilting and that your transient unlife is
            slipping through your fronds.

         No one comes. No hosts. No escape.

 Hall Of Welcome
 An austere room with plain, white marble walls and a polished floor of
 checkered black and white tile. Through the remnants of the ancient
 entranceway, only the barest sliver of pale daylight penetrates the
 room (not that it matters...for you, at least). There is an open marble
 door at the north end of the room.

 You can see a wooden bowl (which is empty) and a sculpture here.

>go north


 Hall Of Wanting
 Stairs lead downwards into this room from both the north and south
 ends; an open marble door leads out of the room to the south, and an
 open speckled door leads northward. The room is panelled in dark wood,
 and has an arched wooden ceiling and grey, stone floor. Near the middle
 of of the room, there is a sink inset into the east wall. It looks like
 there is some sort of hole in the middle of the floor near the north
 end.

 Portrait Gallery
 A long hall lined with a collection of portraits of men and women in
 priestly robes.  Some of the faces seem vaguely familiar to you.  There
 must be hexanies of them here.  One picture frame stands out in
 particular, an empty frame at the north end of the hall.  There is an
 open speckled door at the south end of the hall. To the north, there is
 an open archway which leads to an icy cavern.

>go north

 The temperature drops as you enter this long, echoing chamber. The
 ceiling and floor seem to be coated with a clear, slippery, hard
 substance. The walls, on the whole, look rubbery. As you contemplate
 that, you realise that you have slid to the centre of the room...

 Hall Of Cold Logic
 The white ceiling and floor of the room are entirely unremarkable
 except for their unusual slickness. You can see exits near the centre
 of the north and south walls. You are dead-centre in the middle of the
 room.

>throw fruit south. g. g.
 You throw the fruit towards the south; and you catch it in mid-air,
 after it bounces off the southern wall. You are ever so gently
 propelled towards the north. You are less than halfway to the northern

 Vaulted Junction
 This room is remarkable for its high, arched ceiling which almost gives
 you the impression of being outside at night. An inclined metal shaft
 leads off to the west, there is some sort of tiled chamber to the east,
 and there is a frozen cavern to the south. In addition, a steep spiral
 stairway leads down. A sign is engraved into the wall near the top of
 the stairs.

 walls.

 Velvet Room
 An egg-shaped room which is lined floor, walls and ceiling with a lush
 grey velvet. There is a pedestal in the middle of the room. The column
 of the pedestal is covered in fabric, and the fabric has scratch marks,
 as if sliced with a razor-sharp tool. On top of the pedestal, there is
 a cat statuette. At the base of the pedestal is a small, brass plaque.
 The only exit from the room is the metal shaft to the east, which is
 very small. Next to the shaft, a grey lever sticks of out the wall.

>drop cat
 The cat reverts to the form of a stone statuette.

>get monkey
 Taken.

>go up


 Spiral Stairs
 The staircase is made of dull, black stone, and a bannister of the same
 material spirals down along the wall. The staircase is steep but
 regular, with landings every step. You can go up or down.

>go west

 It doesn't appear that you can go in that direction, but you might
 consider heading upwards to the Vaulted Junction, or downwards to the
 Bottom Of Stairwell.

>go up


 Vaulted Junction
 This room is remarkable for its high, arched ceiling which almost gives
 you the impression of being outside at night. An inclined metal shaft
 leads off to the west, there is some sort of tiled chamber to the east,
 and there is a frozen cavern to the south. In addition, a steep spiral
 stairway leads down. A sign is engraved into the wall near the top of
 the stairs.

>go west


 Metal Shaft
 A straight, metal shaft. The shaft runs east to west and there are
 exits at both ends. To the east, you can see a cavernous room, and to
 the west you catch a hint of velvet-covered walls.

>go west


 Velvet Room
 An egg-shaped room which is lined floor, walls and ceiling with a lush
 grey velvet. There is a pedestal in the middle of the room. The column
 of the pedestal is covered in fabric, and the fabric has scratch marks,
 as if sliced with a razor-sharp tool. At the base of the pedestal is a
 small, brass plaque. The only exit from the room is the metal shaft to
 the east, which is wide open. Next to the shaft, a grey lever sticks of
 out the wall.

 You can see a lacquer box which contains a parchment note
 , a fruit, a whistle, a spoiled tomato, a shy little bunny rabbit and a
 marble pedestal here.

>get all

 stairway leads down. A sign is engraved into the wall near the top of
 the stairs.

>go south

 The temperature drops as you enter this long, echoing chamber. The
 ceiling and floor seem to be coated with a clear, slippery, hard
 substance. The walls, on the whole, look rubbery. As you contemplate
 that, you realise that you have slid to the centre of the room...

 Hall Of Cold Logic
 The white ceiling and floor of the room are entirely unremarkable
 except for their unusual slickness. You can see exits near the centre
 of the north and south walls. You are dead-centre in the middle of the
 room.

>go south

 You can't get any traction!  You haven't moved at all!

>blow whistle

 Front Room
 A monastically simple room, with a single chair, a low table, and a
 small fireplace. Strangely, this house has been built with no windows.
 The kitchen is to the north, and the front yard is to the east. There
 is an open warped door which leads to a room to the west.

 You can see a table and a black chair (on which is an old man) here.

 You somersault out of the fireplace, covered with black soot and
 smelling like a barbeque.


 "Zzzzzzzzz."

>go east


 Front Yard
 A small, windowless cabin to the west is framed by a lush lawn. To the
 south of the cabin, there is a small, well-tended garden. A dirt lane
 leads towards the east, where it joins up with the road into town.

 You can see three herbs (an herb with blue flowers, an herb with violet
 flowers and an herb with yellow flowers) here.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a shy little bunny rabbit
   a spoiled tomato
   a whistle
   a fruit

   a pair of glasses (being worn)
   some decaying farm garments (being worn)

 The man in priestly robes scratches himself in his sleep.

>go north


 Kitchen
 A long, narrow room with a butcher's table. Below the table, there is
 some sort of large, cube-shaped device marked "recycling unit". A
 cabinet built into the wall is open, showing a large machine inside.
 The only way out is back south to the front room.

 You can see a butcher table here.

>look in white
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine white
 A large, white enamel box with an attached hopper. The box is flat on
 every side, and altogether unremarkable, except for the words
 "recycling unit" which appear in raised script letters on the upper
 right hand corner of the unit, above the hopper. There is something in
 the hopper.

>look in hopper
 In the hopper are two empty bottles.

>get bottle
 Taken.

>put bottle in recess
 (the empty bottle in the recess)
 The bottle snaps into the recess and the nozzle assembly descends,
 puncturing the cap.

>put herb in funnel
 The herb with grey flowers slides downwards in the funnel.

 A new potion appears in the machine's recess, and the nozzle retracts.

 Desolate Road
 To the west, you can make out a cabin at the edge of the woods. The
 woods come right to the edge of the road, except on the north side
 where there is a small strip of meadow.

>go north


 Meadow
 An unmaintained field with short grass near the road, and taller grass
 towards the surrounding woods. At the edge of the woods, there is a
 depression, and at its base, a hole. There are some rabbit tracks in
 the soft mud near the road to the south.

 leads off to the west, there is some sort of tiled chamber to the east,
 and there is a frozen cavern to the south. In addition, a steep spiral

 the stairs.

>examine key
 The soft gold of the key bears the impression of rabbit incisors, but
 the multi-hued jewels are firmly seated in their settings. The shaft
 and handle of the key are ebony. The rectangular shaft of the key
 terminates in an exceptionally intricate series of ridges and
 excavations, which suggest that it fits a very complex mechanism.
 Engraving along the shaft of the key reads "elleH ot yeK ehT" in an
 archaic script.

>go east


 Frog Room
 A round room with domed ceiling. Every surface is covered in small,
 reflective tiles. The tiles create a mosaic depicting water and lily
 pads on the floor and scores of jumping frogs as the base of the walls.
 The scene is reinforced by a continuous chorus of croaking which
 reverberates and is reflected by the tiles. You can exit to the west.

 At the bottom of the staircase, there is a large room with no
 furnishings. There is an exit to the east. Obviously, going up the
 stairs is also a consideration.

 You can see a cat here.

 Glowing Chamber
 This magnificent chamber pulses with living energy. There is a small
 inscription on the wall, and below it, a keyhole. The only exit from
 the room is to the west, back towards the stairs.

>put ebony key in keyhole
 Nothing seems to happen. How anticlimactic.

>turn ebony key
 Nothing obvious happens.

>get ebony key
 You already have the ebony key.

>unlock keyhole with ebony key
 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.
 You return to your normal size. It feels good to be normal size again.

 Bedroom
 An uncomfortable, stifling bedroom with no windows. The room is barely
 large enough to accommodate the vaguely bed-like lump of furniture in
 the middle of the room. A tall, classic mirror framed in dark wood is
 wedged between the bed and the wall. A pretty silk ribbon is tastefully
 draped across the mirror, about half-way up. The mirror reflects the
 scene in the room. The only exit, an open warped door, lies to the
 east, and leads back to the front room.

 You can see a bed (on which is a pillow) here.

>examine mirror
 A beautiful antique mirror of unparallelled craftsmanship. A pretty
 silk ribbon is draped across the mirror, about half-way up. Reflected
 in the mirror, you can see a zombie dressed in the clothes of a farmer.

>reflect key in mirror
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>touch mirror with key
 (first taking the mirror)
 The mirror doesn't budge. It's no use --  it is definitely fixed in
 place.

>look at key in mirror
 You can't see any such thing.

>touch key to mirror
 As the key contacts its reflected twin, the mass and energy of two
 universes is concentrated into the infinitely small point of contact.

 You have destroyed the very concept of existence. Nice work.

 You are a possessed decaying corpse with vacant, unblinking eyes and
 saliva-coated maw; any fool could tell that you are undead.  You seem

 Front Yard
 A small, windowless cabin to the west is framed by a lush lawn. To the
 south of the cabin, there is a small, well-tended garden. A dirt lane
 leads towards the east, where it joins up with the road into town.

 You can see two herbs (an herb with blue flowers and an herb with
 yellow flowers) here.

 Desolate Road
 To the west, you can make out a cabin at the edge of the woods. The
 woods come right to the edge of the road, except on the north side
 where there is a small strip of meadow.

>go east


 Dirt Road
 A wheel-rutted single lane runs east and west. You are at the bottom of
 a path that leads upwards to the peak of a small mountain, while the
 road is bordered by dense woods. There is a small signpost here.

>go up


 Sloping Path
 At the top, the winding path is little more than a depression in the
 gravel and mud, but lower down the mountain, it becomes more defined,
 and perhaps even sees occasional use. Near the bottom of the path a
 dirt road is visible.

>go up


 The Hilltop
 A craggy, windswept patch of dirt atop the smallest in a vast range of
 mountains. A barely visible path leads down the mountain. An opening
 leads north into the mountain itself.

 You can see a fleshy white polyp and a shackle-bound zombie arm here.

>go north


 Hall Of Welcome
 An austere room with plain, white marble walls and a polished floor of
 checkered black and white tile. Through the remnants of the ancient
 entranceway, only the barest sliver of pale daylight penetrates the
 room (not that it matters...for you, at least). There is an open marble
 door at the north end of the room.

 You can see a wooden bowl (which is empty) and a sculpture here.

>go north


 Hall Of Wanting
 Stairs lead downwards into this room from both the north and south
 ends; an open marble door leads out of the room to the south, and an
 open speckled door leads northward. The room is panelled in dark wood,
 and has an arched wooden ceiling and grey, stone floor. Near the middle
 of of the room, there is a sink inset into the east wall. It looks like
 there is some sort of hole in the middle of the floor near the north
 end.

>go north


 Portrait Gallery
 A long hall lined with a collection of portraits of men and women in
 priestly robes.  Some of the faces seem vaguely familiar to you.  There
 must be hexanies of them here.  One picture frame stands out in
 particular, an empty frame at the north end of the hall.  There is an
 open speckled door at the south end of the hall. To the north, there is
 an open archway which leads to an icy cavern.

>go north

 The temperature drops as you enter this long, echoing chamber. The
 ceiling and floor seem to be coated with a clear, slippery, hard
 substance. The walls, on the whole, look rubbery. As you contemplate
 that, you realise that you have slid to the centre of the room...

 Hall Of Cold Logic
 The white ceiling and floor of the room are entirely unremarkable
 except for their unusual slickness. You can see exits near the centre
 of the north and south walls. You are dead-centre in the middle of the
 room.

>throw fruit south
 You throw the fruit towards the south; and you catch it in mid-air,
 after it bounces off the southern wall. You are ever so gently
 propelled towards the north. You are less than halfway to the northern
 wall and equidistant between the western and eastern walls.

 northern wall and equidistant between the western and eastern walls.
 The exit is just to your north.

 Vaulted Junction
 This room is remarkable for its high, arched ceiling which almost gives
 you the impression of being outside at night. An inclined metal shaft
 leads off to the west, there is some sort of tiled chamber to the east,
 and there is a frozen cavern to the south. In addition, a steep spiral
 stairway leads down. A sign is engraved into the wall near the top of
 the stairs.

>go down


 Spiral Stairs
 The staircase is made of dull, black stone, and a bannister of the same
 material spirals down along the wall. The staircase is steep but
 regular, with landings every step. You can go up or down.

>go down


 Bottom Of Stairwell
 At the bottom of the staircase, there is a large room with no
 furnishings. There is an exit to the east. Obviously, going up the
 stairs is also a consideration.

 You can see a cat here.

>go east


 Glowing Chamber
 This magnificent chamber pulses with living energy. There is a small
 inscription on the wall, and below it, a keyhole. The only exit from
 the room is to the west, back towards the stairs.

>unlock keyhole with ivory key
 That doesn't seem to be something you can unlock.

>put ivory key in keyhole
 A strange sounds builds and builds, like someone running a set of metal
 keys slowly up and down the strings of a harp. Slowly, your
 surroundings fade.

 You are standing on the command deck of a starship.

 A large viewing screen shows a planet, with patches of blue ocean and
 land peeking through the cloud cover.

 the Law"!
