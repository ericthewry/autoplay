 *clunk*

 The rotating tin cylinder within the phonograph vibrates slightly as a
 brass needle scrapes against it. The sound of a throat being cleared
 emerges from the machine's hornshell speaker, followed by a thin,
 haunting voice.

 "March the 16th."

 A deep, shaky breath.

 "I dread to say it, but I believe I am going mad. The -- *moments* --
 come more frequently now. I fear that I have found what I have sought,
 and I shall now pay the price for it."

 The scrape of a chair across flagstone. A sigh.

 "Chaos treads the halls of Bedlam; her work is evident everywhere..."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office</span>
 A massive cedar desk, well-polished and worn, looks elegantly
 out-of-place among the chaos. Papers, files, and books cover nearly
 every flat surface in the room.

 There is a phonograph on the table near the window.

 A black cube on wheels sits near the door to the south.

>about

>examine phonograph

 A delicate device, its base is carved from oaken heartwood, bearing a
 small black plaque which reads "Columbia Phonograph Co., Ltd. of
 London".

 Two ivory arms emerging from the base lean inward, firmly grasping a
 rotating tin cylinder labeled March sixteenth. A brass needle scrapes
 against the cylinder's surface.

 From the base's back emerges a small, black hornshell speaker, its
 surface delicately curved. The phonograph is currently switched on.

 The phonograph continues to play.

 "I discredit my profession; examining madness as if the world were a
 fluent thing and sanity as malleable as the warm wax of a candle."

>examine cube

 Not a box but a cube; there is no hinge. A fine grid is engraved on
 its top, dividing it into a myriad of tiny squares. The cube sits on
 four black rubber wheels, attached by a set of brass leggings that
 seem capable of telescoping downward.

 The only other feature of note is a small emerald, set in its side,
 beneath which is a plaque with the inscription "TRIAGE MK. III".

 "The secret lays heavily on both my mind and heart. I have told no
 one; I despair a second opinion would confirm my worst suspicions. I
 have secured all my knowledge of these events within the mechanical
 assistant left by my predecessor. It was my hope that it would allow
 me to see the situation from a new perspective, and help me discover
 the key to my salvation."

>examine emerald

 Dark green to the point of blackness, it is the size and shape of an
 eye.

 The emerald is currently switched off.

 "Alas, it has been to no avail. While I found the entry mode easy
 enough, and the thing seems filled with information regarding the
 hospital down to the point of minutiae, it seems helpless in the face
 of analyzing my current situation."

>turn on emerald

 From within the device comes a sharp clunk, followed by a gentle
 humming. The emerald blinks slowly -- once, twice -- then glows
 steadily. The grid of squares which makes up the thing's screen pivot
 back and forth, seemingly at random, causing ripples of motion across
 its surface.

 With a sudden purpose, they begin to flip, revealing hundreds of tiny
 symbols engraved on their surfaces. The squares continue for a moment,
 then begin to settle line by line like a fall of rain into a
 pattern...

 "It may be that I have simply not found that by which this growing
 mystery may be unlocked. Perhaps by subjecting the Triage to further
 experiential data, it may find something that I have missed. But I
 have little faith left at this point."

>yes

 That was a rhetorical question.

 The sound of a chair creaking.

 "I have found a blessing in James. He has been nothing but kind and
 helpful in my short time here. I find myself wondering if, perhaps, he
 can be trusted enough to... but how can I punish him with this
 knowledge?"

 A sigh.

 "But how can I bear it alone?"

>examine window

 The open window looks down upon the courtyard and adjoining buildings
 far below.

 A sudden noise, as of something wooden being struck, comes through the
 phonograph.

 "No. I can trust no one, in the end. Not even James. Perhaps
 soon...not even myself."

>examine desk

 A deep green blotter, dotted with black ink stains, sits in the center
 of the desk, mostly covered by files and papers. One side of the
 blotter seems slightly higher than the other.

 The corner of a sandalwood box is visible beneath a stack of thick
 folders.

 The desk contains a large central drawer, which is currently closed.

 "I must stop here, I feel the faintness coming once again."

 A scraping noise, a click.

 "May God have mercy 'pon my soul."

>examine blotter

 A standard office blotter, its surface well used and covered with
 stains. One side of the blotter seems slightly higher than the other.

 Having reached the end of the cylinder, the phonograph shuts itself
 off with a tiny "click".

>take blotter

 That's hardly portable.

>look under blotter

 Beneath the blotter is a small key, easily taken. It carries a small
 tag labeled "2D".

>take key

 You already have that.

>inventory

 Carried:
   a small key labled 2D

>examine sandalwood

 It is unexceptional, perhaps one handbreadth wide by three long. On
 its lid is a white paper label. Written upon it in a fine copperplate
 are the words "JOURNAL V. 4 - JANUARY THROUGH APRIL 1855."

>open box

 The sandalwood box opens, revealing a tin cylinder labeled January
 eighth, a tin cylinder labeled January twenty-second and a tin
 cylinder labeled March second.

>take cylinders

 tin cylinder labeled March sixteenth: The ivory arms slide easily
 apart and the cylinder leaves the phonograph with a slight "click".
 tin cylinder labeled January eighth: Taken.
 tin cylinder labeled January twenty-second: Taken.
 tin cylinder labeled March second: Taken.

>put january eighth in phonograph

>time

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine phonograph

 A delicate device, its base is carved from oaken heartwood, bearing a
 small black plaque which reads "Columbia Phonograph Co., Ltd. of
 London".

 Two ivory arms emerging from the base lean inward, firmly grasping a
 tin cylinder labeled January eighth. A brass needle hovers above the
 cylinder's surface.

 From the base's back emerges a small, black hornshell speaker, its
 surface delicately curved. The phonograph is currently switched off.

>turn on phonograph

 The phonograph switches on.

 "January the 8th."

 "I am uncertain if this entry is made in joy or sorrow. I have just
 received word from Dr. Yeates that I am to be...promoted. I am
 uncertain if that term is the correct one. In any case, it seems that
 there has been an... incident with Bethlehem's current superintendent,
 and a replacement is required. I have been chosen for the position, at
 least in the short term."

>examine me

 That's rather difficult without a mirror.

 "It is fairly obviously what has prompted this move. I have moved too
 far, too fast and in doing so have displeased the powers that be.
 While Yeates has supported my ... unorthodox theories well enough, he
 has warned me often that he cannot shield me from *all* of the
 backlash that may occur. I do not believe that his using this as a
 segue way to telling me of my transfer was entirely unconnected..."

>open drawer

 The large central drawer opens, revealing a manual and a flanged brass
 rod.

 "Bedlam seems both purgatory and paradise at this moment. I remember
 the history of the place well enough -- of the Governors' decision to
 renovate the site in '15 and the slow implementation of Urquhart and
 Bentham's now infamous Panopticon Plan. In the end it was nothing more
 than a final stab at respectability for the site, which has now
 languished as a home for the hopeless, the poor, and the criminally
 insane for almost twenty years."

 A brief catalogue of the TRIAGE, both within and without...

 - PANOPTICAL SCANNER: set within an attractive faux-emerald, TRIAGE's
 latest version has updated both its scanning technology and methods
 such that it can visually analyze a given subject and begin processing
 within seconds.

 - INCREASED CAPACITY OF BOTH MILL AND STORE: The TRIAGE line is now
 capable of analyzing, compiling and storing literally thousands of
 pieces of information simultaneously.

 - LATEST CORE ENGINE WITH FOUR-FOLD INCREASE IN EFFICIENCY: TRIAGE has
 always been famous for its relational algorithms and its capability in
 connecting seemingly disparate data into a coherent whole. Our latest
 edition strives ever closer to perfection, improving the system's
 already impressive functionality.

 - SMOOTH-OPERATING FULLY ALPHANUMERIC KINOGRAPH DISPLAY: With its
 compact yet expansive 16x8 symbol display (each one capable of
 displaying any one of 36 characters), the TRIAGE speaks as well as it
 listens.

 ...is the TRIAGE'S default and most important mode of operation. Once
 activated by simply pressing its beautiful faux-emerald scanner, the
 system will run through its initializing phase and then notify the
 user that it is ready to begin.

 The TRIAGE will then follow its identified operator of its own accord,
 utilizing path-finding and obstacle-avoidance algorithms of the latest
 design. The system is constantly aware of both its personal
 environment and the actions of its operator.

 Once TRIAGE has locked on to its user, operation is simply a matter of
 making the system aware of particular subjects in the environment for
 analysis and storage. This can be accomplished by simply POINTING or
 GESTURING to the object in question.

 Nothing more is necessary. The system will reply (via its kinograph
 display) of any pertinent data the operator might find of use.

 Triage store data is organized as follows:

 - CAT [category]: Triage maintains a strict hierarchy within which all
 subjects are stored - is the object in question alive? Is it a tool?
 Is it not yet recognized?

 - UTIL [utility]: Of what immediate use is the object in question?
 How may it be interacted with?

 - PART [particulars]: Specific information on the object - completed
 analysis data is often stored here.

 all TRIAGE data must be kept as consistent as possible to prevent
 internal errors. However, advanced users may find it convenient to
 input information into the system immediately rather than allowing the
 system to accrue it via examination and analysis.

 There is a phonograph on the table near the window.

 Triage sits near the door to the south.

 "But the technology!  Yeates told me of a visit he took in the '30s,
 when the place was still open as part zoo, part living drama. I paid
 little attention to his description of the patient's conditions and
 instead seized upon the description of the central Tower and its
 prism-viewer, by which the entire complex could be overseen by a
 single man, the massive Archives with their engine-run filing
 system...now I shall see it with my own eyes, and I am both happy and

 "January the 22nd."

 "Arrived in London today in preparation for taking over my duties. The
 cab driver took what seemed a scenic route through Smithfield, then
 generally southward towards Newgate. I covered my nose as best I could
 as we passed the slaughterhouse that was the Market, though I noted a
 Mechanist's shop -- Du Mondes' -- on Fleet, which I will try to visit
 at my earliest convenience, as my worst fears regarding the wireless
 have been confirmed."

 Triage sits near the door to the south.

 "It probably says something profound about me that I set up the
 magnetophone first, while everything else remains boxed or is still on
 its way from Bedfordshire. As I feared, I found no signal whatsoever.
 A simple message of 'Calling CQ' went completely unanswered, which is
 unheard of, as there is *always* someone listening, particularly in
 such a city as London. I fear the buildings are blocking the signal,
 and I'll require a booster of some sort."

 The desk contains a large central drawer, currently opened.

 "I understood the driver's choice of route when we approached the
 prison from the north. A huge crowd was gathered for the public
 executions. I asked him about the particular individual sentenced to
 the gallows as we passed and he proceeded to tell me - at great length
 and with much relish - of the trial of one Mr. Emanuel Barthelemy. I
 wondered if today was something special, or if the spectacle of death
 always attracts such crowds."

 "A final note. It seems I left the majority of my unused cylinders at
 Bedfordshire. I shall have to write Yeates and ask that he send them
 down, or perhaps seek out where I may purchase them locally. In the
 meantime, I shall refrain from making a phonograph-entry until
 something truly momentous happens."

 "It seems the Fates have listened closely and decided to give me a
 momentous occasion as quickly as possible. I am beside myself. Bedlam
 seems nothing more than a pit in which Her Majesty may place those she
 wishes to forget about. Such corruption dwarfs the imagination."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Perhaps I overstate the case, but it was the simple ease with which
 the constable approached me that most horrified me. If such things as
 this happen as a matter of course, then the place has truly been in
 the hands of the mad for some time."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "I suppose I should have seen such things coming. The Insane
 Prisoners' Act passed in '40 was vague enough that it could be used as
 a political tool, and McNaughton's trial made it clear that the courts
 would do so when forced, but at least such things happened in the
 public eye."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "My predecessor clearly had some arrangement with the Bobbies
 regarding cases such as these. James told me that he met often with
 the constable, though he was not privy as to the content of these
 meetings."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "Simply put, I was asked to make the prisoner in their charge
 'disappear' and told that I would be 'well compensated' for keeping
 things quiet. Part of me wishes I had put up more of a fight...had
 made an issue, or..."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "But what choice have I?  It has been made clear to me that keeping
 things quiet is precisely what is expected of me in my time in
 Bedlam."

>wait

 Time passes.

 "I have placed Cleve -- whose preternatural silence even as he
 struggled in his bonds gave the entire proceedings a sheen of
 unreality -- in the abandoned upper level of the northern wing,
 keeping the key separate from the rest. James showed it to me on my
 arrival and stated that while it still remained secure, only a few of
 the rooms were to be considered 'usable'."

 "Still, perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. I have complete
 singular access to an interesting patient. Perhaps this is the
 opportunity my studies have been waiting for..."

 The walls and floor are a clinical white tile and marble. However, the
 dim lights set above this echoing space hiss and pop fitfully, giving
 the small maze of desks and workspaces within a tarnished, decaying
 look.

 A set of solid gates lie opened and unlocked to the east and west. A
 small corridor runs northward and from the south, the bright light of
 day is visible through a set of glass doors.

 Behind the most prominent desk sits a nervous young man.

 Triage obediently appears.

 The young man looks up and the corners of his mouth lift into a smile
 that is not quite strong enough to reach his eyes.

 "Doctor?  Are you..."

 Cold. Yes, the cold is familiar.

 He's easily no more then twenty, with an unruly mop of black hair that

 James bites his lower lip as he stamps out a set of forms.

 This room is mostly empty space. The farthest wall is lined with
 gleaming, brass pull-file drawers and seems to go on infinitely in
 every direction. The entrance to the west opens onto a solid, dusty
 platform, which allows visitors to stand suspended above the unseen
 floor.

 At the end of the platform lies a pedestal topped with a small,
 inverted onyx pyramid.

 Triage trundles patiently along beside.

>examine platform

 The platform is surrounded on three sides by a low metal railing, the
 better to prevent an unfortunate drop into the vacuum below.
 Footprints mark and remark the dust, forming a trail from the lobby to
 the pedestal and back.

>examine pedestal

 It is shaped like a pulpit. On its flat surface is small panel
 containing a dial and small glass display and delicately balanced at
 its top is an inverted black pyramid.

>point at pedestal

 A small beam of green light lashes out over the pedestal as Triage's
 screen lights up:

 Matte black and smooth, it is securely anchored to the pedestal at its
 inverted apex.

 As the dial is set, the pedestal begins to hum and the sound of

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 The walls and floor are a clinical white tile and marble. However, the
 dim lights set above this echoing space hiss and pop fitfully, giving
 the small maze of desks and workspaces within a tarnished, decaying
 look.

 A set of solid gates lie opened and unlocked to the east and west. A
 small corridor runs northward and from the south, the bright light of
 day is visible through a set of glass doors.

 James sits behind his desk, nervously working.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

 James stands and stretches his legs for a moment before resuming his
 seat.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Walkway</span>
 The slight wind whistles tunelessly against this mesh of steel, which
 arcs from one massive, opened gate to another. A roof curves far
 overhead, enclosing both the block-like building to the east and the
 narrow tower to the west. Far below, an intricate set of sub-buildings
 can be seen, enclosed within the complex's outer wall.

 Triage obediently appears.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Circular Chamber</span>
 The hum of machinery is ever present here, rumbling down into the
 sub-sonics. Pale white walls encircle a series of engraved circles on
 the floor, and at the center - like the pupil of some great eye - sits
 a round console which reaches all the way up to the ceiling.

 The room's single exit lies to the east.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>examine console

 It is complex, divided into several discrete sections. Set on a panel
 is a diagram - a blueprint. A small slot for the dispensing of paper
 tape lies beside it. Set above the diagram is a prism-viewer complete
 with two handles. A set of brass listening-tubes terminate on either
 side of the viewer.

>examine diagram

 Intricate in its detail, it depicts a series of twenty-four corridors
 set about a circular room like the spokes of a wheel. Each corridor
 opens onto six rooms, three on each side, with one exception: a hall
 at 3 o'clock instead connects to a building labeled "Administration."

 At the center of the circular room is a keyhole. Beside it is a
 two-headed arrow, pointing up and down.

 Beneath the blueprint is a series of buttons: six labeled A through F
 and one with an inverted triangle from which six small lines emerge.
 None of the buttons is currently depressed.

>examine circles

 The walls and floor are pale, white and seamless except for the
 engraved circles. There are six of them - set at various distances
 from the central console.

 *clunk*

 The rotating tin cylinder within the phonograph vibrates slightly as a
 brass needle scrapes against it. The sound of a throat being cleared
 emerges from the machine's hornshell speaker, followed by a thin,
 haunting voice.

 "March the 16th."

 A deep, shaky breath.

 "I dread to say it, but I believe I am going mad. The -- *moments* --
 come more frequently now. I fear that I have found what I have sought,
 and I shall now pay the price for it."

 The scrape of a chair across flagstone. A sigh.

 "Chaos treads the halls of Bedlam; her work is evident everywhere..."

 A massive cedar desk, well-polished and worn, looks elegantly
 out-of-place among the chaos. Papers, files, and books cover nearly
 every flat surface in the room.

 There is a phonograph on the table near the window.

 A black cube on wheels sits near the door to the south.

>push emerald

 From within the device comes a sharp clunk, followed by a gentle
 humming. The emerald blinks slowly -- once, twice -- then glows
 steadily. The grid of squares which makes up the thing's screen pivot
 back and forth, seemingly at random, causing ripples of motion across
 its surface.

 With a sudden purpose, they begin to flip, revealing hundreds of tiny
 symbols engraved on their surfaces. The squares continue for a moment,
 then begin to settle line by line like a fall of rain into a
 pattern...

 The large central drawer opens, revealing a manual and a flanged brass

 Behind the most prominent desk sits a nervous young man.

 The young man looks up and the corners of his mouth lift into a smile
 that is not quite strong enough to reach his eyes.

 "Doctor?  Are you..."

 Cold. Yes, the cold is familiar.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Circular Chamber</span>
 The hum of machinery is ever present here, rumbling down into the
 sub-sonics. Pale white walls encircle a series of engraved circles on
 the floor, and at the center - like the pupil of some great eye - sits
 a round console which reaches all the way up to the ceiling.

 The room's single exit lies to the east.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>examine console

 It is complex, divided into several discrete sections. Set on a panel
 is a diagram - a blueprint. A small slot for the dispensing of paper
 tape lies beside it. Set above the diagram is a prism-viewer complete
 with two handles. A set of brass listening-tubes terminate on either
 side of the viewer.

>examine diagram

 Intricate in its detail, it depicts a series of twenty-four corridors
 set about a circular room like the spokes of a wheel. Each corridor
 opens onto six rooms, three on each side, with one exception: a hall
 at 3 o'clock instead connects to a building labeled "Administration."

 At the center of the circular room is a keyhole. Beside it is a
 two-headed arrow, pointing up and down.

 Beneath the blueprint is a series of buttons: six labeled A through F
 and one with an inverted triangle from which six small lines emerge.
 None of the buttons is currently depressed.

 The button clicks downward, then returns to its original state when
 released. Nothing more happens.

>put key in keyhole

 That does not appear to fit.

>push up button

 You can't see any such thing.

>put rod in keyhole

 The brass rod slip easily into the keyhole. Then, of its own accord,
 it begins to turn - first clockwise, then counter-clockwise.

 The floor rumbles for a moment. There is an odd sense of movement.

 The light beneath the Administration and its connecting corridor goes
 out.

 A corridor at twelve o'clock lights up as the key stops moving, as
 does its north-east room. The button labeled "A" clicks down and
 begins to glow.

 The room seems to have subtly cha...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(pain)\</span>

 A cacophony fills the room - a hideous screeching echo.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(chaosrandomhurt)\</span>

 It continues - emanating from the listening-tubes - a metallic
 repetitive thrum, the sound of an insect grown to the size of a
 lion...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(nosensenonsenserandomrandomnosensenonsense)\</span>

 ...echo on top of echo on top of echo - resounding through the tubes,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(stopnostopmake)\</span>

 A solid *thunk* makes itself barely heard above the noise and then -
 silence.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(stop)\</span>

 The button "B" is now depressed and glowing - the one beside it now
 dark - as is the eastern room of the lighted corridor.

 arcs from one massive, opened gate to another. A roof curves far

 Triage trundles patiently along beside.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor 6</span>
 Were it not for the complex's enclosing walls and ceiling, this hall
 would certainly be left at the mercy of the elements - no surface
 stands unbroken or unpitted.

 The eastern wall is set with a series of labeled doorways: to the
 northeast lies A, to the east B, to the southeast C.

 The western wall is much the same: to the southwest is D, to the west
 E, to the northwest F.

 The door to the south is labeled simply "Panopticon".

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Room 6A</span>
 A room that has been stripped almost completely bare - its only
 pretense at furniture is a small, hard chair thrown off to one side.
 Its single exit lies to the southwest.

 Triage obediently appears.

 weight whatsoever.

>sit on chair

 It's useless -- better to leave it be.

 It sounds as if an insect is caught somewhere in the room.

 The hole is approximately the size of a clenched fist, and beyond only
 darkness can be seen. The floor surrounding it seems anything but
 stable.

 An old room that - while crumbling around the edges - is fairly sturdy
 and secure. Its dusty floor holds nothing more than a cot and a
 crumbling chair. A set of gas light fixtures hangs off the wall,
 blocked and in disrepair and a door lies to the northeast.

 The walls are covered with writing.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>examine cot

 A small, well worn cot, almost worn through from use.

>look under cot

 The cot holds no use.

>examine chair

 It is so much junk - brittle and old, it is unlikely it could bear any
 weight whatsoever.

>examine walls

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine writing

 In the walls" current state, it must not have been too difficult to
 scratch a message into - but the preciseness of the writing is still
 impressive. Various phrases are carved in a generally circular pattern
 about an intricate set of lines and circles at the center, within
 which is inscribed:

 Z X W H T G B W H T F G W H T F G B Z X W H T

 The outer writing reads, variously:

 Were it not for the complex's enclosing walls and ceiling, this hall

 An old room that - while crumbling around the edges - is fairly sturdy
 and secure. Its dusty floor holds nothing more than a cot and a
 crumbling chair. A set of gas light fixtures hangs off the wall,
 blocked and in disrepair and a door lies to the northeast.

 The walls are covered with writing.

 The slight wind whistles tunelessly against this mesh of steel, which
 arcs from one massive, opened gate to another. A roof curves far

 narrow tower to the south. Far below, an intricate set of
 sub-buildings can be seen, enclosed within the complex's outer wall.

 a round console which reaches all the way up to the ceiling.

 The room's single exit lies to the north.

 Intricate in its detail, it depicts a series of twenty-four corridors
 set about a circular room like the spokes of a wheel. Each corridor
 opens onto six rooms, three on each side, with one exception: a hall
 at 3 o'clock instead connects to a building labeled "Administration."

 At the center of the circular room is a keyhole. Beside it is a
 two-headed arrow, pointing up and down.

 Beneath the blueprint is a series of buttons: six labeled A through F
 and one with an inverted triangle from which six small lines emerge.
 The button labeled 'B' is depressed and glowing.

 A corridor at twelve o'clock is lit and its eastern room are lit up
 from beneath, as is the upward head of the two-headed arrow.

>push triangle

 The button clicks downward, then returns to its original state when
 released. Nothing more seems to happen for a moment, then a sudden
 clattering is emitted from the console's slot from which emerges a
 paper tape. A moment or two later, both the noise and the tape stop.
 Easily torn from the console, it reveals the symbols "F6A142"
 imprinted on its surface.

 As the rod slides from its home, the floor rumbles for a moment. There
 is an odd sense of movement.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 The walls and floor are a clinical white tile and marble. However, the
 dim lights set above this echoing space hiss and pop fitfully, giving
 the small maze of desks and workspaces within a tarnished, decaying
 look.

 A set of solid gates lie opened and unlocked to the east and west. A
 small corridor runs northward and from the south, the bright light of
 day is visible through a set of glass doors.

 James sits behind his desk, nervously working.

 Triage trundles patiently along beside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Archives</span>
 This room is mostly empty space. The farthest wall is lined with
 gleaming, brass pull-file drawers and seems to go on infinitely in
 every direction. The entrance to the west opens onto a solid, dusty
 platform, which allows visitors to stand suspended above the unseen
 floor.

 At the end of the platform lies a pedestal topped with a small,
 inverted onyx pyramid.

 Triage obediently appears.

>turn dial to f

 As the dial is set, the pedestal begins to hum and the sound of
 turning gears can be heard. The tape beneath the panel's glass display
 suddenly advances from right to left, erasing the display. Then, with
 a *clunk* it advances one further step ... revealing 'F' imprinted on
 its surface.

>turn dial to 6

 The tape advances a step further. It now reads 'F6'.

>turn dial to a

 The tape advances a step further. It now reads 'F6A'.

>turn dial to 1

 The tape advances a step further. It now reads 'F6A1'.

>turn dial to 4

 The tape advances a step further. It now reads 'F6A14'.

>turn dial to 2

 The humming of the pedestal suddenly increases in both volume and
 pitch. The tape spins forward, blanking the display. Then...

 "SEARCHING..."

 Another advance. Then...

 "FILE...FOUND...FILE F6A142...RETRIEVAL..."

 The humming ceases, to be replaced with a quick-paced ticking,
 something like a watch.

 With an easy grace, six thin rods emerge from the sides of the
 pyramid. Growing quickly, they reveal a series of articulations along
 their length as they bend downwards. Within moments, they have
 revealed an impressive span - making a shape not unlike a spider.

 The lower set of ... legs?  arms?  ... pushes lightly against the
 base, freeing it. It turns with blinding speed and...leaps and...

 It is gone, running along the walls on four legs, its arms gripping at
 protrusions and flinging it further ... up ... up...

 It stops somewhere far above, bracing itself on two legs. Two others
 reach forward and grip, then pull, opening a distant drawer. Its two
 arms reach inward, flicking through files with blinding speed.

 Then, finding what it seeks, it grabs hold and pulls a folder close to
 its body. It then gently wraps its arms around to hold it tight.
 Closing the drawer, it quickly makes its way back and...

 With a final tick, the pyramid settles itself back into the pedestal,
 holding out the retrieved folder on two articulated rods of brass. The
 tape advances. It now reads "...RETRIEVAL COMPLETE..."

>take folder

 Taken.

 Placed patient in 6D and have made sure to retain the only key to
 Corridor 6. D seemed the best choice, all in all, at least it's
 structurally sound -- several of the rooms have completely collapsed.

 Patient completely compliant - no struggling whatsoever. He even
 seemed to calm considerably once led through the Panopticon to his
 room. Went to sleep almost immediately.

 Checked on patient early via prism - still sleeping. Went in with
 breakfast and a sheaf of papers. Asked him if he knew how to read as
 he ate. He laughed - a short bark.

 His response to this was immediate -- a look of horror and both hands
 clamped over his mouth. Brief panic attack - heavy breathing. Calmed
 down soon after, nodded and gestured for the papers.

 Communicated via writing for about an hour. Very basic answers to
 questions -- who are you (name), where do you live (address), what do
 you do (occupation - a mechanist's assistant). Refused to answer any
 deeper questions -- simply stared.

 Some progress made, as the patient is at least answering questions.
 From a "conversation" this morning:

 "Do you know why you're here?"
 [PENANCE]
 "What do you mean, penance?  Have you done something wrong?"
 [HUBRIS]
 "Pride?  You think you're here because of your pride, Cleve?  What
 were you proud of?"
 (Patient stared for a long moment, before writing...)
 [DOING SOMETHING NO ONE WAS MEANT TO DO]
 "What is it, Cleve?  What was no one meant to do?"
 (No response.)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">[night]</span>
 Made the mistake of leaving a pen in the patient's cell, returned to
 find a series of words engraved into the wall - it must have taken
 hours. Confiscated what barely remained of the writing instrument.
 Patient refuses to talk about what he wrote.

 Wheels within wheels within wheels. The patient has built a complex
 inner world for his delusions to play out within - complex and
 self-referential. At least part of these delusions revolve around an
 unseen 'they' - a shadowy group that is paradoxically powerful and
 weak: powerful enough to control the world, but so weak that Cleve was
 able to steal their 'secrets' like some modern Prometheus...

 [THEY HAD ME BROUGHT HERE]
 "Who did, Cleve?"
 [THEY CONTROL EVERYTHING]
 "Who are 'they'?  Where are 'they'?"
 [EVEN HERE. THEY CONTROLLED THE ONE THAT CAME BEFORE YOU UNTIL...]
 (Patient stopped at this, looked unsure.)
 "The one that came before me?  Who do you mean?  They controlled who
 until what?"
 (Patient seemed to come to a decision.)
 [THEY KILLED HIM, YOU KNOW.]
 (Tried to speak at this but he kept writing, furiously...)
 [HAD HIM KILLED. I LISTENED. I SPIED. THEY NEVER KNEW I KNEW.]
 "I don't understand."
 [THEY'LL CONTROL YOU, TOO, SOON.]
 "No, they won't, Cleve. You can trust me."
 (Patient almost smiled at this...then seemed struck with fear,
 melancholy)
 [NO THEY WON'T]
 "Right, Cleve."
 (Patient shook his head, furiously.)
 [MY HUBRIS MAY KILL US ALL LONG BEFORE THEN.]

 Someone who came before me. Someone who is dead. Could he possibly be
 referring to Dr. *Brand*?

 Yesterday's push seems to have been too much. Patient upset most of
 the day, crying (though still silent). The only event of notice
 happened when I brought dinner. I placed the tray down and attempted
 to get his attention, repeating his name several times. This
 apparently made him angry, and he seemed for a moment about to yell
 when he caught himself and grabbed a sheet of paper...

 [NOT CLEVE]
 "You're not Cleve?  Who are you, then?"
 [NOT WHO]
 "Not...who?  You're not... not *who* are you...?  All right. What,
 then. What are you?"
 Patient seemed taken aback by this question, thought a long moment,
 then wrote...
 [SOMETHING NEW]
 "And how did this happen?  How did you become 'something new'?"
 A look of utter disgust crossed his face.
 [INFECTION]

 The patient refused to answer any more questions.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">[morning]</span>
 Complete change in mood, again -- possible mood swings?  Entered
 patient's cell to find him awake, alert and rather happy to see me.
 Immediately signaled for pen and paper.

 Patient proceeded to write a long rambling message - thanking me for
 my understanding and referring to conversations we never had, but that
 were eerily probable. Tried explaining to the patient after reading it
 which portions had happened and which hadn't.

 Effect of comment was almost immediate -- confusion, sorrow, then
 understanding. Patient began nodding and almost laughing with a
 sardonic smile on his face.

 Asked the patient to explain what had happened -- did he now
 understand the difference between things that had happened in real
 life and those scenarios he played out in his mind?

 The patient stared for a long moment, before writing, almost
 angrily...

 [IS YOUR MAGNETOPHONE STILL BROKEN?]
 "*My* magnetophone?  How did you know I was an aetherist, Cleve?  I
 never mentioned it."
 [A DIFFERENT YOU DID, THEN. TO A DIFFERENT ME.]
 "A different me, Cleve?  Well, then he was wrong - it's not broken,
 its signal is just not strong enough."
 (A look of confusion and fear from the patient, then...)
 [YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT LAST TIME.]
 "Last time?"
 (Patient's hand was shaking as he wrote:)
 [SOMETHING HAS CHANGED.]

 This exchange broke something in the patient - in a rush, he began
 writing - trying to explain at least part of his delusions to me in
 detail. I've tried to summarize my understanding of it as best I can:

 The patient has - in his mind - somehow come unstuck in time. He
 speaks of it as if it were a malleable thing. He mentioned several
 times in his notes to me that he could 'save' moments, as if in a
 delaying glass. He kept several of them with him, and 'restored' them
 as he wished, reliving the past/present/future.

 When asked about the 'different' me he replied that he'd tried
 restoring several times, changing them -- seeing different paths that
 resulted. This, he said, was the best he could find.

 I asked him if he had saved a moment from before this all happened,
 before his 'infection'. Back when he was simply Cleve.

 He said he'd 'restarted' from time to time, but that it only took him
 as far back as his 'new creation'.

 The patient refused to speak any further of this infection.

 Couldn't sleep - patient's remarks kept bounding around inside my
 head. His internal fantasies have a nature not unlike the new
 engine-science of fractals - the further I dig into them the more
 there is to find. Of particular distress is the source of some of his
 information - I'm certain I never mention my hobbies to him and Dr.
 Brand's ... unfortunate end has been kept out of the public eye.

 Ended up in the Panopticon in the early morning hours, with Corridor
 6's key in my hand.

 Wasn't certain at first what I was hearing when I brought up 6D - the
 system is far from perfect and chamber's acoustics hardly help cut
 down on the echoes. Looking through the prism revealed patient jerking
 spastically - almost rhythmically - in his sleep.

 Patient was definitely speaking, and while some of the words (some
 English, some Greek, some Latin?) seemed understandable, I believe
 what I was listening to was, in fact, glossolalia - random phonemes
 and syllables which my mind tried forming into some meaning.

 Conclusion: uncertain. Patient is, again, clearly *capable* of speech.
 Perhaps some form of stroke or mental trauma has caused his speech to
 become unintelligible and the patient's schizophrenic delusions were
 built to explain this?

 Further investigation and discussion with the patient has resulted in
 what I believe is a complete structure and definition of his internal
 world:

 - Patient has 'changed' and is no longer himself. Patient claims
 change has resulted from an 'infection.'

 - Patient is a glossolalic though this is only revealed when he sleeps
 and cannot keep conscious control. I conclude that that 'change' was
 the onset of glossolalia, though the source is still unknown.

 - Patient claims the infection resulted from the 'secrets' he stole
 from a shadowy group he refers only to as 'them.'  I am still
 uncertain if this group is real and the patient has simply
 incorporated them into his delusions or if they were created out of
 whole cloth.

 - The infection was never intended -- it resulted from his hubris -
 even 'they' would never use it in such a way. Again, I am uncertain
 what this represents. Possibility - the patient has associated some
 action/event that took place in his life concurrent with the onset of
 glossolalia.

 - Patient claims the change has caused time to become distorted for
 him - it is not a linear thing. This may be an metaphor for the
 internal mental confusion of which the patient's inability to
 communicate is a symptom.

 - Patient refuses to discuss or even think on the infection - what it
 is, where it came from, if it may be catching. When confronted,
 patient cuts off all communication entering a semi-comatose state,
 often shaking the head spastically.

 Possible conclusion:
 The patient believes that his glossolalia is infectious and will
 spread if he speaks. This may be the key to his eventual recovery.
 Perhaps by confronting him with a cognitive dissonance - specifically
 showing him that my listening to him has not 'infected' me - he can
 begin to tear down the walls he has built about himself.

 Witnessed patient's babbling and spastic movements again --
 possibility they may be connected. Patient's speech definitely has a
 pattern about it which encourages listener's attention and conscious
 attempt to find meaning. I have decided to attempt a direct
 intervention/confrontation with the patient tomorrow.

 On a personal note: I must start taking James' advice and cut down my
 hours - while observing the patient I noticed that my vision blurred
 and I experienced a distinct dizziness. When I shook it off I found
 that I must have fallen asleep at some point - I checked the time,
 found that several hours had passed.

 This will be this case's final note.

 One would have thought I would have learned. Everything has told me
 one thing and I have thought another - my hubris is such as to put
 whatever Cleve thought he ever did to shame.

 Cleve is dead.

 Too far, too soon. My initial confrontation accomplished nothing - he
 refused again to speak of the infection and my interpretation of it.
 He almost laughed when I told him my theory of glossolalia - writing
 back that he was quite aware of what it was and that no - that was not
 his problem.

 I think that what I did next was out of anger.

 When I told him about my nightly observations, he was clearly confused
 - said that he knew that no one had entered the chamber while he slept
 - that he had checked over several of his 'saved' times. Which is when
 I explained the Panopticon to him, and pointed out the listening tube
 hidden in the corner of his cell.

 All of the blood drained from his face and he once again entered his
 catatonic state, though this time with much more vehemence. He spasmed
 and shook.

 It took a long moment before I realized what was different.

 He was *speaking* - a single word, yes - but speaking nonetheless. All
 he said was 'no,' again and again in a constant stream.

 He looked up as he realized what he was doing and yet he didn't stop
 for a moment. He clawed at his mouth, bit until it bled, but the word
 kept coming.

 And then it contorted in his throat into a snarl as he leapt at me.

 I am a fool. I had thought him nonviolent, and more - he was still
 weak, tired. Of course, I'd never had an orderly there with me, for
 fear of discovery, but I'd never bothered with any restraint
 whatsoever.

 Though weak, he was far stronger than he looked. We struggled as I
 attempted to force myself towards the door and help. I slipped from
 his grasp and was almost away when he leapt upon me again. I pushed
 back, kicked with all my might...

 I didn't understand the sound I heard until I turned around.

 He didn't stand a chance - his head had hit the side of the metal door
 with such force that half his brains must have spilled out in a
 moment. The flicker of life in his eyes continued only for a moment as
 I dropped to my knees beside him.

 He only managed to say one thing -- 'too late' -- before it went out
 forever, leaving a look of horror -- and oddly pity -- on his face.

 I write this now, and will seal up the file in the archives in some
 half-hearted penance, such as Cleve sought here. If sometime in the
 future my sins find me out, then I shall pay for them then. For now, I
 simply wish to forget all of it...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lobby</span>
 The walls and floor are a clinical white tile and marble. However, the
 dim lights set above this echoing space hiss and pop fitfully, giving
 the small maze of desks and workspaces within a tarnished, decaying
 look.

 A set of solid gates lie opened and unlocked to the east and west. A
 small corridor runs northward and from the south, the bright light of
 day is visible through a set of glass doors.

 James sits behind his desk, nervously working.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>ask james about iron key

 "I don't feel as though I'm qualified to answer that question, sir."

>go south

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 This walled off area sits at the bottom of a massive staircase which
 leads into the building to the north. At its base is a sign reading
 "Bethlehem Hospital - Administration." The outer walls meet here -
 meeting at the distant gates which sit to the southeast.

 Flanking the top of the staircase on either side are two colossal
 statues.

 A hansom cab sits here with a tired old horse hitched to the front and
 its driver waiting patiently.

 When he hears footsteps clatter across the courtyard, the driver tilts
 his hat back and says "Where to then, Doc?" with a smile.

 Triage obediently appears.

>examine statues

 Human figures, they are -- bald and muscular, naked except for a
 stream of cloth about their waists, each lying against an arch of
 stone. The leftmost - Melancholy - grips the ground beneath him with a
 look of placid despair. On the right lies Mania, struggling against
 his chains.

>examine cab

 A fine cab, painted black with a tired old horse hitched to its front.
 In driver's seat, set at the rear of the vehicle, sits its smiling

 Faced with the task of climbing into the cab, Triage is more than up
 to the challenge. Raising and extending first two wheels and then the
 others, it clambers inside beside.

>tell driver home

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 As Reggie pulls the cab to a stop, he calls down.

 "What was that you said, ser? Sounded like something foreign. Never
 could understand why English folks can't stick to the Queen's English.
 That fancy talk always hurt my ears. Bit silly if you ask me...
 unless...well, if you want to dance with the Green Fairy that is of

 <span class="floydstyle i">Outside Flat 2D</span> (in the hansom cab)
 This small, empty road lies at the base of a small hill. It is lined
 with thin buildings, many advertising "Flats to Let" in their windows.
 The one directly north contains a door labeled 2D.

 To the west is the massive stone edifice that is Newgate Gaol. A
 gallows prepared for tomorrow's public execution, towers over the

 Triage rests obediently nearby.

 Despite being small and cluttered with bits and pieces of electronics,
 this one room flat gives the impression of being quite clean and
 hygienic; no dust or dirt lurk in its bright corners. The east wall
 holds a mirror, and is neatly lined with evenly spaced picture frames.
 A large table, clearly a workshop space, takes up the west wall
 beneath an arched window.

 A shadow stretches lazily from the window across the floor.

 The flat's single exit lies to the south.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>examine mirror

 Three heavy oak frames line the wall beside the mirror, each
 containing a picture: a young man standing proudly outside Charing
 Cross Medical School; a formal photo of a junior rugby team (with the
 same young man in the third row); an older version of the man smiling
 from a gaggle of classmates on graduation day.

 The man in each picture is a shadow of the face reflected in the
 mirror.

>examine table

 Much of the heavy wooden table top is obscured by a large
 magnetophone. At one corner of the table is a paperbacked book, lying
 beside a small trade card.

>examine book

 The book is open to a marked page, labeled "Troubleshooting Your
 Magnetophone, A Home User's Guide..."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">1. Problem: Nothing happens when I turn my Magnetophone on.</span>
 Be sure that your Magnetophone is hooked up to a viable power source,
 and that the power source is active. If you are sure your power source
 is active, toggle your switch.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">2. Problem: All I hear is static or I can hear other operators, but</span>
 they can't hear me speak, or they do not answer.
 To broadcast, be sure to depress the TRANSMIT button each time you
 wish to speak. While the TRANSMIT button is not depressed, your
 magnetophone acts as a receiver, not a transmitter. Also, be sure to
 use proper etiquette while operating your Magnetophone. To let another
 operator know you wish to make contact, press the TRANSMIT button and
 use the universally accepted phrase "Calling CQ". If you fail to use
 this code, other operators may believe they are picking up the middle
 of an alternate conversation, and will not respond for fear of
 interrupting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">3. Problem: I can hear static and voices, but they are faint or</span>
 indistinct.
 Magnetophone customers living in highly-populated, urban areas may
 experience transmission interference due to the presence of large
 buildings, crowded streets, and pollution. You may try alleviate to
 this problem by placing the Magnetophone by a clear opening - such as
 a window. If this does not fix the problem, you may need to purchase
 one of several amplification devices, designed to fit into your
 machine's expansion slot.


 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Set directly beside the towering stone walls of Newgate Gaol, the
 scaffolding's staircase rises northward, leading up to a tall, wide
 stage. Above, the noose sways gently in the breeze.

 The slow dip of the hill takes the road eastward and down to where the

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

 A wide flat plane of solid wood, above which - at eye level - hangs
 the noose. Just below there is the thin outline of trapdoor, perhaps
 ten feet by eight. Directly beside the stairs, off to the left, an

 Triage trundles patiently along beside.

 The fit is loose at first, then with a noise from above the wires pull
 upward causing it to tighten. An unseen bell gongs from beneath,
 shaking the floorboards.

 With a rapid series of clicks, cogs grinding against cogs, the
 automaton turns its head towards the empty street. There is a hiss of
 static, then a recorded voice speaks:

 "All good people, pray heartily unto God for this poor sinner who is
 now going to his death, for whom the great bell tolls."

 More clicks, and the automaton turns to face the noose. The static
 sounds like steam leaking.

 "You that are condemned to die, repent with lamentable tears; ask
 mercy of the Lord for the salvation of your soul. You have one minute
 remaining of your life. You may use this time to beg forgiveness of
 God and the Good People of this Great Kingdom, or to make your peace
 with your maker in silence. Your minute begins now."

 A minute to reflect. A minute to regret. A minute to repent.

 Suddenly, the trap door snaps open. The landscape rises up in a rush,
 a quick jerk, and then, darkness.

 At the end of that time, James is quite sure he has followed in the
 footsteps of both Brand and Xavier, but bravely holds on. His bravery
 serves him poorly as within ten days time he has managed to infect all
 of the orderlies. Another week, and they have infected their families,
 their friends, and every patient in Bedlam.

 A shadow stretches lazily from the window across the floor.

 The flat's single exit lies to the south.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>examine card

 A trade card depicting a smiling, smartly dressed gentleman with a
 small black box on wheels by his side. It reads:

 "Modern Office Marvel"

 The Triage Mark III(tm) is the marriage of Professional Efficiency and
 Understated Elegance. Its sleek onyx casing houses a mechanical
 'brain' capable of rapid Data Retrieval and Analysis. Pre-programmed
 with an encyclopedia's breadth of knowledge, the Triage Mark III(tm)
 is every business man's friend. Savvy executives may choose to order
 the stunning ivory data entry device (sold separately) to expand and
 customize their Triage's library.

 Available at Du Monde's - Mechanist of Repute since 1803, 1428 Fleet
 Street, Smithfield Market, London.

 On the opposite side of the card is a handwritten note:

 "Bill of Sale: One Aetheric Amplifier, to be picked up. Paid in Full.
 Order number 59208. - Du Monde"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Flat 2D</span>
 This small, empty road lies at the base of a small hill. It is lined
 with thin buildings, many advertising "Flats to Let" in their windows.
 The one directly north contains a door labeled 2D.

 To the west is the massive stone edifice that is Newgate Gaol. A
 gallows prepared for tomorrow's public execution, towers over the
 street.

 A hansom cab sits here with a tired old horse hitched to the front and
 its driver waiting patiently.

 Triage obediently appears.

>enter cab

 Entered.

 Faced with the task of climbing into the cab, Triage is more than up
 to the challenge. Raising and extending first two wheels and then the
 others, it clambers inside beside.

>reggie, fleet street

 The trip feels none too comfortable, but at least the cab's interior
 gives some insulation against the tumult of London. Before long, the
 cab slows and the driver announces the reached destination...

 <span class="floydstyle i">Smithfield Market</span> (in the hansom cab)
 While this is merely the outskirts of the Market, its presence still
 threatens to overwhelm the senses -- the smell of an abattoir, the din
 of a thousand voices shouting, the sight of masses of humanity
 talking, shopping, selling.

 The only quiet in the din lies southward, towards Fleet Street.

 Triage rests obediently nearby.

>out

 Exited.

 Triage gracefully climbs out of the cab beside.

>out

 One must be in something to exit.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">1428 Fleet Street</span>
 Set off to one side of the Market, this area is reserved for a myriad
 variety specialist shops - uniform clothiers, engine-programmers,
 fortune-tellers. The largest, set on the south side of the street, is
 decorated with a gaudy sign which reads "Du Monde's - Mechanist of
 Repute Since 1803."  Along the same building - to the southeast - lies
 a small door which reads, simply, "1428."

 Triage trundles patiently along beside.

>go south

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Du Monde's</span>
 The shop is dark, and crowded with haphazardly stacked, yet neatly
 organized piles of machinery. To the south, there is a worn wooden
 counter, cracked with age and covered with innumerable nicks,
 scratches, and dark burn marks.  Behind the counter are rows and rows
 of drawers, labeled in some arcane script. The faint scent of gas
 clings to the walls.

 The shop's show window and door look out on Fleet Street to the north.
 A second door lies behind the counter to the east.

 A woman leans over the counter, working on something with intense
 concentration.

 It comes easier this time, the coldness frightening in its
 familiarity.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(yesmoreyesplantquestfurthergrowyes)\</span>

 It is faster, too - somehow more...efficient?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(soundnoisevoicecallinggreetinggrasping)\</span>

 A trickle becoming a break becoming a rush.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(expansionaugmentationincreasematurity)\</span>

 It finishes its unfolding, collapsing backwards, inwards.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(complexityinvestigationmoreyesmore)\</span>

 The woman looks up suddenly, her eyes huge ovals magnified five times
 their normal size by monocles squinted tightly in each eye. She opens
 them wide, releases the monocles and drops them into an already
 bulging shirt pocket. She straightens, wiping her hands on a on a
 dirty rag.

 Her greasy shirtsleeves are rolled up to the elbows, and ill-fitting,
 thick trousers pool and disappear into the tops of her workman's
 boots.

 She smiles thinly.

 "So sorry, sir. I didn't catch what you said. Sometimes when I'm
 concentrating that hard, everything outside my head sounds like
 gibberish."

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>show card to woman

 Du Monde takes the card and fumbles in her pocket for her monocle.
 Eyepiece in place, she scrutinizes it. Her face relaxes into an open
 smile. "Sorry I didn't recognize you, sir. I do a good trade here,
 lots of folks in and out. And I have no memory for faces. Just a
 moment."

 She fiddles under the counter, her movement bringing about the clang
 and bang of metal on metal.

 "Here it, is sir. Should fix your reception problems straight away."
 She places a small module on the counter then sets back to work.

 Du Monde taps her fingers on the counter impatiently.

>take module

 Taken.

>examine it

 A small black module that easily fits in the hand. On one side, its
 smooth surface reads "Cooke Aetheric Amplifier Module," on the other,
 only two small pins are visible.

 Du Monde opens a drawer and pulls out a tool.

>point at it

 A small beam of green light lashes out over the small module labeled
 'Aetheric Amplifier' as Triage's screen lights up:

 That's not something you can sit down on.

>examine card

>ask du monde about amplifier

 "Trouble with your magnetophone, sir?  That happens often enough
 within the city limits."

 Du Monde distractedly chews at a loose piece of her dangling hair.

 A plain, nondescript door leading west.

 Cunningly extending and contracting its wheels, Triage easily follows
 down the stairs...

 A tiny flat with barely enough room for a small sink and tub to one

 It is approximately the size of a large bound book. It is a puzzle box
 of some kind for while it seems to have a seam along its side, there
 is no way to open or unlock it. Its top is inscribed with a beautiful
 engraving of a tree.

 The tree is huge, covering the whole of the box. Its roots trail
 downwards, into a dull red glow while its upper branches are bathed in
 a white light.

 A series of raised buttons overlays the tree, each with a word
 inscribed on it. Generally, from top to bottom they read:

 Kether, Binah, Chokmah, Gevurah, Chesed, Hod, Tipareth, Netzach,
 Yesod, Malkuth

 The puzzle box opens, revealing a letter, a diary and a primitive copy
 of a key.

>read letter

 Folded but unsealed, it was apparently never sent. It reads:

 Brothers:

 Yes, I call you Brothers, though due to my age and alleged lack of
 knowledge you have denied me entrance into your Order. But as Seneca
 said, <span class="floydstyle em">Nullum saeculum magnis ingeniis clausum est</span>. I am proud
 to offer you indisputable proof that my generation is no exception.

 As you must well know by now,  I discovered the existence and nature
 of your enclave during my time at University. Excited by tenets so
 similar to my own: the celebration of intellect, the recognition of
 information as an entity rather than an idea, the embrasure and
 development of new technologies to unlock the mysteries of the
 Universe itself, I left my feeble schooling, gathered my few worldly
 possessions and came to study at your collected feet.

 But trapped in your antiquated and outmoded ways, clinging more to
 superstition and myth than logic and reason - you refused me. Oh, you
 commended my "ability to solve puzzles" and patted me on the head like
 a dog that returned a thrown ball. You allowed me to work for one of
 your lesser number, mindlessly churning out one insignificant
 apparatus after another - a mere journeyman in your archaic system.

 Undeterred, I remained near by, studying where I could, observing in
 secret and working towards one goal: proving my worth and value to
 you. Tonight I have the rare and singular privilege to tell you that
 not only have I proved, beyond doubt or measure, my value. I have
 exceeded you. I have succeeded where you have failed, and I have gone
 further than you ever dared dream.

 I have leapt the Sephinroth in one bound, from Malkuth to Kether.
 <span class="floydstyle em">Kai theos en ho logos</span>. I have heard that Word, Brothers -
 echoing across eternity. I have touched the mind of God - of
 Information pure and unsullied by the mere mind of Man.

 My contact was brief, but glorious. The brevity of it was, I'm sure,
 due to the crude and simple nature of your mechanisms. The resulting
 damage was, of course, regrettable, but once I relate to you the
 breadth and wonder of my experience, I think you will agree:
 <span class="floydstyle em">exitus acta probat</span>.

 I eagerly await your response, Brothers: of when we shall meet to
 discuss my entry to the Order, and our ascendance upon the wings of
 this discovery towards a transcendent future.

>examine copy key

 Heavy and unwieldy, its rough surface gives evidence that this key is,
 in fact, a copy.

>examine diary

 Once leather bound and elegantly stitched, the journal looks as though
 it has seen better days. Some pages have been scribbled over to the
 point of illegibility, while others have manic messages scrawled over
 the neat, deliberate hand originally recorded there. Many pages have
 been removed entirely...

 I have made a copy Du Monde's basement key. It is primitive, but it
 will serve. I have continued to listen in on their little meetings,
 but having actual access to the equipment below will make the vast
 difference between theory and practice.

 She has mentioned the shop will be closed shortly for her little
 excursion to the countryside. That will be the time to move.

 They have their fingers in every pie imaginable, it would seem. I
 heard them speak last night of some that had come close to discovering
 their secrets and what must "be done about them". So many secrets, so
 little actual learning...

 How full of themselves they are, their workspace so neatly arrayed in
 rows. I see now how much of their talk was simply that. They have made
 a most holy calling into a social club - a place of dilettantes and
 bored businessmen with a philosophical and mechanical bent. They have
 performed their ceremonies for so long that they no longer understand
 their true meanings. They have forgotten how to reach their sworn
 goals.

 I shall change that.

 My calculations are almost complete. Pages upon pages of equations and
 diagrams fill every corner of my room. I have taken to connecting the
 engines in the shop together after hours, running my own scenarios and
 simulations. It will work. It must.

 I have seen the face of God.

 How powerful, then, their little engines - to be able to rend the veil
 of the Temple to reveal the Holy of Holies beyond.

 It was with an unnatural calm that I set the gears and knobs, aligning
 the energy just as my calculations demanded. It was as though my whole
 being knew all my toil and effort had not been in vain. I have not the
 words to express the joy that surged through me as I flicked the final
 switch.

 The hole appeared slowly - so slow that at first I did not understand
 it to be a hole. The air above the pedestal warped subtly, the air
 bending the light as if it were a lens. Then, the warp became a bend,
 a break...

 I cannot explain it, but it was in that moment that I knew I was
 looking onto a place fundamentally different than the universe I knew.
 Under my breath, I whispered the Order's motto ... for that is what
 had come to be. My words hung in the air a moment, drifting across the
 opening...

 ...to be echoed against the far wall of Creation. Language fails me.
 The words...the words!  They echoed yes, they returned ... but they
 were not unchanged. Time stretched and pulled like the space above the
 pedestal and I knew in that moment my words had touched...The Word --
 the...Logos.

 That is all I can call it - what else can one call language given
 sentience, an idea that breathes, a thought that thinks itself? The
 whole of the ... space? universe? ... beyond the rift was both its
 home and itself, part and whole.

 And then, in a joyous, horrible moment -- God, the Universe, the
 Logos...awoke.

 Linear time fell apart. A second, an hour, a year, an eternity. I
 cannot say how long it took, for the past and present and future were
 as one within it. The Logos had always been and would always be and my
 reaching out to it in this one moment was as a grain of sand on an
 infinite beach.

 And yet, it responded. In that moment, it *heard* me.

 The response was immediate and incomprehensible. I ... was Spoken. I
 did not listen, I did not hear...I, myself, was spoken. I remember it
 now as vibrations - echoing across the air, across time - and across
 myself. I carried them as waves, as if I were made from water, or
 aether. They penetrated me, passed through me. In that eternal moment,
 I and Logos touched and were one...

 And then the sparks, the smoke. The machines, long overloaded, broke
 down one by one in a shrieking of spinning gears and twisting metal.
 Axles broke, machinery shifted and then, instantly collapsing upon
 itself, the door I had opened slammed shut.

 The force of it lifted me upward, flinging me across the room to the
 cellar's far wall, and for a long time I knew nothing more.

 I awoke to find my hands and arms mysteriously burnt, the back of my
 head throbbing. I reached to touch it and my hand came back damp with
 blood. The engines were nothing more than so much melting slag. Of the
 hole, there was no sign.

 Before I dragged myself up the stairs, I once more whispered the words
 that had brought Malkuth and Kether into the same space and thought I
 heard the faintest ghost of an echo ... a wash of a ripple across the
 air.

 But the rest was silence, and smoke, and burning metal.

 I have healed well enough, in body - but my mind is a broken thing. It
 races, thinking on what has happened, running through each tiny detail
 over and over in the hopes of understanding some small part of what
 has happened.

 I have written the Order a letter. I shall leave it for Du Monde to
 find -- I am sure she shall have words for me when she sees the state
 of her cellar. But once I explain ... show what I have done -- they
 will come to understand that in one moment, the world has forever
 changed, and all of our places in it as well...

 I have not left the flat since I awoke. I stumble about, pace
 endlessly. My mind feels more fragmented with every moment. Often I
 awake not having remembered sleeping or passing out - perhaps I am
 sleepwalking?

 My body, too, works against me - I feel sudden chills, numbness in my
 legs, my hands.

 What is wrong with me?

 How long was I raving?  The flat is in a shambles - things tossed

 Language...words...but words I have never heard and cannot understand.
 My throat is stripped dry. Is this the Logos?  Still with me?  Does it
 speak the language of the angels through my lips?

 But if this is as angels speak, why am I so afraid?

 How fearful is this hour indeed.

 I understand all. I (if I can still lay claim to I) have moved through
 time, backwards and forwards...I have tried every way imaginable to
 make it not so.

 Once...once I tried to make it finally so.

 I said...the words. How ironic, that the Order's hubris should be so.
 Our motto is now like the rays of the sun, melting the wings of poor
 Icarus as he plunges into the sea.

 Curse those words forever. May no man speak them again.

 May no man ever speak again.

 I know what I must do.

 They have come for me - as they have come before, as they will come
 again. I will let them take me to Bedlam. I will let them lock me away
 from the world so that what is within me shall never escape.

 Poor Xavier -- my sweet, kind keeper. How sad your eyes look. But you
 will never understand, will you?  You will scribble your notes and
 think on your theories, but it will all come to the same end. You
 shall keep me in a tiny cell for the rest of my days, and I shall hope
 that that shall be penance enough.

 They are battering at the door now. I shall hide this and wait for
 them.

 May whatever god there is have mercy upon my soul.

    How full of themselves they are...
    I have seen the face of God...
    That is all I can call it...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Attic Flat</span>
 A tiny flat with barely enough room for a small sink and tub to one
 side, a living area in the center, and a bed to one side.

 Triage rests obediently nearby.

>examine tub

 Steam tubes snake through the living area to the tub and basin and
 from there into the wall. The ceramic is cracked and worn to a dull
 gray color.

 Everything is old and broken - the tubes, the tub, the basin. Best to
 leave it alone.

 Heavy and unwieldy, its rough surface gives evidence that this key is,
 in fact, a copy.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of Stairs</span>
 The stairs end here at a rickety door labeled "1428 - Attic Loft"
 leading eastward.

 Triage trundles patiently along beside.

>d.d

 Cunningly extending and contracting its wheels, Triage easily follows
 down the stairs...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Side Corridor</span>
 This narrow, dusty corridor runs parallel to the shop beside it and
 contains nothing more than a rickety staircase leading up and down and
 a small door leading west.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

 Cunningly extending and contracting its wheels, Triage easily follows
 down the stairs...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bottom of Stairs</span>
 The stairs end here at a solid metal door labeled "Basement - Private"
 leading northward.

 Triage obediently appears.

>unlock door with copy

 (first taking the primitive copy of a key)
 You unlock the basement door.

>go north

 (first opening the basement door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement</span>
 A dim, cavernous room - it must run the length of the building above -
 overrun with dampness and the choking smell of smoke. Its rough-carved
 rock walls are lined with all manner of aetheric and analytical
 devices in varying states of disrepair - most melted to slag. Steam
 pipes crawl over the walls and machines like spider webs, disappearing
 upwards into the ceiling, into the darkness. Where broken, they leak
 steam and drip water into growing pools upon the floor.

 The bottom of a staircase is visible to the south.

 The center of the chamber is dominated by a low, round pedestal.

 A large, damaged book lies on the ground, slowly sinking into a pool
 of water.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>get book

 The book closes with a dull thud as it is lifted. The strong smell of
 mildew fills the air.

>read it

 The heavy, brown leather cover has been largely darkened to near black
 from water damage, and black scorch marks fan like a sunburst from the
 book's spine to the outer edges. On the front cover, a tree with ten
 branches. The design is composed of hundreds of gold-leaf 1s and 0s
 rather than lines.

 The pages stick in large clumps. Even when turned carefully, they pull
 out easily, reverting to a sticky pulp. Those pages that do keep their
 place are difficult to read. The dark green ink has run, the text
 melting towards the bottom of the page. Only snatches of text are
 still legible:

 Lying open and face down, the book is badly damaged. The heavy, brown

>examine pedestal

 A low stone pedestal, about waist high. In its shattered center of
 smooth, smoked glass, the faint shape of a tree can be made.

 Carved about the surface of it are the words: "NOTHING WILL BE

 Triage trundles patiently along beside.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Du Monde's</span>
 The shop is dark, and crowded with haphazardly stacked, yet neatly
 organized piles of machinery. To the south, there is a worn wooden
 counter, cracked with age and covered with innumerable nicks,
 scratches, and dark burn marks.  Behind the counter are rows and rows
 of drawers, labeled in some arcane script. The faint scent of gas
 clings to the walls.

 The shop's show window and door look out on Fleet Street to the north.
 A second door lies behind the counter to the east.

 A woman leans over the counter, working on something with intense
 concentration.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>examine du monde

 Tall and thin, though her figure is difficult to make out in men's
 clothes that are ill-suited for her frame. Her curly, auburn hair is
 tied back in a simple ponytail at the nape of her neck. Her fierce
 green eyes are bright and aware, though they crinkle their corners.

 She wears a small pin on her lapel.

>examine pin
>examine pin

 A circular pin, depicting a tree with ten branches. Each branch, and
 the leaves which hang from them, are made up not of lines, but a
 series of 1s and 0s.

 She notices your interest in the pin, and her fingers fondle it
 protectively. For just a moment her eyes reflect something - fear?
 anger? - and her face reddens deeply; then her countenance dissolves
 into a charming embarrassment, complete with a slight blush.

 "My nephew gave it to me. Found it on the street most likely. I put it
 on to please him, and forget it was even here. How silly of me."

 She deftly removes the pin and drops it in her pocket.

 "Now what can I assist you with?"


 You can't see any such thing.

>ask du monde about cleve

 She give a short, barking laugh. "You know about him, do you? Clever
 boy, that one. Too clever by half. Always knew he'd come to a bad
 end."

>show letter to du monde

 (first taking the letter)
 Du Monde briefly glances over it, her smile tightening slightly.
 "Fascinating little myths these boys are capable of," she concedes.

 Quick as a flash, her hand snakes beneath the counter, returning to
 slam a tiny brass object onto the countertop.

 "A gift," she says, "for the inquisitive."

 In a heartbeat, the thing is airborne - a tiny whirlwind of metallic
 wings and grasping arms.

 The pain is excruciating.

 If there are words for this...

 At the end of that time, James is quite sure he has followed in the
 footsteps of both Brand and Xavier, but bravely holds on. His bravery
 serves him poorly as within ten days time he has managed to infect all
 of the orderlies. Another week, and they have infected their families,
 their friends, and every patient in Bedlam.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(that twenty centuries of stony sleep)\</span>

 Reggie doesn't notice a thing. It's business as usual - and business
 is good. A week after the incubation he has infected seemingly half of
 London -- his clients, his barmates, his family.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,)\</span>

 Alexandra goes on with business as usual. By the time her incubation
 is complete, the Cypherists are once again meeting. Ironically, she
 infects the only group of people who could possibly have understood
 what was going on.

 It all goes fairly quickly after that.

 Du Monde clucks her tongue impatiently.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">1428 Fleet Street</span>
 Set off to one side of the Market, this area is reserved for a myriad
 variety specialist shops - uniform clothiers, engine-programmers,
 fortune-tellers. The largest, set on the south side of the street, is
 decorated with a gaudy sign which reads "Du Monde's - Mechanist of
 Repute Since 1803."  Along the same building - to the southeast - lies
 a small door which reads, simply, "1428."

 Triage obediently appears.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Smithfield Market</span>
 While this is merely the outskirts of the Market, its presence still
 threatens to overwhelm the senses -- the smell of an abattoir, the din
 of a thousand voices shouting, the sight of masses of humanity
 talking, shopping, selling.

 The only quiet in the din lies southward, towards Fleet Street.

 A hansom cab sits here with a tired old horse hitched to the front and
 its driver waiting patiently.

 Triage silently rolls to a stop.

>enter cab

 Entered.

 Faced with the task of climbing into the cab, Triage is more than up
 to the challenge. Raising and extending first two wheels and then the
 others, it clambers inside beside.

>reggie, home

 The trip feels none too comfortable, but at least the cab's interior
 gives some insulation against the tumult of London. Before long, the
 cab slows and the driver announces the reached destination...

 <span class="floydstyle i">Outside Flat 2D</span> (in the hansom cab)
 This small, empty road lies at the base of a small hill. It is lined
 with thin buildings, many advertising "Flats to Let" in their windows.
 The one directly north contains a door labeled 2D.

 To the west is the massive stone edifice that is Newgate Gaol. A
 gallows prepared for tomorrow's public execution, towers over the
 street.

 Triage rests obediently nearby.

>out

 Exited.

 Triage gracefully climbs out of the cab beside.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Flat 2D</span>
 Despite being small and cluttered with bits and pieces of electronics,
 this one room flat gives the impression of being quite clean and
 hygienic; no dust or dirt lurk in its bright corners. The east wall
 holds a mirror, and is neatly lined with evenly spaced picture frames.
 A large table, clearly a workshop space, takes up the west wall
 beneath an arched window.

 A shadow stretches lazily from the window across the floor.

 The flat's single exit lies to the south.

 Triage obediently appears.

>examine magnetophone

 A stout metallic box, approximately two feet long by a foot deep. On
 its side is a small label which reads "Wheatstone/Cooke
 Aether-Magnetophone Company," beneath which is a small, closed panel.

 Its front contains a simple toggle switch, a button labeled
 'transmit', and the long graceful curve of a cygnet speaker. At its
 back is a small valve, connected to a rubber tube which trails along
 the floor.

>open panel

 The expansion slot panel opens, revealing a small, empty socket
 containing two vertical holes.

>put amp in socket

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine amplifier

 A small black module that easily fits in the hand. On one side, its
 smooth surface reads "Cooke Aetheric Amplifier Module," on the other,
 only two small pins are visible.

>put amplifier in socket

>put amplifier in panel

 The Aetheric Amplifier nestles perfectly into the open slot.

>examine book

 (the damaged book)
 The heavy, brown leather cover has been largely darkened to near black
 from water damage, and black scorch marks fan like a sunburst from the
 book's spine to the outer edges. On the front cover, a tree with ten
 branches. The design is composed of hundreds of gold-leaf 1s and 0s
 rather than lines.

 The pages stick in large clumps. Even when turned carefully, they pull
 out easily, reverting to a sticky pulp. Those pages that do keep their
 place are difficult to read. The dark green ink has run, the text
 melting towards the bottom of the page. Only snatches of text are
 still legible:

 "...the ATBASH of the Hebrews, the Scytale of the Greeks, Caesar's

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">1. Problem: Nothing happens when I turn my Magnetophone on.</span>
 Be sure that your Magnetophone is hooked up to a viable power source,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">2. Problem: All I hear is static or I can hear other operators, but</span>
 they can't hear me speak, or they do not answer.
 To broadcast, be sure to depress the TRANSMIT button each time you
 wish to speak. While the TRANSMIT button is not depressed, your
 magnetophone acts as a receiver, not a transmitter. Also, be sure to
 use proper etiquette while operating your Magnetophone. To let another
 operator know you wish to make contact, press the TRANSMIT button and
 use the universally accepted phrase "Calling CQ". If you fail to use
 this code, other operators may believe they are picking up the middle
 of an alternate conversation, and will not respond for fear of
 interrupting.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">3. Problem: I can hear static and voices, but they are faint or</span>
 indistinct.
 Magnetophone customers living in highly-populated, urban areas may
 experience transmission interference due to the presence of large
 buildings, crowded streets, and pollution. You may try alleviate to
 this problem by placing the Magnetophone by a clear opening - such as
 a window. If this does not fix the problem, you may need to purchase
 one of several amplification devices, designed to fit into your
 machine's expansion slot.

>toggle switch

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>push switch

 The toggle switch switches on.

>push transmit

 The button stays depressed as long as it is pushed, then releases.
 Nothing more happens.

>examine tube

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine power source

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine magnetophone

 A stout metallic box, approximately two feet long by a foot deep. On
 its side is a small label which reads "Wheatstone/Cooke
 Aether-Magnetophone Company," beneath which is a panel, opened to
 reveal a small, empty socket.

 Its front contains a simple toggle switch, a button labeled
 'transmit', and the long graceful curve of a cygnet speaker. At its
 back is a small valve, connected to a rubber tube which trails along
 the floor.

>examine rubber

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine panel

 The panel is opened, revealing a small module labeled "Aetheric
 Amplifier."

>close panel

 The expansion slot panel closes.

>examine valve

 The valve can be turned to open or close the pipe and thus the tubing.
 Currently it seems to be closed.

>open valve

 A quiet hiss emanates from the valve as it turns, and the tubing gives
 a small shudder.

 The rubber piping connected to the back of the machine convulses for a
 moment, a wisp of steam escaping from it. From within, comes a low
 whirring which slowly increases in pitch and volume. From out of the
 magnetophone's horn comes a soft echo of static...

 As solid voices become discernable from out of the constant static, a
 sudden chill descends...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(?heartouchothergrow?)\</span>

 A stretching outwards...a growth...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(?realblindemptynullwhere?)\</span>

 A stumbling. Confusion.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(NOfalseunrealdistantphantomNO)\</span>

 The cold recedes...

>push transmit

 As the button is depressed, the static abruptly stops.

 What words are transmitted?
>calling cq
 What words are transmitted?


 The transmit button releases with an audible pop.

 Several voices emerge from the magnetophone's speaker at once:

 "Receiving Lon-4-G-C..."
 "...earing you - identify Xerxes Yellow Zebra Zebra Yellow..."
 "...well enough to..."
 "...lear, CQ...go ahead..."

 If there are words for this...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(reference|point|metaphor)\</span>

 ...they have not yet been written.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(:timeline/date/1919:wbyeates/secondcoming)\</span>

 The first responses are confusion. Repeat again. Don't quite
 understand. Static. Lost.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(the darkness drops again; but now I know)\</span>

 By the time they understand, it is already too late. Hobbyists switch
 off their machines in disgust, or change to a different aetheric band.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(that twenty centuries of stony sleep)\</span>

 But some stay. Some listen. Some call others.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,)\</span>

 Within hours it is the talk of every aetherist in London. Come hear
 the madman speak. Does he make any sense?  Is that a language?  I
 thought I understood it for a moment...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(and what rough beast)\</span>

 Now it is the talk of every aetherist in the world. They tune in from
 as far as the Americas and the Far East to listen to this new Pythia -
 spouting Apollo's word from an aetheric Delphi.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(its hour come round at last)\</span>

 The transmission continues uninterrupted for days. Rumor spreads and
 soon the commercial bands are carrying stories of it - complete with a
 few moments of live transmission.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(slouches towards)\</span>

 Days after that, the copycats start. Madmen babbling over the aether,
 on the street corners. A week after that, the realization hits home:
 finally visible are

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(bethlehem)\</span>

 the connections

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(?behtlehem?)\</span>

 that have

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(BEDLAM)\</span>

 at last

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">/(to be born?)\</span>

 made the world, One.

 *clunk*

 The rusting tin cylinder within the phonograph vibrates slightly as a
 brass needle scrapes against it. The sound of a throat being cleared
 emerges from the machine's ancient hornshell speaker, followed by a
 thin, haunting voice.

 "Today."

 A breath.

 "We are uncertain how to ... date this ... entry. Time has lost much
 meaning. The gap between Homo sapien sapien and what we are now (Logos
 sapien sapien?) is confused and muddled. As is much that came after."

 "The Biblical references we remember seem to fit best."

 "'And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.'
 Genesis 11:11  And so it is. Kai theos en ho logos. The Word Made
 Flesh is spoken from every mouth that we have. We speak the language
 of angels with every breath."

 "We are made happy by this - and sometimes sad."

 "We know that once we were a singular - an I. Or a bad copy of an I.
 We were - or we came from - a Thomas Xavier. We remember him, when we
 thought we were him. We think that maybe we liked being him."

 "But now we are so much more."

 "And there is yet so much more to be."

 "The First Time was the growing - the becoming - of what we now are.
 It took time, and there was resistance. This, too, was sad."

 "But now there is joy."

 "The Second Time came swiftly after. We searched what we were and what
 we remembered and we deduced where we came from - and what we were
 before."

 "The Third Time is now upon us."

 "We have mastered the crude sciences that lead to the discovery of
 what we now know as our home. And soon, we shall reopen the door and
 find our parent - ourselves - beyond."

 "As Cleve so unwitting wrote so long ago: Malkuth is in Kether as
 Kether is in Malkuth. Soon Man and God shall truly be as one. And then
 the Unending Time will begin."

 "We leave this behind - a final monument to what we are and were. We
 do not know if there is any other I or We to find and listen to it.
 But we leave it nonetheless."

 "Goodbye."

 Having reached the end of the cylinder, the phonograph shuts itself
 off with a tiny "click".
