 You've heard about them from others. You've even had them yourself:
 classes that seem to last forever. But this one takes the biscuit. You
 wonder what possessed you to sign up for <span class="floydstyle em">Celtic Elements in Early</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Teutonic Settlements</span>: a field of study so narrow and boring,
 you'd wonder they would award doctorates in it. But they must, for the
 chap running the lecture has one.

 You glance down at the notebook in your hands, but the thought of
 recording all this boredom for posterity doesn't thrill you. Instead,
 you look around the hall, wondering if you could sneak out and find
 something better to do with your time.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Lecture Hall</span> (on the seat)
 An ordinary, run-of-the-mill lecture hall. Its many banks of tiered
 seats run up towards the large and heavy double doors at the west end.
 Down at floor level, at the east end of the hall, the professor is
 teaching the lesson. Tiers upon tiers of bored students sit in the
 seats.

 An empty cup of yogurt, the remains of your elevenses, sits on the
 desk.

>examine me


 Intelligent and easygoing, you've done well during your two years at
 university. The students and fellows at Worrell College accept you,
 even though you only joined the college this year. You're a bit
 concerned about this term's chemistry course, but your tutor thought
 it would make for a good broadening of your Classics focus.

 At the moment, you're dressed in your usual casual Classics-student
 type clothes: neatly pressed shirt, and a smart pair of trousers.
 Worrell is one of the more traditional colleges at the university, and
 your attire is certainly smart enough to fit the bill.

 "Now if you remember, in the course syllabus, I mentioned we would
 begin by discussing the settling instincts of early German nomad
 tribes," lectures the professor.

>sleep


 You've had so many all-night swotting sessions this year you're good
 for a long while yet.

 "It's fascinating to note that as the early Teutons shifted from
 nomads to village-dwellers, they started by building huts," declaims
 the professor.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   your clothes (being worn)
   an exercise book

 "But what is particularly fascinating is the fact that, under some
 circumstances..." intones the professor.

>examine cup


 A fly crawls slowly along the rim of the empty cup of raspberry
 yogurt, nosing around the silvery foil flap that used to cover the
 cup.

 "... and some very unique conditions, when parts of these huts have
 collapsed in certain ways..." drawls the professor.

 You really feel you must get out of this room.

>lick cup


 Ah, the tantalising flavour of raspberry yogurt.

 "... they could, by expert scholars, be reasoned to have been built in
 the shape of early Celtic crosses," mumbles the professor.

>take cup


 You start to move your hand towards the yogurt cup, but you hit it
 accidentally, and knock it to the floor, where it rolls underneath the
 desk.

 "Indeed, it is this very fact upon which my whole research has been
 founded," rambles the professor.

>take cup


 But the yogurt has rolled under the desk!

 "It was some thirty years ago now I first received a grant from the
 Teutonic Study Foundation..." maunders the professor.

 A brief low rumbling comes from under your desk.

>look under desk


 You look under the desk. To your surprise the yogurt cup has vanished
 completely. Instead, a strange green glowing ball sits there. As you
 watch, it expands suddenly and bursts open into a large green portal,
 throwing you, the desk and all its contents into the air as it does
 so.

 "Students shall refrain from moving the furniture," says the professor
 as you land with a crash.

 A green glowing portal, shimmering and coruscating, lies north of you.

 "...and proceeded to finally realise my dream of spending every waking
 moment immersed in Teutonic and Celtic lore," blathers the professor.

  PHIL NOTES

 Historically flds of alchemy, phil., astron., etc. very closely tied.
 Ancient phils studied all areas.
 Many accts of early phils shrouded in myth / folklore, e.g. Hermes
 Trismegistus, Egypt. fndr of alchemy (perhaps), more figure myth than
 mdn word / concept of hermits, hermits blvd to have magic powers
 Greeks: heavy believers in divining, oracular concepts
 Greek root -mancy meaning diviner, prophet
 e.g. oneiromancy: divination (oneiro - ??)
 necromancy: conjuring spirits of dead spec. for divination (necro -
 dead)
 tyromancy: using coagulating cheese for divination (!) (tyro - cheese)

 "Now, let us proceed on to the meat of the lecture, though I warn you,
 some of this material is not quite as exciting as the title of the
 course may indicate," drones the professor.

 A mild sense of panic is beginning to set in. You feel the boredom of
 the lecture seeping into your body, leeching the strength from your
 limbs. You must get out of here!

>examine students


 The students look extremely bored, disinterested and dispirited.

 The professor drones boringly on with the lecture.

>examine professor


 The professor is dressed in the same clothes he's been wearing since
 the start of term. He is standing by the overhead projector and
 droning on and on.

 The professor drones boringly on with the lecture.

>stand


 The doors rattle as you pull at the handle. They are locked.

 "Students shall please remain in the hall until the lecture ends,"
 drones your professor.

 The professor drones boringly on with the lecture.

>xyzzy


 Remembering your old days of playing Adventure in the computer lab,
 you cry out "Xyzzy!" in a loud voice but nothing happens.

 The professor scowls up in your direction. "Please dispense with the
 historical Crowther and Woods references. Their contributions to
 Celtic lore will be discussed in a subsequent lecture."

 The professor drones boringly on with the lecture.

>examine portal


 The green portal glows and shimmers, pulsating hypnotically. Oddly, no
 one else pays it the slightest attention.

 The professor drones boringly on with the lecture.

 A mild sense of panic is beginning to set in. You feel the boredom of
 the lecture seeping into your body, leeching the strength from your
 limbs. You must get out of here!

>enter portal


 Desperate to find out where your yogurt has gone and desperate to
 escape the mind-numbing tryptophanic journey of this lecture, you leap
 into the portal. The swirling colours spin past you in a blur of
 gaseous green fluorescence. Dull reverberations push against your ears
 in a throbbing pressure of sound. Then, everything goes green.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 Crash! You land with a whump of displaced air and a frantic flurry of
 lecture notes. As the notes cascade down in a soft blanket of Teutonic
 white, you hear a voice. "Mm-yes. Most satisfactory. I appear even to
 have brought your local precipitation along with your good self."

 As the papers slowly settle, you make out a figure in a long robe
 standing in front of you. As the figure leans forward to look at the
 lecture notes, you see a wizened and bespectacled old face with small
 beady features buried in a mass of white hair, beard and wrinkles.

 "However," he continues, picking up some of your lecture notes, "it
 seems a most unusual form of precipitation. No doubt localised to the
 university. I must give the idea some study one day."

 He drops the notes and extends a hand. "Welcome, my dear student.
 Please excuse the mess, but I'm sure you know the disorder a life of
 study - mm-yes - the work of the scholar - can bring. Oh, by the way,
 my name is Ninario, but my friends - erm, my acquaintances - call me
 Ninny." He pauses and frowns slightly.

 You shake his hand bemusedly, unsure what to make of your new
 surroundings. You are in a large rectangular room, with walls of grey
 stone. A huge set of double doors lie on the east wall. Opposite the
 doors are six windows, stretching from floor to ceiling. The sunlight
 streaming in through these reveals your lecture papers have added
 little to this fellow's mess - the floor is knee deep in loose papers,
 and books with dark leather covers are scattered at various points,
 like raisins buried in a mass of white bread. There are also several
 precarious-looking stacks of books standing up tall.

 Ninario picks up a book from the floor absently and looks around in
 some consternation, trying to find somewhere to put it. He settles for
 placing it on top of a large tower of books. The pile, already
 unsteady, takes unkindly to this latest affront, and collapses,
 separating into its component volumes and disappearing into the mass
 of white. Ninario expels a sigh of the long-suffering variety and
 returns his attention to you.

 "No doubt you are somewhat confused and disoriented by your journey.
 Perhaps, given the mess, it would be best if we retired to my study so
 I can explain why I've brought you here. Why don't you meet me there
 in a few minutes, just after I... erm, well, yes, attend to some other
 business. It's through the small oaken door across the hall."

 Somehow, Ninario struggles through the vast mountains of paper, and
 leaves the room. You are all alone in this strange and new place.

  CHEM NOTES
 Chem. intro: used to be called 'hermetick', poss after Hermes
 Trismegistus (talked about this chap in Phil didn't we?).
 Chem most pwrful of sciences (accdng to prof, nat.)
 All substances in world can be reduced to chem. combin. of raw cmpds
 Many cmplx. cmpds must be mixed with mortar and pestle to really drive
 grains together. Sometimes mechanical device is even used to mix
 properly
 Some examples of cmpds:
 (right-hand side: gunpowder?! And nov 5 coming up!)
 (saltpetre old name for potassium nitrate)
 nitroglycerin: one lb produces 156 cu ft of gas, shock wave moves
 25,000 ft/sec
 (this lecturer is seriously off her head... one dangerous lady!)
 (sod. hydroxide + hydrochloric acid gives salt and water?)
 Carbonic acid (e.g. fizzy drinks)
 (magnesium oxide: any metal + oxygen in syn. reaction yields metal
 oxide)
 this course might prove interesting...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 Large and rectangular, the library has solid walls of grey stone.
 Overpopulated bookshelves line the northern wall. A huge set of open
 double doors lie on the east wall. Opposite the doors are six windows,
 stretching from floor to ceiling. By the sunlight streaming in through
 these, you can see the floor is knee deep in loose papers, and books
 with dark leather covers are scattered at various points, like raisins
 buried in a mass of white bread. This room is incredibly messy.

>examine books


 Various books with strange-sounding titles. Judging by the level of
 dust on all the books, you expect Ninario keeps them in here because
 he never reads them.

>read books


 Clouds of dust rise into the air as you remove a book from one of the
 shelves at random. You open it and several dozen pages disintegrate
 into papery dust. Hurriedly, you close the book and put it back on the
 shelf.

>look at window


 The six large windows reach from floor to ceiling, filling the western
 wall.

>look out window


 A large dirt courtyard sits below the window. A huge stone wall runs
 along the west side of the courtyard, but from here, you can't tell
 how far it extends. A huge portcullis is lowered in front of a large
 opening in the middle of the wall, directly across the courtyard.
 Beyond the portcullis is a short passageway, followed by a set of
 iron-banded wooden doors, massive and imposing. A large white fountain
 sits majestically in the middle of the courtyard, water cascading down
 its pristine alabaster surfaces.

>examine fountain


 Clear glittering water cascades down over the pristine alabaster
 surfaces of the fountain. Small marble figurines line the rim of the
 fountain. The base of the fountain is full of water.

>examine papers


 It is a mass of papers, books, scrolls and other paraphernalia.

>read papers


 It is a mass of papers, books, scrolls and other paraphernalia.

>go north


 The northern wall is filled with bookshelves.

>go east


 You try to struggle through the mountain of paper to get to the door
 but you have sunk in so far you can't move.

>swim


 Have you looked at yourself? You're dressed in flowing sorcery-student
 robes. And before you ask, no, you're not the naturist sort.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   your clothes (being worn)
   an exercise book

>xyzzy


 Remembering your old days of playing Adventure in the computer lab,
 you cry out "Xyzzy!" in a loud voice but nothing happens.

>dig


 What do you want to dig?

>dig books


 Digging would achieve nothing here.

>dig papers


 Digging would achieve nothing here.

>move papers


 You shift the worst of the mess, getting the place into some semblance
 of order; to your surprise you not only manage that, but also uncover
 a small steel key and a shiny red satchel.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>take key and satchel


 small steel key: Taken.
 shiny red satchel: Taken.

>wear satchel


 You sling the shiny red satchel over your shoulder.

>examine it


 A very fetching shiny red satchel. It has a rather odd foil lid that
 can be pulled over the opening to close it, and a strong sturdy strap
 for slinging over one's shoulder. You have the strange idea that
 you've seen this satchel, or something very like it, before.

>smell it


 The interior smells very strongly of raspberries.

>examine key


 A small steel key.

>lick satchel


 Ah, the tantalising flavour of raspberry yogurt.

>go east


 You step through the doorway into the south hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>
 Daylight seeps almost apologetically into the passage through the
 narrow window in the south wall. A set of open double doors lead west
 to the library and a smaller oaken door lies closed to the east. The
 dim sunlight reveals a set of stairs to the north.

 Ninario wanders down the hall from the north, drying his hands on his
 robe.

 "Ah, there you are, my dear student," he beams. "Let's step into my
 study, and we can sort all this out." Ninario opens the door to the
 east and escorts you into the study.

 [Press any key to continue]

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 More orderly than the library to the west, but still rather cluttered,
 this room looks like it is used on a regular basis. Although it lacks
 the appointment of a proper bed, the settee in the corner, loaded with
 pillows, tells you Ninario sleeps in here more often than not. A desk
 sits in the corner, loaded with papers, half-written spell scrolls,
 and various mouldy old books. A long, glowing strip of parchment hangs
 from the northern wall. Large glass windows on the southern and
 eastern walls admit bright shining sunlight into the room. West, the
 open door leads back to the hallway.

 Ninario waves you to a seat on the settee and then proceeds to settle
 himself down at the desk.

 "Let me explain why you are here and how you arrived from the
 university. I have brought you here because I have need of an
 apprentice. It's a bit of a social requirement amongst wizards. To
 that end, I used a spell to retrieve you from the Wizardry Internship
 Programme at Oxbridge University in Vechlee.

 "What's that you say? You didn't sign up for a Wizardry Internship
 Programme? Well perhaps a professor put your name on the.... You don't
 even attend Oxbridge University? Oh dear. Perhaps I contacted another
 university in Vechlee by mis.... I beg your pardon? You've never heard
 of Vechlee? But it's the largest city in the whole of Thalion, my
 young... Oh dear. Never heard of Thalion... Eh? England? No, I've
 never heard of it, dear student. Oh my, oh my. You seem to be from an
 altogether different time and place.

 "Mm-yes," continues Ninario, "I thought I detected some small
 interferences in the spell. Of course, the incantation I used to
 retrieve you was not, in fact, my own, and the people from whom I, um,
 acquired it were not disposed to explain its proper operation. I had
 no idea its efficacy would allow it to extend to other dimensions.
 Mm-yes. I fear something must have gone wrong after I'd made contact
 with Oxbridge, and somehow the spell ended up reaching into your
 bizarrely-named <span class="floydstyle em">England</span> and extracting you from your
 scholarly pursuits. Most vexing.

 "Still, never mind. We'll soon sort things out. Mm-yes. I would
 conjecture some type of bridge has formed between our two realities, a
 rift in our world, if you will. It must be repaired, perhaps through
 sending you home... or if you'd rather stay, perhaps I can find a
 spell to close it."

 He turns to his desk and begins groping around on it. "I know that
 spell is here somewhere. If only I could... now where on earth have my
 spectacles gone?" He sighs in exasperation. "I can't possibly find
 that spell, let alone cast it, without them. Mm-yes. No."

 He pokes around the desk, frowning to himself, and then suddenly
 brightens. "Of course! That can be your first little job, my dear
 student. Perhaps you can find my spectacles for me, while I get on
 with some other work here, and then we can see about sending you
 home... or at least getting that rift closed."

 Ninario taps a finger pensively against his chin. "Now let's see," he
 murmurs, "I had the spectacles in the library, when I greeted the new
 student. Then I went to the facilities and I know I had them then, to
 read the paper while I, um, mm-yes. Then I put them down on the seat
 and after that... oh dear. I hope I didn't end up dropping them down
 the drain... um... again. Mm-yes."

 Ninario waves a hand vaguely in the direction of the hallway and the
 rest of his tower. "Well, I'm sure you'll find them!" he says
 cheerfully, and then turns back to his desk.

 You get off the settee.

 eastern walls admit bright shining sunlight into the room. West, the
 open door leads back to the hallway.

 A bearskin rug lies across the floor.

 Ninario sits at his desk, working.

>examine rug


 The black bearskin rug is old, mouldy and foul-smelling.

>look under rug


 You pull back the rug, but don't find anything other than the hardwood
 floor.

 "What were you expecting?" asks Ninario looking at you amusedly. "A
 trap door?"

>take rug


 Ninario's foot slams down on the rug. "I know you apprentices are
 prone to running around and picking up everything that isn't nailed
 down, but don't even think about it. That's <span class="floydstyle em">my</span> rug."

>look out window


 Which do you mean, the eastern window or the southern window?

>look out eastern window


 A large plot of tilled earth lies below this window, as though there
 was a garden at one time, but it is now barren and lifeless. A huge
 stone wall runs along the east side of the courtyard, but from here,
 it's hard to tell how far it extends.

>look out southern window


 You look out over the southern part of the courtyard. A pebbled walk
 extends south to the door of a small wooden shed. Beyond the shed, a
 huge stone wall runs along the south side of the courtyard, but from
 here, it's hard to tell how far it extends.

>examine pillows


 The settee is loaded down with soft white pillows.

>take pillow


 Try as you might, you can see no pillow here.

>take pillows


 The settee and its assorted pillows and cushions are so beautifully
 arranged, you decide to leave them as they are.

>examine parchment


 The long glowing strip of parchment is composed of hundreds of lines
 of densely spaced text.

>read parchment


 The first few lines read <span class="floydstyle em">Case for the Wizards Guild versus</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Ninario, styling himself 'wizard'. Pending charges:</span>

 The parchment continues, listing hundreds of items such as
 <span class="floydstyle em">Magicking without a Guild Membership, Involuntary Magical</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Manslaughter</span> and various other bizarre offences.

>ask ninny about parchment


 Ninario glares in the direction of the parchment and shakes his head.
 "You should have a look at it yourself. It's a monstrous piece of
 work. A sheer travesty of justice. Those are all the complaints the
 Wizards Guild have against me, all the charges they've leveled.
 They're all trumped-up, naturally. Five hundred and sixty-three counts
 of magicking without a licence... I mean, really! I can understand
 them wanting to make a point, but honestly, five hundred charges?

 "Mm-yes. Look at this here." He points to an entry. "This is the most
 serious offence and all I did was cast a spell to make the bed. But
 what do they call it? Seditious breakdown of the class structure.
 Hah!"

 He points to a couple of other items. "And then look at these! Did you
 ever see anything so outrageous? I mean, Negligent and Dangerous
 Magicking causing Grievous Bodily Harm? I warned those bystanders they
 were in the way. Mm-yes. Fortunately that's a less serious charge, but
 still... that's the blasted Wizards Guild for you."

 Ninario falls silent, muttering to himself now and then about his
 unwarranted persecution at the hands of the Wizards Guild.

>read books


 The books, quills, papers and scrolls are strewn all over the desk.

>examine desk


 The desk is a sturdy utilitarian affair. In line with much of the rest
 of Ninario's life, it is a mess.

>ask ninny about manslaughter


 "Mm-yes, indeed," murmurs Ninario. "To explain all about that, I have
 to go back to many, many years ago. I was just a young boy then, and
 well, you know how young boys are." Ninario regales you at length with
 humourous anecdotes about his childhood, amusing you greatly, but
 largely leaving your question unanswered. "So there you are," he
 concludes. "That explains it." He falls silent, fond memories leaving
 him smiling.

>ask ninny about rug


 Ninario sighs. "She was a pet, a dear friend, for many, many years.
 Mm-yes. Once she was gone, I couldn't bear to part with her." He pats
 the rug tenderly. "And of course," he continues clinically, "the rest
 of her was extremely useful. Spell components, you know. Mm-yes
 indeed. And if you ever need to look like a bear in a hurry? An
 invaluable disguise."

>ask ninny about guild


 "Ooh, don't get me started on that again," cries Ninario. "I'll end up
 getting all annoyed and cranky." He mutters to himself for a few
 minutes, coming to terms with his anger.

 Ninario shuffles the papers on his desk.

>ask ninny about monkeys


 "Mm-yes, indeed," murmurs Ninario. "To explain all about that, I have
 to go back to many, many years ago. I was just a young boy then, and
 well, you know how young boys are." Ninario regales you at length with

>ask ninny about spectacles


 Ninario gives you a slightly embarrassed glance. "Mm-yes, well, as I
 said earlier, there's a strong possibility that they may have ended up
 down the drain... um... again. Mm-yes."

>ask ninny about drain


 "It leads to the sewer vat in the basement," says Ninario, giving a
 vague wave in the direction of the rest of the tower. "Down the
 stairs."

>ask ninny about sewer


 "It's in the basement. Probably needs unblocking, too."

>ask ninny about basement


 "Down the staircase," mutters Ninario. "Take a light with you."

>ask ninny about light


 "I think there's one in the laboratory," says Ninario, busy with
 something at his desk.

>ask ninny about laboratory


 "South from the main hall," he says shortly, not looking up from his
 work.

>ask ninny about name


 "Mm-yes, indeed," murmurs Ninario. "To explain all about that, I have
 to go back to many, many years ago. I was just a young boy then, and
 well, you know how young boys are." Ninario regales you at length with
 humourous anecdotes about his childhood, amusing you greatly, but

>go west


 You step through the doorway into the south hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>
 Daylight seeps almost apologetically into the passage through the
 narrow window in the south wall. A set of open double doors lead west
 to the library and a smaller oaken door lies open to the east. The dim
 sunlight reveals a set of stairs to the north.

>go north


 You head north up the hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go north


 You head north up the hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hallway</span>
 A small narrow window on the northern wall admits bright warm sunlight
 into this end of the hall. A bedroom lies through the open door to the
 west. East is a closed solid stone door. The stairs are to the south.

>go west


 You step through the doorway into the bedroom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 Thick carpeting covers the floor of Ninario's extravagantly decorated
 bedroom. Spacious windows in the north and west walls admit generous
 amounts of light. The door back to the hallway lies to the east.

 A large chest full of linen sits open against the south wall.

 A large, old-fashioned canopied four-poster bed also lies here,
 complete with frilly lace pillows, spotless white silk sheets, and a
 tastefully elegant lace skirting, reaching from the mattress all the
 way down to the floor.

 Arrayed beautifully on the bed is a frilly lace pillow.

>look under bed


 You lift up the skirting on the bed, apprehension gnawing at you.
 Surely there wouldn't be... yes, of course. Why do people always leave
 things under their bed? You shake your head in despair. Well, at least
 it makes sense for an elderly fellow like Ninario to have a small
 ceramic chamberpot under his bed.

 You pick up the small chamberpot, admiring its beautiful
 rabbit-motifed handiwork. Last year's <span class="floydstyle em">History of the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Chamberpot</span> course enables you to confidently classify it as an
 early Renaissance 3-pinter. Fortunately, it seems to have been cleaned
 thoroughly since its last use, as you can't resist hanging on to such
 a fine piece.

 The pillow has a long slit along one end, where the frilly lace has
 pulled away, ripping the fabric.

 Unsurprisingly for a frilly and fluffy lace pillow, it is full of
 stuffing.

 As you pull the stuffing out of the pillow, it separates into its
 component feathers, which drift slowly down to the floor.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to take the frilly lace
 pillow.

 Try as you might, you can see no p illow here.

 the world, but you draw the line at using chamberpots, especially
 someone else's.

>examine pot


 A beautifully decorated ceramic chamberpot, in rabbit motif, capable
 of holding 3 pints of water. It is currently empty.

 The peak of ancient plumbing technology, the garderobe is a fairly

 usual-sized hole roughly in the middle of it, and a rack for reading
 material attached to the wall. The only odd thing is the lack of any
 toilet paper. Perhaps it's all accomplished magically. A small narrow
 window on the northern wall admits some light into this room.

 The rack contains choice reading material for those occasionally
 necessary long visits to the toilet. At the moment, it contains a copy
 of Wizarding Weekly.

  *** THEFT SHOCKS HALLOWED HALLS ***

 Staff and students at Oxbridge University learned last week that even
 their hallowed halls are not safe from seditious burglary. In an
 embarrassing incident for campus security, thieves broke into the
 Supplies Cupboard in broad daylight, and purloined an Internship
 Student Retrieval scroll. The Wizards Guild is investigating.

  *** RENEGADE WIZARD TOPS 500 CHARGES ***

 Court documents filed today by the Wizards Guild indicate that
 renegade wizard Ninario now tops the list of illegal spellusers, with
 some 581 spells cast, all without guild sanction. Guild members are
 worried Ninario's conduct may undermine guild authority in these
 trying times, especially in light of the recent Plumbers Union
 resurgence. "Ninario is precisely the kind of amateur, unprofessional
 bungler who gives legitimate wizards a bad name," said Renaldo, head
 of the Wizards Guild. "He thinks he can run around casting spells,
 totally guild-free. Well, his spellcasting days are numbered." Renaldo
 refused to clarify, stating only that "the wheels are in motion."

  *** PLUMBERS UNION RESURFACES ***

 Recent bulletins from our reporters in rural areas indicate the
 ancient Plumbers Union is actively recruiting members once again. The
 infamous banned order is reportedly holding mysterious rituals and
 advocating strange-sounding practices, such as "double-billing on
 weekends", and the dangerous and unsanitary use of non-magic toilets.
 A spokescaster for the Wizards Guild says the uprising should be
 flushed out before too long.

  *** CHEESE BLATANTLY MENTIONED ***

 In what is becoming an alarming tradition, cheese was blatantly
 mentioned at the Vechlee Victuallers Meeting yesterday, when local
 cheesewright Eliza Stilton stood up and expounded on the relative
 merits of block versus truckles. After this surprising outburst,
 Stilton then discussed the subtle differences between Cheshire and
 Roquefort. She then finished up with a scathing attack on Caerphilly,
 and its completely unsuitable tyromantic capabilities. Local villagers
 are still in shock. "I think it's awful," said one, who requested
 anonymity. "Stilton shouldn't have said the things she did about
 Caerphilly. She's the cheesewright here in Vechlee, a trusted woman on
 the subject, and she's in a position to do a lot of hurt to a lot of
 innocent cheeses."

  *** COMPANY RECALLS REFURBISHED CANNON ***

 Mortar Remains, suppliers of refurbished cannonry, announced today
 they are recalling their self-sparking BrutalMaimer(tm) models from
 customers. A company spokesperson cited safety concerns. "These cannon
 are meant for military use only, and should never have been
 refurbished and resold to the general public. They are extremely
 susceptible to sparking when gunpowder is loaded into the barrel, and
 the general public are unschooled in the proper use of the required
 powder bags. In addition, the large-bore calibre means there is a
 danger of large objects, such as dogs, cats, children, apprentices and
 other pets falling into the mouth of the cannon and being launched,
 accidentally or otherwise." The company vehemently denied reports that
 pressure from the Wizards Guild was behind the recall.

>use toilet


 You're a casual, easygoing sort of person, but you still don't use the
 toilet with the door open.

>close door


 You close the solid stone door.

>use toilet


>look through window
 You settle down on the toilet for a short time, but nothing much
 happens. You don't need to go, so you stand back up, fastening
 everything back up as you do so. Why do new and exciting experiences
 always affect you the same way?



 The window is so narrow all you can see is packed dirt in the
 courtyard below.

>open door


 You open the solid stone door.

>go west


 You step through the doorway into the north hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hallway</span>
 A small narrow window on the northern wall admits bright warm sunlight
 into this end of the hall. A bedroom lies through the open door to the
 west. East is an open solid stone door. The stairs are to the south.

>go south


 You head south down the hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go up


 You ascend the winding stairs into the warm sunshine on top of the
 tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower</span>
 Sun beats down from high overhead, warming the flagstones of the
 tower. A commanding and breathtaking view of the fields and pastures
 surrounding the caer greets you in every direction. In addition, there
 is a good view of the courtyard below, with its beautiful alabaster
 fountain. You also see the portcullis and catch a glimpse of the
 double wooden doors beyond it. The stairs in the centre of the tower
 lead back down to the first floor.

 A massive cannon sits here, resting on a huge swivel base.

>enter cannon


 You sit on top of the barrel and slide your feet into the cannon.
 Pushing and straining, you attempt to push the rest of your body in,
 but there's too much friction. You can't squeeze yourself in.

>fire cannon


 You pull the cord and from inside the cannon hear the dull clack of
 flint striking frizzen. Nothing more happens. There is no powder to
 ignite inside the cannon.

>go down


 You clatter down to the first floor, the rickety stairs shaking and
 groaning in protest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go down


 You descend the stairs to the ground floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands closed to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go south


 You unlock the polished steel door with the small steel key, open it
 and step into the laboratory.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Laboratory</span>
 The southern half of the tower is completely taken up by this large
 laboratory. From the profusion of chemicals and powders strewn about,
 you conclude that this room sees much use. It seems that Ninario is
 more than simply a wizard; he is engaged in scientific endeavour as
 well. Black streaks of soot on the walls bear mute evidence to the
 violent failure (or perhaps success) of past experiments. What little
 sunlight there is filters in through the numerous small windows lining
 the walls. The open door to the north leads back to the main hall.

 A scarred and stained table rests against the southern wall.

 The table holds various bags and pouches: the components of some of
 Ninario's experiments. Amongst the items of interest are a
 silvery-white cylinder, a silk purse, a small red tube and a leather
 pouch.

 Sitting above the table is a shelf containing a small stone bottle, a
 flask, a vial of liquid, an earthenware dish and a ceramic bowl.

 The vial contains a clear colourless liquid. On the side of the vial
 is the cryptic lettering <span class="floydstyle em">#1 #17</span>.

>examine substance


 Which do you mean, the translucent crystalline substance or the white

>examine translucent substance


 A translucent crystalline substance. It looks like a salt of some
 kind.

>shake vial


 Aside from the emotional scarring, the vial of liquid remains
 undamaged by your brutal and senseless attack.

>examine vial


 The vial contains a clear colourless liquid. On the side of the vial

>examine cylinder


 A small cylinder of some silvery-white metal. Inscribed on the side in
 tiny letters are the words <span class="floydstyle em">#12 Illuminator, Commercial Grade.</span>
 A fine line encircles the middle of the rod, a tiny arrow printed
 beside it, pointing around the circumference of the cylinder.

>spin cylinder


 Using that verb will not appreciably help.

>shake cylinder


 You give the cylinder a sharp twist and it suddenly bursts forth in
 blazing white light. Then, as your eyes struggle to adjust, the
 cylinder dims to a more reasonable level. It is now quite usable as a
 light source.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go north


 You step through the doorway into the main hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands closed to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go northeast


 You step through the doorway, into the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A few rusted pots and pans line this rather spartan kitchen area. A
 fireplace sits in the northern wall, but no fire has been laid there.
 A well-scrubbed oak table occupies the middle of the room. Southwest
 is the doorway back to the main hall.

 Although the kitchen gives the impression of never being used someone
 has left a creamy yellow stick of butter sitting on the table here.

>examine butter


 A creamy yellow stick of butter.

>take butter

 Taken.

>examine  pots


 Miscellaneous pots and pans line the walls of the kitchen. They are
 all rusted, and look like they are never used. You wonder whether
 Ninario does any cooking or even eats in here.

>examine fireplace


 Worn, grey stone masonry surrounds this ancient-looking fireplace. The
 fireplace is free of ashes, and bears no signs of being used recently,
 so the stains of smoke on the grey brick must have been there for some
 time.

>look in fireplace


 The fireplace gapes emptily, free even of ashes or kindling.

>examine table


 Beautifully crafted of the finest oak, the table is clean and
 well-scrubbed, as befits a surface where meals are prepared. The
 tabletop is smooth and level, the four legs sturdy beams of oak.

>go southwest


 You step back into the main hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large

 rusty metal door stands closed to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>examine rusty


 Corroded stains line the pitted steel surface of the closed door.

>open it


 It seems to be locked.

>go down


 You descend cautiously down the rickety staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement</span>
 The slow drip of water echoes through this dark and damp room. The
 walls and floor are wet with moisture, and the air seems stuffy and
 unclean. A doorway opens to the north, and a most unwholesome odour
 emanates from that direction. The spiral staircase climbs back up to
 the main hall here, and a narrow slimy passage heads south.

>smell


 An unwholesome odour wafts into this room from the doorway to the
 north.

>go north


 Braving the foul odour, you step through the doorway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sewer</span>
 Dank and dark, this is one of the less memorable attractions you've
 visited. You're not certain how often Ninario has this room cleaned,
 but the stench is horrendous. A miasma of gas seems to hang in the
 air, visible as a shimmering in the corner of your eye. The basement
 lies back through the doorway to the south.

 A vat looms here, six feet high, and constructed of stone, with a
 metal ladder leading up to the rim.  There is a large stone channel
 connected to the bottom of the vat, where waste is supposed to exit
 the vat. The channel leads along the floor to the wall, where you can
 see the lip of a small outflow pipe.

>look in vat


 This stinking vat of filth is full to the brim with things so nasty,
 you don't even want to contemplate them.

>examine pipe


 The sewer outflow pipe is operating normally.

 The stone channel leads from the sewer vat to the outflow pipe. The
 opening from the vat to the channel is blocked.

>examine block


 The stone channel leads from the sewer vat to the outflow pipe. The
 opening from the vat to the channel is blocked.

>unblock channel


 You're pretty sure you won't be able to remove the blockage in this
 way. Perhaps if you could find a way to blast the sewage out of the
 vat, the blockage would be cleared.

  PHIL NOTES

 Historically flds of alchemy, phil., astron., etc. very closely tied.
 Ancient phils studied all areas.
 Many accts of early phils shrouded in myth / folklore, e.g. Hermes
 Trismegistus, Egypt. fndr of alchemy (perhaps), more figure myth than
 mdn word / concept of hermits, hermits blvd to have magic powers
 Greeks: heavy believers in divining, oracular concepts
 Greek root -mancy meaning diviner, prophet
 e.g. oneiromancy: divination (oneiro - ??)
 necromancy: conjuring spirits of dead spec. for divination (necro -
 dead)
 tyromancy: using coagulating cheese for divination (!) (tyro - cheese)

  CHEM NOTES
 Chem. intro: used to be called 'hermetick', poss after Hermes
 Trismegistus (talked about this chap in Phil didn't we?).
 Chem most pwrful of sciences (accdng to prof, nat.)
 All substances in world can be reduced to chem. combin. of raw cmpds
 Many cmplx. cmpds must be mixed with mortar and pestle to really drive
 grains together. Sometimes mechanical device is even used to mix
 properly
 Some examples of cmpds:
 (right-hand side: gunpowder?! And nov 5 coming up!)
 (saltpetre old name for potassium nitrate)
 nitroglycerin: one lb produces 156 cu ft of gas, shock wave moves
 25,000 ft/sec
 (this lecturer is seriously off her head... one dangerous lady!)
 (sod. hydroxide + hydrochloric acid gives salt and water?)
 Carbonic acid (e.g. fizzy drinks)
 (magnesium oxide: any metal + oxygen in syn. reaction yields metal
 oxide)
 this course might prove interesting...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large

 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands closed to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go west


 You head down the stone passageway and emerge into the bright sunshine
 of the courtyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large portcullis sealing off the bailey passage
 directly across the courtyard. Beyond the portcullis is a short
 passageway, followed by a set of iron-banded wooden doors, massive and
 imposing. To the east is the passage back into the tower.

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>examine fountain


 Clear glittering water cascades down over the pristine alabaster
 surfaces of the fountain. Small marble figurines line the rim of the
 fountain. The base of the fountain is full of water.

>examine figurines


 The delicate figurines are exquisitely sculpted in marble, yet somehow
 they lack the statuesque majesty of most sculptures. Perhaps this is
 because they are exquisitely sculpted marble rabbits. They line the
 fountain, spraying water into it around the sides of their prominent
 front teeth.

>look in fountain


 The fountain is full of clear glittering water that continuously
 cascades from the top down into the base.

>examine teeth


 Try as you might, you can see no teeth here.

>get in fountain


 You would get your feet all wet if you did that.

>go west


 The portcullis blocks further passage to the west.

>go up


 You clamber up the stairs beside the bailey.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atop the West Wall</span>
 The landscape of this strange place stretches out from the caer west
 to the horizon. Cultivated fields are spread out below, a
 multicoloured cloak draped over the shoulders of the land. A dry
 ribbon of road runs past the caer heading northeast and southwest
 through the fields. Villages, visible as small clusters of buildings,
 dot the farmlands. The fields continue flat and level for quite some
 distance, gradually leading into more hilly country. Beyond the hills,
 far in the distance, the many spires and towers of a city or large
 fortress rise up to touch the sky.

 The caer wall stretches away to the north and south. The wall is very
 wide here, encompassing the entire width of the bailey below. A small
 stone building perches on the wall to the west. The courtyard is back
 down the stairs to the east.

>go west


 You step inside the gatehouse.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gatehouse</span>
 The area above the bailey is a small, square stone room, bare and
 featureless but for the holes riddling the floor, used for pouring
 boiling oil or water over invaders in the bailey below. A doorway east
 leads back out to the top of the wall.

 A scarred and rusted machine fills the western wall of the room.

>examine machine


 The machine looms ominously against the western wall of this room. It
 is scarred and pitted with age, the rusting metal of its construction
 flaking away. Various gears, hoses and wheels line the front of the
 machine and large chains rise up out of holes in the floor to loop
 around some of the gears on the machine.

 The most comprehensible part of the whole thing is a small funnel or
 spout that sticks out of the right hand side. There is a small brass
 plate affixed to the front of the machine.

>examine plate


      Hydrolytic Counterbalancing Machine
                    MARK IV
  *** THESE MACHINES ARE FACTORY CALIBRATED ***
  ***   FOR SPECIFIC QUANTITIES OF FLUIDS   ***
         (See manual for specifications)
     Use of other than calibrated quantities
        will not harm the machine but may
          result in improper operation.

>examine funnel


 The funnel sticks out from the right-hand side of the machine. The
 rust staining its metal bears evidence to its use for receiving
 liquid.

>go east


 You step out of the gatehouse and back onto the wall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atop the West Wall</span>
 The landscape of this strange place stretches out from the caer west
 to the horizon. Cultivated fields are spread out below, a
 multicoloured cloak draped over the shoulders of the land. A dry
 ribbon of road runs past the caer heading northeast and southwest
 through the fields. Villages, visible as small clusters of buildings,
 dot the farmlands. The fields continue flat and level for quite some
 distance, gradually leading into more hilly country. Beyond the hills,
 far in the distance, the many spires and towers of a city or large
 fortress rise up to touch the sky.

 The caer wall stretches away to the north and south. The wall is very
 wide here, encompassing the entire width of the bailey below. A small
 stone building perches on the wall to the west. The courtyard is back
 down the stairs to the east.

>go north


 Rather than walking around the perimeter of the entire wall to end up
 right back here, you opt to save everyone's time and just stay put.

>go northeast


 The courtyard is back down the stairs, the gatehouse is to the west,
 and the wall continues north and south from here.

>go down


 You descend the weathered stone steps to the courtyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large portcullis sealing off the bailey passage
 directly across the courtyard. Beyond the portcullis is a short
 passageway, followed by a set of iron-banded wooden doors, massive and
 imposing. To the east is the passage back into the tower.

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>go northeast


 You follow the path northeast around the corner of the tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Tower</span>
 The northern part of the courtyard is a wide and open space, with
 hard-packed dirt underfoot. To the north, the wall of the caer runs
 east and west. The main courtyard can be reached by heading southwest
 along the stone path, while to the southeast, the path continues
 around the base of the tower, to where the courtyard opens out into a
 wide plot of earth.

>se


 You follow the path southeast to the garden plot.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden Plot</span>
 A large plot of earth has been cleared here, as though there was a
 garden at one time, but it is now barren and lifeless. To the east is
 the wall of the caer running north and south. Paths head northwest and
 southwest around the base of the tower.

>examine plot


 The plot of earth is barren and lifeless. It must not have been tilled
 or planted in years.

>go southwest


 You follow the path southwest around the base of the tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of Tower</span>
 The path around the tower branches here, with a small pebbled walk
 heading south to the door of a small wooden shed. Beyond the shed the
 wall of the caer runs east and west. The stone path heads northwest to
 the courtyard, and northeast to where it opens out into a wide plot of
 earth.

>go south


 You try to enter the shed, but the lock is rusted shut.

>examine lock


 The lock is a heavy iron affair.  Rust covers it, and you doubt you
 could open it even if you had the right key.

>break lock


 Aside from the emotional scarring, the lock remains undamaged by your
 brutal and senseless attack.

>examine vial


 The vial contains a clear colourless liquid. On the side of the vial
 is the cryptic lettering <span class="floydstyle em">#1 #17</span>.

>SAVE
>cf36
 %% Enter a save filename to write:
 Ok.

>pour vial on lock


 You pull the stopper from the vial, and pour the muriatic acid over
 the rusted lock. It bubbles and roils as it eats away at the
 oxidation, chewing through the metal. Within a few minutes, there is
 substantially less of the lock.

 The vial itself vanishes, a handy consequence of the Thalionic
 Antimagic Litter Campaign.

>go south


 Its lock now damaged and useless, the shed door opens easily, and you
 step inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Shed</span>
 A small shed once used to store gardening implements. It is now mostly
 empty, with only a few broken remnants of garden tools remaining. A
 large trap door lies in the floor of the shed. Daylight streams
 through the open door to the north.

 An old watering can, spotted with rust, sits amongst the broken tools.

>examine take acn


 Try as you might, you can't see that here.

>examine take can


 Try as you might, you can't see that here.

>take can


 Taken.

>examine can


 Spotted with rust, the old watering can has seen better days. Despite
 the rust, the can looks still capable of holding water: 5 pints worth,
 to judge from the rusty <span class="floydstyle em">5</span> stamped into the side. It is
 currently empty.

>examine tools


 The broken tools sit here, neglected and rusted.

>search tools


 You rummage through the old tools, but they're all too broken and
 rusted to be of use to you.

>open trap door


 You open the trap door, revealing worn stone steps leading downward.

>go down


 You descend the worn stone steps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Slimy Passage</span>
 This narrow passage under the shed is dark, slimy and unpleasant. The
 passage continues north, and worn stone steps end at the open trap
 door above.

>go north


 You scuttle along the narrow slimy passage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Slimy Ledge</span>
 The passage from the south ends here at a small slimy ledge that juts
 out over an open room below. The room down there appears to have been
 put into use as a rubbish tip for all of Ninario's cast-off
 spellcasting implements, bits of machinery and general odds and ends.
 The huge heap of rubbish takes up most of the floor space. North of
 the heap, a tunnel leads out of the room. Mouldy remnants of wood
 suggest steps might once have led up to this ledge but they have long
 since rotted away. It looks possible to clamber down into the room,
 but climbing back up would be another story.

>examine wood


 A short red tube. Small printing on the side reads <span class="floydstyle em">All-Purpose</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Wood Hastener</span>. The tube seems to contain a reddish paste.

>examine remnants


 Try as you might, you can see no remnants here.

 Try as you might, you can see no ladder here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Slimy Passage</span>
 This narrow passage under the shed is dark, slimy and unpleasant. The

>go up


 You ascend the worn stone steps into the shed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Shed</span>
 A small shed once used to store gardening implements. It is now mostly

 downward. Daylight streams through the open door to the north.

>go north


 You step out of the shed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of Tower</span>
 The path around the tower branches here, with a small pebbled walk
 heading south to the door of a small wooden shed. Beyond the shed the
 wall of the caer runs east and west. The stone path heads northwest to
 the courtyard, and northeast to where it opens out into a wide plot of
 earth.

>go northwest


 You follow the path northwest, back to the courtyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large portcullis sealing off the bailey passage

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>go east


 You head down the stone passageway back into the gloom of the tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands closed to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go up


 You ascend gingerly to the first floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go south


 You head south down the hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>
 Daylight seeps almost apologetically into the passage through the
 narrow window in the south wall. A set of open double doors lead west
 to the library and a smaller oaken door lies open to the east. The dim
 sunlight reveals a set of stairs to the north.

>go east


 You step through the doorway into the study.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 More orderly than the library to the west, but still rather cluttered,
 this room looks like it is used on a regular basis. Although it lacks
 the appointment of a proper bed, the settee in the corner, loaded with
 pillows, tells you Ninario sleeps in here more often than not. A desk
 sits in the corner, loaded with papers, half-written spell scrolls,
 and various mouldy old books. A long, glowing strip of parchment hangs
 from the northern wall. Large glass windows on the southern and
 eastern walls admit bright shining sunlight into the room. West, the
 open door leads back to the hallway.

 A bearskin rug lies across the floor.

 Ninario scratches his head as he studies something at his desk.

>ask ninario about machine


 "You know," muses Ninario, "it's been so many years since I left the
 caer, I can't even remember how much water you have to put in that
 machine to open the portcullis. Mm-yes. No. You'll just have to
 experiment."

>ask ninario about vial


 "The vial of liquid?" says Ninario. "Whatever you do, don't get any on
 you. It's muriatic acid. Eats through metal like rabbits through a
 field of carrots. Mm-yes."

>ask ninario about flask


 "I've got various purses, pouches and dishes of chemicals down in the
 laboratory. If you bring them up here, I'll gladly identify any of
 them for you."

 Ninario shuffles the papers on his desk.

>ask ninario about bowl


 "I've got various purses, pouches and dishes of chemicals down in the
 laboratory. If you bring them up here, I'll gladly identify any of
 them for you."

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   an empty watering can
   a rusty helmet (perched on your head)
   an exercise book
   a stick of butter
   a ceramic bowl
     a translucent crystalline substance
   an earthenware dish
     some small blue crystals
   a flask
     a white powdery substance
   a small stone bottle
   a leather pouch (which is closed)
   a magnesium flare (providing light)
   a raspberry satchel (being worn and open)
     a tube of wood hastener
     a silk purse (which is closed)
     a copy of Wizarding Weekly
     a frilly lace pillow
     an empty chamberpot
     a small steel key
   your clothes (being worn)

>show bowl to ninny


 "Those are ammonium sulphate crystals. Not really terribly useful,
 except as a fertiliser. They're left over from other experiments."

>show helmet to ninny


 "Do all apprentices go around picking up everything that isn't fixed
 in place? I'm very impressed that you managed to find a rusty helmet
 but I'd be much more impressed if you managed to find my spectacles."

>show dish to ninny


 "That's copper sulphate," says Ninario.

 Ninario blows his nose noisily on his sleeve.

>show purse to ninny


 (first taking the silk purse)
 (opening the silk purse first)
 "Is it yellow?" asks Ninario without looking up. "If it is, it's
 sulphur."

>examine bottle


 The small bottle looks exactly like those stone bottles of ginger
 beer, but the label on the side reads <span class="floydstyle em">WizStrip Paint Stripper,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Industrial Strength</span>. Then in smaller letters: <span class="floydstyle em">WARNING: Highly</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">reactive. Do not mix with methane</span>.

>show flask to ninny


 "Ah," says Ninario, "saltpetre. I <span class="floydstyle em">thought</span> I only had a bit
 left."

>show pouch to ninny


 (opening the leather pouch first)
 "That looks like charcoal to me. Mm-yes," says Ninario.

>show butter to ninny


 "Do all apprentices go around picking up everything that isn't fixed

 stick of butter but I'd be much more impressed if you managed to find
 my spectacles."

>show chamberpot to ninny


 (first taking the chamberpot)
 (putting the leather pouch into the raspberry satchel to make room)
 "That's the chamberpot from under my bed!" says Ninario in surprise.
 "Really, you young people are so very odd. Do all apprentices run
 around picking up everything that isn't fixed in place?"

 Ninario mutters to himself as he works at his desk.

>yes


 That was a rhetorical question.

>go west


 You step through the doorway into the south hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>
 Daylight seeps almost apologetically into the passage through the

 You step through the doorway into the garderobe.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garderobe</span>
 The peak of ancient plumbing technology, the garderobe is a fairly
 simple affair: a short stone bench jutting out from the wall with the
 usual-sized hole roughly in the middle of it, and a rack for reading

 toilet paper. Perhaps it's all accomplished magically. A small narrow

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement</span>
 The slow drip of water echoes through this dark and damp room. The

 Dank and dark, this is one of the less memorable attractions you've
 visited. You're not certain how often Ninario has this room cleaned,
 but the stench is horrendous. A miasma of gas seems to hang in the
 air, visible as a shimmering in the corner of your eye. The basement
 lies back through the doorway to the south.

 A vat looms here, six feet high, and constructed of stone, with a
 metal ladder leading up to the rim.  There is a large stone channel
 connected to the bottom of the vat, where waste is supposed to exit
 the vat. The channel leads along the floor to the wall, where you can

 The stone channel leads from the sewer vat to the outflow pipe. The

 You don't want to go swimming around in all that filth.

 You prise the lid from the stone bottle, revealing yellowish oily

 As the pent-up sewer gases in this room react with the paint stripper

 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands closed to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go up


 You ascend gingerly to the first floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go south


 You head south down the hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>
 Daylight seeps almost apologetically into the passage through the
 narrow window in the south wall. A set of open double doors lead west
 to the library and a smaller oaken door lies open to the east. The dim
 sunlight reveals a set of stairs to the north.

>go east


 You step through the doorway into the study.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 More orderly than the library to the west, but still rather cluttered,
 this room looks like it is used on a regular basis. Although it lacks
 the appointment of a proper bed, the settee in the corner, loaded with
 pillows, tells you Ninario sleeps in here more often than not. A desk
 sits in the corner, loaded with papers, half-written spell scrolls,
 and various mouldy old books. A long, glowing strip of parchment hangs
 from the northern wall. Large glass windows on the southern and
 eastern walls admit bright shining sunlight into the room. West, the
 open door leads back to the hallway.

 A bearskin rug lies across the floor.

 Ninario looks up as you enter. "Mm-yes, hello there." He glances at
 the rusty old helmet on your head and chuckles to himself.

>show glasses to ninny


 Ninario's eyes light up. "Ah, yes! Those are the very things I need!
 However did you find them?" He takes the glasses and places them on
 his nose. "Look at that!" he exclaims. "You've even cleaned the
 lenses. I can't remember when they've been so clear. Wonderful. Well,
 when you're ready, just come back and ask me to close that rift, and
 we'll see what we can do about it."

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>ask ninny about rift


 "Ah, so you'd like to stay here now, would you?" asks Ninario.
 "Certainly, if I can manage to close the rift, that's a possibility."

 Ninario pushes his spectacles farther up his nose, and rolls up the
 sleeves of his robe. "Very well," he declares, "it's time to get down
 to business." He gropes around on the desk, strewing papers left and
 right, and finally pulls out a worn and faded scroll. "Mm-" he
 mutters, peering intently at the scroll with interest, "yes. " He
 reads through it quickly, his lips moving as he says the words to
 himself. Then he nods. "Mm-yes, I have it now."

 He begins chanting in a low sonorous voice, glancing at the scroll now
 and then. The chant builds from its low resonant beginnings to a high
 frenzied shriek as Ninario waves his arms and shouts with growing
 intensity. The power whips around, pulling and tugging at you from
 every direction. The fabric of reality splits apart, as the rift in
 the fragile continuum of this magical world widens.

 [Press any key to continue]

 There is a final wrench of sound and two robed figures tumble from the
 tear.

 "Merciful magic!" exclaims Ninario, blenching.

 The newcomers loom over Ninario, grim and menacing. One, a
 stern-looking fellow, waves his hand; the tear slows its gyrations,
 and stabilises.

 "It's the Wizards Guild," whispers Ninario, his face ashen. "I never
 thought they'd go through with it."

 The grim-looking wizard steps forward and places his hand on Ninario's
 shoulder. "Ninario the so-called wizard, as head of the guild, I,
 Renaldo, hereby apprehend you in connection with all the prior charges
 against you, as well as the two latest." Renaldo waves at the strip of
 parchment on the wall and it glows briefly as two new lines are added.

 "Two charges?" cries Ninario, peering at it. "You can't charge me
 twice for the same offence. Mm-yes. No."

 "First charge is for the first offence: theft of an Internship Student
 Retrieval Scroll," barks Renaldo. "Second charge is for the attempted
 theft of a student using said spell. Fortunately, we detected your
 shoddy attempt to nab one of our students and deflected the spell."
 Renaldo glances witheringly at you. "This <span class="floydstyle em">article</span>, I presume,
 was the result of your botched spell."

 Ninario puts on a bold face. "How dare you come here, and accuse me in
 the sanctity - mm-yes - of my, erm, campestral demesne. A wizard's
 caer is his own private kingdom. Don't think I don't know the real
 reason behind this. Mm-yes. It's not about a few miserable spells,
 it's about stifling any and all scientific..."

 "Enough!" snarls Renaldo. "Save it for your defence, Ninario. You're
 coming back to Guild Headquarters in Vechlee for execution and then
 trial. Come on, Virgil, help me grab him."

 The two grab Ninario and leap into the portal, dragging him in after
 them, feet first. "My dear student!" cries Ninario, as his lower torso
 disappears into the rift. "You must come and rescue me! As your
 summoner, I'm the only one who can repair the rift. We need each
 other! Mm-..."

 The last inevitable <span class="floydstyle em">yes</span> is cut off as the rest of Ninario is
 dragged bodily through the portal.

 As the portal snaps shut, something falls from it, and lands with a
 clanging sound on the floor.

 You've heard about them from others. You've even had them yourself:
 classes that seem to last forever. But this one takes the biscuit. You
 wonder what possessed you to sign up for <span class="floydstyle em">Celtic Elements in Early</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Teutonic Settlements</span>: a field of study so narrow and boring,
 you'd wonder they would award doctorates in it. But they must, for the
 chap running the lecture has one.

 You glance down at the notebook in your hands, but the thought of
 recording all this boredom for posterity doesn't thrill you. Instead,
 you look around the hall, wondering if you could sneak out and find
 something better to do with your time.

 The desk is a sturdy utilitarian affair. In line with much of the rest
 of Ninario's life, it is a mess.

>search desk


 Resting on the messy desk are some papers, quills and blank scrolls.

 It's such a mess you can't tell which papers are useful and which
 aren't.

>examine strip


 The long glowing strip of parchment is composed of hundreds of lines
 of densely spaced text.

>take strip


 Well, you thought it was an odd thing for Ninario to display proudly
 and now you understand. The Guild appear to have magically affixed the

 You step through the doorway into the south hallway.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>
 Daylight seeps almost apologetically into the passage through the
 narrow window in the south wall. A set of open double doors lead west
 to the library and a smaller oaken door lies open to the east. The dim
 sunlight reveals a set of stairs to the north.

>go north


 You head north up the hall.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and

 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go down


 You descend the stairs to the ground floor.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands closed to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go northwest


 You unlock the rusty metal door with the old iron key, open it and
 step into the workshop.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Workshop</span>
 Odd devices and machines fill this room. Half-finished projects lie
 abandoned in the middle of the floor, and various completed ones are
 pushed up against the walls. A window on the northern wall admits some
 light into the room. The main hall lies through the open doorway to
 the southeast.

 A sturdy hand drill lies here.

 A pair of black goggles have been carelessly discarded here.

 One of the machines catches your eye. It is a cylindrical drum device,
 with a lever on one side.

 A stone blast furnace of the sort used for smelting iron sits here,
 firmly shut.

 possibly state-of-the-art in this world.

>examine googles


 Try as you might, you can see no googles here.

>examine goggles


 These goggles are comprised of two individual eye-sized cups, joined
 by a rubber bridge for the nose. There is also a thick sturdy strap to
 hold the goggles on your head. The lenses are almost completely
 opaque.

>examine machine


 A cylindrical ball mill, used for grinding chemicals together. It is
 fairly large, but the crank on the side shows that it is nevertheless
 meant to be turned by hand. It has a metal cover which is currently
 closed.

>open cover


 You open the ball mill, revealing some heavy lead balls.

>examine balls


 Lead balls line the inside. When the mill is rotated, the lead balls
 crush the different elements together, forming new chemical compounds.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go west


 You head down the stone passageway and emerge into the bright sunshine
 of the courtyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large portcullis sealing off the bailey passage
 directly across the courtyard. Beyond the portcullis is a short
 passageway, followed by a set of iron-banded wooden doors, massive and
 imposing. To the east is the passage back into the tower.

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>go west


 The portcullis blocks further passage to the west.

>go up


 You clamber up the stairs beside the bailey.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atop the West Wall</span>
 The landscape of this strange place stretches out from the caer west
 to the horizon. Cultivated fields are spread out below, a
 multicoloured cloak draped over the shoulders of the land. A dry
 ribbon of road runs past the caer heading northeast and southwest
 through the fields. Villages, visible as small clusters of buildings,
 dot the farmlands. The fields continue flat and level for quite some
 distance, gradually leading into more hilly country. Beyond the hills,
 far in the distance, the many spires and towers of a city or large
 fortress rise up to touch the sky.

 The caer wall stretches away to the north and south. The wall is very
 wide here, encompassing the entire width of the bailey below. A small
 stone building perches on the wall to the west. The courtyard is back
 down the stairs to the east.

>go west


 You step inside the gatehouse.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gatehouse</span>
 The area above the bailey is a small, square stone room, bare and
 featureless but for the holes riddling the floor, used for pouring
 boiling oil or water over invaders in the bailey below. A doorway east
 leads back out to the top of the wall.

 A scarred and rusted machine fills the western wall of the room.

>examine machine


 The machine looms ominously against the western wall of this room. It
 is scarred and pitted with age, the rusting metal of its construction
 flaking away. Various gears, hoses and wheels line the front of the
 machine and large chains rise up out of holes in the floor to loop
 around some of the gears on the machine.

 The most comprehensible part of the whole thing is a small funnel or
 spout that sticks out of the right hand side. There is a small brass
 plate affixed to the front of the machine.

 one of the hoses snaps free and falls to the ground.

 As if the snapping of the hose was a signal to stop, the wheels slow,

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bailey</span>
 This short stone passageway leads from the portcullis to the east to
 the large double doors out of the caer to the west. Looking up, you
 can see several holes bored through the stone ceiling, presumably for
 dropping boiling oil or water down on the heads of invaders. West,
 huge iron-banded double doors loom imposingly.

>go west


 You can't, since the huge wooden doors are in the way.

>open doors


 The doors appear well and truly locked, and you don't have a key to
 fit the massive lock.

>examine lock


 These wooden doors lead outside the caer. They are large and imposing,
 and reinforced with large strips of iron. They loom here imposingly,
 blocking your way out of the caer.

>unlock door


 The doors appear well and truly locked, and you don't have a key to

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large open portcullis directly across the
 courtyard. Beyond the portcullis is a short passageway, followed by a
 set of iron-banded wooden doors, massive and imposing. To the east is
 the passage back into the tower.

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>go east


 You head down the stone passageway back into the gloom of the tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go up


 You ascend gingerly to the first floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go up


 You ascend the winding stairs into the warm sunshine on top of the
 tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower</span>
 Sun beats down from high overhead, warming the flagstones of the
 tower. A commanding and breathtaking view of the fields and pastures
 surrounding the caer greets you in every direction. In addition, there
 is a good view of the courtyard below, with its beautiful alabaster
 fountain. You also see the portcullis and catch a glimpse of the
 double wooden doors beyond it. The stairs in the centre of the tower
 lead back down to the first floor.

 A cannon sits here, aimed to the north, out over the caer wall.

>push cannon down


 You tilt the cannon and aim it briefly at the floor, but nothing rolls
 out.

>push cannon down stairs


 I only understood you as far as wanting to push the cannon down.

>examine cannon


 The cannon is large and menacing. It looks a very powerful model, with
 a bore some ten inches in diameter. There is a small plaque affixed to
 the side of the barrel and a pull cord hangs from the breech end.
 Heavy trunnions and framing support the cannon, mounting it securely
 to a large and weighty swivel base. The base rotates, allowing the
 cannon to be aimed at different targets.

 The cannon currently points to the north, out over the caer wall.

>examine plaque

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large

 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go northwest


 You step through the doorway into the workshop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Workshop</span>
 Odd devices and machines fill this room. Half-finished projects lie
 abandoned in the middle of the floor, and various completed ones are
 pushed up against the walls. A window on the northern wall admits some
 light into the room. The main hall lies through the open doorway to
 the southeast.

 One of the machines catches your eye. It is a cylindrical drum device,
 with a lever on one side.

 A stone blast furnace of the sort used for smelting iron sits here,
 gaping open.

 blast, the cannon rocking alarmingly on its swivel base, but the
 cannonball shoots forth!

>about


 I started this game in March of 2003 when I rediscovered r.a.i-f and
 first heard of the Inform programming language.

 It was created using gVim on a Duron 1.3GHz machine running Linux. A
 patched build of the Inform compiler and library files were used in
 compilation.

 The idea for the plot grew out of a short story I had started to write
 about a student being accidentally sucked into the internship
 programme in an alternate dimension. That was about the extent of the
 story when I started the game, and it has grown from there.

 The name of the game came from my desire to capture the idea that the
 Wizards Guild were suppressing a magical society on the verge of
 breaking through into the age of reason. Risorgimento is a legitimate
 English word, taken from Italian, meaning <span class="floydstyle em">a time of renewal or</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">renaissance</span>. Once I had chosen one Italian word, I opted for
 <span class="floydstyle em">Risorgimento Represso</span> for its literal meaning of
 <span class="floydstyle em">Renaissance Repressed</span>.

 The game and hints were completed by July 1, 2003, and the first beta
 release to the testers was made at that time.

 The second beta-release followed on August 31, and the testers were
 then given one final version to look over on September 17. The initial
 competition release was built on September 24, and uploaded to the IF
 Comp website.

 Note that spellings of some words may look incorrect. This is because
 British spellings have been used throughout, given the main
 character's nationality. Of particular note is the word "carcase"
 which may look wrong but is, in fact, correct. Also, in Europe, the
 ground level of a building is often referred to as the "ground floor",
 and climbing the first set of stairs takes you up to the "first
 floor."

 hang dispiritedly from their hinges, twisted hunks of wood and iron.

 From here you can head east back into the bailey, or along the road to

>go southwest

 You march down the long southwest road, dust billowing around your
 feet. The road is long and straight, an arrow fired directly
 southwest. After a lengthy walk, you arrive at the Vechlee town gate
 and step through into the bustle of the town.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vechlee Gate</span>
 Vechlee seems a bustling and thriving town. The foot traffic is
 impressive here just inside the town gate. The street is not terribly
 wide, but does boast the impressive upgrade of cobblestones.
 Southwest, the avenue continues and widens out into a large square.
 North, the road heads into the more professional quarter of North
 Vechlee. To the northeast is the town gate, leading back to the dusty
 road to Ninario's caer.

 A small shop lies to the south, a wooden sign wedged into the
 cobblestones in front of it.

 The sign is mounted on a stout wooden post, wedged securely between
 the cobblestones in front of the shop.

 You open the shop door and step into Eliza's Cheese Emporium.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eliza's Cheese Emporium</span>
 Emptiness and silence greet you in this small and ordinary cheese
 shop. The shop is devoid of both staff and customers. It looks like it
 would have been a nice cozy little shop though, friendly and
 family-run, the kind of place where the staff remember your favourite
 cheeses, but can also sense when you're looking for something a little
 more adventurous, a little venture beyond your usual territory. The
 air is still scented with the aroma of many different cheeses mingled
 together. The open door to the north leads back to the street.

 There is a large counter lining the southern wall of the shop.
 Although the shop appears abandoned, sitting atop the counter is some
 Asiago, some Bel Paese, some Caerphilly, some Wensleydale, some
 Camembert, some Gouda, some Emmental, some Stilton, some Miranda, some

 NOTICE TO CUSTOMERS:
 Because the cheaper and far superior products offered at Wizardry
 Wooding (conveniently located just across the street) threatened
 our slim margins of profitability William's Woodcraft was forced
 as of the end of this summer to cease business and close up shop.
 At Wizardry Wooding prices are so much better it was foolish to
 continue competing with them. It was a tricky decision to close.

>go west

 You step into the empty silence of the abandoned shop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">William's Woodcraft</span>
 The competition from Wizardry Wooding has hit William's Woodcraft
 hard. The one-room storefront and workshop has been utterly abandoned,
 its remaining stock snapped up by Wizardry Wooding, leaving it without
 even the dignity of boards over the windows. A few lonely wood
 shavings are the only remaining testament to a once brisk and bustling
 trade.

 The sprawling streets of North Vechlee lie back through the doorway to
 the east.

 About the only item of stock that seems to have been left behind is a
 familiar-looking stone bottle.

>examine bottle

 It's another bottle of WizStrip. It looks exactly like those stone
 bottles of ginger beer, but the label on the side reads <span class="floydstyle em">WizStrip</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Paint Stripper, Industrial Strength</span>. Then in smaller letters:

 Stark plain utilitarianism seems to be the order of the day in this
 shop. The room is large and bare, save for a counter on the east side,
 just in front of a curtained doorway. The street lies out the doorway
 to the west.

 An older woman stands behind the counter, dealing with a customer, a
 large burly man.

 "Well, I'm sorry, luv," says the shopkeeper, "but the original order
 quite clearly says <span class="floydstyle em">red</span> mahogany, and there's your signature
 at the bottom. Did you want to wait for the black to come in?"

 The burly man looks around in some consternation. "But it's taken five
 weeks just to get this order. How much longer would black mahogany
 take?"

 The shopkeeper purses her lips. "Ooh, that would take another five to
 six at least, luv, I'm sorry. D'you know any wizards? If you did, I
 could p'raps bump you up the list a bit."

 "Bah!" snorts the man in disgust. "When I used to deal with William,
 this never happened." He turns to stomp out of the store. "Wizards,"
 he mutters as he passes you, looking darkly at your robes.

 The shopkeeper sighs as he leaves. "Customers," she smiles, looking at
 you. "Now, luv, you look like a nice wizard's apprentice, what can I
 do for you?"

>ask shopkeeper about william

 "Isn't it such a shame, luv?" asks the shopkeeper, shaking her head.
 "He was such a nice man of course, but selling all that ordinary plain
 wood to all those customers... all without Guild sanction. Poor
 dearie. He should have seen it coming."

>ask shopkeeper about cheese

 The shopkeeper's eyes narrow. "I sell wood," she says, a bit
 menacingly, "not cheese. You want cheese, go visit Eliza Stilton's
 place."

>ask shopkeeper about guild

 "Ooh, I wouldn't worry about that at all if I were you, luv," smiles
 the shopkeeper. "Best not to, really."

>ask shopkeeper about wood
>ask shopkeeper about Ninario

 The shopkeeper brightens visibly and pulls herself off the counter.
 "So you're interested in some wood are you? Well, let me run down what
 we've got, luv."

 She takes a deep breath.

 "We've got alder, ash, aspen, balsa, bamboo, basswood, birch,
 butternut, cedar, dark cedar, white cedar, red cedar, cherry,
 chestnut, cottonwood, cypress, ebony, elm, soft elm, rock elm, fir,
 hawthorn, hemlock, hickory, holly..." She trails off.

 "Half a mo, and let me catch my breath, luv." She pauses and fills her
 lungs again.

 "We've also got larch, maple, hard maple, soft maple, mahogany, red
 mahogany, black mahogany, myrtle, pecan, persimmon, pine, red pine,
 white pine, dried pine, knotty pine, dried knotty pine, spruce,
 redwood, rosewood, rowan, sycamore, teak, willow and black willow."

 "Now then luv," smiles the shopkeeper. "Which would you like?"


 "I haven't seen him in quite a while, the poor dear," frowns the
 shopkeeper. "Of course, he's in a bit of a legal squabble with the
 guild, so I'm sure he's busy."

>take all

 It's unclear what you're referring to.

>go west

 You step back out into the sunshine, and draw a cleansing breath of
 air.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Vechlee</span>
 The sprawling professional district of North Vechlee is home to many
 artists, craftspeople, tradesfolk and their families. Their shops and
 houses fill the small cluttered streets.

 An oddly silent shop lies to the west. It seems to have fallen upon
 hard economic times and is utterly abandoned, lacking even the dignity
 of boards over the windows. A sign over the door reads <span class="floydstyle em">William's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Woodcraft</span>.

 On the east side of the street is a prosperous and thriving business.
 Gold lettering over the entranceway reads <span class="floydstyle em">Wizardry Wooding</span>.

 The street leads back south to the town gate.

 A notice is attached to the door of the abandoned shop.

>go south

 You head back south to the town gate.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vechlee Gate</span>
 Vechlee seems a bustling and thriving town. The foot traffic is
 impressive here just inside the town gate. The street is not terribly
 wide, but does boast the impressive upgrade of cobblestones.
 Southwest, the avenue continues and widens out into a large square.
 North, the road heads into the more professional quarter of North
 Vechlee. To the northeast is the town gate, leading back to the dusty
 road to Ninario's caer.

 A small shop lies to the south, a wooden sign wedged into the
 cobblestones in front of it.

>go southwest

 You push southwest through the crowd to the market square.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Market Square</span>
 A bustle of people and activity fills this cobblestoned market square.
 The people of Vechlee hurry about their business, intent on their
 daily tasks with barely a glance to spare for a lowly wizard's
 apprentice, otherworldly or not.

 Many different shops and establishments line the edges of the square.
 To the north is a sturdy workmanlike building, falling into disrepair.
 Large letters over the entrance read <span class="floydstyle em">Vechlee Townspeople Building</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Society</span>. To the south is a sprawling commercial edifice, with a
 seemingly endless stream of wizards pushing their way through the
 doors. Gilt-edged lettering over the door reads <span class="floydstyle em">Wizards Guild</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Savings & Loan</span>.

 To the northwest is a small shop, notable more for the lack of
 customers streaming into it than any other distinguishing
 characteristic. Small hand-lettered writing over the doorway reads
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sorcery Supply</span>. Southwest, the cobblestoned road heads out of
 the square and toward the western outskirts of Vechlee. Back to the
 northeast lies the town gate.

 An abandoned market stall sits here, weathered and worn, a yellowed
 piece of paper attached to its side.

>read paper

 (the yellowed piece of paper)
 Due to the constant annoying stream of customers that owning a
 business seems to have generated, I have retired to the mountains to
 pursue life as a hermit. Do <span class="floydstyle em">not</span> come to visit, do
 <span class="floydstyle em">not</span> come to buy nice shiny objects for your hearth and home
 at low, low prices and above all, do <span class="floydstyle em">not</span> come to offer me one
 more chance to purchase anything that slices, dices, purees or chops
 -- Robert

 At the bottom of the note, a different hand has added:

 Yes, we at the Bureau of Public Works are aware that this stall has
 been abandoned for some three weeks now. The problem will be dealt
 with as soon as the necessary Temporary Stall Removal Forms are
 processed by the Bureau of Stamping, Filing and Collating (now a
 wholly licensed subsidiary of the Wizards Guild). Kindly stop dropping
 by to inform us of the abandoned stall, as the crowds of helpful
 people are creating needlessly long lines in the Bureau and ruining
 the graceful architectural lines of the lobby. -- B.P.W.

>go north

 You push through the throngs of people in the square and into the
 empty silence of the Vechlee Townspeople Building Society.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vechlee Townspeople Building Society</span>
 It seems this building society's fortunes have fallen rather sharply
 of late. Every scrap of furniture, all the dividing walls, counters
 and so on one would expect to see in a bank have all been ripped up,
 leaving a hollow empty shell. A forlorn sign on the wall tells
 customers about the competitive loan rates and exciting investment
 opportunities.

 Whoever cleaned the bank out was not completely thorough; sunlight
 glints on a small gold coin in the corner of the room.

>take coin

 Taken.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine coin

 This small coin, about the same size as a pound coin, is minted
 beautifully in gold, and feels wonderfully solid in the hand. The
 edges are smooth and unmilled. The obverse shows the profile of a
 regal looking chap along with the inscription <span class="floydstyle em">Turthalion: D G</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Regis F D.</span> The reverse shows plumes in a coronet, with the word
 <span class="floydstyle em">Plotkins</span> above and the number <span class="floydstyle em">10</span> below.

>examine sign

 The sign advertises the building society's low, low loan rates and
 excellent investment opportunities.

 <span class="floydstyle em">We will beat all Wizards Guild Savings Bank quotes!</span> is one of
 several of its claims.

 You step back into the bustle of the market square.

>go northwest

 You step out of the bustle of the market square and into the dimly lit
 quiet of Sorcery Supply.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sorcery Supply</span>
 Eerie ghostly light flows dimly into this shop from unseen sources,
 bathing everything in an almost mystical glow. The smell of incense
 and various magical chemicals and powders lend the shop a heady aroma
 that makes your head spin. The room is steeped in a palpable air of
 magic. Southeast is the doorway back to the market square, whose
 bright sunshine and loud noises seem a distant memory.

 "Greetings, young apprentice!" calls the shopkeeper, an old crone
 sitting in a rocking chair. "Welcome to Sorcery Supply, <span class="floydstyle em">the</span>
 place for all manner of spellcasting paraphernalia."

 A glass trophy case filled with expensive merchandise catches your
 eye.

 Sitting prominently displayed on a wooden stand is a silver bowl.

>examine bowl

 Which do you mean, the silver bowl or the ceramic bowl?

>examine silver

 A large silver bowl, beautifully made. The sides are delicately worked
 with bas-relief of farm scenes, rural folk about their everyday
 business: milking cows, shearing sheep, churning butter and making
 cheese.

 The old crone jots something down on a piece of paper and nods
 approvingly.

>ask crone about silver

 "It is a bowl of scrying," says the old crone, "used for divination.
 The object whose divine mysteries you wish to explore is placed
 inside. The bowl works its magic, and then you look deeply into it and
 divine the future, the past, or other hidden secrets." The old crone
 coughs and slips out of her salespitch style. "Artisan-direct pricing,
 only five plotkins."

>ask crone about cheese

 A sudden gleam comes into the old crone's eyes. "Cheese, my dear
 student, that's the true secret to divination. Cheese!" She falls
 silent, an odd but pensive smile on her face.

>ask crone about gouda

 A sudden gleam comes into the old crone's eyes. "Cheese, my dear
 student, that's the true secret to divination. Cheese!" She falls
 silent, an odd but pensive smile on her face.

 The old woman flicks an eye in your direction. "Still here, are you?
 Well, tell that bumbleheaded fool Ninario I said hello."

>ask crone about ninario

 "Ninario the wizard? He and I are <span class="floydstyle em">very</span> old friends," says the
 old crone. "The main word being <span class="floydstyle em">old</span>," she adds, cackling.
 "Yes, little Magic Bunny and I have known each other for a very long
 time."

>ask crone about Magic Bunny

 "No, my dear, trust me. A young thing like you doesn't want to hear
 about what old biddies like your master and I used to get up to.
 Suffice to say, we weren't always this old."

 "Eye of newt," mutters the old crone glancing at a piece of paper in
 her hand. "How provincial."

>examine case

 The interior of the glass trophy case is lined with shelves. Resting
 on the shelves are a coil of rope, a nasty-looking knife, a brass
 lantern, an Elvish sword of great antiquity and a jewel-encrusted egg.

>open case

 The old crone slaps your hand away. "If you're interested in
 something, ask."

 "Are you going to buy something," asks the old crone suddenly, "or
 just stand there like a lump in a bog? This isn't the student lounge,
 you know."

>ask crone about zork

 "Oh you never know what those Implementors are up to," says the old
 crone with a touch of frustration. "They've been pretty quiet for a
 number of years, though."

>ask crone about rope

 "Rope," says the old crone. "As one infamous reluctant hero once said,
 <span class="floydstyle em">you'll want it, if you haven't got it</span>. Don't get hung up on a
 forgotten rope. Yours for the mere pittance of thirteen plotkins."

>ask crone about knife

 "You won't find a nastier one," says the old crone. "Never dulls. A
 steal at twenty-seven plotkins."
>ask crone about wood


 "Rather than admit ignorance on any topic, the elderly prefer to feign
 deafness and ignore the question altogether," says the old crone.
 "Watch as I demonstrate."

>ask crone about egg

 "Ah, these were all the rage a number of years ago," says the old
 crone. "Of course, this one was one of the earliest; they proved so
 popular <span class="floydstyle em">everyone</span> started making them. Then the makers of this
 original one got into making office fripperies for the business world,
 and the whole market for these eggs collapsed." She sighs and shakes
 her head. "This one's going for one hundred and five plotkins."

>ask crone about sword

 "Of ancient Elvish workmanship," says the old crone. "A rare bargain
 at only seventy-three plotkins." She pauses. "I've never been certain
 why we've got Elvish swords, but no Elves. Odd."

>ask crone about lantern

 "Ah, the brass lantern," says the old crone. "Just the thing for
 exploring extinct underground empires. This magical variety never runs
 out of power. A paltry forty-seven plotkins and it's yours."

 "Are you going to buy something," asks the old crone suddenly, "or
 just stand there like a lump in a bog? This isn't the student lounge,
 you know."

 "Ah, the discerning eye of the student picks out the best bargain,"
 says the old crone "5 plotkins will suffice to purchase the bowl of
 scrying." She takes the 10 plotkin piece in her hand, snaps her
 fingers strangely, and hands it back to you. You notice that it is now
 silver instead of gold.

 She waves her hand toward the silver bowl. "It's yours," she tells
 you. "Use it well."

 You lift the silver bowl from the stand.

 The silver bowl is empty.

 You drop the Gouda into the silver bowl. For a moment, nothing
 happens. Then, astoundingly, the cheese begins to break down, as it
 reverses the coagulating process and turns into a lumpy mess of raw
 curds. The bowl hums as it slowly consumes the raw curds to fuel its
 visionary powers. The bowl begins to glow with an otherworldly light
 and you gaze into its glowing silvery depths.

 Slowly, a scene forms in the depths of the bowl. You bend closer and
 suddenly feel yourself being pulled into the bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch black. This is madness! You have no concept of the dangers
 that lurk in the darkness of this strange and magical world.

 Suddenly, abruptly, the vision fades, and you are back where you
 started.

 The last of the Gouda vanishes from the bowl with a curious sucking
 sound and the bowl goes dim.

>put steel key in bowl

 You need to be holding the small steel key before you can put it into
 something else.

>put coin in bowl

 (the silver bowl)
 You drop the small silver coin into the silver bowl. Nothing happens;
 no vision of the future appears, no secret mysteries of the universe
 are revealed. Disappointed, you remove it from the bowl.

 "Good luck with the scrying bowl!" calls the old crone as you step
 out.

 You step back out of the dim and dusty shop into the brilliant
 sunshine of the market square.

 northeast lies the town gate.

 An abandoned market stall sits here, weathered and worn, a yellowed
 piece of paper attached to its side.

>go south

 You push your way through the throng of wizards and into the Wizards
 Guild Savings & Loan. Before you can take another step, a short and
 rather ugly guard grabs you.

 "Oi! Non-wizard banking hours are from eleven until three every second
 Wednesday." He pushes you back out into the street, wagging a finger.

>search stall

 The whole thing looks in imminent danger of collapsing, so it might be
 safer not to disturb it any further.

>se

 You can head north into the Vechlee Townspeople Building Society,
 south into the Wizards Guild Savings & Loan or northwest into Sorcery
 Supply.

 The street also heads northeast to the town gate, or southwest to the
 outskirts.

>go southwest

 You push your way out of the market square and head southwest through
 ever-thinning crowds to the outskirts of Vechlee.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts</span>
 The westernmost outskirts of Vechlee contrast sharply with the
 bustling and thriving town you glimpsed at the east gate. Here at the
 west gate, the foot traffic is nonexistent, and Vechlee seems quiet
 and peaceful, almost eerily so. The street is narrow and cobblestoned,
 and heads west out of the city. The market square is back to the
 northeast and south is the entrance to a large and impressive looking
 building.

 A bored-looking guard lounges beside the entrance to the Guild Hall.
 When he sees you, he straightens up with a sigh, trying vainly to look
 interested in his job.

>go south

 The guard raises a hand as you approach. "Studen' mun ev wizzurds wiv

 The guard sighs and shifts his stance slightly.

>go west

 You head out the western gates of the town.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Vechlee</span>
 The peace and quiet of a summer countryside surround you once again,
 here outside the walls of Vechlee. The cobblestones have vanished and
 the road has reverted to a plain dirt ribbon snaking its way west.
 Hilly mountainous country borders the road to the north and a small
 path wends that way, climbing up into the crags. East are the walls of
 Vechlee, their broad expanse interrupted by both the gate back into
 town as well as the end of a rusty metal pipe that sticks out of the
 wall.

 A small wooden sign sits at the side of the road leading west.

>examine sign

 The sign is mounted on a steel post driven into the grass at the side
 of the road.

 Blumph: 40 miles

>examine pipe

 The sewer outflow pipe rises up into the wall surrounding Vechlee, and
 looks like it connects to the vast sewer system inside the city. It's
 about a foot in diameter.

>look in pipe

 You find nothing of interest.

>go north

 The narrow path twists and turns up the side of the mountain. It's not
 too hard of a climb, but it certainly gets the limbs moving and the
 heart pumping. Eventually, the path you are following narrows.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ledge</span>
 The path narrows to a ledge here that curves around the side of the
 mountain. East is a towering wall of rock, west a nasty tumble off the
 cliffside. The narrow path heads south back down the mountain, and to
 the north, the ledge opens up into a wide plateau.

 A black bear blocks the trail north here, pawing at the carcase of
 some unfortunate animal.

>wear rug

 (first taking the bearskin rug)
 You duck under the rug. The smell and heat are oppressive, but it's
 possible to peer through the mouth to see your way around.

>roar

 You roar loudly, attempting to attract some attention.

 The bear doesn't seem too bothered by your roar.

>kiss bear

 The bear roars and swipes at you with a massive claw. You back away
 hurriedly, keeping your affections to yourself.

>dance

 Using that verb will not appreciably help.

>remove rug

 The stench of the rug wins in the end, and you duck back out from
 under it. Phew!

>examine bear

 The black bear has a long, straight muzzle, large teeth and short
 sharp claws. It looks very menacing.

>go north

 The black bear rears up on its hind legs and roars angrily. It doesn't
 want you interfering with its meal.

>go east

 It's doubtful that you could scale the wall of rock, certainly not
 without mountaineering equipment.

>go south

 The narrow path twists and turns down the mountainside. It's much
 easier going back down than coming up.

 You step through the arched doorway into the vaulted splendour of the
 guild hall foyer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Hall Foyer</span>
 The opulent splendour of the guild hall foyer is almost overwhelming.
 Huge marble columns rise up to hold the vaulted ceiling in place, and
 the marble walls and floor seem to glow and shimmer with a queer
 internal light. At the western end of the room, an ornate marble
 staircase ascends to the first floor. A doorway leads south into a
 large kitchen, and a small closet lies east. The doorway to the north
 leads back to the street.

>go east

 You open the door and step into the closet.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Closet</span>
 Small and cramped, this tiny closet is barely large enough to turn
 around in. It is devoid of supplies of any kind, but is obviously used
 for maintenance purposes, rather than storage. The hall is back to the
 west.

 A small copper pipe runs down the southern wall, entering the closet
 from the floor above and descending down to depths unknown.

 Near the bottom of the eastern wall, at floor level, is a rectangular
 grille-covered opening.

 The rectangular shaped opening is covered with a metal grille. Beyond
 the grille, you can see a duct extending upwards. It's probably an air

 Huge marble columns rise up to hold the vaulted ceiling in place, and
 the marble walls and floor seem to glow and shimmer with a queer
 internal light. At the western end of the room, an ornate marble
 staircase ascends to the first floor. A doorway leads south into a
 large kitchen, and a small closet lies east. The doorway to the north
 leads back to the street.

>go south

 You head south into the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Gleaming pots and pans line the walls of this expansive and rather
 barren kitchen. A well-scrubbed pine table occupies the middle of the
 room. The foyer lies back to the north.

 Embedded in the southern wall of the kitchen is a dumb waiter attached
 to a system of ropes and pulleys. Resting on the dumb waiter is a
 silver tea tray. On the tray, you can see some cold chicken and a
 bottle of ginger beer.

 Although the kitchen is deserted, someone has left a stick of
 margarine sitting on the table here.

>take all

 cold chicken: Taken.
 bottle of ginger beer: (putting the Emmental into the raspberry
 satchel to make room)
 Taken.
 stick of margarine: (putting the Stilton into the raspberry satchel to
 make room)
 Taken.

>examine tabke

 Try as you might, you can see no tabke here.

>examine table

 The pine table is smooth and level, crafted of soft white pine.

>examine pots

 Miscellaneous pots and pans line the walls of the kitchen. They look
 in pristine condition, and you wonder if they have ever been used.

>enter dumbwaiter

 Try as you might, you can see no dumbwaiter here.

>enter dumb waiter

 Unfortunately, it wasn't designed to accomodate students. Dumb waiter.

>go east

 The only way out is north back to the foyer.

 You step back into the foyer.

>go west

 You ascend the ornate marble staircase to the first floor, but just as
 you reach the top, a burly guard appears. "First floor is off-limits
 to apprentices," he booms in stentorian tones.

 He sends you marching back down the stairs, watching to make sure you
 go.

 A bright yellow stick of margarine.

 like it.

>examine ginger

 A bottle of ginger beer. It looks identical to the bottle of WizStrip,
 save for the lack of a warning label on the side.

 You put the bottle of WizStrip on the silver tea tray.

 You're not certain how to raise this dumb waiter. Perhaps it's only
 meant to be pulled up from above.

 Huge marble columns rise up to hold the vaulted ceiling in place, and

 staircase ascends to the first floor. A doorway leads south into a
 large kitchen, and a small closet lies east. The doorway to the north
 leads back to the street.

>tell guard about dinner

 Try as you might, you can see no guard here.

>go up

 You ascend the ornate marble staircase once again. Just as you reach
 the top and think you're in the clear, two pairs of arms reach out,
 and grab you. The two guards now posted at the top of the stairs
 frogmarch you back down. "Don't you listen?" bellows the stentorian
 one. "Off-limits!"

 They march back up the stairs.

>ring silver bowl

 Using that verb will not appreciably help.

>put margarine in silver bowl

 You drop the stick of margarine into the silver bowl. Nothing happens;
 no vision of the future appears, no secret mysteries of the universe
 are revealed. Disappointed, you remove it from the bowl.

>put Wensleydale in silver

 You need to be holding the Wensleydale before you can put it into
 something else.

>take Wensleydale

 Taken.

>put Wensleydale in silver

 You drop the Wensleydale into the silver bowl. As the cheese breaks
 down, the bowl begins to glow with an otherworldly light and you gaze
 into its glowing silvery depths.

 Slowly, a scene forms in the depths of the bowl. You bend closer and
 suddenly feel yourself being pulled into the bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cell</span>
 This small stone room seems to have only recently been converted into
 a cell. There is a short stone bench jutting out from the wall, with a
 familiar round hole roughly in the middle of it. The Guild seem to
 have temporarily given over their main toilet for incarcerating
 Ninario. However magical the Guild are, it doesn't extend to their
 bodily functions; the smell in here is definitely not what you would
 call magical.

 Ninario glances at the small opening to the toilet distastefully.
 "After you, I'm sure, my dear student. Mm-yes."

 Suddenly, abruptly, the vision fades, and you are back where you
 started.

 The last of the Wensleydale vanishes from the bowl with a curious
 sucking sound and the bowl goes dim.

>go north

 You step from the vast echoing foyer of the Guild Hall into the
 street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts</span>
 The westernmost outskirts of Vechlee contrast sharply with the
 bustling and thriving town you glimpsed at the east gate. Here at the
 west gate, the foot traffic is nonexistent, and Vechlee seems quiet
 and peaceful, almost eerily so. The street is narrow and cobblestoned,
 and heads west out of the city. The market square is back to the
 northeast and south is the entrance to a large and impressive looking
 building.

 You step from the vast echoing foyer of the Guild Hall into the
 street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts</span>
 The westernmost outskirts of Vechlee contrast sharply with the
 bustling and thriving town you glimpsed at the east gate. Here at the
 west gate, the foot traffic is nonexistent, and Vechlee seems quiet
 and peaceful, almost eerily so. The street is narrow and cobblestoned,
 and heads west out of the city. The market square is back to the
 northeast and south is the entrance to a large and impressive looking
 building.

>go northeast

 You return to the crowded bustle of the market square.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Market Square</span>
 A bustle of people and activity fills this cobblestoned market square.
 The people of Vechlee hurry about their business, intent on their
 daily tasks with barely a glance to spare for a lowly wizard's
 apprentice, otherworldly or not.

 Many different shops and establishments line the edges of the square.
 To the north is a sturdy workmanlike building, falling into disrepair.
 Large letters over the entrance read <span class="floydstyle em">Vechlee Townspeople Building</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Society</span>. To the south is a sprawling commercial edifice, with a
 seemingly endless stream of wizards pushing their way through the
 doors. Gilt-edged lettering over the door reads <span class="floydstyle em">Wizards Guild</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Savings & Loan</span>.

 To the northwest is a small shop, notable more for the lack of
 customers streaming into it than any other distinguishing
 characteristic. Small hand-lettered writing over the doorway reads
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sorcery Supply</span>. Southwest, the cobblestoned road heads out of
 the square and toward the western outskirts of Vechlee. Back to the
 northeast lies the town gate.

 An abandoned market stall sits here, weathered and worn, a yellowed
 piece of paper attached to its side.

>go southwest

 You push your way out of the market square and head southwest through
 ever-thinning crowds to the outskirts of Vechlee.

>go west

 You head out the western gates of the town.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Vechlee</span>
 The peace and quiet of a summer countryside surround you once again,
 here outside the walls of Vechlee. The cobblestones have vanished and
 the road has reverted to a plain dirt ribbon snaking its way west.
 Hilly mountainous country borders the road to the north and a small
 path wends that way, climbing up into the crags. East are the walls of
 Vechlee, their broad expanse interrupted by both the gate back into
 town as well as the end of a rusty metal pipe that sticks out of the
 wall.

 A small wooden sign sits at the side of the road leading west.

>go north

 The narrow path twists and turns up the side of the mountain. It's not
 too hard of a climb, but it certainly gets the limbs moving and the
 heart pumping. Eventually, the path you are following narrows.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ledge</span>
 The path narrows to a ledge here that curves around the side of the
 mountain. East is a towering wall of rock, west a nasty tumble off the
 cliffside. The narrow path heads south back down the mountain, and to
 the north, the ledge opens up into a wide plateau.

 A black bear blocks the trail north here, pawing at the carcase of
 some unfortunate animal.

>throw chicken to bear

 I only understood you as far as wanting to throw the cold chicken.

>give chicken to bear

 The bear sniffs briefly at the cold chicken but doesn't show any other
 interest.

>go south

 The narrow path twists and turns down the mountainside. It's much
 easier going back down than coming up.

>go west

 You glance at the sign, which reads <span class="floydstyle em">Blumph: 40 miles</span>, and
 reconsider. You'll need a faster means of transportation than your
 feet.

>examine pipe

 The sewer outflow pipe rises up into the wall surrounding Vechlee, and
 looks like it connects to the vast sewer system inside the city. It's
 about a foot in diameter.

 You walk back into the outskirts of Vechlee.

>climb stall

 The buzz of many voices and conversations swells in the crowd around
 you.

>examine crowd

 The townsfolk of Vechlee all look extremely busy, hurrying about their
 business. There's certainly a wide cross-section of society
 represented.

>examine flare

 The magnesium cylinder has been twisted and glows intensely, providing
 illumination. It glows so brightly that looking directly at it is
 difficult.

 You drop the Caerphilly into the silver bowl. As the cheese breaks

 into its glowing silvery depths.

 Everything goes fuzzy and indistinct. Annoyingly, it seems to stay
 that way. You can see things happening in the bowl, a scene of the
 future being played out, but you can make out nothing of the details,
 no matter how hard you look. Eventually, the last of the Caerphilly
 vanishes from the bowl with a curious sucking sound and the bowl goes
 dim.

 Slowly, a scene forms in the depths of the bowl. You bend closer and
 suddenly feel yourself being pulled into the bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Mountaintop</span>
 Sunlight beats down warmly from high overhead this bald and barren
 mountaintop. It's extremely hot, and the trees and grass have faded
 away, leaving a bare smooth expanse of rock. The wind is stronger
 here, and whips your robe against your legs. West, the mountain trail
 winds back down toward the plateau.

 A small shoddily built lean-to sits here.

 "Why was I made to suffer so?" wails the hermit suddenly. "I came up
 here with every good intention of getting away from society and having
 time to contemplate, but all I can think about is the burning pain in
 my eyes. If only I could find a way to shield my eyes from all this
 sunlight!"

 Suddenly, abruptly, the vision fades, and you are back where you
 started.

 The last of the Asiago vanishes from the bowl with a curious sucking
 sound and the bowl goes dim.

 He shakes your hand firmly and wholeheartedly and then charges off, a

 The last of the Camembert vanishes from the bowl with a curious

 The crowd disperses briefly, like waves breaking on shore, but then

 The peak of ancient plumbing technology, the garderobe is a fairly
 simple affair: a short stone bench jutting out from the wall with the
 usual-sized hole roughly in the middle of it, and a rack for reading
 material attached to the wall. The only odd thing is the lack of any
 toilet paper. Perhaps it's all accomplished magically. A small narrow

 Eerie ghostly light flows dimly into this shop from unseen sources,
 bathing everything in an almost mystical glow. The smell of incense
 and various magical chemicals and powders lend the shop a heady aroma
 that makes your head spin. The room is steeped in a palpable air of
 magic. Southeast is the doorway back to the market square, whose
 bright sunshine and loud noises seem a distant memory.

 The old crone sits and rocks slowly back and forth on her chair.

 A glass trophy case filled with expensive merchandise catches your
 eye.

 Sitting prominently displayed on a wooden stand is a silver bowl.

 "'Course, on t'other 'and, if ah gave 'at ti ploomber's union, they

 "Diz-ta reely want ti gi' ma that?" he asks doubtfully. "Ah's nivver

 He shakes your hand firmly and wholeheartedly and then charges off, a

>go south

 You step through the arched doorway into the vaulted splendour of the
 guild hall foyer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Hall Foyer</span>
 The opulent splendour of the guild hall foyer is almost overwhelming.
 Huge marble columns rise up to hold the vaulted ceiling in place, and
 the marble walls and floor seem to glow and shimmer with a queer
 internal light. At the western end of the room, an ornate marble
 staircase ascends to the first floor. A doorway leads south into a
 large kitchen, and a small closet lies east. The doorway to the north
 leads back to the street.

>go south

 You head south into the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Gleaming pots and pans line the walls of this expansive and rather
 barren kitchen. A well-scrubbed pine table occupies the middle of the
 room. The foyer lies back to the north.

 Embedded in the southern wall of the kitchen is a dumb waiter attached
 to a system of ropes and pulleys. Resting on the dumb waiter is a
 silver tea tray. On the tray, you can see some cold chicken and a
 bottle of ginger beer.

 Although the kitchen is deserted, someone has left a stick of
 margarine sitting on the table here.

>take tray and stick

 Which do you mean, the stick of margarine or the creamy yellow stick
 of butter?

>take tray and margarine

 silver tea tray: Taken.
 stick of margarine: (putting the Gouda into the raspberry satchel to

 Taken.

>examine tray

 A silver tea tray, delicately filigreed with pastoral scenes. The tray
 contains some cold chicken and a bottle of ginger beer.

>examine waiter

 The dumb waiter sits in a square stone shaft embedded in the southern
 wall of the kitchen. It is currently open, but empty.

>close waiter

 As you close the door to the dumb waiter, a bell rings somewhere
 above.

>open waiter

 The bell rings again, this time with a much lower tone, as you open
 the door, revealing the dumb waiter.

 You step from the vast echoing foyer of the Guild Hall into the
 street.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts</span>
 The westernmost outskirts of Vechlee contrast sharply with the
 bustling and thriving town you glimpsed at the east gate. Here at the
 west gate, the foot traffic is nonexistent, and Vechlee seems quiet
 and peaceful, almost eerily so. The street is narrow and cobblestoned,
 and heads west out of the city. The market square is back to the
 northeast and south is the entrance to a large and impressive looking
 building.

>go east

 The market square lies back to the northeast, south is the entrance to
 a large building, and west the road heads out of town.

>go northeast

 You return to the crowded bustle of the market square.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Market Square</span>
 A bustle of people and activity fills this cobblestoned market square.
 The people of Vechlee hurry about their business, intent on their
 daily tasks with barely a glance to spare for a lowly wizard's
 apprentice, otherworldly or not.

 Many different shops and establishments line the edges of the square.
 To the north is a sturdy workmanlike building, falling into disrepair.
 Large letters over the entrance read <span class="floydstyle em">Vechlee Townspeople Building</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Society</span>. To the south is a sprawling commercial edifice, with a
 seemingly endless stream of wizards pushing their way through the
 doors. Gilt-edged lettering over the door reads <span class="floydstyle em">Wizards Guild</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Savings & Loan</span>.

 To the northwest is a small shop, notable more for the lack of
 customers streaming into it than any other distinguishing
 characteristic. Small hand-lettered writing over the doorway reads
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sorcery Supply</span>. Southwest, the cobblestoned road heads out of
 the square and toward the western outskirts of Vechlee. Back to the
 northeast lies the town gate.

 An abandoned market stall sits here, weathered and worn, a yellowed
 piece of paper attached to its side.

>go west

 You can head north into the Vechlee Townspeople Building Society,
 south into the Wizards Guild Savings & Loan or northwest into Sorcery
 Supply.

 The street also heads northeast to the town gate, or southwest to the
 outskirts.

 The buzz of many voices and conversations swells in the crowd around
 you.

>go south

 You push your way through the throng of wizards and into the Wizards
 Guild Savings & Loan. Before you can take another step, a short and
 rather ugly guard grabs you.

 "Oi! Non-wizard banking hours are from eleven until three every second
 Wednesday." He pushes you back out into the street, wagging a finger.

>ask guard about bank

 Try as you might, you can see no guard here.

>ask crowd about bank

 You ask a few of the passersby, and finally a frazzled woman stops and
 tells you, "The building society? Aye, it was a bad business, that.
 They were offering better loan rates than the Wizards Guild Bank for a
 bit, but it seems a lot of wizards signed up for loans and then
 defaulted on payment all at once." She shakes her head. "Then the
 Wizards Guild Bank bought them up, and closed shop. Now if you want to
 bank, it has to be there." She suddenly seems to notice your
 apprentice robes. "But there's nothing wrong with banking there, of
 course," she adds quickly. She looks around furtively and then
 scurries away.

>examine wood

 A short red tube. Small printing on the side reads <span class="floydstyle em">All-Purpose</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Wood Hastener</span>. The tube seems to contain a reddish paste.

>go north

 You push through the throngs of people in the square and into the
 empty silence of the Vechlee Townspeople Building Society.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vechlee Townspeople Building Society</span>
 It seems this building society's fortunes have fallen rather sharply
 of late. Every scrap of furniture, all the dividing walls, counters
 and so on one would expect to see in a bank have all been ripped up,
 leaving a hollow empty shell. A forlorn sign on the wall tells
 customers about the competitive loan rates and exciting investment
 opportunities.

 Southwest, the avenue continues and widens out into a large square.
 North, the road heads into the more professional quarter of North
 Vechlee. To the northeast is the town gate, leading back to the dusty
 road to Ninario's caer.

 A small shop lies to the south, a wooden sign wedged into the
 cobblestones in front of it.

>go north

 You push your way up the street into North Vechlee, the crowd
 lessening as you leave the gate area.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Vechlee</span>
 The sprawling professional district of North Vechlee is home to many
 artists, craftspeople, tradesfolk and their families. Their shops and

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wizardry Wooding</span>
 Stark plain utilitarianism seems to be the order of the day in this
 shop. The room is large and bare, save for a counter on the east side,
 just in front of a curtained doorway. The street lies out the doorway
 to the west.

 The shopkeeper's eyes flick up to the helmet and her eyebrows rise
 slightly. "Expecting some danger are you, luv?"

>ask shopkeeper about hickory

 The shopkeeper sighs and pulls herself off the counter. "Now, now,
 luv, you really must listen this time. It fair tires me out repeating
 this list."

 She takes a deep breath.

 "We've got alder, ash, aspen, balsa, bamboo, basswood, birch,
 butternut, cedar, dark cedar, white cedar, red cedar, cherry,
 chestnut, cottonwood, cypress, ebony, elm, soft elm, rock elm, fir,
 hawthorn, hemlock, hickory, holly..." She trails off.

 "Half a mo, and let me catch my breath, luv." She pauses and fills her
 lungs again.

 "We've also got larch, maple, hard maple, soft maple, mahogany, red
 mahogany, black mahogany, myrtle, pecan, persimmon, pine, red pine,
 white pine, dried pine, knotty pine, dried knotty pine, spruce,
 redwood, rosewood, rowan, sycamore, teak, willow and black willow."

 "Now then luv," smiles the shopkeeper. "Which would you like?"

 The shopkeeper picks up a piece of paper from the countertop and
 sighs.

 "Of course, luv," says the shopkeeper. She springs into action and
 notes down your order meticulously. "Now let me just check..." She
 vanishes into the back room for a few seconds, where you hear her
 rummaging about. She soon returns.

 "We don't have any in stock at the moment, but I've put you down on
 the list," she says, her blue-tinged hair bobbing as she nods her
 head.

 "Although," she adds, frowning, "as you're not a wizard, I'm afraid
 you go near the bottom of the list, just above our regular non-wizard
 customers, luv. Still, it doesn't take long; your wood should be here
 in about four weeks."

 "Wood hastener!" says the shopkeeper. "Very nice, luv. Just the thing
 for speeding up the growth of young trees or making green lumber
 expand ever so slightly. We usually have a few tubes available, but

 You duck under the rug. The smell and heat are oppressive, but it's
 possible to peer through the mouth to see your way around.

 You step into the antiseptic cleanliness of Wizardry Wooding.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wizardry Wooding</span>
 Stark plain utilitarianism seems to be the order of the day in this

 "Hello there, luv!" calls the shopkeeper cheerfully as you step into

 You roar loudly, attempting to attract some attention.

 "Oh dear," says the shopkeeper peering nervously over her shoulder.
 "We don't want to disturb mum, luv,"

 "Hmmm..." mutters the shopkeeper stopping suddenly to make a note on a
 piece of paper.

>remove rug

 The stench of the rug wins in the end, and you duck back out from
 under it. Phew!

 The shopkeeper gazes at you for a long while, then nods. "Well, luv,
 if I had any doubts that you really were a wizard's apprentice,
 they're gone now. You're certainly odd enough to fit the bill."

>ask shopkeeper about ninny

 "I haven't seen him in quite a while, the poor dear," frowns the
 shopkeeper. "Of course, he's in a bit of a legal squabble with the
 guild, so I'm sure he's busy."

 "Ooh, I wouldn't worry about that at all if I were you, luv," smiles

 The shopkeeper fluffs her blue-tinged hair with one hand.

>go northwest

 You step out of the bustle of the market square and into the dimly lit
 quiet of Sorcery Supply.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sorcery Supply</span>
 Eerie ghostly light flows dimly into this shop from unseen sources,
 bathing everything in an almost mystical glow. The smell of incense
 and various magical chemicals and powders lend the shop a heady aroma
 that makes your head spin. The room is steeped in a palpable air of
 magic. Southeast is the doorway back to the market square, whose
 bright sunshine and loud noises seem a distant memory.

 The old crone looks at the helmet and rubs her hands together. "Oh-ho!
 Dangerous times indeed," she cackles.

 A glass trophy case filled with expensive merchandise catches your
 eye.

 Sitting prominently displayed on a wooden stand is a silver bowl.

>buy silver bowl

 "Ah, the discerning eye of the student picks out the best bargain,"
 says the old crone "5 plotkins will suffice to purchase the bowl of
 scrying." She takes the 10 plotkin piece in her hand, snaps her
 fingers strangely, and hands it back to you. You notice that it is now
 silver instead of gold.

 She waves her hand toward the silver bowl. "It's yours," she tells
 you. "Use it well."

 You lift the silver bowl from the stand.

>examine cheese

 Which do you mean, the Roquefort, the Cheshire, the Miranda, the
 Stilton, the Emmental, the Gouda, the Camembert, the Wensleydale, the
 Caerphilly, the Bel Paese or the Asiago?

>put roquefort in silver bowl

 You drop the Roquefort into the silver bowl. For a moment, nothing
 happens. Then, astoundingly, the cheese begins to break down, as it
 reverses the coagulating process and turns into a lumpy mess of raw
 curds. The bowl hums as it slowly consumes the raw curds to fuel its
 visionary powers. The bowl begins to glow with an otherworldly light
 and you gaze into its glowing silvery depths.

 Slowly, a scene forms in the depths of the bowl. You bend closer and
 suddenly feel yourself being pulled into the bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower</span>
 Soaring high over the city below, the tower has a low parapet running
 all the way around it. Far below, you can see the bustle of people
 moving through the market square, a small undulating wave of humanity.
 The sunshine seems even stronger here, and the sky is a brilliant
 blue. A square opening in the middle of the rough stone floor leads
 back down into the tower.

 From somewhere within the building, you hear a bell ringing loudly,
 and the tramping of feet marching in step.

 Ninario is here, glancing around nervously.

 "This might be the perfect place to launch that carpet from," muses
 Ninario.

 You get on the threadbare red carpet. The edges flutter weakly and
 then the carpet seems to give up.

 "It doesn't seem to work," says Ninario. "That's not good. Mm-yes. No.
 Perhaps you shouldn't have taken that ride down the mountainside that
 you mentioned."

 Suddenly, abruptly, the vision fades, and you are back where you
 started.

 The last of the Roquefort vanishes from the bowl with a curious
 sucking sound and the bowl goes dim.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine rug

 The black bearskin rug is old, mouldy and foul-smelling.

>put stilton in silver bowl

 something else.

>take it

 You drop the Stilton into the silver bowl. As the cheese breaks down,
 the bowl begins to glow with an otherworldly light and you gaze into
 its glowing silvery depths.

 Slowly, a scene forms in the depths of the bowl. You bend closer and
 suddenly feel yourself being pulled into the bowl.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eliza's Cheese Emporium</span>
 Emptiness and silence greet you in this small and ordinary cheese
 shop. The shop is devoid of both staff and customers. It looks like it
 would have been a nice cozy little shop though, friendly and
 family-run, the kind of place where the staff remember your favourite
 cheeses, but can also sense when you're looking for something a little
 more adventurous, a little venture beyond your usual territory. The
 air is still scented with the aroma of many different cheeses mingled
 together. The open door to the north leads back to the street.

 Eliza hums to herself as she puts the finishing touches on a wheel of
 Camembert.

 Suddenly, the door bursts open and soldiers wearing the golden wand
 insignia of the Wizards Guild charge into the shop. The lead one steps
 forward.

 "Eliza Stilton, I hereby apprehend you on the charge of using
 scientific methods of preservation in the production of your cheeses.
 As decreed by the Wizards Guild, such practices are duly deemed a
 seditious and destabilising influence on the world of magic. Now, come
 along with us to the Guild Hall for processing, if you please."

 "No, you can't!" protests Eliza futilely. "All I did was keep the
 cheese in a cool room so it lasted longer, you can't arrest me for
 that, you can't!"

 Ignoring the cheesewright's pleas, the soldiers grab her and frogmarch
 her out the door, leaving the shop empty and abandoned.

 From outside the shop, comes the sound of hammering as a sign is
 wedged into the cobblestones.

 Suddenly, abruptly, the vision fades, and you are back where you
 started.

 The last of the Stilton vanishes from the bowl with a curious sucking
 sound and the bowl goes dim.

>put emmenthal in silver bowl

 Try as you might, you can see no emmenthal here.

>take emmental

 Taken.

>put it in silver bowl

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large open portcullis directly across the
 courtyard. Beyond the portcullis is a short passageway, followed by a
 set of iron-banded wooden doors. They have been blasted apart, and
 hang limply from their hinges. To the east is the passage back into
 the tower.

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>go east

 You head down the stone passageway back into the gloom of the tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go northeast

 You step through the doorway, into the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 A few rusted pots and pans line this rather spartan kitchen area. A
 fireplace sits in the northern wall, but no fire has been laid there.
 A well-scrubbed oak table occupies the middle of the room. Southwest
 is the doorway back to the main hall.

>examine fireplace

 Worn, grey stone masonry surrounds this ancient-looking fireplace. The
 fireplace is free of ashes, and bears no signs of being used recently,
 so the stains of smoke on the grey brick must have been there for some
 time.

>light fireplace

 As you contemplate setting fire to the fireplace, you realise Ninario
 showed extreme foresight in providing you neither matches nor torches.

>examine kettle

 Try as you might, you can see no kettle here.

>xlkjas

 Using that verb will not appreciably help.

>examine lksj

 Try as you might, you can see no lksj here.

>go southwest

 You step back into the main hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go south

 You step through the doorway into the laboratory.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Laboratory</span>
 The southern half of the tower is completely taken up by this large
 laboratory. From the profusion of chemicals and powders strewn about,
 you conclude that this room sees much use. It seems that Ninario is
 more than simply a wizard; he is engaged in scientific endeavour as
 well. Black streaks of soot on the walls bear mute evidence to the
 violent failure (or perhaps success) of past experiments. What little
 sunlight there is filters in through the numerous small windows lining
 the walls. The open door to the north leads back to the main hall.

 A scarred and stained table rests against the southern wall.

 Sitting above the table is an empty shelf.

>go north

 You step through the doorway into the main hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go northwest

 You step through the doorway into the workshop.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Workshop</span>
 Odd devices and machines fill this room. Half-finished projects lie
 abandoned in the middle of the floor, and various completed ones are
 pushed up against the walls. A window on the northern wall admits some
 light into the room. The main hall lies through the open doorway to
 the southeast.

 One of the machines catches your eye. It is a cylindrical drum device,
 with a lever on one side.

 A stone blast furnace of the sort used for smelting iron sits here,
 gaping open.

>examine furnace

 A small blast furnace, with a heavy stone door. It is cold to the
 touch.

>turn on furnace

 That's not something you can switch.

>light furnace

 You don't have any way of lighting the blast furnace. You also don't
 need to cast any iron, so don't worry about it.

>se

 You step through the doorway into the main hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go up

 You ascend gingerly to the first floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>examine railing

 The rickety wrought-iron staircase leads down to the ground floor, and
 up to the top of the tower. Its brass railing has been worn smooth by
 the passage of countless hands along its surface; it could do with
 some serious reinforcement work, but it looks serviceable.

>break it

 Aside from the emotional scarring, the winding spiral staircase
 remains undamaged by your brutal and senseless attack.

>go north

 You head north up the hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hallway</span>
 A small narrow window on the northern wall admits bright warm sunlight
 into this end of the hall. A bedroom lies through the open door to the
 west. East is an open solid stone door. The stairs are to the south.

>go west

 You step through the doorway into the bedroom.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bedroom</span>
 Thick carpeting covers the floor of Ninario's extravagantly decorated
 bedroom. Spacious windows in the north and west walls admit generous
 amounts of light. The door back to the hallway lies to the east.

 A large chest full of linen sits open against the south wall.

 A large, old-fashioned canopied four-poster bed also lies here,
 complete with frilly lace pillows, spotless white silk sheets, and a
 tastefully elegant lace skirting, reaching from the mattress all the
 way down to the floor.

 There are hundreds of tiny feathers strewn all over the floor.

>examine linen

 It's just more frilly white linen.

>look under bed

 You find no vast store of hidden wealth in convenient thousand pound
 notes, no dismembered corpse and no ages-old undiscovered secret.
 Sigh.

>go east

 You step through the doorway into the north hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hallway</span>
 A small narrow window on the northern wall admits bright warm sunlight

 west. East is an open solid stone door. The stairs are to the south.

>go east

 You step through the doorway into the garderobe.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garderobe</span>
 The peak of ancient plumbing technology, the garderobe is a fairly
 simple affair: a short stone bench jutting out from the wall with the
 usual-sized hole roughly in the middle of it, and a rack for reading
 material attached to the wall. The only odd thing is the lack of any
 toilet paper. Perhaps it's all accomplished magically. A small narrow
 window on the northern wall admits some light into this room.

>go west

 You step through the doorway into the north hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Hallway</span>

>go south

 You head south down the hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>
 Daylight seeps almost apologetically into the passage through the
 narrow window in the south wall. A set of open double doors lead west
 to the library and a smaller oaken door lies open to the east. The dim
 sunlight reveals a set of stairs to the north.

>go west

 You step through the doorway into the library.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library</span>
 Large and rectangular, the library has solid walls of grey stone.
 Overpopulated bookshelves line the northern wall. A huge set of open
 double doors lie on the east wall. Opposite the doors are six windows,
 stretching from floor to ceiling. By the sunlight streaming in through
 these, you can see the floor is made of beautifully polished hardwood.

>examine books

 Various books with strange-sounding titles. Judging by the level of
 dust on all the books, you expect Ninario keeps them in here because
 he never reads them.

>search books

 You caused enough damage last time that you don't want to risk
 touching another.

>go east

 You step through the doorway into the south hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>

>go east

 You step through the doorway into the study.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Study</span>
 More orderly than the library to the west, but still rather cluttered,
 this room looks like it is used on a regular basis. Although it lacks
 the appointment of a proper bed, the settee in the corner, loaded with
 pillows, tells you Ninario sleeps in here more often than not. A desk
 sits in the corner, loaded with papers, half-written spell scrolls,
 and various mouldy old books. A long, glowing strip of parchment hangs
 from the northern wall. Large glass windows on the southern and
 eastern walls admit bright shining sunlight into the room. West, the
 open door leads back to the hallway.

>examine carpet

 Try as you might, you can see no carpet here.

>go west

 You step through the doorway into the south hallway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Hallway</span>

 You head north up the hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go up

 You ascend the winding stairs into the warm sunshine on top of the
 tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tower</span>
 Sun beats down from high overhead, warming the flagstones of the
 tower. A commanding and breathtaking view of the fields and pastures
 surrounding the caer greets you in every direction. In addition, there
 is a good view of the courtyard below, with its beautiful alabaster
 fountain. You also see the portcullis and catch a glimpse of the
 double wooden doors beyond it. The stairs in the centre of the tower
 lead back down to the first floor.

 A cannon sits here, aimed at the huge wooden doors.

>go north

 If you do that, you'll tumble over the edge.

>look north

 Looking north from here, you can just make out a small farmstead
 buried amidst the rolling fields and pastures.

>examine farmstead

 Try as you might, you can see no farmstead here.

>look east

 Pastures and fields extend away to the east as far as the eye can see.

>look south

 Pastures and fields extend away to the south as far as the eye can
 see.

>look west

 Looking west, you can see a dry dusty road just outside the caer,
 running northeast and southwest.

>go down

 You clatter down to the first floor, the rickety stairs shaking and
 groaning in protest.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stairwell</span>
 There are no windows here near the stairwell of this squat and
 serviceable tower, but dim dusty sunlight filters down from above and
 from the ends of the hallway. A wrought-iron spiral staircase ascends
 and descends here, its brass railing polished smooth by the passage of
 many hands. The corridor also extends north and south.

>go down

 You descend the stairs to the ground floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go west

 You head down the stone passageway and emerge into the bright sunshine
 of the courtyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large open portcullis directly across the
 courtyard. Beyond the portcullis is a short passageway, followed by a
 set of iron-banded wooden doors. They have been blasted apart, and
 hang limply from their hinges. To the east is the passage back into
 the tower.

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>go northeast

 You follow the path northeast around the corner of the tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North of Tower</span>
 The northern part of the courtyard is a wide and open space, with
 hard-packed dirt underfoot. To the north, the wall of the caer runs
 east and west. The main courtyard can be reached by heading southwest
 along the stone path, while to the southeast, the path continues
 around the base of the tower, to where the courtyard opens out into a
 wide plot of earth.

>examine wall

 The caer wall runs around the entire perimeter of the courtyard.

>climb wall

 It's far too tall to climb.

>go north

 From here, you can follow the stone path southeast or southwest around
 the tower.

>se

 You follow the path southeast to the garden plot.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden Plot</span>
 A large plot of earth has been cleared here, as though there was a
 garden at one time, but it is now barren and lifeless. To the east is
 the wall of the caer running north and south. Paths head northwest and
 southwest around the base of the tower.

>dig plot

 You dig away merrily in the dirt, enjoying yourself immensely. You
 don't, however, uncover anything interesting. You stand back up,
 dusting the earth off your hands.

>go southwest

 You follow the path southwest around the base of the tower.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South of Tower</span>
 The path around the tower branches here, with a small pebbled walk
 heading south to the door of a small wooden shed. Beyond the shed the
 wall of the caer runs east and west. The stone path heads northwest to
 the courtyard, and northeast to where it opens out into a wide plot of
 earth.

>go south

 You step into the shed.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside the Shed</span>
 A small shed once used to store gardening implements. It is now mostly
 empty, with only a few broken remnants of garden tools remaining. A
 large trap door gapes open here, revealing worn stone steps leading
 downward. Daylight streams through the open door to the north.

>examine tools

 The broken tools sit here, neglected and rusted.

>go down

 You descend the worn stone steps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Slimy Passage</span>
 This narrow passage under the shed is dark, slimy and unpleasant. The
 passage continues north, and worn stone steps end at the open trap
 door above.

>go north

 You scuttle along the narrow slimy passage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Slimy Ledge</span>
 The passage from the south ends here at a small slimy ledge that juts
 out over an open room below. The room down there appears to have been
 put into use as a rubbish tip for all of Ninario's cast-off
 spellcasting implements, bits of machinery and general odds and ends.
 The huge heap of rubbish takes up most of the floor space. North of
 the heap, a tunnel leads out of the room. Mouldy remnants of wood
 suggest steps might once have led up to this ledge but they have long
 since rotted away. It looks possible to clamber down into the room,
 but climbing back up would be another story.

>go down

 You slip and slide dangerously down to the floor of the room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rubbish Heap</span>
 This small room has been put into use as a rubbish tip for all of
 Ninario's cast-off spellcasting implements, bits of machinery and
 general odds and ends. About the only place to stand is here in the
 doorway heading back north, as the huge heap of rubbish takes up most
 of the floor space. At the south end of this room are the dim
 beginnings of a passage heading upwards, but whatever set of stairs or
 ladder led up there has long since rotted away.

>search heap

 You search the heap of rubbish again, but don't find anything.

>go north

 You head along the slimy passage to the basement.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement</span>
 The slow drip of water echoes through this dark and damp room. The
 walls and floor are wet with moisture, and the air seems stuffy and
 unclean. A doorway opens to the north, and a most unwholesome odour
 emanates from that direction. The spiral staircase climbs back up to
 the main hall here, and a narrow slimy passage heads south.

>go north

 Braving the foul odour, you step through the doorway.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sewer</span>
 Dank and dark, this is one of the less memorable attractions you've
 visited. You're not certain how often Ninario has this room cleaned,
 but the stench is horrendous. The basement lies back through the
 doorway to the south.

 A vat looms here, six feet high, and constructed of stone, with a
 metal ladder leading up to the rim.  There is a large stone channel
 connected to the bottom of the vat, where waste is supposed to exit
 the vat. The channel leads along the floor to the wall, where you can
 see the lip of a small outflow pipe.

>go north

 The way out is south back to the basement stairs.

>look in vat

 This stinking vat is empty of filth.

>pipe

 Using that verb will not appreciably help.

>examine pipe

 The sewer outflow pipe is operating normally.

>clobberation

 Using that verb will not appreciably help.

>go south

 You step back into the relatively cleaner air of the basement.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement</span>
 The slow drip of water echoes through this dark and damp room. The
 walls and floor are wet with moisture, and the air seems stuffy and
 unclean. A doorway opens to the north, and a most unwholesome odour
 emanates from that direction. The spiral staircase climbs back up to
 the main hall here, and a narrow slimy passage heads south.

>go up

 You trudge back up the rickety stairs into the brightness of the main
 hall.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Hall</span>
 Sunlight streams into the main hall of the tower from the large
 passage west out to the courtyard. An open doorway leads into the
 kitchen to the northeast. A polished steel door leads south, and a
 rusty metal door stands open to the northwest. The spiral staircase
 ascends to the first floor, and also descends down into inky darkness.

>go west

 You head down the stone passageway and emerge into the bright sunshine
 of the courtyard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 The whole interior of the caer is given over to a simple, large
 courtyard, enclosed by a tall wall of stone on all four sides. To the
 west, a large bailey passage tunnels through the thick wall of the
 caer to the outside world. On either side of the bailey, stairs ascend
 to the top of the outer wall. A flagstone path curves northeast and
 southeast around the base of the tower, and also extends west from the
 tower doorway to the large open portcullis directly across the
 courtyard. Beyond the portcullis is a short passageway, followed by a
 set of iron-banded wooden doors. They have been blasted apart, and
 hang limply from their hinges. To the east is the passage back into
 the tower.

 A large white fountain, shimmering with cascading water, sits
 majestically in the middle of the courtyard.

>look in fountain

 The fountain is full of clear glittering water that continuously
 cascades from the top down into the base.

>swim

 There's only about a foot of water in the fountain. If there's not
 enough room to demonstrate your medal-worthy butterfly stroke, forget
 it.

>go north

 From here, you can follow the path northeast or southeast around the
 tower, head west to the portcullis, climb up to the top of the wall,
 or head east back into the tower.

>go up

 You clamber up the stairs beside the bailey.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Atop the West Wall</span>
 The landscape of this strange place stretches out from the caer west
 to the horizon. Cultivated fields are spread out below, a
 multicoloured cloak draped over the shoulders of the land. A dry
 ribbon of road runs past the caer heading northeast and southwest
 through the fields. Villages, visible as small clusters of buildings,
 dot the farmlands. The fields continue flat and level for quite some
 distance, gradually leading into more hilly country. Beyond the hills,
 far in the distance, the many spires and towers of a city or large
 fortress rise up to touch the sky.

 The caer wall stretches away to the north and south. The wall is very
 wide here, encompassing the entire width of the bailey below. A small
 stone building perches on the wall to the west. The courtyard is back
 down the stairs to the east.

>go south

 Rather than walking around the perimeter of the entire wall to end up
 right back here, you opt to save everyone's time and just stay put.

>go west

 You step inside the gatehouse.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gatehouse</span>
 The area above the bailey is a small, square stone room, bare and
 featureless but for the holes riddling the floor, used for pouring
 boiling oil or water over invaders in the bailey below. A doorway east
 leads back out to the top of the wall.

 A short length of rubber hose lies here.

 A scarred and rusted machine fills the western wall of the room.

>take hose

 Taken.

>examine hose

 A short length of black rubber hose.

>go east

 You step out of the gatehouse and back onto the wall.

>go west

 You head west along the path, passing under the raised portcullis and
 into the bailey.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bailey</span>
 This short stone passageway leads from the portcullis to the east to
 the large double doors out of the caer to the west. Looking up, you
 can see several holes bored through the stone ceiling, presumably for
 dropping boiling oil or water down on the heads of invaders. West, the
 huge iron-banded double doors have been blasted apart, and hang limply
 from their hinges.

>go north

 You can only go west towards the doors or east back to the courtyard.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusty Road</span>
 The dusty road is a dry brown ribbon of earth running northeast and
 southwest. The sun shines down from high overhead, the warm baking
 heat of high summer. A meandering country fence runs along the edge of
 the road to the northwest. East, the huge wooden doors into the caer
 hang dispiritedly from their hinges, twisted hunks of wood and iron.

 A large cast iron cannonball sits here, looking extremely heavy.

>go northeast

 You walk northeast along the road, your feet kicking up a small cloud
 of dust. The road is long and twisting but eventually ends at a farm
 gate.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Gate</span>
 The dusty road ends here at a farm gate to the north. Beyond it, a
 large open farmyard encloses a ramshackle old barn and a large pile of
 rubble, but no farmhouse.

 Broad pastures lie to either side of the road, bordered by small
 wooden fences. A small little-used lane heads east, barely more than a
 line of dirt in the grass. Southwest, the road leads back to the caer.

 A large wooden sign sits in front of the gate.

 You inch slowly along the springy branch. It bobs and sways alarmingly
 under your weight. You edge forward cautiously, but by the time you
 reach the halfway point, your weight becomes too much for the springy
 branch. The tree is just too young and springy. It bends, bowing down
 low to the ground. You scrabble to maintain your footing, but slip and
 tumble to the dirt path.

 You spread some of the wood hastener on the firm strong branch. There
 is a grinding crackling noise from the tree and it suddenly bursts
 forth in a tremendous growth spurt as its growth is hastened.

 There is a tremendous flapping of surprise from the hawk, following by
 a squawk of pleasure as it settles back down in its drastically

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>go north

 You step out onto the branch, inching your way forward. You are about
 halfway to the fence when there is a creaking, shuddering noise. The
 sudden burst of growth must have been too much for the branch, as it
 abruptly snaps under you. You tumble gracelessly out of the tree, and
 land heavily on the dirt path.

 tree. The hawk attacks again, and in the fury of its assault, you
 tumble out of the tree to the ground below.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of the Lane</span>
 The narrow lane peters to an end here, the small strip of dirt fading
 into grass. Barren fields lie south and east. North, a tall fence
 borders the lane.

 A bushy elm tree stands on the south side of the path. A couple of low
 branches beckon tantalisingly.

 A small savage-looking hawk rests in the upper branches of the tree.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Gate</span>
 The dusty road ends here at a farm gate to the north. Beyond it, a
 large open farmyard encloses a ramshackle old barn and a large pile of
 rubble, but no farmhouse.

 Broad pastures lie to either side of the road, bordered by small
 wooden fences. A small little-used lane heads east, barely more than a
 line of dirt in the grass. Southwest, the road leads back to the caer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusty Road</span>
 The dusty road is a dry brown ribbon of earth running northeast and
 southwest. The sun shines down from high overhead, the warm baking
 heat of high summer. A meandering country fence runs along the edge of
 the road to the northwest. East, the huge wooden doors into the caer
 hang dispiritedly from their hinges, twisted hunks of wood and iron.

 A large cast iron cannonball sits here, looking extremely heavy.

 You step over the fence and wander around the field for a short while,

 southwest. After a lengthy walk, you arrive at the Vechlee town gate
 and step through into the bustle of the town.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vechlee Gate</span>
 Vechlee seems a bustling and thriving town. The foot traffic is
 impressive here just inside the town gate. The street is not terribly
 wide, but does boast the impressive upgrade of cobblestones.
 Southwest, the avenue continues and widens out into a large square.
 North, the road heads into the more professional quarter of North
 Vechlee. To the northeast is the town gate, leading back to the dusty
 road to Ninario's caer.

 A small shop lies to the south, a wooden sign wedged into the
 cobblestones in front of it.

>go southwest

 You push southwest through the crowd to the market square.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Market Square</span>
 A bustle of people and activity fills this cobblestoned market square.
 The people of Vechlee hurry about their business, intent on their
 daily tasks with barely a glance to spare for a lowly wizard's
 apprentice, otherworldly or not.

 Many different shops and establishments line the edges of the square.
 To the north is a sturdy workmanlike building, falling into disrepair.
 Large letters over the entrance read <span class="floydstyle em">Vechlee Townspeople Building</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Society</span>. To the south is a sprawling commercial edifice, with a
 seemingly endless stream of wizards pushing their way through the
 doors. Gilt-edged lettering over the door reads <span class="floydstyle em">Wizards Guild</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Savings & Loan</span>.

 To the northwest is a small shop, notable more for the lack of
 customers streaming into it than any other distinguishing
 characteristic. Small hand-lettered writing over the doorway reads
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sorcery Supply</span>. Southwest, the cobblestoned road heads out of
 the square and toward the western outskirts of Vechlee. Back to the
 northeast lies the town gate.

 An abandoned market stall sits here, weathered and worn, a yellowed
 piece of paper attached to its side.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">North Vechlee</span>
 The sprawling professional district of North Vechlee is home to many
 artists, craftspeople, tradesfolk and their families. Their shops and
 houses fill the small cluttered streets.

 An oddly silent shop lies to the west. It seems to have fallen upon
 hard economic times and is utterly abandoned, lacking even the dignity
 of boards over the windows. A sign over the door reads <span class="floydstyle em">William's</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Woodcraft</span>.

 On the east side of the street is a prosperous and thriving business.
 Gold lettering over the entranceway reads <span class="floydstyle em">Wizardry Wooding</span>.

 The street leads back south to the town gate.

 A notice is attached to the door of the abandoned shop.

>go east

 You step into the antiseptic cleanliness of Wizardry Wooding.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wizardry Wooding</span>
 Stark plain utilitarianism seems to be the order of the day in this
 shop. The room is large and bare, save for a counter on the east side,
 just in front of a curtained doorway. The street lies out the doorway
 to the west.

 "Hello there, luv!" calls Betty cheerfully as you step into the shop.

>sell branch

 Betty glances at the firm strong branch and frowns. "I'm sure it's as
 nice as you say, luv, but I don't really need a firm strong branch at
 the moment."

 classes that seem to last forever. But this one takes the biscuit. You
 wonder what possessed you to sign up for <span class="floydstyle em">Celtic Elements in Early</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Teutonic Settlements</span>: a field of study so narrow and boring,

 You glance down at the notebook in your hands, but the thought of

 you look around the hall, wondering if you could sneak out and find

 A bushy elm tree stands on the south side of the path. A couple of low
 branches beckon tantalisingly.

>go west


 You head west back to the farm gate.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Gate</span>
 The dusty road ends here at a farm gate to the north. Beyond it, a
 large open farmyard encloses a ramshackle old barn and a large pile of
 rubble, but no farmhouse.

 Broad pastures lie to either side of the road, bordered by small
 wooden fences. A small little-used lane heads east, barely more than a
 line of dirt in the grass. Southwest, the road leads back to the caer.

 A large wooden sign sits in front of the gate.

>go southwest


 You head southwest back along the dusty road.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dusty Road</span>
 The dusty road is a dry brown ribbon of earth running northeast and
 southwest. The sun shines down from high overhead, the warm baking
 heat of high summer. A meandering country fence runs along the edge of
 the road to the northwest. East, the huge wooden doors into the caer
 hang dispiritedly from their hinges, twisted hunks of wood and iron.

 A large cast iron cannonball sits here, looking extremely heavy.

>put all in satchel


 pair of black goggles: Done.
 tube of wood hastener: Done.
 black rubber hose: You curl up the hose and place it in the raspberry
 satchel.
 silver bowl: Done.
 small silver coin: Done.

>take cannonball


 You heft the cannonball. It weighs a good five or six stone! You won't
 be able to carry it very far.

 The cannonball is getting heavier by the second.

>put cannonball in satchel


 You manage to hold the satchel open wide enough that you can squeeze
 the cannonball in. Amazingly, the satchel does not seem to get any
 bulkier or heavier.

>go northeast


 You walk northeast along the road, your feet kicking up a small cloud
 of dust. The road is long and twisting but eventually ends at a farm
 gate.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Gate</span>
 The dusty road ends here at a farm gate to the north. Beyond it, a
 large open farmyard encloses a ramshackle old barn and a large pile of

 wooden fences. A small little-used lane heads east, barely more than a

 A large wooden sign sits in front of the gate.

>go east


 You walk east down the narrow lane.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of the Lane</span>
 The narrow lane peters to an end here, the small strip of dirt fading
 into grass. Barren fields lie south and east. North, a tall fence
 borders the lane.

 A bushy elm tree stands on the south side of the path. A couple of low
 branches beckon tantalisingly.

>wear helmet


 You're already wearing that!

>wear rug


 (first taking the bearskin rug)
 You duck under the rug. The smell and heat are oppressive, but it's
 possible to peer through the mouth to see your way around.

>wear satchel

>go up


 You scramble up into the tree.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the Tree</span>
 This large bushy elm tree is strong and supports your weight well.
 Above you, the large trunk offers a path into the higher reaches of
 the tree.

 A firm strong branch extends north out over the fence.

>go up


 You head gingerly up into the very topmost reaches of the tree.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Very Top of the Tree</span>
 You cling precariously to the very top of the tree. The branches here
 are extremely flimsy and unstable. The tree waves back and forth
 gently, dipping briefly towards the fence and then swinging back.

 The tree dips and sways alarmingly. You're probably just about the
 maximum weight these flimsy branches can take and still remain
 standing.

>take cannonball


 You heft the cannonball. It weighs a good five or six stone! You won't
 be able to carry it very far.

 The weight of the cannonball in your hands sets the branches to
 dipping and swaying madly. The gyrations increase and the top of the
 tree bends down, down towards the fence, gathering speed as it does
 so. It reaches the bottom moving at an alarming clip. But the tree is
 just a bit too short, and your head connects soundly with the top of
 the fence. Fortunately, the helmet protects you, and you rebound off
 and over the fence, landing heavily in the yard.

 The heavy cannonball thumps to the ground beside you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garden</span>
 The well-tilled rich earth and neat orderly furrows show that this was
 the farmhouse garden.  It's early to have harvested all the garden
 vegetables, but someone appears to have done so, as there is not a
 living thing left in the earth. It has been stripped clean.

 West, the garden opens out into a dry and dusty farmyard. A fence
 rings the garden on the other three sides. The slat construction of
 the inside of the fence to the south makes for an easy climb back out
 to the lane.

 A pair of large and ferocious dogs wandering in the garden jump in
 surprise as you come plummeting down at breakneck speed.

 The dogs take one look and sniff at the bearlike apparition that has
 descended into the quiet peace of the garden, and turn tail, yipping
 in terror.

>dig


 What do you want to dig?

>garden


 You dig away merrily in the dirt, enjoying yourself immensely. You
 don't, however, uncover anything interesting. You stand back up,
 dusting the earth off your hands.

>examine garden


 Though stripped clean of all produce, the earth still looks rich and
 well-tilled.

>go west


 You wander into the farmyard.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farmyard</span>
 A large and dusty earthen courtyard, the farmyard seems eerily silent
 and abandoned. A curious pile of rubble to the north seems composed
 mainly of old timbers and plaster. West, a barn gapes open, its doors
 wrenched from their hinges. The farmyard ends at a garden plot of some
 kind to the east. The gate to the south leads back to the road.

>open gate


 You try to open the gate, struggling against an invisible barrier,
 pushing and straining. You feel the edges of the barrier begin to give
 and you push harder. There is a sudden audible pop. The gate flies
 open and you tumble through into the road, the spell of the Wizards
 Guild broken.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Farm Gate</span>

>go north


 You walk into the midst of the pile of rubble.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pile of Rubble</span>
 There's no doubt. This sad pile of rubble is all that remains of the
 farmhouse that once stood here. An awesome force of devastation has
 been levelled against it. Peering amidst the rubble, you spot what may
 very well have been the ultimate cause of the Wizards Guild attack on
 this homestead: the twisted pipes and smashed porcelain of an indoor
 plumbing system. Consorting with the Plumbers Union, and incorporating
 scientific advances into their home were the seditious and
 destabilising dangers lurking in this harmless home: a threat to the
 supremacy of the Wizards Guild, to their grip over the people of this
 world.

 The farmyard lies back to the south.

 A scrap of paper caught in the pile of rubble flutters briefly in the
 wind, catching your eye.

 You step into the ramshackle old barn, glancing apprehensively at the
 sagging timbers above.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Barn</span>
 The dry dusty smell of hay fills this small and lonely barn. Sunlight
 streams in through the doorway, lighting up small motes of straw in
 the air and lending the barn a peculiarly golden quality. The roof and
 wall timbers of the barn sag alarmingly, as though some terrible
 violence has been wreaked on them. The barnyard is back east through
 the doorway.

 A small wooden cabinet hangs on the wall of the barn.

 The cabinet creaks open.

 Sitting on the shelves inside is a glass jar.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outside Vechlee</span>
 The peace and quiet of a summer countryside surround you once again,
 here outside the walls of Vechlee. The cobblestones have vanished and
 the road has reverted to a plain dirt ribbon snaking its way west.
 Hilly mountainous country borders the road to the north and a small
 path wends that way, climbing up into the crags. East are the walls of
 Vechlee, their broad expanse interrupted by both the gate back into
 town as well as the end of a rusty metal pipe that sticks out of the
 wall.

 A small wooden sign sits at the side of the road leading west.

>go north


 The narrow path twists and turns up the side of the mountain. It's not
 too hard of a climb, but it certainly gets the limbs moving and the
 heart pumping. Eventually, the path you are following narrows.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ledge</span>
 The path narrows to a ledge here that curves around the side of the
 mountain. East is a towering wall of rock, west a nasty tumble off the
 cliffside. The narrow path heads south back down the mountain, and to
 the north, the ledge opens up into a wide plateau.

 A black bear blocks the trail north here, pawing at the carcase of
 some unfortunate animal.

>go north


 The black bear peers quizzically at the bearskin rug for a long
 moment. It nudges a bit closer. It snuffles at you and then gives a
 curious grunt of pleasure. It rears up and leaps on you, smothering
 you with love and affection.

 The weight of the bear pushes against you, and you fall, striking your
 head a glancing blow on the cliff. Fortunately, the helmet protects
 you, and you surge back to your feet.

 The bear's amorous advances are in no way chilled by your reaction,
 and it lunges forward at you again.  You are already badly off
 balance, and you trip backwards, your arms windmilling wildly, the
 edge of the cliff getting closer and closer until suddenly...

 You tumble over the edge. In a serious break with your expectations,
 you do not plummet to your death. Through an astonishing series of
 coincidences that have served to place everyone involved in exactly
 the right place at the right time, you land with a thump on the
 trailing rug in a flying carpet convoy.

 After the initial shock subsides, the carpet vendors' surprise turns
 to amazement as you relate the story of your encounter with the bear
 and your plummet off the cliffside.

 In exchange for this tale, which will keep their firesides entertained
 for many nights to come, they are only too glad to set you down on the
 cliff beyond the bear.

 Before they leave, one of them tosses a carpet towards you. "That's
 the best carpet in our entire stock!" he calls. "Use it well, my
 friend!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Plateau</span>
 Tall mountain grass and towering trees line this peaceful plateau far
 up the mountainside. West, the plateau ends in an abrupt drop down the
 mountainside. The trail turns to the east here, running across the
 plateau and then climbing farther up the mountain. South, it descends
 back down to the ledge.

 A black bear blocks the trail south here, pawing at the carcase of
 some unfortunate animal.

 A threadbare red carpet lies across the ground.

 [Your score has just gone up by four points.]

>examine carpet


 An ugly and cheaply made carpet. It is a garish red and looks ready to
 fall apart.

 If it truly is a flying carpet, you're not sure how many trips it's
 good for before disintegrating underneath you.

>take carpet. put it in satchel


 Taken.
 You put the threadbare red carpet into the raspberry satchel.

>go east


 You walk through the quiet peace of the long, level plateau and up the
 winding path to the very top.

 The rug makes movement difficult, but you manage it.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Mountaintop</span>
 Sunlight beats down warmly from high overhead this bald and barren
 mountaintop. It's extremely hot, and the trees and grass have faded
 away, leaving a bare smooth expanse of rock. The wind is stronger
 here, and whips your robe against your legs. West, the mountain trail
 winds back down toward the plateau.

 A small shoddily built lean-to sits here.

 As you approach the lean-to, you spot an old hermit sitting on a rock
 in front of it. "Bah!" he mutters as he sees you. He squints in your
 direction, trying to make you out. "That's one ugly bear!" he mutters.
 "More likely, it's a meddling wizard or, worse yet, an apprentice."

>remove rug


 The stench of the rug wins in the end, and you duck back out from
 under it. Phew!

 "Huh," mutters the hermit. "The bear appears to have turned into a
 wizard's apprentice."

>put rug in satchel


 You roll the bearskin rug up tightly and manage to shove it into the
 raspberry satchel.

>examine hermnit

 The cracked and lined face of the hermit almost makes you start back
 in shock as you gaze at it. This man is old, with darkly tanned and
 weathered skin, and short spindly limbs. You wonder just how long he's
 been sitting up here. His eyes are sunk deep into his flesh, squinting
 so tightly they're almost closed. Tears stream openly from them.

 "Could you repeat that?" asks the hermit. "My ears aren't what they

 pretty different than I remember them." He glances at his body,
 frowning. "To be honest," he admits, "I don't recognise <span class="floydstyle em">most</span>

 "I'm not crying," says the hermit shielding his eyes with his hand.
 "It's that blasted sunlight beating down on me all day every day. It's

 them, but..." He pauses and sighs. "Well, it's a matter of principle
 now. I told them I'd never set foot in town again, said I had all I
 needed up here. Foolish pride!"

>give goggles to hermit


 (first taking the pair of black goggles)
 The hermit snatches the goggles from your hands and claps them to his
 eyes, hands shaking. He slips the strap over his head and gazes around
 the mountaintop. "These are perfect!" he murmurs appreciatively. "Just
 what I needed." He gazes up at you, his eyes now able to open fully.
 "Thanks, youngster. You've done me a favour that I won't soon forget."

 I made it myself to block out the sun, but it ends up being even
 hotter in there than out here. So I sacrifice my eyes for the sake of
 being nice and cool. I use the lean-to of a night, though. It gets
 pretty chilly up here."

>examine lean-to


 The lean-to is constructed of old sticks and branches and covered with
 thinly-stretched animal hides. It certainly doesn't look as though it
 provides a lot of shelter.

>look in it


 You don't have to worry about doing that to the lean-to.

>enter it


 You step into the lean-to, but it's even hotter in there than on the
 mountaintop, so you step back out again.

 "Hey!" calls the hermit. "Stay out of there, that's my home, you
 know."

>hermit, open bottle

 "Well, it's against my principles to consort with society, but one
 good turn deserves another. Give it here."

>give wizstrip to hermit


 (first taking the bottle of WizStrip)
 "Well, I suppose it's only fair. You did me a good turn, so I should
 do you one." He takes the proferred bottle, and gives the neck a quick
 deft twist. "There you are, youngster. One good turn, I believe.
 Perhaps now I can get back to some serious solitude."

 He hands the bottle back to you, and you glance at it. The bottle is
 still safely closed, but the hermit has broken the seal for you.

 The sewer outflow pipe rises up into the wall surrounding Vechlee, and
 looks like it connects to the vast sewer system inside the city. It's
 about a foot in diameter.

>look in pipe


 You find nothing of interest.

>enter pipe


 While the pipe is large enough to enter, it's at enough of a pitch
 that travelling <span class="floydstyle em">up</span> it would be pretty difficult. Perhaps if
 you were at the inflow end where the pipe sloped downward you could
 manage it; as it stands, it's too difficult.

>go east


 You walk back into the outskirts of Vechlee.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Outskirts</span>
 The westernmost outskirts of Vechlee contrast sharply with the
 bustling and thriving town you glimpsed at the east gate. Here at the
 west gate, the foot traffic is nonexistent, and Vechlee seems quiet
 and peaceful, almost eerily so. The street is narrow and cobblestoned,
 and heads west out of the city. The market square is back to the
 northeast and south is the entrance to a large and impressive looking
 building.

>go south


 You step through the arched doorway into the vaulted splendour of the
 guild hall foyer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Hall Foyer</span>
 The opulent splendour of the guild hall foyer is almost overwhelming.
 Huge marble columns rise up to hold the vaulted ceiling in place, and
 the marble walls and floor seem to glow and shimmer with a queer
 internal light. At the western end of the room, an ornate marble
 staircase ascends to the first floor. A doorway leads south into a
 large kitchen, and a small closet lies east. The doorway to the north
 leads back to the street.

>examine coin


 This small coin, about the same size as a ten pence piece, is minted

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Gleaming pots and pans line the walls of this expansive and rather

 Embedded in the southern wall of the kitchen is a dumb waiter attached

>close waiter


 As you close the door to the dumb waiter, a bell rings somewhere
 above.

>go north


 You step back into the foyer.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Guild Hall Foyer</span>
 The opulent splendour of the guild hall foyer is almost overwhelming.
 Huge marble columns rise up to hold the vaulted ceiling in place, and
 the marble walls and floor seem to glow and shimmer with a queer
 internal light. At the western end of the room, an ornate marble
 staircase ascends to the first floor. A doorway leads south into a
 large kitchen, and a small closet lies east. The doorway to the north
 leads back to the street.

 You hear muffled footsteps above, and then the creaking sound of ropes
 and pulleys as the dumb waiter is hauled up by someone on the first
 floor.

 "This will be your dinner now, sir," says a voice.

 "Excellent! you hear a familiar voice say. "Bring it here and let me
 tuck in."

 There is a short pause.

 "What the devil is wrong with this bottle of ginger beer?" bellows the
 voice. "It tastes like paint thinner! Send the whole thing back to the
 kitchen at once!"

 You hear a door being slammed, and then the sound of ropes and pulleys
 operating once more.

>go south


 You head south into the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Gleaming pots and pans line the walls of this expansive and rather
 barren kitchen. A well-scrubbed pine table occupies the middle of the
 room. The foyer lies back to the north.

 Embedded in the southern wall of the kitchen is the small closed door
 to the dumb waiter.

>open waiter


 The bell rings again, this time with a much lower tone, as you open
 the door, revealing the dumb waiter. Sitting on the dumb waiter is a
 silver tea tray. On the tray, you can see a bottle of WizStrip and
 some cold chicken.

>examine wizstrip


 It's another bottle of WizStrip. It looks exactly like those stone
 bottles of ginger beer, but the label on the side reads <span class="floydstyle em">WizStrip</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Paint Stripper, Industrial Strength</span>. Then in smaller letters:
 <span class="floydstyle em">WARNING: Highly reactive. Do not mix with methane</span>.

>remove label


 (first taking the label)
 You painstakingly pick at the label. It comes off in annoyingly
 discrete little chunks, but eventually the bottle is label-free.
 Unfortunately, the label doesn't survive the process.

>close waiter

 above.

 You hear muffled footsteps above, and then the creaking sound of ropes

 floor.

 "This should be your corrected dinner now, sir," says a voice.

 "Well, it's about time! you hear a familiar voice say. "Bring it here
 and let me tuck in."

 There is a short pause.

 "What the devil is wrong with this bottle of ginger beer?" bellows the
 voice. "It tastes like paint thinner! Send the whole thing back to the
 kitchen at once!"

 You hear a door being slammed, and then the sound of ropes and pulleys
 operating once more.

>go east


 You open the door and step into the closet.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Closet</span>
 Small and cramped, this tiny closet is barely large enough to turn
 around in. It is devoid of supplies of any kind, but is obviously used
 for maintenance purposes, rather than storage. The hall is back to the
 west.

 A small copper pipe runs down the southern wall, entering the closet
 from the floor above and descending down to depths unknown.

 Near the bottom of the eastern wall, at floor level, is a rectangular
 grille-covered opening.

>examine pipe


 The copper pipe is about one inch in diameter, and runs down the
 southern wall of the closet, from ceiling to floor. About midway up
 the pipe is a small valve with a nozzle on the end of it.

>turn valve


 You twist the valve open.

 A steady hissing noise comes from the nozzle as gas hisses out of it.

>go west


 You step out of the narrow confinement of the closet and into the
 echoing vastness of the foyer.

 Embedded in the southern wall of the kitchen is the small closed door

 Faintly, you hear a hissing noise coming from somewhere nearby.

 The level of gas buildup in here is beginning to affect you. You feel
 tired and dizzy.

>open waiter


 The bell rings again, this time with a much lower tone, as you open
 the door, revealing the dumb waiter. Sitting on the dumb waiter is a
 silver tea tray. On the tray, you can see a bottle of WizStrip and
 some cold chicken.

 Faintly, you hear a hissing noise coming from somewhere nearby.

 The gas level is really starting to make you feel unwell. You had best
 do something about it quickly.

>close waiter


 As you close the door to the dumb waiter, a bell rings somewhere
 above.

 Faintly, you hear a hissing noise coming from somewhere nearby.

 The methane gas content in the room finally reaches a level high
 enough to have an effect. As the gas is odourless and colourless, you
 don't notice anything odd, other than a vague sleepy sensation. You
 slump down to the floor, promising yourself a quick nap; regrettably,
 you never awaken.

 The dumb waiter sits in a square stone shaft embedded in the southern
 wall of the kitchen. It is currently open, and looking inside, you
 spot a silver tea tray sitting on it. On the tray, you can see a
 bottle of WizStrip and some cold chicken.

>cover grille with rug


 The rectangular shaped opening is covered with a metal grille. Beyond
 the grille, you can see a duct extending upwards. It's probably an air
 intake vent.



 You need to be holding the bearskin rug before you can put it on top
 of something else.

 Putting things on the air intake vent would achieve nothing.

 You are carrying a bottle of ginger beer, a scrap of paper, a rusty
 helmet (perched on your head), a raspberry satchel (being worn and
 open), inside which are a bearskin rug, on top of which is a
 malodorous coating of arktos essence, a threadbare red carpet, a
 cannonball, a magnesium flare (providing light), some Cheshire, a
 stick of margarine, a 5 plotkin piece, a silver bowl, a black rubber
 hose, a tube of wood hastener, some Miranda, some Gouda, some
 Camembert, some Wensleydale, some Caerphilly, some Bel Paese, some
 Asiago, an empty watering can, a flask, an old iron key, a chamberpot
 containing 3 pints of water, a silk purse (which is open but empty),
 an exercise book, a stick of butter, a ceramic bowl, inside which is
 some crystalline ammonium sulphate, an earthenware dish, inside which
 are some copper sulphate crystals, a copy of Wizarding Weekly, a
 frilly lace pillow and a small steel key and your clothes (being
 worn).

>take pillow



>cover face with pillow


 Try as you might, you can see no face here.

>take beer. open it


 You already have that.
 You prise the lid from the stone bottle, revealing brown ginger beer.

>open wizstrip


 You prise the lid from the stone bottle, revealing yellowish oily
 paint stripper.

>pour beer into wizstrip


 Covering the bottle of WizStrip in ginger beer won't help your
 situation.

 Taken.
 Emptying the bottle of WizStrip over the cold chicken would just waste
 it to no useful purpose.
