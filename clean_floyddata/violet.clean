 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Calm down.  All you have to do is write a thousand words and everything
 will be fine.  And you have all day, except it's already noon.

 Violet
 A Distraction by Jeremy Freese
 Release 3, November 2008
 (New readers type ABOUT; HINTS available)

 You told me you were making progress.  Then I find out you haven't
 finished a paragraph in five months.  What did you expect?

 So now here you are, up in your office.  I am sorry that today is a
 Saturday.  I am especially sorry that today is your thirtieth birthday.
 We had all kinds of adventures planned.  I refuse to feel guilty.

 Of course I am still upset.  I will try to set that aside and be
 encouraging.  I really do want you to succeed today.

 Please just write.

>look
 When Wisconsin was recruiting your advisor they promised her space for
 graduate students.  You're in a decrepit building but otherwise it's
 not bad.

 You've a great big desk in front of a window, a resplendent yellow
 chair, a cabinet in one corner, a giant cactus in another, and a tall
 bookcase on the back wall with an incredibly cute stool in front of it.
 The door is west.

>inventory
 You're carrying nothing.

 You've a tattoo on the back of your hand.

>examine tattoo
 "Tattoo" isn't right.  You scrawled "TYVTWD" on the back of your hand
 before leaving this morning.  It stands for Take Your Violet To Work
 Day.  This is your plan: you are going to get through today by
 pretending I'm here with you.

 Just so we're clear: you are actually alone, and presumably I am back
 at our apartment, packing and crying.

 Somebody is coming up the stairs.  I thought you said no one ever comes
 in on the weekend?

>rub tattoo
 I feel a bit like you are just trying random things as a way of
 procrastinating.

 Please.  Just WRITE.

>sit on stool
 There is no reason to sit on the stool.  Stand on it if you need to
 reach something.  (And sit on your comfy yellow chair if you want to
 write.)

>sit on chair
 Okay.  You are seated at your desk and ready to go.  Just write!

 Two voices in the hallway: a man and Julia.  Julia hasn't been in her
 office in weeks.  She shows up on a Saturday?

>write
 Unfortunately, with all the pacing about and ruminating, you've been
 here over two hours but haven't actually opened your word processor
 yet.

>examine computer
 The desktop PC is old but perfectly fine for writing.  In addition to
 your word processor, applications you can OPEN include a browser, chat
 and e-mail.

 The computer has a USB port in the front and is connected to the
 Internet with a cable in back.

>examine desk
 Of course the big oak desk is unusually posh for a graduate student
 office.  It belonged to a professor who had a stroke at his computer
 and none of the other faculty wanted a desk on which once rested the
 head of a dead colleague.

 On top of the desk are your computer, my itinerary, a framed darling
 and a pile you cannot even contemplate right now.

 The desk's drawer is closed.  A wastebasket is on the floor to the
 left.

>examine framed darling
 Why you chose this photo of me, I don't know.  It's from a party last
 summer.  I've an enormous foam lobster on my head and whipped cream all
 over my right cheek.  I'm smiling manically and look like I may be so
 tipsy that I don't know what continent I'm on.

 Permit me two moments of immodesty:

 1.  Even in a picture where I'm not at my best, I am still clearly
 worth a thousand words.

 2.  The frame itself is very cleverly done.

>open word processor
 Open.  Chapter 3 of your dissertation awaits.  You can do it!

 Julia is here to sabotage you.  I'm sure of it.  She's in her office
 across the hall now, talking loudly with her door open.

>examine door
 (standing up first)
 It's a plain white wooden door.  On the other side is distraction and
 ruin.  Abandon hope, all ye who exit.

 On the wall beside the door is the lightswitch.  Above the door is a
 vent.

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 You start trying to focus on the screen and type, but you are very
 tired.   I realise that you hardly slept last night between being all
 worked up from our fight and then being banished to the dodgy futon in
 our living room.

 Still.  I know you won't let a little grogginess stop you.  You are
 determined.  For us!

>get determined
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine itinerary
 A printout of an airline receipt for a certain Ms. Violet C., for a
 flight from Madison to Chicago to Los Angeles to Auckland to Melbourne.
 One-way, refundable.  Departing early tomorrow morning.

 I hate that I've given you an ultimatum.  But I don't feel like I've
 any choice.

 The dude with Julia sounds like the one she was flirting with at Lucy's
 party.  Remember?  He was scrawny and said his parents owned a hotel in
 Milwaukee called "The Historic Pfister."

>write
 You are trying, I can tell.  But each time you begin to think through
 the opening sentence you get this dull cloudy tired pain right behind
 your eyes.

 Okay.  You want to write.  You just need to get yourself more awake
 first.

>examine coffee
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>stand
 You stand.

 I don't know why I confided in Lucy about our problems.  I should have
 known she would tell Julia.

>find coffee
 If you'd wanted coffee, you really ought to have stopped at Java Squid
 on the drive here.

>go west
 You need to write.  Your computer is here.

 (Besides, your office door is closed.  Might I add: for a reason.)

>look
 Many graduate students would be jealous of your having a door that you
 can close, high ceilings, and, most glamorous of all, a window.  You
 also have a huge desk, a gorgeous yellow chair, a cabinet, an
 admittedly incongruous cactus, a tall bookcase, and an incredibly cute
 stool.

 On the desk are your computer, my itinerary, a cleverly framed picture
 and a pile you cannot even contemplate.  A wastebasket is on the floor.

 You look out the window for a moment, at the wonderfully serene park
 across the street.  We could be frolicking right now.  We could be
 canoodling in the shrubbery.  Please just write.

>touch cactus
 Eek!  No.  Do you remember how last month you spent an entire afternoon
 whinging because you had a splinter?

>lick cactus
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>hit me
 You engage in a few zesty rounds of abusing yourself, but I don't think
 it really gets you any more awake.

>pinch me
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>rub eyes
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>exercise
 Sorry for being confused, budgie, but you're going to have to use a
 different verb for me to follow you.

>open drawer
 You open the drawer and there's a shiny little key and your notebook.

 Although you write on your computer, you still like to keep a pen and
 notebook handy because it sometimes helps to work out more complicated
 sentences in longhand before typing them in.  You've several pens in
 your bag.

 Hey, wallaroo: where's your bag?

>find bag
 I didn't understand that sentence.

 I don't see it here.  Where is it?

 Ugh.  You were so distracted this morning that you left your bag back
 at our apartment.  I am a gentle girlfriend and will refrain from
 marvelling at how it's past noon and you are only realising this now.

 You cannot go get your bag.  You know you are doomed to an afternoon of
 meandering distraction if you leave this office.

>examine key
 I believe it's the key to the cabinet.

 You are distracted by Julia laughing inauthentically and telling
 Historic Pfister "You are so clever."

 Do not even try to blame me for you forgetting your bag.

>take all from drawer
 One thing at a time today, dundeecake.

>take key
 Yours, vegemite.

>take notebook
 Yours, lorikeet.

>examine it
 It's a smallish notebook, about 10x15 centimetres.  The cover is
 lenticular. From this angle, it's a drawing of the comic book hero
 Professor Detective telling one of his graduate students, "You carry
 the heaviest of all burdens: POTENTIAL."

 Several pages inside the notebook have writing on them.

 You're looking out the window again.  Today in the park, a laughing
 couple that could have been us toss a frisbee back and forth, and an
 older gentleman is walking his malamute.

 The first page with writing has a sentence ending with the word "gaps."
 You've crossed this out and rewritten it with "lacunae" instead.  That
 you crossed out and tried "interstices."  You crossed that out in
 favour of "interstitial lacunae," but then that has several lines
 through it and a little drawing of me saying "Quit being pretentious."

>unlock cabinet with key
 You unlock the cabinet, glancing briefly at the trophy on top as you
 do.

>examine trophy
 You trained for months and had to run the entire race in the rain.  A
 chintzy little medal after all that?  You deserve better!  So
 afterwards I took the big sign I'd held up for you and spent two days
 folding it into a proper trophy.

>open cabinet
 Last night, near the very end:
 "I want you to have your birthday present regardless."
 "Violet, I'll write the thousand words."
 "I planned a treasure hunt for you.  I wrote clues!  It was going to
 end in your office."
 "I am going to write tomorrow.  I promise."
 "Look in that cabinet you never use.  You'll like how I wrapped it."

 You open the cabinet, revealing a very odd balloon and a plastic bottle
 filled with a fluorescent pink liquid.

>examine balloon
 It's about 25 centimetres across, milky white rubber decorated with
 purple ink swirls.  A strange furry thing is inside, its three long
 legs pressing against the sides.  At the bottom of the balloon is a
 bright yellow tab on which I've written "Pull me!"

 You are distracted by Julia talking about her abs.

>examine bottle
 The bottle is dusty.  Is this even yours, or is it left over from
 Marty?

 The label has several large characters of what looks like a cross of
 Chinese, Cyrillic, and cuneiform.  Small type beneath says  "Divine
 Soda Mega Energy". The label also has a drawing of a devil poking a man
 in the [bother]* with an electrified pitchfork.  The man's eyes bulge
 and his mouth rounds into a scream.

 The bottle is filled with a fluorescent pink liquid.

 You start looking toward the door with an irksome dreaminess.  Whatever
 else about Julia, the woman knows how to choose perfume.  Of course,
 I'm not sure how much she's poured on herself that you can smell it
 this far away.

 (BTW: I've decided I'm just going to "*" whenever I have an aside.
 ASIDE or * and I'll tell you.)

>examine bottle
 The only part of the label in English says "Divine Soda Mega Energy."
 The bottle is filled with a fluorescent pink liquid.

>take bottle
 Yours, muttonplum.

 You look toward the door: the perfume again.  I agree that it's really
 appealing.  But, still, this is Julia!*

>clean it
 I'm sorry if I'm being obtuse, little numbat, but I don't understand
 what that would accomplish.

>aside
 Remember when you first asked me out?  I said, "You already have a
 girlfriend."
 "I wouldn't if I had known I was going to meet you."
 "How charming.  Will you say the same thing to the woman you dump me
 for?"
 "Julia and I aren't serious.  She doesn't even care about me.  I'm the
 respectable diversion after the mess with the emeritus history
 professor leaving his wife.  The only reason she'd be upset is she's
 proud of her streak where no man has ever broken up with her."

 It's annoying how smitten you seem to be with Julia's perfume.  I'm not
 going to indulge you by describing its appeals in detail.

>open bottle
 It's open.

 You're looking out the window again.  A blond-haired father and
 even-blonder son are walking into the park from the east, and entering
 your view from the west is a zombie.

>drink liquid
 Holy [bother] is that strong!  You feel like your brain is now a giant
 sparkler.  You feel invincible.  You feel like buying a circus.  You
 feel like moving to South America and starting a revolution.

 Dissertation?  You feel like writing a trilogy.  And an opera.  You
 feel like fathering roomfuls of monkeys to type randomly until they
 write your dissertation for you.

 Whatever else, you're now plenty alert.  (I'm e-mailing Marty to find
 out where I can get some of that.)

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 Completely, unblinkingly alert, you start thinking again about the
 first sentence.  "Previous scholarship has typically conceptualized..."
 Six seconds later you check your e-mail.  You switch back to your word
 processor for a bit, but then you start reading some blogs.  You check
 your e-mail again.  Then back to blogs.

 I suspect this is much of how the past several months in your office
 have gone.

>write
 You start again.  Except you immediately check your e-mail.  Then you
 read some web comics.  Then a few of your favourite Professor Detective
 fanblogs.

 Please, gumnut.  You need to focus.

 You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly "...You could use
 mine to calculate pi..."*

>focus
 For me, honestly, it's as simple as that.  For you, it's more
 difficult.  You are still wonderful.

 Remember the story about how when Julia was in college, she told two
 math guys she'd hook up with whichever one memorised pi to the most
 places?  She made them stand on chairs at a party, alternating digits
 until one of them missed.  She claims it went on for two hours.

 Then she didn't even go home with the winner!  Instead there was a
 Russian computer scientist who claimed he could spontaneously generate
 truly random digits.  She said, "Prove it!"  He said, "Four!"  And she
 swooned and pulled him into a bathroom.

 I cannot believe she told you that story and you continued dating her.

>scream at julia
 That is what Julia wants.  She wants you to engage her.  She wants you
 to argue with her because she knows it will get you wound up and then
 you won't be able to concentrate the rest of the day.  You must ignore
 her.

>kiss photo
 You can only do that to something animate.

>examine frame
 I took the concert flier from our first "date" and made it into a hard
 plastic laminate--you know, like a Shrinky Dink.  I made a clear
 plastic sheet the same size to go over the front of the photograph.
 Then I fused a sturdy binder clip to the two pieces to hold everything
 in place.

 You are thinking about your bag.  Sure, it's unfortunate, but there's
 nothing you can do.  So just forget about it.

>examine window
 (standing up first)
 Your window is immediately behind your desk, about two metres high and
 one wide.  It has an old grey blind, which is raised.

 On the sill I am a bit surprised to see a lighter.

 You look out the window.  The zombie in the park is dressed like an
 investment banker, but you recognise him as a zombie because of the
 pasty skin, blood dripping from his mouth, and lurching gait.  He
 pauses to look at his watch.

>take lighter
 Yours, sticky pudding.  It's hard for me to be enthusiastic about
 lighters as a woman who owns her own blowtorch.

>lower blind
 You pull the cord and nothing happens.  You complained to me about this
 weeks ago and I explained what the problem likely was and how to fix
 it.  Remember?

 You are distracted by Julia going on loudly about how you get a
 discount if you get both tongue piercings at the same time.

>examine cord
 It's a plain white cord, easily tangled.

>untangle it
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>pull cord
 You pull the cord again and nothing happens.  I think you'll have to
 get on your desk and look at the blind to figure out what's wrong.

>stand on stool
 The stool creaks as you climb onto it.

 You're looking out the window again.  A second zombie enters the park
 from the east, holding a sign.  The first zombie looks relieved.

>examine blind
 (first getting off the stool)
 I wish the blind was more colourful.  It's raised.  There's a cord.

 I don't think you're going to be able to figure out what the problem is
 with the blind from down here.  You'll have to get onto the desk.

>examine sign
 You know those hipsters-dressed-up-as-zombies, they're always agitating
 about something.

>read sign
 You know those hipsters-dressed-up-as-zombies, they're always agitating
 about something.

 You are distracted by Julia talking about her [bother].  I can't
 believe you dated someone so crass.

>stand on desk
 You climb onto your desk.  Be careful, fruit cup.

>examine blind
 You can see what's wrong with the blind now.  The little whatever is
 stuck.*  This is easy: you can just FIX it.

>aside
 Actual-Me of course knows precisely what the whatever is called.  I
 used the right term when I explained the workings of your blind to you
 at length on that napkin at WinkyDog.  Imaginary-Me is using "whatever"
 because you don't remember.

>fix blind
 You squint at the whatever for awhile and fiddle.  Squint, fiddle,
 still stuck.  I think when I said you could easily fix it what I really
 meant was that, if I were there, I could easily fix it.

 Squint, fiddle, SNAP.  You did it!  Or, wait, maybe you broke it.

 Looking closer, you've definitely broken the whatever.  Perhaps you've
 also fixed it.  I can't tell.

 Your eyes go all dreamy again as the latest waft of Julia's perfume
 induces another galling little reverie.  Ugh.  You have to snap out of
 this.

>examine blind
 The blind is raised.

>pull cord
 You pull the cord and the blind lowers halfway, then stops.

>again
 You raise the blind.

 You're looking out the window again.  The sign held by the zombie says
 "Zombies Was People Too".  Another pair of people dressed up as zombies
 enter the park.  One holds a sign saying "Undead and Proud!"

 (presuming you want to pull the cord)
 You pull the cord and the blind lowers halfway again.  That's all the
 lower it's going now that you've broken the whatever.  Ugh.

>stand
 I'm confused.  You're presently standing on the floor of your office.

>examine whatever
 It's broken now.

 You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Impressive, huh?
 When I was in high school my guidance counsellor recommended that I
 become a contortionist."

>take whatever
 That seems to be a part of the blind.

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 (getting off the desk first)
 You look at the blank screen for a few moments and then check your
 e-mail.  You hit refresh just in case someone has e-mailed in the last
 four seconds.  Now you are looking at procrastination self-help
 websites.  I am trying to remain calm.

>write
 No pretence, even: you start checking e-mail immediately.  Now you are
 watching some random online food safety videos.  We need to face the
 fact that you must somehow force yourself to be offline before you'll
 get any writing accomplished.

 You are thinking about your bag again.  "Why am I always so forgetful?"
 you say aloud.  "Why am always I so disorganized?"  Lorikeet, dwelling
 on it won't help. "I know!" you exclaim.  "Why do I always dwell on
 everything?"

>examine modem
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine computer
 The PC is old but fine.  Applications include a word processor,
 browser, chat, and e-mail.

 The computer has a USB port in the front and is connected to the
 Internet with a cable in back.

>unplug cable
 You unplug the ethernet cable.  Good!  It has to be easier to write if
 you can't chat, check e-mail, and surf the web whenever you want.

>write
 You resume thinking about the first sentence.  You fidget.  Your hands
 tremble a bit.  You want to check your e-mail.  You want to read blogs.
 And then: you retrieve the cable and plug it back into the computer.

 Ugh.  I didn't know it was this bad, spongemuffin.  I don't know what
 to say.

 You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "It's not so much
 that I'm double jointed as just very determined."

>unplug cable
 Done, weet-bix.  You're now holding the ethernet cable.

>open window
 (standing up first)
 For a graduate student like yourself, having an office with a window
 and a great view is almost too much to hope for.  A window that
 actually opens is, in fact, too much to hope for.

>break window
 It's hard for me to see what purpose breaking your window would serve.
 More importantly, someone would almost certainly see and call campus
 security, and that will introduce new hassles to your afternoon and
 prevent you from getting any writing done.

 You're looking out the window again.  There are maybe a dozen zombies
 in the park now, lurching and milling about.  Two unfurl a
 blood-spattered banner that says, "What do we want?  Brains!  When do
 we want them?  Brains!"

 I'm confused.  That's not something you can eat.

>chew cable
 Please do not squander your afternoon indiscriminately gnawing at
 things around your office.

>cut cable with teeth
 I only understood you as far as wanting to cut the blue ethernet cable.

>step on cable
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>examine it
 I don't know why they've used a 50 foot ethernet cable when it's less
 than three feet from your computer to the jack.  Much of the cable is
 dirty from all the dust and whatever else has collected underneath your
 desk.

 You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Sure, she's
 cute.  If you can get past the mole."

 Hey!  Watch it, Julia.

>examine connector
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>put cable in wastebasket
 You put the blue ethernet cable into the wastebasket.

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 You try again.  Two minutes later you take the cable and plug it back
 into the computer.  You start idly googlestalking friends from primary
 school.

 Okay.  We are not going to to be able to work out your "internet
 addiction" issues today, lemon squidgie.  We need to figure out a way
 forward anyway.

>take cable
 Done, berry smush.  You're now holding the ethernet cable.

 Meanwhile, it has become officially disconcerting just how much you're
 distracted by Julia's strumpy perfume.

>unplug it
 The cable is not plugged in to the computer.

>take balloon
 (standing up first)
 Yours, pollywaffle.

>look in cabinet'
 On the cabinet's top is a spectacularly intricate origami trophy.

 You're looking out the window again.  The zombie march has attracted
 counter-protesters.  One of them is an older man in overalls who is
 holding an American flag in one hand and a sign saying "These colors
 don't lurch" in the other.

>open cabinet
 That's already open.

>put cable in it
 You put the blue ethernet cable into the cabinet.

>close it
 That's not something you can close.

 You are distracted by Julia saying "She makes things that look like
 summer camp crafts and tries to convince people they're art."

 I wonder if I'd get away with it if I killed her right before my flight
 leaves tomorrow morning.

>close cabinet
 You close the cabinet.

>lock cabinet with key
 You lock the cabinet.  Clever little wallaroo.

 It's University Drab, about a metre high with a silly fake wood front.
 It's closed and locked.

 On top of the cabinet is the opposite of drab: a stupendously intricate
 origami trophy.

 You are thinking about your bag again.  Honestly, you probably don't
 even really need a pen, except now you're obsessing about how you'd
 have a pen if only you hadn't forgotten your bag.

>put key in vent
 Why would you think you can reach the vent from here?

>stand on stool
 The stool creaks again as you climb onto it.

>put key in vent
 Why would you think you can reach the vent from here?

 You are distracted by Julia loudly saying "I bet when they first hooked
 up, she was like, 'Would you like to see my didgeridoo?'"  (That has to
 be the most gallingly inept fake Australian accent I have ever heard.
 She sounds like a Norwegian parakeet.)

>examine vent
 (first getting off the stool)
 It's an ordinary vent with a metal grill.

 A purplish bit of something is under the right bottom corner of the
 vent.  You can't see what it is from down here.

>purplish
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>examine purplish
 You can't really make out what the purplish bit is from down here.
 You'd need to move something over to the door that you can stand on.

>move stool to door
 The stool is now by the door.

 You're looking out the window again.  A wood-panelled van pulls up on
 the street in front of the park.  "Wood-panelled" doesn't perhaps
 describe it right, as it's more like someone put wood veneer around the
 entire frame of the van, to make it look like a ship or something.

>stand on stool
 The stool creaks once again as you climb onto it.

>examine purplish
 It's some thread.  But, like I said, nutter butter, it's stuck in the
 corner of the vent above you.  If you want to get a good look at it,
 take it first.

>take it
 Yours, cuttlefish.

 You are distracted by Julia laughing and mock-shrieking "Or maybe,
 'Touch my kiwi!  Touch my kiwi!'"  Ugh.  How can someone almost have
 her Ph.D. and not know that kiwis are New Zealand, not Australia?

>examine thread
 It's perhaps ten centimetres long.  I adore lilac!  I've a jumper this
 colour (I mean, a sweater--such a quirky word.)

>examine vent
 The vent has a square metal grill.  You try to look into the vent but
 it's dark and you are still maybe 30 centimetres or more below it.  You
 won't be able to see into the vent from here.

>open vent
 I'm sure one day you'll have an office with a window you can open and a
 vent you can close.  But not while you're a graduate student.

 You have another incredibly annoying swoony moment because of Julia's
 perfume.

>put key in vent
 Unfortunately, the key doesn't quite fit between the bars of the grill
 in front of the vent.

>examine grill
 It's just a metal grid.  It's not the kind you can open or close.

 You are trying to break random things as a way of procrastinating.

 You're looking out the window again.  The back door of the van opens
 and ten pirates storm out of the back, swords raised.

>stand
 You are already on the stool.

>eat key
 It looks so easy in movies!   You put it in your mouth and will
 yourself to swallow hard.  But when the key is at the top of your
 throat, some primordial terror reflex kicks in and you cough the key
 back into your hand.

>look
 Bear in mind that, meanwhile, I'm using the walk-in closet of our
 apartment as a "studio."

 You've a quite large desk in front of a window, a resplendent yellow
 chair, a cabinet in one corner, an absurdly large cactus in another,
 and a tall bookcase on the back wall with an incredibly cute stool.
 The door is west.

 On the desk are your computer, my itinerary, a cleverly framed picture
 and a pile you cannot even contemplate.  A miraculously intricate
 origami trophy sits on top of the cabinet.  A wastebasket is on the
 floor.

 You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "You've been
 working out.  I've noticed."

 Oh no.

>examine bookcase
 (first getting off the stool)
 Two weeks ago:
 "Violet.  Take this.  Do not give it back to me for a month."
 "Is this your car key?"
 "Just the trunk.  The boot.  I put all the books from my office in
 there."
 "You said you just needed to read one more book and then you were ready
 to write."
 "And you pointed out that I've said that several times before.  You're
 right.  I've read enough.  I just need to get what's in my head onto
 the computer."

 Of course I'm so used to seeing your bookcase full that it's strange
 now to see it nearly empty.

 On the second shelf is a book.  On the bottom shelf is a smartly-done
 snowglobe.

>look behind bookcase
 Nothing.  I'm not sure what you were expecting.

>put key behind it
 The bookcase is bolted firmly to the wall.

 Your attention wanders as you start admonishing yourself again for
 forgetting your bag.  Oh, sweateroo.  Your gaze upward in
 self-loathing, whereupon you are suddenly distracted by something odd
 about the sprinkler in the corner above the cactus.

 Remember?  Last October:
 "Hey, wallaroo, why is there a pen between the sprinkler and the
 ceiling?"
 "It's been there since I moved in."
 "How could somebody even wedge a pen up in there like that?"
 "It's even more mysterious considering that the previous occupant of
 this office was a dwarf."
 "Marty! He was hilarious! Remember the prank with the disappearing ink
 toner cartridge?"
 "That was mostly you, dear.  All Marty did was slip it in Julia's
 printer before her big presentation."

>examine book
 This is the latest "last book you really must read before you are able
 to write your dissertation without a nagging feeling that there is one
 more book you really must read."  If you start reading it now, hours
 will go by, and you won't write your thousand words.

>examine snowglobe
 It's a glass globe with a plain wooden bottom.  Inside is a happy
 winter scene, with a paunchy, smiling figurine in a white outfit and
 snow up to his ankles.  His hands look like they are covered with
 chocolate.

 (BTW: you know full well that Marty is not a dwarf.  He isn't even
 especially short.*)

>examine sprinkler
 The sprinkler looks pretty ordinary.  What's not ordinary is the pen
 that is wedged at an angle between the nozzle and the ceiling.

 You are distracted by Julia squealing, "Wait, it's your birthday, too?
 Why didn't you tell me earlier?"

>examine pen
 It's a bright lavender tube, like the brand of gel-ink pen that Marty
 used to use.  There are some scratchings on the side that look like
 letters, but from here you cannot read what it says.

 It's interesting how your mind consistently malforms men who have
 crushes on me.  Colin has three tiny birthmarks on his cheek and you
 call him "Splotchy Boy."

>move stool to sprinkler
 If you want to move the charming stool, possible places are to the DESK
 (where the chair is), to the DOOR (where the stool is), to the CORNER
 by the cactus, or to the BOOKCASE.

>move stool to corner
 The stool is now as close to the corner as it can get, considering that
 the pot and cactus are in the way.  Because the floor here is uneven
 and the stool is flimsy, it's extremely wobbly.  Please do not try to
 stand on it.

 You're looking out the window again.  A pirate with a sword attacks a
 zombie who protects himself with surprising agility for the recently
 reanimated.  Another pirate affixes a mast to the top of the van.
 Still another hunches beside the van sticking a fake wooden leg over
 his real leg.

>examine pot
 The pot is big and looks like pewter.  We've both been baffled at how
 heavy it is.  I wonder if the business school professor had the cactus
 specially repotted before he left just to make it more expensive for
 Madison to dispose of.

>push pot
 The pot is incredibly heavy and you cannot move it anywhere.

>stand on stool
 I wish you wouldn't, but, you climb on to the stool.  You start
 reaching up to the sprinkler but then you begin to lose your balance
 and the stool tips over beneath you and you fall, hitting your head on
 the edge of the pot.  You are out cold.

 It's sad to think that perhaps our relationship would have been saved
 if only you'd kept ample office supplies on hand.



     *** Our relationship is over ***



 We don't have to end this way.  You can UNDO the last turn.  You can
 also RESTART or RESTORE a saved game.  If you'd rather finish breaking
 my heart, then by all means, QUIT.

>undo
 Time travel makes me twitchy.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine creature
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine balloon
 It's about 25 centimetres across, milky white rubber decorated with
 purple ink swirls.  A strange furry thing is inside, its three long
 legs pressing against the sides.  At the bottom of the balloon is a
 bright yellow tab on which I've written "Pull me!"

 You are distracted by a startled grunt from Historic Pfister.  I do not
 believe this is happening.

>SAVE
>cf1
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>pull yellow tab
 You pull the tab and the balloon deflates with a pop and whoosh.  You
 hear me shout "Happy birthday!" and zestily toot a kazoo.

 What's left is a white rubber square with a message written on it.  You
 are also holding the three-legged furry thing, which you now realise is
 an electronic device.

>examine square
 It's about 10 centimetres square and has a message handwritten in
 purple on it.  One corner is a double piece stitched over so that it is
 like a tiny pouch.

 In the "pouch" is a small chip.

>read it
 You stretch the rubber square so that you can read what I've written:

 Happy birthday!  I know you wanted a boring ordinary music player, but
 I got my brother to send the latest piece of consumer electronics
 GENIUS from the kangaroo corridor.

 Behold: the platyPod!  Why three headphones?  The middle one attaches
 by suction to your forehead for complete hands-free and display-free
 control.  Not to mention kick-[bother] extra bass.  Why is it furry?
 Don't ask me: Melbourne is in the throes of an epic fake-fur fad I
 don't understand.  But this is going to be a HUGE hit, and not just
 among the armless blind.

 Charge it with your computer.  Then SCRUNCH YOUR BROW to turn it on.
 I've already put some bonus presents on it.

 You are my FAVOURITE!
 Violet

>examine device
 It looks like a set of over-the-head headphones, except there is a
 third one and it's covered with short, brown fur.  There's a little
 plug that allows it to connect to the USB port of a computer.  Tiny
 letters on the plug say "platyPod."

 Julia's stupid perfume again.  Remember when she was all excited to
 meet Lucy's brother after she heard he was a pheromone scientist?

>plug playpod to port
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>plug in platypod
 I only understood you as far as wanting to plug the inside.

>plug platypod in port
 You plug in the platyPod.  It will beep when it is fully charged.

>examine chip
 You can't get a good look at the chip while it's still in the pouch.

>take chip
 Yours, chunky rabbit.

 (The rubber is really strong and stretchy for how thin it is, isn't it?
 I got it from a company that makes weapons-grade slingshots.)

 You're looking out the window again.  The zombies and pirates stop and
 point toward the sky to the west.

>examine chip
 It's like one of those chips in a musical greeting card, with a tiny
 plum-coloured "V." painted on it.  When you squeeze it you hear me
 shout "Happy birthday!" and then a cheery kazoo toot.

 BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!  The platyPod is fully charged.  You retrieve it and
 return to what you were doing.

>put chip in platypod
 It's just a customised version of one of those chips that are in
 musical greeting cards.  You don't have to worry about trying to find
 something to put it into.

>squeeze chip
 You hear me shouting "Happy birthday!" followed by a cheery kazoo toot.

 You are distracted by Historic Pfister making noises perhaps best
 characterised as mewling.

>wear platypod
 The platyPod fits nicely in your ears and against your forehead.  It is
 switched off.

>turn it on
 There's no switch of any kind of the platyPod.  It's completely
 hands-free!  (That is, once it's on your head.)

 The rubber square has instructions for how to turn on the platyPod.

>scrunch brow
 My voice: "Look, it even lets you record a start-up message!  How the
 platyPod works: You cycle through the different playlists by RAISING
 your left or right eyebrow.   NOD to skip to the next track.  JIGGLE
 your head clockwise to turn the volume up, and jiggle it anticlockwise
 to turn it down."

 The platyPod turns on.  A mechanical Aussie voice announces, "Now
 playing 'MC Dingo: Straight Outta Down Under'" You groan, because you
 are like every other parochial American who refuses to give Australian
 hip-hop a proper chance.

 The volume is low.  You can still sometimes hear Julia and Historic
 Pfister across the hall.

 You tug your hair anguishedly and say out loud, "The pen is emblematic
 of what a [bother]-up I am."  Please, chocolate crackle.  It's just a
 pen.  Don't start down one of your spirals about it.

>raise right eyebrow
 A mechanical Aussie voice announces, "Now playing Professor Detective:
 The Novel."

>nod
 Professor Detective explains to Undergraduate Constable Duffy that a
 murderer who escapes justice will invariably kill again, and the same
 logic applies to plagiarists.

>nod
 Professor Detective is doing a crossword during a faculty meeting when
 suddenly the lights go out and a woman screams.

>nod
 The Confounder has Professor Detective tied up in his secret hideout
 next to the cyclotron.   The Confounder cackles and taunts, "Let's see
 if tenure will save you now."

>nod
 Professor Detective follows a shadowy figure into one of the steam
 tunnels underneath the engineering building.

>nod
 Professor Detective understands that every second counts when you are
 trying to foil a plot to destroy the world, but these are his office
 hours.

>nod\
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>nod
 Professor Detective sighs and clarifies to Undergraduate Constable
 Duffy that, no, what he is explaining about the muddy footprint will
 not be on the test.

>raise right eyebrow
 A mechanical Oz voice announces, "Now playing Primrose Meanwell." She's
 the friend from uni I was telling you about.   Absolutely the shyest
 person--then last week I get an e-mail announcing she's recorded an
 album!

 You are distracted by Julia saying, "Wait, if today is the 24th, and
 you are 24, that makes this your golden birthday."  Well, then.

>nod
 Primrose sings about how she likes to write in her journal.

>nod
 Primrose sings about how she has a special purple pen that she uses
 when she writes about boys.  I'm not sure I've ever heard a lead singer
 whose voice is so inconspicuous.

>raise right eyebrow
 A mechanical Oz voice announces, "Now playing Warren Tim Harried:
 Greatest Hits" (Hooray!  Our favourite!)

 You're looking out the window again.  Holy [bother].  Somebody built a
 dirigible for this.  The outside appears to be covered in aluminium
 foil, so it's good it just missed the power lines as it descends into
 the park.

>nod
 Warren Tim Harried is playing "Please Don't (My Grandma Gave Me That)"
 from Runt with an Accordion, recorded when he was fourteen years old.

>jiggle head clockwise
 You move your head in cute little clockwise circles.  The volume is now
 so loud that you cannot hear Julia and Historic Pfister at all.

>load square
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>inventory
 You're carrying a small chip, a rubber square, a bit of lilac thread, a
 lighter, an empty plastic bottle, a notebook and a shiny little key,
 and you're wearing the platyPod.

 Warren is playing "Someday They'll Go Too Far," which became a hit on
 local pirate radio stations after being discovered by school
 authorities and played on the evening news.

>shoot key at pen
 Hmm.  While I didn't have this in mind when I made it, the rubber
 square could be used like a slingshot if you put a suitable object in
 the little pouch.

>put key in square
 That isn't a container, spicy biscuit.  Unless I'm misunderstanding
 what you are trying to do.

>put key in pouch
 As strong and stretchy as the rubber is, you basically have a slingshot
 now that something is in the pouch.  You could SHOOT SOMETHING.  If I'm
 going to patent this, I should think about whether this unanticipated
 functionality exposes me to any legal risk.

 Warren is playing "No Normal Boy Would Write That Song," recorded
 during a weekend furlough from a private psychiatric facility for
 troubled adolescent boys.

>shoot pen
 The key isn't going to work.  It gets half-stuck coming out of the
 pouch and then just flutters to the floor.

>take pen
 You can't reach it.  The sprinkler is more than three metres off the
 floor.

>take key
 Yours, banana squizzle.

 You have got to get over Julia's perfume.  I am being indulgent with
 you here.

>put chip in pouch
 You put the small chip into the rubber square's "pouch".

>shoot pen
 The chip isn't really a good shape for this.  It flies in a odd arc and
 misses several feet to the right.

>take chip
 Yours, toaster strudel.

 You're looking out the window again.  The zombies and pirates have
 regained their composure and are lurching and marauding (respectively)
 toward the landed aircraft.  The hatch at the bottom opens with strange
 green smoke billowing out.

>put lighter in pouch
 The lighter is a bit too long to fit in the pouch.

>inventory
 You're carrying a small chip, a shiny little key, a rubber square, a
 bit of lilac thread, a lighter, an empty plastic bottle and a notebook,
 and you're wearing the platyPod.

>examine bottle
 The only part of the label in English says "Divine Soda Mega Energy."
 The bottle is empty.

 You look up at the ceiling.  "Colin wouldn't have forgotten his bag."
 you say ruefully.  "Colin would never be without a pen."  Please,
 mintchip.  This is not a helpful line of thinking.

>take quill
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>take thorn
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine cactus
 Supposedly the cactus belonged to a business school professor who left
 Madison for another university in a snit.  An accidental transposition
 of numbers on a form caused it to be moved in here instead of
 University Botanical Disposal, and your department won't pay to move it
 again so it's been here for years.

 Obtrusive, sure, but at least it hides that ugly pipe leading up to the
 sprinkler on your wall.  Plus plants are cheery.  I'm glad the pot is
 too heavy for you to be able to move it yourself.

>examine pipe
 The garish chrome pipe was obviously added sometime after the building
 was built, in response to some amendment to the fire code.  It is flush
 against the wall and runs all the way up to a sprinkler that is only a
 few inches from the ceiling.

>examine tag
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>look
 There was a professor at uni in Melbourne who was sacked for living in
 an office smaller than this.  He had a few kangaroos loose in the top
 paddock, as my mum would say.

 You've a big desk in front of a window, a gorgeous yellow chair, a
 cabinet in one corner, a giant cactus in another, and a tall bookcase
 on the back wall with an incredibly cute stool.  The door is west.

 On the desk are your computer, my itinerary, a cleverly framed picture
 and a pile you cannot even contemplate.  A fabulously intricate origami
 trophy sits on top of the cabinet.  The bookcase contains a book and a
 smartly-done snowglobe.  A wastebasket is on the floor.

 Warren is playing "My Lonesome Pain is Not A Polka" from We Paid You
 For Happy, the artistic breakthrough composed while he supported
 himself with gigs at family reunions and retirement centres.

>look in wastebasket
 It's the standard issue University Dreary--sullen cousin of University
 Drab--metal wastebasket.

 A wad of gum is stuck to the wastebasket's rim.

>take gum
 You pull the gum off the wastebasket's rim.  Ick.

>roll gum
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>put gum in pouch
 You put the piece of Two Bob Slobber bubble gum into the rubber
 square's "pouch".

 You're looking out the window again.  Two aliens step through the
 hatch, green skin and giant foreheads.  Eight other aliens jump out of
 the bushes and start attacking the pirates and zombies with these
 silver sticks that have a chartreuse coil wrapped around them.

>shoot pen
 The gum is maybe not quite dense enough to work.  It flies in a looping
 arc and hits the ceiling several inches from the sprinkler without much
 velocity.

>take gum
 Yours, crunchie.

>look under desk
 Underneath your desk you see the amethyst-encrusted Sword Of
 Dissertator Melancholia.

 Warren is playing from Drumsticks, the bootleg album recorded during a
 performance at a family fried chicken restaurant.

>examine sword
 Wallaroo.  I was just kidding about there being a hitherto unnoticed
 "Sword Of Dissertator Melancholia" under your desk.

>examine sword
 Don't belabour the joke.  There is no sword here.

>xyzzy
 That time on the sixth floor of the library:
 "Violet, that was-- that was--"
 "Magical?"
 "How did you do that?"
 "Any sufficiently awesome girlfriend is indistinguishable from magic."

>move wastebasket
 Moving the wastebasket around your office isn't going to accomplish
 anything, cheese nip.

 Warren is playing "You With the Notepad," the stunning and entirely
 improvised final track done without once breaking eye contact with a
 woman later identified as Francine Kinkle, music editor for a local
 college newspaper.

>disassemble frame
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>examine frame
 As I said, I took the concert flier from our first "date" and made it
 into a hard plastic laminate--you know, like a Shrinky Dink.  I made a
 clear plastic sheet the same size to go over the front of the
 photograph.  Then I fused a sturdy binder clip to the two pieces to
 hold everything in place.

>examine clip
 I've fused the binder clip to the rest of the frame.  You can't do
 anything to it without breaking the frame, which, it goes without
 saying, has considerable sentimental value for us both.

>look in trophy
 It's exactly the same shape as the trophy they give to the winner of
 Sydney's Marathon.  Bright fuchsia lines curl in and out of the folds.

 I am going to be so angry if you're hiding a story about Julia doing
 some kind of Pavlovian conditioning experiments on you with the perfume
 when the two of you dated.*

 Don't even try to act like that's implausible.  Julia is so twisted.
 This is the woman who once asked if she could put on an album of
 recorded 911 calls while the two of you were intimate.  (And you
 continued dating her afterwards!  Unbelievable!)

>who is julia
 Oh, you know.  You know intimately.

>unfold trophy
 You take the trophy I made for you and methodically unfold it.  I
 cannot decide whether to be exasperated or moved by how you are so
 careful not to tear it.  You're now holding a crumply sign, about a
 metre square.

 Ugh.  I was so excited to give you that trophy.  I realise you are
 desperate because you don't want me to leave.  You can do this.  I am
 cheering for you.

>examine sign
 It's all crumply now.  The bright fuchsia letters say:

 You are my
 FAVOURITE!

>cover window with sign
 (putting the crumply sign on the sill)
 You put the sign on the sill.  The sign and the blind together now
 block the view out your window entirely.

>throw rubber at pen
 It's too flappy.  It ends up just fluttering to the floor.

 You look up at the ceiling again.  "Colin finished his Ph.D.  Colin has
 a job at Yale."  Colin is not germane to your current predicament.
 It's just a pen.

>take rubber
 Yours, teacake.

>examine floor
 It's drab and would look much better if we found a rug that matched the
 chair.  (I'm not sure why I am so preoccupied with your office decor
 when what I want is for you to finish so we can get out of Madison.)

 The floor slopes alarmingly downward over in the corner by the cactus,
 like that whole part of the room may be about to collapse.

 On your floor is a wastebasket.

>examine walls
 Remember how Marty hung a couple of his paintings when this was his
 office?  I wish you'd put up at least a couple posters.  Your walls are
 so dreary and bare.  Not anything to worry about today, of course.

 The lightswitch is on the wall by the door.

>examine lightswitch
 It's just an ordinary lightswitch.  The light is on.

 Warren is playing the title track from Francine.  (Actually, all 37
 songs on the album are officially titled "Francine.")

>examine light
 It's a long, unadorned fluorescent bulb, like there is in all the other
 graduate student offices in the building.  I am so glad I bought the
 happy light for my studio.  There is no way I would get work done
 during the winter in Madison without it.  I'm so glad it's finally
 spring.

>examine chair
 It was just some dreary old office chair that they dragged up from the
 basement for you, but then I came up one weekend with this amazing
 yellow veloury-pleatherish fabric and upholstered it.

>examine fabric
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>search chair
 There is nothing on your yellow chair.

>take snowglobe
 Yours, marshmallow twimble.  I still can't believe I stayed up two
 nights straight making it.

 Warren is playing the song unofficially titled "Parking Garage,"
 following the convention of identifying tracks on Francine by the
 location of the tryst the liner notes say inspired them.

>examine it
 It's a glass globe with a plain wooden bottom.  Inside is a happy
 winter scene, with a paunchy, smiling figurine in a white outfit and
 snow up to his ankles.  His hands look like they are covered with
 chocolate.

>break it
 But, you said you thought it was brilliant.  Why would you want to
 break it?

>break it
 But, you said you thought it was brilliant.  Why would you want to
 break it?

>examine base
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>turn over snowglobe
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>shake it
 You shake the globe vigorously.  The snow starts swirling around the
 globe, turning pink and then red.

 Remember? Watching television at midnight:
 "The Saskatoon Strangler.  He killed six people before being arrested
 by the mounties in 1986."
 "A documentary about a serial killer at bedtime?"
 "Only six people, Violet.  Plus, he worked as a confectioner!"
 "If I can't sleep, you can't complain about the noise when I start
 working on something."

 Warren is playing "Booth Seven at Steak'n'Shake," the track on Francine
 that got him tour dates opening for ironic death metal icon Jimmy
 Catkicker.

>examine snowglobe
 The snow is now a blood red blizzard roiling around the figurine in the
 middle, whose eyes now gleam sinister and whose hands now look like
 they are covered in blood instead of chocolate.

>shake snowglobe
 The snow becomes a beautiful blood red.

>put snowglobe in pouch
 The snowglobe is too big to fit in the pouch.

>examine bottom shelf
 You see nothing special about the bottom shelf.

 You're distracted by Julia's perfume again.  I'm sure she sprayed on a
 second gallon this morning just to sidetrack you.

>examine top shelf
 You see nothing special about the top shelf.

>examine middle shelf
 You see nothing special about the middle shelf.

>examine book
 Sure, the book looks like something you'd find interesting.  I'm not
 going to describe its contents any further, though, as I don't want to
 risk enticing you to start reading it.

>open book
 I can see why the book is relevant to your dissertation, but it isn't
 what you are building it up in your mind as being.  And you know that
 you don't really need to read it in order to start writing.

 You look once more to the ceiling.  "Colin is never without office
 supplies.  Colin never mispronounces 'Aussie' like it rhymes with
 'bossy'."

>examine eraser
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine paper clip
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine pile
 It's detritus from teaching, a couple unfinished side projects, and the
 earlier dissertation topic that you asked We Never Speak Of Again.
 It's been accumulating and now makes you feel too overwhelmed even to
 contemplate.

 Except today, when you absolutely must write, you are feeling an
 overwhelming urge to tidy it.

>search pile
 What you really feel compelled to do with the pile is tidy it.

>tidy pile
 You pick up one thing, then put it back down.  You pick up another then
 put that down.  You start thinking that what you really need is
 comprehensive office-straightening solution.  You're thinking about
 making a diagram, maybe a spreadsheet.

 STOP.  This is not what you should be doing today.

 Out of the pile, however, you do pick up a potato gem.

>examine gem
 (I always forget they aren't called potato gems here.  Just like I can
 never remember that it's "cotton candy" instead of "fairy floss.")

 I think you brought tater tots for your lunch a fortnight ago.  I hope
 it's not older than that.

 Warren is playing from his follow-up album to Francine, which was also
 titled Francine.

>put gem in pouch
 You put the tater tot into the rubber square's "pouch".

>shoot pen
 You're a very good shot.  I guess you were serious about that spooky
 bowhunting uncle.  The tater tot misses the pen by less than half an
 inch and hits the wall, where it shatters.

 I think you've the right idea, though.  One more shot and I bet you'll
 hit it.

>examine gem
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>tidy pile
 After the earlier try, you've realised that tidying the mess is not a
 good use of your time today.

>examine desk
 It's an enviable desk, even if someone did die on it.  On top are your
 computer, my itinerary, a cleverly framed picture and a pile you cannot
 even contemplate.

 The desk's drawer is empty.  A wastebasket is on the floor to the left.

 Warren is playing excerpts from "Why?," originally an eighty-three
 minute song in which he stops playing once to cry and twice to leave
 voicemails for Francine.

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 Within three minutes you've taken the cable out of the cabinet and are
 watching a video of a dog dressed as a ballerina.  Oh, plucky wombat.
 If you can't be disciplined, then you'll have to be clever.

 You do unplug the cable again and lock it back in the cabinet.  Now,
 what to do with the key?

>undo
 I'm doing jazz hands right now.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>put key in pouch
 You put the shiny little key into the rubber square's "pouch".

>shoot pen
 The key isn't going to work.  It gets half-stuck coming out of the
 pouch and then just flutters to the floor.

>take key
 Yours, plucky wombat.

>put gum in pouch
 You put the piece of Two Bob Slobber bubble gum into the rubber
 square's "pouch".

 Warren is playing "It's Because He Plays Guitar, Isn't it?"

>shoot pen
 The gum is maybe not quite dense enough to work.  It flies in a looping
 arc and hits the ceiling several inches from the sprinkler without much
 velocity.

>take gum
 Yours, honeytoast.

>put gum on key
 Clever, wonkabar.  Unfortunately, the gum's not that sticky.  You'd
 just peel it off again.

>chew gum
 When I made you try it before, you said that it tastes sort of like
 American bubble gum, only if one added soy sauce, pieces of pickled
 meat, and a bit of blood.

 And add to that now a strong mildew taste.  Yuck.  You gag and spit the
 gum back out.

>put gum on key
 Unfortunately, the gum's not that sticky.  You'd just peel it off
 again.

 Don't think you can stealthy-sniff and I won't notice.  You need to get
 over that perfume.

>put gum in nose
 You wouldn't be able to concentrate with the mildewy meat-gum smell.

>close nose
 That might block out Julia's maddening perfume for a few moments, but
 you can't hold your nose all afternoon.

>break frame
 You try to break the frame gently.  I fused the binder clip well,
 however, so you end up having to pull and twist to get it apart.  When
 you do, the front and back each break into several pieces, and so what
 is now on the desk along with the binder clip and photograph are some
 pitiful little plastic shards.

 Obviously I won't be able to repair it.

 I loved that frame.  I'm not sure what you are expecting me to say.
 Hooray?

 Remember when I handed you the itinerary last night?  Your response:
 "So I have tomorrow.  What do I need to do?"
>take clip

 "Please," I told you, "I don't want yet another promise."
 "I will write tomorrow. I will write every day until it is done."
 "You won't.  You'll have reasons, excuses.  Maybe more lies.  I can't
 believe you've been lying--"
 "Violet, I will write one thousand words tomorrow.  I will bring the
 pages to you as proof.  I will do this every day."

>put clip in pouch
 Then I covered my face with my hands because otherwise I wouldn't have
 been able to say it:
 "You won't.  I know you believe that you will.  But you won't actually
 do it."
 "Of course I will, Violet.  I have to."
 "And yet you won't.  That's how we're stuck.  I can't keep waiting and
 pretending. Every day? Budgie, you won't even do it tomorrow."
 "I will.  One thousand words.  Nothing will stop me."

 I need for you to write today.  I wish you could just sit and type.  I
 realise you can't.  Of course it hurts to watch you destroy things I
 spent days making for you.  But do whatever you must.  I don't want to
 leave you.

 Just because you are imagining me doesn't mean I'm a mindreader.

>put clip in pouch
 You need to be holding the binder clip before you can put it into
 something else.

 You start doing your Colin imitation.  "Why, Violet, as I was reading
 the proofs of my second book last night, I started thinking about that
 boyfriend of yours.  How is he?  Still fussing about not having a pen?"

>take clip
 Yours, jellysquish.

>put clip in pouch
 You put the binder clip into the rubber square's "pouch".

>put clip on nose
 (first taking the binder clip)
 You've put the binder clip on your nose.

>examine frame
>smell
 I don't see what you are talking about.

 You can't smell anything now that you've a binder clip on your nose, so
 you're liberated from Julia's perfume ruining your concentration.

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 Within three minutes you've taken the cable out of the cabinet and are
 watching a video of a dog dressed as a ballerina.  Oh, chutney.  If you
 can't be disciplined, then you'll have to be clever.

 You do unplug the cable again and lock it back in the cabinet.  Now,
 what to do with the key?

>undo
 Careful!  You know how you get nosebleeds.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>SAVE
>cf2
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>examine photo
 I've already described the photograph of me with the giant foam lobster
 on my head.  I am definitely worth a thousand words.

 Warren is playing from Listen, one of the few known albums in which a
 single artist plays guitar and accordion simultaneously.

>look
 I'm surprised you don't have any pictures from home up, but I can be
 especially sentimental since home for me involves crossing both the
 equator and International Date Line.

 You've a great big desk in front of a window, a resplendent yellow
 chair, a cabinet in one corner, a giant cactus in another, and a tall
 bookcase on the back wall with an incredibly cute stool.  The door is
 west.

 On the desk are some pitiful little plastic shards, a photograph, your
 computer, my itinerary and a pile you cannot even contemplate.  The
 bookcase holds a book.  A wastebasket is on the floor.

>examine shards
 The red and black plastic shards were once part of a frame I lovingly
 made for you, and before that they were part of a poster from the
 concert we attended on our first date.  Now they are useless.

>put gum on shards
 Putting things on the pitiful little plastic shards would achieve
 nothing.

>put gum on thread
 Putting things on the bit of lilac thread would achieve nothing.

>tie thread to key
 In Melbourne we had to be able to tie ten different kinds of knots in
 order to graduate from secondary school.  I'm not sure what would be
 accomplished by trying to tie the thread to the shiny little key,
 though.

 Warren is playing "Can Jimmy Do This?," which one music critic called
 "the most ambitious guitar solo ever by someone who had been playing
 the instrument for less than a week."

>examine itinerary
 A printout of an airline receipt for a certain Ms. Violet C., for a
 flight from Madison to Chicago to Los Angeles to Auckland to Melbourne.
 One-way, refundable.  Departing early tomorrow morning.

>read it
 A printout of an airline receipt for a certain Ms. Violet C., for a
 flight from Madison to Chicago to Los Angeles to Auckland to Melbourne.
 One-way, refundable.  Departing early tomorrow morning.

>read notebook
 This page has two drawings of your advisor.  On the left she looks
 enthusiastic; on the right, worried and disappointed.  The speech
 balloon on the left says "Think big!  I've never had a student with so
 much potential!"  The balloon on the right says, "THE BEST DISSERTATION
 IS A DONE DISSERTATION."

 Your advisor is nutty anyway.  I'm still angry about the time she made
 you catsit.

>put key under door
 You slide the key under the door.  It feels good to be rid of it.

 A few moments later you hear a noise and look down to see the key
 skidding back under your door.

>take key
 Yours, rockmelon.

 Warren is playing "An Inch Too Tall" from Not Exactly Fair To Them,
 recorded during the extended tour that followed Listen.

>break key
 It's a spunky little key.  You can't break it.

>examine pile
 The pile is such a reminder of the problems you've had being scattered
 that you cannot even contemplate it without feeling defeated.

 You can't without becoming a puddle.  This is what I'm saying.

>examine computer
 The PC is old but fine.  Applications include a word processor,
 browser, chat, and e-mail.

 Your computer is disconnected from the Internet.

>move bookcase
 It's bolted to the wall.

 You look up.  "Colin would never--"  ENOUGH.  Colin has no relevance to
 this whatsoever.

>examine desk
 It's an excellent desk, even if someone did keel over on it.  On top
 are some pitiful little plastic shards, a photograph, your computer, my
 itinerary and a pile you cannot even contemplate.

 The desk's drawer is empty.  A wastebasket is on the floor to the left.

>take drawer
 That seems to be a part of your desk.

>examine knob
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine mouse
 Frankly, chutney, you're in so much trouble if you break your computer
 that I'm not sure I want you mucking about with the peripherals.

>examine tot
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>search shards
 The red and black plastic shards were once part of a frame I lovingly
 made for you, and before that they were part of a poster from the
 concert we attended on our first date.  Now they are useless.

>take shards
 Yours, marble munch.

 Warren is playing "Hedge Clippers" from This Is What You Drove Me To,
 Mrs. Kinkle-Catkicker.

>lick gum
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>chew gum
 No way are you putting that back in your mouth.

>examine gum
 It's a slightly wet pink blob with little specks of brown.

>squeeze gum
 You achieve nothing by this.

>put gum on key
 Unfortunately, the gum's not that sticky.  You'd just peel it off
 again.

>inventory
 You're carrying some pitiful little plastic shards, a shiny little key,
 a pink sticky blob of bubble gum, a deftly-crafted snowglobe, a rubber
 square, a small chip, a bit of lilac thread, a lighter, an empty
 plastic bottle and a notebook, and you're wearing the platyPod.

 You also have a binder clip on your nose.

 Warren is playing "Bagel Slicer," in which his playing is spirited but
 clearly far below his usual skills.

>open snowglobe
 Of course you can't open the snowglobe.  I sealed it with industrial
 glue.

>put gum on chip
 Putting things on the small chip would achieve nothing.

>examine platypod
 Presumably it looks like a three-legged space creature is attacking
 your head.  Comfy, though.

>examine lighter
 The lighter is promoting some race car driver whose car is #67.  Our
 Number.

 I was tipsy at a party and you were one of four random dudes trying to
 talk to me at once.  I interrupted to tell my favourite joke.  "Why is
 six afraid of seven?"
 "Because seven eight--"
 "No!" I shouted, "Because seven [the sickest thing I could come up with
 at the moment] nine."

 The other men chuckled uncomfortably.  You laughed so hard you spit
 Guinness on my face.  That was when I decided I liked you.

>open lighter
 That's not something you can open.

 Warren is playing "Teeth," in which obviously substandard musicianship
 is accompanied by complaints about the difficulty playing with only one
 finger.

>pull pot
 I don't see what the purpose of doing that would be.

>push pot
 The pot is incredibly heavy and you cannot move it anywhere.

>dig pot
 This is perhaps not the best day to evince a new interest in gardening.

>examine cabinet
 It's University Drab, about a metre high with a silly fake wood front.
 It's closed and locked.

>examine front
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>open door
 You are going to open the door while your ex-girlfriend is hooking up
 with someone right across the hall?  And then what?  Do you really
 think that whatever happens is going to be something where you'll be
 able to write afterwards?  You need to stay here and focus.

>turn off light
 Done.  The room is much dimmer, with most of the light coming from the
 computer.

 You pause for a moment.  Your shoulders slump.  You say "Colin--," then
 stop.  You're thinking about the pen again, aren't you?

>look
 Here in your office, you have a huge desk, a gorgeous yellow chair, a
 cabinet, a giant cactus, a tall bookcase, and an incredibly cute stool.

 On the desk are a photograph, your computer, my itinerary and a pile
 you cannot even contemplate.  The bookcase contains a book.  A
 wastebasket is on the floor.

>turn on light
 Fine.  That's better than having the light only coming from the
 computer.

>stand on bookcase
 This is how office furniture at Wisconsin works: the bookcase is bolted
 to the wall, and yet the shelves are so rickety that I'm sure if you
 try to climb the bookcase, one of them will collapse and you'll sprain
 something.

>move stool to bookcase
 The stool is now back in its intended location by the bookcase.

>stand on stool
 The stool creaks once again as you climb onto it.

 Warren is playing "So I Lied (Pathetic, I Know)," from the compilation
 of songs he mailed to his manager at erratic intervals from different
 locations in the rural West.

>examine bookcase
 I think it was smart of you to take away your books, although of course
 now the bookcase does look dreary.

 On the second shelf is a book.

>examine whatever
 (first getting off the stool)
 It's broken now.

>examine blind
 As I've already said, I wish the blind was more colourful.  I also wish
 it wasn't stuck halfway down the window.

>examine sill
 The sill is behind and slightly below the desk.  It's painted white.

 On the sill is a crumply sign.

>roll gum
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>mold gum
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>reshape gum
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>search pipe
 The garish chrome pipe was obviously added sometime after the building
 was built, in response to some amendment to the fire code.  It is flush
 against the wall and runs all the way up to a sprinkler that is only a
 few inches from the ceiling.

 Warren is playing "Your Cult Sounds Pretty Cool," his last known
 recording.

>open window
 For a graduate student like yourself, having an office with a window
 and a great view is almost too much to hope for.  A window that
 actually opens is, in fact, too much to hope for.

>keyhole
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>examine keyhole
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>eat key
 Not to suggest you're wimpy, but I could swallow that key if I had to.
 I don't know if you are too squeamish or what.  You gag wildly and
 cough up the key almost immediately.

>put gum on key
 Unfortunately, the gum's not that sticky.  You'd just peel it off
 again.

>eat key
 It's not going to work, sticky pudding.  You are lucky you didn't vomit
 the last time.

>open gum
 That's not something you can open.

 Warren Tim Harried is playing "Please Don't (My Grandma Gave Me That)"
 from Runt with an Accordion, recorded when he was fourteen years old.

>examine wastebasket
 It's the standard issue University Dreary metal wastebasket.

>look in it
 It's the standard issue University Dreary metal wastebasket.

>look under desk
 Underneath your desk is a portal to an enchanted realm about to be
 destroyed by an evil sorcerer who can only by stopped by you--you, the
 lost prince, possessor of hitherto untapped wizarding powers that are
 your sacred birthright.

 Plus, if you succeed, a team of faerie elves will write your
 dissertation for you.

>examine realm
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine portal
 I wish there really was a portal.  Faerie elves rock.

 Okay.  You should go back to trying to write.

>move stool to door
 The stool is now by the door.

 You pause and look wallowy.  You slouch.  It's just a pen.  Please.

>stand on stool
 The stool creaks once again as you climb onto it.

>examine vent
 The vent has a square metal grill.  You try to look into the vent but
 it's dark and you are still maybe 30 centimetres or more below it.  You
 won't be able to see into the vent from here.

>light lighter
 The lighter ultimately doesn't work well, just flickering enough that
 you can maybe BURN something.  (Burning things!  Yay!)  You wouldn't be
 able to use it as a source of illumination.

>burn cactus
 (first getting off the stool)
 When my brother did his year abroad in the US, it was at a place called
 the Burning Cactus ranch.  Did I ever tell you that?  I guess I
 must've.  Anyway, it would be fabulous to set the cactus on fire, but
 you don't seem to be able to manage it with the lighter.

>burn snowglobe
 I don't see how you'd be able to burn that.

 Warren is playing "Someday They'll Go Too Far," which became a hit on
 local pirate radio stations after being discovered by school
 authorities and played on the evening news.

>examine stool
 Remember?  Me, looking triumphant as I haul the flimsy stool into our
 apartment:
 "Look what I found in the dumpster!  Just what you need!"
 "Do you think it will collapse if I stand on it?"
 "Not immediately.  Just be careful."
 "I can't believe the secretary said I was 'undeserving' when I asked if
 I could have a stool."
 "This stool is better, anyway.  Maybe I'll paint it!"

>look under desk
 OK.  I'm done with this.  There's actually nothing under your desk.

>look under desk
 There's nothing under your desk.

>examine finneal
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine photo
 I've already described the photograph of me with the giant foam lobster
 on my head.  I am definitely worth a thousand words.

>turn photo over
 I understand neither what you are wanting to do nor why.

 Warren is playing "No Normal Boy Would Write That Song," recorded
 during a weekend furlough from a private psychiatric facility for
 troubled adolescent boys.

>examine plastic
 The red and black plastic shards were once part of a frame I lovingly
 made for you, and before that they were part of a poster from the
 concert we attended on our first date.  Now they are useless.

>examine laminate
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>examine dissertation
 You've made some really handsome margin and font choices already for
 your dissertation, wallaroo.  Now all you need is text.

>examine me
 You look tired, which is understandable given the length of our
 "discussion" last night.

 You're carrying some pitiful little plastic shards, a shiny little key,
 a pink sticky blob of bubble gum, a deftly-crafted snowglobe, a rubber
 square, a small chip, a bit of lilac thread, a lighter, an empty
 plastic bottle and a notebook, and you're wearing the platyPod.

 You also have a binder clip on your nose.

>put key in bottle
 I'm not sure what that would accomplish.  If you put the key in the
 bottle, you'll just be able to get it back out again.

>burn bottle
 I don't see how you'd be able to burn that.

 Warren is playing "My Lonesome Pain is Not A Polka" from We Paid You
 For Happy, the artistic breakthrough composed while he supported
 himself with gigs at family reunions and retirement centres.

>melt bottle
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>burn gum
 I don't see how you'd be able to burn that.

>examine notebook
 It's a smallish notebook, about 10x15 centimetres.  As you're holding
 it now, the cover features Professor Detective telling Undergraduate
 Constable Duffy, "In both my vocations, intelligence means little
 without DISCIPLINE."

>discipline me
 You're going to have to use a different verb for me to understand what
 you mean.

>read notebook
 On the top half of this page are a few beginnings of sentences, all
 crossed out.  On the bottom you've written:

     lazy    lazy lazy
       lazy lazy
   lazy    lazy    lazy
         lazy   lazy

 Wallaroo.  You are not lazy.

         FAILURE

 You are such a drama queen.  We are going to get your dissertation
 unstuck today.  You'll wish you'd thought to bring me along sooner.

>read notebook
 The remaining pages of the notebook are blank.

 You pause and look morose.  You do the thing where you put your hands
 on your temples and start tugging your hair.  Please forget about the
 pen.

>burn notebook
 Given your conviction that you must have a pen and notebook handy in
 order to write on your computer, you'd better not.

>break window
 It's hard for me to see what purpose breaking your window would serve.
 More importantly, someone would almost certainly see and call campus
 security, and that will introduce new hassles to your afternoon and
 prevent you from getting any writing done.

>break key
 It's a spunky little key.  You can't break it.

>break stool
 Why would you do that?  Besides my having painted the stool so lovely
 for you, you wouldn't be able to get to anything on top of the bookcase
 anymore.

>break snowglobe
 Ugh.  Okay.  You break the snowglobe against the pipe.  You pick up the
 figurine and the base, the latter of which you realise now was just a
 coaster I took from the kitchen.  You leave the broken glass on the
 floor.

 I can make another snowglobe easy enough.  The figurine is intact, and
 that's the part that took more than two days.

 Warren is playing from Drumsticks, the bootleg album recorded during a
 performance at a family fried chicken restaurant.

>examine coaster
 It's a University of Wisconsin coaster, with a photo of the mascot
 Bucky Badger on the front.  Bucky's beady eyes never fail to creep me
 out.

>put coaster in pouch
 The coaster is too big to fit in the pouch.

>examine figurine
 Luckily he's not damaged.  He looks smaller outside the globe.  I don't
 know if I will want to make another snowglobe or do something
 different.

>put figurine in pouch
 Done.  I'm not sure I like this.

>shoot pen
 The Saskastoon Strangler sails through the air and hits the pen
 headfirst, knocking it loose.  The pen falls to the floor. The figurine
 careens ahead into the wall and shatters.

 Unbelievable.  Un-be-[bother]ing-lievable.

 Remember?  That night sitting on the swings, shortly after we started
 dating?  I was emphatic that we had to end this before we got serious.
 "But, Violet," you said, "I'm already serious."
 "Coming to Wisconsin was supposed to be a great adventure.  I didn't
 know it was so cold.  I thought Madison was bigger.  I miss my family.
 My friends are all leaving when they finish their MFAs.  Mine is
 already done.  We only have a future if I stay.  And if I stay, I would
 just be waiting."

 We had that conversation the day after you turned 28, because I was
 determined to break up with you and thought only a cretin would dump
 someone on their birthday.

 You convinced me to stay.  You said you would be done in a year, a year
 and a half at the most.   Instead: two years now.  Two years.  And this
 is what you need to do because you can't just sit your [bother] down
 and write?

 I know you aren't doing this to hurt me.  I'll try go back to being
 Your Upbeat Aussie Girlfriend.  But, honestly: what am I supposed to
 think here?  How am I supposed to feel?

>take pen
 Yours, weet-bix.

 Warren is playing "You With the Notepad," the stunning and entirely
 improvised final track done without once breaking eye contact with a
 woman later identified as Francine Kinkle, music editor for a local
 college newspaper.

>read pen
 I cannot be blamed for Marty leaving you a pen with "You do not deserve
 Violet" etched on the side.

>examine sprinkler
 It looks like an ordinary sprinkler.  Nothing intriguing about it.

>SAVE
>cf3

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 Within three minutes you've taken the cable out of the cabinet and are
 watching a video of a dog dressed as a ballerina.  Oh, dundeecake.  If
 you can't be disciplined, then you'll have to be clever.

 You do unplug the cable again and lock it back in the cabinet.  Now,
 what to do with the key?

>inventory
 You're carrying a shiny little key, a pen, a coaster, some pitiful
 little plastic shards, a pink sticky blob of bubble gum, a rubber
 square, a small chip, a bit of lilac thread, a lighter, an empty
 plastic bottle and a notebook, and you're wearing the platyPod.

 You also have a binder clip on your nose.

>burn shards
 I don't see how you'd be able to burn that.

>eat key
 It's not going to work, berry smush.  You are lucky you didn't vomit
 the last time.

 Warren is playing the title track from Francine.  (Actually, all 37
 songs on the album are officially titled "Francine.")

>put key under door
 A few moments later someone has slid the key back into your office.

>take key
 Yours, wallaroo.

>examine drain
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>put gum on thread
 Putting things on the bit of lilac thread would achieve nothing.

>put key in pouch
 You put the shiny little key into the rubber square's "pouch".

>put pouch under door
 I don't really see what that would accomplish, dundeecake.

>take key
 Yours, wallaroo.

 Warren is playing the song unofficially titled "Parking Garage,"
 following the convention of identifying tracks on Francine by the
 location of the tryst the liner notes say inspired them.

>put key on cactus
 Putting things on the giant cactus would achieve nothing.

>put key in pot
 That won't work.  You would just fish it out again later, dundeecake.

>put key in computer
 That isn't a container, wallaroo.  Unless I'm misunderstanding what you
 are trying to do.

>unscrew pen
 Nothing obvious happens.

>examine pen
 With its cap on it looks like a bright lavender tube.  Crudely etched
 on the side is a message:

 You do not deserve Violet

 Eek.  Apparently Marty had it for me worse than I realised.

>remove cap
 When you take off the cap, purple gunk sprays out of it and all over
 your clothes.  Marty!

 I don't know how he rigged that.  I also don't know why men conclude
 that the best way of expressing anguish over me is through some display
 of mechanical cleverness.  Remember Colin and the 50-foot aluminium
 peacock?

 The pen itself actually works.  Of course, your clothes are ruined.
 Worse, you are starting to itch.

 Warren is playing "Booth Seven at Steak'n'Shake," the track on Francine
 that got him tour dates opening for ironic death metal icon Jimmy
 Catkicker.

>examine clothes
 I don't know what the purple gunk is, but it's certainly making you
 itch.

 You are itchy.

>remove clothes
 You place your clothes neatly next to the cactus.

 So now you're standing in your office naked, with a red binder clip on
 your nose and what looks like a furry three-legged space creature on
 your head.

 You are ready to write now.  I can feel it.

>examine cap
 It's a completely ordinary pen cap.  I still don't understand how Marty
 rigged it to squirt that purple gunk.

>find handcuffs
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>examine tattoo
 "TYVTWD" in red marker on the back of your right hand.

>examine birthmark
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>throw key at sprinkler
 There's no point to doing that now that the pen is no longer wedged
 above the sprinkler.

>throw key at light
 I don't see what that would accomplish.  Please just write.

 Warren is playing from his follow-up album to Francine, which was also
 titled Francine.

>put key on light
 Putting things on the fluorescent light would achieve nothing.

>put key on whatever
 Putting things on the whatever would achieve nothing.

>put key on bind
 I don't see what you are talking about.

>put key on blind
 Putting things on the blind would achieve nothing.

>look
 Here in your office, you have a huge desk, a resplendent yellow chair,
 a cabinet, a giant cactus, a tall bookcase, and an incredibly cute
 stool.

 On the desk are a photograph, your computer, my itinerary and a pile
 you cannot even contemplate.  The bookcase holds a book.  In addition,
 on the floor are your clothes, fake snow and a wastebasket.

>put key on top of bookcase
 The bookcase is too tall for you to put anything on top of it unless
 you are standing on the stool.

>move stool to bookcase
 The stool is now back in its intended location by the bookcase.

 Warren is playing excerpts from "Why?," originally an eighty-three
 minute song in which he stops playing once to cry and twice to leave
 voicemails for Francine.

>stand on bookcase
 This is how office furniture at Wisconsin works: the bookcase is bolted
 to the wall, and yet the shelves are so rickety that I'm sure if you
 try to climb the bookcase, one of them will collapse and you'll sprain
 something.

>put key on top of bookcase
 The bookcase is too tall for you to put anything on top of it unless
 you are standing on the stool.

>stand on stool
 The stool creaks once again as you climb onto it.

>put key on top of bookcase
 Curious, dundeecake.  Done.

>stand
 You are already on the stool.

>get off stool
 You get off the stool.

 Warren is playing "It's Because He Plays Guitar, Isn't it?"

>break stool
 Gently, but irreparably, you break the stool.

 I know it was practically broken already, but I loved that stool.  I
 know I said to do "whatever you must."  It still hurts to watch what
 that "must" is taking from us.

 Ultimately, yes, I understand.  Then again, I'm speaking just as your
 imaginary rendition of me.  Actual-Me was already fed up enough to buy
 a plane ticket; I'm not sure how you expect to explain this.

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 You try again.  Within a few seconds you start wondering what the fear
 of writing is called.  Scribophobia?  Graphophobia?  You go to look it
 up online.  You can't.  You itch to check your e-mail.  You can't.

 So you start thinking about Chapter 3 again.  Woo-woo!   The train of
 ideas is finally pulling into keyboard station.  I can see the first
 sentence now.

 But the music is so loud that it spoils your concentration and
 everything derails.  Ugh.  It's like trying to write while sitting next
 to the amps at a concert.   I didn't think I could possibly hate Julia
 any worse than after she posted my cell phone # on those marsupial
 fetish listservs.  You cannot let her win.

>raise right eyebrow
 The platyPod clicks and the oz-hop you fail to properly appreciate
 resumes.

>write
 The volume on the platyPod is too loud for you to concentrate.

 Not to be morbid, but it's too bad you aren't a bit hard of hearing.
 Then the platyPod could block out the remaining noise without being too
 loud.

>jiggle head clockwise
 You move your head in adorable little clockwise circles.  TOO LOUD!
 TOO LOUD!  You jiggle your head anticlockwise to turn it back down.

 You glance over to the book.  You're fidgeting.  You know you've
 already more than enough ideas for a first draft.  Just put the book
 out of your mind today.

>burn book
 (standing up first)
 Gee, budgie.  Far be it from me to be the moral conscience when fire is
 involved, but that's a library book.  There's bound to be a hefty fine.
 And it seems a little insane.  If you really want to, we can, but it
 shouldn't be a rash decision.

>burn book
 (first taking the book)
 I was secretly hoping you would.  You light the book on fire and it
 burns magnificently!  Yay!  That was epic to watch, and now we don't
 have to deal with you being tempted anymore to read.

 The coughing and light smoke damage are well worth it.   I'll go
 halfsies on the library fine.

 As for the sprinkler: nothing.  Not one drop.  Don't even pretend to be
 surprised to learn that the University gives graduate students offices
 in a death-trap.

>write
 (first sitting on chair)
 The volume on the platyPod is too loud for you to concentrate.

>jiggle head counterclockwise
 You move your head in jaunty little anticlockwise circles. The volume
 is not loud.  You can still sometimes hear Julia and Historic Pfister
 across the hall.  (Hopefully the platyPod 2.0 will allow more precise
 volume control.)

>write
 You're ready to write.  Except now you are looking at the door.  True,
 you can still sometimes hear Julia and Historic Pfister across the
 hall.  The noise not loud enough as to normally be a distraction, but I
 can understand that your ex-girlfriend and some dork hooking up is not
 "normally."

>put gum in ears
 You can't put anything in your ears so long as you are wearing the
 platyPod.

 You are distracted by Historic Pfister's shrieking attempts to summon a
 deity.

>remove platypod
 The platyPod automatically turns off when you remove it.

>put gum in ears
 You are marvellous.  The gum does not block out all sound, but some.
 You can still hear Julia and Historic Pfister when they are being
 especially loud.

>wear platypod
 The platyPod still fits well, as the earpieces nestle nicely into the
 gum.  The platyPod is switched off.

>scrunch brow
 My voice: "Look, it even lets you record a start-up message!  How the
 platyPod works: You cycle through the different playlists by RAISING
 your left or right eyebrow.   NOD to skip to the next track.  JIGGLE
 your head clockwise to turn the volume up, and jiggle it anticlockwise
 to turn it down."

 The platyPod turns on.  The platyPod clicks and the oz-hop you fail to
 properly appreciate resumes.

 The volume is on low, and it's even lower with the gum in your ears.
 Nonetheless, you can still sometimes faintly hear Julia and Historic
 Pfister across the hall.

>jiggle head clockwise
 You move your head in endearing little clockwise circles.  The volume
 is still not that loud given the gum in your ears, but you can no
 longer hear Julia and Historic Pfister at all.  Hee.  Take that, Julia!

>write
 You try again.  But then you hear MC Dingo rhyme "casino" and "albino"
 and it breaks your concentration entirely.  When I put oz-hop on your
 platyPod, I wasn't really thinking of it as writing music.

 MC Dingo contends that you're not a real gangsta unless you come from a
 country originally founded as a gangsta colony.

>raise left eyebrow
 The platyPod clicks and Warren is kicking [bother] on his accordion
 again.

>write
 You try again.  But then you start doing air accordion to Warren Tim
 Harried.  I'm not sure how easy it is going to be able for you to write
 while the most compelling musician ever is playing.

>raise left eyebrow
 The platyPod clicks and the nondescript melodies of Primrose Meanwell
 begin once more.

>write
 You write two more sentences.  I can tell you're feeling more
 confident.  I knew you could do this.  You conclude the first paragraph
 with an especially provocative participle.  Then you hit enter and
 realise:

 You have to pee.

 Unbelievable.  This must be an anxiety thing.  You are killing me.

>SAVE
>cf4
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>pee in bottle
 You do.  Obviously I didn't watch.  I'm disgusted but proud of your
 perseverance.

>write
 You write a second paragraph.  Then a third.  You're past a thousand
 words within a few hours.  You decide you want to finish the entire
 section.  You do.  Not your best prose, but that isn't the point.
 Julia and the zombies have long gone when you finish, which you are
 thankful for when you need to run naked out to the car.

 You rehearse what you want to tell me all the way home.  Instead,
 there's a note on the door:

    Gone.  Sorry.

    Violet

 You had to have known I was going to leave you anyway.  All the clues
 were there.

 "SURPRISE!" thirty people jump up and shout when you open the door.
 Good thing you were covering your [bother] with the pages you wrote.

 One hour and three drinks later, you aren't even that embarrassed.  I
 pull you into the kitchen and kiss you.

 "You said you wanted something twisted for your birthday."
 "I was thinking more along the lines of you in peculiar lingerie."
 "I spent much of today hyperventilating thinking it was too cruel."
 "I figured out some important things today.  So, at worst, it was an
 extremely instructive cruel."
 "I'll still understand if you're angry."
 "You're the one who's going to be angry.  I have to tell you something
 about the snowglobe.  And the origami trophy.  And--"

 I put my hand on your chest to stop you.  "I've a confession that
 supersedes yours."

 I open up my laptop and show you.  On my screen is your office, as seen
 from the vent above the door.

 Of course you're bewildered.  I explain: "When I was hiding your
 birthday present, I rigged a camera up there.  Not to spy!  Or, not to
 spy like that. I needed to know when you were coming home for the
 party.  I thought it would just be you at your computer.  I didn't know
 you'd end up naked and peeing in a soda bottle."

 "I spent the entire day imagining that you were watching me," you say.
 "Maybe it only worked because you actually were."
 "Watching you break everything was maddening," I tell you, "but I'm
 still here.  I understand, even.  Sort of.  So long as you understand
 that you're only getting store-bought presents for a while."

 We've reached the hard part.  "I'm committed to this, budgie.  But I
 don't know what we're going to do with you."
 "No, Violet.  What are we going to do with you?  My turn is done.  It's
 the only fair thing."
 "You've been miserable.  You'll be happier this way."
 "I'm already happier.  Today made it so clear.  This is not what I'm
 meant to be doing with my life.  I know, I've spent six years in
 graduate school, I should be crying right now.  Instead I feel
 wonderful.  I love you so much."

 Me too, wallaroo.

 Three weeks later we are holding hands in the supereconomy section of a
 flight to Australia.  My brother is lending me money to open a
 curiosities shop.  He's found you a job at a comic book shop until you
 decide what's next.

 * * *

 I know it's not precisely Plan A, but we are happy and unstuck.  This
 is winning.  What now?  I understand if you just want to QUIT now that
 the merry glow of victory is upon us.  But you can also UNDO the last
 turn, RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or (bonus!) view some of the
 so-called AMUSING things you might've missed.


>amusing
 Apparently a tradition in these games is that a victorious player is
 allowed to view a list of humorous things they may've missed on the
 path to triumph.  While I remain nonplussed that a stranger has turned
 one of the more emotionally complicated days of my romantic life into a
 "text adventure" game, I've resolved to be a sport about it.
 Forthwith, then, let me review some possibly-overlooked highlights of
 our neuroses:

 1.  ABOUT, CREDITS, and COPYRIGHT were also written by Actual Me.

 2.  On your computer, you can OPEN BROWSER (multiple times), OPEN
 E-MAIL (ditto), and OPEN CHAT (eek).

 3.  Various commands commonly implemented in other games have their own
 responses here, including QUIT, BUY (something), SING, SCORE, SECRETS,
 TOPICS, TIME, SORRY, NORMAL, SHORT, VERBOSE, THINK ABOUT something,
 REMEMBER, CRY, WAVE, and the traditional magic word XYZZY.

 4.  After you SHAKE THE GLOBE, EXAMINE IT for a few successive turns
 and/or EXAMINE THE FIGURINE.

 5.  Some things you may have missed examining along the way: ME, JULIA
 (once she's around), LIQUID, GUNK, THREAD (then take something), GUM a
 second time, ZOMBIE (couple of times), PIRATE, CEILING, WALL, and
 FLOOR.  Also, the notebook has several pages to READ and its lenticular
 cover changes messages when you examine it.

 6.  Some of the ways to achieve less happy endings to the game are to
 BURN PILE, insist on trying to OPEN DOOR once Julia is around, MOVE
 STOOL TO CORNER and STAND ON STOOL, MAKE LOVE TO JULIA, either EXAMINE
 BOOK too many times or carry the book too many turns, and THROW
 WASTEBASKET AT PEN.

 7.  Much miscellany, a few examples of which are LOOK UNDER DESK,
 SWALLOW GUM and KEY, DELETE BROWSER or CHAT, BURN
 COASTER/PLATYPOD/CACTUS, PUT SQUARE IN POUCH, OPEN VENT, ASK VIOLET
 ABOUT SOMETHING, PUT KEY IN PILE (after cable is in cabinet), RIP
 CABLE, do anything to the JACK, PUT things in NOSE, KICK something,
 CLIMB BOOKCASE, TAKE VIOLET, and SLIDE KEY UNDER DOOR.

 8.  As (bonus!) easter eggs, WARREN EGG presents all the Warren Tim
 Harried tracks, JULIA EGG presents all the main events across the hall,
 and PETNAME EGG greets you with one of my petnames.

 I'm debuting a new line of stainless steel numbats at the shop and
 won't keep prattling.  My husband has sworn off the Internet and so
 can't type this himself, but he wanted me to tell you hello and that,
 even though he's sometimes wistful about not finishing his Ph.D., it
 was plainly for the best.

 Epilogically yours,
 Violet

 Now what, wallaroo?  Shall we UNDO, RESTART, RESTORE, or just QUIT?

>julia egg
 1.  Somebody is coming up the stairs.  I thought you said no one ever
 comes in on the weekend?

 2.  Two voices in the hallway: a man and Julia.  Julia hasn't been in
 her office in weeks.  She shows up on a Saturday?

 3.  Julia is here to sabotage you.  I'm sure of it.  She's in her
 office across the hall now, talking loudly with her door open.

 4.  The dude with Julia sounds like the one she was flirting with at
 Lucy's party.  Remember?  He was scrawny and said his parents owned a
 hotel in Milwaukee called "The Historic Pfister."

 5.  I don't know why I confided in Lucy about our problems.  I should
 have known she would tell Julia.

 6.  You are distracted by Julia laughing inauthentically and telling
 Historic Pfister "You are so clever."

 7.  You are distracted by Julia talking about her abs.

 8.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly "...You could
 use mine to calculate pi..."*

 9.  You are distracted by Julia going on loudly about how you get a
 discount if you get both tongue piercings at the same time.

 10.  You are distracted by Julia talking about her [bother].  I can't
 believe you dated someone so crass.

 11.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Impressive,
 huh?  When I was in high school my guidance counsellor recommended that
 I become a contortionist."

 12.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "It's not so
 much that I'm double jointed as just very determined."

 13.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Sure, she's
 cute.  If you can get past the mole."

 Hey!  Watch it, Julia.

 14.  You are distracted by Julia saying "She makes things that look
 like summer camp crafts and tries to convince people they're art."

 I wonder if I'd get away with it if I killed her right before my flight
 leaves tomorrow morning.

 15.  You are distracted by Julia loudly saying "I bet when they first
 hooked up, she was like, 'Would you like to see my didgeridoo?'"  (That
 has to be the most gallingly inept fake Australian accent I have ever
 heard.  She sounds like a Norwegian parakeet.)

 16.  You are distracted by Julia laughing and mock-shrieking "Or maybe,
 'Touch my kiwi!  Touch my kiwi!'"  Ugh.  How can someone almost have
 her Ph.D. and not know that kiwis are New Zealand, not Australia?

 17.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "You've been
 working out.  I've noticed."

 Oh no.

 18.  You are distracted by Julia squealing, "Wait, it's your birthday,
 too?  Why didn't you tell me earlier?"

 19.  You are distracted by a startled grunt from Historic Pfister.  I
 do not believe this is happening.

 20.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making noises perhaps best
 characterised as mewling.

 21.  You are distracted by Julia saying, "Wait, if today is the 24th,
 and you are 24, that makes this your golden birthday."  Well, then.

 22.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister's shrieking attempts to
 summon a deity.

 23.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister saying excitedly, "Okay,
 now you're a princess, and I'm a ninja!"

 24.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making a noise that doesn't
 sound very much like a ninja, unless there is an order of yodelling
 ninja I don't know about.

 25.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making contented little
 yelping sounds.

 You have to pee.

>about
 I get sloshed at a dinner party and tell the story, and a few months
 later I receive an e-mail from a man I don't remember announcing that
 I'm a "game."  I suppose I should be flattered.

 Or perhaps you should be flattered.  You are the one who gets to
 pretend to be my boyfriend.

 We proceed by you typing what you want to do.  Don't get cute: type a
 verb, or a verb and noun, or maybe verb-noun-preposition-noun.  The
 following are examples of things you can do:

 WRITE
 EXAMINE DESK (or X DESK)
 TAKE ITINERARY
 OPEN DRAWER
 STAND ON CHAIR
 LOOK UNDER DESK
 PUT ITINERARY ON CABINET

 I'll report what happens, and we go from there.  You can probably trip
 me up if you try to be an arse about it, but what's the fun of that?

 You can see an inventory of what you are holding at any time by typing
 I or EXAMINE ME (X ME).  If you want a summary description of the room
 you're in, just LOOK.

 You can save the game by typing SAVE, and restore a saved game by
 typing RESTORE.  I'll be desolate if you QUIT.

 What else?  CREDITS and COPYRIGHT are available whenever.  If you're
 ever stuck, I can give you a HINT.   If you want to take back your last
 action, UNDO bends space-time to your regretful will.

 Finally: you are male by default (curse you, patriarchy!).  I'm not
 changing my gender on your behalf, but you are welcome to change yours.
 Just type FEMALE or, more stylishly, HETERONORMATIVITY OFF.

 I would wish you luck, but you don't need luck.  You just need to
 write.

 Virtually yours,
 Violet

 I suspect that's a fair bit more difficult to program.

 I know at the beginning it says "by Jeremy Freese," which I would
 deeply resent if me "being a game" wasn't already so absurd.  I will
 try to not dwell further on his creepy expropriation of me. I cannot,
 however, sit quiet while the many others who helped Freese go
 egregiously unacknowledged.

>push space
 For starters:
 I wouldn't have my very own all-text adaptation if not for Inform 7, by
 Graham Nelson, Emily Short, and colleagues.  Freese also leeched off I7
 extensions written by Emily Short, David Fisher, and Jon Ingold.
 Freese pestered readers of rec.arts.int-fiction for aid, and among
 those who helped were J.D. Clemens, Eric Eve, Jesse McGrew, Peter
 Pears, Andrew Plotkin, Emily Short, and (especially) Mike Tarbert.
 Freese badgered others into beta testing, including Gemma Bristow,
 Corey Colyer, James Cunningham, Benji Dahood, Molly Geene, Dan
 Hirschman, Javri, Tiffany Julian, Sarah Morayati, Carl Muckenhoupt,
 Lucy Pigpuppet, Reiko, Thomas Say, Stephan Schonberg, and Ramona White.
 Eric Dean Freese made cover art.

>push space
 Worst of all:
 Freese used R. C. M. so thoroughly in creating this that he's an
 absolute [bother] for not dedicating the whole thing to her.

 Annoyedly yours,
 Violet

 You get a "Server Not Found" message.  See!  Disconnecting yourself
 from the Internet was a good idea!

 Primrose sings about how the idea of living with eight housemates
 sounded like fun but she actually spends most weekends hiding from them
 in her room.  You pay no attention.

 You have to pee.
