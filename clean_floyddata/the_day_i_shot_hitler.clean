 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








  Dear Blogreaders,
  yesterday was the strangest day of my life! The things I have seen -
 and done - it was so strange...so horrible. And yet, wonderful. You
 remember that guy from the Psychology course? Paul? We had a date the
 day before yesterday. Some people already emailed me with questions
 regarding how it went. But sorry, especially to you, Toby43, but I was
 to tired, and, honestly, to drunk to go online that night. I'll skip
 that part, maybe I'll write about it later, because I have to tell you
 what went down this night. Paul was throwing this big New-Years-Eve
 party and he invited me (of course, I may add with what little
 self-esteem I have), to help him organize - and stay overnight.
  That's how it all started. I arrived in the midst of the party,
 because I was visiting my family before that. So when I went in the
 door, Paul rushed at me. I couldn't have anticipated what happened
 next, that this would turn into...

 The Day I shot Hitler
 An interactive Party by Taleslinger
 Release 1 / Serial number 071229 / Inform 7 build 5J39 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/11N)

 Paul, his brown hair in a cute pony-tail, rushes at you, a huge bowl of
 eggnog in his hand. He told you yesterday that he prepared it carefully
 after some old family recipe. He looks at you in utter horror,
 squeaking: "Mice."
 "Of me to drop by?"
 "No, Mice. They were in the house yesterday, and now one is in my
 eggnog." His voice is but a whisper.
 "Hm, throw it away?" you suggest carefully.
 "No, Alex, everyone is waiting for it. Also, the noodles haven't
 arrived yet and the sandwiches are disappearing rapidly.So people need
 something to feed on."
 Right at that moment, the head of a small mouse pokes out of the
 liquid. The little bugger looks around, then begins to swim around
 quite happily.
 "Get rid of these foul vermin! Save my eggnog."
 You both look down on the swimming mouse. "And please don't hurt the
 poor little creature." With that, Paul disappears into the living room,
 leaving the bowl in your hands.

 hallway
 A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of neon lights. Dark wooden
 stairs lead upwards, and a doorframe opens west into the Living Room. A
 small door under the stairs lead into a storage closet. (Referred to by
 Paul only as "The Potter Room".)
 Your steps don't make any sound on the the thick, red carpet.

 You can see a chest of drawers (closed) here.

 An Uzi. Like in the movies. Paul told you it belonged to his
 grandfather, who was a bit on the funny side, and he tended to displace
 his magazine. Paul also told you that the thing is quite old and
 useless - it's set to Automatic fire and will stay that way.
 The magazine shaft is empty.

 Living Room
 Before the party people invaded it, this was a spacious, cozy room.
 Now, you have to wade through thick smoke to escape either eastwards to
 the hallway or to the Kitchen and the Pool beyond to the South.

 Some people sit on the two comfortable couches, sharing joints and
 talking about sickness and death, everybody trying to outdo one another
 in morbidity.

 Between the two couches is a huge heap of purses and backpacks.

>search heap
 Some of the people protest, in throaty voices: "No, man, leave our
 things alone." or "Chill out, man, that doesn't belong to you." Good
 karma pothead stuff like that.

>examine people
 Some people sit on the two comfortable couches, sharing joints and
 talking about some new remake and why it will suck.

>examine couches
 You see nothing special about the couch.

>look under couch
 You find an mag for an Uzi, which you pocket. You never know when stuff
 like that comes in handy.

 Grinning like the Doomguy, you slid the magazine into the Uzi, where it
 rests with an assuring *click.*

 Kitchen
 The main feature of this room is the impressive glass door, which leads
 south, to the pool. All benches and counters are weighted down with
 random food stuff, brought by the party goers. Of course, there are
 more people here than in the living room.

 People stand around, glasses or plates in hand, happily munching and
 talking.

 On the counter next to the sink sits Paul's laptop, connected to some
 small speakers, providing music.
 Right now, it's playing: "The Saga begins" by Weird Al Yankovic.

 Garden Area
 Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small pool. It's surrounded by
 some deck-chairs. The eastern and western garden walls are overgrown
 with undergrowth, so as to hide the family members going for a seamelss
 tan. This wasn't necessary for the southern wall, wich is quite high,
 because it borders on a Golf course (Pauls told you they find the
 occasional golf ball in the pool nonetheless.)

 A small flock of people is lying around in the deck-chairs, most of
 them still dressed, waving drinks and mumbling to each other in the
 afternoon glow.

 You fight your way through the bushes.

  You are somewhere in the undergrowth, the sounds of the party lost

 Suddenly, Paul appears besides you. He graps the eggnog and gently
 kisses your chin, sending goose-bumps down your arms. "Thanks, Alex -
 you're a nice guy. Care to dance?" With that, he takes you to Kitchen,
 where you dance rather akwardly to  "Umbrella" by Rihanna.
 . But your dancing is interrupted as Paul shoots more and more nervous
 glances at the buffet.
  "What is it?"
 "Alex, we're running low on food - these people simply eat to fast! I
 ordered a huge package of noodles and have no idea why it wasn't
 delivered today. Anyway, we're stuck with a bunch of sandwiches, which
 disappear as we speak." "Hey" you say "aren't your college types into
 resolutions and stuff like that?"
 "What the hell?"
 You eye the laptop. "Write a resolution to lazily masticate all
 sandwiches. That'll slow them down till we figure out the noodle
 problem."
 Paul stares at you in wonder."Why haven't I met you 10 years ago?"
 "Because I was in jail. Listen, hook up a printer and get ready to
 go..."
 "Can't do that. I have a printer upstairs, but no paper."
 "Leave that to me" you say, smiling confidently, and Paul disappears
 upstairs."

 Now, you have to wade through thick smoke to escape either eastwards to
 the hallway or to the Kitchen and the Pool beyond to the South.

 Some people sit on the two comfortable couches, sharing joints and
 talking about their World of Warcraft characters.

 Between the two couches is a huge heap of purses and backpacks.

>ask people about paper
 You have to save this party before you can participate in the idle
 chat.

>go east

 hallway
 A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of neon lights. Dark wooden
 stairs lead upwards, and a doorframe opens west into the Living Room. A
 small door under the stairs lead into a storage closet. (Referred to by
 Paul only as "The Potter Room".)
 Your steps don't make any sound on the the thick, red carpet.

 You can see a chest of drawers (in which is a thing Pauls aunt gave her
 which he doesn't know what it is) here.

>go up
 Paul has forbidden any entrance for either you or anyone else to the
 rest of the House for the night. Aside from a a seductive "Maybe later,
 when we're alone", that is.

 Between the two couches is a huge heap of purses and backpacks.

>search heap
 Some of the people protest, in throaty voices: "No, man, leave our

 Kitchen
 The main feature of this room is the impressive glass door, which leads
 south, to the pool. All benches and counters are weighted down with
 random food stuff, brought by the party goers. Of course, there are
 more people here than in the living room.

 People stand around, glasses or plates in hand, happily munching and
 talking.

 On the counter next to the sink sits Paul's laptop, connected to some
 small speakers, providing music.
 Right now, it's playing: "Surfing U.S.A." by the Beach Boys.

 Garden Area
 Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small pool. It's surrounded by
 some deck-chairs. The eastern and western garden walls are overgrown
 with undergrowth, so as to hide the family members going for a seamelss
 tan. This wasn't necessary for the southern wall, wich is quite high,
 because it borders on a Golf course (Pauls told you they find the
 occasional golf ball in the pool nonetheless.)

 The water in the pool is boiling!

 A small flock of people is lying around in the deck-chairs, most of
 them still dressed, waving drinks and mumbling to each other in the
 afternoon glow.

 Slowly, everyones eyes are wandering towards the lava-lamp.

 You switch the battery-powered lava-lamp on.

 Suddenly, Paul appears, balancing a heavy printer on his arms, cables
 in his mouth. "Didya manage to get some paper?"
  You nod, handing them to him. He balances them gracefully on top of
 the printer.
  "Great. Why don't you enjoy yourself then?"
  You move out into the Garden Area, enjoying the cool night air.
  Suddenly, there is a commotion in the house. Paul stumbles out of the
 glass doors, face pale.
  "It's Hubert" he says, biting his lip.
  "Hubert?"
  "A German exchange guy I dated last year. Liked his accent. Anyway, I
 dumped him when I found out he was here to lead a camp of militant
 Nazi.("Hey" you mutter absent-mindedly. "Hobson's Law.") He didn't like
 that to well.  Now he's over there, stone drunk. Dressed like Hitler
 (must've mixed up New Years Eve and Halloween, oh these Eurotrash guys)
 and waving a piece around. Looks like he thinks those people in there
 are his hostages, and he will kill them If I don't surrender myself to
 him. I'm glad all those folks in there seem to be a bit too stoned to
 realize what's happening." He fondles your hair and breathes into your
 ear. "Could you look into it?"
  You smirk. "What? After realizing you dated a Nazi?" Paul leaves a
 trail of laughter, as he disappears to some other part of the -y.

 A blond, tall guy in a Hitler uniform strolls around the room.

 Everyone stares at the lava-lamp. Time for a clever metaphor about
 snakes and flutes.

 Between the two couches is a huge heap of purses and backpacks.

 You can also see a battery-powered lava-lamp here.

>examine hitler
 The costume isn't convincing for a second. The guy is tall, blond and
 rather muscular (you know see what Paul liked in him), the moustache
 made of shoeshine. He is waving a stub-nosed .38 around, murmuring
 German under his breath. He looks and sounds and smells pissed.

>shoot hitler
 Deciding to solve this the American way, you aim in Hubert / Hitlers
 general direction and fire. There are weak moans of protest as the
 blood splattered corpse flips over one of the couches and out of play
 ...er...  sight.
  There is a moment of silence as the people look at you, all pondering
 the possibilities here:
 1) you shoot a man to save a meaningless party and for the odd chance
 of getting laid.
 2) This was a piece of performance art.
  Deciding on the latter, there are some weak claps of applause.
  You bow, then throw the Uzi after the corpse, mumbling: "We'll clean
 up tomorrow."

 Suddenly, Paul appears beside you, a cute wrinkle on his brow.
  "Did I hear gunfire?"
  "Probably was the music."
  "So, where's Hubert?"
  "Stopped partying. So can we finally, finally, enjoy this thing?
 Together?"
  "No. This party is dead. I just got a call from the service who was
 supposed to deliver the noodles. Guess what? They accidentally
 delivered to the Golf course next door. Which is closed today, I just
 checked. But that doesn't matter - even if we get the noodles, how are
 we supposed to boil so many of them in such a short time?"
  You clap him on the shoulder.
  "Don't worry, I'll think of something." He puts your hand in his.
 "Thanks, Alex, I really appreciate this. I'll be in the kitchen,
 holding of the partygoers as long as I can."

>enter cart
 You get into the golf cart.

>go west
 The little golf cart gains a frightening amount of speed downhill. You
 mange to maneuver it onto the wooden plank - and then you are flying!
  Party guests gap as you fly - and as the golf carts nose sinks -
 splashing into the pool, spraying some people with boiling water. As
 you sink, your skin screaming with pain, you watch noodle float all
 around you - given 7 minutes, they'll be ready to be eaten.
  You only realize the full amount of pain as Paul pulls you out of the
 scalding water - and as he later, after you both more or less enjoyed
 the rest of the party and a healthy meal, puts ointment on your badly
 scalded legs, and some other body parts which technically weren't hurt
 at all. And even more time later, you sit in the garden, huddled
 together on a deck chair, musing at the stars and what this year 2008
 might bring.

 So, as I told you, that was great, but the first weeks of the new year
 will be rather stressful. After all, I'm still in hospital about those
 burns, and the police started asking around about some German guy - as
 did the local arm of Nazi party.
  But, dear Blogreaders, you know me, I'll find my way - and I'll keep
 you posted.
  One way or the other, I think I'll never forget

 The day I shot Hitler!

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 With the power of history swelling in your blood, you throw open the
 doors of the Eastern Theatre Ballroom. Soon, the decadent Western
 calendar will be overthrown, and the only months will be May, October,
 Ferroconcrete and Tractor.

 A hush falls over the dancefloor as you twirl out into open space with
 jutted chin and clingy pants. The crowd parts, revealing a bilious
 shrimp in khaki jodphurs, a death's-head medallion and a pervert's
 moustache.

 It's on.

 With the power of history swelling in your blood, you throw open the
 doors of the Eastern Theatre Ballroom. Soon, the decadent Western
 calendar will be overthrown, and the only months will be May, October,
 Ferroconcrete and Tractor.

 A hush falls over the dancefloor as you twirl out into open space with
 jutted chin and clingy pants. The crowd parts, revealing a bilious
 shrimp in khaki jodphurs, a death's-head medallion and a pervert's
 moustache.

 It's on.

 The War On New Year's
 or, Dance Dance January Revolution by Sam Kabo Ashwell

 Eastern Theatre Dancefloor
 Well, y'know, it's really hard to say much good about your average
 Eastern European disco. They're going through a particularly
 unfortunate phase in the inevitable disintegration of capitalism, so
 you can almost forgive them. Almost.

 You are confronted by a jumped-up little corporal with a thing for
 blondes, dogs and small children in lederhosen.

 The judges beam. Hitler smirks. The audience break into spontaneous
 Nazi salutes, and start pelting you with bratwurst. But retreat is
 unthinkable. Surely, somehow, you can break out the ultimate
 proletarian move that will clearly demonstrate class-destiny. If you
 can just think for a moment -

 The clock strikes twelve.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 What is your last name?
>Mudd


 "Good evening, Agent Mudd. Thank you for getting here so quickly..."
 He glances at your tuxedo.  "...and you're already dressed for the part
 I need you to play this evening."

 "Oh?  I was on my way to a party, this being New Year's Eve.  But I'd
 rather be working, to be honest - while I'm a fan of the mayor and his
 wife, I'm not overly fond of going stag to New Year's Eve parties.
 What's the job this evening?" you ask, picking a piece of lint from
 your otherwise black trousers.

 Special Agent Buxton smiles amicably at you.  "Well, I'm sorry to be
 the bearer of bad news, Mudd, but I'm afraid that's precisely where
 this evening's assignment takes you..."


 Not the Same Old Lang Syne
 Another rather silly SpeedIF by Jacqueline A. Lott
 Release 0 / Serial number 071230 / Inform 7 build 5J39 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/11N)


 Beneath a flickering street light, 5th and Main
 Times have been hard in the spying business as of late, and the effects
 of budget cuts are hard and far-reaching: even Special Agent Buxton is
 reduced to meeting spies on dark street corners to hand out
 assignments.

 Agent Buxton stands here, waiting to answer your questions.

>ask buxton about assignment
 "Tell me about the job," you inquire.

 "Yes, let's get down to business, shall we?  This evening's job is a
 bit bizarre, even by our standards.  We have some very reliable
 intelligence that..." He pauses, as if he's not quite comfortable with
 the part that comes next. "...that Adolf Hitler's scientists perfected
 a time machine and he plans to crash the mayor's party this evening.
 For what reason, we are unsure, but you must stop him at all costs."
 He lowers his voice and says, "All.  Costs.  Got me?  You have a
 license to kill this evening, Mudd."

 With a smug look, Buxton produces a tiny box, which he gives to you.
 "Inside this is a mouse.  But not just any mouse, mind you - it's an
 infected  mouse.

>eat mouse
 You can't see any such thing.

>ask buxton about mouse
 He says, "Inside this box is a mouse.  But not just any mouse, mind you
 - it's an infected  mouse."

>open box
 Hm, better not - there's death inside of it.

>ask buxton about box
 He says, "Inside this box is a mouse.  But not just any mouse, mind you
 - it's an infected  mouse."

>buxton about infection
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask buxton about infection
 There's a pause, then he says, "I don't have time for idle banter,
 Mudd."

>ask buxton about hitler
 He says, "What do you mean, you don't know who Hitler was?  Everyone
 knows who Hitler was.  Didn't you have to take some sort of test before
 you got into Spy School?  I weep for the future of our industry!  Let
 is suffice to say that he must die, and that you are the man who will
 make it happen."

>ask buxton about mayor
 He says, "He's not all that bad, as you know.  More importantly, he's
 valuable to this administration.  You must protect him."

>ask buxton about time machine
 There's a pause, then he says, "I don't have time for idle banter,
 Mudd."

>ask buxton about buxton
 There's a pause, then he says, "I don't have time for idle banter,
 Mudd."

>ask buxton about backpay
 There's a pause, then he says, "I don't have time for idle banter,
 Mudd."

 "Look, you have the mouse and I've already explained the assignment -
 infect Hitler.  I don't care how... just make sure that Hitler somehow
 comes in contact with the mouse's blood, feces, or saliva.

 "TAXI!"  he hails a cab.  You get in and direct the cabby to the
 mayor's house..."

>ask buxton about infection
 *** Press any key ***








 Mayoral Soiree
 Earlier, when Buxton had slipped out of the shadows and told you he had
 an assignment for you, you'd experienced a brief flicker of hope that
 you might not be attending the Mayor's New Year's Eve party.  But here
 you are, nevertheless, mingling with shallow cosmopolitan women and
 their power-hungry husbands.  Then again, you're not much better than
 they are, much as you'd like to think otherwise.  Are you here because
 you're on some noble quest to Do Good?  Or are you just here to funnel
 some more cash into your Swiss bank account?  Much as you hate to admit
 it, there's probably a lot of truth in the latter statement.

 You can see a table (on which are some egg nog and some hors d'oeuvres)
 here.

>ask buxton about mudd
 You can't see any such thing.

>put mouse in egg nog
 You can't see any such thing.

>put box in nog
 Those can't contain things.

>open box
 Hm, better not - there's death inside of it.

>examine nog
>examine nog
 This coagulated mess of cream is popular for whatever reason around the
 holidays.

 This coagulated mess of cream is popular for whatever reason around the
 holidays.

>take nog
 You'd really rather not.  You like the fact that your heart beats and
 your BMI is within normal range.

>put box in nog
 Those can't contain things.

>examine hors
 The hors d'oeuvres on hand this evening are a variety of finger
 sandwiches in countless varieties, all scrumptious-looking.

>take it
 You already have that.

>put mouse in nog
 You can't see any such thing.

>eat hors
 (first taking the hors d'oeuvres)
 You pick up a sandwich at random and take a bite.  As you chew the tiny
 snack, two thoughts occur to you.  First, that this is perhaps the best
 deli-sliced pygmy hippopotamus sandwich you have ever had, and second,
 that the access to the hors d'oeuvres table is limited and that perhaps
 if you stood here eating sandwiches you could block everyone's access
 to the eggnog, which you could spike without anyone except your
 intended target getting hurt.  Assuming Hitler turns up, that is.
 Which he won't, because (a) time machines are a load of hooey and (b)
 despite all conspiracy theories to the contrary, you're fairly certain
 Hitler has been dead since 1945.

 But wait, what's this?!  A small whirring sound announces the arrival
 of... a golf cart.  A very swanky golf cart.  Covered in noodles.
 Swanky noodles.  The cart comes to an abrupt stop and out of the
 driver's seat steps none other than Adolf Hitler himself.  In the
 flesh.  In the immortal words of Brendan Barnwell, "MACKEREL!" (...or
 "OPPRESSION!" - take your pick.)

 This is the moment your boss was hoping for - all the commotion and
 surprise from Hitler's arrival presents you with the perfect
 opportunity to spike the egg nog.  You open the box and drop the mouse
 into the nog.  The mouse gurgles, then sputters, then disappears
 beneath the surface... smothered in milk, eggs, cream, and only God
 knows what else.

>take nog
 You'd really rather not.  You like the fact that your heart beats and
 your BMI is within normal range.

 A horribly snooty woman makes a move for the egg nog, but you block it
 with your body and chew your fried red panda sandwich in a very
 diligent, turtle-like manner, which repulses the would-be egg nog
 consumer.  "Dreadfully sorry," you say through a mouth full of
 delicious finger food.  "I've got this New Year's resolution to slowly
 masticate all sandwiches, and I'm starting early.

>examine hitler
 His dramatic entrance in the golf cart time machine aroused only
 temporary attentiveness in the guests.  Despite his antiquated dress
 and ridiculous moustache, he was unable to hold their attention, and
 after their full fifteen-second attention span had been consumed, they
 went back to prattling on about their inane existances.

 A vapid man makes a move for the egg nog, but you block it with your
 body and chew your minced Riverine rabbit sandwich in a very pensive,
 cow-like manner, which repulses the would-be egg nog consumer.
 "Dreadfully sorry," you say through a mouth full of delicious finger
 food.  "I've got this New Year's resolution to slowly masticate all
 sandwiches, and I'm very committed.

>give egg nog to hitler
 (first taking the egg nog)
 You'd really rather not.  You like the fact that your heart beats and
 your BMI is within normal range.

 A horribly snooty woman makes a move for the egg nog, but you block it
 with your body and chew your long-baked beaked echidna sandwich in a
 very meditative, sloth-like manner, which repulses the would-be egg nog
 consumer.  "Dreadfully sorry," you say through a mouth full of
 delicious finger food.  "I've got this New Year's resolution to slowly
 masticate all sandwiches, and I'm starting early.

 Hitler then siddles up to the egg nog bowl, but you make no move to
 stop him.  In fact, you offer him a cup.  "Mein F\xfchrer," you say, as
 you hand him the cup - possibly laying it on a bit thick, but a smile
 touches Hitler's lips, he nods to you, and he accepts your offer of the
 cup.  He pours himself a helping of the thick, viscous, gelatinous (and
 deadly) goo.  "Prosit Neujahr," he says, amicably, before downing the
 goopy, mucilaginous, glutinous (and deadly) glop."

 You watch Hitler carefully, and begin to count to yourself to see how
 long this is going to take.  The average incubation time for
 hantavirus, the most common mouse-borne virus that springs to mind, is
 two to four weeks in humans.  You know this from both your extensive
 spy training as well as your obsessive reading of Wikipedia.

 Two to four weeks?!  Let's hope it ain't hantivirus, hm?

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Blech!" Hitler spits up some blood into his egg nog glass, the falls
 to a heap on the floor.  That's what you were hoping for, deep down
 inside - fast acting Ebolavirus.  Except - oh noes!  It's so very
 infectious that soon you'll be infected, as well as all the guests.  So
 much for collateral damage... What are you to do?!

>die horribly
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take hitler
 I don't suppose Adolf Hitler would care for that.

 The revelers are freaked out.  How will you save them?

>contain virus
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>enter cart
 There are so many reasons to not enter that contraption.  First, you
 haven't the slightest idea how to drive the thing, through space or
 time.  Secondly, who wants to be seen in a golf cart?  I mean... really
 now.

 The party-goers are crazy with fear.  How will you aid them?

>look
 Mayoral Soiree
 You look around, trying to plan how you want this to go down in the
 (probably unlikely) event that Hitler actually makes an appearance.
 You can picture a couple of different scenarios.  You could put the
 mice amongst the hors d'oeuvres and egg nog, but then you run the risk
 of infecting others.  You'd like to avoid any collateral damage,
 however, so unless you can think of a way to keep people away from the
 hors d'oeuvres table, your best bet might just be to make the mouse
 bite him.  How to do that - especially without getting bit in the
 process - is something you have yet to figure out.  Perhaps you can put
 the mouse down the front of his trousers or something.

 Hitler lies dead in a heap on the floor.

 You can also see a golf cart and a table (on which are some egg nog)
 here.

 The revelers are scared.  How will you save them?

>examine cart
 This is one tripped out golf cart.  Swanky and benoodled, it must be
 the time machine of which Buxton spoke.

 The party-goers are insane with fright.  How will you aid them?

>enter cart
 There are so many reasons to not enter that contraption.  First, you
 haven't the slightest idea how to drive the thing, through space or
 time.  Secondly, who wants to be seen in a golf cart?  I mean... really

 The merrymakers are frightened.  How will you cure them?

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some hors d'oeuvres
   a box (open)
     an antidote
   a tuxedo (being worn)

 The frolickers are scared.  How will you save them?

>eat hitler
 (first taking Adolf Hitler)
 I don't suppose Adolf Hitler would care for that.

 The partiers are crazy with fear.  How will you rescue them?

>examine antidote
 You can only hope that the vial you've found in the box given to you by
 Buxton contains an antidote.

 The merrymakers are freaked out.  How will you cure them?

>put antidote in hors
 You need to be holding the antidote before you can put it into
 something else.

 The partiers are freaking the hell out.  How will you rescue them?

>take antidote
 You remove the antidote from the box and divide it equally among the
 party attendees and yourself.  Everyone hurriedly downs the strange
 liquid, willing to gamble on its effectiveness after witnessing the
 quick and grueseome demise of the man with the silly moustache...
 ...and it's a gamble that pays off!  Everyone lives until midnight, and
 you needn't have worried about attending the party all by yourself,
 because there are lots of lovely ladies in line for a kiss at midnight.

 This is a work of SpeedIF.  SpeedIFs are intentionally written in a
 very short period of time; the "rule" used to be that you wrote a
 SpeedIF in two hours or less, but that is a rule to which few coders
 actually adhere.  This game was written in about twelve hours, though
 honestly quite a bit of that time was spent relearning how to code.

 This game was written for New Year's Speed, a SpeedIF that was
 coordinated to coincide with the last weekend in 2007.  The premise of
 this particular SpeedIF is as follows:

 Write a New Year's-themed speed IF which incorporates eggnog spiked
 with mice, a party crashed by Adolf Hitler, and a resolution to lazily
 masticate all sandwiches.  Extra props for including a swanky,
 benoodled golf cart.

 Silliness ensues.  I hope you enjoy it, though.  If you notice any
 show-stopping bugs, I can be reached at Jacqueline.A.Lott@gmail.com

 Thanks, as ever, to Graham Nelson and Emily Short for Inform 7 and its

 for correcting my German, and thanks to all the other mudders who were
 there to answer my sleepy late-night questions.
