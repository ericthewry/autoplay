 "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme
 beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without
 appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous
 trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a
 stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show."    --

 "Closing time!"  The voice echoes in the space around you.


 You slowly open your eyes to find your face pressed against a book.  A
 book you've been drooling on.

 One thing at a time.  Let's focus on the book.

 Type EXAMINE BOOK, or X BOOK for short.

>examine book

 This is your textbook for Math 058, Concepts of Mathematics.  (Or is
 it Math 314?  Or Math 272?  You really ought to remember this.)  The
 book has some drool on it.

 So it's your math book.  That helps some.  You might be up to a wider
 glance around now.  Try LOOK, or just L for short.

>look

 Right.  The library.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">College Library</span>
 The library is a great place to study - or so you've been told.  You
 hadn't seen the inside of it until today.

 (You've also been told it's a good place to sleep.  Well, you can
 vouch for that now.)

 On the study table in front of you are your math book and an empty
 yogurt cup.

 The librarian spots you and begins walking in your direction.  Oh, no.

 You might have time to look up one more topic in your math book.
 Newton, maybe.  He'll probably show up on the final tomorrow.  Or
 maybe Professor Glasser will expect you to wax philosophical about
 mathematics in general.  You could LOOK UP NEWTON or LOOK UP MATH.

>look up math

 (in your math book)
 There is considerable debate as to the exact definition of
 mathematics.  Is it the study of numbers?  Shapes?  Is it discovered,
 or is it invented?  Aristotle called mathematics "the science of
 quantity," but some modern areas of mathematics like topology don't
 really fit that definition.   Bertrand Russell said that mathematics
 can be reduced to logic, but his own efforts in that area were
 punctured by Gödel's incompleteness theorems.  Most modern
 mathematicians take a "I know it when I see it" view, when they bother
 to think about the definition of mathematics at all.

 Regardless of its definition, since the 1600s mathematics has proven
 to be particularly useful to science.  For example, Isaac Newton's
 second law of motion, <span class="floydstyle em">F = ma</span>, or force equals mass times
 acceleration, single-handedly reduced a wide variety of problems in
 physics to a simple equation.  Modern physics, engineering, chemistry,
 economics, computers, and even large parts of biology and the social
 sciences would not be possible without mathematics.  Galileo even went
 so far as to claim that mathematics is the language with which God has
 written the universe.

 Is mathematics art or science?  Science owes much to mathematics, and
 Gauss called mathematics "the queen of the sciences."  But some
 mathematicians sound more like artists when describing their work.
 Russell, in the following quote, makes that comparison explicit:

 "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme
 beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without
 appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous
 trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a
 stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true
 spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man,
 which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in
 mathematics as surely as poetry."


 Wow.  That's a lot to digest.  You're never going to remember all of
 this for tomorrow.

 The librarian is getting closer.  You probably should take the
 initiative and GREET HER.  Maybe if you're friendly she'll let you
 stay a little longer.

>greet librarian

 "Hello!" you say brightly.

 "Hello," the librarian responds.  "I'm afraid it's time for you to
 leave."

 It looks like you might need more than friendliness here.  Let's go
 for pathos.  Try TELL LIBRARIAN ABOUT FINAL.

>tell libririan about final

 (to the librarian)
 "Um, I have my final exam in conceptual mathematics tomorrow," you say
 in your best respectful-of-authority voice.  "I really need to do some
 more studying.  May I please, please stay here for just a little
 longer?"

 "No," she replies.  "I'm sorry, but I have to close up the library
 now."

 Well, that didn't work.  She's probably heard it all before.

 You might as well just head back to your dorm room.  You'll need to
 pick up your things first, though.  Try GET BOOK AND CUP.

>get book and cup

 your math book: You pick up your math book.
 empty yogurt cup: You pick up the yogurt cup.

 (Notice that you can GET more than one object at a time.)

 "I hope you're not planning to remove any library books," the
 librarian says.  "The borrowing period for this academic year has
 ended."

 You should check your inventory to show her.  Try INVENTORY, or just I
 for short.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   an empty yogurt cup
   your math book

 "Good," says the librarian.  Then her eyes focus on the yogurt cup.
 She frowns.  "I'll take that," she says.

 Try GIVE CUP TO LIBRARIAN.

>give cup to librarian

 You give the empty yogurt cup to the librarian.

 "Thank you," the librarian says.  "Next time, please try to follow the
 rules about food in the library.

 "Good luck on your final," she adds, pointedly indicating the exit to
 the south.

 There's really nothing left to do but head back to your dorm room.
 Try SOUTH, or just S.

>go south

 You walk out, flashing the librarian a weak smile as you go.  She
 closes and locks the doors behind you.

 Then you trudge back to your dorm room, thinking about how you got
 here...
 This ends the tutorial.

 You've just seen several of the most useful commands in the game:
 EXAMINE object (or X object)
 LOOK (or L)
 LOOK UP topic (in your math book)
 GREET character
 TELL character ABOUT topic
 GET an object (more than one if you want)
 GIVE object TO character
 INVENTORY (or I)
 SOUTH (or S.  The other seven compass directions - and their
 abbreviations - are allowed, too, plus UP and DOWN).


 You can review these commands and many others by typing HELP at any
 time.  In-game HINTS are available as well.

 An Interactive Digression by Mike Spivey
 Release 2 / Serial number 180112 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)


 Professor Glasser's survey course in conceptual mathematics seemed
 like a good idea at the start of the term - no graded homework, no
 midterm exams - just an oral final at the end.  As the semester
 progressed, cutting a few classes didn't really seem to matter.
 Neither did skipping a reading assignment - or a homework set - here
 and there.   But "a few, here and there" slowly turned into "several,"
 which turned into "most."  Eventually you were too embarrassed to show
 up to class anymore, and for the better part of the second half of the
 term you did an impressive job of forgetting about the final exam.

 Until this morning.

 Cramming has never worked for you, but what choice did you have?  You
 already made your choices, you suppose - repeatedly, throughout the
 semester.

 Blaming yourself now isn't going to do any good, though.  You can
 blame yourself all you want after tomorrow.  Focus on the final.
 Focus on the final.

 How, though?  It's late.  You need more sleep.  But you're not sure
 you remember much (anything?) from today's library cram session.

 You've got to pass that final because you've got to pass the class.
 What will happen to your scholarship if you don't?


 With these pleasant thoughts running through your head as you walk
 across campus, you finally return to...
 across campus, you finally return to...
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your Dorm Room</span>
 Apparently your roommate moved out today.  The room looks pretty bare
 with only your stuff left in it...not that you had much to begin with.
 The only decorations that remain are a few of your posters hanging on
 the walls.

 You hear loud noises coming from the hallway to the south.  It sounds
 like your hallmates have begun celebrating the end of the academic
 year.

 You can see your bed and your desk (on which are a medicine bottle and
 a note) here.

>read note

 It's from your roommate.  "Good luck on your final!  I've left you the
 last of my study pills.  I promise you they are perfectly safe,
 all-natural, and organic - although they may not work exactly like you
 expect."

>examine pills

 Your roommate claims these pills are good for your memory, but you've
 always been skeptical.

>examine bed

 Your bedsheets feature characters from one of your favorite childhood
 shows.  Particularly prominent is a purple puppet vampire, who is
 endearing rather than scary.  You don't care that your friends
 occasionally make fun of you for these sheets.

>examine bottle

 These study pills are ones that your roommate picked up at that
 sketchy health-food store downtown.  Your roommate swears by them, but
 you've always been skeptical.  The bottle is closed, and there is
 something written on it.

>read bottle

 On the bottle is written "Blorple Pills: Explore a nearby object's
 mystic energy field via the power of dreams!"

 Mystic energy field?  Power of dreams?!  You thought these were
 supposed to be study pills.

>open bottle

 You push down on the bottle's cap, twist it, and pull... and the
 bottle opens easily.  Whew!  Sometimes these "childproof" medicine
 bottles are really hard to open.  There is one pill left in the
 bottle.

>take pill

 A bit hesitantly, you swallow the pill.  Hopefully this will help with
 your studying.

>put textbook under pillow

 You can't see any such thing, at least as described.

>get on bed

 You get onto your bed.

>sleep

 You curl up with the math book.  Whether by exhaustion or the effects
 of the pill (or both), you quickly fall asleep.

 Your dreams are strange.  Images from today's cramfest run through
 your mind in rapid succession, combining, reforming, and producing new
 images, each of which sinks into your unconscious.  Eventually your
 thoughts slow down, and as they do you can feel your mind empty.  Your
 dream coalesces into...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Point</span>
 You find yourself in a deep dark blue - almost black - expanse of
 space that extends as far as you can see in all three dimensions.  The
 only thing that breaks up this space is the white disk floating in
 mid-air that you are standing on.  While the disk doesn't appear to be
 supported by anything, there is a hole in the middle of it.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your understanding of Arithmetic has increased.  You estimate</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">that your score on tomorrow's final has just gone up by two</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">points.]</span>

>score

 You estimate that you would score 2 out of 100 on tomorrow's final
 exam.  If you remember Professor Glasser's grading scale correctly,
 this would earn you an F in the course.
 (For a more complete breakdown of your score, use the FULL command.
 To toggle reporting of your grade in the status line, use the GRADE
 command.)

>examine disk

 The disk is pure white and has a diameter of about 8 feet.  There is a
 hole in the middle of it, large enough for you to enter.

>grade

 (Grade reporting is now on.)

>enter disk

 You clamber down the hole.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">One</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place, but it gives
 you a sense of unity, wholeness, and beginnings.  A hole leads back
 up.  You sense another exit, too - one in a deeper, "downward"
 direction from this space.

>go down

 You make your way down.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Void</span>
 This space feels formless, as if it consists of as-yet unshaped
 matter.  You can sense a way out above you.

 The only solid thing you can discern here is a white wand, floating
 upright in the void.

>take wand

 You take the white wand from the void.

>examine it

 This white wand is in the shape of a snake - a one-eyed adder,
 actually.  The adder's eye is a dark sapphire.  The wand has the word
 "Increment" inscribed along it.

>wave wand

 You wave the wand, and the word "Increment" on it glows briefly before
 fading.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Void</span>
 This space feels formless, as if it consists of as-yet unshaped
 matter.  You can sense a way out above you.

>go up

 You make your way up through the void.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">One</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place, but it gives
 you a sense of unity, wholeness, and beginnings.  A hole leads back
 up.  You sense another exit, too - one in a deeper, "downward"
 direction from this space.

>wave wand

 You wave the wand, and the word "Increment" on it begins to glow.  It
 glows brighter and brighter.  Finally, the wand emits a dazzling flash
 of light - and disappears!  Wandless, you feel yourself
 <span class="floydstyle em">increment</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Two</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place, but it's
 marked by a feeling of duality, as if it somehow contains opposites
 within itself.  The only exit is a hole leading up.

>go up

 You make your way up.

 As you climb through the hole, at first it appears you are entering a
 dark blue nothingness.  But then you see, off to the "west," the white
 disk you were standing on earlier.  The white wand is lying on it,
 pointed in your direction.  As you stare at it, the wand begins to
 change shape!  It widens and flattens until it is the width of the
 disk.  Then the tip stretches toward you, the wand soon extending far
 beyond its original length.  The tip picks up speed, and it passes you
 almost faster than you can follow.  You get a last glimpse of the tip
 off in the distance before it is lost from sight.  Looking around, you
 find that the wand has become a line with numbers marked on it, a line
 that extends as far as you can see to the "east."  With some
 trepidation, you step onto this new line.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Positive Axis: 2</span>
 You are in a dark blue expanse of space, standing on a white line that
 stretches to the west and as far as you can see to the east.  The
 number 2 is marked on the line here.  There is a hole next to the 2
 large enough for you to climb down into.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your understanding of Arithmetic has increased.  You estimate</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">that your score on tomorrow's final has just gone up by one</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">point.]</span>

>go down

 You clamber down the hole.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Two</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place, but it's
 marked by a feeling of duality, as if it somehow contains opposites
 within itself.  The only exit is a hole leading back up to the
 positive axis.

>go up

 You make your way up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Positive Axis: 2</span>
 You are in a dark blue expanse of space, standing on a white line that
 stretches to the west and as far as you can see to the east.  The
 number 2 is marked on the line here.  There is a hole next to the 2
 large enough for you to climb down into.

>go east

 You walk along the positive axis for a while, tracing the passage of
 the tip of the white wand.  You see marks for 3, 4, 5, and larger
 numbers.  There are no holes or anything else featured on this part of
 the positive axis, though, and you soon decide return to the 2 mark.

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Positive Axis: 1</span>
 You find yourself in a deep dark blue - almost black - expanse of
 space that extends as far as you can see in all three dimensions.  The
 space is broken up by the straight, flat white line floating in
 mid-air that you are standing on.  The line begins here and stretches
 out of sight to the east.  The number 1 is marked on the line.  While
 the line doesn't appear to be supported by anything, there is a hole
 in the middle of it here, next to the 1.

 Since the disk you were standing on earlier has now become the
 location of 1 on the positive axis, you find yourself wondering if
 this is the only space that has changed.

>go down

 You clamber down the hole.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">One</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place, but it gives
 you a sense of unity, wholeness, and beginnings.  A hole leads back up
 to the positive axis.  You sense another exit, too - one in a deeper,
 "downward" direction from this space.

>go down

 You make your way down.

 This space seems more formed than it did the last time you were here.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Form</span>
 The space is now partially-formed, but it is still mostly unshaped
 matter.  Besides the way up to the manifestation of one, you can now
 sense several more "paths" through the void: north, south, east, and
 west.

>go west

 You make your way west through the void.  As you do, you feel an
 electrical impulse course through you.  You find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall</span>
 You are standing in the great hall of a large, cobwebby castle.  A
 long table stretches from one end of the hall to the other.  The
 entryway of the castle is to the east.  Exits west and south lead to
 other parts of the castle.

 On the long table is a pile of old coins.

 A large purple puppet is here, counting several coins laid out on the
 table.  He is talking to himself.  "... eight, nine, ten!  Ten coins!"

>examine puppet

 The Count is not a man but a purple puppet.  There is no one animating
 him, yet he talks and moves about.  You're definitely dreaming.

>examine cup

 You can't see any such thing, at least as described.

>examine coins

 This is a huge pile of coins.  You wonder if the Count knows exactly
 how many there are.  He probably does.

>ask count about coins

 It would be more polite to greet the Count first.

>greet count

 The puppet looks up at your approach.  "I am the Count of this castle,
 and I love to count!  But I have a problem.  Maybe you can help.

 "I have ten different coins here that I have been flipping.  I want to
 count how many ways I can flip the ten coins and have half of them
 come up heads and half come up tails.  For example, one way is
 HHHHHTTTTT.  Another way is HTHTHTHTHT.  A third way is HTHHTTTTHH.
 That's three.  But there are a lot more than that, and I can't seem to
 count them because I can't keep track of all the combinations!

 "Here are some ideas.  I know that if I want 0 heads, then the answer
 is 1: TTTTTTTTTT.  I know that if I want 1 head, the answer is 10:
 HTTTTTTTTT, THTTTTTTTT, and so on, with one head for each of the other
 coins.  It took me a long time to find the answer with two heads, but
 I'm pretty sure I got it: 45.  But with three or more I can't keep
 track of what I've counted and what I haven't.

 "If you know the answer, please tell me!

 "I will be happy to let you have one of my coins if you can help me."

>ask count about big bird

 "I haven't seen him in a while," the Count says.  "I probably should
 go visit sometime soon."

>ask count about coins

 "Can you tell me how many ways there are to flip ten coins and get
 five heads and five tails?"

>99

 I didn't recognize that command.  (There is a list of recognized
 commands in the HELP menus.)

>go east

 As you move east, you feel an electrical impulse course through you.
 The space around you seems to fold in on itself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Form</span>
 The space is now partially-formed, but it is still mostly unshaped
 matter.  Besides the way up to the manifestation of one, you can now
 sense several more "paths" through the void: north, south, east, and
 west to the Great Hall.

>go north

 You make your way north through the void.  As you do, you feel an
 electrical impulse course through you.  You find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lyceum</span>
 You stand in the Lyceum, a collection of buildings and open spaces in
 ancient Athens.  There is a stadium to the west, a temple lies north,
 and you can see a private home with an ornate doorway to the east.  A
 road leads northeast out of Athens, and the rest of the city lies
 south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple of Number, Southern End</span>
 You stand in the southern end of the Temple of Number.  The temple is
 made of white stone and features imposing Ionic columns.  There is an
 inscription on the wall, the rest of the temple is to the north, and
 the exit to the Lyceum is south.

>read inscription

 "Number is the origin of all things."

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple of Number, Northern End</span>
 You stand in the northern end of the Temple of Number.  The temple is
 made of white stone and features imposing Ionic columns.  Instead of
 the half-expected statue of Athena Parthenos, though, stands a large
 statue of Pythagoras.  Behind the statue is a small passageway heading
 north.

 An acolyte is here, silently cleaning up the area around the statue.

 You can also see a trash urn and a scrap of papyrus here.

 The acolyte picks up the scrap of papyrus from the floor.  She reads
 it carefully, nods, and tosses it in the urn.

>examine urn

 This large urn is decorated with tasteful depictions of various
 numbers.

 In the trash urn is a scrap of papyrus.

 The acolyte polishes an already spotless part of the statue.

>take scrap

 Taken.

 The acolyte pokes at a corner of the temple with her broom.

>read it

 This appears to be a piece torn from some religious scroll.

 "Number is the origin of all things.

 Number has two basic forms: The odd and the even.  Each thing is odd
 or even or is a <span class="floydstyle em">ΛΟΓΟΣ</span>, or ratio, made from odd and even.

 1.  Odd things include the statue of Him in our temple, which is one.

 2.  Even things include the primary sources of light in our sky - the
 sun and moon, which are two.

 3.  ΛΟΓΟΣ things include the seasons, which represent the ratio of
 one
 year into four parts.

 Nothing which is not odd, even, or a ratio from odd and even can
 exist."

 A small passageway is behind the statue, leading north.

 The acolyte picks up a speck of dust from the floor of the temple.

>greet acolyte

 The acolyte is focused on her cleaning, and she ignores you.

 The acolyte sweeps the area in front of the statue.

 Dropped.

 The acolyte picks up a speck of dust from the floor of the temple.

 The acolyte walks over to where you dropped the math book and looks

>look up pythagoras

 (in your math book)
 Pythagoras was an ancient Greek mathematician.  He also founded a
 quasi-religious order whose key belief was that numbers (by which they
 meant the positive integers) are the basis of everything in the
 universe.

 The Pythagorean Theorem says that the square of the diagonal of a
 right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the sides, or, in
 symbols, <span class="floydstyle em">a</span>² + <span class="floydstyle em">b</span>² = <span class="floydstyle em">c</span>².  While this
 theorem
 is named for Pythagoras, there is no conclusive evidence that he
 actually proved the theorem.  It probably led to the downfall of his
 religious cult, though.  If you take a right triangle with sides of
 length 1, the Pythagorean Theorem says that the length of the diagonal
 must be the square root of 2.  The proof that the square root of 2 is
 irrational - by one of the Pythagoreans - invalidated their key belief
 in numbers.

 The acolyte is wearing pure white robes and wields a broom.  She
 doesn't look much like the conversational type.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple of Number, Southern End</span>
 You stand in the southern end of the Temple of Number.  The temple is

>examine columns

 These imposing columns are made of white stone and feature Ionic

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lyceum</span>
 You stand in the Lyceum, a collection of buildings and open spaces in
 ancient Athens.  There is a stadium to the west, a temple lies north,
 and you can see a private home with an ornate doorway to the east.  A
 road leads northeast out of Athens, and the rest of the city lies
 south.

>go east

 Some force blocks you from stepping through the doorway of the home.
 Ignorance may be bliss, but a little knowledge would go a long way
 here.

>examine doorway

 There is a rather ornate doorway here - but no door.  Written above
 the doorway is the phrase "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter."

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Stadium</span>
 This is a stadium in ancient Athens.  The stadium itself consists of
 raised ground on either side of a race track about 200 meters long.
 The rest of the Lyceum is back east.

 Achilles sits by the side of the race track with his head in his
 hands.

>greet achilles

 Achilles looks up.  "I'm the fastest man in Greece.  Then this guy
 Zeno challenged me to a 200-meter race with a tortoise, under two
 conditions: (1) I had to be willing to give the tortoise a head start
 of 100 meters, and (2) every time I got to where I last saw the
 tortoise I had to look up and mark its position.  Of course I can beat
 a tortoise, even with that much head start, right?  But no.  Watch."

 Achilles snaps his fingers, and from somewhere in the grass of the
 raised ground comes a tortoise.  The tortoise ambles to the 100-meter
 mark, and Achilles heads to the start.  They take off.  When Achilles
 reaches the halfway mark, he looks up, and the tortoise is ahead of
 him.  Achilles notes its position, races to that position, and looks
 up.  The tortoise is still ahead of him.  He does this again.  The
 tortoise is still ahead.  And again.  The tortoise is, once more,
 ahead.  Every time Achilles looks up he's closer to the tortoise, but
 he never quite catches up to it!  Finally he stops running and looks
 over at you forlornly.  The tortoise crosses the finish line, flashes
 a chelonian smile at Achilles, and disappears to wherever it was
 before.

 Achilles says, "You see?  I can't catch up to the tortoise if every
 time I run to where it was before, it's still ahead of me!"

>examine track

 The race track is made of hard-packed clay and is about 200 meters
 long.

 south, east, and west to the Great Hall.

>go north

 You make your way north through the void.  As you do, you feel an
 electrical impulse course through you.  You find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lyceum</span>
 You stand in the Lyceum, a collection of buildings and open spaces in
 ancient Athens.  There is a stadium to the west, a temple lies north,
 and you can see a private home with an ornate doorway to the east.  A
 road leads northeast out of Athens, and the rest of the city lies
 south.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Royal Road</span>
 This flat, paved road runs from southwest to northeast.  However, you
 also spot a steep path leaving the road and winding its way north up
 the hillside.

>go north

 It's an arduous trek up the path.  By the time you reach the top you
 are winded.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hilltop</span>
 You stand on top of a small hill just north of Athens.  A winding path
 leads south, back down to the Royal Road.

 The great geometer Euclid is sitting here.  He appears to be lost in
 thought.

>greet geometer

 "Oh!  Hello.  Sorry.  Please accept my apologies if you've been
 standing there a while.  Sometimes I don't notice what's going on
 around me when I'm doing geometry."

 You give Euclid a nod, as if to say that there's no need to apologize.
 He interprets it as interest.

 "I was just thinking about the postulates in my <span class="floydstyle em">Elements</span>.
 These are what I call the basic truths on which I build all of my
 geometric arguments.  I'm happy with the first four, but the fifth one
 is too... I don't know... wordy?

 "It's basically equivalent to saying this: Given any straight line and
 a point not on that line, there exists exactly one other straight line
 that passes through the point and never intersects the first line.
 This is true no matter how far you extend the two lines.  So there's
 exactly one other line that's <span class="floydstyle em">parallel</span> to the first line and
 that goes through the point.

 "I'm trying to figure out how to derive this one from the first four
 so that I don't have to claim it as a postulate.  But I can't seem to
 do it.

 "Is it obvious that if you start with a point and a line, there's
 exactly one other line that goes through the point and never touches
 the first line?  Or is that not even true?

 "If you have any ideas about how to prove this, or run across any
 examples where there are no lines or two or more lines through the
 point that don't touch the first line, please tell me about them!

 "And here.  This will help you remember my postulates."  He hands you
 a scroll.

>read scroll

 "First postulate: You can draw a straight line from any point to any
 other point.

 Second postulate: You can extend a finite straight line continuously
 in a straight line.

 Third postulate: You can draw a circle with any center and any radius.

 Fourth postulate: All right (90 degree) angles are equal to each
 other.

 Fifth postulate (rephrased, also known as the <span class="floydstyle em">parallel</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">postulate</span>): Given a line and a point not on the line, there is
 exactly one other line that goes through the point that never touches
 the first line."

>go down

 You make the somewhat less arduous trek back down the path.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Royal Road</span>
 This flat, paved road runs from southwest to northeast.  However, you
 also spot a steep path leaving the road and winding its way north up
 the hillside.

 As you move south, you feel an electrical impulse course through you.
 The space around you seems to fold in on itself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Form</span>

>go west

 You make your way west through the void.  As you do, you feel an
 electrical impulse course through you.  You find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall</span>
 You are standing in the great hall of a large, cobwebby castle.  A
 long table stretches from one end of the hall to the other.  The
 entryway of the castle is to the east.  Exits west and south lead to
 other parts of the castle.

 On the long table is a pile of old coins.

 The Count is here, sitting at the table.  He mumbles something that
 sounds like "three."

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Chapel</span>
 This small chapel does not appear to be dedicated to God or gods;
 instead, it looks like a place for the worship of numbers.  Icons are
 placed at regular intervals around the walls.  The exit to the Great
 Hall is back east.

>examine icons

 Most of the icons are highly stylized representations of a single
 number, such as three, one, or four.  One icon, though, is a little
 different: It consists of a number triangle.

>examine triangle

 The number triangle on the icon looks like this:

  1
  1   1
  1   2   1
  1   3   3   1
  1   4   6   4   1

  1   8  28  56  70  56  28   8   1

  The words "Pascal's Triangle" appear underneath the numbers.

>look up pascal

 (in your math book)
 Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, scientist, philosopher, and
 theologian.  He is known for constructing one of the first mechanical
 calculators, for his work in projective geometry, and for his work in
 hydrodynamics.  A unit of pressure is named after him, as is the
 triangle of numbers known as "Pascal's triangle."

 Pascal was also one of the founders of the field of probability.
 While his initial work in probability was to solve gambling problems,
 he applied his insights to other areas of human knowledge as well.
 For example, <span class="floydstyle em">Pascal's wager</span> consists of one of the first uses
 of expected values.  In it, Pascal argues that, in the absence of
 conclusive evidence as to the existence of God, the payoffs for
 believing in God (infinite happiness if God exists, nothing if God
 does not) versus not believing in God (eternal damnation if God
 exists, nothing if God does not) are such that it is more reasonable
 for humans to bet on belief in God.

>look up pascal's triangle

 (in your math book)
 Pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers that have several
 interpretations.  One meaning is that the number in the <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>th
 row, <span class="floydstyle em">k</span>th column (denoted <span class="floydstyle em">C(n,k)</span>) is the number of
 committees of size <span class="floydstyle em">k</span> that can be formed from <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>
 people.  An equivalent interpretation is that <span class="floydstyle em">C(n,k)</span> is the
 number of sequences of 1's and 0's that have length <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> and
 contain exactly <span class="floydstyle em">k</span> 1's.

 Another, different kind of meaning of the numbers in Pascal's triangle
 is that they are the coefficients when expanding
 (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+1)<span class="floydstyle em">ⁿ</span> in powers of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.  For example,
 (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+1)⁵ = <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>⁵ + 5<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>⁴ + 10<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>³ +
 10<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>²+ 5<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + 1, and the coefficients 1, 5, 10, 10, 5,
 1 are the numbers in row 5 in Pascal's triangle.

 Pascal's triangle can be generated very easily: The numbers in the
 leftmost column are all 1's, and the numbers in the right diagonal are
 all 1's as well.  Otherwise, to get <span class="floydstyle em">C(n,k)</span>, you add
 <span class="floydstyle em">C(n-1,k)</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">C(n-1,k-1)</span>.  In other words, to obtain
 the number you want, you add the number to its "north" and to its
 "northwest" in the triangle.

 Pascal's triangle is indexed starting with 0 rather than 1: The
 initial row is row 0, not row 1, and the leftmost column is column 0,
 not column 1.

 (Unfortunately, the page giving the first several rows of Pascal's
 triangle appears to be torn out of your math book.  You did buy it
 used, after all.)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall</span>
 You are standing in the great hall of a large, cobwebby castle.  A

 The Count is here, sitting at the table.  He mumbles something that

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Solar</span>
 This is a smaller, cozier room than the great hall to the north.  A
 sumptuous tapestry hangs on one wall, and there is a side table
 beneath it.

 A large bronze box lies on the side table.

 Another large purple puppet is here, fiddling disgruntledly with the
 bronze box.

>examine puppet

 She looks much like the Count, except that she sports a large mop of
 blonde hair.

>greet puppet

 You approach the purple puppet and introduce yourself.  She steps back
 from the bronze box and says, "Please forgive my manners!  I was
 preoccupied with my mechanical calculator.

 "I am the Countess of this castle.  Like my husband, I love to count!
 And I love to work large multiplication problems with my mechanical
 calculator.  Unfortunately, it seems to be broken now, and I'm not
 sure how to fix it.

 "If you have any questions for me, please feel free to ask.
 Otherwise, I'd really like to get this fixed."

 She turns back to the bronze box.

>examine box

 This bronze box has several knobs and small wheels on it.  It appears
 to be a primitive mechanical calculator.

>ask puppet about box

 "It seems to be broken.  It would be nice to have it fixed!"

 This is a beautiful tapestry, consisting of several mathematical
 symbols woven together in an intricate pattern.

>examine symbols

>go south

 You make your way south through the void.  As you do, you feel an
 electrical impulse course through you.  You find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Librarian's Office</span>
 This appears to be the head librarian's office in the Great Library of
 Alexandria.  Scrolls litter the floor.  The main part of the library
 is north of you.

 The numbers from 1 to 100 are carved on the wall here, in some kind of
 puzzle.

>examine puzzle

 On the wall are carved numbers from 1 to 100, in ten rows of ten each.
 It looks like you could push any of the numbers.  Next to the numbers
 is a switch, with two settings: "Remove Number," and "Remove Larger
 Multiples of the Number."  The switch is currently set to "Remove
 Number," although you could easily move it to the other setting by
 flipping the switch.  The numbers currently look like this:

  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20

 91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99  100

 At the bottom is a challenge from the librarian: "To access the map
 room, leave just the primes between 1 and 100 by pushing only five
 numbers."

>look up primes in book

 A positive integer is prime if it is divisible by exactly two positive
 integers: itself and 1.  The numbers 7, 29, and 43 are all examples of
 primes.  The number 1 is not prime because it is only divisible by one
 positive integer (itself), rather than two.

 A huge globe sits on a pedestal in the center of the room.

>examine globe

 This appears to be the librarian's model of the earth, and it is much
 larger than you are.  It's incomplete, as it only shows the parts of
 the world that were known in Alexandria at this time.  However, it
 does have lines of latitude and meridians of longitude marked on it.

 The globe doesn't fit perfectly on its pedestal, though; there is a
 small gap between the pedestal and the globe.

>examine gap

 Since the globe doesn't fit perfectly on the pedestal, there is a
 small gap between the edge of the pedestal and the globe.

 This short pedestal supports the globe.  The globe doesn't fit

 The great geometer Euclid is sitting here.  He appears to be lost in
 thought.

>greet euclid

 "Do you have any ideas about how to prove my parallel postulate?"
 Euclid asks.  "Or have you found any examples with no other lines
 through the point that don't touch the first line?  Or maybe examples
 with two or more lines through the point that don't touch the first
 line?  If so, please tell me about them!"

>tell euclid about globe

 "A spherical model of the earth, huh?  Aristotle argued that the world
 is round, and so I'm not surprised that someone has created one of
 these.  Anything interesting marked on it?"

>tell about latitudes

 (to Euclid)
 Euclid says, "I don't think that will help me prove or disprove my
 parallel postulate."

>tell about latitudes and longitudes

 (to Euclid)
 You describe the meridians of longitude that you saw on the globe in
 the Library of Alexandria.  Euclid becomes more and more agitated.  As
 you finish, Euclid almost cuts you off in his excitement.

 "That's it!" he says.  "If you take a meridian of longitude and a
 point not on that meridian, a second - parallel - meridian that goes
 through the point must intersect the first meridian at both the north
 and south poles!  So my parallel postulate is actually false:  If we
 think of lines as meridians of longitude, then there is no other line
 through the point that doesn't intersect the first line!

 "Wait."  He stops himself and thinks carefully for several minutes.
 You're afraid to interrupt him.  Suddenly, he starts laughing.  Soon
 he is laughing so hard he is doubled over, holding his stomach.  It
 takes him a few minutes to pull himself together.

 "I've been asking the wrong question!  The meridians of longitude
 don't prove my parallel postulate false; they just represent a
 different system of geometry!  The parallel postulate as I first
 stated it is true <span class="floydstyle em">on a flat plane</span>. The meridians of longitude
 help describe a 'parallel postulate' that would be true <span class="floydstyle em">on a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">sphere</span>!  You get a different system of geometry if you're on a
 flat plane versus a sphere!

 "The meridians of longitude were a brilliant suggestion!  I can't
 thank you enough, but please take this as a token of my appreciation."
 He hands you a copy of his <span class="floydstyle em">Elements</span>.

 "I've got to go write this down.

 "Hmmm...  No, on second thought I won't bother.  Trying to prove my
 parallel postulate will give mathematicians something to do for the
 next two thousand years!"

 Euclid walks down the winding path, laughing as he goes.

   a scribbled scroll
   your math book

>examine elements

 This is a copy of the <span class="floydstyle em">Elements</span> of Euclid.  It's actually
 divided into thirteen books.

>go down

 You make the somewhat less arduous trek back down the path.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Royal Road</span>
 This flat, paved road runs from southwest to northeast.  However, you
 also spot a steep path leaving the road and winding its way north up
 the hillside.

>go southwest


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Lyceum</span>
 You stand in the Lyceum, a collection of buildings and open spaces in
 ancient Athens.  There is a stadium to the west, a temple lies north,
 and you can see a private home with an ornate doorway to the east.  A
 road leads northeast out of Athens, and the rest of the city lies
 south.

>go east

 A force pushes back on you at the doorway.  You feel it testing your
 knowledge of geometry.  It seems to relent, grudgingly, allowing you
 to step into the private home.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 You are standing in the courtyard of a home in ancient Athens.  The
 owner does not appear to be about.  A passage leads down, and the
 Lyceum is to the west.

 In the middle of the courtyard stands a group of six elegant
 pedestals.

>examine pedestals

 Five of the pedestals are arranged in a circle around the sixth.  The
 pedestals are distinguished by their tops: The five on the outside
 have tops in the form of a large triangle, a medium-sized triangle, a
 small triangle, a square, and a pentagon.  The top of the pedestal in
 the center is in the shape of a circle.

>go down


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cave</span>
 Shadows dance along the wall of this dark cave, in the dim light
 filtering down from the courtyard above.  Pieces of broken chains lie
 scattered about the floor of the cave.

>examine pieces

 The chains are all in pieces.  Whoever was imprisoned here must have
 escaped.

>take pieces

 The broken chain pieces are all worthless; they are not worth
 bothering with.

 south.

>go south

 As you move south, you feel an electrical impulse course through you.
 The space around you seems to fold in on itself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Form</span>
 The space is now partially-formed, but it is still mostly unshaped
 matter.  Besides the way up to the manifestation of one, you can now
 sense several more "paths" through the void: north to the Lyceum,
 south to the Librarian's Office, east, and west to the Great Hall.

>go east

 You make your way east through the void.  As you do, you feel an
 electrical impulse course through you.  You find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scholar's Study</span>
 You are in the House of Wisdom in early-medieval Baghdad, standing in
 what appears to be someone's private study.  The walls are covered in
 intricate geometric designs, and a low table stands in the middle of

 The note reads,

 "Al-Khwarizmi,

 Our most recent investigations indicate at least two types of objects

 This square object was recently given to the caliph.  It appears to be
 of the latter type.  Please examine it and let us know what you
 discover of it."

 Instead of a name, the note is signed with the first few digits of π:
 3.1415.

 There is also a postscript: "By the way, thank you for the hint on
 your problem with the balances.  I had not realized that the weight of
 an object has nothing to do with that object's color."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scholar's Study</span>
 You are in the House of Wisdom in early-medieval Baghdad, standing in
 what appears to be someone's private study.  The walls are covered in
 intricate geometric designs, and a low table stands in the middle of
 the room.  A small room lies to the south, and the rest of the House
 of Wisdom is to the west.

 On the low table are a small coffer and a formal note.

>examine designs

 These designs consist of intricate combinations of squares, circles,
 and other geometric figures.  The overall structure of the patterns is
 clear to you, and you can make out several buttons hidden in the
 designs.

>examine buttons

 There are five buttons hidden in the geometric designs: a circular
 button, a button in the shape of two juxtaposed parentheses, a
 triangular button, a square button, and a pentagonal button.

 From here, south and west are the only possibilities.

>examine buttons

 There are five buttons hidden in the geometric designs: a circular

>go west

 As you move west, you feel an electrical impulse course through you.
 The space around you seems to fold in on itself.

 The space here feels much more formed than before.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Matter</span>
 The space here is now mostly formed, though the floor is still hazy.
 You can now see an inscription on the wall.  Several "paths" through
 the space are clear: up to the manifestation of one, north to the
 Lyceum, south to the Librarian's Office, east to the Scholar's Study,
 and west to the Great Hall.

>examine inscription

 The inscription reads,

 "Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.
  Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,
  And lay them prone upon the earth and cease
  To ponder on themselves, the while they stare
  At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
  In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
  Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
  From dusty bondage into luminous air.
  O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,
  When first the shaft into his vision shone
  Of light anatomized! Euclid alone
  Has looked on Beauty bare.  Fortunate they
  Who, though once only and then but far away,
  Have heard her massive sandal set on stone."

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a sapphire gem
   a square root
   a white ring
   <span class="floydstyle em">Elements</span>
   a scribbled scroll
   your math book

>go up

 You make your way up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">One</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place, but it gives
 you a sense of unity, wholeness, and beginnings.  A hole leads back up
 to the positive axis.  You sense another exit, too - one in a deeper,
 "downward" direction from this space.

>go up

 You make your way up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Positive Axis: 1</span>
 You find yourself in a deep dark blue - almost black - expanse of
 space that extends as far as you can see in all three dimensions.  The
 space is broken up by the straight, flat white line floating in
 mid-air that you are standing on.  The line begins here and stretches
 out of sight to the east.  The number 1 is marked on the line.  While
 the line doesn't appear to be supported by anything, there is a hole
 in the middle of it here, next to the 1.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Positive Axis: 2</span>
 You are in a dark blue expanse of space, standing on a white line that
 stretches to the west and as far as you can see to the east.  The
 number 2 is marked on the line here.  There is a hole next to the 2
 large enough for you to climb down into.

>enter 2

 You can't see any such thing, at least as described.

>enter hole 2

 I didn't understand that.  The first word or two on their own might
 suffice, though; perhaps it would work to just enter the hole.

>enter hole

 You clamber down the hole.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Two</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place, but it's
 marked by a feeling of duality, as if it somehow contains opposites
 within itself.  The only exit is a hole leading back up to the
 positive axis.

>go up

 You make your way up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Positive Axis: 2</span>
 You are in a dark blue expanse of space, standing on a white line that
 stretches to the west and as far as you can see to the east.  The
 number 2 is marked on the line here.  There is a hole next to the 2
 large enough for you to climb down into.

>go east

 You walk along the positive axis for a while, tracing the passage of
 the tip of the white wand.  You see marks for 3, 4, 5, and larger
 numbers.  There are no holes or anything else featured on this part of
 the positive axis, though, and you soon decide return to the 2 mark.

 the line doesn't appear to be supported by anything, there is a hole

>go west

 You can see absolutely nothing in the blue darkness off the positive
 axis.  Stepping off it doesn't sound like a good idea.  Going down is
 an option, though.

>throw ring w

 I didn't understand that.  The first word or two on their own might
 suffice, though; perhaps it would work to just throw the white ring.

>throw ring

 You really shouldn't take out your frustrations on the white ring.

>examine ring

 This ring is white and is in the shape of a one-eyed adder biting its
 tail.  The adder's eye is a dark sapphire.  The ring has the word
 "Identity" inscribed along the outside.

>put ring on line

 Putting things on the positive axis would achieve nothing.

>wear ring

 You put on the ring.  The word "Identity" on it glows briefly before
 fading.  The ring enlarges slightly - just enough to slip off your
 finger.  Then the ring shrinks back to its original size.

 north.

 An acolyte is here, silently cleaning up the area around the statue.

 and you can see a private home with an ornate doorway to the east.  A
 road leads northeast out of Athens, and the rest of the city lies
 south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple of Number, Southern End</span>
 You stand in the southern end of the Temple of Number.  The temple is
 made of white stone and features imposing Ionic columns.  There is an
 inscription on the wall, the rest of the temple is to the north, and
 the exit to the Lyceum is south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Temple of Number, Northern End</span>
 You stand in the northern end of the Temple of Number.  The temple is
 made of white stone and features imposing Ionic columns.  Instead of
 the half-expected statue of Athena Parthenos, though, stands a large
 statue of Pythagoras.  Behind the statue is a small passageway heading
 north.

 An acolyte is here, silently cleaning up the area around the statue.

 You can also see a trash urn (in which is a scrap of papyrus) here.

 The acolyte pokes at a corner of the temple with her broom.

>give root to woman

 The acolyte is focused on her cleaning, and she ignores you.

 The acolyte gazes up at the statue with a reverent look on her face.

>examine statue

 This large statue of Pythagoras dominates the north end of the temple.
 A small passageway is behind the statue, leading north.

 The acolyte picks up a speck of dust from the floor of the temple.

>put root on statue

 Putting things on the statue of Pythagoras would achieve nothing.

 The acolyte polishes an already spotless part of the statue.

>put root on gem

 Putting things on the sapphire gem would achieve nothing.

 The acolyte picks up a speck of dust from the floor of the temple.

>look through gem

 You find nothing of interest.

 The acolyte gazes up at the statue with a reverent look on her face.

 and you can see a private home with an ornate doorway to the east.  A
 road leads northeast out of Athens, and the rest of the city lies

>go south

 As you move south, you feel an electrical impulse course through you.
 The space around you seems to fold in on itself.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Matter</span>
 The space here is now mostly formed, though the floor is still hazy.
 You can now see an inscription on the wall.  Several "paths" through
 the space are clear: up to the manifestation of one, north to the
 Lyceum, south to the Librarian's Office, east to the Scholar's Study,
 and west to the Great Hall.

>go up

>go up

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Positive Axis: 1</span>
 You find yourself in a deep dark blue - almost black - expanse of
 space that extends as far as you can see in all three dimensions.  The
 space is broken up by the straight, flat white line floating in
 mid-air that you are standing on.  The line begins here and stretches
 out of sight to the east.  The number 1 is marked on the line.  While
 the line doesn't appear to be supported by anything, there is a hole
 in the middle of it here, next to the 1.

>squeeze root

 That wouldn't make you feel any better.

>wear ring.

 You put on the ring.  The word "Identity" on it begins to glow, the
 ring enlarging as it does so.  Soon the ring slips off your finger.
 Yet it continues to grow, larger and larger, until it is large enough
 to encircle you.  Then the ring emits a dazzling flash of light, and
 you feel yourself <span class="floydstyle em">shift</span> as you are pulled into the space in
 the center of the ring.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Zero</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place.  Besides the
 hole leading up, you sense nothing here.

 Well, actually...  You can see an empty set here.

 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place.  Besides the

>go up

 You make your way up.

 Climbing through the hole, you enter what seems to be a mostly empty,
 dark blue expanse of nothingness.  The only thing you can see is the
 end of the positive axis off to the "east."  The enlarged white ring
 is resting on the axis.  Then the ring begins to roll toward you.  As
 it does, the ring widens and flattens until it is the width of the
 positive axis.  The ring rolls past the end of the axis, still heading
 toward you, but it is now <span class="floydstyle em">unrolling</span> as it goes, effectively
 extending the positive axis in your direction.  The end of the ring
 soon reaches you, at which point it ceases unrolling.  No traces that
 this new line segment was ever a ring remain.  With only a bit of
 hesitation, you step onto the new line.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Beginning of Positive Axis: 0</span>
 You are in a dark blue expanse of space, standing on a straight, flat
 white line that stretches as far as you can see to the east.  The

 hole next to the 0 large enough for you to climb down into.

 beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without

 <span class="floydstyle em">Proof that the Square Root of 2 is Irrational</span>

 Suppose the square root of 2 is rational.  Then it can be expressed as
 a fraction <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">y</span> in lowest terms, so that <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>
 and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> are integers with no common factors.  Since
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is the square root of 2, squaring
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">y</span> must yield 2, and so we get 2 = <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>² /
 <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>².  This means that 2<span class="floydstyle em">y</span>² = <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>².

 Since <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is an integer, so is <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>².  Since <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>²
 is 2 times an integer, <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>² must be an even number.  The only
 way that the square of a number can be even, though, is for the number
 itself to be even.  Thus <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> is even.  So <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> =
 2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>, where <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> is some other integer.

 Substituting 2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span> for <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, our equation now looks like
 2<span class="floydstyle em">y</span>² = (2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>)² = 4<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>².  Divide both sides by
 2
 to get <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>² = 2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>².  By the same logic as before, this
 means <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is even.  So <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> are both even.

 But <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> can't both be even because they have no
 common factors.  We now have a logical contradiction.  Since our
 supposition that the square root of 2 is rational leads to a logical
 contradiction, the only possibility left is that the square root of 2
 is, in fact, irrational.

 The acolyte picks up a speck of dust from the floor of the temple.

>recite proof

 I didn't recognize that command.  (There is a list of recognized
 commands in the HELP menus.)

>drop proof

 Dropped.

 The acolyte sweeps the area in front of the statue.

 Then the acolyte picks up the proof.  On her way to the trash urn, she
 glances at it.  Then she stops and reads through it carefully.  Her
 face tightens.  She shakes the proof at you, spluttering.  "This...
 this is blasphemy!  All things must be odd or even or a ratio!  You
 are in error!  I will show it to you!"

 She reads over the proof again.  "The error is here, in the second
 line.  No... the mistake is in the assumption that...  In this place,
 you can't claim that this follows from...  Aarrrgghh!  This proof is
 wrong!  I know it is!"

 She reads the proof a third time.  And then a fourth time.  The anger
 slowly fades from her face.  "How did you come by such sacred
 knowledge, and why, why did you share it with me?"  Tears drop onto
 her cheeks.  Giving you a last mournful glance, she runs sobbing out
 of the temple.

 Eudoxus was an ancient Greek mathematician.  He is most well-known for
 his method of exhaustion.

>look up exhaustion

 (in your math book)
 The method of exhaustion was a technique used by various ancient Greek
 mathematicians to find areas and volumes of geometric objects like
 circles, spheres, cones, and cylinders.  It can be thought of as a
 precursor to more modern techniques that use limits.

 An acolyte is here, silently cleaning up the area around the statue.

 You can also see a trash urn (in which is a scrap of papyrus) here.

 The acolyte polishes an already spotless part of the statue.

>drop proof

 Dropped.

 The acolyte sweeps the area in front of the statue.

 Then the acolyte picks up the proof.  On her way to the trash urn, she
 glances at it.  Then she stops and reads through it carefully.  Her
 face tightens.  She shakes the proof at you, spluttering.  "This...
 this is blasphemy!  All things must be odd or even or a ratio!  You
 are in error!  I will show it to you!"

 She reads over the proof again.  "The error is here, in the second
 line.  No... the mistake is in the assumption that...  In this place,
 you can't claim that this follows from...  Aarrrgghh!  This proof is
 wrong!  I know it is!"

 She reads the proof a third time.  And then a fourth time.  The anger
 slowly fades from her face.  "How did you come by such sacred
 knowledge, and why, why did you share it with me?"  Tears drop onto
 her cheeks.  Giving you a last mournful glance, she runs sobbing out
 of the temple.

>go north

 With the acolyte gone, no one prevents you from entering the
 passageway behind the statue.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inner Sanctum</span>
 This small room tucked away behind the statue of Pythagoras is made
 from the same pure white stone as the more public parts of the temple.
 It feels like a holy space.

 You can see an octahedron, Archimedes's staff, and some exhaustion
 sandals here.

 Achilles sits by the side of the race track with his head in his
 hands.

>give sandals to Achilles

 Achilles looks at the exhaustion sandals rather skeptically ("I always
 run barefoot," he says), but he agrees to try them.  After lacing them
 up, he snaps his fingers, and the tortoise appears.  They find their
 places as before, and take off.  Achilles runs to the halfway mark,
 looks up, and sees the tortoise ahead of him.  He notes the tortoise's
 new position, races to it, and sees the tortoise still ahead.
 Achilles doesn't give up, though, and every time he looks up he finds
 himself closer to the tortoise.  As they approach the finish, Achilles
 is so close to the tortoise you can't see much distance between them.
 However, the tortoise crosses the finish line just barely ahead of
 Achilles.

 The tortoise disappears again, and Achilles jogs back to you.  He
 returns the exhaustion sandals.  "Thanks for letting me try the
 sandals.  I felt myself almost overtaking the tortoise, but the
 sandals weren't quite enough."

>go down

 You make your way down.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 The darkness in this space feels different than simply the absence of
 light - both weaker and stronger, somehow.  You can still perceive
 yourself and what you're carrying, but a foot or so away from you the
 darkness seems palpable, almost alive.  You do sense an exit above
 you, though.

 You can just perceive a white mirror floating here in the darkness.

>examine mirror

 You would probably get a better look at the mirror if you were holding
 it.

>get it

 (putting the square root into the set to make room)
 You take the white-framed mirror from the darkness.

>examine it

 This mirror is not made of glass but rather of some tougher material.
 Encircling the mirror and forming its frame is a one-eyed white adder,
 although there is a small hole where the eye should be.  The word
 "Inverse" is inscribed on the bottom of the frame.

>put gem in mirror

 You push the sapphire gem into the eye hole of the adder on the
 white-framed mirror.  The sapphire glows briefly as it slides into
 place.

>go up

>inverse mirror

 Nothing happens.  Perhaps the mirror is activated some other way.

>look in mirror

 You look in the mirror and see an inverted image of yourself reflected
 back at you.  As you gaze at your image, the word "Inverse" on the
 mirror's frame begins to glow.  In response, your image in the mirror
 grows larger.  Soon your face fills the entire mirror.  You lean in
 closer, and your nose brushes the mirror's surface.  The mirror emits
 a dazzling flash of light, and you feel yourself <span class="floydstyle em">invert</span> as
 you are pulled through the mirror.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Negative One</span>
 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place.  You get a
 general feeling of opposition here.  The only exit is a hole leading
 up.

 You can see a phase inverter here.

>examine inverter

 This complicated mechanism appears to have a place to insert objects.

>get it

 The phase inverter does not appear to be portable.

   some exhaustion sandals
   a tetrahedron

     a scribbled scroll

>put sandals in inverter

 You briefly insert the exhaustion sandals into the phase inverter.
 The inverter hums as it adds π units to the essence of the exhaustion
 sandals.  If something has changed about the exhaustion sandals, it's
 difficult to see what.

>put coin in inverter

 You briefly insert the old coin into the phase inverter.  The inverter
 hums as it adds π units to the essence of the old coin.  If something
 has changed about the old coin, it's difficult to see what.

>go up

 You make your way up.

 As you climb through the hole, you enter the dark blue expanse of
 space surrounding the positive axis.  Off to the "east" you can see
 the back of the now-enlarged white-framed mirror, supported by nothing
 but standing upright just on the edge of the positive axis.  The top
 of the mirror begins to pivot towards you, while the bottom of the
 mirror remains where it is.  As the mirror continues to rotate, you
 see that it is reflecting a second copy of the positive axis.  This
 copy is rotating with the mirror, as if it is a ray of light bouncing
 off the mirror.  At the instant the mirror passes through the plane of
 the positive axis, the mirror disappears!  The reflected copy of the
 positive axis remains, though, passing right by you and running as far
 as you can see to the "west."  You feel fairly comfortable stepping on
 the now fully-formed number line.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Number Line: -1</span>
 You are in a dark blue expanse of space, standing on a white line that
 stretches as far as you can see from west to east.  The number -1 is
 marked on the line here.  There is a hole next to the -1 large enough
 for you to climb down into.

 the room.  A small room lies to the south, and the rest of the House
 of Wisdom is to the west.

 On the low table are a small coffer and a formal note.

 The note reads,

 "Al-Khwarizmi,

 Our most recent investigations indicate at least two types of objects

 This square object was recently given to the caliph.  It appears to be
 of the latter type.  Please examine it and let us know what you
 discover of it."

 Instead of a name, the note is signed with the first few digits of π:
 3.1415.

 There is also a postscript: "By the way, thank you for the hint on
 your problem with the balances.  I had not realized that the weight of

 (in your math book)
 Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, scientist, philosopher, and
 theologian.  He is known for constructing one of the first mechanical
 calculators, for his work in projective geometry, and for his work in
 hydrodynamics.  A unit of pressure is named after him, as is the
 triangle of numbers known as "Pascal's triangle."

 Pascal was also one of the founders of the field of probability.
 While his initial work in probability was to solve gambling problems,
 he applied his insights to other areas of human knowledge as well.
 For example, <span class="floydstyle em">Pascal's wager</span> consists of one of the first uses
 of expected values.  In it, Pascal argues that, in the absence of
 conclusive evidence as to the existence of God, the payoffs for
 believing in God (infinite happiness if God exists, nothing if God
 does not) versus not believing in God (eternal damnation if God
 exists, nothing if God does not) are such that it is more reasonable
 for humans to bet on belief in God.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grassy Area</span>
 This is a grassy area between buildings at some university.  Dusk is
 falling, and no one else is around.  There is a log table at the edge
 of the grassy area.  It looks like there is a small laundry facility
 in the building to east, and a gate lies south of you.

 Someone has left their trigonometry homework on the log table.  A
 slide rule is lying next to the trig homework.

 On the grass lies a funny-looking soccer ball.

>examine soccer

 Something about this soccer ball doesn't look quite right.

>examine table

 This wooden table was constructed from several large logs.

 On the log table are the trig homework and a slide rule.

>examine homework

 The homework is covered with equations involving sines, cosines, and
 tangents.  There are also a couple of graphs drawn on the homework,
 labeled "sin <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>" and "cos <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>."  Each graph consists of
 a wavy line that switches from positive to negative every Pi units.
 Circled at the top of the homework is the phrase "Review
 Logarithms!!!"

>examine slide

 The slide rule consists of three pieces of wood: the two on the
 outside are attached to each other, while the third - in the middle -
 can slide between the other two.  Numbers are marked on all three
 pieces of wood.  You have no idea how to use a slide rule.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Laundry Room</span>
 This small laundry room, presumably for student use, contains a single

 The sign is handwritten in black ink.  It reads, "The dryer won't
 tumble, and the washing machine is completely broken.  Won't anyone
 fix anything around here?!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">West of House</span>
 You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a

 There is a small mailbox here.

>examine mailbox

 The mailbox is closed.  It has a small hole in it.

>open it

 The mailbox is closed tight.  You can't see how to get it open.

>examine hole

 The small hole contains screw threads that are oriented
 counterclockwise.

>examine door

 There are boards over the front door, but the boards look somewhat
 rotten.  There is also an inscription on the door.

 The inscription reads,

 "You have to spend some energy and effort to see the beauty of math."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Living Room</span>
 This is the living room of the white house, and it looks to be the

 you hear a faint <span class="floydstyle em">click</span>.  Then you hear a voice.  You're not
 sure where it's coming from, but it sounds like Professor Glasser.

 The voice says, "Euclid's <span class="floydstyle em">Elements</span> is the most influential
 mathematics book of all time.  Containing numerous results on geometry
 and number theory, and used as a textbook for over 2000 years, its
 logical, deductive approach has also served as a model for how pure

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Casino</span>
 Your senses are assaulted by the gleaming lights and jangly sounds of
 this casino.  An interesting poker game is going on to the north of
 you, while the casino's exit appears to lie to the east.

 A gaming machine near you catches your eye.

>examine machine

 This gaming machine has the words "TOP TWO GAME" written across its
 side.  There are several buttons on the machine, each with a different
 label.

 White: "Instructions."
 Black: "Start New Game."
 Green: "Accept Current Number."
 Orange: "Reject Current Number."
 Red: "Reject Next 10 Numbers."
 Blue: The label for the blue button has been torn off.

 The screen currently reads, "Press white button for instructions, or
 press black button to start a new game."

>press white

 You push the white button.  The screen clears, and the following text
 appears.

 "In this game you will be presented with 100 numbers, one at a time.
 For each number you are presented, you must decide whether to accept
 it or reject it.  Once you reject a number it is gone and you cannot
 go back and select it.  Once you accept a number the game ends.

 You win the game by having the number you selected be one of the two
 largest numbers out of the 100 total numbers.

 Hint: The best strategy for this game gives you a greater than 50%
 chance of winning."

 The instructions disappear from the screen, and it once again reads,
 "Press white button for instructions, or press black button to start a
 new game."

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Poker Game</span>
 You stand next to a poker table in the casino.  The lights and noise
 here are just as overwhelming as in the rest of the casino.  The
 gaming machine is to the south.

 Pascal, Bayes, Kolmogorov, and Diaconis are here, playing an intense
 game of poker.

>examine poker

 Which do you mean, the poker game, the poker cards, or the poker
 table?

>game

 You watch the poker game for a while.  Pascal is making huge wagers
 and winning big.  Bayes is trying to use prior knowledge of previous
 hands to plan his strategy, but that doesn't seem to be working out
 too well for him.  Kolmogorov appears to be more interested in
 constructing some elaborate theory of poker than winning; not
 surprisingly, he is losing as well.  Diaconis is dealing, and he is
 winning more than losing.  Cards fly out of his hands as if by magic.

>examine cards

 They look like a standard set of poker cards.

>examine table

 This is a standard casino poker table.  The only thing somewhat
 unusual about it is that its top is five-sided.  Pascal, Bayes,
 Kolmogorov, and Diaconis are playing an animated game of poker at the
 table.

>go south

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Physician's Office</span>
 Judging from the odd assortment of medical instruments scattered
 around this room, you are in the office of some Renaissance-era
 physician.  You can leave the office to the north.

 There is a strange mechanism in the center of the office.

 You can also see a parchment and a square piece of metal here.

>examine parchment

 This is a small, square piece of parchment.  Written on the parchment
 are a couple of equations:

 2<span class="floydstyle em">A</span> + <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> = 5<span class="floydstyle em">Y</span> + 8<span class="floydstyle em">Z</span>,

 3<span class="floydstyle em">B</span> - <span class="floydstyle em">Z</span> = 7<span class="floydstyle em">C</span> + 4<span class="floydstyle em">Y</span>.

>examine metal

 (the square piece of metal)
 This small, square, flat piece of metal has five rectangular holes cut
 into it.

>get it

 Taken.

>examine mechanism

 This mechanical device contains, among other things, a turnable crank,
 three interlocking gears, a metal bar attached to one of the smaller
 gears, and an access panel.

>examine crank

 It's fairly large.  It looks like you could probably turn it.

>examine gears

 The two smaller gears have about half the radius of the large gear.

>examine bar

 This bar is attached to one of the smaller gears.

>examine panel

 The access panel is closed.

>open it

 You open the access panel.

 Inside is some complicated machinery.  A sine wave is intertwined with
 the machinery.

>examine wave

 The sine wave goes up and down and up and down and up and down...

>turn crank

 You turn the crank, which causes the two small gears to rotate around
 the large gear.  As the small gears rotate, they move the metal bar
 back and forth in a straight line.

 Then the strange mechanism emits an aura of positive power that fills
 the room.  You briefly feel happier, as well as more optimistic about
 your chances on tomorrow's exam.

>get wave

 You carefully take the sine wave from the strange mechanism.

>turn crank

 You turn the crank, which causes the two small gears to rotate around
 the large gear.  As the small gears rotate, they move the metal bar
 back and forth in a straight line.

 Nothing else happens (although converting rotational motion to linear
 motion is pretty cool in and of itself).

>examine instruments

 You search through the medical instruments, but they all look more
 painful than useful.  One does say, "Property of G. Cardano" on it,
 though.

>look up cardano

 (in your math book)
 Girolamo Cardano was a practicing physician, mathematician, and
 inventor: a true Renaissance man.  His inventions include the Cardan
 gear, used to convert rotational motion to linear motion, and the
 Cardan grille, an early cryptographic technique in which secret
 messages are revealed by placing a thin sheet with holes cut out of it
 over a paper containing an ordinary-looking message.  Cardano also
 contributed to the development of (and sometimes is credited with the
 invention of) the combination lock.

 Mathematically, he was the first person to make systematic use of
 negative numbers.  His work features the first use of complex numbers,
 too, as well as the first published solutions to the general cubic and
 quartic equations.

 You place the piece of metal on the scribbled scroll, but you can't
 seem to align it in such a way that letters clearly show through the
 holes.

 The space around you seems to fold in on itself.

 You place the piece of metal on the parchment, aligning it so that it
 covers the parchment completely.  Through the holes you can see five
 letters: "XYZZY."

 She looks a lot like the college librarian - except older, more
 translucent, and, well, grayer.

>greet ghost

 "Hello?" you say tentatively, unsure of the proper greeting for a
 ghost.

 "Hello!" she replies.  She looks at you carefully.  "You know, you've
 got enough running around in your head right now."  As an aside she
 adds, "I suppose that includes me."

 Shimmering slightly, she continues.  "Anyway, I'm here to help you
 organize your thoughts.  Show me any possession of yours, and I'll
 tell you whether I think it will still be useful for you.  Go on.  Try

 (putting the slide rule into the set to make room)
 The gray lady looks carefully at the scribbled scroll.  Then she says,
 "I'm not sure you'll have any more use for that."  She takes the
 scribbled scroll from you and places it in the gray storage bin.  "If
 you ever want it back, though, feel free to just take it," she adds.
 "I might be wrong."

>turn crank

 You turn the crank, which causes the two small gears to rotate around
 the large gear.  As the small gears rotate, they move the metal bar
 back and forth in a straight line.

 Then the strange mechanism emits an aura of negative power that fills
 the room.  You briefly feel more depressed, as well as more
 pessimistic about your chances on tomorrow's exam.

 For just a moment, the square root glows, as it absorbs the negative
 power emitted by the mechanism.

>examine root

 This is an unusual object.  It appears to be made of some tough

 Someone has left their trigonometry homework on the log table.

 On the grass lies a funny-looking soccer ball.

>examine homework

 The homework is covered with equations involving sines, cosines, and
 tangents.  There are also a couple of graphs drawn on the homework,
 labeled "sin <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>" and "cos <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>."  Each graph consists of
 a wavy line that switches from positive to negative every Pi units.
 Circled at the top of the homework is the phrase "Review

>examine ball

 Something about this soccer ball doesn't look quite right.

>kick it

 The soccer ball remains still, and your foot connects with a solid
 "thud."  As the ball flies through the air it begins to transform,
 becoming less round and more pointed.  It bounces off one of the
 buildings and rolls across the grass, coming to a stop near you.  You
 look down to see an object that is no longer quite a soccer ball.

>examine it

 The icosahedron has twenty sides, each of which is in the shape of an
 equilateral triangle.  It kind of looks like a more pointy version of
 a soccer ball.  In fact, you realize that if you cut its vertices off
 in the right way and inflated it to make it more round you would have
 a soccer ball.  This icosahedron is about one cubic foot in volume.

>get it

 You take the icosahedron.  Looking curiously at it, you note that it
 has twenty sides, each of which is in the shape of an equilateral
 triangle.  You feel you understand three-dimensional solid geometry a

>show rule to achilles

 (first taking the slide rule)
 Achilles frowns.  "I don't see how that will help me beat the
 tortoise."

>look up achilles in math

 The story of Achilles and the tortoise is a paradox related to the
 nature of infinity.  It was devised by Zeno of Elea.

 In the paradox, Achilles is racing a tortoise who is given a head
 start.  Zeno claims that Achilles can never catch up to the tortoise
 because "In a race, the quickest runner can never overtake the
 slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the
 pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead."

 The paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, as well as Zeno's paradoxes
 in general, are important in mathematics because they helped force
 mathematicians to consider carefully what they mean by continuous
 quantities that are infinitely divisible, as well as infinity itself.

 Some mathematicians believe that the limit concept, which not only
 provides a rigorous method for handling infinite quantities but also
 put calculus on a firm theoretical foundation, resolves the paradox of
 Achilles and the tortoise.  However, limits were not developed until
 over 2000 years after the death of Zeno.

 A large bronze box lies on the side table.

 The Countess is here, fiddling disgruntledly with the bronze box.

>show rule to countess

 You show the slide rule to the Countess.  "This is an interesting
 device," she says.  "Do you know how to work it?"  You shake your
 head, and she returns the slide rule to you.

>look up slide rule

 (in your math book)
 The only mention of slide rules in the index refers to a unit on
 logarithms, so you turn to that section.

 A logarithm is a function whose output is an exponent or power.  For
 example, the base 10 logarithm of 1000 is 3, since 10^3 is 1000.

 The earliest practical use of logarithms was to convert a
 multiplication calculation to an addition calculation via the
 logarithm property log(<span class="floydstyle em">xy</span>) = log <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + log <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>.
 The slide rule operates on this and other properties of logarithms.

 (There follows a detailed description of how to work a slide rule to
 do multiplication using logarithms.)

 Using the example, you practice with the slide rule until you
 understand how to use it to do multiplication.

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your understanding of Logarithms has increased.  You estimate</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">that your score on tomorrow's final has just gone up by two</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">points.]</span>

>show rule to countess

 You show the slide rule to the Countess, and you carefully explain to
 her how to use it to do multiplication.  She immediately grasps the
 concept.  "With this, I don't need to fix my mechanical calculator!
 Do you mind if I have it?"  You give your assent, and the Countess
 smiles widely.

 "If this does multiplication, it could also do division."  She begins
 playing with the slide rule.  "And it should be able to calculate
 powers of a number."  She performs a few more calculations on the
 slide rule.  "Yes!" she says.  "Here, let me show you what I've done."

 As the Countess explains how to use the slide rule to do division and
 exponentiation, you realize that she is essentially showing you two
 more logarithm properties: log(<span class="floydstyle em">x/y</span>) = log <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> - log
 <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>, converting division to subtraction, and log <span class="floydstyle em">x^n</span> =
 <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> log <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, converting exponentiation to
 multiplication.

 "Thank you so much for the slide rule.  What an ingenious device and
 valuable gift!" she says.  "I must reciprocate!"  She produces a small
 bell from somewhere and rings it.  A servant rushes in, and the
 Countess whispers something to him.  The servant disappears, but he
 soon returns, hands a book to the Countess, and disappears once more.

 The Countess gives the book to you.  "This is a wide-margin copy of
 Diophantus's <span class="floydstyle em">Arithmetica</span>.  We used to have a copy with narrow
 margins, too, but we gave that one to Fermat."

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your understanding of Logarithms has increased.  You estimate</span>

>examine arithmetica

 This is a copy of Diophantus's <span class="floydstyle em">Arithmetica</span>.  As the Countess
 indicated, it does have wide margins.

>look up fermat

 (in your math book)
 Pierre de Fermat was a contemporary and sometime rival of Descartes.
 He was the greatest number theorist of his era, invented analytic
 geometry about the same time as Descartes (but did not publish his
 results), and his method of tangents was a forerunner to the
 derivative concept used in calculus.  Fermat was actually a lawyer and
 did mathematics for fun in his spare time.

 Fermat is most well-known for his conjecture that become known as
 "Fermat's Last Theorem":  There do not exist solutions in nonzero
 that <span class="floydstyle em">a^n</span>  + <span class="floydstyle em">b^n</span> = <span class="floydstyle em">c^n</span>.  In his copy of
 Diophantus's <span class="floydstyle em">Arithmetica</span> Fermat claimed to have found a
 "truly remarkable proof of this theorem which this margin is too
 narrow to contain."  No one has ever found Fermat's proof, and,
 despite an enormous amount of effort, nobody succeeded in proving it
 themselves until 1995, more than 350 years later.

 You put Diophantus's <span class="floydstyle em">Arithmetica</span> on the bookcase.  As it
 slides into place you hear a faint <span class="floydstyle em">click</span>.  Then you hear the
 same voice as before - the one that sounds like Professor Glasser.

 The voice says, "Diophantus's <span class="floydstyle em">Arithmetica</span> introduced symbols
 to the study of the solutions of equations, in contrast to the prior
 method of writing everything out in words.  The book itself discusses
 a variety of techniques for solving what we would now call algebraic
 equations.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Arithmetica</span> is also famous (or perhaps infamous) for a note
 Fermat once wrote on his copy of the book.  The note conjectures that
 there do not exist solutions in nonzero integers <span class="floydstyle em">a</span>,
 <span class="floydstyle em">b^n</span> = <span class="floydstyle em">c^n</span>.  Then Fermat writes, 'I have discovered a
 truly remarkable proof of this theorem which this margin is too narrow
 to contain.'  No one has ever found Fermat's proof.  This conjecture,
 which became known as "Fermat's Last Theorem," was not actually proved
 until 1995, more than 350 years later, using mathematical techniques
 far more sophisticated than the ones available to Fermat in the
 mid-1600s."

 You overhear the phrase "optimal stopping problem" amidst the loud

 The screen clears, and it once again reads "Press white button for

 <span class="floydstyle note">[Your understanding of Probability has increased.  You estimate</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">that your score on tomorrow's final has just gone up by four</span>
 <span class="floydstyle note">points.]</span>

>look up optimal stopping

 (in your math book)
 An optimal stopping problem is one in which you are faced with the
 problem of when to take a particular action in order to maximize a
 reward or minimize a cost.

 The most famous optimal stopping problem is the <span class="floydstyle em">secretary</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">problem</span>: You want to hire a secretary.  You have <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>
 candidates, and you interview them one-by-one.  After each interview,
 you must decide whether to hire or reject the person you just
 interviewed.  You cannot go back and hire a candidate you have already
 rejected.  If you want to maximize your chances of hiring the best
 person for the job the optimal strategy turns out to be to
 automatically reject the first <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> candidates and then hire the
 next candidate after that who is better than all of the candidates you
 have seen thus far.  Surprisingly, if <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> corresponds to the
 first <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">e</span> (in other words, the first 37% of)
 candidates, then the probability of selecting the single best
 candidate out of the entire <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> candidates is about 37%.

 If you want one of the two best candidates instead, then you can get
 above a 50% chance using a similar strategy.  In fact, there's a wide
 range of values of <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> that work well in the top two case.  For
 example, if <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> is 100, then any choice of <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> between
 22 and 39 will give you a better than 50% chance of selecting one of
 the two best candidates.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Barn</span>
 The pleasant smell of fresh hay mingles with the less pleasant smells
 of farm animals here.  The barn opens outside to the south.

 A farmer is here, staring thoughtfully at a pile of wood.

>examine wood

 It's just a pile of wood to you, but it must mean something to the
 farmer.

>examine farmer

 The farmer is wearing blue overalls and a wide-brimmed hat.

>greet farmer

 "Hi," you say, and the farmer turns to look at you.  "Howdy," he
 responds.  "What are you doing?" you ask.

 He says, "Well, I was just thinking about the water barrel I'm going
 to make out of this wood.  I'm trying to decide whether it should be
 short and fat or tall and skinny."

 "Why does it matter?" you ask.

 "Well, I'd like it to hold as much water as possible.  Does a short,
 wider barrel hold more water?  Or does a tall and thin one?  Or would
 it be better to make the barrel somewhere in between?  Oh, and the
 barrel will have a lid.

 "I've got this far," he says, pulling a thin card and a pencil from an
 inside pocket of his overalls.  He scribbles an equation on the card,
 puts the pencil back in his overalls, and hands the card to you.  "If
 you take the equation on this card and plug the radius of the barrel
 in for <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, the value of <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> will tell you the resulting
 volume of the barrel."

 You take the card.  "Don't you need this?" you ask.

 "No," he says.  "The card was junk mail - part of a promotion for some
 theme park.  And I've got the equation memorized, too."

>examine card

 This small, very thin card reads "Farmer's Problem: <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> =
 50<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> - Pi*<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^3."  You remember that <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>
 represents the volume of the barrel the farmer is trying to build,
 while <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> represents the radius.

>go south

 Before you can leave, you hear what sounds like a cowbell ringing.
 The farmer grimaces.  "Bessie's probably got herself tangled in the
 barbed wire again," he says.  "I ought to go check on her."

 Just then, a dog comes running into the barn, barking excitedly.
 "Yes, I heard," the farmer says to the dog.  "I'm going."

 He turns to you.  "If you can figure out the best solution to my
 barrel problem, I would be much obliged.  I need to go help Bessie
 now, but Pennings here can bring me anything with the solution on it."

 The farmer strides out of the barn.

>examine dog

 Pennings is a Welsh Corgi.  He wags his tail happily but expectantly
 when he sees you looking at him; he seems to want you to give him
 something.

 Pennings licks your face happily.

 This ornate stone fountain in the center of the court is its most

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">College Chapel</span>
 You stand in the magnificent chapel of Trinity College.  You make a
 mental note to visit this place sometime when you're truly awake.  The
 exit is to the south.

 At the west end of the chapel stands a statue of Isaac Newton.

 A beam of light shines through a window and forms a circle on the
 floor.

>s statue

 I only understood you as far as wanting to (go) s up.

>examine statue

 This statue in white marble depicts Newton holding a prism as he gazes
 upward.

 You can't help but be reminded of the lines in Wordsworth's
 <span class="floydstyle em">Prelude</span>, describing this very statue:

 "The antechapel where the statue stood
  Of Newton with his prism and silent face,
  The marble index of a mind for ever
  Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone."

 Wait - did Newton just wink at you?

>examine prism

 The prism, like the rest of the statue, is made of marble.  The
 ambient light in the chapel seems to play across the surface of the
 prism.

>examine beam

 This beam of light shines through a window and forms a circle on the
 floor.

>examine circle

 The light in the circle seems to sparkle.

 In response, the statue of Newton nods almost imperceptibly in the
 direction of the circle of light on the floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Court</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">College Hall</span>
 You walk into the middle of a lecture on mathematics.  The atmosphere
 feels a bit tense.

 The speaker glares briefly at you as you enter, and you - somewhat
 sheepishly - step back into the shadows against the wall.

 The speaker continues.  "And so, as I was saying, the calculus of
 Newton does not rest on a logical foundation!  Newton claims that the
 fluxion of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 is 2<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, but one cannot have the
 "infinitely small quantity" he uses in the calculation equal to zero

 You hear several "Boo" shouts from the audience.  "Go back to Oxford,
 Berkeley!" says one mathematician.  "But calculus works!" yells a
 physicist.
 physicist.
 "I repeat myself," replies Berkeley.  "A quantity cannot be
 simultaneously equal to zero and not equal to zero.  As Newton himself
 says, 'The minutest errors are not to be neglected in mathematics!'"

 You can feel the audience's anger level rising, as Berkeley quotes
 Newton in his attack on Newton's calculus.

 Then, after a tense few moments, a man in the front row storms the
 podium.  The shocked look on Berkeley's face is visible from your
 place against the wall.  Berkeley slowly backs away from the podium.
 Emboldened, several other audience members join the first man.
 Berkeley turns and runs out of the room.  The rest of the audience
 rises and chases after him.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">College Hall</span>
 The normally-impressive great hall, with its wood paneling and
 Tudor-style interior, is in a state of disarray in the wake of
 Berkeley's lecture.  A podium stands at the front of the room.  The
 great court lies to the east.

 In his haste to flee the crowd of angry mathematicians, Berkeley has
 left his lecture notes on the podium.

>examine notes

 These are Berkeley's notes describing what he considers to be serious
 logical flaws in the theoretical foundation of calculus.  The notes
 are rather extensive, but the details of his attack on the fluxion of
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 catch your eye.

 "Newton says that the fluxion, or derivative, of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 is to be
 calculated like so: Adding the infinitely small quantity o to
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> causes <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 to become (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+o)^2.  Then
 (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+o)^2 expands to <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 + 2o<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + o^2.
 Subtracting <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 from the expansion of (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+o)^2 gives
 us 2o<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + o^2.

 "The next step in the procedure is to divide by the infinitely small
 quantity o, producing 2<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + o.  Newton says now that since o
 is infinitely small we can ignore it.  This means that the fluxion of
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 is 2<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.

 "However, is the 'infinitely small quantity' denoted 'o' equal to zero
 or not?  If it is zero, then we cannot divide by it, since there is no
 meaning to dividing by zero.  If it is not zero, then we cannot ignore
 it in the last step, and so the fluxion of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 cannot be
 2<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.

 "You cannot have it both ways: Either o is equal to zero or it is
 not!"

>get them

>look up berkeley

 (in your math book)
 Along with John Locke and David Hume, Bishop George Berkeley is
 considered part of the trio of great British empirical philosophers of
 the 17th and 18th centuries.  His major contribution to mathematics
 was his critique of the logical foundations of calculus.  This
 critique helped inspire mathematicians to look more closely at what
 they meant by the "infinitesimally small" quantities used in calculus,
 ultimately leading to a precise definition of the limit concept.
 Incidentally, the main campus of the University of California and the
 surrounding city are named for him.

>look up limit

 (in your math book)
 The limit is one of the most important concepts in mathematics.
 Limits allow us to define exactly what we mean by concepts like
 "arbitrarily large" and "infinitesimally small."

 Limits had been used implicitly in calculus since the time of Newton
 and Leibniz, but it was not until over 150 years later that the
 definition of a limit was made precise by Weierstrass, thereby placing
 calculus on a more solid theoretical foundation.  Limits are also used
 to make sense of sequences and infinite series.  Some argue that
 limits resolve Zeno's paradoxes.

>ride bike

 You mount the laser bike.  A door slides open in the east wall, and,
 without warning, the laser bike shoots through it!

 You briefly catch a glimpse of a grid laid out before you, with
 intersection points, lines connecting them, and several ramps
 scattered throughout the intersections.  A mechanical voice intones,
 "Starting new game.  Illuminate all grid lines.  Intersections will
 not be illuminated.  One ramp jump allowed."

 Then the bike launches into space, coming down in...

 <span class="floydstyle i">Intersection</span> (on the laser bike)

 An Euler circuit is a path through a graph that traverses every edge
 exactly once.  Euler proved that the only graphs that have Euler
 circuits are those whose vertices all have an even number of
 connections.  The key idea behind this is that every time you go
 through a vertex you must enter by one edge and leave by a different
 edge, thus traversing two edges.  In order to have an Euler circuit,
 then, the total number of edges incident on each vertex must be even.

 "Descartes's Roller Coaster and Water Ride: Experience the thrills of
 cutting-edge analytic geometry!

 "With our proprietary technology, we can change the shape of the track
 to any algebraic curve!  We feature a new curve each month, so ride
 often!

 "For special events such as birthday parties and weddings we can even

 Underneath, in smaller print, are some disclaimers: "Riders should be

 The roller coaster consists of a track mounted on a grid-like frame
 marked with coordinates.  For the horizontal - or <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> -
 coordinates, the entrance is marked at 0, and the numbers increase as
 you go east.  For the vertical - or <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> - coordinates, the
 water line is marked at 0, and the numbers increase as you go up.

 The roller coaster track starts high, goes through a loop-the-loop,
 enters the water, and returns to the platform.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Operator's Office</span>
 The roller coaster operator's office is a small, dingy affair.  The

>examine correspondence

 You read through the correspondence.  It's a series of letters from
 Fermat to Descartes.  The discussions center on Fermat's method of
 tangents, which Descartes criticizes.

 The final letter, though, is addressed to Fermat.  In it, Descartes
 claims that his new Folium curve is so complicated that Fermat's
 method cannot be used to find its tangent lines.

 The letter ends with Descartes asking rhetorically, "And you believe
 your method will still work?  I think not!"  The ink is blotted after
 the final sentence, as if the quill pen Descartes had been using was
 dropped abruptly.

 (in your math book)
 That topic is not listed in the index.

>look up derivative

 (in your math book)
 The derivative is one of the major concepts in calculus.  Roughly
 speaking, it gives a precise way to determine the ratio of two
 quantities as they become infinitely small.  Thus it can be used to
 measure rates of change, with applications like velocity,
 acceleration, and marginal cost.  It can also be used to find the
 slope, or steepness, of the graph of a function, as this can be
 thought of as the ratio of the vertical change in the graph of a
 function to a corresponding horizontal change.

 Another major application of the derivative is to find the maximum or
 minimum value of a function.  The maximum of a function occurs when
 the graph of the function switches from ascending to descending.
 Since the derivative is positive when the graph of a function is
 ascending, and the derivative is negative when the graph of a function
 is descending, at the maximum the derivative has a value of zero.  A
 similar scenario holds true for the minimum of a function.  In that
 case the graph of the function switches from descending to ascending,
 and so its derivative switches from negative to positive.  The value
 of the derivative at the minimum is also zero.  There are some other
 technicalities to consider, but this is the basic situation.

>derive card

 I didn't understand that.  The first word or two on their own might
 suffice, though; perhaps it would work to just derive.

>derive

 Nothing happens.  Perhaps you need to be holding an object to serve as

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Poker Game</span>
 Pascal, Bayes, Kolmogorov, and Diaconis are here, playing an intense
 game of poker.

>play poker

 (the poker game)
 You place the old coin on the poker table.  Diaconis gives you a pile
 of money in exchange for the coin, and then he deals the cards.

 You play several hands.  At first you lose more than you win, but
 thanks to your knowledge of probability, you find that you are pretty
 good at calculating exactly how strong your hand is and what would be
 a reasonable amount to bet for each hand.  As the game continues, your
 skill increases, and your calculations become more and more accurate.
 Even though you don't know what cards the other players hold, your
 ability to determine precisely both your hand strength and the optimal
 betting amount mean that, over time, you win much more than you lose.
 The other players start to drop out - first Kolmogorov, then Bayes,
 and then Diaconis.

 You and Pascal continue to play, each winning several hands.  Finally
 Pascal gets a hand he's very confident of.  "All in," he says, as he
 pushes the rest of his money to the center of the table.  Glancing at
 your cards, you decide to call his bet.

 Pascal, grinning from ear to ear, lays down an ace-high straight.  You
 slowly put one, then a second, a third, a fourth, and finally a fifth
 spade on the table.  Pascal's smile slides awkwardly off his face.
 You gather your winnings into a pile.

 Shaking his head, Pascal congratulates you, as do Kolmogorov, Bayes,
 and Diaconis.  The four of them get up from the table and walk off.
 As they leave, you hear Pascal berating himself to Bayes over his last
 bet: "I should have known better.  The only thing worth wagering all
 you have is infinite happiness."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">No Longer a Poker Game</span>
 You stand next to a poker table in the casino.  The lights and noise
 here are just as overwhelming as in the rest of the casino.  The
 gaming machine is to the south.

 A piece of paper is on the floor here.  It must have fallen out of
 someone's pocket.

 On the poker table are a pile of money and an old coin.

 The middle number in the last row has been smudged, and you cannot
 make it out.  Underneath the numbers is written: "Note to self: Start
 counting with row 0 and column 0, not row 1 and column 1."

>examine money

 The huge pile of money represents your winnings from beating Pascal,
 Bayes, Kolmogorov, and Diaconis at poker.  If this weren't a dream you
 would be rich.

>look under table

 You find nothing underneath the poker table.

>go south

 As you start to leave, something catches your eye.  You turn and see
 that the five-sided poker table is shaking.  The poker table begins to
 transform, shrinking while maintaining its pentagonal top.  Soon you
 are no longer looking at a poker table; you are looking at a
 dodecahedron.

>get dodeca

 (putting the correspondence into the set to make room)
 You take the dodecahedron.  Looking curiously at it, you note that it
 has twelve sides, each of which is in the shape of a regular pentagon.
 You feel you understand three-dimensional solid geometry a little
 better.

 You place the icosahedron on the small triangular top pedestal and
 step back.  As you do so, the air grows still.  Then a strong wind
 whips through the courtyard.  The five Platonic solids rise from their
 pedestals, rotating slowly. Then they begin spinning in the air,
 forming a single ring that revolves around and above the circular
 pedestal in the center.  They spin faster and faster - until you
 cannot distinguish them from each other.  Then, with a final loud clap
 and a blinding flash of light, the ring of solids collapses in on
 itself!  After your vision clears you look back at the pedestals to
 see a sphere resting on the circular one in the center.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Giant's Shoulder</span>
 You stand on the broad shoulder of a giant.  From this location you

 Sir Isaac Newton is here, gazing out over the landscape.

>greet newton

 Newton stares at you for a long time.  "You're on an epic Quest,
 aren't you?" he finally says.

 You nod in response.

 "I'm willing to assist you," Newton replies, "but if I give you my
 help now then you won't understand how to use it.

 "I want you to prove to me that you are worthy of my help.  Answer my
 questions, and my help is yours.

 "Two hints: (1) Each answer consists of a single word; you should
 ANSWER the single-word-answer.  (2) If you want me to repeat a
 question, TALK TO me.

 "Oh, and if you want to leave this place, just jump off the giant's
 shoulder.  Trust me on that."  Newton grins.

 "First question: There are three major concepts in calculus.  One is
 the limit, and a second is the integral.  What's the third?"

>answer derivative

 (to Isaac Newton)
 "That's correct.  The three major concepts in calculus are the limit,
 the derivative, and the integral.

 "In fact, the fundamental theorem of calculus, (cough, cough) which I
 first proved (cough, cough), shows that the derivative and the
 integral are inverse operations - kind of like addition and
 subtraction are inverse operations, but in a more complicated way.
 Limits get precisely defined much later, as mathematicians try to
 solve the theoretical problems with calculus pointed out by people
 like George Berkeley."

 Newton sighs.  "It pains me somewhat to say that 'derivative' and
 'integral' were not <span class="floydstyle em">my</span> terms - I preferred 'fluxion' and
 'fluent.'  But Leibniz won that particular battle."

 "Here's the second question: What's the primary graphical
 interpretation of the derivative?"

>answer tangent

 (to Isaac Newton)
 "No, that's not correct.  I'll repeat the question: What's the primary
 graphical interpretation of the derivative?"

>look up derivative

 (in your math book)
 The derivative is one of the major concepts in calculus.  Roughly
 speaking, it gives a precise way to determine the ratio of two
 quantities as they become infinitely small.  Thus it can be used to
 measure rates of change, with applications like velocity,
 acceleration, and marginal cost.  It can also be used to find the
 slope, or steepness, of the graph of a function, as this can be
 thought of as the ratio of the vertical change in the graph of a
 function to a corresponding horizontal change.

 Another major application of the derivative is to find the maximum or
 minimum value of a function.  The maximum of a function occurs when
 the graph of the function switches from ascending to descending.
 Since the derivative is positive when the graph of a function is
 ascending, and the derivative is negative when the graph of a function
 is descending, at the maximum the derivative has a value of zero.  A
 similar scenario holds true for the minimum of a function.  In that
 case the graph of the function switches from descending to ascending,
 and so its derivative switches from negative to positive.  The value
 of the derivative at the minimum is also zero.  There are some other
 technicalities to consider, but this is the basic situation.

>answer rate of change

 (to Isaac Newton)
 "No, that's not correct.  I'll repeat the question: What's the primary
 graphical interpretation of the derivative?"

>answer change

 (to Isaac Newton)
 "No, that's not correct.  I'll repeat the question: What's the primary
 graphical interpretation of the derivative?"

>answer slope

 (to Isaac Newton)
 "That's correct.  The derivative measures the slope of the graph of a
 function - how steeply it is rising or falling.

 "So if the graph of a function is rising, its derivative is positive,
 and if it is rising sharply, its derivative is even more positive.
 Similarly, if the graph of a function is decreasing, its derivative is
 negative.

 "Next question: If a function's derivative is positive when the
 function is increasing, and the function's derivative is negative when
 the function is decreasing, what's the value of the derivative when a
 function is at its largest value?  At that place the function is
 neither increasing nor decreasing."

>answer zero

 (to Isaac Newton)
 "That's correct.  When a function crosses through its maximum, its
 graph switches from rising to falling.  Thus its derivative switches
 from positive to negative.  At the instant the function hits its
 maximum, its derivative must be zero.

 "Well, there are some other technical considerations, like if the
 derivative doesn't exist, but we don't need to go into those.

 "Last question!"  Newton grins mischievously.  "What have you seen in
 your travels - something not man-made - that has slopes?"

>answer sine

 (to Isaac Newton)
 "The sine wave you've seen does have slopes, but that particular one
 was made by Cardano.  Try again," Newton replies.

>answer hill

 (to Isaac Newton)
 Newton grins.  "Close enough," he says.

 Newton reaches out his hand toward the mountain range off in the
 distance and closes his eyes.  You follow the line of his outstretched
 hand, and you see the mountains moving - moving towards you.  Newton
 appears to be summoning them!

 Not sure of what you're seeing, you blink, shake your head, and look
 once more.  The mountain range off in the distance is gone.

 Instead, Newton is holding a toy model of a mountain range in his
 hand.  He gives it to you.  "Use this well," he says.  "It will
 transform the graph of a function into the graph of its derivative
 function."

 "A word of caution, though: this is only powerful enough to handle
 curves where <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is equal to some expression involving
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> - in other words, where <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is <span class="floydstyle em">explicitly</span>
 some function of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.  It will not handle situations in which
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> are merely related in some equation; i.e.,
 where <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> may be <span class="floydstyle em">implicitly</span> some function of
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.  (You need a more powerful technique, 'implicit
 differentiation,' for that.)

 "Also, remember what we've discussed: The derivative measures the
 slope of the graph of a function.  If you can find where the
 derivative function is 0, that should tell you where the original
 function hits its maximum.  If you would like a reminder of this, feel
 free to come back and speak with me again.

 "Finally, please return the mountain range when you're done with it."

 You jump off the giant's shoulder and hurtle toward the ground.  You
 hear Newton calling after you, "Don't forget to return the mountain
 range when you're finished with it!"

 It's a long fall.  You're falling, and falling, and falling...
 It's a long fall.  You're falling, and falling, and falling...And you

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Barn</span>
 Pennings the dog is here, looking expectantly at you.

>give finder to dog

 Pennings takes the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>-finder in his mouth and rushes out of
 the barn, his tail wagging happily.

 Soon he returns with the farmer, who has an interested look on his
 face.  "I just finished freeing Bessie," the farmer says.  "This looks
 promising!"

 He does some calculations, and his look of interest turns to surprise.
 "With a radius of 2.30329 feet, the height turns out to be 4.60659
 feet, which (other than a little rounding error) is exactly twice the
 radius!  And it gives a volume of 76.7765 cubic feet, which is better
 than any other volume I've been able to find!  How did you come up
 with this?"

 You explain about the derivative of a function, how it measures how
 steeply the graph of the function is ascending or descending, and how
 ascending means a positive derivative and descending means a negative
 derivative.  The you describe how the largest value of the barrel
 volume function occurs where its graph switches from ascending to
 descending - a location where the derivative of the function is zero.

 "And so," you say, "once I hit the water on the derivative track, the
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>-finder got stuck at the radius that gives the largest
 possible value for the volume of the barrel."

 "Impressive!" says the farmer.  "Most impressive."

 He turns to Pennings.  "Go on now," he says.  "Go.  There's a treat
 for you at the back door."  Pennings gives a happy bark and runs out
 of the barn.

 Thanking you profusely, the farmer returns the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>-finder to
 you and starts working on the pile of wood.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Research Lab</span>
 Wires and pieces of metal indicate that highly complex experiments
 must have once been performed in this room.  Now, though, they lie
 scattered haphazardly here and there: Someone has cleared this place
 out.  There are open doors to the north and south, and the exit to the
 lab lies east.  A door to the west is closed.

 Not all of the experiments are gone, though; near the west door is a
 platform, raised slightly off the floor.   A control panel is attached
 to the wall near the platform.

 There is also a large fan set into the east wall.

 A printout has fallen to the floor.

>examine wires

 There are several wires here, but none appear to be worth troubling
 yourself with.

>examine metal

 You are unsure what the pieces of metal are for, but they do not
 appear to be worth your time.

>examine platform

 Nothing is on the platform.

>examine panel

 The control panel is labeled "Transformation Matrix Prototype."  It
 features numbers in a 3 by 3 matrix.  Each number in the top row has a
 slider above it that controls the setting of that number.  The numbers
 in the second and third rows, though, seem to be fixed.  A button is
 next to the 3 by 3 matrix.

 The matrix currently looks like this:
  0  -1   0
  1   0   0
  0   0   1

>examine fan

 This is a large, industrial-strength wall fan.  You wonder what
 experiments it was used for.

 The wall fan is currently switched off.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Seminar Room</span>
 The seminar room is dominated by the large table running the length of
 it.  A small window in the north wall looks out onto a courtyard, and
 a door leads south back into the lab.

 On the seminar table are some presentation slides.

>examine slides

 There are seven pages to these slides.  If you want to look more
 closely at them you should read a particular page.

>read page 1

 The first page begins a discussion of three-dimensional transformation
 matrices.  It points out that the columns in a transformation matrix
 consist of the "inputs," while the rows consist of the "outputs."  For
 instance, the entry in column 1, row 2 indicates the effect of the
 first, or <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, dimension of the original object on producing
 the second, or <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>, dimension of the transformed object.

>read page 2

 Starting with the second page, there are some examples of
 three-dimensional transformation matrices.  The first involves the
 matrix
  1  0  0
  0  1  0
  0  0  1.
 The fact that the first row of this transformation matrix consists of
 1, 0, 0, means that, to produce the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the
 output object the matrix takes only the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the
 input object and multiplies each of them by 1.  The 0, 1, 0 in the
 second row means that, to produce the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates of the
 output object the matrix takes only the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates of the
 input object and multiplies each of them by 1.  The same is true for
 the 0, 0, 1 in the third row and the <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates.  This
 transformation matrix doesn't really do anything, then; since none of
 the coordinates are changed, the output object is the same as the
 input object.

>read page 3

 The matrix
  1  0  0
  0  1  0
  0  0  2
 simply doubles the <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates.  The output object would be
 twice as tall as the input object.

>read page 4

 The matrix
  1  0  0
  0  0  1
  0  1  0
 swaps the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates with the <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates,
 while keeping the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates the same.  An object would be
 transformed via this matrix to a mirror image of itself that is also
 lying on its side.

>read page 5

 The matrix
  1  1  0
  0  1  0
  0  0  1
 keeps the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates the same from the
 original object to the transformed object.  However, to create the
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the transformed object, it adds the
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates of the original object.  A cube,
 for example, would be transformed into an object that looks like a box
 that has been partially crushed so that its sides are at an angle.
 (Technically the transformed object is a parallelepiped, a
 three-dimensional version of a parallelogram.)  This kind of
 transformation is known as a <span class="floydstyle em">shear transformation</span>.

>read page 6

 The matrix
  1  0  0
  0  0  1
  0  -1 0
 keeps the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates the same from the original object to
 the transformed object, makes the <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates in the
 original into <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates in the new object, and turns the
 <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates in the original into negative <span class="floydstyle em">z</span>
 coordinates in the transformed object.  The effect of this is to
 rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise when viewed from the front.

>read page 7

 The final page mentions that combinations of these effects as well as
 other effects can be achieved by using different matrices.  A
 three-dimensional object can even be turned into a two-dimensional or
 even a one-dimensional object by using the appropriate transformation
 matrix.

 At the end of the final page is a brief description of one of the
 graduate student experiments involving transformation matrices.  Thus
 far the student has constructed a prototype that allows one to apply a
 transformation matrix to a physical object.  For the prototype the
 transformations that produce the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates
 are hard-coded; the user can only affect the transformations for the
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the new object.  In addition, only a few
 choices have thus far been implemented for the top row of the matrix.
 Finally, the transformation effect is thus far permanent only for
 objects made of lead.  Even for lead objects, though, the process
 seems to be permanent only once; subsequent transformations on a
 transformed lead object have so far only been temporary.  The current
 hypothesis is that the transformation process changes something about
 the lead object at the atomic level.

 "Unfortunately, I have some bad news.  Most of my funding has run out.
 While I have enough to support myself, I do not have enough left to

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Machine Room</span>
 Brass wheels, gears, knobs, and pipes emitting smoke are everywhere:
 This is a room out of some steampunk's dream.  The south end of the
 room opens onto a gold-colored path.  This path appears to be
 suspended in the air, with no apparent support, and to run for as far
 as you can see.  You may also exit west.

 The room is dominated by a large, complicated-looking machine in its
 center.

>examine machine

 This machine is just as steampunk as everything else here, although
 there are several parts to it that look at least somewhat
 recognizable.

 For one, the machine has a switch that can be set to "Sequence" or
 "Series."  It is currently set to "Sequence," although you could
 easily move it to the other setting by flipping the switch.

 There is a button labeled "Alternate" that is currently pushed off.

 The machine also has a dial that can be set to "Constant," "Identity,"
 "Squared," or "Reciprocal."  It is currently set to "Constant."

 There is a small circular hole near the button.

 Finally, there is a warning light on top of the machine.  The warning
 light is dark.

>examine hole

 The circular hole is empty.

>go south

 As you approach the golden path you take a look at it.

 The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It
 consists of golden steps that seem to run on forever.  Each step has
 two numbers appearing on it, although from here you can only read the
 numbers on the six closest steps.  The first numbers on the steps are
 all the same: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1.  The second numbers are the same
 as the first numbers: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1.

 Just before you reach the path, though, it shifts: The heights of the
 steps change.  The first step is now up.  After that, though, the path
 is level with the first step.

 You step onto the path and follow it for a while.  It seems to stretch
 on forever, though, and so you eventually decide to turn back.  As you
 step off the golden path back into the room with the complicated
 machine the path shifts once again: It returns to being level with the
 floor.

>switch switch

 You flip the switch to "Series."  Some of the numbers on the golden
 path change.  The warning light is still dark.

 4, 5, and 6.

 Just before you reach the path, though, it shifts: The heights of the

 evenly, each step just as much of an upstep as the previous one.  In
 fact, the path looks like a set of stairs.

 You step onto the path and follow it for a while.  It seems to stretch

 Cauchy is sitting at the bar, sipping from a glass of wine.

 Weierstrass is next to Cauchy, drowning his sorrows in a pint of beer.

>greet cauchy

 You walk over to Cauchy.  "Are you guys O.K.?" you ask.

 Cauchy looks up from his wine.  "Hello," he says.  "Weierstrass and I
 were just commiserating on the state of our research programs."

 Weierstrass snorts.  "Cauchy is being kind.  I don't have a research
 program!  I need an important problem to solve, something to show the
 mathematical world I'm capable of more than teaching high school.  Not
 that there's anything wrong with that," he quickly adds, "but it would
 be nice to have a university position.

 "Cauchy, though, is already internationally famous.  He practically
 invented complex analysis, for one thing!"  Weierstrass falls silent,
 staring back into his mug.

>talk to weierstrass

 Weierstrass grunts at you in response before returning to his mug.

>talk to cauchy

 Cauchy says quietly, "I'm worried about Weierstrass.  I'm sure he's
 capable of being one of the great mathematicians of our age, but he
 needs the right problem to work on in order to prove it."

>look up weierstrass

 (in your math book)
 Karl Weierstrass, one of the great mathematicians of the 19th century,
 never actually completed a college degree.  He is particularly famous
 for his precise definitions of limits and continuity, which helped put
 calculus on a solid theoretical foundation.

>show notes to weierstrass

 Weierstrass lifts his head from his mug long enough to glance at the
 proffered notes.  He grunts and starts to return to his mug - but then
 he stops.  He takes the notes from you and reads through them.
 "Berkeley's criticisms of the foundations of calculus... Yes..."  He
 thinks for a while.

 Then he turns to Cauchy.  "The limit concept you've used in your work
 - I wonder if that would help here.  But it needs to be more
 rigorous."

 Cauchy and Weierstrass are soon deep in conversation, scribbling
 mathematical symbols and scratching them out again on a bar napkin.
 About all of the conversation you can follow are the words "function,"
 "distance," "error," and "limit," each repeated several times.
 Finally, Weierstrass says, "And if we use delta for 'distance' and
 epsilon for 'error,' that should do it!"  He pockets the napkin.

 Weierstrass looks at you excitedly.  "I think I've got some ideas that
 would put calculus on a sound theoretical footing!  This should make
 my name, mathematically-speaking.

 "I owe you more than I can say, but I don't know how best to reward
 you.  Perhaps I can improve something of yours with the power of the
 limit concept?"

>show sandals to weierstrass

 (first taking the exhaustion sandals)
 Weierstrass takes the sandals and looks at them carefully.  "These
 embody the principle of exhaustion, don't they?" he says.  Then he
 closes his eyes and concentrates for a moment.  The sandals begin to
 glow, and then they start to morph.  Soon Weierstrass is holding a
 pair of shoes in his hands.  "There," he says, opening his eyes and
 handing the shoes to you.  "I've improved your exhaustion sandals to a
 pair of limit shoes.

 "Thanks again," he says.  He stands up, an eager look on his face.  "I
 need to explore these concepts further.  I've got an idea for a

 Weierstrass downs the rest of his beer, places his mug on the bar, and
 walks out of the pub.  The bartender appears out of nowhere and whisks
 the mug away before disappearing again.

 Cauchy remains behind.  "Weierstrass has expressed his personal
 gratitude," he says.  "Let me offer my gratitude on behalf of
 mathematics as a whole.  Weierstrass mentioned earlier that I know a
 little something about complex analysis.  I can imbue an item of yours
 with the power of complex analysis, much as Weierstrass improved those
 sandals with the power of the limit."

 Cauchy looks carefully at you for a while, as if reading your

 Then Cauchy takes the toy mountain range and looks at it carefully.
 Then he closes his eyes and rubs his hands over it.  The mountain
 range begins to glow.  After a while Cauchy opens his eyes again, and
 the toy stops glowing.  "There," he says, handing the it back to you.
 "I've improved your toy mountain range.  It should be able to
 differentiate complex functions now.  However, unless you actually
 find a complex function the additional power won't be of any use.  I
 think I can reward you better than this."

 "Thank you, once again, on behalf of mathematics," Cauchy says.  "The
 discipline will be stronger if Weierstrass can put calculus on a more

 Achilles sits by the side of the race track with his head in his
 hands.

 "Do you think these will work any better than those sandals I tried
 earlier?"

>say yes

 (to Achilles)
 Achilles just looks at you miserably, and then he puts his head back
 down.

>give shoes to achilles

 Achilles looks at the limit shoes rather skeptically, but you assure
 him that these shoes are different - more powerful than the exhaustion
 sandals - and so he agrees to try them.  After lacing them up, he
 snaps his fingers, and the tortoise appears.  They find their places
 as before, and take off.  Achilles runs to the halfway mark, looks up,
 and sees the tortoise ahead of him.  He notes the tortoise's new
 position, races to it, and sees the tortoise still ahead.  You start
 to think that the limit shoes aren't going to do Achilles any good.
 About this time, though, their inherent virtue starts to kick in.
 Yes, there are infinitely many times Achilles must note the tortoise's
 position, leading to infinitely many distances he must run, but each
 successive distance is shorter than the one before.  The power of the
 limit shoes successfully sums the lengths of these infinitely many
 shorter and shorter distances, and Achilles passes the tortoise for
 the win!

 Achilles jogs back to the start, a huge grin on his face, and gives
 you a crushing hug.  Slightly abashed, he steps back, thanks you
 profusely, and returns the limit shoes.  He runs away to celebrate.

 As you're recovering from Achilles's excitement, Zeno walks over from
 where he has been discreetly watching the race.  He picks up the
 tortoise.  As he gazes quizzically at it, he's joined by Aristotle.
 They head off, arguing over whether the limit process actually solves
 the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise.  You notice something fall
 from Aristotle's robes.

 Aristotle has dropped a papyrus scroll here.

>examine scroll

 This scroll contains a discussion of logical fallacies.  Two prominent
 ones mentioned are "Affirming the Consequent" and "Denying the
 Antecedent."

 An example of "Affirming the Consequent" is the following argument.
 "If one drinks hemlock then they will die.  Thucydides is dead.
 Therefore, Thucydides must have drunk hemlock."  The first two
 statements are true, but the third is false.  The argument is invalid
 because there are other ways that Thucydides could have died than
 drinking hemlock.  In other words, the truth of the consequent, "they
 died," does not imply the truth of the antecedent, "they drank
 hemlock."

 An example of "Denying the Antecedent" is the following argument.  "If
 one writes the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span> then they will be famous.  Plato didn't
 write the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span>.  Therefore, Plato will not be famous."  The
 first two statements are true, but the third is false.  The argument
 is invalid because there are other ways that Plato could be famous
 besides writing the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span>.  In other words, the falseness of
 the antecedent, "one writes the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span>," does not imply the
 falseness of the consequent, "they will not be famous."

 In his relatively short life, Bernhard Riemann made several important
 contributions to mathematics.  His doctoral dissertation contained
 groundbreaking ideas in geometry and complex analysis.  He gave the
 first rigorous definition of the integral (one of the three major
 concepts in calculus).  He proved the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem
 for infinite series, and a conjecture of his - the Riemann hypothesis
 - is, over 150 years later, the most important unsolved problem in
 mathematics.

 Then a light twinkles at your feet.  You glance to the side to see
 another light blink briefly near you before disappearing.  A third
 light, off in the distances, flashes once.  More lights sparkle, and
 then more and more - until there are so many that you cannot even
 count them.  The deep dark expanse of space is no longer empty: It now
 contains a plane, stretching as far as you can see and filled with
 twinkling lights that look like stars.

 A curve appears, starting at your feet and continuing in a perfect arc

 As you approach the golden path you take another look at it.

 The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It
 consists of golden steps that seem to run on forever.  Each step has
 two numbers appearing on it, although from here you can only read the
 numbers on the six closest steps.  The first numbers on the steps are
 all the same: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1.  The second numbers are 1, 2, 3,
 4, 5, and 6.

 Just before you reach the path, though, it shifts: The heights of the
 steps change.  The first step is now up.  After that, the path rises
 evenly, each step just as much of an upstep as the previous one.  In
 fact, the path looks like a set of stairs.

 Then you walk out onto the path.  The limit shoes react to the contact
 with the first step: They propel you up to the next step, and to the
 next, and to the next - faster and faster.  Soon you are moving up so
 fast the path is a blur, and then you can't even see it anymore.

>lookup ramanujan

 (in your math book)
 Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of the most fascinating mathematicians of
 the early 20th century.  Mostly self-taught, and largely working in
 isolation from the world's mathematical community, he found creative
 and profoundly original solutions to outstanding problems in number
 theory and infinite series.

 Seeking a greater connection with that community, he sent his
 discoveries to several British mathematicians, most of whom dismissed
 his findings or simply returned his work with no comment.  However, G.
 H. Hardy recognized Ramanujan's genius and was eventually able to
 arrange for Ramanujan to come to Cambridge University.  There followed
 several years of fruitful collaboration with Hardy.

 Unfortunately, Ramanujan had health problems during his time in
 England.  He contracted tuberculosis and died at the age of 32, having
 spent only six years in Britain.  The 2015 biographical film <span class="floydstyle em">The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Man Who Knew Infinity</span> is about Ramanujan.

 inside it.  The clear button is labeled "Multiplicative Inversion,"
 and the crystal button is labeled "Grand Hotel."

 You don't understand much about your surroundings, but something feels

 As your hand closes around the patch of nothingness, it begins to
 transform.  Startled, you pull your hand back.  The nothingness
 continues transforming, finally taking on a slightly more corporeal,
 but still rather insubstantial, form.

 Ramanujan says, "You know, you should think carefully about that
 before you use it."

 you a little assistance.

 elegant staircase spirals down.

 The desk clerk points his fountain pen at the guest register and says,
 "Increment!"  Then he runs over to the double doors, opens them just
 enough to let the next person in line into the lobby, closes them
 again, and runs back to his desk.  The guest wanders off into the
 depths of the hotel.

 You walk over to the desk clerk.  He glances up, a frantic look on his

 "Sorry; we don't have any rooms available."  He points at the guest
 register, where you can see rooms numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, with
 a guest name next to each number.  "We do have infinitely many rooms
 in this hotel, but they're all booked."  Then he points to the line of
 people outside.  "I've also got infinitely many people lined up
 outside wanting a room.

 "I'm getting rooms for the people outside by incrementing everyone who
 already has a room to the next higher-numbered room.  That leaves Room
 1 available for the new guest.

 "Since I can only make one room available at a time, though, this is
 going to take literally forever.  At least when my shift is over I can
 hand the job off to the next clerk.

 "Now, if you'll please excuse me, I've got to get back to work."

 The booth is large enough for you to enter, and there are two buttons
 inside it.  The clear button is labeled "Multiplicative Inversion,"
 and the crystal button is labeled "Grand Hotel."

>push clear

 You push the clear button.  Some of the essence of the infinite space
 around you is sucked into the glass booth.  Then the glass booth flips
 upside down!  You briefly feel a moment of panic, until you realize
 that you are cushioned and enveloped by the essence surrounding you.

 The glass booth shudders for a moment, as if it is unsure exactly what
 to do.  Then it settles down, as if making a decision.  You feel

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Machine Room</span>
 The room is dominated by a large, complicated-looking machine in its
 center.

>examine machine

 This machine is just as steampunk as everything else here, although
 there are several parts to it that look at least somewhat
 recognizable.

 For one, the machine has a switch that can be set to "Sequence" or
 "Series."  It is currently set to "Series," although you could easily
 move it to the other setting by flipping the switch.

 There is a button labeled "Alternate" that is currently pushed off.

 The machine also has a dial that can be set to "Constant," "Identity,"
 "Squared," or "Reciprocal."  It is currently set to "Constant."

 There is a small circular hole near the button.

 Finally, there is a warning light on top of the machine.  The warning
 light is dark.

>set dial to reciprocal

 You turn the dial to "Reciprocal."  Some of the numbers on the golden
 path change.  The warning light is still dark.

>look up reciprocal

 (in your math book)
 The reciprocal of a number is its multiplicative inverse.  For
 example, the reciprocal of 7 is 1/7.

>examine path

 The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It
 consists of golden steps that seem to run on forever.  Each step has
 two numbers appearing on it, although from here you can only read the
 numbers on the six closest steps.  The first numbers on the steps are
 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6.  The second numbers are 1, 3/2, 11/6,
 25/12, 137/60, and 49/20.

>go south

 As you approach the golden path you take another look at it.

 The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It

 25/12, 137/60, and 49/20.

 Just before you reach the path, though, it shifts: The heights of the
 steps change.  The first step is now up.  After that, the path rises
 very gradually.  In fact, it's such a gradual rise that it's hard to
 tell whether the path is leveling out or continuing to climb.

 Then you walk out onto the path.  The limit shoes react to the contact
 with the first step: They propel you to the next step, and the next,
 and the next - faster and faster.  Soon you are moving so fast the
 path is a blur, and then you can't even see it anymore.

 This is more of an abstract space than a physical place.  It feels
 far, far beyond your understanding, though.  Even the language needed
 to describe it seems beyond your comprehension.

 You can see a large glass booth, about the size of an old telephone
 box.

 You can also see Srinivasa Ramanujan here.

 Ramanujan smiles at you.  "Well done," he says.  "The harmonic series,
 consisting of the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integers,
 rises extremely slowly.  Yet it does eventually become arbitrarily
 large, so that we can say its limit is infinity.

 "Now, to keep my promise.  Tell the desk clerk that he needs to double
 the room numbers in the register."

>enter booth

 You get into the large glass booth.

>push hotel

 You push the crystal button.  The glass booth begins to spin, slowly
 at first, but then faster and faster.  When the spinning stops the
 glass booth is gone, and you find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grand Hotel</span>
 The lobby of this sumptuous 1920s-era hotel dazzles the eye - crystal
 chandeliers, a marble floor, an ebony front desk complete with harried
 clerk.  A set of glass double doors leads outside to the west, and an
 elegant staircase spirals down.

 The desk clerk points his fountain pen at the guest register and says,
 "Increment!"  Then he runs over to the double doors, opens them just
 enough to let the next person in line into the lobby, closes them
 again, and runs back to his desk.  The guest wanders off into the
 depths of the hotel.

>talk to clerk

 "I'm sorry, but I don't have time to chat.  I've got to keep
 incrementing everyone who already has a room to the next
 higher-numbered room so that a new guest can take Room 1.  Now, if
 you'll please excuse me, I've got to get back to work."

 Once again, the desk clerk points his fountain pen at the guest
 register and says, "Increment!"  Then he runs over to the double
 doors, opens them just enough to let the next person in line into the
 lobby, closes them again, and runs back to his desk.  The guest
 wanders off into the depths of the hotel.

>say double

 (to the desk clerk)
 You walk over to the clerk and suggest that instead of incrementing
 each guest's room number he should double it.

 The clerk stops what he's doing and looks at you quizzically.  "Double
 them?" he asks.  "That's not what I was told to do.  Why should I do
 that?"

 "Ramanujan suggested it," you reply.  "<span class="floydstyle em">Ramanujan?</span>  Really?"
 He thinks for a while.  "This incrementing is going to take forever.
 All right.  I'll try doubling."

 He points his fountain pen at the guest register and says, "Double!"
 Each guest's room number doubles, so that if a guest has room number
 <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>, they now have room number 2<span class="floydstyle em">n</span>.

 "This leaves all the odd-numbered rooms available!" says the clerk.
 "And since there are infinitely many odd numbers..."

 He runs to the double doors and throws them wide open.  The line of
 people comes streaming into the lobby, and each goes off to take a
 different odd-numbered room.  Soon all of the people are gone.

 "Nice!  And thanks!" says the clerk.  "I think I'll take my break
 now."

 He grabs the guest register and walks off into the hotel.  It looks
 like you're now free to go through the double doors to the west.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grand Court</span>
 The courtyard, with its flowering trees and carefully-manicured lawns,
 is just as elegant as the interior of the grand hotel.  A set of glass
 double doors leads east into the hotel.

 One of the guests has dropped a short brass rod in the courtyard.

 number 69,105 written on it.

>put rod in machine

 The brass rod slides perfectly into the circular hole.  A mechanical
 voice intones, "Riemann Rearrangement Mode activated."

>look up riemann rearrangement

 (in your math book)
 The Riemann Rearrangement Theorem is one of the more unintuitive
 theorems in mathematics.  It says that for some types of infinite
 series, if you sum the terms in a different order you can get a
 different answer.  This is emphatically not true with usual
 arithmetic, where 3 + 5 = 5 + 3.  The Riemann Rearrangement Theorem
 applies only to what are known as <span class="floydstyle em">conditionally convergent</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">infinite series</span>.

>look up conditionally convergent

 (in your math book)
 A conditionally convergent infinite series has the following
 properties: (1) It consists of positive and negative numbers added in
 a series, (2) It sums (converges) to a finite value, and (3) If you
 make all the negative numbers in the series positive, the resulting
 series does not converge to a finite value.

 As you near the path, though, the seventh step swaps places with the

 Other steps swap places with each other, and you stop, watching, as
 the entire path appears to rearrange itself.

 Then a mechanical voice intones, "Rearrangement succeeded."

 You move towards the path once more.  Just before you reach it,
 though, it shifts: The heights of the steps change.  The first step is
 now up.  After that, some steps are up, and some steps are down, but
 you cannot discern any sort of pattern to which are up and which are

 There is an inscription on the wall, as well as exits up to Gray
 Matter, Level Three, north to the Smoky Pub, south to the Window into
 Oblivion, east to the Machine Room, and west to the Research Lab.

>go south

 You make your way south.  As you do, you feel an electrical impulse
 course through you.  You find yourself in...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Window into Oblivion</span>
 A tray is attached to the wall next to the window.

 Through the window you can see a flat, gray plane.  A pile of
 discarded objects lies a short distance away in the plane.  Standing
 near the pile, rocking back and forth and muttering to himself, is
 René Descartes.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   <span class="floydstyle em">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</span>
   the largest integer
   a logic scroll
   some limit shoes (being worn)
   a square root
   a set (no longer empty)
     Descartes's saying
     a printout
     a toy mountain range
     some correspondence
     the trig homework
     your math book

>put largest in tray

 You place the largest integer on the tray.  The tray beeps loudly, and
 a voice says, "Non-existence detected!"

 A door slides open in the wall, and a woman runs in.  She's holding a
 cell phone and is slightly out of breath.  The door closes behind her,
 leaving only a faint outline.

 "I'm so sorry," she says.  "Between my cell phone constantly ringing
 and all the cranks on the Internet, I just can't keep up like I used
 to."

 Turning to the tray, she picks up the largest integer.  "Hmmm." she
 says.  "This definitely does not exist.  How did you acquire it?  This
 was consigned to Oblivion at least by Archimedes's time.  Actually,
 never mind.  I bet one of the imps left it somewhere; they're not
 always reliable.  It's enough that we have it back."

 She makes a quick call on her cell phone.  An imp materializes, takes
 the largest integer from the woman, rematerializes outside the window,
 and drops the largest integer onto the pile.  Then the imp disappears.

 "Where are my manners?" the woman asks.  "I'm Hypatia, caretaker of
 Oblivion."

>greet hypatia

 "Thank you for returning the largest integer," Hypatia says.  "As you
 likely have already figured out, Oblivion is where we keep everything
 that doesn't exist.  I'm the caretaker.  This job was a sort of reward
 for being one of the few mathematicians martyred.

 "If you know of anything else that doesn't exist, please let me know,
 and I'll take care of it," Hypatia says.  "I also field questions
 about whether things exist."  She leans closer and whispers,
 "Occasionally we even make a mistake and consign something to Oblivion
 that actually does exist.  We don't really like to talk much about
 that, though."

 Hypatia's cell phone rings, and she answers it.  "No," Hypatia says.
 "I don't think there is an odd perfect number, either, but that proof
 isn't valid.  Please try again."  She hangs up.

>ask about descartes

 (to Hypatia)
 You point through the window at Descartes, who is still rocking back
 and forth and muttering to himself.

 Hypatia's eyebrows rise.  "What is he doing there?  That's a mistake;
 surely Descartes actually exists!"  She sighs.  "I've been too
 preoccupied."

 She thinks for a moment and then comes to a decision.  "I bet one of
 the imps did this, but I don't know which one, and I don't have time
 right now to sort this out.  If you can figure out why someone thought
 Descartes does not exist I'll do what I can to get him out of
 Oblivion."

 Hypatia's cell phone rings once more, and she answers it.  Hypatia
 listens for a while.  Finally, exasperated, she cuts the caller off.
 "No, no, no!  That doesn't work!  Besides, do you really think you're
 going to be the one to prove that there is no nontrivial solution to
 Riemann's zeta function with real part unequal to 1/2?  Far better
 minds than yours have worked on that and failed!"  She ends the call
 with an emphatic jab of her finger.

>show saying to hypatia

 (first taking Descartes's saying)
 Hypatia takes the saying from you.  "This means 'I think; therefore I
 am.'"  She thinks for a moment.  "Since the saying is about existence
 it might have something to do with one of my imps consigning Descartes
 to Oblivion.  But Descartes is deducing that he exists, not that he
 doesn't exist.  There must be more to it than this."  She returns the
 saying.

 Hypatia's cell phone rings again, and she answers it.  "I'm sorry, but
 I'm afraid I don't know how to say 'exist' in Old Gywndyngwah,"
 Hypatia says.  "I'm not familiar with that language."  She ends the
 call.

>greet descartes

 (René Descartes)
 Descartes looks up at you briefly, a request for help in his eyes.
 Then he grabs his head once more.  "I can't think here.  I can't think
 here," he mutters.

 Hypatia's cell phone rings again, and she answers it.  "God?!"
 Hypatia flashes a grin at you.  "Lots of people have tried, but as yet
 there is no conclusive proof that God does not exist."  She hangs up
 and turns to you conspiratorially.  "Don't tell anyone, but who do you
 think gave me this job?"

>inventory

     a printout
     a toy mountain range
     some correspondence

     your math book

 Hypatia's cell phone rings again, and she answers it.  "No," Hypatia
 says.  "You're likely right, but there's no proof yet that there is no
 polynomial-time algorithm for finding Hamiltonian cycles."  She hangs
 up.

>show scroll to hypatia

 Hypatia replies, "Yes, these are two well-known logical fallacies.
 What do they have to do with Descartes being consigned to Oblivion?"

 Hypatia's cell phone rings once more, and she answers it.  Hypatia
 listens for a while.  "No," she says.  "There are some intelligent and
 thoughtful people in the other political party."  She holds the phone
 away from her ear, and you hear angry ranting on the other end.
 Hypatia lets it go on for a while before she breaks in with "You might
 try spending less time on social media," before hanging up.  She turns
 to you.  "It seems like that has been getting worse lately."

>show saying to hypatia

 "Descartes's saying 'I think; therefore I am,' might have something to
 do with one of my imps consigning Descartes to Oblivion.  But
 Descartes is deducing that he exists, not that he doesn't exist.
 There must be more to it than this."

 Hypatia's cell phone rings again, and she answers it.  "Just because
 we haven't found life on other planets yet doesn't mean it doesn't
 exist," Hypatia says.  "Absence of evidence isn't evidence of
 absence."  She ends the call.

>show descartes to hypatia

 (Descartes's saying to Hypatia)
 "Descartes's saying 'I think; therefore I am,' might have something to
 do with one of my imps consigning Descartes to Oblivion.  But
 Descartes is deducing that he exists, not that he doesn't exist.
 There must be more to it than this."

 Hypatia's cell phone rings once more, and she answers it.  "No,"
 Hypatia says.  "I sympathize, but there are some honest lawyers."  She
 hangs up.

>show correspondence to hypatia

 (first taking the correspondence)
 Hypatia takes the correspondence from you and reads through it.  "This
 is interesting!  It appears the last thing Descartes did was write
 this letter to Fermat.  Perhaps it has something to do with why one of
 my imps consigned Descartes to Oblivion.  But why?"  She returns the
 correspondence.

 "Wait a minute..." Hypatia stops herself.  "'I think; therefore I am.'
 That's Descartes's famous saying.  What was that last phrase in
 Descartes's correspondence?  'I think not...'  Oh, no!"  She buries
 her face in her hands.

 When Hypatia raises her head again she has an exasperated look on her
 face.  "I think we both know what happened here," she says.  "I could
 order my imps to set Descartes free now, but there's no guarantee that
 they won't make this kind of mistake again.

 "I hate to ask you for something else, but I really need some evidence
 to show my imps that 'I think; therefore I am,' and 'I think not,' do
 not together imply 'I am not.'  If you can bring some evidence like
 that to me, I'll feel comfortable letting Descartes go."

 Hypatia's cell phone rings once more, and she answers it.  Hypatia
 listens for only a moment before she says, "Wait a minute.  You state
 that truth does not exist.  Yet that claim itself is a truth claim.
 You're assuming the existence of the very concept you claim doesn't
 exist!"  She hangs up emphatically and says to you, "I'll be so glad
 when the postmodernism fad passes."

>show scroll to hypatia

 Hypatia takes the logic scroll from you.  "Yes, these are two
 well-known logical fallacies.  And denying the antecedent is exactly
 the mistake that my imps made.  Well done!"

 Hypatia makes a call on her cell phone, and an imp materializes.  "One
 of you idiots consigned Descartes to Oblivion just because he said, 'I
 think not'!" Hypatia yells.  "Don't you fools even know basic logic?!"

 She hands the imp the logic scroll and begins tapping her foot.  The
 imp reads through the scroll.  He blanches.

 "Get Descartes out of there, now!" Hypatia orders.

 The imp disappears and then rematerializes on the other side of the
 window.  He grabs Descartes by the arm, and they both vanish.

 Hypatia turns back to you.  "Thank you for straightening that out,"
 she says.  "My imp will be returning Descartes to wherever he was
 before.  Hopefully we won't be seeing that kind of mistake again.

 "If you don't mind, though, I probably should get back to my
 computer."  She sighs.  "The Internet has brought out all of the
 cranks from whatever holes they normally hide in.

 "Speaking of which..."  She hands you a small object.  "People keep
 giving me these as gag gifts.  You might it useful.  Also, if you mess
 it up, bring it back, and I'll give you a new one.  Just knock on the
 door to get my attention."

 Hypatia presses a button on her phone, and the door in the west wall
 slides open.  She walks through it.  As the door closes behind her,
 she calls out, "You might want to check on Descartes; he will probably
 be grateful for what you've done!"

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">College Chapel</span>
 At the west end of the chapel stands a statue of Isaac Newton.

 A beam of light shines through a window and forms a circle on the
 floor.

 You can also see a sphere here.

>examine sphere

 This beautiful translucent sphere seems to sparkle as you gaze at it.

>look in it

 This beautiful translucent sphere seems to sparkle as you look into
 it.

>put sphere in circle

 (first taking the sphere)
 You place the sphere into the circle of light.  The beam of light
 passes through the surface of the sphere, refracting into a beautiful
 rainbow that shines across the statue of Newton.

 Once again, the statue grins at you, steps down off its plinth, and
 takes your hand.

 The chapel slowly fades from view, and you find yourself on...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Giant's Shoulder</span>
 You stand on the broad shoulder of a giant.  From this location you
 have a sweeping view of the surrounding landscape - a valley below
 with a lake in its center, surrounded by a forest.

 Sir Isaac Newton is here, gazing out over the landscape.

>give range to newton

 "Thank you," Newton says, as he takes the toy mountain range from you.
 He stretches out his arm, and the toy mountain range flies out of his
 hand, speeding away from the two of you.  You blink, and the when you
 look again you can see the snow-capped mountain range once more off in
 the distance.

 "I have one more thing for you," Newton says.  "You may find this
 useful."  Newton hands you a copy of his <span class="floydstyle em">Principia</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Mathematica</span>.

>thank newton

 I didn't recognize that command.  (There is a list of recognized
 commands in the HELP menus.)

>jump

 You jump off the giant's shoulder and hurtle toward the ground.  It's
 a long fall.  You're falling, and falling, and falling...
 a long fall.  You're falling, and falling, and falling...And you hit
 the ground back in the chapel of Trinity College.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">College Chapel</span>
 You stand in the magnificent chapel of Trinity College.  You make a
 mental note to visit this place sometime when you're truly awake.  The
 exit is to the south.

 At the west end of the chapel stands a statue of Isaac Newton.

 A gray, translucent ghost flits around the storage bin.

>show sphere to ghost

 The gray lady looks carefully at the sphere.  Then she says, "I'm not

 into place you hear a faint <span class="floydstyle em">click</span>.  Then you hear the same
 voice as before - the one that sounds like Professor Glasser.

 The voice says, "Newton's <span class="floydstyle em">Principia Mathematica</span> is one of the
 most important books on science ever written.  Its specific
 contributions include Newton's three laws of motion, his law of
 universal gravitation, and a derivation of Kepler's laws of planetary
 motion.  Perhaps even more important, though, is Newton's stunning
 demonstration of the power of mathematics in describing natural
 phenomena.  While the arguments presented in the <span class="floydstyle em">Principia</span>
 tend to be geometric, Newton did use many of the ideas of calculus
 (which he also invented) in order to derive his results."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Machine Room</span>
 The room is dominated by a large, complicated-looking machine in its
 center.

>examine machine

 This machine is just as steampunk as everything else here, although
 there are several parts to it that look at least somewhat
 recognizable.

 For one, the machine has a switch that can be set to "Sequence" or
 "Series."  It is currently set to "Series," although you could easily
 move it to the other setting by flipping the switch.

 There is a button labeled "Alternate" that is currently pushed on.

 The machine also has a dial that can be set to "Constant," "Identity,"
 "Squared," or "Reciprocal."  It is currently set to "Reciprocal."

 There is a small circular hole near the button.  A brass rod has been
 inserted into it.

 Finally, there is a warning light on top of the machine.  The warning
 light is dark.

>examine rod

 This brass rod is short and, for a rod, relatively thick.  It has the
 number 69,105 written on it.

>switch switch

 You flip the switch to "Sequence."  Some of the numbers on the golden
 path change.  The warning light is still dark.

>examine path

 The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It
 consists of golden steps that seem to run on forever.  Each step has
 two numbers appearing on it, although from here you can only read the
 numbers on the six closest steps.  The first numbers on the steps are
 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6.  The second numbers are 1, -1/2, 1/3,
 -1/4, 1/5, and -1/6.

>go south

 As you approach the golden path you take another look at it.

 -1/4, 1/5, and -1/6.

 As you near the path, though, the second step swaps places with the
 fifth step.  Then the sixth step swaps places with the first step.
 Other steps swap places with each other, and you stop, watching, as
 the entire path appears to rearrange itself.

 Then a mechanical voice intones, "Rearrangement failed."  The steps
 continue to swap places with each other for a while.  When they finish
 you realize from their numbers that they are back in their initial
 order.

 You move towards the path once more.  Just before you reach it,
 though, it shifts: The heights of the steps change.  The first step is
 now up.  After that, the second step is down, the third step is up,
 the fourth is down again, and so on, up, down, up, down... for as far
 as you can see.  Each down step looks like it goes below the level of
 the floor of this room, and each up step looks like it is above that
 level.  However, each down step isn't quite as far down as the one
 before, and each up step isn't quite as far up as the one before.
 After a while, despite the up and down steps, the path looks almost
 flat.

 Then you walk out onto the path.  The limit shoes react to the contact
 with the first step: They propel you to the next step, and the next,
 and the next - faster and faster.  Soon you are moving so fast the
 path is a blur, and then you can't even see it anymore.

 You find yourself hurtling through space, only to land in...

 path change.  The warning light is still glowing.

>examine path

 The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It
 consists of golden steps that seem to run on forever.  Each step has
 two numbers appearing on it, although from here you can only read the
 numbers on the six closest steps.  The first numbers on the steps are
 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36.  The second numbers are 1, -4, 9, -16, 25,

 You remove the brass rod from the circular hole.  A mechanical voice
 intones, "Riemann Rearrangement Mode deactivated."

>look up negative infinity

 That topic is not listed in the index.

>examine machine

 This machine is just as steampunk as everything else here, although
 there are several parts to it that look at least somewhat
 recognizable.

 For one, the machine has a switch that can be set to "Sequence" or
 "Series."  It is currently set to "Sequence," although you could
 easily move it to the other setting by flipping the switch.

 There is a button labeled "Alternate" that is currently pushed on.

 The machine also has a dial that can be set to "Constant," "Identity,"
 "Squared," or "Reciprocal."  It is currently set to "Squared."

 There is a small circular hole near the button.

 Finally, there is a warning light on top of the machine.  The warning
 light is glowing.

>push button

 You push the button off.  Some of the numbers on the golden path
 change.  The warning light is now dark.

>set dial to constant

 You turn the dial to "Constant."  Some of the numbers on the golden
 path change.  The warning light is still dark.

>examine path

 The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It

 all the same: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1.  The second numbers are the same
 as the first numbers: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1.

 The final page mentions that combinations of these effects as well as
 other effects can be achieved by using different matrices.  A
 three-dimensional object can even be turned into a two-dimensional or
 even a one-dimensional object by using the appropriate transformation
 matrix.

 At the end of the final page is a brief description of one of the
 graduate student experiments involving transformation matrices.  Thus
 far the student has constructed a prototype that allows one to apply a
 transformation matrix to a physical object.  For the prototype the
 transformations that produce the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates
 are hard-coded; the user can only affect the transformations for the
 <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the new object.  In addition, only a few
 choices have thus far been implemented for the top row of the matrix.
 Finally, the transformation effect is thus far permanent only for
 objects made of lead.  Even for lead objects, though, the process
 seems to be permanent only once; subsequent transformations on a
 transformed lead object have so far only been temporary.  The current
 hypothesis is that the transformation process changes something about
 the lead object at the atomic level.

 like self-similarity: Changing the scale on a fractal object often

 Fractal images are frequently created by iterating a function over the
 complex plane and assigning colors based on how rapidly the function
 diverges."

 away in all directions.

 Each splinter of light seeks out one of the twinkling stars in the
 complex plane.  The starry lights absorb the splintered ones and begin
 to pulse: blue, white, blue, white, blue, white...

 The pulsing ceases with each point in the complex plane settling on a
 color from midnight blue to the purest white.  Together they form a
 fractal pattern of infinite complexity, containing spirals throwing
 out tendrils that themselves contain spirals with tendrils... on and
 on.

 The fractal is blindingly, indescribably, painfully beautiful.
 The fractal is blindingly, indescribably, painfully beautiful.
 From somewhere you hear - but only in your mind - words once spoken by
 another:

 "Così la mente mia, tutta sospesa
  mirava fissa, immobile e attenta,
  e sempre di mirar faceasi accesa...

 "Oh quanto è corto il dire e come fioco
  al mio concetto! e questo, a quel ch'i' vidi,
  è tanto, che non basta a dicer 'poco'...

 "Qual è 'l geomètra che tutto s'affige
  per misurar lo cerchio, e non ritrova,
  pensando, quel principio ond' elli indige,

 "tal era io a quella vista nova...
  "A l'alta fantasia qui mancò possa."

 -----------  Translation  ----------

 "Thus all my mind, absorbed,
  was gazing, fixed, unmoving and intent,
  becoming more enraptured in its gazing...

 "O how scant is speech, too weak to frame my thoughts.
  Compared to what I still recall my words are faint -
  to call them little is to praise them much...

 "Like the geometer who fully applies himself
  to square the circle and, for all his thought,
  cannot discover the principle he lacks,

 "such was I at that strange new sight...
  Here my exalted vision lost its power."


 And you wake up.  You lie in bed for a while, thinking about what
 you've learned.
 you've learned.
 In the morning you get up and make your way to the exam.

 You walk into the classroom feeling supremely confident about your
 understanding of the material.  As the exam proceeds, the look on
 Professor Glasser's face goes from resignation to surprise to shock
 and finally to bemusement.  By the end you have answered every single
 question correctly.  Professor Glasser shakes your hand.  "I have
 never had a student earn a perfect score on one of my final exams,"
 she says, "much less one who skipped most of the class sessions!"  She
 pauses for a moment, thinking.  "You know," she says, "I could use a
 research assistant this summer.  I don't normally have undergraduates
 work with me, but since you did so well in my class...  Just think
 about it."

 A couple of weeks later you check your grades...

 You owe your roommate an apology about those study pills.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">*** With a score of 100 on the exam you earned an A+ in the course.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle i">General advice and encouragement</span>: Brian Rushton

 <span class="floydstyle i">Mathematics sources</span>: <span class="floydstyle em">A History of Mathematics</span>, by
 Victor J. Katz, was indispensable, as was Wikipedia.  (Wikipedia has a
 bad reputation for reliability, but I have found its mathematics pages
 to be quite good.  Information about historical figures obtained from
 Wikipedia was generally double-checked against other resources.)

 For further reading on the history of mathematics I recommend <span class="floydstyle em">Men</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">of Mathematics</span>, by Eric Temple Bell.  It's a bit old (1930s), but
 it's still the most lively and readable book on mathematicians and the
 history of mathematics that I know.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Interactive fiction inspirations</span>:  Infocom, of course.   <span class="floydstyle em">A</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Beauty Cold and Austere</span> contains references to or riffs on
 puzzles from several Infocom games: <span class="floydstyle em">Zork 1</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">Zork 2</span>,
 <span class="floydstyle em">Enchanter</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">Sorcerer</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">Spellbreaker</span>,
 <span class="floydstyle em">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">A Mind Forever</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Voyaging</span>, and <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span>, by Brian Moriarty, deserves special mention.  The
 structure of <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span> is somewhat repeated in <span class="floydstyle em">ABCA</span>,
 and the Klein bottle puzzle in <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span> was an inspiration for
 the idea of introducing advanced mathematical concepts through the
 medium of interactive fiction.  (Playing <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span> at age 13
 was my introduction to a Klein bottle.)  The crank puzzle in
 <span class="floydstyle em">ABCA</span> is of course a riff on the Klein bottle puzzle in
 <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span>.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Curses!</span>, by Graham Nelson.  After the demise of Infocom in
 the late 1980s, I mostly gave up playing interactive fiction for the
 better part of 30 years.  In February of 2017 I decided to try
 <span class="floydstyle em">Curses!</span>.  It inspired me both to take a serious look at
 "modern" interactive fiction and to write a piece of IF on my own.

 <span class="floydstyle em">GiantKiller</span>, by Peter D. Killworth, and <span class="floydstyle em">The Chinese</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Room</span>, by Harry Giles and Joey Jones.  When I was trying to decide
 what level to aim for with <span class="floydstyle em">ABCA</span>, these two games convinced me
 to go high.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Quotations</span>: "Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare" is by Edna
 St. Vincent Millay.
 The quote likening mathematics to a blind man in a dark room has been
 attributed to Darwin, but it's questionable whether he actually said
 that.
 The poem about infinite series is by, believe it or not, a
 mathematician: Jakob Bernoulli.
 "Tell all the truth but tell it slant" is by Emily Dickinson.
 The poem in Italian you hear after creating the fractal consists of
 selections from Dante's <span class="floydstyle em">Paradiso</span>, Canto XXXIII, as Dante is
 approaching his final vision of God.
