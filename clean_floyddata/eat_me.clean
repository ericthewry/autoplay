 My dear child, listen, and I'll feed you a tale. It begins with dinner
 denied. No bread, no butter, not even dessert. A mean repast by the
 meanest measure, enough to make a stomach grumble and an ill will
 stew. Enough to leave a tongue yearning for sugarplums.

 You know what's next. It's what happened. An offer, something sweet,
 something simple, and you swallowed. Children are such trusting
 people. What you ate grew into a hole deeper than mere hunger: it
 swallowed you. Now, just as you were served, you shall be served
 again.

 <span class="floydstyle header">Eat Me</span>
 A Story with Six Courses by Chandler Groover
 Release 1 / Serial number 171013 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (south cell)</span>
 Here you've been kept with only time to eat. All hours taste the same,
 but sometimes you can hear voices outside. They're always talking
 about food, how best to carve a joint or marinate a soul. "Inside a
 cell, of course," one voice had said, "till the despair's soaked
 through." Well, you've been marinating long enough, and waiting longer
 isn't likely to bring you freedom or, more importantly, supper.

 You've one companion in your cell: a little skeleton. Poor child, come
 to such an end, still shackled to the wall with candied chains. You're
 bound in cacao manacles yourself.

 Northward a cheesecake door leads out to the dungeon.

>examine me

 Your most important feature, and the reason that you're here, dear, is
 your mouth. All children are just mouths, of course, begging to be fed
 until they're bigger. Nothing else need be said on that account,
 except perhaps that your mouth is already big for a child. It is your
 personality. Forget your other attributes. You ate them when you first
 arrived, which is why you were invited.

>inventory

 You have a hole in your stomach, and you're wearing cacao manacles.

>examine hole

 All bargains have a price. This hole is yours. You swallowed it, and
 now you can swallow an endless feast. In fact, apart from
 <span class="floydstyle em">eat</span>, you'll find you can do little else. Filling your
 stomach's pit is all that matters anymore. But since it's bottomless,
 that might prove difficult.

>examine manacles

 When they were first clapped onto you, these cacao manacles were
 thicker than your arms. Not anymore. You've been licking. A few more
 bites should do the trick.

>examine skeleton

 You're not the first. Others have been tempted into this castle with
 sweet promises. Some come from poverty, some come from wealth, some
 come questing for admittance themselves. They hope to find what they
 can't find outside. All have an appetite, and most succumb.

>examine candied chains

 A few children need convincing to stay. A few children need more than
 convincing. When chains don't work, of course, there are other
 methods. This child has been convinced thoroughly.

>examine door

 You won't be going anywhere as long as this cheesecake door remains
 shut. It's baked from heavy cream, dense in the frame, with
 strawberries studding its smooth panels.

>eat manacles

 Cacao's bitter. Perhaps most children wouldn't chew it, but you're not
 a common child, are you, my darling? You won't remain locked in these
 manacles, especially not when your palate finds their bitter links
 delectable. You chomp them. Now they're almost broken: just one final
 bite.

>eat manacles

 That's done it. The cacao breaks and you gulp down every particle.
 Alas, although your limbs are free, you're just as hungry as before.
 That hole inside your stomach will need more to fill its gulf. What
 you want is a proper feast, something to pack yourself until you can
 forget what hunger even means.

>eat chains

 Unshackling this skeleton won't do its bones much good, but there's no
 reason not to treat yourself. Its chains are made from hard candy,
 each link a boiled sweet, with flavors ranging from lemon to raspberry
 and mint. You crunch them down, every last one. Your stomach still
 grumbles.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (south cell)</span>
 You've only one companion in your cell: a little skeleton. Even
 unshackled, the poor child makes a pitiable sight.

 Northward a cheesecake door leads out to the dungeon.

>eat skeleton

 You'll find no meat on these bones, dear. This child's been dead far
 too long. But a nibble wouldn't hurt to exercise the jaw. You gnaw
 away.

>eat skeleton

 Keep gnawing if it pleases you. They'll never sate your hunger, but
 these old bones won't protest. Their owner lost that power long ago.

>eat skeleton

 More gnawing still leaves you hungry.

>xyzzy

 You involuntarily swallow the sounds on your tongue.

>plugh

 Your words slip down your throat.

>plover

 When in doubt, <span class="floydstyle em">eat</span>.

>eat me

 First you put a finger in your mouth, and then your hand, and then
 your arm… you keep going until you've swallowed your entire body,
 filled your proportions out again with yourself slipped into yourself.
 Goodness, my dear, that looked uncomfortable. At least it's done no
 lasting harm.

 You see, that hole in your stomach already has you, doesn't it? And
 you already have it.

>eat all

 Be more selective, little one.

>eat door

 Dessert before dinner: that's every child's dream. We'll obey no order
 tonight! You pull out strawberries, pop them into your mouth, savor
 their crimson sweetness paired with silken cream. Soon you've eaten
 the cheesecake door. You'll have the feast you were promised, and no
 dungeon will hold you now.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon</span>
 Blue flambeaux undulate, and in their flames gleam devices galore
 constructed to pry screams and more from prisoners. Don't sit down on
 that judas chair. Steer clear the rack. Give wide berth to the
 breaking wheel. They're occupied already by corpses.

 A gruyère guard snaps to attention at your sight.

 Northward a corridor leads to the undercroft. Westward's an
 angel's-food doorway, eastward another door in devil's-food, and
 southward lies your open cell.

>examine guard

 Such a strapping gruyère guard. How handsome he looks armored in
 brined rind, capped with a knightly curdled helm. Perhaps he's not
 happy to see you out, but that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying his
 delicious company.

 "Thou villein!" says the gruyère guard. "Hie back into thy cell!"

>eat guard

 My valiant knight, here's a battle you'll lose. He's overwhelmed. He's
 never fought a hunger such as yours. "Avaunt! Avaunt!" he cries, but
 you've no intent to avaunt. Sumptuous gruyère, his flavor suggests
 rich earth, ripe fruit, piqued by his panic as you swallow him, armor
 and all.

 Now <span class="floydstyle em">that's</span> a snack.

>examine chair

 Where most chairs would have cushions this one's equipped with a
 pyramid chiseled from butterscotch. Anyone sitting on its tip would
 find pressure applied in the worst way, and likely never walk the
 same. Its current occupant certainly won't.

>examine prisoners

 Bless their little dead bodies. They couldn't have been older than you
 when they gasped their last. Five children altogether have perished in
 this dungeon, twisted on different devices. That trio tangled on the
 wheel could be mistaken for a single mass.

>examine rack

 Taffy's been stretched to fabricate this rack. Lock someone down and
 crank its lollipop handle: you'll have more taffy stretched in a
 jiffy. The corpse lashed to it now certainly didn't start this tall.

>examine wheel

 It is a cheese wheel, naturally: the grandest gouda ever carved to
 break mortal bodies. Heavy and hard enough to take a real beating
 along with the three children pinioned in its spokes. This gouda's
 seen some use.

>eat wheel

 Surely one nibble wouldn't hurt. Blood hasn't totally soaked it. You
 pick a crumb and place it on your tongue. Oh gouda, gouda, how good
 you can be, how creamy even put to such an employment. You're a light
 in this shadow-steeped dungeon.

>eat wheel

 You nibble the gouda wheel again.

>go west

 Angel's-food cake seals the doorway: one gigantic yellow slice.

>eat angel food

 Opening a door's unnecessary when you can eat it, especially a door as
 light and spongy as this one. Angel's-food cake floats upon your
 tongue. Each swallow is as effortless as inhaling fresh air. In no
 time you've devoured the entire slice.

>eat devil

 Who needs a key when you've got teeth and you're hungry? This
 devil's-food cake stands no chance. Moist chocolate crumbles in your
 mouth. Dense layers separate. You've eaten the whole door.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (west cell)</span>
 A woman's wasted corpse leans by one wall, almost buried with onions
 heaped around her head. This room's more root cellar than cell with
 all these bulbs piled inside.

 Eastward an open doorway leads to the dungeon.

>examine corpse

 Born with a silver spoon in her mouth, as you might guess from her
 looks. Still elegant and refined even after death's scraped her flesh
 down to near nothing. She certainly <span class="floydstyle em">perished</span> with a spoon in
 her mouth: it's still there, jabbed right down her throat. Impossible
 to eat with that impediment.

>examine spoon

 The only thing this spoon served was its own silver.

>examine onions

 Dependability: that's the onion. Whenever a plate's at a loss, just
 introduce one and you'll find its taste improved nine times in ten.
 Raw, roasted, caramelized, fried, grilled or minced: an onion's up for
 almost anything. But those are techniques for a chef. All you should
 do, my dear, is eat.

>take spoon

 Oh my, your body strains, darling, and the hole in your stomach yawns.
 You've made a bargain, remember, and now you live to eat. Eating is
 all you need to do. In fact, it's almost all you can.

>eat spoon

 Yanking the silver spoon out from her mouth, you shove it into yours,
 and down it goes without a hitch. Right now, darling, you should be
 thankful for your stomach's hole. A child with a less capacious gut
 would've just choked.

>eat onions

 As soon as you chomp into one, your eyes water. Your teeth crunch
 through crisp rings and onion fumes imbue your breath. Why, darling,
 with that stench held in your mouth, you could <span class="floydstyle em">blow</span> and you'd
 chase teardrops down cheeks. At least its odor should fade in a few
 moments.

 In the meantime, your <span class="floydstyle em">inventory</span> will hold what you're
 carrying.

>inventory

 You have a hole in your stomach, and you're holding an onion's odor in
 your mouth.

 eastward, and southward.

 Your breath's still reeking with onion.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (east cell)</span>
 Against one wall towers a pastry maiden with its cage ajar, and in
 that cage a skewered corpse has found its rest amongst toothpicks. Not
 the filling you'd want to bite into with most desserts.

 Westward an open doorway leads to the dungeon.

>examine maiden

 An iron maiden wouldn't do in this dungeon. Not when one could
 construct a cage as fearsome with pastry. It's massive and
 blood-crusted with a toothpick-spiked interior. Atop its bulk's
 sculpted a head with a disdainful attitude. You wouldn't wish her
 favor or embrace upon yourself.

 Now the odor in your mouth begins to dissipate.

>examine head

 An iron maiden wouldn't do in this dungeon. Not when one could
 construct a cage as fearsome with pastry. It's massive and
 blood-crusted with a toothpick-spiked interior. Atop its bulk's
 sculpted a head with a disdainful attitude. You wouldn't wish her
 favor or embrace upon yourself.

>examine corpse

 A peasant woman, by her dress, begrimed with dirty hands outstretched
 as though to scrape the pastry when its shell was shut. Little good
 that did with toothpicks stabbed through her top to bottom. Her flesh
 has long since shriveled to the bone.

 Soon the fumes in your throat will be gone.

>examine toothpicks

 Spikes large enough to spear someone, as this corpse demonstrates.

>eat them

 You'd taste nothing but onion with these fumes still on your breath.
 Before you eat again, you ought to <span class="floydstyle em">blow</span> them out.

 Time's done its trick: eaten the onion fumes you ate. Your mouth's
 perfectly clear again, your breath no more offensive than a breeze.

>eat them

 You'd pick your teeth more safely with a sword. Careful, careful where
 you angle your mouth. Try not to slice your gums.

>eat maiden

 Beware the spikes. A bite too close could prick your eye. You'll have
 to unpeel flakes with caution from the crust. One nibble here, another
 there, and still wonderfully buttery despite the blood.

>eat maiden

 You delicately peel another pastry flake, swallow it down.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Undercroft</span>
 Beware the steps you take, the sounds you make that might echo and
 draw unwanted attention. In this red-velvet undercroft, with his back
 turned, sits none other than Master Pokerounce carving a great cheese
 atop a cinnamon-stick stool. He's busy with the task, distracted for
 the nonce, but one false move and he'll have you tossed back into a
 cell where you belong.

 Westward lies the creamery, eastward the armory, and southward the
 dungeon.

 Your breath's still reeking with onion.

>blow

 You blow out the onion's tearjerking odor, and Master Pokerounce
 starts to rub his eyes. He's weeping, all right, but he's also
 glaring, and he climbs down from his wobbling stool, grabs your
 ankles.

 "Looks like we've got ourselves a sneak. Sneaks ain't welcome. It's
 back to the dungeon with you, and you'll stay put until she wants you
 out. Roast sneak, that's what you'll be. Only it's odd… Sir Gruyère
 should've been on guard. And what's happened to these doorways? No
 difference, I suppose. Long's I'm around, you'll sneak nowhere."

 He claps you back in manacles and dumps you in the southern cell
 again.

 Only one little skeleton remains inside this cell. Even unshackled,
 the poor child makes a pitiable sight, although you're not much better
 in your cacao manacles.

 No need to linger on particulars. You chomp the cacao manacles apart
 and swallow them.

>examine pokerounce

 Turnkey and grand inquisitor: that's our Master Pokerounce. Without
 him, who would man the cells, command the guards, coax tidbits from
 the prisoners? A wonder that he doesn't wobble, perched high on that
 stool with his breastplate abuzz, loaves for gauntlets and greaves,
 his skull enclosed by a pine-nut helmet. His beard might stand a
 little trim, gnarled galingale and ginger root, barely a face to see
 under that mass, but looks aren't what we measure to employ wardens
 and torturers.

>examine cheese

 Munster-géromé well brined, some meters tall, and more column than
 wheel, chiseled into a guardsman half-moulded. Pokerounce has been
 carving the figure as he carves every soldier, fashioned with its own
 rind for the armor.

>examine stick

 Perhaps he's ten heads taller than you are, but Pokerounce still needs
 height to carve the cheese's top. His stool's got cinnamon-stick legs
 that stretch longer than certain pikes.

 Master Pokerounce doesn't turn and you tiptoe behind his back.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Creamery</span>
 Runnels trace down the walls where cream has leaked through ceiling
 grates. Vats brim with souring milk. Mould carpets the room's corners,
 mushrooms in the damp, and whey dribbles from hanging cheesecloth
 bags.

 Eastward's the undercroft.

 Now the odor in your mouth begins to dissipate.

>examine grates

 All the milk that's collected here drips from the ceiling grates
 above. This castle's got a source that won't run low anytime soon.

>examine milk

 Sour milk's not too grand, granted, but it's one step toward crafting
 the grandest cheeses. It might look less than lovely. It might smell
 somewhat more pungent than fresh cream. But a romano's not made in a
 day.

 Soon the fumes in your throat will be gone.

 A veritable fungal forest's grown here high as your kneecaps,
 toadstools milk-drunk and pale white as the cream they've sprouted
 from.

 Time's done its trick: eaten the onion fumes you ate. Your mouth's
 perfectly clear again, your breath no more offensive than a breeze.

>eat mould

 How lustfully you root through these mouldy mushrooms! Anyone would
 take you for a pig after truffles. Whether you've found truffles or
 some other variety, you bite into their meaty flesh with the same
 eagerness.

>examine whey

 One cheesecloth bag bulges more than the rest.

>examine bag

 One cheesecloth bag bulges more than the rest.

>eat bag

 It doesn't take much jaw-strength to rip the cheesecloth: there's
 something inside waiting to slip out, and how it slips! Whey sloshes
 to the floor along with a body bloated from long containment in the
 bag.

>examine body

 Who knows how large this fellow was in life. His body's swollen like a
 sponge. His skin's slick and gelatinous. His face has puffed enough to
 lose what features constitute a face. Leave him alone, my dear. You've
 more enticing things to eat than corpses left to rot down here.

 Runnels trace down the walls where cream has leaked through ceiling

 cheesecloth bag.

 Eastward's the undercroft.

>examine bag

 All right, the body hasn't spilled <span class="floydstyle em">completely</span> out onto the
 floor. Although that's where the arms and torso sprawl, one foot's
 still tangled in the hanging, ripped cheesecloth. It's not a terribly
 delightful sight. We ought to move along.

>eat vats

 You bend to lap the milk as you would from a trough. It's rather
 thick, almost a sludge. As for the taste, sour's what you'd expect,
 and what you get.

 You aren't nearly tall enough to reach the ceiling, little one.

 "Ah, ah!" says Pokerounce, snatching your ankles again. "Don't court
 my displeasure. You won't want it. However you got out, you're going
 back."

 Here we are, returned to the dungeon, and there you sail, right back
 into the southern cell. Pokerounce dresses you once again in manacles.
 At least you're still alive, and that's something. Perhaps a more
 subtle approach would unseat our lovely warden.

>eat stool

 Before he's got the chance to blink, you bite into his stool. Oh, what
 a crunch! Your tongue prickles with spice, cinnamon sets your sinuses
 ablaze, and Pokerounce curses as he topples down.

 His breastplate cracks.

 Heavenly honey glimmers gold inside. He groans, can't sit or stand
 again, not with his body smashed, and out from his fractured
 breastplate swarm caramelized bees.

>eat honey

 A sting, a very palpable sting! Most peppers wouldn't sting as sharply
 as these caramel bees. Back down, darling. You'd need armor to
 withstand their ire.

>go east

 Master Pokerounce can't stop you now.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Armory</span>
 Inhale that wondrous mouldering stench: fine cheeses stacked in
 ripening rows. A monger's cellar wouldn't boast a breadth more
 noseworthy. There's brie and cantal, gloucester, blue stilton and red
 leicester, morbier, spermyse, and maroilles amongst others heaped deep
 in shadow.

 Westward's the undercroft, and upward a staircase curves to the
 eastern tapestry.

>examine cheeses

 There are enough cheeses stocked here to keep an army fed—or to carve
 one. It's good that you've disabled their master: otherwise you
 would've had his soldiers on your scent till kingdom come.

>eat cheeses

 Look around and choose a cheese.

>eat brie

 One bite has the brie running with marvelous luxury into your mouth.
 Such a mild personality, tinged with the lightest fruity notes, a
 sumptuous tang rounding out the aftertaste. Fold yourself in its
 pliant rind: now you're encased.

 Remember, my dear, you can check your <span class="floydstyle em">inventory</span> to see your

 You have a hole in your stomach, and you're wearing a brie rind.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Undercroft</span>
 Your ears buzz along with the bees above Master Pokerounce. He's
 crippled on the floor, breastplate cracked wide with honeycombs
 chambered inside, unable to piece himself back together. In this state
 he won't finish carving that munster-géromé.

 Westward lies the creamery, eastward the armory, and southward the
 dungeon.

 "I'll rip you… into little shreds," Pokerounce groans.

>eat honey

 Ah, that's more like it. Let the bees blunt their stingers. They'll
 never breach the brie rind you're wearing.

 Now you can strip Pokerounce's gauntlets, dip them into honey from his
 cracked breastplate. Allow his greaves to absorb golden sauce. His
 insides make an ideal spread, his toasted loaves an ideal bread to
 slather with that spread, and your mouth an ideal place to store them.

 "Don't think you'll… get away with this," he groans.

>inventory

 You have a hole in your stomach, and you're wearing a brie rind.

>eat honey

 Yank his helmet away. No need for it where you're headed, Pokerounce.
 He squirms as you break it between your teeth. Sweet as a pine nut
 ever was, with rich smoothness that snaps after encouragement from
 your molars.

 "She'll grind your bones!" he shouts.

>eat honey

 "Ouch! Ouch!" cries Pokerounce as you tug his beard. Rip out the
 roots. Crop every follicle. Ginger crunches and spritzes fresh hot
 spice after each bite. Your tongue's alive with aromatic zest, munched
 galingale releasing pungent perfume to cleanse your palate. He's not
 half as imposing plucked beardless, our grand inquisitor.

 "You'll never leave," he says. "No one escapes..."

>eat honey

 That's right, my dear, rip into this inquisitor… just desserts
 served…
 back broken, limbs lopped, fingers sticky… no, don't tell me what to
 do… sit still… stop playing with my food… I won't do it… I'll
 scream…
 I'll shout… as though that would matter in a dungeon.
 I'll shout… as though that would matter in a dungeon.
 Pokerounce screeches.
 Pokerounce screeches.
 O goes his mouth and more bees pour forth, riding his bellows. There's
 nothing to see but their caramel swarm. Take little note: they're
 simply one more treat to devour.

 Cram your jaws with his honeycombs. Chomp as the combs crackle,
 flatten, golden floes oozing down your throat. Dismiss his wails. He
 deserves this. You're inhaling his bees, their swarm streaming into
 your jaws from his. The undercroft's thick with sweetness, with drones
 to drown the sharpest shrieks, and then you suck and suck the last bee
 into your lips with a smack, and Master Pokerounce isn't such a master
 anymore.
 anymore.
 First course: eaten.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Undercroft</span>
 Come and leave as you like. This red-velvet chamber's vacant, save
 that half-carved munster-géromé, with no one left to ensure prisoners
 stay locked away.

 Westward lies the creamery, eastward the armory, and southward the
 dungeon.

>eat munster

 How soft is this half-moulded munster guard! He'd stand a handsome
 specimen indeed, but his orange-red rind's still incompletely carved,
 and he melts with a luscious tang across your tongue. Not sentient
 enough to struggle yet. Gobble him down. Now he'll patrol no rounds.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Armory</span>
 Inhale that wondrous mouldering stench: fine cheeses stacked in
 ripening rows. A monger's cellar wouldn't boast a breadth more
 noseworthy. There's brie and cantal, gloucester, blue stilton and red
 leicester, morbier, spermyse, and maroilles amongst others heaped deep
 in shadow.

 Westward's the undercroft, and upward a staircase curves to the
 eastern tapestry.

>examine tapestry

 You could walk upward to the eastern tapestry.

>eat cantal

 You're already wearing a brie rind.

>examine shadow

 Farther back than your arms can reach are more varieties: mimolette
 and emmentaler, beaufort and trappista, shropshire, ardrahan,
 wensleydale and vieux-boulogne and provolone and goodness one might
 name them until morning breaks.

>examine gloucester

 Colossal gloucester, packed with full fat, you're a cheese that a
 giant could hack with an axe. That apricot glow's annatto-infused.
 Your wedges would prop fortresses against collapse.

>examine cantal

 Cantal's as ancient as the hills, grandfather amongst cheese, speckled
 grey with its hoary age and pebbled with the most endearing lumps.

>examine emmentaler

 You can't reach these cheeses, child. They're too far back.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Tapestry</span>
 Across the eastern wall's hung a great tapestry woven with warfare and
 carnage. Your heart would have thundered in the skirmish sewn through
 these threads, wherein this castle's pretender found herself driven
 into exile. Ah, what a bloody rout that was.

 Southward sprawls the banquet hall; westward lies the balance gallery;
 stairs wind upward into the bower and downward to the armory.

>examine tapestry

 Never were battles fought with gore and glory more than the battle
 threaded into this tapestry. Beheaded knights heaped high as hills,
 fools to have sworn their fealty to a traitor queen. Fancied herself a
 sorceress, thought that she'd hold the castle with a charm, as though
 mortal enchantments could entrap a race older than human blood. She's
 flown there, in the tapestry's corner, upon a chariot, expelled by the
 same hosts she'd sought to make her slaves. Ignorant witch, shame even
 to the lowly title witch. She might have ruled a hundred years, but
 centuries slip through this castle quicker than sands in a glass.

>eat it

 One thread unravels in your teeth. Keep eating and you'll eat the
 tapestry. I think you'll find, however, that it's easier to view when
 it's hanging on a wall outside your stomach.

>go down

 You descend the staircase.

 Now the odor in your mouth begins to dissipate.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Banquet Hall</span>
 Gaze down the hall and you'll gaze down a valley between smashed
 dishes. Above that valley rotates a boned chandelier, below that
 chandelier stretches a table the hall's length, and around that table
 is ranged the Amuse-Bouche Quartet: Earl Escargot, Dame Demitasse,
 Frypan Fredrick, and Mistress Caviar. Tonight their plates are heaped
 with devils on horseback, battered mozzarella, vol-au-vents, toast
 points, dolma, and <span class="floydstyle em">boquerones en vinagre</span>.

 Southward, footmen stream from the kitchen; northward lies the eastern
 tapestry.

 A footman carries <span class="floydstyle em">choriqueso</span> to the table.

>blow

 You blow out the onion's tearjerking odor, but with all the hors
 d'oeuvres inside this banquet hall, even its aroma simply wanders and
 gets lost amongst others.

>examine escargot

 Earl Escargot is what you might refer to as a connoisseur. He's slow
 to chew, slower to swallow, slowest to admit satisfaction. He dabs his
 luscious lips after each bite with a napkin; his second tentacle roves
 the table for more hors d'oeuvres. Garlic butter shimmers in every
 fold along his flesh, golden, unctuous, tinged green with minced
 parsley swimming inside his shell.

 Dame Demitasse gobbles the <span class="floydstyle em">boquerones en vinagre</span> and drops
 the platter.

>examine demitasse

 Fine porcelain flesh, veins patterned cobalt blue beneath the glaze,
 teacup eyelids, ceramic handles curving from her skull, that skull's
 cap sawn and sundered with coffee brimming inside: meet the
 magnificent Dame Demitasse. She exhales steam. Roasted aromas, wooden,
 malted, floral, toasted, waft around her place at the table. Perhaps
 each time she lifts her arm, her china chips a little more, joints
 delicately splintering, but no beauty was ever forged without pain
 poured into the crucible.

 A footman delivers cucumber sandwiches to the table.

>examine frypan

 He's a hopper, Frypan Fredrick, each limb, each finger a breaded
 frog's leg. Why, even his head is a breaded frog's leg, sticking from
 a ruffed collar whose starched fabric has gone translucent with
 grease. Doublet fried crisp, crackowes squelching with lard, he's apt
 to leave breadcrumbs behind. No eyes, poor dear, nor nose, nor ears:
 that's what you get with a leg for a head. At least he has a mouth,
 and what a mouth, with human teeth in the hundreds to compensate.

 Frypan Fredrick tears into the dolma and discards the plate.

>examine caviar

 A glob aglimmer in her seat, roe oozing to absorb hors d'oeuvres,
 you'll recognize no single silhouette in Mistress Caviar. She shifts
 into whatever shape commands the highest bid, black beads brighter
 than diamonds sparkling beneath the chandelier, arms coalescing when
 she needs more limbs. A hundred sturgeon gutted would not yield one
 hundredth her measure. She'd snare a tsar's heart with her champagne
 laugh.

 A footman brings samosas to the table.

>examine footman

 Sardines in eggplant livery. Sometimes they slouch, it's true, what
 can you do about your posture when you're a herring on land, but
 otherwise they're excellent servants: expedient, focused, disposable.

 Mistress Caviar devours the toast points and casts aside the tray.

>examine chandelier

 Duck fat drips from the chandelier, rendered most marvelous into
 candles whose wicks flame green and knock shadows onto the walls. Each
 burns upon a rib's snapped tip, splayed from a keel anchored to a
 wishbone, and that wishbone hung from high waffled groins.

 A footman carts pickles to the table.

>examine table

 A table long enough to sit a crowd, with drumstick legs and duck skin
 draped across the top. My, what a mess: plates strewn
 higgledy-piggledy with cutlery and serving trays shoved aside to make
 room for more hors d'oeuvres. Right now the table's cluttered with
 pickles, samosas, cucumber sandwiches, <span class="floydstyle em">choriqueso</span>, devils on
 horseback, battered mozzarella, and vol-au-vents.

 Earl Escargot sucks down the vol-au-vents and tosses the dish.

>eat table

 They'll not notice a nibble missing from their tablecloth. There: just
 a corner, crisp crackling that softens in the mouth.

 A footman bears tongue toast to the table.

>eat footman

 Why, this sardine's so servile that it practically swims down your
 throat. They've been trained well, these footmen have: jump when
 they're told, even when it will land them in a mouth.

 Not that this footman should be missed. Others flow constantly from
 the kitchen.

 Frypan Fredrick thoroughly chews the battered mozzarella and tosses
 the tray.

>eat footman

 Come, come, footman, step right into these jaws. Yes, very good. That
 one slipped down as nicely as the first, and here's his stand-in from
 the kitchen already.

 A footman carries gravlax to the table.

>eat caviar

 "Appreciate the finer things?" asks Mistress Caviar. "Care for a
 little nibble right here, love? A little taste? I'll have you know I'm
 unavailable, nor would my friends enjoy seeing me mistreated. We'll
 stick together long as we've hors d'oeuvres to eat."

 Earl Escargot chomps into the devils on horseback and discards the
 plate.

>eat frypan

 Have you ever been kicked by a frog's leg before? Now you have. Frypan
 pulls one knee backward, there's a crackow in your gut, and the wall
 takes your breath upon impact.

 A footman delivers croquettes to the table.

>eat croquettes

 "I wouldn't," says Dame Demitasse, steaming slightly hotter.

 Dame Demitasse swallows the <span class="floydstyle em">choriqueso</span> and drops the platter.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Pandemonium, thou art a castle kitchen. White toques bob as sardine
 chefs labor over cutting boards and coals, stirring saucepans,
 stuffing pastries, rolling dough as flour thickens the air. Footmen
 teem around counters, poised to carry dishes to the banquet hall.

 Northward you could follow the footmen; westward a door opens to the
 castle gate; stairs wind upward to the pantry and downward to the
 buttery.

 Another footman bears crab rangoon into the banquet hall.

>examine chefs

 Among these bustling sardines, you can distinguish the chefs by their
 white turnip toques. They've got peeled turnips buttoned down their
 scales for uniforms as well.

>examine boards

 Minced meat covers the cutting boards. No way to tell what animal it
 was before the sardine chefs got their fins onto it.

 Another footman carries deviled eggs into the banquet hall.

>examine coals

 Every now and again, some sardine rakes the kitchen's coals to
 encourage their blaze. They're throbbing white and orange in a hearth
 against the wall. Above their mound, the air wobbles, and hanging pots
 bubble.

 Another sardine flops into the kitchen from upstairs.

>examine saucepans

 It's chaos with chefs fighting to manage their pots over the kitchen's
 coals. There's always an elbow, or the sardine equivalent, in
 someone's face as they dash spices into pans and whisk sauces.

 Another footman takes steak tartare into the banquet hall.

>examine pastries

 These unfinished pastries are little coffins waiting to be stuffed.
 Fillings couldn't request a final resting place more marvelous.

>examine dough

 Oh dough, plain as you are, lumps clumped across counters, you're the
 clay from which masterpieces rise, miracles spring. You're raw
 potential ready for kneading.

 Another footman bears bruschetta into the banquet hall.

>examine counters

 Glistening suet countertops these are, darling: fat firm and clean as
 any cook could dream. Tile'd not shine as brilliantly after the
 soundest scrub.

>eat chef

 Drag a chef from the crowd, engulf him whole, white toque and all. His
 fellow chefs pay no attention as you push his fins into your lips.
 They're far too focused on their cookery.

 Indeed, darling, there's already another tripping downstairs to
 replace the first. No sardine shortage around here to speak about.

 Another footman takes canapés into the banquet hall.

>eat dough

 A sardine slaps your hand with a meat tenderizer.

>go down

 You descend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Buttery</span>
 Down here the air is cool and dry and still. Along the walls are
 stacked the castle's butts, rack upon rack, enormous barrels corked to
 keep fine beverages in store. The greatest barrel's big enough to
 contain a hundred smaller.

 Upward a staircase runs to the kitchen.

>examine barrels

 Each butt's emblazoned with an emblem to note what the barrels hold,
 although it'd take an alewife in the know to sort through them. Apart
 from the greatest barrel, here's a smaller stamped with a dragon, and
 another with a bear, and one painted with a harlequin.

>examine dragon

 The dragon on this barrel's long and snakish. More a wyrm, bearded and
 lacking wings. It's painted in green pigment that's faded toward grey.

>examine bear

 This barrel's more than blazoned with a bear. The animal's been
 branded straight into the butt, burned with black ashen lines.
 Posture: statant.

>examine harlequin

 Cheeky's the harlequin stamped on this butt. The picture's checked in
 yellow paint and represents the fellow with a bottle tipped to funnel
 liquid underneath his domino.

>examine greatest

 Across this giant barrel's face is stamped an emblem picturing a
 maiden wrapped in spikes. Hard to determine whether she's in agony or
 ecstasy, but there's wincing involved in either case.

>examine maiden

 Across this giant barrel's face is stamped an emblem picturing a
 maiden wrapped in spikes. Hard to determine whether she's in agony or
 ecstasy, but there's wincing involved in either case.

>eat dragon

 Green tea pours from the dragon's tap, piping and steeped precisely
 right. Its warmth spreads through your body and its flavor's clean and
 bracing with the slightest bitter hint beneath the humblest sweetness.

>eat bear

 Turn the bear barrel's tap: kvass bubbles over your tongue, fizzing
 with carbonation from black bread fermented to sour sublimity. That
 tang's delight if delight's something someone could barrel.

>eat harlequib

 I'm afraid I don't see what you mean.

>eat harlequin

 Lemonade flows from the harlequin's hogshead. Refreshing streams, tart
 with citrus, chilled, sweetened with sugar. There's crushed ice mixed
 into the drink, and it's crushed twice between your teeth.

>eat greatest

 How odd. There's no leakage when you begin to turn the giant barrel's
 tap. It turns and turns, yielding no liquid anywise. A disappointment,
 certainly, to anyone after a drink, but this barrel's still filled
 with something worth seeing.

 Its face opens, swinging back for a door. Inside the barrel's quite
 empty. It seems there's a passageway to the north.

>go north

 Your footsteps echo against wood. Well, go ahead, keep clambering
 about, knock for another door—aha, you've found one at the barrel's
 back. With a heave-ho you push it ajar and step northward into a
 different room.
>go north

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (east cell)</span>

>examine vegetables

 No vegetables are quite as large as these eggplants and turnips at the
 front, but even the more reasonable radishes, the more diminutive

 Why, hullo, here's a sardine from the storeroom. Slips inside an
 eggplant skin, quite like a footman in that purple livery, and then
 wriggles downstairs.

 You've got a selection to choose from, darling.

 You're already wearing a brie rind.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storeroom</span>
 Not a chamber often visited by the nobility. Five metal tins against
 the walls, lined in neat rows as barracks beds. One lid has been
 halfway uncurled, and there beneath its foil sardines slumber in oil.
 They'll stir when they're needed downstairs.

 Southward you'll find passage to the pantry.

>examine tins

 Each tin comes packed with sardines fin to fin. There's nothing like
 rolling their metal lids away to glimpse those slumbering little fish.
 Rest assured, these are packed with their heads still intact. Only the
 freshest sardines to serve this castle!

>eat sardines

 Heavens, yes, why not sample some sardines? One slips right down your
 throat, leaves your lips smacking with oil. Another slips down as
 deliciously. They come packed in tins for a reason, you see. They know
 that one's never enough. When you're done, you have emptied a tin.

>eat sardines

 More sardines, please. Another tin! You peel its lid backward to
 inhale the oily flavor that wafts from within. Their eyes are open but
 they're fast asleep. These sardines can sleep in your belly once
 you've swallowed them. One, two, three, four, let's stop counting. How
 many come packed in a tin? Not enough!

>eat sardines

 You've developed a taste for sardines, it appears. Plunge your hands
 quick into another tin, raise out the oily slumberers, hold them over
 your mouth, then slurp them down. They don't object. They're perfectly
 content to serve someone. Now here's another empty bed.

>eat sardines

 My, at this rate, you'll have eaten the room! Another tin unlidded,
 more sardines pulled from their beds, and more smacks from your lips
 with each swallow. Your cheeks are speckled with their shining scales.
 Your tongue quivers with salt. They are a most addictive dish. Over
 your shoulder goes the empty tin.

>eat sardines

 At last, the last tin in the room. Savor these slumbering sardines.
 You'll have no more from this storeroom. Peel back their metal lid
 with tenderness. Observe their skin when you lift them aloft, how it
 glistens. They disappear into your mouth, tails sticking through your
 lips till you swallow. Rattle the tin for more; you'll find none left.
 Now lick the oil from your fingertips. There, you've finished.

>look

 Not a chamber often visited by the nobility. Five metal tins lie

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gatehouse</span>
 Through a narrow window there's a view across the moat, and through
 another hole a chain with toffee links holds the drawbridge. At a
 table slumbers a havarti guard with a swordfish propped next to him.
 Perhaps those bottles at his feet have something to do with his
 snores.

 Westward lies a garderobe, and eastward the pantry.

>examine moat

 It's difficult to pick out details from this far away.

>examine chain

 Here's how this arrangement works: when everything's all clear below,
 this chain's unwound to lower the drawbridge. Right now it's coiled
 tight to keep the drawbridge closed.

>examine guard

 He's snoring blissfully. Havarti's no hard cheese but he's gone softer
 than ever from that root beer, forgot his duties, let his knightly
 honor lapse. He'll reap what his habits have sown.

>examine swordfish

 You'd not want that fish's proboscis poked into your vital spots.

>examine bottles

 It seems there's been a tipple here. Root beer bottles lie scattered,
 drained to their last drops. Shame's not something the castle guards
 imbibe, apparently.

>eat swordfish

 Your throat's a sheath: you chomp the fish, swallow its pointed nose,
 right down it goes. Its swashbuckling days are at an end.

>eat guard

 "What time, Sir Jarlsberg?" he yawns. "By god's bones, root beer fogs
 the faculties…"

 First he blinks, and then he rubs his eyes, and then he blinks again.
 It takes him a moment to register what's happening. He lunges for his
 swordfish, finds nothing, stumbles onto his feet gripping thin air.

 "Pilfered mine blade, intruder? I'll fistfight thee then!"

>eat guard

 Our guard might flail his fists however he pleases, but his havarti's
 no match for your appetite. "Mercy! Hiccup!" he says, but he's inside
 your mouth, you've gobbled his knuckle sandwich. Too late! His soft
 smooth texture almost melts.

 He'll prove no further hinderance tonight.

>eat chain

 This toffee chain won't yield without a crunch. Put your jaw into it!
 You bite and gnaw and nibble, yet its links don't break. Most seem
 slightly too strong to chew, but there's always a weaker one.

>eat chain

 Yes, keep chewing that chain, darling. Eventually you'll find the
 weakest link.

>eat chain

 Persist, my dear! You're almost there. In just a few more bites, this
 chain is positive to snap.

>eat chain

 Your tongue probes for a fracture: there, you bite.

 Broken links lash and rattle through the gatehouse hole. Below there's
 an impact to make the castle quake as the drawbridge descends, and
 buttery brown sweetness floods your mouth to stick between your teeth.
 That's toffee, always sticking somewhere.

 When you're done, you pick out the pieces.

>look

 Eastward you can step back to the gatehouse.

>examine guard

 My word, this jarlsberg guard's gone green. Blame drink. Always blame
 drink. Knights with cow's milk for blood can't be expected to hold
 their root beer.

 "Sir Havarti?" he groans. "I'll report back… anon…"

>eat guard

 "Sir Havarti, thou… thou art not Sir Havarti!" the guard exclaims.

 He's still bent over the privy, and seeing you's more surprise than he
 can afford.

 Step forward to catch him, but no, you're too slow: he's already
 pitched headfirst through the hole. Down, down he goes into the
 darkened moat, but there's no splash: only a squish, and then silence.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gatehouse</span>
 Through a narrow window there's a view across the moat. Another hole
 once ran a chain to the drawbridge: no more. Root beer bottles lie
 tumbled beneath a table.

 Westward lies a garderobe, and eastward the pantry.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>
 Don't knock your head on vegetables above, enormous bundles that drape
 from the ceiling's beams. Here are eggplants in a clump, and turnips
 rocking where you've nudged a brace.

 Northward a door leads into the storeroom, westward you'll find the
 gatehouse, and downward a stair spirals into the kitchen.

>go down

 You descend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Pandemonium, thou art a castle kitchen. White toques bob as sardine
 chefs labor over cutting boards and coals, stirring saucepans,
 stuffing pastries, rolling dough as flour thickens the air. Footmen
 teem around counters, poised to carry dishes to the banquet hall.

 Northward you could follow the footmen; westward a door opens to the
 castle gate; stairs wind upward to the pantry and downward to the
 buttery.

>eat chefs

 They weren't enough, of course not, those sardines in the storeroom.
 Not when the kitchen's still crowded. Not when you could reach out,
 pack more between your teeth as they were packed into their tins
 before.

 They've caught on now. Too late, they'll not escape.

 Footmen flop toward the door but you grab tails, raise them aloft,
 drop them into your mouth as you seize chefs thrashing over saucepans,
 across rolled dough. Their bulging eyes bulge even more. Their lips
 glub open in panic. When your lips close, however, that's the end.

>eat footmen

 I'm afraid I don't see what you mean.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Nobody now remains to tend this kitchen's hearth or knead the dough
 rolled on the countertops. Neglected saucepans cool. Flour has settled
 on the floor, tracked with footprints.

 Northward lies the banquet hall; westward a doorway opens to the
 castle gate; stairs wind upward to the pantry and downward to the
 buttery.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Banquet Hall</span>
 Gaze down the hall and you'll gaze down a valley between smashed
 dishes. Above that valley rotates a boned chandelier, below that
 chandelier a table stretches the hall's length, and around that table
 is ranged the Amuse-Bouche Quartet: Earl Escargot, Dame Demitasse,
 Frypan Fredrick, and Mistress Caviar. Tonight their choices dwindle
 with only canapés, bruschetta, steak tartare, and deviled eggs
 remaining.

 Frypan Fredrick rakes the deviled eggs into his mouth.

 "Oh dear, where are the footmen?" asks Earl Escargot. "They've
 disappeared. At this rate we'll finish the last hors d'oeuvres any
 minute. I must eat more. I can't stop now!"

>eat dame

 "I'd keep my distance," says Dame Demitasse. "At this rate, these hors
 d'oeuvres won't last, and don't <span class="floydstyle em">dare</span> think you'll get any."

 Frypan Fredrick gobbles the steak tartare quick as a snapped finger.

 "Don't start eyeballing me," says Mistress Caviar. "Get any fresh
 ideas and I'll get some fresh ideas to match yours. Perhaps I'm
 getting fresh ideas now. You're not the only one who eats hors
 d'oeuvres around this place."

>eat chandelier

 Stick out your tongue: there's drippings caught from the candles.

 Frypan Fredrick reaches for the bruschetta but the earl ensnares the
 plate, tugging until he's shoveled everything into his throat. Frypan
 watches with a forlorn ribbit.

 "You're such a handsome frog, Fredrick. Did you know?" asks Dame
 Demitasse. "Bones with good meat on them, and fried in all the right
 places. A lady could just gobble you right up."

>eat escargot

 "We aren't that desperate yet, are we?" whimpers the earl. "Not while
 we still have some hors d'oeuvres…"

 "Give that to me!" says Mistress Caviar, holding the canapés as Earl
 Escargot attempts to rip the platter from her roe. His tentacles slip
 loose and she engulfs the dish.

 "Oh, oh, without hors d'oeuvres I'll starve!" the earl exclaims. "I'll
 shrivel in my shell. I'll waste away!"

>eat escargot

 "No, no!" says Earl Escargot. "We mustn't stoop to that level. I still
 mourn for Pierre Canard…"

 "Stay there," commands Dame Demitasse. "Don't hop, Fredrick. Don't
 move."

 There's your cue, Fredrick: hop, hop for your life!

 She's snatched him by one pointed toe, stabbed shards through his
 crackow, her arms cracking as she drags Frypan over the table. His
 battered fingers scrabble for something to grip. Plates clatter to the
 floor, and now there's an ear-splitting splinter as Dame Demitasse
 opens her jaws. Look at those jagged porcelain fangs! Frypan Fredrick
 looks close enough when they chomp down around his breaded head.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Banquet Hall</span>
 Gaze down the hall and you'll gaze down a valley between smashed
 dishes. Above that valley rotates a boned chandelier, below that
 chandelier a table stretches the hall's length, and around that table
 prowl Earl Escargot, Dame Demitasse, and Mistress Caviar.

>eat caviar

 "Lovely," says Mistress Caviar. "Yes, snuggle right here, closer,
 sweetheart, closer and I'll show you a good time. Let me just wrap my
 roe around your shoulders—wait, don't bite! That doesn't mean to bite
 harder! No, don't swallow!"

 Her black pearls almost purr as you pack them into your mouth, rolling
 across your palate, popping with rich salted bursts. You hold the sea
 upon your tongue. You hold the rarest sturgeon's ancient taste, subtle
 as butter, decadent as macadamia, mild, refined.

 Meanwhile there's a shriek across the room as Earl Escargot guzzles
 Dame Demitasse, tentacles coiled around her handles.

>eat escargot

 "Oh my, that glimmer in your eye… I don't care for it," says Earl
 Escargot. "Actually, I doubt we would agree with each other. No, put
 that fork back onto the table. A fork won't do you any good. Oh, no,
 there's no need for a fork!"

 He rocks back with a crash; upward you roll atop his shell, fork
 plunged into his face, yanking the earl out yard by yard to rehouse
 him inside your mouth. Garlic butter and parsley drip between your
 teeth. "I should have never been so succulent!" are his last words,
 and then you tilt his shell to slurp the sauce.

 Across the floor, skin fractured, spills Dame Demitasse.

>examine demitasse

 Fine porcelain flesh, veins patterned cobalt blue beneath the glaze,
 teacup eyelids, ceramic handles curving from her skull, that skull's
 cap sawn and sundered with coffee brimming inside: here's the
 magnificent Dame Demitasse. She exhales steam. Roasted aromas, wooden,
 malted, floral, toasted, waft in her wake. Perhaps each time she lifts
 her arm, her china chips a little more, joints delicately splintering,
 but no beauty was ever forged without pain poured into the crucible.

 "That stupid snail," murmurs Dame Demitasse.

>eat her

 "I knew you were suspicious," says Dame Demitasse. "It's the dungeon
 where you belong! You'll bleed for this!"

 Cream—banish it; and sugar—sacrilege. Her body's brewed with depth
 blackness alone could sound. Down, down you drink her coffee and down,
 down your tastebuds plunge into a richness roasted, velvet with
 flavors imparted by the darkest drips. All that's bitter is glimpsing
 her bottom once you've drained it. Nothing remains but shattered
 porcelain with cobalt veins.

 Frypan Fredrick hops from the broken heap. His hop's lopsided: some
 tendon twisted.

>eat frederick

 I'm afraid I don't see what you mean.

>eat fredrick

 Zounds, sirrah! How you leap even limping! Frypan's reluctant, as you
 may well understand, to have himself swallowed again. He jumps onto
 the banquet table, crouches, rotates on his haunches, and out shoots
 his tongue to batter you with fried batter. Crumbs scatter. Stumble
 back, regain your balance, never surrender.

>eat fredrick

 Pounce, my dear, pounce before Frypan pounces. No, not here,
 <span class="floydstyle em">here</span>; no, not there, <span class="floydstyle em">there</span>. His fried legs fly over
 your head. Dishes break when he lands. He's left, right, near, far,
 tripped—yes, tripped on his long pointed toes. Haute couture takes
 another toll. You have him, no, you don't have him: he's leapt to
 seize the chandelier. He swings most wildly.

>eat fredrick

 You must know what you want… well, maybe, perhaps… not this… or
 that…
 something else… we don't care for it… but on second thought… take
 it
 away… no, bring it back… enough, you'll eat what you've been
 served,
 and you'll like it.
 and you'll like it.
 You jump.
 You jump.
 Shadows race across walls, chased by the swinging chandelier. Frypan
 scrambles higher but your teeth sink into his ankles. His tongue
 tangles the candlesticks. No more swinging: he's straining as you yank
 him down, each gulp another tug. Tender meat shreds. Grease coats your
 throat. Breadcrumbs crumble. He croaks.

 Into the banquet hall crashes the chandelier, table smashed, ends
 upturned, cutlery raining as the ceiling collapses. Sardine tins
 tumble through the broken storeroom floor. Discarded dishes slide to
 bury everything in shattered crockery, and out you topple into the
 kitchen, still licking Frypan's grease from your fingers. With that,
 we do hereby adjourn this evening's meeting of the Amuse-Bouche
 Quartet.
 Quartet.
 Second course: eaten.
 Second course: eaten.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Nobody now remains to tend this kitchen's hearth or knead the dough
 rolled on the countertops. Neglected saucepans cool. Flour has settled
 on the floor, tracked with footprints.

 Westward a doorway opens to the castle gate; stairs wind upward to the
 pantry and downward to the buttery; northward the banquet hall lies in
 ruin.

>go north

 There's barely room to peer inside now that the ceiling's caved. Only
 rubble and smashed dishes still settling in pockets under the debris.
 This banquet hall will hold no further feasts.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gateway</span>
 You stand before the castle's only gate. Through this passage must
 pass all seeking admittance or leave, whether they be the fairest or
 most squalid amongst us.

 Southward the great drawbridge has been lowered.

 Walk northward, noble guests, to the courtyard; slink eastward,
 servants, serfs bearing supplies, through that low kitchen door. All
 to their stationed ranks.

>examine gate

 No less sturdy than the drawbridge are these walls that create the
 gate itself. They're soda bread, extremely hard, and no might you
 muster will bring them down.

>examine drawbridge

 Biscotti planks hammered into a bridge. Knock these planks, slam them,
 batter their biscotti with a ram and they won't give a chip for all
 the force you've thrust into the endeavor. There's little else as
 durable as good strong biscotti.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 No common bailey, but a garden with walls trellis-wound. Its master
 hauls herself from bed to bed, throwing her tendrils out to drag her
 leafy head across the ground. That would be Jenny Lettucehead, the
 castle gardener extraordinaire. Here you're in her domain, patches
 plump with young cabbages.

 One cabbage chirps as Jenny tucks its leaves into a nursery.

 Northward, below a balcony, a door opens into the balance gallery, and
 southward are the gateway and drawbridge.

>examine jenny

 A lettucehead like hers would break the widest wheelbarrow and command
 every ribbon at the fair. Put away your spades and seedling dreams,
 farmhands; you're through. Pearl onions at her maize earlobes. Ripe
 cherry cheeks. Jenny, let's see your carrot jaws. A rather sharkish
 smile, hasn't she? Quell your concerns and count your blessings she's
 no predator. Soil's her standard fare, the richer, fouler the better.
 After a battle, when the land's imbued with rot, flowers still bloom.

>examine beds

 Her little charges snuggle in their little beds. Bald cabbage heads
 wrapped in thick cabbage leaves. They coo, they do, they gurgle and
 they mewl, these savoy babes tucked in neat nursery rows. Jenny's at
 one plot or another attending their chirps.

 I'm afraid I don't see what you mean.

>eat jenny

 Jog after Jenny Lettucehead, will you? Perhaps you've got it in your
 mind to sample her salad, but you'll harvest nothing as long as she's
 hauling herself from bed to bed. Tuck in a cabbage here, arrange one
 there, she's on the move. Her vines whip wild at her sides. You're
 never close enough to nab a bite.

>eat cabbage

 Fasten one eye to Jenny as you pull a cabbage from a bed. Brush down
 those leaves, shake out soil, before munching its head, and then
 notice too late that Jenny's heard the crunch. She's turned toward
 you, and what she does is smile with delight. What's her work worth
 without stomachs to feed? Go on and finish munching. You've her
 approval.

>eat cabbage

 You'll eat another cabbage babe. Knock it about to loosen clods, peel
 back the leaves around its face, chomp down, savor the crunch. No
 preparation necessary for a tender head this crisp and young.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balance Gallery</span>
 Northward a gleaming golden door would lead into the chapel, but it's
 sealed. Beneath your feet, the floor's plated with silver polished to
 a mirror's shine.

 Westward and eastward you'll find tapestried chambers, and southward's
 the courtyard.

>examine door

 No hinge, no handle, no keyhole or crack is to be seen.

 As you stand in the gallery, the floor sinks and you hear a hidden
 contraption <span class="floydstyle em">click click</span>.

>go east

 When you leave the gallery, its floor rises again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern Tapestry</span>
 Across the eastern wall's hung a great tapestry woven with warfare and
 carnage. Your heart would have thundered in the skirmish sewn through
 these threads, wherein this castle's pretender found herself driven
 into exile. Ah, what a bloody rout that was.

 Westward lies the balance gallery, stairs wind upward into the bower
 and downward to the armory, and southward the banquet hall has
 collapsed.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bower</span>
 Overhead's spread the nighttime sky. What once was a bower's now mere
 rubble with crumbled walls. Whipped-cream clouds conceal the moon,
 floating just close enough to taste, and there's a chill to make your
 blood run cold.

 Westward lies the scriptorium, and downward are stairs to the eastern
 tapestry.

>examine clouds

 Only the thinnest moonlight leaks through these whipped-cream masses.

>examine moon

 The moon's cloud-cloaked. Staring alone won't unveil it.

 A breeze carries soft sobbing to your ears.

>listen

 I'll tell you everything you need to hear.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scriptorium</span>
 Wisdom's stored here, the richest this world knows: how to cook well.
 Lox bookcases abound with shelves exceptionally stocked. You'll find
 more than one page worth your perusal if you're after instruction in
 how to prepare, say, four more courses for a feast.

 Westward's passage to the solar, eastward lies the bower, and
 southward you'll walk out onto a balcony.

>examine bookcases

 More recipes are stocked on these pink salmon shelves than you've got

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 Mind where you put your weight when you look downward into the
 courtyard. This wafer balustrade's not the thickest with piroulines
 for posts.

 Northward you could return indoors to the scriptorium.

>examine wafer

 Before our gardener reclaimed the yard, here's where this castle's
 pretender would stand, beside the balustrade, to greet supplicants
 gathered underneath. Few now brave pilgrimage.

>eat wafer

 Quick work, quick work indeed. Upon meeting your tongue, the wafer's
 porous bread practically melts. More resilient, the piroulines, whose
 balusters crunch as biscuits should crunch. Hazelnut chocolate fills
 their spiral tubes. You've bitten them to stumps now, look at that:
 this balustrade barely remains.

 hazelnut flavor lingers.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Solar</span>
 Omelettes carpet the floor. A brazier crackles merrily, surrounded by
 soft lard couches with marshmallow pillows. Less appetizing's that
 cage in the corner, where a carrion crow hunches behind nougat bars,
 watching the room.

 Southward you'll find the baron's cabinet, eastward the scriptorium,
 and downward stairs lead to the western tapestry.

>examine omelettes

 A proper egg hunt's a noble affair. You'd marvel at the spectacle.
 It's no mere traipse into the woods. No, it needs hounds and hunters
 in braces, and horns ringing over treetops, and there's always a
 valiant struggle when the eggs are driven from their nests. Once
 they've been cracked, their yolks make the most lovely rugs.

>examine brazier

 Scorpion peppers scramble inside the brazier, swarming over each other
 with talons ablaze. One prick from their stingers would ignite your
 tongue. Quite ill-advised.

>examine couches

 Although no one's attendant now, this solar's where the castle's
 gentry withdraw for a moment's calm. Little can ease a body like a
 warm lard couch.

>examine pillows

 Even goose down would make a sorry bed for any head accustomed to
 resting upon these pillows. They're unparalleled.

>examine cage

 A birdcage filigreed with white nougat more priceless than white gold.
 Most birds would peck right through the bars, but not the crow
 enclosed. It's only got an appetite for guts, and turns its beak up at
 everything else.

>examine crow

 When soldiers lose their guts in war, crows find them on the
 battlefield. Now here's a crow fed on burst bellies aplenty. Its
 feathers drip with carrion. Its beak's a splintered bone. Its eyes are
 ruby hemorrhoids in its head.

 "Let me out! Let me out!" caws the crow. "I'll eat intestines when I'm
 free. They keep me in this cage to cage my appetite. Release me! Let
 me out!"

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Baron's Cabinet</span>
 Before a giant fireplace sits a figure with proportions to match: the
 Baron d'Boeuf at his private suppertime. Oh how he hulks above your
 head, high, high enough to scrape the ceiling were he hunched merely a
 thumb's breadth less. He's engaged picking morsels from a basket at
 his feet, packing them down his gullet with a sirloin fist.

 He lifts a pepper out, swallows before it's even been chewed properly.

 Northward you could return to the solar.

>examine fireplace

 Thank goodness that this fireplace has not been kindled to its
 greatest blaze, otherwise such a monstrous hearth would toast you for
 nearness. It's more than large enough to step inside.

>examine baron

 What is a baron but a cut above the rest? You'll find no figure
 fashioned from finer flank steak, more succulent sirloin, more
 rib-sticking ribs or more chop-smacking chops. His very limbs are
 tenderloin, his belly brisket, and his rump what else but rump, the
 rarest, plumpest rump? Two rib-eyes set above fat marbled cheeks,
 filet lips basted in gravy, a tongue to make tongues marinate with
 watering. People in his palm would be mere pawns; he is outsized; he
 is prime certified; he is the Baron d'Boeuf for a reason: none other
 can match his mass on a scale.

>examine basket

 An overflowing cornucopia. His basket brims with vegetables worthy to
 garnish roasts for royalty—spanish onions, green peppers, garlic
 bulbs—and every other minute down the baron's arm comes reaching for
 another bite. He swallows whole.

>eat basket

 You crawl into the basket but you've no chance to eat anything before
 the Baron d'Boeuf seizes you. There's the floor gaining distance as
 you're lifted high into the air. His mouth opens—and then he looks at
 you.

 "You're not a vegetable," he says. "Begone! Cheese isn't on my menu
 this evening."

 He drops you back onto the ground.

>go north

 and downward stairs lead to the western tapestry.

>go down

 You descend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Tapestry</span>
 Across the western wall's another tapestry embroidered with a grand
 combat, in which this castle's vilest invader, the mouse king, had his
 tail chopped. Milk flows into the chamber from the south, streaming
 through breadstick grates set in the floor.

 A durkha guard stands, southward, at the entrance into the great hall.

 Eastward's the balance gallery; upward a staircase runs to the solar.

>examine guard

 Some guardsmen make others scramble: here's such a one. He towers at
 the threshold into the great hall, armored in a rind heavier than
 stone, harder than steel. That's durkha, my dear, champion amongst
 cheeses, aged for decades until its curds could crack an overeager
 jaw.

>eat guard

 It won't be easy, darling… he's gigantic… hurl yourself into the
 fight, there, grab his leg, take a deep bite! What's that, your teeth
 won't penetrate his rind? And now he's got you by the scruff? We all
 miscalculate our strength sometimes.

 "Weakling," says the durkha guard, tossing you back. "Thou art no
 match."

 Inhale that wondrous mouldering stench: fine cheeses stacked in

 leicester, morbier, spermyse, and maroilles amongst others heaped deep
 in shadow.

 Westward's the undercroft, and upward a staircase curves to the
 eastern tapestry.

 Blue flambeaux undulate, and in their flames gleam devices galore
 constructed to pry screams and more from prisoners. Don't sit down on
 that judas chair. Steer clear the rack. Give wide berth to the
 breaking wheel. They're occupied already by corpses.

 Northward a corridor leads to the undercroft. Open cells lie westward,
 eastward, and southward.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (east cell)</span>
 Against one wall towers a pastry maiden with its cage ajar, and in

 Although their panel's been sprung wide, a skewered corpse still
 dangles from the spikes.

 Westward an open doorway leads to the dungeon.

>go south

 You creep through the secret passage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Buttery</span>
 Down here the air is cool and dry and still. Along the walls are
 stacked the castle's butts, rack upon rack, enormous barrels corked to
 keep fine beverages in store. The greatest barrel's opened to reveal a
 hidden passage to the north.

 Upward a staircase runs to the kitchen.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Nobody now remains to tend this kitchen's hearth or knead the dough
 rolled on the countertops. Neglected saucepans cool. Flour has settled
 on the floor, tracked with footprints.

 Westward a doorway opens to the castle gate; stairs wind upward to the
 pantry and downward to the buttery; northward the banquet hall lies in
 ruin.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>
 Don't knock your head on vegetables above, enormous bundles that drape
 from the ceiling's beams. Here are eggplants in a clump, and turnips
 rocking where you've nudged a brace.

 Westward you'll find the gatehouse, downward a stair spirals into the
 kitchen, but northward the storeroom's collapsed.

>eat rind

 You devour the brie rind. You're unarmored again.

>eat eggplant

 Burrow into an eggplant. Eat out its spongy white insides until the
 purple peel's empty and you can ease into its skin. Yes, what a regal
 uniform that eggplant makes. Quite refined livery.

>go down

 You descend the staircase.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gateway</span>
 You stand before the castle's only gate. Through this passage must
 pass all seeking admittance or leave, whether they be the fairest or
 most squalid amongst us.

 Southward the great drawbridge has been lowered.

 Walk northward, noble guests, to the courtyard; slink eastward,
 servants, serfs bearing supplies, through that low kitchen door. All
 to their stationed ranks.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 No common bailey, but a garden with walls trellis-wound. Its master
 hauls herself from bed to bed, throwing her tendrils out to drag her
 leafy head across the ground. That would be Jenny Lettucehead, the
 castle gardener extraordinaire. Here you're in her domain, patches
 plump with young cabbages.

 She's rocking one cabbage to sleep, her vines laced into a cradle.

 Northward, below a balcony, a door opens into the balance gallery, and
 southward are the gateway and drawbridge.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balance Gallery</span>
 Northward a gleaming golden door would lead into the chapel, but it's
 sealed. Beneath your feet, the floor's plated with silver polished to
 a mirror's shine.

 Westward and eastward you'll find tapestried chambers, and southward's
 the courtyard.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Tapestry</span>
 Across the western wall's another tapestry embroidered with a grand
 combat, in which this castle's vilest invader, the mouse king, had his
 tail chopped. Milk flows into the chamber from the south, streaming
 through breadstick grates set in the floor.

 A durkha guard stands, southward, at the entrance into the great hall.

 Eastward's the balance gallery; upward a staircase runs to the solar.

>examine tapestry

 All larders attract vermin, and the more well stocked the larder, the
 more vicious the vermin. You'd never fathom what waves were repulsed
 from this castle, what rodents swarmed the walls, until one midnight
 when the chimes were ringing came the mouse king with his seven heads
 to the vanguard. He'll die forever in this tapestry, slain by a golden
 virge in nobler combat, by a truer monarch, than vermin ever deserved
 to fight. Judge for yourself, darling, the portrait's faithfulness,
 how excellent its threads capture such fey beauty.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Solar</span>
 Omelettes carpet the floor. A brazier crackles merrily, surrounded by
 soft lard couches with marshmallow pillows. Less appetizing's that
 cage in the corner, where a carrion crow hunches behind nougat bars,
 watching the room.

 Southward you'll find the baron's cabinet, eastward the scriptorium,
 and downward stairs lead to the western tapestry.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Baron's Cabinet</span>
 Before a giant fireplace sits a figure with proportions to match: the
 Baron d'Boeuf at his private suppertime. Oh how he hulks above your
 head, high, high enough to scrape the ceiling were he hunched merely a
 thumb's breadth less. He's engaged picking morsels from a basket at
 his feet, packing them down his gullet with a sirloin fist.

 "You'll do nicely," he says, pulling a spanish onion from the pile's
 peak.

 Northward you could return to the solar.

>eat basket

 You heft yourself into the baron's basket, tumble down amongst his
 vegetables, but you're not there one instant when he grasps you in his
 palm. Bratwurst fingers surround you. You're raised almost to the roof
 to meet his maw.

 "An aubergine?" he says. "Lovely."
 "An aubergine?" he says. "Lovely."
 He swallows you.
 He swallows you.
 You slide along esophageal membranes until you're emptied out into the
 baron's…
 baron's…
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">First Stomach</span>
 You've been engulfed into a butcher's dream: steak, steak galore,
 walls plastered with pastrami, roast beef pillars rising into
 porterhouse arches, meatloaf squishing beneath your weight. Gravy
 saliva gushes from the baron's throat above. Around you floats debris
 from his past meals: broken chairs, bedposts, bookcases, curtains,
 even one rotting horse still tethered to its cart. He's eaten more
 than vegetables in his heyday.

>examine steak

 You're sinking, darling, down into the gravy, deeper through the meat.
 Muscles contract around you. Somewhere some great sphincter opens and
 squeezes you through its tube. There's no time for sightseeing when
 you're being digested.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Second Stomach</span>
 At every side, smashed architecture leans, castles entire piled
 against cottages and mansions and wrecked towers whose spires jut
 through cascading acid falls. A countryside ruined lines this stomach
 with toppled walls. Rumbles upset the rubble. Stones clatter and
 brickwork breaks. The baron's working to process more than tonight's
 supper.

>eat baron

 Another vegetable comes down the pipe and clobbers you. This one's a
 great potato. What a bump it makes! Again the baron's gut convulses,
 more muscles contract, and you're sucked through another sphincter's
 lips.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Third Stomach</span>
 Now you're in deep, and not alone. Halfway-digested heaps gleam in the
 dripping dark. Look closer and you'll see them looking back. They
 moan, although they won't move far, not rendered into chyme. What was
 an oyster duchess leaks across a lobster gentleman's boiled red claws.
 Oatmeal courtiers have softened into sludge. Rooster feet twitch,
 tendons gelatinous. They've been stewing.

>eat baron

 They may have feeble hands, these eaten souls, but they have hands and
 hands and hands. You're swamped, pulled deeper by hands, hands, until
 you can't glimpse anything but hands—and then the suction's got your
 feet, and <span class="floydstyle em">slurp</span> you've gone downward once more.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fourth Stomach</span>
 All's calm here in the baron's deepest pit. No clutter but a single
 candle burning on a small table. A black figure sits at that table,
 carving vegetables with knife and fork. It's blacker than a shadow,
 blacker than blackness. Its silhouette resembles the baron.

>examine figure

 As you watch, the figure cuts an eggplant and lifts one slice to where
 most people have mouths. It has no features, no contours illuminated
 by the candle's flame. All light's absorbed completely into its
 shadow.
>examine table
 shadow.
 It doesn't eat the eggplant.
 It doesn't eat the eggplant.
 No, instead it shifts to look at you, lowers its fork again. Now
 something spreads across its head: little white teeth smiling. Your
 vision's filled with the figure's blackness. No matter where you turn,
 there's nothing else. You cannot see the candle, or the table, or the
 stomach that's enclosing you.
 stomach that's enclosing you.
 You've been swallowed again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Val sans Retour</span>
 Nothing but nothing surrounds you. A darkness deeper than the eyeless
 know. Well, dear, you're in a pickle now.

>examine darkness

 Distance and substance mean nothing.

>eat darkness

 You can't eat the abyss. It's eaten you.

>eat darkness

 You can't eat the abyss. It's eaten you.

 Wait one moment, what's that? Something else swallowed into the dark.
 You're drifting closer, or perhaps you've always been this close. In
 fact, drifting's hardly the word. Your feet might be on nothing yet
 they're planted firm.

 Why, goodness, it's a woman. She's known better nights.

>examine woman

 She's swooned, frame wasted thin. Each muscle's just as visible as
 though her flesh were flayed, and lines divide her body as they would
 a butcher's chart. Spotted gossamer silk trails from her horned
 headdress.

 "Please, please," she says, "take me away…"

>examine headdress

 All that's left from her courtly days, however long ago those were.
 She's been inside the baron's gut longer than some kingdoms survive.
 He'd be nothing, you see, without her anchoring his appetite.

>eat woman

 "I'm not even myself," she says. "It's been too long… I'm spread too
 thin… trapped in here… and out there… open your mouth… I'd
 rather be…
 anywhere else…"
 anywhere else…"
 It's not polite to make a lady wait.
 It's not polite to make a lady wait.
 She crawls into your jaws, one stomach traded for another. No sooner
 have her toes slipped past your lips than the abyss shatters. You're
 weightless, falling, shadows splintered, and your impact punches back
 through the baron's belly.

 Light blinds you. There's the roaring fireplace, and there's the Baron
 d'Boeuf roaring too—with stomachache. He can't contain what he's
 consumed. His bottomless gut's bottomless no more. Doubled over, he
 heaves his own insides out through his throat, gravy and steaks and
 sausages and meatballs and roast beef, everything that he's ever
 swallowed, everything from his basket, and your mouth's open for the
 feast. When he's finished, you're finished with him, and he's finished
 for good.
 for good.
 Third course: eaten.
 Third course: eaten.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Baron's Cabinet</span>
 A giant fireplace burns in a vacant room. Without the baron here to
 dwarf its size, the flames seem to lash higher than ever.

 Northward you could return to the solar.

>examine fireplace

 Thank goodness that this fireplace has not been kindled to its
 greatest blaze, otherwise such a monstrous hearth would toast you for
 nearness. It's more than large enough to step inside.

>enter pireplace

 I'm afraid I don't see what you mean.

>enter fireplace

 You tiptoe carefully around the flames.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fireplace</span>
 Sweat beads your brow. Heat ripples in the air above the hearth. Stand
 far against the fireplace's rearmost wall, where barbecue sauce oozes
 down the bricks; there you'll have space to skirt the blaze.

 Northward you'd inch back to the baron's cabinet.

>examine sauce

 Globs glisten as the firelight flickers. Your nostrils inhale vinegar
 mingled with mustard, paprika, cayenne. Glorious sauce, why baste
 these bricks when you could baste a tongue?

>eat sauce

 You plant your hands into the sauce, lean forward and lick, lick.
 Mesquite flavors both savory and sweet thrill down your throat. You'd
 gulp this barbecue sauce by the gallon with delight. There's something
 strange, though, underneath the sauce.

>look

>eat sauce

 Hullo, what's this? You keep licking until you've licked the last glob
 from the bricks, and then you stand back, cleaning your fingers. Here
 at the fireplace's rear you've found a concealed door built in the
 wall. Its opening leads down into a narrow spiral stair.

>go down

 As you spiral downward, the air cools.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall (south end)</span>
 That's iron you smell, little one. No wonder when the walls run red,
 your footsteps slide on bloody flags, and every corner's heaped with
 broken bones. Midway down the hall rests a great cow whose bulk traps
 her within the room, pinioned between the walls, unable to reverse and
 see what's happened to her southern side. She has been hacked, she has
 been half-butchered, her ribs sawn and her muscles rent to leave a
 cavern in her flank.

 Upward a hidden stair leads to the baron's fireplace.

>examine cow

 O mighty cow, what meat you might provide. You are a meat-filled
 mountainside! Miners could labor underneath your skin, unearth cuts
 marbled with the finest fat, translucent, white, creamy, carve brisket
 from your bones and wield pickaxes for kabobs. You'd feed a thousand
 mouths and more. You've already yielded meat by the tonne. Now here,
 my dear, is something worth dropping your jaw over. No common cow can
 open her body for a market.

>eat cow

 Moos thunder through the hall. She's felt that bite, darling.

>go north

 Although you can't push past the cow, you can climb into her.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall (inside a cow)</span>
 She's been hollowed by blades, our fatted calf, her insides empty but
 for some shunned viscera. Every steak carved, each muscle stripped,
 her skeleton still holding shape despite its vacancy. Her chitterlings
 coil across her great mammary glands.

 Southward you could climb outside again.

>examine viscera

 It seems as though some viscera weren't on the cutting list. Her
 chitterlings, for instance, draped and snaking in enormous loops, and
 her massive mammaries.

>examine mammaries

 An udder seen from the inside. No teats to suck, just slick flesh
 mounds ligament-lashed to her pelvis. They hardly hang; rather, they
 rest upon her inner skin, covered with chitterlings.

>touch mammaries

 Again you strain against your gut. My dear, this just won't do. Trust
 in your teeth, put more faith in your mouth, and learn how to apply
 your appetite. Eat, eat, and eat.

>eat viscera

 Heft an intestine in your arms. Its weight struggles to slip your
 grip. Bite down and chew and tear and then surrender when it doesn't
 tear, you cannot chew, your bites aren't strong enough. All right, let
 it slide back with its brethren.

 Lifting this chitterling has plastered you with gore: a splendid
 bouquet for a carnivore.

>inventory

 You have a hole in your stomach, and you're slathered with gore.

>examine gore

 Look at you, slathered, quite slathered in blood. You reek, my dear,
 as though you were a carcass left to fester after a culling.

 You crawl back through the cow's ripped hide.

 Most birds would peck right through the bars, but not the crow
 enclosed. It's only got an appetite for guts, and turns its beak up at
 everything else.

 When soldiers lose their guts in war, crows find them on the
 battlefield. Now here's a crow fed on burst bellies aplenty. Its

 for one instant to smash through once you've finished.

 "Guts! Guts! I want guts!" caws the crow, flying east to the
 scriptorium.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Scriptorium</span>
 Wisdom's stored here, the richest this world knows: how to cook well.
 Lox bookcases abound with shelves exceptionally stocked. You'll find

 A cold wind blows across the sky, dragging the whipped-cream clouds
 away, and the moon sheds their veil to climb higher. Beams spill onto
 the castle. Shadows slide back, and the bower's gilded silver.

 Now you can see a phantom lady sobbing at its brink.

>examine lady

 No castle is complete without its wailing rampart ghost. Ours glimmers
 silver, clad in countless spoons, with spoons linked into her kirtle,
 and spoons for ruffles at her sleeves, and spoons cascading to her
 phantom feet. Her broken heart beats battered in her chest's tureen.
 With every sob, her eyes stream consommé. Her steps would clash,
 dippers for hands, her head a great ladle, had she more form than fog,
 but there's nary a clang from her kitchenware chains. Only an endless
 tearful ladling.

>examine spoons

 Entwined with spoons, braided with spoons, spoons twisted into spoons
 as intricate as chainmail mesh, her dress would press someone alive
 straight down into the ground. Not her. She floats.

>eat lady

 Consommé mist lingers on your skin, but otherwise your arms pass

 You blow out the onion's tearjerking odor, and as it wafts toward the
 phantom, she begins to sniffle. Ah well, a sniffle's not enough—but
 wait, her sniffles turn to sobs, her tureen heaves, her spoons
 tremble. An onion's no cause for sorrow, but even the smallest
 teardrop can ripple into memory. Her memories flood through her eyes,
 unleashing tides.

 Drink, drink, my darling, drink while her soup's hot!

>eat lady

 Wonderful soup, beautiful soup, pouring in torrents from her eyes!
 Stand underneath and let her teardrops rain into your mouth. "O woe! O

 unparalleled, but as her sorrow deepens more soups cascade down her
 cheeks: bisque, bouillon, even bouillabaisse.

 Quickly, before her sorrow cools! You'll never sample stock as rich as
 these sobs splashed across your face. Don't let them waste! Broth
 beaded with clear floating fat, chowder enriched with butter, seasoned

 gratinéed. Watching you slurp her tears, she wails again: "O woe! O

 Her broken heart's boiled over. Brace yourself.

 Lamented fate, what cauldrons you stir in the soul! You've no
 compassion, no remorse! What you've got is an artist's sense for when
 to sprinkle melodrama's spice, when to thicken a broth with
 wretchedness. Our ladling lady's overcome with tears to bring the
 bower down.

 Soup runs over the rubble, streams into the stairs. Bread breaks as
 the floor crumbles underfoot. Phantom screeching splinters the moon.
 Stew nearly drowns you with every swallow, but you're not drowned:
 you're buoyant on spooned catharsis. Threads float around your sides,
 unraveled from a ruined tapestry. Sopped chambers sink. Waves flush
 you ashore in the undercroft, and with one final keening shriek the
 castle's ghost is gone, nothing now but a memory left on your tongue.

 Fourth course: eaten.
 Fourth course: eaten.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Undercroft</span>
 Come and leave as you like. This red-velvet chamber's vacant, with no
 one left to ensure prisoners stay locked away.

 Westward lies the creamery, southward the dungeon, and eastward the
 armory has been destroyed.

>inventory

 You have a hole in your stomach, and you're slathered with gore.

>examine armory

 If you'd like to see the armory, try walking east.

>go east

 I hope you ate what cheese you wanted when you had the chance. The
 armory's demolished, buried utterly beneath chambers collapsed during
 the castle ghost's lament.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon</span>
 Blue flambeaux undulate, and in their flames gleam devices galore
 constructed to pry screams and more from prisoners. Don't sit down on
 that judas chair. Steer clear the rack. Give wide berth to the
 breaking wheel. They're occupied already by corpses.

 Northward a corridor leads to the undercroft. Open cells lie westward,
 eastward, and southward.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (east cell)</span>
 Against one wall towers a pastry maiden with its cage ajar, and in
 that cage a secret passage leads southward through the toothpicks.
 Although their panel's been sprung wide, a skewered corpse still
 dangles from the spikes.

 Westward an open doorway leads to the dungeon.

>go south

 You creep through the secret passage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Buttery</span>
 Down here the air is cool and dry and still. Along the walls are
 stacked the castle's butts, rack upon rack, enormous barrels corked to
 keep fine beverages in store. The greatest barrel's opened to reveal a
 hidden passage to the north.

 Upward a staircase runs to the kitchen.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Nobody now remains to tend this kitchen's hearth or knead the dough
 rolled on the countertops. Neglected saucepans cool. Flour has settled
 on the floor, tracked with footprints.

 Westward a doorway opens to the castle gate; stairs wind upward to the
 pantry and downward to the buttery; northward the banquet hall lies in
 ruin.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gateway</span>
 You stand before the castle's only gate. Through this passage must
 pass all seeking admittance or leave, whether they be the fairest or
 most squalid amongst us.

 Southward the great drawbridge has been lowered.

 Walk northward, noble guests, to the courtyard; slink eastward,
 servants, serfs bearing supplies, through that low kitchen door. All
 to their stationed ranks.

>go south

 Your footsteps crunch across the bridge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fondue Fens</span>
 Wasteland, blasted and bubbling with molten chocolate bogs. Steam
 rises to the stars. Across the fens, impaled at every angle, skewers
 thrust into the ground, the night sky silhouettes human corpses.

 A carrion crow perches atop a nearby skewer, picking for supper.

 Northward the drawbridge stretches back to the castle, and a downward
 scramble along its embankment would see you into the moat.

>examine bogs

 Here's desolation, darling. Here's conquest.

>examine steam

 Climbing vapors melt into the dark.

>examine fens

 Here's desolation, darling. Here's conquest.

>examine skewers

 Long and two-pronged. Skewers you'd use to spear fruit meant for
 gilding in a chocolate pot, but twisted with handles submerged, prongs
 staked skyward. You could not count their quantity.

>examine corpses

 Not fresh corpses by any means. These have been left to rot for such a
 span their skin's shrunken, muscles withered to bone-stuck strings.
 Enemies all, and planted for a cautionary wood. Challenge the castle:
 here's what will happen.

>examine crow

 When soldiers lose their guts in war, crows find them on the
 battlefield. Now here's a crow fed on burst bellies aplenty. Its
 feathers drip with carrion. Its beak's a splintered bone. Its eyes are
 ruby hemorrhoids in its head.

 "Fresh gore, fresh gore!" caws the crow. "I smell fresh gore. I'll
 follow you. I want fresh guts for my supper. Take me to find fresh
 guts!"

 It flaps over to land on your shoulder. Soon it has pecked the gore
 from your body.

 My dear, you have a pet.

>go north

 Your footsteps crunch across the bridge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gateway</span>
 You stand before the castle's only gate. Through this passage must

 Southward the great drawbridge has been lowered.

 Walk northward, noble guests, to the courtyard; slink eastward,
 servants, serfs bearing supplies, through that low kitchen door. All
 to their stationed ranks.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 No common bailey, but a garden with walls trellis-wound. Its master
 hauls herself from bed to bed, throwing her tendrils out to drag her
 leafy head across the ground. That would be Jenny Lettucehead, the
 castle gardener extraordinaire. Here you're in her domain, patches
 plump with young cabbages.

 A few savoy heads mewl for Jenny's attention.

 Northward, below a balcony, a door opens into the balance gallery, and
 southward are the gateway and drawbridge.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balance Gallery</span>
 Northward a gleaming golden door would lead into the chapel, but it's
 sealed. Beneath your feet, the floor's plated with silver polished to
 a mirror's shine.

 Southward lies the courtyard, westward's a tapestried chamber, but
 eastward the castle's collapsed.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Tapestry</span>
 Across the western wall's another tapestry embroidered with a grand
 combat, in which this castle's vilest invader, the mouse king, had his
 tail chopped. Milk flows into the chamber from the south, streaming
 through breadstick grates set in the floor.

 A durkha guard stands, southward, at the entrance into the great hall.

 Eastward's the balance gallery; upward a staircase runs to the solar.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Solar</span>
 Omelettes carpet the floor. A brazier crackles merrily, surrounded by
 soft lard couches with marshmallow pillows. In the corner, only nougat
 scraps remain from the cage you consumed. Its former tenant caws on
 your shoulder.

 Southward you'll find the baron's cabinet, eastward the scriptorium,
 and downward stairs lead to the western tapestry.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Baron's Cabinet</span>
 A giant fireplace burns in a vacant room. Without the baron here to
 dwarf its size, the flames seem to lash higher than ever.

 Northward you could return to the solar; southward you'd step into the
 hearth.

>go south

 You tiptoe carefully around the flames.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fireplace</span>
 Sweat beads your brow. Heat ripples in the air above the hearth. Stand
 far against the fireplace's rearmost wall; there you'll have space to
 skirt the blaze.

 Northward you'd inch back to the baron's cabinet, and a doorway leads
 down into a narrow spiral stair.

>go down

 As you spiral downward, the air cools.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall (south end)</span>
 Your footsteps slide on bloody flags, and every corner's heaped with
 broken bones. Midway down the hall rests a great cow whose bulk traps
 her within the room, pinioned between the walls, unable to reverse and
 see what's happened to her southern side. She has been hacked, she has
 been half-butchered, her ribs sawn and her muscles rent to leave a
 cavern in her flank.

 Upward a hidden stair leads to the baron's fireplace; northward you
 could climb into the cow.

 "Abattoir! Abattoir!" caws the carrion crow. "Gore! Gore! I'll eat
 fresh guts tonight!"

 It flaps ahead, ripping strips from the cow. Once it finds the wound
 carved into her flesh, it burrows through, plunging into the carnage
 with a scavenger's hearty passion. As for the cow's response: her moos
 are thunder-booms.

>examine cow

 O mighty cow, what meat you might provide. You are a meat-filled
 mountainside! Miners could labor underneath your skin, unearth cuts
 marbled with the finest fat, translucent, white, creamy, carve brisket
 from your bones and wield pickaxes for kabobs. You'd feed a thousand
 mouths and more. You've already yielded meat by the tonne. Now here,
 my dear, is something worth dropping your jaw over. No common cow can
 open her body for a market.

>go north

 You climb into the cow again.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall (inside a cow)</span>
 Bloody plumage thrashes your face. Claws pinch and sling intestines
 left and right. Your pet crow's gone berserk, slurping down
 chitterlings like worms, jabbing its beak and talons into the cow's
 massive glands. All this madness must put immense pressure on her
 udder.

 Southward's your only exit. Take it, dear.

>examine udder

 An udder seen from the inside. No teats to suck, just slick flesh
 mounds ligament-lashed to her pelvis. They hardly hang; rather, they
 rest upon her inner skin, covered with chitterlings.

>go south

 You crawl back through the cow's ripped hide.

 Some guardsmen make others scramble: here's such a one. He towers at

 stone, harder than steel. That's durkha, my dear, champion amongst
 cheeses, aged for decades until its curds could crack an overeager
 jaw.

 All the water's been drained, and now this trench is brackish with

 Protruding from this mound are a guard's legs.

 Upward you could scramble back to the fens.

>examine guard

 Poor soul. He never guessed he'd pass the pearly gates through a
 privy.

>examine filth

 Droppings have splattered here for years, none too great nor too small
 to contribute. Don't suppose those alone sat in the garderobe made
 this summit: pisspots and trash from every quarter find themselves
 thrown to the moat. It's a most equalizing muck.

>eat guard

 Waste not, want not. A fine motto. Once you've withdrawn him from the
 muck, you devour his jarlsberg arms. He's mild—too mild, perhaps,
 considering how deeply the moat's filth has already imbued him with
 its own flavor. That nutty aftertaste would be more pleasant with
 alternate scenery.

 Around the castle wraps the moat. Its trench would trap whatever

 Southward you'll find the baron's cabinet, eastward the scriptorium,
 and downward stairs lead to the western tapestry.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Baron's Cabinet</span>
 A giant fireplace burns in a vacant room. Without the baron here to
 dwarf its size, the flames seem to lash higher than ever.

 Northward you could return to the solar; southward you'd step into the

 You descend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Tapestry</span>
 Across the western wall's another tapestry embroidered with a grand
 combat, in which this castle's vilest invader, the mouse king, had his
 tail chopped. Milk flows into the chamber from the south, streaming
 through breadstick grates set in the floor.

 A durkha guard stands, southward, at the entrance into the great hall.

 Eastward's the balance gallery; upward a staircase runs to the solar.

>examine milk

 Milk's streaming from the great hall, dripping down through
 breadsticks latticed underfoot. Without these grates to drain the
 room, we'd have milk flooding out into the gallery as well.

>examine grates

 Milk's streaming from the great hall, dripping down through
 breadsticks latticed underfoot from wall to wall. Without these grates
 to drain the room, we'd have milk flooding out into the gallery as
 well.

>eat grates

 These breadsticks aren't the best, one must confess. They're rather
 stale, but then again, they're being used for drainage grates. You
 break them from the floor to break them with your teeth.

 "Halt!" says the durkha guard, advancing to stop you—and breaking
 further through the broken floor. You tumble along with him, land
 unharmed atop mushrooms.
 unharmed atop mushrooms.
 He lands less well, with a loud splash.
 He lands less well, with a loud splash.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Creamery</span>
 Runnels trace down the walls where cream has leaked through ceiling
 grates. Inside a vat thrashes the durkha guard, unable to climb out as
 his rind softens in the sour milk. Mould carpets the room's corners,
 mushrooms in the damp, and a bloated corpse has slipped from a torn
 cheesecloth bag.

 Eastward's the undercroft.

>eat guard

 Now you can take your time with him, as one must take one's time to
 chew durkha. Oh yes, it's still slow-going, even after he's been
 soaked, with every bite a contest between your teeth and his cheese,
 but your teeth win. He calls you "Wastrel!" and "Blackguard!" until
 the end. Even his insults are scrumptious. You have served well, noble
 durkha.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Undercroft</span>
 Come and leave as you like. This red-velvet chamber's vacant, with no
 one left to ensure prisoners stay locked away.

 Westward lies the creamery, southward the dungeon, and eastward the
 armory has been destroyed.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon</span>
 Blue flambeaux undulate, and in their flames gleam devices galore
 constructed to pry screams and more from prisoners. Don't sit down on
 that judas chair. Steer clear the rack. Give wide berth to the
 breaking wheel. They're occupied already by corpses.

 Northward a corridor leads to the undercroft. Open cells lie westward,
 eastward, and southward.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon (east cell)</span>
 Against one wall towers a pastry maiden with its cage ajar, and in
 that cage a secret passage leads southward through the toothpicks.
 Although their panel's been sprung wide, a skewered corpse still
 dangles from the spikes.

 Westward an open doorway leads to the dungeon.

>go south

 You creep through the secret passage.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Buttery</span>
 Down here the air is cool and dry and still. Along the walls are
 stacked the castle's butts, rack upon rack, enormous barrels corked to
 keep fine beverages in store. The greatest barrel's opened to reveal a
 hidden passage to the north.

 Upward a staircase runs to the kitchen.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Nobody now remains to tend this kitchen's hearth or knead the dough
 rolled on the countertops. Neglected saucepans cool. Flour has settled

 Westward a doorway opens to the castle gate; stairs wind upward to the
 pantry and downward to the buttery; northward the banquet hall lies in
 ruin.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gateway</span>
 You stand before the castle's only gate. Through this passage must

 Walk northward, noble guests, to the courtyard; slink eastward,
 servants, serfs bearing supplies, through that low kitchen door. All
 to their stationed ranks.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 No common bailey, but a garden with walls trellis-wound. Its master
 hauls herself from bed to bed, throwing her tendrils out to drag her
 leafy head across the ground. That would be Jenny Lettucehead, the
 castle gardener extraordinaire. Here you're in her domain, patches
 plump with young cabbages.

 They're never done mewling for their caretaker, these savoy children.

 Northward, below a balcony, a door opens into the balance gallery, and
 southward are the gateway and drawbridge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balance Gallery</span>
 Northward a gleaming golden door would lead into the chapel, but it's

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Great Hall (north end)</span>
 What might have been a hall packed with courtiers is cleared to leave
 flagstones streaming with shallow cream. Kneel down, and tremble if
 you will, knowing that awe would never be misplaced before the
 monstrous cow whose bulk rests midway down the room and fills its
 width with flesh patterned in black and white. She is ideal; she is
 supreme; she is the cow that other cows might dream to be as men dream
 to be gods.

 Her eyes follow you and she moos with discomfort, as though pleading
 your assistance.

 Northward you can take your leave to the western tapestry.

>examine cow

 Gigantic would blush at her size, titanic would stammer, colossal
 might stand on tiptoe and barely scrape her hooves. No cow was ever
 such a cow! Reclined, her udder swollen on the floor, her forelegs
 shoved under a dewlap that could crush ten typical heifers, she cannot
 budge her neck, she cannot shift her weight, her rear and front ends
 are pressed into the surrounding walls. Step to her side? Perish the
 thought! You could not push a flea around her flanks, she fills the
 room with such fleshy fullness.

>examine floor

 She can't help it, our cow: she drips. Her drippings trickle to the
 floor, but they're nothing compared with what her teats hold in
 reserve.

>examine udder

 An udder's never wanted milking more. Swollen, straining, pink dugs
 bulging. What hands could squeeze teats vast as these? Your arms can
 barely manage a nipple.

>eat cow

 Gracious, this cow is no tartare to be nibbled living and raw. She
 moos with arch disdain; you pull your mouth away; you could not tear a
 chunk from her thick hide. All the better when her udder begs with
 bigness for milking.

>eat udder

 Ah, now she starts to stream: a subtle spurt at first, but stronger as
 you squeeze her teats and pull white jets from her nipples. Not pure
 white, no, but tinged with mild luscious yellowness. That's fat for
 you, rich, creamy fat to thicken every squirting line whose liquid
 sprinkles on your lips.

>eat udder

 Harder, harder you pull, more resolute with every tug, twisting her
 teats downward to aim their milk into your mouth. High overhead she
 moos and her moos resonate throughout the hall, within the vaults,
 rumble the walls. Guzzle as quickly as you can, there's more milk than
 will fill your throat, spilling over your lips to splash the stones.

>eat udder

 All your milking's done nothing to empty her swollen teats. They
 bulge; she moos; your arms ache as you pull that massive pink udder.
 Now her nipples are blasting milk across the flagstone floor, spray
 scattering, splattering walls, raining over the room. She tries and
 fails to readjust her weight, can't shift her hooves. Moo, moo, you
 cow, that's it, push out your milk, spill everything.

>eat udder

 Yes, yes, eyes shielded from the spray, you're almost there… one
 final
 tug… one last twist on her pinkest teat… she moos a long low lowing
 moo… you wanted this, oh, how does one say no… yes, yes, that's it,
 no, no… take what you will… drink me, I'm yours… that's why…
 that's
 why…
 why…

 Her udder bursts.
 Her udder bursts.
 …that's why she's here: to be emptied.
 …that's why she's here: to be emptied.
 Milk crashes from her body. Black and white spots sag, her skin
 shrivels, merely a husk to house the fluid frothing at the walls.
 Flagstones clack loose. Vaults groan, buckle. An ocean uncorked churns
 inside the hall, bones flotsam on buttercream tides whose waves
 submerge you as the castle cracks.

 An undercurrent's snared you, drawn you into the whirlpool. Around,
 around rushes the cream with force to whip its foam; custard cascades
 into the moat; with squawks a panicked crow wings to the wastes as
 wings collapse. My word, she's a mudslide in milk, rooms compromised
 and crumbling, debris and cottage cheese flooding your mouth. Sprawl
 where you've fallen. Spread your arms. Embrace the avalanche with open
 jaws. Drink deep, drink well until it ends. You'll never savor dairy
 more divine.
 more divine.
 Fifth course: eaten.
 Fifth course: eaten.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Moat</span>
 Milk runs along the moat's bottom, and from its surface rises a
 nightsoil mound that not even a flood could wash away.

 Scramble upward again and you'll regain the fens.

>go up

 You crawl back up the embankment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fondue Fens</span>
 Wasteland, blasted and bubbling with molten chocolate bogs. Steam
 rises to the stars. Across the fens, impaled at every angle, skewers
 thrust into the ground, the night sky silhouettes human corpses.

 scramble along its embankment would see you into the moat.

 As you stand in the gallery, the floor sinks. <span class="floydstyle em">Click click click</span>

 No common bailey, but a garden with walls trellis-wound. Its master
 hauls herself from bed to bed, throwing her tendrils out to drag her
 leafy head across the ground. That would be Jenny Lettucehead, the
 castle gardener extraordinaire. Here you're in her domain, patches
 plump with young cabbages.

 She could use some fresh soil herself, our overworked Jenny.

 Northward, below a balcony, a door opens into the balance gallery, and
 southward are the gateway and drawbridge.

>eat bed

 You eat another cabbage. Jenny won't stop you.

>eat jenny

 You won't catch her, my dear. Your only hope's finding a method to
 plant her in place. After all this gardening, I'm sure that she'd
 appreciate pausing to have a bite.

>eat soil

 Even the dirt is delicious, with aromatic coffee grounds mingled
 amongst its clods. You dig into the soil and shovel it down.

>jenny, eat soil

 You can't help gulping what you'd say.

>examine soil

 Moist soil's been turned here, enriched by buckets from the moat. A
 castle never wants for compost after its chamberpots have been tossed.
 Jelly worms twist and wriggle through the dirt.

>examine jenny

 A lettucehead like hers would break the widest wheelbarrow and command
 every ribbon at the fair. Put away your spades and seedling dreams,
 farmhands; you're through. Pearl onions at her maize earlobes. Ripe
 cherry cheeks. Jenny, let's see your carrot jaws. A rather sharkish
 smile, hasn't she? Quell your concerns and count your blessings she's
 no predator. Soil's her standard fare, the richer, fouler the better.
 After a battle, when the land's imbued with rot, flowers still bloom.

>enter bed

 You might go northward or southward.

>enter soil

 You might go northward or southward.

>cry

 Never despair, my dear.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gateway</span>
 You stand before the castle's only gate. Through this passage must
 pass all seeking admittance or leave, whether they be the fairest or
 most squalid amongst us.

 Southward the great drawbridge has been lowered.

 Walk northward, noble guests, to the courtyard; slink eastward,
 servants, serfs bearing supplies, through that low kitchen door. All
 to their stationed ranks.

>go south

 Your footsteps crunch across the bridge.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fondue Fens</span>
 Wasteland, blasted and bubbling with molten chocolate bogs. Steam
 rises to the stars. Across the fens, impaled at every angle, skewers
 thrust into the ground, the night sky silhouettes human corpses.

 Northward the drawbridge stretches back to the castle, and a downward
 scramble along its embankment would see you into the moat.

>go down

 You scramble down the embankment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Moat</span>
 Milk runs along the moat's bottom, and from its surface rises a
 nightsoil mound that not even a flood could wash away.

 Scramble upward again and you'll regain the fens.

>get mound

 You are going to <span class="floydstyle em">eat</span>.

 Praise all that's sweet, child, you're not a chamberpot! And yet
 you've dug your hands into the filth and started packing down
 fistfuls. Feculent morsels dribble on your chin. Your cheeks balloon.
 Your willpower's commendable. Don't swallow, darling: spare yourself
 and <span class="floydstyle em">spit</span>.

>go up

 You crawl back up the embankment.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fondue Fens</span>
 Wasteland, blasted and bubbling with molten chocolate bogs. Steam

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 No common bailey, but a garden with walls trellis-wound. Its master
 hauls herself from bed to bed, throwing her tendrils out to drag her
 leafy head across the ground. That would be Jenny Lettucehead, the
 castle gardener extraordinaire. Here you're in her domain, patches
 plump with young cabbages.

 There's cooing from one nursery, and Jenny's tendrils scramble to
 investigate.

 Northward, below a balcony, a door opens into the balance gallery, and
 southward are the gateway and drawbridge.

>drop soil

 I told you, you're going to <span class="floydstyle em">eat</span>.

 Your mouth's packed. Go ahead and <span class="floydstyle em">spit</span>.

>spit

 Bend over, yes, heave out the filth, puke everything into a steaming
 pile till your mouth's empty.

 Now wipe your chin and stand aside: Jenny's at hand.

 Vines slither toward the midden that you've made. She smells it, Jenny
 does, manure fit for pomegranate queens and cabbage kings. She'll have
 that feast or this garden's not her land to command. Her lettucehead
 crashes across the yard, she plants herself, tendrils surging to scoop
 the filth into her yawning maw.

>go up

 You might go northward or southward.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 No common bailey, but a garden with walls trellis-wound. Its master's
 feasting at a mound whose stench steams in the nighttime air. That
 would be Jenny Lettucehead, vines slithering to convey fetid morsels
 to her mouth. Here you're in her domain, patches plump with young
 cabbages.

 Northward, below a balcony, a door opens into the balance gallery, and
 southward are the gateway and drawbridge.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Castle Gateway</span>
 You stand before the castle's only gate. Through this passage must
 pass all seeking admittance or leave, whether they be the fairest or
 most squalid amongst us.

 Southward the great drawbridge has been lowered.

 Walk northward, noble guests, to the courtyard; slink eastward,
 servants, serfs bearing supplies, through that low kitchen door. All
 to their stationed ranks.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 Nobody now remains to tend this kitchen's hearth or knead the dough
 rolled on the countertops. Neglected saucepans cool. Flour has settled
 on the floor, tracked with footprints.

 Westward a doorway opens to the castle gate; stairs wind upward to the
 pantry and downward to the buttery; northward the banquet hall lies in
 ruin.

>go up

 You ascend the staircase.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pantry</span>
 Don't knock your head on vegetables above, enormous bundles that drape
 from the ceiling's beams. Here are eggplants in a clump, and turnips
 rocking where you've nudged a brace.

 Westward you'll find the gatehouse, downward a stair spirals into the
 kitchen, but northward the storeroom's collapsed.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gatehouse</span>
 Through a narrow window there's a view across the moat. Another hole
 once ran a chain to the drawbridge: no more. Root beer bottles lie
 tumbled beneath a table.

 Westward the garderobe's collapsed, leaving only a ledge, and eastward
 you'd return to the pantry.

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Broken Ledge</span>
 When the great hall toppled, it took the garderobe with it. Nothing's
 left but this perch newly exposed to the courtyard down to the north.

 Eastward you could walk, carefully, back into the gatehouse.

>examine garden

 In the darkness, you can't see much below, but there's no missing
 Jenny Lettucehead. She's planted herself right beneath your perch.

>go down

 What's that balled in your throat? A lump?

 My dear, gulp down your fear and jump!

 Skyward you leap, earthward you fall, and with a leafy smash you crash
 into the salad greens crowning the castle gardener.
 into the salad greens crowning the castle gardener.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard (atop Jenny Lettucehead)</span>
 Sweet nectar, what supreme salad is this! Arugula, ripe tomatoes,
 avocados in creamy halves, croutons larger than cannonballs, diced
 apples and poached pears and parmesan sprinkled as liberal as you
 please. Olives roll underneath your feet, toasted walnuts might stub
 your toes, everything's drizzled well with truffle oil vinaigrette.

 Jenny's not unaware you're on her head. She groans aloud.

>eat jenny

 With vegetation all around, you dive forward into the ground: no
 ground at all, but leaves layered on leaves enwrapping Jenny's giant
 head. Burrow and bite. Your jaws find purchase everywhere. Shred,
 swallow, shred, swallow again. Claw clumps and gobble them until
 they're gone.

 Vines slither heavenward to dislodge you.

>eat jenny

 Now what's this underneath your gobbled greens: alfalfa sprouts? They
 burst through shredded foliage, unfurling budded follicles. Fistfuls
 are yours to yank and chomp, devouring more than bushels would bind,
 than bales would hold. You'll have more, more arugula, more lettuce
 leaves, more salad greens.

 What's that? Not long enough? Jenny's vines strain to reach you and
 she roars.

>eat jenny

 Your jaws drip mulch. Fibers entwine your teeth. You crunch more
 lettuce leaves, you eat more salad greens, you dive deeper until you
 bite broccoli. Florets forest another layer under the arugula: raw,
 steamed, cheddar-dipped, creamed broccoli, varieties that vanish down
 your throat in a twinkling.

 Oh she's displeased, mighty displeased!

>eat jenny

 Burrow more and asparagus reveal their rainbow stalks. They're
 lattice-laced beneath the lettuce leaves, tinged with ultramarine and
 rosy pink, finely stippled, mauve and azure, dripping butter with
 every bite. Firm, exquisite asparagus, prepare to be swallowed.

 Eat, eat, darling. Delay for nothing now you're on her head.

>eat jenny

 Caterpillars at their most industrious would struggle to chew rifts
 such as you have through Jenny's head. She's pockmarked, semi-circles
 edging each hole bitten by your teeth. Leaves strain under your
 weight. You're sinking deeper into her salad. Layers collapse, veined
 networks shred, branches batter your face as you tumble past lettuce
 leaves.
 leaves.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Inside Jenny Lettucehead</span>
 At her core Jenny's chambered; roots trace through her walls; and what
 should beat amongst her leaves but an artichoke heart.

>eat heart

 Yes, ma'am, even a peck… a pickled pepper peck… enough to feed
 their
 little mouths… what I'd give for a pear… apples, an artichoke… oh
 please, ma'am, just one lettuce head… as you wish, my darling.
 please, ma'am, just one lettuce head… as you wish, my darling.
 Her heart is yours.
 Her heart is yours.
 Green torrents pour into your gut, vines rooted to the artichoke
 you've devoured. Jenny's screaming. Her leaves heave as you gnash
 inside, lettuce funneled into your throat, your jaws chomping to
 engulf carrots, onions, and cherries. Maize kernels pop. Your arms are
 vinaigrette-slathered, reaching to guide more salad into your stomach.

 She's reaching too: her tendrils cling to trellises. Down they topple.
 Her vines enwrap the balcony; down cracks the balcony. She drags
 cabbages wailing from their nurseries. Vegetables, fruit: the garden's
 gone; one final vine flickers outside your lips until you slurp it
 down, and burp, and contemplate the silent night.
 down, and burp, and contemplate the silent night.
 Sixth course: eaten.
 Sixth course: eaten.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Courtyard</span>
 What was a garden's now nothing but parched soil.

 Through a quadrant above, you can see stars.

 Northward, the balance gallery; southward, the gate.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balance Gallery</span>
 Northward a gleaming golden door would lead into the chapel, but it's
 sealed. Beneath your feet, the floor's plated with silver polished to
 a mirror's shine.

 Southward lies the courtyard; westward and eastward, both wings have
 collapsed.

>wait

 You consume time.

 As you stand in the gallery, the floor sinks, and chains <span class="floydstyle em">click</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">click click click click click</span> behind walls. Contraptions groan,
 balances shift, and the great golden door rises. Mist sparkling with
 frost rolls over the threshold. Snowflakes brush past your cheeks.
 Bright light streams from the space beyond.

 Northward, the castle's chapel is open.

>go north

 My dear, look at you! I could shed a tear. You've done it, conquered
 the castle, cleaned out the rooms as a good child ought to clean a
 plate. Only the greatest eaters pass the balance gallery, and you've
 proven your stomach's worth. You are a champion.

 Come, come, my sweet darling, approach.

 You might have finished dinner, but there's still dessert.
 You might have finished dinner, but there's still dessert.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Chapel</span>
 Everything's laid for you, my dear. You're brilliant, bathed in
 rainbows shot through stained-sherbet windows. No matter where you
 look, ice cream shimmers. Popsicles drip and glisten from loggias
 overhead. I couldn't be more proud to see you now.

 A luscious fur's draped across the altar.

>examine windows

 Transmuted moonbeams glide through frozen panes. Each sherbet panel's
 frosted with colors that flood the chapel with soft pastel light.

>examine ice

 Supreme scoops sprinkled with sprinkles and swirled with fudge,
 spotted with chocolate chips, topped with whipped cream and bright red
 cherries.

>examine popsicles

 Arched galleries surround the room, bound by iced rails that onlookers
 might lean upon, and from their lower ledges hang the longest and most
 mesmerizing popsicles. Each tip sparkles.

>examine fur

 You wouldn't think a rodent would have such sumptuous fur, but this
 royal fur's better groomed than any mortal king's coiffure. It's found
 a higher purpose here than its skinned bearer could have given it. Now
 what it needs is something fitting to adorn its spread.

 Just one tip from my golden virge and—la!—a shining droplet falls.
 There's a soft hiss, and then a jeweled cup steams where it struck the
 altar.

>examine cup

 Rose-red with beatings in it, as if the drink were alive, all the
 walls in the chapel dyed with rosy colors leaping from the cup. It's
 haloed, holy, and it's yours.

>eat it

 As you lift the chalice, what's inside shines bright as fire, and you
 start to tingle as you sip the hot beverage. It's something that
 you've never tasted, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warms you
 right down to your toes.

 What you've imbibed is power. Nothing else compares.

>get fur

 Your veins burn and your eyes blaze from the drink. Give it a moment
 longer and your vision will torch holes through this realm's veil. You
 see, darling, you've never been alone, not even when you found
 yourself enchained in the dungeon. I've charmed each challenge and
 chamber especially to test your appetite. My hosts have been your
 spectators. Now you'll perceive them too.

>wait

 Here, dear, I'll guide your gaze aloft: there they are in the loggias,
 crowding to gain a better view. Their grey faces and hairy hands and
 glittering, flittering wings unfold from hidden regions as your
 perception sharpens. What rascals, slapping their knees with delight.
 Oh, how they hoot and howl to see you sweat!

 You <span class="floydstyle em">are</span> sweating rather a lot.

 This chapel's grown from cold to piping hot. Popsicles trickle. Ice
 cream melts. Sherbet runs into puddles that bubble, and your pores
 ooze grease thick enough to fork. You're sweltering.

>eat ice

 Hold still. You need more time to cook. You're roasting as the chamber
 roasts. Flames lick your flanks. That scintillating scent is your own
 sausage sizzling. You ought to see yourself, darling. You'd salivate.
 You're absolutely succulent. Every instant, your glistening flesh
 plumps more wonderfully.

>go south

 Listen to those hurrahs! There's mayhem in the loggias, cheers and
 trumpets and whistling, and down they pour to surround you with
 revelry. At long last, you're crisped perfectly. Your steaming pork
 begins to cool, although your fat's still popping as it fries inside
 your skin, and every courtier bows to kiss the ground beneath your
 hooves. They're groveling in your honor.

 I knew, as soon as your hunger had summoned me, that you'd triumph.

>wait

 From this hour, you'll sit at my elbow. Your childhood, your
 innocence, your past's been baked away, but you've no need for such
 burdens. I'll cover you with fragrant cloves instead. It's the rare
 mortal that ascends to the Sugarplum Fairy's court. Only a handful in
 a hundred years have managed it, and you've made them a mouthful this
 evening.

 But years are mere nothings.

 Let hundreds, even thousands pass.

 One night another starving soul will dream a road to my castle, and
 I'll dress every chamber with candy, fly bacon standards from spires
 that stretch into the stars. As long as stomachs grumble, mouths must
 eat. We'll always have a feast.
