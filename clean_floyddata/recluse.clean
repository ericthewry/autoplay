 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.


 J. Daggett Winton, archeologist, explorer, inventor, mathematician,
 philosopher.  Director, Winton Antiquities Research Foundation.
 Chairman of the Board, Winton International.  Holder of thirty-seven
 patents in fields as diverse as Genetics and Game Theory.  Rumored to
 have the largest privately-held collection of historical artifacts in
 the world.

 You're looking forward to the chance to actually meet the legendary
 man.  Your errand is trivial - special private courier assigned to
 deliver a small, sealed package, in-person delivery required, contents
 unknown.  Your task is made a bit more difficult because immediately
 following the death of J. Daggett's lovely young bride Emmeline some
 three years ago, he quietly withdrew into the depths of his
 magnificent Gothic mansion, and no one has had any direct contact with
 him since.

 Following his withdrawal, the world added one more title to Mr.
 Winton's extensive list of accomplishments...

 Main Entrance
 You are standing before the main entrance to a huge, foreboding Gothic
 mansion.  A massive pair of solid oak doors leads inside.  To the
 south marble steps lead down to the gravel driveway behind you.  At
 the moment the doors are closed, and there is no one in sight.  There
 is a polished brass plaque mounted on the wall next to the doors.

 Your car broke down a mile up the road, and you're eager to complete
 your delivery and get started on your long walk back to town.  You
 can't see a bell or buzzer of any kind near the doors, so you might as
 well try knocking.

 (First-time players are encouraged to view the TIPS before
 proceeding.)

 RECLUSE Playing Tips

 The following tips provide general advice about playing RECLUSE.  No
 specific information about any game task or puzzle is provided, but
 they may help you think of some additional things to try if you're
 stuck.

 1.  If an object has something written on it you may need to type
 "read [object]" to read it.  Typing "examine [object]" will only
 include the readable text if the object's primary purpose is to be
 read (like a sign or plaque).

 2.  Likewise, if an object conceals something you will usually need to
 type "look in/under/behind [object]" or "search [object]" to find it.
 Typing "examine [object]" will show you a description of the object,
 not what it's hiding.

 3.  Examine everything.  If components or additional items are
 mentioned in the description examine those too.  Even if you don't
 discover anything new some of the descriptions can be entertaining.

 4.  Try everything.  Drink some water, kiss a creature, toss a coin
 into a fountain, whatever pops into your head.  Many objects provide
 custom responses to actions that are reasonable for the object (like
 drinking water) but unnecessary to the game.  You can always type UNDO
 if it backfires on you.

 5.  Try things multiple times.  Sometimes you'll get a different
 result on subsequent tries.  However, once you start getting the same
 response over and over, try something else.

 6.  A number of new verbs are available in RECLUSE.  Don't worry about
 trying to remember them.  Most of them are not required to complete
 the game, and the usage of the few that are should be obvious.  The
 rest are simply there as a player convenience, and to make certain
 in-game actions seem more natural.  They are:

 ALERTS, ALERTS ON/OFF (manage unwinnable game alerts, ON by default)
 COUNT
 DEFLATE, DEFLATE WITH
 DELIVER
 DIVE, DIVE IN
 DRINK FROM
 GET WITH
 HANG ON/FROM
 INFLATE, INFLATE WITH
 LICENSE (show the end-user license agreement)
 LOAD, LOAD WITH
 LOWER
 PICK, PICK WITH
 RAISE
 RAKE
 REPAIR, REPAIR WITH
 RIDE/PADDLE [direction], RIDE/PADDLE [vehicle] [direction]
 SCREW, SCREW INTO
 SHARPEN, SHARPEN WITH
 SHOOT, SHOOT AT/WITH
 SWIM, SWIM IN
 TIE, TIE TO
 TOUCH WITH
 UNTIE, UNTIE FROM
 WADE, WADE IN
 YELL AT

 7.  There is also one standard verb that is critically important in
 RECLUSE.  You've heard it before.  I'm going to say it again.  SAVE
 OFTEN!  Yes, you can get the game in an unwinnable state.  Yes, there
 are puzzles that must be completed within a certain number of steps.
 Yes, backtracking to a previous state after using trial and error to
 figure out how something is done will be required.  So don't rely
 solely on undo.  Save, save, SAVE.

 8.  If you do get stuck try the Hint system.  It contains both guided
 hints that start by offering gentle nudges and progress to outright
 spoilers, and a walkthrough which is a step-by-step solution to the
 entire game.  The Hint system also contains general (non-spoiler)
 questions, background info on some of the items in the game, and a fun
 things to try section.  One other feature of the hint system is that
 it does its best to hide hints for things you haven't seen yet.  So if
 a task requires steps A, B, and C, you will need to complete A to even
 see the hints for B, and complete A and B to see then hints for C.

 9.  And finally, every effort has been made to ensure that all the
 puzzles in the game are "fair."  My definition of a "fair" puzzle is
 one that you either manage to solve in a logical manner, or one that
 if you do get stuck and ask for help, your reaction to the solution
 is, "I should have thought of that."  If your reaction is, "That makes
 no sense!" or, "I never would have thought of that!" then let the
 author know.  (See CREDITS for contact info.)

>inventory
 You are carrying a package.

>examine package
 The package is about ten inches long by eight wide, and nearly two
 inches thick.  It is securely wrapped in plain brown paper.  It's
 moderately heavy for its size, and doesn't rattle when shaken.  If you
 had to guess you would say it was a book.  There's something printed
 on it.

>read it
 URGENT!
 Deliver to: J. Daggett Winton
 PERSONAL and CONFIDENTIAL

>examine plaque
 Like most plaques it has something engraved on it.


 Admission by Appointment Only

 NO Soliciting!

 Salesmen will be Taken Inside and Tortured

 My, what a cheery little omen.

>examine door
 The oak doors tower over you, dark and foreboding.  They're closed.

>knock on door
 Ignoring a growing sense of impending doom, you reach out and firmly
 rap your knuckles on one of the doors.  The sound is surprisingly
 loud.  You can hear it echoing down the long empty corridor on the
 other side.  You hold your breath.  Nothing happens. You put your ear
 to the door.  Not a sound.  Maybe there's nobody home.  No, wait.
 Sounds like footsteps approaching.  Yes, definitely footsteps.  Long,
 slow, thudding ones.  Uh oh...

 The doors slowly creak open to reveal a heavyset oriental in a tuxedo,
 probably the butler.  He bears a remarkable resemblance to Oddjob from
 the James Bond movie Goldfinger.  He is not smiling, which is just as
 well.  He probably only smiles while he's torturing salesmen.  You try
 not to think about it.

 "Uh...  Hi there.  Is Mr. Winton in by any chance?"

 In one powerful motion, the butler reaches out, grabs the front of
 your shirt, and lifts you six inches off the ground.  Holding you at
 arms length, he demands thickly, "You have appointment?"

 You can hear yourself stammering.  "Uh...  Well actually, no.  But you
 see I have this package..."

 The butler's scowl darkens.  Your eyes widen.  A moment later you're
 flying through the air.  You have been bodily hurled right off the
 steps!  You barely have time to hear him growl, "Next time, have
 appointment," behind you before the gravel driveway floats up to meet
 your pointy head and knocks you silly.

 After regaining consciousness the first thing you notice is a pair of
 shiny black boots just inches in front of your eyes.  You hear the
 metallic snick of a spring-loaded carpenter's tape-measure retracting
 into its case, followed by a rumbling chuckle. The butler, who has
 been squatting beside you, stands and pulls a little spiral notebook
 from his pocket.  He makes an entry, then to nobody in particular
 states, "Sixteen feet, six and one-half inches.  New record!"  The
 boots turn and disappear from your line of sight, and you hear him
 crunching his way back up the driveway.

 You hear the mansion door slam shut, and he is gone.

 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 You see a business card here.

>examine card
 It's a standard business card.  It must have fallen out of the
 butler's pocket when he pulled out his spiral notebook to write down
 his new record.




  PLASTI-SIDE, Inc.

   The Vinyl Siding with the Iron-clad
  Guarantee!


 Dwayne R. Splatz
 Customer Representative

 Hmm...  Looks like some poor siding salesman didn't read the plaque.
 Oh well, not your problem.  On the other hand, at least he managed to
 get himself taken inside.  Which gives you an idea...

 If you just had a few simple props you could easily impersonate a
 salesman, knock on the doors, and in you'd go.  You already have a
 good start in the business card.  Maybe you can find some more of Mr.
 Splatz's stuff.  Yeah, that's the ticket!

 As you look around to see if there's anything else nearby it occurs to
 you that you also might want to find some way to protect yourself once
 you're inside - just in case that torture stuff turns out not to be
 somebody's idea of a lame joke.

>take card
 Taken.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)
 (If you'd prefer not to be notified about score changes in the future,
 type NOTIFY OFF.)

>examine trees
 Every tree here looks pretty much like every other tree here, namely,
 tall and green.  None are very close to the driveway or paths though.
 The groundskeeper must keep them cut back.

>examine hedge
 The hedge is very neatly trimmed and much too thick for you to shove
 your way through.

>examine path
 The path is paved with smooth gray flagstones.  It passes through the
 hedge to the west.

>examine house
 Huge.  Imposing.  More of a palace than a house.  Commissioned by
 Darren Lamont Winton III, J. Daggett's great-grandfather.  Designed by
 noted architect James Renwick, Jr.  (1818-1895).  Built in the latter
 1800's at the height of the Gothic Revival period.  The site selected
 was the top of a cliff overlooking the ocean, backed by five hundred
 densely wooded acres.  Like all great estate houses it has a name.  It
 is called Seacliff.

 The building itself is constructed from dark gray granite.  There are
 multiple towers and row upon row of tall, narrow arched windows.
 Stonework tracery adorns the walls, eaves, and towers.

>search hedge
 The neatly trimmed hedge isn't important.

>look through windows
 The Gothic architecture isn't important.

>go north
 You ascend the marble steps, arriving at...

 Main Entrance
 You are standing before the main entrance to a huge, foreboding Gothic
 mansion.  A massive pair of solid oak doors leads inside.  To the
 south marble steps lead down to the gravel driveway behind you.  At
 the moment the doors are closed, and there is no one in sight.  There
 is a polished brass plaque mounted on the wall next to the doors.

>go west
 You'll have to descend the steps first.

>go south
 You descend the marble steps, arriving at...

 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

>go east
 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

>examine outbuilding
 It's hard to be sure from here but it looks like it might be a garage.

>go north
 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The hedge continues along the driveway to the garage.
 However, unlike the hedge in other parts of the estate, this one is
 rather badly overgrown.  The driveway leads back to the south.

>examine hedge
 The hedge here is thick, bushy, and in serious need of a good
 trimming.

>climb hedge
 The untrimmed hedge isn't important.

>examine garage
 The garage probably started as a carriage house and was converted for
 automobile use once they became the preferred method of
 transportation.  It has the same distinctive architectural style as
 the mansion, however its original wooden carriage doors have been
 replaced with modern steel ones.

 The word "recap" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points
 out an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your
 next command.)

>open side door
 You twist the knob, and much to your surprise the side entry door
 swings effortlessly open.

>in
 Garage
 The garage interior is divided into five open parking bays and a
 service bay equipped with a hydraulic lift and an air compressor.  A
 classic Jaguar E-Type convertible sits on the lift.  A large red tool
 cabinet has been rolled up next to the Jaguar.  The lift is currently
 down.

 A battered old canoe hangs on the wall in bay four.

 A bicycle is parked in bay two.  Its front wheel is secured by a
 bicycle lock.

>admire jaguar
 The word "admire" is not necessary in this story.

>examine cabinet
 The tool cabinet is about four feet tall, red, and mounted on casters
 so that it can be rolled up next to whatever needs to be worked on.
 It has a flat painted top, four standard drawers for wrenches,
 sockets, and the like, and one deep bottom drawer for storing bulky
 items.  All drawers are secured by a single small silver lock.

 Scratched into the paint next to the lock is a small symbol.  It looks
 like the Greek letter Psi, which happens to resemble a trident.  The
 tool cabinet is closed and locked.

>jaguar
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>jaguar
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>examine jaguar
 The E-Type is a real beauty.  Often called an XKE in the States, this
 appears to be an immaculately-restored early Series I roadster done in
 British racing green with a biscuit leather interior.  It has the
 E-Type's distinctive long rounded bonnet, oval air intake, and wire
 wheels.  It appears to be the same model as Austin Powers's "Shaguar,"
 but you decide it looks much better without the Union Jack paint job.

 The top is up and the doors are locked.  It is currently on the lift
 which is down.

>open bonnet
 The Jag's bodywork isn't important.

>examine canoe
 The two-man aluminum canoe hanging from a wall rack in bay four is old
 and battered.  It's had a few to many close encounters with jagged
 rocks, one of which no doubt ripped the gaping hole you can see in its
 bottom.  It's hanging bottom-outward and stored up high to keep it out
 of the way.

>look in canoe
 The hole is too high for you to be able to see into from the garage
 floor.

>save
>cf1
 Saved.

>push cabinet to canoe
 (first standing in the service bay)
 The casters make a grating noise on the concrete as you push the heavy
 tool cabinet under the canoe in bay four.

>stand on cabinet
 Okay, you're now standing on the tool cabinet.

>look in hole
 You lean forward and peer through the hole in the bottom of the canoe.
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the dim interior.  After
 looking for a bit you notice the shadowy outline of a paddle lying
 along the lower side of of the canoe.

>take paddle
 You reach into the hole and grab the paddle.  It's longer than the
 opening and takes a bit of juggling, but you finally manage to slip it
 out of the canoe.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>go down
 Okay, you're no longer on the tool cabinet.

>examine bike
 The bicycle is a 50's Schwinn Black Phantom.  It has red pinstriping
 and lots of chrome trim.  The seat is large and comfortable, and its
 spoked wheels are decked out in white wall street tires.  The front
 fender has an integrated headlight, and the rear has an integrated
 tail light and reflector.  Like many 50's bikes there's a sleek
 horntank mounted under the frame's top tube to give it a bit of a
 motorcycle look.  The classic Schwinn cross-in-a-circle logo adorns
 the chain guard.

 The one piece of non-standard equipment on the bike is a small leather
 pouch attached to the back of its seat.  The Schwinn's front wheel is
 secured by a bicycle lock.

>open pouch
 (first getting out of bay four, then standing in bay two)
 Opening the leather pouch reveals an inner tube patch.

>take patch
 Taken.

>examine patch
 The patch is one of the new "peel and stick" patches.  No adhesives or
 matches required.

>examine headlight
 (the Schwinn's headlight)
 The Schwinn's headlight is turned off

>take it
 You can't have that; it's part of the bicycle.

>examine bay 1
 Aside from the varying patterns of oil stains on its floor, bay one
 look pretty much like the others.

>examine bay 2
 Aside from the varying patterns of oil stains on its floor, bay two
 look pretty much like the others.

 A bicycle is parked next to you in bay two.  Its front wheel is
 secured by a bicycle lock.

 You are standing in bay two.

>examine bicycle lock
 The lock has a long hasp that can be inserted through the spokes of a
 bicycle's wheel then locked to its frame to keep the wheel from
 turning.  The body of the lock has four numbered dials for entering
 the combination.  It's currently attached to the Schwinn's front wheel
 and locked.

>examine bay 3
 Aside from the varying patterns of oil stains on its floor, bay three
 look pretty much like the others.

>examine bay 4
 Aside from the varying patterns of oil stains on its floor, bay four
 look pretty much like the others.

 A large red tool cabinet sits under the canoe.

 A battered old canoe hangs on the wall in bay four.

>examine bay 5
 Aside from the varying patterns of oil stains on its floor, bay five
 look pretty much like the others.

>examine bay 6
 In the service bay are a Jaguar on a lift (currently down), and an air
 compressor for running pneumatic tools.

>examine lift
 The hydraulic lift is the same type found in service stations and auto
 repair facilities everywhere.  Its control panel is mounted to the
 east wall of the garage.  A Jaguar E-Type is parked on top of it.  It
 is currently down.

>examine panel
 (first getting out of bay two, then standing in the service bay)
 The lift control panel is mounted to the east wall of the garage.  It
 would normally have two buttons, one marked UP and one marked DOWN,
 however there's an empty hole where the UP one should be.  The panel's
 maintenance cover is currently held closed by a stripped-out sheet
 metal screw.  The panel has a red tag hanging from it.

>examine tag
 It's red and has the words, "OUT OF ORDER" printed on it.

>examine screw
 The screw appears to be a standard slotted sheet metal screw.  It's
 head has been stripped out.

>take it
 You'll have to unscrew it first.

>unscrew it
 You see no way to unscrew the screw.

>examine hole
 (the UP button hole)
 It's round, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and right
 where the UP button should be.

>inventory
 You are carrying a package, a business card, a paddle, and an inner
 tube patch.

>look in hole
 (the UP button hole)
 You bend over and peer into the hole.  There's just enough light
 coming in to let you make out the two electrical terminals the missing
 UP button should be wired to, but that's about it.

>look under jaguar
 You kneel and peer under the Jag.  The lift platform blocks your view
 of most of the area.  You'll have to raise it to see if there's
 actually anything under there.

>look in jaguar
 You peer through the windows of the Jag.  Its Connolly leather and
 Wilton wool clad interior is as immaculate as its exterior.

>examine ceiling
 You see nothing unusual about it.

>save
>cf2
 Saved.

>go west
 You can't go that way.  The only obvious exit leads out.

>out
 You step out of the service bay and into the main part of the garage.

>out
 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The hedge continues along the driveway to the garage.
 However, unlike the hedge in other parts of the estate, this one is
 rather badly overgrown.  The driveway leads back to the south.

 East Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

>examine trees
 Every tree here looks pretty much like every other tree here, namely,
 tall and green.  None are very close to the driveway or paths though.
 The groundskeeper must keep them cut back.

>go east
 Triton
 The main path ends here at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The main path leads back west.  A smaller footpath continues to the
 east.

>examine benches
 Eight benches are spaced evenly around the perimeter of the paved
 area.  They consist of a seat set on two concrete supports.

>look under benches
 You see nothing unusual under the concrete benches.

>examine statue
 The life-size bronze sculpture depicts the Greek sea-god Triton.  He
 is shown as a man from the waist up and has a dolphin's tail in place
 of his legs.  He is holding his signature trident in one hand and his
 conch shell horn in the other.  The beauty and level of detail of the
 sculpture is impressive.

>examine horn
 Maybe you'll have time to study the nuances of lawn sculpture later.
 Right now you have a package to deliver.

>look in horn
 There's nothing unusual in the lawn sculpture.

>examine plaque
 Unlike the other plaques in the area this particular plaque appears to
 be hinged, as though you might actually be able to pull it open.  It
 has something engraved on it.


 Triton

  His ship was the giant Triton,
  the sound of whose conch
  affrighted the dark-blue water.

 You remember reading somewhere that J. Daggett's great-grandfather
 made his fortune as a sea captain.  You can certainly understand why
 he might find the sea-god Triton meaningful.

>open it
 You slip your fingers under the right edge of the plaque and pull.
 There is some resistance, like you're pulling against a spring.  You
 hear a soft clicking noise coming from somewhere inside the
 sculpture's pedestal as the plaque moves, almost as though you were
 winding some kind of mechanism.  You continue to pull until the plaque
 will open no further, and are quite disappointed to discover that
 nothing but bare stone lies behind it.

 The clicking sound stops.  You wait a moment, but nothing unexpected
 happens.  As you stare at the plaque you can't help but wonder what
 kind of mechanism opening it wound, and what it might take to start it
 running.

>blow horn
 That isn't something you can inflate.

>examine plaque
 The brass plaque is currently standing open, but there is nothing but
 bare stone behind it.  It has something engraved on it.

>close plaque
 The plaque snaps closed against the sculpture's pedestal with a solid
 "clunk."  A moment later you hear the faint but unmistakable sound of
 metal grating against stone coming from somewhere to the west of you.
 As soon as it stops the mechanism inside the pedestal starts to tick.

>go west

 distance.  The way back to the mansion is east.

 Poseidon & Amphitrite
 The flagstone path ends at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The main flagstone path leads back east.  A rocky footpath leads north
 toward the cliffs overlooking the ocean.

 The plaque has inexplicably moved upwards about six inches to reveal a
 small recess in the stone behind it.  The recess contains a small
 silver key.

 Without warning the brass plaque begins to slide downward, grating
 loudly across the stone as it moves.  Within moments it has once again
 covered the small recess in the sculpture's stone pedestal.

>open plaque
 You try everything you can think of to somehow move or otherwise open
 the plaque, to no avail.  It stubbornly refuses to budge.

>read plaque

 Poseidon & Amphitrite

 O blessed one, be kindly in

 happens.  As you stare at the plaque you can't help but wonder what
 kind of mechanism opening it wound, and what it might take to start it
 running.

>close plaque
 The plaque snaps closed against the sculpture's pedestal with a solid
 "clunk."  A moment later you hear the faint but unmistakable sound of
 metal grating against stone coming from somewhere to the west of you.
 As soon as it stops the mechanism inside the pedestal starts to tick.

 A rapid ticking sound is coming from somewhere inside the sculpture's
 pedestal.

>open plaque
 You slip your fingers under the right edge of the plaque and pull.  It
 won't budge.  You pull harder, then again with all your strength.  The
 plaque remains stubbornly immovable.  Apparently it won't open while
 the mechanism inside the sculpture's pedestal is still running.

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "open plaque".

 Triton
 The main path ends here at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The main path leads back west.  A smaller footpath continues to the
 east.

 A rapid ticking sound is coming from somewhere inside the sculpture's
 pedestal.

>run west
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>go west
 East Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 You hear a faint, rapid ticking sound coming from the general area of
 the sculpture of Triton.

>go west
 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

>go west
 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 Poseidon & Amphitrite
 The flagstone path ends at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The main flagstone path leads back east.  A rocky footpath leads north
 toward the cliffs overlooking the ocean.

 The plaque has inexplicably moved upwards about six inches to reveal a
 small recess in the stone behind it.  The recess contains a small
 silver key.

 Without warning the brass plaque begins to slide downward, grating
 loudly across the stone as it moves.  Within moments it has once again
 covered the small recess in the sculpture's stone pedestal.

>examine benches
 Eight benches are spaced evenly around the perimeter of the paved
 area.  They consist of a seat set on two concrete supports.

>look under benches
 You see nothing unusual under the concrete benches.

>examine statue
 The life-size bronze sculpture depicts the Greek god Poseidon and his
 wife the goddess Amphitrite side by side in an ornately decorated
 chariot being drawn by two Hippocampi (the immortal winged
 chariot-horses of the gods).  Poseidon is wearing a laurel wreath
 while Amphitrite is wearing a tiara.  The beauty and level of detail
 of the sculpture is impressive.

 Maybe you'll have time to study the nuances of lawn sculpture later.
 Right now you have a package to deliver.

>go east
 You hike down the path.  The rolling green lawn quickly gives way to
 woods choked by dense undergrowth as it bends to the south.

 Small Clearing
 This small open area is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth.
 Over the years dry leaves and twigs have accumulated here and now
 cover much of the ground.  Paths lead west, southeast, and north.  The
 path to the north passes through the trees then bends west toward
 Triton.

>go west
 Grassy Area
 The trees are a bit thinner here, allowing dappled sunlight to reach
 the ground.  As a result there are numerous small clumps of grass
 scattered along this stretch of the footpath.  The footpath bends to
 the southwest behind you.  It continues to the east where it looks
 like it might widen out a bit.

 You notice a small green grasshopper munching on a clump of grass
 nearby.

 The grasshopper finds the clumps of grass fascinating.  You fail to
 see the allure.

 You lunge for the grasshopper, and miss.  He casually hops to another
 clump of grass and continues munching.

 You are carrying a package, a business card, a paddle, and an inner
 tube patch.

>open plaque
 You slip your fingers under the right edge of the plaque and pull.
 There is some resistance, like you're pulling against a spring.  You
 hear a soft clicking noise coming from somewhere inside the
 sculpture's pedestal as the plaque moves, almost as though you were
 winding some kind of mechanism.  You continue to pull until the plaque
 will open no further, and are quite disappointed to discover that
 nothing but bare stone lies behind it.

 The clicking sound stops.  You wait a moment, but nothing unexpected
 happens.  As you stare at the plaque you can't help but wonder what
 kind of mechanism opening it wound, and what it might take to start it
 running.

>put paddle in plaque
 You can't put anything in the polished brass plaque.

>put paddle on plaque
 There's no good surface on the polished brass plaque.

 The brass plaque is currently standing open, but there is nothing but
 bare stone behind it.  It has something engraved on it.

 You can't bring yourself to trample through the flowers when there are
 perfectly good paths available.  Obvious exits lead east, back to the

 crowd against both sides of the path as it meanders across the rolling

 By the Garden Shed
 A dilapidated old garden shed squats forlornly next to the wall in the
 far southeast corner of the property.  The only thing even remotely
 new about it is the shiny chrome-plated padlock on its door.  The path
 back to the small clearing lies to the northwest.

>examine padlock
 The chrome-plated padlock is made from heavy tempered steel and looks
 capable of withstanding even the most determined assault.  Stamped on
 its bottom are the words, "Certified Pick-proof* (*certification void
 outside Slovenia)" It's locked.

>examine door
 The shed door is just as badly weathered as the rest of the shed.
 Even so it still looks sturdy enough to withstand any type of
 brute-force attempt to batter it down.  It's closed.

 Dilapidated is right.  It's been years since a fresh coat of paint
 last covered the shed's badly weathered flanks.

 Under the Oak Tree
 The forest thins slightly here, no doubt due to the huge old oak that
 is blocking most of the sunlight.  The footpath continues from west to
 east along the wall for a bit before bending northeast to go around
 the tree's massive trunk.

 You hear birds twittering in the branches above you.

 able to somehow SAVE yourself should you slip and fall.  (Climb again
 to continue.)

 You hear birds twittering in the branches above you.

>save
>cf3
 Saved.

>go up
 It's been a long time since you last did much tree climbing, but
 you're willing to give it a try.  You grab one of the lower branches
 and pull yourself up.

 Low in the Oak Tree
 You pause to catch your breath at a point that is about ten feet above
 the ground.  The branch under your feet is thick and sturdy, and the
 trunk beside you is reassuringly massive.

>examine branch
 The sturdy branches here would make a great place to build a tree
 house.  It makes you wish you were a kid again.  Additional sturdy
 branches are within easy reach just above your head.

>go up
 Midway Up the Oak Tree
 The branches aren't quite so thick and sturdy here.  You can feel them
 swaying slightly under you with the wind.  Every once in awhile the
 leaves part enough for you to catch a glimpse of the ground some
 twenty-five feet below.

 There is a three-inch wide hole in the trunk here.  It contains a huge
 pile of acorns.

 A squirrel holding a large acorn darts out of the foliage to chitter
 at you angrily for invading his domain, then just as abruptly
 disappears back into the leaves.

>examine acorns
 The pile is huge.  It contains thousands of acorns in every shape and
 size imaginable.

 The squirrel isn't here at the moment.  He probably left to find a
 hiding place for his acorn.

>search acorns
 You peer into the hole, but all you can see are acorns.  Lots and lots
 of acorns.

 The squirrel has worked hard for many long months gathering and
 storing his supply of acorns.  It wouldn't be right to rob him of the
 fruits of his labor.  He probably wouldn't miss just one acorn,
 though.

 The hole is a tight fit, but you manage to squeeze your hand through
 and grab an acorn from the pile.

 Just as you do the squirrel returns, this time taking up sentry duty
 on a nearby branch.  Apparently concerned by your discovery of his
 hidey-hole, he watches warily as you paw around among his stash of
 acorns.

>take acorn
 Which acorn do you mean, the pile's acorn, or the squirrel's acorn?

>pile's
 You're already holding one of the acorns from the pile.

 You can't see much with your hand stuck in the opening.

>examine squirrel
 Squirrels are noted for their fondness for acorns, and this one is no
 exception.  He is holding a nice large one.  The presence of your hand
 in his hole has apparently overcome his normal shyness.  He watches
 you warily from a nearby branch.

 You seem to have a bit of a problem here.

 This situation reminds you of something you once saw on "The Discovery
 Channel."  It was one of those endless nature specials, this one about
 native tribesmen who trap monkeys by drilling a small hole in a
 coconut and putting a lump of food inside.  The monkey reaches in,
 grabs the food, then panics when he can't get his hand back out.  He's
 too dumb to realize that all he has to do to escape is drop the food,
 and as a result he ends up in the stew pot.

>drop acorn
 Congratulations!  You have just proved that you're smarter than the
 average monkey.  Of course you still don't have an acorn.  Maybe what
 you need to be is smarter than the average squirrel.

 Satisfied that his acorns are safe, the squirrel abandons his sentry
 post and disappears back into the leaves.

 You are carrying a package, a business card, an inner tube patch, and

 You hear birds twittering in the branches above you.

>go up
 High in the Oak Tree
 The dangerously thin branches creak and groan under your weight as you
 cling precariously to your shaky perch.  Your climb has taken you
 nearly forty feet into the air.  Looking out and down, all you can see
 are the tops of the other trees below you.  Glancing up, you see that
 you have climbed to within ten feet of the top.

 As you continue to admire the view you slowly become aware of the fact
 that you're being watched.  You peer around cautiously, then spot a
 large female robin perched on a branch to your left.  She appears to
 be standing guard over the nest she has built there.

>examine nest
 The robin has done a very neat job of building her nest in the fork of
 a limb.  The usual twigs, straw, tufts of hair, and bits of twine have
 been woven with care into a sturdy home.  Peering into its
 feather-lined interior you can see that she has laid four pale blue
 eggs.  You also notice that one of the tufts of hair she used still
 has a bobby pin attached to it.

 You hear birds twittering in the branches below you.

>take twine
 The word "twine" is not necessary in this story.

>take nest
 Naturally the robin assumes that your approaching hand is after her
 eggs.  As soon as you start to reach for her nest she explodes into
 the air, and with a trilling battle cry springs to the attack.

 Her wings beat angrily in your face while a flurry of painful pecks
 rain down on the top of your head.  You swat at her wildly in an
 effort to drive her back, but she's in her element and has no problem
 avoiding your clumsy flailing.  You, on the other hand, are clearly
 out of your element.  The fury of the robin's attack so startles you
 that you momentarily forget one of the basic tenets of tree climbing,
 namely, ALWAYS hold onto the tree.

 AAAIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEE...............

 In the process of falling you manage to break most of the major bones
 in your body by crashing into the same sturdy branches you climbed
 earlier.  Your thick skull miraculously survives, at least until you
 tumble out of the tree and smack head first onto the path below.
 Twisted and bleeding, you lie under the huge old oak tree and calmly
 watch the world fade to black around you.

 You scrutinize her closely to determine if she is an American or
 European Robin, and conclude that she is indeed an American Robin.
 Her general thrush-like appearance, characteristic red breast
 (slightly paler in the female), and the little American flag tattooed
 on her left bicep are dead giveaways.

 (Just kidding about that tattoo.)

 The bobby pin is badly rusted.  It must have been lying outside in the
 rain and snow for a long time before the robin found it.

 Something about the way the robin is watching your every move makes
 you think that right now might not be a good time to be reaching
 toward her nest.

 You hear birds twittering in the branches below you.

 Throwing caution to the wind, you push ever higher up the huge old

 you were holding onto the limb above it.  As you hang there looking
 for another branch to transfer your weight to it occurs to you that
 now might be a good time to give up and head back down.  That's when
 you hear it.

 You hear birds twittering in the branches above you.

 You can't put anything in the oak tree.

>go west
 East Footpath
 The south end of the property is heavily wooded.  A single winding
 footpath starts at the gap in the hedge to the west and runs east
 through the dense foliage near the wall.

>go west
 After a bit of squirming you manage to squeeze through the narrow gap
 between the hedge and the wall.  You make a mental note to reconsider
 your decision not to go on a diet.

 Front Gate
 The gravel driveway widens a bit as it passes through a gate in the
 high stone wall that surrounds the estate.  On the other side of the
 gate the road quickly bends and disappears from sight behind the
 trees.  The neatly trimmed hedge on the west side of the driveway runs
 in a solid, unbroken line right up to the wall.  But, oddly enough,
 there's a narrow gap between the hedge and the wall on the east side.

 You see a piece of paper here.

>take paper
 Just as you reach for the piece of paper a sudden gust of wind swirls
 it up and deposits it on the other side of the gate.

>read gate
 That isn't something you can read.

>read paper
 It's too far away for you to make out any detail, but it appears to be
 some kind of sales brochure.

 You can't reach the sales brochure with a paddle.

>examine gate
 The gate is an imposing affair made of wrought iron pikes interwoven
 with decorative ironwork vines.  It was standing wide open when you
 arrived, but someone has apparently closed and locked it since then.

>open gate
 The wrought iron gate seems to be locked.

>climb gate
 The tips of the pikes are VERY sharp.  You wisely change your mind
 about climbing the gate.

>go west
 The thick (but neatly trimmed) hedge blocks your way.  Obvious exits
 lead north; south; and east, back to the east footpath.

>go south
 That's strange.  The gate was standing wide open when you passed
 through it earlier, but someone has apparently closed and locked it
 since then.

>go north
 By the Pond
 The driveway runs generally north to south, with occasional deviations
 to pass by a large tree or, as is the case here, around a decorative
 cement pond.  A fountain sprays and splashes cheerfully in the center
 of the pond.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along both
 sides of the driveway.

>examine fountain
 The fountain sprays and splashes cheerfully in the center of the pond.

>examine pond
 It looks like one of those decorative cement ponds that landscapers
 are so fond of.  This one is fairly large, say, maybe thirty feet
 across, but doesn't look to be more than knee deep.  A fountain sprays
 and splashes cheerfully in its center.

>look in pond
 You walk around the edge of the pond peering into the water.  You
 don't notice anything lying on the bottom within reach.

>enter pond
 Throwing caution to the wind, you step over the edge of the pond and
 plunge into the water.

 In the Cement Pond
 The water is surprisingly cold, but thankfully only about knee deep.
 The footing is a bit slippery, but as long as you're careful you
 should be able to move around easily enough.  The glint from something
 shiny lying on the bottom of the pond briefly catches your eye.

>take shiny
 According to my handy pocket dictionary, a glint is "a tiny bright
 flash of light."  Now you can splash about the pond chasing phantom
 lights all day long if you want to, but what you might want to do
 instead is search the pond for whatever it is that's making the glint.

 You slosh around the pond looking for anything visible lying on its
 bottom, and discover a shiny penny.

>take penny
 Taken.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>examine it
 It's a shiny Lincoln cent, just like the ones that keep cluttering up
 your pockets.  You do notice that it has the original wreath design on
 the reverse.  You don't see many of those any more.

>search pond
 You slosh around the pond looking for anything visible lying on its
 bottom, but come up empty handed.

>out
 You climb up out of the pond to stand dripping on the gravel driveway.

 By the Pond
 The driveway runs generally north to south, with occasional deviations
 to pass by a large tree or, as is the case here, around a decorative
 cement pond.  A fountain sprays and splashes cheerfully in the center
 of the pond.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along both
 sides of the driveway.

>examine me
 You look just like somebody who needs to deliver a package.

>examine wreath
 You look at the penny more closely.  It's dated 1909 and has an "S"
 mint mark.  You also notice the initials "VDB" at the bottom of the
 reverse.  The penny is a lot older than it looks, and in mint
 condition.  You find yourself wondering if it might be worth something
 to a collector.

 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The hedge continues along the driveway to the garage.
 However, unlike the hedge in other parts of the estate, this one is
 rather badly overgrown.  The driveway leads back to the south.

 Garage
 The garage interior is divided into five open parking bays and a
 service bay equipped with a hydraulic lift and an air compressor.  A
 classic Jaguar E-Type convertible sits on the lift.  The lift is
 currently down.

 A battered old canoe hangs on the wall in bay four.

 A large red tool cabinet sits under the canoe.

 A bicycle is parked in bay two.  Its front wheel is secured by a
 bicycle lock.

>enter bay 6
 You step into the service bay.

>put penny in hole
 (the UP button hole)
 The terminals are recessed too far inside the control panel for you to
 be able to touch them with the the shiny penny.

>unscrew screw with penny
 The head of the screw is stripped out.  You can't remove it.

>break screw
 Breaking that would serve no purpose.

>pull screw
 You'll have to unscrew it first.

>open panel
 You'll have to remove the screw holding it closed first.  And since
 its head is stripped out, that's not really an option.

 East Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 Triton
 The main path ends here at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The brass plaque in Triton's pedestal is currently standing open.

 The main path leads back west.  A smaller footpath continues to the
 east.  The path to the east passes through rolling green lawn then
 bends south toward the small clearing.

>examine pedestal
 The stone pedestal is circular and rises about two feet above the
 flagstone pavement.  It supports a life-sized bronze sculpture of
 Triton, and has a polished brass plaque attached to the front of it.
 The brass plaque is currently standing open.

 Triton

  His ship was the giant Triton,
  the sound of whose conch
  affrighted the dark-blue water.

 You remember reading somewhere that J. Daggett's great-grandfather
 made his fortune as a sea captain.  You can certainly understand why
 he might find the sea-god Triton meaningful.

>examine triton
 The life-size bronze sculpture depicts the Greek sea-god Triton.  He
 is shown as a man from the waist up and has a dolphin's tail in place
 of his legs.  He is holding his signature trident in one hand and his
 conch shell horn in the other.  The beauty and level of detail of the
 sculpture is impressive.

 The brass plaque in Triton's pedestal is currently standing open.

>put coin in plaque
 You can't put anything in the polished brass plaque.

 Maybe you'll have time to study the nuances of lawn sculpture later.
 Right now you have a package to deliver.

 The brass plaque is currently standing open, but there is nothing but
 bare stone behind it.  It has something engraved on it.

 Poseidon & Amphitrite
 The flagstone path ends at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The main flagstone path leads back east.  A rocky footpath leads north
 toward the cliffs overlooking the ocean.

>go north
 You soon realize you're in for a bit of a hike.  The path passes to
 the east of a large greenhouse, then bends northeast toward the cliffs
 overlooking the ocean.  The ground turns rocky and starts sloping
 downward.  Before long you're winding down stairs cut into the face of
 the cliff.

 Crescent Beach Overlook
 The steps end at wide ledge overlooking the ocean.  The stairway that
 once continued on down the cliff face to the narrow crescent-shaped
 beach some fifty feet below you has collapsed into a twisted pile of
 corroded metal.  The beach itself is littered with broken shells and
 hemmed in on both ends by a jumble of fallen rock.  A rusty iron
 railing surrounds the overlook and protects you from falling.

 The way back starts with a long climb back up the steps.

>spit in ocean
 The word "spit" is not necessary in this story.

>examine railing
 The railing is bolted directly to the rock, and at one time was no
 doubt very safe and sturdy.  However long exposure to the salt air has
 left it badly rusted.  An experimental shake causes one of the
 remaining bolts to crack and fall to the beach below. You cautiously
 take a step back from the edge.

>take railing
 Given the railing's current condition it might actually be possible to
 rip it right out of the rock.  However you see no reason to do so.

>examine stairway
 All that's left of the stairway that once descended from the overlook
 to the beach is a twisted pile of corroded metal on the sand below.

>examine beach
 The beach is about fifty feet directly below you.  It's a narrow
 crescent littered with broken shells and hemmed in on both ends by a
 jumble of fallen rock.  You can see a couple of large boulders
 surrounded by thick brush standing against the face of the cliff.

 The cliffs aren't important.

 The hike back isn't any shorter, and it's all uphill.  You're huffing
 and puffing a bit by the time you make it back to Poseidon &
 Amphitrite.

 Poseidon & Amphitrite
 The flagstone path ends at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative

 The main path leads north toward what appears to be greenhouse in the
 distance.  The way back to the mansion is east.

 Greenhouse Entrance
 The path ends at the entrance to a large greenhouse.  Its
 glass-paneled walls are fogged with moisture.  Peering inside you can
 just make out what looks like long rows of plants, as well as the
 shadowy shape of a figure moving about among them.  There is a single
 door, also glass, directly in front of you.  It's closed.

 The flagstone path leads back south across the lawn.

>examine figure
 You can see a shadowy figure moving around among the rows of plants
 inside the greenhouse.

 You step up and knock on the greenhouse door.  You see the shadowy
 figure look your way, then walk over to a table and pick something up.
 The door swings open.

 The figure turns out to be the estate's gardener.  He is clad in
 coveralls and stooped with age.  He is carrying a pair of hedge
 clippers.  He peers up at you through thick, fogged glasses.

 "That you Earl?  'Bout time you got back.  That hedge by the garage
 needs clippin', and uh, wait a sec..."  He studies you intently
 through the Coke bottle bottoms he uses for lenses for a moment, then
 says, "Saaay, you ain't Earl."

 You decide to try the direct approach.  "No, actually I have a very
 important package I need to deliver to Mr. Winton, but I'm having a
 hard time getting in to see him.  I wonder if you could..."

 The old gardener cuts you off with a snort.  "Nope!  Try the main
 entrance."

 Once again you find yourself standing before a closed door.  So much
 for the direct approach.

>knock on door
 You start to knock on the door again and realize that you don't have a
 plan of action, even if he does answer.  He can't see that well.  He
 might talk to you if you could somehow make him think you were Earl.

 The gardener stoops and appears to examine some plants.

>look in greenhouse
 You press your face against the glass and try to peer through the fog.
 You see the shadowy figure of the gardener moving around among the
 rows of plants inside the greenhouse.

 The gardener shuffles over to one side of the greenhouse and picks
 through some objects on a table.

>go east
 You hike down the path.  The rolling green lawn quickly gives way to
 woods choked by dense undergrowth as it bends to the south.

 Small Clearing
 This small open area is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth.
 Over the years dry leaves and twigs have accumulated here and now
 cover much of the ground.  Paths lead west, southeast, and north.  The
 path to the north passes through the trees then bends west toward
 Triton.

>go west
 Grassy Area
 The trees are a bit thinner here, allowing dappled sunlight to reach
 the ground.  As a result there are numerous small clumps of grass
 scattered along this stretch of the footpath.  The footpath bends to
 the southwest behind you.  It continues to the east where it looks
 like it might widen out a bit.

 You notice a small green grasshopper munching on a clump of grass
 nearby.

>take hopper
 You lunge for the grasshopper, and miss again.  This time he takes
 flight just long enough to reach a clump of grass on the other side of
 the clearing.

 and ends up behind you.

 Just as you're about to spring the grasshopper decides the grass is
 greener over... there, and leaps to a new clump.

 You lunge for the grasshopper one last time, and much to your (and
 even more to the grasshopper's) surprise you actually manage to trap
 him under your cupped palm.  I guess your previous clumsy efforts must

 Under the Oak Tree
 The forest thins slightly here, no doubt due to the huge old oak that

 the tree's massive trunk.

>drop paddle
 Dropped.

>go up
 It's been a long time since you last did much tree climbing, but
 you're willing to give it a try.  You grab one of the lower branches
 and pull yourself up.

 Low in the Oak Tree
 You pause to catch your breath at a point that is about ten feet above
 the ground.  The branch under your feet is thick and sturdy, and the
 trunk beside you is reassuringly massive.

>go up
 Midway Up the Oak Tree
 The branches aren't quite so thick and sturdy here.  You can feel them
 swaying slightly under you with the wind.  Every once in awhile the
 leaves part enough for you to catch a glimpse of the ground some
 twenty-five feet below.

 There is a three-inch wide hole in the trunk here.  It contains a huge
 pile of acorns.

>go up
 High in the Oak Tree
 The dangerously thin branches creak and groan under your weight as you
 cling precariously to your shaky perch.  Your climb has taken you
 nearly forty feet into the air.  Looking out and down, all you can see
 are the tops of the other trees below you.  Glancing up, you see that
 you have climbed to within ten feet of the top.

 A large female robin is perched on a branch to your left.  She appears
 to be standing guard over the nest she has built there.  The nest
 contains four pale blue eggs and a bobby pin.

 You hear birds twittering in the branches below you.

>give grasshopper to robin
 It just so happens that small green grasshoppers are this particular
 robin's absolute favorite afternoon snack.  Her normal caution
 overcome by hunger, she bursts forth in a flurry of beating wings and
 dives for the grasshopper.  Before you can even twitch in response
 she's snapped it from your fingertips and zoomed back out of reach.
 By the time she has regained her perch all traces of the poor little
 guy are gone.  She continues to watch you warily.

 So much for your show of good will.

 bobbing her head in excitement.  You can almost feel the poor little
 guy cringe in your fingers.

 Something about the way the robin is watching your every move makes
 you think that right now might not be a good time to be reaching
 toward her nest.

>drop hopper
 You hold the hand containing the grasshopper out in front of you and
 slowly open it.  The grasshopper cautiously pokes its head up and
 takes a look around.  Spotting the robin, it immediately springs in
 terror for the nearest clump of leaves.  The robin explodes into the
 air and dives in after it.  You hear rustling sounds and occasional
 excited chirps coming from various points in the branches around you.

 The chase is on.

 The forest thins slightly here, no doubt due to the huge old oak that
 is blocking most of the sunlight.  The footpath continues from west to
 east along the wall for a bit before bending northeast to go around
 the tree's massive trunk.

 You see a paddle here.

 You hear birds twittering in the branches above you.

>take paddle
 Taken.

 You hear birds twittering in the branches above you.

>go northeast
 Grassy Area
 The trees are a bit thinner here, allowing dappled sunlight to reach
 the ground.  As a result there are numerous small clumps of grass
 scattered along this stretch of the footpath.  The footpath bends to
 the southwest behind you.  It continues to the east where it looks
 like it might widen out a bit.

>go east
 Small Clearing
 This small open area is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth.
 Over the years dry leaves and twigs have accumulated here and now
 cover much of the ground.  Paths lead west, southeast, and north.  The
 path to the north passes through the trees then bends west toward
 Triton.

 By the Garden Shed
 A dilapidated old garden shed squats forlornly next to the wall in the
 far southeast corner of the property.  The only thing even remotely
 new about it is the shiny chrome-plated padlock on its door.  The path
 back to the small clearing lies to the northwest.

>pick lock with pin
 It always works in the movies, but you don't hold out much hope as you
 carefully straighten the rusty bobby pin and insert in the keyhole.
 You poke and prod a bit, then twist the pin.  Much to your surprise
 you hear a tiny grinding sound and the lock cylinder moves slightly.
 You twist harder and it moves some more, but you can also feel the
 bobby pin starting to bend and crumble in your fingers.  You decide to
 give it one final hard twist.  Just as the cylinder starts to turn the
 bobby pin snaps off flush with the keyhole and what's left of it
 disintegrates into a pile of gritty rust in your hand.

 The lock stays shut.

 Note: There will now be a short pause to allow you to fully express
 your opinion of bobby pins, padlocks, adventure games, adventure game
 authors, and life in general.

 Press the space bar when you're done...

 Wow!  Where did you learn all those six-syllable expletives?  I'm
 impressed.

 Anyway, with that out of your system you decide to give the offending
 padlock one last yank before you stomp off in disgust, and darned if
 the stupid thing doesn't fall open in your hand.  (Now aren't you
 sorry you said all those terrible things about adventure game
 authors.)

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>inventory
 You are carrying a package, a business card, an inner tube patch, a
 forked stick, a shiny penny, and a paddle.

>take lock
 The remaining piece of the bobby pin has hopelessly jammed the
 padlock's locking mechanism, rendering it useless.  Since it obviously
 has been picked you briefly consider trying to return it to the
 manufacturer for replacement, but decide to skip the trip to Slovenia
 for now and leave it where it is.

>open door
 You unhook the lock, flip back the hasp, re-hang the lock, and give
 the door a tug.  It creaks open on rusty hinges.

>in
 In the Garden Shed
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shadowy dimness
 inside the shed.  The first thing you notice is a long wooden
 workbench against the left wall.  The top of the bench is littered
 with broken tools, old car parts, and assorted unidentifiable junk.
 The only thing you recognize is the electric grinder bolted to the
 bench's far end.  A crooked row of rusty nails march along the right
 wall, probably driven there long ago to hang tools on.  Stacked
 against the back wall is what looks to be a pile of salesman's sample
 cases.  The whole place has a musty, abandoned air about it.

 There's a single-bulb light fixture mounted over the workbench.  The
 light bulb is unlit.

 Hanging on the nails are a gimme cap and a chambray work shirt.

>examine cap
 The cap looks like your typical gimme cap, the kind businesses like to
 emblazon with their company logos then sell to rubes who actually WANT
 to look like walking billboards.  This one is a bit worn and has a few
 grease stains on it, but looks to be perfectly serviceable.

>examine shirt
 The shirt is a typical blue chambray work shirt.  It has short
 sleeves, is passably clean, and has the name Earl embroidered over the
 spot where the now-missing pocket used to be.

>take cap, shirt
 gimme cap: Taken.
 chambray work shirt: Taken.

>examine cases
 Yep, that's what they are all right.  Salesman's sample cases.  A
 whole pile of 'em in every shape and size imaginable.  You've never
 seen so much genuine Naugahyde all in one place in your life.  Kind'a
 makes you wonder just how many salesmen over the years failed to read
 the plaque next to the mansion's main entrance.

>take cases
 You rummage around in the pile and pick a sample case at random.
 Opening it reveals a wonderful collection of plastic shower curtain
 hooks (available in nine decorator colors). After a brief examination

 Broken tools, old car parts, and assorted unidentifiable junk litter
 the top of the bench.  Nothing useful is readily apparent in the pile,
 but who knows what a more thorough examination might turn up.

>search junk
 You dig through the pile of junk on the table, and much to your
 surprise discover some leather work gloves, a screwdriver, and an
 inner tube.

>take gloves
 Taken.

>take screwdriver

>take tube

>examine screwdriver
 The screwdriver has the usual bladed tip and a yellow plastic handle
 grooved for easy gripping.

>examine tube
 A typical old black rubber inner tube.  It's too big to be for a car
 tire.  It must have come from a truck or tractor or something.  The
 rubber still looks serviceable, but upon closer inspection you
 discover a quarter-inch long gash near the valve stem. The gash
 explains why it was abandoned among the other junk on the bench.

>put patch on tube
 You carefully peel the backing from the patch, position it over the
 gash, and press it home.  Hopefully it will hold once the tube is
 inflated.

>search junk
 You dig through the pile of junk on the table, but find nothing of
 interest.

>examine grinder
 The electric grinder's motor, grinding wheel, power cord, and on-off
 switch are all in place and intact.  It is not plugged into anything
 at the moment.

>examine bulb
 The light bulb is ordinary in every way.  It is unlit.

>turn on bulb
 There's a click as you pull the chain, but the light bulb remains
 dark.  It could be burned out, or the circuit could be dead.  It might
 not hurt to see where the wires lead.

>turn off bulb
 The light bulb is already as off as it's ever going to get.

>examine wires
 The electrical cable runs from the light fixture to a location behind
 the workbench.

>fixture
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>examine fixture
 A single-bulb light fixture is mounted over the workbench.  An
 electrical cable leads from the fixture to a location behind the
 workbench.  The fixture has a pull chain attached to it for turning it
 on and off.  The light bulb is unlit.

>look behind workbench
 You bend down and peer under the workbench.  There's an power outlet
 conveniently attached to the wall under there.  The cable from the
 light fixture feeds into it from above, and conduit runs from it to a
 location concealed by the open door.

>examine conduit
 The conduit runs from the power outlet under the bench to a location

 You swing the door closed.  The gloom inside the shed deepens to

>go northwest
 Small Clearing
 This small open area is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth.
 Over the years dry leaves and twigs have accumulated here and now
 cover much of the ground.  Paths lead west, southeast, and north.  The
 path to the north passes through the trees then bends west toward
 Triton.

>go north
 The trees thin quickly, giving way to rolling green lawn as the path
 bends to the west.

 Triton
 The main path ends here at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The brass plaque in Triton's pedestal is currently standing open.

 The main path leads back west.  A smaller footpath continues to the
 east.  The path to the east passes through rolling green lawn then
 bends south toward the small clearing.

>go west
 East Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

>go west
 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

>go west
 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 The main path leads north toward what appears to be greenhouse in the
 distance.  The way back to the mansion is east.

>go north
 Greenhouse Entrance
 The path ends at the entrance to a large greenhouse.  Its
 glass-paneled walls are fogged with moisture.  Peering inside you can
 just make out what looks like long rows of plants, as well as the
 shadowy shape of a figure moving about among them.  There is a single
 door, also glass, directly in front of you.  It's closed.

 The flagstone path leads back south across the lawn.

>knock on door
 You start to knock on the door again, but hesitate.  The chambray work
 shirt and leather work gloves still might not be enough to fool the
 old gardener into thinking you're Earl.  You decide to try to find one
 more piece of his apparel to wear, just to be sure.

>wear cap
 Okay, you're now wearing the gimme cap.

>knock on door
 You start to knock on the door, but hesitate.  The old gardener might
 be a bit surprised to see Earl the groundskeeper lugging around a
 paddle, and you don't want him looking at you too closely.

 The gardener walks to a different group of plants and starts digging
 with a hand trowel.

>drop paddle
 Dropped.

 The gardener picks up a water can and sprinkles some seedlings.

>knock on door
 You step up and knock on the greenhouse door.  You see the old
 gardener again look your way, hesitate, scratch his head, sigh, then
 finally walk over to a table and pick something up.  The door swings
 open.  He peers up at you through thick, fogged glasses.  You stare
 intently at your shoes, letting the bill of the gimme cap hide your
 face.

 Grumbling, he says, "'Bout time you got back, Earl.  That hedge by the
 garage needs clippin' real bad.  Here, take these."

 "OK," you mumble as you take a pair of hedge clippers from his hands.
 You turn quickly to make your getaway.

 "And come right back when you're done," he calls after you.  "I got
 some more stuff that needs doin'."

 You wave in acknowledgement without looking back.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>examine clippers
 The hedge clippers are well-worn and dulled with age.  Spots of rust
 adorn the blades.  They move easily when you open and close them, but
 given their current state it's unlikely that you'll be able to cut
 anything with them.

>open box
 Opened.

>look in box
 The fuse box contains a single fuse socket.  The socket contains a
 blown fuse.

 You unscrew and take the blown fuse.

>put penny in socket
 You try not to think about the phrase "electrical fire" as you
 cautiously poke the penny into the back of the socket.

>close box
 Closed.

>turn on lever
 You move the lever up into the ON position.  You hear the metallic
 'clink' of the penny falling out of the socket and hitting the bottom
 of the fuse box.  The vibration from the lever being moved must have
 jarred it loose.

>turn off lever
 You move the lever down into the OFF position.  The light bulb remains
 off.  The grinder remains off.

>inventory
 You are carrying a package, a business card, a forked stick, a
 screwdriver, an inner tube, some dull hedge clippers, a paddle, a gold
 lighter (providing light), a screw, and a blown fuse.  You're wearing
 a gimme cap, a chambray work shirt, and some leather work gloves.

>examine tube
 A typical old black rubber inner tube.  It's too big to be for a car
 tire.  It must have come from a truck or tractor or something.  The
 patch you applied appears to be firmly stuck into place.  Hopefully it
 will hold air when you try to inflate it.

>remove patch
 (from the inner tube)
 You can't have that; it's part of the inner tube.

>open box
 Opening the fuse box reveals a shiny penny.  As soon as you get the
 fuse box cover fully open the penny falls out and rolls off across the
 floor.

>take penny
 Taken.

>put penny in socket
 You try not to think about the phrase "electrical fire" as you
 cautiously poke the penny into the back of the socket.

>put fuse in socket
 You screw the blown fuse down on top of the penny.

 You move the lever up into the ON position.  The light bulb begins to
 glow dimly.  The grinder remains off.

>close lighter
 You snap the lighter closed to extinguish the flame.

>turn on grinder
 You turn on the grinder's power switch.  It's power restored, the
 grinder spins to life.

 You hear a low, steady whirring sound coming from the grinder.

 You open the clippers and begin to move the edges of the two blades
 back and forth against the spinning grinder wheel.  Sparks fly as you
 carefully hone them back to razor sharpness.

 You hear a low, steady whirring sound coming from the grinder.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>grind clippers

 The hedge clippers are already as sharp as they're going to get.

>turn off grinder
 You turn off the grinder's power switch.  It's power cut, the grinder
 spins down and stops.

>turn off bulb
 The gloom inside the shed deepens to near-total darkness.  There's a
 click as you pull the chain, and the light bulb goes out.

>out
 (first opening the shed door)
 You swing the door open.  The inside of the shed returns to its normal
 level of gloominess.

 By the Garden Shed
 A dilapidated old garden shed squats forlornly next to the wall in the
 far southeast corner of the property.  The only thing even remotely
 new about it is the shiny chrome-plated padlock on its door.  The path
 back to the small clearing lies to the northwest.

>in
 In the Garden Shed
 You see a long wooden workbench against the left wall.  The top of the
 bench is littered with broken tools, old car parts, and assorted
 unidentifiable junk.  The only thing you recognize is the electric
 grinder bolted to the bench's far end.  A crooked row of rusty nails
 march along the right wall, probably driven there long ago to hang
 tools on.  Stacked against the back wall is what looks to be a pile of
 salesman's sample cases.  The whole place has a musty, abandoned air
 about it.

 There's a single-bulb light fixture mounted over the workbench.  The
 light bulb is unlit.

>close door
 You swing the door closed.  The gloom inside the shed deepens to
 near-total darkness.

>open lighter
 You snap the lighter open and flick the striking wheel.  The flint
 sparks and the wick instantly bursts into flame.

 The penny tumbles out into your palm.  It appears to have accumulated
 a few nicks and scratches from having the fuse screwed down on top of
 it.

>examine penny
 It's a shiny Lincoln cent, just like the ones that keep cluttering up
 your pockets.  You do notice that it has the original wreath design on
 the reverse.  You don't see many of those any more.

 You see no reason to travel around with a lit lighter in your hand.
 You snap the lighter closed to extinguish the flame.

>go northwest
 Small Clearing
 This small open area is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth.
 Over the years dry leaves and twigs have accumulated here and now
 cover much of the ground.  Paths lead west, southeast, and north.  The
 path to the north passes through the trees then bends west toward
 Triton.

>go north
 The trees thin quickly, giving way to rolling green lawn as the path
 bends to the west.

 Triton
 The main path ends here at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The brass plaque in Triton's pedestal is currently standing open.

 The main path leads back west.  A smaller footpath continues to the
 east.  The path to the east passes through rolling green lawn then
 bends south toward the small clearing.

>go west
 East Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

>go west
 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

>go north
 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The hedge continues along the driveway to the garage.
 However, unlike the hedge in other parts of the estate, this one is
 rather badly overgrown.  The driveway leads back to the south.

>trim hedges
 (with the sharp hedge clippers)
 You set about the task of trimming the thick hedge with vigor.  The
 freshly sharpened clippers chew through the foliage with little
 resistance, and before long you have the hedge shaping up nicely.  As
 you work on its east side you also uncover the entrance to a bare
 footpath leading east.  A bit of extra clipping makes it passable once
 again.

>go east
 You pass through the opening you cleared while trimming the hedge and
 turn northeast toward the cliffs.

 Top of the Cliff
 You can see why J. Daggett's great-grandfather chose this site for his
 estate.  The view from the top of the cliff is breathtaking.  The bay
 stretches out before you.  A wide expanse of sandy beach lies below.
 The day is sunny and relatively calm, with only a slight onshore
 breeze.  A gentle swell rolls onto the sand.

 A wide, sandy path leads down to the beach.  The bare footpath leads
 back toward the garage to the southwest.

>examine sand
 The beach is about two hundred feet directly below you.  It's wide and
 sandy, and looks like it would be a great place to spend a sunny
 afternoon with the family.  It follows the curve of the bay to the
 east and eventually bends south and disappears behind the cliffs.  To
 the west it ends at a jumble of fallen rock.

>go down
 Sandy Beach
 The beach is wide and sandy.  It follows the curve of the bay to the
 east and eventually bends south and disappears behind the cliffs.  To
 the west it ends at a jumble of fallen rock.

>examine rock
 Part of the cliff has collapsed, blocking the west end of the beach.
 The rocks extend well out into the bay.  Waves break over their jagged
 edges.

>examine sand
 The wide, sandy beach follows the curve of the bay to the east and
 eventually disappears behind the cliffs as it turns south.  To the
 west it ends at a jumble of fallen rock.

>climb rock
 You explore the fallen rocks to see if you can find a way over or
 through them.  You quickly give up.  They're steep, jagged,
 dangerously slippery, and extend well out into the bay.

>dig sand
 Maybe you'll have time to dig for buried pirate treasure later.  Right
 now you have a package to deliver.

>go east
 You shade your eyes and study the long curve of the beach to the east.
 Other than a few nude sunbathers you see nothing of interest, and
 decide to skip the hike.

 (Just kidding about the nude sunbathers.)

>examine ocean
 A gentle onshore breeze brings a light swell rolling onto the beach.
 The color of the water changes from green to dark blue as it deepens
 offshore.

>swim

 A nice swim would certainly be refreshing, however you can't put the
 package down and you dare not get it wet.

 You'll need to find an air hose first.

>go south
 You leave the cliffs behind and head back toward the garage.  A brisk
 hike soon brings you to the opening you cleared while trimming the
 hedge.

 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side
 of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the
 hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking
 the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south.

 Freshly cut hedge clippings are strewn about the area.

 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting

 The main path leads north toward what appears to be greenhouse in the
 distance.  The way back to the mansion is east.

>go north
 Greenhouse Entrance
 The path ends at the entrance to a large greenhouse.  Its
 glass-paneled walls are fogged with moisture.  Peering inside you can
 just make out what looks like long rows of plants, as well as the
 shadowy shape of a figure moving about among them.  There is a single
 door, also glass, directly in front of you.  It's closed.

 The flagstone path leads back south across the lawn.

>drop paddle
 Dropped.

 The gardener walks to a different group of plants and starts digging
 with a hand trowel.

>knock on door
 You step up and knock on the greenhouse door.  You see the gardener
 look your way, then walk toward the door.  It swings open.  You again
 stare intently at your shoes to hide your face.

 "You get that hedge clipped yet?"

 "Yep," you mumble without looking up.

 The gardener nods and picks up a couple of items sitting next to the
 door.  He hands them to you and says, "'Bout time.  Now take these and
 clean up, and this time don't take all day doin' it neither."

 You take the leaf rake and peanut sack and turn to go.  You hear the
 door close sharply behind you.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>examine rake
 The leaf rake consists of a fan of springy metal tines attached to a
 long wooden handle.  It's ideal for raking up loose brush, leaves, and
 grass.

 The gardener shuffles over to one side of the greenhouse and picks
 through some objects on a table.

>examine sack
 The large burlap sack looks just like the ones handed out at fairs for
 sack races.  It has the word "PEANUTS" stenciled in block letters on
 it.  It's closed.

 You smell nothing out of the ordinary.

 The gardener reties some stray branches to a trellis.

>open sack
 Opening the peanut sack reveals three peanuts.

>take peanuts
 Taken.

>examine peanuts
 The peanuts are raw and still in their shells.  They look typical in
 every respect.  You have three peanuts left.

 It takes a bit of doing, but before long you manage to rake the
 scattered hedge clippings into a single large pile.

 You set the peanut sack down and start to work.  The sack is roomier
 than it looks, and after a bit of jamming and cramming you manage to
 get the whole pile of clippings stuffed inside.

 You are carrying a package, a business card, a forked stick, a
 screwdriver, an inner tube, a gold lighter, a screw, some sharp hedge
 clippers, a blown fuse, a shiny penny, a leaf rake, three peanuts, and

 Front Gate
 The gravel driveway widens a bit as it passes through a gate in the
 high stone wall that surrounds the estate.  On the other side of the
 gate the road quickly bends and disappears from sight behind the
 trees.  The neatly trimmed hedge on the west side of the driveway runs
 in a solid, unbroken line right up to the wall.  But, oddly enough,
 there's a narrow gap between the hedge and the wall on the east side.

 You see a sales brochure here (on the other side of the gate).

>take brochure with rake
 You kneel down in front of the closed gate.  There's just enough of a
 gap between the two sides to permit the head of the rake to slip
 through.  Getting your hand through is a bit tougher, but by leaning
 on the gate you manage to widen it enough for that as well.  You
 extend the rake as far as you can toward the piece of paper and lower
 its blade.

 Bulls-eye!

 It takes a bit of patience but you eventually manage to work the piece
 of paper close enough to the gate to be able to reach it.  You pick it
 up and resume your feet.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>read brochure
 The front of the sales brochure contains the standard vinyl siding
 marketing spiel.  Yep, there's the de rigueur before/after picture of
 a dilapidated old house miraculously transformed by the addition of
 the manufacturer's products.  And of course the words "Lifetime
 Guarantee" in thirty point type followed by a microscopic asterisk and
 about five hundred words in three point type.  Mind-numbing stuff.

 The back of the brochure is much more interesting.  The drawing is
 crudely sketched, but there's no doubt that it's some kind of map.  It
 shows a small beach bordered on both sides by fallen rocks and backed
 by a cliff.  There's an arrow pointing to some bushes next to a large
 boulder on the southwest side.  Behind one of the bushes is marked a
 bold X.

 path to the north passes through the trees then bends west toward
 Triton.

>go west
 Grassy Area
 The trees are a bit thinner here, allowing dappled sunlight to reach
 the ground.  As a result there are numerous small clumps of grass
 scattered along this stretch of the footpath.  The footpath bends to
 the southwest behind you.  It continues to the east where it looks
 like it might widen out a bit.

>go southwest
 Under the Oak Tree
 The forest thins slightly here, no doubt due to the huge old oak that
 is blocking most of the sunlight.  The footpath continues from west to
 east along the wall for a bit before bending northeast to go around
 the tree's massive trunk.

>drop paddle
 Dropped.

>go up
 There's only so much you can carry up a tree.  You'd better leave the
 sharp hedge clippers, the leaf rake, and the peanut sack here.

 sharp hedge clippers: Dropped.
 leaf rake: Dropped.
 peanut sack: Dropped.

>go up
 It's been a long time since you last did much tree climbing, but
 you're willing to give it a try.  You grab one of the lower branches
 and pull yourself up.

 Low in the Oak Tree
 You pause to catch your breath at a point that is about ten feet above
 the ground.  The branch under your feet is thick and sturdy, and the
 trunk beside you is reassuringly massive.  You can clearly see the
 peanut sack lying on the ground directly below you.

>go up
 Midway Up the Oak Tree
 The branches aren't quite so thick and sturdy here.  You can feel them
 swaying slightly under you with the wind.  Every once in awhile the
 leaves part enough for you to catch a glimpse of the peanut sack lying
 on the ground some twenty-five feet below.

 There is a three-inch wide hole in the trunk here.  It contains a huge
 pile of acorns.

>take acorn
 The hole is a tight fit, but you manage to squeeze your hand through
 and grab an acorn from the pile.

 Just as you do the squirrel returns, this time taking up sentry duty
 on a nearby branch.  Apparently concerned by your discovery of his
 hidey-hole, he watches warily as you paw around among his stash of
 acorns.

>examine sack
 You can catch an occasional glimpse of the peanut sack full of
 clippings on the ground far below.

>put peanut in sack
 The peanut sack is too far away.

>show peanut to squirrel
 You take one of the peanuts in your free hand and hold it out to where
 the squirrel can see it.  He sniffs and chitters excitedly.
 Apparently he likes peanuts even better than acorns.

>drop peanut
 You drop three peanuts, and watch as they fall out of sight through
 the leaves below.  The squirrel is tempted to chase after it, but
 ultimately decides that the safety of his entire stash of acorns is
 more important.  He remains on station, watching warily.

 A squirrel holding a single large acorn watches you warily from a

 You take one of the peanuts in your free hand and hold it out to where
 the squirrel can see it.  He sniffs and chitters excitedly.  He moves
 cautiously toward you.  You hold very still.

 Closer...
 Cloooser...

 He snatches the peanut, and drops his acorn!  It falls out of sight
 through the branches below.  He scampers back out of reach to consume
 his prize.  You have two peanuts left.

>drop acorn
 You release the acorn and withdraw your hand from the hole.

 Satisfied that his stash of acorns is safe, the squirrel takes off
 down the trunk of the tree in search of the acorn he dropped.

 Having reached the lowest branch, you grab it and swing down out of
 the tree.  It feels good to have your feet on solid ground again.

 The forest thins slightly here, no doubt due to the huge old oak that
 is blocking most of the sunlight.  The footpath continues from west to
 east along the wall for a bit before bending northeast to go around
 the tree's massive trunk.

 You see a paddle, some sharp hedge clippers, a leaf rake, and a peanut
 sack (which contains some hedge clippings) here.

 The squirrel has beaten you to the ground and recovered his acorn!
 You make a grab for him as he darts past, but he evades you easily.
 You begin to consider ways to get down the tree ahead of him as he

 Small Clearing
 This small open area is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth.
 Over the years dry leaves and twigs have accumulated here and now
 cover much of the ground.  Paths lead west, southeast, and north.  The

 Triton.

>go north
 The trees thin quickly, giving way to rolling green lawn as the path

 Triton
 The main path ends here at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The brass plaque in Triton's pedestal is currently standing open.

 Triton

  His ship was the giant Triton,
  the sound of whose conch
  affrighted the dark-blue water.

 You remember reading somewhere that J. Daggett's great-grandfather
 made his fortune as a sea captain.  You can certainly understand why
 he might find the sea-god Triton meaningful.

 You are carrying a package, a business card, a forked stick, a
 screwdriver, an inner tube, a gold lighter, a screw, a blown fuse, a
 shiny penny, two peanuts, a sales brochure, an acorn, a paddle, some
 sharp hedge clippers, a leaf rake, and a peanut sack (which contains
 some hedge clippings).  You're wearing a gimme cap, a chambray work
 shirt, and some leather work gloves.

>look in plaque
 You are quite disappointed to discover that nothing but bare stone
 lies behind the plaque.

>take it
 You can't take that.

>examine bare
 The small bare footpath leads east across the lawn for a short
 distance before bending south toward the woods.

>examine bare stone
 The stone pedestal is circular and rises about two feet above the
 flagstone pavement.  It supports a life-sized bronze sculpture of
 Triton, and has a polished brass plaque attached to the front of it.
 The brass plaque is currently standing open.

>examine sculpture
 The life-size bronze sculpture depicts the Greek sea-god Triton.  He
 is shown as a man from the waist up and has a dolphin's tail in place
 of his legs.  He is holding his signature trident in one hand and his
 conch shell horn in the other.  The beauty and level of detail of the
 sculpture is impressive.

 The brass plaque in Triton's pedestal is currently standing open.

>examine horn
 Maybe you'll have time to study the nuances of lawn sculpture later.
 Right now you have a package to deliver.

>deliver package
 Whom do you want to give it to?

>triton
 You cannot give anything to Triton.

>examine package
 The package is about ten inches long by eight wide, and nearly two
 inches thick.  It is securely wrapped in plain brown paper.  It's
 moderately heavy for its size, and doesn't rattle when shaken.  If you
 had to guess you would say it was a book.  There's something printed
 on it.

>read it
 URGENT!
 Deliver to: J. Daggett Winton
 PERSONAL and CONFIDENTIAL

>put package in plaque
 You have no idea how important or valuable the package might be.  You
 dare not let it out of your hands, even for a second.

>blow conch
 That isn't something you can inflate.

 East Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side
 of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the
 hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking
 the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south.

 Garage
 The garage interior is divided into five open parking bays and a
 service bay equipped with a hydraulic lift and an air compressor.  A
 classic Jaguar E-Type convertible sits on the lift.  The lift is
 currently up.

 A battered old canoe hangs on the wall in bay four.

 A large red tool cabinet sits under the canoe.

 A bicycle is parked in bay two.  Its front wheel is secured by a
 bicycle lock.

 The two-man aluminum canoe hanging from a wall rack in bay four is old
 and battered.  It's had a few to many close encounters with jagged
 rocks, one of which no doubt ripped the gaping hole you can see in its
 bottom.  It's hanging bottom-outward and stored up high to keep it out
 of the way.

 The bicycle is a 50's Schwinn Black Phantom.  It has red pinstriping
 and lots of chrome trim.  The seat is large and comfortable, and its
 spoked wheels are decked out in white wall street tires.  The front
 fender has an integrated headlight, and the rear has an integrated
 tail light and reflector.  Like many 50's bikes there's a sleek
 horntank mounted under the frame's top tube to give it a bit of a
 motorcycle look.  The classic Schwinn cross-in-a-circle logo adorns
 the chain guard.

 The one piece of non-standard equipment on the bike is a small leather
 pouch attached to the back of its seat.  The Schwinn's front wheel is
 secured by a bicycle lock.

 (first standing in bay two)
 The lock has a long hasp that can be inserted through the spokes of a
 bicycle's wheel then locked to its frame to keep the wheel from
 turning.  The body of the lock has four numbered dials for entering
 the combination.  It's currently attached to the Schwinn's front wheel
 and locked.

 (the bicycle lock)
 You cannot turn that.

 Recalling the inscription on the lighter, you set the lock's dials to
 J. Daggett's anniversary date.  Success!  The lock pops open, and you
 remove it from the wheel.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 The Schwinn isn't one of these state-of-the-art titanium,
 lift-with-one-finger racing bikes.  It has a steel tube frame and it's
 both heavy and bulky.  You decide that the easiest way to move it
 would be to ride it.

 There's only so much you can carry while riding a bicycle.  You'd
 better leave the paddle, the sharp hedge clippers, the leaf rake, and
 the peanut sack here.

 The main path ends here at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass

 The plaque is still up, revealing the small recess in the stone behind
 it.  The recess contains a small silver key.

 You quickly peddle the Schwinn right up to the sculpture's pedestal
 and snatch the key out of the recess.  It looks like you made it just
 in the nick of time.

 Without warning the brass plaque begins to slide downward, grating
 loudly across the stone as it moves.  Within moments it has once again

 You set off on the Schwinn, and after a leisurely bit of peddling
 arrive at...

 Garage Entrance (sitting on the bicycle)
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side
 of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the
 hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking
 the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south.

 You carefully maneuver the Schwinn through the side entry door and
 into the garage's interior.

 Garage (sitting on the bicycle)
 The garage interior is divided into five open parking bays and a
 service bay equipped with a hydraulic lift and an air compressor.  A
 classic Jaguar E-Type convertible sits on the lift.  The lift is
 currently up.

 A large red tool cabinet sits under the canoe.

 A battered old canoe hangs on the wall in bay four.

 Bay two contains a paddle, some sharp hedge clippers, a leaf rake, and
 a peanut sack (which contains some hedge clippings).

 (first standing up, then standing in bay four)
 Unlocked.

 Opening the tool cabinet reveals an air hose.

 The word "trap" is not necessary in this story.

>attach hose to connect
 (first taking the air hose, getting out of bay four, then standing in
 the service bay)
 There's a momentary hiss of escaping air as you snap the air hose onto
 the compressor's quick-connect.  You coil it on the ground next to the
 compressor, ready for use.

>attach hose to tube
 (first dropping the inner tube)
 You press the hose's air chuck onto the valve.  Air starts to flow
 into the inner tube.  After a moment or two the compressor motor
 starts.

 The tube fills quickly.  Once you judge it to be fully inflated you
 remove the chuck.  The compressor motor continues to run for a few
 seconds as it replenishes the tank, then shuts off.  You listen for
 the telltale hiss of a leak, but hear nothing.  It looks like your
 patch job is holding.

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>examine tube
 The old black inner tube is fully inflated, and for the moment at
 least your patch job appears to be holding.  It ain't no boat, but it
 should float.

>out
 You step out of the service bay and into the main part of the garage.

>go south
 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for

 of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the
 hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking
 the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south.

>go east
 You pass through the opening you cleared while trimming the hedge and
 turn northeast toward the cliffs.

 Top of the Cliff
 You can see why J. Daggett's great-grandfather chose this site for his
 estate.  The view from the top of the cliff is breathtaking.  The bay
 stretches out before you.  A wide expanse of sandy beach lies below.
 The day is sunny and relatively calm, with only a slight onshore
 breeze.  A gentle swell rolls onto the sand.

 A wide, sandy path leads down to the beach.  The bare footpath leads
 back toward the garage to the southwest.

>go down
 Sandy Beach
 The beach is wide and sandy.  It follows the curve of the bay to the
 east and eventually bends south and disappears behind the cliffs.  To
 the west it ends at a jumble of fallen rock.

>enter tube
 You can't do that while you're holding the inner tube.

>put tube in water
 You toss the inner tube into the water.  It floats nearby.

>enter tube
 You wade out, settle into the inner tube, and start paddling away from
 the beach.  It takes a bit of experimentation to figure out the best
 paddle stroke to use, but before long you've cleared the breakwater
 and are moving along nicely.

 East Bay (sitting on the inner tube)
 You are floating several hundred yards off of the sandy beach to the
 south.  The fallen rocks lie directly to the west.  You'll need to
 paddle northwest to safely clear them.  You rock gently on the light
 swell.

>paddle nw
 You pick a point a hundred feet seaward of the jagged rocks and start
 paddling toward it.  You have to correct your course a bit to
 compensate for the onshore breeze.

 Rocky Point (sitting on the inner tube)
 You are floating just off of the point made by the fallen rocks.  To
 the west you can see a narrow crescent-shaped beach.  The sandy beach
 lies to the southeast.  The jagged edges of the rocks loom dangerously
 close, and the onshore breeze keeps trying to push you closer.  You
 have to paddle vigorously just to maintain your position.

>paddle west
 You safely clear the rocky point and paddle briskly toward the narrow
 crescent-shaped beach to the west.

 West Bay (sitting on the inner tube)
 You are floating several hundred yards off of the narrow
 crescent-shaped beach to the southwest.  The fallen rocks lie to the
 southeast.  You'll need to paddle east to safely clear them.  You rock
 gently on the light swell.

>paddle sw
 You set out for the crescent-shaped beach.  With the breeze to your
 back it doesn't take long to clear the breakwater.  You stand up and
 drag the inner tube ashore.

 Crescent Beach
 The beach is a narrow crescent strewn with broken shells and hemmed in
 on both ends by a jumble of fallen rock.  There are a couple of large
 boulders surrounded by thick brush standing against the face of the
 cliff.  Above them is a wide ledge surrounded by a safety railing.
 The steps that once led from the ledge to the beach have collapsed
 into a twisted pile of corroded metal.

 You see an inner tube here.

>search shells
 (two peanuts)
 There's nothing unusual in two peanuts.

>search broken shells
 The broken shells aren't important.

>examine bush
 There's a lot of brush growing along the base of the cliff.  It's
 thickest around the two large boulders.

>look behind bush
 You see nothing unusual behind the thick brush.

>examine boulders
 The boulders are the size of a small house.  They're standing against
 the face of the cliff and are surrounded by thick brush.

>examine brush
 There's a lot of brush growing along the base of the cliff.  It's
 thickest around the two large boulders.

>read map
 The front of the sales brochure contains the standard vinyl siding
 marketing spiel.

 The back of the brochure is much more interesting.  The drawing is
 crudely sketched, but there's no doubt that it's some kind of map.  It
 shows a small beach bordered on both sides by fallen rocks and backed
 by a cliff.  There's an arrow pointing to some bushes next to a large
 boulder on the southwest side.  Behind one of the bushes is marked a
 bold X.

>examine x
 You see no x here.

>look behind bushes
 You see nothing unusual behind the thick brush.

 Using what you remember from reading the map on the back of the
 brochure as a guide, you carefully search the brush next to the large
 boulder on the southwest side of the beach.  You discover the hidden
 entrance to a shallow cave.

>examine cave
 Now that you know where to look, you can just make out the entrance to
 the shallow cave behind the brush to the southwest.

>go southwest
 Shallow Cave
 The cave is actually little more than a sheltered niche in the rocks.
 It's barely big enough for you to stand in.  The walls are bare rock.
 Light filters in from the opening to the northeast.

 There's a large sample case sitting on the cave floor.

>examine case
 The sample case is much larger and heavier than most.  It's covered in
 genuine tan pebble-textured Naugahyde with a matching handle and it
 has shiny brass hardware.  There's a small brass nameplate on the
 front.  It's closed.

>read nameplate
 The nameplate has the initials D.R.S. engraved on it.  It looks like
 you've found Mr. Splatz's sample case.  You're just glad you didn't
 also find his dead hand still clutching the handle.

>open case
 You open the case and discover that it's filled with vinyl siding
 samples.  Dozens of 'em, in a rainbow of attractive, guaranteed never
 to fade decorator colors.  There are also little miniature storm door
 samples, and gutter samples, and a ring of colored tags so the
 customers can pick their favorite shade of pastel, and catalogs, and a
 photo album of finished projects, and more brochures, and...

 You quickly snap the case closed before the vinyl fumes overwhelm you.

>take case
 You grab the handle and pick up the sample case.  It's surprisingly
 heavy.

 The sample case is too large and heavy to haul back in the inner tube.
 You'll have to find some other way of getting it off of the stony
 beach.

 You are carrying a package, a business card, a forked stick, a
 screwdriver, a gold lighter, a screw, a blown fuse, a shiny penny, two
 peanuts, a sales brochure, an acorn, a bicycle lock, a small silver
 key, a paddle, and a sample case.  You're wearing a gimme cap, a
 chambray work shirt, and some leather work gloves.

 Top of the Cliff
 You can see why J. Daggett's great-grandfather chose this site for his
 estate.  The view from the top of the cliff is breathtaking.  The bay
 stretches out before you.  A wide expanse of sandy beach lies below.
 The day is sunny and relatively calm, with only a slight onshore
 breeze.  A gentle swell rolls onto the sand.

 A wide, sandy path leads down to the beach.  The bare footpath leads
 back toward the garage to the southwest.

>go west
 You leave the cliffs behind and head back toward the garage.  A brisk
 hike soon brings you to the opening you cleared while trimming the
 hedge.

 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side
 of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the
 hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking
 the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south.

>go north
 Garage
 The garage interior is divided into five open parking bays and a
 service bay equipped with a hydraulic lift and an air compressor.  A
 classic Jaguar E-Type convertible sits on the lift.  The lift is
 currently up.

 A large red tool cabinet sits under the canoe.

 A bicycle is parked next to you in the garage.

 A battered old canoe hangs on the wall in bay four.

 The service bay contains an air hose (attached to the compressor).
 Bay two contains some sharp hedge clippers, a leaf rake, and a peanut
 sack (which contains some hedge clippings).

>take canoe
 (first standing in bay four)
 The battered old canoe is to high for you to be able to reach from the
 garage floor.

>stand on cabinet
 Just to be safe, you should close the tool cabinet before trying to
 climb on top of it.

>close cabinet
 Closed.

>stand on it
 Okay, you're now standing on the tool cabinet.

>take canoe
 The gaping hole in the bottom of the canoe is big enough to sink it
 like a rock.  You might as well leave it where it is.

>examine hole
 (the hole in the canoe)
 It looks like the canoe has had a few to many close encounters with
 jagged rocks, one of which no doubt ripped the gaping hole you can see
 in its bottom.  You're no expert, but it looks to be beyond repair.

 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side
 of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the
 hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking
 the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south.

>go west
 The thick (but neatly trimmed) hedge blocks your way.  Obvious exits
 lead north, back to the garage; south, to the east gravel driveway;
 and east, to the top of the cliff.

>go south
 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

>go south
 The thick (but neatly trimmed) hedge blocks your way.  Obvious exits
 lead north, back to the garage entrance; east, to the east lawn; and
 west, to the gravel driveway.

>go west
 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

>go west
 West Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 The main path leads north toward what appears to be greenhouse in the
 distance.  The way back to the mansion is east.

>go west
 Poseidon & Amphitrite
 The flagstone path ends at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The main flagstone path leads back east.  A rocky footpath leads north
 toward the cliffs overlooking the ocean.

>go north
 You soon realize you're in for a bit of a hike.  The path passes to
 the east of a large greenhouse, then bends northeast toward the cliffs
 overlooking the ocean.  The ground turns rocky and starts sloping
 downward.  Before long you're winding down stairs cut into the face of
 the cliff.

 Crescent Beach Overlook
 The steps end at wide ledge overlooking the ocean.  The stairway that
 once continued on down the cliff face to the narrow crescent-shaped
 beach some fifty feet below you has collapsed into a twisted pile of
 corroded metal.  The beach itself is littered with broken shells and
 hemmed in on both ends by a jumble of fallen rock.  A rusty iron
 railing surrounds the overlook and protects you from falling.

 The way back starts with a long climb back up the steps.

>tie hose to railing
 You tie one end of the air hose to the iron railing and toss the other
 end over the edge of the cliff.  The hose is thicker and stiffer than
 a typical rope and you can only manage a single overhand knot.  Even
 so it will probably hold more weight than the rusty railing can
 handle.  A quick check confirms that the free end of the hose is
 hanging a couple of feet above the ground below.

>go south
 The hike back isn't any shorter, and it's all uphill.  You're huffing
 and puffing a bit by the time you make it back to Poseidon &
 Amphitrite.

 Poseidon & Amphitrite
 The flagstone path ends at a circular open area, also paved in gray
 flagstone.  There is a large and beautifully crafted bronze sculpture
 set on an elevated stone pedestal in its center.  A polished brass
 plaque is attached to the pedestal below the sculpture.  Decorative
 concrete benches are spaced around the perimeter of the pavement.  The
 entire area is completely surrounded by lush flower beds.

 The main flagstone path leads back east.  A rocky footpath leads north
 toward the cliffs overlooking the ocean.

>go east
 West Lawn
 The flagstone path runs east to west through acres of low, rolling
 hills covered by emerald-green lawn.  The path itself is bordered on
 both sides by lush flower beds.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

 The main path leads north toward what appears to be greenhouse in the
 distance.  The way back to the mansion is east.

>go east
 Gravel Driveway
 The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
 off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the
 building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
 of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
 flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
 generally thicker to the south.

>go east
 East Driveway
 The driveway bends to the north here, leading toward a large
 outbuilding in the distance.  A flagstone path passes through the
 hedge to the east.  The way back to the mansion is west.  Otherwise
 the neatly trimmed hedge continues unbroken along the outside edge of
 the driveway on both sides.

>go north
 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side
 of the driveway to the garage.  A bare footpath passes through the
 hedge to the east then bends northeast toward the cliffs overlooking
 the ocean.  The driveway leads back to the south.

>go east
 You pass through the opening you cleared while trimming the hedge and
 turn northeast toward the cliffs.

 Top of the Cliff
 You can see why J. Daggett's great-grandfather chose this site for his
 estate.  The view from the top of the cliff is breathtaking.  The bay
 stretches out before you.  A wide expanse of sandy beach lies below.
 The day is sunny and relatively calm, with only a slight onshore
 breeze.  A gentle swell rolls onto the sand.

 A wide, sandy path leads down to the beach.  The bare footpath leads
 back toward the garage to the southwest.

>go down
 Sandy Beach
 The beach is wide and sandy.  It follows the curve of the bay to the
 east and eventually bends south and disappears behind the cliffs.  To
 the west it ends at a jumble of fallen rock.

 You see an inner tube and a paddle here.

>take all
 inner tube: Taken.
 paddle: Taken.

>put tube in water
 You toss the inner tube into the water.  It floats nearby.

>eater tube
 The word "eater" is not necessary in this story.

>enter tube
 You wade out, settle into the inner tube, and start paddling away from
 the beach.  It takes a bit of experimentation to figure out the best
 paddle stroke to use, but before long you've cleared the breakwater
 and are moving along nicely.

 East Bay (sitting on the inner tube)
 You are floating several hundred yards off of the sandy beach to the
 south.  The fallen rocks lie directly to the west.  You'll need to
 paddle northwest to safely clear them.  You rock gently on the light
 swell.

>go northwest
 You pick a point a hundred feet seaward of the jagged rocks and start
 paddling toward it.  You have to correct your course a bit to
 compensate for the onshore breeze.

 Rocky Point (sitting on the inner tube)
 You are floating just off of the point made by the fallen rocks.  To
 the west you can see a narrow crescent-shaped beach.  The sandy beach
 lies to the southeast.  The jagged edges of the rocks loom dangerously
 close, and the onshore breeze keeps trying to push you closer.  You
 have to paddle vigorously just to maintain your position.

>go west
 You safely clear the rocky point and paddle briskly toward the narrow
 crescent-shaped beach to the west.

 West Bay (sitting on the inner tube)
 You are floating several hundred yards off of the narrow
 crescent-shaped beach to the southwest.  The fallen rocks lie to the
 southeast.  You'll need to paddle east to safely clear them.  You rock
 gently on the light swell.

>go southwest
 You set out for the crescent-shaped beach.  With the breeze to your
 back it doesn't take long to clear the breakwater.  You stand up and
 drag the inner tube ashore.

 Crescent Beach
 The beach is a narrow crescent strewn with broken shells and hemmed in
 on both ends by a jumble of fallen rock.  There are a couple of large
 boulders surrounded by thick brush standing against the face of the
 cliff.  Above them is a wide ledge surrounded by a safety railing.
 The steps that once led from the ledge to the beach have collapsed
 into a twisted pile of corroded metal.

 An air hose hangs from the iron railing above you.  Its free end sways
 within easy reach.

 You can just make out the entrance to a shallow cave behind the brush
 to the southwest.

 You see a sample case and an inner tube here.

>tie hose to case
 You feed the free end of the air hose through the handle of the sample
 case and tie a knot.  You lower the case until it's full weight is
 held by the hose.  The rusty iron railing above you creaks and wobbles
 ominously, but for the moment at least seems to be holding.  The case
 sways gently in the breeze.

>take tube
 Taken.

>put it in water
 You toss the inner tube into the water.  It floats nearby.

>enter tube
 You wade out, settle into the inner tube, and start paddling away from

 You leave the cliffs behind and head back toward the garage.  A brisk

 hedge.

 Garage Entrance
 To the north the driveway ends at the entrance to a large garage.  You
 count six bay doors for vehicles, as well as a side entry door for
 those on foot.  The neatly trimmed hedge continues along the west side

>go north
 You soon realize you're in for a bit of a hike.  The path passes to
 the east of a large greenhouse, then bends northeast toward the cliffs
 overlooking the ocean.  The ground turns rocky and starts sloping
 downward.  Before long you're winding down stairs cut into the face of
 the cliff.

 Crescent Beach Overlook
 The steps end at wide ledge overlooking the ocean.  The stairway that
 once continued on down the cliff face to the narrow crescent-shaped
 beach some fifty feet below you has collapsed into a twisted pile of
 corroded metal.  The beach itself is littered with broken shells and
 hemmed in on both ends by a jumble of fallen rock.  A rusty iron
 railing surrounds the overlook and protects you from falling.

 The way back starts with a long climb back up the steps.

 An air hose is tied to the iron railing next to you.  Its free end
 hangs over the edge of the cliff.  It has a sample case tied to it.

>take hose
 You try to keep the sample case from banging into the face of the
 cliff as you haul the hose up.  You can imagine it popping open and
 scattering samples and brochures all over the beach.  But it holds
 together, and with a bit of effort you manage to drag it over the rail
 and set it on the ground.  You untie both ends of the air hose and
 toss it aside.

>take case
 You grab the handle and pick up the sample case.  It's surprisingly
 heavy.

 My, what a cheery little omen.

>knock on door
 As best as you can tell you're all set for your debut as a vinyl
 siding salesman.  You just hope you can figure out some really clever
 way to SAVE yourself from almost certain torture and death once you
 get inside.  (Knock again to continue.)

>again
 You set the sample case on the steps next to you, take the business
 card and sales brochure in hand, square your shoulders, take a deep
 breath, and rap your knuckles firmly on the door.  The thudding of
 your heart sounds louder than the footsteps thudding down the hall.
 The door swings open.  Dark eyes glare at you.

 "Good afternoon sir!  My name is Splatz, Dwayne R. Splatz.  But please
 call me Dwayne, everybody else does.  Ha ha."  You hand the butler
 your card.  His scowl darkens.

 "I'm here today representing Plasti-Side Inc.'s complete line of vinyl
 siding products."  You make a show of looking around.  "You have a
 pretty nice place here, and I'm sure you'd like to keep it that way.
 And believe me, there's nothing like vinyl siding for keeping a home
 looking great!"

 The butler's scowl becomes thunderous.  You see his thick fingers
 clutch into mallet-sized fists.  You suppress a sudden overwhelming
 urge to see Paris one more time before you die, starting right now
 with a really quick trip down the steps.  You hand the butler your
 sales brochure.

 "As you can see by these photographs, our products can make a dramatic
 difference in the appearance of almost any structure.  And unlike our
 competitors who make their siding from old LP records, we use only the
 finest virgin vinyl in their manufacture. In fact I happen to have
 several nice samples here with me.  Let me just show you..."

 You bend over to reach for your sample case.  You don't even see the
 massive fist hurtling toward your head.

 Lying Unconscious
 The blackness slowly diminishes...

 The first thing you become aware of is something cold and hard
 pressing against your face.  It takes you a moment to figure out it's
 the floor.  You open your eyes, and discover that you've been dumped
 in the corner of a large stone chamber.

 You struggle to your feet.

 Dungeon
 The chamber is large an oppressive.  Tall stone columns support heavy
 overhead beams.  Flickering torches make shadows on the wall.  It
 feels like you're deep underground, but you could just as easily be in
 a windowless tower.

 It's not hard to figure out the chamber's purpose.  In fact you're
 rather surprised not to see manacled skeletons hanging from the walls
 and an iron maiden in the corner.  There is a torture rack however, or
 at least the modern high-tech equivalent of one.  It's sitting against
 the far wall.  The only visible exit is the open doorway next to it.

 The butler is standing next to the torture rack with his back to you.
 It looks like he's busy preparing it for use.

 Lying Unconscious (Again)
 The blackness slowly diminishes...

 You sit up and look around with a start.  You fully expect to find
 yourself strapped to the rack in the dungeon.  But you see blue sky
 overhead.  It takes you a moment to recognize your surroundings.
 You're lying on a patch of grass next to a gravel road.  Tall trees
 loom overhead.  Just to the north is a high stone wall, and a very
 familiar-looking iron gate.

 You struggle to your feet.  Nothing seems to be broken.  In fact,
 aside from a sore jaw and a pounding headache you're in perfect
 health.  You're also, for the first time since you got here,

 Lying Unconscious (Again)
 The blackness slowly diminishes...

 You sit up and look around with a start.  You fully expect to find
 yourself strapped to the rack in the dungeon.  But you see blue sky
 overhead.  It takes you a moment to recognize your surroundings.
 You're lying on a patch of grass next to a gravel road.  Tall trees
 loom overhead.  Just to the north is a high stone wall, and a very
 familiar-looking iron gate.

 You struggle to your feet.  Nothing seems to be broken.  In fact,
 aside from a sore jaw and a pounding headache you're in perfect
 health.  You're also, for the first time since you got here,
 completely empty-handed.

 Outside the Gate
 The mansion's main gate is closed and locked behind you.  The package
 is gone.  The way home lies down the road to the south.  It will be
 dark soon.  You might as well start walking.

>go south
 You give the gate a final shake, turn, and start your long, lonely
 hike back up the road.

 Dungeon
 The chamber is large an oppressive.  Tall stone columns support heavy
 overhead beams.  Flickering torches make shadows on the wall.  It
 feels like you're deep underground, but you could just as easily be in
 a windowless tower.

 It's not hard to figure out the chamber's purpose.  In fact you're
 rather surprised not to see manacled skeletons hanging from the walls
 and an iron maiden in the corner.  There is a torture rack however, or
 at least the modern high-tech equivalent of one.  It's sitting against
 the far wall.  The only visible exit is the open doorway next to it.

 The butler is standing next to the torture rack with his back to you.
 It looks like he's busy preparing it for use.

>shoot skeleton with slingshot
 Thankfully there aren't any skeletons hanging in the dungeon.

 The butler adjusts one of the dials on the rack's control panel and
 pushes a red button.  The indicator lights flash, but nothing else
 obvious happens.  He scratches his head, then pulls his spiral
 notebook out of his pocket and lays it on the rack.  He begins to flip
 through its pages.

>examine panel
 The control panel is mounted to the wall over the rack.  It has two
 round black dials for setting various functions, and a large red
 pushbutton for activating them.  Several indicator lights, also
 unlabeled, flash in seemingly random patterns.  A pair of electrical
 cables tipped with clamps hang from the bottom of the panel.

 The butler adjusts one of the dials on the rack's control panel and
 pushes a red button.  The indicator lights flash, but nothing else
 obvious happens.  He scratches his head, then pulls his spiral
 notebook out of his pocket and lays it on the rack.  He begins to flip
 through its pages.

 You carefully consider your options.  The butler has his back to you,
 and looks engrossed in his task.  You figure you have a good chance to
 make the open doorway.  You decide to go for it.

 You start by crouching low and moving forward as quietly as possible,
 but you only manage a couple of steps before your flickering shadow on
 the wall gives you away.  The butler grunts in surprise and spins
 around.  You kick it into high gear.

 He moves quickly to cut you off and lunges for you as you dart by.
 You duck and dodge to the left.  His hand misses, but you loose your
 balance and tumble to the floor.  Your head cracks hard against cold,
 unyielding stone.

 open on the rack in front of him.

>read notebook
 (first trying to take the spiral notebook)
 The last thing in the world you want to do is get anywhere near the
 torture rack.  You decide to try something else.

 Having found the information he was looking for in his notebook, the
 butler turns a dial one click to the left and pushes the red button.
 Lights flash.  The four winches mounted to the corners of the rack
 whine to life and start spooling out cable.  He lets them run briefly,
 then pushes the button again to stop them.

 (with the slingshot)
 You take careful aim at the control panel, draw back the acorn, and
 fire.  The acorn flies wide, hits the stone wall, and explodes into a
 thousand pieces.  Startled, the butler spins around with a snarl and
 starts toward you.  You bolt for the doorway.  (first removing the

 The word "maiden" is not necessary in this story.

>shoot notebook
 The last thing in the world you want to do is get anywhere near the
 torture rack.  You decide to try something else.

 The butler turns the same dial one click to the right and pushes the
 red button.  The cables retract.  The winches stop automatically when
 the cables are fully retracted.

 The rack sits against the far wall.  Its main component is a large
 metal table with a perforated steel top.  The traditional large barrel
 winch and ratchet have been replaced with modern cable winches at each
 corner.  Shackles are attached to the winches.  Electrical cables and
 clamps hang from a control panel mounted to the wall above the table.
 A hot iron is warming up in an electric brazier attached to the foot
 of the table.  The butler's notebook is lying open on the rack's
 perforated steel top.

 The butler clicks the same dial to a new position, pushes the button,
 then rotates the other dial clockwise.  The glow of the electric
 brazier intensifies.

 Dungeon
 The chamber is large an oppressive.  Tall stone columns support heavy
 overhead beams.  Flickering torches make shadows on the wall.  It
 feels like you're deep underground, but you could just as easily be in

 It looks like he's busy preparing it for use.  His notebook is lying
 open on the rack in front of him.

>examine beams
 Maybe you'll have time to study torture chamber construction details
 later.  Right now you have your ass to save.

 The butler uncoils the two electric cables and lays them out on the
 bench.  He selects a new dial position, and pushes the red button.
 There's a crack of electricity as twin arcs jump between the ends of
 the cables and the top of the bench.  He punches the button again to
 shut the current off.

>climb columns
 The stone columns aren't important.

 Apparently dissatisfied with the result, the butler turns one of the
 dials all the way clockwise and pushes the button.  The clamps jump
 and the sharp crackle of electricity fills the air.  He lets them buzz
 for a couple of seconds then punches the button again to shut them
 off.

 Time passes...

 The butler picks up the ends of the cables and holds them up to the
 light.  He inspects them closely, probably looking for signs of
 pitting or corrosion.

 (with the slingshot)
 You take careful aim at the large red pushbutton, draw back the acorn,
 and fire.  The acorn flies true, smacks squarely into its intended
 target, and explodes into a thousand pieces.  Electrical current arcs
 through the butler's body.  Unable to let go of the cables, he jerks
 wildly until a breaker in the control panel finally opens and shuts
 the power off.  He slowly collapses into a twitching heap on the
 floor.

 Seeing your chance, you toss the slingshot aside and make a break for
 the doorway.  You do have the presence of mind to grab the butler's
 notebook as you pass by the rack.  He groans loudly, hurrying you on
 your way.

 You plunge through the open doorway into darkness.  Unable to see, you
 slow and begin to feel your way along the wall.  The stone quickly
 gives way to cold metal.  You see a faint glow of light ahead of you.
 You move toward it, and enter a small square room.  As soon as you
 cross the threshold a sliding steel door whooshes closed behind you.
 An overhead fluorescent fixture flickers to life.

 Elevator Room
 This small, windowless room has bare metal walls and two exits - the
 sliding steel door you entered through to the south, and a pair of
 elevator doors ahead of you to the north.  It is lit by a recessed
 fluorescent fixture in the ceiling.  The elevator doors are closed.
 The control panel mounted on the wall next to the elevator looks
 unusually complex.

 Did you by any chance pick up anything on your way out of the dungeon?
 [1/7]


 Check your inventory. [2/7]


 Have you read the butler's notebook? [3/7]


 Done.

 You flip through the pages of the notebook looking for something,
 anything you can use.  Salesman shot put records.  Nope.  Recipe for
 Thai Red Curry Beef.  Nope.  A bunch of stuff in one of the Asian
 languages.  Nope.  Torture rack operation and maintenance.  Nope,
 nope, and nope.  You finally find what you're looking for at the very
 back of the notebook The first part looks like it was copied right out
 of an operating manual.

 Guide to Elevator Operation:
 1.  Press RESET to start.
 2.  Press one or more grid buttons (A1..E5) to extinguish them.  Note
 that only one row of buttons (A..E) may be accessed during a single
 entry cycle.
 3.  Press NEXT when you have completed your selection(s) to end your
 entry cycle.
 4.  The controller will extinguish one or more grid buttons (following
 the rules above) and complete it's entry cycle.
 5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until all grid buttons have been extinguished.
 6.  The elevator door will open if, and only if, the controller is
 forced to extinguish the last available button.

 The next page is filled with a list of the butler's personal notes on
 the control panel.  They're also in English (thank goodness), and have
 been heavily crossed out and revised.  It looks like he spent quite a
 bit of time struggling with it.

 Tips
 - The AI is randomized.  J.D.W. says there's no fixed pattern that
 will always work.  I actually have to outplay the damn thing every
 time!
 - I can make it go first by just pushing NEXT, but when I do it always
 wins.
 - E1 seems to be a good first move.
 - Push Next, and after it takes one try to get it into a 2-2-4-4
 pattern if possible.  Otherwise push Reset and try again.
 - From there just keep the rows evenly matched until it's down to 2-1.
 Take the 2 and Bob's your uncle!

 There's one page left.  It contains a single note.
 Or I could just blow it off and use the access card J.D.W. gave me.

 You turn the final page, but all that remains is the notebook's back
 cover.  And taped to the inside of that is a paper sleeve containing a
 white plastic access card.

>examine card
 The card is the same size as a credit card.  Like a credit card it has
 a magnetic stripe down one side.  It is otherwise completely blank.

>take card
 Taken.

>put card in slot
 You push the access card into the slot and pull it out quickly.
 Success!  The panel beeps twice and all the lights go out.

 The elevator continues to move steadily upward.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The elevator slows to a stop.  The doors whoosh open.  You look out
 onto a long, beautifully appointed hallway.  You sigh with relief.
 You've finally made it into the main part of the mansion.  Elated, you
 step out of the elevator and into the hall.  The elevator doors whoosh
 closed behind you.

 You're still trying to figure out which way to go when a heavyset
 figure in a black tuxedo steps out of the shadows to stand directly in
 front of you.  You recognize him instantly.  The butler!

 Your mind whirls.  Fight, or flee?  The elevator doors are closed
 behind you.  You're at the far end of the hall so the only way you can
 go is toward the butler.  You look around for a weapon.  A suit of
 armor holding a double-bladed axe would be about right.  Then
 suddenly, and without warning, the butler does something totally
 unexpected.

 He smiles, and bows.

 "Good, evening, and welcome to Seacliff.  Mr. Winton is expecting you.
 If you will be so kind as to follow me I will take you to his study."

 The butler's guttural grunts and snarls have completely vanished.  He
 speaks to you with a perfect clipped British accent.  You're stunned.
 A thousand questions flood your mind.

 Main Hall
 J. Daggett Winton's mansion has the kind of tasteful elegance that
 only the seriously wealthy can afford.  The floor is Italian marble.
 Groupings of antique furniture sit on Persian rugs.  Impressionist
 paintings hang on the walls.  The skylight is Tiffany stained glass.
 And that's just the hall.  You can't even imagine what the rooms must
 be like.

 You're standing at the far north end of the mansion's main hall.  The
 closed entrance doors can be seen at the other end of the hall.  The
 elevator doors, also closed, are directly behind you to the south.

 The butler is standing here.  He is waiting for you to follow him to
 Mr. Winton's study.

>follow butler
 He sets off down the hall at a brisk pace.  You fall in behind him.

 The hall branches left and right.  You pass open doors leading into a
 regal dining room, a huge mahogany-paneled library overflowing with
 leather-bound volumes, a comfortably appointed study, and an atrium
 filled with exotic plants.  You finally turn right down a side hall
 and stop before a closed door.

 "Mr. Winton's study," the butler informs you.  He glances
 disapprovingly at your somewhat rumpled appearance.  "I will knock and
 announce your arrival when you are ready."

 "Hey, thanks to you I've had a pretty rough day," you grumble as you
 tuck in your shirt.  You do your best to imitate his first words to
 you.  "You have appointment?"

 The butler grins.  "All part of the first-class service visitors to
 Seacliff have come to expect."

 Ignoring him for the moment, you run your fingers through your tousled
 hair, take in a deep breath, and let it out.  You decide that short of
 a shower and a change of clothes, you're as ready to meet the famously
 reclusive J. Daggett Winton as you're going to be.  You catch the
 butler's eye and nod.

 Study Entrance
 You are standing in a short side hallway just outside J. Daggett
 Winton's study door.  Its wainscoted walls are hung with portraits of
 his Winton ancestors going back to Captain Darren Lamont Winton III.

 The butler is standing here.  He is waiting for you to follow him into
 Mr. Winton's study.

>follow butler
 He steps up to the door and knocks firmly.  You hear a deep, assertive
 voice respond, "Come in."

 The butler opens the door and announces you.  He steps aside.  The
 moment you've been working toward has finally arrived.  You tuck the
 package firmly under your arm and step into J. Daggett Winton's
 private study.  His task complete, the butler departs, closing the
 door behind you.

 J. Daggett smiles and offers his hand.  Once you're comfortably seated
 in his guest chair he gets right to the point.  "I believe you have
 something for me."

 Study
 You expected a dimly-lit chamber filled with dark leather furniture
 and smelling of single-malt scotch and cigar smoke.  You're surprised
 to discover that J. Daggett's study is light, airy, and quite modern.
 Instead of oak and mahogany the walls and bookcases are made from
 natural cherry.  Dozens of sticky-notes litter his expansive desk.  It
 is also home to two large flat-screen computer terminals and an array
 of state-of-the-art communications equipment.  Message lights flash.
 Market quotes scroll across one terminal.  The other is
 teleconferenced into a board meeting of some kind.

 The second big surprise is J. Daggett Winton himself.  He still looks
 like the same swarthy, ruggedly-handsome businessman/adventurer who
 used to be featured in the news on an almost daily basis.  A little
 older, a little wearier perhaps.  But the glint of brilliance in his
 keen gray eyes hasn't dimmed in the least.  However the information
 about the accident that had taken Emmeline's life hadn't included any
 mention of his own injuries.  There is no office chair behind his
 desk.  It has been removed to make room for his high-tech powered
 wheelchair.

 J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you
 to deliver the package.

>give package to winton
 You've carried the package so long that you're almost reluctant to
 part with it.  But clearly the time has come to do just that.  You
 rise slightly and place it in J. Daggett's outstretched hands.

 "Ah, finally," he beams.  He checks the wrapping paper to make sure it
 hasn't been tampered with.  Slipping a finger under a taped seam he
 tears it open.

 You guessed it might be a book, and you are correct.  But what kind of
 book?  A rare Gutenberg Bible, or perhaps one of Leonardo da Vinci's
 lost notebooks?  Your pulse quickens with excitement.  You lean
 forward and just manage to catch sight of the dust jacket.

 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
 by J.K. Rowling

 "Stunned" doesn't even begin to describe how you feel.  It slowly
 sinks in that you have risked life and limb to deliver a Harry Potter
 book to J. Daggett Winton!  But then again, maybe there's something
 special about this particular copy of this particular Harry Potter
 book.  Perhaps it is a signed first-edition of some kind with a
 personal note from J.K. Rowling herself inscribed inside the cover.

 Then you see the little blue sticker on the cover.

 WAL*MART
 $13.99

 You slump into your chair like a deflated balloon!  At least J.
 Daggett seems happy enough with it.  He thumbs the pages, checks the
 binding, then turns and slides it onto the bookshelf behind him.  You
 do notice that it fits neatly into one of the few gaps in the
 overflowing shelves, and that it is sitting next to books 1 & 2 of the
 series.

 You finally manage to regain enough of your composure to realize that
 J. Daggett has been watching your reaction to the package's contents
 with great amusement.  Smiling broadly, he says, "I'm sure you have a
 number of questions running through your mind right now.  You have my
 full attention, and my gratitude for a job well done.  Please feel
 free to ask anything you like."

 (You could ask him about himself, the package, Emmeline, the butler,
 the gardener, the groundskeeper, the salesmen, or Harry Potter, or
 give him the gold lighter, or the spiral notebook.)

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

>ask daggett about package
 You still can't believe that everything you've been through was for
 the sole purpose of delivering a Harry Potter book.  There just has to
 be more to it than that.  But what?  Not sure how J. Daggett might
 react to your questioning his motives, you proceed carefully.

 "I hope that you received everything you were, uh, expecting."

 J. Daggett's eyes twinkle with concealed amusement.  "Oh yes, I
 certainly did.  In fact I'm quite pleased with both of your deliveries
 today."

 "Both?" you ask in puzzlement.

 "Yes, both.  And no, there are no secret messages written in invisible
 ink on the wrapping paper.  But we still have a few other things we
 need to discuss before I tell you what that second delivery actually
 was."

 (You could ask him about himself, Emmeline, the butler, the gardener,
 the groundskeeper, the salesmen, or Harry Potter, or give him the gold
 lighter, or the spiral notebook.)

>ask daggett about himself
 "I've heard a great deal about you," you say politely.  "I'm glad to
 finally have the chance to meet you in person."

 "Not too disappointed I hope," J. Daggett replies.  "I manage my
 public image almost as carefully as I manage my businesses.  Or at
 least I did before the accident.  After that I had more pressing
 matters to attend to."

 He pauses reflectively for a moment then clears his throat.  "Anyway,
 let's just say that the real J. Daggett Winton is more interested in
 making discoveries than in making money, prefers a cold beer to fine
 wine, can't resist a challenge, wins with grace, and tries to never
 lose the same way twice.

 Now let's move on to something more interesting than me, shall we."

 (You could ask him about Emmeline, the butler, the gardener, the
 groundskeeper, the salesmen, or Harry Potter, or give him the gold
 lighter, or the spiral notebook.)

>give lighter to daggett
 You reach into your pocket and pull out the gold lighter.  Showing it
 to J. Daggett, you say, "I came across this while I was in the garage.
 It was under the Jaguar.  Based on the inscription I assume it belongs
 to you."

 J. Daggett's fingers almost tremble as he takes the lighter from you.
 He gently rubs it between his palms to feel the familiar heft and
 smoothness of its polished surface, then holding it up to the light he
 reads the inscription.  He sighs happily.  "I've been looking all over
 for this.  It was a first anniversary gift from Emmeline.  It was
 under the Jaguar you say?  No wonder I couldn't find it!  Thank you
 for returning it."

 (You could ask him about Emmeline, the butler, the gardener, the
 groundskeeper, the salesmen, or Harry Potter, or give him the spiral
 notebook.)

>ask daggett about emmeline
 Normally you would avoid bringing up something as clearly painful as
 the loss of someone's wife, but the more you talk to J. Daggett the
 more she seems to somehow be related to the package you just
 delivered.  Even so, you decide to proceed carefully.

 "I read the inscription on the gold lighter I found.  Your wife seems
 like someone very special."

 "Very special indeed," J. Daggett replies softly.  After a moment his
 voice firms.  "But we still have a few other things we need to discuss
 before I tell you any more about Emmeline."

 (You could ask him about the butler, the gardener, the groundskeeper,
 the salesmen, or Harry Potter, or give him the spiral notebook.)

>ask daggett about butler
 "I had a bit of a run-in with your butler.  Then when I met him again
 in the hall, he was a completely different person.  Does he have an
 evil twin or something?"

 J. Daggett laughs and replies, "No, no evil twin.  Harold has many
 talents, not the least of which is acting.  He also has an MBA from
 Oxford, a beautiful wife, three kids, and thanks to generations of
 shrewd investing, so much money in the family that if I ever needed a
 loan I'd go to him first.  I keep trying to get him to run one of my
 corporations, but he just likes being a butler.  His family has been
 with ours since the sailing days, and for him, it's a matter of honor
 and tradition."

 J. Daggett smiles in fond memory.  "You know, we grew up together
 here.  We had a great time poking around this huge old place.  He is
 as true a friend as a person could ever ask for.  I owe him a great
 deal, including my life.  But before I tell you that story I need to
 show you something important."

 (You could ask him about his story, the gardener, the groundskeeper,
 the salesmen, or Harry Potter, or give him the spiral notebook.)

>ask daggett about triton
 J. Daggett looks thoughtful.  Finally he says, "An interesting topic
 for another time.  But for now there are more important things we need
 to discuss."

 (You could ask him about his story, the gardener, the groundskeeper,
 the salesmen, or Harry Potter, or give him the spiral notebook.)

>ask daggett about harry potter
 You try not to sound too peevish.  "You must be quite a Harry Potter
 fan."

 J. Daggett completely ignores any hint of hidden meaning that might
 lie within your question and answers simply, "Yes, I am as a matter of
 fact.  The books are superbly written and tell a great story.  I'm
 really looking forward to reading the one you just delivered."

 (You could ask him about his story, the gardener, the groundskeeper,
 or the salesmen, or give him the spiral notebook.)

>ask daggett about salesmen
 "So what's the story on torturing salesmen anyway?"

 J. Daggett laughs.  "Purely a scare tactic.  The plaque by the door
 keeps most of them away.  The few who persist get one look at the
 rack, a quite harmless theatrical prop I might add, and flee for their
 lives.  Only one actual salesperson has ever made it all the way into
 my study.  A fellow by the name of Splatz I believe.  He thought my
 garden shed could really use some vinyl siding.  Ha!"

 "And what happened to him?"

 "Good question."  J. Daggett touches one of the buttons on the arm of
 his wheelchair and asks, "Harold, whatever happened to that Dwayne
 Splatz salesman guy, the one that actually made it past you?"

 Harold's response is immediate and sounds just a tad disgruntled.  "I
 believe you made him V.P. of Sales and Marketing for Winton
 International, Sir."

 J. Daggett nods.  "Ah yes, so I did.  Thank you Harold."  Looking back
 at you, he adds, "If there's anything I've learned about hiring good
 people, it's to go for initiative first."

 (You could ask him about his story, the gardener, or the
 groundskeeper, or give him the spiral notebook.)

>give notebook to daggett
 You pull the spiral notebook out of your pocket and hand it to J.
 Daggett.  "I found this um, downstairs somewhere.  I think it belongs
 to the butler."

 J. Daggett picks it up, glances at it, and slips it into his pocket.
 "Thanks.  I'll make sure Harold gets it back.  I'm having a yen for
 some of his famous Thai Red Beef Curry, and he can never remember if
 the recipe calls or one teaspoon of fish sauce, or one tablespoon."

 (You could ask him about his story, the gardener, or the
 groundskeeper.)

>ask daggett about the gardener
 J. Daggett smiles fondly at your mention of the aged gardener.  "My
 great grandfather loved the sea.  My grandfather has always preferred
 solid ground.  He just loves puttering around in the greenhouse."  His
 grin widens.  "He's also pretty good at keeping Earl on his toes."

 (You could ask him about his story, or the groundskeeper.)

>ask daggett about earl
 "I found a shirt outside that had the name Earl on it.  Is he your
 groundskeeper?"

 J. Daggett nods.  "Head groundskeeper actually.  He and his staff are
 responsible for maintaining the entire estate, and they are very, very
 good at what they do.  Normally you would have seen a few of them
 about, but today happens to be their day off."

 (You could ask him about his story.)

>ask daggett about his story
 Your original mission is complete.  You have met the great J. Daggett
 Winton and delivered your package.  But you're far from ready to just
 walk out the door.  Too many questions remain unanswered.  You decide
 it's time to take J. Daggett up on his offer.

 "You mentioned earlier that you have something important you want to
 show me, and a story to tell?"

 "Yes I do," J. Daggett replies firmly.  "If you have no further
 questions then we can be on our way.  Just follow me when you're
 ready."

 (You could ask him about his story.)

>ask daggett about his story
 J. Daggett replies, "I'm ready when you are.  Just follow me and we'll

 Study (sitting on the guest chair)
 You expected a dimly-lit chamber filled with dark leather furniture
 and smelling of single-malt scotch and cigar smoke.  You're surprised
 to discover that J. Daggett's study is light, airy, and quite modern.
 Instead of oak and mahogany the walls and bookcases are made from
 natural cherry.  Dozens of sticky-notes litter his expansive desk.  It
 is also home to two large flat-screen computer terminals and an array
 of state-of-the-art communications equipment.  Message lights flash.

 J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you
 to either follow him or ask your next question.

 J. Daggett Winton isn't important.

>ask winton about wheelchair
 J. Daggett looks thoughtful.  Finally he says, "An interesting topic
 for another time.  But for now there are more important things we need
 to discuss."

 (You could ask him about his story.)

>examine wheelchair
 J. Daggett's motorized wheelchair looks like it's much more than just
 transportation.  Judging from the array of controls and readouts built
 into the chair's arms you would guess that it also serves as his
 mobile command center.  You have no doubt he designed it himself.

 "I'm ready to go if you are."

 J. Daggett responds by touching a control on the arm of his
 wheelchair.  A motor hums to life and his desk starts to smoothly
 rotate out of the way.  At the same time, a bookshelf in the north
 wall of the study swings back to reveal a short, well lit corridor.
 The humming stops.

 Gesturing toward the opening, he says, "We'll take the back way down."

 You fall in behind his wheelchair.  The short hallway leads to another
 elevator.  This one doesn't have any visible controls; therefore you
 assume it must be operated remotely from the wheelchair.  Your guess
 is confirmed when the doors open as J. Daggett approaches, then close
 behind you.

 The descent is brief.  The elevator quickly slows to a stop and the
 doors whoosh open.  Banks of overhead lights flicker to life.  Your
 jaw drops in amazement.  You're so overwhelmed that it takes a moment
 for you to realize that J. Daggett has moved forward.  You trot after
 him.

 Artifacts Chamber
 The chamber is huge and crammed floor to ceiling with a dazzling array
 of historical artifacts.  There are Renaissance masterpieces, Grecian
 sculptures, numerous statues from the Egyptian and Roman pantheons,
 Aztec and Mayan figurines, suits of samurai armor, a troop of Emperor
 Qin Shi Huang's terra cotta soldiers, and that's just what's setting
 out around you.  Chests and packing cases are stacked everywhere.  You
 half expect to see the crated Ark of the Covenant being wheeled off in
 the distance.

 The elevator doors lie behind you to the north.  The only clear path
 you can see through the stacked crates continues southward.  Several
 rather unusual pieces near where you're standing arouse your
 curiosity.

 J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you
 to either follow him further or ask another question.

 (You could ask him about the collection, or his story.)

>examine crates
 It looks like the rumors about J. Daggett's huge collection of
 historical artifacts were true.

>examine pieces
 The word "pieces" is not necessary in this story.

>examine figurines
 It looks like the rumors about J. Daggett's huge collection of
 historical artifacts were true.

 Curious, you ask, "I noticed several rather interesting artifacts as
 we were walking along.  Mind if I ask you about them?"

 "Not at all," J. Daggett responds.  "Ask away."

 (You could ask him about his story, the pair of marble arms, the giant
 bronze thumb, or the carved limestone nose.)

>examine thumb
 The bronze thumb is something you might want to ask J. Daggett about.

>examine arms
 The marble arms are something you might want to ask J. Daggett about.

 "It's all that remains of the Colossus of Rhodes," J. Daggett sighs.
 "The rest was supposedly sold as scrap to a traveling salesman from
 Edessa.  What a sad end to a great work of art.  And don't even get me
 started on traveling salesmen!"

 (You could ask him about his story, the pair of marble arms, or the
 carved limestone nose.)

>ask daggett about nose
 "There's a rumor that Napoleon's troops shot it off for target
 practice.  Another account attributes the vandalism to Muhammad Sa'im
 al-Dahr.  He was a Sufi fanatic and supposedly did it to dissuade the
 locals from making offerings to the Sphinx in hope of increasing their
 harvest.  In any case Granddad found this piece on one of his trips to
 Giza.  It looks to me like it just broke off on its own."

 (You could ask him about his story, or the pair of marble arms.)

>ask daggett about arms
 "Ah yes, those," J. Daggett chuckles.  "I suppose I should donate them
 to the Louvre, but people these days are accustomed to seeing the
 Venus de Milo without them."

 (You could ask him about his story.)

 You look around in amazement.  "This is an incredible collection, but
 I have a feeling it's not what you wanted to show me."

 "You are correct," J. Daggett acknowledges.  "That lies just ahead.
 Follow me."

 (You could ask him about his story.)

>follow daggett
 You again fall in behind J. Daggett's wheelchair.  The path through
 the stacked crates leads to a heavy steel door.  It rolls smoothly
 upward as you approach, revealing darkness beyond.  J. Daggett
 continues a few feet inside and stops.  He motions for you to join
 him.

 J. Daggett's voice is strangely hushed.  "We have reached our
 destination.  I'm going to close the door, and when I do, it will be
 almost completely dark.  But don't worry, there's nothing in here that
 can harm you.  We need a little time for our eyes to adjust.  And
 while they do, I will tell you my story."

 Dark Chamber
 It's too dark to do anything but wait.

 You see no daggett here.

>wait
 J. Daggett begins his story.

 "The first time I met Emmeline we were on the face of a cliff.  I was
 headed up.  She was on her way down.  We stopped on a ledge for a bit
 of a chat.  I was very impressed by her skill as a climber; and when
 we met again a day later at a dinner party, I was even more impressed
 by her grace and beauty.  We continued to see each other and were
 married within six months.

 &ldquoShe was a bit overwhelmed by Seacliff at first, but it didn't
 take her long to settle in.  She charmed Harold immediately, and he
 really helped her feel at home.  She especially loved to explore the
 grounds, and she was delighted the day I showed her the entrance to
 the caves in the basement.  The cliffs around here are riddled with
 them.  Some of them go back for miles.  Exploring them together soon
 became one of our favorite activities.

 &ldquoThe day of the accident, we were headed for a large chamber we
 had named The Cathedral.  Emmeline was in an excellent mood.  I could
 tell she had some kind of good news she wanted to share with me.  The
 Cathedral was one of our favorite places to sit and talk.

 &ldquoThe only challenge along the route is a sheer descent of about
 thirty feet down a chasm wall, but we had been up and down it dozens
 of times before and we had no trouble with it that day.  We were
 almost there when Em noticed a fresh rock fall, and the new opening
 that it had exposed.  Of course, we had to see where it led."

>wait
 As you wait in the darkness, you slowly become aware of a faint blue
 glow.  It seems to be floating in the air about five feet in front of
 you.  J. Daggett continues his narrative.

 "The passage beyond opened quickly into a domed chamber.  The walls
 were polished smooth and had about a dozen small niches cut into them.
 The center of the chamber was dominated by a wide stone arch.  It was
 about twelve feet tall and covered with a strange flowing script in a
 language neither of us had seen before.  The niches were empty, save
 for one.  It contained a small silver-blue bracelet.

 &ldquoThe bracelet was metallic and heavy like gold or platinum might
 be.  The outside was polished smooth, but the inside had more of the
 same flowing script engraved around it.  There were no other exits
 from the room that we could find; and looking at that arch, we
 couldn't help but think sci-fi..."

 J. Daggett smiles slightly in memory.  "Take your pick.  Stargate?
 The Time Tunnel?  'Beam me up, Scotty?'  I stepped through it first.
 Nothing.  Em got the idea to slip on the bracelet and try it.  Still
 nothing.  Oh well.  We took a few pictures and headed back.

 &ldquoI made it through the opening without any trouble.  Em had just
 started through when the rocks gave way again."

 You continue to wait.  The blue glow looks a bit brighter now.  It
 appears to be coming from a supine human figure, probably lying on a
 platform of some kind.  The figure is feminine and completely still.
 You don't believe in ghosts.  But, could it possibly be...

 J. Daggett's voice is filled with emotion when he begins to speak
 again.
>examine glow

 "It took me almost twenty minutes of frantic digging with my hands and
 climbing axe to free her.  The rocks and loose soil hadn't crushed
 her, but they had buried her.  That much time with no air...

 &ldquoAfter that, all I could do was try to carry her body back.  I
 remember nothing of the return trip until I reached the chasm.  I was
 almost at the top when my footing gave way.  We both tumbled to the
 floor below.

 &ldquoI regained consciousness hours later.  My torch was smashed.  I
 couldn't move my legs.  I figured I would simply die where I lay.  And
 to be perfectly honest, by that time I was looking forward to doing
 just that.  I did notice a faint blue glow surrounding Em's body, but
 I was too far gone to even care what it was.  I was still holding her
 in my arms when Harold found us."

 It's still too dark to make out any detail.  You continue to wait.
 You can see the figure a bit more clearly, and you have no doubt now
 that it's Emmeline.  She's lying on some kind of table in the center
 of the room.  Her eyes are closed.  Her features are serenely
 composed.  She is still dressed in khakis and climbing boots as though
 she had walked out of the cave moments before and stretched out for a
 bit of a nap.  Her entire body is surrounded by the strange blue glow.
 She is startlingly beautiful.  You are so struck by the sight that it
 takes you a moment to realize that J. Daggett has continued his
 narrative.

 "Harold took care of everything.  Doctors, police, Em's funeral
 arrangements, all of it.  I was so deeply depressed that I didn't care
 if I lived or died.  Then about a month after the accident, Harold
 finally felt I was well enough for him to tell me that he had secretly
 arranged to have an empty casket cremated.  He too had discovered the
 blue glow.  And even stranger, he had found that it was impossible to
 penetrate.  A needle would stop microns short of actual contact.
 X-rays just bounced off.  It was as if she was encased in some kind of
 force field.  He couldn't even be sure if she was dead or alive.

 &ldquoAfter that I couldn't wait to get out of the hospital.  I had to
 know.  I put every ounce of energy and determination I had into my
 rehabilitation, but it still took me almost six months to get mobile
 again.  The only thing that made it bearable was Harold's continued
 assurance that Em's condition remained completely unchanged."

 You continue to wait.  J. Daggett pauses just long enough to turn the
 lights up a bit.

 You can now see that the entire back wall of the room is stacked with
 racks of lab instruments.  All of them are powered off.  Emmeline is
 lying in front of them on a padded exam table.  J. Daggett touches one
 of the controls on his wheelchair and all the equipment comes to life
 at the same time.  Lights flash, traces start scanning across
 monitors, computer screens display boot up sequences.  He scans the
 instruments quickly, then turns back to you.

 "As soon as I got back here I set up this lab and tried everything I
 could think of to get some kind of reading from inside the field with
 no success.  I could see her, but I couldn't touch her.  It finally
 occurred to me to try time-lapse photography.  I set it up to capture
 any hint of movement inside the field, no matter how slow or faint.
 And I found it.  A visible pulsing of the carotid artery.  One
 heartbeat every twenty-seven and a half hours.  She was alive!"

 J. Daggett leans forward.  "I knew where the field was coming from of
 course.  She hadn't removed the bracelet after walking through the
 arch, and she was still wearing it when the passage collapsed.  But it
 was inside the field with her and untouchable.

 &ldquoI've spent over two years now trying to figure out how the
 bracelet works.  It has to be generating some kind of stasis field.
 My best guess is that it's a protective device.  The falling rocks
 activated it.  But why hadn't it turned back off?  I've also had no
 luck trying to determine its origin.  The script on the arch has
 proved to be unique.  I needed to try a different approach."

 His story complete, J. Daggett sags back in his chair and fixes you
 with a steady gaze.  Finally he asks, "So, have you figured out what
 your second delivery was yet?"

 Emmeline's Chamber
 The room has been converted into a laboratory.  The entire back wall
 is stacked with racks of lab instruments.  Lights flash, traces scan
 across monitors, status messages scroll up computer screens.  Emmeline
 is lying in front of them on a padded examination table.

 An old wooden door leads west.  The chamber full of artifacts lies
 behind you to the north.  Both doors are closed.

 J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you
 to respond yes or no.

 "Yes, I believe I've figured it out.  Your research into the bracelet
 from this end has stalled.  You can't go back down into the caves and
 find the answer yourself.  You need me to do it for you.  I'm the
 second delivery."

 J. Daggett beams.  "Exactly!  I need someone who can solve problems,
 overcome obstacles, and prevail in the face of adversity.  The fact
 that you're standing here proves that you can do that, and more.  The
 only question that remains is, will you?"

 He stops your immediate response with a raised hand.  "Before you
 answer there are two additional things you should know.  The first is
 that the other two Harry Potter books on the shelf in my study were
 also delivered by highly skilled individuals.  Harry Potter and the
 Sorcerer's Stone arrived by way of an ex-Navy SEAL.  Harry Potter and
 the Chamber of Secrets was handed to me by a woman who reminded me
 very much of Emmeline herself.  Both went into the caves.  Neither has
 returned."

 You think about that for a moment before finally asking, "And the
 second thing I should know?"

 "We had both wanted children, but the doctors had told us Em couldn't.
 Just before we left the chamber containing the arch, Em told me her
 good news.  She had proved the doctors wrong.  She was going to have a
 baby."

 J. Daggett is again watching you carefully, trying to gauge your
 reaction to everything he's told you.  Finally he says, "So now you
 have to make a choice.  The entrance to the cave is through the wooden
 door to the west.  The way out is through the steel door behind you.
 If you choose it, I have misjudged you; and it is best that our
 relationship ends here.  You can pick up whatever trinket you feel
 you've earned as payment as you leave.

 &ldquoIf you choose to go on I don't need to talk about fame or
 fortune or glory because you're not motivated by them.  In that case,
 all I can say further is, 'Good luck, and Godspeed'."

 room.  Her eyes are closed.  Her features are serenely composed.  She
 is still dressed in khakis and climbing boots, as though she had
 walked out of the cave moments before and stretched out for a bit of a
 nap.  Now that the lights are on you can no longer see the strange
 blue glow that you know still surrounds her body.  She is startlingly
 beautiful.  She is lying.

>touch emmeline
 That is neither necessary or appropriate.

>go west
 You know there is only one choice you can live with: therefore, it
 really isn't a choice at all.

 J. Daggett gives you everything you might need.  Among the climbing
 gear, first aid kit, and survival rations, you are surprised to notice
 a shiny brass lantern.  Apparently your host is also something of a
 traditionalist.

 A final handshake, a last look at Emmeline, and you're on your way.
 You feel about ten-feet tall as you step through the doorway into
 darkness.

 (Oops.  You forgot to turn on the dang lantern, again.)

 (Your score has just increased by one point.)

 An old wooden door leads west.  The chamber full of artifacts lies
 behind you to the north.  Both doors are closed.

 J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you
 to respond yes or no.

 "I'm not really sure," you respond hesitantly.  "My best guess seems a
 bit..."

 "Farfetched?"  J. Daggett finishes for you.  "Think about it.  My
 research into the bracelet from this end has stalled.  I can't go back
 down there and find the answer myself.  I need someone to do it for
 me.  Someone who can solve problems, overcome obstacles, and prevail
 in the face of adversity.  In other words, someone like you."

 "So I am the second delivery then."

 "That's right," he confirms.  "The fact that you're standing here
 proves that you can do that, and more.  The only question that remains
 is, will you?"

 He stops your immediate response with a raised hand.  "Before you
 answer there are two additional things you should know.  The first is
 that the other two Harry Potter books on the shelf in my study were
 also delivered by highly skilled individuals.  Harry Potter and the
 Sorcerer's Stone arrived by way of an ex-Navy SEAL.  Harry Potter and
 the Chamber of Secrets was handed to me by a woman who reminded me
 very much of Emmeline herself.  Both went into the caves.  Neither has
 returned."

 You think about that for a moment before finally asking, "And the
 second thing I should know?"

 "We had both wanted children, but the doctors had told us Em couldn't.
 Just before we left the chamber containing the arch, Em told me her
 good news.  She had proved the doctors wrong.  She was going to have a
 baby."

 J. Daggett is again watching you carefully, trying to gauge your
 reaction to everything he's told you.  Finally he says, "So now you
 have to make a choice.  The entrance to the cave is through the wooden
 door to the west.  The way out is through the steel door behind you.
 If you choose it, I have misjudged you; and it is best that our
 relationship ends here.  You can pick up whatever trinket you feel
 you've earned as payment as you leave.

 &ldquoIf you choose to go on I don't need to talk about fame or
 fortune or glory because you're not motivated by them.  In that case,
 all I can say further is, 'Good luck, and Godspeed'."

 J.  Daggett's face is expressionless as you turn to walk out.  He
 touches the control to open the steel door, then turns his back on you
 and rolls over to sit beside his wife.  He takes her hand in his and
 bows his head.
