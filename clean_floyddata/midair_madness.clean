 Queuelty
 An Interactive Claustrophobia by Sarah Morayati
 Release 1 / Serial number 100403 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Oppressive Crowd
 People. People. So many people.

 You weren't quite sure what you were expecting. Crowds, sure, but not
 ten thousand people crammed into a tenth as many square feet until
 they ferment. They're sort of herded along by barriers and signs, but
 once you reach critical mass of a couple thousand, it just looks like
 an enormous mass. Fortunately, you made it to the end of the line.
 Unfortunately, so did Brody.

 Brody leers at you with either malice or lechery. You can't decide
 which would be worse.

>examine brody
 Brody is an asshole.

 Yes, you've been known to prematurely call people assholes before, and
 you're becoming a bit worried that you're being typecast as the sort
 of person who indiscriminately dubs people assholes. But Brody really
 is an asshole.

 Brody has painstakingly manhandled his hair into what was probably a
 mohawk at one point. You have nothing against follicular
 self-expression, except when it's going to be sitting in front of you.
 Or when each individual plume of hair has a middle finger sculpted
 into it. He's wearing a ratty old T-shirt, on which he has just
 spray-painted (you can smell it): "DEVELOPERS! ASK ME ABOUT THE
 KICK-ASS GAME IDEA THAT WILL MAKE ME A MILLIONAIRE!" (Millionaire is
 in its own special shade of blood red.

 And you would be remiss not to mention the giant sign. You came to
 this convention to meet like-minded, wonderful people who do not wave
 giant signs in your face. You instead met Brody, a non-minded,
 wonder-free personoid who quite enjoys this. Especially when said
 signs depict naked people.

>examine sign
 (the signs)
 The usual signs, listing the PAX rules, the exits, you know the drill.
 The only sign you really care about is the one that indicates that
 there's only one more seat left in the panel.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>wait
 Time passes.

>examine me
 You've always felt a bit out of place at conventions like this; you're
 not a big gamer, and you've never cosplayed in your life. And you're
 female, as much as you wish this wasn't an issue. But you love
 interactive fiction, so this was like your dream come true.

>punch brody
 The rules here tell you not to punch or kick people. More pertinently,
 they're enforced by about 100 beefy bodyguards scattered around the
 places you're not looking. Besides, the rules don't say a word about
 the magical equivalent of punching and kicking.

>cosplay
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>spells
 You are the master of the following spells:
 blorb:   The blorb spell lets you safely protect a small object, as
 though in a strongbox. You wouldn't think it was so useful, but when
 was the last time you saw a strongbox?
 cleesh:   The cleesh spell lets you change something into a small
 amphibian. It's kind of fun being a stereotypical witch out of a kid's
 TV show.
 exex:   The exex spell lets you make things and/or people go faster.
 Hence the name.
 filfre:   The filfre spell lets you create gratuitous fireworks.
 Fortunately for party hosts, it works even better when you're drunk.
 frotz:   The frotz spell allows you to cause something to give off
 light. You love this spell. No more do you have to travel by the light
 of your cell phone!
 gnusto:   The gnusto spell lets you write a spell into a spellbook.
 You, like most magicians, dislike it; you never reveal your secrets to
 the world. It's the only leg up you've got on the bastards.
 gondar:   The gondar spell lets you put out an open flame. It makes
 you pretty popular at parties.
 guncho:   The guncho spell lets you banish someone to another plane of
 existence. In theory. In practice, it does absolutely nothing for you.
 You're sure there's some crappy cop-out excuse, like this convention
 room is actually the meeting point of every possible plane of
 existence, making them geometrically -- technically -- the same plane,
 but you're pretty sure you just can't make it work.
 izyuk:   The izyuk spell lets you fly. It also works on other people,
 you guess, but when you're got a flying spell you are keeping that
 shit for yourself, OK?
 krebf:   The krebf spell lets you repair willful damage to something.
 It's made you far too careless for comfort.
 kulcad:   The kulcad spell allows you to dispel another spell. You
 love do-overs.
 melbor:   The melbor spell lets you protect a magic user from harm
 from an evil being. You've had to duck into the bathroom and cast it
 at least three times this afternoon.
 nitfol:   The nitfol spell allows you to converse with the beasts in
 their own language. It is the only reason why you have not yet been
 fired.
 ozmoo:   The ozmoo spell allows you to make something survive
 unnatural death. No, you don't know if it works in the afterlife and
 aren't keen to find out.
 rezrov:   The rezrov spell lets you open things, even locked or
 enchanted things. It works either literally or figuratively, but you
 don't like to use it literally much after you accidentally split your
 best friend's goldfish in two.
 vaxum:   The vaxum spell lets you make a hostile creature your friend.
 It is the other reason why you have not yet been fired.
 zifmia:   The zifmia spells lets you magically summon a being. Out of
 all of your spells, it is among the most likely to get you arrested.

>vaxum brody
 All of the jerkery vanishes from Brody's face. He reaches out and
 shakes your hand, and nothing else. "Oh wow! It's so great to see a
 girl at PAX." You nod. "So what are you in line for?"

 "Oh, there's this panel --"

 "The interactive fiction panel?"

 "That's the one!"

 Brody looks over at the room. Into the doors. At the single remaining
 seat. "Looks like there's only one seat," he says, voice hardening.

 "Yeah," you say flatly. "Looks like."

 "So what the fuck are you here for?" He releases a torrent of
 misogyny. Guess not even vaxum can make him nice.

>exex line
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine queue
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine line
 You can't see any such thing.

>exex me
 You hardly need to; you're sure you can outspeed Brody as it is. His
 presence is the problem here.

>exex brody
 The last thing you need is for Brody to be faster than you.

>guncho brody
>guncho brody
 As much as you'd love to guncho the hell out of Brody, it just doesn't
 work.

 As much as you'd love to guncho the hell out of Brody, it just doesn't
 work.

>guncho me
 Even if you could make guncho work, the odds that the particular plane
 of existence you'd be banished to would be the panel room are too slim
 to even contemplate.

>exex crowd
 Like you're seriously gonna do a favor for a bunch of strangers.
 They're behind you, and they haven't seen it fit to open up to you, so
 there.

>cleesh brody
 Brody is similar enough to an amphibian that it does nothing.

>rezrov crowd
 You speak the words, and all of a sudden, everything changes. The
 crowd seems so much less threatening, much less likely to trample you
 into a pulp or absorb you into its flesh.

 "Oh hey, man!" one of the attendees says. "Oh. Sorry. Hey there, uh,
 you!"

 "Madeline," you say. "Nice to meet you."

 "You too! the guy responds. "I'm sorry -- we were just so caught up in
 the line that we completely forgot there was anyone else here." He
 smiles and shakes your hand, and the cluster of people beside him
 opens up a bit, into a circle. You should rezrov your social life more
 often.

>cleesh crowd
 You can't see what your spell did, but you're sure that somewhere in
 the morass, somebody is now frantically dodging feet.

 Someone tries to summon Captain Planet from somewhere in the crowd.

 "So did you see the Street Fighter panel?"

 "Nope," you say.

 "GTA?"

 "No," you say, a bit less chirpily. You feel like something in a
 museum.

>nitfol crowd
 You speak the words, and everything changes again. (Isn't magic
 awesome?)

 "So did you ever play Photopia?"

 "I love Photopia!" you exclaim. "It's actually the only game that's
 ever made me cry."

 "Really? Me too!" a guy from the crowd exclaims. "Did you play..." And
 five minutes pass, and they are wonderful.

 You duck as someone throws a paper airplane at you.

>spells
 You are the master of the following spells:
 blorb:   The blorb spell lets you safely protect a small object, as
 though in a strongbox. You wouldn't think it was so useful, but when
 was the last time you saw a strongbox?

 all of your spells, it is among the most likely to get you arrested.

>izyuk me
 Maybe after the convention. That way you can get a refund on your
 flight.

 "So did you play Broken Legs?"

 "I loved that game!" You grin. "Like, if the author could just come to
 my home and be my personal writing slave it would be awesome. Is that
 so weird?"

 "Yeeeeeaaah," a girl -- a girl! in the crowd says after a while.
 "That's pretty weird. And there needs to be a post-comp version."

 "Oh." You hardly know what to say anymore.

>exex crowd
 You cast the spell, but there are just too many people for it to have
 any noticeable effect. PAX: its attendance is stronger than magic.

>look
 Oppressive Crowd
 You weren't quite sure what you were expecting. Crowds, sure, but not
 ten thousand people crammed into a tenth as many square feet until
 they ferment. They're sort of herded along by barriers and signs, but
 once you reach critical mass of a couple thousand, it just looks like
 an enormous mass. Fortunately, you made it to the end of the line.
 Unfortunately, so did Brody.

 A girl glares at you from the crowd -- she's glaring so hard that just
 by the scowl you can spot her. She's wearing a name tag reading
 "Elise."

 Brody leers at you with either malice or lechery. You can't decide
 which would be worse.

>vaxum crowd
 It doesn't do anything. Yay, the masses doesn't hate you!

>frotz crowd
 You cast frotz at the masses, but apparently it doesn't take; all you
 can muster is a sudden flash of bright white light. There must be some
 highly scientific explanation for this.

>filfre
 A huge plume of fireworks bursts down from the ceiling. Tens of
 thousands of gamers stand agape for a second.

>zifmia don woods
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine elise
 Just looking at Elise, you know that you are out of your element.
 There's nothing remarkable about her by sight, but somehow, she's
 managed to score the rapt attention of every teenage and
 not-so-teenage boy at PAX, and most of the girls -- in short, about
 tens of thousands of people who are absolutely infatuated with her.
 She's also glaring at you like your very existence in this line and
 potentially in this panel is a personal affront to you. You don't get
 it. Why is everyone the world makes you encounter so horrible to you?

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

>zifmia
 You'd never be able to find anything you summoned in this crowd if you
 just cast it into thin air. Normally you at least have a field of
 vision to work with.

>vaxum elise
 You speak the words, and Elise just changes. Her scowl turns to a
 smile. Her arms uncross. And all she can talk about is the games she
 loved, and why she loves them, and how hopeful she is about IF as a
 form. And she's only talking to you; it's like nobody else matters.
 And people wonder why you still do magic.

>guncho crowd
 As much as you'd love to guncho the hell out of the masses, it just
 doesn't work.

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

 You notice Elise looking down at this tattered thing. She looks so
 forlorn, too. You really want to cheer her up.

>exex elise
 Nothing obvious happens, but then, you weren't paying extensive
 attention to its speed.

>smell
 It reeks of overcrowding.

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

>krebf t-shirt
 You can't see any such thing.

>krebf tattered
 You can't see any such thing.

>rezrov elise
 You cast the rezrov spell at Elise, but it doesn't work.

>krebf elise
 You cast the krebf spell at Elise, but nothing happens. You probably
 shouldn't be so disappointed it was undamaged.

>examine elise
 Just looking at Elise, you know that you are out of your element.
 There's nothing remarkable about her by sight, but somehow, she's
 managed to score the rapt attention of every teenage and
 not-so-teenage boy at PAX, and most of the girls -- in short, about

 She's also glaring at you like your very existence in this line and
 potentially in this panel is a personal affront to you. You don't get
 it. Why is everyone the world makes you encounter so horrible to you?

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

>talk to elise
 You strike up a conversation with Elise. "So what brings you here?"

 "Well, I don't know. Seeing people talk, picking up swag, the works."
 She holds up a small leather-bound book, sort of in tatters. "Like
 this, for instance. It's supposedly real vellum, or vegan fake vellum,
 or something -- anyway, it's legit. I got it at one of the booths, and
 I'd always wanted a spellbook of my own, you know? But then some
 asshole ripped it out of my hands and tore it up." She sighs. "I
 really wanted to get back at him, too, but he just stormed off. Him
 and his stupid hair and his really stupid T-shirt." Your gaze shifts
 over to Brody for a second. Could there be more than one asshole at
 this con? Probably, yeah, but perhaps nobody quite at his level.

>rezrov crowd
 You don't really want to cast rezrov at them again. You don't mind
 them, but you don't exactly want to hear the intimate details of their
 lives either.

>guncho enforcers
 As much as you'd love to guncho the hell out of the enforcers, it just
 doesn't work.

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

>krebf book
 You speak the words. Elise looks skeptical at first -- oh damn it, did
 you undo your spell already? -- but the skepticism quickly dissolves
 once she notices what happens to your book. It's reforming, kind of
 like an ice cube freezing, And before you know it, it's as good as
 new. Possibly better.

 "Oh my God," Elise says. "How'd you do that?"

 "I know magic," you say, smiling. You try to restrain yourself from a
 huge monologue to her on the topic, but it's so hard and you kind of
 want to tell her anyway.

>tell Elise about magic
 (To talk to people in this game, use TALK TO ______. It's a Speed IF.
 Its conversational prowess is limited.)

>talk to elise
 You start to tell Elise about magic, and much to your relief, she
 doesn't immediately blow you off. You tell her about many things: the
 time you singlehandedly stopped the Irish potato famine and started
 the Revolutionary War in one fell swoop to the night you summoned up
 this delicious chicken-lobster-mango fettuccine for a date. She's
 absolutely rapt. It might sound weird, but you never knew magic could
 make your life so awesome!

 "So this spellbook. If I wanted to, I could do magic too? Because I've
 got this asshole that needs a magical ass-whooping."

 "Did he have a middle-finger mohawk?"

 "YES!" There's so much in her voice: anger, astonishment. Relief.
 "That's the one."

 "If you want to, I can teach you," you say, hardly even knowing it.
 "Just let me." She nods vigorously. Awesome! Now you just need a plan.

>plan to teach elise about magic
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>teach elise
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>izyuk elise
 You manage to make Elise hover for a few minutes, but flying's the
 sort of thing that people really need to be on board with first.

>spells
 You are the master of the following spells:

 zifmia:   The zifmia spells lets you magically summon a being. Out of

>melbor elise
 You speak the words. Nothing visible happens, but Elise just comes off
 as so much more... primed. Yeah. That's it. Primed. Primed for
 ass-of-Brody-kicking.

 "Thanks," she says, and it's almost like a one-liner."Now teach me a
 spell. Do it quickly," she adds.

 "I don't have any murder spells," you say.

 "So do you have any go-away spells, then?"

 "Actually, yes!"

 "Then just put it in here! I know you can do that, right?" Your face
 shouldn't be blanching this much.

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

>zifmia plan
 You can't see any such thing.

>guncho book
 As much as you'd love to guncho the hell out of the spellbook, it just
 doesn't work.

>gnusto book
 Nothing happens. You were never all that great at gnusto anyway.

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

>frotz guncho
 You cast frotz at guncho, but apparently it doesn't take; all you can
 muster is a sudden flash of bright white light. There must be some
 highly scientific explanation for this.

>gnusto zifmia
 Nothing happens. You were never all that great at gnusto anyway.

>gnusto guncho
 You start to speak the words, but it's no use; guncho is appearing in
 the spellbook, but one pixel at a time. Like you're on a 0.000001
 modem. It's depressing. And Elise is sighing more than you ever want
 to see her sigh. There has to be a way to speed this up.

>gnust guncho
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>gnusto elise
 Nothing happens. You were never all that great at gnusto anyway.

>exex gnusto
 Nothing obvious happens, but then, you weren't paying extensive
 attention to its speed.

>exex book
 Nothing obvious happens, but then, you weren't paying extensive
 attention to its speed.

>exex me
 You speak the words. Nothing happens that she can see, but you notice
 your brain absolutely racing. It's like the 1990s when they were
 talking about the information superhighway. Except there is one, and
 it's up in your head. Your casting probably just went up a million
 times. Like you leveled up. And it feels awesome.

>gnusto guncho
 You speak the words, and gnusto appears in the spellbook. Lightning
 fast. Like the first time you got a real Internet connection. You
 grin.

 "So is that it?" Elise says.

 "That's all," you agree.

 "Awesome," she says. "Now stand back!" Elise stomps up to Brody, who
 regards her with something between contempt and absolute confusion.
 "Yo. You. You with the stupid hair and the ridiculous T-shirt."

 "At your service," he drawls."

 "You ruined my spellbook," she says. "And from what I hear, you've
 been being a real jerk to Madeline here." She points at you. "So what
 do you have to say to that?"

 "Well, shit, I dunno," he responds. "Maybe that I don't care?
 Shouldn't you be playing like Farmville or Barbie or something?" He
 laughs. And laughs. And laughs some more.

 "No," Elise says. "Maybe I should be playing magic. Because Madeline
 knows magic. Ever consider that?" She doesn't even let him finish.
 "And now I know it too. And your ass is going down. Or should I say,
 going away. GNUSTO!"

 You'd love to say that there was this big explosion, full of flashing
 light, and gravity stopped too, and the world just completely
 collapsed in on itself. But gnusto was never that flashy. Instead,
 Brody is just gone, and Elise is standing before you. She gives you a
 hug, then a high-five. And for once, you're completely lost for words.

>look
 Oppressive Crowd
 You weren't quite sure what you were expecting. Crowds, sure, but not
 ten thousand people crammed into a tenth as many square feet until

 once you reach critical mass of a couple thousand, it just looks like
 an enormous mass. Fortunately, you made it to the end of the line.
 Unfortunately, so did Brody.

 Brody seems to have left a lamp behind.

 Elise smiles at you. You never even knew you could actually make real
 friends at these things!

>get lamp
 Taken.

>examine lamp
 It's a brass lantern. It looks eminently lightable with the right
 means.

>frotz lamp
 You speak the words. Immediately, the lamp lights up with bursts of
 bright, flashing light. You wonder why light always does that.

>read spellbook
 You really don't think it's real vellum -- the booth guy probably
 stiffed her -- but it's nevertheless kind of breathtaking. Especially
 now that it's fixed.

>read brody
 You can't see any such thing.

>frotz lamp
 There's no need; it's glowing more than you are.

 You notice somebody dressed as Link try to blitz the enforcers,
 failing miserably.

>get in seat
 You can't see any such thing.

>go north
 You head through the door, the lamp lighting your way, down the
 corridor, to your seat, into your chair. The panelists haven't even
 started yet. But once you sit down, as if magic, they do. And they say
 wonderful things, and you take in even more wonderful things, all
 about IF and its future and the amazing things that will be done in
 the future. It is all you ever wanted out of PAX.

 A week later, the glow hasn't faded. All you want to do is write
 something amazing, and get it out to the whole world, and make IF
 viable, and commercial, and artistic, and something the whole world
 can appreciate. But you also have something else. You have a
 collaborator. And, you think as Elise sits by you, nose buried in
 Inform 7 on her laptop, you've never been more hopeful about the form.

 Crying Place
 You are in your hovel, which you call the Crying Place. It makes you
 feel like crying.

 You can see a front door, a knife, a cookbook and Half a potato here.

 front door: That's fixed in place.
 knife: Taken.
 cookbook: Taken.
 Half a potato: Taken.
 xyzzy: You can't see any such thing.

 I'm not quite sure what you meant by that.

>cry
 A tear rolls down your cheek.

 The landlord pounds on the door, demanding rent. After a few seconds
 he thrusts his hand through a hole in the door, wiggling his fingers.

>take fingers
 You can't see any such thing.

>pull finger
 You can't see any such thing.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>pull hand
 That would be less than courteous.

  The landlord wiggles his fingers.
>shake hand
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 You have not learned any spells.

>examine me
 As good-looking as ever.

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 "All right, I've put me finny in the hole like you wanted. Give me
 some rent in return, ye ninny!"

>cut hand
 You slice the landlord's hand off. You hear an anguished scream, and
 rapid footsteps retreating from your cottage. You have beaten the
 landlord! But at what cost? To the landlord?

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>take hand
 Taken.

>examine hand
 You see a twitching, bloody hand.

 Crying Place
 You are in your hovel, which you call the Crying Place. It makes you
 feel like crying.

 You can see a front door here.

 It seems to be locked.

 You see nothing special about Half a potato.

 The landlord pounds on the door, demanding rent. After a few seconds
 he thrusts his hand through a hole in the door, wiggling his fingers.

>No, wait, I guess it isn't.
 That was a rhetorical question.

 Time passes.

 "All right, I've put me finny in the hole like you wanted. Give me
 some rent in return, ye ninny!"

 I only understood you as far as wanting to take inventory.

 The hand withdraws, and a moment later Half a potato is thrown back
 through the hole, followed by the return of the hand.

 "You must pay the rent!"

 It can't be possible, after the evolutionary price your kind has
 already paid to get this far.  There are thousands of them, jostling,
 vying for a few places inside.  There's a lot more of them than you,
 but even in your very short life, you've already competed successfully
 for limited resources.

 So get rid of the competition in front of you, get inside, and save a
 spot for your friends.  And be sure to keep your strength up along the
 way.  This whole process is exhausting.

 disappears in a huff of disappointment.

>stamp doorknob
 The doorknob now says "Doorknob" on it.

>stamp fillmore
 Strangely enough, you can't bring yourself to mar such a large and
 delightful portrait of thirteenth president Millard Fillmore. Maybe if
 it wasn't taking up so much of your field of vision.

>stamp me
 A tattoo of a green dragon suddenly (and painlessly) appears on your
 torso.

>stamp plate
 The plate already has a word written on it.

>stamp door
 A giant magical stamp appears, attempts to stamp the large wooden
 door, then disappears in a huff of disappointment.

>examine doorknob
 Goodness me, this suggests all sorts of possibilities.

 It seems to be dented.

>stamp hatch
 A giant magical stamp appears, attempts to stamp the stamped hatch,
 then disappears in a huff of disappointment.

>stamp bed
 The plain white sheets suddenly blossom into a complicated plaid and
 paisley pattern. This does not make the bed more inviting.

>stamp mirror
 A magical stamp appears and the blank mirror appears within the frame!

>examine mirror
 It's now a fairly ordinary mirror with an elaborately ornate frame.
 Curiously, you notice that it reflects a strange word written on the
 ceiling.

>examine word
 (the strange word)
 The word, which you can only see reflected in the mirror (creepy!) is
 CRAMP.

 Your brain is wreathed in eldritch fire!  The letters of the spell
 burn themselves into your corpus callosum, which you probably needed
 for other things.  Oh well!

>cramp doorknob
 The doorknob crumples in on itself. It's now a little smaller, and
 might fit a slightly smaller, more mysterious door.

>cramp sink
 The champed stamped pink sink shrinks in a blink.

>move chair
 You push the chair over beneath the hatchway.

>go north

 Bathroom
 You can see a cramped champed stamped pink sink and a toilet (on which
 is a book called What Have You Done For Me Philately?) here.

>take book
 You pick up the book and flip through it as you conduct your business.
 It looks like there's an article you could perhaps READ.

 Taken.

>read book
 You look up the Millard Fillmore stamp and discover that, due to a
 mix-up, several million were printed without the former president's
 nose. Because of this embarrassing faux-pas, the stamp is thus worth
 so little that being within a hundred yards of it actually reduces
 your credit score by a full ten points.

 HOWEVER, one rare proof stamp exists which contains the president's
 nose, and it highly prized by philatelists everywhere.

>score
 You have so far scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 98 turns.

>stamp book
 That might make it illegibile.

>flush toilet
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look
 Bathroom
 You can see a cramped champed stamped pink sink and a toilet here.

>champ toilet
 You wouldn't want to
>wink at pink sink
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>put knob on fillmore
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>go south

 Room 13
 The peeling wallpaper and cracking plaster inspires a distinct lack of
 confidence.  The room is both dank and dim, and the furniture inside
 the room seems crammed into a space too small to contain it.  Wan,
 watery light filters in, scattered by the skeletal fingers of a dead
 tree right outside the room. The door out of your room is to the west;
 south is a tiny kitchenette and north is the bathroom.

 An old-fashioned writing desk with a drawer in the corner is
 reasonably creepy.

 You can also see a cramped champed stamped pink sink, a stamped hatch,
 a strange word, a mirror, a stamped creepy bed, a chair, a large
 portrait of Millard Fillmore, a historic lamp and a stamped large
 wooden door here.

>stamp portrait
 Strangely enough, you can't bring yourself to mar such a large and
 delightful portrait of twenty-second president Millard Fillmore. Maybe
 if it wasn't taking up so much of your field of vision.

>stamp nose
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>cramp portrait
 The portrait shrinks down-- at first you think it has vanished, but
 then you realize it has turned into a tiny square portrait about the
 size of stamp.

 On the wall behind the portrait is a mysterious word.

>examine word
 Which do you mean, the mysterious word, the strange word or the word
 carved into the wood?

>mysterious
 The word is RAMP.

 Your brain is wreathed in eldritch fire!  The letters of the spell
 burn themselves into your pons medulla, which you probably needed for
 other things.  Oh well!

>stamp portrait
 A magical stamp appears and stamps the stamp. As it dissolves, you see
 that the image of seventeenth president Millard Fillmore now has a
 nose.

>cramp lamp
 The lamp shudders slightly, but utterly fails to reduce in size.

>ramp me
 You lifts a foot or so off the floor.

>ramp chair
 The chair lifts a foot or so off the floor.

>ramp hatch
>stand on chair
 A waft of pot smoke floats out of the hatch, but otherwise nothing
 happens.

 You stand on the chair, and get much closer to the hatchway.

>open hatch
 The hatch is bolted on.

>ramp lamp
 The lamp utterly fails to rise into the air, and seems to resent your
 interference.

>cramp hatch
 The stamped hatch gets a little bit smaller.

>ramp hatch
 A waft of pot smoke floats out of the hatch, but otherwise nothing
 happens.

>lamp lamp
 You have to get something before you can lamp it.

>champ hatch
 You rip the hatch open with your super strength!

>lamp get
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>lamp me
 You have to get something before you can lamp it.

>turn on lamp
 That's funny, it doesn't seem to switch on... without magic.

>examine hatch
 A mysterious hatchway which looks very much like something you would
 like to open and then enter.

 It seems to be dented.

>go up
 The tunnel is too small for you to enter with your freakishly enlarged
 muscles.

>cramp me
 You shrink down to a smaller but still agreeable size.

>go up
 With a mighty heave, you pull yourself upwards and into the tunnel.

 Tunnel
 You can see a cramped champed stamped hatch and the time machine here.

>examine time machine
 You know it's a time machine because of the engraving on it that reads
 "Time Machine." There is a large red button marked "Future."

 The time machine is currently switched off.

>turn on time machine
 In a flash of actinic light, you zap your way into...

 Front of the Queue
 You are standing near a desk. Stretching off to the south into a
 nearly infinite grey distance is an twisty line of little
 time-travelers, all alike.

 Sitting behind the desk is a gentleman whose name tag identifies him
 as "Phillippe Lampe."

>examine lampe
 You see nothing special about Phillippe Lampe.

>ask lampe about me
 Just say TALK PERSON. No TO. We didn't have time to get to the TO.

>talk lampe
 "Back of the line," says Lampe, pointing south. When you look
 confused, he says "All time travellers who ever pushed the button
 throughout history ended up here, in The Future. We don't have room
 for you all, so we're sending you back to evenly distributed points of
 history. We're giving the best times out first, so better get a spot
 in line fast."

>get lamp
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>get lampe
 "Get your hands off me!" Lampe says. "I'm fixed in place!"

>enter line
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>get spot
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

 Queue Maze
 You are in a time-traveling twist of little liners, all alike.

 Bored queuers wait listlessly.

>wait
 Time passes.

>cramp line
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>cramp queue
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>cramp queuers
 The queuers gets a little bit smaller.

>champ queuers
 With great strength, you heft the cramped champed queuers above your
 head.

>go north

 Queue Maze
 You are in a little line of twisty time-travelers, all alike.

 Bored queuers wait listlessly.

>go north

 Queue Maze
 You are in a line of twisty little time-travelers, all alike.

 Bored queuers wait listlessly.

>ramp queuers
 The cramped champed queuers lifts a foot or so off the floor.

 You overhear one of the queuers asking another "So what are your
 favorite spells?"

 "Well, I'm partial to DAMP," she responds. "And also VAMP, CLAMP, and
 CAMP. TAMP is useful when gardening, I find."

 "Indeed," says the first. "And also LIMP."

 "No, I hate limp," she says. "I use GRAMP instead."

 Your brain explodes in a fiery paroxysm of magic. Too much strain on
 the ol" medula oblangata, apparently. You pass out.

 When you wake up, it seems as if you are at the end of the line, and
 only a few of your SPELLS have stuck around.

 End of the Line
 The line stretches off into infinity to the north.

 A large sign reading "Line" is nearby, pointing off into the misty
 distance.

>spells
 You have learned the spells: stampgramp.

 You can't go that way.

>examine line
 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>examine sign
 You see nothing special about the large sign.

 The large sign withers and seems suddenly much older.

>gramp me
 cramped ramped You withers and seems suddenly much older.

 A magical stamp appears and adds the words "Front Of" to the start of
 the sign.

 After a few moments, Phillippe Lampe appears and sets up his desk. He
 looks up at you and says "Next?"

>vamp me
 You don't know that spell.

>talk to lampe
 Just say TALK PERSON. We really didn't have time to implement TO.

>talk lampe
 "I'm only one day away from retirement," Phillippe Lampe says. "Once
 I'm retired I can spend all my days searching for that elusive antique
 Millard Fillmore stamp I've always lusted after."

>gramp lampe
>stamp lampe
 Phillippe Lampe withers and seems suddenly much older.

 A giant magical stamp appears, attempts to stamp gramped Phillippe
 Lampe, then disappears in a huff of disappointment.

 You are carrying:
   a tiny portrait of thirteenth president Millard Fillmore
   a stamped book called What Have You Done For Me Philately?
   a champed stamped empty plate
   a cramped champed stamped doorknob

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a tiny portrait of seventeenth president Millard Fillmore
   a stamped book called What Have You Done For Me Philately?
   a champed stamped empty plate
   a cramped champed stamped doorknob

 The tiny portrait ages and yellows until it looks very old indeed.

 A magical stamp appears and stamps the stamp. As it dissolves, you see
 that the image of twenty-second president Millard Fillmore now has a
 nose.

>give portrait to lampe
 Lampe's eyes widen in delight. "It's the rare stamp feature third
 president Millard Fillmore!" he exclaims. "This is just what I've
 always wanted!" In a flash of joy, he quickly presses a button to send
 you back in time, destintation unknown, in an actinicer flash....

 In the Midst of the Irish Potato Famine, 1843
 A hotel that looks as if it might one day be creepy is being built in
 the midst of the blight.

 You can also see a wizard, a field of blighted potatoes, a brand new
 lamp and an inattentive nun here.

 Just say TALK PERSON. We really didn't have time to implement TO.

>talk nun
 Actually, you usually find conversation to be overrated.

>examine nun
 You see nothing inattentive about the special nun.

>examine nun
 You see nothing inattentive about the special nun.

>talk potatoes
 You can only do that to something animate.

 (first taking the field of blighted potatoes)
 That's fixed in place.

>take all
 wizard: I don't suppose the wizard would care for that.
 field of blighted potatoes: That's fixed in place.
 under construction hotel: That's fixed in place.
 brand new lamp: Taken. (Nice!)
 inattentive nun: I don't suppose the inattentive nun would care for
 that.

>talk wizard
 The wizard speaks, in an Irish brogue, "Time travelers from the
 future! Just as I predicted!" He grips you by the collar and shouts
 "It is vitally important that I teach copious amounts of magic spells
 so you can save the past!"

 Your brain shuts down in abject terror. The wizards softens, and says
 "Alright, alright, just one spell then. LAMP. It will light the way.
>examine wizard
 Use it wisely, my son."

 The wizard casts DAMP and disappears in a puff of moist air.

 You can't see any such thing (probably because you misspelled it).

>lamp
 What do you want to lamp?

>lamp me
 You have to get something before you can lamp it.

>lamp lamp
 You lamp the lamp. The lamp lights up, and in the actinicest flash of
 all, you magically rematerialize in your hotel room.

 The door swings open. You resolve to find a less creepy hotel.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 A train ride led to a taxi ride, which lead to a ride in the cleanest
 elevator you've ever seen, and ended with you here, in a plane over
 plains.  The Great Plains, to be exact, heading east in a private jet
 owned by your eccentric Uncle Doug.

 Now, after spending what seemed like hours watching a collection of
 even more eccentric talking people in the in-flight movie (something
 named "GET LAMP"), you find yourself wondering how a jet traveling
 near the speed of sound could be so completely silent.

 Rear Cabin
 The aft end of the aircraft.  The cabin continues foreward, which,
 based on the direction of travel, is also east.

 A small storage box is tucked away under one of the seats.

>examine plane
 A very nice personal jet plane.  Looking through the windows, you can
 notice that the landscape far below you is not moving.  In fact the
 engines are not even spinning, explaining the eerie silence.  It seems
 that the jet is simply stuck stationary in midair, tens of thousands
 of feet above the ground.

>go east
>go east

 Forward Cabin
 The fore end of the aircraft.  The cabin continues aft, which, based
 on the direction of travel, is also west.

 You can see a refrigerator (which is closed) here.


 Cockpit
 The oddly empty cockpit is completely devoid of controls.  Only a
 solitary label reads "Autopilot", and a red light is blinking madly
 beneath it.

 Uncle Doug is standing here, looking out the windows nervously.

 You can also see a black box (in which are a tray (which is empty) and
 a socket (which is empty)) and a mechanical mouse here.

 "I had to turn off the engines and cast an Anti-Gravity spell to keep

 like the Revolutionary War and the Irish Potato Famine had a crazy
 loony baby and that baby made crazy baby poop all over the place!
 Who's going to clean up the crazy revolutionary potato baby poop?  Not
 me, that's for sure!"
 Perhaps the high altitude is having a bad effect on Uncle Doug.

 each labeled "first", "second", and "third".

 introduce you to a very clever relative of mine..."

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You just had to play it safe, didn't you? You had to build your
 bunker-buster resistant bunker, save up years of canned fettucini and
 bottled water, and stow yourself a hundred feet underground. Now why
 did you go and do all that without giving yourself something to do for
 the next 30 years? It's only been two hours and you're bored out of
 your mind.

 But the worst part is that you forgot your spellbook, and you're going
 through a major case of magic withdrawl right now. God, how could you
 forget such a thing? At least you remember some of your spells.

 Safehouse
 An Interactive Fiction by Benjamin Sokal
 Release 1 / Serial number 100327 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)

 Safehouse
 Your safehouse is truly a feng-shui nightmare come true. Mother
 screamed and fainted when she first saw the thing. You prefer to think
 about your safehouse as a collection of objects so as not to be thrown
 off kilter by the arrangement: Your suped up Apple iie computer forms
 the centerpiece of the room. An arrangement of cans are stacked
 against the wall, forming a pyramid.

>examine cans
 Yum. Too bad you forgot your can opener.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   some mangoes

>examine computer
 You call it "your precious". It is currently off.

>examine me
 Your name is Jones. You enjoy video games, 80s movies, and long walks
 on the beach.

>spells
 You are the master of the following spells:
 frotz:   The frotz spell causes spherical objects to quiver.
 gnusto:   The gnusto spell causes great gusts of wind.
 nitfol:   The nitfol spell does something completely different.
 power up:   The power up spell is used exclusively to power up Apple
 computers built in 1983 or 1984.

>power up computer
 The computer beeps and begins to power up. Suddenly you are thrown
 upwards against the ceiling. As your face is about to meet the cold
 wet stone, you have just enough time to chastise yourself for powering
 up the computer without removing the gravity reversal spell from it.
 You also notice that the computer hits the ceiling at exactly the same
 time (thank you Galileo Galilei), and as the computer crashes into the
 ceiling the enchantment is broken. You plummet back down to the
 ground.

>nitfol computer

 There's no power to it and nowhere to plug it in. You usually just

>power up computer
 The computer beeps and begins to power up. Suddenly you are thrown
 upwards against the ceiling. As your face is about to meet the cold
 wet stone, you have just enough time to chastise yourself for powering
 up the computer without removing the gravity reversal spell from it.
 You also notice that the computer hits the ceiling at exactly the same
 time (thank you Galileo Galilei), and as the computer crashes into the
 ceiling the enchantment is broken. You plummet back down to the
 ground.

 Yes, yes, this spell would solve ALL your problems. Unfortunately it
 is very hard to pronounce correctly. Most people simply guess, with
 the result being pretty random depending on the spellcaster's
 environment. You know what the spell really does when worked properly.
 Of course, you could could give it a try even without your

 chin. "Vous ?tes qui?" The revolutionary officer asks.

 Shit.

>frotz portal
 The gateway quivers, then comes to a rest.

>enter portal
 As you enter the portal, you smell diesel fuel. When you find yourself
 in the middle of a bustling airplane terminal, it makes sense. Taxis
 beep their horns outside and a plane takes off somewhere in the
 distance. An elevator behind you beeps and then opens, revealing a
 very brightly chap and a poodle who is dressed as a train. A queue of
 people snake all around you in a nearly random fashion. The bright man
 and his poodle plunge straight into the middle of one of the lines.
 Someone starts to complain but then the poodle bares her teeth,
 quieting them. You follow the man and his poodle, trying to make it
 appear you know where you're going.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 There is an actinic flash. The seat belt signs illuminate. On the
 overhead speakers, the pilot mechanically reassures the passengers
 that the minor turbulence is no cause for concern. A second, more
 abrupt crash and the plane lurches. Air masks drop. An overhead
 baggage bin flies open, and lobsters pour out. Ignoring the passengers
 in your section, you let the food cart topple forward, the potatoes au
 gratin mixing with the fettuccine and mango compote. You climb towards
 the lavatory and throw the latch from "vacant" to "occupied." The
 plane revolves slowly -- pushing you towards the wall -- even as the
 sudden loss of altitude makes you feel lighter.

 Lobsters On A Plane
 Parboiled crustaceans at 30,000 feet by Ben and Jack
 Release 3 / Serial number 100403 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N) SD
 Type "help" for instructions.

 Lavatory
 A claustrophobic vertical coffin, lit by blue-tinted fluorescent bulbs
 and smelling of disinfectant. A uselessly small vestigial sink, a
 unisex toilet, and a mirror are the only furnishings in the room. Your
 uncanny (yet invariably useful) sense of direction tells you that the
 aft compartment of the plane is to the west.

 You can see a bathroom door and a sink (empty) here.

>examine me
 Four-hundred and eighty-six years, and you look like a supermodel.
 That's partly due to your inherently superior breeding, and partly
 attributable to the plastic surgery, cybernetic implants and magical
 enhancements all courtesy of The Republic.

 You almost slip as the plane pulls up suddenly. Good thing you had the
 mango compote for lunch and not the fettucine.

>help
 You make the sigil in the air with your wand... but nothing happens.
 It's like there is no resistance at all in the ethereal fabric. You
 are cut off. On your own.

 Except for the carnivorous lobsters.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a pair of high-heeled shoes (being worn)
   a flight attendant uniform (being worn)
   a magic wand

>examine shoes
 Shiny, high-heeled shoes. Part of the TRANSGLOBAL AIRLINES uniform.
 Your least favorite part.

>examine uniform
 A dark blue pants suit, with smart, military-style epaulets, a stripe
 down each sleeve, and gold embroidery on the cuffs. A pair of silver
 wings is pinned to your left breast, just below your name tag. The
 pressed, pleated pants continue the faux-military look. You are
 surprised that TRANSGLOBAL AIRLINES spent so much time and effort on
 designing the uniforms and so little effort verifying your identity
 before handing it over to you.

 Above the chaos in the plane's cabin, you can just make out the
 automated message, "Please turn off all electronic devices including
 cell phones and two-way pagers. The flight crew will instruct...

 It's got my eye! My eye! I can't see! Get it off me! Get it off me!

 ...thank you for complying with these regulations, which contribute to
 everyone's safety." The rest is lost in the screaming.

>examine wand
 Your wand is a mid-19th century Celtic model, passed down to you on
 your Father's side (who used it to conjure food during the great Irish
 Potato Famine). It appears to be broken in the disaster, though;
 you'll have to take a second look.

 You hear the sound of metal scraping against metal.

>examine wand

 From the cabin you hear someone trying to reason with a carnivorous
 lobster.

>look
 Lavatory
 A tight, poorly lit, aircraft bathroom. Ordinarily, a welcome refuge
 from the demanding mortal customers who need to use planes to move
 from one place to another, but now a safe haven from the carnivorous
 lobsters infesting the plane. The mirror, toilet, paper roll, and
 smoke detector are unremarkable. Your uncanny (yet invariably useful)
 sense of direction tells you that the aft compartment of the plane is
 to the west.

 You can see a bathroom door and a sink (empty) here.

>examine sink
 A small metal bowl with two knobs, marked "hot" and "cold", and a
 faucet. The sink is bone dry.

 There is a plaintive whine from the motors that are supposed to lower
 the landing gears. Back when the plane had landing gears.

>use wand on sink
 The wand glows with energy as you flick it... and you witness the PUSH
 spell, which sends things to limbo.

 The sink suddenly blinks out of existence!

 The plane whips back and forth, as if the rudder controls are no
 longer working properly.

 You hear a strange tingling sound; a large cod fish suddenly
 materializes.

>get fish
 You can't see any such thing.

>get cod
 You're sure it would snap your fingers off if you tried!

>examine cod
 A three-foot long, reddish-brown predatory fish. You guess it weighs
 at least 25 pounds, and it appears fairly mean and hungry. Crustaceans
 are its main food. It is not happy to be out of the water.

>open door
 You rattle the door, but it won't open.

>unlock door
 What do you want to unlock the bathroom door with?

>push door
 The door doesn't fold that way.

>pull latch
 You yank back and forth on the latch, when you realize that what you
 really want to do is just open or close it. Clearly, your mind is too
 powerful for the trivial devices that clutter the meaningless
 existence of mortals.

>open latch
 The latch slips to the side.

 The plane whips back and forth, as if the rudder controls are no
 longer working properly.

 sloping floor. Your shoes may be fashionable, but are not very
 functional when it comes to airplane disasters.

 You take off the high-heeled shoes.

 You're not wearing those.

 You are thrown against the wall as the plane pitches over violently.
 The harried passengers are whipped to an ever more desperate state of
 alarm.

>go east
 You can't go that way.

>go west

 Tail Section
 A cramped storage section in the rear of the plane, where, if you
 remember correctly, some emergency supplies are supposed to be stored.
 The floor slopes upward to the economy section. The emergency escape
 hatch is inset into the wall.

 You can see a bathroom door and an equipment bin (closed) here.

 The plane slams into the ocean, skipping like a rock, before sinking
 like one.

 The aft section of the plane pitches downward, flipping you sideways.
 Water jets into the cabin from seams that are not as tight as you had
 hoped. Moments later, you are ankle-deep in frigid salt water.

 Snap, crackle, pop!  The big ones are molting.  And advancing.

>use wand on me
 The wand glows with energy as you flick it... and you quickly
 recognize the FREEZE spell, which magically holds things fixed in
 place.

 Luckily, every novice mage learns to repel this effect in first year
 of academy. The energy dissipates around you.
 A bolt of icy-blue lightning shoots from the wand towards yourself,
 freezing him instantly.

 Why lobsters? Why now? It's too much for one Guardian to handle.

 Like there is ever a good time for lobsters...

>use wand on wand
 Your hand tingles as the wand's self-referential recursion dampener
 sucks the spell back in before it can affect the very wand that cast
 it.

 Lobsters scuttle along the aisle, between seats, provoking screams of
 fear from the crash survivors.

 How clich?d. This may have worked back in the day, but come on.
 Carnivorous lobsters? Have they no decency? You conclude that they are
 called the "Forces of Banality" for a good reason.

 Before the magical attack, you had worked your way through most of the
 economy and business class, but still hadn't located High Wizard
 Meretzky. You had assumed that he would not be so obvious as to fly
 first class, but this is not a good day for your assumptions.

 Two years of deep cover as a stewardess. A bloody stewardess! Waiting

 Tail Section
 A cramped storage section in the rear of the plane, where, if you
 remember correctly, some emergency supplies are supposed to be stored.
 The floor slopes upward to the economy section. The emergency escape
 hatch is inset into the wall.

 You can see a cod, a twinkie, a bathroom door, and an equipment bin
 (in which is a memo) here.

 A sturdy curved door mounted on heavy internal hinges. For emergency
 use only, as it says.

 You mumble to yourself.  How did the Forces of Banality located this
 plane so quickly?  This is definitely above your pay grade.

>go up

 Economy
 Row after row of tightly packed seats, with minimal padding, sharp
 corners, and ratty seat belts. Back in the day, these seats would have
 come with heavy oars and leg irons. Well, nostalgia will have to wait.
 You have a plane full of lobsters to deal with, and a High Wizard to
 find.   A movie screen swings above one seat;  a closed overhead
 compartment limits the headroom in this section.  Various half-eaten
 corpses of economy passengers lay strewn about, with crustaceans
 crawling over many of them.

 Over in seat 31A, a schoolmarm-ish woman is attemping to scream in
 agony, but is too exhausted to make a sound.

 You can also see a spiny lobster and a cart here.

 You hear a strange tingling sound; a large cod fish suddenly
 materializes. The cod looks the spiny lobster over, and decides that
 its spiky carapace would not be a pleasant chew. In a suprisingly low
 and rich baritone, the cod says to you, "I can take care of some of
 the smaller ones -- I'm sure you can handle this one." Before you can
 fret, he swims under the seats in search of dinner.

 A wave of nausea hits you;  the smell of human blood and melted
 butter.

 A three-foot long spiny lobster gnaws on the schoolmarm's shoulder
 with wild abandon.

 You invoke the mighty power of Earl Scruggs, and rein the instrument

 crunches mightily, reverberating through the exquistitely crafted
 walnut-and-chrome resonator.  The banjo is now in pieces, but so is
 the spiny lobster.  The lobster vaporizes into a magical haze.

 A stainless steel compartment between the self-absorbed slobs in

 Business
 Rows of seats that are spaced the way economy seats used to be spaced
 about five years ago. It is enough to make the gullible mortals feel
 superior to those in economy, while still stripping them subtly of
 their humanity. It is your favorite section of the plane.

 Northward, a narrow, staircase spirals toward to the first class
 section. Just above the business class is the bulkhead that leads to
 the cockpit.

 And clearly the vast mass of hungry lobsters have decided to make a
 final stand against you here.   They stop their flesh-feeding, teem
 and swarm, then all spin around to face you.  They take up battle
 positions along the central aisle.  You have no idea how you're going
 to get past the lobster mob.

 The lobster mob pulsates and wiggles threateningly at you, claws at
 the ready.

 You can also see a staircase and a closed bulkhead here.

 Out of nowhere, a cod suddenly appears!

 Fedora-brimmed lobster mobsters snear at the lone cod, like bullies on
 a playgroud. The mob boss, a three-and-a-half pounder with only one
 claw, steps forward, gesturing wildly with the Gl?ck in his good claw.

 "Well," he taunts, "if it ain't the natural enemy of the lobster,
 Gadus morhua, the Atlantic Cod." At the mention of his taxonomic
 classification, some of the younger lobsters looks worried, their
 antennae flitting back and forth in concern. The boss continues
 brashly, "Boys, I think tonight's main dish is... sushi!

 The boss looks back at his mob, and there is a murmur of agreement.
 Before the boss is done gloating, however, the  fish pulls a modified
 Kalashnikov assault rifle from its bulky trenchcoat.

 One of the hench-lobsters barely has time to say, "Boss, watch out for
 the cod piece!" before the silver-scaled avenger lets loose with a
 barrage of phosphor-tipped rounds, which both cook and mince the
 lobster meat into a tasty salad. The passengers in the business
 section, who are used to such things, merely assume it is the inflight
 meal, and quickly polish off the remains of the former gang.

 The cod, having rebalanced the karmic forces of the universe, happily
 blinks out of existence.

 You hear the clickety-clack of angry claws somewhere nearby.

 are the most senior member of the crew, and you're not even a real

>go north
 As you climb sideways into the First Class cabin, you are not
 surprised by the sight of its sole occupant: an unusually tall man in
 flamboyant chartreuse robes. He stands paradoxically upright despite
 the steep tilt of the deck. With an effortless wave of one hand, he
 dispels an attacking Arch Grue.

 Stunned by the realization that you are mere feet from High Wizard
 Steve Meretzky (on a carnivorous lobster-infested sinking plane), you
 are momentarily speechless.

>talk to meretzky
 The great wizard pauses a moment from smiting the lobsters near his
 ankles and takes notice of you for the first time.

 Fixed in his intense gaze, you stutter, "High Wizard Meretzky, your
 honor," your voice slips up an octave, and you hope you don't come
 across as too much of a fangirl. You make an effort to slow down and
 appear dignified, "I was sent by the Republic to see that you reach
 the Summit safely."

 Meretzky appears amused, "Yeah? And how's that going?" He deftly
 flicks his wand and the giant lobster that was sneaking up on you
 disappears in a puff of smoke. Becoming more serious, he explains,
 "I'm afraid we're surrounded by an antimagic shell. Not even I am
 powerful enough to penetrate it. Our only hope is to get a message out
 to the Republic... You lead, I'll take up the rear. You can never be
 too careful with grues and lobsters, you know."

>go south
 The High Wizard follows you silently.

>go up
 You burst into the cockpit, and Steve follows close behind you, laying
 down some magical suppressing fire with his wand. Shards of chitin fly
 through the air.

 You scan the control panel for anything that looks like a radio, but
 you are just not familiar with mortal technology. Steve sees your
 confusion and reaches over to a side panel, flipping a switch marked
 "IF Filter". There is a burst of static.

 The High Wizard points to the panel and says, "It should work now.
 Press the orange button to transmit. It won't help though," he remarks
 with a sigh, "it would take incredible power to penetrate the magical
 barrier around this plane. I'm sorry to say that beings that powerful
 have not existed since the Early Times. Not to put a damper on things,
 but -- we're doomed." With a hint of resignation, he adds, "well, at
 least you can say good-bye."

 and that help is on the way.

 Before you can protest the direness of your situation, a whirling
 vortex of photopian colors forms in the cockpit. For once, High Wizard
 Meretzky himself is taken by surprise, and stares in amazement as the
 vortex enlarges to fill the flight deck to your west. He whispers,
 "That's impossible..." A strong wind whips papers around and the air
 crackles with electricity.

>go west
 Whirling Vortex
 The undulating spiral walls of the vortex rotate hypnotically, drawing
 you in. It crackles with actinic lightning flashes.

 At the far end of the tunnel a great figure holds the vortex open, his
 hands held above his head like Moses parting the Red Sea. His
 salt-and-pepper ponytail flaps behind him in arising maelstrom. You
 have only heard tell of him in legends, but there is no doubt in your
 mind that the figure is none other than Don Woods, one of the Fathers
 of the Genre.

 Even with his great power, Woods is struggling to hold the portal
 open. In each of his mighty fists, he has gathered bundles of ethernet
 cords, which lead away in every direction. Woods calls upon the power
 of the Internet itself, tapping into the raw flow of energy from the
 IFwiki, IFDb, IFMud, and Baf's guide, Brass Lantern, and R.A.I.F.  He
 reaches out through the thousands of works of interactive fiction in
 the repository, all the way back the original Adventure. He draws on
 the pleasure and sense of challenge felt by the millions who have ever
 played a text adventure, and channels it into the whirling vortex. As
 sweat pours from his brow, he beckons you forward.

>go west
 Tube
 An extradimensional wormhole which snakes back and forth chaotically.
 It connects the cockpit of the plane somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean
 with the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, Massachusetts. The end of
 the tube leading back to the plane is shrinking.

 Don Woods strains to maintain the wormhole through time and space.

>go west
 Hynes Convention Center
 A large conference room, full of IF Fans and authors.

 As you emerge from the Vortex and step into the Hynes Convention
 Center, The Forces of Banality attack in unison. High Wizards Lebling,
 Moriarity and Meretzky reflexively move to equilateral positions
 around the gathering. The energy flows between them once more,
 creating a Trinity barrier between the IF community and the hordes of
 shambling Farmvillains.

 Market Forces conspire to bring down the defenses, but David Cornelson
 casts Textfyre Balls at them, driving them off.

 In the midst of it all, Zarf casts the elaborate Glkian Ritual of
 Unity (a ritual that, truth be told, no one else understands quite so
 well). Around him, people in the crowd hold each others' hands,
 contributing power to his spell. One word is repeated over and over,
 quietly at first, but soon building to a thunderous roar. Finally, the
 word can no longer be restrained. It breaks loose and reverberates,
 filling the room, and then flooding outward in every direction. It is
 an ancient word, of great power, the oldest of the spells: "xyzzy!"

 Banality is banished. The community is saved.

 And thus begins the Third Age of Interactive Fiction.

 Jason Scott, dressed in fine Victorian regalia, waves his hand and a
 silence falls over the crowd. The lights in the room fade, and you
 barely catch sight of a metallic glint before you are enveloped by

 It is pitch dark. The audience eagerly awaits the premier of a

 Taken.

 You are transported to a place of brightness and comraderie.

 Room 2305
 A room full of people who you have known from emails, usenet posts,
 forum discussions, chats on the IFmud, and of course, through their
 games. There are pockets of discussion about text adventures played in
 the past, and interactive fiction to be written in the future. The
 overall impression is one of warmth and welcomeness.

 On the desk is a laptop.

>get lamp

>examine laptop
 A plain black laptop, its keys polished smooth with use. On the
 screen, a text adventure awaits you.

>play text adventure
 You can't see any such thing.

>use laptop

>play game
 You can't see any such thing.

>play game

>read laptop
 The laptop screen looks odd -- smaller and smaller echoes of itself
 trailing off into the distance.

 The game banner prints. It's odd name (something about lobsters) is
 typical of hastily written speedIF. Still, it might be worth playing.

 You decide to give it the benefit of the doubt and start typing in
 commmands. Friends gather around you to see what you are doing, making
 occassional comments as you trip over your high-heels and learn to use
 your wand.

 Congratulations, player. You are home.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 PAX East, your first ever gaming convention!
 You've been psyched about this for months, and now here you are.  Wow.

 Granted, things didn't exactly get off to the best start... you showed
 up promptly at 2:00 (that's when they said the doors would open), but
 even at that point the queue was winding its way down three flights of
 stairs, out the front door, and a good ways down the block.  Needless
 to say, you didn't end up getting in to see Wil Wheaton give his
 keynote address, and you didn't end up with a wristband for the MC
 Frontalot concert.

 Oh well.  At least there won't be much competition to get into the
 5:30 panel on Storytelling in the World of Interactive Fiction...

 Vortex 2305
 A PAXeast Speed IF by Jacqueline A. Lott
 Release 3 / Serial number 100327 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)
 A creation conceived in the People's Republik of Interactive Fiction,
 within a stone's throw of PAX East, March 27, 2010.

 The Handheld Lounge
 The "Handheld Lounge" (as it's labeled on your map) is just a long
 hallway, really.  There are bean bag bed things lining one side, upon
 which recline a variety of geeks.  Along the other side of the
 corridor is a line of queueing people... Gosh, what all those folks
 are in line to see?

 "Excuse me," you say to a random dude wearing one of the red ENFORCER
 t-shirts which helps him stand out as a PAX East volunteer. "What're
 all these people lining up for?"

 "Um, Storytelling in Interactive Fiction." he replies.

 You feel some slight resistance from your fake beard as your jaw
 practically hits the floor... all these people are in line for the IF
 panel?  Like, for reals?

>inventory
 You are carrying:
   a wizardhat (being worn)
   a fakebeard (being worn)
   a cloak (being worn)

>examine hat
 It's a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs.

>examine fakebeard
 It's a long, stringy, unkempt (and fake) beard.

>examine cloak
 It's a long cloak, just like the one worn by the Wizard of Frobozz.

>in
 Leave?  Don't give up, get in line!

>cast magic missile at darkness
 I don't know that spell.

>get in line
 The Handheld Lounge (in the great big line)
 Okay, you're in the line.  Little good it'll do you, though.  Doesn't
 look like you have a prayer of getting in to enjoy this panel
 discussion.

>get in line
 That's not something you can enter.

>examine line
 You're in the line to nowhere, probably.

 A sexy, tall chick in tight leather pants suddenly walks up to you.
 She is unlike any of the mere mortals in the line with you.  Her skin
 glows actinically. Her hair is thick, flowing over her shoulders and
 down her back like glorious strands of ebony-colored fettuccine.
 "Greetings, my brave wizard," she says to you, nodding in appreciation
 of your wardrobe choices.  "I honor your courage in having made the
 journey here.  You have travelled from afar, braving jetlag to join us
 for the time of reckoning.  The rest of the gaming community will come
 to appreciate the glory of interactive fiction... and you shall be a
 part of that."

 "Bu... but... the line!  I'll never make it to the head of the queue.
 It all begins here, and I haven't a prayer of getting in."

 She leans down, her lobster red lips only inches from your own, and
 for a moment you find it difficult to breathe... but then you do
 breathe, and you think you can smell mango on her breath.  "Hush,
 handsome sorcerer," she says.  "You are in Boston.  Has not Boston
 been the site of many adversities?  When America desired freedom, was
 Boston not the site of so many events that led up to the historic
 break from Britain? When the people of Ireland suffered from famine,
 was it not Boston who took in the hungry, and filled them with hope
 and determination?"  Her gaze seems to penetrate into your very soul,
 and you are unable to speak.  "Yes," she continues, "And so too shall
 Boston be the site where the greater world rediscovered interactive
 fiction.  And you, my dear wizard, you shall be a part of that.  Take
 this evening."

 The mysterious woman hads you a slip of paper, then floats off down
 the hallway, a lightness in her step that seems to defy gravity.

>pray
 Having abandoned church for gaming long ago, nothing useful results
 from your prayer.

>examine paper
 It's a small piece of parchment, upon which is written a single word:
 XYZZY.  You knew of the word, of course, knew it to be a word of
 power, but now, in reading it, you are imbued with new knowledge.

 Perhaps you'll make that Storytelling in Interactive Fiction panel
 after all.

>xyzzy
 At the mere thougt of uttering the word aloud, a power begins to flow
 through you. "XYZZY!" you cry, and you are suddenly transported...








 This is it!  The panel!  You settle in to a chair in the front row,
 and a delighted to watch the room fill to capacity... so many people
 interested in interactive fiction... who knew?

 The speakers arrive, the panel begins, and it turns out to be the
 beinning of what turns out to be an amazing, unbelievable weekend.
 You are swept away in the vortex of rediscovery, find yourself
 immersed in many thought-provoking and inspiring conversations in the
 IF Hospitality Suite in room 2305 of the Hilton.  Even when you return
 to your Real Life, the wizard garb neatly tucked away, you keep a bit
 of that empowerment within you, and begin churning out miniepisodic IF
 that generates enough income for you to write interactive fiction full
 time.  In the years to come, your ability to concentrate exclusively
 on the art takes IF in amazing new directions.

 ...and all because you dared to dress up in a Wizard of Frobozz
 costume when you went to PAX East!

 PAX East 2010 Speed-IF
 by Jesse McGrew & Kate Matthews
 Release 2 / Serial number 100403

 Broom Station Lobby
 The broken-down brooms scattered around the lobby suggest that this
 broom station hasn't been well maintained. A musty smell wafts in from
 the platforms, one to the east and one to the west.

>examine ticket
 This ticket is valid for one round trip on any broom route.

>examine me
 You look like you're up for an adventure.

>go west
 West Platform
 A sign above the platform reads: 'Broom 431 to Boston'. The lobby is
 back to the east.
 A broom hovers on the platform, ready to be boarded.

>examine broom
 This broom is crafted from smooth cherry wood and bears the
 inscription '431'. To board it, you'll need to insert a ticket in the
 slot.

>board broom
 The broom bucks you off! You'll need to insert a ticket first.

>insert ticket
 I don't understand that sentence.

>put ticket in broom
 You slide the ticket into the broom's ticket slot, and the broom
 shakes in a welcoming fashion. You climb aboard, and the broom tilts
 back and rockets up through the stratosphere.

 As you learned back in wizard academy, long-distance broom travel
 relies on the low gravity of outer space, and only became practical
 when the lesoch spell was invented to allow travelers to breathe on
 the journey. Luckily, you had the foresight to add the lesoch option
 to your ticket!

 After a few short minutes, the broom falls back to earth, and you step
 off on the roof of the Boston Convention Center.

 Roof of the Boston Convention Center
 A cold, blustery wind blows past you. The stairs leading down to the

 The room is filled with people holding mangoes, gazing intently at the
 chalkboard at the front of the room, but the speaker seems to have
 left. Guess you arrived late.

>examine mango
 It's yellowish orange, with a bruise on it, and a little squishy.

>examine board
 The chalkboard reads: 'Exercise 1: Ireland is experiencing severe
 famine due to the potato blight. How can magic solve this problem?'

>spuddo mango
 You cast spuddo at the mango, and it turns into a potato!

 Suddenly, the door opens behind you and a grey-haired wizard bursts
 in. "Yes, you've got it!" he says. Addressing the rest of the room, he
 says, "You louts had better take a long look at yourselves. I've been
 gone for 45 minutes and none of you figured that out? Shameful! Get
 out of this convention--no, get out of Boston!"

 He wiggles his fingers, and the other attendees vanish with an actinic
 flash of light. The wizard turns back to you. "Now, maybe you can help
 me with the other panel I'm running. These horrible sea bugs just
 aren't as lively as the guy at the store said they'd be."

 He wiggles his fingers again and a new door appears in the wall; you
 follow him through.

 Magic in Education Panel Hall
 A banner hanging from the ceiling reads: 'Battle of Bunker Hill'. A
 crowd of spectators is gathered around a small pit in the center of
 the room. In the pit are a dozen lethargic lobsters, barely moving.

>examine lobsters
 Some of them are dressed as redcoats, others as revolutionary
 soldiers. But none of them are moving very much.

>inventory
 You are carrying:
    potato
    lamp (providing light)
 You have learned the spells:
    malyon (animate)
    spuddo (transmute fruit into tubers)

>malyon lobsters
 You cast malyon at the pit of lobsters, and suddenly they spring to
 life! They raise their pincers and scuttle towards each other...

 After several minutes of fevered pincing, the revolutionary lobsters
 scurry away. The redcoat lobsters are victorious, but at great cost:
 most of them are lying stunned, pinced into unconsciousness. A Pyrrhic
 victory.

 The wizard slaps you on the back. "Fantastic! I knew there was a spell
 that would help here, but I must have dropped the scroll when I got
 off my broom this morning. You've saved my panel! Take this as a token
 of my appreciation."

 He pulls a diamond-encrusted wizard hat from his robe and hands it to
 you.
 Best swag ever. You win!

 Broom Station Lobby
 The broken-down brooms scattered around the lobby suggest that this
 broom station hasn't been well maintained. A musty smell wafts in from
 the platforms, one to the east and one to the west.

>go east
 East Platform
 A sign above the platform reads: 'Broom 692 to Tampa'. The lobby is
 back to the west.
 A broom hovers on the platform, ready to be boarded.

>put ticket in slot
 You slide the ticket into the broom's ticket slot, and the broom
 shakes in a welcoming fashion. You climb aboard, and the broom tilts
 back and rockets up through the stratosphere.

 As you learned back in wizard academy, long-distance broom travel
 relies on the low gravity of outer space, and only became practical
 when the lesoch spell was invented to allow travelers to breathe on
 the journey. Luckily, you had the foresight to add the lesoch option
 to your ticket!

 After a few short minutes, the broom falls back to earth, and you step
 off in the middle of the Tampa Feminist Witches' Retreat.
 Unfortunately, the convention is in Boston, and you spent your last
 wizbuck on that ticket!

 Roof of the Boston Convention Center
 A cold, blustery wind blows past you. The stairs leading down to the

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Verbose descriptions.








 Well, here you are, sitting in geosychronous orbit above Indianapolis,
 Indiana. You're stuck here, when you'd much rather be down in Boston,
 attending PAX-East and meeting the fine folks you chat with on the
 ifMUD.
 Suddenly, you remember the remote-bot. You can send it in your place.
 You run over to the computer and program the bot for it's adventure.
 You stuff your PAX-East ticket in its carrier and send it off on its
 way.
 You watch the fiery descent and its violent crash through the roof of
 the center.

 Dark Room
   A Grue exhibit. Posters line the walls, depicting various artists'
 depiction of what a grue might look like.
   Poster 1, Poster 2, and Poster 3 are here.

>examine poster 1

 nothing but blackness and a waxy residue. Below the poster is a small
 inscription that reads 'Grue that ate my dad' by: Jimmy F., aged 8.

>examine poster 2
 This poster is reproduction of the famous oil on canvas 'Grue attack'
 by Emmenly Small. There are two, small yellow-green eyes barely
 visible in the bottom right third of the image.

 A reprint of the only known, authenticted photo of a grue. It was
 found by the bones of the famous, cave-crawler J. Lottie. All that's

 camera.
