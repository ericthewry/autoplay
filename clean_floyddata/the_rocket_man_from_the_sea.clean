 The Hugo MiniComp is a sort of interactive fiction-based gathering of
 developers, originally the brainchild of Jon Blask on the ifMud.
 Download all the Hugo MiniComp games from [<a href="http://www.joltcountry.com">LINK</A>],
 or try searching on the Interactive Fiction Database at TADS.org
 ([<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org">LINK</A>]).

 This game, Retro-Nemesis, was originally a piece of static fiction
 that I wrote for Jason Scott, to be included on the discs for his
 documentary <span class="floydstyle em">Get Lamp</span>. Jason had requested that I write a
 crazy little text file about what the filming of the movie
 <span class="floydstyle em">might</span> have been like. He was going to include it in a 'hidden
 in plain sight' directory to see if anyone found it. It was hidden so
 well that the duplicators assumed he didn't want it included on the
 discs at all. Rather than let the story be lost to time, I have tried
 to rework it for the Hugo MiniComp. As such, there are vast oceans of
 text broken up by a valid move or two.

 To talk to people in the game, just use TALK TO JASON and so forth.

 You can download my other games at Jolt Country, and I hope you enjoy
 the Hugo MiniComp! For more information on programming in games in

 <span class="floydstyle em">The Tattoo Parlor</span>
 I'm in a tattoo parlor, getting the <span class="floydstyle em">Zork</span> logo inked on my
 forearm, in order to get more screen time for the "GET LAMP"
 documentary. Jason Scott is here, grinning like the Sentient Demon Sun
 on the day mankind slowly discerns that there has always been a
 second, sentient, demon sun. He switched the original "Zork" logo the
 artist was using for reference with the one from <span class="floydstyle em">Zork III</span>
 when the guy was self-administrating a body shot. I'm no stranger to
 drinking on the job, but the artist pooled the booze in the  "o" of
 his self-stenciled "MOM" tattoo before lighting it on fire. So I'm
 sufficiently distracted to where I don't realize that the guy is
 painfully drawing in extra Roman numerals until it's too late.

 Scott's filming the whole thing, panning up to my grimacing. The
 <span class="floydstyle em">Zork</span> logo is made up of a bunch of little rocks, and the
 surface area for the extra ones is greater than that of a big batch of
 Safeway-Brand discount popcorn chicken. I can't even remember why
 "being on film" was so important to me, except that I wanted more
 exposure than Kent Tessman, CM, that smug bastard. Scott had a deal
 for me: First, help him break into Adam Thornton's second home in
 Canada, so we can film ourselves torching the place in order to
 dramatize the ending of Trinity. And secondly, be the subject for "the
 tattoo scene" to show how crazy text game fans are. I'd get featured
 in seven extra clips by doing all this.

 "How many clips am I in now?" I asked. I'm fucking shrewd, just look
 at me. If it were like four or something, well, I'm no fool. Four
 clips is enough to splice together a Youtube video with and get some
 thoughtful comments, maybe even some that don't bash women, wets or
 Jews.

 "This many," he said, holding up a copy of <span class="floydstyle em">Zork Zero</span> with his
 hand over the "Zork" part. Fuck!

 "Are you sure he will be alright?" asks mother, struggling under the
 weight of the crate she's lifting to the boat. Your father glances at
 you, one foot on the side of the boat, and harrumphs.

 'When I was his age I minded the station alone for days' he says,
 taking the crate effortlessly from your mother, who leans back
 pressing her palms against the small of her back. "And there were
 <span class="floydstyle em">ships</span> back then." The weight of the crate makes the boat rock
 lazily, and you glance at the scummy black water between the boat's
 side and the concrete pier.

 "You will do alright, won't you, son?" You look up quickly and meet
 your father's gaze. He has that expression you don't like, his eyes
 make you squirm and feel nervous; like you have already disappointed
 him and there will be a belt or a switch in store for you when they
 get back home.

 "No sir! I mean yes sir, I will do my best," you stammer over the
 creak and squeal of the seagulls circling above you, hopeful for a
 fish or an unminded crate of food. Father sighs and helps your mother
 into the boat. Gogol is on the pier, looking at your parents and the
 seagulls, tail wagging and tongue lolling out in the breeze.

 The engine roars to life, hitting you with a quickly dissipating
 headachy and sweet cloud of exhaust, and as it does, for a moment you
 feel really scared and alone. Mother waves at you, you wave back and
 spend a few long minutes watching the boat pull off towards the
 mainland.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
>examine me

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pier</span>
 The pier is built in the end of a breakwater that protects the natural
 bay of the island from northerly winds. There's room for a couple of
 sailboats or yachts in addition to your motor boat, which is now just
 a small dot on the sunlit sea, heading towards the mainland.

 The sky and the sea is hazy, there is a hard westerly wind and you can
 hear waves whipping and beating the rocky shore on the other side of
 the island. On the island the only landmark is your house - a lone,
 tall yellow building used by the pilots in your grandfather's time.
 Well, there's the navigational cairn on the high northern end of the
 island, just a pile of rocks painted white. There are only a couple of
 trees in your yard, otherwise the island has just smooth bare stone,
 low brushes, lichen and other such hardy plants.

 On the pier there's a windbeaten equipment shack, where you store
 supplies and fuel for the boat. To the south-east, through the haze
 and across the churning sea, you can make out the towers and buildings
 of Astro City One, the world's largest rocket base.

 Gogol looks up at the wheeling seagulls.

>examine me


 As good-looking as ever.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>examine astro city


 The air is hazy today, but you can still make out the distant
 buildings and towers in the mainland. Astro City One is the largest
 and most active rocket base on Earth, usually there are five or six
 launches per year but now, with all the trouble with the traitorous
 Martians, there has been almost one launch every month! You remember
 all the launches you have seen, the sharp ripping sound of the Atomic
 Pile ripping the world itself, that blinding light and the pillar of
 smoke that rises higher and higher until your mind and the world goes
 all weird, because you <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> see and understand that the
 smoke and the light go right through the clouds and into the dark of
 space!

 One day you will travel to Astro City One, step into one of the
 rocket-ships as a Rocket-Man, and head out to the universe!

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>examine gogol


 Gogol is an Alsatian and you have the same birthday. He's your friend
 and he's very good at fetching things and catching seagulls!

>pet gogol


 You scratch Gogol behind the ears and stroke his bag, he closes his
 eyes with pleasure.

>examine shack


 It's a small but sturdy shack where father stores the boating
 supplies. The door of the shack is closed.

>open door


 You open the equipment shack, revealing a large orange life vest, a
 child size life vest, boating supplies and a boat hook.

>examine supplies


 There are ropes, cans of oil, tools, spare parts and all kinds of
 things like that in the shack, all neat and in order hanging on the
 walls or set on shelves. Your father will tan your hide if you mess
 with them.

>examine hook


 It's a long wooden pole, at least twice your height, with a hook and a
 spike in the end. It's used in pulling in equipment, ropes and other
 things that have fallen in to the water.

>examine vest


 Which do you mean, the large orange life vest or the child size life
 vest?

>child


 It's your old life vest, a little bit small for you now.

>put vest on gogol


 Which do you mean, the large orange life vest or the child size life
 vest?

>child


 (first taking the child size life vest)

 Putting things on Gogol would achieve nothing.

>gogol, wear child


 (Gogol first taking the child size life vest)
 Gogol looks at you, vaguely puzzled.

>wear adult


 You can't see any such thing.

>wear large


 (first taking the large orange life vest)
 It's too big for you, better leave it where it is. Father has always
 said that you shouldn't mess with safety equipment.

>close door


 You close the equipment shack.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a child size life vest

>open door


 You open the equipment shack, revealing a large orange life vest,
 boating supplies and a boat hook.

>put child in shack


 You put the child size life vest into the equipment shack.

>close door


 You close the equipment shack.

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wavebreak</span>
 The wavebreak is a concrete causeway built over a big long pile of
 rocks to break the waves coming from the north during wintertime. It
 protects the little bay to the south, which is nice to swim in when
 the weather is a bit better. The boat shore and the island are to the
 west, and the pier is to the east.

 Gogol trots after you.

>l s


 You see nothing unexpected in that direction.

>examine bay


 There is a small bay in the eastern edge of the island, where you
 usually swim. There's also a small boat there nobody has used in ages.

>examine boat


 There is a small bay in the eastern edge of the island, where you
 usually swim. There's also a small boat there nobody has used in ages.

>look in boat


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine rocks


 Your home island is almost completely covered by bare rock, with some
 hardy lichen and small brushes for vegetation.

>take boat


 Maybe you'll be able to do that when your superpowers kick in!

>go west



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boat Shore</span>
 The boat shore is actually the innermost nook of the small bay where
 you swim in the summertime. It's a small nook with some reeds and
 water plants, and a nice gravely sea bottom without any sharp rocks to
 hurt your bare feet on. The wavebreak protects the bay, so the water
 is usually pretty calm and sometimes it gets really warm in the
 summer. There's a small wooden boat, but nobody has used it in a long
 time since you can't go to the sea with it, just row around the bay
 and very close to the island.

 Your house and the yard is to the southwest and the wavebreak
 stretches to the east, towards the mainland. Straight to the west are
 your mother's rose bushes, that hug the side of the house, but you
 really don't want to go through them because the thorns are sharp
 enough to bite even through your clothes. The roses are in bloom and
 gusts of wind wafts their sweet smell to you. You can see something
 white and plasticky behind the bushes.

 Gogol trots after you.

>examine white


 Which do you mean, the navigational cairn or something white?

>something


 You peel apart a few leaves and branches of the rose bushes, careful
 of their thorns, to get a better look. It's a small spray can your
 mother uses to spray the plants and flowers with. She must have
 dropped it behind the rose bushes.

>go northwest


 Up close the bushes look quite thorny, and the sweet smelling summer
 roses are full of buzzing, hairy bumblebees. You tried going through
 them once, last year, and you are not going to repeat that mistake any
 time soon.

>go southwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Yard</span>
 The front yard of the house is full of color. Mother has dotted the
 place with flowerpots and crates, and even small patches of grass.
 Mother takes very good care of the yard, she says it's her small patch
 of paradise. There are two small and gnarly trees with needles and a
 brown bark that shadow the yard a bit.

 On the other side of the yard there is an outbuilding, which is
 painted red and white. The double doors to the outbuilding are open,
 it's very dark in there and you don't really want to go inside. Next
 to the outbuilding is the red outhouse.

 To the south is the bare rocky center of the island with all the moss
 and stuff, and you can get to the boat shore and the pier by going
 northeast. By going northwest you get to the back yard, from where you
 can climb to the tall hill behind the house, where the navigational
 cairn is.

 Gogol trots after you.

>examine flowerpots


 There are all kinds of colourful flowers. You are forbidden to touch
 them, and your father once took the switch to you when you fell over
 the flowers while playing recklessly.

>examine crates


 There are all kinds of colourful flowers. You are forbidden to touch
 them, and your father once took the switch to you when you fell over
 the flowers while playing recklessly.

>examine trees


 They are pines, you think, you have never been good with trees since
 you have really seen only two of them. Of course you have been to the
 mainland, but not that many times. They are rather small and gnarly,
 and they drop small cones that open their scales when they fall and
 hurt a lot if you step on them barefooted.

>examine cones


 They are small pine cones, you think. On the trees they are shaped
 like a tear drop, but on the ground they open into a spiky ball that
 hurts a lot when you step in it.

>take them


 I'm not sure what "them" refers to.

>take cones


 You pick up a few pine cones.

>gogol, fetch spray can


 Gogol looks at you and makes a sound that's the canine equivalent of
 "hmm?".

>drop cones


 (the handful of pine cones)
 You don't want to leave them lying around.

>throw cone to gogol


 (the handful of pine cones to Gogol)
 No use throwing that thing around.

>smell cones


 (the handful of pine cones)
 The handful of pine cones smells of nothing unexpected.

>examine outbuilding


 It's a red and white small building where you store firewood,
 gardening tools and stuff like that. The double doors of the
 outbuilding are open, revealing the pitch black indoors. You never
 want to look at there for too long, becauseâ¦ what if, right when you
 look away, you see a glimpse of glowing eyes in there?

>examine outhouse


 The outhouse is painted red and there's a little heart shaped hole on
 the door. It's downwind so you don't catch the stink. It's getting
 full and father will make you help him empty it soon.

>enter it


 You don't need to go right now, and it's really not a place you want
 to just hang in.

>look

 cairn is.

 Gogol stands next to you, looking at you questioningly.

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Yard</span>
 The back yard of the house is actually on the western side of the
 building. You just call it the back yard, since right behind the house
 there's the rocky hill with the navigational cairn on top of it.

 There is a series of clothes lines here tied to metal posts, and there
 are some of your father's work clothes flapping in the wind. They must
 be totally dry by now.

 There's a very narrow and steep path to the top of the hill to the
 north, and there's a ladder leading up to the balcony where the pilots
 used to keep an eye for approaching ships.

 Gogol trots after you.

>examine lines


 There are a couple of posts drilled into the rocky ground, and on top
 of them there are horizontal pieces of pipe, so each of them look like
 a big letter "T"  There are some laundry lines tied to them, and your
 mother has hung up some of your father's work clothes up to dry.
 There's a dozen or so of overalls, jackets and trousers. They must
 already be bone dry with all the sunshine and the wind.

>take clothes


 Better not mess with the laundry. If you mess them up, you'll have to
 wash them by hand. This isn't a mistake you'll want to do more than
 once.

>examine ladder


 It's a ladder that leads up to the balcony on the third floor of the
 house. It's meant to be an escape route in case there is a fire, and
 it goes right past the radio room window.

>examine balcony


 On the eastern side of your house there's a small balcony, big enough
 for one man, chair and a telescope. It's where the pilots of the olden
 times stood watching for incoming ships.

>examine clothesline


 You can't see any such thing.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of the Hill</span>
 The top of the hill is almost on the level of the roof of your house,
 and you have a beautiful view over the whole island. The navigational
 cairn is eye-blindingly bright seen up close, the white paint really
 shines and reflects the hazy sunlight. There is not much vegetation in
 here, except for some patches of crunchy and dry lichen.

 Gogol trots after you.

>examine rocks


 Your home island is almost completely covered by bare rock, with some
 hardy lichen and small brushes for vegetation.

>take one


 Maybe you'll be able to do that when your superpowers kick in!

>examine island


 Your home island is pretty small, you can run from its one end to
 another in a few minutes. Almost in middle of the island is your
 house, where pilots used to live in your grandfather's time. Not
 pilots like rocket-pilots, but men who guided big ships to the
 harbour. You live there with mother, father and Gogol, who is a dog.
 There are only a couple of trees on the island, and they are in your
 yard. Otherwise it's just rock and moss and lichen and things like
 that.

 There's a hill on the north side of the island and there is this
 navigational cairn, which is just a pile of rocks that are painted
 white. It's for the ships, so that they don't run to the rocks. In the
 eastern side of the island there's a small bay and a wavebreak, which
 leads to your pier. Usually there's just your boat at the pier, but
 sometimes sailboats come to visit. To the west of the island is the
 open sea, and there are usually big waves that make a loud noise.

>examine cairn


 Behind your house there's a rocky hill with a navigational cairn on
 top of it. The cairn is a pile of rocks that get painted white every
 year, and in the sunshine it's almost bright enough to hurth your
 eyes. It's for the ships so that they know where to go.

>climb cairn


 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>search it


 You find nothing of interest.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Yard</span>
 The back yard of the house is actually on the western side of the
 building. You just call it the back yard, since right behind the house
 there's the rocky hill with the navigational cairn on top of it.

 There's a very narrow and steep path to the top of the hill to the
 north, and there's a ladder leading up to the balcony where the pilots
 used to keep an eye for approaching ships.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Ladder</span>
 You are on the ladder, right under the balcony and next to the window
 to the radio room. It's bright outside and the light reflects from the
 window pane, but you can just about make out the outline of the table
 and the radio in the corner of the room.

 Gogol is below you on the ground, waiting for you to come back down.


>examine window


 (the radio room window)
 Through the window you can see some of the furniture of the room, like
 a table and a radio, but nothing much. The window is latched shut from
 the inside.

>examine table


 By cupping your hand to block the light and leaning closer to the
 window, you can just about make out the outline of the radio and the
 table it's on. The unlike the one in the living room, this radio can
 be used to talk to people too, like the ships.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 This is the balcony where the pilots of the days of yore scanned the
 seas for incoming ships, and flashed light signals to them. Your
 father has told you how your grandfather spent his nights and days in
 here, looking at the horizon with a telescope, and your father had to
 do that sometimes too. He claims that he had to do it when he was as
 young as you are, but your mother has said that you shouldn't always
 believe what your father says.

 There was once a telescope here, you kind of remember seeing it when
 you were young, but you don't know where it has gone. You'd really
 want to find it, so you could look at the Moon and Mars, and maybe see
 some rocket ships!

 A ladder leads down from here, and to the east are the doors that lead
 to the pilots" room inside the house.

 As you start climbing up, Gogol barks at you and runs around the
 corner towards the front door of the house. When you climb over the
 railing of the balcony, you can hear the sound of Gogol's claws as he
 runs up the stairs, and appears next to you on the balcony. Smart dog!

>examine sea


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine railing


 You can't see any such thing.

>go east


 You don't really feel like going indoors, you'll get enough of that in
 the evening when you'll have to help your parents in storing and
 organizing the supplies.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Ladder</span>
 You are on the ladder, right under the balcony and next to the window
 to the radio room. It's bright outside and the light reflects from the
 window pane, but you can just about make out the outline of the table
 and the radio in the corner of the room.

 Gogol is above you in the balcony, looking down, his head squeezed
 through the rungs of the balcony's railing.


>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Yard</span>

 There's a very narrow and steep path to the top of the hill to the

 used to keep an eye for approaching ships.

 As you climb down, Gogol's head vanishes from between the rungs of the
 balcony's railing. When your feet touch the ground, you can hear Gogol
 running around the corner to meet you on the back yard.

>se



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Yard</span>
 The front yard of the house is full of color. Mother has dotted the

 Please press SPACE to continue.
 The crafty bastards were waiting for the command personnel to leave -
 you can still see the Atomic Engine flame of their ship in the red
 Martian sky. They have landed ground troops and made fortifications
 around Firebase Bravo, your main outpost in the war against the filthy
 Martians. Their command post is on a hill behind the base.

 Your mission, soldier, is to destroy that base! You need weapons and
 explosives to complete the mission, and of course your Robotic Attack
 Hound Go601!

 You are standing in front of Firebase Bravo under the harsh Martian
 sky. The winds whip around you and in the horizon you can see the a
 massive sand storm closing in. The intelligence reports tell of enemy
 presence and fortifications on the east and west flanks of the base,
 and on the hill behind the base there is a bunker.

 The best places for supplies are the firebase itself and the Orbital
 Station, where you can go by the space elevator that's in the easterly
 direction from the base. You will need at least armor and a helmet,
 and a weapon of some kind!

 Go601 is venting excess heat through the snout interface.

 Go601 is a Cyber Hound with titanium teeth and razor sharp claws!

>go northwest



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Flank of the Base</span>
 The western flank of Firebase Bravo is totally overrun with the enemy.
 There is a group of Martians guarding the only road leading up to the
 mountain and their bunker to the north. There are six of them and they
 look vigilant, their eye-stalks turning around and their tentacled
 hands waving around their assault rifles. Some of the Martians are
 yammering to a communications device in their filthy lingo - they must
 be jammed before an attack!

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the ground.

 The soldiers are nattering in their handheld communications devices.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Rocket Base</span>
 There is a small rocket base next to Firebase Bravo, it's meant for
 emergencies only, and the lone rocket ship standing on its launch
 pedestal has seen better days. It's unlikely to fly anymore - not that
 you would be thinking of escape, no sir!

 The dastardly Martians have set up fortifications to the west and
 northwest of here, blocking the way to their bunker on top of the
 hill. There are rolls and rolls of razor wire that will tear a man to
 shreds.

 You can see a piece of equipment behind the fortifications.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the ground.

>examine equipment


 You peer through the rolls of razor wire and damn - there is a flame
 thrower behind the fortifications! It must have been left there by one
 of the Martians!

>examine fortifications


 There are coils and coils of laser sharpened razor wire, there's no
 way you can weave your way through it.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Space Elevator</span>
 You are standing at the ground station of the space elevator that
 leads all the way up to the orbit of Mars. The elevator vanishes up to
 the pink sky as an impossibly tall and impossibly sharp needle.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the ground.

>go east


 You can't go that way.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Orbital Station</span>
 The orbital station is high above the surface and the atmosphere of
 Mars, and it's used to launch the larger rocket ships that are just
 too heavy to land on the planet. There is an equipment storage locker
 in here.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the floor.

>open locker


 You open the equipment storage locker, revealing a battle armor and a
 tactical armor.

>wear battle armour

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Airlock</span>
 The airlock is designed to keep out the dust and poisons of Martian
 air, and keep the good, healthy Earth air in. It has turned into a
 storage for all kinds of junk.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the floor.

 There isn't anything really interesting in the piles of junk, just
 stuff people have needed outdoors and then just left it here when
 coming in.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Mess</span>
 The mess is supposed to be the kitchen and the dining area of the
 base, but it has evolved into an impromptu equipment storage as well.
 There's an equipment closet in here, and a refrigerated food storage
 where the chef stores all the horrible goop she forces the soldiers to
 eat.

 Someone has left a time bomb sitting on the sink! How irresponsible!

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the floor.

 jamming device, which can be used to eavesdrop and jam the Martian
 broadcasts.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the floor.

>eavesdrop


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine jamming


 It's a state of the art electronic eavesdropping and jamming device,
 which can be used to eavesdrop the Martian broadcasts or to jam their
 signals. There's a knob in the front panel with two labels. The device
 itself is currently switched off.

>examine knob


 It's a knob with two settings: Eavesdrop and Jam. It's set on
 Eavesdrop.

>turn jammer on


 You can't see any such thing.

>turn jamming on


 You switch the jamming device on.

 The jamming device is in the eavesdrop mode. You can hear the horrible
 gobbledygook the Martians call a language spouting out from it.

>turn knob


 You turn the knob on the jamming device, and the Martian
 communications turn into a screech of static.

 The jamming device emits a horrible hiss and screech as it's jamming
 the Martian communications.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the floor.

>examine bunk


 It's where you sleep in between missions.

>tapes


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine tapes


 There are educational and entertaining tapes of all kinds of subjects,
 like rocketry, nature and training animals. There's also a manual for
 operating Cyber Hounds like Go601. It knows a lot of dull and ordinary
 tricks, but you are really proud that last summer you programmed it to
 fetch things when you throw canine motivational treats at them. Your
 mothâ¦ commanding officer was really angry when all of her garden gear
 was covered with dog drool.

 massive sand storm closing in. The intelligence reports tell of enemy
 presence and fortifications on the east and west flanks of the base,
 and on the hill behind the base there is a bunker.

 The best places for supplies are the firebase itself and the Orbital
 Station, where you can go by the space elevator that's in the easterly
 direction from the base. You will need at least armor and a helmet,
 and a weapon of some kind!

 The dastardly Martians have set up fortifications to the west and
 northwest of here, blocking the way to their bunker on top of the
 hill. There are rolls and rolls of razor wire that will tear a man to
 shreds.

 There is a flame thrower on the ground behind the fortifications.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the ground.

>throw motivational treat at thrower


 Go601's head snaps up when you take out the packet of treats, and
 break away a small piece. You throw the piece over the fortifications,
 and Go601 is up in the air almost before the piece has left your
 fingers. The Cyber Hound soars over the fortifications, landing on all
 fours on the slippery rock.

 The treat has landed right next to the flame thrower, and Go601
 snuffles around it for a moment before grabbing it in his jaws and
 looking at you questioningly. 'Here, boy, come on!' you shout at it,
 and Go601 trots behind the Firebase, arriving around the corner a
 moment later and dropping the fire thrower at your feet. Good boy!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Western Flank of the Base</span>
 The western flank of Firebase Bravo is still occupied by the Martian
 menace, but the soldiers who were guarding the road are now coughing
 in the cloud of smoke and trying to figure out what caused it! The
 filthy Martians are babbling and gargling into their communications
 devices, which you have jammed. Hahaa!

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the ground.

>attack martians with flamethrower


 You burst out of your hiding place, and with a blood curdling battle
 cry you fall on your enemies, spraying around liquid fire that fries
 the tentacled Martian monsters to bits. They are so distracted by the
 smoke bomb and their malfunctioning communications that you take three
 of them out before they even realize what is happening. The rest of
 them are an easy prey for your flame thrower.

 In mere seconds you are standing amidst the smoking and crackling
 corpses of the Martian horrors, and the road to their base is open!

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Martian Bunker</span>
 The Martian base is a huge bunker built atop the mountain next to
 Firebase Bravo. The cowardly Martians have sealed themselves in, no
 doubt waiting for reinforcements to take over the Firebase and the
 whole area. That must not happen, this foothold has to be destroyed at
 any cost! The problem is, the bunker has really thick walls.

 Go601 follows you, its titanium claws rattling against the ground.

>examine foothold


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine bunker


 (the martian bunker)
 Up close it's even more massive and hideous than seen from afar. They
 have built it from their concrete-like spit, combined with electrics
 and electronics. There's a weird device assembly on the top of the
 bunker, and although it's otherwise seamless, there's something that
 looks like an entrance: a totally featureless slab with slight seams.

>examine slab


 The bunker entrance is a totally featureless slab, with a seam that's
 so narrow it could as well be a line drawn with a pen.

>examine device


 You can't fathom most of the functions of the devices, but some of
 them are quite obvious: there are motion detectors all around the
 bunker. If you get within a few meters of it, no doubt an alarm will
 ring inside and you will get swarmed by dozens and dozens of Martian
 monstrosities pouring out of the entrance. You will need something to
 slow them down a bit!

>examine caltrops


 They are named after an ancient weapon, which was a spiky thing they
 dropped in the olden times to slow down horses and men. Laser caltrop
 mines shoot out hundreds of laser beams that fill your feet with
 holes.

>drop caltrops


 You run to the bunker door, and hear a whirring sound from the device
 assembly on top of the bunker, shortly followed by an alert klaxon
 inside. You place the mines quickly on the ground, toss a few pieces
 of lichen on top of them, and duck around the corner and out of the
 blast radius. There! Now you have only a few seconds to set the time
 bomb!

>set time bomb


 You dash towards the Martian bunker, wary of gunnery holes, secret
 doorways or other ambushes, but the cowardly Martians are totally
 sealed in. But oh no, what is this - there are gliders above you and
 they have spotted you! You have only a few seconds to act, and you
 decide to make the biggest sacrifice a soldier can make.

 You set the timer for a few seconds and leap on the bunker! You can
 hear the lasers of the gliders squeawking above you as the Martian
 glider pilots zero in to you.

 "FOR EARTH!" you scream and press the bomb against the wall of the
 bunker, and <span class="floydstyle i">BOOOOOOOM!</span>

 You fly through the air and land on the ground, blown to shreds by the
 bomb, but the Martian bunker is destroyed! Now the Earth Command can
 retake the area and Firebase Bravo, you have lost your life but you
 will be a hero, maybe they will name the base after you and build you
 a statue!


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 You stay on your back on the crunchy but soft patch of lichen, and
 look at the skies. That was an intense game, and a little bit sad,
 since the hero had to die in the end. But that's war, people die, but
 they die for their planet and they die as heroes.

 Gogol walks next to you, sniffs your ear and lies down next to you - a
 big, hairy warm animal. Although it's windy, the sun is warm and the
 navigational cairn next to you provides some cover. You turn your head
 and look past your house to the southern end of the island. For a
 moment you think there's something silvery and glittery in there, but
 having been running outside the whole morning, you suddenly realize
 you are very sleepy.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 You wake up to Gogol licking your face. You splutter and get up,
 wiping the dog drool off your face. You have no idea how long you have
 slept, your back is a bit sore from lying on the rocky ground, even
 with the soft lichen. The sun has moved in the sky, you must've slept
 at least a couple of hours! You feel all groggy and messy, but well
 rested. Time to go back in, I guess.

 Wait a minute, is it just sun glinting on the wavesâ¦? No, there
 <span class="floydstyle em">is</span> something shiny in the sea in the southern end of the
 island!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Top of the Hill</span>
 The top of the hill is almost on the level of the roof of your house,
 and you have a beautiful view over the whole island. The navigational
 cairn is eye-blindingly bright seen up close, the white paint really
 shines and reflects the hazy sunlight. There is not much vegetation in
 here, except for some patches of crunchy and dry lichen.

 Gogol looks up at the wheeling seagulls.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Yard</span>
 The back yard of the house is actually on the western side of the
 building. You just call it the back yard, since right behind the house
 there's the rocky hill with the navigational cairn on top of it.

 There is a series of clothes lines here tied to metal posts, and there
 are some of your father's work clothes flapping in the wind. They must
 be totally dry by now.

 There's a very narrow and steep path to the top of the hill to the
 north, and there's a ladder leading up to the balcony where the pilots
 used to keep an eye for approaching ships.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Ladder</span>
 You are on the ladder, right under the balcony and next to the window
 to the radio room. It's bright outside and the light reflects from the
 window pane, but you can just about make out the outline of the table
 and the radio in the corner of the room.

 Gogol is below you on the ground, waiting for you to come back down.


>go up



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Balcony</span>
 This is the balcony where the pilots of the days of yore scanned the
 seas for incoming ships, and flashed light signals to them. Your
 father has told you how your grandfather spent his nights and days in
 here, looking at the horizon with a telescope, and your father had to
 do that sometimes too. He claims that he had to do it when he was as
 young as you are, but your mother has said that you shouldn't always
 believe what your father says.

 There was once a telescope here, you kind of remember seeing it when
 you were young, but you don't know where it has gone. You'd really
 want to find it, so you could look at the Moon and Mars, and maybe see
 some rocket ships!

 A ladder leads down from here, and to the east are the doors that lead
 to the pilots" room inside the house.

 As you start climbing up, Gogol barks at you and runs around the
 corner towards the front door of the house. When you climb over the
 railing of the balcony, you can hear the sound of Gogol's claws as he
 runs up the stairs, and appears next to you on the balcony. Smart dog!

 There's a very narrow and steep path to the top of the hill to the
 north, and there's a ladder leading up to the balcony where the pilots
 used to keep an eye for approaching ships.

 As you climb down, Gogol's head vanishes from between the rungs of the
 balcony's railing. When your feet touch the ground, you can hear Gogol
 running around the corner to meet you on the back yard.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Yard</span>
 The front yard of the house is full of color. Mother has dotted the
 place with flowerpots and crates, and even small patches of grass.
 Mother takes very good care of the yard, she says it's her small patch
 of paradise. There are two small and gnarly trees with needles and a
 brown bark that shadow the yard a bit.

 On the other side of the yard there is an outbuilding, which is
 painted red and white. The double doors to the outbuilding are open,
 it's very dark in there and you don't really want to go inside. Next
 to the outbuilding is the red outhouse.

 To the south is the bare rocky center of the island with all the moss
 and stuff, and you can get to the boat shore and the pier by going
 northeast. By going northwest you get to the back yard, from where you
 can climb to the tall hill behind the house, where the navigational
 cairn is.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go east


 You can't go that way.

>examine bay


 There is a small bay in the eastern edge of the island, where you
 usually swim. There's also a small boat there nobody has used in ages.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Middle of the Island</span>
 The center of the island is covered by low hardy shrubs whose roots
 manage to cling to the rocks in the harsh winter winds. Here and there
 rocks poke through the undergrowth, covered with gray and orange
 lichen. There's a narrow path through the area to the south of the
 island - wading through the brush is a good way to rip your clothes
 and turn your ankle on the rocks.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pools</span>
 In the southern tip of the island the vegetation has lost the fight
 against the winds, and the rocks are almost bare here. There are
 several pools of water that almost never dry out. Some of them are
 close enough to the shore that when the tide is in, the waves can fill
 them up again, but you are not sure where all of them get their water.

 The waves are hammering the shore to the west and south of you, their
 noise is loud enough to drown the sound of the seagulls. In the east,
 in the lee side of the island, the waves are much more quiet.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go south


 It takes you a moment to really understand what you are seeing, what
 is the thing that's bobbing up and down with the waves, tangled in the
 rocks a couple of meters from the shore.

 Please press SPACE to continue.
 Oh my god!

 IT'S A SPACE SUIT!


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 A silvery wrinkled space suit and a large helmet, with a visor that
 glints in hues of gold, being bashed against the rocks by the waves,
 it's so bright in the sunshine that it almost hurts your eyes.

 No, wait, oh my god!


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 IT MOVED, IT JUST MOVED! THERE'S A PERSON IN THERE, IT'S A ROCKET-MAN!

 He's in trouble, he's trying to grab the rocks while clutching a large
 suitcase to his chest! I must help him!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Shore</span>
 The thundering of the waves is ear-splitting in this end of the
 island, and the air is full of the salty mist of their breaking. In
 the south the island has no clear waterline (except at high tide),  it
 just gradually vanishes under the sea, leaving tall rocks jutting up
 from the sea meters and meters from the shore. Father says that there
 are many shipwrecks close to the south tip because careless captains
 and sailors came too close to the shore. Often there's all kinds of
 flotsam floating between the rocks. Now there are only slimy and old
 sticks, leaves and algae mats, but sometimes you have found cans,
 bottles and once even plastic doll. In spite of the high winds,
 there's a stink of rotting seaweed and old fish.

 There's a rocket pilot fighting for his life amidst the waves that are
 pounding him against the rocks. The stubby gloves of his suit can't
 get a purchase on the slimy rocks, and he's trying to hang on to a
 small suitcase with one hand.

 Gogol trots after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boat Shore</span>
 The boat shore is actually the innermost nook of the small bay where
 you swim in the summertime. It's a small nook with some reeds and
 water plants, and a nice gravely sea bottom without any sharp rocks to
 hurt your bare feet on. The wavebreak protects the bay, so the water
 is usually pretty calm and sometimes it gets really warm in the
 summer. There's a small wooden boat, but nobody has used it in a long
 time since you can't go to the sea with it, just row around the bay
 and very close to the island.

 Your house and the yard is to the southwest and the wavebreak
 stretches to the east, towards the mainland. Straight to the west are
 your mother's rose bushes, that hug the side of the house, but you
 really don't want to go through them because the thorns are sharp
 enough to bite even through your clothes. The roses are in bloom and
 gusts of wind wafts their sweet smell to you.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wavebreak</span>
 The wavebreak is a concrete causeway built over a big long pile of
 rocks to break the waves coming from the north during wintertime. It
 protects the little bay to the south, which is nice to swim in when
 the weather is a bit better. The boat shore and the island are to the
 west, and the pier is to the east.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pier</span>
 The pier is built in the end of a breakwater that protects the natural
 bay of the island from northerly winds. There's room for a couple of
 sailboats or yachts in addition to your motor boat.

 The sky and the sea is hazy, there is a hard westerly wind and you can
 hear waves whipping and beating the rocky shore on the other side of
 the island. On the island the only landmark is your house - a lone,
 tall yellow building used by the pilots in your grandfather's time.
 Well, there's the navigational cairn on the high northern end of the
 island, just a pile of rocks painted white. There are only a couple of
 trees in your yard, otherwise the island has just smooth bare stone,
 low brushes, lichen and other such hardy plants.

 On the pier there's a windbeaten equipment shack, where you store
 supplies and fuel for the boat. To the south-east, through the haze
 and across the churning sea, you can make out the towers and buildings
 of Astro City One, the world's largest rocket base.

 Gogol trots after you.

>open shack


 You open the equipment shack, revealing a large orange life vest,
 boating supplies and a boat hook.

>take hook


 It takes some effort to yank the long, unwieldy and surprisingly heavy
 boat hook out of the shack. It's so heavy you have to hold it in the
 middle when you walk so you don't topple over.

 You already have that.

 It's too big for you, better leave it where it is. Father has always

 The rocket man doesn't seem interested.

>take man with hook


 I only understood you as far as wanting to take the rocket man.

>hook man


 You step into the shallow ice-cold water, almost slipping on the slimy
 rocks under the surface. The boat hook is surprisingly unwieldy, it's
 heavy and far longer than you are. You try to push it forward to catch
 the rocket man, but the tip just keeps sinking under the surface
 before it reaches him - you are just not strong enough to lift it up.

 An idea! You lift the pole almost straight up, and let it fall towards
 the suit. Too late you realize, that the hook is quite sharp, you
 might actuall hurt-

 The hook hits the rocket man straight in the helmet visor, leaving a
 star shaped crack. You yelp and let go of the shaft, the rocket man
 jolts and grabs the boat hook, pulling it out of your reach. A wave
 catches it, flips it around the rocks, and it vanishes amidst the
 surf. Oh my god, father is going to kill you for losing the hook!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wavebreak</span>
 The wavebreak is a concrete causeway built over a big long pile of
 rocks to break the waves coming from the north during wintertime. It
 protects the little bay to the south, which is nice to swim in when
 the weather is a bit better. The boat shore and the island are to the
 west, and the pier is to the east.

 hurt your bare feet on. The wavebreak protects the bay, so the water
 is usually pretty calm and sometimes it gets really warm in the
 summer. There's a small wooden boat, but nobody has used it in a long

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Yard</span>
 The front yard of the house is full of color. Mother has dotted the
 place with flowerpots and crates, and even small patches of grass.
 Mother takes very good care of the yard, she says it's her small patch
 of paradise. There are two small and gnarly trees with needles and a
 brown bark that shadow the yard a bit.

 On the other side of the yard there is an outbuilding, which is
 painted red and white. The double doors to the outbuilding are open,
 it's very dark in there and you don't really want to go inside. Next
 to the outbuilding is the red outhouse.

 To the south is the bare rocky center of the island with all the moss
 and stuff, and you can get to the boat shore and the pier by going
 northeast. By going northwest you get to the back yard, from where you
 can climb to the tall hill behind the house, where the navigational
 cairn is.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Middle of the Island</span>
 The center of the island is covered by low hardy shrubs whose roots
 manage to cling to the rocks in the harsh winter winds. Here and there
 rocks poke through the undergrowth, covered with gray and orange
 lichen. There's a narrow path through the area to the south of the
 island - wading through the brush is a good way to rip your clothes
 and turn your ankle on the rocks.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pools</span>
 In the southern tip of the island the vegetation has lost the fight
 against the winds, and the rocks are almost bare here. There are
 several pools of water that almost never dry out. Some of them are
 close enough to the shore that when the tide is in, the waves can fill
 them up again, but you are not sure where all of them get their water.

 The waves are hammering the shore to the west and south of you, their
 noise is loud enough to drown the sound of the seagulls. In the east,
 in the lee side of the island, the waves are much more quiet.

 Gogol trots after you.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Shore</span>
 The thundering of the waves is ear-splitting in this end of the
 island, and the air is full of the salty mist of their breaking. In
 the south the island has no clear waterline (except at high tide),  it
 just gradually vanishes under the sea, leaving tall rocks jutting up
 from the sea meters and meters from the shore. Father says that there
 are many shipwrecks close to the south tip because careless captains
 and sailors came too close to the shore. Often there's all kinds of
 flotsam floating between the rocks. Now there are only slimy and old
 sticks, leaves and algae mats, but sometimes you have found cans,
 bottles and once even plastic doll. In spite of the high winds,
 there's a stink of rotting seaweed and old fish.

 There's a rocket pilot fighting for his life amidst the waves that are
 pounding him against the rocks. The stubby gloves of his suit can't
 get a purchase on the slimy rocks, and he's trying to hang on to a
 small suitcase with one hand.

 Gogol trots after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pier</span>
 The pier is built in the end of a breakwater that protects the natural
 bay of the island from northerly winds. There's room for a couple of
 sailboats or yachts in addition to your motor boat.

 The sky and the sea is hazy, there is a hard westerly wind and you can
 hear waves whipping and beating the rocky shore on the other side of
 the island. On the island the only landmark is your house - a lone,
 tall yellow building used by the pilots in your grandfather's time.
 Well, there's the navigational cairn on the high northern end of the
 island, just a pile of rocks painted white. There are only a couple of
 trees in your yard, otherwise the island has just smooth bare stone,
 low brushes, lichen and other such hardy plants.

 On the pier there's a windbeaten equipment shack, where you store
 supplies and fuel for the boat. To the south-east, through the haze
 and across the churning sea, you can make out the towers and buildings
 of Astro City One, the world's largest rocket base.

 Gogol trots after you.

>open shack


 You open the equipment shack, revealing a large orange life vest,
 boating supplies and a boat hook.

 It takes some effort to yank the long, unwieldy and surprisingly heavy

 heavy and far longer than you are. You try to push it forward to catch
 the rocket man, but the tip just keeps sinking under the surface
 before it reaches him - you are just not strong enough to lift it up.

 An idea! You lift the pole almost straight up, and let it fall towards
 the suit. Too late you realize, that the hook is quite sharp, you
 might actuall hurt-

 The hook hits the rocket man straight in the helmet visor, leaving a
 star shaped crack. You yelp and let go of the shaft, the rocket man
 jolts and grabs the boat hook, pulling it out of your reach. A wave
 catches it, flips it around the rocks, and it vanishes amidst the

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Front Yard</span>
 The front yard of the house is full of color. Mother has dotted the
 place with flowerpots and crates, and even small patches of grass.
 Mother takes very good care of the yard, she says it's her small patch
 of paradise. There are two small and gnarly trees with needles and a
 brown bark that shadow the yard a bit.

 On the other side of the yard there is an outbuilding, which is
 painted red and white. The double doors to the outbuilding are open,
 it's very dark in there and you don't really want to go inside. Next
 to the outbuilding is the red outhouse.

 To the south is the bare rocky center of the island with all the moss
 and stuff, and you can get to the boat shore and the pier by going
 northeast. By going northwest you get to the back yard, from where you
 can climb to the tall hill behind the house, where the navigational
 cairn is.

 Gogol trots after you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Yard</span>
 The back yard of the house is actually on the western side of the
 building. You just call it the back yard, since right behind the house
 there's the rocky hill with the navigational cairn on top of it.

 There is a series of clothes lines here tied to metal posts, and there
 are some of your father's work clothes flapping in the wind. They must
 be totally dry by now.

 There's a very narrow and steep path to the top of the hill to the
 north, and there's a ladder leading up to the balcony where the pilots
 used to keep an eye for approaching ships.

 You are on the ladder, right under the balcony and next to the window

 (first opening the radio room window)
 It is latched shut from the inside. Better not mess with it, you are

>examine latch


 It's a simple latch that closes the window from the inside. There's a
 bit of a crack on the window pane, and you have many times wondered if
 you could jimmy it open somehowâ¦ But there's no way you would ever
 dare to try that, you'll father would tan your hide and no mistake if
 you ever got caught.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Boat Shore</span>
 The boat shore is actually the innermost nook of the small bay where
 you swim in the summertime. It's a small nook with some reeds and
 water plants, and a nice gravely sea bottom without any sharp rocks to
 hurt your bare feet on. The wavebreak protects the bay, so the water
 is usually pretty calm and sometimes it gets really warm in the
 summer. There's a small wooden boat, but nobody has used it in a long
 time since you can't go to the sea with it, just row around the bay
 and very close to the island.

 Your house and the yard is to the southwest and the wavebreak
 stretches to the east, towards the mainland. Straight to the west are
 your mother's rose bushes, that hug the side of the house, but you
 really don't want to go through them because the thorns are sharp
 enough to bite even through your clothes. The roses are in bloom and
 gusts of wind wafts their sweet smell to you.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Shore</span>
 The thundering of the waves is ear-splitting in this end of the
 island, and the air is full of the salty mist of their breaking. In
 the south the island has no clear waterline (except at high tide),  it
 just gradually vanishes under the sea, leaving tall rocks jutting up
 from the sea meters and meters from the shore. Father says that there
 are many shipwrecks close to the south tip because careless captains
 and sailors came too close to the shore. Often there's all kinds of
 flotsam floating between the rocks. Now there are only slimy and old
 sticks, leaves and algae mats, but sometimes you have found cans,
 bottles and once even plastic doll. In spite of the high winds,
 there's a stink of rotting seaweed and old fish.

 Gogol sniffs something on the ground.

 There's a rocket pilot fighting for his life amidst the waves that are
 pounding him against the rocks. The stubby gloves of his suit can't
 get a purchase on the slimy rocks, and he's trying to hang on to a
 small suitcase with one hand.

 There's no way you can swim in the crashing waves butâ¦ Maybe Gogol
 can! He's a very good swimmer! Gogol quiets down as he notices you
 digging out the wieners and breaking off a piece. The treat arcs
 through the air and BULLSEYE, it hits the rocket man straight on his
 tummy. Gogol turns to look at you, as if saying "are you serious?",
 but leaps after the treat. He splashes through the low water and leaps
 into the waves, reaching the rocket man in seconds.

 The rocket man doesn't seem to realize what's happening, he keeps
 fighting Gogol who is pushing and dragging him towards the shore.

 Then, finally, his feet and back hit the rocky shore underwater - he
 crawls around on all fours up to the shore, dragging the suitcase
 after him, and rolls over to his back.

 Gogol shakes himself dry, and resumes barking and circling the supine
 rocket man.

 man with black hair that's matted down from sweat. His cheeks are all
 flushed and his eyes are red.

 Gogol jumps forward and starts barking. The eyes of the rocket man
 widen and he gets half up, trying to crawl away from Gogol.

>ask man about man


 The rocket man can't tear his eyes off Gogol, who's barking
 ferociously! The man looks really scared!

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a boat hook
   a white plastic spray can
   an egg timer
   a pasta strainer (being worn)
   a child size life vest (being worn)
   a packet of wieners

>give wiener to gogol


 Gogol doesn't seem interested.

>pet gogol


 Better not when he's that agitated!

>examine man


 He looks quite pale, but flushed. His dark hair is all sweaty and
 flat, and he looks really tired.


>give wieners to gogol


 Gogol doesn't seem interested.

>throw wieners to gogol


 You break off a piece and throw it at Gogol, who snaps it off straight
 from the air.

>examine gogol


 Gogol is an Alsatian and you have the same birthday. He's your friend
 and he's very good at fetching things and catching seagulls!

>look


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">South Shore</span>
 The thundering of the waves is ear-splitting in this end of the
 island, and the air is full of the salty mist of their breaking. In
 the south the island has no clear waterline (except at high tide),  it
 just gradually vanishes under the sea, leaving tall rocks jutting up
 from the sea meters and meters from the shore. Father says that there
 are many shipwrecks close to the south tip because careless captains
 and sailors came too close to the shore. Often there's all kinds of
 flotsam floating between the rocks. Now there are only slimy and old
 sticks, leaves and algae mats, but sometimes you have found cans,
 bottles and once even plastic doll. In spite of the high winds,
 there's a stink of rotting seaweed and old fish.

 The rocket man is lying on the shore, looking scared and bewildered,
 hunching against a rock and away from Gogol.

 Gogol is barking his head off at the rocket man, who looks horrified!

>examine suitcase


 It's not really a suitcase, like you have for traveling. It's more of
 a black metal case with some letters you can't read, and it looks
 really heavy.

>open it


 Better not touch that, you don't want the rocket man to get angry at
 you.

>go north


 Wild horses couldn't drag you away from the rocket man now!

>examine helmet


 The helmet is large and it looks really heavy. The visor of the helmet
 is covered with gold, so the rocket men won't burn their eyes if they
 look at the Sun or the flames of the Atomic Engines.

>talk to gogol


 Gogol looks at you and tilts its head, as if trying to understand what
 you said. It has never been too good with verbal commands.

>gogol, sit


 Gogol looks at you, it's tail end doing a restless jig, and touching
 the ground long enough to it almost count as sitting. Sigh.

>gogol, lie down


 "Be quiet Gogol!" you scream loud enough to get the dog's attention.
 He quiets down and walks to you, eyeing the rocket man suspiciously.

>talk to man


 As you speak up, the rocket man finally seems to notice you. He eyes
 your head and furrows his brow.
 You realize you are still wearing the pasta strainer you used for a
 helmet.

 "Soâ¦ kid, what are you supposed to be?" the rocket man says. His
 voice
 is gravelly, like he had a sore throat, and he has a strange accent.

 "I'm a rocket man!" you say.

>again


 The rocket man seems to be lost in thought for a moment, and then he
 raises his eyes at you. "Hey kid, is there any place you could help me
 hide in? I'm on a really secret mission, and I need to stay somewhere
 until it's dark outside. You can't tell anyone about me, you hear me!
 So, do you know anywhere?" A secret mission! Wow!

 You can think of several hiding places. You could tell the rocket man
 about the outbuilding, the equipment shack, living room (it's easy to
 hide under the table there), your room or the attic.

>ask man about mission


 "Yeah, I'm on a secrâ¦" he begins, but then blinks a couple of times
 and shakes his head, as if to clear his mind. "Hey, kid, just please
 help me."

>SAVE
>cf4

 Ok.

>tell man about table


 The rocket man listens to you for a moment, and then interrupts.
 "Really, kid, you've got to help me hide somewhere!"

>tell man about living room


 "Our living room table is pretty big, I once hid an hour under it and
 my mother couldn't find me!" you tell the rocket man, who just stares
 at you for a moment. "Iâ¦ I don't think I can really fit under a
 table,
 kid." he finally says.

>tell man about my bedroom


 The rocket man listens to you for a moment, and then interrupts.
 "Really, kid, you've got to help me hide somewhere!"

>tell man about my room


 You think for a moment before saying "I could hide you in my room!"
 The rocket man rubs his eyes, that are all red.

 "Are you really sure that your parents don't find me there? It's very
 important that <span class="floydstyle em">nobody</span> knows I'm here!" the rocket man says.

>yes




 The rocket man walks like he was carrying a ton of bricks on his
 shoulders, and he has to stop to catch his breath a couple of times.
 It takes you a good while to walk across the island and into the front
 yard. The house is cool on the inside, and you need to stop and blink
 for a moment before you can see anything in the indoor gloom.

 For a moment you think that the rocket man won't be able to get up the
 stairs, and when you finally get him in your room, he collapses on
 your bed that creaks in protest. He falls asleep almost immediately
 when his head hits the pillow. You happen to glance out of the window,
 and see your family ship a few minutes out of the pier. You run down
 to meet your parents.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 Father always wants you to help with unloading the supplies, and you
 work up a good sweat carrying the boxes of tomatos and flour and
 potatos from the boat to the cool air of the kitchen. When you are
 heading out, you bump into mother who's heading upstairs. To this day
 you don't know what happened - you make it barely to the front door
 when you can hear her scream.

 The next few moments are a panicky blur. Mother grabbing you and
 screaming for your father, the rocket man and father wrestling on the
 yard. Much later the serious men in uniforms, the endless questions
 from them and your parents, and the worst thrashing your father has
 ever given you.

 Not a day has gone by since without you thinking about who the rocket
 man was, and what happened to him.

>tell man about attic


 "Well, our house has a big attic. But it's pretty scary place
 especially when it's dark. Oh, there's a lamp there, so it's not dark
 like that", you say. The rocket man coughs and wipes sweat and salt
 water spray from his face. "That sounds pretty good, kid," he says.
 "You have family, don't you? Are you sure your parents won't find us
 there?"

>yes


 It takes some time for the rocket man to get to his feet, and whoa -
 he's tall, way taller than your father. Not a big man, though, like
 dad, but now that his suit isn't all full of air, he looks quite lean.

 It takes you quite some time to reach the house, since the rocket man
 walks like he was carrying a ton on bricks on his shoulder. He has to
 lean on the door frame for a while when you reach the porch. His skin
 is quite pale, and but his cheeks are all red. He looks like you did
 when you had the high fever last summer.

 It takes a long time for the rocket man to climb up the stairs to the
 second floor, and even longer to get to the attic. When you get there,
 he almost falls down on the floor, and crawls to a corner next to a
 big pile of boxes. Oh man, he must be really tired!

 You take a step towards the rocket man, and catch a glimpse outside of
 the window. Oh, the family ship is just a few minutes out!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Attic</span>
 The attic is a cluttered, low space with a slanted roof. It's a scary
 place with dark nooks and crannies, piles of boxes and all kinds of
 weird junk. The only light is a lone bulb that has gone dim and yellow
 with age.

 The rocket man is curled up in the corner next to a tall pile of
 boxes.

>push pile


 You can't see any such thing.

>cover man


 He's not something you can close.

>put boxes on man


 Better let all that dusty stuff lie, mother will flip if you make a

>go down



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern End of the Upstairs Hallway</span>
 The stairs coming from downstairs curve around and lead up to the
 eastern end of the upstairs hallway, which is dark and shadowy. The

 open doorways to the kitchen in the west and to the living room to the
 east.

 There are huge muddy bootprints leading upstairs!

 Gogol trots after you.

 You heard the hiss and the crackle of an untuned radio in the living

 You open the front hall closet, revealing a cleaning rag.

 You can already hear the sound of the boat engine outdoors.

>go south



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Porch</span>
 The porch has two fly-speckled windows, and the benches under them are
 covered with all kinds of stuff. You never remember having seen them
 empty, so that someone could actually sit down when putting on or
 taking off their shoes. The front hall is to the north.

 There are huge muddy and wet bootprints on the porch floor!

 Gogol trots after you.

 You heard the hiss and the crackle of an untuned radio in the living
 room.

>clean bootprint


 You mop the floor with the rag, which can't absorb much of the mess,
 but at least it can obscure the footprints.

 That's it! You have the time to return the cleaning rag to the closet
 and run to meet your parents, before they barge in. You did it!


 Your mother comes in first, stops when she hears the radio, and clucks
 her tongue. "You know your dad doesn't like it if you mess with the
 radio, go and turn it off before he comes in!" your mother says. You
 skip obediently to the living room, feeling a weird mix of relief and
 excitement.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 Unloading the supplies from the ship, unpacking them and storing all
 the items keeps you busy for most of the afternoon, and after that
 mother asks you to help her with the dinner. You try to sneak a minute
 or two to go to the attic, but without success - it seems that when
 you get one of your tasks done, the next one is already waiting. Soon
 the sun kisses the horizon and the evening draws in. Your excitement
 turns into scared and tense anticipation; there's no telling when the
 rocket man will wake up, and what will he do when he does.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 "The conflict between the Earth Alliance and the rebels of Mars has
 escalated, and there has been heavy fighting in the low Earth orbit,
 as well as around the Mars orbital stations."

 The radio murmurs in the corner of the living room, while you poke at
 the dinner with your fork. Father is sitting in his chair, smoking his
 pipe. The smoke curls around the yellow bulbs on the ceiling, making
 the air hazy. Your mother gives the radio a hostile look, and another
 to your father. "The news is so horrible these days. Turn it off,
 you're upsetting the boy."

 "Last night there were reports of small one man rockets, classified as
 shuttles, breaking through the lines of the Earth defense vessels. It
 is believed that all of them-"

 The radio goes silent with a deep <span class="floydstyle em">clunk</span>. Your dad looks up
 from his newspaper to your mom, who turned it off.  "I don't want to
 hear a single word about the war today!", mother huffs. Your father
 grunts in displeasure, but lifts up his magazine while mom walks to
 the table. "You, if you are not hungry, go for a wash and then off to
 bed!" she says.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 You try to take every chance to sneak up to the attic, but it's no use
 - your mother is sorting linen upstairs, and she ushers you directly
 to your room, and turns off the lights after you. You lie down in the
 bed, staring at the rectangle the moonlight draws on the ceiling,
 absolutely sure that you just can't fall asleep tonight-

 Please press SPACE to continue.
 You jolt awake, not sure if if you were just dreamingâ¦ but then you
 can hear it again. Slight shuffling, a muffled clank, the creak of the
 boards as someone is moving upstairs. The rocket man is awake! You
 hold your breath and listen for a moment, but the house is otherwise
 silent. Hopefully Gogol is outside, so he won't start barking. This is
 your chance!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your room</span>
 Your room is small and dark, and now it's illuminated only by the
 silvery moonlight coming through the window. You can barely make out
 your bookshelf and your closet.

>south first, I guess.


 I only understood you as far as wanting to south the boxes full of
 junk on.

>go south


 (first opening the door to your room)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern End of the Upstairs Hallway</span>
 The eastern end of the upstairs hallway is almost completely dark. To
 the north is the door to your room, and the hallway to the west leads
 to your parents' bedroom and the radio room. You can hear your father
 snoring even here. The main staircase winds down to the front hall,
 and the narrow attic staircase leads up.


>go up


 When you start to climb up the narrow attic stairs, almost on all
 fours, you can see the faint light of the single bulb upstairs. You
 poke your head out of the hatch on the floor, and see the rocket man
 on the other side of the attic. He has the suitcase on his lap.
 Something alerts him, you don't know what, and his head snaps up with
 a click. It takes you a moment to realize that the sound was him
 slamming the case shut.

 After a second he smiles, and whispers quite loudly: "Hello, kid,
 thanks for helping me. Could you sit with me for a while, there's
 something I'd like to ask you." The rocket man opens the suitcase and
 starts tinkering with whatever he has in there.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Attic</span>
 The attic is a cluttered, low space with a slanted roof. It's a scary
 place with dark nooks and crannies, piles of boxes and all kinds of
 weird junk. The only light is a lone bulb that has gone dim and yellow
 with age.

 The rocket man is sitting up in the end of the attic, leaning against
 the wall. The rocket man has peeled off the top part of his suit and
 his shirt, revealing his upper body. He's really pale and also lean,
 like a gymnast.

>wait


 Time passes.

>talk to man


 You don't really know what to say. There is a ton of things you'd like
 to ask the rocket man about - like the war, Mars, his mission, and a
 million other things!

>ask man about suitcase


 You can think of a million things you would like to ask about from
 rocket man: his rocket, the martians, his missionâ¦ Before you get any
 of them out of your mouth, the rocket man looks up from his work and
 smiles at you.

 "So, kid, thanks for not telling your parents about me. I'm on a very
 very secret mission, and nobody but you and me should know about it."
 The rocket man shoots you a stern glance, and you find yourself
 nodding vigorously.

 "Now, then, this is an island if I'm not mistaken. Is there any way
 out here? Like a ship or such? I need to get to Astro City One in a
 hurry!"

>ask man about mars


 "I bet you have been to Mars!" you say to the rocket man. "What kind
 of a place is it?" The rocket man pauses his work with the suitcase
 for a moment, and looks up. He has a weird expression on his face,
 like he was sad.

 "There's lots of empty space in Mars, these red fields of rock and
 sand. In the seas and the lakes the waves are tens of meters high, and
 much slower than in here. The sky is reddish gray on the daytime, and
 blazes red and violet in the mornings and eveningsâ¦" He falls quiet
 for a moment, and resumes working with the suitcase.

>examine suitcase


 The rocket man is hunched over the open suitcase. You try to peer
 around the open lid, but you can't see much, only some wires and weird
 stuff you can't make out.

>ask man about war


 "It's great that we have people like you to fight the vile Martians
 who threaten our freedom!" you say. The rocket man is quiet for a
 moment and doesn't look up from his work. "How exactly do they do
 that? From Mars?" he asks, quietly. You get a feeling that you said
 something stupid, but you don't really know why.

>ask man about earth


 "Astro City One is certainly the greatest place on Earth, isn't it!"
 you say enthusiastically. "Well, I've seen bigger bases. They are in
 zero-G, thoughâ¦" the rocket man mutters while concentrating on
 tinkering with the suitcase. "Where?" you ask, and he seems to snap
 out of his concentration. "Nowhere, never mind."

>ask man about gogol


 "Why were you so afraid of Gogol, he's a nice dog?" you ask. The
 rocket man clears his throat. "Well, I just am, okay?" he replies
 almost angrily."

>ask man about astro city one


 "Astro City One is certainly the greatest place on Earth, isn't it!"
 you say enthusiastically. "Well, I've seen bigger bases. They are in
 zero-G, thoughâ¦" the rocket man mutters while concentrating on
 tinkering with the suitcase. "Where?" you ask, and he seems to snap
 out of his concentration. "Nowhere, never mind."

>ask man about name


 He seems to be really concentrating on the suit case. You wait for his
 reply, but after a while you start to think that he didn't hear you.

>ask man about me


 "Do you think I can ever be a rocket man?" you ask. The rocket man
 looks at you for a couple of seconds. "I don't see why not, if you are
 healthy. Just remember to exercise a lot and do what your parents tell
 you to." he replies.

>ask man about paretns


 He grunts "Mmm-mm," obviously not listening at you.

>ask man about parents


 He seems to be really concentrating on the suit case. You wait for his
 reply, but after a while you start to think that he didn't hear you.

>ask man about mission


 "What is your mission, is it about that suitcase?" you ask, with your
 heart beating like crazy. The rocket man bites his lips for a moment
 and glances up at you. "In this suitcase I have some enemy
 intelligence I caught from the... the vile Martians. I need to get
 these to Astro City one as soon as possible."

>ask man about rocket


 "How did you end up in the sea? Where's your rocket ship?" you ask. "I
 gotâ¦ there was an accident, I had to crash land." the rocket man
 said.

 "Okay, I'm ready to leave," the rocket man says and closes the
 suitcase with a snap. He gets up, grunting and pressing his hand
 against his side. You watch as he pulls on his undershirt, which is
 some kind of thermal space material, and zips up his space suit.

 Getting out of the house is nerve wracking, especially in the attic
 stairs where the clumsy space suit makes all kinds of noise. Luckily
 your father's snoring covers it all up.

 Not even Gogol launches into a barking attack when you go outside.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 The Moon is bright and the sea is calm. You watch over the sea towards
 the glittering towers of the Astro City one.

 "Well, that's it then", rocket man says, giving the last evaluating
 glance to the family ship on the pier. "I guess I'll have to swim for
 it." He gives you one last smile and a wave, fastens his helmet and
 lowers himself to the water in the end of the pier.

 You stay on the pier, watching his small bobbing form vanish to the
 glitter of moon light on the sea.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 You never told anyone about the weird encounter you had that day. Not
 even 40 years later, when they make the marine archaeological find of
 the century just a couple of kilometers away from your childhood's
 home island.

 "The one that got away." A find that could have changed the whole
 history of Earth-Mars relations.

 the table. "You, if you are not hungry, go for a wash and then off to
 bed!" she says.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 You try to take every chance to sneak up to the attic, but it's no use
 - your mother is sorting linen upstairs, and she ushers you directly
 to your room, and turns off the lights after you. You lie down in the
 bed, staring at the rectangle the moonlight draws on the ceiling,
 absolutely sure that you just can't fall asleep tonight-

 Please press SPACE to continue.
 You jolt awake, not sure if if you were just dreamingâ¦ but then you
 can hear it again. Slight shuffling, a muffled clank, the creak of the
 boards as someone is moving upstairs. The rocket man is awake! You
 hold your breath and listen for a moment, but the house is otherwise
 silent. Hopefully Gogol is outside, so he won't start barking. This is
 your chance!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Your room</span>
 Your room is small and dark, and now it's illuminated only by the
 silvery moonlight coming through the window. You can barely make out
 your bookshelf and your closet.

 You can't go that way.

>go south


 (first opening the door to your room)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Eastern End of the Upstairs Hallway</span>
 The eastern end of the upstairs hallway is almost completely dark. To
 the north is the door to your room, and the hallway to the west leads
 to your parents' bedroom and the radio room. You can hear your father
 snoring even here. The main staircase winds down to the front hall,
 and the narrow attic staircase leads up.


>go up


 When you start to climb up the narrow attic stairs, almost on all
 fours, you can see the faint light of the single bulb upstairs. You
 poke your head out of the hatch on the floor, and see the rocket man
 on the other side of the attic. He has the suitcase on his lap.
 Something alerts him, you don't know what, and his head snaps up with
 a click. It takes you a moment to realize that the sound was him
 slamming the case shut.

 After a second he smiles, and whispers quite loudly: "Hello, kid,
 thanks for helping me. Could you sit with me for a while, there's
 something I'd like to ask you." The rocket man opens the suitcase and
 starts tinkering with whatever he has in there.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Attic</span>
 The attic is a cluttered, low space with a slanted roof. It's a scary
 place with dark nooks and crannies, piles of boxes and all kinds of
 weird junk. The only light is a lone bulb that has gone dim and yellow
 with age.

 The rocket man is sitting up in the end of the attic, leaning against
 the wall. The rocket man has peeled off the top part of his suit and
 his shirt, revealing his upper body. He's really pale and also lean,
 like a gymnast.

>tell man about boat


 You can think of a million questions to ask from rocket man, his
 rocket, the martians, his missionâ¦ Before you get any of them out of
 your mouth, the rocket man looks up from his work and smiles at you.

 "So, kid, thanks for not telling your parents about me. I'm on a very
 very secret mission, and nobody but you and me should know about it."
 The rocket man shoots you a stern glance, and you find yourself
 nodding vigorously.

 "Now, then, this is an island if I'm not mistaken. Is there any way
 out here? Like a ship or such? I need to get to Astro City One in a
 hurry!"

>tell man about boat


 "Well, we have this old row boat on the shore. We usually don't go out
 on the sea with it, because it's dangerous." you say. "Old wooden
 boatâ¦" the rocket man rubs his chin and you hear the rasping sound of
 a beard stubble. "You know, kid, that's perfect! That's absolutely
 perfect, if it can stay afloat that is. Just a moment now, I'll have
 to finish with this damn thing." he continues, twisting something
 inside the suitcase.

>examine suitcase


 The rocket man is hunched over the open suitcase. You try to peer
 around the open lid, but you can't see much, only some wires and weird
 stuff you can't make out.

>tell man about ship


 "We have a nice ship which father always takes to the mainland. It has
 a good engine, although father always curses about it." you say. "A
 large ship, with an engineâ¦ with a metal hull, I guess?" the rocket
 man says and raises is eyebrows. You nod. "Ah, that won't do, sorry.
 Don't you have anything smaller?"

>wait


 Time passes.

>wait


 Time passes.

>wait


 Time passes.

>ask man about mission


 "What is your mission, is it about that suitcase?" you ask, with your
 heart beating like crazy. The rocket man bites his lips for a moment
 and glances up at you. "In this suitcase I have some enemy
 intelligence I caught from the... the vile Martians. I need to get
 these to Astro City one as soon as possible."

>ask man about boat


 He seems to be really concentrating on the suit case. You wait for his
 reply, but after a while you start to think that he didn't hear you.

>ask man about man


 "Soâ¦ who are you?" you ask. The rocket man pauses his work for a
 moment. "I'mâ¦ a commando operative. Do you know what that is?" After
 seeing your enthusiastic nod, he continues. "I'm on a very secret
 mission that can define the result of the whole war. I really need
 your help on this, kid"
>ask man about shuttles


 He grunts "Mmm-mm," obviously not listening at you.

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

>wait


 Time passes.

>ask man about mars


 "I bet you have been to Mars!" you say to the rocket man. "What kind
 of a place is it?" The rocket man pauses his work with the suitcase
 for a moment, and looks up. He has a weird expression on his face,
 like he was sad.

 "There's lots of empty space in Mars, these red fields of rock and
 sand. In the seas and the lakes the waves are tens of meters high, and
 much slower than in here. The sky is reddish gray on the daytime, and
 blazes red and violet in the mornings and eveningsâ¦" He falls quiet
 for a moment, and resumes working with the suitcase.

>ask man about earth


 "Astro City One is certainly the greatest place on Earth, isn't it!"
 you say enthusiastically. "Well, I've seen bigger bases. They are in
 zero-G, thoughâ¦" the rocket man mutters while concentrating on
 tinkering with the suitcase. "Where?" you ask, and he seems to snap
 out of his concentration. "Nowhere, never mind."

>tell man about war


 "We have always supported our valiant troops against the vile Martian
 menace!" you say, trying to remember how the man in the radio always
 said it. "Listen, kid. It's a great universe out there, full of all
 kinds of wonders, and we are just shooting at each other? Where's the
 sense in that?" the rocket man says, looking at you sternly. You
 really don't know what to say to that.

>tell man about earth


 "Earth rocket men are really kicking the butts up there in space,
 aren't they!" you say feeling proud to be in the presence of one them.
 "Yeeah, it's quite a scrap up there" the rocket man says.

>tell man about mars


 The rocket man tinkers with his suitcase, nodding and going "hmm-hm".

>tell man about grandfather


 The rocket man tinkers with his suitcase, nodding and going "hmm-hm".

>tell man about city


 The rocket man tinkers with his suitcase, nodding and going "hmm-hm".

>talk to man


 You don't really know what to say. There is a ton of things you'd like
 to ask the rocket man about - like the war, Mars, his mission, and a
 million other things!

>ask man about ware


 He seems to be really concentrating on the suit case. You wait for his
 reply, but after a while you start to think that he didn't hear you.

>ask man about warr


 He grunts "Mmm-mm," obviously not listening at you.

>ask man about war


 "It's great that we have people like you to fight the vile Martians
 who threaten our freedom!" you say. The rocket man is quiet for a
 moment and doesn't look up from his work. "How exactly do they do
 that? From Mars?" he asks, quietly. You get a feeling that you said
 something stupid, but you don't really know why.

 The floor is creaky in that end of the hallway, and you really don't

 The attic is a cluttered, low space with a slanted roof. It's a scary
 place with dark nooks and crannies, piles of boxes and all kinds of

>ask man about mission


 "Why do you need to go to Astro City one?" you ask the rocket man. "I
 told you, to deliver these documents."

 "Okay, that's it." the rocket man says and closes the suitcase with a
 snap. He gets up, grunting and pressing his hand against his side. You
 watch as he pulls on his undershirt, which is some kind of thermal
 space material, and zips up his space suit.

 Getting out of the house is nerve wracking, especially in the attic
 stairs where the clumsy space suit makes all kinds of noise. Luckily
 your father's snoring covers it all up.

 Not even Gogol launches into a barking attack when you go outside.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 The Moon is bright and the sea is calm. The old boat glides to the
 water, and the rocket man starts to row, so clumsily that you just
 have to laugh. He waves at you when he clears the wavebreak, and you
 sit on the concrete ledge to watch him go - and for a small eternity
 until his boat has vanished into the glitter of the moonlight on the
 sea, towards the brightly lit spires of Astro City One in the
 mainland.

 Much later, when you are already shivering with cold and almost in
 tears because the feeling of loss, you start to make your way toward
 the house. It's slow going in the dark - and you're almost to the
 house when the impossibly bright flash and the sound of tearing metal
 in the distance wash over you.


 Please press SPACE to continue.
 Even now, forty years later, you can remember that moment; the instant
 when you stopped being a child and ended up being an adult with a
 horrible burden to bear. When Astro City One went up, it started as a
 couple of bright flashes. The bangs reached you several seconds later,
 right before the blinding flash that sent pieces of fuel filled
 rockets and containers arcing through the sky in fiery fireballs. The
 blastwave of the explosion swept over the sea so fast it was almost
 too quick to see, and the bang almost struck the air out of your lungs
 and made your ears go beep.

 You still remember the moment when you realized that Martians weren't
 tentacled monsters: they were human beings just like you and your
 parents. Humans, who just wanted to live free. That's what they got,
 thanks to one stupid kid. The loss of Astro City one was a huge blow
 to the Earth Alliance, and it turned the tide of the war. In three
 months there was a peace treaty, and Mars had seceded, leaving Earth
 with the burden of reparations for the long years of interplanetary
 war.

 All because of one stupid little kid, who wanted to become a rocket
 man.
