 Rogue of the Multiverse
 by C.E.J.  Pacian

 Great towers rise from the desert, beneath a clear blue sky.  Their
 mirrored sides reflect the afternoon sun through a shimmering heat
 haze.  Specks hover over the city on veined wings or burning jets.

 The klaxon sounds briefly, and your cell door rattles open.

 You've only been in this prison a few days, and you're not confident
 that you'll make it through too many more.

 Cell
 The cracked tiles of your small cell have been defaced by decades of
 graffiti.  The metal door out stands open.

 Springs protrude from your decrepit old bed.

>about
 Welcome to the Imbroglio, human.  Enter simple imperative commands, or
 click on hyperlinks to perform actions.  Type directions to move
 between locations.  You can attempt to interact with any object in your
 current location.

 To read a brief list of the most common commands in this game, enter
 INSTRUCTIONS.  Even experienced players might like to take a quick look
 at the parts about movement and disambiguation.

>examine me
 It's definitely you.  How exactly you wound up in this jail is an
 interesting question.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing, and are wearing an orange uniform.

>examine uniform
 It identifies you as convict #76954, albeit not in human numerals.

>examine bed
 A big, slightly springy mattress suitable for a wide variety of
 species.

>examine graffiti
 A lot of it's in languages you've never even seen before.  You
 recognise some apian gang symbols, some vulgar saurian poetry, and some
 crude drawings of octopodes in coitu.

>examine tiles
 They might have looked nice once, in an institutional kind of way.

>look under mattress
 You see nothing unusual under the bed.

>remove uniform
 It's a cold and uncaring Multiverse out there to be running around
 naked.

>out
 Cell Block X
 Rotating fan vents light this wide corridor with harsh, flickering
 sunlight.

 Orange suited prisoners drift listlessly forwards.

 Saurian guards keep a close eye on the inmates.

>examine guards
 Burly, reptilian bipeds in thick body armour.  From experience you know
 they're just looking for an excuse to use their shock sticks.

>examine prisoners
 Organics and androids, bipeds and octopodes...  Humans are conspicuous
 by their absence.

>exits
 Obvious exits lead in, back to the cell; and forwards.

 (You can control the exit listings with the EXITS command.  EXITS
 STATUS shows the exit list in the status line, EXITS LOOK shows a full
 exit list in each room description, EXITS ON shows both, and EXITS OFF
 turns off both kinds of exit lists.)

>exits look
 The list of exits will not be shown in the status line, and will be
 included in room descriptions.

>look
 Cell Block X
 Rotating fan vents light this wide corridor with harsh, flickering
 sunlight.

 Orange suited prisoners drift listlessly forwards.

 Saurian guards keep a close eye on the inmates.

 Obvious exits: In, Forwards

 Capable of doling out agonising pain and leaving no perceptible marks.

>examine androids
 Many of them lethal killing machines to varying degrees of literalness.

>examine organics
 Generally squishy and full of fluid, just like you, although many have
 exoskeletons.

 A cheap solution to both lighting and ventilation.  That's saurians for
 you.

>f
 Skyway
 A raised skyway between Cell Block X and the rest of the prison tower.
 It provides a view of the endless wasteland you'd have to traverse if
 you even managed to escape.  Wire mesh prevents inmates from throwing
 themselves over the side.

 A burly guard stands watch by the way forwards.

 Two inmates - one saurian, one apian - are dawdling on the skyway.  The
 apian nudges her companion and points at you.  "What's that?"

 He guffaws.  "Ain't you never seen a human before?"

 Obvious exits: Forwards, Backwards

>examine apian
 Her black and yellow exoskeleton has been scrimshawed with elaborate
 gang carvings.

 She looks back at you.  "Oh honey, what juicy eyes you have."

 "Isn't human," the apian says, "like, the other other white meat?"

 "No fur," the saurian muses, looking you up and down, "no exoskeleton
 or scales.  Like a walking buffet."

>examine saurian
 Razor sharp teeth, hungry eyes and green-scaled skin that's stretched
 taut over his muscles.

 He stares back at you.  "What are you looking at, chimp?"

 The guard draws his shock stick.  "Break it up you three.  This isn't a
 social club."

 Your two new friends walk away laughing, the saurian pausing to thump
 you on the back.  "We'll catch you for a bite later, hey pal?"

>forward?
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>f
 Checkpoint
 A number of scanners and drone turrets are arrayed around a low
 platform, overseen by a smiley face on a computer screen.

 The smiley-faced computer assembles a sentence out of painfully
 cheerful soundbites.  "Greetings!  Convict 76954!  Please!  Stand on
 the!  Scanning platform!"

 Obvious exits: Forwards, Backwards

>examine computer
 A simple cartoon face that corresponds to the eye and mouth placements
 of most saurians, apians and lesser octopodes.

>stand on platform
 You stand on the platform.  The scanners begin to whir around you,
 beams tingling over your skin.

 "Thank you!" the computer chirps, "For your!  Co-operation!  Please
 wait...  For the scan to complete..."

>examine platform
 Scuffed by countless feet.

 You are standing on the scanning platform.

 "Scanning..." the computer drones.  "Scanning..."

 Interview Room
 Cosily lit, with a messy noticeboard on one wall.  A narrow desk takes
 up the centre of the room, strewn with notes.  An empty chair is turned
 slightly towards you.

 A saurian in a labcoat sits on the opposite side of the desk.

 A muscular guard blocks the exit.

 Obvious exits: Out

 The saurian smiles, baring her pointed teeth.  "Well, hello!  I'm Dr.
 Sliss.  Are those appendages prehensile?  How wonderful!  Why don't you
 take a seat and we'll begin?"

 Her skin consists of shimmering green scales, and her golden,
 slit-pupil eyes hold a calculating beauty.

 Dr. Sliss is wearing a labcoat, a white blouse, a grey skirt, and red
 shoes.

 "Don't be shy," Dr. Sliss says.  "I won't bite."

>sit
 (on the chair)
 Intended for saurian backsides, the chair is less than comfortable.

 "Now," Dr. Sliss says, "let's get down to business.  Would you start by
 confirming your name?"

>Hunkomeat
 "Hunkomeat!" the doctor repeats cheerfully.  "How barely pronounceable!
 And do you identify as male or female, Hunkomeat?"

 (You could say male, or female.)

>male
 "But of course," the doctor says.  "Now, some questions about your
 medical history.  Please be honest."

 She turns to the first page of her notes.  "Have you ever been exposed
 to more than 200 yegs of radiation?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>no
 The doctor scribbles down your answer.  "I see. Has your head ever been
 detached from its current body?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>no
 The doctor scribbles down your answer.  "If you say so. Have you ever
 had any form of unprotected sex with an entity that exists in more than
 four macroscopic spatial dimensions?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>no
 The doctor scribbles down your answer.  "Really?  You should try it
 sometime. Have your actions ever been controlled by hive-linked cortex
 worms?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>yes
 The doctor scribbles down your answer.  "The fact you can admit it
 proves you've recovered. Now, the following questions attempt to gauge
 your personality.  There are no right or wrong answers, so just relax
 and answer truthfully.  Are you now or have you ever been a member of
 the Apian Individualist Coalition, or AIC?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>no
 The doctor scribbles down your answer.  "That should please the
 bean-counters. Have you ever consumed your own offspring?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>yes
 The doctor scribbles down your answer.  "I certainly don't judge you
 for it. Finally, I see you're serving a life sentence.  Well...  Did
 you do it?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>no
 The doctor scribbles down your answer.  "And I believe you, even though
 there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Well, I'm pleased to say
 that you meet all of the requirements of my research - especially the
 parts that prohibit experiments on fellow saurians."

 She nods to the guard.  "You may shock him now."

 Something cold and metallic touches the back of your neck - and then
 you taste burning and everything goes white.

 (Press space...)








 You're awoken by an unfamiliar beeping sound.  You sit bolt upright and
 look around.

 Holding Cell (sitting on the bed)
 A bare room of white walls.  Strip lights glare down from the ceiling,
 and there's an intercom next to the way out.

 A white, saurian-style bed occupies the middle of the floor.

 Something in the room seems to be beeping.

 Obvious exits: Out

>examine bed
 Raised up off the floor, with a gap in the middle for your tail to go
 through when you're lying on your back.

 It's slightly warm to the touch.

 Something in the room seems to be beeping.

>push button
 Dr. Sliss' voice crackles through the speaker.  "Rise and shine!
 Welcome to the Long Range Matter Transmission Complex!  Isn't this much
 nicer than that nasty prison?  Nobody here is carving makeshift blades
 to stab you with.  As far as I know."

 The door unlocks with a click.

>out
 (first standing up, then opening the door)

 Complex: Lower Level
 An expansive, drab space.  Perhaps a factory floor after the machinery
 has been cleared out.  A catwalk crosses the room above, beneath the
 dusty rays of grubby skylights.

 Dr. Sliss leans over the catwalk railing.

 A number of armed cyborgs look down from the catwalk.

 You can go forward to the antechamber, or back to the holding cell.

 The Doctor waves down at you.  "Do you like your new fashion accessory?
 With that collar, I can always keep tabs on my favourite chimp.  No,
 don't try to remove it - the explosive charge will blow your head off."

 After a moment, she adds, "Also, you might want to keep your distance
 from microwave ovens."

>examine me
 How do you get in these predicaments?

 "Now," Dr. Sliss says with a grin, "why don't you step into the
 antechamber.  There may be a banana in it for you!"

 A leather collar with a small metal box at the throat.

>examine cyborgs
 Members of various sapient species, all wearing black armour.  Their
 brains seem to have been replaced with an exposed mass of wiring and
 tubes.

>examine catwalk
 A narrow catwalk, utilitarian and sturdy.

 Dr. Sliss is standing on the catwalk.

 The cyborgs are standing on the catwalk.

>forward
 Antechamber
 A long, narrow room, the walls bulging with strange pipes and
 machinery.  The most notable feature is the thickly armoured airlock
 door leading further in.  Either side of the airlock are an equipment
 rack and a glass tube.  A more conventional exit leads back out.

 On the equipment rack are a launcher, a scanner, and a retrieval
 beacon.  The glass tube contains an environment suit.

 Obvious exits: In, Out

 You can go forward to the transmission chamber, or back to the complex
 lower level.

 A wall-mounted monitor flickers to life, displaying Dr Sliss' face.

 "Through that airlock is the matter transmission chamber.  You're going
 to be performing a routine, uh, salvage detail on a non-Treaty world.
 Which world?  Who knows, there are millions."

>examine tube
 It's closed, and contains an environment suit.

 Dr Sliss peers around the room from the monitor.  "You'll need all this
 equipment if you want to return in one piece.  Which is not to say that
 our advanced medical facility is unable to cope with multiple pieces,
 but bio-glue doesn't come cheap."

>examine rack
 On the equipment rack are a launcher, a scanner, and a retrieval
 beacon.

>examine launcher
 It looks kind of like a gun, only weirder.

>examine scanner
 A small, ergonomic gizmo with a bright LCD screen.

 The screen is blank.

>examine beacon
 An orange cylinder with RETRIEVAL BEACON stencilled on it.  A thin cord
 protrudes from it with a ring on the end, begging to be pulled.

>get all
 launcher: You sling the launcher over your shoulder.

 "You can use the launcher to tag valuables," Dr. Sliss tells you.  "At
 the end of the mission, anything you've tagged will be matter
 transmitted into one of our five retrieval tanks for salvage."

 After a moment's thought, she adds, "Please note that the Complex has
 an ample supply of bananas.  Do not tag bananas."

 The exit locks with a chunky click.

 scanner: The scanner fits neatly in your palm.

 "The scanner is able to detect points of interest within five
 kitrecks," Dr. Sliss says.  "Go to these points of interest and tag
 anything valuable with the launcher."

 retrieval beacon: You find the beacon adheres somehow to the front of
 your outfit.

 "The beacon is your way home," Dr. Sliss says.  "If everything goes
 wrong, or if you've tagged everything valuable in sight, just pull the
 cord on the beacon and we'll retrieve you whether the mission clock has
 run out or not.  And don't worry if you're too wounded or dismembered
 to pull the cord: the lifesign monitors on your collar will fulfil the
 same function when you're near death."

 environment suit:
 (first opening the glass tube)
 Taken.

 "We don't exactly want you running around the complex with a blast
 launcher," Dr. Sliss adds, "so you'll have to return all the equipment
 before you can leave."

>wear suit
 You step into the suit and fasten the seals.  Your ears pop slightly as
 it pressurises.

 "If something should happen to you," Dr. Sliss explains, "the bright
 yellow colour of the suit will make it easier to retrieve your - uh,
 yourself."

 "That's it," Dr. Sliss says, "you're ready.  Enter the airlock and it's
 nothing but open skies and banana trees from here on."

 Now you've scored a job as a lab rat.  Keep it up!

 Transmission Chamber
 An enormous metal dome lit by the distant floodlights that surround an
 armoured observation window.  A huge antenna aims directly down at you
 from above.

 A metal chair is bolted to the floor.

 An armoured airlock door leads out.

 Obvious exits: Out Dr. Sliss appears at the observation window.

 Her voice booms over a loudspeaker.  "When you're ready to begin the-"
 she clears her throat, "salvage mission, please take a seat.  We'll
 retrieve you when 50 seegols have elapsed, when you activate your
 beacon, or when you're about to die.  Whichever happens first."

>examine chair
 You see nothing unusual about it.

>examine antenna
 It looks like it has a lot of zap.

>examine door
 It's open.

 (on the metal chair)
 You sit on the metal chair.  Restraints clunk into place around your
 wrists and ankles.  "Just relax," Dr. Sliss says.  "I've transmitted
 several warm-blooded organisms and very few experienced anatomical
 inversion."

 Everything begins to glow.

 Dr. Sliss continues, "You may feel a sensation like every molecule in
 your body being forced through a microscopic wormhole like so much
 toothpaste.  Don't be alarmed.  It's merely that this is exactly what's
 happening."

 Everything seems to be growing extremely elongated and distant.  Before
 the whole world disappears with a snap, you hear Dr. Sliss say,
 "Remember!  Tag valuable objects!  Bananas aren't valuable!"

 (Press space...)

 With the sound of billions of molecules snapping into place, you pop
 back into existence - falling some distance to the ground.

 Your watch starts vibrating.  Everything begins to glow.  You feel a
 sensation like being pulled backwards down your own throat.

 You materialise in the matter transmission chamber with a pop, and fall
 flailing to the ground.

 Transmission Chamber (lying on the floor)
 An enormous metal dome lit by the distant floodlights that surround an
 armoured observation window.  A huge antenna aims directly down at you
 from above.

 A metal chair is bolted to the floor.

 An armoured airlock door leads out.

 Dr. Sliss looks down at you from the observation window.

 Obvious exits: Out

 "Welcome home, Hunkomeat," the doctor booms over the tannoy.  "It looks
 like 4 of our retrieval tanks received salvage.  Let's see what you
 tagged..."

 (Press space...)

 Dr. Sliss touches her chin thoughtfully.  "Hey, chimpy-boy, what do you
 say we incentivise you?  I'll give you 10% of the value of everything
 you, ahem, salvage.  It's only fair - you do take at least part of the
 risk."

 "A cheap robot and a load of news articles about another timeline.  I
 don't see the market for it, to be honest."
 [Cash +100]

 "An actual hovercar.  On the one hand: supersonic jet engine.  On the
 other: no seatbelts."
 [Cash +400]

 "An actual hovercar.  On the one hand: supersonic jet engine.  On the

 [Cash +400]

 "A robot that sells elongated packets of cooked offal.  I smell a new
 fast food craze in the offing."
 [Cash +250]

 Then she looks down at you and grins.  "You know, a lot of my subjects
 are gibbering wrecks by this point.  I knew you were a good candidate.
 Why don't you take some time to relax before coming back for your next
 mission?"

>SAVE

 Saved.

 (first standing up)

 Antechamber
 A long, narrow room, the walls bulging with strange pipes and
 machinery.  The most notable feature is the thickly armoured airlock
 door leading further in.  Either side of the airlock are an equipment
 rack and a glass tube.  A more conventional exit leads back out.

 Obvious exits: In, Out, Forwards, Backwards

 You can go forward to the complex lower level, or back to the
 transmission chamber.

 You change out of your environment suit and return your equipment to
 the racks.

 The exit unlocks with a click.

 (first opening the exit)

 Complex: Lower Level
 An expansive, drab space.  Perhaps a factory floor after the machinery
 has been cleared out.  A catwalk crosses the room above, beneath the
 dusty rays of grubby skylights.

 A number of armed cyborgs look down from the catwalk.

 Obvious exits: Forwards, Backwards

 You can go forward to the holding cell, left to the infirmary, right to
 a long corridor, or back to the antechamber.

 Dr. Sliss walks out onto the catwalk overhead.  "I've given you access
 to some of the other areas of the complex," she says.  "Have a look
 around.  Just don't forget to go on missions or I may have to turn you
 into one of these lobotomised cyborgs!"

 She laughs playfully, her pointed teeth glinting in the sunlight.

 Infirmary
 A single white bed stands in the centre of the room, overlooked by an
 expansive observation window.

 A long mechanical arm hangs from the ceiling, ending in the torso of a
 white auto-doc.

 Obvious exits: Out

>examine auto-doc
 An androgynous android with numerous arms ending in advanced medical
 instruments.

 "Wonder if..." the auto-doc begins, trailing off thoughtfully.

>lie on bed
 Okay, you're now lying on the bed.

 The auto-doc orbits the infirmary anti-clockwise.

>wait
 Time passes...

 "Singular airway and oesophagus," the auto-doc notes.  "Choking
 hazard."

>stand
 Okay, you're now standing.

 "Unnecessary organs noted," the auto-doc announces.

 Complex: Lower Level
 An expansive, drab space.  Perhaps a factory floor after the machinery
 has been cleared out.  A catwalk crosses the room above, beneath the
 dusty rays of grubby skylights.

 A number of armed cyborgs look down from the catwalk.

 Obvious exits: Left, Right, Forwards, Backwards

 You can go forward to a long corridor, left to the holding cell, right
 to the antechamber, or back to the infirmary.

 What do you want to get out of?

 Obvious exits lead left; right, to the antechamber; forwards; and
 backwards, back to the infirmary.

 The list of exits will no longer be shown in either the status line or
 room description.

 Antechamber
 A long, narrow room, the walls bulging with strange pipes and
 machinery.  The most notable feature is the thickly armoured airlock
 door leading further in.  Either side of the airlock are an equipment
 rack and a glass tube.  A more conventional exit leads back out.

 On the equipment rack are a scanner, a retrieval beacon, and a
 launcher.  The glass tube contains an environment suit.

 You can go forward to the transmission chamber, or back to the complex
 lower level.

 You don the environment suit and grab your equipment.

 The exit slides shut and locks with a click.

 A number of armed cyborgs look down from the catwalk.

 You can go forward to the holding cell, left to the infirmary, right to

 Corridor
 This functional corridor ends in a thick steel door marked "Exit".  The
 bare concrete floor has been scratched and scored by heavy machinery,
 the breezeblock walls dented and stained.

 A small terminal is fixed to the wall beside the door.

 You can go forward to the emergency exit, left to the bathroom, right
 to the canteen, or back to the complex: lower level.

 Have a nice day.

 Corridor
 This functional corridor ends in a thick steel door marked "Exit".  The
 bare concrete floor has been scratched and scored by heavy machinery,
 the breezeblock walls dented and stained.

 A small terminal is fixed to the wall beside the door.

 You can go forward to the emergency exit, left to the bathroom, right
 to the canteen, or back to the complex: lower level.

 Bathroom
 A utilitarian shower and a saurian toilet, all lit harshly by
 fluorescent lights that emit a sickly hum.

 A voice whispers from the toilet bowl.  "Hey!  Over here!"

>examine toilet
 You peer cautiously into the toilet bowl.  An enormous, seemingly
 eyeless white worm, easily the size of your whole arm, looks back at
 you from within.  "Finally!" the worm says.  "Look, you're not alone in
 this mess.  The name's Sola.  Also known as Test Subject 13, the one
 that got away."

>pee
 The word "pee" is not necessary in this story.

>flush toilet
 You flush the toilet.

 Sola gurgles, "Blub!  You're not getting rid of me that easily."

 "Look," Sola says, "I'm an undercover agent from the Core Alliance.  I
 escaped into the sewer system when that damn saurian scientist started
 to twig, but I need your help."

>examine sola
 A massive white worm, vaguely transparent.  Hir only real features are
 a surprisingly dextrous mouth and the silhouette of hir elongated
 brain.

 "Hey, what's your name, anyway?"  Sola asks.  "Hunkomeat?  I guess you
 need teeth to pronounce that properly."

>tell sola about name
 You chat to Sola for a while, but don't learn anything important.

>ask sola about sliss
 Sola sighs.  "I'm sure Dr. Sliss means well, in her own way.  And
 ultimately it's the government of Dryzandia that should be held
 responsible.  Still, she's a complete whackjob."

>ask sola about dryzandia
 "You're standing on it," Sola says.  "Almost uninhabitable, no valuable
 exports, but they've made a fortune incarcerating prisoners from other
 Treaty worlds.  Not exactly the route to power and prestige though,
 which is probably why they've started pillaging non-Treaty worlds."

>ask sola about treaty
 "The Mutual Defence and Non-Aggression Treaty," Sola says.  "The most
 advanced worlds in the Imbroglio sign up to it to get protection from
 interdimensional bandits and rogue states.  Of course, to remain a
 member there's a minimum standard of conduct."

>ask sola about conduct
 "Treaty worlds have two main obligations," Sola says.  "They have to
 contibute to the military and police forces that protect all Treaty
 worlds - you know, schmucks like me.  And they have to refrain from
 violating the sovereignty of other civilised or pristine worlds,
 whether those worlds are a part of the Treaty or not."

>ask sola about rogue states
 You chat to Sola for a while, but don't learn anything important.

>ask sola about cyborgs
 You chat to Sola for a while, but don't learn anything important.

>ask sola about complex
 You chat to Sola for a while, but don't learn anything important.

>ask sola about me
 You chat to Sola for a while, but don't learn anything important.

>ask sola about sola
 "What's there to know?"  Sola says.  "Pretty typical nematode.  I was a
 cop in the Squirm for a couple of decades, but I got sick of the
 corruption.  I joined the Core Alliance out of some misplaced sense of
 duty, got assigned to the worst undercover job in history, wriggled out
 of my exploding collar and now live down the shitter.  No family back
 home, but thinking of having kids through autogamy - if I ever get out
 of here."

>ask sola about Imbruglio
 You chat to Sola for a while, but don't learn anything important.

>ask sola about collar
 "Easy enough to slip out of it if you don't have any bones," Sola says.
 "Although it did explode shortly after."

>ask sola about Imbroglio
 "That's where you are right now," Sola explains, "and every place
 you've ever been.  The Imbroglio consists of countless worlds, all
 inter-connected across time, space and alternate realities.  The most
 habitable, most interconnected worlds form the Core Alliance.  Most
 other worlds worth a damn are part of the MDANA treaty."

>ask sola about help
 Sola looks around furtively.  "The Core Alliance knows that Dryzandia
 has an unlicensed matter transmitter, but they don't know where, and
 they don't know what it's being used for.  Dr. Sliss is giving you an
 incentive, right?  There's a shopping terminal right next to the exit.
 I need you to buy some common household items for me, so I can assemble
 a makeshift cross-planar quantum packet modulator."

>ask sola about items
 "Okay, listen up," Sola says.  "With a cross-planar quantum packet
 modulator I can contact my superiors without anyone on Dryzandia
 noticing.  I should be able to make one with parts from a holo-gallery
 and a lava lamp.  But I'll need to read up on the theory first."

 Canteen
 Decorated in a homely style - for saurians.  The cactus-print wallpaper
 is peeling and torn.

 Various chairs are scattered around a single long table.

 A brightly coloured food dispenser stands against the wall.

>examine dispenser
 The gaudy advertising copy claims it will combine whatever nutrients
 your biology requires into "palatable" food.  The saurian on the logo
 certainly seems to be enjoying his snake kebab.

 There's a big button smack in the middle of the thing.

 There are those, of course, who say, "Why meddle?  Why pick apart the
 vague beauty of the Multiverse?  Why try to expose mysteries and unlock
 power we are unlikely to use wisely?"

 It is worth noting how many of these naysayers are in their thirties or
 forties.  How many are in their fifties, sixties or even older.
 Because it is precisely the drive of intelligent, questioning minds to
 find out what is true, how things work, to try to unravel the secrets
 of even something as sacred as the living body - it is precisely that
 drive which has enabled them to live to such a ripe old age that they
 can preach nostalgically about more ignorant times.

 Some would suggest that to see a flower as an inscrutable object of
 bright colours is more romantic, more inspiring, than to appreciate its
 inner workings as a complex structure of intricate cells, nourished by
 waves of energy from its nearest stars, part of a complex, changing
 ecosystem and an ancient, unspoken symbiosis.

 As someone with a more thorough grounding in science than art, I cannot
 dispute this view, much as I may feel quite the opposite.  But however
 unromantic the scientist's flower may be, even less appealing is the
 plague; the child who dies in infancy; the cry for help that travels
 too slow.

 If the role of dispelling mystery, crushing fancy and profaning the
 sacred is one to be shunned, I still embrace it, as the alternative is
 far worse still.

 Antechamber
 A long, narrow room, the walls bulging with strange pipes and
 machinery.  The most notable feature is the thickly armoured airlock
 door leading further in.  Either side of the airlock are an equipment
 rack and a glass tube.  A more conventional exit leads back out.

 On the equipment rack are a scanner, a retrieval beacon, and a
 launcher.  The glass tube contains an environment suit.

 You can go forward to the transmission chamber, or back to the complex
 lower level.

 You don the environment suit and grab your equipment.

 The exit slides shut and locks with a click.

 You sit on the metal chair.  Restraints clunk into place around your
 wrists and ankles.  As the transmission machinery hums to life, the
 world elongates into a one-dimensional line - which then disappears.

 soldiers in desert camouflage in the room.  Before you can do or say
 anything, several of the soldiers jump on you.

 (Press space...)

 Prison Van (standing in the restraints)
 Cramped; windowless; the thickly armoured walls are painted regulation
 grey.  Steel chains dangle from the ceiling and tantalisingly open
 doors lead out.

 Dr. Sliss is chained up next to you.  She looks really, really angry.

 An officious looking apian stands before you in desert camouflage.

>examine apian
 A burly apian worker with a battle-scarred exoskeleton and one antenna
 missing.

 The commander is carrying a clipboard and a shock stick.

 "Dr. Sliss," the apian says, "this Core Alliance Enforcement Team is
 arresting you on behalf of the Dryzandian government."

 "I work for the Dryzandian government," Dr. Sliss hisses.

 "Your project is being shut down," the apian continues, "and you are
 being remanded to prison."

 (You could defend Sliss, repudiate her, or say nothing.)

>repudiate sliss
 You tell the enforcer everything terrible you have to say about Dr.
 Sliss.

 Eventually the apian cuts you off.  "Yeah, yeah, she's a mean lady.  I
 get it."

 Dr. Sliss looks hurt.  "Didn't I treat you well?  I gave you credits,
 bananas, verbal encouragement...  Should I have left you in that
 prison?"

 "Convict 76954," the apian goes on.  "Your participation in this
 illegal project has been noted, and Dryzandia has agreed to commute
 your life sentence.  You will finish serving your other consecutive
 sentences at your previous institution."

 (You could defend yourself, or say nothing.)

>defend myself
 You try to argue, but the apian cuts you off.  "I don't wanna hear it."

 "It's not his fault!"  Dr. Sliss shouts.  "Didn't you hear him?  I'm
 the bad guy!  When I get out of these restraints, I'm gonna-"

 The apian touches her shock stick to the doctor's throat.  The saurian
 yelps and then slumps forward.

 The apian sighs.  "Much better."

>examine clipboard
 You can't read it from here, but there are photos of you and Dr. Sliss
 on it.

 The apian is about to leave when Sola squirms into the van.  "Commander
 Zrzh!  Wait!  What are you doing?  Didn't you get my report?  Give
 these two immunity, let them testify against the Dryzandian-"

 The apian shakes her head.  "It's politics, agent Sola.  Do you have
 any idea how many prisoners the Core has sent to Dryzandia over the
 years?  You want them to start sending them back?"

 The commander stomps off.  Sola looks at you sadly for a second, and
 then follows after her.

>cry
 There there.

 Dr. Sliss sobs quietly to herself.  Or is she laughing?  Her tail
 appears with a keyring dangling from its tip, and she stretches lazily.

 "Very few saurians have prehensile tails," the doctor explains as she
 unlocks her chains.  "Which is why cops from other species rarely know
 to restrain them.  Not that I've ever been arrested before.  Much."

 As her restraints fall to the floor, she puts her hands on her hips.
 "Come on: who's the greatest?"

 (You could tell her she's the greatest, or say nothing.)

>tell her she's the greatest
 Dr. Sliss listens to your compliment with pride.  "Don't I know it."

 She unlocks your restraints.  "Naturally, I have an escape plan.  You
 can tag along if you want.  It should halve my chances of getting
 shot."

>tag along
 The word "along" is not necessary in this story.

>out
 The two of you burst out of the prison van.

 Outside the Complex
 Desert sand stretches as far as you can see, mercilessly reflecting the
 harsh sunlight.  The complex itself is a low dome sunken into
 wind-blasted rock.

 The prison van stands beside a road that curves off into the distance.

 Dr. Sliss is standing here in brazen defiance of the Core Alliance.

 An octopode in desert camouflage stands guard beside an apian with a
 plasma blaster.

 Dr. Sliss tail-whips the apian, who collapses into an unconscious heap.

 The octopode charges you with tentacles outstretched!

>kick octopode
 You dodge the octopode's tentacles and punch him in his boneless head.
 Concussed, he falls to the ground unconscious.

 Dr. Sliss picks up the plasma blaster.  "You know, I once paid good
 money to see a human wrestle an octopode, and here you are giving it
 away for free."

>search octopode
 There's nothing unusual in the octopode guard.

 Somewhere nearby, you hear alarmed shouts.

 Dr. Sliss kicks off her heels and sprints forwards towards the complex.
 "Follow me if you wanna live!"

>follow sliss
 You chase after the doctor.  The voices draw nearer.  A few bolts of
 plasma flash overhead.

 Basement Garage
 A dimly lit maze of concrete pillars.  White lines divide the floor
 into empty parking spaces.

 Something sits in one of the spaces, covered in tarpaulin.

 Dr. Sliss is taking cover behind one of the columns.

 She waves you over.  "Get that tarp off!  I'll cover you!"

>remove tarp
 You grab the edge of the tarpaulin and pull... unveiling a sleek red
 vehicle that looks like a jet engine mounted between two huge wheels.

 Dr. Sliss shrugs.  "Yeah, I don't look the type.  But I've always been
 an impulse buyer.  I mean, I bought you, didn't I?"

>yes
 "My dearest, favourite human," the doctor says, "let's talk when we're
 not being shot at."

 "Okay," the doctor says, "you drive, I'll shoot."

>enter vehicle
 You climb onto the jet bike's leather saddle and take a firm hold of
 the handlebars.

 Dr. Sliss gets on behind you, wrapping an arm around your waist.
 "Punch it, Hunkomeat!"

 You fire up the bike's jet engine and roar unsteadily out of the
 garage, plasma bolts flying past you in every direction.


 (Press space...)

 Wasteland Throughway 13 (left lane)
 Black tarmac bisects the sun-bright glare of the desert sand, a thin
 line of darkness that stops only at the boundary to the clear blue sky.

 You're in the saddle of a sleek red jet bike, hurtling forward at
 breakneck speed.

 Dr. Sliss is behind you, one arm tight around your waist, the other
 wielding a plasma blaster.

 "You have ridden a jet bike before, right?"  Dr. Sliss shouts out from
 behind you.  "Accelerate, brake, left, right...  A chimp could do it.
 Which is fortunate."

>SAVE
>cf7
 Saved.

>examine me
 How do you get in these predicaments?

 "Nobody's following us?"  Dr. Sliss says.  "I'm almost disappointed."

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing, and are wearing some pyjamas and a collar.

 With the throaty roar of a personal rocket pack, an Alliance Enforcer
 appears behind you.

 Dr Sliss readies her plasma blaster.  "Me and my big mouth."

>accelerate
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 The enforcer seems to have no trouble keeping pace with you.

 Dr. Sliss yells into your ear.  "Hit the gas!  We've gotta lose our new
 friend!"

>again
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 The enforcer seems to have no trouble keeping pace with you.

 Dr. Sliss aims the plasma blaster and squeezes off a shot at the
 enforcer.

>wait
 Dr. Sliss fires another shot at the enforcer.  "Hold still, damn you!"

>wait
 Dr. Sliss yells into your ear.  "She's gaining on us!  Can't you go any
 faster?"

>accelerate
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 The enforcer seems to have no trouble keeping pace with you.

 Dr. Sliss fires wildly at the enforcer, bolts of plasma churning up the
 tarmac behind you.

>again
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 The enforcer seems to have no trouble keeping pace with you.

 The doctor finally gets off a lucky shot, hitting the enforcer's rocket
 pack.  Straining her wings, the enforcer manages to land in a roll.

 Dr. Sliss whoops and punches the air.  "In your face!"

 You hear a familiar sound - another rocket pack!  This time a saurian
 enforcer is approaching you from behind.

>brake
 The jet engine winds down.

 The enforcer hits the brakes too, narrowly avoiding running into your
 back.

 "Watch out!"  Dr. Sliss shouts.  "He's trying to get alongside us!"

>brake
 The jet engine winds down.

 The enforcer hits the brakes too, narrowly avoiding running into your

 Dr. Sliss yells into your ear.  "Get us out of here!"

>accelerate
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 The enforcer seems to have no trouble keeping pace with you.

 Dr. Sliss turns to fire several shots at the enforcer.  "Back off!"

>accelerate
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 The enforcer seems to have no trouble keeping pace with you.

 Dr. Sliss keep shooting.  "You know, I've never really fired one of
 these before today."

>right
 You steer into the right lane.

 The enforcer sees his chance to accelerate up alongside of you.

 "Eat this!" the doctor screams firing at the enforcer.

>undo
 Taking back one turn: "right".

 Wasteland Throughway 13 (left lane)
 Black tarmac bisects the sun-bright glare of the desert sand, a thin
 line of darkness that stops only at the boundary to the clear blue sky.

 You're in the saddle of a sleek red jet bike, hurtling forward at
 breakneck speed.

 An alliance enforcer riding a rocket pack follows you in the left lane.

 Dr. Sliss is behind you, one arm tight around your waist, the other
 wielding a plasma blaster.

>right
 You steer into the right lane.

 The enforcer sees his chance to accelerate up alongside of you.

 "Eat this!" the doctor screams firing at the enforcer.

>brake
 The jet engine winds down.

 The enforcer slows to keep pace with you.

 A shot from the doctor's plasma blaster hits the enforcer's rocket
 pack, and he suddenly launches up into the sky, exploding at his apex
 like a firework full of jet fuel.

 "I'm sure he'll be fine," Dr. Sliss says.

 "That's it!"  Dr. Sliss says triumphantly.  "They can't have more than
 two rocket packs.  We're home free."

 Along the horizon ahead you can see a row of blinking blue lights.

>accelerate
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 "Okay," Dr. Sliss says, grabbing your shoulders painfully tight.
 "Don't panic!  We can punch through.  Give it all you've got!"

>again
 With a thunderous roar, the afterburner kicks in.  You cling to the
 handlebars with all your strength.

 You ram through between two police cars, saurian cops scattering out of
 your way as the vehicles are tossed to the side.  A few of the cops get
 off shots at you, but you're out of range in seconds.

 "Can I open my eyes now?"  Dr. Sliss asks.  "Alright!  I knew you could
 do it.  Look out!"

 As you thunder down the road at incredible speed, you're hurtling
 towards a billboard on a sharp bend.

>examine billboard
 The bilboard advertises Eggulax, helping saurian women pass
 unfertilised eggs when it's "that time of the year".

 The few seconds you spend reading the advertisement is all that's
 needed to hit it.  Your bike erupts into a bright red explosion,
 incinerating its two passengers in the process.

 Dr. Sliss is behind you, one arm tight around your waist, the other

>brake
 The jet engine winds down.  You slam on the brakes.  The bike's huge
 tyres lock tight, but you keep going, leaving twin streaks of molten
 rubber on the road.

 Dr. Sliss screams and grabs you so tight you can barely breathe.

 And then suddenly you're clear.  You've made it safely around the
 corner and you're racing off down the open road once more.

 Dr. Sliss collapses limply against your back.  "Holy shit, I don't
 think I can take any more of this."

>wait
 Time passes...

 Ahead of you, great towers rise from the desert.

 Dr. Sliss leans over your shoulder to point at a small and shabby tower
 block.  "I don't like our chances of getting far into the city, but we
 should be able to reach my apartment.  From there, well..."

 (Press space...)

 Apartment 4b
 It's... a mess.  Clothes and books are thrown haphazardly on every
 surface, along with circuitboards, tools and spare parts.  Beneath all
 the clutter you can just make out a sofa and an aquarium.

 In the centre of the room is a small platform beneath a
 familiar-looking antenna.

 Dr. Sliss spins around, hands outstretched.  "Of course you're not
 surprised I built one in my spare time, are you?  It should be able to
 safely fire a couple of times.  Before blowing out power across the
 city."

 (You could ask her about the exploding collar, or her plans.)

>ask sliss about collar
 "I suppose I owe it to you not to let your head explode," Dr. Sliss
 says, grabbing a screwdriver from a nearby surface.

 After a little poking and prodding, the collar drops to the floor.

>ask sliss about plans
 She winks.  "Oh, don't worry about me.  I've got somewhere nice lined
 up.  You can come if you want.  I mean, I kind of like you as a test
 subject - maybe even a friend.  Or I can send you off somewhere by
 yourself and you'll never see me again."

>ask sliss about platform
 "It's nice to finally talk to you as if we were equals," Dr. Sliss
 says, "but any second now the cops are going to be bashing down that
 door."

>follow sliss
 Dr. Sliss is right here.

 The doctor looks at her aquarium.  "Let me just get my..."

 Her shoulders slump.  "Great.  I forgot to fucking feed them."

>examine aquarium
 Full of dead fish floating belly-side up.

 Dr. Sliss looks around nervously.  "When you're ready, get on the
 platform."

>take collar
 Taken.

 "By the way," Dr. Sliss says, "call me Lisella.  No, wait, I changed my
 mind.  Keep calling me Dr. Sliss."

>stand on platform
 Okay, you're now standing on the platform.

 Dr. Sliss looks around her apartment and sighs.  "Well, this is it
 then.  Do you want to go where I'm going?"

 (You could say yes or no.)

>yes
 She tries not to smile too widely as she works the controls to her
 homemade matter transmitter.  "Oh really?  Well, for what I have in
 store next, I think we should be equal partners.  Almost equal
 partners.  Sixty-forty my way.  Seventy-thirty.  We'll negotiate."

 With a hop and a skip, Dr. Sliss jumps onto the platform with you, and
 you feel the familiar sensation of being beamed through time, space and
 alternate realities.

 (Press space...)








 Today's the day of the big demonstration.  Of course you'll turn up.
 What you'll do once you get there is another question.

 Dirigible Station
 A raised platform surrounded by a precarious railing.  From here you
 can look out across smoking chimneys and slate tiled roofs, or watch
 airships churn stubbornly into the rain-shrouded sky.

 A cable car can take you down to the streets.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing, and are wearing a top hat and a three-piece
 suit.

>examine hat
 You'd think a world with headwear like this would have taller doorways.

>examine suit
 It actually has a lot more than three pieces.  You think you've
 remembered them all.

 From luxury liners to ragtag cutters.

>examine roofs
 Once black, now coloured into smeary spectra of soot, mould and bird
 crap.

>examine cable car
 Rusted and well used, but otherwise mostly stable.

>go down
 You ride the cable car down to street level.

 Bustling Street
 The city's streets are crowded and narrow - horse-drawn carriages
 competing for space with steam-powered automobiles, and human
 pedestrians flooding the gaps in between.

 The neoclassical face of the Royal Academy rises above the red-brick
 offices either side, its open doors leading in.

 Big marble pillars trying to look much older than they are.

 The word "duck" is not necessary in this story.

 Royal Academy Lecture Theatre
 Rows of seats descend towards a raised stage.  A pair of cages stand on
 the stage, surrounded by machinery that crackles with electricity.

 Dr. Sliss stands on the stage, trying to lecture on matter transmission
 theory.

 An audience of gentlemen in top hats chatter loudly amongst themselves,
 mostly about "the lizard woman".

>examine cages

 imprisonment.

 Dr. Sliss sighs with relief and shoots you a grateful smile.

 "My loyal assistant," Dr. Sliss yells at the disinterested crowd, "will
 now demonstrate the practical application of the theory I've
 discussed."

 She hustles you quickly into one of the cages and works the controls of
 her machinery.  The cages begin to pop and ripple.  You experience a
 familiar sensation, and then a blinding flash.

 (Press space...)

 You appear in the opposite cage with a resounding pop.  The audience
 stares at the stage open-mouthed.

 "Gentlemen," Dr. Sliss says, with a predatory smile, "I know that in
 your eyes I am a mere reptile - and worse still: a woman.  But what

 jet bike and tumbles down onto the road in a roll.

 Dr. Sliss looks back for a few seconds, and then reassures you, "She's

 It's been quiet, this past year, but after what you've been through you
 don't mind so much.  It's spring once again now, and time to plough
 your fields.

 Road to the Farm
 The morning sun is low in the sky.  Along the horizon are the shattered

 Some of them apparently snapped in half by some terrible force.

 Farm Border
 A rickety wooden fence denotes the edge of the farmland.  The fields
 lie a short way ahead.

 A massive industrial farmbot waits here.

 The farmbot activates with a brief warning klaxon, and stands
 unsteadily on four hydraulic legs.

>examine farmbot
 Badly rusted, its paint almost entirely peeled off, but careful
 maintenance has kept it running well.

>wait
 Time passes...

>ride farmbot
 That's not a vehicle.

>climb on farmbot
 You can't stand on that.

 Field
 A large square of exposed earth, the fertile soil interrupted in one
 corner by the huge rusting skull of a fallen warbot.

 Ahead is the small dome of the farmhouse.

 The farmbot lowers its plough, and tries to get its bearings with
 long-broken proximity sensors.  You carefully guide it around the field
 until the ground has been neatly tilled.  By the time you're done, the
 noon sun beats down on you mercilessly.

>examine skull
 Whether it was decapitated, or the rest of it is buried underground,
 you may never know.

>f
 Outside the Farmhouse
 A small, broken dome, the largest cracks thatched over.  Ivy clings
 valiantly to its smooth sides.  Cheerful voices emerge from further in.

 The farmbot stomps after you.

 You catch Old Man Cadan on his way out.  "Alright my ansum," he says.
 "Best I warn thee the schoolmarm's on the warpath.  Scarin' the
 chillurn wi' your stories o' bee people an' nasty Dr. Stick, she
 reckons."

 He starts to leave, and then pauses.  "Now me, I be rememberin' you
 turnin' up near a year ago in your strange clothes, with those comical
 stories 'bout you fallin' out the sky.  You've settled in quite
 nice-like, but I reckon there's something different 'bout you, and that
 ain't no bad thing."

 He strolls off, whistling to himself.  "Don't go losin' that
 specialness, y'hear?"

>f
 You head inside the dome to face up to the schoolmarm's scorn, and
 partake of Mama Gwen's freshly made lunch; to tell stories of
 high-speed jet bike chases to fascinated children, while your
 wide-eyed, eavesdropping sweetheart pretends to be doubtful or
 unimpressed.

 Your days of hopping from world to world are over.  You'll never again
 find strange treasures or be torn limb from limb by strange monsters
 only to be glued back together.  Like almost everyone in the Imbroglio,
 you're stuck on just one world, with people you've grown to love and
 hate.

 Yours is the wistful happiness of the adventurer who lived to tell the
 tale.
