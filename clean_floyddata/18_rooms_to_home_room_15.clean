 18 Rooms to Home is a serialized game that begins at the end.

 As each update is released, the story will move further back in time -
 so the first release includes room 18, the second will include room 17
 and 18, the third includes 16, 17, and 18, and so on. All released
 rooms are available at [<a href=".">LINK</A>]

 This release is Room 15. This is a long way into Yesenia's journey,
 but it's just a short way into yours.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 By the time the school group winds into the gift shop, Yesenia feels
 like she's hidden around every corner in the entire zoo, and a fog of
 irritation completely obscures her worry. It's easy to be irritated
 with Rachel under any circumstances, but Rachel's really outdone
 herself with this wild goose chase.

 In short order, the school group emerges from the gift shop and heads
 toward the parking lot. Yesenia trails at a safe distance, rolling her
 suitcase along.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Santa Barbara Zoo, Parking Lot</span>
 This secluded part of the parking lot is reserved for buses and other
 oversized vehicles, such as the Washington Elementary school bus
 parked near a red-flowered bush. A thin curtain of trees separates the
 black asphalt from the train tracks and Highway 101 beyond that.

 Yesenia parks herself and her suitcase behind a convenient minivan,
 where she ought to be fairly well hidden from the school group.

 The most important little girl in the whole world is here.

 The second graders mill around the parking lot, herded rather
 ineffectively by a bespectacled teacher.

>examine girl

 Brigit is shorter than most of the other second graders, but no less
 rambunctious, as reported by the grass stains on her pants (and who
 but Rachel would dress a second grader in seashell pink pants?) Her
 huge black eyes match Rachel's, and the shape of her mouth is
 Gerald's, but that never mattered to Yesenia.

 Brigit remains oblivious to her mother's presence.

 The kids scatter forward across the parking lot, laughing and shoving.

>inventory

 Yesenia glances to the side and confirms that she still has her
 suitcase.

 The teacher says, "This way to the bus!"

>examine rachel

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.

>examine teacher

 The teacher's bright red cat eye glasses might correct her vision, or
 they might just be for fashion's sake. If the first, Yesenia can
 sympathize, though her own vision is perfect these days.

 The teacher says in a harried tone, "The sooner everyone gets on the
 bus, the sooner we get home."

>who is rachel

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine glasses

 Yesenia inspects the bright red cat eye glasses, but there's nothing
 unusual about them.

 The teacher finally corrals her students into some semblance of order.

>examine students

 The kids are far more interested in playing hide-and-seek between the
 cars than in getting onto the bus.

 Led by their teacher, the kids approach the bus.

 The red-flowered bush on the edge of the parking lot rustles sharply.
 Yesenia recognizes it as a firebush, and she has just enough time to
 think <span class="floydstyle em">Do those even grow around here?</span> before a woman dressed
 in white and lilac spandex steps out of the red-flowered bush.

 Yesenia recognizes the new arrival at once, though Eichhornia Cress -
 aka The Hyacinth - rarely leaves Florida. As she braces for trouble,
 Yesenia takes back everything she's been thinking about Rachel.

>examine bush

 Yesenia glances at the red-flowered bush, but there's no help to be
 had from that direction.

 The Hyacinth positions herself between the school group and the bus.
 There's nothing particularly scary about her white and lilac costume,
 but her body language is clear enough.

 The teacher halts, extending an arm to keep her students back. "Excuse
 me," she says. "You're in our way."

>intervene

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>talk to hyacinth

 Abandoning the cover of the minivan, Yesenia says to the Hyacinth,
 "I'm warning you. Leave these children alone."

 The teacher's gaze flickers toward the zoo gates, and Yesenia looks
 back to see the other school group approaching.

 The Hyacinth pulls a translucent ball from somewhere in her cloak and
 brandishes it. It doesn't look threatening, but her stance says it's a
 weapon.

 Brigit exclaims, "Mommy! What are you doing here?"

 The teacher claps her hands sharply for her students' attention.
 "Everyone on the bus, NOW!"

>take ball

 Yesenia reaches for The Hyacinth's translucent ball, but The Hyacinth
 pulls it quickly out of reach.

 The teacher raises a hand, signalling the other school group to stay
 back.

 One of the students pulls out a smartphone and starts filming the
 action.

 The Hyacinth whips around and hurls the ball at Yesenia. It strikes
 the ground at her feet and explodes into yellow smoke.

 Yesenia throws up a protective aura automatically. Sunlight blazes
 around her, and the yellow particles veer away harmlessly.

 Brigit claps her hands for joy. "Get her, Mommy!" she shouts.

 A second grader protests, "We can't get on the bus! The door is
 closed!"

>focus on hyacinth

 Yesenia seizes the sunlight and translates the energy into force. She
 clamps that force around The Hyacinth, paralyzing the other woman.

 The teachers with the other school group retreat to the zoo gates.
 Yesenia breathes out; she won't be juggling a second set of civilians.

 The teacher pushes through her students to hammer on the bus door.
 "Open up!" she shouts through the safety glass, jolting the driver
 into wakefulness.

>hit hyacinth

 Yesenia can't keep the Hyacinth pinned in sunlight and attack her at
 the same time. If the Hyacinth were more amenable to being pinned, it
 would be one thing - but she's actively fighting Yesenia.

 Outside the zoo gates, one of the other teachers raises a cell phone
 and starts filming the action. Yesenia grits her teeth.

 The yellow smoke dissipates.

 The bus driver pulls the bus door handle, and the bus door swings
 open.

 Brigit hesitates at the bus door. "Are you going to be okay?"

 Yesenia says, "I'm going to be <span class="floydstyle em">fine</span>. Do what your teacher
 says, now. I love you always."

 The teacher orders, "Everybody in! Find a seat quickly and sit down."
 It's clear from her tone that she means business.

 The second graders form a ragged line at the bus door and then start
 piling in.

 The Hyacinth's cape emits an electric snap, and Yesenia's focus drains
 away.

 The Hyacinth says, "I've seen your face, Sun Queen. And I've seen the
 face of your daughter, Brigit Bhalla. I will make you more sorry than
 you can imagine."

>hit hyacinth

 Yesenia pivots toward The Hyacinth and reaches out to throw the other
 woman.  The Hyacinth dodges out of the way with reasonable grace.

 The air brightens around Yesenia - not a full protective aura, which
 would quickly exhaust her, but enough to give her confidence.

 There's a small crowd growing by the zoo gates, probably drawn by
 Yesenia's pyrotechnics.

 The Hyacinth starts to say something else, but her words are cut off
 by the sudden blast of the bus horn.

 Brigit tries to run toward Yesenia, but The Hyacinth intercepts, and
 the girl has to retreat.

>talk to Brigit

 Yesenia calls to Brigit, "Listen to your teacher!"

 The bus driver hits the horn again and waves his cell phone at The
 Hyacinth, who responds with language most parents wouldn't want their
 second-graders to use.

>ask hyacinth about brigit

 (<span class="floydstyle em">To speak with someone, use the command TALK TO.)</span>

 The school bus starts with a rumble as the students continue to board.

 The Hyacinth moves forward, but the students are too close to the bus,
 and she can't cut between them.

 The teacher moves to block The Hyacinth. "Please don't come near the
 children," she raps out.

>get brigit

 Yesenia steps in front of Brigit, shielding her from The Hyacinth with
 her own body.

 The bus driver leans out the door to shout at Brigit, "Come on, you
 got to get on the bus!"

 The Hyacinth scowls, "The Sun Queen in California?"

 Yesenia says, "They have sunlight here too."

 Brigit starts moving reluctantly toward the bus.

>focus on hyacinth

 Yesenia focuses the sunlight around The Hyacinth again, trapping her
 like a bug in amber.

 Brigit clambers hastily onto the bus.

>focus on hyacinth

 Yesenia focuses more sunlight on The Hyacinth.

 The second graders finish piling into the bus. Brigit climbs in last,
 followed by the teacher, and the closing bus door cuts off Yesenia's
 view.

 The Hyacinth's cape emits another electrical snap, and Yesenia loses
 control of the sunlight around The Hyacinth again.

>focus on hyacinth

 Yesenia focuses sunlight around The Hyacinth again.

 The school bus shifts into gear and pulls out of its spot.

 Sirens sound in the distance, rapidly growing closer.

>release hyacinth

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>hit her

 Yesenia can't keep the Hyacinth pinned in sunlight and attack her at
 the same time.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus pulls out of the parking lot, and Yesenia laughs with
 relief.

 The Hyacinth's cape crackles and snaps, and the sunlight drains away.
 But The Hyacinth isn't interested in fighting - she flees across the
 parking lot, heading for a snow white Camaro. She's gone seconds
 later.

 Yesenia doesn't pursue. She's not supposed to be doing this any more -
 and she doesn't want to be around when those sirens arrive.

>SAVE

>go south

 Yesenia doubles back to grab her suitcase and then takes off.

 Palm trees shadow Yesenia as she heads south toward Ninos Drive.
 There's a bus stop at the zoo entrance, but the sirens are closer
 every second, so she keeps moving south until she reaches Cabrillo
 Boulevard.

 The 14 Montecito arrives across the street - but she can't cross the
 street until the traffic clears, and by then, the bus is pulling away.
 She comforts herself with the thought that it wasn't the right bus
 anyway, and she trots across the crosswalk to join the tourists.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 Tourists move down the steps toward Cabrillo Pavilion in long waves,
 unconsciously mimicking the ocean beyond. Yesenia loiters awkwardly at
 the sidewalk's edge and pretends to be fascinated by the fat little
 palm trees, the blue sign reading ZOO with its arrow, or anything else
 that will keep her face away from pedestrians.

 Yesenia turns at the distant roar of a bus. The familiar white body
 with its upper yellow stripe comes around the bend, and she reads 20
 Carpinteria with relief. The crowd at the bus stop shuffles around,
 and Yesenia queues up to board, hauling the flowered suitcase behind
 her as she climbs the steps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">20 to Carpinteria</span>
 It's like any other MTD bus: bluish-gray plastic seats crowded with
 passengers, huge windows, and an array of silver poles and black
 straps for standing passengers. No one's standing right now, though.

 The driver taps the fare box and gives Yesenia a meaningful look.

 Yesenia braces her suitcase against her leg.

>pay

 Yesenia digs hurriedly through her pockets and comes up with two
 crumpled singles.

 Yesenia flattens the two singles against the fare box and then feeds
 them into the machine. The fare box chimes its approval.

 The driver says, "No change," and points at the sign that says the
 same thing.

 Yesenia says, "That's fine," and she hefts her suitcase and moves
 further in so the next person can pay. There are still a few seats
 free: one at the front behind the driver (occupied by a newspaper),
 one in the middle across from the rear door, and one at the very back.

>take paper

 Yesenia picks up the folded newspaper.

 The last two passengers pay and board.

>sit at the back

 Yesenia takes the back seat.

 The bus pulls away from the curb.

>hide behind newspaper

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine paper

 It's a folded copy of the Santa Barbara News-Press. Yesenia could see
 the articles if she unfolds it.

 The bus picks up speed as it chugs along.

>unfold paper

 Yesenia unfolds the newspaper fully and holds it in front of her face.
 Since she's sitting in the back, she only has to angle her body and
 raise the newspaper to hide her face entirely. That worked out well.

 A portly man in his mid-forties opens up his iPad and starts listening
 to the news. Yesenia can tell that he's listening to the news because
 he's not using headphones, in clear violation of the bus policy sign.

>read paper

 Yesenia skims the newspaper, but she doesn't really want to read about
 the Relay for Life fundraising success. It's too depressing.

 The iPad says, "There was a disturbance today at the Santa Barbara
 Zoo, when a masked woman confronted a group of schoolchildren. KEYT
 reporter Vanessa Ellis is on the scene. Vanessa, over to you."

 Yesenia's heart drops like a brick. If there's footage....

 The bus rumbles through a pothole.

>focus on ipad

 If only she could! But the man's holding his iPad out of the sunlight,
 to avoid glare on the screen.

 The iPad says, "Thank you, Brandon! I'm at the Santa Barbara Zoo,
 where a group of schoolchildren were about to board their bus when a
 masked woman attempted to take them hostage."

 The bus slows down before entering a traffic circle.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Witnesses describe the woman as five-five, dressed in
 white and lavender, with a crown of flowers in her hair. The pending
 catastrophe was averted when a hero in street clothes intervened,
 giving students and teachers a chance to escape."

 The bus swings majestically out onto Coast Village Road.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "One of the teachers, Katie Edwards, captured part of
 their encounter. We'll show you that footage now."

 The bus pulls to a stop in accordance with traffic regulations.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad marvels, "Will you look at that!"

 The bus rumbles back into motion.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "It's quite an impressive sight." After a pause, it
 continues, "Judging by the sunglow, this was Soleil the Sun Queen. But
 she's never been seen on the west coast, and her unmasked appearance
 has never been captured on film. The Sun Queen is one of the Rain
 King's protégés, but his press secretary has not yet released a
 statement."

 The bus picks up speed as it merges onto the freeway.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Anthony Torres was here with his daughter, and they
 saw the entire exchange. Anthony, were you able to identify the
 villain?"

 Despite the air conditioning, several of the windows are cracked open,
 and there's enough wind to whip Yesenia's hair across her face.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "It was The Hyacinth. I'm sure of it. I study these
 things. She normally stomps around Miami, but she's come to California
 for some reason."

 The bus exits the freeway and turns left over the bridge.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "What about the woman who stopped the attack?"

 The bus stops to pick up a few more passengers and then rumbles back
 into motion.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad answers, "She was the Sun Queen. I'm sure of it. I bet she
 followed The Hyacinth here from Florida. There must be something big
 going down."

 The manicured lawns of Toro Canyon pass the bus windows and vanish
 again.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says in a little kid's voice, "It was pretty scary."

 A recorded voice announces, "Real and Sandpiper," and the bus stops to
 let the heavyset woman off before lurching back into motion.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Thank you, Anthony. Brandon, back to you."

 Yucca and palms and carefully clipped shrubbery yield to the
 fantastically painted bridge railing outside Kim's Market.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Let's look at the current state of the Santa Barbara
 County oil spill."

 The bus has reached Carpinteria proper, and the bus begins to empty as
 more people get off at each stop.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "Kevin Reese Dolman, aka Surgical Strike, has publicly
 repented his act of terrorism and joined the cleanup efforts alongside
 Angelina Manatee. More than 44% of the coastline is now clear, thanks
 primarily to the efforts of regular volunteers."

 Yesenia sees her stop coming up, and she presses the yellow strip. The
 bus chimes and announces, "Stop requested."

>wait

 Time passes.

 The iPad says, "When asked about the experience of working with her
 former nemesis, Manatee said...." but the bus rolls to a stop, and
 Yesenia misses the sound bite as she heads for the door.

 Yesenia hefts her suitcase down from the bus. It's about three minutes
 from the bus stop to her apartment, and she takes the distance
 briskly, stopping only once to shove windblown hair out of her eyes.

 About halfway there, she realizes that she doesn't have her purse.
 <span class="floydstyle em">¡Carajo!</span> She tries to think back to when she last had it, and
 she realizes it must have been in the restaurant office. She'll have
 to ask Camilla for a ride once she gets home.

 There's an easy cut across the grass, but Yesenia takes the sidewalk
 instead, with the suitcase rolling along behind her. She rounds the
 corner of the building and starts up the front walk.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tradewind Apartments - Front Walk</span>
 A wide concrete walkway leads around the three-story building and up
 to the front door, flanked by ground lights on both sides, which shine
 in response to the setting sun. On the right, regimentally spaced palm
 trees provide an illusion of privacy for the west-facing windows. On
 the left, there's a parking lot for the apartment, but since the
 divider is all of six inches wide, the parked cars in the first row
 rest their noses against the walkway.

 Yesenia parks her suitcase beside the building's front door.

 There's a bank of resident mailboxes set into the outer wall, just to
 the right of the front door. The doorbells are on the other side.

>examine cars

 Yesenia briefly scans the cars with an uninterested eye. She notes
 Camilla's battered white coupe parked two rows back.

>examine camaro

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.

>open mailbox

 The mailbox is locked.  Yesenia will have to unlock it first.

>focus on mailbox

 Shielded from sight by the building and a palm tree, Yesenia stretches
 her awareness to the setting sun. The orange light warms her, just as
 it warms the mailbox.

 The sun has power over the mailbox; its heat can make the metal
 expand. Its absence can make the metal shrink. And <span class="floydstyle em">she</span> has
 power over....

 Yesenia focuses. The tumblers click into the unlocked position, and
 she pulls it open.

>take all from mailbox

 Yesenia pulls the mail out of her mailbox. Among the advertisements
 and junk mail (promptly discarded into a convenient recycling bin),
 she discovers three white envelopes.

>examine first envelope

 According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara
 three days ago.

>open it

 Yesenia rips open the first envelope, revealing a letter.

>read letter

 (the first letter)
 Yesenia unfolds the first letter.

 It's typed in simple serif letters.

 <span class="floydstyle em">We need to talk. Call me - </span>

 and a number that Yesenia doesn't recognize. There's a 305 area code,
 though, and that's the Miami area.

>examine second envelope

 According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara
 two days ago.

>open it

 Yesenia rips open the second envelope, revealing a letter.

>read second letter

 (the second letter)
 Yesenia unfolds the second letter.

 It's typed in simple serif letters.

 <span class="floydstyle em">I'm trying to help you. You don't have to hide from me.</span>

>examine third envelope

 According to the postmark, this envelope was mailed from Santa Barbara
 one day ago.

>open it

 Yesenia rips open the third envelope, revealing a letter.

>read third letter

 (the third letter)
 As Yesenia unfolds the letter, a playing card falls to the ground.

 At the sight of it, Yesenia's stomach clenches, and goose bumps
 prickle across her shoulders.

 It's typed in simple serif letters.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Call me, or I'm coming to see you</span>.

>take card. x it

 Yesenia picks up the playing card.

 It's a standard playing card: paper coated with plastic, with a blue
 design on the back.

 Yesenia turns it over. As she expected, it's the Jack of Spades -
 which means the Jack of Shadows.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Chris</span>, she thinks, and glances around apprehensively. Is
 Chris already here? She always drives, because she hates the bus
>search cars

 Yesenia can't see inside, since the parked cars is closed.

>examine cars

 Yesenia scans the parking lot again, taking her time. She doesn't know
 what Chris is driving these days, but she knows it'll be a cut above
 the norm.

 And it is - a sleek, matte black car with a T-shaped logo on its nose,
 sitting three cars down and barely a centimeter off the walkway. The
 large black crystals hanging off the rearview mirror seal her
 suspicions.

>focus on crystals

 Yesenia considers the black crystals. The sun is touching them, and
 she's in the sunlight, but... what could she do with them, except
 damage the car? There are easier ways to damage the car.

>examine bin

 The convenient recycling bin is full of advertisements and junk mail.

 In the blue recycling bin are some advertisements.

>open black car

 It seems to be locked.

>examine ads

 Yesenia glances at the top advertisement in the recycling bin, but she
 doesn't need half-off the second kid's sundae after purchasing one at
 full price.

>kick black car

 Yesenia takes a deep, centering breath and then slams her foot into
 the black car's front bumper. She's reserving her strength; after all,
 there's no need to punt it across the parking lot, and there would be
 awkward questions if she did.

 The car launches an strenuous protest, flashing its lights wildly,
 shrilling an alarm, and honking its horn - not polite little beeps,
 but bewildered, angry blares. If Chris is anywhere around, that should
 get her attention.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

 There's a sudden clatter from the apartment building, and then Chris
 explodes from within.

 Chris is tall and well-coiffed, as always, but her brown eyes are wide
 with rage, and if she has a perfect manicure today, it's concealed by
 her clenched fists. "What the hell are you doing? What the
 <span class="floydstyle em">hell</span> are you doing to my <span class="floydstyle em">car</span>?"

 "Getting your attention," Yesenia says. "It seems to have worked."

 (<span class="floydstyle em">To speak with Chris, TALK TO CHRIS.)</span>

>talk to chris

 Yesenia says, "What are you doing here?"

 Chris says, "You don't belong here. I came to bring you back."

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia says, "You're not welcome, Chris. It's time for you to go."

 Chris shakes her head. "Jack. Call me who I am, and remember who you
 are."

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia says, "Sending creepy letters is not the way to open a
 conversation. Especially when I've been <span class="floydstyle em">gone</span> for a week."

 Chris says in a reasonable tone, "Well, I didn't know you were gone."

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia says, "You need to leave. Now."

 Instead of answering, Chris glances west to the setting sun. It's so
 familiar a gesture that it makes Yesenia's heart ache, and for a
 second she even forgets what it means. But Chris is the Jack of
 Shadows....

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia says, "I gave enough of my life away. I'm done."

 Chris says, "You can't ever be done. That's what it means, to be what
 we are."

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia says, "The eastern seaboard got by for some two hundred years
 without me. It can do it again."

 Chris says, "Those were more innocent times. You can't turn your back
 on responsibility."

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia says, "If you did something to Camilla, you will regret it. I
 mean that more than I have ever meant anything."

 Chris says, "So that's her name." She smiles faintly. "Pretty."

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

>talk to chris

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

 The setting sun slips beneath the trees, and both women are immersed
 in the shadows stretching across the parking lot.

 Chris says, "I'm sorry it had to be this way," and she thrusts a hand
 toward Yesenia.

 Yesenia dodges down the walkway, but she's too slow. The air itself
 catches her in a vice grip, and she's dragged across the concrete to
 fall at Chris's feet.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia opens her mouth to snarl defiance, but Chris tightens her
 invisible grip, and Yesenia's words abate into coughing and the
 struggle to breathe.

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

 Chris turns to stare at the damage to her front bumper. "That really
 wasn't necessary," she says.

>talk to chris

 Yesenia opens her mouth to snarl defiance, but Chris tightens her
 invisible grip, and Yesenia's words abate into coughing and the
 struggle to breathe.

 The sleek black car flashes its lights, honks its horn, and shrills
 for help.

 The sound of conversation drifts up the walk, and Chris spins to look.
 No one's in view yet, but someone's clearly coming.

 "We can't stay out here," she mutters, and the grip of air pulls
 Yesenia upright like a doll. "In we go."

 As an afterthought, Chris grabs Yesenia's suitcase on her way into the
 building.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 Tradewinds has always been Yesenia's refuge from the tourist-laden
 town. Yesenia likes how her neighbors don't trade rumors, or complain
 about odd noises, or speculate about Camilla's actual profession. But
 right now, a little more nosiness would be nice, because there's no
 one in the lobby and no one in the hallway.

 Yesenia seethes as Chris hauls her into the elevator, and she
 continues to seethe as Chris hauls her out again on the third floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tradewinds Apartments - Hallway</span>
 During the day, the hallway's cool shadows provide relief from the
 California sun. But at night, it's simply dark, because the scattered
 wall sconces aren't close enough or bright enough to provide decent
 illumination. It couldn't be a better environment for the Jack of
 Shadows if someone had planned it that way. Even by day, Chris's power
 would wax in a place like this, and Yesenia tastes despair at the
 thought.

 The door of Yesenia's apartment stands wide open. There's a folded
 note taped to it.

 Yesenia can also see Chris here.

>read note

 Yesenia rolls her eyes toward the folded note. It looks rather odd
 from this angle.

 Chris drags Yesenia across the threshold of her own apartment.

 A serialized work of interactive fiction. by Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 150827 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)


 18 Rooms to Home is a serialized game that begins at the end.

 As each update is released, the story will move further back in time -
 so the first release includes room 18, the second will include room 17
 and 18, the third includes 16, 17, and 18, and so on. All released
 rooms are available at [<a href=".">LINK</A>]

 This release is Room 15. This is a long way into Yesenia's journey,
 but it's just a short way into yours.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 By the time the school group winds into the gift shop, Yesenia feels
 like she's hidden around every corner in the entire zoo, and a fog of
 irritation completely obscures her worry. It's easy to be irritated
 with Rachel under any circumstances, but Rachel's really outdone
 herself with this wild goose chase.

 In short order, the school group emerges from the gift shop and heads
 toward the parking lot. Yesenia trails at a safe distance, rolling her
 suitcase along.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Santa Barbara Zoo, Parking Lot</span>
 This secluded part of the parking lot is reserved for buses and other
 oversized vehicles, such as the Washington Elementary school bus
 parked near a red-flowered bush. A thin curtain of trees separates the
 black asphalt from the train tracks and Highway 101 beyond that.

 Yesenia parks herself and her suitcase behind a convenient minivan,
 where she ought to be fairly well hidden from the school group.

 The most important little girl in the whole world is here.

 The second graders mill around the parking lot, herded rather
 ineffectively by a bespectacled teacher.

>examine girl

 Brigit is shorter than most of the other second graders, but no less
 rambunctious, as reported by the grass stains on her pants (and who
 but Rachel would dress a second grader in seashell pink pants?) Her
 huge black eyes match Rachel's, and the shape of her mouth is
 Gerald's, but that never mattered to Yesenia.

 Brigit remains oblivious to her mother's presence.

 The kids scatter forward across the parking lot, laughing and shoving.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher says, "This way to the bus!"

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher says in a harried tone, "The sooner everyone gets on the
 bus, the sooner we get home."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher finally corrals her students into some semblance of order.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 Led by their teacher, the kids approach the bus.

 The red-flowered bush on the edge of the parking lot rustles sharply.
 Yesenia recognizes it as a firebush, and she has just enough time to
 think <span class="floydstyle em">Do those even grow around here?</span> before a woman dressed
 in white and lilac spandex steps out of the red-flowered bush.

 Yesenia recognizes the new arrival at once, though Eichhornia Cress -
 aka The Hyacinth - rarely leaves Florida. As she braces for trouble,
 Yesenia takes back everything she's been thinking about Rachel.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The Hyacinth positions herself between the school group and the bus.
 There's nothing particularly scary about her white and lilac costume,
 but her body language is clear enough.

 The teacher halts, extending an arm to keep her students back. "Excuse
 me," she says. "You're in our way."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher's gaze flickers toward the zoo gates, and Yesenia looks
 back to see the other school group approaching.

 The Hyacinth pulls a translucent ball from somewhere in her cloak and
 brandishes it. It doesn't look threatening, but her stance says it's a
 weapon.

 The teacher says to the second graders, "I need you to go back to the
 zoo gates. All of you. Right now."

>examine hyacinth

 Yesenia gives The Hyacinth a once over. The other woman is dressed in
 white and lilac spandex, cut to expose her toned arms and well-shaped
 calves, and there's a crown of water hyacinths woven into her long,
 blond hair. She also, of course, has a mask. And a cape. With a
 glittery flower pattern.

 This is hardly the first time they've been in the same place, but
 Yesenia was always masked before.  She doesn't expect Eichhornia to
 recognize her. Especially since Yesenia's still hidden behind the
 minivan.

 The teacher raises a hand, signalling the other school group to stay
 back.

 One of the students pulls out a smartphone and starts filming the
 action.

 The Hyacinth says, "I'm here for Brigit Bhalla."

 Yesenia's heartbeat doubles its pace - but Brigit doesn't answer.

 The teacher says, "There was no authorization for anyone to be picked
 up from the zoo. You'll have to go through the main office. Now,
 please move."

>focus on smartphone

 Yesenia can't do that. It would be stealing, or possibly destruction
 of property. And then Gerald would have even more ammunition.

 The teachers with the other school group retreat to the zoo gates.
 Yesenia breathes out; she won't be juggling a second set of civilians.

 The Hyacinth says, "But you see, her mother sent me."

 The teacher says, "Please inform 'her mother' that she needs to follow
 the proper channels next time. Brigit will be available after we
 return to the main office."

>examine teacher

 (the young teacher)
 The teacher's bright red cat eye glasses might correct her vision, or
 they might just be for fashion's sake. If the first, Yesenia can
 sympathize, though her own vision is perfect these days.

 Outside the zoo gates, one of the other teachers raises a cell phone
 and starts filming the action. Yesenia grits her teeth.

 The Hyacinth cocks her head to one side, sending long blond hair
 cascading over one shoulder, and sighs a little. "Do I have to spell
 this out? I'm here for Brigit Bhalla, and the consequences will be
 <span class="floydstyle em">quite</span> severe if you don't hand her over."

>focus on hyacinth

 Still hidden by the minivan, Yesenia seizes the sunlight and
 translates the energy into force. She clamps that force around The
 Hyacinth, paralyzing the other woman.

 There's a small crowd growing by the zoo gates, probably drawn by
 Yesenia's pyrotechnics.

 The teacher shouts, "Now! <span class="floydstyle em">Move!</span>", and her second graders
 scatter.

>focus on hyacinth

 Still hidden by the minivan, Yesenia focuses more sunlight on The
 Hyacinth.

 Most of the kids head back across the parking lot toward the zoo
 gates, but some of them run for the bus and start banging on the door.
 The driver jolts visibly into wakefulness.

 The Hyacinth's cape lets out an electrical snapping sound, and
 Yesenia's power drains away around her like water draining from a
 bathtub.

 The Hyacinth says, "Cowering in the shadows, Soleil? You should be
 careful. Someone will mistake the Sun Queen for her sidekick."

>focus on hyacinth

 Still hidden by the minivan, Yesenia focuses the sunlight around The
 Hyacinth again, trapping her like a bug in amber.

 The bus driver pulls the bus door handle, and the bus door swings
 open.

 Kids start scrambling onto the bus.

>focus on hyacinth

 Still hidden by the minivan, Yesenia focuses more sunlight on The
 Hyacinth.

 The Hyacinth starts to say something else, but her words are cut off
 by the sudden blast of the bus horn.

 A boy aboard the bus shouts, "Brigit, come <span class="floydstyle em">on!</span>" before
 getting smacked by his seatmate.

 The Hyacinth's cape emits another electrical snap, and Yesenia loses
 control of the sunlight around The Hyacinth again.

 Scanning the parking lot, The Hyacinth turns a quick circle and spots
 Yesenia behind the minivan. "There you are!"

 So much for staying hidden.

>talk to hyacinth

 Yesenia says to the Hyacinth, "Leave her alone."

 The bus driver hits the horn again and waves his cell phone at The
 Hyacinth, who responds with language most parents wouldn't want their
 second-graders to use.

 Brigit exclaims, "Mommy! What are you doing here?"

>talk to Brigit

 Yesenia calls to Brigit, "Listen to your teacher!"

 The school bus starts with a rumble as the students continue to board.

 The Hyacinth whips around and hurls the ball at Yesenia. It strikes
 the ground at her feet and explodes into yellow smoke.

 Yesenia throws up a protective aura automatically. Sunlight blazes
 around her, and the yellow particles veer away harmlessly.

 Brigit claps her hands for joy. "Get her, Mommy!" she shouts.

>burn smartphone

 The student with the phone is too far away.

 The bus driver leans out the door to shout at Brigit, "Come on, you
 got to get on the bus!"

 The Hyacinth says, "So Brigit Bhalla is <span class="floydstyle em">your</span> daughter. Isn't
 that <span class="floydstyle em">interesting</span>!"

 A smile crawls across the Hyacinth's face.

 Brigit starts moving reluctantly toward the bus.

>talk to hyacinth

 Yesenia says to the Hyacinth, "Tell me who sent you."

 The yellow smoke dissipates.

 The Hyacinth says to Brigit, "Brigit, you need to come with me."

 Brigit shouts, "No! You leave me alone!"

>examine crown

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.

>examine cape

 Yesenia considers the lilac cape, but there's nothing special about
 it.

 The Hyacinth says to Brigit, "It's time for us to go. If you just come
 along, all this unpleasantness can be over."

 Brigit shrieks, "You're a great big liar!"

>examine minivan

 It's a maroon minivan with a faux wood stripe along each side. The
 license plate reads YAYDOGZ, and the bumper sticker reads, "I (heart)
 My Groenendaels". It sounds like a medical condition, but apparently
 it's a dog breed.

 The Hyacinth advances on Brigit as she backs away.

 Sirens sound in the distance, rapidly growing closer.

>examine driver

 Due to the angle from one side and the tinted windows from another,
 Yesenia can barely make out the bus driver, but if he can get the kids
 to safety, then he's every bit as much a hero as she ever was.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The Hyacinth lunges at Brigit and grabs at her wrist. The girl dodges
 and runs with an ear-piercing shriek.

>examine children

 (the second grader)
 The kids cluster near their teacher.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The Hyacinth snarls, "Brigit, you horrible little - " The language she
 uses should never be addressed to <span class="floydstyle em">anyone</span>, let alone a second
 grader. "You get over here right now!"

 Brigit clambers hastily onto the bus.

>examine me

 Yesenia isn't worried about her appearance just now.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The second graders finish piling into the bus. Brigit climbs in last,
 followed by the teacher, and the closing bus door cuts off Yesenia's
 view.

 The Hyacinth scowls, "The Sun Queen in California?"

 Yesenia says, "They have sunlight here too."

>talk to hyacinth

 Yesenia says to the Hyacinth, "Go back to Florida."

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus shifts into gear and pulls out of its spot.

 The Hyacinth says, "And you're not even properly <span class="floydstyle em">dressed</span>. So
 that's what you look like without the mask."

>again

 Yesenia says to the Hyacinth, "You're in over your head."

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus pulls out of the parking lot, and Yesenia laughs with
 relief.

 The Hyacinth stares at Yesenia, her mouth twisted with hatred beneath
 the mask.

>again

 Yesenia says to the Hyacinth, "Get away from her."

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The Hyacinth turns and runs across the parking lot, heading for a snow
 white Camaro. She's gone seconds later.

 Yesenia doesn't pursue. She's not supposed to be doing this any more -
 and she doesn't want to be around when those sirens arrive.

 A serialized work of interactive fiction. by Carolyn VanEseltine
 Release 1 / Serial number 150827 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)


 18 Rooms to Home is a serialized game that begins at the end.

 As each update is released, the story will move further back in time -
 so the first release includes room 18, the second will include room 17
 and 18, the third includes 16, 17, and 18, and so on. All released
 rooms are available at [<a href=".">LINK</A>]

 This release is Room 15. This is a long way into Yesenia's journey,
 but it's just a short way into yours.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 By the time the school group winds into the gift shop, Yesenia feels
 like she's hidden around every corner in the entire zoo, and a fog of
 irritation completely obscures her worry. It's easy to be irritated
 with Rachel under any circumstances, but Rachel's really outdone
 herself with this wild goose chase.

 In short order, the school group emerges from the gift shop and heads
 toward the parking lot. Yesenia trails at a safe distance, rolling her
 suitcase along.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Santa Barbara Zoo, Parking Lot</span>
 This secluded part of the parking lot is reserved for buses and other
 oversized vehicles, such as the Washington Elementary school bus
 parked near a red-flowered bush. A thin curtain of trees separates the
 black asphalt from the train tracks and Highway 101 beyond that.

 Yesenia parks herself and her suitcase behind a convenient minivan,
 where she ought to be fairly well hidden from the school group.

 The most important little girl in the whole world is here.

 The second graders mill around the parking lot, herded rather
 ineffectively by a bespectacled teacher.

>examine girl

 Brigit is shorter than most of the other second graders, but no less
 rambunctious, as reported by the grass stains on her pants (and who
 but Rachel would dress a second grader in seashell pink pants?) Her
 huge black eyes match Rachel's, and the shape of her mouth is
 Gerald's, but that never mattered to Yesenia.

 Brigit remains oblivious to her mother's presence.

 The kids scatter forward across the parking lot, laughing and shoving.

>examine camaro

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.

>give car keys to davidw

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.

>examine gates

 Yesenia can't see any such thing.

>examine bus

 (the school bus)
 It's a standard yellow school bus with WASHINGTON ELEMENTARY printed
 along the side. The only person inside is the bus driver, and it looks
 lke he's asleep.

 The teacher says, "This way to the bus!"

>focus on driver

 The bus driver is inside the school bus.

 The teacher says in a harried tone, "The sooner everyone gets on the
 bus, the sooner we get home."

>examine bush

 Yesenia glances at the red-flowered bush, dismisses it, and then looks
 back. She recognizes the tubular flowers and scraggly branches, but
 not from anywhere around here. That's a firebush - and it belongs in
 Florida.

 The teacher finally corrals her students into some semblance of order.

>look in minivan

 Yesenia can't see inside, since the minivan is closed.

 Led by their teacher, the kids approach the bus.

 The firebush on the edge of the parking lot rustles sharply, and a
 woman dressed in white and lilac spandex steps out of the firebush.

 Yesenia recognizes the new arrival at once, though Eichhornia Cress -
 aka The Hyacinth - rarely leaves Florida. As she braces for trouble,
 Yesenia takes back everything she's been thinking about Rachel.

>examine hyacinth

 Yesenia gives The Hyacinth a once over. The other woman is dressed in

 glittery flower pattern.

 This is hardly the first time they've been in the same place, but
 Yesenia was always masked before.  She doesn't expect Eichhornia to

 The Hyacinth positions herself between the school group and the bus.
 There's nothing particularly scary about her white and lilac costume,
 but her body language is clear enough.

 The teacher halts, extending an arm to keep her students back. "Excuse
 me," she says. "You're in our way."

>open suitcase

 Considering the contents of her suitcase, Yesenia really isn't
 inclined to unpack in the parking lot. Besides, nothing in there would
 help her now.

 The teacher's gaze flickers toward the zoo gates, and Yesenia looks
 back to see the other school group approaching.

 The Hyacinth pulls a translucent ball from somewhere in her cloak and
 brandishes it. It doesn't look threatening, but her stance says it's a
 weapon.

 The teacher says to the second graders, "I need you to go back to the
 zoo gates. All of you. Right now."

>focus on ball

 Yesenia throws one hand skyward and one hand at The Hyacinth, and a
 beam of sunlight lances from her hand to strike the translucent ball.
 It's wasteful and flashy and easy to identify.

 Fortunately, it's also effective. The translucent ball explodes into
 yellow smoke. The Hyacinth reels backward, protecting her nose and
 mouth with her free hand.

 The teacher raises a hand, signalling the other school group to stay
 back.

 One of the students pulls out a smartphone and starts filming the
 action.

 Brigit exclaims, "Mommy! What are you doing here?"

 Most of the kids head back across the parking lot toward the zoo
 gates, but some of them run for the bus and start banging on the door.
 The driver jolts visibly into wakefulness.

>hit hyacinth

 Yesenia pivots toward The Hyacinth and then drops to execute a leg
 sweep.  The Hyacinth dodges out of the way with reasonable grace.

 The air brightens around Yesenia - not a full protective aura, which
 would quickly exhaust her, but enough to give her confidence.

 The teachers with the other school group retreat to the zoo gates.
 Yesenia breathes out; she won't be juggling a second set of civilians.

 The yellow smoke dissipates.

 The bus driver pulls the bus door handle, and the bus door swings
 open.

 Brigit claps her hands for joy. "Get her, Mommy!" she shouts.

 Kids start scrambling onto the bus.

>again

 Yesenia steps into The Hyacinth and attempts a one-two punch to her
 midsection.  The Hyacinth parries. She's a bit less graceful now.

 Outside the zoo gates, one of the other teachers raises a cell phone
 and starts filming the action. Yesenia grits her teeth.

 The Hyacinth starts to say something else, but her words are cut off
 by the sudden blast of the bus horn.

 Brigit tries to run toward Yesenia, but The Hyacinth intercepts, and
 the girl has to retreat.

 A boy aboard the bus shouts, "Brigit, come <span class="floydstyle em">on!</span>" before
 getting smacked by his seatmate.

>again

 Yesenia lunges for The Hyacinth and reaches out to throw the other
 woman.  The Hyacinth pants with effort as she counterattacks, driving
 Yesenia back.

 There's a small crowd growing by the zoo gates, probably drawn by
 Yesenia's pyrotechnics.

 The bus driver hits the horn again and waves his cell phone at The
 Hyacinth, who responds with language most parents wouldn't want their
 second-graders to use.

 Brigit starts moving reluctantly toward the bus.

>again

 Yesenia pivots toward The Hyacinth and throws an elbow toward her
 face.  The Hyacinth parries awkwardly.

 The school bus starts with a rumble as the students continue to board.

 Brigit clambers hastily onto the bus.

>again

 Yesenia steps into The Hyacinth and then drops to execute a leg sweep.
 The Hyacinth slaps a hand against her own wrist, and a milky white
 shield flashes into view, blocking Yesenia's attack. It vanishes as
 quickly as it came.

 The second graders finish piling into the bus. Brigit climbs in last,
 followed by the teacher, and the closing bus door cuts off Yesenia's
 view.

 The teacher collapses onto the pavement, along with several of the
 closest kids. Pandemonium ensues.

 (the young teacher)
 She's flat on the pavement, but her eyes are still open, focused, and
 tracking. It looks like the yellow smoke was a paralytic.

 The most important little girl in the whole world dodges around the

 The most important little girl in the whole world's eyes go wide with
 astonishment. "MOMMY!" she shouts.

 The Hyacinth whips around to look straight at Yesenia. So much for

 The most important little girl in the whole world stares at Yesenia

 The most important little girl in the whole world shouts at Yesenia,
 "Mama's right! You don't help people at <span class="floydstyle em">all!</span>" and bursts into
 tears.

 Yesenia's heart drops like a rock. "No - " she manages, but the most

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The Hyacinth lunges at the most important little girl in the whole

 Brigit runs onto the school bus without looking back.

 The remaining second graders scramble aboard the bus, and the driver

 smoke.

 The bus driver throws open the door and lunges out. From this angle,
 Yesenia can't see him very well, but she can tell what he's doing -
 getting the fallen kids into the bus.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The bus driver grunts with effort as he heaves the teacher into the
 bus. Once she's safely aboard, he steps back up and yanks the door
 closed again.

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The school bus pulls out of the parking lot, and Yesenia laughs with

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The police will be here any second. Yesenia can't stay any longer.

>wait

 Yesenia considers her options.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 Yesenia doubles back to grab her suitcase and then takes off.

 Palm trees shadow Yesenia as she heads south toward Ninos Drive.
 There's a bus stop at the zoo entrance, but the sirens are closer
 every second, so she keeps moving south until she reaches Cabrillo
 Boulevard.

 The 14 Montecito arrives across the street - but she can't cross the
 street until the traffic clears, and by then, the bus is pulling away.
 She comforts herself with the thought that it wasn't the right bus
 anyway, and she trots across the crosswalk to join the tourists.


 <span class="floydstyle em">Please press SPACE to continue.</span>
 Tourists move down the steps toward Cabrillo Pavilion in long waves,
 unconsciously mimicking the ocean beyond. Yesenia loiters awkwardly at
 the sidewalk's edge and pretends to be fascinated by the fat little
 palm trees, the blue sign reading ZOO with its arrow, or anything else
 that will keep her face away from pedestrians.

 Yesenia turns at the distant roar of a bus. The familiar white body
 with its upper yellow stripe comes around the bend, and she reads 20
 Carpinteria with relief. The crowd at the bus stop shuffles around,
 and Yesenia queues up to board, hauling the flowered suitcase behind
 her as she climbs the steps.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">20 to Carpinteria</span>
 It's like any other MTD bus: bluish-gray plastic seats crowded with
 passengers, huge windows, and an array of silver poles and black
 straps for standing passengers. No one's standing right now, though.

 The driver taps the fare box and gives Yesenia a meaningful look.

 Yesenia braces her suitcase against her leg.

 By the time the school group winds into the gift shop, Yesenia feels
 like she's hidden around every corner in the entire zoo, and a fog of
 irritation completely obscures her worry. It's easy to be irritated
 with Rachel under any circumstances, but Rachel's really outdone
 herself with this wild goose chase.

 In short order, the school group emerges from the gift shop and heads
 toward the parking lot. Yesenia trails at a safe distance, rolling her
 suitcase along.


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Santa Barbara Zoo, Parking Lot</span>
 This secluded part of the parking lot is reserved for buses and other
 oversized vehicles, such as the Washington Elementary school bus
 parked near a red-flowered bush. A thin curtain of trees separates the
 black asphalt from the train tracks and Highway 101 beyond that.

 Yesenia parks herself and her suitcase behind a convenient minivan,
 where she ought to be fairly well hidden from the school group.

 The most important little girl in the whole world is here.

 The second graders mill around the parking lot, herded rather
 ineffectively by a bespectacled teacher.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The kids scatter forward across the parking lot, laughing and shoving.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher says, "This way to the bus!"

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher says in a harried tone, "The sooner everyone gets on the
 bus, the sooner we get home."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher finally corrals her students into some semblance of order.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 Led by their teacher, the kids approach the bus.

 The red-flowered bush on the edge of the parking lot rustles sharply.
 Yesenia recognizes it as a firebush, and she has just enough time to
 think <span class="floydstyle em">Do those even grow around here?</span> before a woman dressed
 in white and lilac spandex steps out of the red-flowered bush.

 Yesenia recognizes the new arrival at once, though Eichhornia Cress -
 aka The Hyacinth - rarely leaves Florida. As she braces for trouble,
 Yesenia takes back everything she's been thinking about Rachel.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The Hyacinth positions herself between the school group and the bus.
 There's nothing particularly scary about her white and lilac costume,
 but her body language is clear enough.

 The teacher halts, extending an arm to keep her students back. "Excuse
 me," she says. "You're in our way."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher's gaze flickers toward the zoo gates, and Yesenia looks
 back to see the other school group approaching.

 The Hyacinth pulls a translucent ball from somewhere in her cloak and
 brandishes it. It doesn't look threatening, but her stance says it's a
 weapon.

 The teacher says to the second graders, "I need you to go back to the
 zoo gates. All of you. Right now."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teacher raises a hand, signalling the other school group to stay
 back.

 One of the students pulls out a smartphone and starts filming the
 action.

 The Hyacinth says, "I'm here for Brigit Bhalla."

 Yesenia's heartbeat doubles its pace - but the most important little
 girl in the whole world doesn't answer.

 The teacher says, "There was no authorization for anyone to be picked
 up from the zoo. You'll have to go through the main office. Now,
 please move."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The teachers with the other school group retreat to the zoo gates.
 Yesenia breathes out; she won't be juggling a second set of civilians.

 The Hyacinth says, "But you see, her mother sent me."

 The teacher says, "Please inform 'her mother' that she needs to follow
 the proper channels next time. Brigit will be available after we
 return to the main office."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 Outside the zoo gates, one of the other teachers raises a cell phone
 and starts filming the action. Yesenia grits her teeth.

 The Hyacinth cocks her head to one side, sending long blond hair
 cascading over one shoulder, and sighs a little. "Do I have to spell
 this out? I'm here for Brigit Bhalla, and the consequences will be
 <span class="floydstyle em">quite</span> severe if you don't hand her over."

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 There's a small crowd growing by the zoo gates, perhaps people warned
 back by the other teachers.

 The Hyacinth asks, "Well?"

 The teacher glances over her shoulder, but she doesn't spot Yesenia
 behind the minivan, and no one else is close enough to help.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The Hyacinth hurls the ball. It strikes the ground at the teacher's
 feet and explodes into yellow smoke.

 The teacher collapses onto the pavement, along with several of the
 closest kids. Pandemonium ensues.

>wait

 Yesenia watches from behind the minivan.

 The most important little girl in the whole world dodges around the
 minivan - and almost runs straight into Yesenia.

 The most important little girl in the whole world's eyes go wide with
 astonishment. "MOMMY!" she shouts.

 The Hyacinth whips around to look straight at Yesenia. So much for
 staying hidden.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The yellow smoke dissipates.

 The Hyacinth demands of Yesenia, "Who are you?"

 The most important little girl in the whole world exclaims, "Mommy!
 What are you doing here?"

 Most of the kids head back across the parking lot toward the zoo
 gates, but some of them run for the bus and start banging on the door.
 The driver jolts visibly into wakefulness.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The bus driver pulls the bus door handle, and the bus door swings
 open.

 The Hyacinth says to Yesenia, "Clearly, you don't know who you're
 dealing with."

 The most important little girl in the whole world claps her hands for
 joy. "Get her, Mommy!" she shouts.

 Kids start scrambling onto the bus.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The Hyacinth starts to say something else, but her words are cut off
 by the sudden blast of the bus horn.

 "Mommy!" the most important little girl in the whole world shouts.
 "Get her!"

 The Hyacinth sneers, "I hardly think your mom is going to 'get me'.
 She looks like she could barely get the groceries."

 A boy aboard the bus shouts, "Brigit, come <span class="floydstyle em">on!</span>" before
 getting smacked by his seatmate.

 The most important little girl in the whole world shouts, "Mommy,
 help!"

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The bus driver hits the horn again and waves his cell phone at The
 Hyacinth, who responds with language most parents wouldn't want their
 second-graders to use.

 The most important little girl in the whole world shouts, "Mommy, we
 need help!"

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The school bus starts with a rumble as the students continue to board.

 The Hyacinth says to the most important little girl in the whole
 world, "Brigit, you need to come with me."

 The most important little girl in the whole world shouts, "No! You
 leave me alone!"

 The most important little girl in the whole world cries, "Mommy,
 aren't you going to <span class="floydstyle em">do</span> anything?"

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The bus driver leans out the door to shout at the most important
 little girl in the whole world, "Come on, you got to get on the bus!"

 The Hyacinth says to the most important little girl in the whole
 world, "It's time for us to go. If you just come along, all this
 unpleasantness can be over."

 The most important little girl in the whole world shrieks, "You're a
 great big liar!"

 The most important little girl in the whole world stares at Yesenia
 with a look of complete betrayal.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The Hyacinth advances on the most important little girl in the whole
 world as she backs away.

 The most important little girl in the whole world shouts at Yesenia,
 "Mama's right! You don't help people at <span class="floydstyle em">all!</span>" and bursts into
 tears.

 Yesenia's heart drops like a rock. "No - " she manages, but the most
 important little girl in the whole world isn't listening.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The Hyacinth lunges at the most important little girl in the whole
 world and grabs at her wrist. The girl dodges and runs with an
 ear-piercing shriek.

 Brigit runs onto the school bus without looking back.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The remaining second graders scramble aboard the bus, and the driver
 pulls the handle to close the bus door.

 The Hyacinth says to Yesenia, "I am The Hyacinth" - the capital
 letters are especially clear when she says it - "and if you don't get
 out of here, I'll choke you like a waterway."

 Sirens sound in the distance, rapidly growing closer.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus shifts into gear and pulls out of its spot.

 The Hyacinth shouts at the bus, "Brigit, you get out here right now!"

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus swings around, orienting on the Hyacinth.

 The Hyacinth stares at Yesenia, her mouth twisted with hatred beneath
 the mask.

>wait

 Yesenia waits for the right moment.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus picks up speed, bearing down on the Hyacinth.

 The Hyacinth stares in open-mouthed astonishment before diving out of
 the way.

>focus on hyacinth

 Yesenia seizes the sunlight and translates the energy into force. She
 clamps that force around The Hyacinth, paralyzing the other woman.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus picks up speed, bearing down on the Hyacinth.

 The Hyacinth stares in open-mouthed astonishment before diving out of
 the way.

>focus on hyacinth

 Yesenia focuses more sunlight on The Hyacinth.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus screeches to a halt (oh, those brakes need tuning!),
 forming a barrier between the Hyacinth and the victims of her yellow
 smoke.

 The Hyacinth's cape emits an electric snap, and Yesenia's focus drains
 away.

 The Hyacinth says, "I've seen your face, Sun Queen. And I've seen the
 face of your daughter, Brigit Bhalla. I will make you more sorry than
 you can imagine."

>hit hyacinth

 Yesenia steps into The Hyacinth and reaches out to throw the other
 woman.  The Hyacinth parries with reasonable grace.

 The air brightens around Yesenia, but she fights back the reflex. She
 doesn't <span class="floydstyle em">need</span> a full protective aura to fight The Hyacinth,
 and if no one noticed that flash, she can still hope to hide her
 identity.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus picks up speed, bearing down on the Hyacinth.

 The Hyacinth stares in open-mouthed astonishment before diving out of
 the way.

>hit hyacinth

 Yesenia lunges for The Hyacinth and attempts a one-two punch to her
 midsection.  The Hyacinth turns the blow aside. She's a bit less
 graceful now.

 The sirens are getting louder.

 The school bus screeches to a halt (oh, those brakes need tuning!),
 forming a barrier between the Hyacinth and the victims of her yellow
 smoke.
