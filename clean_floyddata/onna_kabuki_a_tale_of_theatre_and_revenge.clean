 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A mountain fastness in Chūbu, central Japan.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Autumn of Keichō 7.</span>


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Besieged castle</span>
 Akechi stands tall on the battlements, bloodied sword in hand. Perhaps
 just an hour before dawn, and he knows it all shall be over well
 before sunrise. The enemy soldiers are everywhere! Tokugawa's lackeys
 will have another day to brag about, starting with the accursed Lord
 Konkawa. Enemies are storming the castle from all directions except
 from the north, and to the east the tower still resists the onslaught.

 The air is dense with arrows and musket volleys, the ground drinks
 fresh blood avidly. The castle is lost, his Lord is lost... but
 perhaps honour can still be saved?


 This story might be triggering for some people due to:

 Suicide themes (non-graphic, optional)


>examine me

 Behold the brave Akechi Nobuhide, a great warrior and loyal samurai
 retainer of the Lord Kinoshita. By all accounts, this shall be the
 last day of his life.

>inventory

 He is carrying:
   samurai armor (being worn)
   a katana
   a tantō

>examine him

 Improper of a samurai!

>sing

 Improper of a samurai!

>jump

 He jumps on the spot.

>go west

 Akechi lets go a fearsome battle cry, steeling himself for certain
 death, ready to dive into the thickest of the battle. Will he do it?
>y
 death, ready to dive into the thickest of the battle. Will he do it?

 He charges into battle like the kami-kaze, inflicting a thousand
 wounds before death comes to him, swiftly, like silent snow. The
 bushido is honourably choosing death when life is still possible,
 nothing more, nothing less.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A pilgrim in the snow.</span>
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Winter.</span>

 Many days have passed, and even the bitterest winter comes to an end.
 Your stop for a while, interrupting the sound of steps on the crunchy
 snow. Night is falling behind the tall trees. Time to find a place to
 rest your weary bones until the morning.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Moonlit forest</span>
 Darkness is falling fast. The pines are darkened, and beyond them a
 river sings its bubbly song among the reeds of the northern shore.
 Lording over the whole nightscape, a castle is silhouetted in silver
 against the rising moon. The breeze sings in the branches, stirring
 the forest to its secret life. The road turns to the west.


 Once again, you drag your sore feet along the road. After a while, the
 forest thins out and you come to a crossroads.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Post station by a bridge</span>
 At a crossroads, gurgling of water on stone, distant laughter. To the
 north, a bridge over a gushing river, glinting under the moon. To the
 west, muffled conversation and a warm candlelight through paper walls
 - a roadside inn.

>examine me

 You are nothing but a humble komusō monk, a "priest of nothingness",
 devoted to the mendicant life. Wandering around, straw basket over
 your head to erase your identity, you play your flute for alms and
 seek enlightenment on the road.

>play flute

 You play the flute as well as you can.

 Silence seems to grow around you as you play the shakuhachi flute, a
 lonely, long ululating sound that evokes the mist in the mountains -
 the self peels away just like mist boils away at sunrise. Once done,
 you put it back in your sash.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Roadside inn</span>
 An inn lit by candles, and within, men lit by rice wine. A half-dozen
 tables, occupied mostly by local peasants. A rather dishevelled
 waitress is strutting around the table where a few boisterous soldiers
 keep drinking sake in large quantities.

 The obsequious innkeeper is serving his patrons from a great barrel of
 sake.

>go west

 First things first. You should get some dinner, and a room for the
 night.


 She's a young woman of perhaps twenty, hair haphazardly held up with a
 dissonant assortment of hair pins, kimono suggestively loose. It is
 illegal for inns of this type to employ prostitutes, so this woman is
 not an illegal prostitute, just a waitress that so happens to offer
 sexual services to travelers in exchange for money.

>order dinner

 A true priest of nothingness would never do such a thing.

>get dinner

 (You'd rather communicate with TALK TO a character.)



 It would be very unbecoming of a priest to be seen talking to a loose
 woman in a public place. You need to find a way to make her go
 somewhere more private, perhaps to get sent on some errand for the
 inn, if you found something... lacking in your accommodation.


 You play the flute as well as you can.

 You finish your flute concert with a few prayers and blessings for the
 patrons and the master of the house. All the inn patrons show their
 appreciation, and the innkeeper in particular bows deeply. You seem to
 have made him suitably grateful.


 "A traveling monk! Welcome, you are most welcome to our humble inn.
 Have a seat, I shall bring you some food..."

 He fills your bowl with rice and some tempting-looking pickles. You
 devour the lot in no time.


 "And now I guess you would like a place to rest? Come with me..."

 He opens a sliding door, and you follow him into one of the inn's
 guestrooms. He wishes you good-night.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">A guestroom at the inn</span>
 The inn guestrooms are spartan and small, as expected in such a remote
 part of the Empire. The tatamis are a bit old and worn out, but at
 least you will have some privacy here. From outside comes the din of
 the tavern. To the north, there is a closed sliding window.

 On the floor, neatly arranged, there is a futon mattress.

 The innkeeper gestures you to wait, goes into his chambers and comes
 back with a white flask. He presents it to you with the utmost
 reverence.

 "My finest sake, from Nara. To thank you for your performance and your
 blessings on my house. Please enjoy."

 "I humbly receive..."


 A thin mattress stuffed with straw, scarcely enough for a winter
 night.


 You find nothing of interest.

>examine tatami

 The tatami on the floor is a bit coarse, but clean enough to sleep in.

>tatami

 The window slides open almost in perfect silence. From outside comes a
 gust of cold, damp air, and a band of silvery light.

>out


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By a moonlit river</span>
 You are standing with your back almost to the wall of the inn, just a
 couple of paces of dry land before the rapid, silver-black waters.
 Their chatter drowns all other nightly sounds. The current seems
 strong here, flowing rapidly eastwards, passing under a stone bridge.
 Further to the northeast, on the other shore, the black shape of a
 mighty castle looms ominously against the pale, full moon.

>examine river

 Up close, the current seems pretty strong. Although the river is
 probably not that deep, you won't be able to cross against that
 current. You think of a way to make that current work for you...

>examine bridge

 From this angle you can see the shape of the bridge and the soldiers
 standing guard as black profiles, like shadow puppets. You need to
 find another way across the water...

 This is the very shore, surrounded by the river on all sides except
 for the inn to the south, where the window to the guest room is. The
 current seems too strong to swim against; you would end up miles
 downstream before you reach the northern shore.

>remove basket

 In the privacy of the bedroom, you take off the basket for a moment.
 In the dim light you find a little silk pouch sewn to the inside of
 the basket, and from there you extract one ryō. It seems like some
 gold would bend a few minds around these parts.

>sleep

 Not yet. You still need to know if the man you seek is where you think
 he is. His men should know that. You must find a way to loosen some
 military tongues.

 waitress is strutting around the table where a few boisterous soldiers
 keep drinking sake in large quantities.

 The innkeeper fills another flask on the sake barrel and ceremoniously
 brings it to the soldiers.

 The dishevelled-looking woman takes a surreptitious look at the
 innkeeper, and has a sip of sake while he's not looking.

>talk to peasant

 You start a friendly conversation with the rustic peasants. They
 gossip about various topics, tell a few a legends and a bit about the
 local spirits and suchlike.

 "Have you seen the castle?" asks one of them, perhaps a bit more into
 his cups than the others. "It used to belong to Lord Kinoshita..." his
 friends try to shut him up, looking nervously at the soldiers on the
 other tables.

 "That was many years ago. There was a great battle, many great
 warriors died. There was a samurai called Akechi, they said he was
 illegitimately in love with a noble lady. The tale says he died
 fighting scores of samurai, and even his enemies praised him for his
 bravery after slaying him...


 The others manage to make him shut up, and apologise quietly for the
 tirade. Under the table, you clench your fists.

>talk to soldier

 You approach the soldiers and try to make small talk, but they are
 more interested in drinking and bragging about their dubious exploits
 rather than have a pious conversation with a monk.

 "Pray tell, good soldiers, which lord do you serve?"

 "Why, the daimyō, of course! Haven't you seen his castle, on the
 northern shore?"

 "And why so many of you? I want to continue my pilgrimage, but the
 bridge seems to be closed..."

 "And why so many questions? And why answer them? Leave us to our sake,
 monk, and bother us no more unless you're buying!"

>buy sake for soldier

 A true priest of nothingness would never do such a thing.

>pay soldier

 What do you want to pay the soldiers?

>ryō

 A true priest of nothingness would never do such a thing.

>pay coin to soldier

 They would definitely do anything for this kind of money, but a
 mendicant monk carrying so much gold would look extremely suspicious.
 There must be a subtler way to make them do your bidding.

>kill soldier

 That is not the proper way to deal with this.

>kiss waitress

 The waitress might not like that.

>ask waitress for a kiss

 (You'd rather communicate with TALK TO a character.)

 For a moment, the girl lingers in the back, propped against the wall.
 A dirty look from the innkeeper sends her on a flurry of action.

 It would be very unbecoming of a priest to be seen talking to a loose

>talk to innkeeper

 "Dear innkeeper, thought it pains me to ask so much of your piety,
 can't you provide at least a meagre futon for your guests? My old
 bones ache in this cold..."

 "What, isn't there a futon in your guest room?"

 "A futon, you say? Not one, no, not a single blanket you have
 provided!"

 "Damn that lazy wench! You, woman, did I not tell you to prepare the
 guest rooms before dinnertime? Go tend to this venerable monk, at
 once! Go to, make haste!"

 The waitress gives you the evil eye as she goes fetch a futon for your
 room.

 The waitress is here, searching every nook and cranny and muttering
 something about a "damned futon".

>talk to girl

 "I would need some distraction, and I think you might be able to help
 with that."

 "Distraction? What are you up to? I want no part in anything illegal!"

 "Nothing more illegal that what you are already doing. I need that
 innkeeper to lose sight of his sake, for the general merriment of all
 patrons..."

 "Heh, that might be fun. But what's in for me? If I do that and he
 finds out I was an accomplice, he'll kick me out, to starve in the
 snow. So, "monk", if you want my help, I need to see some money..."

>show coin to woman

 You produce the golden coin, which attracts the waitress' gaze like a
 magnet.

 "Get the innkeeper away from that barrel, can you?"

 "For a ryo, I can that and much more!"

 You give her the ryo, and she bites it to ensure it's gold.

 "A piece of advice, girl. Get out of here. Go south, to Edo, it's
 where the bakufu is these days, a great city. Ask about the kabuki
 theatre. I make no promises, but it is the only place where a woman
 can be her own."

 She pulls a face like you were telling her to go to the moon, but she
 seems to listen, and even bows a little. Then she's off.

>go east

 An inn lit by candles, and within, men lit by rice wine. The tables

 The barrel is full of sake... and the innkeeper is nowhere to be seen.
 Tempting.

>take barrel

 All that sake makes it way too heavy to carry or push. What would be a
 good way to empty it? Ah, yes, the soldiers... that could work...
 Not yet. Before you get them completely drunk, there is some
 information you need to extract from them. Start with the finer wine
 to loosen their tongues, and go for broke only when you don't need
 them awake any more...

>give sake to soldiers

 (the flask to the soldiers)
 "I have brought some fine sake, more worthy of great warriors like
 yourselves."

 "Ha! Good, good, let's drink it then! To the health of our daimyō and
 his illustrious guests."

 "Does he have guests tonight?"

 "Of course, why'd you think there's so many of us around in such a
 bitter night? And very special guests indeed - the lord Konkawa, liege
 of all the region, and some say, Tokugawa's staunchest supporter in
 the whole of Chūbu."

 "Is he indeed."

 "Aye! He's on some tour of his vassal castles. But he departs early in
 the morning, so let us drink and be merry while we can, and damned be
 the dawn."

 And with that, he finishes the flask and throws it to the floor.

>give barrel to soldiers

 (first taking the barrel of sake)
 All that sake makes it way too heavy to carry or push. What would be a
 good way to empty it? Ah, yes, the soldiers... that could work...

 "Good soldiers, look! That gold-hearted innkeeper has left you all his
 sake for your enjoyment! What a compassionate fellow! How he loves
 loyal soldiers!"

 The men cheer and waste no time in requisitioning the barrel. Needless
 to say, in a moment they are drunker than a sailor.

 That should take care of them for the night... and empty that barrel
 very conveniently. Time to catch some rest while you wait for them to
 pass out.

 dissolve, identities will be confused, and an old tragedy will be made
 real again for the audience. You can hear the audience on the other
 side of the curtain, talking, laughing, drinking, almost holding their
 breath in anticipation for today's play. They have come to see
 beautiful women, brave samurai, dastardly villains, daring deeds and
 titillating innuendo. A story to take their minds off the daily toil
 and business of Edo life. A fantasy to forget the grayness of a
 military rule, or so they expect...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Theatre green room</span>
 The green room is teeming with other actresses chatting, putting on
 their costumes and applying make-up in preparation for the
 performance. Not long to go until it starts, better get ready. The
 main stage is to the east, the stairs in the background climb up to
 your chambers in the upper floor.

 One of the newest actresses smiles nervously at you, perhaps
 intimidated by the thought of appearing on-stage so soon.

 A heavy wooden tansu chest sits at the foot of a huge mirror.

 On it sits a bowl of fine white powder.

 Another couple of bowls contain red and black paint.

 A third bowl is full of thick, sticky white foundation.

>examine me

 The alluring Shiratama, one of the most celebrated kabuki actresses of
 the pleasure district of Edo, famous for her dramatic talent.

 You are splendidly dressed in a deliciously tactile silk yukata, light
 and fresh for the humid summers of Edo.

>wear foundation

 (first taking foundation)
 You take foundation.

 You apply the white foundation over your naked skin, painting your
 face all white with a brush. Then you use a sponge to even it out,
 eliminating brush marks.

>paint face

 Unworthy of a splendid lady like yourself!

>wear powder

 (first taking powder)
 You take powder.

 You gently apply white powders all over your face, carefully brushing
 away the excess. It clings to the white foundation perfectly, giving
 your face an even appearance, like fresh snow upon a field.

>wear red paint

 (first taking paint)
 You take paint.

 Finally, you paint black eye shadows over your whitened face, and then
 some red accents indicating your character is a brave samurai.
 Finally, as befitting a warrior, you draw pronounced black eyebrows at
 a rakish angle. Checking the effect in the mirror, you are quite
 satisfied.

>stand

 But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>examine tansu

 Once it belonged to a travelling merchant, but at some point he had to
 pawn everything he owned to pay for a certain lady. What a
 coincidence, his chest ended up in your possession.

 The great chest is closed.

>talk to actress

 "So, girl? Ready for the performance?"

 "Oh, I am so nervous, Shiratama-san! I am terrified that I would
 freeze and forget my cues!" she says, trembling slightly. You smile
 reassuringly, as expected from a seasoned actress like yourself.

 "Don't be, little sister. Let's go over it one more time: in the first
 act, the noble Toji defends her lady from a band of robbers. The theme
 is bravery and fierceness. Then, when her lady dies (that is, you), he
 is overcome by grief and wanders off, wishing death. The topic of the
 second act is desperation, as he travels the world and meets a tengu.
 The tengu teaches him some magic tricks, and in the third act he
 avenges her lover (and then you appear as a ghost), finishing on a
 note of redemption. See? Not that difficult to follow."

 The other woman bows, with a smile of relief.

 "Thank you, Shiratama-san! I shall remember that."

 You go back to your preparations.

>open chest

 You open the tansu chest, revealing a fiery red kimono, a dignified
 yellow kimono and a soft green kimono.

 A costume kimono, dyed a fantastic red hue like a firestorm.

>examine green

 A costume kimono, dyed the soft green of redemption and hope.

 You're dragged out of the medic's station bunk just before dawn by two
 burly guards. Still sore and bruised from your last beating, you're
 dizzy and can be sure of only one thing: the next beating will be your
 last. You almost died from the one that knocked you off your feet for
 the last three weeks and the only thing you did to earn that one was
 accidentally making eye contact with one of the guards in the exercise
 yard.

 You must get out of here...
 You must get out of here... before anyone figures out why you're in
 here.
 here.
 Your silence is the only weapon you have. Their ignorance is the only
 reason you're still alive.

 <span class="floydstyle header">Prizon</span>
 An Interactive Fiction by Jason Gamble
 Release 1 / Serial number 170705 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">D402</span>
 You can see Door Delta 402, your shelf (on which are your cup (in
 which are your toothbrush and your tube of toothpaste), a pack of
 cigarettes and a copy of the Baker of Shireton (closed)), your bed, a
 sink (empty), a ventilation duct (closed) and a fire sprinkler here.

>read baker

 It's a fantasy novel based on the famous "Age of Aeons" MMORPG called
 "the Baker of Shireton". There seems to be something hidden in the
 book.

>open book

 You open the copy of the Baker of Shireton, revealing a postcard.

>examine postcaard

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine postcard

 It's got a picture of a naked lady on one side, and the scribblings of
 a lunatic on the other.

>read postcard

 It's got a picture of a naked lady on one side, and the scribblings of
 a lunatic on the other.

>read scribblings

 There's glyphs, but it's not language. It's the nonsensical
 hieroglyphics of a maniac. Looks like he wrote it with shit. You'd
 sniff it, but you're reasonably certain it'll end up being shit. Rat
 shit. Used to be a lot of rats around until the crazy fucker that used
 to stay in your cell ate them all.

>examine hieroglphics

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>smell postcard

 You smell nothing unexpected.

>examine hieroglyphics

 That noun did not make sense in this context.

>examine cigarettes

 An unopened pack of smokes. You haven't opened it yet because smoking
 is bad for you.

>open it

 No way. They're more valuable in this condition anyway.

>examine cup

 A tall, clear Permaplastic cup. Moldproof and dishwasher safe. Rounded
 edges, and too rubbery to work as an improvised weapon.

 In your cup are your toothbrush and your tube of toothpaste.

>examine toothbrush

 It's a moldproof toothbrush. Even though it's long and thing, it can't
 be made into a shiv because it's made of Permaplastic.

>examine toothpaste

 It's empty, and the cap is missing.

>examine shelf

 On your shelf are your cup (in which are your toothbrush and your tube
 of toothpaste), a pack of cigarettes and a copy of the Baker of
 Shireton (in which is a postcard).

>examine door

 You see nothing special about Door Delta 402.

>examine bed

 Your bed is, of course, a standard bunk built into the far wall. No
 blanket, no pillow. Just a slab that's somehow more comfortable than
 it looks.

>examine sink

 The sink is nothing special. Just a faucet and a drain.

>examine duct

 (the ventilation duct)
 Thanks to clever engineering when they built the prison, the
 ventilation duct is only three by three inches tall and wide. You're
 not getting out that way. Might be able to open it for storage though.

>open it

 It seems to be locked.

>examine sprinkler

 If the guards catch you messing around with that they'll beat you for
 hours.

>examine faucet

 The faucet is rustproof, stainless, shiny, voice activated, and
 broken. The knob is missing.

 The faucet is currently switched off.

>examine drain

 It's clogged. It might be connected to the broken faucet.

>examine me

 Inmate D402-JDK. At least, that's what that print on your jumpsuit
 says.

>examine jumpsuit

 It's a snug fitting onesie with rubbery soles, and you can't take it
 off. It's designed to be uncomfortable to keep inmates from having
 enough range of movement to put up much of a fight. It can also serve
 as a stabproof vest, pajamas, and thanks to clever design, functions
 as a shower and toilet. Sadly it does not have pockets out of security
 concerns. It also makes it impossible to masturbate. All of this makes
 inmates wearing them extremely agitated, limiting their ability to
 pool their talents and cause trouble.

>turn faucet

 Nothing obvious happens.

>turn on sink

 It's broken. The thing you twist on top is missing.

>take tube

 Taken.

>turn on sink with tube

 You can't see any such thing.

>open duct

 (the ventilation duct)
 It seems to be locked.

>unlock duct with tube

 (the ventilation duct with your tube of toothpaste)
 That won't work. You need something long and thin yet sturdy for that.

>take toothbrush

 Taken.

>unlock duct with toothbrush

 (the ventilation duct with your toothbrush)
 You pry the toothbrush through the grating of the duct panel and
 manage to unlock the maintenance latch behind the panel. Thanks to
 your clever reasoning, you can now use the ventilation duct to store
 some stuff.

>open duct

 (the ventilation duct)
 You open the ventilation duct, revealing a three of clubs and a
 napkin.

>examine three

 It's the three of clubs.

>examine napkin

 It has the name 'Layla' on it in girly handwriting, with underneath
 her phone number. Lots of twos, sevens and nines... you think. Some
 fucker put a cold glass of ice water on it or something, and it's all
 blurry. You try to read it and you think it's... 227-277-2292. Well,
 there's only 59'049 possibilities, you could try them all.

>turn over three

 You can't see any such thing.

>close vent

 You can't see any such thing.

>close duct

 (the ventilation duct)
 You close the ventilation duct.
