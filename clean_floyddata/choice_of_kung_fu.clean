 "Look out!"

 The noise of battle is distracting, and it takes you almost too long to
 realize that the warning was shouted to you. An outlaw wearing a blue
 turban is charging toward you, his longspear leveled at your heart.
 What will you do?

 A: Stand firm, blocking the spear away at the last moment and slashing
 twin tiger claws across his face.
 B: Pounce toward him at the last moment, springing like a leopard, and
 bring an elbow down on his head.
 C: Dart off to the side, balancing on one leg like a crane before
 delivering a swift kick to his knee.
 D: Weave hypnotically in my stance, and when he strikes, I am no longer
 there; I launch a series of quick, snakelike strikes to the pressure
 points in his exposed rib cage.
 E: Make a series of flashy moves that draw his target toward my right
 side, then move to the left, delivering a reiken strike to the right
 side of his head as he passes by.
 F: Remain still, my hands low at the chi center of my body, and at the
 moment he would hit me, circle his spear away and shift myself away
 from the strike.

>go down
 injured side. He looks suddently exhausted, courtesy of the disruption
 in his chi that your knowledge of the mystical Snake technique allowed.

 With your opponent deterred, but not out of the fight, how do you
 follow up your attack?

 A: Use a palm heel strike under the chin to drive his head backwards,
 tearing down with a tiger claw on his face as he falls.
 B: Drive into him with a series of fast leopard punches down the center
 of his body until he falls to the ground.
 C: Take his leg out from under him with a sweeping straight kick,
 delivering a wing strike to his neck at the same moment, graceful as a
 crane.
 D: With my fingers tight like a snake's head, strike out at his face
 and neck in a complex pattern of several hits that impact on nerve
 points, disabling him.
 E: Feign a low kick to the knee, and when he moves the spear shaft down
 to block, shoot a dragon tooth strike?my fingers separated in a V?into
 his eyes before sweeping him from behind.
 F: His death would be senseless and against the Buddha nature; pivot
 around behind him and lock him in a sleeper hold.

>go down
 chi, drop him to the ground, unconscious. He'll be feeling that when he
 wakes up.

 The outlaws continue toward you and your fellow students, flashes of
 blue catching your eye against the greens and browns of the marsh
 surrounding your path. It is hard to imagine that only moments ago, the
 nine of you were making your way back to the monastery of the Order of
 the Peach Tree, students on the simple assignment of escorting a
 wagonload of supplies home.

 The students have mostly remained on the path, where their footing is
 more certain, but the outlaws appear to have little trouble navigating
 the wetlands. While they fight like untrained peasants, numbers are
 definitely on their side.

 It's time to get serious. Drawing on the training you received before
 entering the Order of the Peach Tree, you prepare your next attack. How
 will you fight?

 A: Draw my sword. This blade was forged by the most expert smiths in
 the Middle Kingdom, designed specifically to be used with the Celestial
 Sword style, taught only to the Imperial Family.
 B: Unhitch the horse from the cart of supplies. He is a mean beast?not
 the fine mare I trained on at my father's estate?but few monks could
 master a horse from as honorable a family as mine. I draw my blade and
 prepare to charge.
 C: Draw on my chi, as well the energy in the world around me. I can
 sense the life energies of my fellow students and the approaching
 outlaws.
 D: Release the bindings that secure my longspear to my back. It is only
 one of the many weapons I have mastered in my wanderings, and it is a
 good choice to keep the outlaws at bay.
 E: Why change? The style my masters at the Order of the Peach Tree are
 teaching me is a superior one, and I am eager to prove the worth of my
 unarmed style in battle.

>c
 what the uninformed consider "magic." But you know to be your power to
 be from the energies of the universe, which are at your beck and call.
 You also know that the perception of your abilities can be used against
 your enemies?and one day, you hope it will inspire your allies. For
 now, the other students shy away from you, except for Lu Jin, your
 primary rival for the place of senior student, who watches you with a
 wary eye.

 The battle that follows is hectic; the outlaws have little in the way
 of skill, but they make up for it in passion. They are determined to
 have your supplies, despite the clear skill shown by you and your
 fellow students. Though you are focused on keeping them from trying to
 kill you, you notice as you disable your opponents that they are
 skinny, likely the result of being poorly fed. You also note that a
 number of the outlaws are women.

 Does that surprise you?

 A: Yes. Fighting is the realm of warriors, and the role of the warrior
 falls to the men.
 B: No. Outlaws have always bucked convention; why bother following
 social rules?
 C: Yes, but it is nice to know that I am not alone in questioning
 traditional roles.
 D: No. I am used to fighting side by side among men and women
 accomplished in the way of battle.

>go down
 Luckily for you, the Order of the Peach Tree feels similarly. Are you a
 man or a woman?

 A: I am a man.
 B: I am a woman.

>b

 A: Yin.
 B: Meili.
 C: Yan.
 D: None of these is my name.

>b

 And what is your family name?

 A: Liu.
 B: Wong.
 C: Cao.
 D: None of these is my family name.

>a

 The bandits are quickly losing their resolve to steal your wagon; they
 still have numbers on their side, but many have fallen, wounded or
 dead, at your feet. You hear the far-off sound of a whistle, and the
 bandits begin to disengage, quickly fading back into the marsh. Though
 you and your fellow students have done a formidable job of holding off
 the bandits, you see that your fellows have taken some injuries as
 well.

 What do you do?

 A: Retreat back to the monastery, so that my fellow students can have
 their wounds treated immediately.
 B: Question one of the wounded bandits about the attack.
 C: Pursue the bandits into the marsh.

>b
 that this scrawny bandit is no more than thirteen. Malnourished and
 weak, it is amazing he is not dead from the beating he received.

 A: I feel admiration for his bravery, in spite of his conditions. I
 tell him he fought well.
 B: I feel pity for this boy who has turned to thievery to survive.
 C: I am furious that this urchin attacked us.

>a
 despite his pain. "I must fight well," he says, "because no one else
 will fight for me." He says it almost like a mantra. You ask your
 questions, and the boy gives you answers he appears to believe are
 true: the supplies you carry were targeted because they would be useful
 to the bandits, not because the outlaws wish to offend the Order of the
 Peach Tree. He does not know how many bandits there are, but he says
 that almost all that he knows were farmers, forced out of their homes
 by the foreigners who have been encroaching on the Middle Kingdom.

 A: I let the boy and the other wounded bandits go with no intention of
 bringing them to the law. They are people suffering from circumstances
 beyond their control.
 B: I let the boy go and warn him and the other bandits that they must
 cease their crimes against the Empire. I will make sure that their
 banditry is reported to the local magistrate, but will hope they repent
 of their crimes.

>a

 Lu Jin takes a deep breath, as though deciding whether or not to share
 a thought, before he says, "It wasn't like this before the foreigners
 came. With them eating up resources?and with the Emperor standing by
 while his people starve and lose their land to these invaders?the
 people have no hope."

 Lu Jin's openness is surprising, but what he says amounts to treason.
 Questioning the Emperor's will so openly will certainly lead him to
 trouble.

 Does that trouble start with you?

 A: How dare he question the Emperor! I challenge him immediately.
 B: I agree with Lu Jin, but I respond noncommittally. Just because he
 is asking for trouble by speaking his mind does not mean I will risk my
 neck.
 C: I agree with Lu Jin and am glad to find someone to discuss the
 Empire's problems with.
 D: I do nothing. I am not interested in politics.

>a
 students, who watch you anxiously. "Perhaps another time."

 His refusal to fight puts you in an awkward position; if he refused to
 defend himself, you could be thrown out of the Order of the Peach Tree
 for attacking a fellow student without provocation.

 A: He insulted the Emperor. I cannot delay in seeking retribution.
 B: I wait, but I do not forget.

>b

 As you walk back to the monastery, you take a moment to consider the
 path that has brought you here. As a child, you were told stories of
 the Order of the Peach Tree, a monastery where many great warriors were
 trained. But it was not just the combat skills that enticed you. Every
 hundred years, one member of the Order of the Peach Tree is given the
 honor of consulting the Dragon Sage. That monk may ask a single
 question of the wise dragon. It is only thirty years until the next
 monk of the Order of the Peach Tree is selected, and you are determined
 to be the order's representative to the dragon.

 What question drives you toward this goal?

 A: I know I have much to learn of combat, but I am convinced that the
 Dragon Sage holds the key to greatness beyond what I can learn from
 mortal teachers. I plan to ask, "How can I become the greatest warrior
 in the world?"
 B: The strife I see in the Middle Kingdom?so recently reiterated by my
 encounter with the bandits?disturbs me greatly. I wish to see balance
 restored to the Middle Kingdom, so that the Emperor is once again in
 alignment with the Heavens. I will ask, "How can the Empire return to
 Heaven's Favor?"
 C: I am more concerned with esoteric knowledge than worldly issues. I
 wish to ask, "What is the first question?"
 D: My question is simple: "Why do kites fly?"

>b
 Emperor back on the path of Heaven, it is the Dragon Sage.

 A few days after the conflict with the outlaws in the marsh, Abbot Bao
 Ho sends for you to meet him beneath the peach tree. The tree itself is
 ancient: you have been told that most peach trees live, at most, fifty
 years, but this one has grown wide around the trunk and gnarled in the
 branches. Despite its age, it continues to produce fruit. Some say that
 this is the peach tree after which the monastery was named, a true
 immortal tree in the breed of trees that represents immortality. Others
 believe it to be a descendant of the original peach tree, the result of
 careful cultivation by the monks who teach you.

 What do you think?

 A: It must be immortal.
 B: If it is grown from the cuttings of earlier trees, the continuation
 of its line makes it immortal despite its many incarnations.
 C: The tree is clearly not immortal; only the superstitious and
 uneducated would believe so.
 D: I haven't given it much thought.
 E: I don't care.

>b

 The peach tree's branches extend over a reflection pool. It is normally
 a very peaceful spot, but now the atmosphere is tense. Abbot Bao stands
 there with Master Shen, the oldest teacher in the monastery, at his
 side, and the two men wear identical expressions of concern.

 Just as you arrive, Lu Jin approaches from the other side. He appears
 as surprised to see you as you are to see him.

 "Greetings, my senior students," Abbot Bao says in greeting.

 Lu Jin bows. "Do you have training for us today, masters?"

 Master Shen chuckles. "Always so eager for more, Lu Jin? As I recall,
 at our last bout between the senior students, Liu Meili gave you a very
 fine black eye."

 Lu Jin bares his teeth at you in a smile that is neither humble nor
 friendly.

 "Unfortunately, my students, this is no simple matter of training,"
 Abbot Bao says. "Or, perhaps it is, but not of our usual devising. You
 told us of your experience with the bandits along the road to the
 Order, and I am afraid it is becoming an all too common experience in
 these interesting times. Too many people of the Middle Kingdom are
 turning to thieving and banditry to make their ends meet, and too many
 honest folk are made to suffer."

 Master Shen grunts, and you think you hear him mutter something about a
 distinct lack of honest folk, but it is unclear.

 The abbot continues: "Because you have some experience, and because we
 feel it will be a good test of your readiness to fully join the order,
 we have chosen the two of you to lead a group of students to the
 village of Kuei Xian, across the Baijiang Bridge, to solve the trouble
 locals are having with the bandits."

 Lu Jin blanches momentarily, but your teachers do not seem to notice.

 How do you respond to this mission?

 A: It is an honor to be chosen, even if I must share leadership with Lu
 Jin. I agree to set off at once.
 B: I can't wait to try my skills against real opponents again.
 C: Lu Jin's hesitation is an opportunity for me. I volunteer to take
 the team alone.
 D: I am not really interested in this interruption to my training.

>c
 rival's hesitation.

 "I feel it would be best to have both of you on this task," he says
 slowly. "If you are uncertain?"

 "No," says Lu Jin. "I am ready to do what the Order asks of me."

 Both Master Shen and Abbot Bao watch Lu Jin with some concern for
 another moment. Even though you will both be going together, it seems
 you have successfully undermined his position.

 There are actually fewer details than you would have expected for this
 mission. Neither Abbot Bao nor Master Shen knows how many bandits are
 present near Kuei Xian. They do know that the center of activity seems
 to be at Baijiang Bridge, an old stone bridge that remains from the
 years of the Sun Dynasty, when an army marched across it five horses at
 a time, or so legends say. Kuei Xian, which sits in the shadow of a
 huge, turtlelike karst hill in the foothills of the Yellow Mountains,
 is a small village, but with important enough history?and pleasant
 enough weather?that the governor of the province keeps his summer home
 there.

 Governor Rong is disinclined to ask the Emperor to help combat the
 problem directly. (You gather from Master Shen's muttered commentary
 that this would make it look as though he cannot solve the problems of
 his own district.) Instead, he has asked the Order of the Peach Tree
 for aid, and given the importance of the trade that flows across the
 Baijiang Bridge, and the order's dedication as protectors of the people
 of the Middle Kingdom, the abbot has agreed.

 Of course, should you and Lu Jin fail to quell the problem, more
 important resources than students will have to be expended, either by
 the Order or by the Emperor. This would bring dishonor to everyone:
 you, the order, Governor Rong, and possibly the Emperor himself in the
 face of the foreigners at his court.

 Abbot Bao tells you the names of the students he expects to accompany
 you. Several of them were present when the bandits attacked. You are to
 ready your equipment and leave in the morning.

 A: I seek out Lu Jin to discuss this mission.
 B: I go to my room to prepare for morning.

>a
 co-leader with you?but you're equally unenthusiastic about working with
 him. Still, as Master Shen would say, better to be prepared.

 You look over a map of the Baijiang Bridge, and, unsurprisingly, you
 conflict about every possible approach.

 Exasperated, Lu Jin finally says, "We may as well just ask them to
 leave, for all the good we're going to do."

 A: We could try negotiation. If we can find the leader, maybe we can
 work something out.
 B: What a ridiculous idea.

>a

 "Maybe we can," he agrees noncommittally.

 You discuss tactics for a little while longer, with greater success
 than previously, and you decide to turn in, to make sure you have
 prepared and rested enough for morning.

 The Order of the Peach Tree, though farther from the Yellow Mountains
 than Kuei Xian, is nestled among karst mountains that increase as you
 travel west toward the Baijiang River. The road is a well-traveled one,
 a drier route than the road you so recently traversed through the
 wetlands south of the monastery. Despite the traditional sengfu monk
 garb that you and your fellow students wear?the high boots, pants, and
 one-sleeved robe, tied with a sash?which marks you as members of the
 Order, you are given no more notice than the other travelers you
 encounter. There are eighteen of you, total: you and Lu Jin each have a
 team of eight students, for good luck. Each team is nine, a symbol of
 permanence, and of synergy with the heavens.

 Does the numerology comfort you?

 A: Of course. When embarking upon matters like this, I am glad for any
 numerical advantage.
 B: No. The outcome will be determined by greater skill, not by numbers.
 C: We are all one team, making us eighteen, which is neither lucky nor
 unlucky. We will make our own fate.
 D: More superstitious nonsense.
 E: I hadn't noticed the numbers before.

>b
 the side of the bandits. You pass a number of merchants with carts
 drawn by water buffalo, messengers and warriors on horseback, and
 travelers walking along the road with bundles on their backs. It is a
 fine day: the sky is blue, the clouds are wisps, and the summer air is
 thick with the smell of blossoms and ripening rice. As on your last
 trip from the monastery, you are traveling with a horse and cart, full
 of the food and supplies you will need for your journey.

 It is up to you and Lu Jin to set the tone for this mission. The trip
 to Kuei Xian takes three days at a steady pace.

 A: Three days is fast enough; the situation is urgent, but unlikely to
 get much worse in three days' time.
 B: This mission is urgent, and we have been trained to move quickly. We
 can make the trip in two days.

>a
 with your fellow students. How will you use it?

 A: Continue planning strategy with Lu Jin.
 B: Stop early at night so I can run the students through training
 drills, keeping our fighting skills fresh.
 C: Consult the stars at night, watching for signs that will make clear
 the most beneficial path.
 D: Focus on the well-being of the students, keeping them entertained
 with other tales of travel.

>a
 negotiation, believing that the bandits can be reasoned with. What is
 your strategy in facing the bandits?

 A: Fight them, and show them the power of the Order of the Peach Tree.
 B: Devise a clever plan to stop their raids, but avoid a direct
 conflict.
 C: Attempt to contact their leaders and negotiate some form of peace.

>c
 would like to support them, but given your orders, you cannot do it
 openly. Perhaps you can persuade them to take their business elsewhere
 and find a way to help them against the foreigners in the future.

 On the third morning of your journey, the terrain has shifted from
 valley fields to the true foothills of the Yellow Mountains. Forests
 have closed around you, mostly pine, fir, and cedar here, though you
 know there are also bamboo forests near Kuei Xian. You are nearing what
 could be enemy territory, depending on how far out the raiders have
 roamed.

 As you walk, you hear a human noise in the distance?it sounds as though
 it might be sobbing, or perhaps low voices. It is too far to tell.

 What do you do?

 A: Send one of the students to scout ahead to discover the source of
 the noise as we continue toward Kuei Xian. The scout can catch up.
 B: Send one of the students to scout ahead and wait for him to return.
 C: Scout ahead on my own.

>c
 though you walk on rice paper. The sound is definitely sobbing, and you
 see a flash of red through the fir trees. A few steps closer and you
 see that a beautiful young woman is kneeling in the fir needles,
 crying. She wears a heavy qipao, a long dress with a high neckline made
 of thick, brocaded fabric. Her hair is woven up into an elaborate
 headpiece, clearly marking her as a member of the aristocracy.

 She looks up when she sees you approach, and, were it not for the
 tears, she could be a model for a painting: her narrow face and
 close-set eyes, her thin eyebrows and high cheekbones are the ideal of
 courtly beauty. But there are tears, and her lovely face is contorted
 in pain.

 A: I go to help her at once!
 B: This seems highly suspicious to me. I approach, but carefully.
 C: It is helpless women like her that make it so difficult for women
 like me to get respect. Let her figure it out herself.

>b
 "Oh, kind monk, could you help me?" she calls, her voice as lovely as
 the rest of her appearance. "My foot has become caught in a trap!"

 A: I go help her immediately.
 B: This still seems suspicious. I step closer, but do not yet agree to
 help.

>b

 She grins, though there is real pain on her face, and after the first
 flash of amusement, it turns into a grimace. "A fox trap, I'm afraid."

 Behind the woman, seven fox tails flare to life, revealing that this is
 no true woman at all. She is a huli jing, a mischievous fox spirit that
 delights particularly in tormenting monks.

 "Why should I help you?" you ask.

 She shakes her head. "Why is it always the wise ones who find me in
 such a predicament?" she asks, mostly to herself. "I will make it worth
 your while, monk. I can offer you unimaginable pleasure," she says with
 a coy wink that, upon the slight shift of her body, becomes a wince. "I
 promise that we fox spirits are exceedingly creative."

 A: Unimaginable pleasure? Sounds good to me.
 B: I want information about the bandits.
 C: Her favor. It can never hurt to have a spirit on my side.

>c
 have earned my good will by freeing me now."

 You open the trap and the huli jing snatches her leg back, as though
 afraid the trap will bite her again. She stands and bows to you.

 "My name is Feng," she says. "And I am in your debt. We will meet
 again."

 You make your way back to the road and your companions with no further
 trouble.

 Baijiang Bridge is a huge, stone structure that spans the width of the
 Baijiang River. From this side, you can see the large black turtle of a
 mountain that rises over Kuei Xian. Now that you are here, it is time
 to put your plan into action. Are you ready to act on your plan?

 A: I stand by my first plan.
 B: I want to rethink my options.

>a
 countrymen, people who have fallen on hard times due to the incursion
 of foreigners in the Middle Kingdom. Though you may not agree with
 their tactics, you want to help their cause. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.
 C: Ask around the village and, based on local gossip, intuit the most
 probable location for their camp.

>c
 direction, but the people of Kuei Xian leave you at a loss. You'll have
 to try another way. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.

>a
 bandit camp without being noticed. You and your fellow students walk
 into the camp calmly, as though you belong, despite your sengfu
 clothing marking you as monks of the Order of the Peach Tree. The
 bandits, most of whom do seem to come from humble backgrounds, have no
 idea what to do with you. Because you do not appear to be hostile, they
 seem unwilling to confront you.

 Finally, a large woman of middle age, her hair wrapped in the same blue
 turban you see throughout the camp, stands in front of your group.

 "What is your business?" she asks sternly. You imagine that this is the
 same tone of voice she uses when she suspects her children of having
 gotten into mischief.

 "We'd like to speak to your leader," Lu Jin says politely.

 The woman looks suspicious, but after a moment, she nods, then beckons
 for you to follow. In the center of the camp?which gives the appearance
 of being a tent city, something quickly dismantled to move?there is a
 large fire, at which sit a number of men and women talking seriously.

 "Deng Ping," the woman says loudly, and the tallest of the men, wearing
 clothing slightly better cared for than that of his peers, stands.
 "Order of the Peach Tree to see you."

 Deng Ping approaches suspiciously and waits for you to speak.

 A: Begin by offering our condolences for the misfortune that brought
 the bandits here.
 B: Get straight to business: explain that we were instructed to oust
 them, but that we'd rather see whether negotiation is possible.
 C: Try to strike some fear into their hearts: we may sympathize with
 their plight, but the next group will not.

>a
 "Do not offer us pity, monk," he spits. "You may as well be in league
 with the laowai, for all that you do to prevent their incursions. Every
 day that passes, their power and influence grows, and it is time for
 someone to stand against them. If that means us, so be it."

 There are cheers from among the bandits, and the atmosphere that was
 previously uncertain has taken on a distinct air of hostility.

 "I intended no dishonor," you begin, but Deng Ping scoffs.

 "Tell your masters?tell the Son of Heaven himself?that we will do
 whatever it takes to rid the laowai from our land." He steps forward,
 aiming a finger at your chest. "Whatever it takes."

 A: I cannot refuse a challenge to my honor?and neither can he.
 Challenge him to a fight.
 B: Accept defeat. Clearly he will not listen to me.
 C: Find out what we can offer them to change their minds.

>a
 him to fight a member of the order, one on one. If he loses, he is
 bound by honor to leave Kuei Xian alone.

 In order to avoid losing face among the bandits, Deng Ping accepts your
 challenge. Who will fight for the Order?

 A: Me.
 B: Lu Jin.

>a
 and quick, and though he has little skill, a well-timed hammerstrike to
 your head sets your ears ringing and brings you to your knees.

 Your fellow students collect you and load you into the cart with the
 supplies, preparing for the long trip back to the monastery.

 Lu Jin, however, tells you of his decision to stay with the bandits. "I
 believe I can help their cause," he explains. "Balance must return to
 the Middle Kingdom."

 A: Try to persuade Lu Jin not to go.
 B: Support Lu Jin's choice.
 C: Good riddance.

>b
 while you work from inside the Order.

 You are sure you will meet each other again.

 As you return to the monastery, morale among the students is at an
 utter low. Not only did one of your number abandon the Order
 completely, but you have nothing to show for your efforts.

 Your first real mission on behalf of the Order is a failure.

 After you tell Abbot Bao and Master Shen about what has happened, they
 consult the heavens to determine the best course of action. Ultimately,
 the Order does nothing further?and despite your failure, attacks by the
 bandits near Kuei Xian die down for a time. Though this initially seems
 like good news, Governor Rong has heard about the events that
 transpired from his informants?likely village gossips, who may have
 heard it from the bandits themselves. No credit will be given to the
 Order of the Peach Tree for the temporary peace.

 Master Shen admits to you that he and the abbot had planned to test you
 to become a full member of the Order had your mission been a success.
 Now, you will have to prove yourself again through humble service and
 continued training before you can become a monk, rather than the senior
 student.

 Compared to your dishonor at the hands of the bandits, the wait to test
 is a small setback?but what if it means that you will not be the one
 chosen to consult the Dragon Sage? You will have to work even harder to
 prove that you are worthy before the dragon reappears in the Middle
 Kingdom.

 There are rumors upon rumors of what happens during the final test that
 separates students from monks. You have heard that it involves tracking
 and defeating a wild tiger. Some say that you must face and disperse a
 hungry ghost. Still others say that the true final test is a measure of
 the spirit and the ability of the student to achieve a perfect moment
 of inner peace.

 Given the scars you have seen on the fully accepted monks, if the test
 is about finding inner peace, inner peace leaves marks.

 Master Shen leads you to the inner temple of the monastery. He walks in
 a relaxed fashion, leaning on his staff, as though he is merely
 observing the growth of the peach tree, not leading you to where your
 fate will be decided.

 How are you feeling about this test?

 A: I am eager to begin. My training has prepared me well.
 B: I am nervous. I want to do well, but I fear failure.
 C: I am calm. This is a moment, and I exist within it.

>c
 its weight: the old master's strength, his wisdom, and his confidence
 in you all flow through that simple touch.

 He stops in front of the huge doors to the inner temple, carved with
 intricate scroll work and the shapes of the five animals: dragon,
 tiger, snake, crane, and leopard. After a short moment of waiting, he
 gestures with his staff for you to push the doors open. As you do, he
 falls into step next to you and you enter the chamber. The inner temple
 is humble: a small chamber with candles lining three of the four walls.
 Above the candles are paintings and sculptures of the spiritual animals
 of kung fu and the immortals. On the far wall, on a raised shelf above
 the flame, is a Buddha statue, one hand resting in his lap, the other
 raised in blessing.

 Abbot Bao stands in front of the last candle, lighting it from his own
 small candle. Once the room is lit, he blows his candle out.

 "Liu Meili, you have been deemed worthy of the final test to join the
 Order of the Peach Tree," says the abbot as he turns to you. "Do you
 accept this honor, ready to face the challenges before you and take on
 the role of monk?"

 A: "I accept."
 B: "I do not feel ready."

>a
 shallower, as befitting a teacher to a student.

 "There are three challenges in the test to become a member of the
 Order," Abbot Bao explains. "You must complete two of the three
 successfully. Consider your options wisely, as only one failure can be
 forgiven."

 "Part of the test is identifying your weaknesses and being honest about
 your strengths," Master Shen says quietly. "Know yourself, student, and
 you will triumph."

 "The three challenges are these," Abbot Bao continues. "The first is
 the Dashanmen, a challenge of your combat skills against the monks of
 the Order. You will enter a dark chamber, and you must cross from one
 side to the other while being attacked."

 Master Shen chuckles. "In the old days, we fought to the death. Too
 messy. Now we stop attacking as soon as you are unconscious."

 This commentary does not serve to give you confidence.

 "For the second challenge, you must carry an urn filled with hot coals
 from the monastery down to the river. There, you may release the urn
 and bathe your arms in the cold water."

 The distance from the monastery to the river is short enough when not
 carrying an urn, but it will certainly feel longer with burning metal
 on your arms. That certainly explains some of the scars you have seen
 on the monks of the Order!

 "For the third challenge, you must retrieve the Scroll of Destiny from
 behind Bingdian Waterfall, and learn the lesson it holds," Abbot Bao
 finishes.

 "Don't worry," says Master Shen, "it is stored in a waterproof scroll
 case. You'll be able to read it."

 Which task would you like to undertake first?

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will carry the urn of coals.
 C: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 been cleared of students, and only a handful of monks are here to
 witness the beginning of your challenge. Just inside the gates, a
 brazier is lit, and over it is suspended a large urn, full of burning
 coals. Aligned to the cardinal directions are four animals: to the
 north is the tortoise; south, the phoenix; east, the dragon; and west,
 the tiger.

 While the metalwork is beautiful, it mostly looks hot.

 You must carry the urn with your forearms from the monastery to the
 river below. How will you face this challenge?

 A: I grit my teeth and carry the heavy load through sheer will.
 B: I will not rely on strength alone, but will use the heat to further
 forge my chi.

>b
 fire, opposed by the tortoise, a creature of water. The dragon, which
 represents the element of wood, is opposed by the tiger, which
 represents metal. Although you are tempted to focus on the idea that
 the fire has the potential to consume wood and metal, but is opposed by
 water and only lends strength back to its own element, you know that
 there is still a fifth element to consider.

 There is void, the element of the center. Your own mind must be empty
 in order for the chi to flow through you, carrying the strength?and
 freedom?necessary to lift the urn. You still your mind, breathe, and
 reach for the urn.

 You feel the pain along your forearms, and it is excruciating?but it
 washes over you, just a part of the moment. With each breath, you let
 the moment flow and change, accepting it without worrying over past or
 future, or even holding a thought. Your feet know this path; they have
 walked it hundreds of times on the simple task of fetching water. You
 allow them to carry you.

 You breathe. You exist. The moment comes and passes, and another
 follows on its heels.

 You reach the river almost before you realize you are there, and you
 calmly lower the urn into the water. It hisses with steam, bathing you
 in hot air as your arms enter the cold stream. You realize that your
 body feels the shock of the contrast, but you only observe this as
 another part of the moment before letting it, too, go. When you return
 to the monastery, you show the monks your new scars to prove that you
 have withstood the challenge. You have passed. What scars do you bear?

 A: The dragon and the tiger.
 B: The tortoise and the phoenix.

>a

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 where the dry land becomes marsh, Bingdian Waterfall is on the far side
 of the karst mountain. The trip there is not a long one, but it is
 hard, as there is no path. As you begin your ascent, you find some goat
 paths to travel, delaying the true climb until the waterfall is in
 sight.

 You feel the mist of the waterfall before you see it. Despite the warm
 weather, the air takes on a clammy chill?the water here is always
 freezing, nearly ice cold. You rub your hands together and approach the
 waterfall. It cascades down the side of the mountain into a pool of
 unknown depth. It falls from perhaps ten times your own height, and
 somewhere in that length there is a cave or a hole behind it, in which
 lies the Scroll of Destiny.

 How will you attempt to find the scroll?

 A: Climb the mountain next to the waterfall until I see it.
 B: Use my chi to propel me up the side of the mountain, like a lizard.
 C: Make observations from below to calculate the most likely location
 for the scroll.
 D: Fashion an impromptu spear from the available wood and throw it
 until it hits an indentation.

>b
 on your climb. From there, you are able to scramble up the side of the
 mountain by keeping your energy focused, and by borrowing some of the
 grounded nature of the mountain you climb. You can sense from the
 energy of the mountain where the indentation that stores the scroll
 will be, and you dart your hand into the cold water, drawing the scroll
 case out as quickly as if you were pulling a fish from a stream. You
 turn and jump, using your chi to float to the ground. You sit down next
 to the pool, the roar of the waterfall drowning out any other noise,
 and open the scroll case. Inside is what feels like an ancient scroll,
 marked with diagrams that show various techniques you have learned
 while studying at the Order of the Peach Tree. But though there are
 many images to contemplate, most of the scroll is empty. There do not
 seem to be any great secrets contained in the writing here. You do not
 see a hidden final technique explained, nor a clue about how to bring
 balance to the Middle Kingdom.

 What do you wish to do?

 A: Meditate on the scroll. An answer will come.
 B: Analyze the scroll and puzzle out its meaning.

>a
 despite your intention to sit until you have found wisdom, you soon
 become cold from your proximity to the waterfall. Your limbs grow
 stiff, and rather than thinking about the scroll, you begin to think
 about your bed, a warm meal, and a good stretch. Perhaps finding the
 scroll was the real challenge and you have already accomplished the
 important step of this task.

 When you return home to the monastery, however, you realize that the
 scroll itself was definitely the more important piece of the test.
 Abbot Bao is intent on hearing what you have learned, and though you
 stumble over a couple of ideas, your words are clearly unconvincing.
 Abbot Bao shakes his head and turns away, leaving you to contemplate
 your failure.

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.

 "Look out!"

 The noise of battle is distracting, and it takes you almost too long to
 realize that the warning was shouted to you. An outlaw wearing a blue
 turban is charging toward you, his longspear leveled at your heart.
 What will you do?

 A: Stand firm, blocking the spear away at the last moment and slashing
 twin tiger claws across his face.
 B: Pounce toward him at the last moment, springing like a leopard, and
 bring an elbow down on his head.
 C: Dart off to the side, balancing on one leg like a crane before
 delivering a swift kick to his knee.
 D: Weave hypnotically in my stance, and when he strikes, I am no longer
 there; I launch a series of quick, snakelike strikes to the pressure
 points in his exposed rib cage.
 E: Make a series of flashy moves that draw his target toward my right
 side, then move to the left, delivering a reiken strike to the right
 side of his head as he passes by.
 F: Remain still, my hands low at the chi center of my body, and at the
 moment he would hit me, circle his spear away and shift myself away
 from the strike.

>go down
 injured side. He looks suddently exhausted, courtesy of the disruption
 in his chi that your knowledge of the mystical Snake technique allowed.

 With your opponent deterred, but not out of the fight, how do you
 follow up your attack?

 A: Use a palm heel strike under the chin to drive his head backwards,
 tearing down with a tiger claw on his face as he falls.
 B: Drive into him with a series of fast leopard punches down the center
 of his body until he falls to the ground.
 C: Take his leg out from under him with a sweeping straight kick,
 delivering a wing strike to his neck at the same moment, graceful as a
 crane.
 D: With my fingers tight like a snake's head, strike out at his face
 and neck in a complex pattern of several hits that impact on nerve
 points, disabling him.
 E: Feign a low kick to the knee, and when he moves the spear shaft down
 to block, shoot a dragon tooth strike?my fingers separated in a V?into
 his eyes before sweeping him from behind.
 F: His death would be senseless and against the Buddha nature; pivot
 around behind him and lock him in a sleeper hold.

>go down
 chi, drop him to the ground, unconscious. He'll be feeling that when he
 wakes up.

 The outlaws continue toward you and your fellow students, flashes of
 blue catching your eye against the greens and browns of the marsh
 surrounding your path. It is hard to imagine that only moments ago, the
 nine of you were making your way back to the monastery of the Order of
 the Peach Tree, students on the simple assignment of escorting a
 wagonload of supplies home.

 The students have mostly remained on the path, where their footing is
 more certain, but the outlaws appear to have little trouble navigating
 the wetlands. While they fight like untrained peasants, numbers are
 definitely on their side.

 It's time to get serious. Drawing on the training you received before
 entering the Order of the Peach Tree, you prepare your next attack. How
 will you fight?

 A: Draw my sword. This blade was forged by the most expert smiths in
 the Middle Kingdom, designed specifically to be used with the Celestial
 Sword style, taught only to the Imperial Family.
 B: Unhitch the horse from the cart of supplies. He is a mean beast?not
 the fine mare I trained on at my father's estate?but few monks could
 master a horse from as honorable a family as mine. I draw my blade and
 prepare to charge.
 C: Draw on my chi, as well the energy in the world around me. I can
 sense the life energies of my fellow students and the approaching
 outlaws.
 D: Release the bindings that secure my longspear to my back. It is only
 one of the many weapons I have mastered in my wanderings, and it is a
 good choice to keep the outlaws at bay.
 E: Why change? The style my masters at the Order of the Peach Tree are
 teaching me is a superior one, and I am eager to prove the worth of my
 unarmed style in battle.

>c
 what the uninformed consider "magic." But you know to be your power to
 be from the energies of the universe, which are at your beck and call.
 You also know that the perception of your abilities can be used against
 your enemies?and one day, you hope it will inspire your allies. For
 now, the other students shy away from you, except for Lu Jin, your
 primary rival for the place of senior student, who watches you with a
 wary eye.

 The battle that follows is hectic; the outlaws have little in the way
 of skill, but they make up for it in passion. They are determined to
 have your supplies, despite the clear skill shown by you and your
 fellow students. Though you are focused on keeping them from trying to
 kill you, you notice as you disable your opponents that they are
 skinny, likely the result of being poorly fed. You also note that a
 number of the outlaws are women.

 Does that surprise you?

 A: Yes. Fighting is the realm of warriors, and the role of the warrior
 falls to the men.
 B: No. Outlaws have always bucked convention; why bother following
 social rules?
 C: Yes, but it is nice to know that I am not alone in questioning
 traditional roles.
 D: No. I am used to fighting side by side among men and women
 accomplished in the way of battle.

>go down
 Luckily for you, the Order of the Peach Tree feels similarly. Are you a
 man or a woman?

 A: I am a man.
 B: I am a woman.

>b

 A: Yin.
 B: Meili.
 C: Yan.
 D: None of these is my name.

>b

 And what is your family name?

 A: Liu.
 B: Wong.
 C: Cao.
 D: None of these is my family name.

>a

 The bandits are quickly losing their resolve to steal your wagon; they
 still have numbers on their side, but many have fallen, wounded or
 dead, at your feet. You hear the far-off sound of a whistle, and the
 bandits begin to disengage, quickly fading back into the marsh. Though
 you and your fellow students have done a formidable job of holding off
 the bandits, you see that your fellows have taken some injuries as
 well.

 What do you do?

 A: Retreat back to the monastery, so that my fellow students can have
 their wounds treated immediately.
 B: Question one of the wounded bandits about the attack.
 C: Pursue the bandits into the marsh.

>b
 that this scrawny bandit is no more than thirteen. Malnourished and
 weak, it is amazing he is not dead from the beating he received.

 A: I feel admiration for his bravery, in spite of his conditions. I
 tell him he fought well.
 B: I feel pity for this boy who has turned to thievery to survive.
 C: I am furious that this urchin attacked us.

>a
 despite his pain. "I must fight well," he says, "because no one else
 will fight for me." He says it almost like a mantra. You ask your
 questions, and the boy gives you answers he appears to believe are
 true: the supplies you carry were targeted because they would be useful
 to the bandits, not because the outlaws wish to offend the Order of the
 Peach Tree. He does not know how many bandits there are, but he says
 that almost all that he knows were farmers, forced out of their homes
 by the foreigners who have been encroaching on the Middle Kingdom.

 A: I let the boy and the other wounded bandits go with no intention of
 bringing them to the law. They are people suffering from circumstances
 beyond their control.
 B: I let the boy go and warn him and the other bandits that they must
 cease their crimes against the Empire. I will make sure that their
 banditry is reported to the local magistrate, but will hope they repent
 of their crimes.

>a

 Lu Jin takes a deep breath, as though deciding whether or not to share
 a thought, before he says, "It wasn't like this before the foreigners
 came. With them eating up resources?and with the Emperor standing by
 while his people starve and lose their land to these invaders?the
 people have no hope."

 Lu Jin's openness is surprising, but what he says amounts to treason.
 Questioning the Emperor's will so openly will certainly lead him to
 trouble.

 Does that trouble start with you?

 A: How dare he question the Emperor! I challenge him immediately.
 B: I agree with Lu Jin, but I respond noncommittally. Just because he
 is asking for trouble by speaking his mind does not mean I will risk my
 neck.
 C: I agree with Lu Jin and am glad to find someone to discuss the
 Empire's problems with.
 D: I do nothing. I am not interested in politics.

>a
 students, who watch you anxiously. "Perhaps another time."

 His refusal to fight puts you in an awkward position; if he refused to
 defend himself, you could be thrown out of the Order of the Peach Tree
 for attacking a fellow student without provocation.

 A: He insulted the Emperor. I cannot delay in seeking retribution.
 B: I wait, but I do not forget.

>b

 As you walk back to the monastery, you take a moment to consider the
 path that has brought you here. As a child, you were told stories of
 the Order of the Peach Tree, a monastery where many great warriors were
 trained. But it was not just the combat skills that enticed you. Every
 hundred years, one member of the Order of the Peach Tree is given the
 honor of consulting the Dragon Sage. That monk may ask a single
 question of the wise dragon. It is only thirty years until the next
 monk of the Order of the Peach Tree is selected, and you are determined
 to be the order's representative to the dragon.

 What question drives you toward this goal?

 A: I know I have much to learn of combat, but I am convinced that the
 Dragon Sage holds the key to greatness beyond what I can learn from
 mortal teachers. I plan to ask, "How can I become the greatest warrior
 in the world?"
 B: The strife I see in the Middle Kingdom?so recently reiterated by my
 encounter with the bandits?disturbs me greatly. I wish to see balance
 restored to the Middle Kingdom, so that the Emperor is once again in
 alignment with the Heavens. I will ask, "How can the Empire return to
 Heaven's Favor?"
 C: I am more concerned with esoteric knowledge than worldly issues. I
 wish to ask, "What is the first question?"
 D: My question is simple: "Why do kites fly?"

>b
 Emperor back on the path of Heaven, it is the Dragon Sage.

 A few days after the conflict with the outlaws in the marsh, Abbot Bao
 Ho sends for you to meet him beneath the peach tree. The tree itself is
 ancient: you have been told that most peach trees live, at most, fifty
 years, but this one has grown wide around the trunk and gnarled in the
 branches. Despite its age, it continues to produce fruit. Some say that
 this is the peach tree after which the monastery was named, a true
 immortal tree in the breed of trees that represents immortality. Others
 believe it to be a descendant of the original peach tree, the result of
 careful cultivation by the monks who teach you.

 What do you think?

 A: It must be immortal.
 B: If it is grown from the cuttings of earlier trees, the continuation
 of its line makes it immortal despite its many incarnations.
 C: The tree is clearly not immortal; only the superstitious and
 uneducated would believe so.
 D: I haven't given it much thought.
 E: I don't care.

>b

 The peach tree's branches extend over a reflection pool. It is normally
 a very peaceful spot, but now the atmosphere is tense. Abbot Bao stands
 there with Master Shen, the oldest teacher in the monastery, at his
 side, and the two men wear identical expressions of concern.

 Just as you arrive, Lu Jin approaches from the other side. He appears
 as surprised to see you as you are to see him.

 "Greetings, my senior students," Abbot Bao says in greeting.

 Lu Jin bows. "Do you have training for us today, masters?"

 Master Shen chuckles. "Always so eager for more, Lu Jin? As I recall,
 at our last bout between the senior students, Liu Meili gave you a very
 fine black eye."

 Lu Jin bares his teeth at you in a smile that is neither humble nor
 friendly.

 "Unfortunately, my students, this is no simple matter of training,"
 Abbot Bao says. "Or, perhaps it is, but not of our usual devising. You
 told us of your experience with the bandits along the road to the
 Order, and I am afraid it is becoming an all too common experience in
 these interesting times. Too many people of the Middle Kingdom are
 turning to thieving and banditry to make their ends meet, and too many
 honest folk are made to suffer."

 Master Shen grunts, and you think you hear him mutter something about a
 distinct lack of honest folk, but it is unclear.

 The abbot continues: "Because you have some experience, and because we
 feel it will be a good test of your readiness to fully join the order,
 we have chosen the two of you to lead a group of students to the
 village of Kuei Xian, across the Baijiang Bridge, to solve the trouble
 locals are having with the bandits."

 Lu Jin blanches momentarily, but your teachers do not seem to notice.

 How do you respond to this mission?

 A: It is an honor to be chosen, even if I must share leadership with Lu
 Jin. I agree to set off at once.
 B: I can't wait to try my skills against real opponents again.
 C: Lu Jin's hesitation is an opportunity for me. I volunteer to take
 the team alone.
 D: I am not really interested in this interruption to my training.

>c
 rival's hesitation.

 "I feel it would be best to have both of you on this task," he says
 slowly. "If you are uncertain?"

 "No," says Lu Jin. "I am ready to do what the Order asks of me."

 Both Master Shen and Abbot Bao watch Lu Jin with some concern for
 another moment. Even though you will both be going together, it seems
 you have successfully undermined his position.

 There are actually fewer details than you would have expected for this
 mission. Neither Abbot Bao nor Master Shen knows how many bandits are
 present near Kuei Xian. They do know that the center of activity seems
 to be at Baijiang Bridge, an old stone bridge that remains from the
 years of the Sun Dynasty, when an army marched across it five horses at
 a time, or so legends say. Kuei Xian, which sits in the shadow of a
 huge, turtlelike karst hill in the foothills of the Yellow Mountains,
 is a small village, but with important enough history?and pleasant
 enough weather?that the governor of the province keeps his summer home
 there.

 Governor Rong is disinclined to ask the Emperor to help combat the
 problem directly. (You gather from Master Shen's muttered commentary
 that this would make it look as though he cannot solve the problems of
 his own district.) Instead, he has asked the Order of the Peach Tree
 for aid, and given the importance of the trade that flows across the
 Baijiang Bridge, and the order's dedication as protectors of the people
 of the Middle Kingdom, the abbot has agreed.

 Of course, should you and Lu Jin fail to quell the problem, more
 important resources than students will have to be expended, either by
 the Order or by the Emperor. This would bring dishonor to everyone:
 you, the order, Governor Rong, and possibly the Emperor himself in the
 face of the foreigners at his court.

 Abbot Bao tells you the names of the students he expects to accompany
 you. Several of them were present when the bandits attacked. You are to
 ready your equipment and leave in the morning.

 A: I seek out Lu Jin to discuss this mission.
 B: I go to my room to prepare for morning.

>a
 co-leader with you?but you're equally unenthusiastic about working with
 him. Still, as Master Shen would say, better to be prepared.

 You look over a map of the Baijiang Bridge, and, unsurprisingly, you
 conflict about every possible approach.

 Exasperated, Lu Jin finally says, "We may as well just ask them to
 leave, for all the good we're going to do."

 A: We could try negotiation. If we can find the leader, maybe we can
 work something out.
 B: What a ridiculous idea.

>a

 "Maybe we can," he agrees noncommittally.

 You discuss tactics for a little while longer, with greater success
 than previously, and you decide to turn in, to make sure you have
 prepared and rested enough for morning.

 The Order of the Peach Tree, though farther from the Yellow Mountains
 than Kuei Xian, is nestled among karst mountains that increase as you
 travel west toward the Baijiang River. The road is a well-traveled one,
 a drier route than the road you so recently traversed through the
 wetlands south of the monastery. Despite the traditional sengfu monk
 garb that you and your fellow students wear?the high boots, pants, and
 one-sleeved robe, tied with a sash?which marks you as members of the
 Order, you are given no more notice than the other travelers you
 encounter. There are eighteen of you, total: you and Lu Jin each have a
 team of eight students, for good luck. Each team is nine, a symbol of
 permanence, and of synergy with the heavens.

 Does the numerology comfort you?

 A: Of course. When embarking upon matters like this, I am glad for any
 numerical advantage.
 B: No. The outcome will be determined by greater skill, not by numbers.
 C: We are all one team, making us eighteen, which is neither lucky nor
 unlucky. We will make our own fate.
 D: More superstitious nonsense.
 E: I hadn't noticed the numbers before.

>b
 the side of the bandits. You pass a number of merchants with carts
 drawn by water buffalo, messengers and warriors on horseback, and
 travelers walking along the road with bundles on their backs. It is a
 fine day: the sky is blue, the clouds are wisps, and the summer air is
 thick with the smell of blossoms and ripening rice. As on your last
 trip from the monastery, you are traveling with a horse and cart, full
 of the food and supplies you will need for your journey.

 It is up to you and Lu Jin to set the tone for this mission. The trip
 to Kuei Xian takes three days at a steady pace.

 A: Three days is fast enough; the situation is urgent, but unlikely to
 get much worse in three days' time.
 B: This mission is urgent, and we have been trained to move quickly. We
 can make the trip in two days.

>a
 with your fellow students. How will you use it?

 A: Continue planning strategy with Lu Jin.
 B: Stop early at night so I can run the students through training
 drills, keeping our fighting skills fresh.
 C: Consult the stars at night, watching for signs that will make clear
 the most beneficial path.
 D: Focus on the well-being of the students, keeping them entertained
 with other tales of travel.

>a
 negotiation, believing that the bandits can be reasoned with. What is
 your strategy in facing the bandits?

 A: Fight them, and show them the power of the Order of the Peach Tree.
 B: Devise a clever plan to stop their raids, but avoid a direct
 conflict.
 C: Attempt to contact their leaders and negotiate some form of peace.

>c
 would like to support them, but given your orders, you cannot do it
 openly. Perhaps you can persuade them to take their business elsewhere
 and find a way to help them against the foreigners in the future.

 On the third morning of your journey, the terrain has shifted from
 valley fields to the true foothills of the Yellow Mountains. Forests
 have closed around you, mostly pine, fir, and cedar here, though you
 know there are also bamboo forests near Kuei Xian. You are nearing what
 could be enemy territory, depending on how far out the raiders have
 roamed.

 As you walk, you hear a human noise in the distance?it sounds as though
 it might be sobbing, or perhaps low voices. It is too far to tell.

 What do you do?

 A: Send one of the students to scout ahead to discover the source of
 the noise as we continue toward Kuei Xian. The scout can catch up.
 B: Send one of the students to scout ahead and wait for him to return.
 C: Scout ahead on my own.

>c
 though you walk on rice paper. The sound is definitely sobbing, and you
 see a flash of red through the fir trees. A few steps closer and you
 see that a beautiful young woman is kneeling in the fir needles,
 crying. She wears a heavy qipao, a long dress with a high neckline made
 of thick, brocaded fabric. Her hair is woven up into an elaborate
 headpiece, clearly marking her as a member of the aristocracy.

 She looks up when she sees you approach, and, were it not for the
 tears, she could be a model for a painting: her narrow face and
 close-set eyes, her thin eyebrows and high cheekbones are the ideal of
 courtly beauty. But there are tears, and her lovely face is contorted
 in pain.

 A: I go to help her at once!
 B: This seems highly suspicious to me. I approach, but carefully.
 C: It is helpless women like her that make it so difficult for women
 like me to get respect. Let her figure it out herself.

>b
 "Oh, kind monk, could you help me?" she calls, her voice as lovely as
 the rest of her appearance. "My foot has become caught in a trap!"

 A: I go help her immediately.
 B: This still seems suspicious. I step closer, but do not yet agree to
 help.

>b

 She grins, though there is real pain on her face, and after the first
 flash of amusement, it turns into a grimace. "A fox trap, I'm afraid."

 Behind the woman, seven fox tails flare to life, revealing that this is
 no true woman at all. She is a huli jing, a mischievous fox spirit that
 delights particularly in tormenting monks.

 "Why should I help you?" you ask.

 She shakes her head. "Why is it always the wise ones who find me in
 such a predicament?" she asks, mostly to herself. "I will make it worth
 your while, monk. I can offer you unimaginable pleasure," she says with
 a coy wink that, upon the slight shift of her body, becomes a wince. "I
 promise that we fox spirits are exceedingly creative."

 A: Unimaginable pleasure? Sounds good to me.
 B: I want information about the bandits.
 C: Her favor. It can never hurt to have a spirit on my side.

>c
 have earned my good will by freeing me now."

 You open the trap and the huli jing snatches her leg back, as though
 afraid the trap will bite her again. She stands and bows to you.

 "My name is Feng," she says. "And I am in your debt. We will meet
 again."

 You make your way back to the road and your companions with no further
 trouble.

 Baijiang Bridge is a huge, stone structure that spans the width of the
 Baijiang River. From this side, you can see the large black turtle of a
 mountain that rises over Kuei Xian. Now that you are here, it is time
 to put your plan into action. Are you ready to act on your plan?

 A: I stand by my first plan.
 B: I want to rethink my options.

>a
 countrymen, people who have fallen on hard times due to the incursion
 of foreigners in the Middle Kingdom. Though you may not agree with
 their tactics, you want to help their cause. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.
 C: Ask around the village and, based on local gossip, intuit the most
 probable location for their camp.

>c
 direction, but the people of Kuei Xian leave you at a loss. You'll have
 to try another way. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.

>a
 bandit camp without being noticed. You and your fellow students walk
 into the camp calmly, as though you belong, despite your sengfu
 clothing marking you as monks of the Order of the Peach Tree. The
 bandits, most of whom do seem to come from humble backgrounds, have no
 idea what to do with you. Because you do not appear to be hostile, they
 seem unwilling to confront you.

 Finally, a large woman of middle age, her hair wrapped in the same blue
 turban you see throughout the camp, stands in front of your group.

 "What is your business?" she asks sternly. You imagine that this is the
 same tone of voice she uses when she suspects her children of having
 gotten into mischief.

 "We'd like to speak to your leader," Lu Jin says politely.

 The woman looks suspicious, but after a moment, she nods, then beckons
 for you to follow. In the center of the camp?which gives the appearance
 of being a tent city, something quickly dismantled to move?there is a
 large fire, at which sit a number of men and women talking seriously.

 "Deng Ping," the woman says loudly, and the tallest of the men, wearing
 clothing slightly better cared for than that of his peers, stands.
 "Order of the Peach Tree to see you."

 Deng Ping approaches suspiciously and waits for you to speak.

 A: Begin by offering our condolences for the misfortune that brought
 the bandits here.
 B: Get straight to business: explain that we were instructed to oust
 them, but that we'd rather see whether negotiation is possible.
 C: Try to strike some fear into their hearts: we may sympathize with
 their plight, but the next group will not.

>a
 "Do not offer us pity, monk," he spits. "You may as well be in league
 with the laowai, for all that you do to prevent their incursions. Every
 day that passes, their power and influence grows, and it is time for
 someone to stand against them. If that means us, so be it."

 There are cheers from among the bandits, and the atmosphere that was
 previously uncertain has taken on a distinct air of hostility.

 "I intended no dishonor," you begin, but Deng Ping scoffs.

 "Tell your masters?tell the Son of Heaven himself?that we will do
 whatever it takes to rid the laowai from our land." He steps forward,
 aiming a finger at your chest. "Whatever it takes."

 A: I cannot refuse a challenge to my honor?and neither can he.
 Challenge him to a fight.
 B: Accept defeat. Clearly he will not listen to me.
 C: Find out what we can offer them to change their minds.

>a
 him to fight a member of the order, one on one. If he loses, he is
 bound by honor to leave Kuei Xian alone.

 In order to avoid losing face among the bandits, Deng Ping accepts your
 challenge. Who will fight for the Order?

 A: Me.
 B: Lu Jin.

>a
 and quick, and though he has little skill, a well-timed hammerstrike to
 your head sets your ears ringing and brings you to your knees.

 Your fellow students collect you and load you into the cart with the
 supplies, preparing for the long trip back to the monastery.

 Lu Jin, however, tells you of his decision to stay with the bandits. "I
 believe I can help their cause," he explains. "Balance must return to
 the Middle Kingdom."

 A: Try to persuade Lu Jin not to go.
 B: Support Lu Jin's choice.
 C: Good riddance.

>b
 while you work from inside the Order.

 You are sure you will meet each other again.

 As you return to the monastery, morale among the students is at an
 utter low. Not only did one of your number abandon the Order
 completely, but you have nothing to show for your efforts.

 Your first real mission on behalf of the Order is a failure.

 After you tell Abbot Bao and Master Shen about what has happened, they
 consult the heavens to determine the best course of action. Ultimately,
 the Order does nothing further?and despite your failure, attacks by the
 bandits near Kuei Xian die down for a time. Though this initially seems
 like good news, Governor Rong has heard about the events that
 transpired from his informants?likely village gossips, who may have
 heard it from the bandits themselves. No credit will be given to the
 Order of the Peach Tree for the temporary peace.

 Master Shen admits to you that he and the abbot had planned to test you
 to become a full member of the Order had your mission been a success.
 Now, you will have to prove yourself again through humble service and
 continued training before you can become a monk, rather than the senior
 student.

 Compared to your dishonor at the hands of the bandits, the wait to test
 is a small setback?but what if it means that you will not be the one
 chosen to consult the Dragon Sage? You will have to work even harder to
 prove that you are worthy before the dragon reappears in the Middle
 Kingdom.

 There are rumors upon rumors of what happens during the final test that
 separates students from monks. You have heard that it involves tracking
 and defeating a wild tiger. Some say that you must face and disperse a
 hungry ghost. Still others say that the true final test is a measure of
 the spirit and the ability of the student to achieve a perfect moment
 of inner peace.

 Given the scars you have seen on the fully accepted monks, if the test
 is about finding inner peace, inner peace leaves marks.

 Master Shen leads you to the inner temple of the monastery. He walks in
 a relaxed fashion, leaning on his staff, as though he is merely
 observing the growth of the peach tree, not leading you to where your
 fate will be decided.

 How are you feeling about this test?

 A: I am eager to begin. My training has prepared me well.
 B: I am nervous. I want to do well, but I fear failure.
 C: I am calm. This is a moment, and I exist within it.

>c
 its weight: the old master's strength, his wisdom, and his confidence
 in you all flow through that simple touch.

 He stops in front of the huge doors to the inner temple, carved with
 intricate scroll work and the shapes of the five animals: dragon,
 tiger, snake, crane, and leopard. After a short moment of waiting, he
 gestures with his staff for you to push the doors open. As you do, he
 falls into step next to you and you enter the chamber. The inner temple
 is humble: a small chamber with candles lining three of the four walls.
 Above the candles are paintings and sculptures of the spiritual animals
 of kung fu and the immortals. On the far wall, on a raised shelf above
 the flame, is a Buddha statue, one hand resting in his lap, the other
 raised in blessing.

 Abbot Bao stands in front of the last candle, lighting it from his own
 small candle. Once the room is lit, he blows his candle out.

 "Liu Meili, you have been deemed worthy of the final test to join the
 Order of the Peach Tree," says the abbot as he turns to you. "Do you
 accept this honor, ready to face the challenges before you and take on
 the role of monk?"

 A: "I accept."
 B: "I do not feel ready."

>a
 shallower, as befitting a teacher to a student.

 "There are three challenges in the test to become a member of the
 Order," Abbot Bao explains. "You must complete two of the three
 successfully. Consider your options wisely, as only one failure can be
 forgiven."

 "Part of the test is identifying your weaknesses and being honest about
 your strengths," Master Shen says quietly. "Know yourself, student, and
 you will triumph."

 "The three challenges are these," Abbot Bao continues. "The first is
 the Dashanmen, a challenge of your combat skills against the monks of
 the Order. You will enter a dark chamber, and you must cross from one
 side to the other while being attacked."

 Master Shen chuckles. "In the old days, we fought to the death. Too
 messy. Now we stop attacking as soon as you are unconscious."

 This commentary does not serve to give you confidence.

 "For the second challenge, you must carry an urn filled with hot coals
 from the monastery down to the river. There, you may release the urn
 and bathe your arms in the cold water."

 The distance from the monastery to the river is short enough when not
 carrying an urn, but it will certainly feel longer with burning metal
 on your arms. That certainly explains some of the scars you have seen
 on the monks of the Order!

 "For the third challenge, you must retrieve the Scroll of Destiny from
 behind Bingdian Waterfall, and learn the lesson it holds," Abbot Bao
 finishes.

 "Don't worry," says Master Shen, "it is stored in a waterproof scroll
 case. You'll be able to read it."

 Which task would you like to undertake first?

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will carry the urn of coals.
 C: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 been cleared of students, and only a handful of monks are here to
 witness the beginning of your challenge. Just inside the gates, a
 brazier is lit, and over it is suspended a large urn, full of burning
 coals. Aligned to the cardinal directions are four animals: to the
 north is the tortoise; south, the phoenix; east, the dragon; and west,
 the tiger.

 While the metalwork is beautiful, it mostly looks hot.

 You must carry the urn with your forearms from the monastery to the
 river below. How will you face this challenge?

 A: I grit my teeth and carry the heavy load through sheer will.
 B: I will not rely on strength alone, but will use the heat to further
 forge my chi.

>b
 fire, opposed by the tortoise, a creature of water. The dragon, which
 represents the element of wood, is opposed by the tiger, which
 represents metal. Although you are tempted to focus on the idea that
 the fire has the potential to consume wood and metal, but is opposed by
 water and only lends strength back to its own element, you know that
 there is still a fifth element to consider.

 There is void, the element of the center. Your own mind must be empty
 in order for the chi to flow through you, carrying the strength?and
 freedom?necessary to lift the urn. You still your mind, breathe, and
 reach for the urn.

 You feel the pain along your forearms, and it is excruciating?but it
 washes over you, just a part of the moment. With each breath, you let
 the moment flow and change, accepting it without worrying over past or
 future, or even holding a thought. Your feet know this path; they have
 walked it hundreds of times on the simple task of fetching water. You
 allow them to carry you.

 You breathe. You exist. The moment comes and passes, and another
 follows on its heels.

 You reach the river almost before you realize you are there, and you
 calmly lower the urn into the water. It hisses with steam, bathing you
 in hot air as your arms enter the cold stream. You realize that your
 body feels the shock of the contrast, but you only observe this as
 another part of the moment before letting it, too, go. When you return
 to the monastery, you show the monks your new scars to prove that you
 have withstood the challenge. You have passed. What scars do you bear?

 A: The dragon and the tiger.
 B: The tortoise and the phoenix.

>a

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 where the dry land becomes marsh, Bingdian Waterfall is on the far side
 of the karst mountain. The trip there is not a long one, but it is
 hard, as there is no path. As you begin your ascent, you find some goat
 paths to travel, delaying the true climb until the waterfall is in
 sight.

 You feel the mist of the waterfall before you see it. Despite the warm
 weather, the air takes on a clammy chill?the water here is always
 freezing, nearly ice cold. You rub your hands together and approach the
 waterfall. It cascades down the side of the mountain into a pool of
 unknown depth. It falls from perhaps ten times your own height, and
 somewhere in that length there is a cave or a hole behind it, in which
 lies the Scroll of Destiny.

 How will you attempt to find the scroll?

 A: Climb the mountain next to the waterfall until I see it.
 B: Use my chi to propel me up the side of the mountain, like a lizard.
 C: Make observations from below to calculate the most likely location
 for the scroll.
 D: Fashion an impromptu spear from the available wood and throw it
 until it hits an indentation.

>b
 on your climb. From there, you are able to scramble up the side of the
 mountain by keeping your energy focused, and by borrowing some of the
 grounded nature of the mountain you climb. You can sense from the
 energy of the mountain where the indentation that stores the scroll
 will be, and you dart your hand into the cold water, drawing the scroll
 case out as quickly as if you were pulling a fish from a stream. You
 turn and jump, using your chi to float to the ground. You sit down next
 to the pool, the roar of the waterfall drowning out any other noise,
 and open the scroll case. Inside is what feels like an ancient scroll,
 marked with diagrams that show various techniques you have learned
 while studying at the Order of the Peach Tree. But though there are
 many images to contemplate, most of the scroll is empty. There do not
 seem to be any great secrets contained in the writing here. You do not
 see a hidden final technique explained, nor a clue about how to bring
 balance to the Middle Kingdom.

 What do you wish to do?

 A: Meditate on the scroll. An answer will come.
 B: Analyze the scroll and puzzle out its meaning.

>B
 detail, identifying the moves. You begin to get stiff from your
 proximity to the cold waterfall, so you get up to stretch, going
 through the movements on the page as they are written. You pause from
 one technique to the next, studying the diagram and noticing how small
 details have changed from when the scroll was written to when your
 teachers shared these techniques. You realize that the closer you get
 to the blank part of the scroll, the closer the techniques are?in their
 details?to what you have learned.

 Excited by this discovery, you sit down next to the scroll again. You
 realize that, though the change is only barely discernible, the ink is
 ever so slightly darker toward the blank section. It occurs to you that
 the final technique shown on the scroll is one you have heard a story
 about: one of your teachers, a snake master, changed the way the
 technique was taught to the students in order to give them a lesson on
 pressure points. The strikes he added to the technique are clearly
 marked.

 There are no secrets on the scroll, but there is a legacy of detail.
 You consider the techniques you have adjusted in your own studies. What
 will you teach to future students in the Order? How will your art be
 applied to wushu as you make it your own?

 You discover that the scroll case has a small compartment that contains
 a brush and a block of dry ink. You take out your bowl?something a monk
 must always carry, you have been told?and add water to the ink. In your
 finest calligraphy, you add a technique to the scroll, allowing it to
 dry before you return it to its secret location behind the waterfall.

 When you return to the monastery, Abbot Bao notices the ink smudges in
 your bowl and offers you a smile and a bow. You have passed this test.
 Which task will you undertake next?

 A: I am satisfied with my performance on my tasks and conclude the
 test.
 B: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.

>b
 the room. For an instant, you think the peach tree statue glows with
 reflected light, but then all is dark.

 Master Shen's hand tightens on your shoulder, escorting you to the far
 side of the chamber. You can hear the soft sounds of people entering
 the room, though with the quiet treads the monks have practiced, it is
 impossible to tell how many. Certainly more than the sounds you hear
 would indicate.

 Finally, Master Shen turns you around. "Remember your training," he
 says, before he, too disappears in the darkness.

 You wait, your stance relaxed as you have been taught, until you are
 told to begin?or until the first attack comes.

 How will you face this challenge?

 A: I have faith in my fighting skills. I face my opponents with
 confidence?they are as blind as I am.
 B: The challenge is to get from one side of the room to the other, but
 the path was never specified. I weave through the room, confusing my
 opponents.

>b
 complimented on your ability to think outside of the boundaries of the
 exercise. That skill is useful here. You begin by crouching low to the
 ground, and you feel where the strike of your first opponent would have
 been had you remained in place. You strike to a pressure point on the
 back of his leg, collapsing it under him, as you move away from the
 center of the room and through the crowd of opponents.

 The monks realize your strategy quickly, so you have to keep shifting
 your pattern of movement. The intention is to be where the strikes are
 not. You get into a low stance and circle walk. You move, changing
 directions and heights of your stance with syncopation so that your
 foes never catch you in a rhythm. You launch a flurry of palm strikes
 as you feel the body of a monk ahead of you. The next monk, however,
 you just evade, moving around him the moment that your earlier foe
 counterstrikes your former position.

 It is not easy, but you focus on the strategies you have learned for
 keeping your opponents off balance, leading them into each other and
 falling away from their attacks. Occasionally, a strike catches you,
 but your steps never falter, and you keep moving. You can feel that
 what you are doing borders on what some would call the supernatural
 talents of the monks; you know you are drawing on your own knowledge of
 strategy and the principles of bagua?the eight diagrams that represent
 the nature of the universe.

 You can sense how close you are coming to the far side of the room,
 where Abbot Bao awaits. You reach the wall, then circle back into the
 throng, gliding out of the way of the monks turning to attack you. You
 reach out and place your hand on the warm wood of the door.

 "Finish," says Abbot Bao. He makes a final attack?a high strike aimed
 at your throat?but you back against the door and push it open, shooting
 yourself backward out of his reach. Light floods the room, dazzling you
 and the monks. As your eyes adjust, you realize that they are all
 bowing to you. Clearly your teachers were correct: you were ready for
 this test, and you have passed. With your successes behind you, you are
 welcomed once again into the inner temple. The candles are all lit, and
 the monks who reside at the monastery offer you their oaths of
 brotherhood. The Order of the Peach Tree is now your family, and you
 are one step closer to getting to ask a question of the Dragon Sage.

 Your first few years as a monk feel little different from your last
 year as a senior student. Though you now have a greater leadership
 role, and an official ranking as a teacher with the students, much
 continues on as it had before. You work at the monastery, taking care
 of the things required of all who live there to maintain the daily
 workings of the Order. You spar with the monks and continue to learn
 the intricacies of wushu. You oversee the newest applicants as they
 prove their worth by accomplishing the most menial chores. You do not
 miss those days from your own apprenticeship.

 The seasons change. The peach tree blossoms and bears fruit, then shows
 its naked branches until spring returns. The strength of the Blue
 Scarves Rebellion grows as the foreigners maintain and further develop
 their presence in the Middle Kingdom. Still, the Emperor shows no
 intention of changing their role at his court, or defending the people
 of the Middle Kingdom against the foreigners' encroachment upon lands
 they have farmed for generations.

 No further threats call for the attention of the Order of the Peach
 Tree, however, and Abbot Bao has not become involved with the quarrel
 between the rebels and the Emperor on either side. The monks are
 divided in their opinions of the world's events: some strongly support
 the Emperor, others profess that it is not the Order's role to get
 involved in events of the world, and a few mention their concerns for
 the common people without ever fully defying the Son of Heaven.

 Do you involve yourself in these conversations?

 A: I support the Emperor. He is the Son of Heaven and clearly knows
 what's best for the Empire.
 B: I agree that the Middle Kingdom is out of balance with the Heavens,
 but do not openly question the Emperor.
 C: I am not concerned with such worldly matters when I strive toward
 Enlightenment.

>b
 position, but openly admitting doubt in the Son of Heaven is both
 unwise and dangerous. But if the choice is saying nothing or giving up
 your path to the Dragon Sage and joining the rebellion like Lu
 Jin?well, you know what you will choose.

 One day in late summer, the third year after your test, Master Shen
 asks to speak with you beneath the peach tree. When you arrive, the old
 master is dozing off beneath the tree, his staff leaning next to him.
 You approach quietly, but as soon as you are within range of Master
 Shen's staff, it shoots out to tap your ankle, suddenly in his gnarled
 but quick hand. His eyes remain closed.

 "This ankle feels like it belongs to Liu Meili," he says with a grin.
 He opens one eye. "Ah, good. If it had been Kai Lo bringing a late
 afternoon snack to the decrepit old man, that would have been an
 embarrassing mistake."

 Master Shen pats the ground beside him in a gesture for you to sit. It
 is oddly informal for one who served as your teacher for so long.

 "Why did you wish to speak with me, Master?" you ask.

 "Maybe I enjoy the company of my young students in my old age," Master
 Shen says gruffly. He taps your foot with the end of his staff. "You
 may be a monk now, but I still concern myself with your education."

 How do you respond to this?

 A: I am learning much from teaching the students and continuing to spar
 with the monks.
 B: I admit that I fear my own art is stagnating.
 C: I tell him that I miss the challenge of real combat.

>b
 to learn outside these walls, Liu Meili." Master Shen raises his staff
 and knocks twice on one of the peach tree's branches. Two peaches
 tumble down, and you catch them both, handing one to the old master
 when he reaches for it. He takes a bite of juicy peach, savoring it,
 before continuing.

 "It is traditional for members of the Order to spend some time away
 from the monastery after they become monks," he explains. "For some it
 is a time of wandering, living only on the kindness others drop into
 their begging bowls. For others, it is a chance to become embroiled in
 the matters of the Middle Kingdom. Abbot Bao suggested that for you,
 actually, and was planning to send you to Xiaonanhai, but I think that
 perhaps the capital is not the place for you now."

 You are surprised that Abbot Bao would think to send you to the capital
 of the Middle Kingdom?and that Master Shen has objected to the abbot's
 plans.

 "I think you would gain a greater benefit from studying under an old
 teacher of mine."

 "Of yours, Master?" you ask, trying to imagine a teacher of Master
 Shen's that would still be walking, let alone alive.

 He raps his staff against your ankle again, clearly guessing your
 thoughts. "I recommend that you seek out Master Zhuge in the Yellow
 Mountains. Zhuge is an old hermit?a true recluse?but crafty as a
 dragon."

 In fact, you have heard of Master Zhuge, whom some call the Veiled
 Dragon. Stories say that Master Zhuge has followed the path to
 immortality, though whether this was through alchemy, devout living, or
 the mystical arts of the bedchamber is the subject of much debate. No
 one knows how old he is or the full extent of his abilities, but people
 say he can blow on water to change the direction of its current, heal
 the sick at a distance, and take on the shape of any object. He also
 writes very fine poetry.

 "Zhuge lives in the mountains above Kuei Xian," Master Shen continues.
 He pulls a scroll out of his sengfu and hands it to you. It is a map of
 that section of the Yellow Mountains, incredibly detailed. A hermitage
 is marked.

 Master Shen stands, slowly, hiding the quick reactions you know he is
 capable of. "I suggest you take a present," he says, and knocks the
 bough of the peach tree with his staff again. A pile of peaches falls
 into your lap. "Go. Learn. I will see you in a few years, if I am still
 around. And if you survive."

 What gift will you take with you?

 A: Peaches. If Master Shen suggested them, they must be a good idea.
 B: I take a cutting from the peach tree, which will eventually produce
 its own peaches.
 C: I take the time to copy one of the scrolls from the temple library
 before I leave.

>b
 monk. You carefully take a cutting, wrapping the base in a wet cloth to
 prepare it for travel. Then you return to your room to pack your
 remaining things. You leave from the monastery on a beautiful, sunny
 day to begin your journey to the Yellow Mountains. It has been years
 since you traveled this road, and the journey alone is very different
 from one with seventeen companions. By the time you reach Baijiang
 Bridge, the weather has started to turn, and a summer squall hits just
 as you arrive in Kuei Xian. You sit in the tea house for a few hours
 until the skies clear, then begin your ascent into the mountains.

 You are hardly out of sight of town when you see a young woman on the
 road ahead of you, pacing and looking quite distraught. She is dressed
 in humble clothes, bedraggled from the recent storm, but despite the
 smudged dirt on her face and the disarray of her hair, it is clear that
 she is beautiful. A heavy pack lies near her by the side of the road.
 She spots you and the worry on her face eases.

 "Thank the heavens," she says, then looks down and bows in deference,
 despite the fact that she clearly intends to address you without
 waiting for you?of higher social rank?to speak first. "Honored monk,
 forgive my boldness, but I am in need of aid. I was traveling toward
 Kuei Xian when the storm hit, and my ox startled at the thunder and
 bolted off the road. Could you help me?"

 A: I don't have the time or inclination to help a peasant.
 B: I can spare a little time to help a poor woman.
 C: This woman seems very familiar?she reminds me of a certain fox
 spirit I met the last time I traveled this way.

>c

 The woman beams. "You remembered me!"

 As though you were likely to forget an encounter with a fox spirit.

 The huli jing gestures to her pack, letting her seven tails peek out
 from beneath the humble peasant clothing she wears as a disguise. "I
 thought perhaps you might like an additional option to present to
 Master Zhuge. No tricks, I promise." She gives you a wink, then bounds
 off into the woods, changing to her fox form as she goes. When you meet
 with Master Zhuge, will you offer the fox spirit's gift?

 A: I will present my original gift to Master Zhuge.
 B: I will present the fox spirit's pack to Master Zhuge.
 C: I will offer both gifts.

>c
 hut where Master Shen's map said it would be. You rap on the door,
 expecting it to open with hospitality, even at this late hour and even
 from a legendary hermit. What you do not expect is for a wizened and
 wiry old woman, white hair dangling in a long braid down her back, to
 open the door with distaste.

 "I am not interested in visitors," she snaps. "Fend for yourself in the
 mountains. Consult the stars. Maybe you'll learn something."

 A: Explain I am here from the Order of the Peach Tree to see Master
 Zhuge, relying on the Order's reputation to bring goodwill.
 B: Demand that this insolent old woman introduce me to Master Zhuge,
 whom I have traveled so far to see.
 C: Apologize for the late hour and ask for hospitality to be granted to
 a humble monk.
 D: Bow deeply. The way this woman moves, despite her age, reveals her
 skill. I address her: "Master Zhuge."

>go down
 legends you have learned about Zhuge the Immortal, the Veiled Dragon.
 But though all the stories you know refer to Zhuge as a man, you can
 sense the gravitas this woman has.

 The old woman beams. "It has been at least fifteen years since someone
 identified me so quickly," she says. "Either you are a remarkably
 clever monk, or I am getting less crafty in my old age." She holds the
 door open. "I choose to believe it is the former. Please, come inside."
 The hut is larger on the inside than it appeared on the outside, and
 though it is sparely furnished, it is comfortable. The main room has a
 small hearth; a kettle for tea water is currently suspended over it.
 One wall is filled with racks of scrolls. Another has weapons of all
 sizes and shapes suspended from it. Two paper doors hide additional
 rooms.

 Master Zhuge offers you tea.

 A: Accept the tea and drink it as Master Zhuge drinks it.
 B: Take the tea cup and contemplate the tea, considering its qualities.
 C: Decline the tea.

>a
 to Master Zhuge. She takes what you offer with little expression, and
 you cannot tell whether you have impressed the master or not. Master
 Zhuge asks about your travels and the training you have already had.
 She listens, revealing little with her expression, as you explain your
 background.

 "I have decided to accept you, provisionally, as my apprentice," Master
 Zhuge says. "I can teach you any number of things, if you are willing
 to learn them."

 What do you hope to learn from Master Zhuge?

 A: I want to improve my fighting.
 B: I want to learn the magic the Zhuge of legend is said to practice.
 C: I need to work on my determination.
 D: I am looking forward to studying strategy under the Veiled Dragon,
 who is said to have been responsible for the defeat of three armies at
 Hongcao Pass.
 E: I really want to learn the art of poetry.

>go east
 ever sought her out as a poetry instructor. Still, she is eager to find
 another person with whom she can share her love of poetry.

 But rather than putting your own words together, or even studying the
 words of the masters, Master Zhuge divides your day into two parts:
 practicing calligraphy and meditating in a clearing near the hut.
 Neither of these things feels much like poetry when you begin.

 A: I do not understand Master Zhuge's techniques and have taken to
 making up poems in my head without her.
 B: Clearly, the art of calligraphy is poetry's physical expression. The
 words must also appear beautiful.
 C: Sitting in nature is clearly about poetry. Poetry is about
 observation as much as it is about creation.

>c
 as you walk home together, she speaks to you in what you soon recognize
 as extemporaneous verse. As you reply, you find that your words, too,
 are becoming more poetic. One evening as you are practicing
 calligraphy, Master Zhuge returns to the hut from an errand, and you
 realize that she is carrying wine skins. You have never seen Master
 Zhuge drink alcohol?in fact, you have actually seen her ingest little
 other than tea and herbal compounds, which you have heard is one of the
 ways a person may become immortal?so this comes as a surprise.

 "Are we having company?" you ask.

 "Yes," Master Zhuge says, setting a third chair at the table where you
 drink tea together. "A friend of mine will be staying with us this
 evening, and I suspect he will want plenty to drink while he is here."
 She gestures to the several skins. "You may have some as well, of
 course."

 You are curious about her guest, but she says no more, vanishing into
 her room until, hours later, there is a knock on the door of her hut.
 She goes to the door, a far cry from the crotchety old woman who
 answered for you the first night you met her: she has piled her hair
 into an elaborate coif and she wears a beautifully brocaded qipao,
 looking every bit like a noble woman rather than a hermit.

 "Miao!" a man's voice booms when she opens the door, and it sounds
 clear to you that he has already had a bit to drink. "It has been far
 too long!"

 "Then you should visit more often, you old fool," Master Zhuge says,
 but her voice is playful, and she ushers her guest inside.

 He is a huge man who wears a long robe with wide sleeves, and a tunic
 draped on top of it. A waist-sash surrounds his enormous girth, and a
 scholar's cap crowns his head. He sees you and starts in surprise. "And
 who is this, Miao? A new student?"

 "Pai, this is Liu Meili, who is studying poetry with me. Liu Meili,
 allow me to present Li Pai."

 The large man bellows a laugh. "A poet! I hope Miao has actually let
 you write something down, young pupil. She is notorious for keeping
 everything in her head."

 A: I bow politely to Master Zhuge's guest.
 B: I laugh and admit that I have not yet written any poetry down while
 studying under Master Zhuge, but insist that she is a fine teacher.
 C: I am intimidated by this man and scared stiff at the notion of
 discussing poetry with him.
 D: I bow deeply to the poet. I recognize his name from the legends; he,
 like Master Zhuge, is considered an immortal.

>b
 not the only one, Pai." "Let us speak of poetry! But first, Miao, tell
 me that you have brought me wine."

 "Of course," says Master Zhuge, handing her guest the first of, you
 suspect, many wine skins to be drunk that night.

 Li Pai begins to launch into his own poetry, and Master Zhuge responds
 with her own, some that you recognize from the work of hers that you
 have already heard and read, and some that sounds extemporaneous, but
 no less sophisticated. After you have listened to the exchanges for
 some time, it is clear that, in order to participate in this evening,
 you will need to contribute some poetry of your own.

 A: I am happy just to be in the presence of two such gifted poets. I
 will let it all sink in.
 B: I am confident that I will be able to create extemporaneous poetry.
 C: I am uncertain about creating my own poetry, but I rely on my memory
 of older poems to add to the conversation.

>b
 clearing to call up appropriate imagery to reflect the emotional tone
 of the conversation. And as the poets accept your contributions, your
 confidence grows. Soon, you are spouting poetry as though you have been
 doing it all your life.

 Many wine skins later and far after the moon has set, Master Zhuge
 announces that it is time for the evening to come to an end. Your two
 fellow poets wish you a good night, and you dream in verse.

 Li Pai stays for several more days before returning to the road, and
 you bask in the poetry of the household. You continue your practice of
 calligraphy and meditation while the poet is at the house?he sleeps the
 majority of the day and does not miss your presence?and spend the
 evenings engaging with the two masters of the art, honing your skill.
 When Li Pai eventually has to leave, he encourages you to write down
 some of your poems, despite Master Zhuge's training.

 To your surprise, Master Zhuge agrees. "I think it is time that you
 commit some works to paper," she says after her friend has gone. "But I
 think we can find some time for things other than poetry as well, my
 student, if there are other things you wish to learn."

 A: I want to improve my fighting.
 B: I want to learn the magic the Zhuge of legend is said to practice.
 C: I need to work on my determination.
 D: I am looking forward to studying strategy under the Veiled Dragon,
 who is said to have been responsible for the defeat of three armies at
 Hongcao Pass.

>go down
 stories as a child, and you have studied the different tellings of that
 event at every opportunity. Master Zhuge was on the side of Hong Wei,
 the most capable general among the three armies, who fought on behalf
 of the Imperial Family against a rebelling warlord and the horse-riding
 savages of the western plains. Between General Hong and Master Zhuge,
 the battle was decisive, and Hongcao Pass was named after the general,
 who became a trusted advisor to the Emperor.

 The story that Master Zhuge tells you surprises you: Zhuge knew that in
 order for the general's strategy to work, the army would need to double
 the number of drummers sending out the orders to the soldiers. In order
 to meet the army's need, Zhuge recruited a number of young women
 instrumentalists from a nearby village. Though General Hong was unsure
 about using untried women in the role, they were vital to his ruse: he
 needed the drum calls to disorient his enemies and keep the opposing
 armies from learning his location until it was too late for them to
 prevent his attack. Zhuge snuck the women up into the pass into secure
 locations, where their drum calls would echo and multiply, thus adding
 further confusion to General Hong's original plan. Many other details
 played into the battle, of course?including an east wind Master Zhuge
 summoned, which caused the banners of the horse barbarians to flutter
 chaotically in the winding pass and further disorient the enemy?but
 history's record of the numbers is entirely accurate.

 As you discuss old battles, day after day, Master Zhuge insists that
 you play go. The board game, played on a grid where stones of opposing
 colors?black and white?are used to attempt to surround their opponent's
 pieces, distracts you from the tales of Master Zhuge's important
 strategic decisions.

 Do you question her technique?

 A: The distraction is unwelcome. I would rather pore over maps of
 Master Zhuge's campaigns.
 B: The multitasking is difficult, but I suspect it is part of the
 exercise.
 C: I love go! I could play this game all day.

>b
 retaining both in your head without being distracted, is certainly a
 skill that requires a quick mind. It also has the added benefit of
 causing you to focus more closely on Master Zhuge's reactions and
 expressions. You feel you are beginning to learn how to read her
 emotions more clearly, and your insight into her expressions aids both
 your game and your understanding of her campaign decisions. One
 evening, during which you are comparing two accounts of the campaign
 during the Border War fought between Emperor Da Xiaoten?the grandfather
 of current Emperor Da Gaozu, the Son of Heaven?and the barbarians of
 the western plains, Master Zhuge sets up the go board, as has become
 your custom. This time, however, she sets three chairs around the
 table.

 "Are we having company?" you ask.

 "In a manner of speaking," Master Zhuge says in her typical cryptic
 fashion.

 After arranging the board, Master Zhuge disappears into her room, then
 returns with a silk bag and heads outside. You follow, curious, and
 watch as she withdraws a bundle of small flags and arranges them in a
 circle. She begins to chant in a language that is only vaguely
 familiar?it sounds like a very old dialect of your own language, with a
 very different vocabulary?and, after a few moments, the ghost appears.
 At first he is only a shade, but as Master Zhuge's chanting continues,
 he resolves into a tall man wearing scale armor over a changshan. A red
 cloak is draped over his armor, and his helmet is decorated with an
 equally red feather plume. A well-shaped beard and mustache, flecked
 with gray, surround a mouth that breaks into a smile when he sees your
 master.

 "Zhuge Miao," he says, sounding like an echo of a once-booming voice.
 "Has it been long, my friend?"

 "Ages," Master Zhuge confirms, taking the ghost's hands in her own. "I
 have a go player to introduce you to while I tell you stories of the
 future."

 The man looks at you sharply.

 A: I bow, in deference to this old friend of my master's.
 B: I bow, but only slightly. Surely I have greater status than a ghost!
 C: I remain frozen in place, unsure how to greet a ghost.
 D: I bow, recognizing General Hong Wei from his description in the
 legends.

>go down
 bow. "I see you have recognized my old friend," Master Zhuge says
 warmly. "Wei, this is Liu Meili, my student. Liu Meili, I present to
 you General Hong Wei." "It is an honor," you say, and your admiration,
 honed by years of studying his feats in combat, is clear. The ghost
 laughs. "We will see what you say after I have defeated you at go!"

 Inside, Master Zhuge offers the ghost her usual seat. She begins to
 busy herself around the hut in a way that strikes you as more domestic
 than her typical fashion.

 "You may go first," says General Hong.

 What is your strategy?

 A: I play in silence, focused solely on the game, even though this will
 be construed as rudeness.
 B: I have been training with Master Zhuge to converse and play at the
 same time. I can handle the challenge.
 C: I study General Hong's expressions, trying to draw him into
 storytelling and conversation that will distract him from the game.

>c
 who?for the purposes of the evening at least?outranks you, to draw you
 into conversation. Once he begins to talk, you are free to ask
 questions. While you might be inclined to keep him engaged on topics
 from his own life, it is clear from the way he reacts to your questions
 and to comments from Master Zhuge that he is far more interested in
 current events. General Hong is dismayed by the foreign presence in the
 Middle Kingdom?after all, he spent years trying to keep out the
 horse-riding barbarians?but he is scrupulously polite regarding the
 Imperial Family. You tell him of your own campaign?small though it
 was?at Kuei Xian and ask what he would have done.

 The puzzle of the bandits?and what he would do to confront both them
 and the foreigners were he the current Imperial General?captivates him
 utterly. So utterly that he does not notice your command of the board,
 or how quickly you are surrounding his pieces. When he eventually
 realizes what has happened, he laughs.

 "Miao, your student has distracted me!" he complains good-naturedly.

 "Didn't you always tell me that distractions are an inevitable part of
 battle?" she asks, mischief clear in her voice.

 "So I did," he answers, finishing the game to his inevitable defeat.
 General Hong remains for conversation after the game, but eventually,
 Master Zhuge returns him to the celestial realms. It is clear that none
 of you really wanted the evening to end.

 When Master Zhuge returns with her silk bag, she looks at you, clearly
 pleased.

 "I believe we can have company more often," she says. "I also believe
 that you are ready for lessons on an additional topic. What else would
 you like to learn?"

 A: I want to improve my fighting.
 B: I want to learn the magic the Zhuge of legend is said to practice.
 C: I need to work on my determination.

>b
 would call magic. Master Zhuge explains that it is all a matter of
 understanding the flow of energy through the universe. When she says
 it, of course, it sounds simple. But your new training regimen is
 anything but. You find that magic is much less about action and much
 more about scholarship. Master Zhuge has you studying star charts,
 herbal encyclopedias, and books on anatomy. You imagine you can feel
 your muscles atrophy as you do nothing but read.

 Are you frustrated by all this book learning?

 A: I am fascinated by everything I am learning, and am eager to learn
 more.
 B: I love what I am learning, but wake before dawn in order to have
 time to go through my forms, so that my body remembers its fighting
 arts.
 C: I am sick of books and wish I were doing something with more action.

>b
 rather than get out another text on anatomy, she teaches you a form
 from the art of qigong, a style that emphasizes the energy points
 within the body, both for disabling foes and for healing friends. You
 add this to your morning practice. One day, Master Zhuge draws you away
 from the texts she has assigned you to study and takes you on a walk
 through the woods. Though you have been to the stream near her hut
 before, you have never noticed the gazebo to which she takes you. It is
 a rainy day, and the sound of the raindrops falling on the water adds
 volume to the stream's babble and the rustling of wind through the
 trees.

 "Today, we spar," she announces.

 She moves to the gazebo and sits on one of the benches inside. A figure
 comes out of the woods?a beautiful woman dressed in a thick brocaded
 qipao, who carries an erhu.

 After a moment, you recognize the woman as Feng, the huli jing. She
 draws her bow and sits demurely on the ground at the door of the
 gazebo, where she begins to play a haunting melody.

 A: I stand in a fighting stance, prepared to spar as Master Zhuge said.
 B: I sit in the gazebo and await further instruction.
 C: I sit in the gazebo and look at Master Zhuge until she meets my
 eyes.

>c
 you to a mind-to-mind battle. She locks eyes with you, and you begin.
 You see the scene clearly, everything moving in slow motion, from the
 rain hitting the water of the stream to the strings of the erhu
 vibrating. In your mind, Zhuge stands, her giant bladed spear?her guan
 dao?in her hand, lowered at you.

 A: In my mind, I also rise, focusing on the pressure points I have
 learned from the anatomy texts, and strike out open-handed.
 B: I visualize the battle the way I wish it to go, shaping the reality
 of the vision with my will.

>a
 Master Zhuge approaches you, you step to the side and strike out,
 targeting thirteen different points on her head and neck, determined to
 hit every one of them in a quick series of strikes.

 Your blows begin to land, but Master Zhuge, too, is a master of snake
 forms. Her guan dao vanishes and she meets you snake for snake. You
 shift to crane stance, evading her strikes and flying out of the way.

 The erhu plays, and your battle becomes a dance. You become so engaged
 in the patterns and movement that you cease to care who will win,
 living in this moment and letting go of worries of the future. You
 strike out, dance back, strike again, parry and counter. And still the
 erhu plays, and the rain glides across the surface of the stream.

 Master Zhuge spins away, grants you a broad smile, and bows. You return
 the bow, and discover that you are both still seated in the gazebo. The
 erhu vibrates with the last note of the song. "Well done," says Master
 Zhuge.

 After you have studied with Zhuge Miao for two years, your teacher once
 again asks you to sit with her for tea. "I have decided to go away for
 a time," she announces. "I have been in touch with Master Shen at the
 Order of the Peach Tree, and I understand that you are to remain in the
 Kuei Xian region. I would offer you my humble home," she says with a
 gesture around the room, "but I am afraid it is not quite the same when
 I am not here."

 You have noticed strange properties of the building?the way it seems to
 hold more than it should, that furniture seems to move out of Master
 Zhuge's way, that the windows darken against the sun or brighten on
 cloudy days?and are unsurprised that it, like Master Zhuge, is more
 than natural.

 "I have arranged for you to have a small house on the edge of Kuei
 Xian," she continues. "It should have enough space for you to continue
 your training, as well as live in comfort. My friend Feng will see to
 it that you have everything that you need." She sees your expression of
 surprise and continues with a smile. "Feng is a huli jing?a fox
 spirit?but she has been my trusted companion for many years. She will
 not take you down the foxhole unless you either wish it or become very,
 very foolish."

 Clearly Master Zhuge is unaware of your previous interactions with the
 fox spirit?which, you suppose, is just as well.

 Master Zhuge puts her tea cup down, looking older than she has in the
 whole time you have known her. "My student," she says, "the truth is
 that even I will not live forever. You have learned much from me?as
 much as any single one of all the students I have taught in my years as
 a master?and I have decided to make you my heir. If you accept, you
 shall be considered a member of the Zhuge family, and the heir to the
 Zhuge style of kung fu. Will you accept this responsibility?"

 A: Yes, of course! It is a great honor.
 B: I do not want that responsibility. I must decline.

>a
 have taught you wisely, and perhaps, one day, we will meet again." It
 seems that your time of study under Master Zhuge has come to an end,
 but that your years away from the Order continue.

 The move from Master Zhuge's hermitage up the mountain to the house on
 the outskirts of Kuei Xian goes smoothly, especially with Feng's help.
 The fox spirit has a knack for making heavy objects?like the racks of
 weapons that Master Zhuge has entrusted to you, or the trunks of
 scrolls from Master Zhuge's library?take up far less space than they
 ought to. Her willingness to put in her own hard labor is surprising,
 given the reputation of huli jing, but considering Master Zhuge's kind
 words about the fox spirit, you take her efforts at face value.

 For now.

 The house is far larger than the small cottage you expected, and more
 space than you have had to yourself since you first joined the Order of
 the Peach Tree. Built in the traditional courtyard design, it has a
 front wall with an entryway into a large open courtyard, decorated by a
 pair of cherry trees. The house is built in a U around the courtyard;
 opposite the wall is the main section of the house, with a kitchen, a
 study, a dining room, and a bedroom. The two sides, connected to the
 main section of the house by open-air hallways at the corners, are
 large, empty spaces with smooth bamboo flooring. A final L-shaped
 building, which doubles as the wall around two sides of the property,
 appears intended to house a staff of servants. Clearly, this property
 once belonged to someone wealthy enough to live in comfort, though the
 servants' building is in a state of disrepair.

 Feng does not take a room for herself, but she does seem to know when
 her help is required, and over the course of a few weeks, you discover
 that you always wake to the smell of a hot breakfast and a scented
 oolong tea. The side halls never seem to gather dust, despite the fact
 that you have little use for so much space. Feng herself rarely
 appears, leaving you to unpack Master Zhuge's weapons and scrolls?and
 continue your studies?in solitude.

 At the start of the fourth week, Feng makes herself present at
 breakfast, wearing a face and garb that give her the appearance of
 being the fair daughter of some well-to-do merchant or tea house owner.
 Despite her human form, her seven tails wave behind her back.

 "I know that Miao was a hermit, but I didn't expect you to follow her
 path that way," the fox spirit complains, almost petulantly. "If you're
 going to be here for a while, you ought to connect with members of the
 community, and invite them to visit before I become utterly bored."

 A bored fox spirit does not sound like a positive feature of your new
 home.

 A: I am content with solitude. I will hole up in the main section of
 the house and continue my training.
 B: The point of my wandering years is to experience more of the world.
 I will explore the social dynamics of Kuei Xian.
 C: This space is ideal for starting a school to teach others the skills
 I have learned.

>b
 interesting." She gives you a devilish grin. "Like romance."

 The fox spirit seats herself at the table and pours herself a cup of
 tea?the oolong scented with osmanthus flowers that she brews every
 morning. "There are really two scenarios here. One is that you allow me
 to help you shape your social and romantic life, with your consent. The
 other is that I shape it without your permission. I'm a fox spirit. I
 can't help myself. So, shall we do this the friendly way or the
 sure-to-create-chaos way?"

 A: I accept Feng's help. At least I will have partial control of the
 chaos.
 B: I can stand up to the chaos of a fox spirit. Let her do her worst.

>a

 Feng lets out a gleeful shriek, then hides her smile behind her teacup.

 "I've already done some research," she says. "But first I need to know
 about your taste. Give me your hand."

 As soon as your hand is enclosed in the fox spirit's nimble fingers,
 the room vanishes, and before your eyes parade images of handsome men
 and beautiful women in all styles of clothing. Though the shapes of
 their faces and forms vary, all of them are almost inhumanly
 attractive.

 Which do you find yourself most attracted to?

 A: The men.
 B: The women.
 C: Both men and women.
 D: None of them.

>c
 your own. Feng takes a slow sip from her teacup, hiding her expression,
 then sets it down on the table.

 "You may not have noticed the time passing," she says, "but we are
 nearing Qi Xi?the seventh day of the seventh month?and Kuei Xian is
 having a festival in honor of the holiday in a week's time. There will
 be food, dancing, fireworks, and plenty of traveling merchants creating
 a huge marketplace in our normally humble village. It is a perfect time
 to begin a romance. I will make sure that eligible candidates happen to
 run into you at the festival. I've also heard that your former rival,
 Lu Jin, may be visiting Kuei Xian soon, if you'd be interested
 in?reconnecting." Her delivery of the last word is heavily weighted
 with innuendo.

 The Qi Xi festival is always one of the most cheerful festivals?and
 Feng is right, it is a time that is ripe for romance. There is an old
 legend about a cowhand who fell in love with a celestial maiden?and she
 returned his love. But the gods frowned on the romance and separated
 the lovers; when they realized how deeply the two felt for each other,
 however, they granted them one day a year, the seventh day of the
 seventh month, that they could be together.

 Legends aside, how do you feel about Feng's plan?

 A: Feng is right, it is the perfect time to begin a romance. I accept
 her guidance in meeting people at the festival.
 B: I will attend the festival to meet the town leaders.
 C: I will attend the festival in order to recruit students for my
 school.
 D: I am interested in romance, but I confess to Feng that I am already
 interested in someone.

>go down
 would have noticed your having any romantic interest by now, monk," she
 says. "Tell me, who is the lucky person?"

 A: I admit my longing for my former rival, Lu Jin.
 B: I confess my interest in Feng herself.

>b

 "How unexpected," she says, almost to herself. "I admit I find you
 intriguing?certainly more so than other monks that I have met?but I did
 not think a monk would return those feelings." She turns away, as
 though she is unable to meet your eyes. "I want us to be clear. I have
 promised Miao that I will not take you down the foxhole unless you ask
 it, but I promised nothing about the possibility of warming your bed.
 Is that what you wish?"

 A: Yes. I cannot deny my attraction to the fox spirit.
 B: I did not actually believe she would accept my advance. Faced with
 the reality of being a fox spirit's lover, I find I cannot actually
 accept.

>A
 promise of great pleasure?and, you hope, something more. You move to
 kneel next to her, then reach out to cup her face in your hand before
 you draw her into a deep kiss. She returns it with ardor, and soon,
 breakfast and your conversation have been forgotten.

 But hours later, after you have explored each other thoroughly and are
 lying in the bed she promised to warm, she looks at you, draping her
 long hair, now worn loose, across your chest. "I certainly won't
 suggest that you use the festival to find a bedmate," she says
 cheerfully, "but it remains an opportunity to get involved with Kuei
 Xian, or recruit students to teach here if that's what you really want.
 There will be food, and dancing. I think we should attend."

 A: I am unconcerned with worldly issues, but am intrigued by the
 festival, and would like to amuse Feng.
 B: I am unconcerned with worldly issues and would rather not attend the
 festival.
 C: I feel I should get involved with the community, and attending the
 festival is a good way to do so.

>a
 coming to know the fox spirit, it remains hard to tell when some
 expressions are feigned?but this one strikes you as true.

 The evening of the festival arrives. Feng takes your arm and
 accompanies you into Kuei Xian. The center of the village has been
 transformed into an outdoor banquet hall: it looks as though everyone
 in the village has contributed something. Clearly Governor Rong and his
 family have contributed more than most, a fact the governor is not shy
 about making known, based on the way he appears to be holding court.

 Paper lanterns have been strung up from the doors of all the nearby
 homes and businesses, and musicians perform in the streets. Already,
 some of the younger villagers have begun dancing.

 How do you wish to spend your evening?

 A: I want to spend time with Feng.
 B: I wander through the festival until I am ready to return home.

>b
 many joyous people. It is also tiring. Though the food is excellent and
 the dancing is scheduled to go on until dawn, you find yourself ready
 to return home to the quiet of your courtyard and the comfort of your
 bed.

 A week goes by before you begin to receive visitors. One bright
 morning, a young man arrives at your door. When you meet him at the
 gate, he bows.

 "Honored Master Zhuge, I seek to become your student."

 You have already given some thought about how you will greet
 prospective students. At the Order of the Peach Tree, student spend
 years doing menial labor before they are granted permission to learn
 forms and techniques. In other places, students are left to wait
 outside without food or drink, and only those who survive several days
 without giving up?or fainting?are allowed to be taught.

 How do you greet your first prospective student?

 A: I make him wait?but only a few hours. Then I set him to work doing
 chores.
 B: I welcome him immediately, ushering him inside and discussing what
 he hopes to learn.
 C: Although it could mean fewer students, I want only the most
 tenacious. I tell him to come back tomorrow and get to work repairing
 the servants' building.
 D: I only want the brightest students. I ask them an impossible riddle.

>go down
 thinking skills but a familiarity with literature and philosophy. The
 prospective student sits to consider it, then leaves.

 But he returns the next day, with a friend.

 A week and a handful of additional minds later, the first student
 approaches you with an answer, without sharing it with his peers. It is
 correct, and you let him inside the gate.

 "Why didn't you share the answer?" you ask.

 "How will they learn if they don't figure it out on their own?" he asks
 in return.

 It takes time for others to solve the riddle, and many give up. But
 soon you have a group of very clever students who are eager to learn.

 Having the cleverest students also serves to keep you on your toes, and
 you have to work to stay one step ahead of them. They drive you to be
 your best in order to teach them to be theirs.

 What do you teach at your school?

 A: Physical combat.
 B: Magic.
 C: Both physical combat and magic.

>c
 skills are not as balanced as you would like. The students recognize
 your weaknesses, and though they do not say anything, it is clear that
 they doubt your teaching style.

 They do begin to learn, however, and you feel that you have a good
 group of students, with several years of training to look forward to.

 After your first year in Kuei Xian, your school has recruited 10
 students. Though you know you are waiting to be recalled to the Order
 of the Peach Tree, you feel you have made a good start settling into
 your wandering years, and that you are doing your teachers proud.

 One evening in late spring, the bloom of cherry blossoms perfuming the
 air, you watch a pair of your students sparring and you are reminded of
 your days as a young student at the Order of the Peach Tree. It seems
 now many years ago?and, in fact, it has been many years since you were
 last there. Eight years have passed since your training under Master
 Zhuge ended, but still, the Order has not sent for you to return. You
 have kept busy and, in fact, prosperous. Though several of your
 earliest students have left to pursue other training?or have gone on
 their own years of wandering?others have joined your school to take
 their places.

 Despite your lack of connections to either the ranking families of the
 Middle Kingdom or the Blue Scarves Rebellion, you have managed to
 attract a number of students who have the core desire of learning the
 martial arts from a master. Given your years of study, you certainly
 have much to teach!

 But on a day like today, as your students bow to each other, and then
 to you, your mind is less on their critique than it is on your future.
 The years between now and the appearance of the Dragon Sage are
 shrinking?but in the meantime, you have built a satisfying life for
 yourself. What are your thoughts about the future?

 A: I am surprisingly content with this life and question my earlier
 ambitions.
 B: I am concerned that it has taken so long for the Order to remember
 me.
 C: I continue to strive toward becoming the one monk worthy enough to
 consult the Dragon Sage.

>a
 taken so long for the Order of the Peach Tree to remember that they can
 one day call you back to the monastery. When that day comes, you will
 face a hard choice of which part of your life to leave behind.

 After dismissing your students, you prepare to retire for the evening,
 letting the smell of the cherry blossoms wash over you. As you enter
 the part of the house that remains your private chambers, you settle
 into the routine of your own training. How have you been focusing your
 studies?

 A: I study the texts of ancient masters, applying old traditions to the
 new techniques I am working to develop.
 B: I focus on my physical efforts and on my teaching, particularly in
 sparring with my senior students and teaching my lowest level students
 their basics.
 C: I take trips into the mountains in order to challenge myself as a
 survivor in the wilds.
 D: I seek out other teachers of renown, inviting them to lecture at my
 school.

>c
 you a greater opponent to overcome. While some monks journey into the
 wilderness in order to learn from the world around them and gain
 insight into the universe, your focus is on competition, on challenging
 yourself to overcome rather than to understand. You have heard the old
 saying that reeds bend in a great wind, while a mighty tree may break,
 but you have always found your stubbornness an asset when you face a
 foe. Each night when you are on your own time, you make plans for your
 next trip as a way to express your training.

 The prosperity of your school has given you additional opportunities
 for real training: your reputation has made you the inevitable target
 of challengers, seeking to prove that their style of wushu is superior
 to your own. Some challenges are for sport, with representatives of two
 schools facing off against each other in a friendly bout, usually with
 a determined point system decided on by you and another master. Some
 are a little more brutal than others, with the fight going to first
 blood, a knockout, or a surrender. What is your opinion of these sport
 competitions?

 A: My school must prove itself to be the best, and we will always meet
 a challenge to defend our honor.
 B: I am always eager to test my skills?and to have my students test
 their skills?against real challengers.
 C: I look forward to learning from others.

>c
 masters, simply by observing what they have taught their students. You
 have a knack for learning about people by how they express themselves
 while fighting, and the more challenges you encounter, the faster your
 assessments become.

 Other challenges are more personal: they specifically challenge you and
 your skills in a one-on-one challenge. An implication comes with these
 challenges: if you cannot defend yourself against the challenger, you
 are not worthy of being an instructor, and the style that you have
 taught your students is weak. You have faced very few of these
 challenges, in part because your reputation is strong enough to make
 others wary of approaching you in battle. The fact that you have easily
 dispatched the three challengers who questioned your honor in this way
 has also kept others from making the same mistake.

 As you conclude your evening training, Feng enters your room, wearing
 the guise of a female house servant and carrying a scroll. "A messenger
 arrived for you this afternoon," she says demurely, her humble body
 language reflecting her current role. She holds out the scroll to you.

 You are unsurprised to see that it is a challenge letter, but you are
 shocked to see that it has been signed by Sun An. A youxia?a wandering
 hero?of great skill, Sun An has the reputation for being a generous
 hero, but also a bit of a hothead. According to the stories, he has
 defended villages plagued by bandits and fought off scores of dangerous
 monsters in an effort to keep the common people safe. But he also seems
 to spend an inordinate amount of time making challenges to schools of
 wushu. Some claim he is a wandering immortal, who seeks to make sure
 that other martial artists deserve their reputations. Others say that
 while he is undeniably a great warrior, his conquests are more
 pride-driven than completed out of any sense of restoring balance.

 The text of the letter is quite short: Sun An writes, using every
 courtesy of language, that your reputation as a teacher has encouraged
 him to seek you out and test your skills. He intends to meet you in
 single combat to give you the opportunity to prove your worth, and he
 is prepared to sign a waiver of death?an official government document
 that removes any legal repercussions should a challenge match end in
 death?if that is the style of match you desire.

 Sun An is staying at the Plum Blossom tea house, where he eagerly
 awaits your reply.

 How do you respond?

 A: Bah! He will fall like all my other challengers have fallen.
 B: I reply, inviting Sun An to the school to discuss our match and
 extend my generosity to a fellow warrior.

>b
 not to respond in kind.

 In the morning, bright and early as per your invitation, Sun An arrives
 at the gate. Watching his approach from one of the windows in the
 servants' building, you see that he is a tall, wiry man, his whiplike
 body made of corded muscle. A long scar stretches from his left eyebrow
 to his chin, which gives the warrior a menacing appearance. He wears a
 loose tangzhuang?lightweight pants and a jacket designed for ease of
 movement?and across his back, a pair of shuang dao, identical
 single-edged sabers. He walks with confidence and wears a perpetually
 unimpressed expression on his face.

 How do you greet him?

 A: Like any who approach my school, he must wait patiently until I
 decide to answer the door.
 B: I send students to greet Sun An at the door and have him brought
 through the school to my dining room, where I will receive him.
 C: I meet Sun An at the gate myself, to greet him as an equal.

>c
 another teacher, or a fellow member of the Order of the Peach Tree. He
 bows in return.

 "Welcome to my school," you say. "I am glad you could make the time to
 meet with me to discuss the terms of your challenge."

 "Thank you for your hospitality," he returns, falling into step with
 you as you begin to cross the courtyard to the main building. "I have
 heard much about you as both an instructor and a warrior. I am eager to
 see if you live up to your reputation."

 As you pass the cherry trees, you see two of your lower level students
 discussing a move in one of their forms. They are debating on a
 particular strike that follows a 180 degree turn in the sequence, and
 it is unlikely that they will resolve the issue on their own, as both
 are arguing the case for an incorrect strike. Do you stop to help them?

 A: It would be rude to leave my guest. I remember the students to
 discuss it with them later.
 B: Any of my senior student can resolve this debate. I will leave it to
 them.
 C: I stop briefly to tell them the proper strike and let them get on
 with their practice.
 D: I stop to talk to my students, giving them the proper instruction
 and moving through the form with them to make sure they have it.

>go down
 students stop their conversation as you approach, and they quickly fall
 into rank behind you, starting the form at the beginning. As you move
 through the form with your students, all three of you moving in synch,
 you see that Sun An is watching you raptly.

 The form concludes, and you turn to your students to make sure they
 have no further questions. Both bow to you, looking slightly
 embarrassed to have been caught uncertain of their work, but grateful
 that you stopped to go over it with them. You return their bows with a
 shallow one of your own, then walk to join Sun An, who is still
 standing in the center of the courtyard.

 "Thank you for waiting," you say.

 "I enjoyed the chance to watch you work," Sun An says, returning your
 bow. He grins at you, and you are not entirely certain whether it is
 intended as friendly or fierce. "It gives me an advantage for our
 coming battle."

 How do you respond?

 A: I laugh it off. Watching me teach a low level form is not likely to
 give him insight into my higher level skills.
 B: I tell him he is welcome to the advantage. I would not wish for him
 to enter our competition unprepared.
 C: I suggest that, as an honorable man, he might like to even the odds
 by demonstrating a form of his own.

>c
 would be willing to even that advantage by showing me one of your
 forms?"

 Sun An laughs. "Never let it be said that I am a man of dishonor," he
 says cheerfully. He moves to the open space you and your students have
 vacated and begins to move.

 The form is a blocking system, involving almost no footwork, but
 focusing on an elaborate pattern of blocks, strikes, and
 counterstrikes. As your opponent begins to move, your students stop
 their own activities throughout the courtyard and join you in watching.
 In truth, Sun An moves beautifully, and his form is a pleasure to
 watch: the rhythm to his movement is syncopated, and his strikes are
 quick, but he never ceases to flow from one shape to the next. When he
 concludes, he bows, and you and your students bow back to him in
 appreciation.

 He rejoins you, and you begin to lead him toward the open door to your
 dining room. "A snake blocking system, I assume?"

 Sun An grins, and though his scar continues to give him an air of
 menace, he seems genuinely happy with your comment. "It is called Plum
 Tree," he says, "and yes, it is snake. Most people assume crane."

 Given his body type and his air of arrogant confidence, you are not
 surprised. "Syncopation with slow flowing movements punctuated by quick
 strikes?" you say in summary. "It could only be snake. You performed it
 well, but again, based on your reputation, I am hardly surprised." You
 gesture through the open door. "Will you join me for tea?"

 The two of you take a moment to breathe in the aroma of your tea and
 appreciate its flavor before moving on to a discussion. You make small
 talk, asking after Sun An's travels prior to reaching Kuei Xian. He, in
 turn, asks about your school, politely inquiring about the number of
 students you teach and the length of time you have been teaching. It is
 much more like the conversation you would expect between two youxia
 meeting in a tea house than the conversation between the master of a
 school and a challenger questioning that master's skill.

 After a while, the discussion turns to business, and you determine the
 boundaries of your competition. Once you have worked out the details,
 Sun An rises, thanking you again for your hospitality. You will see him
 in three days.

 The challenge will take place at a fighting tower, which you and your
 students constructed five years ago for training exercises, not far
 from your home and just outside of town, on the edge of a bamboo
 forest. The tower is built like scaffolding?there is a flat surface at
 the top, about sixty feet in the air, but no ropes around the outside
 to keep opponents from falling to the ground. Though the scaffolding is
 easy to climb, two lines of tall posts also spiral around the tower and
 serve as more challenging steps to reach the top. You have had your
 students spar on the posts as well, chasing each other up and down to
 practice maintaining their balance during a fight.

 You also keep a cache of weapons in a trap door accessible from the top
 of the platform for easy access while your students are training. This
 will enable you to pick and choose your own gear as you see fit during
 the competition.

 A contest like this one requires witnesses, and you have requested the
 presence of a magistrate in order to keep things official. To your
 surprise, Governor Rong himself has volunteered to preside over the
 event. Additional witnesses have been invited, and you would not be
 surprised if some large part of the population of Kuei Xian?and perhaps
 members of the Blue Scarves Rebellion?arrive to watch the combat.

 What terms have you decided on?

 A: We will fight to unconsciousness or disabling; I am prepared to sign
 a death waiver.
 B: We will fight to surrender, but no death waivers will be required.
 C: We will fight using the point system devised by the Imperial
 swordmaster.

>b
 not see the logic in depriving the world of the knowledge a skilled
 martial artist can acquire. Your death, or the death of Sun An, would
 be a loss of knowledge and skill, and you see no need to take the
 challenge that far.

 On the morning of the fight, all of your students accompany you to the
 training tower. There are few clouds, and the temperature is perfect
 for the late spring. Conditions could not be better for a
 challenge?unless, of course, they could somehow favor you rather than
 being equally good for your opponent.

 Feng walks alongside the group, today wearing the guise of a male
 doctor, glasses perched on the bridge of his nose and acupuncture kit
 clutched in his arms. Hopefully you will not need Feng's expertise, but
 it is good to know he is there.

 As you expected, there is a large turnout from the village. Governor
 Rong has brought several bureaucrats to attend and take notes.

 Feng squeezes your hand for luck as you move toward the tables where
 Governor Rong and his attendees are waiting.

 Sun An stands at the first pole, contemplating the height of your
 fighting field. He towers over the villagers, his whiplike body naked
 to the waist, except for the shuang dao?the dual sabers?he wears
 strapped to his back. Despite the scar that runs down his cheek, many
 of the female villagers seem quite taken with his appearance, and you
 notice money changing hands as people bet whether you or your
 challenger will win the day.

 What do you do?

 A: I approach Sun An and bow so that the match begins with honor.
 B: I race to the top. I am eager to get the competition underway.
 C: I acknowledge the crowd, encouraging their cheers.

>a
 asks. He seems eager for the fight ahead, and no worry marks his
 expression. Either he has already dismissed you as a challenge, or he
 has no fear of losing.

 A: I say that my fists will do my talking for me.
 B: I wish him a good fight.
 C: I express a hope that after the challenge, Sun An may stay on at the
 school for a while, either to share his own knowledge or to learn what
 I can share.
 D: I race to the top?I have nothing left to say.

>c
 circumstances, be a peace offering. But you are clearly not backing
 down from the challenge, and he looks at you with new respect.

 "If you win," he says slowly, "I will seriously consider your offer."

 "Then I had better win," you say lightly.

 Sun An bows, then mounts the first post in his spiral.

 How do you get to the top of the tower?

 A: I run up the posts, using my chi to allow me to remain grounded,
 even when I am in the air.
 B: I use my chi to bounce off a few of the posts and fly to the top.
 C: I quickly climb up the scaffolding, hurrying to beat Sun An to the
 top.
 D: I climb the scaffolding slowly, using a razor-thin wire to weave
 traps subtly along the way.

>a
 all. You reach the top to the roaring sound of the crowd, appreciating
 your smooth ascent.

 Sun An appears a moment later, leaping from the final post and onto the
 platform atop the tower.

 You face Sun An across the platform, and the tall warrior draws his
 shuang dao, spinning them with what is clearly intended as an
 intimidating flourish. It is flashy, but rather than intimidate you, it
 shows you more of Sun An's movement style. The weapons are bladed only
 on one side, but it is clear from the speed and confidence with which
 he wields them that he can easily target the bladed side as he chooses.
 Your best options would be to get in too close for his swords to be
 effective, to choose a weapon that gives you a longer reach than his,
 or to keep moving around behind him. All of the shuang dao techniques
 you have seen rely on forward, side, or over the head striking; given
 his greater height, the last poses little threat for you.

 A: I select a guan dao from the weapons cache, choosing to keep him at
 greater distance.
 B: I will fight with daggers?two long knives and several throwing darts
 to give me long and short options.
 C: I select the whip chain I carried with me from the school, which
 allows me both long- and close-range options.

>c
 While it is still above your head, Sun An charges, trying to get inside
 your distance range before you can attack. You snap the whip chain at
 him, the red silk flag at its end fluttering toward the sparking silver
 of his swords. He bats the whip chain out of the way, and you make a
 quick pull, tangling his sword and pulling him off balance. As he gets
 close enough to strike with his free sword, you leap forward and
 side-kick to his other arm, sending his second sword off target as
 well. Sun An continues past you and you free your whip chain as your
 opponent spins his swords around him in a clearing move, giving you
 both some space to consider what you will do next.

 What is your goal as you meet in combat this time?

 A: The faster the fight is over, the better. I am confident that I am
 the better fighter and seek to disable Sun An quickly.
 B: I feel that I should learn more about his style to target his
 weaknesses. I fight defensively.
 C: I want to keep Sun An at the edge of the platform and cause him to
 lose his balance.

>b
 become flashier as his confidence increases. You can tell that his
 greatest weakness is his arrogance, and that despite this flaw, his
 confidence is well earned.

 And by watching him, you are certain that, with his fighting skills
 alone, he is better than you are. You will have to outwit him,
 overwhelm him with your chi, or simply outlast him in order to win. Or
 you must find a way to concede that he is the winner without losing
 face entirely.

 A: I want to keep Sun An at the edge of the platform and cause him to
 lose his balance.
 B: I continue on the defensive, determined to outlast him. When he
 tires, he will become sloppy, and I will make my move.
 C: I meet his eyes, drawing him into a fight of the minds; the rest of
 the battle will play out without further injury to our bodies and allow
 for an honorable surrender.

>c
 see clearly what would happen if they were to meet in combat. As Sun An
 looks at you, the two of you lock gazes, and soon, you see the combat,
 as real as if you were both still engaged. He is the better fighter,
 but you continue on in the mind battle, revealing secrets of your
 style, enticing him with movements you believe he has never seen. You
 have stopped trying to win, and started attempting to persuade him that
 combat is not the only measure of your worthiness. The mind battle
 draws to a conclusion, Sun An's swords hesitating as they rest, crossed
 on your throat. You can almost feel the coolness of their metal against
 your skin, despite the fact that neither you nor he has moved atop the
 platform for several minutes. Finally, after an almost agonizingly long
 time, he removes his swords from your neck.

 "You have an interesting concept of what it means to win," he says,
 sheathing his swords behind his back. And then you are both back atop
 the platform, where Sun An has indeed put his swords away.

 "I concede this contest!" Sun An shouts for the whole of the audience
 to hear. "Zhuge Meili is a worthy teacher and upholds the reputation of
 the Order of the Peach Tree and the school in Kuei Xian." He moves to
 kneel before you. "Zhuge Meili, I surrender to you. Accept me as a
 student."

 A: Now that his guard is down, I attack.
 B: I graciously accept Sun An as a student.
 C: I announce Sun An as my peer.

>b

 Several hours later, over a meal you share with Sun An, you again
 reiterate your invitation for him to become your student. "That is a
 very generous offer," he says, "but I'm afraid staying in one place is
 not in my nature. I wish you well, Zhuge Meili." After a meal, brought
 to you by a demure Feng wearing the form of a serving girl, Sun An
 departs, looking spry despite his injuries.

 "Is he an immortal?" you ask Feng.

 The fox spirit just scoffs and busies herself clearing the table. You
 are pleased that you have managed to prove yourself?and, hopefully,
 ward off any future challengers for some time to come.

 The leaves have fallen from the cherry trees in your courtyard, and the
 chill in the air announces the approach of winter. More than a year has
 passed since your battle with Sun An, and you find your thoughts
 frequently returning to the Order of the Peach Tree.

 Perhaps it is a premonition.

 On a chilly afternoon, Feng, wearing the shape of a single-tailed
 fox?warmer, she says, than her human guises?enters your room with a
 scroll in her mouth. She drops it on the floor and gives you a fox's
 smile, tongue lolling out from between her teeth.

 Despite some lingering saliva and the bite-marks creasing the sealing
 wax, it is clear from the symbol pressed into the seal that this is a
 letter from the Order. It may well contain your summons to return to
 the monastery.

 A: I am in no hurry to open the letter.
 B: I am eager to read news from the monastery, and to return if called.
 C: I hesitate for a moment before opening the letter.

>c
 change again. You take a moment to appreciate what you have learned
 over the past decade before cracking open the seal.

 The letter reads:

 "To my student, Zhuge Meili,

 "All at the Order hope this message finds you well. I send my apologies
 for waiting so long to call for your return. Things have been unsettled
 here, and I was hoping that matters could be better resolved before
 adding additional voices?and tempers?to the mix. Sadly, the situation
 has only become worse in recent days, and I find myself calling all of
 our wandering monks to return to the monastery, to face what may be the
 largest challenge the Order has ever encountered.

 "As you are aware, the foreign presence in the Middle Kingdom has grown
 over the last twenty years. The Order has always followed the lead of
 the Son of Heaven in our actions with the foreigners and maintained an
 aloof stance toward these worldly affairs. But the world has come to
 our door, and we can ignore the foreign presence no longer. A small
 army of the foreigners is gathering to the east, setting up camp
 between the monastery and Xiaonanhai. Though we have sent word to the
 Emperor of the growing force on our doorstep, we cannot be sure that
 any of our messengers have made it past the army. Though they have not
 yet delivered terms, it is clear that if we do not surrender our
 resources?and possibly the monastery itself?they will attack.

 "You are called upon to return to the Order immediately, with any
 resources that will aid our plight. I maintain hope that this can be
 resolved peacefully, or that help will arrive from the Son of Heaven,
 but we must be prepared for things to go otherwise.

 "Abbot Bao"

 The abbot's letter is sobering; if the foreigners do attack the
 monastery, it will be their first prominent target beyond the villages
 they have already claimed. Such a display will make it clear that they
 do not intend to assimilate to the Middle Kingdom, but forge their own
 society in spite of the Emperor and his laws.

 A: This outcome is unsurprising, based on the previous behavior of the
 foreigners. The Order should have been better prepared.
 B: Surely if the foreigners were so great a threat, the Emperor would
 intervene. Like Abbot Bao, I hope for a peaceful resolution.
 C: The Emperor has been too lax in dealing with the foreign threat, but
 perhaps a peaceful solution can be found.
 D: The Order must dig in and defend the monastery, whether or not it
 comes to fighting.

>c\
 foreigners, given the way they have treated the people of the Middle
 Kingdom whose lands they have taken. If the Emperor is not willing to
 make that clear, perhaps the Order can draw some of those lines and
 defend all of the Middle Kingdom through negotiation.

 How will you return to the Order?

 A: I gather my students together and ask them who will come to fight on
 behalf of the Order.
 B: I do not wish to put anyone else in danger; I will travel to the
 monastery alone.
 C: I have no interest in returning to the monastery. My life is here
 now; the Order can fend for itself.

>a
 Though some of them wear fear in their expressions, others meet your
 news with determination to prove their worth.

 You tell everyone to pack what they wish to take with them, and that
 you will be leaving in the morning. But as dawn comes, you see that
 many of your students have not gathered. It appears their fear is
 stronger than their loyalty, and you will be bringing a much smaller
 force with you to the monastery. Feng, in her guise as a human servant,
 gives each student a small package filled with warm buns. The fox
 spirit will be staying in Kuei Xian.

 From here, she will keep your affairs in order; once the matter with
 the foreigners has been resolved, you can decide what will happen with
 the courtyard house and the life you have built in Kuei Xian.

 You and your company start traveling east toward the monastery. It is a
 three-day journey directly to the Order of the Peach Tree, which gives
 you some time to decide which actions you will take, or which course of
 action you will advise, when you arrive. As you are traveling, you
 encounter a few messengers and merchants heading toward Kuei Xian; they
 are able to provide you with updated news since the delivery of your
 letter.

 The foreign army is led by a man named George Gower, who is supposedly
 a fearsome warrior, though the rumors vary as to his origin. Some say
 he was an outlaw before he came to the Middle Kingdom, while others
 swear that he is a representative of a foreign government. Still others
 call him an explorer who landed on the Middle Kingdom's shores and
 paved the way for more foreign settlers to arrive.

 Gower's forces have moved in on the monastery, making it difficult for
 anyone to travel to or from the Order of the Peach Tree. Based on what
 you are told, someone who knows the terrain as well as you once
 did?and, hopefully, still do?should be able to find a path around their
 location.

 How will you approach the army?

 A: We will avoid the army and go straight to the monastery.
 B: I want to get firsthand information about the foreigners. We will
 scout their army before going to the monastery.
 C: I want to meet Gower for myself. We will make contact with the army
 in the open.

>b
 your arrival to the hills below the monastery so that you can see the
 foreign army as dusk is falling. You and your company keep off of the
 road and travel through the bamboo forest that lies in the hills
 beneath the home of the Order. Gower's army looks nothing like the
 organized Imperial Army?instead, they are dressed in a variety of
 foreign clothing, with nothing resembling a uniform. There is very
 little that resembles armor, but then, you do not wear armor, either.
 What is distressing about their encampment is that you see a number of
 cannons and hand cannons?supplies that are commonly used by the
 Imperial Army, though of a different style.

 The Order of the Peach Tree, with their reliance on the physical and
 spiritual arts of battle, has nothing like cannons at the monastery.

 From within the shadows, you can see that the size of the army has not
 been exaggerated. Probably five hundred men are here; though that is a
 small force compared to the Imperial Army, the monks and students that
 live at the monastery would be facing odds of five to one. Even with
 the support you bring, the odds are bleak. One outright fight could be
 disastrous if the men are skilled at combat, especially given their
 likelihood of bringing those explosive weapons into play.

 A: I have seen what I want to see. From here we can cut over to the
 path that leads to the monastery without being noticed.
 B: I want to sabotage their camp.
 C: I am concerned about those cannons. I want to seek out Gower to
 negotiate.

>a
 able to parallel it from inside the bamboo forest until you are out of
 range of both the army and Gower's scouts. You reach the gates of the
 monastery without further complications.

 Your arrival at the monastery is greeted with cheers from the monks who
 remember you. Among the students, there are whispers?clearly, you've
 been spoken about by your old teachers, you hope with compliments
 rather than as an example of what not to do under their instruction.

 But it is Abbot Bao who is most relieved by your presence. The abbot
 has aged in the decade you have been away, and the current situation
 weighs heavily on him. He calls you into the Inner Temple to share what
 you have learned. When you tell him of your journey and what you have
 learned of the foreign army, he greets your news with a blank
 expression, taking it all in without judgment.

 "You have been in the world, my student," he says slowly, "and I have
 been here in the temple for far too long. I fear this decision is
 beyond be, and I ask your advice. How do you think we should deal with
 these foreigners?"

 How do you think the monks should face the foreigners?

 A: We should negotiate with the foreigners.
 B: The monastery is well fortified. We can defend it against an
 outright attack and withstand a siege.
 C: I will challenge a champion from the foreign army in single combat.
 D: I will call the forces of nature against the foreign army.
 E: We will create a ruse, making the monastery look better fortified
 and populated than it is.
 F: I will defer to another of Abbot Bao's advisors and abide by that
 decision.

>a
 Bao allows you to take the lead. Along with a few of your followers,
 you travel down to the camp. The perimeter guards see you coming and
 greet you in their foreign tongue, probably calling for you to halt.

 "Greetings," you say, holding your hands open in a position you hope
 they will view as peaceful. "I am Zhuge Meili, a monk of the Order of
 the Peach Tree. I am hoping to converse with George Gower." The guards
 escort you to a large tent in the middle of the encampment. One steps
 inside and holds a conversation in the foreign tongue; after a moment,
 he returns and ushers you inside. Within, the walls are illuminated by
 glass lanterns, and a bespectacled man with a mop of gray hair tied
 into a tail at his neck stands in greeting.

 "I am George Gower," he says, his accent clear and his mastery of your
 language evident. "I understand you requested a meeting?"

 "I am Zhuge Meili," you say. "I have come to discuss the matter of the
 monastery above us."

 The pale man grins, and you begin to suspect that the gray in his hair
 is affected?he looks as though he must be in his early thirties at
 best. "Ah, I am glad to hear it," he says. "It's been such trouble
 getting you people to converse openly about anything. There's always
 some matter of tea to be shared, or vague references to spirits and
 ancestors and other bothersome things. Always happy to meet someone
 with a straightforward perspective."

 A: I explain the monks are interested in a peaceful outcome to this
 situation and wish to negotiate.
 B: I lie and say that the Emperor is sending troops to make sure the
 matter resolves quickly.
 C: I explain that the monks do not intend to leave the monastery, and a
 siege will end badly for his men.
 D: I lie about the number of warriors available to the Order, claiming
 that we are ready for an attack.
 E: I believe we are at an impasse. He can offer his surrender, or he
 will face the Order in battle.

>a
 walked in. Would you like a cigar?" He holds up a sweet but noxious
 smelling tube of wrapped herbs, and you shake your head. "No, no, none
 of you seem to. A pity, really, but you'll learn. Well, then, to
 business. We're quite interested in the location your monks have taken
 up on that mountain. Quite defensible, by all appearances, but close to
 a major trade route. Seems like an excellent place to camp an army. And
 your people don't seem to be doing much with it aside from jumping
 about at each other, occasionally using sticks, as far as I can tell.
 Looks a bit silly to an outsider, I have to say. Could really do that
 sort of thing anywhere."

 A: I cannot stand the condescending tone this barbarian is using.
 Negotiating will get us nowhere.
 B: I explain that the monks are teachers, scholars, and warriors, well
 respected in the Middle Kingdom for their knowledge.
 C: I question his desire to have an army. Does he expect to challenge
 the Emperor?

>c
 protests, but you see the insincerity behind his statement. "I intend
 to raise my men to protect the good of the Middle Kingdom. There are a
 number of outside interests not nearly so benevolent as me and mine.
 When one of them comes to threaten the well-being of this land, surely
 your emperor will be glad of an ally."

 If he has convinced himself of this lie, there is really no sense in
 negotiating along this line any further. You'll have to try a different
 tactic.

 A: I lie and say that the Emperor is sending troops to make sure the
 matter resolves quickly.
 B: I explain that the monks do not intend to leave the monastery, and a
 siege will end badly for his men.
 C: I lie about the number of warriors available to the Order, claiming
 that we are ready for an attack.
 D: I believe we are at an impasse. He can offer his surrender, or he
 will face the Order in battle.

>b
 you are. "You're quite serious," he says, and you hear a note of
 astonishment in his voice. He studies you for a little longer, then
 runs a hand over his grayed hair, and you begin to suspect that it's a
 wig, some sort of affectation with no purpose that you can see.

 But instead of speaking, he takes a swig out of a metal flask; the
 liquid smells a bit like rice wine, but stronger, with an acrid odor
 that threatens to burn your nostrils on a whiff. He mutters a foreign
 word in a tone that makes you guess it was a curse. "All right then,
 Zhuge Meili. Here's how you can prove to me that your monks are the
 knowledgeable warriors you claim they are. We'll each choose a champion
 who represents the best of our fighters with the best of our weaponry.
 If you?or the warrior of your choosing?can best who I select, then I
 will acknowledge we have something to learn." He tries for a smile, but
 doesn't quite manage. "We've a long tradition of this sort of thing
 where I come from."

 "So do we," you assure him, before he can launch into further
 explanation.

 "If my champion wins," he says, "then you'll agree to vacate the
 property."

 This seems a lot to agree to without the permission of Abbot Bao. "A
 reasonable suggestion," you say. "I will confer with the abbot and send
 a message confirming the terms."

 "I'll expect word by tomorrow morning," Gower says, rising. You stand,
 and he thrusts a hand at you; you realize just in time that he means it
 as a sign of agreement, not an attack. You meet his hand and shake it
 as you rise from your own seat.

 When you arrive at the monastery, you explain to Abbot Bao what has
 transpired, and though he is concerned about the possible outcome, he
 is eager to resolve the conflict without massive casualties on either
 side. Given your role in the negotiation, it does not surprise you when
 Abbot Bao selects you as the Order's champion. To make a point, you
 have decided to face their champion empty handed.

 You walk confidently down the path as the time of your meeting
 approaches. Many of the monks follow you, as much to witness the battle
 as to provide you with support should the foreigners prove
 dishonorable. Just before the camp of the foreigners, a space has been
 cleared, and a young man wearing a cutlass and wielding a hand cannon
 stands next to George Gower himself.

 "Greetings, Zhuge Meili," Gower says cheerfully. "This is Erasmus
 Fontaine. He'll be your opponent today."

 Fontaine looks up at you from his hand cannon and you see clear hatred
 in his eyes. This man means to kill you, regardless of any agreement
 you might be able to reach with Gower.

 "Should your man die, I expect you to continue to honor our agreement,"
 you shout out, so that everyone can hear.

 Fontaine snorts.

 "Of course!" Gower says, waving away your concerns as though they are
 unmerited, and as though you have not just called his honor into
 question. "We've agreed to the terms, monk. Shall we get on with it?"

 Without waiting for you to agree, Fontaine lifts the hand cannon and
 shoots.

 A: I dodge beneath the shot, closing so that his weapon becomes
 useless.
 B: I use my chi to leap over his shot and attack him from above.
 C: I fade slightly to the side, allowing the bullet to graze my
 shoulder, before closing the distance.

>b
 you descend on your opponent. He raises his hand cannon at you in the
 air, but you are already on him, using your higher vantage point to
 execute Parting the Clouds?which rakes twice across his face before
 piercing the pressure point called the village rain, the notch right
 between the clavicles, with an Immortal Man strike. The strike drives
 him downward as your full body weight presses on top of him, and as he
 hits the ground, you feel your fingers crush his windpipe. The
 foreigners, who had begun to cheer when Fontaine shot, fall deadly
 silent. But Gower simply nods at you. "It seems I have underestimated
 you," he says. "We will abide by our agreement." He says something in
 the foreign tongue and you tense?but immediately, the foreigners turn
 away, heading back into their camp. Within hours, they have started a
 retreat, leaving the Order of the Peach Tree to once again decide its
 own fate.

 You are hailed as the hero of the hour, and it is clear your prestige
 has grown among the members of the Order. For your own sake, you are
 glad of the success you had in defending the monastery, and are
 relieved that another challenge is behind you.

 You leap faster than the bullet fires, feeling it pass below you as you
 descend on your opponent. He raises his hand cannon at you in the air,
 but you are already on him, using your higher vantage point to execute
 Parting the Clouds?which rakes twice across his face before piercing
 the pressure point called the village rain, the notch right between the
 clavicles, with an Immortal Man strike. The strike drives him downward
 as your full body weight presses on top of him, and as he hits the
 ground, you feel your fingers crush his windpipe. The foreigners, who
 had begun to cheer when Fontaine shot, fall deadly silent. But Gower
 simply nods at you. "It seems I have underestimated you," he says. "We
 will abide by our agreement." He says something in the foreign tongue
 and you tense?but immediately, the foreigners turn away, heading back
 into their camp. Within hours, they have started a retreat, leaving the
 Order of the Peach Tree to once again decide its own fate.

 You are hailed as the hero of the hour, and it is clear your prestige
 has grown among the members of the Order. For your own sake, you are
 glad of the success you had in defending the monastery, and are
 relieved that another challenge is behind you.

 After the conflict between the Order of the Peach Tree and the
 foreigners at the monastery, events seem to pass quickly. News of the
 foreigners is hard to avoid: more of their ships are landing in the
 fishing villages they took over to establish their own port. While
 their numbers increase, they are also making a clear attempt to
 insinuate themselves further into the Imperial Court. George Gower has
 taken up residence in Xiaonanhai, and the rumor is that he calls on the
 Emperor every day, trying to mold a space for himself as an Imperial
 advisor.

 Or, some whisper, as the man who will try to steal the Emperor's
 throne.

 But though tensions are high, the violence has slowed. The Blue Scarves
 Rebellion has continued with raids, hassling the foreigners at every
 opportunity, but there have been no large-scale battles. It is though
 everyone is holding their breath.

 What do you think the foreigners will do next?

 A: I am still not concerned with worldly affairs. At this point, if I
 weren't also seeking to detach myself from emotional reactions, I'd be
 annoyed with everyone pointing them out to me.
 B: Clearly, there is a reason behind their change in tactics. I analyze
 their locations to determine what outcome they may seek.
 C: They are saving their resources for a large fight. I make discreet
 inquiries into their weapon stores and the supply chain between Gower
 and his men.

>b
 the foreigners on it. They are densest at the shoreline, but while more
 are landing there, there is a trend from the shore northward, toward
 the capital, skirting the marshes when possible. It makes perfect sense
 now why the foreigners wanted control of the monastery: its location is
 directly in the path of the settlements the foreigners have been making
 over the past twenty years.

 But the presence of George Gower at the capital makes you suspect that
 he is not planning to lead an army against the Emperor. If anything,
 you see wisdom in the rumors that he hopes to gain power through
 influencing the Emperor, rather than replacing him. Given how the
 foreigners have treated the people they've displaced, Gower having the
 Imperial ear could be disastrous for the Middle Kingdom.

 You get a clue into Gower's plans the spring after the attack on the
 monastery. It arrives in the form of a summons: sealed with blue wax
 impressed with the shape of a rampant lion, the bleached white paper is
 so stiff it crackles when it opens. The letter reads:

 "To Zhuge Meili:

 "Based on the reputation of your skill and honor, you have been
 selected to compete in a fighting exhibition for the entertainment of
 the glorious Emperor. The fight, which will take place in an arena now
 being constructed just south of the Imperial capital, will feature two
 warriors of my native country on horseback, wielding the weapons of our
 lands. You will fight alongside a captured rebel and traitor to the
 Middle Kingdom, Lu Jin, who will be released from the Imperial dungeons
 for the event. The outcome of the combat will settle a wager between
 myself and the Emperor as to which nation boasts superior fighters.

 "As a reward, the winners will be granted lands and a title by the
 crown, and, should it be relevant, receive a pardon for crimes against
 the Empire. More, however, the winners will have the prestige of having
 defended their country's honor.

 "An Imperial guard will be sent to accompany you.

 "Cheers,

 "George Gower"

 It looks as though you will be unable to simply decline participating
 in this competition. How do you react to this summons?

 A: Lu Jin, a prisoner? Of course we will fight?and win?to insure his
 freedom!
 B: This is our moment to prove the foreigners are unworthy. We will
 fight for the honor of the Middle Kingdom!
 C: This is sure to be a farce, with the game board aligned against us,
 but we will triumph regardless?by whatever means necessary.
 D: I have no interest in fighting in this competition. I will escape
 before the supposed honor guard arrives.

>c
 that the odds were in his favor. He expects to win more than an
 event?he is using this as one more step to gain the Emperor's ear. The
 mere fact that he is having wagers with the Son of Heaven is
 unbelievably presumptuous.

 Whatever it takes to prove that the foreigners are unworthy, you will
 make sure it is done. The following week, a group of Imperial soldiers,
 led by Commander Rong Jue, the son of Governor Rong, arrives to collect
 you. The procession has all the trappings of an honor guard, but from
 the way they watch you, you know that?like you?they consider you a
 prisoner. As you travel to the capital, how do you pass the time?

 A: I talk to Rong Jue, hoping to find out more about what is happening
 in the capital.
 B: I tell stories and jokes, trying to set the soldiers at ease.
 C: I cast an oracle bone to determine whether the Imperial Challenge
 will have good results.
 D: I say nothing to anyone. Traveling in silence will be my rebellion
 against Gower for forcing me into his contest.

>a
 Xiaonanhai life. You can tell that he is trying to give a fair account
 of the foreign presence in the capital city, but you suspect that he
 has no fond feelings for George Gower or the foreigner's position at
 court. If Rong Jue's feelings are representative, you may have other
 allies inside the Imperial city.

 In addition, Rong Jue informs you of how the contest is to work: you
 and Lu Jin will face a pair of foreigners wearing what Gower calls
 "courtly" armor?which Rong explains means outdated armor designed to
 stand against hand-to-hand combat but not hand cannons. The exhibition
 will start on horseback and resolve on the ground, as long as one
 member of each team is alive.

 No matter how many times you have been to Xiaonanhai, it never ceases
 to take your breath away at first sight. As you crest the last hill
 between you and the capital, the walled city stretches out in front of
 you, fading into mist, so that it appears that the city itself extends
 forever. A river runs through the center of the city, and one wall of
 the palace rubs against it like a cat against a friendly hand. The
 palace itself towers above the rest of the city, its golden calligraphy
 catching stray bits of light that float in through the mist, making it
 seem as though the whole building sparkles.

 Xiaonanhai is the center of the Middle Kingdom, its heart and its
 breath. It is a testament to the working of humans, and proof that
 human hands can create something lasting. It also buzzes like a hive of
 angry bees; anyone within its walls must be wary that they are not
 stung by criminals and bureaucrats alike.

 The soldiers are eager to get you to the palace, given that you have
 arrived the day before the competition, but you persuade them to stop
 by Tai Thong, a pastry shop you remember fondly from the last time you
 were in Xiaonanhai. The proprietors treat all their customers like
 family, and the atmosphere gives a sense that, through pastries, one
 can achieve both peace and prosperity. You make a small purchase,
 setting a pork bun aside for Lu Jin, as Rong Jue thinks Lu Jin will be
 released into the custody of the Imperial soldiers as soon as you
 arrive at the palace.

 Instead, however, you are escorted to a guest room in the palace,
 attended to by servants, all with the intent of making you comfortable
 while you wait for hours for further news. All of you ignore the fact
 that soldiers are stationed outside your door. Finally, after night has
 fallen, a thin and damp Lu Jin is ushered into your room. They have
 clearly just bathed him, in order to look presentable, you assume, for
 your competition.

 A: I go to Lu Jin's side immediately to make sure he is unharmed.
 B: We don't know who might be watching. I gesture to the table in the
 guest chamber and offer Lu Jin a pork bun.
 C: I nod to Lu Jin and wish him a good night.

>b
 any time eating it. "So," he says finally, "I suppose you have a plan
 to defeat the foreigners. I hope you'll consider my ideas as well."

 You agree to listen to Lu Jin's suggestions, though as he has been
 incarcerated for months, it appears, you wonder how he could have
 anything useful to add. As you sit together, Lu Jin gives you all the
 information about the competition he has been able to glean. The two
 foreign competitors are masters of an old sport combat style called
 jousting that is rarely practiced in Gower's home country except for
 entertainment. They will be wearing thick plates of armor and carrying
 shields, using long lances to try to unhorse or kill you in a direct
 charge. You will be provided with ji, spear-tipped halberds that have
 crescent blades around a sword-breaker on either side of the haft.

 "Their armor is an advantage on horseback, but we'll move much faster
 than they will on the ground," Lu Jin theorizes. "And they'll have
 limited visibility due to their helmets?we should be able to stay in
 their blind spots, again if we can bring them to the ground. The hard
 part about the armor is that it offers very few openings: their eyes
 and at the softer armor covering their joints?which is still heavy
 enough to deflect a blade."

 Your brain begins working around these issues. "We'll need to figure
 out their other disadvantages," you say, almost to yourself.

 "Or you could ask for help," says a familiar voice. The only remaining
 palace servant steps forward, and you instantly recognize Feng, despite
 the fox spirit's new disguise. Lu Jin looks at you in confusion, but
 you just nod for him to listen. "I can offer you these," Feng says,
 rolling two small vials out onto the palm of her hand. "Poison enough
 to coat one blade each."

 Lu Jin begins to reach for the poison.

 A: Feng has never led me astray before. This is a clever plan, even if
 it is dishonorable, and I am confident we can execute it without
 notice.
 B: Feng is a fox spirit?my companion or not, tempting monks into
 dishonor is in her nature. No good will come of taking up her offer.
 C: If we were caught using poison, we would be shown as dishonorable
 opponents. We cannot risk that loss of face, so we cannot accept the
 poison.
 D: We will not stoop to such a dishonorable tactic!

>c
 consequences not only to us, but to the reputation of the Middle
 Kingdom, would be disastrous."

 "Then let's not get caught," Lu Jin says excitedly. "We need this sort
 of advantage, Zhuge Meili."

 You look at both Feng and Lu Jin, giving them your best teacher stare.
 "No," you say, "we don't. We can use the sword breakers on the ji to
 open their armor like peeling off a can if it comes down to it. But
 this?someone will find out eventually. And everything we're seeking to
 prove?that we are better fighters than the foreigners, that the Middle
 Kingdom has greater honor?will be completely undone."

 Lu Jin weighs your words, then turns away. "May your confidence be
 merited," he says bitterly. You say goodbye to Feng, and both you and
 Lu Jin agree to turn in for the night. As you are falling asleep, you
 think you hear voices, but you put it off to being the palace servants
 going about their work.

 The next morning, you and Lu Jin are escorted by no fewer than twenty
 armed Imperial soldiers, including Rong Jue, to a field north of the
 city wall. There are raised stands of seating, crafted, you suspect,
 from bamboo, and a pavilion is on a raised dais overlooking an oblong
 arena. The whole thing looks very odd to you, and Gower's work is
 evident in everything from the pennant flag decorations to the strange
 rope, suspended at chest height, that divides the arena. Two riders,
 completely covered in steel armor, stand next to two horses at the far
 end of the arena; you and Lu Jin are escorted to two waiting horses and
 a weapons rack at the other side.

 Now that the moment is upon you, how will you prepare for this
 competition to begin?

 A: Select a weapon from the rack.
 B: Greet our opponents so that the combat begins with honor.
 C: Examine the horses to make sure they are in good condition.
 D: I am ready for battle!

>c
 nothing has been tampered with. Sure enough, you see that the tie
 securing the saddle on one of the horses has been sliced, and that the
 other has a burr in its bridle.

 You call for Rong Jue, who comes over immediately. "Is there a
 problem?"

 When you explain, Rong Jue's face goes dark. But before he can say
 anything, you suggest, "Could you bring us two fresh horses?"

 He nods shortly. "I will see that two stallions are brought from the
 army stables," he says, and you can hear the anger in his voice. "You
 will not be taken advantage of."

 A short time later, the commander returns with two new mounts, and they
 are glorious ones, far better than the pair here originally. You and Lu
 Jin bow to Rong Jue, and he returns the bow, saying nothing further
 about the incident.

 Do you make any further preparations?

 A: Select a weapon from the rack.
 B: Greet our opponents so that the combat begins with honor.
 C: I am ready for battle!

>a
 straight-edged jian and a pair of hook swords. Lu Jin takes the hook
 swords and flourishes them for a moment before nodding and hooking them
 into his belt. You choose a ji that is almost as weighty as one of
 Master Zhuge's guan dao and a jian that ends in a red tassel, which
 should catch your opponent's eyes as a distraction should the combat
 move to the ground.

 Do you make any additional preparations?

 A: Greet our opponents so that the combat begins with honor.
 B: I am ready for battle!

>a
 this, but you see no reason for your fight to begin without honor. You
 strike out across the field until Lu Jin grabs you by the wrist.

 "What are you doing?" he hisses.

 "Greeting our opponents," you say. "They may not wish to follow our
 customs, but we should represent the Middle Kingdom by beginning this
 fight with honor." Lu Jin sneers. "They are not worthy of such respect.
 Go on your own if you wish."

 You leave Lu Jin behind without further argument, walking to the other
 side of the arena and bowing in greeting to your opponents. The two
 armored fighters lift the visors of their helmets, and you see the
 light-skinned faces of two men younger than you are, but clearly
 skilled fighters or they would not be here.

 One of them asks the other a confused question, which the second
 answers with a smile. "Hello to you, too," he says to you, his accent
 quite competent for a foreigner. "Lovely day for a battle to the death,
 isn't it?"

 You smile politely. "Perhaps it will not come to that," you say
 serenely, imagining Abbot Bao's voice behind your words. "We look
 forward to seeing your skills on display and hope for an honorable
 competition."

 The warrior looks slightly embarrassed. "Yes, well, we look forward to
 seeing your skills, too," he says clumsily. "Honor and all that."

 The first warrior asks for a translation, and the two of them rattle
 back and forth for a minute, with the first warrior soon looking as
 sheepish as the second. "Nice to meet you," he says, haltingly, with a
 big smile. You bow again and return to your side of the field.

 The encounter seems rather suspicious, but you think that by crossing
 the field to greet them, you have inspired some real respect from your
 opponents, which can only work to your advantage.

 Do you make any additional preparations?

 A: I am ready for battle!

>a
 each other.

 "We will win," Lu Jin says confidently. You wonder whether he is
 reassuring himself or you.

 You tell Rong Jue that you are ready, and he gestures to one of the
 other soldiers. Suddenly, a drum call fills the arena, and you and Lu
 Jin, on horseback, are escorted to the dais. The two foreigners, also
 riding their horses, stop next to you, and the four of you wait as the
 Emperor's silk-enclosed litter is run up to the dais by his guards.
 They stop and lower the Emperor to the ground, where he watches from
 behind the thin curtains.

 George Gower and several members of the Imperial bureaucracy take their
 seats near the Emperor's litter. As everyone is settled, one of the
 magistrates calls out, "Let the Imperial Challenge begin!"

 The stands, full now of spectators, erupt in cheers. The foreign
 horsemen ride quickly back to their end of the arena. Rong Jue, who is
 providing your escort, hisses instructions to you.

 "The foreigners will ride the center of the field?they call it the
 pitch?with their lances," he says. "They are steel tipped and meant to
 kill. But they are accustomed to continuing on the pass, reaching the
 end, and turning around again, based on the practices I have watched.
 You're on the first pass?Lu Jin's second."

 He pulls away as you reach the end of the field. "Good luck!"

 What strategy do you use to face the foreigners?

 A: I am confident I can fight on horseback.
 B: I want to fight on the ground, and will aim to unhorse the rider.
 C: I can take a mounted fighter from the ground. I will get off the
 horse at the pass and attack unmounted.

>b
 rope divider. You can see your opponent's strategy: he is seated firmly
 in his saddle, weight forward, his lance balanced across the horse's
 neck so that his shield faces you. His attack is based on momentum, and
 clearly his customary rules expect you to stay where he will hit you.

 But one of the first rules of combat you learned was that if you are in
 a place where someone wants to hit you, don't be there. Move somewhere
 else and disrupt their offense to gain the advantage.

 How do you plan to unhorse your foe?

 A: I stand on the saddle and use my chi to leap onto his horse,
 dragging him to the ground.
 B: I command my horse to leap across the rope and swing my ji to attack
 on his unshielded side.
 C: My horse is stronger than I am; I speak to it in comforting words,
 letting it dart out of the way before it rears to kick my foe from his
 saddle.

>a
 As your opponent bears down on you, you crouch in the saddle, then you
 spring over his lance and tackle him. Your combined weight and the
 change in momentum send both of you toppling from the back of his
 horse. You land on top of him, allowing your full weight to crash into
 him before you roll off and spring to your feet. He clambers after you,
 moving faster than you'd have expected given the awkward weight of the
 armor, though still far slower than you. He draws his sword.

 Lu Jin's horse flies past yours, and you realize he is headed into his
 own part of the combat.

 Now that you and your foe are both on the ground, how do you attack?

 A: I will outlast him. That armor is heavy, and I can dance around him
 all day.
 B: I will make it look like I am giving him openings, leading him to
 overextend and throw himself off balance.
 C: I will disarm him?whether that means his weapon or his arm.

>b
 strike?and knowing when to combine those two elements to launch a
 surprise attack. You keep drawing your opponent into your range,
 deflecting his blows and keeping him off balance. Eventually, he
 overextends himself, and his lunge sends him stumbling forward. You
 strike him on the back of his helmet as he falls, and when you check
 him to receive his surrender, you find that he is sleeping
 peacefully?though he will likely have quite the headache in the
 morning.

 Across the field, Lu Jin and his opponent are still locked in battle.
 You hurry across the field to join them.

 By the time you reach Lu Jin, both Lu Jin and his opponent are on the
 ground, locked in a sword fight. The foreign warrior is relying on his
 armor to protect him from Lu Jin's blows, and for the most part, this
 strategy works, with Lu Jin's hook swords skittering off the steel. But
 his strikes are slow, and Lu Jin, though wounded, is dancing out of the
 way of his strikes. When Lu Jin sees you approach, however, his
 strategy changes. He darts around behind the armored warrior and hooks
 both of the warrior's arms in his hook swords.

 "Now!" Lu Jin yells at you.

 A: I am tough enough that I can deliver a knockout blow from beneath
 the helmet, despite the armor between me and my foe's chin.
 B: I deliver a piercing blow with the jian's tip through the hole in
 the helmet, killing him.
 C: I gather my chi and throw the energy at him with a shout,
 momentarily paralyzing him.

>c
 combat; you gather chi from the earth beneath you, cradling it in front
 of you until you hear a gasp from the spectators, indicating that they
 can see your chi ball as well. You thrust it at the armored fighter,
 and as the shock of the energy hits him, he collapses to the ground.
 You and Lu Jin stand together, both of your foes out of the fight, and
 as one, you face the dais and give a deep bow in the direction of the
 Emperor. The spectators cheer wildly in the stands, and the drums beat
 in a roll so constant that it sounds like a thunderstorm. The
 magistrate announces you as the winners and Imperial Champions, proving
 the fighters of the Middle Kingdom are superior. You and Lu Jin are
 once again escorted back to the Imperial palace, this time as heroes.

 But when you reach the palace, another group of soldiers are waiting
 for you. Rong Jue looks at them in confusion, but a soldier whose
 insignia shows a higher rank demands to take Lu Jin into custody.

 "By the Emperor's command, Lu Jin won his freedom,"Rong Jue says
 cautiously.

 The ranking officer shakes his head. "That was before it was discovered
 that the rebel coated his blade with poison," he accuses, and Lu Jin
 pales. He draws your jian from its sheath and you prepare to stop him
 from attacking the guards. But he does not lash out at them?instead, he
 stabs himself through the stomach, a deep wound that will bring about
 his death.

 "I die a free man," he says.

 "And an Imperial Champion," you say kindly. Your old rival's eyes
 flutter closed one last time, and his blood cascades like liquid ruby
 down the palace steps.

 Two days later, you are summoned before the Emperor. Though you are
 required to remain several steps back from the throne, the Emperor
 shows you his face, and bestows one of his rare smiles upon you.

 "Congratulations, my Imperial Champion," he says. "You have shown the
 Middle Kingdom that we have much to be proud of."

 He does not mention Lu Jin's tragic fate.

 "You are welcome in my Court," he says. "Let it be known throughout the
 Middle Kingdom that you are the empire's hero."

 The subsequent awards you receive of land and wealth to match your new
 status are almost secondary to that proclamation.

 You have learned, in all your years as a student, as a monk, and as a
 teacher that life contains surprises. Sometimes the thing that you most
 wanted is the thing most likely to set you back on the path to your
 goals. Sometimes those goals must be set aside to fully live the life
 in front of you. There are moments when you must simply be, existing in
 a time and space that will never again occur. Other times, you must
 act, fulfilling the role that has been placed before you. These are the
 thoughts that enter your mind as you travel with a group of the monks
 of the Order of the Peach Tree to Xiaxue Mountain.

 More than twenty years have passed since you first became a monk, and
 the Order is celebrating the hundredth year: the day when the Dragon
 Sage descends to the top of Xiaxue Mountain is almost here. You are
 among the candidates to be chosen to greet the Dragon and ask a
 question.

 A: I may be eligible, but I am happy with my life. I would rather
 someone else ask the Sage a question than risk a life-changing event.
 B: I am still concerned about issues of this world, and know that the
 Dragon Sage will have the answers I crave.
 C: I have led a good life, but I am ready to leave everything behind if
 that is what the Dragon Sage requires.

>c
 from Master Shen so long ago, do not worry over the past or fear the
 future: exist in the moment. If you are the one chosen to question the
 Dragon Sage, you will do the Order proud. And thankfully, you came to
 terms with your eligibility just in time. Abbot Bao, who has traveled
 with the group of monks, draws you aside.

 "Zhuge Meili, you have proven yourself to be honorable, and you have
 gained the respect of the Middle Kingdom. The Order has chosen you to
 represent us in speaking to the Dragon Sage. Will you accept this task
 on our behalf?"

 You bow solemnly, as the occasion requires. "Yes," you say, and are
 pleased with the clarity of your voice in this important moment.

 Abbot Bao returns your bow. Then he surprises you by clapping you on
 both shoulders and looking at you with tears at the corners of his
 eyes.

 "You have made me proud, my student," he says.

 Emotion threatens to overwhelm you as well, but instead you heft your
 climbing gear on your shoulder, squeeze the old abbot's hand, and begin
 your climb up the mountain.

 Though monks have been climbing Xiaxue for centuries, the path is a
 difficult one. You think back to something Master Zhuge once told you
 about mountain climbing?that it is important to think only of the next
 step, and that soon you will reach the top?and it makes you smile. You
 wonder now where the Veiled Dragon may be, and whether she is still
 writing poetry.

 You think for a moment that you see a flash of red?like the tail of a
 fox?against the mountain snow, but when you look, it is gone.

 The way is cold, and the air is thin, but you go at a steady pace, and
 the activity keeps your body warm. You reach a large cave near the
 peak, which provides you with shelter against the wind, just as you see
 a thin shape spiraling down from the Heavens. Though the sky is covered
 in clouds, every once in a while, light catches off the yellow scales
 of the Dragon Sage, who grows larger with every heartbeat. The dragon's
 head is like a camel; its legs end in paws like a tiger's, with each
 toe capped in an eagle's claw. As it comes closer, you see its belly is
 like a clam, its neck is like a snake, and on its head are cow's ears,
 deer's horns, and demon eyes. The Dragon Sage descends, and its scales
 remind you of those of a carp, catching the glimmer of sunlight through
 the clouds as a fish's scales gleam beneath the water's surface. You
 had heard all of these qualities before?scholars have catalogued dragon
 bodies down to the number of scales?but seeing the combination in
 person is breathtaking.

 As the Dragon Sage lands next to you, you find yourself holding your
 breath in awe. The dragon chuckles. "Greetings, monk," it says, in a
 voice that sounds like the rumble of thunder. You can feel it vibrate
 in your chest. "The time has come for you to ask me a question."

 The moment has come. Long ago, you chose a question, but many years
 have passed, and you have grown and changed. With what you now know
 about the world and what you know about yourself, what question will
 you ask?

 A: How can I become the greatest warrior in the world?
 B: How can the Empire return to Heaven's Favor?
 C: What is the first question?
 D: Why do kites fly?

>b
 it tumbling down outside the door. "Little monk," it chortles, "you
 have already returned the Middle Kingdom to the favor of Heaven! With
 every choice you have made, you have restored that balance. You have
 regained tianxia."

 The word the Dragon Sage uses?under heaven?means the entire world; you
 believe the Dragon Sage means that the world, in both physical and
 metaphysical aspects, has aligned to once again be a single entity.

 "But balance can always be tipped, and thus your job is far from over,
 little monk." The Dragon Sage places one of its huge tiger paws on your
 shoulder, and you feel each of the four eagle talons as they gently
 rest on your skin. "You are already the Imperial Champion, giving you a
 voice in the Imperial Court. What role best suits your future?"

 A: A respected scholar, whom even the Emperor seeks for advice.
 B: An Imperial advisor, whom the Emperor uses as primary counsel.
 C: A general in the Imperial Army, whom the Emperor relies upon for
 matters of state.
 D: A leader in the Order of the Peach Tree?who will build firmer ties
 to the Emperor.
 E: The Emperor. This dynasty nearly brought the Middle Kingdom to ruin;
 I will return us to glory.

>b
 energy wash over you, filling you with confidence and, you quickly
 realize, a sharper intellect and a greater insight. You realize that
 the Dragon Sage wants the Heavens and the Middle Kingdom to be aligned,
 and in asking this question and choosing this role, you are fulfilling
 its wishes as well. "The path before you will be a dangerous one," the
 Dragon Sage warns. "The Imperial Court is difficult to navigate even at
 the best of times. But your cleverness and your intuition will guide
 you, and the Emperor will come to rely on your judgment."

 You quickly realize the weight of this gift. You will be under the
 scrutiny of the most powerful members of the Imperial Court, and many
 will be looking for a way to remove you from the equation. It will not
 be an easy path, but you are prepared to walk it without fear.

 You bow deeply to the Dragon Sage, pressing your forehead to the
 ground, and when you rise, the dragon is already flying back into the
 heavens. But as you watch the sun glint off those carplike scales, you
 are filled with confidence. There will be balance, and you will serve
 as the conduit. And as you descend the mountain, you feel as though
 your place in tianxia?all the world under heaven?is exactly where it
 should be.

 The Dragon Sage has returned to the Heavens.

 If you had it to do all over again, what question would you ask?

 A: Play again.
 B: Play more games like this.
 C: Share this game with friends.

>a

 The noise of battle is distracting, and it takes you almost too long to
 realize that the warning was shouted to you. An outlaw wearing a blue
 turban is charging toward you, his longspear leveled at your heart.
 What will you do?

 A: Stand firm, blocking the spear away at the last moment and slashing
 twin tiger claws across his face.
 B: Pounce toward him at the last moment, springing like a leopard, and
 bring an elbow down on his head.
 C: Dart off to the side, balancing on one leg like a crane before
 delivering a swift kick to his knee.
 D: Weave hypnotically in my stance, and when he strikes, I am no longer
 there; I launch a series of quick, snakelike strikes to the pressure
 points in his exposed rib cage.
 E: Make a series of flashy moves that draw his target toward my right
 side, then move to the left, delivering a reiken strike to the right
 side of his head as he passes by.
 F: Remain still, my hands low at the chi center of my body, and at the
 moment he would hit me, circle his spear away and shift myself away
 from the strike.

>go down
 injured side. He looks suddently exhausted, courtesy of the disruption
 in his chi that your knowledge of the mystical Snake technique allowed.

 With your opponent deterred, but not out of the fight, how do you
 follow up your attack?

 A: Use a palm heel strike under the chin to drive his head backwards,
 tearing down with a tiger claw on his face as he falls.
 B: Drive into him with a series of fast leopard punches down the center
 of his body until he falls to the ground.
 C: Take his leg out from under him with a sweeping straight kick,
 delivering a wing strike to his neck at the same moment, graceful as a
 crane.
 D: With my fingers tight like a snake's head, strike out at his face
 and neck in a complex pattern of several hits that impact on nerve
 points, disabling him.
 E: Feign a low kick to the knee, and when he moves the spear shaft down
 to block, shoot a dragon tooth strike?my fingers separated in a V?into
 his eyes before sweeping him from behind.
 F: His death would be senseless and against the Buddha nature; pivot
 around behind him and lock him in a sleeper hold.

>go down
 chi, drop him to the ground, unconscious. He'll be feeling that when he
 wakes up.

 The outlaws continue toward you and your fellow students, flashes of
 blue catching your eye against the greens and browns of the marsh
 surrounding your path. It is hard to imagine that only moments ago, the
 nine of you were making your way back to the monastery of the Order of
 the Peach Tree, students on the simple assignment of escorting a
 wagonload of supplies home.

 The students have mostly remained on the path, where their footing is
 more certain, but the outlaws appear to have little trouble navigating
 the wetlands. While they fight like untrained peasants, numbers are
 definitely on their side.

 It's time to get serious. Drawing on the training you received before
 entering the Order of the Peach Tree, you prepare your next attack. How
 will you fight?

 A: Draw my sword. This blade was forged by the most expert smiths in
 the Middle Kingdom, designed specifically to be used with the Celestial
 Sword style, taught only to the Imperial Family.
 B: Unhitch the horse from the cart of supplies. He is a mean beast?not
 the fine mare I trained on at my father's estate?but few monks could
 master a horse from as honorable a family as mine. I draw my blade and
 prepare to charge.
 C: Draw on my chi, as well the energy in the world around me. I can
 sense the life energies of my fellow students and the approaching
 outlaws.
 D: Release the bindings that secure my longspear to my back. It is only
 one of the many weapons I have mastered in my wanderings, and it is a
 good choice to keep the outlaws at bay.
 E: Why change? The style my masters at the Order of the Peach Tree are
 teaching me is a superior one, and I am eager to prove the worth of my
 unarmed style in battle.

>c
 what the uninformed consider "magic." But you know to be your power to
 be from the energies of the universe, which are at your beck and call.
 You also know that the perception of your abilities can be used against
 your enemies?and one day, you hope it will inspire your allies. For
 now, the other students shy away from you, except for Lu Jin, your
 primary rival for the place of senior student, who watches you with a
 wary eye.

 The battle that follows is hectic; the outlaws have little in the way
 of skill, but they make up for it in passion. They are determined to
 have your supplies, despite the clear skill shown by you and your
 fellow students. Though you are focused on keeping them from trying to
 kill you, you notice as you disable your opponents that they are
 skinny, likely the result of being poorly fed. You also note that a
 number of the outlaws are women.

 Does that surprise you?

 A: Yes. Fighting is the realm of warriors, and the role of the warrior
 falls to the men.
 B: No. Outlaws have always bucked convention; why bother following
 social rules?
 C: Yes, but it is nice to know that I am not alone in questioning
 traditional roles.
 D: No. I am used to fighting side by side among men and women
 accomplished in the way of battle.

>go down
 Luckily for you, the Order of the Peach Tree feels similarly. Are you a
 man or a woman?

 A: I am a man.
 B: I am a woman.

>b

 A: Yin.
 B: Meili.
 C: Yan.
 D: None of these is my name.

>b

 And what is your family name?

 A: Liu.
 B: Wong.
 C: Cao.
 D: None of these is my family name.

>a

 The bandits are quickly losing their resolve to steal your wagon; they
 still have numbers on their side, but many have fallen, wounded or
 dead, at your feet. You hear the far-off sound of a whistle, and the
 bandits begin to disengage, quickly fading back into the marsh. Though
 you and your fellow students have done a formidable job of holding off
 the bandits, you see that your fellows have taken some injuries as
 well.

 What do you do?

 A: Retreat back to the monastery, so that my fellow students can have
 their wounds treated immediately.
 B: Question one of the wounded bandits about the attack.
 C: Pursue the bandits into the marsh.

>b
 that this scrawny bandit is no more than thirteen. Malnourished and
 weak, it is amazing he is not dead from the beating he received.

 A: I feel admiration for his bravery, in spite of his conditions. I
 tell him he fought well.
 B: I feel pity for this boy who has turned to thievery to survive.
 C: I am furious that this urchin attacked us.

>a
 despite his pain. "I must fight well," he says, "because no one else
 will fight for me." He says it almost like a mantra. You ask your
 questions, and the boy gives you answers he appears to believe are
 true: the supplies you carry were targeted because they would be useful
 to the bandits, not because the outlaws wish to offend the Order of the
 Peach Tree. He does not know how many bandits there are, but he says
 that almost all that he knows were farmers, forced out of their homes
 by the foreigners who have been encroaching on the Middle Kingdom.

 A: I let the boy and the other wounded bandits go with no intention of
 bringing them to the law. They are people suffering from circumstances
 beyond their control.
 B: I let the boy go and warn him and the other bandits that they must
 cease their crimes against the Empire. I will make sure that their
 banditry is reported to the local magistrate, but will hope they repent
 of their crimes.

>a

 Lu Jin takes a deep breath, as though deciding whether or not to share
 a thought, before he says, "It wasn't like this before the foreigners
 came. With them eating up resources?and with the Emperor standing by
 while his people starve and lose their land to these invaders?the
 people have no hope."

 Lu Jin's openness is surprising, but what he says amounts to treason.
 Questioning the Emperor's will so openly will certainly lead him to
 trouble.

 Does that trouble start with you?

 A: How dare he question the Emperor! I challenge him immediately.
 B: I agree with Lu Jin, but I respond noncommittally. Just because he
 is asking for trouble by speaking his mind does not mean I will risk my
 neck.
 C: I agree with Lu Jin and am glad to find someone to discuss the
 Empire's problems with.
 D: I do nothing. I am not interested in politics.

>a
 students, who watch you anxiously. "Perhaps another time."

 His refusal to fight puts you in an awkward position; if he refused to
 defend himself, you could be thrown out of the Order of the Peach Tree
 for attacking a fellow student without provocation.

 A: He insulted the Emperor. I cannot delay in seeking retribution.
 B: I wait, but I do not forget.

>b

 As you walk back to the monastery, you take a moment to consider the
 path that has brought you here. As a child, you were told stories of
 the Order of the Peach Tree, a monastery where many great warriors were
 trained. But it was not just the combat skills that enticed you. Every
 hundred years, one member of the Order of the Peach Tree is given the
 honor of consulting the Dragon Sage. That monk may ask a single
 question of the wise dragon. It is only thirty years until the next
 monk of the Order of the Peach Tree is selected, and you are determined
 to be the order's representative to the dragon.

 What question drives you toward this goal?

 A: I know I have much to learn of combat, but I am convinced that the
 Dragon Sage holds the key to greatness beyond what I can learn from
 mortal teachers. I plan to ask, "How can I become the greatest warrior
 in the world?"
 B: The strife I see in the Middle Kingdom?so recently reiterated by my
 encounter with the bandits?disturbs me greatly. I wish to see balance
 restored to the Middle Kingdom, so that the Emperor is once again in
 alignment with the Heavens. I will ask, "How can the Empire return to
 Heaven's Favor?"
 C: I am more concerned with esoteric knowledge than worldly issues. I
 wish to ask, "What is the first question?"
 D: My question is simple: "Why do kites fly?"

>b
 Emperor back on the path of Heaven, it is the Dragon Sage.

 A few days after the conflict with the outlaws in the marsh, Abbot Bao
 Ho sends for you to meet him beneath the peach tree. The tree itself is
 ancient: you have been told that most peach trees live, at most, fifty
 years, but this one has grown wide around the trunk and gnarled in the
 branches. Despite its age, it continues to produce fruit. Some say that
 this is the peach tree after which the monastery was named, a true
 immortal tree in the breed of trees that represents immortality. Others
 believe it to be a descendant of the original peach tree, the result of
 careful cultivation by the monks who teach you.

 What do you think?

 A: It must be immortal.
 B: If it is grown from the cuttings of earlier trees, the continuation
 of its line makes it immortal despite its many incarnations.
 C: The tree is clearly not immortal; only the superstitious and
 uneducated would believe so.
 D: I haven't given it much thought.
 E: I don't care.

>b

 The peach tree's branches extend over a reflection pool. It is normally
 a very peaceful spot, but now the atmosphere is tense. Abbot Bao stands
 there with Master Shen, the oldest teacher in the monastery, at his
 side, and the two men wear identical expressions of concern.

 Just as you arrive, Lu Jin approaches from the other side. He appears
 as surprised to see you as you are to see him.

 "Greetings, my senior students," Abbot Bao says in greeting.

 Lu Jin bows. "Do you have training for us today, masters?"

 Master Shen chuckles. "Always so eager for more, Lu Jin? As I recall,
 at our last bout between the senior students, Liu Meili gave you a very
 fine black eye."

 Lu Jin bares his teeth at you in a smile that is neither humble nor
 friendly.

 "Unfortunately, my students, this is no simple matter of training,"
 Abbot Bao says. "Or, perhaps it is, but not of our usual devising. You
 told us of your experience with the bandits along the road to the
 Order, and I am afraid it is becoming an all too common experience in
 these interesting times. Too many people of the Middle Kingdom are
 turning to thieving and banditry to make their ends meet, and too many
 honest folk are made to suffer."

 Master Shen grunts, and you think you hear him mutter something about a
 distinct lack of honest folk, but it is unclear.

 The abbot continues: "Because you have some experience, and because we
 feel it will be a good test of your readiness to fully join the order,
 we have chosen the two of you to lead a group of students to the
 village of Kuei Xian, across the Baijiang Bridge, to solve the trouble
 locals are having with the bandits."

 Lu Jin blanches momentarily, but your teachers do not seem to notice.

 How do you respond to this mission?

 A: It is an honor to be chosen, even if I must share leadership with Lu
 Jin. I agree to set off at once.
 B: I can't wait to try my skills against real opponents again.
 C: Lu Jin's hesitation is an opportunity for me. I volunteer to take
 the team alone.
 D: I am not really interested in this interruption to my training.

>c
 rival's hesitation.

 "I feel it would be best to have both of you on this task," he says
 slowly. "If you are uncertain?"

 "No," says Lu Jin. "I am ready to do what the Order asks of me."

 Both Master Shen and Abbot Bao watch Lu Jin with some concern for
 another moment. Even though you will both be going together, it seems
 you have successfully undermined his position.

 There are actually fewer details than you would have expected for this
 mission. Neither Abbot Bao nor Master Shen knows how many bandits are
 present near Kuei Xian. They do know that the center of activity seems
 to be at Baijiang Bridge, an old stone bridge that remains from the
 years of the Sun Dynasty, when an army marched across it five horses at
 a time, or so legends say. Kuei Xian, which sits in the shadow of a
 huge, turtlelike karst hill in the foothills of the Yellow Mountains,
 is a small village, but with important enough history?and pleasant
 enough weather?that the governor of the province keeps his summer home
 there.

 Governor Rong is disinclined to ask the Emperor to help combat the
 problem directly. (You gather from Master Shen's muttered commentary
 that this would make it look as though he cannot solve the problems of
 his own district.) Instead, he has asked the Order of the Peach Tree
 for aid, and given the importance of the trade that flows across the
 Baijiang Bridge, and the order's dedication as protectors of the people
 of the Middle Kingdom, the abbot has agreed.

 Of course, should you and Lu Jin fail to quell the problem, more
 important resources than students will have to be expended, either by
 the Order or by the Emperor. This would bring dishonor to everyone:
 you, the order, Governor Rong, and possibly the Emperor himself in the
 face of the foreigners at his court.

 Abbot Bao tells you the names of the students he expects to accompany
 you. Several of them were present when the bandits attacked. You are to
 ready your equipment and leave in the morning.

 A: I seek out Lu Jin to discuss this mission.
 B: I go to my room to prepare for morning.

>a
 co-leader with you?but you're equally unenthusiastic about working with
 him. Still, as Master Shen would say, better to be prepared.

 You look over a map of the Baijiang Bridge, and, unsurprisingly, you
 conflict about every possible approach.

 Exasperated, Lu Jin finally says, "We may as well just ask them to
 leave, for all the good we're going to do."

 A: We could try negotiation. If we can find the leader, maybe we can
 work something out.
 B: What a ridiculous idea.

>a

 "Maybe we can," he agrees noncommittally.

 You discuss tactics for a little while longer, with greater success
 than previously, and you decide to turn in, to make sure you have
 prepared and rested enough for morning.

 The Order of the Peach Tree, though farther from the Yellow Mountains
 than Kuei Xian, is nestled among karst mountains that increase as you
 travel west toward the Baijiang River. The road is a well-traveled one,
 a drier route than the road you so recently traversed through the
 wetlands south of the monastery. Despite the traditional sengfu monk
 garb that you and your fellow students wear?the high boots, pants, and
 one-sleeved robe, tied with a sash?which marks you as members of the
 Order, you are given no more notice than the other travelers you
 encounter. There are eighteen of you, total: you and Lu Jin each have a
 team of eight students, for good luck. Each team is nine, a symbol of
 permanence, and of synergy with the heavens.

 Does the numerology comfort you?

 A: Of course. When embarking upon matters like this, I am glad for any
 numerical advantage.
 B: No. The outcome will be determined by greater skill, not by numbers.
 C: We are all one team, making us eighteen, which is neither lucky nor
 unlucky. We will make our own fate.
 D: More superstitious nonsense.
 E: I hadn't noticed the numbers before.

>b
 the side of the bandits. You pass a number of merchants with carts
 drawn by water buffalo, messengers and warriors on horseback, and
 travelers walking along the road with bundles on their backs. It is a
 fine day: the sky is blue, the clouds are wisps, and the summer air is
 thick with the smell of blossoms and ripening rice. As on your last
 trip from the monastery, you are traveling with a horse and cart, full
 of the food and supplies you will need for your journey.

 It is up to you and Lu Jin to set the tone for this mission. The trip
 to Kuei Xian takes three days at a steady pace.

 A: Three days is fast enough; the situation is urgent, but unlikely to
 get much worse in three days' time.
 B: This mission is urgent, and we have been trained to move quickly. We
 can make the trip in two days.

>a
 with your fellow students. How will you use it?

 A: Continue planning strategy with Lu Jin.
 B: Stop early at night so I can run the students through training
 drills, keeping our fighting skills fresh.
 C: Consult the stars at night, watching for signs that will make clear
 the most beneficial path.
 D: Focus on the well-being of the students, keeping them entertained
 with other tales of travel.

>a
 negotiation, believing that the bandits can be reasoned with. What is
 your strategy in facing the bandits?

 A: Fight them, and show them the power of the Order of the Peach Tree.
 B: Devise a clever plan to stop their raids, but avoid a direct
 conflict.
 C: Attempt to contact their leaders and negotiate some form of peace.

>c
 would like to support them, but given your orders, you cannot do it
 openly. Perhaps you can persuade them to take their business elsewhere
 and find a way to help them against the foreigners in the future.

 On the third morning of your journey, the terrain has shifted from
 valley fields to the true foothills of the Yellow Mountains. Forests
 have closed around you, mostly pine, fir, and cedar here, though you
 know there are also bamboo forests near Kuei Xian. You are nearing what
 could be enemy territory, depending on how far out the raiders have
 roamed.

 As you walk, you hear a human noise in the distance?it sounds as though
 it might be sobbing, or perhaps low voices. It is too far to tell.

 What do you do?

 A: Send one of the students to scout ahead to discover the source of
 the noise as we continue toward Kuei Xian. The scout can catch up.
 B: Send one of the students to scout ahead and wait for him to return.
 C: Scout ahead on my own.

>c
 though you walk on rice paper. The sound is definitely sobbing, and you
 see a flash of red through the fir trees. A few steps closer and you
 see that a beautiful young woman is kneeling in the fir needles,
 crying. She wears a heavy qipao, a long dress with a high neckline made
 of thick, brocaded fabric. Her hair is woven up into an elaborate
 headpiece, clearly marking her as a member of the aristocracy.

 She looks up when she sees you approach, and, were it not for the
 tears, she could be a model for a painting: her narrow face and
 close-set eyes, her thin eyebrows and high cheekbones are the ideal of
 courtly beauty. But there are tears, and her lovely face is contorted
 in pain.

 A: I go to help her at once!
 B: This seems highly suspicious to me. I approach, but carefully.
 C: It is helpless women like her that make it so difficult for women
 like me to get respect. Let her figure it out herself.

>b
 "Oh, kind monk, could you help me?" she calls, her voice as lovely as
 the rest of her appearance. "My foot has become caught in a trap!"

 A: I go help her immediately.
 B: This still seems suspicious. I step closer, but do not yet agree to
 help.

>b

 She grins, though there is real pain on her face, and after the first
 flash of amusement, it turns into a grimace. "A fox trap, I'm afraid."

 Behind the woman, seven fox tails flare to life, revealing that this is
 no true woman at all. She is a huli jing, a mischievous fox spirit that
 delights particularly in tormenting monks.

 "Why should I help you?" you ask.

 She shakes her head. "Why is it always the wise ones who find me in
 such a predicament?" she asks, mostly to herself. "I will make it worth
 your while, monk. I can offer you unimaginable pleasure," she says with
 a coy wink that, upon the slight shift of her body, becomes a wince. "I
 promise that we fox spirits are exceedingly creative."

 A: Unimaginable pleasure? Sounds good to me.
 B: I want information about the bandits.
 C: Her favor. It can never hurt to have a spirit on my side.

>c
 have earned my good will by freeing me now."

 You open the trap and the huli jing snatches her leg back, as though
 afraid the trap will bite her again. She stands and bows to you.

 "My name is Feng," she says. "And I am in your debt. We will meet
 again."

 You make your way back to the road and your companions with no further
 trouble.

 Baijiang Bridge is a huge, stone structure that spans the width of the
 Baijiang River. From this side, you can see the large black turtle of a
 mountain that rises over Kuei Xian. Now that you are here, it is time
 to put your plan into action. Are you ready to act on your plan?

 A: I stand by my first plan.
 B: I want to rethink my options.

>a
 countrymen, people who have fallen on hard times due to the incursion
 of foreigners in the Middle Kingdom. Though you may not agree with
 their tactics, you want to help their cause. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.
 C: Ask around the village and, based on local gossip, intuit the most
 probable location for their camp.

>c
 direction, but the people of Kuei Xian leave you at a loss. You'll have
 to try another way. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.

>a
 bandit camp without being noticed. You and your fellow students walk
 into the camp calmly, as though you belong, despite your sengfu
 clothing marking you as monks of the Order of the Peach Tree. The
 bandits, most of whom do seem to come from humble backgrounds, have no
 idea what to do with you. Because you do not appear to be hostile, they
 seem unwilling to confront you.

 Finally, a large woman of middle age, her hair wrapped in the same blue
 turban you see throughout the camp, stands in front of your group.

 "What is your business?" she asks sternly. You imagine that this is the
 same tone of voice she uses when she suspects her children of having
 gotten into mischief.

 "We'd like to speak to your leader," Lu Jin says politely.

 The woman looks suspicious, but after a moment, she nods, then beckons
 for you to follow. In the center of the camp?which gives the appearance
 of being a tent city, something quickly dismantled to move?there is a
 large fire, at which sit a number of men and women talking seriously.

 "Deng Ping," the woman says loudly, and the tallest of the men, wearing
 clothing slightly better cared for than that of his peers, stands.
 "Order of the Peach Tree to see you."

 Deng Ping approaches suspiciously and waits for you to speak.

 A: Begin by offering our condolences for the misfortune that brought
 the bandits here.
 B: Get straight to business: explain that we were instructed to oust
 them, but that we'd rather see whether negotiation is possible.
 C: Try to strike some fear into their hearts: we may sympathize with
 their plight, but the next group will not.

>a
 "Do not offer us pity, monk," he spits. "You may as well be in league
 with the laowai, for all that you do to prevent their incursions. Every
 day that passes, their power and influence grows, and it is time for
 someone to stand against them. If that means us, so be it."

 There are cheers from among the bandits, and the atmosphere that was
 previously uncertain has taken on a distinct air of hostility.

 "I intended no dishonor," you begin, but Deng Ping scoffs.

 "Tell your masters?tell the Son of Heaven himself?that we will do
 whatever it takes to rid the laowai from our land." He steps forward,
 aiming a finger at your chest. "Whatever it takes."

 A: I cannot refuse a challenge to my honor?and neither can he.
 Challenge him to a fight.
 B: Accept defeat. Clearly he will not listen to me.
 C: Find out what we can offer them to change their minds.

>a
 him to fight a member of the order, one on one. If he loses, he is
 bound by honor to leave Kuei Xian alone.

 In order to avoid losing face among the bandits, Deng Ping accepts your
 challenge. Who will fight for the Order?

 A: Me.
 B: Lu Jin.

>a
 and quick, and though he has little skill, a well-timed hammerstrike to
 your head sets your ears ringing and brings you to your knees.

 Your fellow students collect you and load you into the cart with the
 supplies, preparing for the long trip back to the monastery.

 Lu Jin, however, tells you of his decision to stay with the bandits. "I
 believe I can help their cause," he explains. "Balance must return to
 the Middle Kingdom."

 A: Try to persuade Lu Jin not to go.
 B: Support Lu Jin's choice.
 C: Good riddance.

>b
 while you work from inside the Order.

 You are sure you will meet each other again.

 As you return to the monastery, morale among the students is at an
 utter low. Not only did one of your number abandon the Order
 completely, but you have nothing to show for your efforts.

 Your first real mission on behalf of the Order is a failure.

 After you tell Abbot Bao and Master Shen about what has happened, they
 consult the heavens to determine the best course of action. Ultimately,
 the Order does nothing further?and despite your failure, attacks by the
 bandits near Kuei Xian die down for a time. Though this initially seems
 like good news, Governor Rong has heard about the events that
 transpired from his informants?likely village gossips, who may have
 heard it from the bandits themselves. No credit will be given to the
 Order of the Peach Tree for the temporary peace.

 Master Shen admits to you that he and the abbot had planned to test you
 to become a full member of the Order had your mission been a success.
 Now, you will have to prove yourself again through humble service and
 continued training before you can become a monk, rather than the senior
 student.

 Compared to your dishonor at the hands of the bandits, the wait to test
 is a small setback?but what if it means that you will not be the one
 chosen to consult the Dragon Sage? You will have to work even harder to
 prove that you are worthy before the dragon reappears in the Middle
 Kingdom.

 There are rumors upon rumors of what happens during the final test that
 separates students from monks. You have heard that it involves tracking
 and defeating a wild tiger. Some say that you must face and disperse a
 hungry ghost. Still others say that the true final test is a measure of
 the spirit and the ability of the student to achieve a perfect moment
 of inner peace.

 Given the scars you have seen on the fully accepted monks, if the test
 is about finding inner peace, inner peace leaves marks.

 Master Shen leads you to the inner temple of the monastery. He walks in
 a relaxed fashion, leaning on his staff, as though he is merely
 observing the growth of the peach tree, not leading you to where your
 fate will be decided.

 How are you feeling about this test?

 A: I am eager to begin. My training has prepared me well.
 B: I am nervous. I want to do well, but I fear failure.
 C: I am calm. This is a moment, and I exist within it.

>c
 its weight: the old master's strength, his wisdom, and his confidence
 in you all flow through that simple touch.

 He stops in front of the huge doors to the inner temple, carved with
 intricate scroll work and the shapes of the five animals: dragon,
 tiger, snake, crane, and leopard. After a short moment of waiting, he
 gestures with his staff for you to push the doors open. As you do, he
 falls into step next to you and you enter the chamber. The inner temple
 is humble: a small chamber with candles lining three of the four walls.
 Above the candles are paintings and sculptures of the spiritual animals
 of kung fu and the immortals. On the far wall, on a raised shelf above
 the flame, is a Buddha statue, one hand resting in his lap, the other
 raised in blessing.

 Abbot Bao stands in front of the last candle, lighting it from his own
 small candle. Once the room is lit, he blows his candle out.

 "Liu Meili, you have been deemed worthy of the final test to join the
 Order of the Peach Tree," says the abbot as he turns to you. "Do you
 accept this honor, ready to face the challenges before you and take on
 the role of monk?"

 A: "I accept."
 B: "I do not feel ready."

>a
 shallower, as befitting a teacher to a student.

 "There are three challenges in the test to become a member of the
 Order," Abbot Bao explains. "You must complete two of the three
 successfully. Consider your options wisely, as only one failure can be
 forgiven."

 "Part of the test is identifying your weaknesses and being honest about
 your strengths," Master Shen says quietly. "Know yourself, student, and
 you will triumph."

 "The three challenges are these," Abbot Bao continues. "The first is
 the Dashanmen, a challenge of your combat skills against the monks of
 the Order. You will enter a dark chamber, and you must cross from one
 side to the other while being attacked."

 Master Shen chuckles. "In the old days, we fought to the death. Too
 messy. Now we stop attacking as soon as you are unconscious."

 This commentary does not serve to give you confidence.

 "For the second challenge, you must carry an urn filled with hot coals
 from the monastery down to the river. There, you may release the urn
 and bathe your arms in the cold water."

 The distance from the monastery to the river is short enough when not
 carrying an urn, but it will certainly feel longer with burning metal
 on your arms. That certainly explains some of the scars you have seen
 on the monks of the Order!

 "For the third challenge, you must retrieve the Scroll of Destiny from
 behind Bingdian Waterfall, and learn the lesson it holds," Abbot Bao
 finishes.

 "Don't worry," says Master Shen, "it is stored in a waterproof scroll
 case. You'll be able to read it."

 Which task would you like to undertake first?

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will carry the urn of coals.
 C: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 been cleared of students, and only a handful of monks are here to
 witness the beginning of your challenge. Just inside the gates, a
 brazier is lit, and over it is suspended a large urn, full of burning
 coals. Aligned to the cardinal directions are four animals: to the
 north is the tortoise; south, the phoenix; east, the dragon; and west,
 the tiger.

 While the metalwork is beautiful, it mostly looks hot.

 You must carry the urn with your forearms from the monastery to the
 river below. How will you face this challenge?

 A: I grit my teeth and carry the heavy load through sheer will.
 B: I will not rely on strength alone, but will use the heat to further
 forge my chi.

>b
 fire, opposed by the tortoise, a creature of water. The dragon, which
 represents the element of wood, is opposed by the tiger, which
 represents metal. Although you are tempted to focus on the idea that
 the fire has the potential to consume wood and metal, but is opposed by
 water and only lends strength back to its own element, you know that
 there is still a fifth element to consider.

 There is void, the element of the center. Your own mind must be empty
 in order for the chi to flow through you, carrying the strength?and
 freedom?necessary to lift the urn. You still your mind, breathe, and
 reach for the urn.

 You feel the pain along your forearms, and it is excruciating?but it
 washes over you, just a part of the moment. With each breath, you let
 the moment flow and change, accepting it without worrying over past or
 future, or even holding a thought. Your feet know this path; they have
 walked it hundreds of times on the simple task of fetching water. You
 allow them to carry you.

 You breathe. You exist. The moment comes and passes, and another
 follows on its heels.

 You reach the river almost before you realize you are there, and you
 calmly lower the urn into the water. It hisses with steam, bathing you
 in hot air as your arms enter the cold stream. You realize that your
 body feels the shock of the contrast, but you only observe this as
 another part of the moment before letting it, too, go. When you return
 to the monastery, you show the monks your new scars to prove that you
 have withstood the challenge. You have passed. What scars do you bear?

 A: The dragon and the tiger.
 B: The tortoise and the phoenix.

>a

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 where the dry land becomes marsh, Bingdian Waterfall is on the far side
 of the karst mountain. The trip there is not a long one, but it is
 hard, as there is no path. As you begin your ascent, you find some goat
 paths to travel, delaying the true climb until the waterfall is in
 sight.

 You feel the mist of the waterfall before you see it. Despite the warm
 weather, the air takes on a clammy chill?the water here is always
 freezing, nearly ice cold. You rub your hands together and approach the
 waterfall. It cascades down the side of the mountain into a pool of
 unknown depth. It falls from perhaps ten times your own height, and
 somewhere in that length there is a cave or a hole behind it, in which
 lies the Scroll of Destiny.

 How will you attempt to find the scroll?

 A: Climb the mountain next to the waterfall until I see it.
 B: Use my chi to propel me up the side of the mountain, like a lizard.
 C: Make observations from below to calculate the most likely location
 for the scroll.
 D: Fashion an impromptu spear from the available wood and throw it
 until it hits an indentation.

>b
 on your climb. From there, you are able to scramble up the side of the
 mountain by keeping your energy focused, and by borrowing some of the
 grounded nature of the mountain you climb. You can sense from the
 energy of the mountain where the indentation that stores the scroll
 will be, and you dart your hand into the cold water, drawing the scroll
 case out as quickly as if you were pulling a fish from a stream. You
 turn and jump, using your chi to float to the ground. You sit down next
 to the pool, the roar of the waterfall drowning out any other noise,
 and open the scroll case. Inside is what feels like an ancient scroll,
 marked with diagrams that show various techniques you have learned
 while studying at the Order of the Peach Tree. But though there are
 many images to contemplate, most of the scroll is empty. There do not
 seem to be any great secrets contained in the writing here. You do not
 see a hidden final technique explained, nor a clue about how to bring
 balance to the Middle Kingdom.

 What do you wish to do?

 A: Meditate on the scroll. An answer will come.
 B: Analyze the scroll and puzzle out its meaning.

>b
 detail, identifying the moves. You begin to get stiff from your
 proximity to the cold waterfall, so you get up to stretch, going
 through the movements on the page as they are written. You pause from
 one technique to the next, studying the diagram and noticing how small
 details have changed from when the scroll was written to when your
 teachers shared these techniques. You realize that the closer you get
 to the blank part of the scroll, the closer the techniques are?in their
 details?to what you have learned.

 Excited by this discovery, you sit down next to the scroll again. You
 realize that, though the change is only barely discernible, the ink is
 ever so slightly darker toward the blank section. It occurs to you that
 the final technique shown on the scroll is one you have heard a story
 about: one of your teachers, a snake master, changed the way the
 technique was taught to the students in order to give them a lesson on
 pressure points. The strikes he added to the technique are clearly
 marked.

 There are no secrets on the scroll, but there is a legacy of detail.
 You consider the techniques you have adjusted in your own studies. What
 will you teach to future students in the Order? How will your art be
 applied to wushu as you make it your own?

 You discover that the scroll case has a small compartment that contains
 a brush and a block of dry ink. You take out your bowl?something a monk
 must always carry, you have been told?and add water to the ink. In your
 finest calligraphy, you add a technique to the scroll, allowing it to
 dry before you return it to its secret location behind the waterfall.

 When you return to the monastery, Abbot Bao notices the ink smudges in
 your bowl and offers you a smile and a bow. You have passed this test.
 Which task will you undertake next?

 A: I am satisfied with my performance on my tasks and conclude the
 test.
 B: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.

>b
 the room. For an instant, you think the peach tree statue glows with
 reflected light, but then all is dark.

 Master Shen's hand tightens on your shoulder, escorting you to the far
 side of the chamber. You can hear the soft sounds of people entering
 the room, though with the quiet treads the monks have practiced, it is
 impossible to tell how many. Certainly more than the sounds you hear
 would indicate.

 Finally, Master Shen turns you around. "Remember your training," he
 says, before he, too disappears in the darkness.

 You wait, your stance relaxed as you have been taught, until you are
 told to begin?or until the first attack comes.

 How will you face this challenge?

 A: I have faith in my fighting skills. I face my opponents with
 confidence?they are as blind as I am.
 B: The challenge is to get from one side of the room to the other, but
 the path was never specified. I weave through the room, confusing my
 opponents.

>b
 complimented on your ability to think outside of the boundaries of the
 exercise. That skill is useful here. You begin by crouching low to the
 ground, and you feel where the strike of your first opponent would have
 been had you remained in place. You strike to a pressure point on the
 back of his leg, collapsing it under him, as you move away from the
 center of the room and through the crowd of opponents.

 The monks realize your strategy quickly, so you have to keep shifting
 your pattern of movement. The intention is to be where the strikes are
 not. You get into a low stance and circle walk. You move, changing
 directions and heights of your stance with syncopation so that your
 foes never catch you in a rhythm. You launch a flurry of palm strikes
 as you feel the body of a monk ahead of you. The next monk, however,
 you just evade, moving around him the moment that your earlier foe
 counterstrikes your former position.

 It is not easy, but you focus on the strategies you have learned for
 keeping your opponents off balance, leading them into each other and
 falling away from their attacks. Occasionally, a strike catches you,
 but your steps never falter, and you keep moving. You can feel that
 what you are doing borders on what some would call the supernatural
 talents of the monks; you know you are drawing on your own knowledge of
 strategy and the principles of bagua?the eight diagrams that represent
 the nature of the universe.

 You can sense how close you are coming to the far side of the room,
 where Abbot Bao awaits. You reach the wall, then circle back into the
 throng, gliding out of the way of the monks turning to attack you. You
 reach out and place your hand on the warm wood of the door.

 "Finish," says Abbot Bao. He makes a final attack?a high strike aimed
 at your throat?but you back against the door and push it open, shooting
 yourself backward out of his reach. Light floods the room, dazzling you
 and the monks. As your eyes adjust, you realize that they are all
 bowing to you. Clearly your teachers were correct: you were ready for
 this test, and you have passed. With your successes behind you, you are
 welcomed once again into the inner temple. The candles are all lit, and
 the monks who reside at the monastery offer you their oaths of
 brotherhood. The Order of the Peach Tree is now your family, and you
 are one step closer to getting to ask a question of the Dragon Sage.

 Your first few years as a monk feel little different from your last
 year as a senior student. Though you now have a greater leadership
 role, and an official ranking as a teacher with the students, much
 continues on as it had before. You work at the monastery, taking care
 of the things required of all who live there to maintain the daily
 workings of the Order. You spar with the monks and continue to learn
 the intricacies of wushu. You oversee the newest applicants as they
 prove their worth by accomplishing the most menial chores. You do not
 miss those days from your own apprenticeship.

 The seasons change. The peach tree blossoms and bears fruit, then shows
 its naked branches until spring returns. The strength of the Blue
 Scarves Rebellion grows as the foreigners maintain and further develop
 their presence in the Middle Kingdom. Still, the Emperor shows no
 intention of changing their role at his court, or defending the people
 of the Middle Kingdom against the foreigners' encroachment upon lands
 they have farmed for generations.

 No further threats call for the attention of the Order of the Peach
 Tree, however, and Abbot Bao has not become involved with the quarrel
 between the rebels and the Emperor on either side. The monks are
 divided in their opinions of the world's events: some strongly support
 the Emperor, others profess that it is not the Order's role to get
 involved in events of the world, and a few mention their concerns for
 the common people without ever fully defying the Son of Heaven.

 Do you involve yourself in these conversations?

 A: I support the Emperor. He is the Son of Heaven and clearly knows
 what's best for the Empire.
 B: I agree that the Middle Kingdom is out of balance with the Heavens,
 but do not openly question the Emperor.
 C: I am not concerned with such worldly matters when I strive toward
 Enlightenment.

>b
 position, but openly admitting doubt in the Son of Heaven is both
 unwise and dangerous. But if the choice is saying nothing or giving up
 your path to the Dragon Sage and joining the rebellion like Lu
 Jin?well, you know what you will choose.

 One day in late summer, the third year after your test, Master Shen
 asks to speak with you beneath the peach tree. When you arrive, the old
 master is dozing off beneath the tree, his staff leaning next to him.
 You approach quietly, but as soon as you are within range of Master
 Shen's staff, it shoots out to tap your ankle, suddenly in his gnarled
 but quick hand. His eyes remain closed.

 "This ankle feels like it belongs to Liu Meili," he says with a grin.
 He opens one eye. "Ah, good. If it had been Kai Lo bringing a late
 afternoon snack to the decrepit old man, that would have been an
 embarrassing mistake."

 Master Shen pats the ground beside him in a gesture for you to sit. It
 is oddly informal for one who served as your teacher for so long.

 "Why did you wish to speak with me, Master?" you ask.

 "Maybe I enjoy the company of my young students in my old age," Master
 Shen says gruffly. He taps your foot with the end of his staff. "You
 may be a monk now, but I still concern myself with your education."

 How do you respond to this?

 A: I am learning much from teaching the students and continuing to spar
 with the monks.
 B: I admit that I fear my own art is stagnating.
 C: I tell him that I miss the challenge of real combat.

>b
 to learn outside these walls, Liu Meili." Master Shen raises his staff
 and knocks twice on one of the peach tree's branches. Two peaches
 tumble down, and you catch them both, handing one to the old master
 when he reaches for it. He takes a bite of juicy peach, savoring it,
 before continuing.

 "It is traditional for members of the Order to spend some time away
 from the monastery after they become monks," he explains. "For some it
 is a time of wandering, living only on the kindness others drop into
 their begging bowls. For others, it is a chance to become embroiled in
 the matters of the Middle Kingdom. Abbot Bao suggested that for you,
 actually, and was planning to send you to Xiaonanhai, but I think that
 perhaps the capital is not the place for you now."

 You are surprised that Abbot Bao would think to send you to the capital
 of the Middle Kingdom?and that Master Shen has objected to the abbot's
 plans.

 "I think you would gain a greater benefit from studying under an old
 teacher of mine."

 "Of yours, Master?" you ask, trying to imagine a teacher of Master
 Shen's that would still be walking, let alone alive.

 He raps his staff against your ankle again, clearly guessing your
 thoughts. "I recommend that you seek out Master Zhuge in the Yellow
 Mountains. Zhuge is an old hermit?a true recluse?but crafty as a
 dragon."

 In fact, you have heard of Master Zhuge, whom some call the Veiled
 Dragon. Stories say that Master Zhuge has followed the path to
 immortality, though whether this was through alchemy, devout living, or
 the mystical arts of the bedchamber is the subject of much debate. No
 one knows how old he is or the full extent of his abilities, but people
 say he can blow on water to change the direction of its current, heal
 the sick at a distance, and take on the shape of any object. He also
 writes very fine poetry.

 "Zhuge lives in the mountains above Kuei Xian," Master Shen continues.
 He pulls a scroll out of his sengfu and hands it to you. It is a map of
 that section of the Yellow Mountains, incredibly detailed. A hermitage
 is marked.

 Master Shen stands, slowly, hiding the quick reactions you know he is
 capable of. "I suggest you take a present," he says, and knocks the
 bough of the peach tree with his staff again. A pile of peaches falls
 into your lap. "Go. Learn. I will see you in a few years, if I am still
 around. And if you survive."

 What gift will you take with you?

 A: Peaches. If Master Shen suggested them, they must be a good idea.
 B: I take a cutting from the peach tree, which will eventually produce
 its own peaches.
 C: I take the time to copy one of the scrolls from the temple library
 before I leave.

>b
 monk. You carefully take a cutting, wrapping the base in a wet cloth to
 prepare it for travel. Then you return to your room to pack your
 remaining things. You leave from the monastery on a beautiful, sunny
 day to begin your journey to the Yellow Mountains. It has been years
 since you traveled this road, and the journey alone is very different
 from one with seventeen companions. By the time you reach Baijiang
 Bridge, the weather has started to turn, and a summer squall hits just
 as you arrive in Kuei Xian. You sit in the tea house for a few hours
 until the skies clear, then begin your ascent into the mountains.

 You are hardly out of sight of town when you see a young woman on the
 road ahead of you, pacing and looking quite distraught. She is dressed
 in humble clothes, bedraggled from the recent storm, but despite the
 smudged dirt on her face and the disarray of her hair, it is clear that
 she is beautiful. A heavy pack lies near her by the side of the road.
 She spots you and the worry on her face eases.

 "Thank the heavens," she says, then looks down and bows in deference,
 despite the fact that she clearly intends to address you without
 waiting for you?of higher social rank?to speak first. "Honored monk,
 forgive my boldness, but I am in need of aid. I was traveling toward
 Kuei Xian when the storm hit, and my ox startled at the thunder and
 bolted off the road. Could you help me?"

 A: I don't have the time or inclination to help a peasant.
 B: I can spare a little time to help a poor woman.
 C: This woman seems very familiar?she reminds me of a certain fox
 spirit I met the last time I traveled this way.

>b
 mud where an ox might have charged off the road and into the woods. The
 trees are not terribly dense, but the terrain is uneven, and you could
 see how a woman without your training might be concerned about bandits
 or worse?particularly given the problems Kuei Xian has had in the past.

 "I'm afraid so," she answers. "I did start to go after him." She
 gestures down to her mud-caked boots and skirt. "My pack was too heavy
 to let me navigate the mud, and I didn't want to go too far into the
 woods. I wish I could be of use!" Suddenly, her face brightens. "I
 know! If you went after my ox, I could watch your pack for you. That
 way you wouldn't be weighed down!"

 A: What a thoughtful suggestion. I could manage the pack, but it would
 be kind to make her feel useful.
 B: It's kind?if a little suspicious?of her to offer, but I can manage
 my pack AND hers.
 C: Ah ha! She is a bandit! I want nothing more to do with this woman.

>load kungfu

 The noise of battle is distracting, and it takes you almost too long to
 realize that the warning was shouted to you. An outlaw wearing a blue
 turban is charging toward you, his longspear leveled at your heart.
 What will you do?

 A: Stand firm, blocking the spear away at the last moment and slashing
 twin tiger claws across his face.
 B: Pounce toward him at the last moment, springing like a leopard, and
 bring an elbow down on his head.
 C: Dart off to the side, balancing on one leg like a crane before
 delivering a swift kick to his knee.
 D: Weave hypnotically in my stance, and when he strikes, I am no longer
 there; I launch a series of quick, snakelike strikes to the pressure
 points in his exposed rib cage.
 E: Make a series of flashy moves that draw his target toward my right
 side, then move to the left, delivering a reiken strike to the right
 side of his head as he passes by.
 F: Remain still, my hands low at the chi center of my body, and at the
 moment he would hit me, circle his spear away and shift myself away
 from the strike.

>go down
 injured side. He looks suddently exhausted, courtesy of the disruption
 in his chi that your knowledge of the mystical Snake technique allowed.

 With your opponent deterred, but not out of the fight, how do you
 follow up your attack?

 A: Use a palm heel strike under the chin to drive his head backwards,
 tearing down with a tiger claw on his face as he falls.
 B: Drive into him with a series of fast leopard punches down the center
 of his body until he falls to the ground.
 C: Take his leg out from under him with a sweeping straight kick,
 delivering a wing strike to his neck at the same moment, graceful as a
 crane.
 D: With my fingers tight like a snake's head, strike out at his face
 and neck in a complex pattern of several hits that impact on nerve
 points, disabling him.
 E: Feign a low kick to the knee, and when he moves the spear shaft down
 to block, shoot a dragon tooth strike?my fingers separated in a V?into
 his eyes before sweeping him from behind.
 F: His death would be senseless and against the Buddha nature; pivot
 around behind him and lock him in a sleeper hold.

>go down
 chi, drop him to the ground, unconscious. He'll be feeling that when he
 wakes up.

 The outlaws continue toward you and your fellow students, flashes of
 blue catching your eye against the greens and browns of the marsh
 surrounding your path. It is hard to imagine that only moments ago, the
 nine of you were making your way back to the monastery of the Order of
 the Peach Tree, students on the simple assignment of escorting a
 wagonload of supplies home.

 The students have mostly remained on the path, where their footing is
 more certain, but the outlaws appear to have little trouble navigating
 the wetlands. While they fight like untrained peasants, numbers are
 definitely on their side.

 It's time to get serious. Drawing on the training you received before
 entering the Order of the Peach Tree, you prepare your next attack. How
 will you fight?

 A: Draw my sword. This blade was forged by the most expert smiths in
 the Middle Kingdom, designed specifically to be used with the Celestial
 Sword style, taught only to the Imperial Family.
 B: Unhitch the horse from the cart of supplies. He is a mean beast?not
 the fine mare I trained on at my father's estate?but few monks could
 master a horse from as honorable a family as mine. I draw my blade and
 prepare to charge.
 C: Draw on my chi, as well the energy in the world around me. I can
 sense the life energies of my fellow students and the approaching
 outlaws.
 D: Release the bindings that secure my longspear to my back. It is only
 one of the many weapons I have mastered in my wanderings, and it is a
 good choice to keep the outlaws at bay.
 E: Why change? The style my masters at the Order of the Peach Tree are
 teaching me is a superior one, and I am eager to prove the worth of my
 unarmed style in battle.

>c
 what the uninformed consider "magic." But you know to be your power to
 be from the energies of the universe, which are at your beck and call.
 You also know that the perception of your abilities can be used against
 your enemies?and one day, you hope it will inspire your allies. For
 now, the other students shy away from you, except for Lu Jin, your
 primary rival for the place of senior student, who watches you with a
 wary eye.

 The battle that follows is hectic; the outlaws have little in the way
 of skill, but they make up for it in passion. They are determined to
 have your supplies, despite the clear skill shown by you and your
 fellow students. Though you are focused on keeping them from trying to
 kill you, you notice as you disable your opponents that they are
 skinny, likely the result of being poorly fed. You also note that a
 number of the outlaws are women.

 Does that surprise you?

 A: Yes. Fighting is the realm of warriors, and the role of the warrior
 falls to the men.
 B: No. Outlaws have always bucked convention; why bother following
 social rules?
 C: Yes, but it is nice to know that I am not alone in questioning
 traditional roles.
 D: No. I am used to fighting side by side among men and women
 accomplished in the way of battle.

>go down
 Luckily for you, the Order of the Peach Tree feels similarly. Are you a
 man or a woman?

 A: I am a man.
 B: I am a woman.

>b

 A: Yin.
 B: Meili.
 C: Yan.
 D: None of these is my name.

>b

 And what is your family name?

 A: Liu.
 B: Wong.
 C: Cao.
 D: None of these is my family name.

>a

 The bandits are quickly losing their resolve to steal your wagon; they
 still have numbers on their side, but many have fallen, wounded or
 dead, at your feet. You hear the far-off sound of a whistle, and the
 bandits begin to disengage, quickly fading back into the marsh. Though
 you and your fellow students have done a formidable job of holding off
 the bandits, you see that your fellows have taken some injuries as
 well.

 What do you do?

 A: Retreat back to the monastery, so that my fellow students can have
 their wounds treated immediately.
 B: Question one of the wounded bandits about the attack.
 C: Pursue the bandits into the marsh.

>b
 that this scrawny bandit is no more than thirteen. Malnourished and
 weak, it is amazing he is not dead from the beating he received.

 A: I feel admiration for his bravery, in spite of his conditions. I
 tell him he fought well.
 B: I feel pity for this boy who has turned to thievery to survive.
 C: I am furious that this urchin attacked us.

>a
 despite his pain. "I must fight well," he says, "because no one else
 will fight for me." He says it almost like a mantra. You ask your
 questions, and the boy gives you answers he appears to believe are
 true: the supplies you carry were targeted because they would be useful
 to the bandits, not because the outlaws wish to offend the Order of the
 Peach Tree. He does not know how many bandits there are, but he says
 that almost all that he knows were farmers, forced out of their homes
 by the foreigners who have been encroaching on the Middle Kingdom.

 A: I let the boy and the other wounded bandits go with no intention of
 bringing them to the law. They are people suffering from circumstances
 beyond their control.
 B: I let the boy go and warn him and the other bandits that they must
 cease their crimes against the Empire. I will make sure that their
 banditry is reported to the local magistrate, but will hope they repent
 of their crimes.

>a

 Lu Jin takes a deep breath, as though deciding whether or not to share
 a thought, before he says, "It wasn't like this before the foreigners
 came. With them eating up resources?and with the Emperor standing by
 while his people starve and lose their land to these invaders?the
 people have no hope."

 Lu Jin's openness is surprising, but what he says amounts to treason.
 Questioning the Emperor's will so openly will certainly lead him to
 trouble.

 Does that trouble start with you?

 A: How dare he question the Emperor! I challenge him immediately.
 B: I agree with Lu Jin, but I respond noncommittally. Just because he
 is asking for trouble by speaking his mind does not mean I will risk my
 neck.
 C: I agree with Lu Jin and am glad to find someone to discuss the
 Empire's problems with.
 D: I do nothing. I am not interested in politics.

>a
 students, who watch you anxiously. "Perhaps another time."

 His refusal to fight puts you in an awkward position; if he refused to
 defend himself, you could be thrown out of the Order of the Peach Tree
 for attacking a fellow student without provocation.

 A: He insulted the Emperor. I cannot delay in seeking retribution.
 B: I wait, but I do not forget.

>b

 As you walk back to the monastery, you take a moment to consider the
 path that has brought you here. As a child, you were told stories of
 the Order of the Peach Tree, a monastery where many great warriors were
 trained. But it was not just the combat skills that enticed you. Every
 hundred years, one member of the Order of the Peach Tree is given the
 honor of consulting the Dragon Sage. That monk may ask a single
 question of the wise dragon. It is only thirty years until the next
 monk of the Order of the Peach Tree is selected, and you are determined
 to be the order's representative to the dragon.

 What question drives you toward this goal?

 A: I know I have much to learn of combat, but I am convinced that the
 Dragon Sage holds the key to greatness beyond what I can learn from
 mortal teachers. I plan to ask, "How can I become the greatest warrior
 in the world?"
 B: The strife I see in the Middle Kingdom?so recently reiterated by my
 encounter with the bandits?disturbs me greatly. I wish to see balance
 restored to the Middle Kingdom, so that the Emperor is once again in
 alignment with the Heavens. I will ask, "How can the Empire return to
 Heaven's Favor?"
 C: I am more concerned with esoteric knowledge than worldly issues. I
 wish to ask, "What is the first question?"
 D: My question is simple: "Why do kites fly?"

>b
 Emperor back on the path of Heaven, it is the Dragon Sage.

 A few days after the conflict with the outlaws in the marsh, Abbot Bao
 Ho sends for you to meet him beneath the peach tree. The tree itself is
 ancient: you have been told that most peach trees live, at most, fifty
 years, but this one has grown wide around the trunk and gnarled in the
 branches. Despite its age, it continues to produce fruit. Some say that
 this is the peach tree after which the monastery was named, a true
 immortal tree in the breed of trees that represents immortality. Others
 believe it to be a descendant of the original peach tree, the result of
 careful cultivation by the monks who teach you.

 What do you think?

 A: It must be immortal.
 B: If it is grown from the cuttings of earlier trees, the continuation
 of its line makes it immortal despite its many incarnations.
 C: The tree is clearly not immortal; only the superstitious and
 uneducated would believe so.
 D: I haven't given it much thought.
 E: I don't care.

>b

 The peach tree's branches extend over a reflection pool. It is normally
 a very peaceful spot, but now the atmosphere is tense. Abbot Bao stands
 there with Master Shen, the oldest teacher in the monastery, at his
 side, and the two men wear identical expressions of concern.

 Just as you arrive, Lu Jin approaches from the other side. He appears
 as surprised to see you as you are to see him.

 "Greetings, my senior students," Abbot Bao says in greeting.

 Lu Jin bows. "Do you have training for us today, masters?"

 Master Shen chuckles. "Always so eager for more, Lu Jin? As I recall,
 at our last bout between the senior students, Liu Meili gave you a very
 fine black eye."

 Lu Jin bares his teeth at you in a smile that is neither humble nor
 friendly.

 "Unfortunately, my students, this is no simple matter of training,"
 Abbot Bao says. "Or, perhaps it is, but not of our usual devising. You
 told us of your experience with the bandits along the road to the
 Order, and I am afraid it is becoming an all too common experience in
 these interesting times. Too many people of the Middle Kingdom are
 turning to thieving and banditry to make their ends meet, and too many
 honest folk are made to suffer."

 Master Shen grunts, and you think you hear him mutter something about a
 distinct lack of honest folk, but it is unclear.

 The abbot continues: "Because you have some experience, and because we
 feel it will be a good test of your readiness to fully join the order,
 we have chosen the two of you to lead a group of students to the
 village of Kuei Xian, across the Baijiang Bridge, to solve the trouble
 locals are having with the bandits."

 Lu Jin blanches momentarily, but your teachers do not seem to notice.

 How do you respond to this mission?

 A: It is an honor to be chosen, even if I must share leadership with Lu
 Jin. I agree to set off at once.
 B: I can't wait to try my skills against real opponents again.
 C: Lu Jin's hesitation is an opportunity for me. I volunteer to take
 the team alone.
 D: I am not really interested in this interruption to my training.

>c
 rival's hesitation.

 "I feel it would be best to have both of you on this task," he says
 slowly. "If you are uncertain?"

 "No," says Lu Jin. "I am ready to do what the Order asks of me."

 Both Master Shen and Abbot Bao watch Lu Jin with some concern for
 another moment. Even though you will both be going together, it seems
 you have successfully undermined his position.

 There are actually fewer details than you would have expected for this
 mission. Neither Abbot Bao nor Master Shen knows how many bandits are
 present near Kuei Xian. They do know that the center of activity seems
 to be at Baijiang Bridge, an old stone bridge that remains from the
 years of the Sun Dynasty, when an army marched across it five horses at
 a time, or so legends say. Kuei Xian, which sits in the shadow of a
 huge, turtlelike karst hill in the foothills of the Yellow Mountains,
 is a small village, but with important enough history?and pleasant
 enough weather?that the governor of the province keeps his summer home
 there.

 Governor Rong is disinclined to ask the Emperor to help combat the
 problem directly. (You gather from Master Shen's muttered commentary
 that this would make it look as though he cannot solve the problems of
 his own district.) Instead, he has asked the Order of the Peach Tree
 for aid, and given the importance of the trade that flows across the
 Baijiang Bridge, and the order's dedication as protectors of the people
 of the Middle Kingdom, the abbot has agreed.

 Of course, should you and Lu Jin fail to quell the problem, more
 important resources than students will have to be expended, either by
 the Order or by the Emperor. This would bring dishonor to everyone:
 you, the order, Governor Rong, and possibly the Emperor himself in the
 face of the foreigners at his court.

 Abbot Bao tells you the names of the students he expects to accompany
 you. Several of them were present when the bandits attacked. You are to
 ready your equipment and leave in the morning.

 A: I seek out Lu Jin to discuss this mission.
 B: I go to my room to prepare for morning.

>a
 co-leader with you?but you're equally unenthusiastic about working with
 him. Still, as Master Shen would say, better to be prepared.

 You look over a map of the Baijiang Bridge, and, unsurprisingly, you
 conflict about every possible approach.

 Exasperated, Lu Jin finally says, "We may as well just ask them to
 leave, for all the good we're going to do."

 A: We could try negotiation. If we can find the leader, maybe we can
 work something out.
 B: What a ridiculous idea.

>a

 "Maybe we can," he agrees noncommittally.

 You discuss tactics for a little while longer, with greater success
 than previously, and you decide to turn in, to make sure you have
 prepared and rested enough for morning.

 The Order of the Peach Tree, though farther from the Yellow Mountains
 than Kuei Xian, is nestled among karst mountains that increase as you
 travel west toward the Baijiang River. The road is a well-traveled one,
 a drier route than the road you so recently traversed through the
 wetlands south of the monastery. Despite the traditional sengfu monk
 garb that you and your fellow students wear?the high boots, pants, and
 one-sleeved robe, tied with a sash?which marks you as members of the
 Order, you are given no more notice than the other travelers you
 encounter. There are eighteen of you, total: you and Lu Jin each have a
 team of eight students, for good luck. Each team is nine, a symbol of
 permanence, and of synergy with the heavens.

 Does the numerology comfort you?

 A: Of course. When embarking upon matters like this, I am glad for any
 numerical advantage.
 B: No. The outcome will be determined by greater skill, not by numbers.
 C: We are all one team, making us eighteen, which is neither lucky nor
 unlucky. We will make our own fate.
 D: More superstitious nonsense.
 E: I hadn't noticed the numbers before.

>b
 the side of the bandits. You pass a number of merchants with carts
 drawn by water buffalo, messengers and warriors on horseback, and
 travelers walking along the road with bundles on their backs. It is a
 fine day: the sky is blue, the clouds are wisps, and the summer air is
 thick with the smell of blossoms and ripening rice. As on your last
 trip from the monastery, you are traveling with a horse and cart, full
 of the food and supplies you will need for your journey.

 It is up to you and Lu Jin to set the tone for this mission. The trip
 to Kuei Xian takes three days at a steady pace.

 A: Three days is fast enough; the situation is urgent, but unlikely to
 get much worse in three days' time.
 B: This mission is urgent, and we have been trained to move quickly. We
 can make the trip in two days.

>a
 with your fellow students. How will you use it?

 A: Continue planning strategy with Lu Jin.
 B: Stop early at night so I can run the students through training
 drills, keeping our fighting skills fresh.
 C: Consult the stars at night, watching for signs that will make clear
 the most beneficial path.
 D: Focus on the well-being of the students, keeping them entertained
 with other tales of travel.

>a
 negotiation, believing that the bandits can be reasoned with. What is
 your strategy in facing the bandits?

 A: Fight them, and show them the power of the Order of the Peach Tree.
 B: Devise a clever plan to stop their raids, but avoid a direct
 conflict.
 C: Attempt to contact their leaders and negotiate some form of peace.

>c
 would like to support them, but given your orders, you cannot do it
 openly. Perhaps you can persuade them to take their business elsewhere
 and find a way to help them against the foreigners in the future.

 On the third morning of your journey, the terrain has shifted from
 valley fields to the true foothills of the Yellow Mountains. Forests
 have closed around you, mostly pine, fir, and cedar here, though you
 know there are also bamboo forests near Kuei Xian. You are nearing what
 could be enemy territory, depending on how far out the raiders have
 roamed.

 As you walk, you hear a human noise in the distance?it sounds as though
 it might be sobbing, or perhaps low voices. It is too far to tell.

 What do you do?

 A: Send one of the students to scout ahead to discover the source of
 the noise as we continue toward Kuei Xian. The scout can catch up.
 B: Send one of the students to scout ahead and wait for him to return.
 C: Scout ahead on my own.

>c
 though you walk on rice paper. The sound is definitely sobbing, and you
 see a flash of red through the fir trees. A few steps closer and you
 see that a beautiful young woman is kneeling in the fir needles,
 crying. She wears a heavy qipao, a long dress with a high neckline made
 of thick, brocaded fabric. Her hair is woven up into an elaborate
 headpiece, clearly marking her as a member of the aristocracy.

 She looks up when she sees you approach, and, were it not for the
 tears, she could be a model for a painting: her narrow face and
 close-set eyes, her thin eyebrows and high cheekbones are the ideal of
 courtly beauty. But there are tears, and her lovely face is contorted
 in pain.

 A: I go to help her at once!
 B: This seems highly suspicious to me. I approach, but carefully.
 C: It is helpless women like her that make it so difficult for women
 like me to get respect. Let her figure it out herself.

>b
 "Oh, kind monk, could you help me?" she calls, her voice as lovely as
 the rest of her appearance. "My foot has become caught in a trap!"

 A: I go help her immediately.
 B: This still seems suspicious. I step closer, but do not yet agree to
 help.

>b

 She grins, though there is real pain on her face, and after the first
 flash of amusement, it turns into a grimace. "A fox trap, I'm afraid."

 Behind the woman, seven fox tails flare to life, revealing that this is
 no true woman at all. She is a huli jing, a mischievous fox spirit that
 delights particularly in tormenting monks.

 "Why should I help you?" you ask.

 She shakes her head. "Why is it always the wise ones who find me in
 such a predicament?" she asks, mostly to herself. "I will make it worth
 your while, monk. I can offer you unimaginable pleasure," she says with
 a coy wink that, upon the slight shift of her body, becomes a wince. "I
 promise that we fox spirits are exceedingly creative."

 A: Unimaginable pleasure? Sounds good to me.
 B: I want information about the bandits.
 C: Her favor. It can never hurt to have a spirit on my side.

>c
 have earned my good will by freeing me now."

 You open the trap and the huli jing snatches her leg back, as though
 afraid the trap will bite her again. She stands and bows to you.

 "My name is Feng," she says. "And I am in your debt. We will meet
 again."

 You make your way back to the road and your companions with no further
 trouble.

 Baijiang Bridge is a huge, stone structure that spans the width of the
 Baijiang River. From this side, you can see the large black turtle of a
 mountain that rises over Kuei Xian. Now that you are here, it is time
 to put your plan into action. Are you ready to act on your plan?

 A: I stand by my first plan.
 B: I want to rethink my options.

>a
 countrymen, people who have fallen on hard times due to the incursion
 of foreigners in the Middle Kingdom. Though you may not agree with
 their tactics, you want to help their cause. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.
 C: Ask around the village and, based on local gossip, intuit the most
 probable location for their camp.

>c
 direction, but the people of Kuei Xian leave you at a loss. You'll have
 to try another way. How will you make contact?

 A: Scout the woods in pairs until we find it.
 B: Wait until the bandits make a raid across the Baijiang Bridge and
 follow them back.

>a
 bandit camp without being noticed. You and your fellow students walk
 into the camp calmly, as though you belong, despite your sengfu
 clothing marking you as monks of the Order of the Peach Tree. The
 bandits, most of whom do seem to come from humble backgrounds, have no
 idea what to do with you. Because you do not appear to be hostile, they
 seem unwilling to confront you.

 Finally, a large woman of middle age, her hair wrapped in the same blue
 turban you see throughout the camp, stands in front of your group.

 "What is your business?" she asks sternly. You imagine that this is the
 same tone of voice she uses when she suspects her children of having
 gotten into mischief.

 "We'd like to speak to your leader," Lu Jin says politely.

 The woman looks suspicious, but after a moment, she nods, then beckons
 for you to follow. In the center of the camp?which gives the appearance
 of being a tent city, something quickly dismantled to move?there is a
 large fire, at which sit a number of men and women talking seriously.

 "Deng Ping," the woman says loudly, and the tallest of the men, wearing
 clothing slightly better cared for than that of his peers, stands.
 "Order of the Peach Tree to see you."

 Deng Ping approaches suspiciously and waits for you to speak.

 A: Begin by offering our condolences for the misfortune that brought
 the bandits here.
 B: Get straight to business: explain that we were instructed to oust
 them, but that we'd rather see whether negotiation is possible.
 C: Try to strike some fear into their hearts: we may sympathize with
 their plight, but the next group will not.

>a
 "Do not offer us pity, monk," he spits. "You may as well be in league
 with the laowai, for all that you do to prevent their incursions. Every
 day that passes, their power and influence grows, and it is time for
 someone to stand against them. If that means us, so be it."

 There are cheers from among the bandits, and the atmosphere that was
 previously uncertain has taken on a distinct air of hostility.

 "I intended no dishonor," you begin, but Deng Ping scoffs.

 "Tell your masters?tell the Son of Heaven himself?that we will do
 whatever it takes to rid the laowai from our land." He steps forward,
 aiming a finger at your chest. "Whatever it takes."

 A: I cannot refuse a challenge to my honor?and neither can he.
 Challenge him to a fight.
 B: Accept defeat. Clearly he will not listen to me.
 C: Find out what we can offer them to change their minds.

>a
 him to fight a member of the order, one on one. If he loses, he is
 bound by honor to leave Kuei Xian alone.

 In order to avoid losing face among the bandits, Deng Ping accepts your
 challenge. Who will fight for the Order?

 A: Me.
 B: Lu Jin.

>a
 and quick, and though he has little skill, a well-timed hammerstrike to
 your head sets your ears ringing and brings you to your knees.

 Your fellow students collect you and load you into the cart with the
 supplies, preparing for the long trip back to the monastery.

 Lu Jin, however, tells you of his decision to stay with the bandits. "I
 believe I can help their cause," he explains. "Balance must return to
 the Middle Kingdom."

 A: Try to persuade Lu Jin not to go.
 B: Support Lu Jin's choice.
 C: Good riddance.

>b
 while you work from inside the Order.

 You are sure you will meet each other again.

 As you return to the monastery, morale among the students is at an
 utter low. Not only did one of your number abandon the Order
 completely, but you have nothing to show for your efforts.

 Your first real mission on behalf of the Order is a failure.

 After you tell Abbot Bao and Master Shen about what has happened, they
 consult the heavens to determine the best course of action. Ultimately,
 the Order does nothing further?and despite your failure, attacks by the
 bandits near Kuei Xian die down for a time. Though this initially seems
 like good news, Governor Rong has heard about the events that
 transpired from his informants?likely village gossips, who may have
 heard it from the bandits themselves. No credit will be given to the
 Order of the Peach Tree for the temporary peace.

 Master Shen admits to you that he and the abbot had planned to test you
 to become a full member of the Order had your mission been a success.
 Now, you will have to prove yourself again through humble service and
 continued training before you can become a monk, rather than the senior
 student.

 Compared to your dishonor at the hands of the bandits, the wait to test
 is a small setback?but what if it means that you will not be the one
 chosen to consult the Dragon Sage? You will have to work even harder to
 prove that you are worthy before the dragon reappears in the Middle
 Kingdom.

 There are rumors upon rumors of what happens during the final test that
 separates students from monks. You have heard that it involves tracking
 and defeating a wild tiger. Some say that you must face and disperse a
 hungry ghost. Still others say that the true final test is a measure of
 the spirit and the ability of the student to achieve a perfect moment
 of inner peace.

 Given the scars you have seen on the fully accepted monks, if the test
 is about finding inner peace, inner peace leaves marks.

 Master Shen leads you to the inner temple of the monastery. He walks in
 a relaxed fashion, leaning on his staff, as though he is merely
 observing the growth of the peach tree, not leading you to where your
 fate will be decided.

 How are you feeling about this test?

 A: I am eager to begin. My training has prepared me well.
 B: I am nervous. I want to do well, but I fear failure.
 C: I am calm. This is a moment, and I exist within it.

>c
 its weight: the old master's strength, his wisdom, and his confidence
 in you all flow through that simple touch.

 He stops in front of the huge doors to the inner temple, carved with
 intricate scroll work and the shapes of the five animals: dragon,
 tiger, snake, crane, and leopard. After a short moment of waiting, he
 gestures with his staff for you to push the doors open. As you do, he
 falls into step next to you and you enter the chamber. The inner temple
 is humble: a small chamber with candles lining three of the four walls.
 Above the candles are paintings and sculptures of the spiritual animals
 of kung fu and the immortals. On the far wall, on a raised shelf above
 the flame, is a Buddha statue, one hand resting in his lap, the other
 raised in blessing.

 Abbot Bao stands in front of the last candle, lighting it from his own
 small candle. Once the room is lit, he blows his candle out.

 "Liu Meili, you have been deemed worthy of the final test to join the
 Order of the Peach Tree," says the abbot as he turns to you. "Do you
 accept this honor, ready to face the challenges before you and take on
 the role of monk?"

 A: "I accept."
 B: "I do not feel ready."

>a
 shallower, as befitting a teacher to a student.

 "There are three challenges in the test to become a member of the
 Order," Abbot Bao explains. "You must complete two of the three
 successfully. Consider your options wisely, as only one failure can be
 forgiven."

 "Part of the test is identifying your weaknesses and being honest about
 your strengths," Master Shen says quietly. "Know yourself, student, and
 you will triumph."

 "The three challenges are these," Abbot Bao continues. "The first is
 the Dashanmen, a challenge of your combat skills against the monks of
 the Order. You will enter a dark chamber, and you must cross from one
 side to the other while being attacked."

 Master Shen chuckles. "In the old days, we fought to the death. Too
 messy. Now we stop attacking as soon as you are unconscious."

 This commentary does not serve to give you confidence.

 "For the second challenge, you must carry an urn filled with hot coals
 from the monastery down to the river. There, you may release the urn
 and bathe your arms in the cold water."

 The distance from the monastery to the river is short enough when not
 carrying an urn, but it will certainly feel longer with burning metal
 on your arms. That certainly explains some of the scars you have seen
 on the monks of the Order!

 "For the third challenge, you must retrieve the Scroll of Destiny from
 behind Bingdian Waterfall, and learn the lesson it holds," Abbot Bao
 finishes.

 "Don't worry," says Master Shen, "it is stored in a waterproof scroll
 case. You'll be able to read it."

 Which task would you like to undertake first?

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will carry the urn of coals.
 C: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 been cleared of students, and only a handful of monks are here to
 witness the beginning of your challenge. Just inside the gates, a
 brazier is lit, and over it is suspended a large urn, full of burning
 coals. Aligned to the cardinal directions are four animals: to the
 north is the tortoise; south, the phoenix; east, the dragon; and west,
 the tiger.

 While the metalwork is beautiful, it mostly looks hot.

 You must carry the urn with your forearms from the monastery to the
 river below. How will you face this challenge?

 A: I grit my teeth and carry the heavy load through sheer will.
 B: I will not rely on strength alone, but will use the heat to further
 forge my chi.

>b
 fire, opposed by the tortoise, a creature of water. The dragon, which
 represents the element of wood, is opposed by the tiger, which
 represents metal. Although you are tempted to focus on the idea that
 the fire has the potential to consume wood and metal, but is opposed by
 water and only lends strength back to its own element, you know that
 there is still a fifth element to consider.

 There is void, the element of the center. Your own mind must be empty
 in order for the chi to flow through you, carrying the strength?and
 freedom?necessary to lift the urn. You still your mind, breathe, and
 reach for the urn.

 You feel the pain along your forearms, and it is excruciating?but it
 washes over you, just a part of the moment. With each breath, you let
 the moment flow and change, accepting it without worrying over past or
 future, or even holding a thought. Your feet know this path; they have
 walked it hundreds of times on the simple task of fetching water. You
 allow them to carry you.

 You breathe. You exist. The moment comes and passes, and another
 follows on its heels.

 You reach the river almost before you realize you are there, and you
 calmly lower the urn into the water. It hisses with steam, bathing you
 in hot air as your arms enter the cold stream. You realize that your
 body feels the shock of the contrast, but you only observe this as
 another part of the moment before letting it, too, go. When you return
 to the monastery, you show the monks your new scars to prove that you
 have withstood the challenge. You have passed. What scars do you bear?

 A: The dragon and the tiger.
 B: The tortoise and the phoenix.

>a

 A: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.
 B: I will retrieve the Scroll of Destiny.

>b
 where the dry land becomes marsh, Bingdian Waterfall is on the far side
 of the karst mountain. The trip there is not a long one, but it is
 hard, as there is no path. As you begin your ascent, you find some goat
 paths to travel, delaying the true climb until the waterfall is in
 sight.

 You feel the mist of the waterfall before you see it. Despite the warm
 weather, the air takes on a clammy chill?the water here is always
 freezing, nearly ice cold. You rub your hands together and approach the
 waterfall. It cascades down the side of the mountain into a pool of
 unknown depth. It falls from perhaps ten times your own height, and
 somewhere in that length there is a cave or a hole behind it, in which
 lies the Scroll of Destiny.

 How will you attempt to find the scroll?

 A: Climb the mountain next to the waterfall until I see it.
 B: Use my chi to propel me up the side of the mountain, like a lizard.
 C: Make observations from below to calculate the most likely location
 for the scroll.
 D: Fashion an impromptu spear from the available wood and throw it
 until it hits an indentation.

>b
 on your climb. From there, you are able to scramble up the side of the
 mountain by keeping your energy focused, and by borrowing some of the
 grounded nature of the mountain you climb. You can sense from the
 energy of the mountain where the indentation that stores the scroll
 will be, and you dart your hand into the cold water, drawing the scroll
 case out as quickly as if you were pulling a fish from a stream. You
 turn and jump, using your chi to float to the ground. You sit down next
 to the pool, the roar of the waterfall drowning out any other noise,
 and open the scroll case. Inside is what feels like an ancient scroll,
 marked with diagrams that show various techniques you have learned
 while studying at the Order of the Peach Tree. But though there are
 many images to contemplate, most of the scroll is empty. There do not
 seem to be any great secrets contained in the writing here. You do not
 see a hidden final technique explained, nor a clue about how to bring
 balance to the Middle Kingdom.

 What do you wish to do?

 A: Meditate on the scroll. An answer will come.
 B: Analyze the scroll and puzzle out its meaning.

>b
 detail, identifying the moves. You begin to get stiff from your
 proximity to the cold waterfall, so you get up to stretch, going
 through the movements on the page as they are written. You pause from
 one technique to the next, studying the diagram and noticing how small
 details have changed from when the scroll was written to when your
 teachers shared these techniques. You realize that the closer you get
 to the blank part of the scroll, the closer the techniques are?in their
 details?to what you have learned.

 Excited by this discovery, you sit down next to the scroll again. You
 realize that, though the change is only barely discernible, the ink is
 ever so slightly darker toward the blank section. It occurs to you that
 the final technique shown on the scroll is one you have heard a story
 about: one of your teachers, a snake master, changed the way the
 technique was taught to the students in order to give them a lesson on
 pressure points. The strikes he added to the technique are clearly
 marked.

 There are no secrets on the scroll, but there is a legacy of detail.
 You consider the techniques you have adjusted in your own studies. What
 will you teach to future students in the Order? How will your art be
 applied to wushu as you make it your own?

 You discover that the scroll case has a small compartment that contains
 a brush and a block of dry ink. You take out your bowl?something a monk
 must always carry, you have been told?and add water to the ink. In your
 finest calligraphy, you add a technique to the scroll, allowing it to
 dry before you return it to its secret location behind the waterfall.

 When you return to the monastery, Abbot Bao notices the ink smudges in
 your bowl and offers you a smile and a bow. You have passed this test.
 Which task will you undertake next?

 A: I am satisfied with my performance on my tasks and conclude the
 test.
 B: I am confident I can fight my way through Dashanmen.

>b
 the room. For an instant, you think the peach tree statue glows with
 reflected light, but then all is dark.

 Master Shen's hand tightens on your shoulder, escorting you to the far
 side of the chamber. You can hear the soft sounds of people entering
 the room, though with the quiet treads the monks have practiced, it is
 impossible to tell how many. Certainly more than the sounds you hear
 would indicate.

 Finally, Master Shen turns you around. "Remember your training," he
 says, before he, too disappears in the darkness.

 You wait, your stance relaxed as you have been taught, until you are
 told to begin?or until the first attack comes.

 How will you face this challenge?

 A: I have faith in my fighting skills. I face my opponents with
 confidence?they are as blind as I am.
 B: The challenge is to get from one side of the room to the other, but
 the path was never specified. I weave through the room, confusing my
 opponents.

>b
 complimented on your ability to think outside of the boundaries of the
 exercise. That skill is useful here. You begin by crouching low to the
 ground, and you feel where the strike of your first opponent would have
 been had you remained in place. You strike to a pressure point on the
 back of his leg, collapsing it under him, as you move away from the
 center of the room and through the crowd of opponents.

 The monks realize your strategy quickly, so you have to keep shifting
 your pattern of movement. The intention is to be where the strikes are
 not. You get into a low stance and circle walk. You move, changing
 directions and heights of your stance with syncopation so that your
 foes never catch you in a rhythm. You launch a flurry of palm strikes
 as you feel the body of a monk ahead of you. The next monk, however,
 you just evade, moving around him the moment that your earlier foe
 counterstrikes your former position.

 It is not easy, but you focus on the strategies you have learned for
 keeping your opponents off balance, leading them into each other and
 falling away from their attacks. Occasionally, a strike catches you,
 but your steps never falter, and you keep moving. You can feel that
 what you are doing borders on what some would call the supernatural
 talents of the monks; you know you are drawing on your own knowledge of
 strategy and the principles of bagua?the eight diagrams that represent
 the nature of the universe.

 You can sense how close you are coming to the far side of the room,
 where Abbot Bao awaits. You reach the wall, then circle back into the
 throng, gliding out of the way of the monks turning to attack you. You
 reach out and place your hand on the warm wood of the door.

 "Finish," says Abbot Bao. He makes a final attack?a high strike aimed
 at your throat?but you back against the door and push it open, shooting
 yourself backward out of his reach. Light floods the room, dazzling you
 and the monks. As your eyes adjust, you realize that they are all
 bowing to you. Clearly your teachers were correct: you were ready for
 this test, and you have passed. With your successes behind you, you are
 welcomed once again into the inner temple. The candles are all lit, and
 the monks who reside at the monastery offer you their oaths of
 brotherhood. The Order of the Peach Tree is now your family, and you
 are one step closer to getting to ask a question of the Dragon Sage.

 Your first few years as a monk feel little different from your last
 year as a senior student. Though you now have a greater leadership
 role, and an official ranking as a teacher with the students, much
 continues on as it had before. You work at the monastery, taking care
 of the things required of all who live there to maintain the daily
 workings of the Order. You spar with the monks and continue to learn
 the intricacies of wushu. You oversee the newest applicants as they
 prove their worth by accomplishing the most menial chores. You do not
 miss those days from your own apprenticeship.

 The seasons change. The peach tree blossoms and bears fruit, then shows
 its naked branches until spring returns. The strength of the Blue
 Scarves Rebellion grows as the foreigners maintain and further develop
 their presence in the Middle Kingdom. Still, the Emperor shows no
 intention of changing their role at his court, or defending the people
 of the Middle Kingdom against the foreigners' encroachment upon lands
 they have farmed for generations.

 No further threats call for the attention of the Order of the Peach
 Tree, however, and Abbot Bao has not become involved with the quarrel
 between the rebels and the Emperor on either side. The monks are
 divided in their opinions of the world's events: some strongly support
 the Emperor, others profess that it is not the Order's role to get
 involved in events of the world, and a few mention their concerns for
 the common people without ever fully defying the Son of Heaven.

 Do you involve yourself in these conversations?

 A: I support the Emperor. He is the Son of Heaven and clearly knows
 what's best for the Empire.
 B: I agree that the Middle Kingdom is out of balance with the Heavens,
 but do not openly question the Emperor.
 C: I am not concerned with such worldly matters when I strive toward
 Enlightenment.

>b
 position, but openly admitting doubt in the Son of Heaven is both
 unwise and dangerous. But if the choice is saying nothing or giving up
 your path to the Dragon Sage and joining the rebellion like Lu
 Jin?well, you know what you will choose.

 One day in late summer, the third year after your test, Master Shen
 asks to speak with you beneath the peach tree. When you arrive, the old
 master is dozing off beneath the tree, his staff leaning next to him.
 You approach quietly, but as soon as you are within range of Master
 Shen's staff, it shoots out to tap your ankle, suddenly in his gnarled
 but quick hand. His eyes remain closed.

 "This ankle feels like it belongs to Liu Meili," he says with a grin.
 He opens one eye. "Ah, good. If it had been Kai Lo bringing a late
 afternoon snack to the decrepit old man, that would have been an
 embarrassing mistake."

 Master Shen pats the ground beside him in a gesture for you to sit. It
 is oddly informal for one who served as your teacher for so long.

 "Why did you wish to speak with me, Master?" you ask.

 "Maybe I enjoy the company of my young students in my old age," Master
 Shen says gruffly. He taps your foot with the end of his staff. "You
 may be a monk now, but I still concern myself with your education."

 How do you respond to this?

 A: I am learning much from teaching the students and continuing to spar
 with the monks.
 B: I admit that I fear my own art is stagnating.
 C: I tell him that I miss the challenge of real combat.

>b
 to learn outside these walls, Liu Meili." Master Shen raises his staff
 and knocks twice on one of the peach tree's branches. Two peaches
 tumble down, and you catch them both, handing one to the old master
 when he reaches for it. He takes a bite of juicy peach, savoring it,
 before continuing.

 "It is traditional for members of the Order to spend some time away
 from the monastery after they become monks," he explains. "For some it
 is a time of wandering, living only on the kindness others drop into
 their begging bowls. For others, it is a chance to become embroiled in
 the matters of the Middle Kingdom. Abbot Bao suggested that for you,
 actually, and was planning to send you to Xiaonanhai, but I think that
 perhaps the capital is not the place for you now."

 You are surprised that Abbot Bao would think to send you to the capital
 of the Middle Kingdom?and that Master Shen has objected to the abbot's
 plans.

 "I think you would gain a greater benefit from studying under an old
 teacher of mine."

 "Of yours, Master?" you ask, trying to imagine a teacher of Master
 Shen's that would still be walking, let alone alive.

 He raps his staff against your ankle again, clearly guessing your
 thoughts. "I recommend that you seek out Master Zhuge in the Yellow
 Mountains. Zhuge is an old hermit?a true recluse?but crafty as a
 dragon."

 In fact, you have heard of Master Zhuge, whom some call the Veiled
 Dragon. Stories say that Master Zhuge has followed the path to
 immortality, though whether this was through alchemy, devout living, or
 the mystical arts of the bedchamber is the subject of much debate. No
 one knows how old he is or the full extent of his abilities, but people
 say he can blow on water to change the direction of its current, heal
 the sick at a distance, and take on the shape of any object. He also
 writes very fine poetry.

 "Zhuge lives in the mountains above Kuei Xian," Master Shen continues.
 He pulls a scroll out of his sengfu and hands it to you. It is a map of
 that section of the Yellow Mountains, incredibly detailed. A hermitage
 is marked.

 Master Shen stands, slowly, hiding the quick reactions you know he is
 capable of. "I suggest you take a present," he says, and knocks the
 bough of the peach tree with his staff again. A pile of peaches falls
 into your lap. "Go. Learn. I will see you in a few years, if I am still
 around. And if you survive."

 What gift will you take with you?

 A: Peaches. If Master Shen suggested them, they must be a good idea.
 B: I take a cutting from the peach tree, which will eventually produce
 its own peaches.
 C: I take the time to copy one of the scrolls from the temple library
 before I leave.

>b
 monk. You carefully take a cutting, wrapping the base in a wet cloth to
 prepare it for travel. Then you return to your room to pack your
 remaining things. You leave from the monastery on a beautiful, sunny
 day to begin your journey to the Yellow Mountains. It has been years
 since you traveled this road, and the journey alone is very different
 from one with seventeen companions. By the time you reach Baijiang
 Bridge, the weather has started to turn, and a summer squall hits just
 as you arrive in Kuei Xian. You sit in the tea house for a few hours
 until the skies clear, then begin your ascent into the mountains.

 You are hardly out of sight of town when you see a young woman on the
 road ahead of you, pacing and looking quite distraught. She is dressed
 in humble clothes, bedraggled from the recent storm, but despite the
 smudged dirt on her face and the disarray of her hair, it is clear that
 she is beautiful. A heavy pack lies near her by the side of the road.
 She spots you and the worry on her face eases.

 "Thank the heavens," she says, then looks down and bows in deference,
 despite the fact that she clearly intends to address you without
 waiting for you?of higher social rank?to speak first. "Honored monk,
 forgive my boldness, but I am in need of aid. I was traveling toward
 Kuei Xian when the storm hit, and my ox startled at the thunder and
 bolted off the road. Could you help me?"

 A: I don't have the time or inclination to help a peasant.
 B: I can spare a little time to help a poor woman.
 C: This woman seems very familiar?she reminds me of a certain fox
 spirit I met the last time I traveled this way.

>c

 The woman beams. "You remembered me!"

 As though you were likely to forget an encounter with a fox spirit.

 The huli jing gestures to her pack, letting her seven tails peek out
 from beneath the humble peasant clothing she wears as a disguise. "I
 thought perhaps you might like an additional option to present to
 Master Zhuge. No tricks, I promise." She gives you a wink, then bounds
 off into the woods, changing to her fox form as she goes. When you meet
 with Master Zhuge, will you offer the fox spirit's gift?

 A: I will present my original gift to Master Zhuge.
 B: I will present the fox spirit's pack to Master Zhuge.
 C: I will offer both gifts.

>c
 hut where Master Shen's map said it would be. You rap on the door,
 expecting it to open with hospitality, even at this late hour and even
 from a legendary hermit. What you do not expect is for a wizened and
 wiry old woman, white hair dangling in a long braid down her back, to
 open the door with distaste.

 "I am not interested in visitors," she snaps. "Fend for yourself in the
 mountains. Consult the stars. Maybe you'll learn something."

 A: Explain I am here from the Order of the Peach Tree to see Master
 Zhuge, relying on the Order's reputation to bring goodwill.
 B: Demand that this insolent old woman introduce me to Master Zhuge,
 whom I have traveled so far to see.
 C: Apologize for the late hour and ask for hospitality to be granted to
 a humble monk.
 D: Bow deeply. The way this woman moves, despite her age, reveals her
 skill. I address her: "Master Zhuge."

>go down
 legends you have learned about Zhuge the Immortal, the Veiled Dragon.
 But though all the stories you know refer to Zhuge as a man, you can
 sense the gravitas this woman has.

 The old woman beams. "It has been at least fifteen years since someone
 identified me so quickly," she says. "Either you are a remarkably
 clever monk, or I am getting less crafty in my old age." She holds the
 door open. "I choose to believe it is the former. Please, come inside."
 The hut is larger on the inside than it appeared on the outside, and
 though it is sparely furnished, it is comfortable. The main room has a
 small hearth; a kettle for tea water is currently suspended over it.
 One wall is filled with racks of scrolls. Another has weapons of all
 sizes and shapes suspended from it. Two paper doors hide additional
 rooms.

 Master Zhuge offers you tea.

 A: Accept the tea and drink it as Master Zhuge drinks it.
 B: Take the tea cup and contemplate the tea, considering its qualities.
 C: Decline the tea.

>a
 to Master Zhuge. She takes what you offer with little expression, and
 you cannot tell whether you have impressed the master or not. Master
 Zhuge asks about your travels and the training you have already had.
 She listens, revealing little with her expression, as you explain your
 background.

 "I have decided to accept you, provisionally, as my apprentice," Master
 Zhuge says. "I can teach you any number of things, if you are willing
 to learn them."

 What do you hope to learn from Master Zhuge?

 A: I want to improve my fighting.
 B: I want to learn the magic the Zhuge of legend is said to practice.
 C: I need to work on my determination.
 D: I am looking forward to studying strategy under the Veiled Dragon,
 who is said to have been responsible for the defeat of three armies at
 Hongcao Pass.
 E: I really want to learn the art of poetry.

>go east
 ever sought her out as a poetry instructor. Still, she is eager to find
 another person with whom she can share her love of poetry.

 But rather than putting your own words together, or even studying the
 words of the masters, Master Zhuge divides your day into two parts:
 practicing calligraphy and meditating in a clearing near the hut.
 Neither of these things feels much like poetry when you begin.

 A: I do not understand Master Zhuge's techniques and have taken to
 making up poems in my head without her.
 B: Clearly, the art of calligraphy is poetry's physical expression. The
 words must also appear beautiful.
 C: Sitting in nature is clearly about poetry. Poetry is about
 observation as much as it is about creation.

>c
 as you walk home together, she speaks to you in what you soon recognize
 as extemporaneous verse. As you reply, you find that your words, too,
 are becoming more poetic. One evening as you are practicing
 calligraphy, Master Zhuge returns to the hut from an errand, and you
 realize that she is carrying wine skins. You have never seen Master
 Zhuge drink alcohol?in fact, you have actually seen her ingest little
 other than tea and herbal compounds, which you have heard is one of the
 ways a person may become immortal?so this comes as a surprise.

 "Are we having company?" you ask.

 "Yes," Master Zhuge says, setting a third chair at the table where you
 drink tea together. "A friend of mine will be staying with us this
 evening, and I suspect he will want plenty to drink while he is here."
 She gestures to the several skins. "You may have some as well, of
 course."

 You are curious about her guest, but she says no more, vanishing into
 her room until, hours later, there is a knock on the door of her hut.
 She goes to the door, a far cry from the crotchety old woman who
 answered for you the first night you met her: she has piled her hair
 into an elaborate coif and she wears a beautifully brocaded qipao,
 looking every bit like a noble woman rather than a hermit.

 "Miao!" a man's voice booms when she opens the door, and it sounds
 clear to you that he has already had a bit to drink. "It has been far
 too long!"

 "Then you should visit more often, you old fool," Master Zhuge says,
 but her voice is playful, and she ushers her guest inside.

 He is a huge man who wears a long robe with wide sleeves, and a tunic
 draped on top of it. A waist-sash surrounds his enormous girth, and a
 scholar's cap crowns his head. He sees you and starts in surprise. "And
 who is this, Miao? A new student?"

 "Pai, this is Liu Meili, who is studying poetry with me. Liu Meili,
 allow me to present Li Pai."

 The large man bellows a laugh. "A poet! I hope Miao has actually let
 you write something down, young pupil. She is notorious for keeping
 everything in her head."

 A: I bow politely to Master Zhuge's guest.
 B: I laugh and admit that I have not yet written any poetry down while
 studying under Master Zhuge, but insist that she is a fine teacher.
 C: I am intimidated by this man and scared stiff at the notion of
 discussing poetry with him.
 D: I bow deeply to the poet. I recognize his name from the legends; he,
 like Master Zhuge, is considered an immortal.

>b
 not the only one, Pai." "Let us speak of poetry! But first, Miao, tell
 me that you have brought me wine."

 "Of course," says Master Zhuge, handing her guest the first of, you
 suspect, many wine skins to be drunk that night.

 Li Pai begins to launch into his own poetry, and Master Zhuge responds
 with her own, some that you recognize from the work of hers that you
 have already heard and read, and some that sounds extemporaneous, but
 no less sophisticated. After you have listened to the exchanges for
 some time, it is clear that, in order to participate in this evening,
 you will need to contribute some poetry of your own.

 A: I am happy just to be in the presence of two such gifted poets. I
 will let it all sink in.
 B: I am confident that I will be able to create extemporaneous poetry.
 C: I am uncertain about creating my own poetry, but I rely on my memory
 of older poems to add to the conversation.

>b
 clearing to call up appropriate imagery to reflect the emotional tone
 of the conversation. And as the poets accept your contributions, your
 confidence grows. Soon, you are spouting poetry as though you have been
 doing it all your life.

 Many wine skins later and far after the moon has set, Master Zhuge
 announces that it is time for the evening to come to an end. Your two
 fellow poets wish you a good night, and you dream in verse.

 Li Pai stays for several more days before returning to the road, and
 you bask in the poetry of the household. You continue your practice of
 calligraphy and meditation while the poet is at the house?he sleeps the
 majority of the day and does not miss your presence?and spend the
 evenings engaging with the two masters of the art, honing your skill.
 When Li Pai eventually has to leave, he encourages you to write down
 some of your poems, despite Master Zhuge's training.

 To your surprise, Master Zhuge agrees. "I think it is time that you
 commit some works to paper," she says after her friend has gone. "But I
 think we can find some time for things other than poetry as well, my
 student, if there are other things you wish to learn."

 A: I want to improve my fighting.
 B: I want to learn the magic the Zhuge of legend is said to practice.
 C: I need to work on my determination.
 D: I am looking forward to studying strategy under the Veiled Dragon,
 who is said to have been responsible for the defeat of three armies at
 Hongcao Pass.

>go down
 stories as a child, and you have studied the different tellings of that
 event at every opportunity. Master Zhuge was on the side of Hong Wei,
 the most capable general among the three armies, who fought on behalf
 of the Imperial Family against a rebelling warlord and the horse-riding
 savages of the western plains. Between General Hong and Master Zhuge,
 the battle was decisive, and Hongcao Pass was named after the general,
 who became a trusted advisor to the Emperor.

 The story that Master Zhuge tells you surprises you: Zhuge knew that in
 order for the general's strategy to work, the army would need to double
 the number of drummers sending out the orders to the soldiers. In order
 to meet the army's need, Zhuge recruited a number of young women
 instrumentalists from a nearby village. Though General Hong was unsure
 about using untried women in the role, they were vital to his ruse: he
 needed the drum calls to disorient his enemies and keep the opposing
 armies from learning his location until it was too late for them to
 prevent his attack. Zhuge snuck the women up into the pass into secure
 locations, where their drum calls would echo and multiply, thus adding
 further confusion to General Hong's original plan. Many other details
 played into the battle, of course?including an east wind Master Zhuge
 summoned, which caused the banners of the horse barbarians to flutter
 chaotically in the winding pass and further disorient the enemy?but
 history's record of the numbers is entirely accurate.

 As you discuss old battles, day after day, Master Zhuge insists that
 you play go. The board game, played on a grid where stones of opposing
 colors?black and white?are used to attempt to surround their opponent's
 pieces, distracts you from the tales of Master Zhuge's important
 strategic decisions.

 Do you question her technique?

 A: The distraction is unwelcome. I would rather pore over maps of
 Master Zhuge's campaigns.
 B: The multitasking is difficult, but I suspect it is part of the
 exercise.
 C: I love go! I could play this game all day.

>b
 retaining both in your head without being distracted, is certainly a
 skill that requires a quick mind. It also has the added benefit of
 causing you to focus more closely on Master Zhuge's reactions and
 expressions. You feel you are beginning to learn how to read her
 emotions more clearly, and your insight into her expressions aids both
 your game and your understanding of her campaign decisions. One
 evening, during which you are comparing two accounts of the campaign
 during the Border War fought between Emperor Da Xiaoten?the grandfather
 of current Emperor Da Gaozu, the Son of Heaven?and the barbarians of
 the western plains, Master Zhuge sets up the go board, as has become
 your custom. This time, however, she sets three chairs around the
 table.

 "Are we having company?" you ask.

 "In a manner of speaking," Master Zhuge says in her typical cryptic
 fashion.

 After arranging the board, Master Zhuge disappears into her room, then
 returns with a silk bag and heads outside. You follow, curious, and
 watch as she withdraws a bundle of small flags and arranges them in a
 circle. She begins to chant in a language that is only vaguely
 familiar?it sounds like a very old dialect of your own language, with a
 very different vocabulary?and, after a few moments, the ghost appears.
 At first he is only a shade, but as Master Zhuge's chanting continues,
 he resolves into a tall man wearing scale armor over a changshan. A red
 cloak is draped over his armor, and his helmet is decorated with an
 equally red feather plume. A well-shaped beard and mustache, flecked
 with gray, surround a mouth that breaks into a smile when he sees your
 master.

 "Zhuge Miao," he says, sounding like an echo of a once-booming voice.
 "Has it been long, my friend?"

 "Ages," Master Zhuge confirms, taking the ghost's hands in her own. "I
 have a go player to introduce you to while I tell you stories of the
 future."

 The man looks at you sharply.

 A: I bow, in deference to this old friend of my master's.
 B: I bow, but only slightly. Surely I have greater status than a ghost!
 C: I remain frozen in place, unsure how to greet a ghost.
 D: I bow, recognizing General Hong Wei from his description in the
 legends.

>go down
 bow. "I see you have recognized my old friend," Master Zhuge says
 warmly. "Wei, this is Liu Meili, my student. Liu Meili, I present to
 you General Hong Wei." "It is an honor," you say, and your admiration,
 honed by years of studying his feats in combat, is clear. The ghost
 laughs. "We will see what you say after I have defeated you at go!"

 Inside, Master Zhuge offers the ghost her usual seat. She begins to
 busy herself around the hut in a way that strikes you as more domestic
 than her typical fashion.

 "You may go first," says General Hong.

 What is your strategy?

 A: I play in silence, focused solely on the game, even though this will
 be construed as rudeness.
 B: I have been training with Master Zhuge to converse and play at the
 same time. I can handle the challenge.
 C: I study General Hong's expressions, trying to draw him into
 storytelling and conversation that will distract him from the game.

>c
 who?for the purposes of the evening at least?outranks you, to draw you
 into conversation. Once he begins to talk, you are free to ask
 questions. While you might be inclined to keep him engaged on topics
 from his own life, it is clear from the way he reacts to your questions
 and to comments from Master Zhuge that he is far more interested in
 current events. General Hong is dismayed by the foreign presence in the
 Middle Kingdom?after all, he spent years trying to keep out the
 horse-riding barbarians?but he is scrupulously polite regarding the
 Imperial Family. You tell him of your own campaign?small though it
 was?at Kuei Xian and ask what he would have done.

 The puzzle of the bandits?and what he would do to confront both them
 and the foreigners were he the current Imperial General?captivates him
 utterly. So utterly that he does not notice your command of the board,
 or how quickly you are surrounding his pieces. When he eventually
 realizes what has happened, he laughs.

 "Miao, your student has distracted me!" he complains good-naturedly.

 "Didn't you always tell me that distractions are an inevitable part of
 battle?" she asks, mischief clear in her voice.

 "So I did," he answers, finishing the game to his inevitable defeat.
 General Hong remains for conversation after the game, but eventually,
 Master Zhuge returns him to the celestial realms. It is clear that none
 of you really wanted the evening to end.

 When Master Zhuge returns with her silk bag, she looks at you, clearly
 pleased.

 "I believe we can have company more often," she says. "I also believe
 that you are ready for lessons on an additional topic. What else would
 you like to learn?"

 A: I want to improve my fighting.
 B: I want to learn the magic the Zhuge of legend is said to practice.
 C: I need to work on my determination.

>b
 would call magic. Master Zhuge explains that it is all a matter of
 understanding the flow of energy through the universe. When she says
 it, of course, it sounds simple. But your new training regimen is
 anything but. You find that magic is much less about action and much
 more about scholarship. Master Zhuge has you studying star charts,
 herbal encyclopedias, and books on anatomy. You imagine you can feel
 your muscles atrophy as you do nothing but read.

 Are you frustrated by all this book learning?

 A: I am fascinated by everything I am learning, and am eager to learn
 more.
 B: I love what I am learning, but wake before dawn in order to have
 time to go through my forms, so that my body remembers its fighting
 arts.
 C: I am sick of books and wish I were doing something with more action.

>b
 rather than get out another text on anatomy, she teaches you a form
 from the art of qigong, a style that emphasizes the energy points
 within the body, both for disabling foes and for healing friends. You
 add this to your morning practice. One day, Master Zhuge draws you away
 from the texts she has assigned you to study and takes you on a walk
 through the woods. Though you have been to the stream near her hut
 before, you have never noticed the gazebo to which she takes you. It is
 a rainy day, and the sound of the raindrops falling on the water adds
 volume to the stream's babble and the rustling of wind through the
 trees.

 "Today, we spar," she announces.

 She moves to the gazebo and sits on one of the benches inside. A figure
 comes out of the woods?a beautiful woman dressed in a thick brocaded
 qipao, who carries an erhu.

 After a moment, you recognize the woman as Feng, the huli jing. She
 draws her bow and sits demurely on the ground at the door of the
 gazebo, where she begins to play a haunting melody.

 A: I stand in a fighting stance, prepared to spar as Master Zhuge said.
 B: I sit in the gazebo and await further instruction.
 C: I sit in the gazebo and look at Master Zhuge until she meets my
 eyes.

>c
 you to a mind-to-mind battle. She locks eyes with you, and you begin.
 You see the scene clearly, everything moving in slow motion, from the
 rain hitting the water of the stream to the strings of the erhu
 vibrating. In your mind, Zhuge stands, her giant bladed spear?her guan
 dao?in her hand, lowered at you.

 A: In my mind, I also rise, focusing on the pressure points I have
 learned from the anatomy texts, and strike out open-handed.
 B: I visualize the battle the way I wish it to go, shaping the reality
 of the vision with my will.

>a
 Master Zhuge approaches you, you step to the side and strike out,
 targeting thirteen different points on her head and neck, determined to
 hit every one of them in a quick series of strikes.

 Your blows begin to land, but Master Zhuge, too, is a master of snake
 forms. Her guan dao vanishes and she meets you snake for snake. You
 shift to crane stance, evading her strikes and flying out of the way.

 The erhu plays, and your battle becomes a dance. You become so engaged
 in the patterns and movement that you cease to care who will win,
 living in this moment and letting go of worries of the future. You
 strike out, dance back, strike again, parry and counter. And still the
 erhu plays, and the rain glides across the surface of the stream.

 Master Zhuge spins away, grants you a broad smile, and bows. You return
 the bow, and discover that you are both still seated in the gazebo. The
 erhu vibrates with the last note of the song. "Well done," says Master
 Zhuge.

 After you have studied with Zhuge Miao for two years, your teacher once
 again asks you to sit with her for tea. "I have decided to go away for
 a time," she announces. "I have been in touch with Master Shen at the
 Order of the Peach Tree, and I understand that you are to remain in the
 Kuei Xian region. I would offer you my humble home," she says with a
 gesture around the room, "but I am afraid it is not quite the same when
 I am not here."

 You have noticed strange properties of the building?the way it seems to
 hold more than it should, that furniture seems to move out of Master
 Zhuge's way, that the windows darken against the sun or brighten on
 cloudy days?and are unsurprised that it, like Master Zhuge, is more
 than natural.

 "I have arranged for you to have a small house on the edge of Kuei
 Xian," she continues. "It should have enough space for you to continue
 your training, as well as live in comfort. My friend Feng will see to
 it that you have everything that you need." She sees your expression of
 surprise and continues with a smile. "Feng is a huli jing?a fox
 spirit?but she has been my trusted companion for many years. She will
 not take you down the foxhole unless you either wish it or become very,
 very foolish."

 Clearly Master Zhuge is unaware of your previous interactions with the
 fox spirit?which, you suppose, is just as well.

 Master Zhuge puts her tea cup down, looking older than she has in the
 whole time you have known her. "My student," she says, "the truth is
 that even I will not live forever. You have learned much from me?as
 much as any single one of all the students I have taught in my years as
 a master?and I have decided to make you my heir. If you accept, you
 shall be considered a member of the Zhuge family, and the heir to the
 Zhuge style of kung fu. Will you accept this responsibility?"

 A: Yes, of course! It is a great honor.
 B: I do not want that responsibility. I must decline.

>a
 have taught you wisely, and perhaps, one day, we will meet again." It
 seems that your time of study under Master Zhuge has come to an end,
 but that your years away from the Order continue.

 The move from Master Zhuge's hermitage up the mountain to the house on
 the outskirts of Kuei Xian goes smoothly, especially with Feng's help.
 The fox spirit has a knack for making heavy objects?like the racks of
 weapons that Master Zhuge has entrusted to you, or the trunks of
 scrolls from Master Zhuge's library?take up far less space than they
 ought to. Her willingness to put in her own hard labor is surprising,
 given the reputation of huli jing, but considering Master Zhuge's kind
 words about the fox spirit, you take her efforts at face value.

 For now.

 The house is far larger than the small cottage you expected, and more
 space than you have had to yourself since you first joined the Order of
 the Peach Tree. Built in the traditional courtyard design, it has a
 front wall with an entryway into a large open courtyard, decorated by a
 pair of cherry trees. The house is built in a U around the courtyard;
 opposite the wall is the main section of the house, with a kitchen, a
 study, a dining room, and a bedroom. The two sides, connected to the
 main section of the house by open-air hallways at the corners, are
 large, empty spaces with smooth bamboo flooring. A final L-shaped
 building, which doubles as the wall around two sides of the property,
 appears intended to house a staff of servants. Clearly, this property
 once belonged to someone wealthy enough to live in comfort, though the
 servants' building is in a state of disrepair.

 Feng does not take a room for herself, but she does seem to know when
 her help is required, and over the course of a few weeks, you discover
 that you always wake to the smell of a hot breakfast and a scented
 oolong tea. The side halls never seem to gather dust, despite the fact
 that you have little use for so much space. Feng herself rarely
 appears, leaving you to unpack Master Zhuge's weapons and scrolls?and
 continue your studies?in solitude.

 At the start of the fourth week, Feng makes herself present at
 breakfast, wearing a face and garb that give her the appearance of
 being the fair daughter of some well-to-do merchant or tea house owner.
 Despite her human form, her seven tails wave behind her back.

 "I know that Miao was a hermit, but I didn't expect you to follow her
 path that way," the fox spirit complains, almost petulantly. "If you're
 going to be here for a while, you ought to connect with members of the
 community, and invite them to visit before I become utterly bored."

 A bored fox spirit does not sound like a positive feature of your new
 home.

 A: I am content with solitude. I will hole up in the main section of
 the house and continue my training.
 B: The point of my wandering years is to experience more of the world.
 I will explore the social dynamics of Kuei Xian.
 C: This space is ideal for starting a school to teach others the skills
 I have learned.

>b
 interesting." She gives you a devilish grin. "Like romance."

 The fox spirit seats herself at the table and pours herself a cup of
 tea?the oolong scented with osmanthus flowers that she brews every
 morning. "There are really two scenarios here. One is that you allow me
 to help you shape your social and romantic life, with your consent. The
 other is that I shape it without your permission. I'm a fox spirit. I
 can't help myself. So, shall we do this the friendly way or the
 sure-to-create-chaos way?"

 A: I accept Feng's help. At least I will have partial control of the
 chaos.
 B: I can stand up to the chaos of a fox spirit. Let her do her worst.

>a

 Feng lets out a gleeful shriek, then hides her smile behind her teacup.

 "I've already done some research," she says. "But first I need to know
 about your taste. Give me your hand."

 As soon as your hand is enclosed in the fox spirit's nimble fingers,
 the room vanishes, and before your eyes parade images of handsome men
 and beautiful women in all styles of clothing. Though the shapes of
 their faces and forms vary, all of them are almost inhumanly
 attractive.

 Which do you find yourself most attracted to?

 A: The men.
 B: The women.
 C: Both men and women.
 D: None of them.

>c
 your own. Feng takes a slow sip from her teacup, hiding her expression,
 then sets it down on the table.

 "You may not have noticed the time passing," she says, "but we are
 nearing Qi Xi?the seventh day of the seventh month?and Kuei Xian is
 having a festival in honor of the holiday in a week's time. There will
 be food, dancing, fireworks, and plenty of traveling merchants creating
 a huge marketplace in our normally humble village. It is a perfect time
 to begin a romance. I will make sure that eligible candidates happen to
 run into you at the festival. I've also heard that your former rival,
 Lu Jin, may be visiting Kuei Xian soon, if you'd be interested
 in?reconnecting." Her delivery of the last word is heavily weighted
 with innuendo.

 The Qi Xi festival is always one of the most cheerful festivals?and
 Feng is right, it is a time that is ripe for romance. There is an old
 legend about a cowhand who fell in love with a celestial maiden?and she
 returned his love. But the gods frowned on the romance and separated
 the lovers; when they realized how deeply the two felt for each other,
 however, they granted them one day a year, the seventh day of the
 seventh month, that they could be together.

 Legends aside, how do you feel about Feng's plan?

 A: Feng is right, it is the perfect time to begin a romance. I accept
 her guidance in meeting people at the festival.
 B: I will attend the festival to meet the town leaders.
 C: I will attend the festival in order to recruit students for my
 school.
 D: I am interested in romance, but I confess to Feng that I am already
 interested in someone.

>go down
 would have noticed your having any romantic interest by now, monk," she
 says. "Tell me, who is the lucky person?"

 A: I admit my longing for my former rival, Lu Jin.
 B: I confess my interest in Feng herself.

>b

 "How unexpected," she says, almost to herself. "I admit I find you
 intriguing?certainly more so than other monks that I have met?but I did
 not think a monk would return those feelings." She turns away, as
 though she is unable to meet your eyes. "I want us to be clear. I have
 promised Miao that I will not take you down the foxhole unless you ask
 it, but I promised nothing about the possibility of warming your bed.
 Is that what you wish?"

 A: Yes. I cannot deny my attraction to the fox spirit.
 B: I did not actually believe she would accept my advance. Faced with
 the reality of being a fox spirit's lover, I find I cannot actually
 accept.

>a
 promise of great pleasure?and, you hope, something more. You move to
 kneel next to her, then reach out to cup her face in your hand before
 you draw her into a deep kiss. She returns it with ardor, and soon,
 breakfast and your conversation have been forgotten.

 But hours later, after you have explored each other thoroughly and are
 lying in the bed she promised to warm, she looks at you, draping her
 long hair, now worn loose, across your chest. "I certainly won't
 suggest that you use the festival to find a bedmate," she says
 cheerfully, "but it remains an opportunity to get involved with Kuei
 Xian, or recruit students to teach here if that's what you really want.
 There will be food, and dancing. I think we should attend."

 A: I am unconcerned with worldly issues, but am intrigued by the
 festival, and would like to amuse Feng.
 B: I am unconcerned with worldly issues and would rather not attend the
 festival.
 C: I feel I should get involved with the community, and attending the
 festival is a good way to do so.

>a
 coming to know the fox spirit, it remains hard to tell when some
 expressions are feigned?but this one strikes you as true.

 The evening of the festival arrives. Feng takes your arm and
 accompanies you into Kuei Xian. The center of the village has been
 transformed into an outdoor banquet hall: it looks as though everyone
 in the village has contributed something. Clearly Governor Rong and his
 family have contributed more than most, a fact the governor is not shy
 about making known, based on the way he appears to be holding court.

 Paper lanterns have been strung up from the doors of all the nearby
 homes and businesses, and musicians perform in the streets. Already,
 some of the younger villagers have begun dancing.

 How do you wish to spend your evening?

 A: I want to spend time with Feng.
 B: I wander through the festival until I am ready to return home.

>b
 many joyous people. It is also tiring. Though the food is excellent and
 the dancing is scheduled to go on until dawn, you find yourself ready
 to return home to the quiet of your courtyard and the comfort of your
 bed.

 A week goes by before you begin to receive visitors. One bright
 morning, a young man arrives at your door. When you meet him at the
 gate, he bows.

 "Honored Master Zhuge, I seek to become your student."

 You have already given some thought about how you will greet
 prospective students. At the Order of the Peach Tree, student spend
 years doing menial labor before they are granted permission to learn
 forms and techniques. In other places, students are left to wait
 outside without food or drink, and only those who survive several days
 without giving up?or fainting?are allowed to be taught.

 How do you greet your first prospective student?

 A: I make him wait?but only a few hours. Then I set him to work doing
 chores.
 B: I welcome him immediately, ushering him inside and discussing what
 he hopes to learn.
 C: Although it could mean fewer students, I want only the most
 tenacious. I tell him to come back tomorrow and get to work repairing
 the servants' building.
 D: I only want the brightest students. I ask them an impossible riddle.

>go down
 thinking skills but a familiarity with literature and philosophy. The
 prospective student sits to consider it, then leaves.

 But he returns the next day, with a friend.

 A week and a handful of additional minds later, the first student
 approaches you with an answer, without sharing it with his peers. It is
 correct, and you let him inside the gate.

 "Why didn't you share the answer?" you ask.

 "How will they learn if they don't figure it out on their own?" he asks
 in return.

 It takes time for others to solve the riddle, and many give up. But
 soon you have a group of very clever students who are eager to learn.

 Having the cleverest students also serves to keep you on your toes, and
 you have to work to stay one step ahead of them. They drive you to be
 your best in order to teach them to be theirs.

 What do you teach at your school?

 A: Physical combat.
 B: Magic.
 C: Both physical combat and magic.

>c
 skills are not as balanced as you would like. The students recognize
 your weaknesses, and though they do not say anything, it is clear that
 they doubt your teaching style.

 They do begin to learn, however, and you feel that you have a good
 group of students, with several years of training to look forward to.

 After your first year in Kuei Xian, your school has recruited 10
 students. Though you know you are waiting to be recalled to the Order
 of the Peach Tree, you feel you have made a good start settling into
 your wandering years, and that you are doing your teachers proud.

 One evening in late spring, the bloom of cherry blossoms perfuming the
 air, you watch a pair of your students sparring and you are reminded of
 your days as a young student at the Order of the Peach Tree. It seems
 now many years ago?and, in fact, it has been many years since you were
 last there. Eight years have passed since your training under Master
 Zhuge ended, but still, the Order has not sent for you to return. You
 have kept busy and, in fact, prosperous. Though several of your
 earliest students have left to pursue other training?or have gone on
 their own years of wandering?others have joined your school to take
 their places.

 Despite your lack of connections to either the ranking families of the
 Middle Kingdom or the Blue Scarves Rebellion, you have managed to
 attract a number of students who have the core desire of learning the
 martial arts from a master. Given your years of study, you certainly
 have much to teach!

 But on a day like today, as your students bow to each other, and then
 to you, your mind is less on their critique than it is on your future.
 The years between now and the appearance of the Dragon Sage are
 shrinking?but in the meantime, you have built a satisfying life for
 yourself. What are your thoughts about the future?

 A: I am surprisingly content with this life and question my earlier
 ambitions.
 B: I am concerned that it has taken so long for the Order to remember
 me.
 C: I continue to strive toward becoming the one monk worthy enough to
 consult the Dragon Sage.

>a
 taken so long for the Order of the Peach Tree to remember that they can
 one day call you back to the monastery. When that day comes, you will
 face a hard choice of which part of your life to leave behind.

 After dismissing your students, you prepare to retire for the evening,
 letting the smell of the cherry blossoms wash over you. As you enter
 the part of the house that remains your private chambers, you settle
 into the routine of your own training. How have you been focusing your
 studies?

 A: I study the texts of ancient masters, applying old traditions to the
 new techniques I am working to develop.
 B: I focus on my physical efforts and on my teaching, particularly in
 sparring with my senior students and teaching my lowest level students
 their basics.
 C: I take trips into the mountains in order to challenge myself as a
 survivor in the wilds.
 D: I seek out other teachers of renown, inviting them to lecture at my
 school.

>c
 you a greater opponent to overcome. While some monks journey into the
 wilderness in order to learn from the world around them and gain
 insight into the universe, your focus is on competition, on challenging
 yourself to overcome rather than to understand. You have heard the old
 saying that reeds bend in a great wind, while a mighty tree may break,
 but you have always found your stubbornness an asset when you face a
 foe. Each night when you are on your own time, you make plans for your
 next trip as a way to express your training.

 The prosperity of your school has given you additional opportunities
 for real training: your reputation has made you the inevitable target
 of challengers, seeking to prove that their style of wushu is superior
 to your own. Some challenges are for sport, with representatives of two
 schools facing off against each other in a friendly bout, usually with
 a determined point system decided on by you and another master. Some
 are a little more brutal than others, with the fight going to first
 blood, a knockout, or a surrender. What is your opinion of these sport
 competitions?

 A: My school must prove itself to be the best, and we will always meet
 a challenge to defend our honor.
 B: I am always eager to test my skills?and to have my students test
 their skills?against real challengers.
 C: I look forward to learning from others.

>c
 masters, simply by observing what they have taught their students. You
 have a knack for learning about people by how they express themselves
 while fighting, and the more challenges you encounter, the faster your
 assessments become.

 Other challenges are more personal: they specifically challenge you and
 your skills in a one-on-one challenge. An implication comes with these
 challenges: if you cannot defend yourself against the challenger, you
 are not worthy of being an instructor, and the style that you have
 taught your students is weak. You have faced very few of these
 challenges, in part because your reputation is strong enough to make
 others wary of approaching you in battle. The fact that you have easily
 dispatched the three challengers who questioned your honor in this way
 has also kept others from making the same mistake.

 As you conclude your evening training, Feng enters your room, wearing
 the guise of a female house servant and carrying a scroll. "A messenger
 arrived for you this afternoon," she says demurely, her humble body
 language reflecting her current role. She holds out the scroll to you.

 You are unsurprised to see that it is a challenge letter, but you are
 shocked to see that it has been signed by Sun An. A youxia?a wandering
 hero?of great skill, Sun An has the reputation for being a generous
 hero, but also a bit of a hothead. According to the stories, he has
 defended villages plagued by bandits and fought off scores of dangerous
 monsters in an effort to keep the common people safe. But he also seems
 to spend an inordinate amount of time making challenges to schools of
 wushu. Some claim he is a wandering immortal, who seeks to make sure
 that other martial artists deserve their reputations. Others say that
 while he is undeniably a great warrior, his conquests are more
 pride-driven than completed out of any sense of restoring balance.

 The text of the letter is quite short: Sun An writes, using every
 courtesy of language, that your reputation as a teacher has encouraged
 him to seek you out and test your skills. He intends to meet you in
 single combat to give you the opportunity to prove your worth, and he
 is prepared to sign a waiver of death?an official government document
 that removes any legal repercussions should a challenge match end in
 death?if that is the style of match you desire.

 Sun An is staying at the Plum Blossom tea house, where he eagerly
 awaits your reply.

 How do you respond?

 A: Bah! He will fall like all my other challengers have fallen.
 B: I reply, inviting Sun An to the school to discuss our match and
 extend my generosity to a fellow warrior.

>b
 not to respond in kind.

 In the morning, bright and early as per your invitation, Sun An arrives
 at the gate. Watching his approach from one of the windows in the
 servants' building, you see that he is a tall, wiry man, his whiplike
 body made of corded muscle. A long scar stretches from his left eyebrow
 to his chin, which gives the warrior a menacing appearance. He wears a
 loose tangzhuang?lightweight pants and a jacket designed for ease of
 movement?and across his back, a pair of shuang dao, identical
 single-edged sabers. He walks with confidence and wears a perpetually
 unimpressed expression on his face.

 How do you greet him?

 A: Like any who approach my school, he must wait patiently until I
 decide to answer the door.
 B: I send students to greet Sun An at the door and have him brought
 through the school to my dining room, where I will receive him.
 C: I meet Sun An at the gate myself, to greet him as an equal.

>c
 another teacher, or a fellow member of the Order of the Peach Tree. He
 bows in return.

 "Welcome to my school," you say. "I am glad you could make the time to
 meet with me to discuss the terms of your challenge."

 "Thank you for your hospitality," he returns, falling into step with
 you as you begin to cross the courtyard to the main building. "I have
 heard much about you as both an instructor and a warrior. I am eager to
 see if you live up to your reputation."

 As you pass the cherry trees, you see two of your lower level students
 discussing a move in one of their forms. They are debating on a
 particular strike that follows a 180 degree turn in the sequence, and
 it is unlikely that they will resolve the issue on their own, as both
 are arguing the case for an incorrect strike. Do you stop to help them?

 A: It would be rude to leave my guest. I remember the students to
 discuss it with them later.
 B: Any of my senior student can resolve this debate. I will leave it to
 them.
 C: I stop briefly to tell them the proper strike and let them get on
 with their practice.
 D: I stop to talk to my students, giving them the proper instruction
 and moving through the form with them to make sure they have it.

>go down
 students stop their conversation as you approach, and they quickly fall
 into rank behind you, starting the form at the beginning. As you move
 through the form with your students, all three of you moving in synch,
 you see that Sun An is watching you raptly.

 The form concludes, and you turn to your students to make sure they
 have no further questions. Both bow to you, looking slightly
 embarrassed to have been caught uncertain of their work, but grateful
 that you stopped to go over it with them. You return their bows with a
 shallow one of your own, then walk to join Sun An, who is still
 standing in the center of the courtyard.

 "Thank you for waiting," you say.

 "I enjoyed the chance to watch you work," Sun An says, returning your
 bow. He grins at you, and you are not entirely certain whether it is
 intended as friendly or fierce. "It gives me an advantage for our
 coming battle."

 How do you respond?

 A: I laugh it off. Watching me teach a low level form is not likely to
 give him insight into my higher level skills.
 B: I tell him he is welcome to the advantage. I would not wish for him
 to enter our competition unprepared.
 C: I suggest that, as an honorable man, he might like to even the odds
 by demonstrating a form of his own.

>c
 would be willing to even that advantage by showing me one of your
 forms?"

 Sun An laughs. "Never let it be said that I am a man of dishonor," he
 says cheerfully. He moves to the open space you and your students have
 vacated and begins to move.

 The form is a blocking system, involving almost no footwork, but
 focusing on an elaborate pattern of blocks, strikes, and
 counterstrikes. As your opponent begins to move, your students stop
 their own activities throughout the courtyard and join you in watching.
 In truth, Sun An moves beautifully, and his form is a pleasure to
 watch: the rhythm to his movement is syncopated, and his strikes are
 quick, but he never ceases to flow from one shape to the next. When he
 concludes, he bows, and you and your students bow back to him in
 appreciation.

 He rejoins you, and you begin to lead him toward the open door to your
 dining room. "A snake blocking system, I assume?"

 Sun An grins, and though his scar continues to give him an air of
 menace, he seems genuinely happy with your comment. "It is called Plum
 Tree," he says, "and yes, it is snake. Most people assume crane."

 Given his body type and his air of arrogant confidence, you are not
 surprised. "Syncopation with slow flowing movements punctuated by quick
 strikes?" you say in summary. "It could only be snake. You performed it
 well, but again, based on your reputation, I am hardly surprised." You
 gesture through the open door. "Will you join me for tea?"

 The two of you take a moment to breathe in the aroma of your tea and
 appreciate its flavor before moving on to a discussion. You make small
 talk, asking after Sun An's travels prior to reaching Kuei Xian. He, in
 turn, asks about your school, politely inquiring about the number of
 students you teach and the length of time you have been teaching. It is
 much more like the conversation you would expect between two youxia
 meeting in a tea house than the conversation between the master of a
 school and a challenger questioning that master's skill.

 After a while, the discussion turns to business, and you determine the
 boundaries of your competition. Once you have worked out the details,
 Sun An rises, thanking you again for your hospitality. You will see him
 in three days.

 The challenge will take place at a fighting tower, which you and your
 students constructed five years ago for training exercises, not far
 from your home and just outside of town, on the edge of a bamboo
 forest. The tower is built like scaffolding?there is a flat surface at
 the top, about sixty feet in the air, but no ropes around the outside
 to keep opponents from falling to the ground. Though the scaffolding is
 easy to climb, two lines of tall posts also spiral around the tower and
 serve as more challenging steps to reach the top. You have had your
 students spar on the posts as well, chasing each other up and down to
 practice maintaining their balance during a fight.

 You also keep a cache of weapons in a trap door accessible from the top
 of the platform for easy access while your students are training. This
 will enable you to pick and choose your own gear as you see fit during
 the competition.

 A contest like this one requires witnesses, and you have requested the
 presence of a magistrate in order to keep things official. To your
 surprise, Governor Rong himself has volunteered to preside over the
 event. Additional witnesses have been invited, and you would not be
 surprised if some large part of the population of Kuei Xian?and perhaps
 members of the Blue Scarves Rebellion?arrive to watch the combat.

 What terms have you decided on?

 A: We will fight to unconsciousness or disabling; I am prepared to sign
 a death waiver.
 B: We will fight to surrender, but no death waivers will be required.
 C: We will fight using the point system devised by the Imperial
 swordmaster.

>b
 not see the logic in depriving the world of the knowledge a skilled
 martial artist can acquire. Your death, or the death of Sun An, would
 be a loss of knowledge and skill, and you see no need to take the
 challenge that far.

 On the morning of the fight, all of your students accompany you to the
 training tower. There are few clouds, and the temperature is perfect
 for the late spring. Conditions could not be better for a
 challenge?unless, of course, they could somehow favor you rather than
 being equally good for your opponent.

 Feng walks alongside the group, today wearing the guise of a male
 doctor, glasses perched on the bridge of his nose and acupuncture kit
 clutched in his arms. Hopefully you will not need Feng's expertise, but
 it is good to know he is there.

 As you expected, there is a large turnout from the village. Governor
 Rong has brought several bureaucrats to attend and take notes.

 Feng squeezes your hand for luck as you move toward the tables where
 Governor Rong and his attendees are waiting.

 Sun An stands at the first pole, contemplating the height of your
 fighting field. He towers over the villagers, his whiplike body naked
 to the waist, except for the shuang dao?the dual sabers?he wears
 strapped to his back. Despite the scar that runs down his cheek, many
 of the female villagers seem quite taken with his appearance, and you
 notice money changing hands as people bet whether you or your
 challenger will win the day.

 What do you do?

 A: I approach Sun An and bow so that the match begins with honor.
 B: I race to the top. I am eager to get the competition underway.
 C: I acknowledge the crowd, encouraging their cheers.

>a
 asks. He seems eager for the fight ahead, and no worry marks his
 expression. Either he has already dismissed you as a challenge, or he
 has no fear of losing.

 A: I say that my fists will do my talking for me.
 B: I wish him a good fight.
 C: I express a hope that after the challenge, Sun An may stay on at the
 school for a while, either to share his own knowledge or to learn what
 I can share.
 D: I race to the top?I have nothing left to say.

>c
 circumstances, be a peace offering. But you are clearly not backing
 down from the challenge, and he looks at you with new respect.

 "If you win," he says slowly, "I will seriously consider your offer."

 "Then I had better win," you say lightly.

 Sun An bows, then mounts the first post in his spiral.

 How do you get to the top of the tower?

 A: I run up the posts, using my chi to allow me to remain grounded,
 even when I am in the air.
 B: I use my chi to bounce off a few of the posts and fly to the top.
 C: I quickly climb up the scaffolding, hurrying to beat Sun An to the
 top.
 D: I climb the scaffolding slowly, using a razor-thin wire to weave
 traps subtly along the way.

>a
 all. You reach the top to the roaring sound of the crowd, appreciating
 your smooth ascent.

 Sun An appears a moment later, leaping from the final post and onto the
 platform atop the tower.

 You face Sun An across the platform, and the tall warrior draws his
 shuang dao, spinning them with what is clearly intended as an
 intimidating flourish. It is flashy, but rather than intimidate you, it
 shows you more of Sun An's movement style. The weapons are bladed only
 on one side, but it is clear from the speed and confidence with which
 he wields them that he can easily target the bladed side as he chooses.
 Your best options would be to get in too close for his swords to be
 effective, to choose a weapon that gives you a longer reach than his,
 or to keep moving around behind him. All of the shuang dao techniques
 you have seen rely on forward, side, or over the head striking; given
 his greater height, the last poses little threat for you.

 A: I select a guan dao from the weapons cache, choosing to keep him at
 greater distance.
 B: I will fight with daggers?two long knives and several throwing darts
 to give me long and short options.
 C: I select the whip chain I carried with me from the school, which
 allows me both long- and close-range options.

>c
 While it is still above your head, Sun An charges, trying to get inside
 your distance range before you can attack. You snap the whip chain at
 him, the red silk flag at its end fluttering toward the sparking silver
 of his swords. He bats the whip chain out of the way, and you make a
 quick pull, tangling his sword and pulling him off balance. As he gets
 close enough to strike with his free sword, you leap forward and
 side-kick to his other arm, sending his second sword off target as
 well. Sun An continues past you and you free your whip chain as your
 opponent spins his swords around him in a clearing move, giving you
 both some space to consider what you will do next.

 What is your goal as you meet in combat this time?

 A: The faster the fight is over, the better. I am confident that I am
 the better fighter and seek to disable Sun An quickly.
 B: I feel that I should learn more about his style to target his
 weaknesses. I fight defensively.
 C: I want to keep Sun An at the edge of the platform and cause him to
 lose his balance.

>b
 become flashier as his confidence increases. You can tell that his
 greatest weakness is his arrogance, and that despite this flaw, his
 confidence is well earned.

 And by watching him, you are certain that, with his fighting skills
 alone, he is better than you are. You will have to outwit him,
 overwhelm him with your chi, or simply outlast him in order to win. Or
 you must find a way to concede that he is the winner without losing
 face entirely.

 A: I want to keep Sun An at the edge of the platform and cause him to
 lose his balance.
 B: I continue on the defensive, determined to outlast him. When he
 tires, he will become sloppy, and I will make my move.
 C: I meet his eyes, drawing him into a fight of the minds; the rest of
 the battle will play out without further injury to our bodies and allow
 for an honorable surrender.

>c
 see clearly what would happen if they were to meet in combat. As Sun An
 looks at you, the two of you lock gazes, and soon, you see the combat,
 as real as if you were both still engaged. He is the better fighter,
 but you continue on in the mind battle, revealing secrets of your
 style, enticing him with movements you believe he has never seen. You
 have stopped trying to win, and started attempting to persuade him that
 combat is not the only measure of your worthiness. The mind battle
 draws to a conclusion, Sun An's swords hesitating as they rest, crossed
 on your throat. You can almost feel the coolness of their metal against
 your skin, despite the fact that neither you nor he has moved atop the
 platform for several minutes. Finally, after an almost agonizingly long
 time, he removes his swords from your neck.

 "You have an interesting concept of what it means to win," he says,
 sheathing his swords behind his back. And then you are both back atop
 the platform, where Sun An has indeed put his swords away.

 "I concede this contest!" Sun An shouts for the whole of the audience
 to hear. "Zhuge Meili is a worthy teacher and upholds the reputation of
 the Order of the Peach Tree and the school in Kuei Xian." He moves to
 kneel before you. "Zhuge Meili, I surrender to you. Accept me as a
 student."

 A: Now that his guard is down, I attack.
 B: I graciously accept Sun An as a student.
 C: I announce Sun An as my peer.

>b

 Several hours later, over a meal you share with Sun An, you again
 reiterate your invitation for him to become your student. "That is a
 very generous offer," he says, "but I'm afraid staying in one place is
 not in my nature. I wish you well, Zhuge Meili." After a meal, brought
 to you by a demure Feng wearing the form of a serving girl, Sun An
 departs, looking spry despite his injuries.

 "Is he an immortal?" you ask Feng.

 The fox spirit just scoffs and busies herself clearing the table. You
 are pleased that you have managed to prove yourself?and, hopefully,
 ward off any future challengers for some time to come.

 The leaves have fallen from the cherry trees in your courtyard, and the
 chill in the air announces the approach of winter. More than a year has
 passed since your battle with Sun An, and you find your thoughts
 frequently returning to the Order of the Peach Tree.

 Perhaps it is a premonition.

 On a chilly afternoon, Feng, wearing the shape of a single-tailed
 fox?warmer, she says, than her human guises?enters your room with a
 scroll in her mouth. She drops it on the floor and gives you a fox's
 smile, tongue lolling out from between her teeth.

 Despite some lingering saliva and the bite-marks creasing the sealing
 wax, it is clear from the symbol pressed into the seal that this is a
 letter from the Order. It may well contain your summons to return to
 the monastery.

 A: I am in no hurry to open the letter.
 B: I am eager to read news from the monastery, and to return if called.
 C: I hesitate for a moment before opening the letter.

>c
 change again. You take a moment to appreciate what you have learned
 over the past decade before cracking open the seal.

 The letter reads:

 "To my student, Zhuge Meili,

 "All at the Order hope this message finds you well. I send my apologies
 for waiting so long to call for your return. Things have been unsettled
 here, and I was hoping that matters could be better resolved before
 adding additional voices?and tempers?to the mix. Sadly, the situation
 has only become worse in recent days, and I find myself calling all of
 our wandering monks to return to the monastery, to face what may be the
 largest challenge the Order has ever encountered.

 "As you are aware, the foreign presence in the Middle Kingdom has grown
 over the last twenty years. The Order has always followed the lead of
 the Son of Heaven in our actions with the foreigners and maintained an
 aloof stance toward these worldly affairs. But the world has come to
 our door, and we can ignore the foreign presence no longer. A small
 army of the foreigners is gathering to the east, setting up camp
 between the monastery and Xiaonanhai. Though we have sent word to the
 Emperor of the growing force on our doorstep, we cannot be sure that
 any of our messengers have made it past the army. Though they have not
 yet delivered terms, it is clear that if we do not surrender our
 resources?and possibly the monastery itself?they will attack.

 "You are called upon to return to the Order immediately, with any
 resources that will aid our plight. I maintain hope that this can be
 resolved peacefully, or that help will arrive from the Son of Heaven,
 but we must be prepared for things to go otherwise.

 "Abbot Bao"

 The abbot's letter is sobering; if the foreigners do attack the
 monastery, it will be their first prominent target beyond the villages
 they have already claimed. Such a display will make it clear that they
 do not intend to assimilate to the Middle Kingdom, but forge their own
 society in spite of the Emperor and his laws.

 A: This outcome is unsurprising, based on the previous behavior of the
 foreigners. The Order should have been better prepared.
 B: Surely if the foreigners were so great a threat, the Emperor would
 intervene. Like Abbot Bao, I hope for a peaceful resolution.
 C: The Emperor has been too lax in dealing with the foreign threat, but
 perhaps a peaceful solution can be found.
 D: The Order must dig in and defend the monastery, whether or not it
 comes to fighting.

>c
 foreigners, given the way they have treated the people of the Middle
 Kingdom whose lands they have taken. If the Emperor is not willing to
 make that clear, perhaps the Order can draw some of those lines and
 defend all of the Middle Kingdom through negotiation.

 How will you return to the Order?

 A: I gather my students together and ask them who will come to fight on
 behalf of the Order.
 B: I do not wish to put anyone else in danger; I will travel to the
 monastery alone.
 C: I have no interest in returning to the monastery. My life is here
 now; the Order can fend for itself.

>a
 Though some of them wear fear in their expressions, others meet your
 news with determination to prove their worth.

 You tell everyone to pack what they wish to take with them, and that
 you will be leaving in the morning. But as dawn comes, you see that
 many of your students have not gathered. It appears their fear is
 stronger than their loyalty, and you will be bringing a much smaller
 force with you to the monastery. Feng, in her guise as a human servant,
 gives each student a small package filled with warm buns. The fox
 spirit will be staying in Kuei Xian.

 From here, she will keep your affairs in order; once the matter with
 the foreigners has been resolved, you can decide what will happen with
 the courtyard house and the life you have built in Kuei Xian.

 You and your company start traveling east toward the monastery. It is a
 three-day journey directly to the Order of the Peach Tree, which gives
 you some time to decide which actions you will take, or which course of
 action you will advise, when you arrive. As you are traveling, you
 encounter a few messengers and merchants heading toward Kuei Xian; they
 are able to provide you with updated news since the delivery of your
 letter.

 The foreign army is led by a man named George Gower, who is supposedly
 a fearsome warrior, though the rumors vary as to his origin. Some say
 he was an outlaw before he came to the Middle Kingdom, while others
 swear that he is a representative of a foreign government. Still others
 call him an explorer who landed on the Middle Kingdom's shores and
 paved the way for more foreign settlers to arrive.

 Gower's forces have moved in on the monastery, making it difficult for
 anyone to travel to or from the Order of the Peach Tree. Based on what
 you are told, someone who knows the terrain as well as you once
 did?and, hopefully, still do?should be able to find a path around their
 location.

 How will you approach the army?

 A: We will avoid the army and go straight to the monastery.
 B: I want to get firsthand information about the foreigners. We will
 scout their army before going to the monastery.
 C: I want to meet Gower for myself. We will make contact with the army
 in the open.

>b
 your arrival to the hills below the monastery so that you can see the
 foreign army as dusk is falling. You and your company keep off of the
 road and travel through the bamboo forest that lies in the hills
 beneath the home of the Order. Gower's army looks nothing like the
 organized Imperial Army?instead, they are dressed in a variety of
 foreign clothing, with nothing resembling a uniform. There is very
 little that resembles armor, but then, you do not wear armor, either.
 What is distressing about their encampment is that you see a number of
 cannons and hand cannons?supplies that are commonly used by the
 Imperial Army, though of a different style.

 The Order of the Peach Tree, with their reliance on the physical and
 spiritual arts of battle, has nothing like cannons at the monastery.

 From within the shadows, you can see that the size of the army has not
 been exaggerated. Probably five hundred men are here; though that is a
 small force compared to the Imperial Army, the monks and students that
 live at the monastery would be facing odds of five to one. Even with
 the support you bring, the odds are bleak. One outright fight could be
 disastrous if the men are skilled at combat, especially given their
 likelihood of bringing those explosive weapons into play.

 A: I have seen what I want to see. From here we can cut over to the
 path that leads to the monastery without being noticed.
 B: I want to sabotage their camp.
 C: I am concerned about those cannons. I want to seek out Gower to
 negotiate.

>a
 able to parallel it from inside the bamboo forest until you are out of
 range of both the army and Gower's scouts. You reach the gates of the
 monastery without further complications.

 Your arrival at the monastery is greeted with cheers from the monks who
 remember you. Among the students, there are whispers?clearly, you've
 been spoken about by your old teachers, you hope with compliments
 rather than as an example of what not to do under their instruction.

 But it is Abbot Bao who is most relieved by your presence. The abbot
 has aged in the decade you have been away, and the current situation
 weighs heavily on him. He calls you into the Inner Temple to share what
 you have learned. When you tell him of your journey and what you have
 learned of the foreign army, he greets your news with a blank
 expression, taking it all in without judgment.

 "You have been in the world, my student," he says slowly, "and I have
 been here in the temple for far too long. I fear this decision is
 beyond be, and I ask your advice. How do you think we should deal with
 these foreigners?"

 How do you think the monks should face the foreigners?

 A: We should negotiate with the foreigners.
 B: The monastery is well fortified. We can defend it against an
 outright attack and withstand a siege.
 C: I will challenge a champion from the foreign army in single combat.
 D: I will call the forces of nature against the foreign army.
 E: We will create a ruse, making the monastery look better fortified
 and populated than it is.
 F: I will defer to another of Abbot Bao's advisors and abide by that
 decision.

>a
 Bao allows you to take the lead. Along with a few of your followers,
 you travel down to the camp. The perimeter guards see you coming and
 greet you in their foreign tongue, probably calling for you to halt.

 "Greetings," you say, holding your hands open in a position you hope
 they will view as peaceful. "I am Zhuge Meili, a monk of the Order of
 the Peach Tree. I am hoping to converse with George Gower." The guards
 escort you to a large tent in the middle of the encampment. One steps
 inside and holds a conversation in the foreign tongue; after a moment,
 he returns and ushers you inside. Within, the walls are illuminated by
 glass lanterns, and a bespectacled man with a mop of gray hair tied
 into a tail at his neck stands in greeting.

 "I am George Gower," he says, his accent clear and his mastery of your
 language evident. "I understand you requested a meeting?"

 "I am Zhuge Meili," you say. "I have come to discuss the matter of the
 monastery above us."

 The pale man grins, and you begin to suspect that the gray in his hair
 is affected?he looks as though he must be in his early thirties at
 best. "Ah, I am glad to hear it," he says. "It's been such trouble
 getting you people to converse openly about anything. There's always
 some matter of tea to be shared, or vague references to spirits and
 ancestors and other bothersome things. Always happy to meet someone
 with a straightforward perspective."

 A: I explain the monks are interested in a peaceful outcome to this
 situation and wish to negotiate.
 B: I lie and say that the Emperor is sending troops to make sure the
 matter resolves quickly.
 C: I explain that the monks do not intend to leave the monastery, and a
 siege will end badly for his men.
 D: I lie about the number of warriors available to the Order, claiming
 that we are ready for an attack.
 E: I believe we are at an impasse. He can offer his surrender, or he
 will face the Order in battle.

>a
 walked in. Would you like a cigar?" He holds up a sweet but noxious
 smelling tube of wrapped herbs, and you shake your head. "No, no, none
 of you seem to. A pity, really, but you'll learn. Well, then, to
 business. We're quite interested in the location your monks have taken
 up on that mountain. Quite defensible, by all appearances, but close to
 a major trade route. Seems like an excellent place to camp an army. And
 your people don't seem to be doing much with it aside from jumping
 about at each other, occasionally using sticks, as far as I can tell.
 Looks a bit silly to an outsider, I have to say. Could really do that
 sort of thing anywhere."

 A: I cannot stand the condescending tone this barbarian is using.
 Negotiating will get us nowhere.
 B: I explain that the monks are teachers, scholars, and warriors, well
 respected in the Middle Kingdom for their knowledge.
 C: I question his desire to have an army. Does he expect to challenge
 the Emperor?

>c
 protests, but you see the insincerity behind his statement. "I intend
 to raise my men to protect the good of the Middle Kingdom. There are a
 number of outside interests not nearly so benevolent as me and mine.
 When one of them comes to threaten the well-being of this land, surely
 your emperor will be glad of an ally."

 If he has convinced himself of this lie, there is really no sense in
 negotiating along this line any further. You'll have to try a different
 tactic.

 A: I lie and say that the Emperor is sending troops to make sure the
 matter resolves quickly.
 B: I explain that the monks do not intend to leave the monastery, and a
 siege will end badly for his men.
 C: I lie about the number of warriors available to the Order, claiming
 that we are ready for an attack.
 D: I believe we are at an impasse. He can offer his surrender, or he
 will face the Order in battle.

>b
 you are. "You're quite serious," he says, and you hear a note of
 astonishment in his voice. He studies you for a little longer, then
 runs a hand over his grayed hair, and you begin to suspect that it's a
 wig, some sort of affectation with no purpose that you can see.

 But instead of speaking, he takes a swig out of a metal flask; the
 liquid smells a bit like rice wine, but stronger, with an acrid odor
 that threatens to burn your nostrils on a whiff. He mutters a foreign
 word in a tone that makes you guess it was a curse. "All right then,
 Zhuge Meili. Here's how you can prove to me that your monks are the
 knowledgeable warriors you claim they are. We'll each choose a champion
 who represents the best of our fighters with the best of our weaponry.
 If you?or the warrior of your choosing?can best who I select, then I
 will acknowledge we have something to learn." He tries for a smile, but
 doesn't quite manage. "We've a long tradition of this sort of thing
 where I come from."

 "So do we," you assure him, before he can launch into further
 explanation.

 "If my champion wins," he says, "then you'll agree to vacate the
 property."

 This seems a lot to agree to without the permission of Abbot Bao. "A
 reasonable suggestion," you say. "I will confer with the abbot and send
 a message confirming the terms."

 "I'll expect word by tomorrow morning," Gower says, rising. You stand,
 and he thrusts a hand at you; you realize just in time that he means it
 as a sign of agreement, not an attack. You meet his hand and shake it
 as you rise from your own seat.

 When you arrive at the monastery, you explain to Abbot Bao what has
 transpired, and though he is concerned about the possible outcome, he
 is eager to resolve the conflict without massive casualties on either
 side. Given your role in the negotiation, it does not surprise you when
 Abbot Bao selects you as the Order's champion. To make a point, you
 have decided to face their champion empty handed.

 You walk confidently down the path as the time of your meeting
 approaches. Many of the monks follow you, as much to witness the battle
 as to provide you with support should the foreigners prove
 dishonorable. Just before the camp of the foreigners, a space has been
 cleared, and a young man wearing a cutlass and wielding a hand cannon
 stands next to George Gower himself.

 "Greetings, Zhuge Meili," Gower says cheerfully. "This is Erasmus
 Fontaine. He'll be your opponent today."

 Fontaine looks up at you from his hand cannon and you see clear hatred
 in his eyes. This man means to kill you, regardless of any agreement
 you might be able to reach with Gower.

 "Should your man die, I expect you to continue to honor our agreement,"
 you shout out, so that everyone can hear.

 Fontaine snorts.

 "Of course!" Gower says, waving away your concerns as though they are
 unmerited, and as though you have not just called his honor into
 question. "We've agreed to the terms, monk. Shall we get on with it?"

 Without waiting for you to agree, Fontaine lifts the hand cannon and
 shoots.

 A: I dodge beneath the shot, closing so that his weapon becomes
 useless.
 B: I use my chi to leap over his shot and attack him from above.
 C: I fade slightly to the side, allowing the bullet to graze my
 shoulder, before closing the distance.

>b
 you descend on your opponent. He raises his hand cannon at you in the
 air, but you are already on him, using your higher vantage point to
 execute Parting the Clouds?which rakes twice across his face before
 piercing the pressure point called the village rain, the notch right
 between the clavicles, with an Immortal Man strike. The strike drives
 him downward as your full body weight presses on top of him, and as he
 hits the ground, you feel your fingers crush his windpipe. The
 foreigners, who had begun to cheer when Fontaine shot, fall deadly
 silent. But Gower simply nods at you. "It seems I have underestimated
 you," he says. "We will abide by our agreement." He says something in
 the foreign tongue and you tense?but immediately, the foreigners turn
 away, heading back into their camp. Within hours, they have started a
 retreat, leaving the Order of the Peach Tree to once again decide its
 own fate.

 You are hailed as the hero of the hour, and it is clear your prestige
 has grown among the members of the Order. For your own sake, you are
 glad of the success you had in defending the monastery, and are
 relieved that another challenge is behind you.

 After the conflict between the Order of the Peach Tree and the
 foreigners at the monastery, events seem to pass quickly. News of the
 foreigners is hard to avoid: more of their ships are landing in the
 fishing villages they took over to establish their own port. While
 their numbers increase, they are also making a clear attempt to
 insinuate themselves further into the Imperial Court. George Gower has
 taken up residence in Xiaonanhai, and the rumor is that he calls on the
 Emperor every day, trying to mold a space for himself as an Imperial
 advisor.

 Or, some whisper, as the man who will try to steal the Emperor's
 throne.

 But though tensions are high, the violence has slowed. The Blue Scarves
 Rebellion has continued with raids, hassling the foreigners at every
 opportunity, but there have been no large-scale battles. It is though
 everyone is holding their breath.

 What do you think the foreigners will do next?

 A: I am still not concerned with worldly affairs. At this point, if I
 weren't also seeking to detach myself from emotional reactions, I'd be
 annoyed with everyone pointing them out to me.
 B: Clearly, there is a reason behind their change in tactics. I analyze
 their locations to determine what outcome they may seek.
 C: They are saving their resources for a large fight. I make discreet
 inquiries into their weapon stores and the supply chain between Gower
 and his men.

>b
 the foreigners on it. They are densest at the shoreline, but while more
 are landing there, there is a trend from the shore northward, toward
 the capital, skirting the marshes when possible. It makes perfect sense
 now why the foreigners wanted control of the monastery: its location is
 directly in the path of the settlements the foreigners have been making
 over the past twenty years.

 But the presence of George Gower at the capital makes you suspect that
 he is not planning to lead an army against the Emperor. If anything,
 you see wisdom in the rumors that he hopes to gain power through
 influencing the Emperor, rather than replacing him. Given how the
 foreigners have treated the people they've displaced, Gower having the
 Imperial ear could be disastrous for the Middle Kingdom.

 You get a clue into Gower's plans the spring after the attack on the
 monastery. It arrives in the form of a summons: sealed with blue wax
 impressed with the shape of a rampant lion, the bleached white paper is
 so stiff it crackles when it opens. The letter reads:

 "To Zhuge Meili:

 "Based on the reputation of your skill and honor, you have been
 selected to compete in a fighting exhibition for the entertainment of
 the glorious Emperor. The fight, which will take place in an arena now
 being constructed just south of the Imperial capital, will feature two
 warriors of my native country on horseback, wielding the weapons of our
 lands. You will fight alongside a captured rebel and traitor to the
 Middle Kingdom, Lu Jin, who will be released from the Imperial dungeons
 for the event. The outcome of the combat will settle a wager between
 myself and the Emperor as to which nation boasts superior fighters.

 "As a reward, the winners will be granted lands and a title by the
 crown, and, should it be relevant, receive a pardon for crimes against
 the Empire. More, however, the winners will have the prestige of having
 defended their country's honor.

 "An Imperial guard will be sent to accompany you.

 "Cheers,

 "George Gower"

 It looks as though you will be unable to simply decline participating
 in this competition. How do you react to this summons?

 A: Lu Jin, a prisoner? Of course we will fight?and win?to insure his
 freedom!
 B: This is our moment to prove the foreigners are unworthy. We will
 fight for the honor of the Middle Kingdom!
 C: This is sure to be a farce, with the game board aligned against us,
 but we will triumph regardless?by whatever means necessary.
 D: I have no interest in fighting in this competition. I will escape
 before the supposed honor guard arrives.

>c
 that the odds were in his favor. He expects to win more than an
 event?he is using this as one more step to gain the Emperor's ear. The
 mere fact that he is having wagers with the Son of Heaven is
 unbelievably presumptuous.

 Whatever it takes to prove that the foreigners are unworthy, you will
 make sure it is done. The following week, a group of Imperial soldiers,
 led by Commander Rong Jue, the son of Governor Rong, arrives to collect
 you. The procession has all the trappings of an honor guard, but from
 the way they watch you, you know that?like you?they consider you a
 prisoner. As you travel to the capital, how do you pass the time?

 A: I talk to Rong Jue, hoping to find out more about what is happening
 in the capital.
 B: I tell stories and jokes, trying to set the soldiers at ease.
 C: I cast an oracle bone to determine whether the Imperial Challenge
 will have good results.
 D: I say nothing to anyone. Traveling in silence will be my rebellion
 against Gower for forcing me into his contest.

>a
 Xiaonanhai life. You can tell that he is trying to give a fair account
 of the foreign presence in the capital city, but you suspect that he
 has no fond feelings for George Gower or the foreigner's position at
 court. If Rong Jue's feelings are representative, you may have other
 allies inside the Imperial city.

 In addition, Rong Jue informs you of how the contest is to work: you
 and Lu Jin will face a pair of foreigners wearing what Gower calls
 "courtly" armor?which Rong explains means outdated armor designed to
 stand against hand-to-hand combat but not hand cannons. The exhibition
 will start on horseback and resolve on the ground, as long as one
 member of each team is alive.

 No matter how many times you have been to Xiaonanhai, it never ceases
 to take your breath away at first sight. As you crest the last hill
 between you and the capital, the walled city stretches out in front of
 you, fading into mist, so that it appears that the city itself extends
 forever. A river runs through the center of the city, and one wall of
 the palace rubs against it like a cat against a friendly hand. The
 palace itself towers above the rest of the city, its golden calligraphy
 catching stray bits of light that float in through the mist, making it
 seem as though the whole building sparkles.

 Xiaonanhai is the center of the Middle Kingdom, its heart and its
 breath. It is a testament to the working of humans, and proof that
 human hands can create something lasting. It also buzzes like a hive of
 angry bees; anyone within its walls must be wary that they are not
 stung by criminals and bureaucrats alike.

 The soldiers are eager to get you to the palace, given that you have
 arrived the day before the competition, but you persuade them to stop
 by Tai Thong, a pastry shop you remember fondly from the last time you
 were in Xiaonanhai. The proprietors treat all their customers like
 family, and the atmosphere gives a sense that, through pastries, one
 can achieve both peace and prosperity. You make a small purchase,
 setting a pork bun aside for Lu Jin, as Rong Jue thinks Lu Jin will be
 released into the custody of the Imperial soldiers as soon as you
 arrive at the palace.

 Instead, however, you are escorted to a guest room in the palace,
 attended to by servants, all with the intent of making you comfortable
 while you wait for hours for further news. All of you ignore the fact
 that soldiers are stationed outside your door. Finally, after night has
 fallen, a thin and damp Lu Jin is ushered into your room. They have
 clearly just bathed him, in order to look presentable, you assume, for
 your competition.

 A: I go to Lu Jin's side immediately to make sure he is unharmed.
 B: We don't know who might be watching. I gesture to the table in the
 guest chamber and offer Lu Jin a pork bun.
 C: I nod to Lu Jin and wish him a good night.

>b
 any time eating it. "So," he says finally, "I suppose you have a plan
 to defeat the foreigners. I hope you'll consider my ideas as well."

 You agree to listen to Lu Jin's suggestions, though as he has been
 incarcerated for months, it appears, you wonder how he could have
 anything useful to add. As you sit together, Lu Jin gives you all the
 information about the competition he has been able to glean. The two
 foreign competitors are masters of an old sport combat style called
 jousting that is rarely practiced in Gower's home country except for
 entertainment. They will be wearing thick plates of armor and carrying
 shields, using long lances to try to unhorse or kill you in a direct
 charge. You will be provided with ji, spear-tipped halberds that have
 crescent blades around a sword-breaker on either side of the haft.

 "Their armor is an advantage on horseback, but we'll move much faster
 than they will on the ground," Lu Jin theorizes. "And they'll have
 limited visibility due to their helmets?we should be able to stay in
 their blind spots, again if we can bring them to the ground. The hard
 part about the armor is that it offers very few openings: their eyes
 and at the softer armor covering their joints?which is still heavy
 enough to deflect a blade."

 Your brain begins working around these issues. "We'll need to figure
 out their other disadvantages," you say, almost to yourself.

 "Or you could ask for help," says a familiar voice. The only remaining
 palace servant steps forward, and you instantly recognize Feng, despite
 the fox spirit's new disguise. Lu Jin looks at you in confusion, but
 you just nod for him to listen. "I can offer you these," Feng says,
 rolling two small vials out onto the palm of her hand. "Poison enough
 to coat one blade each."

 Lu Jin begins to reach for the poison.

 A: Feng has never led me astray before. This is a clever plan, even if
 it is dishonorable, and I am confident we can execute it without
 notice.
 B: Feng is a fox spirit?my companion or not, tempting monks into
 dishonor is in her nature. No good will come of taking up her offer.
 C: If we were caught using poison, we would be shown as dishonorable
 opponents. We cannot risk that loss of face, so we cannot accept the
 poison.
 D: We will not stoop to such a dishonorable tactic!

>c
 consequences not only to us, but to the reputation of the Middle
 Kingdom, would be disastrous."

 "Then let's not get caught," Lu Jin says excitedly. "We need this sort
 of advantage, Zhuge Meili."

 You look at both Feng and Lu Jin, giving them your best teacher stare.
 "No," you say, "we don't. We can use the sword breakers on the ji to
 open their armor like peeling off a can if it comes down to it. But
 this?someone will find out eventually. And everything we're seeking to
 prove?that we are better fighters than the foreigners, that the Middle
 Kingdom has greater honor?will be completely undone."

 Lu Jin weighs your words, then turns away. "May your confidence be
 merited," he says bitterly. You say goodbye to Feng, and both you and
 Lu Jin agree to turn in for the night. As you are falling asleep, you
 think you hear voices, but you put it off to being the palace servants
 going about their work.

 The next morning, you and Lu Jin are escorted by no fewer than twenty
 armed Imperial soldiers, including Rong Jue, to a field north of the
 city wall. There are raised stands of seating, crafted, you suspect,
 from bamboo, and a pavilion is on a raised dais overlooking an oblong
 arena. The whole thing looks very odd to you, and Gower's work is
 evident in everything from the pennant flag decorations to the strange
 rope, suspended at chest height, that divides the arena. Two riders,
 completely covered in steel armor, stand next to two horses at the far
 end of the arena; you and Lu Jin are escorted to two waiting horses and
 a weapons rack at the other side.

 Now that the moment is upon you, how will you prepare for this
 competition to begin?

 A: Select a weapon from the rack.
 B: Greet our opponents so that the combat begins with honor.
 C: Examine the horses to make sure they are in good condition.
 D: I am ready for battle!

>c
 nothing has been tampered with. Sure enough, you see that the tie
 securing the saddle on one of the horses has been sliced, and that the
 other has a burr in its bridle.

 You call for Rong Jue, who comes over immediately. "Is there a
 problem?"

 When you explain, Rong Jue's face goes dark. But before he can say
 anything, you suggest, "Could you bring us two fresh horses?"

 He nods shortly. "I will see that two stallions are brought from the
 army stables," he says, and you can hear the anger in his voice. "You
 will not be taken advantage of."

 A short time later, the commander returns with two new mounts, and they
 are glorious ones, far better than the pair here originally. You and Lu
 Jin bow to Rong Jue, and he returns the bow, saying nothing further
 about the incident.

 Do you make any further preparations?

 A: Select a weapon from the rack.
 B: Greet our opponents so that the combat begins with honor.
 C: I am ready for battle!

>a
 straight-edged jian and a pair of hook swords. Lu Jin takes the hook
 swords and flourishes them for a moment before nodding and hooking them
 into his belt. You choose a ji that is almost as weighty as one of
 Master Zhuge's guan dao and a jian that ends in a red tassel, which
 should catch your opponent's eyes as a distraction should the combat
 move to the ground.

 Do you make any additional preparations?

 A: Greet our opponents so that the combat begins with honor.
 B: I am ready for battle!

>a
 this, but you see no reason for your fight to begin without honor. You
 strike out across the field until Lu Jin grabs you by the wrist.

 "What are you doing?" he hisses.

 "Greeting our opponents," you say. "They may not wish to follow our
 customs, but we should represent the Middle Kingdom by beginning this
 fight with honor." Lu Jin sneers. "They are not worthy of such respect.
 Go on your own if you wish."

 You leave Lu Jin behind without further argument, walking to the other
 side of the arena and bowing in greeting to your opponents. The two
 armored fighters lift the visors of their helmets, and you see the
 light-skinned faces of two men younger than you are, but clearly
 skilled fighters or they would not be here.

 One of them asks the other a confused question, which the second
 answers with a smile. "Hello to you, too," he says to you, his accent
 quite competent for a foreigner. "Lovely day for a battle to the death,
 isn't it?"

 You smile politely. "Perhaps it will not come to that," you say
 serenely, imagining Abbot Bao's voice behind your words. "We look
 forward to seeing your skills on display and hope for an honorable
 competition."

 The warrior looks slightly embarrassed. "Yes, well, we look forward to
 seeing your skills, too," he says clumsily. "Honor and all that."

 The first warrior asks for a translation, and the two of them rattle
 back and forth for a minute, with the first warrior soon looking as
 sheepish as the second. "Nice to meet you," he says, haltingly, with a
 big smile. You bow again and return to your side of the field.

 The encounter seems rather suspicious, but you think that by crossing
 the field to greet them, you have inspired some real respect from your
 opponents, which can only work to your advantage.

 Do you make any additional preparations?

 A: I am ready for battle!

>a
 each other.

 "We will win," Lu Jin says confidently. You wonder whether he is
 reassuring himself or you.

 You tell Rong Jue that you are ready, and he gestures to one of the
 other soldiers. Suddenly, a drum call fills the arena, and you and Lu
 Jin, on horseback, are escorted to the dais. The two foreigners, also
 riding their horses, stop next to you, and the four of you wait as the
 Emperor's silk-enclosed litter is run up to the dais by his guards.
 They stop and lower the Emperor to the ground, where he watches from
 behind the thin curtains.

 George Gower and several members of the Imperial bureaucracy take their
 seats near the Emperor's litter. As everyone is settled, one of the
 magistrates calls out, "Let the Imperial Challenge begin!"

 The stands, full now of spectators, erupt in cheers. The foreign
 horsemen ride quickly back to their end of the arena. Rong Jue, who is
 providing your escort, hisses instructions to you.

 "The foreigners will ride the center of the field?they call it the
 pitch?with their lances," he says. "They are steel tipped and meant to
 kill. But they are accustomed to continuing on the pass, reaching the
 end, and turning around again, based on the practices I have watched.
 You're on the first pass?Lu Jin's second."

 He pulls away as you reach the end of the field. "Good luck!"

 What strategy do you use to face the foreigners?

 A: I am confident I can fight on horseback.
 B: I want to fight on the ground, and will aim to unhorse the rider.
 C: I can take a mounted fighter from the ground. I will get off the
 horse at the pass and attack unmounted.

>b
 rope divider. You can see your opponent's strategy: he is seated firmly
 in his saddle, weight forward, his lance balanced across the horse's
 neck so that his shield faces you. His attack is based on momentum, and
 clearly his customary rules expect you to stay where he will hit you.

 But one of the first rules of combat you learned was that if you are in
 a place where someone wants to hit you, don't be there. Move somewhere
 else and disrupt their offense to gain the advantage.

 How do you plan to unhorse your foe?

 A: I stand on the saddle and use my chi to leap onto his horse,
 dragging him to the ground.
 B: I command my horse to leap across the rope and swing my ji to attack
 on his unshielded side.
 C: My horse is stronger than I am; I speak to it in comforting words,
 letting it dart out of the way before it rears to kick my foe from his
 saddle.

>a
 As your opponent bears down on you, you crouch in the saddle, then you
 spring over his lance and tackle him. Your combined weight and the
 change in momentum send both of you toppling from the back of his
 horse. You land on top of him, allowing your full weight to crash into
 him before you roll off and spring to your feet. He clambers after you,
 moving faster than you'd have expected given the awkward weight of the
 armor, though still far slower than you. He draws his sword.

 Lu Jin's horse flies past yours, and you realize he is headed into his
 own part of the combat.

 Now that you and your foe are both on the ground, how do you attack?

 A: I will outlast him. That armor is heavy, and I can dance around him
 all day.
 B: I will make it look like I am giving him openings, leading him to
 overextend and throw himself off balance.
 C: I will disarm him?whether that means his weapon or his arm.

>b
 strike?and knowing when to combine those two elements to launch a
 surprise attack. You keep drawing your opponent into your range,
 deflecting his blows and keeping him off balance. Eventually, he
 overextends himself, and his lunge sends him stumbling forward. You
 strike him on the back of his helmet as he falls, and when you check
 him to receive his surrender, you find that he is sleeping
 peacefully?though he will likely have quite the headache in the
 morning.

 Across the field, Lu Jin and his opponent are still locked in battle.
 You hurry across the field to join them.

 By the time you reach Lu Jin, both Lu Jin and his opponent are on the
 ground, locked in a sword fight. The foreign warrior is relying on his
 armor to protect him from Lu Jin's blows, and for the most part, this
 strategy works, with Lu Jin's hook swords skittering off the steel. But
 his strikes are slow, and Lu Jin, though wounded, is dancing out of the
 way of his strikes. When Lu Jin sees you approach, however, his
 strategy changes. He darts around behind the armored warrior and hooks
 both of the warrior's arms in his hook swords.

 "Now!" Lu Jin yells at you.

 A: I am tough enough that I can deliver a knockout blow from beneath
 the helmet, despite the armor between me and my foe's chin.
 B: I deliver a piercing blow with the jian's tip through the hole in
 the helmet, killing him.
 C: I gather my chi and throw the energy at him with a shout,
 momentarily paralyzing him.

>c
 combat; you gather chi from the earth beneath you, cradling it in front
 of you until you hear a gasp from the spectators, indicating that they
 can see your chi ball as well. You thrust it at the armored fighter,
 and as the shock of the energy hits him, he collapses to the ground.
 You and Lu Jin stand together, both of your foes out of the fight, and
 as one, you face the dais and give a deep bow in the direction of the
 Emperor. The spectators cheer wildly in the stands, and the drums beat
 in a roll so constant that it sounds like a thunderstorm. The
 magistrate announces you as the winners and Imperial Champions, proving
 the fighters of the Middle Kingdom are superior. You and Lu Jin are
 once again escorted back to the Imperial palace, this time as heroes.

 But when you reach the palace, another group of soldiers are waiting
 for you. Rong Jue looks at them in confusion, but a soldier whose
 insignia shows a higher rank demands to take Lu Jin into custody.

 "By the Emperor's command, Lu Jin won his freedom,"Rong Jue says
 cautiously.

 The ranking officer shakes his head. "That was before it was discovered
 that the rebel coated his blade with poison," he accuses, and Lu Jin
 pales. He draws your jian from its sheath and you prepare to stop him
 from attacking the guards. But he does not lash out at them?instead, he
 stabs himself through the stomach, a deep wound that will bring about
 his death.

 "I die a free man," he says.

 "And an Imperial Champion," you say kindly. Your old rival's eyes
 flutter closed one last time, and his blood cascades like liquid ruby
 down the palace steps.

 Two days later, you are summoned before the Emperor. Though you are
 required to remain several steps back from the throne, the Emperor
 shows you his face, and bestows one of his rare smiles upon you.

 "Congratulations, my Imperial Champion," he says. "You have shown the
 Middle Kingdom that we have much to be proud of."

 He does not mention Lu Jin's tragic fate.

 "You are welcome in my Court," he says. "Let it be known throughout the
 Middle Kingdom that you are the empire's hero."

 The subsequent awards you receive of land and wealth to match your new
 status are almost secondary to that proclamation.

 You have learned, in all your years as a student, as a monk, and as a
 teacher that life contains surprises. Sometimes the thing that you most
 wanted is the thing most likely to set you back on the path to your
 goals. Sometimes those goals must be set aside to fully live the life
 in front of you. There are moments when you must simply be, existing in
 a time and space that will never again occur. Other times, you must
 act, fulfilling the role that has been placed before you. These are the
 thoughts that enter your mind as you travel with a group of the monks
 of the Order of the Peach Tree to Xiaxue Mountain.

 More than twenty years have passed since you first became a monk, and
 the Order is celebrating the hundredth year: the day when the Dragon
 Sage descends to the top of Xiaxue Mountain is almost here. You are
 among the candidates to be chosen to greet the Dragon and ask a
 question.

 A: I may be eligible, but I am happy with my life. I would rather
 someone else ask the Sage a question than risk a life-changing event.
 B: I am still concerned about issues of this world, and know that the
 Dragon Sage will have the answers I crave.
 C: I have led a good life, but I am ready to leave everything behind if
 that is what the Dragon Sage requires.

>c
 from Master Shen so long ago, do not worry over the past or fear the
 future: exist in the moment. If you are the one chosen to question the
 Dragon Sage, you will do the Order proud. And thankfully, you came to
 terms with your eligibility just in time. Abbot Bao, who has traveled
 with the group of monks, draws you aside.

 "Zhuge Meili, you have proven yourself to be honorable, and you have
 gained the respect of the Middle Kingdom. The Order has chosen you to
 represent us in speaking to the Dragon Sage. Will you accept this task
 on our behalf?"

 You bow solemnly, as the occasion requires. "Yes," you say, and are
 pleased with the clarity of your voice in this important moment.

 Abbot Bao returns your bow. Then he surprises you by clapping you on
 both shoulders and looking at you with tears at the corners of his
 eyes.

 "You have made me proud, my student," he says.

 Emotion threatens to overwhelm you as well, but instead you heft your
 climbing gear on your shoulder, squeeze the old abbot's hand, and begin
 your climb up the mountain.

 Though monks have been climbing Xiaxue for centuries, the path is a
 difficult one. You think back to something Master Zhuge once told you
 about mountain climbing?that it is important to think only of the next
 step, and that soon you will reach the top?and it makes you smile. You
 wonder now where the Veiled Dragon may be, and whether she is still
 writing poetry.

 You think for a moment that you see a flash of red?like the tail of a
 fox?against the mountain snow, but when you look, it is gone.

 The way is cold, and the air is thin, but you go at a steady pace, and
 the activity keeps your body warm. You reach a large cave near the
 peak, which provides you with shelter against the wind, just as you see
 a thin shape spiraling down from the Heavens. Though the sky is covered
 in clouds, every once in a while, light catches off the yellow scales
 of the Dragon Sage, who grows larger with every heartbeat. The dragon's
 head is like a camel; its legs end in paws like a tiger's, with each
 toe capped in an eagle's claw. As it comes closer, you see its belly is
 like a clam, its neck is like a snake, and on its head are cow's ears,
 deer's horns, and demon eyes. The Dragon Sage descends, and its scales
 remind you of those of a carp, catching the glimmer of sunlight through
 the clouds as a fish's scales gleam beneath the water's surface. You
 had heard all of these qualities before?scholars have catalogued dragon
 bodies down to the number of scales?but seeing the combination in
 person is breathtaking.

 As the Dragon Sage lands next to you, you find yourself holding your
 breath in awe. The dragon chuckles. "Greetings, monk," it says, in a
 voice that sounds like the rumble of thunder. You can feel it vibrate
 in your chest. "The time has come for you to ask me a question."

 The moment has come. Long ago, you chose a question, but many years
 have passed, and you have grown and changed. With what you now know
 about the world and what you know about yourself, what question will
 you ask?

 A: How can I become the greatest warrior in the world?
 B: How can the Empire return to Heaven's Favor?
 C: What is the first question?
 D: Why do kites fly?

>c
 your reflection dancing in them. "I have waited for a long time for
 someone to ask that question," it rumbles.

 The shared gaze becomes something like the mental combats you have
 practiced, but this is no fight, no challenge of wills. It is an
 invitation, and at once, you see the questions that the Dragon Sage has
 been asked over the years. You begin to understand what wisdom can be
 found in asking questions?and in listening to what is asked?rather than
 in simple answers. The knowledge floods you until you feel as though
 you are overflowing, pouring out of your body because it cannot contain
 the vast stores of wisdom you are receiving. All the questions that
 have ever been asked flow through you and around you like water.

 When the flood ends, you realize that your reflection in the Dragon
 Sage's eyes shows the head of a camel, with the antlers of a deer and
 yellow scales that shimmer in the sunlight. The Dragon Sage in front of
 you begins to shimmer and dissolve into light. And you know that in a
 hundred years, you will return to this cave to answer the question of
 another monk.

 And in listening to that question, you will learn something more about
 wisdom.

 The Dragon Sage has returned to the Heavens.

 If you had it to do all over again, what question would you ask?

 A: Play again.
 B: Play more games like this.
 C: Share this game with friends.
