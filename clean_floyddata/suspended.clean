 HP: The Complex was started on this terraformed planet to provide the
 surface-side dwellers with a simpler, easier life. The Complex was
 built 122 years after the planet was settled, and was designed to
 operate on its own, with human intervention required only by emergency
 situations.

 receptors, placed within the complex at its inception.

 IRIS: Internal map reference -- Main Supply Room
 I'm in the northernmost portion of a large, messy area where debris is
 scattered about as if something had shaken it loose from the walls.
 Sitting near the wall is a machine which has a little orange button on
 its face. Beside the button are two small sockets, one red and one
 yellow. A red IC sits in the red socket, and a yellow IC sits in the
 yellow socket. The front panel is open and a fourteen-inch cable of
 orange wire is exposed. A small glass fuse it sits in the panel. On the
 front panel is a series of eight circles. The orange button is
 flashing.
 In the room with me is Poet.
 There is a fried chip here.
 There is a burned chip here.

 POET INTERRUPT: As much as I can be anyplace, I'm here at the Main
 Supply Room.

>examine poet
 I see Poet as a misguided robot, wandering about this complex in an
 abnormal manner even for him. There are two extensions which have flat
 plates on them which could be used for something, though Poet never
 communicated their purpose to me. Like the rest of us, Poet is about 1
 meter tall.

>waldo, go to iris
 FC: Cryolink established to Waldo.
 FC: Iris's location: Main Supply Room. Establishing path...
 WALDO: I'm on my way. Expect a report on arrival.

 As the door swings open you are blinded by intense light and incredible
 pain. Just before everything overloads and you fade from existence, you
 can make out the shapes of three humans, one of them holding onto the
 door of the cylinder, another of them looking exactly like you, and
 then everything goes dark.

 Internal map reference -- Main Supply Room
 I'm in the northernmost portion of a large, messy area where debris is
 scattered about as if something had shaken it loose from the walls.
 Sitting near the wall is a machine which has a little orange button on
 its face. Beside the button are two small sockets, one red and one
 yellow. A red IC sits in the red socket, and a yellow IC sits in the
 yellow socket. The front panel is open and a fourteen-inch cable of
 orange wire is exposed. A small glass fuse it sits in the panel. On the
 front panel is a series of eight circles. The orange button is
 flashing.

 I'm in the northernmost portion of a large, messy area where debris is

 Sitting near the wall is a machine which has a little orange button on

 yellow. A red IC sits in the red socket, and a yellow IC sits in the

 in the following order: white five-inch cable; twenty-inch blue cable;
 black nineteen-inch cable; and empty. The cables are actually exposed
 sections of larger cables. They each terminate at a connector. The
 connector itself poses no problem and, from what I can see, easy
 replacement should be possible.

 Internal map reference -- Main Supply Room
 I'm in the northernmost portion of a large, messy area where debris is
 scattered about as if something had shaken it loose from the walls.
 Sitting near the wall is a machine which has a little orange button on
 its face. Beside the button are two small sockets, one red and one
 yellow. The red socket is empty as is the yellow socket. The front
 panel is open and a fourteen-inch cable of orange wire is exposed. A
 small glass fuse it sits in the panel. On the front panel is a series
 of eight circles.
 In the room with me is Sensa.
 Sensa is carrying a fried chip, a burned chip, and a little wire
 basket.

   Current surface casualties: 5,632,000
   Projected casualties during recovery: 865,000
   Original population: 30,172,000
   Total possible survivors: 23,675,000

 This score gives you the possibility of being considered for being
 burned in effigy. On a scale of 1 (the best) to 7 (the worst), your
 ranking was 7.

 You successfully completed your task, bringing the Filtering Computers
 back into balance, in 220 cycles.

 WARNING! Biochemical electrical activity dropping!
 As the door swings open you are blinded by intense light and incredible
 pain. Just before everything overloads and you fade from existence, you
 can make out a shape outside, holding onto the door of the cylinder,
 and then everything goes dark.
