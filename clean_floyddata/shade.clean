 <span class="floydstyle subheader">White Cube</span>
 This room surrounds you with white foam boards, each three metres long
 and three metres wide. It is rather hot in here.

 A panel is located on the south wall.

>examine me


 Without a mirror, you can't get a good look at yourself

>inventory


 You are carrying nothing.

 You feel mildly warm.

>examine panel


 The panel is small and rectangular, attached firmly to the wall. It
 has red and blue buttons on it's face.

>examine blue button


 The blue button has an image of a snowflake on it, as well as being
 blue.

>examine red button


 The red button has an image of a flame on it, as well as being red.

 You start to sweat in the sweltering heat.

>press blue button


 As you push the blue button, sparks fly out, jolting you backwards
 against the northen wall, knocking you out. The panel may be damaged.
 You should see if it broke or something.
 When you come to, you feel a cool gust of air hitting you in the face.
 You feel relieved.

>examine panel


 The panel is small and rectangular. It has black burn marks all over
 it's face. It sticks out a bit from the wall.

 A brown tuber with spots. You wonder what it is doing here.

>examine spots

 [Previous turn undone.]

>get potato


 You already have that.

>eat it


 You don't know why, but your psyche is preventing you from eating the
 potato.

 The room starts to rumble.  Turbulence, perhaps?

 Suddenly, the White Cube you are in vanishes to reveal that you were
 in the Holodeck all along. You silently curse at whoever it was who
 put you here, ran the program and turned the safety precautions off.
 You could have died!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Holodeck</span>
 The walls of this room are filled with a yellow grid on a black
 background. This room is used to simulate events using holograms.
 There is a door located north.

>examine grid


 The yellow grid criss-crosses across the whole room. You wonder why
 they chose such a poor design for this room.

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a potato

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor 2B</span>
 This corridor is one of many in the giant maze that is this ship. Red

 Red lights. It must signify something, but you do not know what.

>listen


 You hear nothing unexpected.

>go east



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor 2C</span>
 This corridor, just like the one you were just on earlier, is one of
 many in the giant maze that is this ship. Red lights are currently
 blinking, and a concurrent beeping noise sounds. The corridor
 continues east and west. A set of doors lie north.

>open doors


 The doors on this ship are automatic. They only open while you are
 walking through it.

>go north



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Darkness</span>
 It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

 You remember, however, that the exit is south.

>go south

 into anyone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shuttle Bay</span>
 This large room is where shuttles are stored, but you can only see a
 small one here at the moment. The door to enter the room lies north,
 while a gigantic door is on the wall east. A pile of tools lie
 discarded in the corner and a lever sticks up from the ground. A power
 infuser is in the west wall.

>examine tools


 A pile of discarded tools. They don't look useful at all.

>examine lever


 (Lever)
 A big lever is built into the floor. Why would anyone in their right
 mind (save for mad scientists) design a room this way?

>examine power


 The power infuser is basically just a charger that can power devices.
 It resides in a small hole in the western wall.

>plug potato in power


 You put the potato in the power infuser and it begins its work.

 After a few moments, the potato catches fire! The fire then slowly
 sets the rest of the room on fire, and you along with it. You roast in
 the flames.

 Which do you mean, shuttle bay door, the giant shuttle bay door or
 Small Shuttle?

>small


 You get inside the shuttle.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Small Shuttle</span>
 The shuttle as small as you had thought it would be. A window looks
 out into the shuttle bay, while beneath that is a console.

>examine console


 A random (or so you think) assortment of buttons, switches and levers.
 You have no idea what any of them do.

>push button


 You pull some levers, push some buttons and flip some switches
 randomly. Suddenly, the ship starts to rise! You must have activated
 the autopilot! At long last, you can finally start your epic space
 adventure!

 The shuttle abruptly descends and lands back on the ground. It must be
 unable to find a way out of the shuttle bay, what with the giant doors
 being closed and all. If you got them opened, however...

 You don't know why, but your psyche is preventing you from eating the
 potato.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Four rounds have gone by. You and the red robot have remained neck and
 neck for the lead, with two wins each. The robot that emerges
 victorious in the fifth round will become Champion of Robotic Boxing,
 with all the praise and adulation that title implies.

 Also, you get a pretty sweet endorsement deal from a leading gear
 manufacturer.

 The final round is about to begin. Get out there and win!

 Release 1 / Serial number 050209 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11 SD

 Round Five
 You are standing in the ring of one of the greatest robot boxing
 stadiums in the entire world. Thousands of screaming fans have packed
 the arena to see your match. It's time for the fight to end it all.

 The red robot stares at you intently.

>about
 I wrote this "game" mostly for the sake of learning the Inform
 programming language. It was coded during the end of January and the
 beginning of February, 2005. There are 8 ways to end the game. Try to
 collect them all (without reading the AMUSING)!

 Randolph Wang (for coming up with the idea in the first place)

>examine me
 A few dents and dings from the previous rounds mar your gleaming blue
 exterior.

 A man in the audience yells, "Knock his block off, Red!"

>examine red
 The red robot is the reigning champ of robotic boxing. No one expected
 you to hold your own against him, but you're no pushover; you've given
 him a run for his money.

 The crowd holds its breath in anticipation of your next moves.

>hit block
 You can't see any such thing.

>knock his block off
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>hit red
 You have to wait for the match to start, or else you'll be
 disqualified.

 The audience roars with approval.

>examine audience
 The audience is packed into every available seat in the stadium, with
 plenty more sitting in the aisles. They're watching you intently, and
 making quite a commotion.

 The bell rings! The match has started!

 A woman seated behind you yells, "Go Blue! Kill that red bastard!"

>hit red
 You land a devastating blow on the red robot's jaw!
 The red robot lands a vicious uppercut on your jaw!

 A man in the audience yells, "Knock his block off, Red!"

>hit jaw
 You can't see any such thing.

>hit red
 You land a spectacular roundhouse on the red robot's jaw!
 The red robot lands a devastating blow on your jaw!

 A little girl in the front row bellows with rage. "The robot requires
 additional pummeling! Continue!"

>pump robot
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>jab robot
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>hit red
 The red robot parries your blow!
 You parry the red robot's blow!

 The audience roars with approval.

>hit red
 You land a devastating blow on the red robot's jaw!

 You deal the final blow to the red robot, sending his head flying
 upwards. You wouldn't think it possible if you couldn't hear it, but
 the crowd begins to cheer even more loudly than before. The red
 robot's manager looks on in horror, quickly jumping into the ring to
 push his client's head back into place.

 You're quickly ushered out of the arena and to safety as the fans
 begin to mob the ring. You're taken to a waiting limo. Your manager is
 already waiting inside, grinning broadly.

 "Nice work, Blue. I had faith in you the entire time." You try to
 thank him, but he's too excited to listen. "I just got off the phone
 with a few contacts of mine -- y'know, in the breakfast gears business
 and stuff -- and it's lookin' very good for you. I tell you, a match
 this big, you'll be gettin' the biggest endorsement deal there ever
 was. We're both going to be rich! Let's go out to celebrate!"

     *** Your opponent's head has popped up ***


 In that game you scored 99 out of a possible 100, in 8 turns.

>lose
 You make only a token effort to defend yourself, allowing the red
 robot to pop your head up. It may not be a glorious way to go, but it
 is profitable. Your manager bet a ton of cash on the red robot, and
 you'll get your share of it, fair and square. There's a nice sprocket
 you've had your eyes on for a while, maybe a lube job.

 On your way out of the stadium, you are stopped by a small child.
 "Why'd you lose, Blue? You never lose like that. You can't have lost
 like that."

 Your ears burn with shame. "Shut up, kid!" you shout. You run to your
 waiting limo, and seat yourself. When did it even come to this, you
 think to yourself. I used to be a champ, and now I'm just trash. You
 bury your face in your hands and sob.

 The red robot, overcome by your faith, falls to the floor as well, his

 Luke 6:29, 'And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also
 the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy
 coat also'?"

 Your faith moves the crowd, who all drop to their knees as well and
 pray for salvation from Jesus Christ. The show of faith and brotherly
 love causes you to weep openly. You embrace the red robot. "Let's go

     *** SHADE ***
 A brief story by "Ampe R. Sand" (Andrew Plotkin)
 First-time players should type "about".
 Release 3 / Serial number 001127 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10

 Odd, how the light just makes your apartment gloomier. Pre-dawn
 darkness pools in the corners and around the tops of walls. Your desk
 lamp glares yellow, but the shadows only draw your eyes and deepen.

 Not much of an apartment, no. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty
 computer shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on
 a cardboard crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the
 other, with a closet to the side. A broad mirror tries to make the
 place seem twice its size; it halfway works. One window, whose shade
 is down, and the front door firmly shut.

 Your luggage is piled untidily by the door. A potted hyacinth sits
 beneath the window.

 You are sprawled on the futon, staring up into that gloom. Your eyes
 feel gritty. But it's too late -- early -- no time left for sleep,
 anyway. In a few hours your ride will arrive.

 On the desk are your to-do list and a travel book.

>about
 This is a one-room game set in your apartment. ...But perhaps you've
 already gathered that.

 SHADE mostly uses the standard vocabulary of interactive fiction. You
 may find the command "find..." (or "where is...") convenient, though
 not critically important.

 SHADE is copyright 2000 by Andrew Plotkin (erkyrath@eblong.com). He
 began coding it on the morning of September 2, 2000, and raced like
 the wind to finish it in time for the Sixth Annual IF Competition.
 (SHADE placed tenth, which is pretty darn good, considering the
 overall excellence of the entries that year.) For more IF by the same
 author, see


 SHADE may be distributed for free, but not sold or included in any
 for-profit collection without written permission from the author.

 All hail the beta-tester: Michael Kinyon (still inevitable after all
 these years). And the people who sent bug reports after the
 competition, who include (but are not limited to): Ross Presser,
 Gunther Schmidl, Matthew Murray, Joe Mason, Nick Wolfe, Caleb Wilson,
 Neil Cerutti, Jason McIntosh, Daryl McCullough, Lelah Conrad, Jeff
 Hall. And -- this game is dedicated to Meatball Fulton.

>examine list
 You won't accomplish much while slumped on the futon. That's been
 getting slowly more apparent for hours now.

>stand
 You lever yourself upright. Umf. It's amazing how much lack of sleep
 feels like a hangover, only without the preceding party.

>examine list
 You sit down at the desk.

 The task list for your impending journey is a mess of crossed-out
 items and scribbled corrections. However, everything seems to have
 gotten done. The last line reads "Call taxi", and it has its
 checkmark, and here you wait.

 Come to think of it, as with a hangover, dehydration is probably the
 problem. Your mouth is dry wool.

>go north
 You paced enough last night.

>look
 You glance around. The desk is, of course, an organized mess;
 overlapping piles of paper, inches high. The computer is a dusty beige
 block, several generations out of date, poking up hopefully from among
 the strata. The lamp hangs over all.

 A game-over message is flashing on the screen.

 You see your to-do list and a travel book on the desk.

 Behind you, the futon takes up most of the apartment. A second-hand
 stereo sits on a cardboard crate. A kitchen nook one way and a
 bathroom nook the other, with a closet to the side. A broad mirror
 tries to make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works. One
 window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

 The place is still too dim, except the corner where the desk lamp is
 somehow too bright.

 Your luggage is piled untidily by the door. A potted hyacinth sits
 beneath the window.

>enter kitchen
 You stand up, and step into the kitchen nook.

>look
 You survey your one small room. The kitchen alcove has a refrigerator,
 a sink, a stove, and barely enough space to stand between them. One
 wall projects out to form a counter, with a cupboard beneath it.

 On the counter is a glass.

 The rest of the place is mostly filled by your futon, and the computer
 desk in the corner. The bathroom alcove is across from you, and the
 closet next to it. The stereo sits on a cardboard crate. A broad
 mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works.
 One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

>examine glass
 An ordinary drinking glass.

 You're still feeling thirsty.

>get glass
 Taken.

>fill glass
 You step out of the kitchen nook, and step into the bathroom nook.

 The faucet rattles, and water dribbles into the glass.

>drink glass
 You gulp the water. It feels vaguely astringent in your mouth,
 unsatisfying. Well, no doubt thirst will be more real after you fly to
 California --

>drop glass
 Dropped (in the bathroom nook).

 -- Fly? Where did you leave your plane tickets?

>out
 You step out of the bathroom nook.

 You hate this feeling. It happens all the time. Something safely
 accomplished, and then pow, you have to worry about it again. Unfair!
 The tickets must be here somewhere.

>find tickets
 You can't see any such thing.

>where is ticket
 You can't see any such thing.

 You see your to-do list and a travel book on the desk.

>search
 What do you want to search?

>desk
 You sit down at the desk.

 You carefully tilt up piles of paper, trying to avoid an avalanche.
 Nope. The tickets aren't there.

>search papers
 You carefully tilt up piles of paper, trying to avoid an avalanche.
 The plane tickets still aren't there.

>search book
 The Schmendrick's Guide to Desert Camping -- you've been studying it
 for weeks now. Vast alien reams of information: perspiration rates,
 sunburn factors, tent guying, and how to make a condensation still out
 of a trashbag and a tin can. You could probably write the book out
 longhand from memory; and none of it means a damn thing to you.

 (That's why you're going on this trip, after all. It is, of course,
 the Death Valley Om -- half arts festival, half cult, a week in the
 deep desert where people show off, have sex, take drugs, and maintain
 a twenty-four-hour constant OM. Sand, heat, and thousands of throats.
 A space outside the world; with no dues except that you join in the
 chant, as much as is in you to chant.)

>chant
 This is no place for that.

 In the bathroom nook you can see a glass.

>search luggage
 You stand up.

 You quickly pop open each suitcase and riffle through, trying not to
 disarrange your tidy packing too badly. Nope. The tickets aren't
 there.

>examine hyacinth
 This plant is your one claim to actual responsibility. The hyacinth
 sits by the window, soaking up sunlight (when it's not night) and
 managing to thrive despite your lack of gardening skill. Although it
 looks a little parched at the moment.

>enter bathroom
 You step into the bathroom nook.

>get glass
 Taken.

>open shade
 Darkness is already crawling around the edges of the windowshade. You
 have no desire to look night in the face.

>examine shade
 The shade is a white plastic sheet -- more yellowing, maybe. One of
 those roller mechanisms that never quite works. The shade is pulled
 down against the pre-dawn gloom.

>look
 You survey your one small room. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty
 computer shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on
 a cardboard crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the

>examine computer
 You sit down at the desk.

 The computer is years old, and incompatible with just about everything
 but electricity. You use it for writing -- at least, you try to
 believe that you do.

 Right now, however, there's a game on the screen -- one of the text
 adventures, or interactive fictions, or whatever they are this month
 -- the only kind of game your beige antique can run, anyway.

 The you-have-died message is blinking morosely at you. You started up
 Ready, Okay! last night, trying to distract yourself until morning.
 But you can't get even halfway through without running out of insulin.

 It's not a walk-in closet. It's barely even a reach-in closet.

 The closet (if you can call it that) is a shallow recess next to the
 bathroom. Peering into the (ahem) depths, you see an old jacket and a
 vacuum cleaner.

 There are none at all available!

>get vacuum
 Taken. (Awkwardly.)

>examine vacuum
 The vacuum cleaner is a "luggable" model -- meaning that it's awkward
 to carry, but too small to be really efficient. Fortunately, you don't
 generate a lot of dust.

>turn on vacuum
 You squeeze the handle, and the vacuum cleaner begins humming
 industriously. You run it back and forth on the floor for a few
 moments. It doesn't make much difference, but you feel tidy.

 You don't need your old jacket.

 There is nothing on your futon.

>examine futon
 The futon is definitely on the downhill side of life's rolling knolls.
 It serves as both couch and bed, if inadequately in each case, which
 makes it the most important piece of furniture you own.

>look under futon
 You bend down, and see dust and assorted minor trash under the futon.
 Nothing unusual.

 You know it's empty.

>search floor
 You find nothing of interest.

>search bathroom
 The bathroom alcove has a toilet, a sink, and a shower stall that
 manages to make the rest of the place look roomy. Not much else; most
 of your accoutrements have been packed.

>search kitchen
 The kitchen alcove has a refrigerator, a sink, a stove, and barely
 enough space to stand between them. One wall projects out to form a
 counter, with a cupboard beneath it.

>examine stareo
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine stereo
 The stereo is old, dating from the era when matte-black, featureless,

 The stereo buzzes, hunts, and then locates its station. Ah, your
 favorite small-time indy worldbeat/techno station. At least you think
 that's what they call it. It's a pretty stream-of-consciousness
 format.

 The room fills with the sound of a reggae-electronic song.

 It's yellow. Beyond that, it looks like every other refrigerator in
 the United States.

>open refrigerator
 You open the refrigerator, revealing a jar of peanut butter.

>get jar
 Taken.

>examine stove
 The usual electric range arrangement. Weirdly, there is no oven in
 your kitchen. You don't know what lurks in the space beneath the
 stove. You've been afraid to pry -- the stove might turn out to be
 powered by radioactive decay, or something.

>pry stove
 That's not a verb I recognize.

 The sun hasn't risen; what light you have would just leak out into the

>examine list
 You sit down at the desk.

 The task list for your impending journey is a mess of crossed-out

 coat pocket? Could they have gotten packed accidentally?

>search jacket
 You stand up.

 You root through the jacket's myriad pockets. Nope. The tickets aren't

 You squeeze the handle, and the vacuum cleaner begins humming

 You try to close the casing, but sand has worked into the joints. You

 "More allegations of campaign finance misconduct..." (Oh, fascinating

 The vacuum cleaner can't be started while it's open. Not that it looks
 likely to work in any case, now.

 "Sharp words between the superpowers today..." (Huh? There are still
 superpowers?)

 The vacuum cleaner's innards are packed with sand. You can't imagine
 how it got that way.

 "Three people reported missing at the Death Valley Om in

 State police are searching the area." (You resolve to read that desert

 The top tears away, and white sand sprays out of the box.

>open jar
 You unscrew the lid... with an unexpected grating sound. Something

 The peanut butter jar is full of sand.

 This is getting to be too much. You consider which of your friends

 It's yellow. Beyond that, it looks like every other refrigerator in
 the United States. The fridge is open but empty.

>look
 You survey your one small room. The kitchen alcove has a refrigerator,
 a sink, a stove, and barely enough space to stand between them. One
 wall projects out to form a counter, with a cupboard beneath it.

 The cupboard is open and bare. The fridge is open but empty.

 The rest of the place is mostly filled by your futon, and the computer
 desk in the corner. The bathroom alcove is across from you, and the
 closet next to it. The stereo sits on a cardboard crate. A broad
 mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works.
 One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

 The place is still too dim, except the corner where the desk lamp is
 somehow too bright.

 Your luggage is piled untidily by the door. A potted spider plant sits
 beneath the window.

 On the desk are your to-do list and a travel book.

 You can see an inch of sand lying in the living room.

>examine spider
 This plant is your one claim to actual responsibility. The spider
 plant sits by the window, soaking up sunlight (when it's not night)
 and managing to thrive despite your lack of gardening skill. Although
 it looks very dry.

 The radio begins playing a thumping Nigerian tune.

 The fridge door swings shut.

>examine list
 You step out of the kitchen nook, and sit down at the desk.

 The task list for your impending journey is a mess of crossed-out
 items and scribbled corrections. Dammit, yet another item you missed
 -- you have to water the plant.

>stand
 You stand up.

>enter bathroom
 You step into the bathroom nook.

>fill glass
 With an eerie hiss, dry white sand boils from the faucet. You yank at
 the tap, but the bathroom sink is already full, and sand spilling on
 the floor.

>look
 You survey your one small room. The bathroom alcove has a toilet, a
 sink, and a shower stall that manages to make the rest of the place
 look roomy. Not much else; most of your accoutrements have been
 packed.

 You see a trace of sand lying here.

 The rest of the place is mostly filled by your futon, and the computer
 desk in the corner. The kitchen alcove is across from you, and the
 closet just to one side. The stereo sits on a cardboard crate. A broad

 One window, whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

>examine shower
 The shower stall is a familiar symphony in pinkish-grey tile and
 grunge. Well, more of a solo. A short solo.

 The radio begins playing a haunting Andean song.

>open shower
 The shower curtain has become a daily ritual of annoyance. It's too
 small. It cannot, no matter how you tug at it, actually cover the
 shower stall. You've managed to arrange the curtain so that the
 minimal amount of water splashes onto the bathroom floor when you
 shower, and that's where you leave it.

>l in shower
 The shower stall is a familiar symphony in pinkish-grey tile and
 grunge. Well, more of a solo. A short solo.

>turn on shower
 You turn the tap... and nothing happens. Hmm. The shower was working
 last night. You knew the pipes in your apartment were unreliable, but
 this is worse than usual.

>examine toilet
 Surely you know what a toilet looks like.

>fill glass
 You scoop up a glassful of sand.

 The radio mumbles, "This is, um, one-oh-three... kay-tee-oh-whoa...
 your source for interworldbeat..." You can practically hear the bong
 gurgling in the background. After a moment, a haunting Hmong melody
 begins playing.

>out
 You step out of the bathroom nook.

>pour sand on spider
 Which do you mean, the sand on the living room floor, the sand on the
 bathroom floor, the sand in the bathroom sink, the jarful of sand, the
 boxful of sand or the glassful of sand?

>glassful
 Sand will do that no good.

>xlist
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine list
 You sit down at the desk.

 The task list for your impending journey is a mess of crossed-out
 items and scribbled corrections. In the middle of the page, you see:
   - clean out closet
   - buy stereo stand
   - don't leave stove on

>clean out closet
 Just "clean". And the parser apologizes for not being smarter about
 this.

>clean closet
 Just "clean". When you clean, it's pretty much cleaning the whole
 area.

>clean
 You can't use the vacuum cleaner while sitting.

>close cleaner
 You try to close the casing, but sand has worked into the joints. You
 can't get it fully closed, even when you whack it.

 The radio begins playing a Balto-Andean tune.

>joints
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>enter kitchen
 You stand up, and step into the kitchen nook.

>turn on stove
 You turn the knob -- click. Then the stove emits a loud crackle. The
 burner frosts white, although you can feel the heat radiating from it;
 bits of its substance seem to be flaking away. Thermal shock? you have
 time to think. And then the entire burner arrangement slumps into
 white sand, which runs down off the stove.

>look
 You survey your one small room. The kitchen alcove has a refrigerator,

 The radio begins playing a Hispano-Korean chant.

>turn on computer
 You sit down at the desk.

 The computer is already on.

>examine computer
 The computer is years old, and incompatible with just about everything
 but electricity. You use it for writing -- at least, you try to
 believe that you do.

 The you-have-died message is blinking morosely at you. You started up
 Ready, Okay! last night, trying to distract yourself until morning.
 But you can't get even halfway through without running out of insulin.

>type on computer
 You've tried everything you can think of twice, and you're tired of
 trying. Maybe an idea will come to you later.

 The radio begins playing an Antarcto-Japanese melody.

>enter closet
 The closet is closed.

>open closet
 You stand up.

 You reach for the knob; then hesitate; then reach again.

 You might as well not have bothered. The closet door bursts off its
 hinges before you can touch it. You leap back, barely avoiding the
 cracking plywood as it smashes to the floor, buried in the torrent of
 sand that is pouring out of the closet.

 After a few seconds, the room is still again.

>look
 You survey your one small room. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty
 computer shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on
 a cardboard crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the
 other, with a closet to the side. A broad mirror tries to make the
 place seem twice its size; it halfway works. One window, whose shade

 The Schmendrick's Guide to the Desert -- you've been studying it for

 silence, sounds of heat and sunlight, the feel of vast distances on
 your skin, and death. It sounds beautiful.

>examine list
 The task list for your impending journey is a mess of crossed-out
 items and scribbled corrections. In the middle of the page, you see:
   - buy stereo stand

>examine cardboard
 The crate your computer arrived in. It's dented and disreputable now,
 but still serves the time-honored purpose of holding your stereo up.

 The radio begins playing a rhythmic Maori tune.

>get cardboard
 You barely touch it, and the heavy cardboard abruptly tears. Sand
 pours out across the living room floor. The stereo sags; in moments,
 the crate is reduced to paper rags, which are immediately buried in
 the sand.

>look
 You glance around. The desk is, of course, an organized mess;
 overlapping piles of paper, inches high. The computer is a dusty beige
 block, several generations out of date, poking up hopefully from among
 the strata. The lamp hangs over all.

 A game-over message is flashing on the screen.

 You see your to-do list and a travel book on the desk.

 Behind you, the futon takes up most of the apartment. A second-hand
 stereo sits on the sandy floor. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom
 nook the other, with a closet to the side. A broad mirror tries to
 make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works. One window,
 whose shade is down, and the front door firmly shut.

 You feel nothing unexpected.

 The radio begins playing an Antarcto-Shaker melody.

>flush toilet
 The toilet? Yes, it's the toilet's turn! You press the handle,
 grinning maniacally. And indeed, the sand rushes down the sides of the
 bowl; the shining porcelain itself crazes, cracks, and veils to the
 bathroom floor. The toilet is a pedestal, a stump, a mere pile of
 sand. Gone.

>turn on shower
 You turn the tap, and -- no surprise now -- dry sand floods from the
 showerhead. Shielding your eyes from the spray, you reach to turn the
 tap back off.

 A creaking from above warns you. You leap back as the plaster cracks
 overhead, and whiteness roars down.

 When silence returns, the entire far end of the bathroom is a blank
 slope of sand.

 A faint creaking comes from the bathroom ceiling.

>out
 You step out of the bathroom nook.

 With a muffled crack the bathroom ceiling gives way. Broken plaster
 and rusty pipes tumble down as you stare. And down comes the sand, a
 dry white rushing river, hissing, shrieking. In moments the bathroom
 is lost to your sight.

>examine list
 You sit down at the desk.

 white, shivers, and explodes into sand. All right!

 A faint creaking comes from the kitchen ceiling.

 alcove is lost to your sight.

>search desk
 You sit down at the desk.

 You carefully tilt up piles of paper, trying to avoid an avalanche.
 Yes, sand is scattered beneath.

 Carefully? You shove a paper-stack off the desk; it's a shower of sand
 before it hits the ground. Ha! You push another, and another, and then
 sweep the whole mass over the edge. White sand cascades everywhere.
 Laughing, you feel the desk itself give way.

 Pop. Oops. That was the light bulb imploding. The apartment is very
 dark and quiet of a sudden.

 You can see a travel book, your to-do list and hills of sand here.

   (That last entry in a hasty, nervous script.)

 You hear a car approaching outside.

 The radio begins playing a reggae-Manx melody.

>examine taxi

 And if you see no taxi outside? What then? ...but the angry honking
 comes again. You yank hard on the windowshade, and it whips up as
 violently.


 Blazing daylight floods the room.

>examine taxi
 You can't see any such thing.

>look
 Sunlight cuts across the room like hot butter, blazing from the
 window. The room is nearly barren now; walls and ceiling are blank,
 but for the window, the closed front door, and the full-length mirror
 across from them.

 The futon sits alone in the center of the room. Next to it, askew on a
 pile of sand, rests the faithful old stereo.

 The computer has survived somehow, and lies in a pile of sand. A
 potted cactus sits beneath the window.

 You can see a travel book, your to-do list and hills of sand here.

 You look into the mirror. The far side is just as bright as this one.
 With the sunlight behind you, only your own face is in shadow -- the
 walls, the door, your furniture, are all full-lit. Beyond your
 reflection and the window-frame, the street outside, the houses and
 trees, are all --

 The street outside?

 You spin around.




 Odd, how the sunlight just makes your apartment more prosaic.

 Not much of an apartment, no. One desk, paper-piled, with a dusty
 computer shoved to the side. Your futon. Second-hand stereo sitting on
 a cardboard crate. A kitchen nook one way and a bathroom nook the
 other, with a closet to the side. A broad mirror tries to make the
 place seem twice its size; it halfway works. One window, whose shade

 "Death Val... hikers... missing for... still... hope, say..."

 ...Old news. You hit the switch: click. The stereo falls silent, turns
 white, and drops instantly away into sand.

>look
 The land is nearly barren. Dunes roll away towards the rising sun; a
 little shade trails behind them, but that will soon be gone. The sky
 is flat and empty blue.

 Your computer squats complacently, the color of the sand.

 You can see a travel book here.

>turn off computer
 "The only way to win is not to play," flashes the screen. You roll
 your eyes. The oldest lie; nobody's bought it since ever.

 You hit the power key; the computer gives a tiny sigh and crumbles
 away.

 A tiny figure burrows out of the new-fallen sand. It darts one way,
 then the other; but there is no more shelter.

 The figure closes its eyes for a few seconds.

>examine figure
 A tiny human figure walks across the sand. It doesn't seem to notice
 you.

>get figure
 You cup your palms around the figure and raise it into the air -- a
 human shape fallen to its knees in your handful of sand. You gaze
 down; sunlight seethes in the cauldron of your fingers. The figure
 slowly slides flat. But the sand is running out of your hands, and the
 figure falls to the ground, where it slowly pulls itself up again.

>figure, hi
 As you speak, currents of air curl across the sand. The figure
 clutches its clothing about itself and staggers on, ignoring you.

 The figure moves more slowly now.

>look

 is flat and empty blue.

 A tiny figure inches across the sand.

 You can see a travel book here.

 The figure searches its clothing briefly, and then continues on its
 way.

>seach figure
 That's not a verb I recognize.

>search figure
 You try to peer into the figure's eyes. They are too remote. They do
 not see you.

 A tiny human figure staggers across the sand. It doesn't seem to

 The figure slumps to the sand. No -- it's still moving, though on
 hands and knees.

 The figure closes its eyes for a few seconds.

>get book
 Taken.

>read book
 The Desert Elemental's Handbook -- you've been studying it for ages.
 Trace moisture segregation, arthropod ecocycles, sand/grit/fines
 sizing distributions. And, of course, the artistic aspects of heat,
 time, distance, and death.

 You skim through the chapters on starvation.

 You skim through the pages on scorpions.

 The figure seems to be muttering to itself.

 The figure falls. After a few seconds... it still doesn't move.

 The sands quickly cover it.

 It's exactly like all the sand you've ever seen before.

 The shadows shrink as you watch. The dunes aren't high here, and the
 sun is rising fast.

 The cover is worn now. The pages are all blank.

>drop book

 The tiny figure crawls out from under the sands. It's dead.

 "You win," it says. "Okay, my turn again."

 Nothing left to do. Time passes.

 The sun crawls higher.
