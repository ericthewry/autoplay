    It's been a horrible day - no, a horrible week.  And you were so
 looking forward to starting work as an Acme salesman!  All through your
 childhood, growing up in the great cities of the north, you'd admired
 the salesmen with their spiffy mauve suits and bright orange ties.
 You'd waited eagerly for the day when you'd be handed your first sample
 Dam Tastee Cheez Kee, and your first customer would fork over his
 hard-earned cash for Acme products.

    But you didn't think your bosses would send you down here, to this
 backwater near the Valley King's Underworld, right on the border with
 dread Unnkulia.  And you certainly didn't expect those demons to waylay
 you en route - and you certainly didn't foresee the horrors they'd
 subject you to in their caverns before releasing you.  (Shudder - you
 don't even like remembering.  Perhaps that's the subject of another
 game...)  And you really didn't expect to have to work out of the
 Golden Dragon Inn.  And to top it all off, a bad-tempered warrior just
 returned a can of Acme Snayk Rhepellant and asked for his money back.
 You'll get heck from your supervisor when you get back, but what could
 you have done?  None of these damn - oops, dam - Acme products work.
 You've grown quite disillusioned with the whole affair.

    To make matters even worse, you haven't seen the bartender for over
 an hour. He wandered off into the back room and never returned.
 Alcohol's the only thing that makes living in the Forest of Radeekal
 bearable - perhaps you ought to go and find the man -

 In the Inn

    You're seated at the only table in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real
 dump in the middle of the Radeekal Forest.  It's decorated in earth
 tones - not a mauve or orange speck in sight!  (If you were in charge,
 you'd make this place a lot more snazzy.)

    The inn has been your base of operations for the past few days -
 your boss wouldn't even spring for an office.  Well, by golly, you'll
 show him!  Even though most of your samples have been stolen, you've
 still got a few choice items to hock to the gullible locals.  These
 Valley folk are real hicks - they'll buy anything!

    There's not much of interest here.  A mahogany bar lines one wall,
 but besides that, and the lone table and chair, this hellhole doesn't
 have much to offer.  The exit to the inn is to the west, and there's an
 open doorway leading to the back room to the northeast.

    An egg is sitting on the mahogany bar.

>mahogany
 The bar is made from mahogany, and is clean and polished - what a waste
 of resources!  If you ran this place, you'd let the dirt accumulate -
 the peons don't mind a little filth.  There's nothing on the mahogany
 bar.

>look behind it
 There's nothing behind the bar.  If only that warrior hadn't taken the
 last bottle of wine!  A few slugs of Chateau Unnkulia would slide down
 the old gullet pretty well about now.

 Seated on an Uncomfortable Chair in the Golden Dragon Inn

    You're seated at the only table in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real

 you'd make this place a lot more snazzy.)

 Outside Inn

    You're just outside the Golden Dragon Inn, somewhere in the middle
 of the Forest of Radeekal.  It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't
 enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the
 trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
 to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and
 forth, creaking in the cool autumn breeze.

    Suddenly, a familiar-looking Valley Warrior walks up the path to the
 southwest.  The warrior gazes at you through sorrowful eyes.  "You poor
 fellow," he murmurs.  "I've just completed 'Unnkulia Zero,' and the
 things I found out about you - hoo boy!"  He smiles a sympathetic
 smile.  "Here.  I've completed my quest.  Maybe this stuff can help."
 He tosses you a pickaxe and a yellow ball, which you clumsily catch.
 "Take care of yourself."  With that, the warrior strides northward,
 toward the great cities.

>examine sign
 There's a picture of a coiled yellow serpent and the words "Golden
 Dragon Inn."

>go north
 You take a few steps along the northern road, but then think the better
 of it.  Your boss told you not to come back until you'd sold every bit
 of cheez he gave you.


>inventory
 You have a bungee cord, a cheezdom, a cookie cutter, an acmid, a cheez
 key, a plastic card, a pillow, a candy bar, an egg, a pickaxe, and a
 yellow ball (providing light).

>examine cord
 The bungee cord is mauve and green.  It's got little hooks on either
 end.  Tiny lettering along the cord reads "Acme Kwik-Snahpin Bhungi
 Khord - Dam Sayfe!"

>examine cheezdom
 It looks like a deflated yellow balloon with several small holes in it.
 Tiny letters down one side read "Acme Loobrikayted Cheezdom:  Praktiss
 Sayfe Seks!  (Mayd from 100% Suhwiss Cheez)."

>examine cutter
 Tiny letters on the cookie cutter read "Acme Slysor-Dysor Kookee
 Khutoor."  This particular one's shaped like a key, but other fun
 shapes are available - hearts, clovers, horseshoes, and diamonds.  In
 fact, you've heard they make "Acme Kookee Charmz" with these things -
 "A Dam Tastee Pahrt oph thiss Compleet Brekphast!"  [2]  It's made from
 mauve plastic, and it's not very sharp.

 The key is yellow and spongy, and quite small.  Tiny letters along the
 side read "Acme Dam Tastee Cheez Kee."  [3]

>note 3

 be any plainer - NEVER EAT THE MERCHANDISE!  (Especially if it's made
 out of cheez(tm).)

 The plastic card's your Acme Salesman Identification.  You're quite
 proud of it.  It's orange, and has mauve writing on it.

>go southwest
 Forest Path

    You're strolling along a winding forest path.  The path forks here -
 trails lead northeast, south, and west.  You're deep in the heart of
 the Valley King's turf now - he told you not to stray too far from the
 inn unless you want to (gulp) suffer the fate of the other Acme
 salesmen.  I wouldn't wander around too much if I were you.  Tall oak
 trees overhang the trail, and dappled sunlight shines through the
 leaves.  A radberry bush stands by the side of the road, but it's been
 picked clean.

    The six thugs that make up the Valley Patrol are here, leaning on
 their pikes.  They appear to be loafing on the job; some of them are
 lying down on the ground, trying to get comfortable.  "Hey!"  one of
 them shouts, pointing at you.  "It's that stoopid Acme salesman!"  They
 all start laughing.  "Lookit them clothes!  What a doofus!"

>examine thugs
 The Valley Patrol is made up of thugs who couldn't cut it as Valley
 Warriors.  The King lets them patrol the forest, and hopes they won't
 do too much harm.  They're quite stupid-looking and you're almost
 certain that their foreheads slope a bit more than normal.  They're
 dressed in the green-and-white livery of the Valley King, and wield
 nasty-looking pikes.  The leader, a particularly stupid-looking brute,
 grins at you.  "Whazzup?"

>SAVE
>cf1
 Saved.

>punch thugs
 I don't know the word "punch".

>kill thugs
 (with the pickaxe)
 Attacking the Valley Patrol doesn't appear productive.

>go south
 I really don't think you want to wander the woods without the Valley
 King's permission, especially not with the Valley Patrol standing right
 here.

>examine radberry
 I don't know the word "radberry".

>examine bush
 The bush has been picked clean - there's not even a single berry left!
 Someone was a real hog.

>climb tree

 You shinny up the nearest tree, and find yourself -

 Up a Tree

    You're seated on a limb about halfway up an aged oak tree.  Below
 you, you can hear the Valley Patrol muttering amongst themselves.
 Above you, the limbs are too thin to climb further.  You can climb back
 down or stay where you are.  Perched on the same limb with you, a few
 feet out, is a recently-completed bird's nest.

>examine nest
 There's nothing in the bird's nest.

>search nest
 There's nothing in the bird's nest.

>examine patrol
 I don't see any patrol here.

>sit on nest
 I don't know how to sit on the bird's nest.

 Inn, Back Room

    You're standing in the disgustingly clean back room of the Golden
 Dragon Inn.  The walls have recently been whitewashed, and the floor is
 freshly scrubbed.  You thought you saw the innkeeper come back here,
 but maybe you were wrong - he's nowhere to be seen.  The floorboards
 creak underfoot, groaning with age.

    There's not much back here, not even an empty bucket.  The only exit
 is back to the main room of the inn, to the southwest.

    You see a broom here.

>get broom
 Taken.

>examine floorboards
 A few of the creaky floorboards are quite loose.

>lift floorboards
 You pull up the loosest floorboards.  Interestingly enough, they're not
 even nailed in - it's almost like a hidden trap-door.  Moving the
 boards reveals a wooden stairway, plunging into darkness.  From below,
 you can faintly hear what sounds like weepy muttering.

 *** Your score has just changed.  ***

>score
 In a total of 41 turns, you have achieved a score of 5 points out of a

>go down
 Wine Cellar

    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
 stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
 wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
 western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
 in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
 sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.

    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
 up at you through bleary eyes.  "Oh," he mutters.  "It's you,
 Tuckbucker.  I thought (URP!)  you'd left already."  He sighs and taps
 the cask.  "Empty.  Bummer.  Want to buy this place?"  He points at the
 ceiling.  "(URP!)  The Golden Dragon's not turning a profit anymore.
 I'll sell it to you for twenty - no, eighteen valmids."

    The Golden Dragon Inn!  It could be your very own - or, at least,
 Acme's very own!  What an acquisition an inn would be - especially this
 one, right in the heart of the Valley.  The purchase of this place
 would give your life meaning.  Now all you have to do is accumulate
 enough valuable - or, at least, valuable-looking - items to pawn off on
 this drunken old fool.

>examine innkeeper
 He's obviously been drinking, and quite heavily from the looks of it.
 Wine stains cover his shirt, and his head is lolling back and forth.  A
 thin line of drool runs from the corner of his mouth.  He glances up at
 you, trying to focus.  "Urk.  Hate this place."

>give acmid to innkeeper
 The innkeeper peers at the item through bleary eyes.  "Tuckbucker, I'm
 not that drunk," he mutters.  "That's of absolutely no use to me."

>inventory
 You have a bungee cord, a cheezdom, a cookie cutter, an acmid, a cheez
 key, a plastic card, a pillow, a candy bar, an egg, a pickaxe, a yellow
 ball (providing light), and a broom.

>give cheezdom to innkeeper
 The innkeeper peers at the item through bleary eyes.  "Tuckbucker, I'm
 not that drunk," he mutters.  "That's of absolutely no use to me."

>examine wall
 Which wall do you mean, the brick wall, or the other walls?

>brick
 The brick wall looks like a recent addition.

>hit it with pickaxe
 You brace yourself and smash the brick wall with the pickaxe, hitting
 smack in the center of one of the bricks.  Your shoulders are nearly
 jarred out of their sockets, and the wall's barely dented; this job
 could take a while.

>hit it with pickaxe
 This time, the pickaxe bites between two bricks, and imbeds itself deep
 in the crumbling mortar.  You yank it out, and bring several bricks
 with it.  In a few moments, you've smashed a large hole through the
 wall, revealing a dark space beyond.  A cold breeze blows through the
 hole; whatever you've broken into, it sure is big.  The innkeeper
 rouses himself long enough to stare at the wall.  "Urk," he mutters.
 "Hope you're going to buy this place.  I don't wanna have to fix that."

 *** Your score has just changed.  ***

>go east
 Natural Cave

    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
 in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
 your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
 shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
 the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
 There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
 passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
 wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.

>SAVE

>go southwest
 You can't go that way.

>go south
 Cave of the Skeleton

    This chamber is dark and low, with no apparent exits other than the
 passage back to the north.  The roof slopes sharply down to the south,
 and at the far end, there's only a few inches between ceiling and
 floor.  Lying face down in the center of the cave is a grisly sight - a
 human skeleton, half-covered in mineral deposits, probably centuries
 old.  Good thing he didn't have Acme Dam Eckspensif Lyfe Ihnshorants -
 you might have to pay up.

>examine skeleton
 The skeleton has become part of the rocky floor - drips of mineral-rich
 water have fused the dead man's torso with the ageless stones.  Not
 that you care; you're a salesman, not an archaeologist.  Interestingly,
 there's a leather belt around the skeleton's waist, untouched by the
 ravages of time.  (There's absolutely no sign of a dagger, however.)

>get belt
 You carefully remove the belt from the skeleton.

>examine it
 The belt's marvelous workmanship, hand-tooled fine leather.  It's
 probably worth something.  Clearly, it wasn't made by Acme.

 Okay, you're now wearing the leather belt.

 Stalagmite Cavern

    You're standing in a medium-sized natural cavern.  The floor is
 difficult to negotiate; stalagmites of all shapes and sizes impede your
 progress.  Water drips from the walls, pooling on the remaining bits of
 open floor.  There are no stalactites, perhaps because there's no
 ceiling; instead, a huge, dark natural chimney stretches up above you,
 bending slightly to the north, vanishing into shadows overhead.  A
 narrow passage climbs to the northwest, and level tunnels run southwest
 and south.  The southwest passage seems somewhat warmer than the
 others.

>go southwest
 Geyser Cavern

    You're standing in a small, hot cave filled with thick steam.  The
 source of the steam is evident; hot clouds billow from a narrow mineral
 spout shaped like an overturned funnel.  There must be a hot spring
 somewhere beneath you.  The only exit is back to the northeast.

>examine funnel
 The steam's all coming out of a nozzle-shaped bit at the top of the
 funnel-shaped spout.  The nozzle part is only about an inch across; the
 steam's being forced through a tiny hole.

>SAVE
>cf3
 Saved.

>put cheezdom on funnel
 You stick the cheezdom over the nozzle.  It rapidly fills with hot air,
 and starts to look like a big yellow balloon - albeit one with a bunch
 of holes in it.  When it's as full as it's going to get, you take it
 off the spout, being careful to hold the opening shut.

>jump
 Wheeee!

 Suddenly, your feet begin to leave the ground!  When the cheezdom hits
 the rock of the ceiling above you, it pops with a wet splattering
 sound, spraying cheez (ugh) across the dark granite.  You fall the
 short distance to the ground, shaken but unhurt.

 Chamber of the Padlock

    This cavern is wide and high, and the walls appear to have been
 worked and shaped.  The only exit is to the north.

    The southern wall is partly taken up by what appears to be an
 enormous padlock, made from solid gold and embedded in the wall.
 Goodness!  If only you could remove the padlock from the wall, you'd be
 able to purchase the Golden Dragon Inn right now!  Though the lock
 itself is quite large, the keyhole in the center is quite small.
 There's not much else of interest here.

>examine padlock
 The padlock's embedded in the wall; you're definitely not going to be
 able to get it out, if that's what you're thinking.  The tiny keyhole
 in the center looks just like any other keyhole.

>unlock padlock with cheez key
 The key fits perfectly.  You wiggle it around, and for just a moment,
 you think you hear a tumbler click inside.

 Top of Chimney

    You're in a small chamber at the top of a natural chimney.  The
 chimney slopes slightly toward the south, but mostly, it just goes
 straight down, plummeting deep through the dark stone.  You certainly
 can't see the bottom.  An iron hook is embedded in the wall here, but
 otherwise there's not much of interest.  A passage slopes down slightly
 to the southwest, and a more level tunnel runs east.

>examine hook
 The iron hook is old and rusty, but quite sturdy; you can't move it at
 all.  Its purpose here is unclear, but it does suggest these caves were
 once inhabited.

 Gambler's Lair

    You're in a small, square chamber that's obviously been carved from
 the rock.  The place is apparently home to somebody; a scorched circle
 on the rock floor was probably a makeshift fireplace, and a pile of
 straw against one wall might have served as a bed.  The room is
 otherwise featureless.  The only exit is back to the west.

    There's a thin little man here, leaning against the wall and chewing
 a piece of straw.  "Ah, a visitor," he says, beaming.  "Greetings.
 It's been ages since I've seen anyone.  My name's Les Vayghas.  Are you
 - " The man's eyes narrow.  "Oh, I know you.  You're that Acme
 salesman.  Well, we've got something in common."  He walks over and
 shakes your hand vigorously.  "The King threw me out of the Valley too.
 Since then, I've lived in these caves.  It's not too bad, but I've been
 trying to get away."

    The man's eyes narrow speculatively.  "You look like a person in
 need of something - perhaps this glittering bauble might come in handy,
 hmm?"  He holds up a silver key.  You reach for it, but he pulls it
 away, waggling his finger.  "Ah - not so fast.  How about a game?  I'm
 a gambling man, and I see you've got a coin there.  How about a little
 bet?  Flip your coin, and I'll call it in the air.  If I win, I take
 the coin.  If you win, you can have the key.  Deal?"  Without waiting
 for a response, the man pockets the key, then nods at you.  "Go on.
 Flip."

>flip coin
 "Tails!"  the gambler shouts as the coin flies up through the air.  It
 comes up tails.  I think it's weighted a little funny.  "Hah!"  the
 gambler chuckles, picking up the coin.  "Nice try, sucker."  His eyes
 narrow.  "Like another go?  If you've got more coins we can try again."

 chimney slopes slightly toward the south, but mostly, it just goes
 straight down, plummeting deep through the dark stone.  You certainly
 can't see the bottom.  An iron hook is embedded in the wall here, but
 otherwise there's not much of interest.  A passage slopes down slightly
 to the southwest, and a more level tunnel runs east.

>go southwest
 Natural Cave

    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
 in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
 your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
 shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
 the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
 There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
 passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
 wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.

>go northwest
 Twisting Passage

    You're at a bend in a low tunnel.  The rocks seem to bear down over
 you, as if trying to crush you into the floor, and the floor is
 irregular, damp, and slippery.  Somebody's been defacing the wall here
 with red graffiti - how rude! The least they could do is use a more
 pleasing color, like orange or mauve.  [4]  You could continue to the
 southeast or the east.

>note 4
 [4]: The origins of the Acme tri-colors (orange, green, and mauve) are
 lost in the mists of time.  One thing, however, is clear:  the colors
 make for some "dam spiphee" salesman suits.

>examine graffiti
 Examining the graffiti more closely, you realize it's not quite red -
 rather, it's the color of a ripe tomato.  [5]  You could probably read
 it.

>note 5
 [5]: Care for a refreshing beverage?  Set your Matter-mover coordinates
 for Tomato:  R10,000; B3881; G2785.  See "The Legend Lives" for more
 details.

 refreshing beverage."  - David Letterman

>read graffiti
 'It's said the gambler loves a good tale (sic).'

>go east
 Gate Chamber

    This room is dominated by an enormous iron gate which blocks a wide
 hallway to the north.  The gate is made from thick iron bars, and looks
 quite sturdy; I doubt you could squeeze through it.  Other passages run
 northeast, northwest, and west.

>examine gate
 It looks like an ordinary iron gate to me.

>go northeast
 Tiny Room

    This natural chamber is quite small, and the ceiling is extremely
 low; it's more an alcove than a room.  A familiar sight greets you - an
 Acme vending machine sits (or rather, squats) against the wall!  [6]
 How in the world did that get here?  You'd long thought that you were
 the first Acme salesman in the Valley.  The only exit from the room is
 the passage back to the southwest.

>note 6
 [6]: Before you were promoted to salesman, you had to polish and
 restock these machines.  And before THAT, you had to clean the
 executive washroom.  Boy, you're really shooting up through the ranks!

>examine machine
 This particular mauve and green machine appears to be a cheezdom
 dispenser.  You don't really need it - you've already got one, so
 you're covered, so to speak.  The machine is squat and lumpy.  Letters
 across the top read "Praktiss Sayfe Seks!"  There's a coin slot and a
 small chute on the front side.

>examine slot
 It looks like an ordinary coin slot to me.

>examine chute
 It's probably where the cheezdoms come out.

>put cheezdom in chute
 The chute goes up into the machine; I don't think you can really stuff
 anything up it.

>put coin in slot
 You drop the acmid in the coin slot.  It hits bottom with an extremely
 non-metallic thunk.  The machine gurgles for a minute, but nothing
 happens.  What a piece of junk!

>hit machine
 (with the pickaxe)
 Attacking the vending machine doesn't appear productive.

>search chute
 It's probably where the cheezdoms come out.

>kick machine
 You kick the stupid machine, irritated at losing your acmid.  The
 machine gurgles once, then spits a coin out at rocket-like speed.  It
 barely misses your cheek, then clatters against the wall and falls to
 the ground.

 *** Your score has just changed.  ***

>get coin
 Taken.

>examine coin
 The notched coin is a one-valmid piece, minted from bronze.  On one
 side is the current monarch [7]  and on the other side is a picture of
 the Hall of the Valley King.  There's a little notch cut out of the
 coin, but it's still worth one valmid.

>note 7
 [7]: The current monarch is the Second Valley King, Phul son of Kuul.

>go northwest
 The Golden Pool

    You're standing in a hot, low chamber.  The only exit is to the
 southeast.  Before you is a shining pool of melted gold, perhaps twenty
 feet in diameter.  It nearly fills the room, and bathes your face with
 intense heat; somewhere below the surface, hot lava or steam must keep
 the soft metal in liquid form.

    If only you had a container that would hold this gold!  How valuable
 it would be if it cooled - and how quickly you could meet the
 innkeeper's price.

>examine gold
 The pool of golden liquid bubbles and churns, slowly swirling, eddies
 of molten metal twisting lazily.  There must be thousands of acmids
 worth of gold here!

>SAVE
>cf5
 Saved.

>touch gold
 You touch the molten gold.  Your fingers are instantly burned down to
 little blackened nubs.  Surprised, you lose your balance and plunge
 headlong into the pool with a yelp.  Soon, most of the other parts of
 your body are burned down to little blackened nubs.

 Cave of the Skeleton

    This chamber is dark and low, with no apparent exits other than the
 passage back to the north.  The roof slopes sharply down to the south,
 and at the far end, there's only a few inches between ceiling and
 floor.  Lying face down in the center of the cave is a grisly sight - a
 human skeleton, half-covered in mineral deposits, probably centuries
 old.  Good thing he didn't have Acme Dam Eckspensif Lyfe Ihnshorants -
 you might have to pay up.

>examine skeleton
 The skeleton has become part of the rocky floor - drips of mineral-rich
 water have fused the dead man's torso with the ageless stones.  Not

 Stalagmite Cavern

    You're standing in a medium-sized natural cavern.  The floor is
 difficult to negotiate; stalagmites of all shapes and sizes impede your
 progress.  Water drips from the walls, pooling on the remaining bits of
 open floor.  There are no stalactites, perhaps because there's no
 ceiling; instead, a huge, dark natural chimney stretches up above you,
 bending slightly to the north, vanishing into shadows overhead.  A
 narrow passage climbs to the northwest, and level tunnels run southwest
 and south.  The southwest passage seems somewhat warmer than the
 others.

>go up
 You can't climb up the natural chimney.  (If you're trying to go up the
 passage to the northwest, just go northwest.)

>go southwest
 Geyser Cavern

    You're standing in a small, hot cave filled with thick steam.  The
 source of the steam is evident; hot clouds billow from a narrow mineral
 spout shaped like an overturned funnel.  There must be a hot spring
 somewhere beneath you.  The only exit is back to the northeast.

>examine geyser
 The steam's all coming out of a nozzle-shaped bit at the top of the
 funnel-shaped spout.  The nozzle part is only about an inch across; the
 steam's being forced through a tiny hole.

>inventory
 You have a bungee cord, a cheezdom, a cookie cutter, a cheez key, a
 plastic card, a pillow, a candy bar, an egg, a pickaxe, a yellow ball
 (providing light), a broom, a leather belt (being worn), and a notched
 coin.

>put pillow on nozzle
 There's no good surface for that on the steam spout.

>examine egg
 The egg is quite tiny, and covered in blue spots.  It's hard boiled,
 and smells terrific; these little taste treats are Golden Dragon
 specialties.  It's not quite up there with Acme's Eeestur-Tyme Cheez
 Ehgs, but still pretty tasty.

 Chamber of the Padlock

    This cavern is wide and high, and the walls appear to have been
 worked and shaped.  The only exit is to the north.

    The southern wall is partly taken up by what appears to be an
 enormous padlock, made from solid gold and embedded in the wall.
 Though the lock itself is quite large, the keyhole in the center is
 quite small.  There's not much else of interest here.

>examine keyhole
 The padlock's embedded in the wall; you're definitely not going to be
 able to get it out, if that's what you're thinking.  The tiny keyhole
 in the center looks just like any other keyhole.

>examine key
 The key is yellow and spongy, and quite small.  Tiny letters along the
 side read "Acme Dam Tastee Cheez Kee."  [3]

>note 3
 [3]: This was the very first Acme product ever coded, way back in
 "Unnkulian I" (just a bite (sic) of history for you).

>put cord on hook
 There's no good surface on the iron hook.

>attach cord troo hook

>wear belt

>attach cord to belt
 You slip one hook of the bungee cord through one of the belt loops.

>go down
 Climbing down the smooth walls of the natural chimney would be certain
 suicide. If you're dead set on going down there, why don't you just
 jump?

>jump
 You suicidally leap down the chimney, and find yourself -

 Falling through a Natural Chimney

    You're plummeting down through a natural chimney, and don't have
 much time to examine the scenery.  But you can see a narrow ledge
 lining the chimney around you.  Unfortunately, the ledge is nowhere
 near big enough to stand on.

    A crown is sitting on the narrow ledge.

>take crown
 You have just enough time to snag the crown with your foot as you sail
 past the ledge.  Moving the crown, however, reveals a copper key which,
 sadly, you must leave behind.

 *** Your score has just changed.  ***

 You fall further, and soon -

    You've stretched the bungee cord to its limits, and are scant
 milliseconds from flying back up through the chimney and scant inches
 off the floor.  You've got almost no time to react!

>z+
 I don't understand the punctuation "+".

>wait
 Time passes...

    Suddenly, you shoot back up the chimney, propelled by the bungee
 cord attached to your waist.  About halfway up the inevitable happens -
 the cord snaps!  As you plummet to the hard rock below, you wish you'd
 bought an Unnkulian Death-Cord instead - they never break!

 Chamber of the Padlock

    This cavern is wide and high, and the walls appear to have been
 worked and shaped.  The only exit is to the north.

    The southern wall is partly taken up by what appears to be an
 enormous padlock, made from solid gold and embedded in the wall.

 Stalagmite Cavern

    You're standing in a medium-sized natural cavern.  The floor is
 difficult to negotiate; stalagmites of all shapes and sizes impede your
 progress.  Water drips from the walls, pooling on the remaining bits of
 open floor.  There are no stalactites, perhaps because there's no
 ceiling; instead, a huge, dark natural chimney stretches up above you,
 bending slightly to the north, vanishing into shadows overhead.  A
 narrow passage climbs to the northwest, and level tunnels run southwest
 and south.  The southwest passage seems somewhat warmer than the
 others.

 Geyser Cavern

    You're standing in a small, hot cave filled with thick steam.  The
 source of the steam is evident; hot clouds billow from a narrow mineral
 spout shaped like an overturned funnel.  There must be a hot spring
 somewhere beneath you.  The only exit is back to the northeast.

>touch steam
 Touching the steam doesn't seem to have any effect.

 You have a cheezdom, a cookie cutter, a cheez key, a plastic card, a

 The steam's all coming out of a nozzle-shaped bit at the top of the
 funnel-shaped spout.  The nozzle part is only about an inch across; the
 steam's being forced through a tiny hole.

>examine cheezdom
 It looks like a deflated yellow balloon with several small holes in it.
 Tiny letters down one side read "Acme Loobrikayted Cheezdom:  Praktiss

 off the spout, being careful to hold the opening shut.

 Suddenly, your feet begin to leave the ground!  When the cheezdom hits
 the rock of the ceiling above you, it pops with a wet splattering
 sound, spraying cheez (ugh) across the dark granite.  You fall the
 short distance to the ground, shaken but unhurt.

 Rising through a Natural Chimney

    You're swiftly rising up a natural chimney, hanging from a rapidly

    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
 stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
 wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
 western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
 in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
 sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.  A sizable hole has been
 bashed through the brick wall, revealing a dark space to the east.

    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
 up at you through bleary eyes.

 Inn, Back Room

    You're standing in the disgustingly clean back room of the Golden
 Dragon Inn.  The walls have recently been whitewashed, and the floor is
 freshly scrubbed.  A few of the floorboards have been pulled up,
 revealing a wooden stairway descending into darkness.

 In the Inn

    You're standing in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real dump in the middle
 of the Radeekal Forest.  It's decorated in earth tones - not a mauve or
 orange speck in sight!  (If you were in charge, you'd make this place a
 lot more snazzy.)

    There's not much of interest here.  A mahogany bar lines one wall,
 but besides that, and the lone table and chair, this hellhole doesn't
 have much to offer.  The exit to the inn is to the west, and there's an
 open doorway leading to the back room to the northeast.

 Outside Inn

    You're just outside the Golden Dragon Inn, somewhere in the middle
 of the Forest of Radeekal.  It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't
 enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the
 trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
 to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and
 forth, creaking in the cool autumn breeze.

 Forest Path

    You're strolling along a winding forest path.  The path forks here -
 trails lead northeast, south, and west.  You're deep in the heart of
 the Valley King's turf now - he told you not to stray too far from the
 inn unless you want to (gulp) suffer the fate of the other Acme
 salesmen.  I wouldn't wander around too much if I were you.  Tall oak
 trees overhang the trail, and dappled sunlight shines through the
 leaves.  A radberry bush stands by the side of the road, but it's been
 picked clean.

    The six thugs that make up the Valley Patrol are here, leaning on
 their pikes.  They appear to be loafing on the job; some of them are
 lying down on the ground, trying to get comfortable.  "Hey!"  one of
 them shouts, pointing at you.  "It's that stoopid Acme salesman!"  They
 all start laughing.  "Lookit them clothes!  What a doofus!"

 The Golden Pool

    You're standing in a hot, low chamber.  The only exit is to the
 southeast.  Before you is a shining pool of melted gold, perhaps twenty
 feet in diameter.  It nearly fills the room, and bathes your face with
 intense heat; somewhere below the surface, hot lava or steam must keep
 the soft metal in liquid form.

    If only you had a container that would hold this gold!  How valuable
 it would be if it cooled - and how quickly you could meet the
 innkeeper's price.

 it starts to melt - no big surprise, but you had to see for yourself,
 didn't you?  Horrified, you yank the cutter back.  It emerges from the
 metal, dripping plastic and gold.  You blow on the gloppy mass
 frantically, trying to cool it.  A noxious odor wafts to your nose as
 the last bits of plastic burn off - and then, a perfect gold key drops
 on the floor with a tinkling sound.

 Stalagmite Cavern

    You're standing in a medium-sized natural cavern.  The floor is
 difficult to negotiate; stalagmites of all shapes and sizes impede your
 progress.  Water drips from the walls, pooling on the remaining bits of
 open floor.  There are no stalactites, perhaps because there's no
 ceiling; instead, a huge, dark natural chimney stretches up above you,
 bending slightly to the north, vanishing into shadows overhead.  A
 narrow passage climbs to the northwest, and level tunnels run southwest
 and south.  The southwest passage seems somewhat warmer than the
 others.

 Chamber of the Padlock

    This cavern is wide and high, and the walls appear to have been
 worked and shaped.  The only exit is to the north.

    The southern wall is partly taken up by what appears to be an
 enormous padlock, made from solid gold and embedded in the wall.
 Though the lock itself is quite large, the keyhole in the center is

 otherwise there's not much of interest.  A passage slopes down slightly

 Gambler's Lair

    You're in a small, square chamber that's obviously been carved from

 on the rock floor was probably a makeshift fireplace, and a pile of
 straw against one wall might have served as a bed.  The room is
 otherwise featureless.  The only exit is back to the west.

    There's a thin little man here, leaning against the wall and chewing
 a piece of straw.

    The man's eyes narrow speculatively.  "You look like a person in
 need of something - perhaps this glittering bauble might come in handy,
 hmm?"  He holds up a silver key.  You reach for it, but he pulls it
 away, waggling his finger.  "Ah - not so fast.  How about a game?  I'm

 bet?  Flip your coin, and I'll call it in the air.  If I win, I take

 ominously over two narrow hallways running northeast and northwest.

    As you enter the room, the bird sculpture's head moves!  It turns to
 you and opens one eye.  "Do you seek the judgment of the Court of
 Birds?"  the stone beast squawks.  "Truly, you are a man of evil deeds.
 The existence of the cheez key is evidence enough of that.  But
 redemption can come to the worst of beings."  The beast's red eyes glow

    As you enter the room, the bird sculpture's head moves!  It turns to
 you and opens one eye.  "Do you seek the judgment of the Court of
 Birds?"  the stone beast squawks.  "Truly, you are a man of evil deeds.
 The existence of the cheez key is evidence enough of that.  But
 redemption can come to the worst of beings."  The beast's red eyes glow
 with a firelike intensity.  "Show new life to me, and I shall truly
 reward you."  Without warning, the statue becomes silent and unmoving.

 East Wing

    You're in a low, wide chamber.  Passages run to the west and
 southwest, and the wall opposite the passages tapers to a narrow point,
 lending the room a wing-like shape.  In fact, the stone walls appear to
 have been carved to resemble feathers - it's quite delicate and
 artistic work.  Unfortunately, you can't really take the walls with you
 to give to the innkeeper.

    Suddenly, there's a small explosion of light and sound, and a
 wobbly-looking stationary bicycle appears from nowhere, popping into
 the center of the chamber!  A frizzy-haired man in a white jacket hops
 off, coughing and waving his hand through a cloud of smoke.
 "Greetings, Tuckbucker!"  he says.  "Sorry to interrupt your quest for
 loot.  That is what you're doing, isn't it?  I did hit the right era?
 This is the age of the second Valley King, correct?"  He glances
 around, frowning.  "Whoops.  Off a bit spatially.  I thought I'd catch
 up to you in the jumbled hall.  Oh well.  Here."  He tosses you a small
 mauve box, which you just miss catching.  It lands on the ground with a
 disturbing crack.  "This should set you on the right track."  The
 strange old man hops back on the bicycle and starts pedalling.
 "Cheerio, Tuckbucker!  I'll see you in Unnkulia Thirty-Eight:  The
 Salesman's Gruesome Death!"  With a loud bang and a puff of green
 smoke, the bicycle and old man both vanish!

>examine box
 The mauve box is open on one side, and could probably hold small
 objects.  There's a large green button on one side.  Letters along the
 opposite side read "Akmi Galaktikorp Tyme Disstortur - Bhackwerdz Throo
 Tyme Ownlee (Yooz Whith Kaer!)"  There's nothing in the mauve box.

>put egg in box

 Inside the box, the boiled egg glows with a pale green light.  Then the

 the dense brambles and trees that surround this place make it almost
 impossible to imagine that anyone's been here in years.  To the south,
 jutting out from the brambles, is an enormous bird's head made from
 dark gray stone.  The bird's beak is open, revealing a dark tunnel
 runnning into the rock creature's throat, directly south.  Narrow,

 with red graffiti - how rude! The least they could do is use a more

 Natural Cave

    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered

 your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
 shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
 the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
 There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
 passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
 wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.

>go west
 Wine Cellar

    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
 stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
 wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
 western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
 in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
 sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.  A sizable hole has been
 bashed through the brick wall, revealing a dark space to the east.

    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
 up at you through bleary eyes.  "Oooh!"  he mutters.  "Pretty birdy!"

>go up
 Inn, Back Room

    You're standing in the disgustingly clean back room of the Golden
 Dragon Inn.  The walls have recently been whitewashed, and the floor is
 freshly scrubbed.  A few of the floorboards have been pulled up,
 revealing a wooden stairway descending into darkness.

    There's not much back here, not even an empty bucket.  The only exit
 is back to the main room of the inn, to the southwest.

 In the Inn

    You're standing in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real dump in the middle
 of the Radeekal Forest.  It's decorated in earth tones - not a mauve or
 orange speck in sight!  (If you were in charge, you'd make this place a
 lot more snazzy.)

    There's not much of interest here.  A mahogany bar lines one wall,
 but besides that, and the lone table and chair, this hellhole doesn't
 have much to offer.  The exit to the inn is to the west, and there's an
 open doorway leading to the back room to the northeast.

>go west
 Outside Inn

    You're just outside the Golden Dragon Inn, somewhere in the middle
 of the Forest of Radeekal.  It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't
 enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the
 trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
 to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and
 forth, creaking in the cool autumn breeze.

>go southwest
 Forest Path

    You're strolling along a winding forest path.  The path forks here -
 trails lead northeast, south, and west.  You're deep in the heart of
 the Valley King's turf now - he told you not to stray too far from the
 inn unless you want to (gulp) suffer the fate of the other Acme
 salesmen.  I wouldn't wander around too much if I were you.  Tall oak
 trees overhang the trail, and dappled sunlight shines through the
 leaves.  A radberry bush stands by the side of the road, but it's been
 picked clean.

    The six thugs that make up the Valley Patrol are here, leaning on
 their pikes.  "Hey, lookit that big bird!"  one of them shouts.  The
 Patrol laughs at you.  "What a scraggly-lookin' critter!  Must be one
 of Wowsa Willy's creations!"  The thugs turn away, ignoring you.

 Up a Tree

    You're seated on a limb about halfway up an aged oak tree.  Below
 you, you can hear the Valley Patrol muttering amongst themselves.
 Above you, the limbs are too thin to climb further.  You can climb back
 down or stay where you are.  Perched on the same limb with you, a few
 feet out, is a recently-completed bird's nest.

 you, you can hear the Valley Patrol muttering amongst themselves.
 Above you, the limbs are too thin to climb further.  You can climb back
 down or stay where you are.  Perched on the same limb with you, a few
 feet out, is a recently-completed bird's nest.

>inventory
 You have a yellow ball (providing light), a plastic card, a pillow, a
 broom, a leather belt, a notched coin, a crown (being worn), a pickaxe,
 a gold key, a mauve box, a ceremonial mask (being worn), and a crystal
 feather.

 The mauve box seems to contain an adorable chick.

 Forest Path

    You're strolling along a winding forest path.  The path forks here -
 trails lead northeast, south, and west.  You're deep in the heart of
 the Valley King's turf now - he told you not to stray too far from the
 inn unless you want to (gulp) suffer the fate of the other Acme
 salesmen.  I wouldn't wander around too much if I were you.  Tall oak
 trees overhang the trail, and dappled sunlight shines through the
 leaves.  A radberry bush stands by the side of the road, but it's been
 picked clean.

    The six thugs that make up the Valley Patrol are here, leaning on
 their pikes.  "Hey, lookit that big bird!"  one of them shouts.  The
 Patrol laughs at you.  "What a scraggly-lookin' critter!  Must be one
 of Wowsa Willy's creations!"  The thugs turn away, ignoring you.

>go northeast
 Outside Inn

    You're just outside the Golden Dragon Inn, somewhere in the middle
 of the Forest of Radeekal.  It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't
 enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the
 trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
 to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and
 forth, creaking in the cool autumn breeze.

>go east
 In the Inn

    You're standing in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real dump in the middle
 of the Radeekal Forest.  It's decorated in earth tones - not a mauve or
 orange speck in sight!  (If you were in charge, you'd make this place a
 lot more snazzy.)

    There's not much of interest here.  A mahogany bar lines one wall,
 but besides that, and the lone table and chair, this hellhole doesn't
 have much to offer.  The exit to the inn is to the west, and there's an
 open doorway leading to the back room to the northeast.

>go northeast
 Inn, Back Room

    You're standing in the disgustingly clean back room of the Golden
 Dragon Inn.  The walls have recently been whitewashed, and the floor is
 freshly scrubbed.  A few of the floorboards have been pulled up,
 revealing a wooden stairway descending into darkness.

    There's not much back here, not even an empty bucket.  The only exit
 is back to the main room of the inn, to the southwest.

 Wine Cellar

    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
 stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
 wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
 western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
 in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
 sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.  A sizable hole has been
 bashed through the brick wall, revealing a dark space to the east.

    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
 up at you through bleary eyes.  "Oooh!"  he mutters.  "Pretty birdy!"

>go east
 Natural Cave

    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
 in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
 your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
 shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
 the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
 There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
 passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
 wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.

>go northwest
 Twisting Passage

    You're at a bend in a low tunnel.  The rocks seem to bear down over
 you, as if trying to crush you into the floor, and the floor is
 irregular, damp, and slippery.  Somebody's been defacing the wall here
 with red graffiti - how rude! The least they could do is use a more
 pleasing color, like orange or mauve.  [4]  You could continue to the
 southeast or the east.

>go east
 No Gate Chamber

    This room is dominated by the conspicuous lack of a huge iron gate
 blocking the hallway to the north; the gate appears to have risen into
 the ceiling.  Other passages run northeast, northwest, and west.

>go north
 Jumbled Hall

    You're walking through a wide north-south hall.  The walls are
 covered in intricate carvings, and strange shadows seem to reach out
 for you.  Rocks and debris litter the floor, impeding your progress; it
 looks like bits of the ceiling have fallen down from above.  You can go
 either north or south.

    You see a cheez key here.

>go north
 Hall of Judgment

    You're at the north end of a long north-south hall.  To the south,
 the hall stretches behind you, cluttered with debris but still
 passable.  Before you, on the north wall, is a huge bas-relief
 sculpture of a gigantic bird, its wings spread wide, talons curved
 ominously over two narrow hallways running northeast and northwest.
 The bird sculpture is quiet now, but you've got the feeling it's
 watching you.

>show chick to statue
    The bird statue once again comes to life.  "Indeed, you do have a
 heart," the stone judge rumbles.  "Though you've done evil before, and
 shall do evil again, this act demonstrates you are not wholly without
 compassion.  Train the chick with care; one day it shall serve you
 well.  And take this as your reward."

    A panel slides open in the statue, revealing a jeweled egg.
 Wonderingly, you pick it up.  "We have judged, and found you wanting,"
 the bird statue says. "But you will be a great source of trouble to the
 Duhdist Monks, our arch-enemies.  Thus are you a friend to the birds."
 With that, the statue falls silent.

 East Wing

    You're in a low, wide chamber.  Passages run to the west and
 southwest, and the wall opposite the passages tapers to a narrow point,
 lending the room a wing-like shape.  In fact, the stone walls appear to
 have been carved to resemble feathers - it's quite delicate and
 artistic work.  Unfortunately, you can't really take the walls with you
 to give to the innkeeper.

 The Gizzard

    This chamber is shaped like a bird's gizzard.  [9]  The center of
 the room is a massive pile of crushed rock and debris, right where
 you'd stood when plucking the feather from the pedestal.  A wide, round
 passage runs north, and you think you can see a faint light at the end
 of the tunnel.  Other passages run east and west, both sloping slightly
 upward.

    You see a silver key and a copper key here.

 The Beak

    This chamber is shaped like a gigantic beak, the top half sloping
 overhead, the floor carved to look like a huge bird's tongue.  The
 overall effect is quite creepy; it's a darn good thing this monstrous
 beak isn't part of a real bird.  A low, round passage that bears a
 disturbing resemblance to a throat runs back to the south, while to the
 north, the beak is open slightly to reveal daylight beyond.  You could
 probably squeeze out there as well.

 Lost Vale

    You're standing on a soft carpet of moss and waving grasses, in the
 very center of a peaceful vale.  This place, though it's close to the
 Valley King's lands, certainly doesn't appear on any of the local maps;
 the dense brambles and trees that surround this place make it almost
 impossible to imagine that anyone's been here in years.  To the south,
 jutting out from the brambles, is an enormous bird's head made from
 dark gray stone.  The bird's beak is open, revealing a dark tunnel
 runnning into the rock creature's throat, directly south.  Narrow,
 winding trails run northwest and east through the brambles.

 You can't go that way.

>go northwest
 Streamside West

    You're standing on the south edge of a burbling stream in the middle
 of a peaceful wood.  A path follows the stream to the northwest and

 impenetrable on the other side.

 Bicorn's Clearing

    You're standing in a quiet, peaceful clearing surrounded by trees.
 There's a fresh odor in the air - if you didn't know better, you might
 suspect someone had been throwing a few shovelfulls of Acme Dam-Phowl
 Phirtelyzur around the forest.  There's something definitely magical in
 the winds, something so tangible you're afraid you might be scraping it
 off your shoes later.  The only clear trail runs back to the west.

    There's a strange creature standing here, idly munching on a blade
 of grass. You recognize it from storybooks - it's the fabled Bicorn of
 Radeekal!  [10]  It looks pretty much like a goat, with a patchy coat,
 a foul smell, disgusting table manners and two horns - but you know
 better!  This forest is magical, and surely the creature is no simple
 goat - it must be the mystical beast of yore!

>note 10
 [10]: Rumor has it that a bicorn will eat almost anything, even cheez.

 Forest Waterfall

    You're standing on a narrow strip of sand beside a burbling mountain

 A path runs beside the stream to the southeast; there's no other
 passable ways to travel.

    There's what appears to be a little girl playing by the water.  But
 you know better - that's no little girl!  In this magical land, she
 must be a water nymph!  Though you can't see for sure, there must be
 gills under her dress!  And it's said the fabled bicorn is a great
 friend of water nymphs!  Goodness, if you could lead the magical beast
 to the nymph, perhaps she would reward you!

    The bicorn trots down the path, following you.  Suddenly the water
 nymph sees the creature, and her eyes widen.  "Ooh!"  she says.
 "Pretty goat!"

    You're about to tell her that it's not a goat, it's a bicorn, when
 the beast charges, head lowered.  Curled horns meet the seat of the
 nymph's dress, and with a cry, the water nymph flies through the air,
 landing in the center of the pool.  Her plastic sieve flies up as well,
 bonking the bicorn on the rear end and landing on the grass.  The
 bicorn snorts, startled, and trots briskly off into the woods.  You
 wait for a few moments, wondering if the nymph will come up again, but
 all that greets you are a few lonely air bubbles.  Apparently, the
 skittish magical beast scared the poor nymph, and she's gone for good.

 sculpture of a gigantic bird, its wings spread wide, talons curved
 ominously over two narrow hallways running northeast and northwest.
 The bird sculpture is quiet now, but you've got the feeling it's
 watching you.

 Jumbled Hall

    You're walking through a wide north-south hall.  The walls are
 covered in intricate carvings, and strange shadows seem to reach out
 for you.  Rocks and debris litter the floor, impeding your progress; it
 looks like bits of the ceiling have fallen down from above.  You can go
 either north or south.

    You see a mauve box and a pickaxe here.

    The mauve box seems to contain a notched coin.

 No Gate Chamber

    This room is dominated by the conspicuous lack of a huge iron gate
 blocking the hallway to the north; the gate appears to have risen into
 the ceiling.  Other passages run northeast, northwest, and west.

 You're starting feel a fuzz hungry.

 Twisting Passage

    You're at a bend in a low tunnel.  The rocks seem to bear down over
 you, as if trying to crush you into the floor, and the floor is
 irregular, damp, and slippery.  Somebody's been defacing the wall here
 with red graffiti - how rude! The least they could do is use a more
 pleasing color, like orange or mauve.  [4]  You could continue to the
 southeast or the east.

 Natural Cave

    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
 in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
 your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
 shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
 the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
 There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
 passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
 wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.

 Wine Cellar

    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
 stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
 wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
 western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
 in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
 sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.  A sizable hole has been
 bashed through the brick wall, revealing a dark space to the east.

    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
 up at you through bleary eyes.  "Oooh!"  he mutters.  "Pretty birdy!"

>give belt to man
 The innkeeper stares at you, eyes wide.  "If I just wait long enough,
 the giant birdy will go away," he murmurs, his hands shaking.

 You're feeling really hungry.  You should find some food soon, or

 pockets the leather belt.  "Get me 16 more valmids worth of stuff, and
 the place is yours."

 As an Acme salesman, you should know better, but you nevertheless
 decide to choke down the whiffleball.  Not only is it cheez, but for
 some reason it's extremely radioactive.  Your intestines are quickly
 burned out and it's not long after that -

    It's been a horrible day - no, a horrible week.  And you were so
 looking forward to starting work as an Acme salesman!  All through your
 childhood, growing up in the great cities of the north, you'd admired
 the salesmen with their spiffy mauve suits and bright orange ties.
 You'd waited eagerly for the day when you'd be handed your first sample
 Dam Tastee Cheez Kee, and your first customer would fork over his
 hard-earned cash for Acme products.

    But you didn't think your bosses would send you down here, to this
 backwater near the Valley King's Underworld, right on the border with
 dread Unnkulia.  And you certainly didn't expect those demons to waylay
 you en route - and you certainly didn't foresee the horrors they'd
 subject you to in their caverns before releasing you.  (Shudder - you
 don't even like remembering.  Perhaps that's the subject of another
 game...)  And you really didn't expect to have to work out of the
 Golden Dragon Inn.  And to top it all off, a bad-tempered warrior just
 returned a can of Acme Snayk Rhepellant and asked for his money back.
 You'll get heck from your supervisor when you get back, but what could
 you have done?  None of these damn - oops, dam - Acme products work.
 You've grown quite disillusioned with the whole affair.

    To make matters even worse, you haven't seen the bartender for over
 an hour. He wandered off into the back room and never returned.
 Alcohol's the only thing that makes living in the Forest of Radeekal
 bearable - perhaps you ought to go and find the man -

 In the Inn

    You're seated at the only table in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real
 dump in the middle of the Radeekal Forest.  It's decorated in earth
 tones - not a mauve or orange speck in sight!  (If you were in charge,
 you'd make this place a lot more snazzy.)

    The inn has been your base of operations for the past few days -
 your boss wouldn't even spring for an office.  Well, by golly, you'll
 show him!  Even though most of your samples have been stolen, you've
 still got a few choice items to hock to the gullible locals.  These
 Valley folk are real hicks - they'll buy anything!

    There's not much of interest here.  A mahogany bar lines one wall,
 but besides that, and the lone table and chair, this hellhole doesn't
 have much to offer.  The exit to the inn is to the west, and there's an
 open doorway leading to the back room to the northeast.

    An egg is sitting on the mahogany bar.

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer in the wooden chair.

> take egg
 Taken.

>go west
 Outside Inn

    You're just outside the Golden Dragon Inn, somewhere in the middle
 of the Forest of Radeekal.  It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't
 enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the
 trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
 to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and
 forth, creaking in the cool autumn breeze.

    Suddenly, a familiar-looking Valley Warrior walks up the path to the
 southwest.  The warrior gazes at you through sorrowful eyes.  "You poor
 fellow," he murmurs.  "I've just completed 'Unnkulia Zero,' and the
 things I found out about you - hoo boy!"  He smiles a sympathetic
 smile.  "Here.  I've completed my quest.  Maybe this stuff can help."
 He tosses you a pickaxe and a yellow ball, which you clumsily catch.
 "Take care of yourself."  With that, the warrior strides northward,
 toward the great cities.

 Inn, Back Room

    You're standing in the disgustingly clean back room of the Golden
 Dragon Inn.  The walls have recently been whitewashed, and the floor is
 freshly scrubbed.  You thought you saw the innkeeper come back here,
 but maybe you were wrong - he's nowhere to be seen.  The floorboards
 creak underfoot, groaning with age.

    There's not much back here, not even an empty bucket.  The only exit
 is back to the main room of the inn, to the southwest.

    You see a broom here.

>pull floorboard
 You pull up the loosest floorboards.  Interestingly enough, they're not
 even nailed in - it's almost like a hidden trap-door.  Moving the
 boards reveals a wooden stairway, plunging into darkness.  From below,
 you can faintly hear what sounds like weepy muttering.

>go down
 Wine Cellar

    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
 stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
 wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
 western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
 in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
 sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.

    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
 up at you through bleary eyes.  "Oh," he mutters.  "It's you,
 Tuckbucker.  I thought (URP!)  you'd left already."  He sighs and taps
 the cask.  "Empty.  Bummer.  Want to buy this place?"  He points at the
 ceiling.  "(URP!)  The Golden Dragon's not turning a profit anymore.
 I'll sell it to you for twenty - no, eighteen valmids."

    The Golden Dragon Inn!  It could be your very own - or, at least,
 Acme's very own!  What an acquisition an inn would be - especially this
 one, right in the heart of the Valley.  The purchase of this place
 would give your life meaning.  Now all you have to do is accumulate
 enough valuable - or, at least, valuable-looking - items to pawn off on
 this drunken old fool.

>hit brick wall with pickaxe. g.
 You brace yourself and smash the brick wall with the pickaxe, hitting
 smack in the center of one of the bricks.  Your shoulders are nearly
 jarred out of their sockets, and the wall's barely dented; this job
 could take a while.

 This time, the pickaxe bites between two bricks, and imbeds itself deep
 in the crumbling mortar.  You yank it out, and bring several bricks
 with it.  In a few moments, you've smashed a large hole through the
 wall, revealing a dark space beyond.  A cold breeze blows through the
 hole; whatever you've broken into, it sure is big.  The innkeeper
 rouses himself long enough to stare at the wall.  "Urk," he mutters.
 "Hope you're going to buy this place.  I don't wanna have to fix that."

 *** Your score has just changed.  ***

>inventory

 key, a plastic card, a pillow, a candy bar, an egg, a pickaxe, and a

 Natural Cave

    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
 in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
 your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
 shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
 the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
 There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
 passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
 wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.

>go south
 Cave of the Skeleton

    This chamber is dark and low, with no apparent exits other than the
 passage back to the north.  The roof slopes sharply down to the south,
 and at the far end, there's only a few inches between ceiling and
 floor.  Lying face down in the center of the cave is a grisly sight - a
 human skeleton, half-covered in mineral deposits, probably centuries
 old.  Good thing he didn't have Acme Dam Eckspensif Lyfe Ihnshorants -
 you might have to pay up.

>examine skeleton
 The skeleton has become part of the rocky floor - drips of mineral-rich
 water have fused the dead man's torso with the ageless stones.  Not
 that you care; you're a salesman, not an archaeologist.  Interestingly,
 there's a leather belt around the skeleton's waist, untouched by the
 ravages of time.  (There's absolutely no sign of a dagger, however.)

>take belt
 You carefully remove the belt from the skeleton.

>wear belt
 Okay, you're now wearing the leather belt.

 Top of Chimney

    You're in a small chamber at the top of a natural chimney.  The
 chimney slopes slightly toward the south, but mostly, it just goes
 straight down, plummeting deep through the dark stone.  You certainly
 can't see the bottom.  An iron hook is embedded in the wall here, but
 otherwise there's not much of interest.  A passage slopes down slightly
 to the southwest, and a more level tunnel runs east.

>attach bungee cord to hook
 Okay, one end of the bungee cord is now attached to the hook.

>attach cord to belt
 You slip one hook of the bungee cord through one of the belt loops.

>jump
 You suicidally leap down the chimney, and find yourself -

 Falling through a Natural Chimney

    You're plummeting down through a natural chimney, and don't have
 much time to examine the scenery.  But you can see a narrow ledge
 lining the chimney around you.  Unfortunately, the ledge is nowhere
 near big enough to stand on.

    A crown is sitting on the narrow ledge.

>take crown
 You have just enough time to snag the crown with your foot as you sail
 past the ledge.  Moving the crown, however, reveals a copper key which,
 sadly, you must leave behind.

 *** Your score has just changed.  ***

 You fall further, and soon -

 Stalagmite Cavern

    You've stretched the bungee cord to its limits, and are scant
 milliseconds from flying back up through the chimney and scant inches
 off the floor.  You've got almost no time to react!

>SAVE
>cf26
 Saved.

>remove cord
 (Unhooking the cord)
 You unhook the cord from your belt at the very bottom of the fall, and
 nimbly step to the ground.

    The cord goes sailing back up the chimney.  After a brief second,
 you hear an ominous snap.  Bits of broken cord flutter to the floor
 moments later, and you breathe a sigh of relief - good thing you
 weren't attached to it!

 *** Your score has just changed.  ***

>go southwest
 Geyser Cavern

    You're standing in a small, hot cave filled with thick steam.  The
 source of the steam is evident; hot clouds billow from a narrow mineral
 spout shaped like an overturned funnel.  There must be a hot spring
 somewhere beneath you.  The only exit is back to the northeast.

>put cheezdom on spout
 You stick the cheezdom over the nozzle.  It rapidly fills with hot air,
 and starts to look like a big yellow balloon - albeit one with a bunch
 of holes in it.  When it's as full as it's going to get, you take it
 off the spout, being careful to hold the opening shut.

>go northeast
 Stalagmite Cavern

 Suddenly, your feet leave the ground as the cheezdom sails up the
 chimney!  Some lift this thing's got - jeepers!  You look around and
 find yourself -

 Rising through a Natural Chimney

    You're swiftly rising up a natural chimney, hanging from a rapidly
 deflating yellow balloon.  Below you are some rather dangerous-looking
 sharp rocks, and above you is only darkness.  A narrow ledge, nowhere
 near big enough to stand on, lines the wall of the chimney here, but
 there's nothing else of interest.

    A copper key is sitting on the narrow ledge.

>take copper key
 Taken.  The cheezdom's still deflating, but you continue to rise.
 Pretty soon, you find yourself -

 Top of Chimney

    You're at the top of the natural chimney, but you're rising so
 quickly, you don't really have time to enjoy the scenery; I'd suggest
 letting go of the cheezdom pretty soon.

>drop cheezdom
 You let go of the cheezdom and nimbly step to the ground.  The cheezdom
 flies crazily around the cavern, finally splatting against a wall.

 Gate Chamber

    This room is dominated by an enormous iron gate which blocks a wide
 hallway to the north.  The gate is made from thick iron bars, and looks
 quite sturdy; I doubt you could squeeze through it.  Other passages run
 northeast, northwest, and west.

 The Golden Pool

    You're standing in a hot, low chamber.  The only exit is to the
 southeast.  Before you is a shining pool of melted gold, perhaps twenty
 feet in diameter.  It nearly fills the room, and bathes your face with
 intense heat; somewhere below the surface, hot lava or steam must keep
 the soft metal in liquid form.

    If only you had a container that would hold this gold!  How valuable
 it would be if it cooled - and how quickly you could meet the
 innkeeper's price.

>put cutter in gold
 You slide the plastic cookie cutter into the molten liquid.  Instantly,
 it starts to melt - no big surprise, but you had to see for yourself,
 didn't you?  Horrified, you yank the cutter back.  It emerges from the
 metal, dripping plastic and gold.  You blow on the gloppy mass
 frantically, trying to cool it.  A noxious odor wafts to your nose as
 the last bits of plastic burn off - and then, a perfect gold key drops
 on the floor with a tinkling sound.

 Gate Chamber

 Tiny Room

    This natural chamber is quite small, and the ceiling is extremely
 low; it's more an alcove than a room.  A familiar sight greets you - an
 Acme vending machine sits (or rather, squats) against the wall!  [3]
 How in the world did that get here?  You'd long thought that you were
 the first Acme salesman in the Valley.  The only exit from the room is
 the passage back to the southwest.

>put acmid in machine
 You drop the acmid in the coin slot.  It hits bottom with an extremely
 non-metallic thunk.  The machine gurgles for a minute, but nothing
 happens.  What a piece of junk!

>kick machine

 Gambler's Lair

    You're in a small, square chamber that's obviously been carved from
 the rock.  The place is apparently home to somebody; a scorched circle
 on the rock floor was probably a makeshift fireplace, and a pile of
 straw against one wall might have served as a bed.  The room is
 otherwise featureless.  The only exit is back to the west.

    There's a thin little man here, leaning against the wall and chewing
 a piece of straw.  "Ah, a visitor," he says, beaming.  "Greetings.
 It's been ages since I've seen anyone.  My name's Les Vayghas.  Are you
 - " The man's eyes narrow.  "Oh, I know you.  You're that Acme
 salesman.  Well, we've got something in common."  He walks over and
 shakes your hand vigorously.  "The King threw me out of the Valley too.
 Since then, I've lived in these caves.  It's not too bad, but I've been
 trying to get away."

    The man's eyes narrow speculatively.  "You look like a person in
 need of something - perhaps this glittering bauble might come in handy,
 hmm?"  He holds up a silver key.  You reach for it, but he pulls it
 away, waggling his finger.  "Ah - not so fast.  How about a game?  I'm
 a gambling man, and I see you've got a coin there.  How about a little
 bet?  Flip your coin, and I'll call it in the air.  If I win, I take
 the coin.  If you win, you can have the key.  Deal?"  Without waiting
 for a response, the man pockets the key, then nods at you.  "Go on.
 Flip."

>flip notched coin
 "Tails!"  the gambler shouts as the coin flies up through the air.  It
 comes up heads.  I think it's weighted a little funny.  "Phooey!"  the
 gambler mutters.  "I almost never lose.  If I didn't know better, I'd
 think you cheated me."  He sighs.  "A deal's a deal.  Here's your key."
 He tosses a silver key, which you catch.  "Now get out of my sight."

 Chamber of the Padlock

    This cavern is wide and high, and the walls appear to have been

    The southern wall is partly taken up by what appears to be an
 enormous padlock, made from solid gold and embedded in the wall.
 Goodness!  If only you could remove the padlock from the wall, you'd be
 able to purchase the Golden Dragon Inn right now!  Though the lock
 itself is quite large, the keyhole in the center is quite small.
 There's not much else of interest here.

    You're at the north end of a long north-south hall.  To the south,
 the hall stretches behind you, cluttered with debris but still
 passable.  Before you, on the north wall, is a huge bas-relief
 sculpture of a gigantic bird, its wings spread wide, talons curved
 ominously over two narrow hallways running northeast and northwest.

    As you enter the room, the bird sculpture's head moves!  It turns to
 you and opens one eye.  "Do you seek the judgment of the Court of
 Birds?"  the stone beast squawks.  "Truly, you are a man of evil deeds.
 The existence of the cheez key is evidence enough of that.  But
 redemption can come to the worst of beings."  The beast's red eyes glow
 with a firelike intensity.  "Show new life to me, and I shall truly
 reward you."  Without warning, the statue becomes silent and unmoving.

 East Wing

    You're in a low, wide chamber.  Passages run to the west and
 southwest, and the wall opposite the passages tapers to a narrow point,
 lending the room a wing-like shape.  In fact, the stone walls appear to
 have been carved to resemble feathers - it's quite delicate and
 artistic work.  Unfortunately, you can't really take the walls with you
 to give to the innkeeper.

    Suddenly, there's a small explosion of light and sound, and a
 wobbly-looking stationary bicycle appears from nowhere, popping into
 the center of the chamber!  A frizzy-haired man in a white jacket hops
 off, coughing and waving his hand through a cloud of smoke.
 "Greetings, Tuckbucker!"  he says.  "Sorry to interrupt your quest for
 loot.  That is what you're doing, isn't it?  I did hit the right era?
 This is the age of the second Valley King, correct?"  He glances
 around, frowning.  "Whoops.  Off a bit spatially.  I thought I'd catch
 up to you in the jumbled hall.  Oh well.  Here."  He tosses you a small
 mauve box, which you just miss catching.  It lands on the ground with a
 disturbing crack.  "This should set you on the right track."  The
 strange old man hops back on the bicycle and starts pedalling.
 "Cheerio, Tuckbucker!  I'll see you in Unnkulia Thirty-Eight:  The
 Salesman's Gruesome Death!"  With a loud bang and a puff of green
 smoke, the bicycle and old man both vanish!

 Inside the box, the boiled egg glows with a pale green light.  Then the

 The Gizzard

    This chamber is shaped like a bird's gizzard.  [4]  A short stone
 pedestal sits in the very center of the chamber.  Above, the ceiling is
 high and almost out of the range of your dim light.  A wide, round
 passage - looking suspiciously like a throat - runs north, and you
 think you can see a faint light at the end of the tunnel.  Other
 passages run east and west, both sloping slightly upward.

    A ceremonial mask and a crystal feather are sitting on the stone
 pedestal.

 Wine Cellar

    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
 stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
 wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
 western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
 in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
 sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.  A sizable hole has been
 bashed through the brick wall, revealing a dark space to the east.

 Forest Path

    You're strolling along a winding forest path.  The path forks here -
 trails lead northeast, south, and west.  You're deep in the heart of
 the Valley King's turf now - he told you not to stray too far from the
 inn unless you want to (gulp) suffer the fate of the other Acme
 salesmen.  I wouldn't wander around too much if I were you.  Tall oak
 trees overhang the trail, and dappled sunlight shines through the
 leaves.  A radberry bush stands by the side of the road, but it's been
 picked clean.

    The six thugs that make up the Valley Patrol are here, leaning on
 their pikes.  "Hey, lookit that big bird!"  one of them shouts.  The
 Patrol laughs at you.  "What a scraggly-lookin' critter!  Must be one
 of Wowsa Willy's creations!"  The thugs turn away, ignoring you.

>climb tree

 You shinny up the nearest tree, and find yourself -

 Up a Tree

    You're seated on a limb about halfway up an aged oak tree.  Below
 you, you can hear the Valley Patrol muttering amongst themselves.
 Above you, the limbs are too thin to climb further.  You can climb back
 down or stay where you are.  Perched on the same limb with you, a few
 feet out, is a recently-completed bird's nest.

>put egg in nest

 "Mama."

    A panel slides open in the statue, revealing a jeweled egg.
 Wonderingly, you pick it up.  "We have judged, and found you wanting,"
 the bird statue says. "But you will be a great source of trouble to the
 Duhdist Monks, our arch-enemies.  Thus are you a friend to the birds."
 With that, the statue falls silent.

 The Gizzard

    A crystal feather is sitting on the stone pedestal.

 The Beak

    This chamber is shaped like a gigantic beak, the top half sloping
 overhead, the floor carved to look like a huge bird's tongue.  The
 overall effect is quite creepy; it's a darn good thing this monstrous
 beak isn't part of a real bird.  A low, round passage that bears a
 disturbing resemblance to a throat runs back to the south, while to the
 north, the beak is open slightly to reveal daylight beyond.  You could
 probably squeeze out there as well.

 Lost Vale

    You're standing on a soft carpet of moss and waving grasses, in the
 very center of a peaceful vale.  This place, though it's close to the
 Valley King's lands, certainly doesn't appear on any of the local maps;
 the dense brambles and trees that surround this place make it almost
 impossible to imagine that anyone's been here in years.  To the south,
 jutting out from the brambles, is an enormous bird's head made from
 dark gray stone.  The bird's beak is open, revealing a dark tunnel
 runnning into the rock creature's throat, directly south.  Narrow,
 winding trails run northwest and east through the brambles.

 Bicorn's Clearing

    You're standing in a quiet, peaceful clearing surrounded by trees.
 There's a fresh odor in the air - if you didn't know better, you might
 suspect someone had been throwing a few shovelfulls of Acme Dam-Phowl
 Phirtelyzur around the forest.  There's something definitely magical in
 the winds, something so tangible you're afraid you might be scraping it
 off your shoes later.  The only clear trail runs back to the west.

    There's a strange creature standing here, idly munching on a blade
 of grass. You recognize it from storybooks - it's the fabled Bicorn of
 Radeekal!  [5]  It looks pretty much like a goat, with a patchy coat, a
 foul smell, disgusting table manners and two horns - but you know
 better!  This forest is magical, and surely the creature is no simple
 goat - it must be the mystical beast of yore!  The creature is sniffing
 the air, eyes closed as if in a trance.  I think it's picked up the
 scent of something it likes.

>show cheez to bicorn
 Which cheez do you mean, the cheez key, or the yellow ball?

>key
 The bicorn's filmy eyes widen, and the beast starts salivating and
 rubbing against your leg.  He seems reluctant to take the key unless
 you drop it, but he might follow you now.

>w. nw. nw.
 Lost Vale

 The bicorn trots after you, still drooling.


 Streamside West

    You're standing on the south edge of a burbling stream in the middle
 of a peaceful wood.  A path follows the stream to the northwest and
 east, and another path cuts back through the trees to the southeast.
 You could probably cross the stream, but the forest is dense and
 impenetrable on the other side.

 The bicorn trots after you, still drooling.


 Forest Waterfall

    You're standing on a narrow strip of sand beside a burbling mountain
 pool.  Upriver, to the west, a small cascading waterfall feeds the
 pool, and to the east, a babbling brook stretches back into the forest.
 A path runs beside the stream to the southeast; there's no other
 passable ways to travel.

    There's what appears to be a little girl playing by the water.  But
 you know better - that's no little girl!  In this magical land, she
 must be a water nymph!  Though you can't see for sure, there must be
 gills under her dress!  And it's said the fabled bicorn is a great
 friend of water nymphs!  Goodness, if you could lead the magical beast
 to the nymph, perhaps she would reward you!

    The bicorn trots down the path, following you.  Suddenly the water
 nymph sees the creature, and her eyes widen.  "Ooh!"  she says.
 "Pretty goat!"

    You're about to tell her that it's not a goat, it's a bicorn, when
 the beast charges, head lowered.  Curled horns meet the seat of the
 nymph's dress, and with a cry, the water nymph flies through the air,
 landing in the center of the pool.  Her plastic sieve flies up as well,
 bonking the bicorn on the rear end and landing on the grass.  The
 bicorn snorts, startled, and trots briskly off into the woods.  You
 wait for a few moments, wondering if the nymph will come up again, but
 all that greets you are a few lonely air bubbles.  Apparently, the
 skittish magical beast scared the poor nymph, and she's gone for good.

    The trail ends here, though the stream continues on to the east.
 The trees grow in close and hang overhead, bathing the bubbling water

 under pine needles and leaves. The only visible path leads back to the
 west.

>put sieve in stream
 You dip the sieve into the cold water and swish it around, trying to
 pan for gold or whatever else might be found at the bottom of the
 stream.  Amazingly, you actually come up with something!  You pull the
 golden lump from the water and hold it up to examine it, then frown,
 disappointed - it's only pyrite, the stuff Acme uses in their "100%
