 guidelines on how to play.








 Two women. Overcoats, the collars turned against the cold. Windswept
 hair, anxious eyes. Feet shuffling closer to a modest house.

 The taller woman, a step behind her companion, suppresses a shiver.
 Her jaw hardens, almost imperceptibly.



 The Blind House
 An Interactive Fiction by Maude Overton
 Release 1 / Serial number 101213 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
 6/12N)
 Graphicless version of competition release - for ClubFloyd.


 The wind howls at our backs as Marissa fumbles with the lock on the
 front door. Her little fingers, the tips blue and shrunken, seem to
 struggle with the bulky mortice key. I bite down on my impatience
 before it has a chance to flare.

 It is uncertainty that holds me back from assisting. It's not exactly
 by invitation that I find myself here - more, by necessity - so my
 grasp of social propriety is somewhat shaken. My nerves, already on
 edge, are further stirred by the unseasonal cold and I rub my hands
 together, more as something to occupy my mind than as a genuine
 attempt to fight the numbness.

 At last, the lock clicks open and Marissa pushes the door open.
 "Sorry," she murmurs. "Come in. Please." I oblige without delay,
 stepping into the relative warmth and darkness of Marissa's entry
 hall. The dimness, the overall drop in stimulation, is soothing. I try
 not to look too disappointed when she flicks on the light switch.

 "Is there anything... can I get you something?" Marissa's eyes avoid
 mine as she delicately shrugs off her coat. I get the distinct
 impression she's not accustomed to playing hostess and I feel an
 inconvenient twinge of guilt. I mentally stomp on it. Now is not the
 time for self-doubt.

 [1] "I'm fine. Thank you, Marissa."
 [2] "Please, don't worry about me. I'm just thankful to be... out of
 the wind."
 [3] "I'm... actually very tired. Would you mind showing me to
 somewhere I could sleep?"

 and looks away. "I'll show you the... your room. There are extra
 blankets in the cupboard if... if it's cold tonight."

 We are half way down the hall before I even register we have started
 walking.

 Helena's Bedroom (on the bed)

 Marissa closes the door behind her and I sigh in relief, sinking down
 on the bed.

 oak cupboard. A window in the north wall overlooks the bed.

 The room dips threateningly as I get to my feet. My limbs attempt to

 me will be difficult, but I must be near collapsing from exhaustion. I

 Living Room
 It's a beige little living room; the offering of pale light filtering
 from the entry hall to the south somehow doesn't help to shake the
 sleepy, lifeless feeling here. An undersized dining table forms the
 centrepiece of the room, with two chairs pushed beneath it. Wedged
 into the northwest corner of the room is a television, an
 old-fashioned armchair tucked up next to it. Against the north wall to
 the east is a display cabinet with a single shelf of ornaments visible
 through the glass.

 A door to the north leads to the hallway and doors in the east and

 The kitchen has a dated feel to it; a laminate bench runs around two

 and several potted plants decorate the bench around the spotless
 appliances.

 A calendar and old-fashioned cordless phone hang on the wall near the

 The bathroom is modestly sized and equipped, and as pristine as a
 hospital room. A white basin faces the door, a small mirrored cabinet
 attached to the wall above it. A toilet and shower are fixed against
 the north and south walls respectively. Just left of the doorway on
 the east wall is a small plastic table, covered in toiletries and
 other miscellany.

 Studio
 This is surely an artist's studio. The concrete-floored room gives the
 impression of spaciousness simply because of how empty it is: an
 artist's easel sits right in the centre of the space, with an
 expensive-looking chair facing it. A floor-length window on the east
 wall adds to the discomforting sense of open space. The north wall,
 bare-bricked, looks strangely out of character with the painted walls
 of the rest of the house. The door is set into the west wall.

 Marissa, apparently deep in concentration, doesn't even glance up from
 her painting as I enter the room.

>ask Marissa for key

>talk to Marissa

 [1] "Is there a key to my room?"

>1
 unnecessarily frilly the thing is; she certainly has plenty to fiddle
 with. "Is it not by the bedside? I must've forgotten, sorry. A
 minute..."

 I watch her patter down the hallway and dart into my room. Her desire
 to take care of me seems more genuine than is warranted - or deserved,
 I catch myself thinking. Before last month, we had not seen each other
 since sixth form at college, years ago. She had no real reason to help
 me, no real reason to bring me to her home today.

 On the other hand, it seems pointless to question her motives when I'm
 unable to clarify even my own. Last night... I didn't know what to do.
 She just happened to be the one I remembered. Maybe I thought I could
 be anonymous here. Safe.

 Maybe I just knew she'd be unable to refuse.

 I see Marissa walking back down the hall towards me, an odd look on
 her face. A vague look, I think. Something approaching regret stirs in
 me - maybe it's my own unease that has flustered her into losing keys.
 "Here," she says, dropping the key into my expectant palm, "I'm
 sorry." I manage to suppress a grimace as she places a well-meaning
 hand on my injured arm.

 "I know having a key must be important to you now," she goes on,
 "but... you'll be safe here, you know. I don't think anyone could have
 followed us."

 [1] "Thank you for understanding."
 [2] "I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you."
 [3] "It's difficult to be certain of that. Thanks for the key."

 I double-check the lock on the door and undress in the dark, tossing
 my clothes onto a shelf in the wardrobe. The bedsheets are
 comfortingly crisp against my skin.

 I am so thoroughly exhausted that - blissfully - I drift off to sleep
 almost immediately and am not forced to endure the company of my
 thoughts for long.

 Nightmares chase me for hours.

 But I'm already on the bed.
 I wake suddenly, disoriented.

 The room is dark and I have neither clock nor watch, but I feel
 certain it is not yet dawn. There is a strange splattering noise
 coming from outside; it takes me a moment to register it as rain.

 The window rattles in the wind and the blinds chatter against the
 pane. I stand, my bare flesh prickling in the cold, and wander over to
 the window. The blinds seem damp and I wonder if the window is
 leaking. Moisture beads, brims, overflows in a pattern that seems
 chillingly familiar. The slats - so sharp - are not slats: they are
 knives, and the knives are in my hands. Rivulets of auburn bleed into
 the rain, plasmatic. Red stains spreading to the rhythm of the
 rattling window.

 A gasp sounds as I bring the knives down again. My gasp. I wake again
 - properly - my heart racing painfully. Awake. Thank god.

 Something wobbles in my peripheral vision. I snap my head up and stare

 back at me. The odour of blood must be affecting my senses.

 impossibly, to waver and shimmer. I pinch my forehead, trying to stay

 mind. A struggle with a knife. A woman, her name I can't recall - only
 her eyes: angry tunnels, and then suddenly lifeless. Stunned regret
 supplanted by terror. Fumbling to clean the fast-coagulating mess.
 Running. Calling the only number I could focus on. Marissa's gentle
 concern, innocent of the reason for my distress.

 Enough. I'm safe here. I should try to sleep again.

 Wearily, I repeat the motions of undressing and crawl into bed.

 Morning. I exhale slowly and run my fingertips along my arms, feeling

 Rising from the bed, I stumble over to the cupboard to dress - almost
 tripping on the open drawer on the way. Did I forget to close it last
 night?

 A stack of old paintings. They can't have been touched for years -

 layer of dust. Their subjects all seem to be women relaxing together
 in various settings - under parasols in a scenic park, by a fireplace
 in a cosy living room, lazing on a drifting canal boat.

 This painting looks fresher than those beneath it. The image is
 disturbing. Moreso, the longer I look at it. Depicted is a woman
 floating naked in the ocean, red strands of seaweed unfurling in the
 current and... strangling her about the neck. Her dying eyes are wild,
 staring upwards as though pleading.

 A glint of wayward sunlight flashes at me from the mirror. The blanket

 A door to the north leads to the hallway, a door in the west wall

 The house is utterly still; I think Marissa must have gone out for the

 A calendar and old-fashioned cordless phone hang on the wall near the

 A handwritten note has been placed near the middle of the bench.

 Living Room
 It's a beige little living room; the offering of pale light filtering
 from the entry hall to the south somehow doesn't help to shake the
 sleepy, lifeless feeling here. An undersized dining table forms the
 centrepiece of the room, with two chairs pushed beneath it. Wedged
 into the northwest corner of the room is a television, an
 old-fashioned armchair tucked up next to it. Against the north wall to
 the east is a display cabinet with a single shelf of ornaments visible
 through the glass.

 A door to the north leads to the hallway, a door in the west wall
 leads to the kitchen and a door in the east wall leads to another
 room. The entry hall is to the south.

 Immediately, a new image appears on the television screen.

 "Neverending Fantasia" - it looks to be a children's film about a boy
 who escapes an unhappy reality and ventures into a fantasy world. Even
 fast-forwarding through it, I can see how the tape has been damaged in
 sections from countless viewings.

 I put the "Neverending Fantasia" tape back in the box.

 Immediately, a new image appears on the television screen.

 A documentary about Matisse. Skimming through it, I find myself
 questioning why the man is so famous; his paintings look gaudy and
 amateurish to me - not at all like the little I've seen of Marissa's
 art. The film covers some philosophising about the purity of art and
 the dangers of expressing "over-excitement" in a painting. Most
 interesting is the sentiment expressed towards the end, an entreaty to
 all artists: "guard the original naivet?". Fascinating - at least, as
 far as it concerns those with naivet? left to guard. I wonder how much
 Marissa takes these philosophies to heart.

 Laundry
 I find myself in a tiny laundry; there is scarcely room to move around
 the sink and washing machine that occupy most of the space in here,
 and I'm forced to hunch inelegantly to avoid being battered by the
 clothes hanging from a line across the ceiling. A crumpled blouse is
 on the lid of the washing machine.

 outside. Marissa's assurance that no-one could possibly have followed
 us here seems empty and foolhardy with the outside world so close. I
 hesitate, wrestling with my rapid breathing. It is only her back
 garden, I tell myself. No-one is there.

 No point in dragging Marissa's blouse around. I'll leave it here.

 (first opening the back door)
 Back Garden
 The back door opens westward onto a small, fairly sparse back garden.
 A pair of concrete steps lead down from the doorway onto a neat but
 plain lawn, and facing them is a chain-link fence separating Marissa's
 property from her neighbour's. The fence is completely covered by a
 thick rose vine bearing magnificent red flowers.

 spaciousness simply because of how empty it is: an artist's easel sits
 right in the centre of the space, with an expensive-looking chair
 facing it. A floor-length window on the east wall adds to the
 discomforting sense of open space. The north wall, bare-bricked, looks
 strangely out of character with the painted walls of the rest of the
 house. The door is set into the west wall.

 I can see a brick here.

 Hallway (south end)
 The carpeted hallway extends away to the north.  A door in the west
 wall leads to the bathroom and a door in the east wall leads to
 Marissa's studio. The living room is to the south.

>go south
 It's a beige little living room; the offering of pale light filtering
 from the entry hall to the south somehow doesn't help to shake the
 sleepy, lifeless feeling here. An undersized dining table forms the
 centrepiece of the room, with two chairs pushed beneath it. Wedged
 into the northwest corner of the room is a television, an
 old-fashioned armchair tucked up next to it. Against the north wall to
 the east is an open display cabinet with a single shelf of ornaments
 visible inside.

 A door to the north leads to the hallway, a door in the west wall
 leads to the kitchen and a door in the east wall leads to another
 room. The entry hall is to the south.

 hospital room. A white basin faces the door, a small mirrored cabinet
 attached to the wall above it. A toilet and shower are fixed against
 the north and south walls respectively. Just left of the doorway on
 the east wall is a small plastic table, covered in toiletries and
 other miscellany. A vase of red roses lends some colour to the
 otherwise monochromatic room.

 This is my room, at least for now. It is remarkably clean, the walls a
 warm off-white. The bed rests against the west wall, reflected in a

 oak cupboard. A window in the north wall overlooks the bed.

 even inside the drawer, they've somehow managed to accumulate a thin

 in various settings - under parasols in a scenic park, by a fireplace
 in a cosy living room, lazing on a drifting canal boat.

 Here is another painting that I'm certain wasn't here before. A
 mattress lies in the centre of a bare wooden floor, covered in a mass
 of bloodstained bedsheets. Nested in the middle of the sheets is the
 body of a woman - she is asleep, or perhaps dead. Her skin is so pale
 and the brushstrokes so clumsy that it is difficult to tell limb from
 sheet.

 The laundry is tiny; there is scarcely room to move around the sink

 forced to hunch inelegantly to avoid being battered by the clothes
 hanging from a line across the ceiling. A crumpled blouse is on the
 lid of the washing machine.

 In the west wall is a door leading outside.

>put blouse in washer

 Carrying around the blanket is cumbersome enough. I'd prefer to put
 that down, first.

>put blanket in washer

 I heap the blanket into the machine and run it through a wash cycle,
 my gaze wandering idly over the room. The washing machine rumbles to a

 I flinch, startled, as I step into the living room: an
 elaborately-dressed woman is sitting at Marissa's dining table, bold
 as day. She looks to be in her late fifties and glares at me from
 beneath a permanently-wrinkled brow.

 I gasp, tiny fibres from the carpet floating into my mouth; somehow I
 am lying cheek-down on the floor. The woman is gone. Presumably, the
 old bitch struck me prone.

 I raise myself to my feet, feeling angry for the intrusion. Who
 exactly is this woman that Marissa is dealing with?

 I hear the front door open and look over to see Marissa entering the
 room. She greets me with a shy smile and places her handbag down on
 the table.

 my lip twitches. Marissa's eyes, wide and unsettlingly clear, flick
 down to my mouth, then meet my eyes seriously. That vague look enters
 her expression again.

 "Of course." She closes her eyes for a moment before staring at me
 seriously. "Helena... I'm sure you'd do no harm here." She almost
 reaches for my arm, then seems to think better of it. The silence
 swells.

 Marissa's Bedroom
 Marissa's bedroom is initially confusing to the eye; the walls are
 almost entirely covered in an eccentric display of unframed paintings
 and tiny mirrors in mismatched frames. Lace curtains drape over a
 window in the north wall, letting dappled light filter onto a
 white-framed bed. In the dimly-lit south side of the room is a bedside
 table, covered in a pale floral cloth and a reading lamp. A white
 wardrobe, far less intimidating than the one in the spare room, is
 here too. The door is to the west.

 quite delivering on the promise of a horizon.

 the loneliness is at its strongest, I move my easel close to the door
 and hide behind it, watching the neighbourhood's movements. There is a
 little old lady across the road who I often see struggling to carry
 her groceries inside from the bus. No-one is ever there to help her. I
 wonder what her name is, why she is alone."

 "I'm trying to keep to my schedule. Cleaning, always cleaning. Nothing
 is ever clean enough. Nothing is ever essential enough. I look away
 from my canvas and everything seems without essence and covered in
 dirt."

 told me a little more about her work at the opera theatre. I listened,
 spell-bound as a child. I think she knows I have no anecdotes of my
 own to contribute, so she just talks and smiles kindly. I guess what
 she is is a friend, though I retreat from the word with uncertainty."

>again
 not approve! - but oh, the studio is spectacular in the dawn light. I
 paint all night until I am too exhausted to think, and then I sleep
 and sleep and sometimes I can't get out of bed. The itch of tears is
 fresh in my eyes when I wake because I dream of such pretty things and
 then I wake, and I stare at my blank ceiling, blankness reflected in
 such blank eyes."

 still as strikingly beautiful as she was back in school. And goodness,
 so tall. Nervous as I was, I could not escape from our conversation
 for over two hours... but in retrospect, I am glad. She seems such a
 strong-minded, sensible person. Better-adjusted than me, most likely.
 She has brought me back from this slumber of blankness, I think. I
 dare to hope that maybe I will see her again."

 of that moment of creation is painful. I dreamt of so many things,
 once. Now I hold onto a series of singular dreams, fluttering against
 my palms as I grasp them, almost too afraid to breathe for fear of
 crushing their delicacy, and I paint them with a mechanical
 concentration. And can't look back. I am beginning on the cliffside I
 saw in my dream. I hope it will be enough for now."

>again
 wisdom and her worldliness must see right through my meek existence.
 'Purity' is what I value, I tell myself. In the face of another human
 being, though, my convictions waver... and even if I weren't so shy, I
 don't know if I could let a person into my life. Especially... well,
 oh. I don't know."

 Marissa's bedroom is initially confusing to the eye; the walls are
 almost entirely covered in an eccentric display of unframed paintings
 and tiny mirrors in mismatched frames. Lace curtains drape over a
 window in the north wall, letting dappled light filter onto a
 white-framed bed. In the dimly-lit south side of the room is a bedside
 table, covered in a pale floral cloth and a reading lamp. A white
 wardrobe, far less intimidating than the one in the spare room, is

 The bathroom is modestly sized and equipped, and as pristine as a
 hospital room. A white basin faces the door, a small mirrored cabinet
 attached to the wall above it. A toilet and shower are fixed against
 the north and south walls respectively. Just left of the doorway on
 the east wall is a small plastic table, covered in toiletries and
 other miscellany. A vase of red roses lends some colour to the
 otherwise monochromatic room.

 Marissa's studio. The concrete-floored room gives the impression of
 spaciousness simply because of how empty it is: an artist's easel sits
 right in the centre of the space, with an expensive-looking chair
 facing it. A floor-length window on the east wall adds to the
 discomforting sense of open space. The north wall, bare-bricked, looks
 strangely out of character with the painted walls of the rest of the
 house. The door is set into the west wall.

 Another new painting. This one is so messy it's difficult to be
 certain of the details, but it looks to be a figure of a blonde
 giantess attacking a human female with a knife. The giantess figure is

 I follow her gaze across the dozens of tiny mirrors on the walls. In
 each one, I see a different angle of the face of the woman I killed.
 My pocket feels suddenly heavy and I slip my hand in there, sweatily
 clutching the handle of my knife.

 [1] "It's that woman, isn't it? The one you work for. Marissa, you
 deserve so much more. She came here today, you know. Just walked

 Marissa's words come out almost in a whisper, but they strike me as
 painfully as an open palm. "What are you doing, Helena? What do you
 want from me?"

 My consternation must show in my features. Marissa, apparently
 emboldened, says, "I think... W-what I think is that you've been
 trying to trap me here. In my own house." She takes a deep breath.
 "B-but I don't think you're capable of really hurting anyone other
 than yourself." She is visibly shaking. I might be, too.

 "Helena?"

 I pluck listlessly at the bandages on my arm. Damnably, I don't think
 she is wrong. She stares at me and I understand - completely, at last
 - that this has to end here.

 I try to speak but my tongue seems to have closed off my throat.

 I glance back at her one last time - that perfectly preserved girl -
 and start walking down the hallway. My eyes fall on the fist-shaped
 dent where I "knocked" on her bedroom door my second night here, the
 bathroom mirror, completely obscured by adhesive bandages, the
 once-white roses turned ruddy as they drink their vase of hair dye. I
 pass through the living room and glance briefly at the porcelain
 ornament smashed into pieces on the floor.

 Yes, everything she said about me was true.

 I open the front door.

 We look at each other quietly. Marissa's face is soft and open.
 'Impressionable' seems the fitting word, as though I could mould her
 features with a gesture. The edge of a sunset filters in across the
 bed, softly meshed with the shadow of the lace curtain.

 "I saw what you've written about me," I eventually confess. She looks
 afraid, lowering her eyelashes. "Sometimes," I explain, "fear can
 distort your perception of events. You needn't be afraid, though.
 Anything I have done is only to protect you. I'm here, now. You don't
 have to be alone anymore." She lifts her eyes to meet mine and slowly
 takes a breath, about to say something - but seems to choke on her
 words.

 I lean forward and embrace her gently. Her little frame, at first so
 tense, eventually softens in my arms. "What I dream of," she murmurs,
 "is a life of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of trouble or
 depression." It sounds like a quote, but the sentiment is clear to me.
 I smile into her hair, holding her closer. She slumps into me, quiet
 and submissive.

 With me, she will be safe. And I know she will not stray from me
 again.

 She shifts away from me a little, sliding across the duvet, and I feel
 a pang of irritation.

 "I know there's something going on, Marissa. Please don't try to
 deceive me. Your tears are evidence enough." I brush her cheekbone
 gently with my thumb. She blinks and flinches. My right hand, still in
 my pocket, twitches.

>press space
 I hesitate, moistening my lips. "I'm sure you're being exploited.
 You..." She isn't looking at me. I catch her by the chin and force her
 eyes to meet mine. "You make yourself an easy target, all alone here."
 I continue. Her breathing is lightly audible. It rings in my ears like
 the ocean. "I don't think you understand what people are like. They
 can't possibly understand how to appreciate you."

 "What are you talking about." Her words fall flat; more of a statement
 than a question. It is obvious she knows exactly what I am talking
 about; the girl is addled by years of solitude. "But I am here to end
 that! Don't you see?" I smile, my heart almost leaping out my throat.
 She just stares.

 I lean forward to smooth out the tear-clumped tangles in her hair.
 Frustratingly, she edges back further. "There was a girl before, you
 know," I explain, "But she and I used to argue now and then."

 "Was there?" she asks. She is almost flat on the bed, now. I think I
 am leaning a little too heavily on her abdomen, but I feel I shouldn't
 draw away just yet. Her body is so warm against my hand. And there,
 she is crying again. Her eyes are wide. She looks shocked, but that
 will pass. "Just hush," I say, stroking her hair. "Hush." Her crying
 soon fades to silence.

 I curl up close to her, burying my face in her still-warm neck. I lie
 with her, long after it goes cold.
