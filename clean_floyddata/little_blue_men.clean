 Another day in the trenches. Another day of tooth-and-nail against a
 horde of sons of bitches who would chisel you out if you gave them
 half a second or half a chance. And if they can't take you down with a
 well-placed stab in the back, then they'll just wait you out and let
 the big, creaking wheel of routine slowly drive you mad.

 Don't let them get to you. You've got to stay one step ahead. You've
 got to keep it covered. Get a grip on it. Stay in the loop.

 And above all, you must remain. Totally. Frosty.

 An interactive object lesson by Michael S. Gentry,

 DISCLAIMER: This game contains strong language, graphic violence,
 unwarranted hostility toward others and negative vibes of various
 sorts. However, at its most fundamental level, this game is about
 learning to love yourself. We hope that you can look past these
 shocking and sometimes offensive trappings of style, and appreciate
 the game's message for its inner substance.

 Your Corner
 This is your scratching ground, your own little slice of the shit pie
 these sons of bitches call an office -- and don't think for a second
 that you didn't have to fight like hell to get it. Neatly shoved away
 into the southwest corner of the general work area, where they think
 you can't get into any mischief.

 On the desk are an in-tray (in which is some paperwork), an out-tray
 (which is empty) and a telephone.

 You are carrying a crumpled dollar bill.

      About the author.








 This game is a joke.

 This game is a warning.

 This game is a satire.

 This game is inspired in equal parts by Vaclav Havel's The Memorandum
 and Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

 This game is a big, stupid shaggy dog story.

 This game started out as a very silly game, and at some point during
 the design process it turned into a very serious game instead -- too
 far from the beginning to go back and rewrite everything to make the
 mood more consistent, too far from the end to play it down to the
 level of a minor punchline. The result is a kind of rushed and uneven
 mixture of gonzo humor and surreal horror that didn't turn out to be
 the polished, concise masterwork I had hoped it would be, but perhaps
 it will make for an interesting playing experience, nonetheless.
 Anyway, have fun.

 Your Corner
 This is your scratching ground, your own little slice of the shit pie
 these sons of bitches call an office -- and don't think for a second
 that you didn't have to fight like hell to get it. Neatly shoved away
 into the southwest corner of the general work area, where they think
 you can't get into any mischief.

 On the desk are an in-tray (in which is some paperwork), an out-tray
 (which is empty) and a telephone.

 You are carrying a crumpled dollar bill.

 A thick sheaf of workpapers with relevant carbon copies attached. All
 that fine print, all those tiny little scribbled blanks and
 check-boxes -- your eyes water just looking at it. Fortunately, you
 don't have to read it. All you have to do is stamp it.

>stamp paperwork
 Any idiot knows you need a stamp to stamp!

>examine desk
 This cheap chunk of fake wood and Formica is your desk. Key word: it
 is YOURS. Any son of a bitch tries to move it, or go poking around in
 the little drawer on the side, they are meat.

>examine phone
 Oh yeah, the phone. You can't make outgoing calls on it; there's no
 dial. You don't even know why it's on your desk. Presumably, you're
 expected to answer it if it rings, but it never does. Never has. Not
 once. Not ever.

>open drawer
 You open the drawer, revealing an ink stamp, a little gray bottle and
 a little white bottle.

>take stamp
 Taken.

>examine bottles
 Which do you mean, the little gray bottle or the little white bottle?

>both
 Sorry, you can only have one item here. Which exactly?

>gray
 The bottles are where you keep your pills. Your pills are extremely
 important; sometimes, they're the only way you can stay frosty around
 here. One bottle contains your headache pills, the other your sleeping
 pills. Unfortunately, you've spent so much time gripping and squeezing
 and twisting the child-proof caps that the labels have long since
 rubbed away, and now you can never remember which is which.

>gray
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 Taken.

 Taken.

>examine dollar
 Lousy crumpled dollar bill...

>stamp paperwork
 (with the ink stamp)
 You take a deep breath, raise the ink stamp high over your head, and
 slam it down as hard as you can.

    - APPROVED -

 Right in the middle, every damn time. It's thrilling, on a sort of
 visceral, primitive level.

 [You have just become a little bit less steamed.]

 You are currently feeling so-so.

>again
 You are currently feeling so-so.

>stamp paperwork
 (with the ink stamp)
 You've stamped it once already. Give it a rest.

 Which do you mean, the in-tray or the out-tray?

>put paperwork in out-tray
 (first taking the paperwork)
 Seconds after you drop it in, Benson scoots by your desk and whisks it
 away.

 The work is gone from your desk. It's out of your hands. A deep sense
 of satisfaction and contentment fills your soul, and you smile. If you
 had a chair, you would lean back in it happily, smug with the
 knowledge that you've done a good job, and you are now utterly at
 peace with yourself.

 [You have just become a little bit more frosty.]

 This is your own tidy little corner, your home away from home in the
 happy little community you like to call your office. All the security
 and companionship you could ever want is right here and always will
 be.

 On the desk are an in-tray (which is empty), an out-tray (which is
 empty) and a telephone.

>score
 You are currently loving life.

 You can't see any such thing.

 Time passes.

 Why leave? You've never been happier than when you're right here,
 where you belong.

 Furman zooms past suddenly, and tosses more paperwork into your
 in-tray. Your little bubble of happiness pops instantly and the gall
 comes rushing back.

 The fucking nerve! As if you didn't have enough to do already! Those
 sons of bitches never let up, they never give you a moment's peace.
 Never a chance to catch up or take a breath or get even halfway
 frosty. One of these days, you'll make them all pay...

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

>examine in-tray
 That's where they put work for you to do. They never seem to get tired
 of it. There's work in there right now, as a matter of fact. Lousy
 sons of bitches!

>take work
 As you take the papers, a memo slips out between two pages and lands
 on your desk face-down.

>examine memo
 (first taking the memo)
 First thing you notice, turning the memo over: it's not on official
 firm stationery. You allow yourself a grim chuckle. Some poor slob's
 going to get it in the ass for that little slip-up, and for once it
 won't be you.

 Then you read it.

 All it says is: "How about a snack?"

 Some kind of joke? Nervously, you glance around, but neither Furman
 nor Benson are anywhere in sight.

 Not that it matters. Obviously, some son of a bitch is trying to mess
 with you. Either Furman or Benson, or maybe both. Or maybe that
 bastard Biedermeyer. Whatever. One way or the other, that son of a
 bitch is going to be sorry. That son of a bitch is going to find out
 just how frosty you can be.

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

>go east

 Benson's Corner
 As usual, Benson's corner of the office, is a filthy sty. Files,
 papers, supplies lying around everywhere. You don't know how anyone
 could work in these conditions. A vast bank of filing cabinets stands
 against the west wall, behind Benson's desk.

 On the desk are some scattered papers.

 That lazy son of a bitch Benson is perched on his precious stool,
 leaning back against the files with his feet up on the desk like
 always.

>inventory
 You are carrying a memo, some paperwork, a little white bottle (which
 is closed), a little gray bottle (which is closed), an ink stamp and a
 crumpled dollar bill.

>stamp paperwork
 (with the ink stamp)
 You take a deep breath, raise the ink stamp high over your head, and
 slam it down as hard as you can.

    - APPROVED -

 Right in the middle, every damn time. It's thrilling, on a sort of
 visceral, primitive level.

 All it says is: "How about a snack?"

>ask Benson about memo
 Benson shrugs. "It didn't come from my desk."

 Benson is a lazy, ineffectual slob and everyone in the office knows
 it. He's in charge of Records, which puts him slightly below you on
 the totem pole, but it also entitles him to the use of the only stool
 in the office -- and he hogs that thing for all it's worth. He never
 actually uses it to get files. Just parks his pudgy ass on it and
 munches nougat bars all day.

 Like your other co-worker Furman, Benson is short and slightly pudgy,
 and wears thick, black-rimmed glasses.

 Benson shifts around on his stool, trying to get more comfortable.

>ask Benson about nougat
 "Man, I LOVE those nougat bars!" cries Benson happily. "I could eat
 those things all day long!"

 It's not a very fancy stool, but it's the only place to sit down in
 the entire office.

>take glasses
 "Hey," says Benson, jerking his head away. "Keep your hands to
 yourself, will you?"

>ask Benson about stool
 "That's right," Benson says proudly, giving the side of the stool an
 affectionate slap. "She's all mine."

 Which do you mean, the snack machine, the nougat bar or the Beechnut
 gum?

>kick stool
 You give the stool a good, hard thump. You thump it again, a bit
 harder this time. Next thing you know, you're pounding on the stool
 again and again for all you're worth -- you stop yourself, feeling a
 bit light-headed. Damn. You hate it when that happens.

>examine desk
 It's an ordinary-looking desk. A bit smaller then yours, but everybody
 knows Benson's a lazy imbecile.

 Oh, don't think you wouldn't love to pound Benson's face right through
 the back of his pointy little head. You never would, though, not with
 that bastard Biedermeyer watching your every move. Bide your time,
 though. Stay frosty. His day will come.

 "Generous of management, isn't it, to provide us working stiffs with
 that piece of junk, eh?" Benson smirks. "Still, he says, "I sure like
 those nougat bars!"

>go south
 Since this is the southeast corner of the office, you can only go
 north, west or northwest from here.

>go north

 Snack Bar
 What few pathetic nods to biological necessity are allowed by the firm
 have been shoved away into the northeast corner. There's a coffee
 maker in the corner, a vending machine against the east wall, and a
 door to the restroom to the north.

 The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you.

>go southwest

 Your Corner

 On the desk are an in-tray (which is empty), an out-tray (which is
 empty) and a telephone.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to save.

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>put paperwork in out-tray
 Seconds after you drop it in, Benson scoots by your desk and whisks it
 away.

 The paperwork disappears, and once again that inner serenity builds in
 you. Your anger subsides. Suddenly you realize that this is the
 secret, and it has been all along:

 Work really will make you free.

 It really is that simple. You've been so foolish, so needlessly
 frustrated all this time.

 Furman zooms past again, dropping more papers into your in-tray. But
 it doesn't bother you. Smiling at the memory of your misguided ways,
 and looking forward to the beginning of a new era of goodness, harmony
 and team spirit you slowly raise the ink stamp and think:

 I could never find a better job than this, if I spent my whole life
 looking.

 Snack Bar

 The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you.

>examine machine
 Ah, yes, the vending machine.

 Like most vending machines, it is essentially a refrigerator-sized box
 with a glass front, behind which can be seen several rows of assorted
 treats. There is a panel of buttons to the side, beneath which is a
 slot for coins, a bill changer for paper money, and a cup for your
 change. Insert your money, make your selection, and your snack drops
 from the appropriate row into the receptacle bin at the bottom of the
 machine.

 Simple.

 But there is more to this vending machine than only that.

 You hate this vending machine. You hate it more than just about
 anything or anyone else in this office. This vending machine was
 designed to hammer home a keen sense of the futility of existence; to
 taunt you with life's possibilities only to forever harass and
 frustrate your every attempt to grasp them. The machine never has
 anything you want. And even if it did, you couldn't buy it because you
 never have any change and the machine will only take mint-condition
 bills crisp enough to scoop bean dip with. And even if, by some
 fantastic stroke of luck, you did have change, and there was something
 remotely edible in the machine that you actually wanted, you'd still
 never be able to get it, because the merchandise invariably gets stuck
 before dropping into the receptacle, and no amount of shaking will
 bring it down unless you happen to be that son of a bitch Benson, who
 somehow always manages to retrieve his disgusting nougat bars with a
 single, insultingly skillful jiggle. Otherwise, forget it.

 The machine is your nemesis. Someday -- and you know that day is fast
 approaching, you must destroy it... or it will destroy you.

 Benson strolls by and heads straight for the vending machine, ignoring
 you completely. He pops a few coins into the slot and pushes 'A'.

 The machine dutifully grinds out another nougat bar, which snags on
 the wire, like always, just before it can drop into the receptacle.

 Benson leans his hip against the machine and gives it a deft shove.
 The nougat bar shakes free immediately and drops into the receptacle..
 Satisfied, he retrieves his prize, digs his change out of the change
 cup, and heads back to his desk, already stuffing the end of the
 nougat bar into his mouth as he goes.

 Which do you mean, the vending machine or the merchandise?

 There are ten rows behind the Plexiglass front, labeled A through J,
 corresponding to the ten buttons on the side of the machine. Row A
 contains those filthy nougat bars that Benson can't seem to stop
 stuffing down his fat, greedy hole. Every other row contains Beechnut
 gum. That's it. Nothing but Beechnut, Beechnut and Beechnut.

 You hate Beechnut. You don't know anyone who doesn't hate Beechnut.
 Even Benson would probably start chewing on Furman's congealed coffee
 grinds before shelling out for a stick of fucking Beechnut...

 Hey, wait a minute.

 Down at the bottom, in row J, something is glinting. It's a little
 metal key. Second from the front. Right behind a stick of Beechnut.

 How the mighty freaking hell did that get in there?

 It's part of the joke. That must be it. Benson or Furman or that
 bastard Biedermeyer are sneaking around here somewhere, spying on you
 and laughing their asses off.

 You are abruptly seized by an acute desire to get that key, get it no
 matter what the cost, and cram it down some poor joker's throat.

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

 It's a little metal key, dangling right behind the first pack of
 Beechnut in row J. Damned if you know what it opens, though.

 You are currently feeling totally steamed.

 Getting down on your hands and knees and peering under the machine,
 you notice that one of the legs is slightly shorter than the other. A
 thin wooden shim has been wedged under the shorter leg, preventing the
 machine from wobbling.

 You also see a nickel which must have been dropped here earlier. You
 snooze, you lose, punk-ass, you think to yourself gleefully, pocketing
 the money.

 [You have just become a little bit less steamed.]

 The nickel disappears into the slot and rattles down into the guts of
 the machine.

 The machine beeps at you -- not enough money!

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

 You are unable to.

 Like most vending machines, it is essentially a refrigerator-sized box
 with a glass front, behind which can be seen several rows of assorted
 treats. There is a panel of buttons to the side, beneath which is a
 slot for coins, a bill changer for paper money, and a cup for your
 change. Insert your money, make your selection, and your snack drops
 from the appropriate row into the receptacle bin at the bottom of the
 machine.

 (the panel of buttons)
 The machine beeps at you -- not enough money!

>examine bill changer
 It says "Insert bill in any direction," but that is clearly a gross
 misrepresentation of the facts.

 (the crumpled dollar bill in the vending machine)
 It isn't enough, sometimes, to simply know that your efforts are
 hopeless; sometimes you really have to watch yourself fail one more
 time -- just to drive the point home.

 Carefully, painstakingly, you smooth the crumpled bill as best you
 can, then gently prod one end of it into the bill changer. The
 mechanism inside catches it, drags it in and starts working it over.
 When it finally spits the bill back out with a self-satisfied buzzing
 sound, the dollar looks even more masticated than it did before.

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

 You pry the shim out from under the vending machine, which wobbles a
 bit as the little wedge pops free.

>examine shim
 It's a thin wedge, made of wood.

 Violence has never worked on this machine before, but who knows?
 Perhaps today's the day. You set your shoulder against the side of the
 machine and give it a good shove. The vending machine rocks back
 alarmingly, much more than you'd intended, and pauses on the very
 brink of tipping... but doesn't.

 You breathe a sigh of relief.

 Then it rocks the other way, toward you. And it overbalances. And
 falls. Your struggle to push the 1,500-pound machine back to an
 upright position is vicious but very, very short.

 Stay frosty, you think desperately, stay frosty, stay frosty, just
 stay fr--

 Snack Bar
 What few pathetic nods to biological necessity are allowed by the firm
 have been shoved away into the northeast corner. There's a coffee
 maker in the corner, a vending machine against the east wall, and a
 door to the restroom to the north.

 The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you.

 A simple device: push the black button on top, and it pisses a cupful
 of tepid nastiness into the little dispenser beneath. Not that you'd
 want it to. Furman's the only one who'll drink the revolting stuff.

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

 The restroom door wheezes shut behind you as you pass through.
 Predictably, the smoke detector goes off as soon as you walk through
 the door, cutting through your skull like a dull bone saw.

 Restroom
 Every wall, fixture and counter surface in this restroom is painted an
 intolerably bright, eye-bending nuclear orange. The reasoning behind
 this choice of decor is unclear -- perhaps the hope is that someone
 who is tense enough to crack walnuts with his ass cheeks isn't going
 to be spending lots of time on a toilet seat. Anyway, there's a sink
 and mirror in the north wall, and a stall to the east. Or you could
 just leave to the south.

 The plastic smoke detector is stuck to the center of the ceiling like
 a crazy orange limpet.

 The fire extinguisher is sitting in its usual corner, gathering dust.

 The smoke detector is still shrieking.

 That piece of crap hasn't detected so much as a bugfart since the day
 they installed it. It only (and always) goes off whenever someone
 actually enters the bathroom, letting forth with a piercing shriek
 high enough to break up kidney stones. A further deterrent for anyone
 too comatose to be bothered by the paint, probably.

 That whine is killing you. Your head feels like it's trying to give
 birth to a crazed, pecking kiwi-bird. It's no good, you can't stay
 frosty here; desperately, half-blind from the swirling orange
 holocaust pressing in on you from all sides, you lurch to the door and
 stumble out into the office.

 Snack Bar

 The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you.

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

>go south

 Benson's Corner

 On the desk are a half-eaten nougat bar and some scattered papers.

 That lazy son of a bitch Benson is perched on his precious stool,
 leaning back against the files with his feet up on the desk like
 always.

>take bar
 "Hey!" snaps Benson. "Keep your hands off the nougat, buddy!"

 Which do you mean, the scattered papers or the paperwork?

 Benson habitually keeps his papers in a state of hopeless mess,
 scattered all over his desk.

>examine cabinets
 The filing cabinets cover the entire east wall. Their drawers are
 perpetually closed. You've never even seen Benson go into them; then
 again, you've never handed him a stamped request form, either.

 (first taking the scattered papers)
 You've got enough papers to push on your own desk without pushing any
 of Benson's.

>go west

 Your Corner

 On the desk are an in-tray (which is empty), an out-tray (which is
 empty) and a telephone.

>go north

 Furman's Corner
 The northwest corner is Furman's area. Everything is tucked away and
 tidy, which is exactly how that obsessive freak likes it. The
 photocopier squats over by the west wall, and a short corridor to the
 north leads to that bastard Biedermeyer's office.

 On the desk are a microfiche reader and a file request form.

 Furman's jacket is hanging neatly up on its hook, just like always.

 Furman himself is hunched over his precious microfiche reader,
 ignoring you completely.

>ask furman about memo
 Furman frowns. "If you got a memo, it didn't come through me. And I
 refuse to believe that Biedermeyer would have sent you a message
 personally. Which means the memo is most likely unauthorized." He
 turns away from you with a sniff. "If I were you, I'd take it straight
 to Biedermeyer. I won't have anything to do with it."

 Neat, creased and free of lint. It's enough to make you sick.

 Benson won't let anyone check out files unless they hand him a stamped
 file request form. Of course, you're not authorized to keep forms on
 your own desk -- you're forced to beg them off that son of a bitch
 Furman. This one, however, might be free for the taking, if Furman
 doesn't catch you. It looks like this one's already been filled out.

 You deftly swipe the file request form from Furman's desk. He's so
 absorbed with his reader, he doesn't even notice. Serves him right, if
 he gets in trouble for losing it.

 [You have just become a little bit less steamed.]

 Benson won't let anyone check out files unless they hand him a stamped

 already been filled out.

 (with the ink stamp)
 Carefully, you stamp the form right over the signature blank, pressing
 down good and hard to make it dark. If Benson doesn't look to closely,
 he'll never notice that Furman hasn't authorized it.

 Benson's Corner

 On the desk are a half-eaten nougat bar and some scattered papers.

 That lazy son of a bitch Benson is perched on his precious stool,
 leaning back against the files with his feet up on the desk like
 always.

 Someone taps you on the shoulder. You turn around, and are startled to
 find that son of a bitch Furman away from his desk.

 "Excuse me," he says in his most irritated voice, "I was looking for
 that." He plucks the file request form from your hand. "It's my last
 one, and anyway you aren't authorized to use them."

 He sort of sniffs at you, then turns around and minces back to his
 desk.

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

 Since this is the southeast corner of the office, you can only go
 north, west or northwest from here.

 It's disgusting; Benson's been gnawing on it for God knows how long,
 and the end is all soft and melted and covered with Benson's slobber.

 (first taking the half-eaten nougat bar)
 "Hey!" snaps Benson. "Keep your hands off the nougat, buddy!"

 Benson takes another bite of his nougat bar and sets it back on his
 desk, ruminating thoughtfully.


 Furman's Corner

 On the desk are a file request form and a microfiche reader.

 Furman's jacket is hanging neatly up on its hook, just like always.

 Furman himself is hunched over his precious microfiche reader,
 ignoring you completely.

 Short Corridor
 This short, empty corridor connects the main office area, to the
 south, with Biedermeyer's office, to the north.

 The door to Biedermeyer's office is closed.

 A shiver runs up your back. You never come here. No one ever comes
 here. You are finding it decidedly difficult to stay frosty.

 You can't, since the door to Biedermeyer's office is in the way.

 It seems to be locked.

 What do you want to knock?

 Timidly, you knock on the door. No one answers.

 "Excuse me," Furman says, waving you off, "please don't touch my
 clothes."

>take form
 Taken.

 Furman loves that reader; it's like his special toy. He never lets
 anyone else touch it -- says it's "too complicated," though it can't
 be that difficult if a terminal moron like Furman can operate it.
 Anyway, the only controls are a toggle switch and a small button.
 The microfiche reader is currently switched on.

 On the desk are a file request form and a microfiche reader.

 Furman's jacket is hanging neatly up on its hook, just like always.

 Furman himself is hunched over his precious microfiche reader,
 ignoring you completely.

 Furman whirs through some more text on the microfiche reader. He makes
 some clicking noises with his tongue, and scribbles down a few notes.

 "Hands off," snaps Furman, slapping your hand away. "This is a
 delicate piece of equipment."


 Your Corner

 On the desk are an in-tray (which is empty), an out-tray (which is
 empty) and a telephone.


 Snack Bar

 The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you.

 You are carrying a wooden shim, a memo, some paperwork, a little white
 bottle (which is closed), a little gray bottle (which is closed), an
 ink stamp and a crumpled dollar bill.


 Snack Bar
 What few pathetic nods to biological necessity are allowed by the firm
 have been shoved away into the northeast corner. There's a coffee
 maker in the corner, a vending machine against the east wall, and a
 door to the restroom to the north.

 The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you.

 A simple device: push the black button on top, and it pisses a cupful
 of tepid nastiness into the little dispenser beneath. Not that you'd
 want it to. Furman's the only one who'll drink the revolting stuff.

 Which do you mean, the black button or the panel of buttons?

 The coffee maker shudders as though straining to pass a gallstone, and
 after a moment a plastic cup drops into its small dispenser. Then,
 with a horrible, thick gurgling sound, it spews a generous amount of
 terrible-smelling coffee into the cup. Voila; your swill is served.

 The bottles are where you keep your pills. Your pills are extremely
 important; sometimes, they're the only way you can stay frosty around
 here. One bottle contains your headache pills, the other your sleeping
 pills. Unfortunately, you've spent so much time gripping and squeezing
 and twisting the child-proof caps that the labels have long since
 rubbed away, and now you can never remember which is which.

 (the nasty coffee)
 Taken.

>open white bottle
 You open the little white bottle, revealing some gray pills.

>take gray pill
 You toss one into your mouth and swallow it dry. It scrapes down your
 throat like a chunk of gravel.

>put gray pill in cofee

 You drop one of the gray pills into the coffee, where it instantly
 dissolves into the murky depths.

 Furman's Corner

 On the desk are a file request form and a microfiche reader.

 Furman's jacket is hanging neatly up on its hook, just like always.

 Furman himself is hunched over his precious microfiche reader,
 ignoring you completely.

 Furman whirs through some more text on the microfiche reader. "Oh, ho
 ho," he chortles. He winks disgustingly at you and lays his finger
 alongside his nose.

>give coffee to furman
 "Hey, thanks," Furman says, hardly even glancing at you. He swills
 down some coffee, wipes his chin with the back of his hand, puts the
 cup on his desk and turns back to his microfiche.

>wait
 Time passes.

 Furman takes another sip of coffee, his eyes never leaving the
 microfiche screen.

>examine coffee
 The coffee is thick and sludgy looking, with a thin, oily film
 skimming the surface.

>open gray bottle
 You open the little gray bottle, revealing some white pills.

>put white pill in coffee
 You drop one of the white pills into the coffee, where it instantly
 dissolves into the murky depths. Furman, absorbed with his microfiche
 reader, doesn't even notice.

 Furman takes another sip of coffee, his eyes never leaving the
 microfiche screen.

 Time passes.

 Time passes.

 Time passes.

 Furman whirs through some more text on the microfiche reader. "Hmm,"
 he mutters, "very interesting..."

 That's already open.

 Furman leans back from the microfiche, rubs his eyes and lets forth a
 jaw-cracking yawn. "Man, am I beat," he says, and then pitches
 headfirst across his desk like a pole-axed buffalo.

 Clearly, your pharmacopeial cocktail must have shagged him -- the
 whites are obviously the sleeping pills. Potent ones, by the look of
 it.

 [You have just become a little bit more frosty.]

 Taken.

 Nothing. Not even a molecule of pocket lint.


 Benson's Corner

 On the desk are a half-eaten nougat bar and some scattered papers.

 That lazy son of a bitch Benson is perched on his precious stool,
 leaning back against the files with his feet up on the desk like
 always.

 Benson takes the file request form, squints at it, turns it
 upside-down, then looks you over suspiciously. He checks the form
 again. He scratches his head.

 "Well," he says finally, "all right... but try to stamp it closer to
 the edge next time, will you?"

 He turns his back to you and starts digging through the file cabinets.

 [You have just become a little bit more frosty.]

>give form to benson
 You can't see any such thing.

>take bar
 Taken.

>take stool
 "Take a hike," snaps Benson. "I need this stool to reach the high
 files. You want one, get your own."

 Benson turns back to you, shaking his head. "I can't find that file
 anywhere -- hey!" He leans over and snatches the sticky nougat bar
 from you. "Get your own, if you're that hungry!"

 Benson stretches his arms noisily.

 [You have just become a little bit less frosty.]

>undo
 Benson's Corner
 [Previous turn undone.]

>eat bar
 You take a deep breath and scarf down the nougat bar. Almost
 immediately you begin to gag -- the stuff is essentially nothing but
 sawdust and cushion stuffing coated with a thin layer of brown, edible
 paste. But you force it down anyway, gobbling the whole thing in a
 matter of seconds.

 Benson turns back to you, shaking his head. "I can't find that file
 anywhere in our archives," he says. "Sorry."

 [You have just become a little bit less frosty.]


 Snack Bar

 The vending machine stands there silently. Mocking you.

 Time passes.

 Benson strolls by and heads straight for the vending machine, ignoring
 you completely. He pops a few coins into the slot and pushes 'A'.

 The machine dutifully grinds out another nougat bar, which snags on
 the wire, like always, just before it can drop into the receptacle.

 Benson leans his hip against the machine and gives it a deft shove.
 The machine rocks back alarmingly, comes forward again, overbalances
 and tips over. Benson never even sees it coming. Glass breaks,
 Beechnut flies everywhere, and the machine, which weighs in excess of
 1,500 pounds, crushes the hapless son of a bitch before he can even
 squawk for help.

 Satisfying; very satisfying. Looks like Benson and the machine both
 got what was coming to them. By pitting your enemies against one
 another, you've come out on top.

 [You have just become a little bit more frosty.]

 Taken.

 [You have just become a little bit more frosty.]

 You can't see any such thing.

 The machine is lying face down, its innards smashed and scattered
 across the floor. A ragged hole has been hacked into the back of the
 machine like some sort of crude, mechanical nephrectomy scar,
 providing access to the inner workings.

 It's a lot of mechanical stuff, mostly beyond you. Anyway, it never
 worked right when it was intact, so why should it be of any use now?

>examine benson
 Benson is finished; the heavy vending machine squashed him like bug
 under a brick. He lies face up and spread-eagled, half-under the
 vending machine, his glasses slightly askew.

>take glasses
 Gingerly you tug at the glasses, but they don't seem to want to come
 off. Looking closely, you see that this is because they seem to be
 attached directly to Benson's flesh, right behind the ears.

 Pulling a little harder, you notice that the skin is in fact giving a
 little bit, pulling away from Benson's head like the edge of a rubber
 mask. And underneath the edge of skin, you can see...

 ... you can see something blue.

 At that precise moment, Biedermeyer walks up behind you.

 "Ah, thank you, but there's no need to mess with that," he says.
 Instinctively you jerk your hand away from the glasses and drop your
 gaze to the floor.

 "I know you want to help and all but, well... you know how it is.
 Everything's fine here, everything's under control," says Biedermeyer
 awkwardly. "Your concern is appreciated, but there's, uh, there's
 really nothing more you can do." Effortlessly, he lifts the vending
 machine with one hand and pulls Benson's corpse out from under it with
 the other. "Go ahead and get on back to work now. Thank you." And he
 hauls off Benson as casually as if he had just cleaned up a spilled
 soda.

 [You have just become a little bit less frosty.]

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

 (first taking the scattered papers)
 You've got enough papers to push on your own desk without pushing any

 You can't see any such thing.

 You gingerly lift up a couple of sheets of paper, and discover a pair
 of scissors underneath.

 Benson's Corner

>take scissors
 Taken.

 The filing cabinets cover the entire east wall. Their drawers are
 perpetually closed. You've never even seen Benson go into them; then
 again, you've never handed him a stamped request form, either.

 Well, except for today, anyway.

 Eagerly, you pull open a drawer and start riffling through the manila
 folders inside, but all the folders in that drawer are empty. You slam
 the drawer shut and open another one. Those folders are empty, too.
 Drawer after drawer, each filled with manila folders, each manila
 folder blank and empty. These worthless filing cabinets have nothing
 in them, nothing in them at all.

 [You have just become a little bit less frosty.]

>open drawer
 It's just empty folders. All of it. There's absolutely nothing in
 here.

 It's an ordinary-looking desk. A bit smaller then yours, but everybody

 Furman's Corner

 On the desk are Furman, a plastic cup (in which is some nasty coffee)
 and a microfiche reader.

 Furman's jacket is hanging neatly up on its hook, just like always.

>examine reader
 Furman loves that reader; it's like his special toy. He never lets
 anyone else touch it -- says it's "too complicated," though it can't
 be that difficult if a terminal moron like Furman can operate it.
 Anyway, the only controls are a toggle switch and a small button.
 The microfiche reader is currently switched on.

 Furman is sprawled across his desk, totally gone. His glasses seem to
 have gone crooked.

>take glasses
 Time to get to the bottom of this, goddammit -- you give the glasses a
 determined yank, stripping away a large swatch of Furman's face along
 with it.

 The head underneath is small and perfectly round, like a shot-put
 ball. The skin is a uniform, creamy, day-dreamy blue. And the eyes...

 Good jesus god almighty the eyes--

 "Go back to your desk now," Biedermeyer says brusquely, stepping
 between you and the body. He slips the glasses from your numb fingers.
 "There's work to be done."

 You turn away, stomach heaving, as that bastard Biedermeyer bundles
 away the body. When you finally look back, both Biedermeyer and Furman
 are gone. As if nothing had ever happened.

 [You have just become a little bit less frosty.]

>examine toggle
 It's a simple toggle switch with a symbol at either end, like this:

    O
    !
    X

 The switch is currently pointing toward 'O'.

>examine jacket
 Neat, creased and free of lint. It's enough to make you sick.

>search it
 Nothing. Not even a molecule of pocket lint.

>take it
 You pull Furman's jacket down, leaving the empty hanger dangling on
 the hook.

 Taken.

 The microfiche reader is currently switched on.

 Finally! A peek at Furman's precious little secrets...

 What the hell...?!

 The screen is filled with nothing but line after line of scrambled
 mumbo-jumbo. There's nothing to this piece-of-crap microfiche reader
 at all. That son of a bitch Furman's been playing you for a sucker
 this whole time!

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

>examine small button
 It's a simple button, labeled with a symbol like this:


>push it
 The text scrolls past in a bright blur.

>examine machine
 Which do you mean, the microfiche reader or the photocopier?

 The photocopier isn't open.

>examine photocopier
 The photocopier is a hulking technological monstrosity that you've
 never been able to satisfactorily figure out. It's got about fourteen
 billion buttons on it and the only one you know how to use is the big
 green one marked 'COPY'. There's also a lid on top (paper goes in),
 and a small hopper off to one side (paper comes out). That's as
 familiar as you've ever cared to (or are ever likely to) get with this
 thing.

 Currently, the lid is closed and the hopper is empty.

 You open the copier. There is nothing on the glass.

 You put the crumpled dollar bill on the glass.

 (the big green button)
 The machine beeps at you; it won't copy anything unless you close the
 lid first.

>close lid
 You close the photocopier.

 That's already closed.

 (the big green button)
 The copier vibrates ominously as its inner workings begin to churn. A
 ghastly light seeps out from under the edges of the lid, there is a
 terrible noise like a wet canvas being sucked through a mail slot...

 ... and a copy of the dollar bill drops out the other side and lands
 in the hopper.

>open lid
 You open the copier. On the glass is the original crumpled dollar
 bill.

>take bill
 (the original crumpled dollar bill)
 Taken.

 (the big green button)
 Big, green and friendly. You can't go wrong with 'COPY'.

>take copy
 (the big green button)
 That's fixed in place.

 It's a reasonable facsimile of a dollar bill, although it's not going
 to fool anybody as long as it's just a picture of a dollar bill in the
 middle of an eight and a half by eleven inch sheet of paper.

 Carefully, you cut the excess paper from around the image of the
 dollar bill. The end product is a little ragged around the edges, but
 otherwise not too shabby.

 [You have just become a little bit less steamed.]

>go northeast
 If you feel like visiting that bastard Biedermeyer, you can go north;
 otherwise you can wander around the rest of the office to the east,
 south or southeast.

>go east

 Snack Bar

 The vending machine is lying face down and smashed amidst a pile of
 nougat bars and Beechnut gum.

 There's a ragged hole hacked into the east wall, where the vending
 machine used to stand.

 Why bother?

 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory
 You are carrying the original crumpled dollar bill, a hanger, Furman's
 jacket, a pair of scissors, the stool, a shiny key, a wooden shim, a
 memo, some paperwork, a little white bottle (which is open), inside
 which are some gray pills, a little gray bottle (which is open),
 inside which are some white pills and an ink stamp.

 Which do you mean, the hole in the wall or the broken vending machine?

 You hunker down and peer into the hole. It appears to go all the way
 through the wall, but you can't see anything but empty darkness on the
 other side.

>go east
 You can go north to the restroom if you want, though you might want to
 save yourself some agony and just drive something sharp into your
 bladder, instead. Otherwise, there's west, southwest or south.

 through. It's in roughly the same place that the hole in the vending
 machine would be, if the vending machine were still standing against
 the wall.

>reach in hole in wall

 The restroom door wheezes shut behind you as you pass through.
 Predictably, the smoke detector goes off as soon as you walk through

 The plastic smoke detector is stuck to the center of the ceiling like

 too comatose to be bothered by the paint, probably.

 Restroom (on the stool)
 Every wall, fixture and counter surface in this restroom is painted an
 intolerably bright, eye-bending nuclear orange. The reasoning behind
 this choice of decor is unclear -- perhaps the hope is that someone
 who is tense enough to crack walnuts with his ass cheeks isn't going
 to be spending lots of time on a toilet seat. Anyway, there's a sink
 and mirror in the north wall, and a stall to the east. Or you could
 just leave to the south.

 The gutted smoke detector hangs limply from the ceiling, its innards
 exposed and dangling.

 You're looking sharp as ever.

>unlock it with key
 You can't reach the bolt from outside the stall.

 There's only a few inches between the bottom of the stall door the
 bathroom floor, not nearly enough to crawl under.

>unlock it with hanger
 You jam the coat hanger through the narrow gap and wiggle it around
 until it hooks onto the sliding bolt. Then, with a jerk, you pull the

 Bathroom Stall
 Other than the nauseating paint job, there's not much to distinguish
 this bathroom stall from the thousands of similar ilk. Toilet; toilet
 paper dispenser; the door to your west; that's pretty much it.

 Funny, though. As familiar as all this is, you're sure you've never
 seen the inside of this particular stall before. As far as you can
 remember, you've never been in here at all.

>score
 You are currently feeling totally frosty.

 Nothing, not even any water. Not even, you note with some confusion, a
 hole for the water to drain through. That's right, just a featureless
 porcelain bowl.

>close door
 You close the stall door.

>examine door
 Interesting. You've never seen it from this side before.

 A little metal box bolted to the side of the stall. There is no toilet
 paper in it.

>look in it
 No toilet paper in there; not a single square.

> x toilet
 Your standard fixture, sculpted from harsh orange porcelain.

>take dispenser
 That's hardly portable.

>flush toilet
 There's no handle, no chain, no button. No way to flush it. And
 nothing in it to flush anyway.

 You turn around and lower yourself onto the seat. Aside from the fact
 that you are now facing the other direction, little has changed.

>look up
 The ceiling is painted bright orange, just like everything else.

>examine walls
 The walls here are painted bright orange, just like everything else.

>examine floor
 The floor is paved with bright orange linoleum tile.

 You give the toilet a good, hard thump. You thump it again, a bit
 harder this time. Next thing you know, you're pounding on the toilet
 again and again for all you're worth -- you stop yourself, feeling a
 bit light-headed. Damn. You hate it when that happens.

>examine tile
 The floor is paved with bright orange linoleum tile.

 A little metal box bolted to the side of the stall. There is no toilet
 paper in it.

 There's also a little keyhole on the side facing the toilet. You
 didn't notice it before, since you were looking at it from the other
 side.

 You insert the shiny key into the keyhole and twist it clockwise. A
 mechanism inside the toilet paper dispenser clicks, and the bathroom
 is filled with a rumbling sound. Suddenly, the entire rear wall of the
 stall spins on a hidden axis, taking the toilet and yourself along
 with it...


 Behind the Restroom (on the toilet)
 You're in a narrow, irregular passageway behind the east wall of the
 restroom. The walls are all dust and splintered wood and ragged
 plaster, and the floor is bare concrete.

 A thin, cringing man in the tattered remains of a business suit is
 standing here, grinning and cracking his knuckles.

 You wonder if any of the others know about this place. You sure as
 hell didn't.

 The thin man grabs your hand and starts pumping it vigorously before
 you can even get up off the toilet.

 "Hi there," he says breathlessly. "Robertson. You must have gotten my
 message."

 [You have just become a little bit more frosty.]

 A decrepit scarecrow of a man, Robertson appears to be in the advanced
 stages of some sort of horrific drug withdrawal. He jitters, frets,
 drools occasionally, and cracks his knuckles obsessively.

 Also, you notice, he has a couple of odd scars on his head, one right
 behind each ear.

 "I've been waiting back here for I don't know how long," he pants.
 "They tried to get me, too, you know?"

 Robertson recoils. "Don't ever let them put those on you! Don't EVER
 let them!" He rubs convulsively behind his ears. "Almost got me, you
 know. Almost made me love myself!"

 "They tried to teach me... " Robertson suddenly straightens up, darts
 his skinny head around like a spooked heron. He cracks his knuckles a
 few times. Then he leans in close. "They tried to teach me how to
 love," he whispers.

 Time passes.

 "But I got away, you know?" Robertson grins, and does a weird,
 shuffling sort of jig. "Dug my way back here. They can't find me.
 Don't know where to look. You know? I'm still digging, too. Pretty
 soon I'll break through to the outside, and then I'm out of here."

 At the moment, you can't think of anything intelligent to say about
 that, so you wisely keep your mouth shut. No point in looking stupid.

 At the moment, you can't think of anything intelligent to say about
 that, so you wisely keep your mouth shut. No point in looking stupid.

 Robertson shudders. "Worst thing about him is, we all know who he is,
 you know?" We just can't say."

 Robertson snaps his fingers and makes a sound like a rocket ship
 lifting off. "Out of here," he whispers.

 "I bored right through it with this," Robertson says, showing you the
 letter opener. "That's how I got my food, you know? That's how I put
 the key out for you."

 "Yeah, that was me," says Robertson. "Slipped it into the machine, you
 know? Through the back. Figured no one'd be looking for it. Except
 you. Hee, hee," he giggles.

 "That's my secret way in, you know." Robertson grins and hunches his
 shoulders. "Like Batman."

>ask man about memo
 "It was pretty tricky, getting that note into your box, you know?"
 Robertson says. "But I did it. Can't tell you how -- it's a secret.
 But I had help. Chubby pink fairies." Robertson looks around
 furtively. "That's all I can say... for now."

 Robertson nods vigorously, but you're not sure whether he really
 comprehends a word you're saying.

 "Took them even longer to change him than it did Furman." Robertson
 nodes. "Wouldn't have thought it, looking at him, you know? He was
 slippery. Not slippery enough, though, know what I mean? Ha! Ha!"

 Robertson nods vigorously, but you're not sure whether he really
 comprehends a word you're saying.

 "Yeah, he went down pretty fast, you know? First to go." Robertson
 bears his teeth. "Scuttling little yes-man. A fucking beetle."

>ask man about me
 "Been watching you, you know? You're different; I can tell. Why I sent
 you the note."

 At the moment, you can't think of anything intelligent to say about
 that, so you wisely keep your mouth shut. No point in looking stupid.

 Which do you mean, Robertson, Benson, Furman or Biedermeyer?

 Robertson smiles. "That's me, know what I mean? Me. Is me. Not them."
 He taps the scars behind either ear with his index fingers. "Got away,
 see, and now I'm Robertson. I'm still me."

 Robertson suddenly grabs you by the shirt front. "That's what I've
 been trying to tell you, man! That's what's going on out there" That's
 what they're turning into! That's what they're trying to turn YOU
 into!"

 Robertson shakes his head, and will say no more.


 Behind the Restroom (on the toilet)
 You're in a narrow, irregular passageway behind the east wall of the
 restroom. The walls are all dust and splintered wood and ragged
 plaster, and the floor is bare concrete.

 Robertson hovers nearby, smiling and cringing like a pathetic
 sycophant.

 As soon as you stand up, the wall spins again, whisking the toilet
 away and leaving you with nothing but a blank wall.

 Enter saved game to store: Ok.


 Behind the Snack Bar
 More of the same dirty, broken passageway. It looks as though the
 entire east wall of the office has been hollowed out from one end to
 the other.

 A ragged hole in the west wall lets a dusty beam of light in.

 Robertson follows you, fawning and cringing by turns. He points to the
 ragged hole. "Dug that out myself, you know?" he says proudly. "With
 this." He shows you a steel letter opener, its blade scratched and
 pitted. "Only way to get food. Guy's got to eat, you know?"

 Robertson giggles suddenly, and then looks at you as though he
 seriously suspects you of being stark barking mad.

 Then he smiles. "Got a water cache, too," he says, jerking his thumb
 toward the south end of the passage. "They're scared of water, you
 know? Can't stand the stuff. That's why nothing works around here. I
 managed to get some, though, so they won't be coming round here
 anytime soon, know what I mean?" And he throws his head back and
 laughs.

 "Only thing they're afraid of, you know," whispers Robertson. "Can't
 stand the touch of it. Won't have it anywhere near them."

 "My private stash," says Robertson. He gives you a sly look. "It's
 right up ahead," he says, gesturing toward the south end of the
 corridor.

>examine hole
 It's about six inches across, just big enough to put your fist
 through. It's in roughly the same place that the hole in the vending
 machine would be, if the vending machine were still standing against
 the other side of the wall.

>go south

 Behind Benson's Corner
 The passage narrows to a tight squeeze at the south end, little more
 than a glorified crack in the plaster, really.

 An ancient, dusty water cooler is stashed way back in the far corner.

 Most of the limited floor space is occupied by a large metal drawer
 sticking out of the western wall at roughly knee-level. You have to
 practically climb over it to maneuver.

 You realize suddenly that Robertson has become very quiet. A dim
 reflection in the curved, plastic side of the water tank catches your
 eye.

 You whirl around, fists up and swinging. But the shifty bastard is too
 quick for you. He fends off your bare knuckles with a strength born of
 desperation, and plunges the blade into your throat. You go down
 gurgling. That crazy son of a bitch never stops grinning at you like a
 starving hyena, the whole damn time.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>examine cooler
 It's an old office water cooler -- you're not sure how you recognize
 it, but you're sure you've seen one before. There's a plastic spigot
 poking out the front, and there's even a little bit of water sloshing
 around in the tank.

 Robertson suddenly lunges at you, screaming, "GUY'S GOTTA EAT YOU
 KNOW! GUY'S GOTTA EAT YOU KNOW!!"

>examine reflection
 The tank is a cylinder of clear, thick plastic sitting on top of the
 water cooler. There's a small quantity of water down in the bottom of
 the tank.

 Growling and foaming like an animal, Robertson lunges again, and this
 time he's too quick for you. The letter opener punches through your
 abdomen and breaks off halfway down the blade. As you sink to your
 knees, clutching your gut, Robertson kicks you over onto your back,
 sits on your chest, and plunges the jagged stump of the letter opener
 into your throat again and again, drooling and yelping like a starved
 hyena all the while.

 You whirl around, swinging the heavy fire extinguisher like a golf
 club, in a rising arc that catches him right under the chin.
 Everything below his nose flattens up into his upper jaw like a cheap
 piece of origami. He hits the floor, his precious letter opener
 clattering from his limp fingers.

 Biedermeyer's Office
 Biedermeyer's inner sanctum: a featureless cube with smooth, gray
 walls, and his desk sitting in the exact center like a great black
 sarcophagus. There is one door. It is south.

 The door to Biedermeyer's office stands open.

 Biedermeyer taps his foot impatiently.

 The door slams shut behind you.

 Biedermeyer steps calmly around his desk. He takes a deep breath, and
 adjusts his glasses slightly. Then he looks at you and says, "Frankly,
 I don't know what we're going to do with you."

>ask biedermeyer about blue
 "Yes, I realize that must have been upsetting to see," Biedermeyer
 says, nodding patiently. "But you have only yourself to blame. Soon
 you would have been ready, if only you had played by the rules."

 "We tried," he goes on, his voice sad, "to provide you with an
 environment that was safe."

>ask biedermeyer about robertson
 "Ah, yes, poor Robertson," he sighs. "A failed experiment. One I'm not
 proud of. The blame is entirely mine, of course. I should have looked
 after him more closely." He chuckles. "I almost made the same mistake
 with you."

 "We tried to give you something familiar, something that you would
 have no trouble..." he pauses, searching mentally for the right word.

>ask biedermeyer about glasses
 Biedermeyer smiles. "It's good to see you finally taking an interest,"
 he says. "You would have been issued a pair yourself, soon, if you had
 only stuck with the program."

 "-- accommodating," he blurts suddenly. "Yes. Something you would have
 no trouble accommodating. We never wanted this to be anything other
 than a most pleasant experience for you."

>ask biedermeyer about program
 Biedermeyer spreads his hands in a curiously benedictory manner. "Why,
 this is your home," he says softly. "This is your salvation. Didn't
 you know that? This is your only hope of refuge from the demons that
 hounded you here from your former life. You should be grateful that we
 let you work here at all. I daresay, you could never find a better job
 than this, even if you spent your whole life trying."

 "God knows, you needed it after what you'd been through out there."

>ask biedermeyer about former life
 Biedermeyer shakes his head. "No remembering, now. Naughty, naughty."

 Biedermeyer gives you a stern look. "But that wasn't good enough for
 you, was it?"

>ask biedermeyer about furman
 Biedermeyer looks almost proud. "I couldn't ask for a more exemplary
 employee."

 "You had to fight us every step of the way, didn't you? You really
 thought that you knew better than us what was good for you. You
 thought you could heal all on your own."

>ask biedermeyer about demons
 Biedermeyer shakes his head. "No remembering, now. Naughty, naughty."

 Biedermeyer shakes his head. "Well, I must say I have no patience for
 that. And I do not feel sorry for you. I will not tolerate
 busy-bodies, know-betters, or rule-scoffers in my office."

 "It's high time you got used to it," says Biedermeyer ominously.
 "You're staying here for a long, long time."

 With a sharp tug, Biedermeyer pulls off his glasses. They come off
 with a small sucking sound. He rubs the bridge of his nose a bit, and
 when he looks up you can see translucent membranes nictitating briefly
 across his pupils.

>wait
 Time passes.

 "Your days of youthful rebellion are at an end, my boy," he says
 softly, stepping close to you. "I know you think this will be a bad
 thing, but I promise you: soon you will see that it had to be done.
 Soon you will see everything." And he reaches out while you are held
 paralyzed by his reptile gaze, and he slips the glasses onto your
 face.

 There is a brief burning sensation as something worms quickly into
 your skull behind each of your ears.

 "There, now," you hear Biedermeyer whisper, "isn't that better?"

 And the funny thing is -- it is. It is much better. And he's right --
 pretty soon, you DO see everything.

>throw water at biedermeyer
 With a convulsive jerk of your arm, you dash the water into the
 bastard's smug, repulsive face. Biedermeyer stops dead, silent, just
 blinking at you stupidly as the water drips down his skin.

 And then the hissing begins. And Biedermeyer's skin starts dripping
 along with the water.

 With a sudden, strangled shriek, Biedermeyer lurches backward, digging
 his nails into the flesh of his face. "Oh, you miserable little shit!"
 he yells. "What the bloody fuck have you done?" Already his voice is
 starting to slur, gurgling as though he were speaking through a
 mouthful of cold maple syrup.

 He turns to you, and his face is a dripping mess running with streaks
 of oozing blue. Whatever monstrous, cerulean visage lay behind his
 mask of skin is melting along with everything else. He holds his hands
 out to you imploringly -- the fingers are pouring away down his arms
 like superheated candle stubs.

 "Uh cuhd... uhf duhn... suh muhsh... fuh yuh..." he gurgles, and then
 his entire body slops down into itself, leaving nothing but a
 bluish-pinkish puddle of ooze on the floor, with his thick black
 glasses lying unharmed in the middle of it.

 A huge slab of black marble, shot through with soft veins of gray and

 Those damn glasses are still chafing. You wiggle them around on your
 nose a bit, trying to get comfortable.

>push small button
 The text scrolls past in a bright blur.

>look in reader
 You hesitate. The thought of looking at the screen again fills you
 with a vague sort of dread.

>remove glasses
 The glasses tug at your skin as you try to pull them off, gripping
 rather tightly at the flesh behind your ears. Unnerved, you pull
 harder -- and they suddenly pop free with a tiny sound like velcro.

 (the silver tile)
 It's a flat square of silvery metal, apparently blank on both sides.

 That's already on.

 The screen goes dark.

 The screen lights up with glowing lines of text.

>examine copy of bill
 You can't see any such thing.

>bill
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine bill
 Which do you mean, the counterfeit bill or the original crumpled
 dollar bill?

>counterfeit
 It wouldn't fool a person (it isn't green), but otherwise it's a
 pretty accurate reproduction of a dollar bill.


 Benson's Corner

 On the desk are some scattered papers.


 Snack Bar

 The vending machine is lying face down and smashed amidst a pile of
 nougat bars and Beechnut gum.

 There's a ragged hole hacked into the east wall, where the vending
 machine used to stand.

>go north
 The restroom door wheezes shut behind you as you pass through.

 Restroom

 The gutted smoke detector hangs limply from the ceiling, its innards
 exposed and dangling.

 You can also see the stool here.

>examine tiles
 The floor is paved with bright orange linoleum tile.

>wear glasses
 You settle the glasses firmly onto your nose. They fit rather tightly,
 chafing uncomfortably behind your ears.

 Your vision blurs momentarily as your eyes adjust to the strange
 lenses, but after a second or two you're seeing fine.

 Some random thought is nagging at you. You're not sure what it is.

>examine tiles
 The floor is paved with bright orange linoleum tile.

 Yeah. Think real hard.

 An odd prickling sensation crawls briefly along the back of your
 scalp, and your vision ripples again slightly. Funny; the glasses
 aren't chafing you anymore. They feel perfectly comfortable, in fact.

>remove tiles
 (first taking the floor)
 That's hardly portable.

>remove glasses
 The glasses grip your flesh behind the ears with a frightening
 suction. The harder you pull, the more it hurts.

 The fucking things won't come off!

 There's that nagging worry again. Something you were supposed to do,
 and forgot... what was it?

 [You have just become a little bit more steamed.]

 Short Corridor

 The door to Biedermeyer's office stands open.

 LITTLE BLUE MEN is now in its "verbose" mode, which always gives long
 descriptions of locations (even if you've been there before).

 Short Corridor
 This short, empty corridor connects the main office area, to the
 south, with Biedermeyer's office, to the north.

 The door to Biedermeyer's office stands open.

>go north

 Biedermeyer's Office
 Biedermeyer's inner sanctum: a featureless cube with smooth, gray
 walls, and his desk sitting in the exact center like a great black
 sarcophagus. There is one door. It is south.

 The door to Biedermeyer's office stands open.

 All that's left of that bastard Biedermeyer is a puddle of melted goo
 in the middle of the carpet.

>enter desk
 That's not something you can enter.

 A huge slab of black marble, shot through with soft veins of gray and
 polished to a glassy brilliance. It looks more like something you'd
 lay a dead king on than a place to put your paperwork; and sure
 enough, its slick, cool surface is utterly pristine.

 A slim, metallic drawer extends from the otherwise featureless side of
 the desk.

>enter drawer
 That's not something you can enter.

 You find nothing of interest.

>touch drawer
 You feel nothing unexpected.

 You try to pull the door closed, but it won't stay shut.

>open it
 The door is open already.

 It is ominously unobtrusive. A pane of pebbled glass allows light to
 come through, but prevents you from seeing anything on the other side.

 Your Corner
 This is your scratching ground, your own little slice of the shit pie
 these sons of bitches call an office -- and don't think for a second
 that you didn't have to fight like hell to get it. Neatly shoved away
 into the southwest corner of the general work area, where they think
 you can't get into any mischief.

 On the desk are an in-tray (which is empty), an out-tray (which is
 empty) and a telephone.

>examine phone
 Oh yeah, the phone. You can't make outgoing calls on it; there's no
 dial. You don't even know why it's on your desk. Presumably, you're
 expected to answer it if it rings, but it never does. Never has. Not
 once. Not ever.

>go northeast

 Snack Bar
 What few pathetic nods to biological necessity are allowed by the firm
 have been shoved away into the northeast corner. There's a coffee
 maker in the corner, a vending machine against the east wall, and a
 door to the restroom to the north.

 The vending machine is lying face down and smashed amidst a pile of
 nougat bars and Beechnut gum.

 There's a ragged hole hacked into the east wall, where the vending
 machine used to stand.

>examine buttons

>move machine
 You are unable to.

>take bar
 What the hell for? It's worthless garbage. Let that bastard
 Biedermeyer clean it up, if he wants.


 Benson's Corner
 As usual, Benson's corner of the office, is a filthy sty. Files,
 papers, supplies lying around everywhere. You don't know how anyone
 could work in these conditions. A vast bank of filing cabinets stands
 against the west wall, behind Benson's desk.

 On the desk are some scattered papers.

>inventory
 You are carrying a silver tile, some glasses, a letter opener, a
 plastic cup, a fire extinguisher, the original crumpled dollar bill, a
 hanger, Furman's jacket, a pair of scissors, a shiny key, a wooden
 shim, a memo, some paperwork, a little white bottle (which is open),
 inside which are some gray pills, a little gray bottle (which is
 open), inside which are some white pills and an ink stamp.

>Hmm. Anything else in B's office?
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>save
>cf1

>wear glasses
 You settle the glasses firmly onto your nose. They fit rather tightly,
 chafing uncomfortably behind your ears.

 Some random thought is nagging at you. You're not sure what it is.

 You can't see any such thing.

>wait
 Time passes.

 There's that nagging worry again. Something you were supposed to do,
 and forgot... what was it?

>think
 Yeah. Think real hard.
 Suddenly, you remember -- the paperwork! It never got filed! How could
 you have let a careless mistake slip by? You chide yourself, then
 remind yourself that it's been a hectic day -- anytime an office
 undergoes a 75% staff turnover, you can expect there's going to be a
 few loose ends left around when it's all over.

 Guess it's up to you to sort them out, then. Right?

 You take your ink stamp firmly in hand. It's time to get to work.
 You're looking forward to it, really. After all, this is where you've
 always wanted to be, doing what you've always wanted to do. You could
 never find a better job than this, even if you spent your whole life
 looking.

>push coin return
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine button
 You push it to get some coffee, if you think you can stomach it.

>break machine
 You give the broken vending machine a good, hard thump. You thump it
 again, a bit harder this time. Next thing you know, you're pounding on
 the broken vending machine again and again for all you're worth -- you
 stop yourself, feeling a bit light-headed. Damn. You hate it when that
 happens.

 It's a lot of mechanical stuff, mostly beyond you. Anyway, it never
 worked right when it was intact, so why should it be of any use now?

 Peering into the machine, you can see the bent and shattered inner
 mechanisms, but not much else.

 Well, except for today, anyway.

>examine ceiling
 The featureless grid of white, acoustical tiles hanging above your

 contains a softly humming fluorescent light.

 It's just empty folders. All of it. There's absolutely nothing in

 Your Corner
 This is your scratching ground, your own little slice of the shit pie
 these sons of bitches call an office -- and don't think for a second
 that you didn't have to fight like hell to get it. Neatly shoved away
 into the southwest corner of the general work area, where they think
 you can't get into any mischief.

 On the desk are an in-tray (which is empty), an out-tray (which is
 empty) and a telephone.

>go north

 Furman's Corner
 The northwest corner is Furman's area. Everything is tucked away and
 tidy, which is exactly how that obsessive freak likes it. The
 photocopier squats over by the west wall, and a short corridor to the
 north leads to that bastard Biedermeyer's office.

 On the desk is a microfiche reader.

>examine copier
 The photocopier is a hulking technological monstrosity that you've
 never been able to satisfactorily figure out. It's got about fourteen
 billion buttons on it and the only one you know how to use is the big
 green one marked 'COPY'. There's also a lid on top (paper goes in),
 and a small hopper off to one side (paper comes out). That's as
 familiar as you've ever cared to (or are ever likely to) get with this
 thing.

 Currently, the lid is open and the hopper contains a pile of shredded
 paper and a counterfeit bill.

>examine reader
 Furman loves that reader; it's like his special toy. He never lets
 anyone else touch it -- says it's "too complicated," though it can't
 be that difficult if a terminal moron like Furman can operate it.
 Anyway, the only controls are a toggle switch and a small button.
 The microfiche reader is currently switched on.

 It's a standard numeric keypad with keys from 0 to 9. It's looks
 simple enough, but you don't really know what it does.

>examine shredded
 You did a handsome job; there isn't a scrap left big enough to be
 recognizable.

>type 9070 on keypad
 As you punch in the final digit, the copier starts to hum. Ominously.
 It's never made that sound before; not even the time you got your
 necktie caught in the collator and, in a fit of panic, started
 bludgeoning the cables in back with Furman's rolodex. No, that was
 more of a guttural wheeze. This is most definitely a hum.

 Ever-wary, you take a few prudent steps back.

 Suddenly, the lid flies open! A blinding white light pours out through
 the glass, a coruscating torrent from the machine's inner core!

 This is it, you think, throwing up your arms to shield your eyes. The
 whole thing's going nova. I'll never be frosty again --

 ...and then the light is gone.

 Slowly, you open your eyes.

 Where the copier once stood, there is now only a slightly lighter
 patch of carpet...

 ...and a door.

 [You have just become a little bit more frosty.]

>score
 You are currently feeling very frosty.

>examine door
 It's an utterly plain wooden door, painted white. There is a brass
 doorknob on it.

>open door
 Timidly, you reach out and turn the brass doorknob. It turns smoothly.
 You take a deep breath. You pull the door open.

 The hinges creak, very slightly.

 Looking through the open doorway, you note with no small relief that
 the other side really is everything you'd always hoped it would be.
 Without an ounce of trepidation, you step through...








 Hillside
 You are standing at the top of a hill of velvety green, overlooking a
 scene of pastoral delight. In the valley below, young men and women in
 wispy robes frolic chastely about, dancing together amongst the
 wildflowers and the romping sheep. Everyone is laughing. Everyone has
 a pretty pink balloon that they hold by its string. It is innocence
 and carefree, everywhere you look.

 Also, you notice immediately, you are naked. Completely naked. This
 doesn't bother you as much as part of you thinks it should.

 The sun is just setting, and the sky is the beautiful color of the
 inside of seashells.

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

 As you stand there, dumbfounded, you notice something large and pink
 gently bobbing toward you from out of the gorgeous sky. As it draws
 closer, you see that it is a naked fat man. He alights on the grass
 next to you and smiles in greeting.

 "Welcome," he says in a comfortingly avuncular voice.

>ask man about fairy
 He smiles and answers, "My job is merely to ensure that your
 transition here is as comfortable as possible.

 "We were hoping you would make it. It's been a long, difficult time
 for you, I know. But you'll find it much different here."

>ask man about blue
 "All that is behind you now," says the fat naked man.

 "You'll need these," he tells you, handing you a pink balloon and a
 gown of diaphanous material. "They'll help you fit in. We've tried to
 provide an environment for you that is safe. Something that you'll
 have no trouble," he adds, indicating the valley with a sweep of his
 pudgy hand, "...accommodating."

 "All that is behind you now," says the fat naked man.

 "Well, enjoy your stay," says the fat naked man, clapping you heartily
 on the back. "Don't misbehave, now." He raises his eyebrows and taps
 the side of his nose, and for the first time you notice that he's
 wearing thick, black-framed glasses.

 "Remember to stay frosty," he says as he floats away into the sunset.

 But you hardly hear him. You are filled with a rapture, a fantastic
 sense of belonging like you have never before felt, as you skip down
 the hillside, balloon in hand. The young men and women welcome you
 with open arms, and everywhere sheep are bleating.

 You know, then, that you could never find a better place than this,
 even if you spent your whole life looking.

     *** You have learned to love yourself ***


 In this game, you have finally managed to love life.

 This, technically, is the actual "end" of the game. You can RESTART,
 RESTORE and all that jazz, if you want to, just like usual, or you can
 read the author's POSTSCRIPT.









 "What? Are you shitting me? THIS is how it ends?!?"

 Well, yes. It took me weeks to figure out what the ending of this game
 should be, and when the land of fat naked men finally dawned on me, I
 realized that it was the only ending that could possibly make sense
 and still be true to the story.

 Then, later, I decided that it was really just a cheap, cop-out,
 shaggy dog ending and a lot of people would be pissed at me.

 Now I'm kind of leaning the other way again.

 But it's also occurred to me that I could use this unconventional
 ending as an opportunity to take an analytical crowbar, if you will,
 to certain pre-conceived notions we have about how IF is structured. I
 don't want to attach too much unwarranted significance to this: I
 didn't, after all, start out writing this game with these themes in
 mind. But various comments from my beta-testers got me thinking about
 these ideas, and I think they might be worth discussing, so I'll just
 pass them right along to you.

 So let this, then, be my actual contribution to IF Comp '98. If even
 one of these points gets mentioned on RAIF, I will feel just as
 rewarded as though I were already popping open that can of Ass-Kickin'
 Peanuts.

 Think about it, for a minute:

 Is this the most "optimal" ending in the game?
 (And I don't mean just because you get to read this postscript!)

 Are any of the endings in the game "optimal"?
 (I will maintain that getting crushed by the vending machine is a
 definite loser; otherwise, any ending is up for grabs.)

 Is this ending true to the story? Was it inevitable? Could this story
 have ended any other way?

 Do the motivations of the main character in a work of IF always need
 to be the same as the motivations of the person playing it? What if
 the main character is thoroughly dislikable, or his motivations
 morally repugnant?

 Does the ultimate goal of the main character in a work of IF always
 need to coincide with what the player feels is the "optimal" ending?

 If what is optimal for the player doesn't jive with what is optimal
 for the main character, then how does one "win" the game?

 Maybe you should have just tossed the paperwork in the out-tray a
 second time -- a winning score in less than 10 moves. Is the object of
 this game really to get totally frosty -- or is it to stay totally
 steamed?

 Have you actually won this game?

 Or am I just full of beans?

>examine man
 The man is fat -- but he's fat in a very jolly, almost healthy sort of
 way. Firm and pudgy all around, with very shiny, rosy skin. Cherubic
 is the sort of word that springs to mind when you look at him,
 although whatever vague conceptions you ever had about cherubs (and
 you never had that many) generally involved little babies with wings,
 and this guy is in his forties if he's a day. Maybe they're branching
 out.

 He's also completely naked. But the less said about that, the better.

 The naked fat man is carrying a gauzy robe and a pink balloon on a
 long string.

 "You'll need these," he tells you, handing you a pink balloon and a
 gown of diaphanous material. "They'll help you fit in. We've tried to
 provide an environment for you that is safe. Something that you'll
 have no trouble," he adds, indicating the valley with a sweep of his
 pudgy hand, "...accommodating."

 But if you let go of the string, your balloon will fly away!

 "Well, enjoy your stay," says the fat naked man, clapping you heartily
 on the back. "Don't misbehave, now." He raises his eyebrows and taps
 the side of his nose, and for the first time you notice that he's
 wearing thick, black-framed glasses.

 "Remember to stay frosty," he says as he floats away into the sunset.

>pop balloon
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 You can't see any such thing.

>break balloon
 You give the pink balloon a good, hard thump. You thump it again, a
 bit harder this time. Next thing you know, you're pounding on the pink
 balloon again and again for all you're worth -- you stop yourself,
 feeling a bit light-headed. Damn. You hate it when that happens.
