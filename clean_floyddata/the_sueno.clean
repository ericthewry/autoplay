 Your university experience, so far, has left a lot to be desired.
 Constantly broke, you are always looking to do something to make a
 buck; the job market is seemingly not able to support giving you a
 part-time paycheck from somewhere.  Left with little other choice,
 you've begun answering ads calling for medical research studies.
 Tonight's job: some overnight sleep study at the hospital a few blocks
 down from your dorm.

 <span class="floydstyle header">The Sueño</span>
 An Oneirological Mystery by Marshal Tenner Winter
 Release 1 / Serial number 150928 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle i">Waiting Room</span> (on the office couch)
 White, sterile, clinical: it's everything a hospital waiting room
 should be, you guess.  An office couch and some office chairs await
 any sitters and a low table offers a selection of magazines.  Near a
 secure door to the north is a receptionist's desk complete with a busy
 receptionist.  The door that leads to more of the hospital, and
 eventually an exit, is to the south.

 <span class="floydstyle em">(To talk to people, type "talk to {person}"  For conversation</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">topics, type "topics".  For additional help, type "help".  For the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">credits, type "credits".)</span>


 It's not going to be that easy.

>examine me

 Male.  19.  Student at a university in Philadelphia.  Good sense of
 humor.  Usually broke.  Otherwise, generally a nice guy who tries to
 do the right thing.  Not ugly but no Adonis.  You're comfortable with
 yourself but not with your financial situation.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a pair of jeans (being worn)
   a black shirt (being worn)
   a pair of black Skechers (being worn)

>examine jeans

 The ultimate in fashion, in your opinion.

 The receptionist's phone rings.  She answers it, "Yes, sir?"

>examine shirt

 It's relatively non-descript.  You've realized so far in your life
 that you don't really like standing out in a crowd.

 "Sure."  The receptionist says into the phone before hanging up.  She
 looks up at you.  "You can go in now." She instructs as she pushes a
 button beneath her desk.  A buzzer sounds and you hear the secure door
 to the north unlock.

>examine skechers

 They are a pair of casual, black shoes.  They go with everything,
 really.

>go north

 (first getting off the office couch)
 (first opening the secure door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 This is your typical hospital corridor.  It continues to the north and
 a bathroom door is to the west.  To the east is a lab door and the
 secure door back to the waiting room is to the south.  Otherwise, it
 is a sterile environment, as if it is compulsively cleaned throughout
 the day.

>go north

 You're pretty sure the lab is to the east.  You shouldn't wander
 around.

>go east

 (first opening the heavy door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sleep Lab</span>
 This brightly lit room reveals to you just how much money is budgeted
 for this sleep study.  A hospital bed is the focal point, of course,
 but around it is a space-age-looking machine: some sort of MRI device,
 maybe.  Arrays of equipment flank the bed sporting dozens of wires
 that hang from them.

 A door with a placard on it labeled <span class="floydstyle em">Dressing Room</span> is to the
 north while another, nondescript door is to the east.  Next to the
 nondescript door is a large window, through which you can see an
 observation room that obviously monitors this one.  The door back to
 the corridor is to the west.  The whole room seems to softly hum.

 Dr. Lynch is here, clipboard in hand.

>talk to dr lynch

 You say hello to Dr. Lynch.

 (You could ask Dr. Lynch about Dr. Lynch, the MRI device, the
 clipboard or sleep study.)

>talk to dr lynch about dr lynch

 I only understood you as far as wanting to talk to Dr. Lynch.

>talk to dr. lynch about dr. lynch

>topics

 You could ask Dr. Lynch about Dr. Lynch, the MRI device, the clipboard
 or sleep study.


 "I guess I'm supposed to be in here?" You ask.

 "Yes," the doctor shakes your hand, "I'm Dr. Richard Lynch.  Thanks
 for volunteering for our study."

 "I'm Benji Evans." You dutifully tell him, but you're sure he already
 knows that, of course.  "What do you mean volunteer?  I thought I was
 getting paid for this."

 "Oh, of course." He smiles, "<span class="floydstyle em">Volunteer</span> sounds better than,
 say, <span class="floydstyle em">test subject</span>."  He gives a small chuckle.

>talk to lynch

 You are already talking to Dr. Lynch.

 "This is a simple sleep study to measure the effects of a <span class="floydstyle i">new</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">medication</span>."  Dr. Lynch explains.  "Your blood tests are well
 within the range we need them to be in order for you to take the
 dosage we're testing tonight."

>ask lynch about clipboard

 Pointing at the clipboard, you ask, "Jesus, do you need that many
 notes for this?"

 "Well, the study's been going on for years."  He explains, "Most of
 this is just reading material for me while you sleep."  Yet you can't
 help but notice he now guards it a bit more from you.

>talk to lynch

 "Oh, of course." He smiles, "<span class="floydstyle em">Volunteer</span> sounds better than,

>ask lynch about mri machine

 "So what's that machiney-thing?" You ask, pointing to the MRI device
 surrounding the head of the bed.

 "It's like an MRI device." He tells you, "It measures just about
 anything the other equipment arrays don't.  But don't worry.  It's not
 invasive at all."

>ask lynch about rem

 There is no reply.

>ask lynch about sleep study

 "So, this must be the sleep study lab?" You inquire, not sure what
 else to say.  Dr. Lynch smiles, "Yes, of course it is."

>go north

 It would be rude to walk out of the room while talking to Dr. Lynch.
 You should probably wait until you are instructed before heading into
 the dressing room.

>ask lynch about bed

 There is no reply.

>ask lynch about dressing room

 There is no reply.

>listen

 You hear nothing unexpected.

>get in bed

 Now might not be the time to climb into bed.

>sleep

 You aren't feeling especially drowsy.


 You could ask Dr. Lynch about new medication.

>ask lynch about medication

 "What medication?" You ask, a little nervous at the thought that the
 sleep study involves an untested chemical in your system.  Then again,
 you've partied enough to not worry <span class="floydstyle em">too</span> much about it.

 "It's got a long technical name, but we've been calling it <span class="floydstyle em">The</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Sueño</span>.  Dr. Torrez coined the word.  It means <span class="floydstyle em">dream</span> in
 Spanish." He tells you.

 "Makes sense." You shrug.

 "Yes," he continues, "It was originally designed as an anesthetic for
 surgery, or maybe a powerful sleep aid for insomniacs.  But what we're
 doing in this lab is focusing on one of its <span class="floydstyle i">side effects</span>."

>topics

 You could ask Dr. Lynch about side effects.

>ask lynch about side effects

 "What side effect?" You ask; this time, a little more nervous, "Is it
 diarrhea?"

 "No," he looks at you with a furrowed brow, "no, it's not diarrhea,
 Benji.  It's about dreams.  Have you ever had a lucid dream?  Where
 you know you're dreaming and can maybe even control your
 dream?"<span class="floydstyle em">(yes/no)</span>
>yes
 dream?"<span class="floydstyle em">(yes/no)</span>

 "Yes," you answer, "I think once or twice it's happened.  I don't
 remember any details, it was awhile back."

 "Oh, excellent." He says, "Then you might be able to help us better
 than someone who hasn't."  He makes some notes on his clipboard.

 "Well, if you're ready," Dr. Lynch replaces his pen into his pocket
 protector, "Just head into the dressing room and get changed and come
 back out for a good night's sleep."

>go north

 (first opening the private door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dressing Room</span>
 It's a large bathroom that can accommodate the handicapped.  Some pegs
 line one wall while the other wall holds the toilet, sink, and mirror.
 The door back to the sleep lab is to the south.

 Hanging on one of the pegs is a hospital gown.

>pee

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>examine mirror

 It's a large, industry-standard mirror.

>wear gown

 (first taking the hospital gown)
 You put on the hospital gown.

>examine sink

 You see nothing special about the sink.

 You are carrying:
   a hospital gown (being worn)
   a pair of jeans (being worn)
   a black shirt (being worn)
   a pair of black Skechers (being worn)

>look in mirror

 You find nothing of interest.

 Dr. Lynch is here, clipboard in hand.

 "Looks like you're ready."  Dr. Lynch has the equipment arrays ready
 and closer to the bed now.  He hands you a small paper cup with a pill
 in it.  "It's chewable."  He says, "You don't need water.  Go ahead
 and take that, please."

>ask lynch about money

 There is no reply.

>ask lynch about how much I will be compensated

 There is no reply.

>examine pill

 It's a small, peach colored, chewable pill with the number 7178
 printed into it.

>take pill

 You take the chewable sueño from the small paper cup.

>eat pill

 You chew the pill and it dissolves in your mouth.

 Dr. Lynch smiles, satisfied.  "Go ahead and climb into bed, Benji." He
 says.

>get in bed

 You shouldn't carry your jeans to bed with you.

 "Go ahead and climb into bed, Benji." He says.

>take bs2x

 You can't see any such thing.

>drop all

 small paper cup: Dropped.
 pair of jeans: Dropped.
 black shirt: Dropped.
 pair of black Skechers: Dropped.

 "Go ahead and climb into bed, Benji." He says.

>get in bed

 You get onto the hospital bed.

 Dr. Lynch all but tucks you in as he attaches the many wires that
 dangle from the equipment arrays onto various parts of your body with
 little sticky electrodes.

 "We're not giving you any additional sedatives as we don't want to
 inhibit your dreams, so just relax and hopefully soon you'll be
 asleep." He tells you, "I'll be in the observation room all night."
 He motions to the east.

 He walks to the east door and shuts the lights out as he leaves,
 closing the door as well.  With the lights out, you can still see fine
 as the lights from the equipment glow dimly and some light from the
 observation room's window to the east filters in as well.

>sleep

 You close your eyes...

 <span class="floydstyle i">Someone's Bedroom</span> (on the army cot)
 <span class="floydstyle em">Well, that certainly was a strange dream</span>, you think to
 yourself as you wake up.  You're in someone's bedroom.  You've
 forgotten whose, however.  A dim green glow illuminates the place but
 you cannot tell from where exactly.  No matter where you look, the
 glow seems to be coming from somewhere near the corner of your eye.
 Movie posters plaster the wall and an aquarium with something in it is
 against one of the walls. A small television set is against another
 wall, and an exit is to the north.  The bed, a twin-sized, glorified
 army cot, sits against the east wall

 A tinny voice seems to emit from the brain, "Don't leave me here!"

>examine aquarium

 It is devoid of any water and, instead, it seems to now be some sort
 of showcase or science experiment.

 In the aquarium tank is a sentient brain.

 A tinny voice seems to emit from the brain, "Hey, pick me up!  You're
 going to need me!"

>take brain

 The tinny voice is coming from the brain, "Thanks, mate." It says.

 You'd have to get off the army cot first.

 You get off the army cot.

 (You could ask the sentient brain about the sentient brain, Dr. Lynch
 or the chewable sueño.)

>ask brain about brain

 "What on Earth <span class="floydstyle em">are</span> you?" You ask, not believing that you're
 conversing with a talking brain.

 "Oh, it doesn't matter much anymore, does it?" It replies with a
 tinny, melancholic voice.

>axk brain about lynch

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask brain about lynch

 "Do you know if Dr. Lynch is around?" You ask the brain but you're not
 quite sure why.  You just have a feeling he's either around or needs
 to be around.

 "Um..." the tinny voice seems confused a bit, "I don't remember, but
 I'm sure it will come back to me."

>ask brain about pill

 A question comes to your lips and you ask the brain, "Do you know
 anything about the sueño?  I think I'm on it right now.  Things are
 weird and I'm not remembering things too clearly.  Like how I got here
 or where I actually am."

 "The sueño?" The brain asks back, "I don't speak Spanish.  I'm sorry."

>go north

 (first opening the bedroom door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Carpeted Junction</span>
 A room of strange architecture but you can't quite put your finger on
 how.  The floor is thickly carpeted in beige and the air has a
 slightly damp feel to it, especially near the door to the east, where
 you can also hear the sound of a shower running.  The door to
 someone's bedroom is to the south and this space continues to the
 southeast.  Dim light comes in from a small window to the north.

>go east

 (first opening the bathroom door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steamy Bathroom</span>
 You are surrounded by hot, wet steam.  It clings to your skin and
 clothes, and it obscures your vision.  You think the door is to the
 west, but surely there must be more in this room.  You can hear a
 shower in here; the source of the steam.  The sonorous sound of it is
 almost hypnotizing.

>go east

 You bump into a glass shower door.

>open glass door

 You try to open the glass shower door but it seems to be locked.  A
 man's voice, familiar to you somehow, tells you from within the shower
 stall, "I'll be out in a minute!"

 It's a clean, white, porcelain throne, but it's slick with moisture
 from all the steam in the air.

>go south

 You bump into the moist toilet.

>go north

 You bump into a moist sink.  Above it is a fogged-up mirror.
 "What's that written on it?" The tinny voice of the sentient brain
 asks.

>read mirror

 It's a wide mirror, totally fogged-up from the steam in the room.
 With a finger, someone has written <span class="floydstyle em">"7178, see u tonite"</span> on
 it.

>go south

 You bump into the moist toilet.

>flush toilet

 You flush the toilet.  The pulsing sound of the running water changes
 slightly and you hear, from within the shower stall, a man shriek as
 the water suddenly scalds him.  The glass shower door flings open and
 a nude person blurs past you, leaving you in the bathroom alone.

>enter shower


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shower Stall</span>
 This shower stall is larger than you expected.  The spray of hot water
 is localized in one corner, so it is easy to stay somewhat dry in
 here, although the steam, of course, is overwhelming.  The pounding
 water sound reverberates around the tiled room and the floor is slick
 with water.  A drain sits in the center of the floor.  The glass
 shower door leading back to the rest of the bathroom is to the west.

 Wadded in the corner of the stall is a damp washcloth.

>take washcloth

 You pick up the damp washcloth from the ground.

>examine washcloth

 It's a coarse, damp washcloth.  It's green in color.

>open washcloth

 It isn't something you can open.

>look down drain

 I only understood you as far as wanting to look down.

>examine drain

 It's a small drain in the center of the floor.  The hot water exits
 through it.

>turn off water

 Funny.  You don't see a faucet or any knobs.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steamy Bathroom</span>
 You are surrounded by hot, wet steam.  It clings to your skin and
 clothes, and it obscures your vision.  You think the door is to the

 shower in here; the source of the steam.  The sonorous sound of it is
 almost hypnotizing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Carpeted Junction</span>
 A room of strange architecture but you can't quite put your finger on

 slightly damp feel to it, especially near the door to the east, where
 you can also hear the sound of a shower running.  The door to
 someone's bedroom is to the south and this space continues to the

 You're in someone's bedroom.  You've forgotten whose, however.  A dim
 green glow illuminates the place but you cannot tell from where
 exactly.  No matter where you look, the glow seems to be coming from
 somewhere near the corner of your eye.  Movie posters plaster the wall
 and an aquarium is against one of the walls. A small television set is
 against another wall, and an exit is to the north.  The bed, a
 twin-sized, glorified army cot, sits against the east wall

 On the television, a scene from your childhood plays out, like a
 silent home movie.

 Mid-Century Modern decor dominates this irregularly shaped living
 room.  The furniture and lighting are from the stylish side of the
 60's, as if the room were designed by Charles and Ray Eames or
 something.  In fact, an Eames reclining chair sits near a fireplace

 There are at least a dozen cardboard boxes here with no other

 Using the box cutter, you slice open some of the boxes, looking for

 dining room knick-knacks, but then you find something incongruous: an

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Screened Porch</span>
 The smell of fresh, pine air fills your nose and a slight, cool wind
 blows through the screens here.  This screened-porch is more
 dilapidated than you would think given the interior of the house.
 Dried, dead pine needles are strewn on the wooden floor and an old,
 plastic lawn chair is the only furniture, as if it was used by someone
 to sit and enjoy the fresh air out here.  It's almost as if you
 remember doing it, but you also know you've never been here before.
 The door back to the kitchen is open to the southeast and the flimsy,
 exterior door is to the west.  Each wall save for the east is
 wooden-framed screens, allowing you to see that this house sits deep
 in a thick, pine forest.

 Lying among the dead pine needles is a worn backpack.

>get backpack

 "Benjamin?" You hear Dr. Lynch's voice.

 "Blech." You is all you can muster.  You crack your eyes and even the
 dim, electronic lights seem too bright.  The good doctor is behind the
 window in the observation room to the east.  His voice is a tinny
 sound from a speaker somewhere.

 "Any initial thoughts, Benji?" He asks.  It takes a few moments for
 you to realize what the hell he's talking about.  The pill.  The sleep
 study.  The dream.

 "Oh," you tell him, "yes.  I was in this house.  There was a brain and
 a floppy disk."  You realize you sound like a lunatic.  But then
 again, everyone's sort of psychotic in their dreams.

 "Next to you, you'll find a questionnaire.  I know you're groggy, but
 it's part of the study.

 You grab the sheet with the attached pen and quickly scribble through
 questions about your mood and other imagery from your dream.  Then,
 you slam it down again and roll over.

 "Goodnight, Benji." Dr. Lynch says.

 "Shut up." You reply.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the screened porch)</span>
 Pine trees surround you; their dead needles litter the forest floor.
 There is no yard here as the house is nestled cozily within the trunks
 of these woods.  The house's gutters are jammed with the pine needles
 and its flat roof is covered by them.  The door to the house's
 screened-in porch is to the east.  The sky above, what little you can
 see through the canopy of foliage, is gray.  Foot trails seem to lead
 north and south, although it's difficult to really tell.

>get needles

 You don't need anything like that.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (deep in the woods)</span>
 You wander into the forest, aimlessly.  Deep in the woods, you find
 yourself surrounded by the pine trees, leaving visibility into the
 woods at a minimum.  The dead pine needles crunch below your feet and
 the sky is gray above you, through the foliage and branches.  You
 think the house from where you emerged is to the south.  You can hear
 running water to the northeast.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the small waterfall)</span>
 You wander into the forest, aimlessly.  You soon find yourself near a
 babbling stream with a small waterfall running from the northwest.
 The waterfall, only ten feet tall or so, falls from a rocky crag and
 creates a small pond before continuing its trek to the southeast.  The
 pine trees are no less dense here and the sky above is gray.  The only
 foot trail you think you see is to the southwest.  Across the small
 pond and stream, you see a more clearly defined path leading
 northeast.  The sound of the waterfall is rushing in your ears.

>examine pond

 There is a continuous ripple on this pond as the waterfall to the
 northwest empties into it.  Large goldfish swim about within it.

>examine goldfish

 Sparkling goldfish swim about in the small pond.

>take goldish

 You can't see any such thing.

>climb tree

 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>swim

>go northeast

 You wade through the water, soaking yourself from the waist down,
 before exiting the stream again and heading northeast.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the overlook cliff)</span>
 Finally, a break from the monotony of endless pine trees.  You stand
 on the edge of a vertical cliff looking down over more forest and
 eventually, in the near distance, a small town.  A rocky path leads
 down to the southeast, winding down the cliff and its various
 outcroppings.  Another path leads back into the woods to the
 southwest.  The cliff cuts the land here from the northwest to the
 southeast.  The sky, unobstructed by foliage here, is still a bleak
 gray.

>go northwest

 You wander into the forest, aimlessly.  After an immeasurable amount
 of time, you are surprised to find yourself back near the edge of the
 cliff.

>se

 You dread heading to the southeast, down the rocky path.  Something
 stops you.  Something tells you that dark entities guard it.  In your
 mind, you see large, black rabbits.  Strange, yes, but terrifying for
 some reason.  They are in your mind only for now, but something also
 tells you that you will lose your lucidity and wake up screaming
 should you head that direction.

 You wander into the forest, aimlessly.  A little further south from
 the house's screened porch, you find a strange tree.  Halfway buried
 in its base is an ancient doghouse, the tree having grown through most
 of it.  Most of its dark opening is still gaping enough to peer into.
 Otherwise, this part of the forest is identical to the rest; large
 pine trees with needles littering the ground.

>examine doghouse

 (the ancient doghouse)
 It really is your typical doghouse, as far as design goes.  But it's
 decrepitly old and a pine tree has grown through most of it, fusing
 the two together forever.  The opening of the dog house is still
 gaping enough to peer into.

>look in doghouse

 You approach the dark opening of the doghouse and reach inside.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steamy Bathroom</span>
 You are surrounded by hot, wet steam.  It clings to your skin and
 clothes, and it obscures your vision.  You think the door is to the

 shower in here; the source of the steam.  The sonorous sound of it is
 almost hypnotizing.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Carpeted Junction</span>
 A room of strange architecture but you can't quite put your finger on
 how.  The floor is thickly carpeted in beige and the air has a
 slightly damp feel to it, especially near the door to the east, where
 you can also hear the sound of a shower running.  The door to
 someone's bedroom is to the south and this space continues to the
 southeast.  Dim light comes in from a small window to the north.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cozy Study</span>
 Mid-Century Modern decor dominates this irregularly shaped living
 room.  The furniture and lighting are from the stylish side of the
 60's, as if the room were designed by Charles and Ray Eames or
 something.  In fact, an Eames reclining chair sits near a fireplace
 with a dwindling fire.  A large bookshelf covers the west wall and a
 bay window sits in the east wall.  Open doorways lead northwest and
 south; the wall-to-wall carpeting runs non-stop.

>examine bookshelf

 The bookshelf covers the entire west wall.  You glance among the books
 and a title that catches your eye is <span class="floydstyle em">The Mailbox Baseball</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">League</span> by Spiky Zytez.

>take book

 You decide not to bother taking any of the books right now.

>fiddle with book

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>search carpet

 You find nothing of interest.

>search chair

 There is nothing on the Eames reclining chair.

>search fireplace

 Snug in the wall, this fireplace holds a dwindling fire of dying red
 embers.  On the back wall of the fireplace there seems to be a small,
 metal door.  The face of the door is filthy with soot.

>search embers

 You find nothing of interest.

>clean door

 You'd need something more than that to wipe it clean.

>clean door with washcloth

 You wipe the front of the small metal door with the damp washcloth.
 Once the soot is removed, you see four dials on the front of it.

>examine dials

 Which do you mean, the first dial, the second dial, the third dial or
 the fourth dial?

>first fial

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the first dial.

>examine first dial

 It can be set from 0-9.

 You set the first dial to "7".

 You set the fourth dial to "8".

 You hear a click from the safe and the small metal door pops open.

>examine safe

 The safe space behind the small metal door is about a twelve-inch
 square space for valuables, you guess.

 In the safe space is a crumpled napkin.

>take napkin

 You take the crumpled napkin from the safe space.

>read napkin

 It's a cocktail napkin with some hastily scrawled words on it:
 <span class="floydstyle em">"remember- you are DREAMing"</span>.

 What do you want to dream?

 In a way, you are already dreaming of yourself.  You'll have better
 luck dreaming of things you encounter along the way.

>dream doghouse

 (the dark opening)
 You close your eyes and imagine the ancient doghouse near the strange
 tree.  When you open them again, you are somewhere else.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the doghouse)</span>
 A little further south from the house's screened porch, you find a
 strange tree.  Halfway buried in its base is an ancient doghouse, the
 tree having grown through most of it.  Most of its dark opening is
 still gaping enough to peer into.  Otherwise, this part of the forest
 is identical to the rest; large pine trees with needles littering the
 ground.

 You close your eyes and think of the moist toilet in the steamy

 You bump into the moist sink.  Above it is a fogged-up mirror.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shower Stall</span>
 This shower stall is larger than you expected.  The spray of hot water
 is localized in one corner, so it is easy to stay somewhat dry in
 here, although the steam, of course, is overwhelming.  The pounding
 water sound reverberates around the tiled room and the floor is slick
 with water.  A drain sits in the center of the floor.  The glass
 shower door leading back to the rest of the bathroom is to the west.

>dream away water

>dream off

 That doesn't seem to work.

 Which do you mean, the bedroom shadows or the bedroom door?


 You close your eyes and think of the shadows in the bedroom.  When you
 open them again, you find yourself somewhere else.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Someone's Bedroom</span>
 You're in someone's bedroom.  You've forgotten whose, however.  A dim
 green glow illuminates the place but you cannot tell from where
 exactly.  No matter where you look, the glow seems to be coming from
 somewhere near the corner of your eye.  Movie posters plaster the wall
 and an aquarium is against one of the walls. A small television set is
 against another wall, and an exit is to the north.  The bed, a
 twin-sized, glorified army cot, sits against the east wall

 On the television, security camera footage shows you, of all people,
 in a post office sending out a care package.  Funny, you don't
 remember ever living that scene in real life.


 The shadows in this room seem to change and mingle with the green
 glow.

 On the television, a scene from your childhood plays out, like a
 silent home movie.


 That doesn't seem to work.


 It has a thin, bare mattress on it.  The mattress doesn't look that
 new.  In fact, it's pretty rank in appearance.  How you ended up
 crashing on it last night is anyone's guess.

 be nestled among many pine trees.  The ground outside is covered in
 dead pine needles.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 This would be the dining room except that everything is packed in
 moving boxes.  Someone is either moving in or moving out.  It's all
 very familiar to you, somehow.  A wide window lets in diffuse light
 from the east wall and doorways lead north and west.


 You find nothing of interest.


 You don't want to carry around cumbersome boxes right now.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 This kitchen is bare of appliances or any decorations at all; as if
 the moving process has moved through here already.  Cupboards are
 above the counter and drawers are below it.  The dining room is to the
 east and a door to a screened-in porch is open to the northwest.


 They are empty.


 You see nothing special about the drawers.


 There's nothing else in the drawers.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Screened Porch</span>
 This screened-porch is more dilapidated than you would think given the
 interior of the house.  Dried, dead pine needles are strewn on the
 wooden floor and an old, plastic lawn chair is the only furniture, as
 if it was used by someone to sit and enjoy the fresh air out here.
 It's almost as if you remember doing it, but you also know you've
 never been here before.  The door back to the kitchen is open to the
 southeast and the flimsy, exterior door is to the west.  Each wall
 save for the east is wooden-framed screens, allowing you to see that
 this house sits deep in a thick, pine forest.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the screened porch)</span>
 Pine trees surround you; their dead needles litter the forest floor.
 There is no yard here as the house is nestled cozily within the trunks
 of these woods.  The house's gutters are jammed with the pine needles
 and its flat roof is covered by them.  The door to the house's
 screened-in porch is to the east.  The sky above, what little you can
 see through the canopy of foliage, is gray.  Foot trails seem to lead
 north and south, although it's difficult to really tell.


 You are already dreaming that you are standing before the strange
 house in the woods.


 They are clogged with pine needles.


 They are just brown, dead pine needles.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the doghouse)</span>
 A little further south from the house's screened porch, you find a
 strange tree.  Halfway buried in its base is an ancient doghouse, the
 tree having grown through most of it.  Most of its dark opening is
 still gaping enough to peer into.  Otherwise, this part of the forest
 is identical to the rest; large pine trees with needles littering the
 ground.


 Which do you mean, the pine trees or the strange tree?


 This tree grew through an old doghouse and up towards the sky.  Who
 knows how long it took to grow?


 Which do you mean, the pine trees or the strange tree?


 I don't think much is to be achieved by that.


 You wander into the forest, aimlessly.  After an immeasurable amount

 from the ancient doghouse.

 Deep in the woods, you find yourself surrounded by the pine trees,
 leaving visibility into the woods at a minimum.  The dead pine needles
 crunch below your feet and the sky is gray above you, through the
 foliage and branches.  You think the house from where you emerged is
 to the south.  You can hear running water to the northeast.



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the small waterfall)</span>
 You  find yourself near a babbling stream with a small waterfall
 running from the northwest.  The waterfall, only ten feet tall or so,
 falls from a rocky crag and creates a small pond before continuing its
 trek to the southeast.  The pine trees are no less dense here and the
 sky above is gray.  The only foot trail you think you see is to the
 southwest.  Across the small pond and stream, you see a more clearly
 defined path leading northeast.  The sound of the waterfall is rushing
 in your ears.


 Cascading from a rocky crag about ten feet in height, this small
 waterfall empties into a rippling pond.  From the pond, the stream
 continues to the southeast.


 There is a continuous ripple on this pond as the waterfall to the
 northwest empties into it.  Large goldfish swim about within it.


 Sparkling goldfish swim about in the small pond.


 There's no need to do that.


 The rocky crag is too slippery and jagged to climb.


 You are already dreaming of the rocky crag.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (near the overlook cliff)</span>
 You stand on the edge of a vertical cliff looking down over more
 forest and eventually, in the near distance, a small town.  A rocky
 path leads down to the southeast, winding down the cliff and its
 various outcroppings.  Another path leads back into the woods to the
 southwest.  The cliff cuts the land here from the northwest to the
 southeast.  The sky, unobstructed by foliage here, is still a bleak
 gray.


 You dread heading to the southeast, down the rocky path.  Something
 stops you.  Something tells you that dark entities guard it.  In your
 mind, you see large, black rabbits.  Strange, yes, but terrifying for
 some reason.  They are in your mind only for now, but something also
 tells you that you will lose your lucidity and wake up screaming
 should you head that direction.

 This rocky path is treacherous as it winds between boulders and slopes
 steeply.  From here, you can head back up to the northwest or down to
 the southeast.  The cliff that this path winds beside is steep and
 made of white stone.  Below, you can see some more pine forest before
 a small town a bit further beyond that.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (the lower woods)</span>
 More pine trees, of course, but these sit in the shadow of the cliff
 above you.  A rocky path winds up beside the cliff, through
 outcroppings and boulders, to the northwest.  The trees still obscure
 a gray sky and the ground is still littered with dead pine needles.
 You think you can make out a faint path to the east, leading to the
 town you saw when you were up on the cliff, before you descended.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Trees (on the faint path)</span>
 You are on a faint path within the pine woods.  The path runs east to
 west but is so overgrown, you must be the only person to have tread it
 in a long while.  The pine trees still surround you and the sky's gray
 remains motionless.  To the east, the trees thin out and you can see
 the first buildings of the small town ahead.

 "Benjamin?" Once again, you hear Dr. Lynch's voice waking you.

 "Ugh."  You reply.  Opening your eyes, you see the room, now dimmer,
 and the observation window beyond where a sleepy-looking Dr. Lynch
 watches you.  He taps a button and speaks into a mic, "What were you
 just dreaming, Benj?" He asks.

 "There was a large dog.  He was guarding me and he chased off some
 spirits so I could climb down this rocky path.  There was a town."
 You think for a moment, "Wait a minute, I think I returned to my same
 dream.  That's really weird.  I didn't think that could actually
 happen."

 "On the Sueño, it does."  He says casually, "We're finding it has a
 number of side effects.  Thus, this sleep study."

 But you are rolling back over and getting as comfortable as you can,
 already falling back to sleep.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woodside Lane</span>
 As you emerge from the woods, you step upon the asphalt of a paved
 road.  A sign nearby signifies that this is Woodside Lane, and it runs
 north and south.  This is the edge of this small town and a wilderness
 of pine trees sits to the west.  A small, brick building is to the
 east.  For some reason, you know it's a library.  The sky remains a
 gray slate and this town appears to be devoid of life.

 It seems to be locked.  The tinny voice of the sentient brain speaks

 you to lose some of your lucidity.

 strong, metal affair.  The emptiness of this town makes you feel as if
 you are in an episode of <span class="floydstyle em">The Twilight Zone</span>.

 For some reason, you know it's a library.  The sky remains a gray
 slate.

>go east

 (first opening the library door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library Lobby</span>
 This place must've been designed in the 70s or early 80s, you
 consider.  The design is very "Brady Bunch".  Posters and notices line
 the walls of this lobby and a circular reception desk sits in the
 center of the room.  Wide doorways lead northeast, east, southeast,
 and south to other parts of the library, and a door leads north to a
 computer lab, as per the sign on it.  A potted fern sits in the corner
 and the door to the outside is to the west.

>go north

 (first opening the lab door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Computer Lab</span>
 This lab is modern if this dream were taking place in the 80's.
 There's not much here, however, as if either the library could only
 afford the one old computer you can see here, or maybe the rest of the
 computers were pilfered by people.  After all, this place is as devoid
 of life as the town.  The old computer sits on an old desk and a
 matching, old chair sits before it.  Shapes on the paint on the walls
 indicate posters once hung here, but they, too, are now gone.  The
 only exit is a door to the south.

>put disk in comoputer

 Which do you mean, the floppy disk or the disk drive?

>put floppy disk in disk drive

 You pop the floppy disk into the disk drive.  The whole computer
 whirrs to life.

 On the screen, a simple sentence prompts you to <span class="floydstyle em">"Look up Wallace</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Josephs in the Reference section.  Then set your biological clock to</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">wake up."</span>

 You take the floppy disk back out of the disk drive, just in case.

 Wallace Josephs is here, looking like a dangerous and demented version
 of Dr. Lynch.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Juvenile Section</span>
 This area of the library is brightly colored and it attempts to appeal
 to both young children and young adults with its selection of posters
 and books.  The bookshelves here are only half the normal size and are
 full of books from Dr.Seuss to whatever the latest vampire epic for
 teens is.  From here, you can see the lobby to the north and the main
 collection to the east.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the north.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Collection</span>
 From where you stand, the aisles of books stretch before you to the
 east and south.  To the north, you can see the Periodicals section and
 to the west you can see the Juvenile section.

>go south

 You wander down the aisle of books for awhile, but soon are surprised
 to find yourself back at the start of the main collection.

>go east

 You wander down the aisle of books for awhile, but soon are surprised

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Periodicals</span>
 You are roughly in the middle of the library and its emptiness is
 creepy as all the lights are on.  It's as if the place was busy as
 normal but everyone just disappeared for you see open books and
 newspapers around and just a feeling as if people were just here.
 It's the <span class="floydstyle em">'Mary Celeste'</span> of libraries.

 In this section, mostly current magazines are stored in open display
 cases.  Comfortable seats are spread around for reading.  From here,
 you can see the reference section to the north, the main collection to
 the south, and you can return to the lobby to the west.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the south.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reference</span>
 This portion of the library is for all the reference material.  Wide
 bookshelves are stuffed with thick encyclopedias and other informative
 books.  However, unlike any small-town library you've seen, the
 reference books here are guarded behind a thin laser beam running
 across each shelf, making it impossible to pull a book out without
 breaking the beam.  You can see a control box from where the beams
 emerge.  From here, you can head south to the Periodicals sections or
 southwest to the lobby.

>examine control box

 It's a strange, plain, gray box with holes that have lasers protruding
 forth.  The box is angled so that the lasers stream across the
 reference books in the wide bookshelf.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the south.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a baseball bat
   an old key
   some brown paper
   a care package (open but empty)
   a crumpled napkin
   a worn backpack (open)
     a floppy disk
     a box cutter
     a damp washcloth
     a sentient brain
   a pair of black Skechers (being worn)

>dream drain

 You close your eyes and find yourself in a...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shower Stall</span>
 This shower stall is larger than you expected.  The spray of hot water
 is localized in one corner, so it is easy to stay somewhat dry in
 here, although the steam, of course, is overwhelming.  The pounding
 water sound reverberates around the tiled room and the floor is slick
 with water.  A drain sits in the center of the floor.  The glass
 shower door leading back to the rest of the bathroom is to the west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Steamy Bathroom</span>
 You are surrounded by hot, wet steam.  It clings to your skin and
 clothes, and it obscures your vision.  You think the door is to the
 west, but surely there must be more in this room.  You can hear a
 shower in here; the source of the steam.  The sonorous sound of it is
 almost hypnotizing.

>examine mirror

 It's a wide mirror, totally fogged-up from the steam in the room.
 With a finger, someone has written <span class="floydstyle em">"7178, see u tonite"</span> on
 it.

>take mirror

 That's hardly portable.

>find wallace

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>where is wallace

>break mirror

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>dream altar

 You close your eyes and think of the church altar.  When you open them
 again, you find yourself somewhere else.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Saint Josephs'</span>
 This is a small but dilapidated church.  An aisle between rows of pews
 leads to an altar and behind the altar you can see a squat door on the
 east wall.  The ceiling sags in this building and you can tell that
 it's been abandoned for many years.  Stained glass windows line the
 walls; each smashed in many places, leaving only pieces of saints
 intact.  The door to the west leads back outside and above it is a
 dirty sign of some sort.

>get glass

 They're hardly portable.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Church & Main</span>
 Main Street stretches to the west and Church street to the south.
 They converge here to an intersection and become one road heading
 northeast, out of town.  Trees border the north and an old church sits
 to the east, on the edge of town.  Its door is not far from the road.

>dream dentist's office

 I only understood you as far as wanting to dream the dentist's chair.

>dream dentist's chair

 You close your eyes and think of the dentist's chair.  When you open
 them again, you find yourself somewhere else.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dentist's Office</span>
 There is no waiting room in this quaint dentist's office.  Instead,
 there's a sofa for any waiters but they would be in full witness of
 the dentist's chair in the middle of the room.  It is a modern,
 reclining, comfortable-looking chair, but you know not to be fooled.
 To you, it's a modern torture device.  A service table sits next to
 the dentist's chair.  A small placard is on the table, stating
 <span class="floydstyle em">"Please Have A Seat"</span>.  The only exit is a door to the outside
 world to the northwest.

>sit in chair

 You get onto the dentist's chair.

 Suddenly, you are paralyzed; your arms and legs frozen in place as you
 lay on the chair.  You hear a sound from the service table next to
 you.  You see a dental probe that you failed to notice before fly into
 the air in front of you.  Your mouth opens, yet you cannot scream.
 The tool, with its sharp hook, descends to do its torture on you.

>ask brain about probe

 You are paralyzed on the dentist's chair.  The dental probe descends
 closer toward your eye.

 You concentrate on the dental probe, dreaming it away.  It advances
 closer, aiming for your eyeball.  Finally, your lucidity wins and the
 dental probe, with an audible <span class="floydstyle em">POP</span>, winks out of this dream.

 Once the terror in you subsides, you see a dentist's mouth mirror on
 the service table.  Funny, you didn't see it before.

>get mirror

 (putting the crumpled napkin into the worn backpack to make room)
 You take the mouth mirror from the service table.

>examine mirror

 It is a small, hand-held mirror used to examine the interior of
 patients' mouths.

>dream computer

 Try as you might, you can't seem to bring any image of Fran Anderson
 or her belongings to your mind right now.  Weird.

 across each shelf, making it impossible to pull a book out without

 You can't see any such thing.

 It's a strange, plain, gray box with holes that have lasers protruding

 reference books in the wide bookshelf.

>put mirror in box

 That can't contain things.

>reflect lasers with mirror

 That's not a verb I recognize.

>block beam with mirror

 Cleverly, you angle the mouth mirror to one of the lasers.  After a
 moment to hold your breath, you break the beam with the mouth mirror.
 The beam reflects off the mirror and you angle it to the control box,
 back in on itself.  As this happens, the box sparks and the laser
 beams guarding the reference books disappear.

>look up wallace in reference books

 You can't see any such thing.

>look up wallace

 I only understood you as far as wanting to look up.

>look up wallace josephs in books

 You look in the appropriate encylcopedia and find the entry for

 your eyes alone.

   a baseball bat
   an old key

 There is no reply.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the southwest.

>examine wallace

 He looks like Dr. Richard Lynch, but maybe his evil brother, perhaps?
 He has the large frame and ginger beard.  But, instead of a nice,
 crisp labcoat, Wallace wears a bloodstained butcher's apron.  In one
 hand, he carries a cleaver and a syringe dangles from his other hand.
 He stares at you with dead eyes.

>take cleaver

 That seems to belong to Wallace Josephs.

>take syringe

 That seems to belong to Wallace Josephs.

 Wallace Josephs springs to life suddenly.  He swings his cleaver at
 your head but you are lucid enough to scramble away from his attack.

>dream lucid

 That doesn't seem to work.

>dream wallace

 You are already dreaming of Wallace Josephs.

>dream cleaver

 You are already dreaming of that cleaver in Wallace's hand.  You can't
 seem to do anything with it while he carries it, unfortunately.

>dream apron

 Which do you mean, the butcher's apron or the apron pocket?

>dream butcher's apron

 Something tells you that Wallace is currently wearing the bloody
 butcher's apron.

>dream apron pocket

>examine pocket

 It is the only pocket sewn into the butcher's apron.

 In the apron pocket is a biological clock.

>take clock

 That seems to belong to Wallace Josephs.

>attack wallace

 He looks a bit too intimidating to attack him with your bare hands.

>attack wallace with bat

 You swing the bat but somehow miss.  The monster roars a laugh at your

>attack wallace with brain

 The sentient brain would not be a very effective weapon.

>attack wallace with mirror

 The mouth mirror would not be a very effective weapon.

>attack wallace with box cutter

 You need to be carrying the box cutter to attack with it.

>get box cutter

 (putting the care package into the worn backpack to make room)
 You take the box cutter from the worn backpack.

>attack wallace with box cutter

 You figure the box cutter would make good enough knife and you lash
 out at Wallace.

 Amazingly, you succeed in slicing the monster across the chest.  The
 apron, now cut and ruined, falls to the ground.
 As you scramble back to your feet, the monster of a man runs off,
 injured.  You are safe, for now.

>get clock

 (putting the brown paper into the worn backpack to make room)
 You take the biological clock from the apron pocket.

>examine clock

 It is a strange chunk of ... well, flesh, really.  It's pretty
 disgusting, especially because a rough circle of the flesh has been
 sickeningly ripped off, leaving a patch of bloody muscle.  What's also
 weird is that there is hair in this patch.  Upon closer inspection,
 the hair is growing in a precise way as to make a sort-of clock face
 on the muscle.  Two hairs grow from the center and point outward,
 making the hour and minute "hands", and small nubs of hair surround
 the circle, making a braille-like series of numbers to mark the time.
 <span class="floydstyle em">(To check the time, type "check time" or just "time".)</span>

 Taking a moment to study the horrid biological clock, you determine
 that it is twenty-five to six.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woodside Lane</span>
 A sign nearby signifies that this is Woodside Lane, and it runs north

 pine trees sits to the west.  A small, brick building is to the east.
 For some reason, you know it's a library.  The sky remains a gray
 slate.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woodside & Cliff</span>
 The road bends here.  Woodside Lane runs north and Cliff Street runs
 east.  To the west is the wilderness of pine trees and to the south is
 a squat, gray building; a bank, your mind tells you.  Its door is a
 strong, metal affair.  The emptiness of this town makes you feel as if
 you are in an episode of <span class="floydstyle em">The Twilight Zone</span>.

>attack door with bat

 There's no way to break the strong door with the baseball bat.

>dream bank

 You are already dreaming that you are standing before the squat gray
 building.  You seem to realize it's a bank.

>dream money

>dream cash register

 That doesn't seem to work.

>ask brain about clock

 It's a sturdy building made of large, white stone bricks.  There are
 no windows.  For a small-town local bank, it sure appears solidly
 forboding.  Its door is a strong, metal affair.

>examine door

 This is the door to the bank.  It is made especially strong, just in
 case.

 Wallace Josephs springs to life suddenly.  He swings his cleaver at
 your head but you are lucid enough to scramble away from his attack.

 church.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Church & Main</span>
 Main Street stretches to the west and Church street to the south.
 They converge here to an intersection and become one road heading
 northeast, out of town.  Trees border the north and an old church sits
 to the east, on the edge of town.  Its door is not far from the road.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Street</span>
 This east-west road must be Main Street.  There's not much here, of
 course, this being just a portion of a small town.  But, there is a
 hardware store to the north.  To the south is the library but the
 entrance is on another side of it.  Otherwise, you could head back to
 Woodside Lane to the west or Church Lane to the east.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hardware Store</span>
 Dust covers everything in this abandoned hardware store.  Empty
 shelves probably once held all sorts of things for the handyman in
 everyone, but now, only the dust remains.  There is a wooden counter,
 as well, where perhaps a cash register once sat.  The exit is a store
 door to the south.

>look behind counter

 Looking behind the counter, you find the last remaining tool that this
 store had to offer: a sturdy hammer which you grab.

>examine hammer

 It's a well-built, sturdy hammer that feels good in your hand.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the south.

>dream bedpan

 You close your eyes and think of the display items you saw inside the
 pharmacy.  When you open them, you find yourself somewhere else.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Pharmacy</span>
 This old-timey pharmacy is as eerily quiet as the town it inhabits.
 Different medicinal sundries and healthcare supplies line the wire
 shelves and a pharmacist's counter is in the back.  The exit is a door
 to the south.  Also, the window's display items are accessible here.

>look behind counter

 Looking behind the counter, you find a prescription pad and a dull
 pencil; both of which you take out of curiosity.

>examine pad

 It's a small but thick pad of prescription slips.  A doctor would
 write the medicine and patient's name on these and the patient brings
 them to the pharmacy to get filled.

>examine pencil

 It's actually half a pencil as there is no eraser.

>write prescription

 I didn't understand that sentence.

>write on pad

 What do you want to write on the prescription pad with?

>write on pad with pencil

 Sure, you could write on this prescription pad with the dull pencil.
 But you have nothing that really <span class="floydstyle em">needs</span> to be written.
 However, maybe there's something else you can do with the two objects
 to glean something.


 I only understood you as far as wanting to rub the dull pencil.


 Using the old pencil-rub technique, you use the pencil to shade the
 top page of the pad and read the indentations left from the previous,
 missing entry.  After some squinting and touching-up, you finally are
 able to read <span class="floydstyle em">"Richard Lynch is someone else.  You're no longer in</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">your own head.  Despair and be forgotten."</span>.

 Something tells you that time has passed in this town slightly.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woodside & Main</span>
 Woodside Lane, running south, bends and becomes Main Street, running
 east, on this corner.  To the west, the wilderness of pine trees marks
 the border of this small town.  To the north, a small shop with the
 "℞" symbol on a neon sign on the door.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woodside Lane</span>
 A sign nearby signifies that this is Woodside Lane, and it runs north
 and south.  This is the edge of this small town and a wilderness of
 pine trees sits to the west.  A small, brick building is to the east.
 For some reason, you know it's a library.  The sky remains a gray
 slate.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Woodside & Cliff</span>
 The road bends here.  Woodside Lane runs north and Cliff Street runs

 you are in an episode of <span class="floydstyle em">The Twilight Zone</span>.

>go south

 (first opening the strong door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bank Anteroom</span>
 This is a small anteroom mainly for ATM use when the bank proper is
 closed.  A strong door leads outside to the north and an interior door
 leads to the bank lobby to the south.  The ATM sits in the west wall
 and a card-reading device is next to the interior door.

 What's impossible to miss, however, is the dead body on the floor of
 this anteroom.  Most likely a man, its face is gone: destroyed
 completely by a shotgun blast or some other high-caliber weapon,
 leaving him completely unidentifiable.  The blood from the wound is
 sprayed all over the east wall and floor, but it is brown and dry.

>wake up

 It's not going to be that easy.

>examine body

 Dressed like someone who most likely lived in a trailer park, this
 person was probably male, but it's difficult to tell as its face is
 gone: destroyed completely by a shotgun blast or some other
 high-caliber weapon, leaving him completely unidentifiable.  The blood
 from the wound, now brown and dry, is sprayed all over the east wall
 and floor.

>set clock to wake up

 It is not time to set the biological clock to wake up yet.

>examine atm

 It's a bulky device fitted into the west wall.  Bank customers insert
 their credit cards into it to recieve cash out of it.  Other banking
 services can be done, as well.  You've always thought of them as one
 of society's better ideas.  To start, you'd have to insert a credit
 card then type a PIN into it.

 Wallace Josephs arrives from the north.

>search wallace

 You find nothing of interest.

>hit wallace with hammer

 You hold the hammer in your fist and strike at Wallace.

 Amazingly, you whack the monster man in the forehead, stunning him;
 his eyes rolling in the back of his head.
 Having been injured too much in this dream, the hulking man disappears
 ... for now.

>search atm

 You find nothing of interest.

>search corpse

 An idea hits you and, being careful not to touch more of the body than
 is necessary, you fish the customer's credit card from his pocket.

>examine credit card

 It's plastic, of course, and silver-gray in color.  The numbers on it
 change every time you glance at it, making you dizzy when you do, but
 the name on the card is constant: <span class="floydstyle em">Dr Richard Lynch</span>.

>examine card-reader

 Next to the south door is a card-reading device.  It's a security
 feature forcing customers to insert their credit card into it in order
 to unlock the interior door.

>put card into card-reader

 You slide the credit card into the device and you hear the interior
 door unlock loudly.  The card easily comes back out.

>go south

 (first opening the interior door)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bank Lobby</span>
 This place is full of ghosts. You can see them in line near the
 teller's window as well as near the kiosk where they repeatedly run
 through their banking motions for eternity. The spirits are
 translucent figures of differing shapes and sizes, their feet lost
 illusions as they float about this bank lobby, forever doing their
 business; seemingly oblivious to you. The door to the outside world is
 to the north and you can see a vault door, a large, circular metal
 monstrosity, to the west. It is guarded by a ghostly security guard,
 of course.

>go west

 (first opening the vault door)
 It seems to be locked.

>examine guard

 He stands as a translucent sentinal to the side of the vault door.
 He's the only one whose eyes glance at you every once and awhile.
 Perhaps he notices you, or thinks he does on whatever level of
 existence he's actually on.

 You say hello to the ghostly guard.

 You have nothing specific in mind to discuss with ghostly guard right

 closed.  A strong door leads outside to the north and an interior door
 leads to the bank lobby to the south.  The ATM sits in the west wall
 and a card-reading device is next to the interior door.

 What's impossible to miss, however, is the dead body on the floor of
 this anteroom.  Most likely a man, its face is gone: destroyed
 completely by a shotgun blast or some other high-caliber weapon,
 leaving him completely unidentifiable.  The blood from the wound is
 sprayed all over the east wall and floor, but it is brown and dry.

>put card into atm

 You insert the credit card and the ATM's lights spring to life.  All
 you need to do next is type a PIN into it.

>type 7178

 What do you want to type that in?

>type 7178 into atm

 The ATM display tells you that the PIN you entered is accurate.  A
 twenty-dollar bill emerges and you grab it.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a twenty-dollar bill
   a credit card
   a dull pencil
   a prescription pad
   a sturdy hammer
   a biological clock
   a box cutter
   a mouth mirror
   a baseball bat
   an old key
   a worn backpack (open)
     some brown paper
     a care package (open but empty)
     a crumpled napkin
     a floppy disk
     a damp washcloth
     a sentient brain
   a pair of black Skechers (being worn)
   a pair of jeans (being worn)
   a black shirt (being worn)
   a hospital gown (being worn)

>examine bill

 You see nothing special about the twenty-dollar bill.

>examine credit card

 It's plastic, of course, and silver-gray in color.  The numbers on it
 change every time you glance at it, making you dizzy when you do, but
 the name on the card is constant: <span class="floydstyle em">Dr Richard Lynch</span>.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bank Lobby</span>
 This place is full of ghosts. You can see them in line near the
 teller's window as well as near the kiosk where they repeatedly run
 through their banking motions for eternity. The spirits are
 translucent figures of differing shapes and sizes, their feet lost
 illusions as they float about this bank lobby, forever doing their
 business; seemingly oblivious to you. The door to the outside world is
 to the north and you can see a vault door, a large, circular metal
 monstrosity, to the west. It is guarded by a ghostly security guard,
 of course.

>wait in line

 I only understood you as far as wanting to wait.

>wait

 Time passes.

>go west

 (first opening the vault door)
 It seems to be locked.

>unlock door with credit card

 Which do you mean, the interior door or the vault door?

>give bill to guard

 Somehow, the level of existence he is on, and the one you are on, meet
 as the bill is passed between the two of you clandestinely.  It
 disappears in his pocket and he nods toward the vault door.  The
 smooth sound of metallic gears can be heard for a moment and then the
 door slowly swings open, allowing passage to the west.

>go west


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bank Vault</span>
 Not a large room, by any means.  This vault's walls are covered with
 safety deposit boxes of various sizes in no order at all.  Different
 sized boxes mixed together and all of them are open and empty, having
 been looted in whatever robbery happened here.  The only exit is the
 vault door to the east.

 The only other thing in here: a second body, another gunshot victim.
 This time, a child of maybe ten years old.  A clean bullet wound in
 the forehead.  A peaceful look on his somewhat familiar face.

 You can see a monocle here.

>get monocle

 (putting the old key into the worn backpack to make room)
 You're carrying too many things already.

>get monocle

>drop mirror

 Dropped.

>get monocle

 (putting the box cutter into the worn backpack to make room)
 You're carrying too many things already.

>drop pencil

 Dropped.

>drop pad

 Dropped.

>get monocle

 You pick up the monocle from the ground.

>wear monocle

 You put on the monocle.

>examine monocle

 It's an old-timey monocle, much like Mr. Peanut wears.  It's attached
 to a lanyard so it's easy to carry around and not misplace.  You are
 currently wearing it.

>examine boxes

 What reminds you most that you are in a dream is how they are uneven
 in every way possible.  The more you stare at them, the more the
 geometry of the ones in your peripheral vision become distorted.

>examine body

 He is a child of maybe ten years old with a clean bullet wound in his
 forehead.  He has a peaceful look on his somewhat familiar face.

>dream fern

 You close your eyes and think of the potted fern.  When you open them
 again, you find yourself somewhere else.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Library Lobby</span>
 This place must've been designed in the 70s or early 80s, you
 consider.  The design is very "Brady Bunch".  Posters and notices line
 the walls of this lobby and a circular reception desk sits in the
 center of the room.  Wide doorways lead northeast, east, southeast,
 and south to other parts of the library, and a door leads north to a
 computer lab, as per the sign on it.  A potted fern sits in the corner
 and the door to the outside is to the west.

>go northeast


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Reference</span>
 This portion of the library is for all the reference material.  Wide
 bookshelves are stuffed with thick encyclopedias and other informative
 books.  From here, you can head south to the Periodicals sections or
 southwest to the lobby.

 You can see a butcher's apron here.

>go north

 You can't go that way.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Periodicals</span>
 You are roughly in the middle of the library and its emptiness is
 creepy as all the lights are on.  It's as if the place was busy as
 normal but everyone just disappeared for you see open books and
 newspapers around and just a feeling as if people were just here.
 It's the <span class="floydstyle em">'Mary Celeste'</span> of libraries.

 In this section, mostly current magazines are stored in open display
 cases.  Comfortable seats are spread around for reading.  From here,
 you can see the reference section to the north, the main collection to
 the south, and you can return to the lobby to the west.

> LOOK UP WALLACE JOSEPHS IN BOOKS

 You look in the appropriate encyclopedia and find the entry for
 Wallace Josephs.  Your monocle helps with the small print and the book
 informs you that Wallace Josephs is the physician to the Philadelphia
 mob.  He is known for his callousness to the victims of those he
 assists.  Some profilers believe the man is schizophrenic, as he runs
 a typical sleep lab in the local hospital.  So far, he has evaded
 prosecution as authorities are still investigating him.

 Written in the margin, in pencil, by some unknown hand, is written:
 30th Street Train Station, Locker 7178- all the evidence you need to
 turn him in.

>set clock to wake up

 Somehow, you figure out how to manipulate the hairs on the muscle
 patch of the strange and horrible biological clock to set it to wake
 you up.  You're not sure how that works, but you figure, in a dream,
 it just does.  A ticking sound can be heard emitting from deep within
 the biological clock and as you hold it, it seems to throb slightly as
 it ticks.

 The biological clock continues to tick away.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The biological clock continues to tick away.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The biological clock continues to tick away.

>wait

 Time passes.

 The biological clock continues to tick away.

>examine clock

 It is a strange chunk of ... well, flesh, really.  It's pretty
 disgusting, especially because a rough circle of the flesh has been
 sickeningly ripped off, leaving a patch of bloody muscle.  What's also
 weird is that there is hair in this patch.  Upon closer inspection,
 the hair is growing in a precise way as to make a sort-of clock face
 on the muscle.  Two hairs grow from the center and point outward,
 making the hour and minute "hands", and small nubs of hair surround
 the circle, making a braille-like series of numbers to mark the time.
 <span class="floydstyle em">(To check the time, type "check time" or just "time".)</span>

 Finally, something happens.  The biological clock explodes in a fury
 of noise and gore.

 You awake and immediately see Dr. Richard Lynch looking over you.  He
 smiles and you relax a bit.  He seemingly doesn't know what you now
 know.  He doesn't know you were in his head all night.

 You leave the hospital early that morning with one destination in
 mind.
