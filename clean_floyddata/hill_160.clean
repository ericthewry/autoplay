 Was it only over a year ago? All the razzamatazz, all the hero
 marching, over by Christmas they said. You'd been in that bloody
 factory since the age of 14, gone through all the strikes and misery
 of the early 1900's now. There seemed a way out. At least you'd get
 fed and there was the glory of England to fight for. Oh, how merrily
 you marched away to the depot, not knowing whether or not you'd come
 home to a hero's welcome and a chest full of medals or become another
 statistic of the first world conflict in history.

 Two months later, all that was knocked out of you. Blanko. Fatigues.
 March, march march. Orders. Being bawled out by Sergeant Major Grant.
 Then at the new year, when you'd marched up and down half of France
 and having had been there for months on end, and stuck for all those
 dreadful weeks in First Eypre, or Wipers as you learned to call it,
 thrust into long and badly constructed trench lines, frozen nearly to
 death out there, you were ready to call it quits.

 Another summer has come and gone. You had your first leave and were
 promoted twice. First to Lance Corporal, then to Full Corporal. Now,
 you're off back again and you've got a platoon, with a few hardy souls
 and some new recruits mixed in. Fresh-faced boys, out of the training
 camp. They are totally raw, and know nothing about the life out here,
 have been fed all the bloody rubbish that home front propaganda can
 throw at them. After going through all that training and absolute
 misery, you are no longer a raw recruit, but are now a hardened
 veteran, after only a year or so.

 It's now the autumn of 1915 and here you are in the back of the
 support lorry that has gone as far as it can.

 Inside the Lorry
 You're in the back of a support lorry which has been driven as far as
 it can go.

 Along with you are your platoon, Sergeant Major Grant and a bunch of
 other men. They are all lurching about as your lorry makes it's way
 towards the front lines.

 Safe? Not really. You are not safe in here at all. Columns coming up
 to the front are the favourite targets for the German heavy guns to
 zero in on. You feel lucky this trip however. Earlier on, the lorry
 behind you copped it and tipped over. There were no survivors. Your
 shoulders ache like hell from the horrendous weight of your backpack.
 The lorry jerks to a stop and you hear the bark of your Sergeant
 Major:

 "All out Mates. Fall in on the road."

 The game is based on my studies of World War I. For history buffs,
 I've changed a few things to suit the game to make it more exciting.
 War is war and some of the language may offend some people, plus it's
 definitely not PC! For the competition, I have made it somewhat easier
 to get through to comply with the Comp rules. When it goes up on the
 archive, it will be much harder with Release 2. Some of the names were
 loosely taken from Frederick Manning's "The Middle Parts of Fortune" I
 have deliberately miss-spelled some of them, so as not to infringe
 copyright.

 I make no money out of this game, since I just want other text
 adventure players to enjoy the game and also to get a little taste of
 what war was like back then. If you enjoy this game, you might like to
 try my much harder game on the archive <span class="floydstyle i">"Genesis Quest" </span>. Also,
 to learn about the life of someone who's deaf and blind, read <span class="floydstyle i"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">"Touch Me Please" </span> available on Kindle.

 I would welcome sensible comments on the game, plus if anyone's really
 stuck, mail me also. See the credits and about the author for more
 details.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Inside the Lorry </span>
 You're in the back of a support lorry which has been driven as far as
 it can go.

 Along with you are your platoon, Sergeant Major Grant and a bunch of
 other men. They are all lurching about as your lorry makes it's way
 towards the front lines.

 Safe? Not really. You are not safe in here at all. Columns coming up
 to the front are the favourite targets for the German heavy guns to
 zero in on. You feel lucky this trip however. Earlier on, the lorry
 behind you copped it and tipped over. There were no survivors. Your
 shoulders ache like hell from the horrendous weight of your backpack.
 The lorry jerks to a stop and you hear the bark of your Sergeant
 Major:

 "<span class="floydstyle i">All out Mates. Fall in on the road."</span>

 :
>examine me
 :

 That's you Corporal Matey J. Butt: A battle-tested Brit, thrust into
 the bloody stinking war through no fault of your own. Tired of the
 drudgery of factory work, you enlisted for the glory that you thought
 would come to you for defending Mother England.

 You are wearing:
 a gun belt
 a pair of combat boots
 a backpack
 a battle helmet
 a uniform
 a trench gun
 a rifle

 :
>examine belt
 :

 This gun belt wraps around your waist and has a holster attached to
 it.

 :
>examine holster
 :

 This holster is for carrying your 1911 Colt automatic. It is currently
 closed.

 :
>open holster
 :

 You open the holster revealing: a pistol.

 :
>examine pistol
 :

 This 1911 Colt .45 Automatic fires .45 calibre bullets, and is nasty
 at very close range. It is currently loaded.

 :
>shoot Sergeant
 :

 You have no reason to do that.

 :
>shoot me
 :

 You don't have yourself.

 :
>shoot pistol at me
 :

 You're not carrying it.

 :
>dance
 :

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 :
>xyzzy
 :

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 :
>examine boots
 :

 Designed for all types of terrain, these are very rugged combat boots
 with hobnails on the soles. Normally black (brown for officers), they
 are made of reversed hide, without toe-caps, and with a steel plate on
 the heel.

 :
>remove boots
 :

 This is not the place to do that.

 :
>examine backpack
 :

 This is your pathetic excuse of a backpack. It is currently closed.

 :
>open backpack
 :

 You don't need to do that right now.

 :
>examine helmet
 :

 <span class="floydstyle em">The first delivery of a protective steel helmet (AKA Brodie</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">helmet) to the British Army was in 1915. Initially there were far from</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">enough helmets to equip every man, so they were designated as "trench</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">stores, to be kept in the front line and used by each unit that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">occupied the sector. It was not until the summer of 1916, when the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">first 1 million helmets had been produced, that they could be</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">generally issued. </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">The Brodie helmet reduced casualties but was criticized by General</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Herbert Plumer on the grounds that it was too shallow, too reflective,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">its rim was too sharp, and its lining was too slippery. These</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">criticisms were addressed in the Mark I model helmet of 1916 which had</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">a separate folded rim, a two-part liner, and matte khaki paint</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">finished with sand, sawdust, or crushed cork to give a dull,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">non-reflective appearance.</span>

 :
>march
 :

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 :
>exit
 :

 Like robots you all leave the lorry followed by Sergeant Major Grant
 and the rest of the platoon. Before you know it, the driver lurches
 off before the German guns can blow him the other men and the lorry to
 bits.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Road to the Battlefield</span>
 This rutted road, for want of a better word, leads and winds towards
 the front lines. No road is straight out here, they snake and twist
 round shell holes, they bridge deep mud, there are duckboards all over
 the place and it also has gaps in it, making the soldiers have to
 dodge round and return back to the road again. Another road leads west
 to a roadside camp and cafe. Sergeant Major Grant and your platoon are
 here.

 :
>examine duckboard
 :

 They are boardwalks or slatted flooring laid on wet, muddy, or cold
 surfaces.

 :
>talk to grant
 :

 With all the commotion going around you, you decide to wait until you
 get to the main trench before talking to anyone.

 :
>examine grant
 :

 He's a hard-faced bugger. In battle, as gentle as a lamb, but out of
 battle, hard as nails. He's been in for years now, and he's one of the
 old regulars. Rumour has it, that he could have had promotion years
 ago, but he was involved in some sort of trouble with one of his
 superior officers, who was one of those privileged types. All talk and
 no knowledge. Some men were killed because of that officer's lack of
 care. Grant, hard as he is, does care for his men and he felt bitter
 about what happened. He lost ten men when there was no need to lose
 any. He's always so well turned out. His uniform never seems to
 crease, not even in the height of battle. A good man to have beside
 you in a tight situation. Respected but never seems to show his gentle
 side, only when in battle. You respect him. Around his neck you see
 him wearing a key.

 :
>examine key
 :

 Which do you mean, the cabinet key or the housekey?

 :
>inventory
 :

 You are wearing:
 a gun belt
 a pair of combat boots
 a backpack
 a battle helmet
 a uniform
 a trench gun
 a rifle

 :
>examine trench gun
 :

 In reality it's a sawed off shotgun with 7 double-aught buckshot
 rounds in the magazine. It has a canvas sling attached to it for
 wearing on your back. It is currently loaded but the safety is on.

 :
>examine rifle
 :

 Your P14 Enfield is a bolt action weapon with an integral 5-round
 magazine. It was principally contract manufactured by companies in the
 United States. It serves as a sniper rifle and as second line and
 reserve issue. The P14 is the successor to the P13 Enfield and the
 predecessor of the U.S. Rifle M1917 Enfield.

 :
>go west
 :

 Your main objective right now is the trench to the north of you
 :
>desert
 :

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 :
>go north
 :

 You follow the Sergeant Major's orders and march along the road with
 your men falling in with the rest of the column. the road twists and
 bends, the mist still hangs around to the east and the line of shell
 holes lies to the west in its irregular line.

 Your feet ache and you are extremely tired. you had a restless night
 at the nearby base camp, the thunder of the guns from the front had
 kept you awake most of the night and the fact that you were going
 onwards to the front again made things worse.

 You march along wearily, swinging arms as on parade, just merely
 marching dejectedly, the front sucks youin to itself almost as you see
 the bobbing barrels of the troops in front of you.

 Your men are either side of you, but you keep bumping into them as
 they twist and turn their way along the road, stepping on to
 duckboards, deep puddles and bogs, the rain out here never seems to
 stop and the ground is extremely wet, even on some dry days, you have
 seen men sink with their heavy loads into deep mud and actually die,
 you can't always stop either to rescue them, those are your orders but
 you hate having to obey them at times.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 You are at the junction of two roads. The north-south road that you
 are on and an east-west road. To the north lie the trenches. To the
 east, lies a zone of mist, caused by gun fire from the main British
 heavy guns firing on known German batteries, and to the west, an open
 field with line of older shell holes, some of which contain dead
 bodies, which are unable to be buried. Falling into one of these can
 mean death. Many of the shell holes are full of water. However they
 can save your life if there is a bombardment.

 Sergeant Major Grant and your platoon are here.

 :
>go east
 :

 You leave the road, thinking you may find an easier way for your men
 than the long slog you are currently plowing through. You have entered
 a zone of mist, wafting up from the gunfire from your artillery,
 firing sporadically at German batteries. Far to your front, the shells
 pass over your head. At least you know they won't hit you, or they
 shouldn't. Rounds have been known to fall short, even back here and
 you well remember two very good friends of yours falling victim to
 just one stray round. At the time you cursed the gunners but the
 shells are in such short supply out here and not very well made that
 they have been known to land on your own side. As one swishes
 overhead, sounding like an express train, you move forward toward the
 misty zone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Zone of Mist</span>
 To the east of you, you can make out the huge gun pits that contain
 the British heavy guns. You see puffs of smoke emerging from the mists
 as shots are fired and shells pass overhead to the German lines,
 zeroing in on the enemy batteries. You can't see much in front of you
 here, just the heads of the troops bobbing up and down marching to and
 from the front line. Occasionally, you do hear large German shells
 being aimed at your own gun lines. Even though they fly over your
 head, they could be a danger to you as the ammo dump and gunline are
 east of here.

 [Previous turn undone.]

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Open Field</span>
 This open filed stretches west for as far as you can see and is
 littered with craters (or shell holes). As you survey the area, you
 hear the whizzing of the German shells overhead. You feel a vibration
 in the air. Fortunately there is an over-sized crater created by an
 earlier shelling nearby. Your instincts tell you that you either need
 to get into the crater or retreat back east as soon as possible. It's
 your choice Matey!

 :
>enter crater
 :

 It's a damn good thing you've entered the crater, because at that
 moment a German heavy shell or coal box as you call them, lands
 extemely close towhere you were standing. There is a fountain of mud
 and you get covered in it. At least it's just mud and not shell
 fragments. Luckily this time they haven't scored and the fragments
 whirl away uselessly and miss you. You take a deep breath, duck your
 head in case there's a follow up shell, and begin waiting for the
 shelling to cease.

 :
>exit crater
 :

 I only understood you as far as wanting to exit.

 :
>exit
 :

 You get out of the crater.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Open Field</span>
 The shelling has stopped for now so it's time to get your ample arse
 back to the Crossroads.

 :
>go east
 :

 You are now safely back in Crossroads.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 You are at the junction of two roads. The north-south road that you
 are on and an east-west road. To the north lie the trenches. To the
 east, lies a zone of mist, caused by gun fire from the main British
 heavy guns firing on known German batteries, and to the west, an open
 field with line of older shell holes, some of which contain dead
 bodies, which are unable to be buried. Falling into one of these can
 mean death. Many of the shell holes are full of water. However they
 can save your life if there is a bombardment.

 Sergeant Major Grant and your platoon are here.

 :
>go north
 :

 The only way for right now is east and hope that the shelling stops.

 :
>go east
 :

 You leave the road, thinking you may find an easier way for your men
 than the long slog you are currently plowing through. You have entered
 a zone of mist, wafting up from the gunfire from your artillery,
 firing sporadically at German batteries. Far to your front, the shells
 pass over your head. At least you know they won't hit you, or they
 shouldn't. Rounds have been known to fall short, even back here and
 you well remember two very good friends of yours falling victim to
 just one stray round. At the time you cursed the gunners but the
 shells are in such short supply out here and not very well made that
 they have been known to land on your own side. As one swishes
 overhead, sounding like an express train, you move forward toward the
 misty zone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Zone of Mist</span>
 To the east of you, you can make out the huge gun pits that contain
 the British heavy guns. You see puffs of smoke emerging from the mists
 as shots are fired and shells pass overhead to the German lines,
 zeroing in on the enemy batteries. You can't see much in front of you
 here, just the heads of the troops bobbing up and down marching to and
 from the front line. Occasionally, you do hear large German shells
 being aimed at your own gun lines. Even though they fly over your
 head, they could be a danger to you as the ammo dump and gunline are
 east of here.

 :
>go east
 :

 There's no good reason to visit the gun lines. You have a
 reconnaissance to fulfill.

 :

 I didn't understand that sentence.

 :
>go north
 :

 You can't go that way.

 :
>go south
 :

 You can't go that way.

 :

 :

 You head back to the Crossroads.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 You are at the junction of two roads. The north-south road that you
 are on and an east-west road. To the north lie the trenches. To the
 east, lies a zone of mist, caused by gun fire from the main British

 can save your life if there is a bombardment.

 Sergeant Major Grant and your platoon are here.

 :
>go north
 :

 You wind your way north. Your men are a mixed lot as you move further
 towards the front trench lines. You'll soon be settled down once you
 hit the trenches. You can see them now in the distance. They snake
 away in hap-hazard lines this way and that like a curved snake. You
 are getting nearer them as you trudge on. You'll be damn glad to get
 settled down, whatever that may mean. You hope you'll at least be able
 to rest your feet.

 One thing for sure: Once the weather is dry, it won't be too bad once
 you reach the trench. You almost feel as if you've come home. No one
 back in bloody London understands for one moment,what you have to go
 through out here and you don't want to enlighten them. They ask
 question after question but they would never understand what your
 world out here is like. It begins at the gun lines. That inevitable
 fear and yet, you feel at one with your men. There's a closeness
 there, with the regulars anyway. These new boys. How long will they
 last? They fall like flies out here.

 At last, you swing into the trench area along with all your men and
 settle yourselves as best as you can. There's that crinkled crude iron
 fence at the side of the trench, there's the usual parapet and
 parados, the reasonably dry bottom of the trench and just about enough
 room to sit down if you're lucky. Since you are the Corporal, you get
 a slightly better place to sit than do most of your men. The sound of
 distant ragged gunfire from the front is getting restless. The guns
 seem disturbed like a swarm of bees.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Trench</span>
 The Latrine is northeast of here. To northwest are a Communication
 Trench and a Dugout. No Man's Land is to the west. The atmosphere is
 tense, since you never know when the next shell might bury you under
 the earth of your dugout. Fortunately, this is one of the stronger
 ones and it can resist shell fire, for a short while anyway.

 :

 You need to get some rest first.

 Weeper starts complaining:

 <span class="floydstyle i">"Hey Corporal? Got any cigs?" </span>

 that lot.

 been left out there to die. He's always been generous with his other

 "They've a bloody right to live", he's always said, and many a man

 don't mind giving him a smoke, though you do wonder when the day will
 come when he gives you one.

 sleep playing their game of cards in your ears.

 :
>sleep
 :

 As you are dreaming, the trench shakes and you are awake and alert,
 have the shells hit the trench, you feel the ground shake as you
 awaken. another shell crashes outside, shaking the dugout again, but
 it doesn't give way.

 Then you hear that high pitch squeaking, rasping and harsh.

 Bloody rats! They have been driven into the trench by the shelling.

 You feel tiny feet beginning to run across you. The rats smell the
 food in the trench. They know where it is and they are also
 frightened. Someone in the trench gives a yell and a few home-made
 candles are lit.

 Was it only over a year ago? All the razzamatazz, all the hero
 marching, over by Christmas they said. You'd been in that bloody
 factory since the age of 14, gone through all the strikes and misery
 of the early 1900's now. There seemed a way out. At least you'd get
 fed and there was the glory of England to fight for. Oh, how merrily
 you marched away to the depot, not knowing whether or not you'd come
 home to a hero's welcome and a chest full of medals or become another
 statistic of the first world conflict in history.

 Two months later, all that was knocked out of you. Blanko. Fatigues.
 March, march march. Orders. Being bawled out by Sergeant Major Grant.
 Then at the new year, when you'd marched up and down half of France
 and having had been there for months on end, and stuck for all those
 dreadful weeks in First Eypre, or Wipers as you learned to call it,
 thrust into long and badly constructed trench lines, frozen nearly to
 death out there, you were ready to call it quits.

 Another summer has come and gone. You had your first leave and were
 promoted twice. First to Lance Corporal, then to Full Corporal. Now,
 you're off back again and you've got a platoon, with a few hardy souls
 and some new recruits mixed in. Fresh-faced boys, out of the training
 camp. They are totally raw, and know nothing about the life out here,
 have been fed all the bloody rubbish that home front propaganda can
 throw at them. After going through all that training and absolute
 misery, you are no longer a raw recruit, but are now a hardened
 veteran, after only a year or so.

 It's now the autumn of 1915 and here you are in the back of the
 support lorry that has gone as far as it can.

 <span class="floydstyle i">Inside the Lorry </span>
 You're in the back of a support lorry which has been driven as far as
 it can go.

 Along with you are your platoon, Sergeant Major Grant and a bunch of
 other men. They are all lurching about as your lorry makes it's way
 towards the front lines.

 Safe? Not really. You are not safe in here at all. Columns coming up
 to the front are the favourite targets for the German heavy guns to
 zero in on. You feel lucky this trip however. Earlier on, the lorry
 behind you copped it and tipped over. There were no survivors. Your
 shoulders ache like hell from the horrendous weight of your backpack.
 The lorry jerks to a stop and you hear the bark of your Sergeant
 Major:

 "<span class="floydstyle i">All out Mates. Fall in on the road."</span>

 :
>exit
 :

 Like robots you all leave the lorry followed by Sergeant Major Grant
 and the rest of the platoon. Before you know it, the driver lurches
 off before the German guns can blow him the other men and the lorry to
 bits.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Road to the Battlefield</span>
 This rutted road, for want of a better word, leads and winds towards
 the front lines. No road is straight out here, they snake and twist
 round shell holes, they bridge deep mud, there are duckboards all over
 the place and it also has gaps in it, making the soldiers have to
 dodge round and return back to the road again. Another road leads west
 to a roadside camp and cafe. Sergeant Major Grant and your platoon are
 here.

 :
>go north
 :

 You follow the Sergeant Major's orders and march along the road with
 your men falling in with the rest of the column. the road twists and
 bends, the mist still hangs around to the east and the line of shell
 holes lies to the west in its irregular line.

 Your feet ache and you are extremely tired. you had a restless night
 at the nearby base camp, the thunder of the guns from the front had
 kept you awake most of the night and the fact that you were going
 onwards to the front again made things worse.

 You march along wearily, swinging arms as on parade, just merely
 marching dejectedly, the front sucks youin to itself almost as you see
 the bobbing barrels of the troops in front of you.

 Your men are either side of you, but you keep bumping into them as
 they twist and turn their way along the road, stepping on to
 duckboards, deep puddles and bogs, the rain out here never seems to
 stop and the ground is extremely wet, even on some dry days, you have
 seen men sink with their heavy loads into deep mud and actually die,
 you can't always stop either to rescue them, those are your orders but
 you hate having to obey them at times.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
 You are at the junction of two roads. The north-south road that you
 are on and an east-west road. To the north lie the trenches. To the
 east, lies a zone of mist, caused by gun fire from the main British
 heavy guns firing on known German batteries, and to the west, an open
 field with line of older shell holes, some of which contain dead
 bodies, which are unable to be buried. Falling into one of these can
 mean death. Many of the shell holes are full of water. However they
 can save your life if there is a bombardment.

 Sergeant Major Grant and your platoon are here.

 :
>go east
 :

 You leave the road, thinking you may find an easier way for your men
 than the long slog you are currently plowing through. You have entered
 a zone of mist, wafting up from the gunfire from your artillery,
 firing sporadically at German batteries. Far to your front, the shells
 pass over your head. At least you know they won't hit you, or they
 shouldn't. Rounds have been known to fall short, even back here and
 you well remember two very good friends of yours falling victim to
 just one stray round. At the time you cursed the gunners but the
 shells are in such short supply out here and not very well made that
 they have been known to land on your own side. As one swishes
 overhead, sounding like an express train, you move forward toward the
 misty zone.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Zone of Mist</span>
 To the east of you, you can make out the huge gun pits that contain
 the British heavy guns. You see puffs of smoke emerging from the mists
 as shots are fired and shells pass overhead to the German lines,
 zeroing in on the enemy batteries. You can't see much in front of you
 here, just the heads of the troops bobbing up and down marching to and
 from the front line. Occasionally, you do hear large German shells
 being aimed at your own gun lines. Even though they fly over your
 head, they could be a danger to you as the ammo dump and gunline are
 east of here.

 :
>go west
 :

 You head back to the Crossroads.

 east, lies a zone of mist, caused by gun fire from the main British
 heavy guns firing on known German batteries, and to the west, an open
 field with line of older shell holes, some of which contain dead
 bodies, which are unable to be buried. Falling into one of these can
 mean death. Many of the shell holes are full of water. However they
 can save your life if there is a bombardment.

 Sergeant Major Grant and your platoon are here.

 :
>go north
 :

 You wind your way north. Your men are a mixed lot as you move further
 towards the front trench lines. You'll soon be settled down once you
 hit the trenches. You can see them now in the distance. They snake
 away in hap-hazard lines this way and that like a curved snake. You
 are getting nearer them as you trudge on. You'll be damn glad to get
 settled down, whatever that may mean. You hope you'll at least be able
 to rest your feet.

 One thing for sure: Once the weather is dry, it won't be too bad once
 you reach the trench. You almost feel as if you've come home. No one
 back in bloody London understands for one moment,what you have to go
 through out here and you don't want to enlighten them. They ask
 question after question but they would never understand what your
 world out here is like. It begins at the gun lines. That inevitable
 fear and yet, you feel at one with your men. There's a closeness
 there, with the regulars anyway. These new boys. How long will they
 last? They fall like flies out here.

 At last, you swing into the trench area along with all your men and
 settle yourselves as best as you can. There's that crinkled crude iron
 fence at the side of the trench, there's the usual parapet and
 parados, the reasonably dry bottom of the trench and just about enough
 room to sit down if you're lucky. Since you are the Corporal, you get
 a slightly better place to sit than do most of your men. The sound of
 distant ragged gunfire from the front is getting restless. The guns
 seem disturbed like a swarm of bees.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Trench</span>
 The Latrine is northeast of here. To northwest are a Communication
 Trench and a Dugout. No Man's Land is to the west. The atmosphere is
 tense, since you never know when the next shell might bury you under
 the earth of your dugout. Fortunately, this is one of the stronger
 ones and it can resist shell fire, for a short while anyway.

 Weeper starts complaining:

 <span class="floydstyle i">"Hey Corporal? Got any cigs?" </span>

 You groan to yourself. He's always cadging other peoples cigarettes.
 He never seems to have any of his own, or if he does, he never shares
 them.

 You open your backpack revealing:
 a blanket, a bayonet, a spare pair of socks, a singlet, a bunch of
 underwear, a mess kit, a shovel, a canteen, a bunch of sweets, a
 powder jar, a cigarette tin, a cigarette lighter, a boot laces, a
 bunch of spare buttons, a spool of thread, a needle, some safepins, a
 bar of soap, a toothbrush, a pair of wirecutters, a gas mask, twelve
 grenades, twelve ammo clips and twelve shotshells.

 You remove a cigarette from the tin and give it to Weeper.

 If you don't he'll keep bugging you until you do. He's always been
 generous with his other stuff, such as any spare food and he's even
 brought men in from No Man's Land many a time when they would have
 been left out there to die. He's always been generous with his other

 "They've a bloody right to live", he's always said, and many a man
 sent back to the dressing stations has reason to thank Weeper, so you
 don't mind giving him a smoke, though you do wonder when the day will
 come when he gives you one.

 You remove your trench gun, rifle, and rest your head on your hands

 You sleep on. Suddenly, you are awoken by Grant. He shakes your
 shoulder roughly and you wake up. Your eyes are gummed up with sleep.

 <span class="floydstyle i">"Corporal, we're out of food. Those miserable bloody stinking rats</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">have ruined our supplies. Parties were supposed to bring fresh food</span>

 You curse to yourself, as the survival rate of runners is extremely
 low. You've seen as many as a dozen lost in one night. You know the
 risk you will take, but someone has to go out and get the food, and
 deliver it to Grant's dugout.

 Ok.

 :
 :

 (first closing the backpack)
 You wear the rifle, trench gun, and pack. You're now equipped.

 :
 :

 Until you get some sleep, you're not ready to go anywhere.

 :
>rest
 :

 Once again, you settle down to sleep, hoping there won't be any more
 rats to tackle. Often however, they return again and again. you all
 try all the tricks you can think of, you hang bread above your head on
 thin wires made from broken phone cables but the rats will often leap
 on the bread, even when it's hung up.

 :
 :

 You return to your dream of home, it is a lovely summers day now and
 you are sitting drinking a beer out in your very small garden with
 your wife, the sun is shining down on you.

 :
 :

 You sleep on. Suddenly, you are awoken by Grant. He shakes your
 shoulder roughly and you wake up. Your eyes are gummed up with sleep.
 You get to your feet and Grant barks:

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">"Talk to me Corporal!"</span>

 :
 :

  Grant looks you in the eye:

 <span class="floydstyle i">"Corporal, we're out of food. Those miserable bloody stinking rats</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">have ruined our supplies. Parties were supposed to bring fresh food</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">up. They have been delayed by Jerry shelling, but I've received a</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">message that more is on the way, and I need someone to go out there</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">and collect supplies. That person is you. You know what to do, since</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">you've done runner duties before and you're both reliable and don't</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">crack easily. We are out on a mission late tomorrow. There's an attack</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">coming and I need to know the Jerry strength on the other side of this</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">hill. The men need supplies for the attack, and it's up to you to go</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">get them." </span>

 You curse to yourself, as the survival rate of runners is extremely
 low. You've seen as many as a dozen lost in one night. You know the
 risk you will take, but someone has to go out and get the food, and
 deliver it to Grant's dugout.

 You reply: <span class="floydstyle i">"Sir Yes Sir!" </span> Grant heads off to his dugout.

 :

 Slowly and carefully, you lift yourself over the parados of the
 trench.

 :
 :

 Slowly and carefully, you lift yourself over the parados of the
 trench. You start running and move as fast as you can, you have to
 dodge round newly made holes in the ground from the shelling. It's a
 stumbling run you make, hardly simple running as the ground is so
 uneven and you are dodging round shell holes.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Battlefield</span>
 All around you are the signs of past battles. Bits and pieces of
 abandoned guns, even some scraps of clothing, rotting corpses and
 general flotsam and jetsam of war. This area of the battlefield is
 now, however, reasonably safe, which is why the supply party is here,
 safe is a mere term because the Germans regularly target this part of
 the field, knowing ration parties use this route to reach the front.
 They have it under their eye so it's wise for you to do what you need
 and depart quickly.

 :
>go north


 You continue towards the direction in which you hope to meet the
 supply party.

 Your eyes are pinned on the general direction, you hope to see the
 pinpoint of the light of the party crawling forwards towards you. You
 hear the woosh of an over head shell. This one misses you and lands
 far to your east. you feel mud spatter up from the explosion.

 :
>go north
 :

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You run towards what you hope is the supply party. Just as you see</span>
 the pinpoint of light, rockets go up in the sky, lighting up the whole
 area. Now you are exposed to the German lines, their long range guns
 can target this area now as can their machine guns. You hear the
 rat-a-tat tat of the machine guns. Bullets spray all around you. You
 keep going, hoping to reach the party. Unfortunately a stream of
 bullets is fired and most of them find you. You fall forward on your
 face. you feel very little as you drift into unconsiousness and the
 life force leaves your body.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GAME OVER MATEY!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader"> Hey Corporal Butt! You've blown it I'm afraid. Want another</span>
 chance?



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OK, Here we go ! ! !</span>

 :

 You stand again and run for all you are worth, your breath is nearly
 spent when you catch sight of that small light you were looking for.

 You head towards it and reach the party.

 Several men from a supply party are here.

 :
>take supplies
 :

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The men in the party look at you extremely funny. One bloke asks</span>
 another: "Why is this bugger just trying to take the supplies?" He
 pulls out his pistol and places a 45 caliber bullet squarely in your
 forehead.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">GAME OVER MATEY!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OK, Here we go ! ! !</span>

 :
>talk to men


 You can't talk to the supply party.

 :
>ask men for supplies


 The men hand over the supplies to you. You remove a lump of beef from
 the supplies, open your pack and mess kit, put the beef in the kit,
 close both the pack and it, and turn south to head back to the trench.

 :
>go south
 :

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You take the supplies and make your way southwards to the trench.</span>
 You go as fast as you can and can see the trench coming towards you.
 Suddenly rockets light up the sky. It's as bright as day again. You
 are in full view. a machine gun post opens up and bullets spray all
 around you. Some eventually find you and you scream in pain.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You are left outside the trench and no one can come to rescue you.</span>
 They dare not risk it with gun fire.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You are in extreme pain now. You are bleeding seriously as well.</span>
 There seems no hope for you. You have died! GAME OVER MATEY!

 <span class="floydstyle subheader"> Hey Corporal Butt! You've blown it I'm afraid. Want another</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">OK, Here we go ! ! !</span>

 Now you are weighed down by your supplies. You make what speed you
 can. It's not a run this time but a fast walk, though you are weighed
 down, you realise that you are in danger all the way back to the
 trench.

 You make your way towards the trench. As you are nearing it, you hear
 a shell whiz overhead, it misses you and you carry on faster this
 time. You finally reach the edge of the trench, heave yourself over
 the edge of the parados and flop into the trench.

 You are shaking now. it's the shock. it always affects you that way.
 you open your pack and take your canteen. You open it and take a long
 drink from it and then close it. Your water is laced with cheap rum
 that you bought from one of your mates. You feel better now and the
 shaking has ended.

 There's not much of the night left. You set the supplies down next to
 you. Your stomach is now telling you that it's chow time and even
 though you're dead tired, it's time to dig into that nasty beef.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Trench</span>
 The Latrine is northeast of here. To northwest are a Communication
 Trench and a Dugout. No Man's Land is to the west. The atmosphere is
 tense, since you never know when the next shell might bury you under
 the earth of your dugout. Fortunately, this is one of the stronger
 ones and it can resist shell fire, for a short while anyway.

 Your open pack is here on the ground.

 I can't forget my faithful coder Al who also did the maps, and helped
 me test the game and get the bugs out. Without him, there would be no
