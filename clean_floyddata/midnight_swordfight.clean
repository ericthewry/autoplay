 This game has a limited action system. All the verbs you can use at
 any given time will be listed in the playscript kept in your
 inventory, which you can consult with EXAMINE PLAYSCRIPT. Others
 aren't likely to work, and guessing verbs isn't necessary. However, it
 may help to double-check the playscript under different circumstances

 <span class="floydstyle header">Midnight. Swordfight.</span>
 A Folly by Chandler Groover
 Release 1 / Serial number 151019 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Stroke</span>
 How did you ever get into this predicament? A rumor, a glove thrown
 down onto a dance-floor? Now you're standing in the moonlight and your
 knees are knocking together, although you hope that no one notices.
 You're still dressed for a masquerade and nothing feels quite real.
 But it must be real.

 The scene is set: landscape garden.

 The cast: your second, Ferdinand, handing your weapon over; your
 rival's second, Onegin, handing <span class="floydstyle em">her</span> weapon over; and your
 rival -- the countess.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">En garde!</span>" the countess cries.

 The countess is suddenly there, only inches away. A clash is ringing
 in your ears and you can see your own sword sailing out over the
 garden. More importantly, you can feel her sword sinking into your
 stomach.

 "Revenge," she whispers in your ear, "is always sweeter than
 forgiveness."

>attack

 You'll need to ATTACK (someone or something).

>attack countess

 You lunge toward the countess with your cutlass. Initiative should
 matter during a duel, shouldn't it? But then there is a clash and you
 find your blade scraping the countess's rapier as she drives you back
 with a parry.

 Sparks fly from your feuding swords. You are both dancing over the
 lawn, back and forth, here and there, and somehow you are still alive.
 It's unbelievable. But that comes to an end when you make a misstep
 and the countess waltzes right into the opening.

 How did you get into the air? Why can't you feel anything? And what is
 your body doing down there without a head?

 Oh.

>kiss countess

 You cast aside your weapon. You cannot fight the countess. This feud
 is a mistake. Instead you walk across the lawn toward her.

 She must see it in your eyes. She must know how you feel. Perhaps she
 even has the same feelings?

 Apparently not, because what you get is her rapier plunged into your
 mouth. It keeps plunging until your lips are pressed onto its hilt.

 At least you got to kiss something.

>attack Onegin

 The countess? The countess? Why should you fight the countess when
 that bastard Onegin is undoubtedly the mastermind behind this whole
 charade?

 You're overcome with outrage and you lunge toward Onegin. It's
 certainly a pretty sight to see him flinch, but your cutlass never
 even grazes him before you've been repelled by the countess. Her sword
 intercepts your own; she's faster; she has pushed you back.

 "Your challenge is with me!" she says.

 And then her rapier is in your gut, your innards spilling out. Somehow
 she must have done it when your focus was on Onegin. His smile is the
 last thing that you see, and your intestines are the last thing that
 you feel as you try to push them back inside.

 You aren't successful.

>attack Ferdinand

 Something whispers in your brain, like a perverse worm, encouraging
 you to attack Ferdinand, and you do. Onegin and the countess are
 irrelevant. All your frustrations erupt in your own second's
 direction.

 You swing around, your cutlass slashing sideways through the air, in
 order to take Ferdinand by surprise, but in the brief moment before
 your weapon would connect, you realize your mistake: nothing can take
 Ferdinand by surprise.

 She has your wrist, her knee is in your gut, and suddenly your arm is
 bending backward in her grasp. You can see in her eyes something
 nobody living has seen. That is because everyone who has seen it is
 dead. It is killing intent.

 "If this is how you repay your allies," says Ferdinand, "no wonder you
 have enemies."

 Now she has your sword, but she does not wait too long before
 returning it.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">En garde!</span>" the countess cries.

>examine her

 Ferdinand told you to run, but you were never going to listen, which
 is why she's serving as your second now. Her head is shaved completely
 bald, she has grown out her moustache and goatee, and she is wearing a
 captain's coat with epaulettes. It's a pity that she couldn't fight in
 your place; then the match might have been more even.

 The countess is suddenly there, only inches away. A clash is ringing

 That's not in the playscript.

>examine countess

 The countess cuts a formidable figure with her rapier upraised, its
 point a silver promise in the moonlight. Her face is partly hidden by
 a mask, her lips a scarlet smile underneath. Even encumbered by her
 outrageous gown (and it is indeed outrageous) you have no doubt that
 she is the better swordsman, and she seems to have no doubt about it
 either.

 She is suddenly there, only inches away. A clash is ringing in your

 You're dressed as a chequered jester with enormous sleeves and

 A thousand luminescent jellyfish have been stitched together to create
 the countess's gown. They cannot breathe well in the open air, but
 their gasping only makes them glow more wonderfully. Their tentacles
 and arms drag out behind her in a stinging, lightning-crackled trail,
 but the countess moves just as gracefully as the jellyfish themselves
 would in water.

 She is suddenly there, only inches away. A clash is ringing in your

 You aren't wearing the countess's domino mask.


 That's not in the playscript.


 A domino mask fashioned entirely from pearls covers the countess's
 face. Far from romantic, it seems to lend the skin around her eyes a
 lesioned, bubbling appearance, or perhaps suggest frog-eggs or caviar.
 Nobody else would be able to wear such a thing without looking a
 fright; the countess makes it look impeccable.

 She is suddenly there, only inches away. A clash is ringing in your

 You open your eyes.
 You open your eyes.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ballroom</span>
 On the floor you can see a white glove where it has been
 contemptuously thrown down, and expanding outward from this glove the
 world takes form. There are dancers surrounding you in a circle, but
 they are not dancing: they are staring at you and staring at the
 glove, and their eyeballs never cease staring because they are frozen.

 There has been some hitch and time stands still.

 A chandelier hangs overhead, candles unflickering. Everything is
 mirrored in the marble floor. Toward the future you can glimpse the
 grand staircase, where the countess is ascending with her back turned
 after having delivered her challenge.

 Maybe you ought to try examining your playscript.


 That's not in the playscript.

 A simple white glove.

>past

 Time doesn't bend that way from here.

>examine dancers

 You cannot recognize anyone behind their masks. There is a jackal in a
 tailcoat, and a nymph with shellfish in her hair, and an enchantress
 with gold orbs for eyes, and someone with marzipan skin, and an alpine
 maiden with a shepherd's crook, and an antlered baron, and a raven in
 a judge's wig, and a sequined succubus, and other masqueraders more
 fantastic still, but the one thing they all have in common is that
 their frozen gazes are condemning you: Guilty, they seem to say,
 guilty.

>examine countess

 Looking at the countess now, you can still feel the shame and
 confusion and rage that washed over you when she first threw down this
 glove -- or was it the only time she threw down the glove? Is this
 moment the same as the other? You were too shocked to respond, and
 could only watch her sail away through the crowd, up the grand
 staircase, like some royal frigate among smaller vessels bobbing in
 her wake.

>examine jackal

 It's strange, but when you look at the individual dancers their
 details warp as though you were looking at something from inside a
 fishbowl.

>inventory

 You are carrying a playscript, and you are wearing motley.

>examine motley

 You thought you would look rather charming in motley when you selected
 this costume, but considering the circumstances you look more like a
 genuine fool than you ever intended -- with or <span class="floydstyle em">without</span> the
 costume.

>examine chandelier

 You once heard a story about a chandelier falling on a crowd during a
 dance and crushing everyone under its weight. It just goes to show
 that you never know when death will come calling, or how.

>examine floor

 You look down and find your reflection looking back from the polished
 marble. Apart from you, your mirrored double is the only thing that
 moves in this ballroom.

>examine staircase

 Grand staircase? Monumental staircase is more like it. Battalions
 could march down those red-carpeted steps with room to spare, but
 right now the countess has the staircase to herself with her tentacled
 gown trailing behind her.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grand Staircase</span>
 When you reach the grand staircase landing, the countess is already
 gone, which is to say that she was never here at this particular
 moment. Perhaps she just left or perhaps she's about to arrive, but
 the salient point is that you're not going to find her.

 Ferdinand, however, is leaning against a balustrade, her gaze cast
 toward the dancers in their formations below. She isn't one for
 dancing herself unless it's atop freshly slain enemies. Her cutlass,
 which you will borrow later in your duel with the countess, is leaning
 against the balustrade beside her.

 The ballroom is in the past now, and in the future you will look
 behind a polar bear.

>examine ferdinand

 Your oldest friend, Ferdinand might also be your only friend left now.
 There's no one more experienced when it comes to warfare, and in most
 situations you'd take whatever tactical advice she had to give. But
 when she drew you aside earlier tonight and told you that your goose
 was going to be cooked -- that the countess, indeed, was stoking the
 fire -- you assured her that you'd baste yourself thoroughly first.
 She didn't think it was funny. She also knew she wouldn't change your
 mind.

>ask ferdinand about cutlass

 That's not in the playscript.

>examine cutlass

 Ferdinand's cutlass has lopped away more heads than ever rolled during
 a revolution. But although she's agreed to lend you her weapon for the
 upcoming duel, you'll probably lose your own fingers before you even
 scratch the countess with it.

>talk to ferdinand

 You can't talk to Ferdinand. She is paralyzed and will remain
 paralyzed in this moment.

>kiss ferdinand

 You respect Ferdinand far too much to take any liberties with her,
 even as a joke. There's also the fact that she'd have your head if she
 ever found out that you'd stolen a kiss.

>examine dancers

 Right now the dancers appear to be engaged in a minuet, although
 nobody is moving and there's no music. You always found the minuet
 rather tedious, but this takes it to a new level.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Behind a Polar Bear</span>
 Dmitri's chest is pressed against the wall, arms overhead with his
 fingernails raking down the wallpaper. Onegin is straddling his rear,
 gripping his waist, paused mid-thrust with his cock halfway inside
 Dmitri's cunt -- or maybe halfway out?

 As the countess's minion, it is Onegin's duty to carry her weapon, and
 right now her rapier is resting nearby on the floor in an opened case.

 The polar bear itself is at least three meters tall, preserved
 taxidermically in a perpetual roar with claws outspread. Traveling
 counter-clockwise would reorient you toward the black salon, and the
 grand staircase is in your past.

 You squint but can't see that.

>take weapon

 When you try to take the rapier, you feel something resist, and then
 it occurs to you: there will always need to be some weapon in this
 case, otherwise the countess would be unarmed during the duel later.
 You'll need to find a replacement and drop it here if you want to
 remove the rapier.

>examine dmitri

 It's unbelievable. Dmitri ought to know better than this. There must
 be, what, a few hundred people attending this masquerade ball, and he
 has to cavort with that bastard Onegin? You can't fathom what's going
 through his head, but at least there's one upshot: he has Onegin
 distracted, and the countess's unguarded weapon is yours to meddle
 with.

>examine onegin

 Onegin, that bastard. He's just got to fuck everything in your life,
 doesn't he? First it was spreading that rumor (probably) and now it's
 this. You wonder how people like him even come to exist. What
 influences must have converged to plant him right here, at this
 moment, with Dmitri, behind this godforsaken polar bear.

 Black sable tapestries hang from the ceiling and walls, and black
 velvet carpets the floor. Scarlet radiance slants through scarlet
 windowpanes. An ebony grandfather clock has stopped keeping the time
 at one quarter to twelve.

 There is nobody here.

 Clockwise you will look behind a polar bear, and when you glance back
 toward the past you can see a celebration in the banquet hall where
 everyone has gathered to drink, feast, and make merry.

>examine tapestries

 Such trappings bring to mind the plush interiors that cushion
 high-class coffins.

>examine windows

 When you glance outside through the scarlet windowpanes you can see
 great tripods burning. Heretics writhe in their flames. It's a
 glorious <span class="floydstyle em">auto-da-fe</span>.

>look behind tapestries

 You squint but can't see that.

>examine tripods

 You see nothing special about the heretics burning on the tripods.
 They're what you might call "garden variety." But you'll be in a
 similar spot if you can't finagle some method to outwit the countess
 soon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Banquet Hall</span>
 Somehow a rift must have opened, because obese cherubs are pouring
 through the air onto the banquet-table; or at least, they would be
 pouring if they were in motion. There are several hundred, faces
 grimacing and feathered wings shedding blue pinions, and in their
 conglomerate they have impacted the table at one end, sending the
 other end skyward like a see-saw. Some even appear to be crawling
 upward along the table as rats would a mast aboard a sinking ship.

 This arrangement has naturally relocated the banquet itself into
 midair, where roasts and cakes and goblets and plates hang with their
 glazes and their silver sparkling. A tremendous kielbasa glistens
 temptingly.

 When it comes to the diners, most have already departed, although a
 few remain watching the cherubs with mild interest from seats pushed
 back against the walls. One lady dressed as a swan is eating angels on
 horseback, with a champagne flute daintily suspended in her other
 hand.

 A clockwise inclination would direct you into the aftermath, while
 moving counter-clockwise would steer you toward the cloak room, and in
 the future yawns the black salon.

>take kielbasa

 You pry the kielbasa from midair and heft it in one hand to test its
 weight. Yes, yes, this kielbasa will make for a perfectly delicious
 weapon in the right context.

>examine swan

 She has outdone herself. Apart from her two human hands, this lady
 looks <span class="floydstyle em">exactly</span> like a swan. It is uncanny. She would probably
 waddle and peck breadcrumbs if she could move.

>examine angels

 The "angels" are oysters, and they are "on horseback" because they've
 been wrapped in bacon. These angels have also been speared with a
 skewer, which the swan-lady is holding to her beak between thumb and
 forefinger.

>examine flute

 It is never too early or late for champagne. When there's no occasion
 for champagne, then the champagne makes the occasion.

>examine cherubs

 For some reason artists always represent cherubs as adorable little
 darlings when the truth is that they're hideous. Their skulls are
 elongated, their black eyes bulbous, their tiered teeth serrated, and
 their flesh cracked where an ordinary infant would have folds. A
 piranha would look friendlier.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aftermath</span>
 Splintered glasses, paper streamers, confetti, and cigarette butts
 litter the floor. You cannot step anywhere without crunching something
 underfoot. The banquet-table has been thoroughly demolished, cracked
 into two halves that lean inward toward a sunken middle.

 Everyone else is gone, but Dmitri is sitting at the table as though
 nothing has happened, reading a book and nursing a martini.

 "Well, well," he says when you enter, "look who the cat dragged in!"

 Moving counter-clockwise would return you to the banquet hall when it
 was slightly more intact. Slightly.

>examine dmitri

 Vines dripping with muscatel grapes are draped like laurels around
 Dmitri's ears, and he has a toga knotted over one shoulder. He's not
 an adolescent but he's still blooming with youth like one. Some people
 never seem to age, not even when time's moving properly.

>examine book

 "They're fables," explains Dmitri. "Someone left this book behind and
 I've just been skimming the stories. Here, listen to this one."

 He clears his throat and then begins:

 "<span class="floydstyle em">Sly Bertrand and Ratto in company sat </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">(the one was a monkey, the other a cat) </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">before a fire to watch chestnuts roasting. </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Said Bertrand to Ratto, his voice imploring:</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"'My brother, you ought to exhibit your skill </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and fish out those nuts so we can eat our fill. </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Your paws are suited expertly to the task </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">whereas I am afraid mine would just burn, alas.'</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"'It is done,' answered Ratto, extending a paw </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">and attempting to dig through the ash with his claw. </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">One after another out the chestnuts popped </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">though Ratto was still scorched before he had stopped.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">"Yet the poor cat had nothing to eat </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">for the monkey had made his retreat </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">with the chestnuts in hand; peasants bring </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">power in this manner to their king.</span>

 "I believe that the phrase 'cat's paw' is derived from this fable,"
 says Dmitri, "but what <span class="floydstyle em">I</span> want to know is why a monkey and cat
 were eating roasted chestnuts in the first place."

>talk to dmitri

 "Honestly," says Dmitri, "I'm surprised you're still alive. I suppose
 that you must have done something tricky to manage that, eh? Put your
 finger on the record to stop the universe from turning, then slipped
 out the back door to dodge your appointment with the countess?
 Otherwise you'd be dead. You're an incompetent swordsman. I've seen
 you. But I guess it doesn't matter: you're here now, whenever
 <span class="floydstyle em">now</span> is in the grand scheme.

 "I'm afraid that you won't find many others still hanging around
 though. They've all gone. It's dreadfully late -- or maybe dreadfully
 early? Early and late are the same when the hour is right. But you
 know me. I never sleep."

 He pauses to turn a page in his book.

 "Can't wake up when I do," he says.

>countess

 "I'll tell you how I first saw the countess," says Dmitri. "It was a
 twilight evening some years back, and I was standing outside with the
 crowd on the steps leading into the opera house. If you aren't
 familiar with the opera house, it's situated beside a canal, and a
 long stairway runs down from the piazza to the water. People arrive in
 gondolas, and naturally there's a lot of preening and parading on that
 staircase.

 "Well, from where I was standing I could see something marvelous
 coming down the water. It was like a carriage, like a chariot,
 completely gold and drawn by seven bottlenose dolphins. They were
 pulling it through the canal just like a horse would pull a carriage
 on a street. But what's a bottlenose dolphin, you ask? I didn't know
 at the time, but since then I've learned that they're a highly
 endangered marine mammal. They look like very large, sleek fish, and
 supposedly there aren't more than fifty still alive. And
 <span class="floydstyle em">seven</span> were pulling that chariot through the canal. You can
 imagine the spectacle when it drew to a stop at the staircase and its
 passenger emerged. That passenger was none other than the countess.

 "You don't need me to describe her appearance. She's always the most
 gorgeous person in the room -- or, in this case, on the waterfront.
 Everything she wore shimmered with diamonds. The world seemed to come
 into more focus around her, to clarify, like something magnified under
 a jeweler's loupe. You could feel that everybody in the crowd had
 either fallen in love with her immediately (if they weren't in love
 with her already), or that they were just boiling with jealousy, but
 she didn't pay any attention to them. She didn't climb the staircase
 either. Instead she went over to a walkway extending beneath a nearby
 bridge's underpass and came out again with the most grimy little
 urchin in the city. That child had been camped beneath that underpass
 for weeks, eating rats from a sewage pipe that emptied into the canal.
 Since there weren't many rats, the child wasn't very healthy. The
 countess took the child and actually wrapped it in her own cloak,
 right there in front of everybody at the opera house, and then she
 helped it step into her chariot and drove away again without even the
 slightest hello or goodbye to her socialite peers.

 "What an outrage that scene caused! I can hardly remember the opera
 itself because I was still thinking about the countess during the
 whole performance. Later on, the scandal was splashed all over the
 papers, but the countess never cared. She had seen someone in need and
 that was the only thing that mattered to her. Now I have it on good
 authority that her street urchin eats all the rats that anyone could
 ever want."

>time

 "What does anyone know about time?" says Dmitri. "It's always slipping
 away like an eel when you want it to stay put, and when you've got no
 use for it, why, then of course it drags its feet worse than a convict
 with a ball and chain. Time's a contrarian, that's what it is. It
 never makes any sense, so finally you stop trying to look for any
 sense in it."

 "That street urchin will probably be an earl or something by the time
 that the countess is finished," says Dmitri. "You know that she's more
 than a countess herself? She's got enough titles and styles in
 different countries and districts and principalities or whatever that
 she can pick what she wants to be called. It wouldn't be wrong to
 address her as a baroness, a duchess, even a <span class="floydstyle em">grand princess</span>,
 but she prefers countess. For the word's ring, I suppose."

>ferdinand

 "You're lucky to have Ferdinand on your side," says Dmitri. "The
 countess is formidable, but even she's as meek as a kitten in
 comparison. I can't <span class="floydstyle em">begin</span> to guess how many kills old
 Ferdinand must have under her belt. Of course it was all done in the
 line of duty, or whatever other nonsense people will say to try making
 it palatable. But facts are facts.

 "What does Ferdinand see in you, anyway? You're certainly not her peer
 in martial prowess, and not in social status either. I don't think you
 can claim to match her intellectual level. Maybe she keeps you around
 like a little pet dog. Am I in the right ballpark? You're like a shih
 tzu for her. Something she can take out every once in a while and play
 with and then put back into a kennel without feeling too guilty about
 it. Not that I think <span class="floydstyle em">she</span> can feel guilty about anything. She
 must have killed her conscience a long time ago. Probably her first
 victim.

 "Then again, perhaps I'm being too hard on her. I suppose life has
 taken its toll on Ferdinand just like everybody else. The difference
 is that not everybody else has a little pet shih tzu to distract
 themselves."

 <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> want is to know about <span class="floydstyle em">me</span> and Onegin, but
 there's nothing to tell about that either. There's nothing between us.

 "Of course I won't deny that I've fucked him, but he's just another
 notch in my bedpost. A handsome notch, but still a notch. Your problem
 is that you think he's such a bastard you can't fathom why I'd do it.
 And that is <span class="floydstyle em">your</span> problem, not mine. He might be a perfectly
 disagreeable character -- pompous, egomaniacal, even a little
 thick-skulled -- but that doesn't mean I can't have a good time with
 him. You see, the difference between us is that whereas <span class="floydstyle em">you</span>
 take everything much too personally, <span class="floydstyle em">I</span> just take things as
 they come. I've told you the same thing before, but did you listen to
 me? No. And you won't listen to me now. Forget about Onegin. Bury this
 ridiculous vendetta you have with him. It makes you look like a
 child."

 myself get angry over it. I'm not the one who needs to grow up. You

 just exist on the same planet. He barely even acknowledges that
 <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> exist. I can understand why there'd be no warmth between
 you, but this lust for blood you've got is something else entirely.
 It's pathetic is what it is."

 "It's hard for two people to really know each other, naturally, but
 I'm not talking about that deeper level. I'm talking about the
 surface, the little things that go into everyday life. Sometimes when
 I'm talking to you I feel like you're talking to someone else behind
 me. Like words leave your mouth and go over my head to this other
 person. And you seem satisfied with their response, whatever it is,
 because <span class="floydstyle em">I</span> don't give you a response. I can't. You don't hear
 me. But you don't want to, because you already think you know my
 answer. You've invented another me to suit yourself. Well, here I am
 now. I refuse to be that other person's shadow anymore."

 that I'm apologizing. If anyone deserves an apology, it's <span class="floydstyle em">me</span>
 for putting up with what I did. What I mean is that people will always
 be themselves. No matter how many masks they wear. No matter how many
 costumes. Trying to change them is the greatest fool's errand in the
 world. Do you know how much agonizing it took me to reach that
 conclusion? I kept trying to resist. I wanted to believe that if I
 pushed a little harder, said the right thing, used the rights words in
 the right combination, everything would change like winter into
 spring. I was an idiot. An absolutely blithering moron. I won't say
 that I'm smarter now, but I <span class="floydstyle em">am</span> more pragmatic. Nowadays I'm

 <span class="floydstyle em">endearing</span> snobbiness, if you know what I mean. She almost did
 it on purpose, adopted a character to poke fun at herself. Anyway, my
 point is that she had no enemies. Nobody could figure out a motive for
 why someone would want to kill her.

 "Everyone was shocked, of course, but no one took it worse than the
 countess. Those two had been great friends. You should've seen the
 countess out there bawling by the fountain. They had to pry the corpse
 away from her with a crowbar. Grief like that, you think that it only
 exists in novels, but then you see it firsthand and realize you never

 can't have people killing each other in an uncivilized manner."

 "Landscape gardens are bizarre," says Dmitri. "Some people build old
 towers in their gardens -- well, let me correct myself: they're
 designed to <span class="floydstyle em">look</span> old. They're called follies and they're
 absolutely useless. Uninhabitable, hollow shells for the most part.
 But they contribute to the garden's <span class="floydstyle em">picturesque</span> scenery,
 because who wouldn't want a romantic old pile in the corner?

 "Occasionally you'll even find fake hermits employed to live in these
 follies like wild men. That makes it more charming, to have a fake
 hermit living in a fake ruin. Who are the hermits? Poor people who
 need money. What is their job description? To sit around and never
 bathe and look contemplative. It's harder than it sounds. And if they
 make a mistake and do something as contemporary as trimming their hair
 or wearing shoes, why, then they aren't paid.

 "This palace's garden doesn't have a folly, thankfully."

 "Matilda, that poor girl," says Dmitri. "It's terrible what happened
 to her. Drowned in the fountain last year. She wasn't exactly an
 innocent lamb -- in fact, she was a spoiled brat -- always sticking
 her tongue out and snubbing her nose -- but it was an
 <span class="floydstyle em">endearing</span> snobbiness, if you know what I mean. She almost did
 it on purpose, adopted a character to poke fun at herself. Anyway, my
 point is that she had no enemies. Nobody could figure out a motive for
 why someone would want to kill her.

 "Everyone was shocked, of course, but no one took it worse than the
 countess. Those two had been great friends. You should've seen the
 countess out there bawling by the fountain. They had to pry the corpse
 away from her with a crowbar. Grief like that, you think that it only
 exists in novels, but then you see it firsthand and realize you never
 understood the world at all."

 "You saw us behind the polar bear, did you?" asks Dmitri. "I don't
 care. I have nothing to hide. I'll admit I'm a little annoyed that
 you'd sit there and watch like a voyeur, but I'm not going to let
 myself get angry over it. I'm not the one who needs to grow up. You
 are."

 "A cutlass is a standard enough sword," says Dmitri. "What makes
 Ferdinand's cutlass special is that it belongs to Ferdinand. That
 sword has glutted itself on more blood than I care to think about.
 It's something that someone would hang in a museum -- that admirers in
 future generations will undoubtedly handle like a sacred relic -- but
 in your hands it's no more dangerous than a stick. Still better than
 nothing, I guess."

 "The thing about a dueling rapier is that it hasn't got a good edge,"
 says Dmitri. "It requires a certain advanced talent to wield
 correctly, especially if you're wielding it with the intent to kill.
 But the countess shouldn't have any problems. She's a practiced
 duelist. When she goes for the throat, she gets the throat, and
 sometimes she takes the head too."

 "In olden times it was only the court fool who could speak
 uncensored," says Dmitri. "Everything a fool said was discredited
 simply because a fool had said it, which allowed these court fools to
 speak the truth disguised as nonsense. That's why you find your
 costume so appealing, isn't it? I know you well enough. But what you
 haven't considered is that any society that still needs fools to hide
 the truth in jokes must be repressed. It's only when fools are retired
 for good that we'll have actual freedom. In that light, your motley
 could almost be considered a symbol for oppression, couldn't it? So
 much for fun and games."

 "Identity is the greatest prison in the world," says Dmitri.
 "Everyone's trapped in their own. And while wearing a costume doesn't
 allow you to escape, it does make you forget for a while. But then the
 morning breaks and you see how your make-up is smeared and your hair's
 come undone and the diamonds in your rings are just rhinestones.
 You've spilled wine on yourself. You're hungover. That's the real you,
 and you don't want to look in the mirror at it."

 use for it, why, then of course it drags its feet worse than a convict
 with a ball and chain. Time's a contrarian, that's what it is. It

 "Don't tell me you don't know what a playscript is," says Dmitri.
 "It's something that's got everything written down -- scenes and stage
 directions and all that. Actors use them to memorize lines for plays.
 However, when they finally recite the lines they try to pretend that
 they're speaking spontaneously. That's what makes them actors."

 "I won't recite it again. You can read it for yourself," says Dmitri,

 <span class="floydstyle em">Sly Bertrand and Ratto in company sat </span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">before a fire to watch chestnuts roasting. </span>

>farewell

 Dmitri turns his attention back to his reading and his martini.

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aftermath</span>
 Splintered glasses, paper streamers, confetti, and cigarette butts
 litter the floor. You cannot step anywhere without crunching something
 underfoot. The banquet-table has been thoroughly demolished, cracked
 into two halves that lean inward toward a sunken middle.

 Everyone else is gone, but Dmitri is sitting at the table as though
 nothing has happened, reading a book and nursing a martini.

 Moving counter-clockwise would return you to the banquet hall when it
 was slightly more intact. Slightly.

>examine table

 Apparently the cherubs succeeded in smashing the banquet-table,
 although you don't know where they've gone now. Probably sucked back
 into another rift.

>cc


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Banquet Hall</span>
 Somehow a rift must have opened, because obese cherubs are pouring
 through the air onto the banquet-table; or at least, they would be
 pouring if they were in motion. There are several hundred, faces
 grimacing and feathered wings shedding blue pinions, and in their
 conglomerate they have impacted the table at one end, sending the
 other end skyward like a see-saw. Some even appear to be crawling
 upward along the table as rats would a mast aboard a sinking ship.

 This arrangement has naturally relocated the banquet itself into
 midair, where roasts and cakes and goblets and plates hang with their
 glazes and their silver sparkling.

 When it comes to the diners, most have already departed, although a
 few remain watching the cherubs with mild interest from seats pushed
 back against the walls. One lady dressed as a swan is eating angels on
 horseback, with a champagne flute daintily suspended in her other
 hand.

 A clockwise inclination would direct you into the aftermath, while
 moving counter-clockwise would steer you toward the cloak room, and in
 the future yawns the black salon.

>cc


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cloak Room</span>
 You find yourself lost in a forest. The trees are coat-stands draped
 with cloaks. Among the cloaks someone has hung a butchered pig
 carcass. Clockwise, the banquet awaits.

 In the past you can see the palace doors opened wide to the night.
 Guests are thronging through them to the masquerade, their stream
 bordered by footmen holding lanterns high, and foremost in this crowd
 is the countess.

 She is the jewel set in the evening's crown. Onegin has her hand, but
 she is not looking at him; she is looking at everybody, enchanting
 them with her smile. Her domino mask is lowered and you can see her
 face. She is more beautiful than anyone.

>examine pig

 This pig carcass has been expertly butchered, with the belly slit wide
 enough for a person to easily slip inside. As a costume, you must
 admit that the idea is genius.

>examine countess

 You are in love with the countess. There, you can admit it. When you
 look at her like this, you cannot help but be in love. Even though she
 loathes you and you've come to loathe her too. Even though she wants
 to fly your flayed hide for a flag. You are in love. It is horrible
 news. But you aren't alone, because <span class="floydstyle em">everyone</span> loves the
 countess. That's what makes her the countess.

>take pig

 You lift the pig carcass down. It's a bit unwieldy, but you'd rather
 leave a baby behind on a sinking ship than allow this opportunity to
 pass.

 You fly upward but the trees close overhead: their branches form a
 ceiling, and you're still inside the palace. You thump your head and
 flutter back down to the floor.

>examine trees

 These coat-stands haven't actually sprouted from the ground, but they
 might as well have.

>oink

 You oink with meaning.

>examine onegin

 Onegin, that bastard. He's strutting and puffing his chest, skin
 painted red from head to toe, wearing horns and bat-wings with his
 cock hanging out like some archfiend with nothing to hide. What an
 obnoxious exhibitionist. You'd think that the guests were all gazing
 at him from the grin on his face, but he's nothing next to the
 countess. He's just her pawn. He won't confess it to himself, but it's
 the truth.

>p


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">At the Threshold</span>
 The palace doors stand open, but no one has arrived yet.

 A landscape garden stretches away into the past.

 In the future, guests will deposit their cloaks in the cloak room.

>examine doors

 Whenever you are standing at a doorway, you never know if you are
 stepping in or stepping out. Divergent possibilities tug at you. You
 wonder whether you've made the right choice. But then you're stepping
 through the door and into whatever you're stepping into.

>examine garden

 This garden is where you will duel the countess at midnight.

>p


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landscape Garden</span>
 You are standing alone on a long manicured lawn bordered by cypress
 trees, whose moon-cast shadows divide the grass into neat quadrants as
 though it were a rugby field.

 Below the lawn, further into the past, there is a great and gurgling
 fountain, and in the future you can see the palace windows alive with
 candlelight and merriment.

>examine trees

 Columns in a colonnade -- that's what these cypress trees seem like.
 This garden is a temple and they gird its sacred space. That's what
 the landscape architect must have been thinking.

>examine moon

 There's a blue moon in the sky tonight. It looks just like a skull.
 You've known visions more reassuring.

>examine fountain

 Disaster seems to dog these masquerade parties. Last time it was
 Matilda that they found drowned in the fountain with her hair
 streaming around the water-lilies. Nobody could discover how it
 happened. This time it will be you that they find dead on the lawn,
 and everyone will know how it happened.

>p


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fountain</span>
 You gaze into the fountain's murky depths. Its water is stagnant and
 green from many years without cleaning, and unchecked lilies spill
 over its rim. Below its surface floats a drowned body.

 In the future you will stand alone in a landscape garden.

>examine body

 Before your eyes she rises from the fountain's sludge. Her skin is
 slick and green and semi-transparent like gelatin. You can see her
 dead organs inside, rotten, black, and her black veins running through
 her green body. Her hair drips down over her face. When she looks at
 you, her gaze is blank; she does not have pupils or irises, only
 whites as slimy as a dead frog's underbelly.

 She settles herself on the fountain's stone rim, dripping and
 drooping, her shoulders slouched.

 She waits.

>talk to body

 She cannot talk to you, although her tongue is swollen with unspoken
 words. Only the dead can commune with the dead.

>oink

 You oink with bravado.

 The drowned girl draws one finger across her throat. Well, she can
 just go join the club with everyone else who wants you dead tonight.

>fly

 You rise into the night sky and the garden and the palace and the
 world diminish underneath your hooves until they appear small enough
 to step on, but you don't step on them. You fly higher and higher
 until the atmosphere thins into nothing. Shooting stars are brushing
 past your cheeks. You can see little planets in the distance hanging
 like humid nightblue fruit dependent from the heaventree.

 But your goal is not that far away. You fly upward toward the moon
 until you are flying downward toward the moon, and then you alight on
 its lunar surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Moon</span>
 A cratered wasteland. Soft cheese squishes underneath your weight and
 smoke rises from foreboding chasms cleft into the glowing camembert.

 Before you a great beast is sprawled, slaughtered. It has been dead
 for eons and its form has decomposed to the bare bone. It is larger
 than any other animal, some colossus from legend, its death-grip
 encapsulating a lunar mountain over which it has collapsed.

 Into its forehead, in the exact spot at which a bindi would be
 applied, is plunged a gleaming vorpal blade.

>take camembert

 Acquiring cheese from the moon would not help you against the
 countess, would it? Unless perhaps she suffers from lactose
 intolerance, in which case you might slip the cheese... no, no, that's
 much too indirect.

>take blade

 You begin to climb the beast beginning at a nearby talon sunk into the
 moonscape. It is rather a large talon, perhaps one thousand meters
 (give or take), but luckily the talon is sloped, and soon enough you
 are standing atop a knuckle from which you can survey a considerable
 metacarpus extending toward an even more considerable radius and ulna.
 metacarpus extending toward an even more considerable radius and
 ulna.How awkward, mountaineering on a giant skeleton! Any footholds
 you find are porous holes in the bone. You have no gear to help. It is
 all desperate scrambling and split-second decisions. At one point you
 come across a crack in the humerus large enough to swallow a house.
 Thankfully you can flutter over it.
 At last you arrive at a wide scapula. Many hours have elapsed, and
 your own bones ache from the ascent. You determine to rest for the
 night.

 Well, it is not really a night. There aren't normal nights when you
 are on the moon, and besides, space/time is still bent into a pretzel.
 But the constellations turn and fireflies twinkle in the gloom.
 But the constellations turn and fireflies twinkle in the gloom.It is
 at this juncture that you notice a strange lowing. You peer over the
 scapula toward a crater in the mountainside below. Inside this crater
 are numerous creatures like cows, but they are larvae. They are
 embedded in the lunar cheese, which is dripping from some petrified
 organ still attached to the giant skeleton's pelvis.
 In the morning you begin to descend again along the cervical vertebrae
 attached to the skull. It is a descent, because the skeleton is
 slouched over the mountain with its head downward. That is how it must
 have fallen when it was slain.

 It was indeed slain. You can make no mistake about that.
 It was indeed slain. You can make no mistake about that.Finally you
 are scrambling over its cranium, and there in the bone is stuck the
 vorpal blade. Everything is eerie and quiet, and somehow it seems as
 though you have come to this spot by appointment. That you are not
 alone. That the vorpal blade is studying you as you are studying it.

 It occurs to you that the blade might be some keystone holding the
 situation together, and that by drawing it out you might reawaken the
 monster or trigger another unforeseen calamity. But you have
 determined to <span class="floydstyle i">take it</span>, and therefore you are going to <span class="floydstyle i">take</span>
 <span class="floydstyle i">it</span>.
 You grip the handle and you pull. The vorpal blade slides free as
 easily as a knife from butter -- or in this case, a sword from
 camembert.

 yours, and without delay you return to the moon's surface.

 Nothing is more dangerous than a vorpal blade. Even glancing at its
 edge threatens to slice your eyeballs open.

>examine beast

 Monsters like this should not exist. They are the fever dreams that
 hermits have in the desert. They dwell under the floorboards in the
 mind, and you can hear them scratching if you listen close enough. But
 somehow this one must have gotten out. It must have grown. You're glad
 that something killed it long ago.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landscape Garden</span>
 You are standing alone on a long manicured lawn bordered by cypress
 trees, whose moon-cast shadows divide the grass into neat quadrants as
 though it were a rugby field.

 Below the lawn, further into the past, there is a great and gurgling
 fountain, and in the future you can see the palace windows alive with
 candlelight and merriment.

>examine windows

 Black silhouettes are poised in the yellow palace windows, and even
 though they aren't moving they still convey some sense of happiness.
 It is like you are looking at puppets for a shadow-play, abandoned but
 still waiting to be animated.

>f


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">At the Threshold</span>
 The palace doors stand open, but no one has arrived yet.

 A landscape garden stretches away into the past.

 In the future, guests will deposit their cloaks in the cloak room.

>f


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cloak Room</span>
 You find yourself lost in a forest. The trees are coat-stands draped
 with cloaks. Clockwise, the banquet awaits.

 In the past you can see the palace doors opened wide to the night.
 Guests are thronging through them to the masquerade, their stream
 bordered by footmen holding lanterns high, and foremost in this crowd
 is the countess.

 She is the jewel set in the evening's crown. Onegin has her hand, but
 she is not looking at him; she is looking at everybody, enchanting
 them with her smile. Her domino mask is lowered and you can see her
 face. She is more beautiful than anyone.

>kiss countess

 You can't reach the countess without walking into the past.

>examine mask

 A domino mask fashioned entirely from pearls.

>examine footmen

 These footmen form a gauntlet that the guests are passing through,
 like statues lining a pathway. Their features are somehow both neutral
 and severe, statues indeed, and they are wearing silver-threaded
 livery. Their lower bodies dissolve into shadow because the light from
 their lanterns does not reach that far.

>examine cloaks

 In order to progress you have to push your passage through the cloaks.
 They are musky with perfume, cologne, and once you've advanced their
 folds close back behind you.

 That's not in the playscript.

 You are in love with the countess. There, you can admit it. When you

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Banquet Hall</span>
 Somehow a rift must have opened, because obese cherubs are pouring
 through the air onto the banquet-table; or at least, they would be
 pouring if they were in motion. There are several hundred, faces
 grimacing and feathered wings shedding blue pinions, and in their
 conglomerate they have impacted the table at one end, sending the
 other end skyward like a see-saw. Some even appear to be crawling
 upward along the table as rats would a mast aboard a sinking ship.

 This arrangement has naturally relocated the banquet itself into
 midair, where roasts and cakes and goblets and plates hang with their
 glazes and their silver sparkling.

 When it comes to the diners, most have already departed, although a
 few remain watching the cherubs with mild interest from seats pushed
 back against the walls. One lady dressed as a swan is eating angels on
 horseback, with a champagne flute daintily suspended in her other
 hand.

 A clockwise inclination would direct you into the aftermath, while
 moving counter-clockwise would steer you toward the cloak room, and in
 the future yawns the black salon.

>kiss swan

 Always better to peck a swan than to have a swan peck you.

>examine table

 It is a massive table that would seat at least a hundred were it not
 being upended by a cherub horde. Fortunately no one is sitting at the
 table. Everyone seems to have anticipated the interruption and moved
 away in time.

>c


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aftermath</span>
 Splintered glasses, paper streamers, confetti, and cigarette butts
 litter the floor. You cannot step anywhere without crunching something
 underfoot. The banquet-table has been thoroughly demolished, cracked
 into two halves that lean inward toward a sunken middle.

 Everyone else is gone, but Dmitri is sitting at the table as though
 nothing has happened, reading a book and nursing a martini.

 Moving counter-clockwise would return you to the banquet hall when it
 was slightly more intact. Slightly.

>kiss dmitri

 You steal a kiss from Dmitri and he promptly rubs his cheek to remove
 any residue left by your lips.

 "Just wonderful," he says. "<span class="floydstyle em">Exactly</span> what I needed. I must've
 been <span class="floydstyle em">begging</span> for that and I didn't even know it."

 like to hear his opinion about, or you could say <span class="floydstyle em">farewell</span>.

>vorpal blade

 "A vorpal blade isn't a real weapon," says Dmitri. "It's invented,
 imaginary, from a poem. The most relevant stanza goes:

 <span class="floydstyle em">"One, two! One, two! and through and through </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">the vorpal blade went snicker-snack! </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">He left it dead, and with its head </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">he went galumphing back.</span>

 "That's why a vorpal blade is so deadly, you understand. It can cut
 through anything simply <span class="floydstyle em">because</span> it doesn't exist. When
 something doesn't exist, there's nothing it can't do."

 "Supposedly people act more irrationally during a full moon," says
 Dmitri. "More accidents happen. More people are killed. It may be
 superstition, but the night sky is brighter with a full moon, isn't
 it? Therefore people stay awake later, and that provides a larger
 window for mishaps. The moon doesn't change anyone. They're just as
 irrational as always."

 Matilda? And the year before that, they found the duke's cousin hanged
 in the kitchen pantry. This year it's your turn apparently."

>pig

 "It's extraordinarily difficult to butcher a pig correctly," says
 Dmitri. "They're like lobsters in the sense that they ought to be kept
 alive until the last instant before they're eaten. To that end, many
 butchers have great nets in their shops where they keep the pigs
 contained beneath the ceiling, just as a balloon vendor would use a
 net to prevent their balloons from escaping. Then, whenever anyone
 asks for a pig, the butcher just has to pop back and grab one."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Black Salon</span>
 Black sable tapestries hang from the ceiling and walls, and black
 velvet carpets the floor. Scarlet radiance slants through scarlet
 windowpanes. An ebony grandfather clock has stopped keeping the time
 at one quarter to twelve.

 There is nobody here.

 Clockwise you will look behind a polar bear, and when you glance back
 toward the past you can see a celebration in the banquet hall where
 everyone has gathered to drink, feast, and make merry.

>examine radiance

 When you glance outside through the scarlet windowpanes you can see
 great tripods burning. Heretics writhe in their flames. It's a
 glorious <span class="floydstyle em">auto-da-fe</span>.

>examine bear


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Behind a Polar Bear</span>
 Dmitri's chest is pressed against the wall, arms overhead with his
 fingernails raking down the wallpaper. Onegin is straddling his rear,
 gripping his waist, paused mid-thrust with his cock halfway inside
 Dmitri's cunt -- or maybe halfway out?

 As the countess's minion, it is Onegin's duty to carry her weapon, and
 right now her rapier is resting nearby on the floor in an opened case.

 The polar bear itself is at least three meters tall, preserved
 taxidermically in a perpetual roar with claws outspread. Traveling
 counter-clockwise would reorient you toward the black salon, and the
 grand staircase is in your past.

>put kielbasa in case

 That can't contain things.

 You have multiple weapons you could swap with the rapier. In order to
 take the rapier, try dropping one of them.

 You drop the tremendous kielbasa into the opened case on the floor,

 Let's see how well the countess fights with <span class="floydstyle em">that</span> for a

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Grand Staircase</span>
 Ferdinand is leaning against a balustrade, her gaze cast toward the

 borrow later in your duel with the countess, is leaning against the
 balustrade beside her.

 The ballroom is in the past now, and in the future you will look
 behind a polar bear.

>drop blade

 You prop the vorpal blade against the balustrade and take Ferdinand's
 cutlass, and already you can taste imminent victory. With a vorpal
 blade at your disposal, even an amateur such as yourself will be
 unstoppable.

>undress

 You disrobe from your jester's motley and feel decidedly less
 tricksterish. You won't be stealing any kisses now.

 they are not dancing: they are staring at you and staring at the
 glove, and their eyeballs never cease staring because they are frozen.

 A chandelier hangs overhead, candles unflickering. Everything is

 after having delivered her challenge.

>examine dancers

 You cannot recognize anyone behind their masks. There is a jackal in a
 tailcoat, and a nymph with shellfish in her hair, and an enchantress
 with gold orbs for eyes, and someone with marzipan skin, and an alpine
 maiden with a shepherd's crook, and an antlered baron, and a raven in
 a judge's wig, and a sequined succubus, and other masqueraders more
 fantastic still, but the one thing they all have in common is that
 their frozen gazes are condemning you: Guilty, they seem to say,
 guilty.

 How did you ever get into this predicament? A rumor, a glove thrown
 down onto a dance-floor? Now you're standing in the moonlight and your
 knees are knocking together, although you hope that no one notices.
 You're still dressed for a masquerade and nothing feels quite real.
 Perhaps it isn't real... and all you need to do is <span class="floydstyle i">wake up</span> from
 this nightmare.

 The scene is set: landscape garden.

 The cast: your second, Ferdinand, handing your weapon over; your
 rival's second, Onegin, handing <span class="floydstyle em">her</span> weapon over; and your
 rival -- the countess.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">En garde!</span>" the countess cries.

>attack countess

 It only requires a thought and you are already moving, less from your
 own volition than from the blade's volition in your hand. It knows
 your wants and knows how to meet them, and suddenly you have leapt
 into the air and the countess is beneath you with her tremendous
 kielbasa lifted to deflect your blow.

 There is no deflection. Your vorpal blade slices through her weapon
 without any resistance. You cannot even feel the slice; your blade
 might as well have been passing through air.

 "Impossible," the countess says, but that is all she has the chance to
 say before you are kneeling on the ground at her feet. You are still
 holding the blade in your hand and now its edge is buried in the lawn
 beneath the countess, having taken a vertical route through her body.
 beneath the countess, having taken a vertical route through her body.
 She wobbles in place, reaching about with one hand as if for support,
 and then she takes a woozy step forward. Her bisected figure comes in
 half. One side slumps backward onto the lawn and the other continues
 standing upright, that disoriented hand still grasping in midair for
 nothing. It is almost as though she does not realize she is dead.

 You pull your vorpal blade skyward again, dislodging it from the lawn,
 and in the arc it makes it seems to shatter the countess. It draws her
 veins and tendons and her muscles along with it like a puppet yanked
 by strings, and she is not even a person anymore: she is a gory shower
 sprinkling across the garden. What remains where she once stood are
 only bones. They are quite bare. Vultures could not have picked them
 any cleaner.

 "Now <span class="floydstyle em">that</span>," says Ferdinand, "is how to win a duel."

>curtain
 A paleontologist, upon finding a cache filled with dinosaur bones, was
 pleased to discover that they formed a single specimen, a veritable
 monster. It went into the textbooks. Not until many years later did
 other paleontologists begin to poke at the bones and doubt this
 original configuration. They rearranged the bones into another
 specimen, and it went into the textbooks instead. Well, it happened
 again, with reconfiguration after reconfiguration, and new dinosaur
 after new dinosaur. The poor textbooks were panting to keep up.
 Finally the paleontologists were flustered enough to tromp back and
 examine the cache's location, which happened to be on a farmer's
 property. When they consulted the farmer about it, they were told it
 was a mass grave for chickens.

 This game has no optimal ending. It has certain elements (weapons,
 costumes) that can be reconfigured to produce more than twenty-five
 different outcomes. Some involve violence. Others do not. You can
 change what happens to suit your preferences.

>kill onegin

 The countess? The countess? Why should you fight the countess when
 that bastard Onegin is undoubtedly the mastermind behind this whole
 charade?

 You're overcome with outrage and you lunge toward Onegin, and when the
 countess tries to intercept you with her tremendous kielbasa, your
 vorpal blade slices through it.

 Nothing can intercept a vorpal blade.

 The countess cannot comprehend what has happened. She is staring at
 the severed stump left in her hand, but you've already finished your
 business. The same slice that went through her weapon also went
 through Onegin.
 through Onegin.
 He is looking at you in horror, and you can't blame him for that,
 although you don't feel sorry when his horrified head pops off his
 shoulders like a champagne cork. A bloody geyser rises from his neck
 and continues to rise for far longer than it has any right to do,
 scattering at its pinnacle into a scarlet shower that patters down
 over the garden. Warm droplets speckle your skin.

 The countess sinks onto her knees at the sight, her gown ballooning
 around her. Blood is still spouting, still raining from Onegin's
 standing corpse, and his head hasn't come back down yet.

 The countess says: "I surrender."

 You didn't even have to ask, and a good thing too, because you likely
 wouldn't have.

 When Onegin's head finally does land on the lawn, the countess faints.
 You can't blame her either.

 The countess is suddenly there, only inches away, but before she has
 the chance to strike with her tremendous kielbasa, your own sword
 rises to parry the blow. You did not even attempt to react; your
 vorpal blade did it for you.

 It also did much more than that. It has sliced her weapon in half,
 leaving the countess to stand there, stupefied, holding a severed
 sausage stump. She cannot process what has happened, and she never
 will.

 Your arm is moving here and there, zigzagging through the air, and
 <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> can barely process what is happening. But you know that
 you want it to happen. You know that it means you will win.

 When the vorpal blade has finished, your arm flicks it downward as an
 artist might flick down a brush to dislodge clinging paint. But there
 is nothing clinging to the blade. Its work was much too clean and
 quick.

 The countess is still poised before you, but she is not moving
 anymore. When she finally blinks, that is when thin red lines in a
 grid begin to manifest across her face, and then across her entire
 body, and without further ado she tumbles apart into neat little cubes
 expertly butchered. It is like watching a house of cards topple, with
 no structural support to hold anything together.

 You hear someone applauding: Ferdinand.

 You oink like a pig rooting for truffles, and the countess's fighting
 stance slackens. She looks at you with a new expression, as though she
 has just seen you for the first time, and then she begins looking to
 the left and right.

 "What's going on?" she demands. "Where did this pig come from?"

 Ferdinand and Onegin are also in apparent confusion, peering over
 their shoulders, glancing back toward the palace. Soon the countess
 has Onegin searching behind the cypress trees, behind the fountain,
 behind anything that might serve for a hiding spot, but you -- her
 rightful opponent -- are nowhere to be found.

 "How could you ever let this pig onto the grounds?" she is snapping at
 Onegin. "Aren't there meant to be protocols? Aren't guests meant to
 have invitations? And now look at me, standing here, about to duel a
 pig! Where's that silly jester gone? Go and find out now, and don't
 come back until you've brought the right person -- <span class="floydstyle em">person</span>

 Meanwhile Ferdinand has hooked you with a leash and is guiding you
 away from the garden.

 "Good move," she says when you're both alone in a little courtyard.
 "I'm glad that you finally took my advice and opted to escape rather
 than fight."

 You oink again. It won't do to break character now. But Ferdinand
 knows what you mean: Thank you for everything.

 "You're welcome," she replies. "Now we need to get you on a train
 bound somewhere far away. Eventually the countess will figure out what
 happened, and you won't want to be anywhere in the country when she
 does. The trick will be to put you someplace where they don't eat
 pork. You do make for a tasty-looking pig."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Stroke</span>
 How did you ever get into this predicament? A rumor, a glove thrown
 down onto a dance-floor? Now you're standing in the moonlight and your
 knees are knocking together, although you hope that no one notices.
 You're still dressed for a masquerade and nothing feels quite real.
 Perhaps it isn't real... and all you need to do is <span class="floydstyle i">wake up</span> from
 this nightmare.

 The scene is set: landscape garden.

 The cast: your second, Ferdinand, handing your weapon over; your
 rival's second, Onegin, handing <span class="floydstyle em">her</span> weapon over; and your
 rival -- the countess.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">En garde!</span>" the countess cries.

>kiss countess

 You cast aside your weapon. You cannot fight the countess. This feud
 is a mistake. Instead you walk across the lawn toward her.

 She must see it in your eyes. She must know how you feel. Perhaps she
 even has the same feelings?

 You take her hand -- the same hand that threw down that glove before
 -- and press it to your lips. Her breathing flutters; her chest
 heaves; she opens her mouth but she doesn't speak, and then her bones
 are water, she is melting in your arms, bent backward as you bend over
 to bind your breath with hers.

 Are those fireworks in the night sky above the palace? Are those
 tender violins playing? You feel her smile on your lips, her hands
 wrapping around your shoulders, and then you close your eyes.

 wrapping around your shoulders, and then you close your eyes.
 You open your eyes.
>push space
 You open your eyes.
 Something long and wet and spicy has just smacked your pate with a
 <span class="floydstyle em">thwap</span>, and you aren't embracing the countess at all. You're
 crouched on the ground and she's slapping you with a tremendous
 kielbasa.

 "Mongrel! Imbecile!" she is shouting. "You aren't fit to kiss my
 <span class="floydstyle em">feet</span>!"

 The truth is that you didn't even make it to her feet before she
 started clobbering you, and you remain huddled in a ball until she's
 through venting her wrath. Then she drops the kielbasa and stalks back
 into the palace with Onegin following.

 "I don't know what that was," says Ferdinand. "You certainly did take
 a beating tonight, but to call it a duel? At least the countess now
 seems satisfied. You have the most peculiar luck, I swear."

>kiss onegin

 What are you doing out here fighting a duel? You came to this
 masquerade party for one reason and one reason only: to steal kisses
 from people.

 You cast aside your weapon and lunge toward that bastard Onegin,
 seizing his cheeks and then planting your lips against his before he
 can resist. You are falling with him -- he is falling backward,
 toppled by your impact -- and you land on the lawn in a heap together.
 Limbs tangled. Bodies writhing. Chests heaving with passion.

 Passion isn't always romantic.
 Passion isn't always romantic.
 You can feel and hear a <span class="floydstyle em">thwap</span> against your back: the countess
 is standing nearby, throttling you with a tremendous kielbasa. But it
 doesn't matter. Your feud has always been with Onegin, and as you look
 into his furious eyes your kiss deepens.

 Finally he musters the strength and self-possession to shove you away,
 but you only dart back and peck his shoulders, his legs, his feet as
 he attempts to flee. You are chasing him in circles around the garden
 and he's cursing you as the countess pursues you both with her
 kielbasa.

 You won't stop, not for him and not for her. They wanted blood but you
 gave them nonsense instead, and now they'll have to live with it.

 That's what they get for fighting with a fool!

>attack script

 You take out your playscript and tear it in half. Who wrote these
 scenes? They make no sense. You won't perform this dreck. Instead you
 toss the script into the wind and its sheets blow across the garden.

 "What are you doing?" says the countess. "Come back here!"

 You don't come back. You're walking away from this production. They
 can find someone else to play your role if the duel is that important
 because, frankly, you don't understand a thing.
 because, frankly, you don't understand a thing.
 You didn't know what you were getting into, but you didn't know it
 would be this. It almost feels like there's a conspiracy against you.
 Well, of course there is: you're supposed to be <span class="floydstyle em">killed</span>, after
 all.

 That's not going to happen. Not if you don't say your lines. Not if
 you don't play along.

 Let them boo and complain. Let them throw rotten fruit. Let them fill
 the newspapers with scathing reviews. Let them call you a prima donna.

 You are going to live. That's what counts.

>kiss script

 You press your lips against your playscript. Oh, what a blessing and
 torment its words are tonight! Sometimes you wish you could rip it in
 half, and sometimes you cherish its lines. It's just too bad that
 bastard Onegin gets to play a part.

 The countess is suddenly there, only inches away, but before she has
 the chance to strike with her tremendous kielbasa, your own sword
 rises to parry the blow. You did not even attempt to react; your
 vorpal blade did it for you.

 It also did much more than that. It has sliced her weapon in half,
 leaving the countess to stand there, stupefied, holding a severed
 sausage stump. She cannot process what has happened, and she never
 will.
 will.
 Your arm is moving here and there, zigzagging through the air, and
 <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> can barely process what is happening. But you know that
 you want it to happen. You know that it means you will win.

 When the vorpal blade has finished, your arm flicks it downward as an
 artist might flick down a brush to dislodge clinging paint. But there
 is nothing clinging to the blade. Its work was much too clean and
 quick.

 The countess is still poised before you, but she is not moving
 anymore. When she finally blinks, that is when thin red lines in a
 grid begin to manifest across her face, and then across her entire
 body, and without further ado she tumbles apart into neat little cubes
 expertly butchered. It is like watching a house of cards topple, with
 no structural support to hold anything together.

 You hear someone applauding: Ferdinand.

 "Bravo!" she says. "Bravo! I couldn't have done any better myself."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Ballroom</span>
 On the floor you can see a white glove where it has been
 contemptuously thrown down, and expanding outward from this glove the
 world takes form. There are dancers surrounding you in a circle, but
 they are not dancing: they are staring at you and staring at the
 glove, and their eyeballs never cease staring because they are frozen.

 There has been some hitch and time stands still.

 A chandelier hangs overhead, candles unflickering. Everything is
 mirrored in the marble floor. Toward the future you can glimpse the
 grand staircase, where the countess is ascending with her back turned
 after having delivered her challenge.

 Ferdinand is leaning against a balustrade, her gaze cast toward the

 will borrow later in your duel with the countess, is leaning against
 the balustrade beside her.

 The ballroom is in the past now, and in the future you will look

 You are carrying a pig carcass, a rapier, a cutlass, and a playscript,
 and you are wearing motley.

 Dmitri's chest is pressed against the wall, arms overhead with his

 Dmitri's cunt -- or maybe halfway out?

 As the countess's minion, it is Onegin's duty to carry her weapon, and
 right now her tremendous kielbasa is resting nearby on the floor in an
 opened case.

 The polar bear itself is at least three meters tall, preserved
 taxidermically in a perpetual roar with claws outspread. Traveling
 counter-clockwise would reorient you toward the black salon, and the

 Before the countess has the chance to strike, you lunge in the last
 direction that anyone would expect: toward your own second, Ferdinand.

 Your tremendous kielbasa is raised overhead like an axe, but before
 <span class="floydstyle em">you</span> have the chance to strike, Ferdinand has seized your
 wrist, her knee is in your gut, and you've dropped your weapon on the
 lawn. You're doubled over in anguish, and then you feel and hear a
 <span class="floydstyle em">thwap</span> and then another <span class="floydstyle em">thwap</span>, because Ferdinand has
 appropriated the kielbasa and is smacking you relentlessly with it.

 "Down, dog!" she barks. "You mangy cur! I've never seen such
 disrespect! Attacking your own ally! Have you lost your mind?"

 The countess and Onegin can only stare as Ferdinand chases you across
 the garden, slapping you with the tremendous kielbasa at every step.
 Finally you collapse, but she just grabs your ankle and prepares to
 drag you away.
 drag you away.
 "I hope you understand that the duel's off," she tells the countess.
 "I'm not releasing this traitor until I've delivered my own
 retribution, and believe me, it will be significant."

 "I don't blame you," says the countess. "By all means."

 But when Ferdinand has pulled you a considerable distance into a
 little courtyard and you two are alone, she releases you and laughs.

 "It worked!" she says. "In a million years I never thought it would,
 but you were right!"

 You can't help but think that she might have overplayed her role in
 the plan, but you're in no position to grumble. You are alive, and
 soon you are laughing along with Ferdinand.

 "You may not be a warrior," she says, "but when it comes to nonsense
 you're a champion."

 Black sable tapestries hang from the ceiling and walls, and black
 velvet carpets the floor. Scarlet radiance slants through scarlet

 at one quarter to twelve.

 There is nobody here.

 Clockwise you will look behind a polar bear, and when you glance back

 Two long cast-iron hands mark the time at one quarter to twelve.

 When you remove the cast-iron hands from the clock-face, they coil and

 In one corner slouches the Red Death.

>examine death

 Garbed in the grave's dirt-bedraggled and worm-eaten habiliments, the
 Red Death couldn't look more like a corpse if it were displayed on a
 bier. Crimson drops bead from every pore in its flesh, and the bags
 beneath its eyes have drooped to expose whites thoroughly bloodshot.

 "It's difficult to explain," says the Red Death. "I'd intended to make
 my debut here at midnight, on the very stroke. But for some reason I
 just <span class="floydstyle em">cannot</span> put my finger on the time this evening. Is it
 twelve o'clock, or isn't it? Has the hour struck already, or hasn't

 first time I ruined a masque ball, I did it promptly at midnight, and
 it was a rousing success -- as gruesome as you please! You should have
 seen them running down the halls in such a pandemonium. They didn't
 know who they'd invited to the party! Although they hadn't
 <span class="floydstyle em">invited</span> me precisely. But in any event, since then it has
 become a tradition for me to make my appearance at midnight. I
 wouldn't have it any other way."

 You have no reason to remove these tapestries from this salon, but

 not an arras anywhere. Then you might've found a dead counselor or
 something.

 "I always check behind tapestries too," says the Red Death. "In case
 someone's trying to hide from me. I don't allow that."

>when

 "At midnight, of course," says the Red Death. "However, if you meant
 to ask about the date or the month or the year or even the century,
 then I haven't the foggiest idea. Trifles like that tend to slip
 through my mind like a sieve. What pointless details! I've never been
 able to figure out why people are so obsessed with calendars. When

 "Oh, I remember who, certainly," says the Red Death. "She was a
 marquise with a penchant for tormenting chimpanzees. She would buy
 them in great quantities from local zoos and then subject them to
 electric plates. On the night that I made my appearance, a guillotine
 had been erected in order that each party guest might try pulling the
 lever and decapitating their own ape. The irony is that only people
 are susceptible to my disease and, when I was through, the surviving
 chimpanzees had their own party with the corpses. They put the
 marquise under the guillotine a few times before that evening ended!"

>what

 "I'm here in my usual role as plague-bearer," says the Red Death.
 "It's my duty, you see, to travel about the countryside and lay waste
 to whatever civilizations fall within my pathogenic purview. To be
 honest, it grows a tad dull once you've been at the job for as long as
 I have. You've always got your bleeding and your lesions and your
 vomit. Throw in a few thousand rats here and there, some mass graves,
 some plague-doctors, and every programme runs about the same."

 The Red Death suppresses a yawn with one hand.

 "That's why I like dropping in on masque balls from time to time. An
 extravagant setting tends to generate more extravagant horror. It's
 more entertaining for me to watch, although I suppose that it's just
 as miserable for the participants no matter what."

 You have a few lines you could recite.

>what

 "Rumor? What rumor?" asks the Red Death.

 You explain all about the rumor.

 "Well, when you put it like that," says the Red Death, "I should have
 to conclude that you're the victimized party. However, since you're
 <span class="floydstyle em">also</span> the one telling me this story, your account may be
 biased. I'm afraid I can't give my opinion, except to agree that
 Onegin does sound like a bastard."

>what

 "I would do what I always do," says the Red Death. "The answer to
 everything is wholesale slaughter. You cannot balk at the countess's
 challenge. You must throw it back into her face with enough force to
 bury her six feet underneath the nearest cemetery plot. And ideally in
 a bloody, unrecognizable mess."

 You have a few lines you could recite.

 Scratching its chin for a moment, the Red Death considers your
 proposition.

 "You know, it's not a halfway bad notion. I'm in a pickle myself, what
 with the hours having gone all sideways this evening, but your duel is
 scheduled for midnight precisely. If I were to pass on my mantle, so
 to speak, then you would know just when to start the ball rolling --
 and no one, please let me reassure you, survives against my contagion.
 Your countess wouldn't stand a chance."

 A ghastly smile creeps across the Red Death's face, running from ear
 to ear just like a glasgow souvenir.

 "All right," it says. "You've got yourself a deal. But remember: only
 start infecting people on the stroke!"

 Suddenly its graveclothes are empty, and after an odd hesitation they
 crumple to the carpet, leaving you alone once more with only the
 hourless grandfather clock.

 Somehow a rift must have opened, because obese cherubs are pouring
 through the air onto the banquet-table; or at least, they would be
 pouring if they were in motion. There are several hundred, faces
 grimacing and feathered wings shedding red pinions, and in their
 conglomerate they have impacted the table at one end, sending the
 other end skyward like a see-saw. Some even appear to be crawling
 upward along the table as rats would a mast aboard a sinking ship.

 This arrangement has naturally relocated the banquet itself into
 midair, where roasts and cakes and goblets and plates hang with their
 glazes and their copper sparkling.

 When it comes to the diners, most have already departed, although a
 few remain watching the cherubs with mild interest from seats pushed
 back against the walls. One lady dressed as a swan is eating angels on
 horseback, with a champagne flute daintily suspended in her other
 hand.

 A clockwise inclination would direct you into the aftermath, while
 moving counter-clockwise would steer you toward the cloak room, and in

 Splintered glasses, paper streamers, confetti, and cigarette butts
 litter the floor. You cannot step anywhere without crunching something
 underfoot. The banquet-table has been thoroughly demolished, cracked
 into two halves that lean inward toward a sunken middle.

 Everyone else is gone, but Dmitri is sitting at the table as though
 nothing has happened, reading a book and nursing a martini.

 Moving counter-clockwise would return you to the banquet hall when it
 was slightly more intact. Slightly.

 few remain watching the cherubs with mild interest from seats pushed
 back against the walls. One lady dressed as a swan is eating angels on
 horseback, with a champagne flute daintily suspended in her other
 hand.

 A clockwise inclination would direct you into the aftermath, while
 moving counter-clockwise would steer you toward the cloak room, and in
 the future yawns the red salon.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Cloak Room</span>
 You find yourself lost in a forest. The trees are coat-stands draped
 with cloaks. Clockwise, the banquet awaits.

 In the past you can see the palace doors opened wide to the night.
 Guests are thronging through them to the masquerade, their stream
 bordered by footmen holding lanterns high, and foremost in this crowd
 is the countess.

 She is the jewel set in the evening's crown. Onegin has her hand, but
 she is not looking at him; she is looking at everybody, enchanting
 them with her smile. Her domino mask is lowered and you can see her
 face. She is more beautiful than anyone.

>p


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">At the Threshold</span>
 The palace doors stand open, but no one has arrived yet.

 A landscape garden stretches away into the past.

 In the future, guests will deposit their cloaks in the cloak room.

>p


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Landscape Garden</span>
 You are standing alone on a long manicured lawn bordered by cypress
 trees, whose moon-cast shadows divide the grass into neat quadrants as
 though it were a rugby field.

 Below the lawn, further into the past, there is a great and gurgling
 fountain, and in the future you can see the palace windows alive with
 candlelight and merriment.

>p


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fountain</span>
 You gaze into the fountain's murky depths. It is stagnant and red with
 thickened blood, and unchecked lilies spill over its rim, on which a
 dead girl is sitting.

 In the future you will stand alone in a landscape garden.

>examine girl

 Her skin is peeled away and you can see her crimson muscles stretched
 and woven on her bones. Her red veins are pumping with blood and her
 red heart contracting inside her ribcage. Her face is framed with
 flaming hair. When she looks at you, her eyes are two embers; they
 burn through you as though you were paper.

 You peel away the blood-speckled graveclothes and the world feels less

 You hunch your shoulders together and crawl into the pig carcass. Now
 the sky is no longer a limit.

>fly

 You rise into the night sky and the garden and the palace and the
 world diminish underneath your hooves until they appear small enough
 to step on, but you don't step on them. You fly higher and higher
 until the atmosphere thins into nothing. Shooting stars are brushing
 past your cheeks. You can see little planets in the distance hanging
 like humid nightblue fruit dependent from the heaventree.

 But your goal is not that far away. You fly upward toward the moon
 until you are flying downward toward the moon, and then you alight on
 its lunar surface.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Moon</span>
 A cratered wasteland. Soft cheese squishes underneath your weight and
 smoke rises from foreboding chasms cleft into the glowing camembert.

 Before you a great beast is sprawled, slaughtered. It has been dead
 for eons and its form has decomposed to the bare bone. It is larger
 than any other animal, some colossus from legend, its death-grip
 encapsulating a lunar mountain over which it has collapsed.

>undress

 You clamber out from the pig carcass. Now the sky is once more is the
 limit.

>wear graveclothes

 As you shuffle into the graveclothes, a strange malevolence steals
 over the scenery; or perhaps you yourself have become that strange
 malevolence. Your fingertips drip with infection.

>talk to giant

 This beast has probably been dead for more millennia than humankind
 has known the spoken word. Its bones aren't going to shake off the
 dust and have a conversation anytime soon.

 You're already wearing the graveclothes.

 You are carrying graveclothes, a pig carcass, a vorpal blade, a
 rapier, and a playscript, and you are wearing motley.

>kiss rapier

 You consider kissing the countess's rapier, but the farther you keep
 it away from your head, the safer you'll probably feel.

>kiss vorpal

 You press your lips against the vorpal blade. It is sharp and cold and
 clean like some instrument sanitized for surgery. You can taste its
 sharpness and its sharpness is cutting cleanly and coldly your lips,
 your tongue, your skin, your bone. Even the blood running down your
 throat is clean and cold. The blade is passing through you, or perhaps
 you are passing through it, but in either case it has opened the
 world. That world is peeling away on either side, sliced vertically
 like an opening through a curtain, until you can see dark leaves
 overhead and smell dark earth and hear branches bending and snapping.
 overhead and smell dark earth and hear branches bending and snapping.
 You are in a dark woodland clearing, the vorpal blade shining in your
 hand although the forest light is weak. It must be shining from
 within. Against your back you can feel bark. You are resting against a
 tumtum tree. At some distance there is a sundial, old and mossy and
 hourless in the gloom, standing solitary on a grass plot riddled with
 abandoned burrows.

 You are not alone in the forest. Something is whiffling among the
 trees and you struggle to recall a warning someone gave you about this
 situation, but your uffish thoughts cannot remember the words. You
 have the vague sensation that you ought to be at home, preparing to
 broil your dinner, rather than waiting out here for whatever is
 advancing through the trees.

 Nothing is clear anymore, but <span class="floydstyle em">someone</span> is supposed to kill
 <span class="floydstyle em">something</span>, at any rate. And yet now that you think about it,
 nothing was ever clear in the first place.

 Its eyes are aflame and it burbles as it comes, its jaws biting, its
 claws catching. At least this creature isn't a countess.

 She drops her cutlass on the lawn.

 After a moment, blood wells from under her domino mask, scarlet rivers
 running down her cheeks. She lifts a hand to pull the mask away but it
 doesn't come away. It is stuck, and when she pulls harder there is a
 ripping sound. She cannot see what she has done, but around her eyes
 the skin has erupted with bubbling lesions like frog-eggs or caviar.
 the skin has erupted with bubbling lesions like frog-eggs or caviar.
 Now she is screaming. She sees her bloody hands. She knows that she is
 horribly broken. Meanwhile more blood is pouring from her every pore,
 drenching her gown, drenching the grass around her. Her body is
 melting into blood, her shape dissolving into it, until she is a
 shrieking heap upon the ground

 Her shrieks are in the wind. Around the garden cypresses rustle and
 the fountain plashes as both seconds fall, bleeding with her. It is a
 comprehensive plague.

 In the palace guests are falling too. Their shadows are erratic in the
 candlelit windows. You cannot picture them as real people. They are
 puppets and their strings have just been cut. It is a pandemonium, but
 it will all be over soon enough. It will end when the last reveler
 falls in the blood-bedewed halls, when the last screams are carried
 away by the breeze, when the candles blink out one by one as they
 gutter in wax.

 And then darkness and decay and the Red Death will hold illimitable
 dominion over all.

 eyeballs never cease staring because they are frozen.

 There has been some hitch and time stands still.

 after having delivered her challenge.

 freeze a beating heart, and thirty more when Kappiataitok emerged to
 find his glacial sanctum populous with infidels. They could not

 thirty more were dead before the king rose with a roar and broke away
 across the floes. But he had been wounded in the ankle and could not

 he fell beneath the aurora and never woke into this world again.

 In the palace guests are falling too. Their shadows are erratic in the
 candlelit windows. You cannot picture them as real people. They are
 puppets and their strings have just been cut. It is a pandemonium, but
 it will all be over soon enough. It will end when the last reveler
 falls in the blood-bedewed halls, when the last screams are carried
 away by the breeze, when the candles blink out one by one as they
 gutter in wax.

 And then darkness and decay and the Red Death will hold illimitable
 dominion over all.

 <span class="floydstyle em">A corpse engages a countess in a swordfight </span>

 The countess is suddenly there, only inches away, and her cutlass
 slices through your kielbasa and sinks promptly into your neck with a
 horrible crunch. Those were vertebrae, weren't they?

 Bringing a sausage to a swordfight was the last mistake you'll ever
 make.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the Stroke</span>
 How did you ever get into this predicament? A rumor, a glove thrown
 down onto a dance-floor? Now you're standing in the moonlight and your
 knees are knocking together, although you hope that no one notices.
 You're still dressed for a masquerade and nothing feels quite real.
 Perhaps it isn't real... and all you need to do is <span class="floydstyle i">wake up</span> from
 this nightmare.

 The scene is set: landscape garden.

 The cast: your second, Ferdinand, handing your weapon over; your
 rival's second, Onegin, handing <span class="floydstyle em">her</span> weapon over; and your
 rival -- the countess.

 "<span class="floydstyle em">En garde!</span>" the countess cries.

 You squint but can't see that.

>examine weapon

 (your weapon)
 You're wielding a tremendous kielbasa. It's a joke, of course, because
 you'll have just as much luck with this kielbasa for a weapon as you
 would with a sword. The countess is going to absolutely slaughter you
 tonight.

 She is suddenly there, only inches away, and her cutlass slices
 through your kielbasa and sinks promptly into your neck with a
 horrible crunch. Those were vertebrae, weren't they?

>examine countess's weapon

 Through some twist in fate, the countess is wielding a cutlass
 tonight. Perhaps it's not her typical rapier, but she's just as
 dangerous with any blade.

 She is suddenly there, only inches away, and her cutlass slices
 through your kielbasa and sinks promptly into your neck with a
 horrible crunch. Those were vertebrae, weren't they?
