 Rain and mud.

 Those are your first solid memories.  Rain pouring down on your head,
 filling your eyes.  Mud beneath your feet, filling your shoes.  Other
 details slowly filter in.  The trees surrounding you.  The leaden skies
 above.  The chill wind cutting through your clothes with ease.

 Shelter would be a good beginning.

 "Rain rain on my face/It hasn't stopped raining for days"
                             -- Jars of Clay


 Muddy Glade
    The trees around you are spaced far enough to provide little
 shelter, allowing the stinging rain to pelt you.  A grey mist conceals
 everything past four meters.

>examine me
 What you can see of yourself is familiar.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>examine trees
 Mostly pine.  Their protection is scant comfort in the rain and the
 wind.

>go east
 You strike off in that direction, but soon become disoriented by the
 rain.

 Muddy Field
    Once the field might have been covered in grass.  Now the grass is
 but a memory.  Mud covers the ground in its place, fed by the constant
 rain.
    Buried almost to its chin in the mud is a human head.

 The head's eyes suddenly open, fixing you in place.  "Oh, my," he says.
 "This is a surprise.  I certainly never expected to see you in person!"

>examine head
 Other than being buried in mud to his chin, the head is reassuringly
 normal.  His hair and mustache are a matted brown, perhaps from
 genetics, perhaps from mud.  Rivulets of water run down his creased
 face.

 "Come to gloat?" the man says.  "Why not?  After all, you put me here."

>ask head about head
 "What's to say?" he asks.  "I've led a dull life, and now I'm about to
 have a dull end."

 "That's right, try to deny it.  If it weren't for you, I'd still be
 safe."  His eyes dart to the northeast for a second, then return to
 you.

>dig mud
 You kneel and begin scooping mud from around the head with both hands.
 As fast as you remove the mud, more mud and water return.  "Forget it,"
 the man says gruffly.  "It's too late now."  He seems strangely touched
 by your attempt, however.

 The man laughs softly.  "Not long now."  He grins sarcastically.  "An
 interesting end, don't you think?  Jiminy Cricket never had such an
 exit scene."

>kick head
 The head's eyes widen as you draw your foot back.  "Terry, no, please,
 oh God you can't--" His cries are cut short as your foot slams into
 him.  With the sound of eggshells cracking, the head fragments into
 countless pieces which are quickly lost in the mud.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Muddy Field
    Once the field might have been covered in grass.  Now the grass is
 but a memory.  Mud covers the ground in its place, fed by the constant
 rain.
    Buried almost to its chin in the mud is a human head.

>zyzzy
 I don't know the word "zyzzy".

>xyzzy
 There is a puff of smoke.  Something lands in your hands.

 Resignation and more than a little bitterness fill the man's face.  "Go
 on," he says.  "You've work to do, pieces to recover."  He pauses, then
 yells, "Go on, I said!"  Then, muttered, "You've ignored me too long to
 do anything about it now."

>inventory
 You have a fool.

>examine fool
 A tiny doll tricked out in a harlequin's outfit.  When you turn it over
 in your hands, you see that its back is missing, leaving the fool
 hollow.  There is a matching hole where its larynx should be.

>put hand in puppet
 I don't know the word "puppet".

>take head
 You grab hold of his ears, but before you can pull, the head says,
 "It's no good now.  I'm done for."  His eyes narrow at you.  "The least
 you can do is feel guilty."

>ignore head
 I don't know the word "ignore".

>eat fool
 The fool doesn't appear appetizing.

>feel guilty
 I don't know the word "guilty".

>put hand in fool
 I don't see any hand here.

>ask head about himself
 "What's to say?" he asks.  "I've led a dull life, and now I'm about to
 have a dull end."

>ask head about me
 The man laughs.  "Funny, I've spent my life judging you, and now I
 can't think of a thing to say about you."

>ask head about mud
 He says, "If only the rain would stop..."

>ask head about rain
 He says, "If only the rain would stop..."

>ask head about life
 There is no reply.

>ask head about death
 There is no reply.

>dig
 What do you want to dig in?

>stop rain
 Don't worry about the rain.

>dig mud
 You kneel and begin scooping mud from around the head with both hands.
 As fast as you remove the mud, more mud and water return.  "Forget it,"
 the man says gruffly.  "It's too late now."  He seems strangely touched
 by your attempt, however.

>again
 You kneel and begin scooping mud from around the head with both hands.
 As fast as you remove the mud, more mud and water return.  "Forget it,"
 the man says gruffly.  "It's too late now."  He seems strangely touched
 by your attempt, however.

>again
 You kneel and begin scooping mud from around the head with both hands.
 As fast as you remove the mud, more mud and water return.  "Forget it,"
 the man says gruffly.  "It's too late now."  He seems strangely touched
 by your attempt, however.

>again

 As fast as you remove the mud, more mud and water return.  "Forget it,"
 the man says gruffly.  "It's too late now."  He seems strangely touched
 by your attempt, however.

>bury head
 I don't know the word "bury".

>put mud on head
 You can't put the mud anywhere.

>search head
 How rude!

>kiss head
 The mud coating him makes you think twice.

>clean head
 No matter how much you wipe, the man's face is still begrimed.  He
 grimaces.  "Thanks," he says.

>go northeast
 "Good luck," the man whispers as you walk away.  The hiss of the rain
 covers anything else he might have said.

 Front of Building
    Looming suddenly out of the gloom is a large marble building.  Its
 columns jut skyward, raked by the unending rain.  To the north lies its
 entrance.

>examine building
 The building's white marble is streaked with grime, the rain having no
 visible effect.  Its entrance lies open to the north.

>go north
 As you walk through the door of the building the sound of the rain
 stops, as if suddenly turned off.

 Foyer
    The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north.  On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway.  The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

>go north
 South End of Hallway
    Like the foyer, the hallway is marble.  Its two-story height
 combined with its thinness inspires unease.  A walkway runs above you,
 clinging to the east and west walls.  Below the east walkway is a
 doorway.

>go north
 North End of Hallway
    The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors.  Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you.  The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest.  A doorway to the east is mirrored by a
 closed door to the west.

>go north
 Audience Hall
    Your footsteps echo hollowly in the dimly-lit and cavernous hall.
 Benches line the floor, their rows skewed slightly to focus on the desk
 at the north end.  A clock is set in the wall in plain view of the
 desk.  The south third of the room is covered by a balcony, reducing
 the height of the hall from two stories to one.  A small door to the
 east and two large doors to the south stand ajar.  To one side of the
 two doors is a light switch.

>go north
 You can't go that way.

>go south
 North End of Hallway
    The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors.  Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you.  The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest.  A doorway to the east is mirrored by a
 closed door to the west.

>go south
 South End of Hallway

>go south
 Foyer
    The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north.  On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway.  The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.
    Tracked across the marble floor are muddy footprints.

 A section of the air just above your head shimmers.  A small pyramid
 falls from the disturbance to the ground below.

>go south
 Front of Building
    You can see little through the glare of sun on snow.  The building
 to the north is just visible, but everything else is a wash of bright
 white.

 You begin to feel the cold seep into you, chilling you.

>go north
 Foyer
    The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north.  On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway.  The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.
    Tracked across the marble floor are muddy footprints.
    You see a paper pyramid here.

 You now feel recovered from your exposure to the cold.

>get pyramid
 The pyramid begins glowing softly.  It unfolds like a flower and a
 feminine voice issues from it, saying, "Doctor!  Doctor!  Something's
 wrong with Terry!" When the light dies down, the pyramid is gone.

>go northwest
 Cramped Office
    Shadows crowd the room, strengthened by the unlit ceiling light
 which is canted at a strange angle.  A scarred mahogany desk is crammed
 into one corner of the room, facing the doorway and the clock above it.
 The room is small enough that the light switch beside the door is
 within arms reach of the desk.

 into one corner of the room, facing the doorway and the clock above it.
 The room is small enough that the light switch beside the door is
 within arms reach of the desk.

>examine desk
 The dark wood of the desk only serves to make the office more
 claustrophobic.  Deep gouges run from the front of the desk to the
 back; close examination shows them to be fingernail-shaped.  All of the
 desk drawers have been removed.

>examine gouges
 Gouges scar the once-pristine surface of the desk.

>examine drawers
 I don't see any drawers here.

>exits
 You can go southeast.

>examine switch
 The switch is currently off.

>turn on light
 You turn on the switch, but nothing happens.

 A white-faced clock with numbers and black hands, hands which stand
 frozen at 2:59.

 closed door to the west.

>examine doors
 small door:  The closed door leads west.
 large wooden doors:  The carved doors are made of oak and are twice
 your height.  They stand slightly ajar, leaving enough room for you to
 enter.

>examine carvings
 You peer closely at the door, but are unable to tell what the carving
 is of in the dim light.

>fouch carvings
 I don't know the word "fouch".

>touch carvings
 The carving is distinct beneath your fingers, yet its subject remains
 tantalizingly unobvious.

>go east
 North Half of Archive
    Metal shelves fill the hall; most are empty and many have succumbed
 to rust. The shelves that aren't empty hold broken shards of glass.
 The archive continues to the south, and an exit leads west.

>examine glass
 The glass fragments run the gamut from large shards to fine, gritty
 powder.

>take glass
 You would most surely cut yourself.

>search glass
 You find nothing of interest.

>examine shelves
 The shelves cover the room, as if they had multiplied in the same
 manner coathangers are reputed to.  They are covered in broken shards.

>climb shelves
 Don't worry about the metal shelves.

>go south
 South Half of Archive
    Just enough light filters in to show you row after row of boxes
 filling rack after rack of shelves, making it difficult to find a place
 to stand.  The room continues to the north.  Above the west exit is a
 clock; beside the exit is a light switch.

>exits
 You can go north and west.

>clockk

 A white-faced clock with numbers and black hands, hands which stand
 frozen at 2:25.

 Cardboard boxes, all taped shut.  Each one has been labeled with a
 black magic marker.

>open box 225
 I don't see any box 225 here.

>examine labels
 I don't see any labels here.

>read boxes
 Your eyes roam over their surfaces, taking in their titles.  Many are
 labeled "Memories" with a range of dates following.  A few are labeled
 "Fragments."  You feel an odd sense of disorientation as you stare at
 them.

>open fragments
 I don't know the word "fragments".

>open boxes
 The tape prevents you from opening the boxes.

 the northeast and northwest.  A doorway to the east is mirrored by a
 closed door to the west.

>go west

 Utility Room
    The room is hot and stifling; cobwebs drip from every surface.  A
 hot-water tank crouches in one corner.  Rickety stairs lead into the
 depths of the building.  To the east is an open door.

>exits
 You can go east and down.

>examine tank
 The tank is old and somewhat rusty.  An orange wire runs past it.

>touch tank
 The tank is cool.

>go down
 Balance Room
    A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you.  The north
 and west walls are taken up by tables.  A clock and a light switch are
 just visible next to the stairs on the south wall.  In the northwest
 corner is a tiny drain; in the southeast corner are two large wheels,
 one on the east wall and one on the south wall.  A pile of spheres has
 claimed part of the east wall beneath the wheel.
    In the middle of the south wall is a heater.
    Sitting on the tables are a rucksack and five balances.
    A man stands bent over the tables, jotting things down in a large
 notebook.

 As your footsteps sound on the stairs, the man turns.  He looks you
 over, one eyebrow quirking in surprise.  "Hello," he says.  "And here I
 thought I was the last one still around.  I'm Frankie."

>ask frankie about balance
 "Frankly, I don't know what they were for.  One of the unsolved
 mysteries of this place."

>ask frankie about head
 There is no reply.

>ask frankie about terry
 There is no reply.

>examine balances
 Sitting silent on the tables, the balances are all tarnished brass and
 pitted steel.

>examine rucksack
 It is made of heavy denim and looks well-used.  The rucksack is open.

>t rucksack
>get sack
 I don't know the word "t".

 Frankie glances over at you as you pick up the rucksack.  "You can have
 it," he says.  "It'll do you more good than it will me."

>examine sack
 It is made of heavy denim and looks well-used.  The rucksack is open.

>put all in sack
 fool:  Done.
 rucksack:  You can't put the rucksack in itself!

>examine clock
 A white-faced clock with numbers and black hands, hands which stand
 frozen at 10:02.  Next to the clock is a light switch.

>ask frankie about frankie
 Frankie grins sardonically.  "I'm just an archaeologist, nothing more.
 My team and I were working on unearthing those," he gestures at the
 pile of spheres by the wall, "until we got word of the avalanche."

>ask frankie about team
 "I sent my team away when we heard about the avalanche.  I couldn't ask
 them to put themselves in harm's way."

>ask frankie about avalanche
 Frankie says, "When we heard about it yesterday, we all started rushing
 about, hither and yon, trying to finish our separate projects.  The
 power going out didn't help things a bit."  He sighs heavily.  "I only
 wish someone could have protected my project."

>ask frankie about project
 "Why, the spheres," he says.

>ask frankie about spheres.
 Frankie says, "They were my project.  Well, mine and some colleagues.
 They'd been buried near here for years."  He gazes at the spheres for a
 minute, then at you.  "Makes you wonder why someone would go to all the
 trouble to bury them."

>examine spheres
 The spheres are smooth and translucent, glowing softly from within.
 Several are caked with mud and dirt, testimony to their recent
 location.  They have been stacked in a tight-fitting pyramid.  You feel
 a strange sense of deja vu as you gaze into them.

>count spheres
 I don't know the word "count".

>clean spheres
 There is no need to clean the pile of spheres.

>touch spheres
 You reach your hand towards one of the spheres.  As you draw nearer, a
 spark spits from the sphere, rushes up your arm, and then--

 Darkness, then light.

 You see yourself, a brief memory of driving your father's car alone for
 the first time, Joe Walsh on the radio, hands ice-slick with the fear
 of wrecking, pulse pounding, the thrill of being in control--

 Light, then darkness.

 You are thirteen, on a camping trip with friends, hiding in the dark,
 playing a game of flashlight tag, who will be the first to find you, or
 will you find the others first--

 With a horrendous wrenching sensation you pull yourself away from the
 pile of spheres.  You glance at Frankie but, absorbed in his
 notetaking, he has not noticed your momentary distress.

>tell frankie about spheres
 Frankie says, "They were my project.  Well, mine and some colleagues.
 They'd been buried near here for years."  He gazes at the spheres for a
 minute, then at you.  "Makes you wonder why someone would go to all the
 trouble to bury them."

 One of the spheres teeters, then rolls down the pile.  It reaches the
 bottom and breaks, golden smoke issuing from it.  As the shards of the
 sphere melt into the floor, the smoke begins coalescing, solidifying
 into a Welsh Corgi puppy who barks twice at you.

 Frankie glances at the puppy, then at you, smiling at something.
 "Looks like you have a new pet," he says.  "I'd say the first order of
 business is to name him."

>name dog bubbles
 You may name something by using NAME OBJECT "NEWNAME".

>name dog "Bubbles"
 You call to the dog.  "Bubbles!  C'mere, Bubbles!"  The dog cocks its
 head at you, then trots over to you, panting happily.

 Bubbles wanders away.

>ask frankie about building
 Don't worry about the building.

>ask frankie about clock
 Frankie says, "I'm afraid I won't be much help with that."

>ask frankie about power
 "We put too many demands on the building, tripped every breaker it had,
 one by one.  Thing is, to restart the system you have to reset the
 breakers in the order in which they were tripped.  Too much bother for
 us, considering our time limit, and what with the breakers being on the
 outside of the building and all."

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,
 however, Bubbles calms down and trots nonchalantly up to you.

>ask frankie about coat
 Frankie says, "I'm afraid I won't be much help with that."

>ask frankie about wheels
 Frankie says, "The wheels control the level of this room.  I assume
 that they were installed to keep the balances...well, balanced."

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

>ask frankie about heater
 Frankie says, "I'm afraid I won't be much help with that."

>look in sack
 In the rucksack you see a fool.

>exits
 You can go up.

>examine heater
 It is an old-fashioned wood-burning heater, standing a few centimeters
 above the ground on metal legs.  Heat pours from it in waves.  Its most
 noticeable feature isn't: it has no smoke stack.

>examine wheels
 south wheel:  The spoked metal wheel has a handle at one point of its
 circumference.
 east wheel:  The spoked metal wheel has a handle at one point of its
 circumference.

>examine drain
 The metal drain is a small circle with a grate about ten centimeters in
 diameter.

>look in drain
 There's nothing in the metal drain.

>open drain
 I don't know how to open the metal drain.

>open grate
 I don't know how to open the metal drain.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

>pet bubbles
 You pet Bubbles, whose tail wags mightily in response.

>pet frankie
 Frankie might not take kindly to that.

>bubbles, go north
 Bubbles looks at you quizically, head cocked to one side.

>bubbles, jump
 Bubbles looks at you quizically, head cocked to one side.

>bubbles, fetch sphere
 Bubbles looks at you quizically, head cocked to one side.

 Bubbles curls up in a small ball, resting.

>take bubbles
 Bubbles gives you a sidelong look.  As your hands close around the dog,
 it swirls like smoke, solidifying just out of your reach.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

>go up
 Utility Room
    The room is hot and stifling; cobwebs drip from every surface.  A

 the height of the hall from two stories to one.  A small door to the
 east and two large doors to the south stand ajar.  To one side of the
 two doors is a light switch.

 Preparatory Room
    Small and comfortable after the audience hall, a retreat for whoever
 once presided to the west.  A coatrack, chair, and desk fill the room

    Hanging from the coatrack are a pair of gloves and a thin coat.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

 Audience Hall
    Your footsteps echo hollowly in the dimly-lit and cavernous hall.
 Benches line the floor, their rows skewed slightly to focus on the desk
 at the north end.  A clock is set in the wall in plain view of the
 desk.  The south third of the room is covered by a balcony, reducing
 the height of the hall from two stories to one.  A small door to the
 east and two large doors to the south stand ajar.  To one side of the
 two doors is a light switch.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

>go south
 North End of Hallway
    The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors.  Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the

 the northeast and northwest.  A doorway to the east is mirrored by an
 open door to the west.

 Library
    The library is a dimly-lit backwards L curving around the end of the
 building.  Shelves filled with books take up much of the room; the rest
 is inhabited by stacks of books.  A metal sentinel guards the west
 exit; on the other side of the exit is a light switch.  There is a
 clock above the sentinel.

>examine sentinel
 A dark metal statue, reminiscent of a prop from Fritz Lang's
 Metropolis.  A stern, angular head sits atop a sexless body seven feet
 tall.  Its arms are straight at its sides.

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,
 however, Bubbles calms down and trots nonchalantly up to you.

>examine clock
 A white-faced clock with numbers and black hands, hands which stand
 frozen at 10:58.

 The books resemble case histories from a law library: leather binding,
 small type on their spines.

 Bubbles takes a running fit, tearing around as fast as possible on
 short legs.

>read books
 You pull one off a shelf at random and open it.  You read of a dilemma,
 arguments pro and con, and then of the final decision.  As you replace
 the book, you realize that the entire episode seems oddly familiar.

    You have an excellent view of the audience hall from the balcony.
 Benches, which would look somber from the floor below, look forlorn

 The metal bolts stud the balcony, making for treacherous footing.
 Their spacing and uniformity mark the outlines of the benches they once

    The tiny closet is dank and has a strange smell.  It is unfinished;

    Rows of filing cabinets divide the room into sections.  Metal rises

 Foyer
    The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north.  On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway.  The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.
    Tracked across the marble floor are muddy footprints.

 Cramped Office
    Shadows crowd the room, strengthened by the unlit ceiling light
 which is canted at a strange angle.  A scarred mahogany desk is crammed
 into one corner of the room, facing the doorway and the clock above it.
 The room is small enough that the light switch beside the door is
 within arms reach of the desk.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

 They fill the room.  Opaque...no shadows should be so thick.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

 vibrates in time to some unheard syncopated beat.

>pull light
 It's too far away.

>listen to light
 You don't hear anything unusual.

>examine desk
 The dark wood of the desk only serves to make the office more
 claustrophobic.  Deep gouges run from the front of the desk to the
 back; close examination shows them to be fingernail-shaped.  All of the
 desk drawers have been removed.

>examine clock
 A white-faced clock with numbers and black hands, hands which stand
 frozen at 2:59.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

 South Half of Archive
    Just enough light filters in to show you row after row of boxes
 filling rack after rack of shelves, making it difficult to find a place
 to stand.  The room continues to the north.  Above the west exit is a
 clock; beside the exit is a light switch.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

 Cardboard boxes, all taped shut.  Each one has been labeled with a
 black magic marker.

 Your eyes roam over their surfaces, taking in their titles.  Many are

 "Fragments."  You feel an odd sense of disorientation as you stare at
 them.

 Bubbles curls up in a small ball, resting.

 North Half of Archive
    Metal shelves fill the hall; most are empty and many have succumbed
 to rust. The shelves that aren't empty hold broken shards of glass.
 The archive continues to the south, and an exit leads west.

>examine shelves
 The shelves cover the room, as if they had multiplied in the same
 manner coathangers are reputed to.  They are covered in broken shards.

>break shelves
 Don't worry about the metal shelves.

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,
 however, Bubbles calms down and trots nonchalantly up to you.

 North End of Hallway
    The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors.  Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the

 the northeast and northwest.  A doorway to the east is mirrored by an
 open door to the west.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

 Balance Room
    A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you.  The north
 and west walls are taken up by tables.  A clock and a light switch are
 just visible next to the stairs on the south wall.  In the northwest
 corner is a tiny drain; in the southeast corner are two large wheels,
 one on the east wall and one on the south wall.  A pile of spheres has
 claimed part of the east wall beneath the wheel.
    In the middle of the south wall is a heater.
    Sitting on the tables are five balances.
    Frankie is here, sorting and cataloging.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

>examine wire
 I don't see any wire here.

>examine ceiling
 It looms above you.

 The stairs lead up.

 The windows are barely ten centimeters tall and are nearly flush with
 the ceiling.  They are much thicker than you would expect, almost like
 the glass found on submersibles.

>examine tables
 The tables line the north and west walls.  On them you see five
 balances.

 Out of the corner of your eye you notice something under the tables.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

 A white-faced clock with numbers and black hands, hands which stand
 frozen at 10:02.  Next to the clock is a light switch.

 Sitting silent on the tables, the balances are all tarnished brass and
 pitted steel.

>look under tables
 Under the tables you see a junction box.

>examine box
 The junction box has a wire running out of it and a large knife switch
 on its side.  The switch is currently off.

>examine wire
 The wire is large and sheathed in orange.  It runs from the box into
 the northeast corner of the wall.

 Bubbles takes a running fit, tearing around as fast as possible on
 short legs.

>examine switch
 Which switch do you mean, the light switch, or the junction box?

>knife
 The junction box has a wire running out of it and a large knife switch
 on its side.  The switch is currently off.

>switch it
 You push the large knife switch up.  When you release it, however, it
 slides back to its original position.  "Don't waste your time with
 that," Frankie tells you.  "It won't work without power."

>get wire
 Don't worry about the large wire.

>ask frankie about box
 Frankie asks, "Which box do you mean, the cardboard boxes, or the
 junction box?"

>junction
 Frankie says, "It supposedly powers the fence on the hill above us."
 He shrugs.  "I've never seen it working."

>ask frankie about cardboard boxes
 Frankie says, "Another group was working on those, but they never could
 get them open.  Judging from the shards near them, they probably held
 some of these spheres."

 Bubbles wanders away.

>ask frankie about fence
 Frankie shrugs.  "It was on our to-do list.  Too bad we never got
 around to it: it could have protected us from the avalanche."

>ask frankie about hill
 Frankie says, "I'm afraid I won't be much help with that."

 Frankie says, "This isn't a good time for repeat questions."

>turn east wheel
 You need to specify clockwise or counterclockwise.

>turn east wheel cw
 You give the wheel a clockwise spin.  As you do, a groaning, shuddering
 sound emanates from beneath your feet.  The floor tilts alarmingly,
 sending the balances to chattering.  The pyramid of spheres shakes but
 stays together.  Frankie spares you a glance; Bubbles looks surprised.
 When you are done the north side of the room is higher than it was, the

 The spheres are smooth and translucent, glowing softly from within.
 Several are caked with mud and dirt, testimony to their recent
 location.  They have been stacked in a tight-fitting pyramid.  You feel
 a strange sense of deja vu as you gaze into them.

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,
 however, Bubbles calms down and trots nonchalantly up to you.

>clean spheres
 There is no need to clean the pile of spheres.

>take bubble
 Bubbles gives you a sidelong look.  As your hands close around the dog,
 it swirls like smoke, solidifying just out of your reach.

 Again you reach for the spheres, but cannot draw close.  The rush of

 Frankie snaps his fingers.  "You know, I'd really appreciate it if
 you'd do me a favor."  He holds up one of the spheres.  "I've had
 trouble cataloguing this one.  Information's available upstairs, but
 I'd lose too much time if I searched for it myself.  Would you mind
 terribly?"  Frankie puts the light sphere in your hands before you can
 answer, then picks up another sphere from the pile.

 exit; on the other side of the exit is a light switch.  There is a
 clock above the sentinel.

 Metropolis.  A stern, angular head sits atop a sexless body seven feet
 tall.  Its arms are straight at its sides.

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,
 however, Bubbles calms down and trots nonchalantly up to you.

 I don't know the word "bend".

 After a bout of experimentation you discover that you can raise and
 lower the sentinel's hands.

>raise hands
 You pull the sentinel's arms, which slowly move up.  As they do they
 come together, until the hands are held cupped in front of the statue.

 Bubbles takes a running fit, tearing around as fast as possible on
 short legs.

>put sphere in hands
 You place the light sphere in the sentinel's hands.  One of the books
 on the shelves slides out and falls on the floor.  The other books
 close in, eliminating the space left by the defector.

>get book
 Which book do you mean, the shelved books, or the single book?

>single
 Taken.

>examine it
 A large, leather-bound volume with the title "Attendance 27914414."

>read it
 A long, boring list of back-and-forth arguments about attending a party
 whose purpose is shrouded in jargon.

>search it
 You find nothing of interest.

>shelved books
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine shelved books
 The books resemble case histories from a law library: leather binding,
 small type on their spines.

>search them
 shelved books:  You find nothing of interest.

>get them
 shelved books:  You wouldn't know where to begin.

 Bubbles wanders away.

>read them
 shelved books:  You pull one off a shelf at random and open it.  You
 read of a dilemma, arguments pro and con, and then of the final
 decision.  As you replace the book, you realize that the entire episode
 seems oddly familiar.

    The library is a dimly-lit backwards L curving around the end of the

 Filing Office
    Rows of filing cabinets divide the room into sections.  Metal rises
 from floor to ceiling.  Drawer after drawer stare at you, none of them
 labelled.  The exit to the east is barely visible due to the metal
 sentinel partially blocking it.  The clock above the exit, however, is
 plainly visible from anywhere in the room, a feat which is nothing
 short of miraculous.

 An open cabinet drawer.  In the drawer you see a long list.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

 They stand to either side of the hall, lined in rows running from east
 to west. They stop short of the desk, leaving several meters of clear
 floor.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

 one on the east wall and one on the south wall.  A pile of spheres has
 claimed part of the east wall beneath the wheel.  The floor slopes
 noticeably towards the south.

    Tracked across the marble floor are muddy footprints.

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,

 Front of Building
    The building to the north is now covered with snow.  Under your feet
 it squeaks with the sound of deep-seated ice.  To the northeast and
 northwest the snow is somewhat thinner, due to the building's
 protection.  Pressed down in the ice and snow are tracks of footprints.

 The wind beats futilely against your coat.

 into the snow, heading towards the building.  Some of its orange
 insulation has been stripped, leaving behind a section of bare wire.

 The cable stretches, but remains attached to the fence.  When you let

 smallish cube.

>examine cube
 A wooden cube, about four centimeters on an edge.  Its surface is
 remarkably polished.

 Something inside the cube softly clicks.  Its walls slide open, then

 Foyer
    The two-story height of the foyer is channelled into a narrower
 hallway to the north.  On the north wall to the west of the hallway's
 beginning is an open doorway.  The building's entrance to the south is
 reflected in the marble floor.
    Tracked across the marble floor are muddy footprints.

>go north
 South End of Hallway
    Like the foyer, the hallway is marble.  Its two-story height
 combined with its thinness inspires unease.  A walkway runs above you,
 clinging to the east and west walls.  Below the east walkway is a
 doorway.

>go north
 North End of Hallway
    The hallway ends abruptly in a pair of large oak doors.  Their
 intricate carving is barely visible in the leaden light from the
 windows above you.  The doors are flanked by two sweeping staircases to
 the northeast and northwest.  A doorway to the east is mirrored by an
 open door to the west.

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,
 however, Bubbles calms down and trots nonchalantly up to you.

>examine carving
 You peer closely at the door, but are unable to tell what the carving
 is of in the dim light.

 I don't see any switch here.

 Audience Hall
    Your footsteps echo hollowly in the dimly-lit and cavernous hall.
 Benches line the floor, their rows skewed slightly to focus on the desk
 at the north end.  A clock is set in the wall in plain view of the
 desk.  The south third of the room is covered by a balcony, reducing
 the height of the hall from two stories to one.  A small door to the
 east and two large doors to the south stand ajar.  To one side of the
 two doors is a light switch.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

>turn on switch
 The room's lights turn on in response.

>examine doors
 small door:  It stands partially ajar and leads to the east.
 large wooden doors:  The carved doors are made of oak and are twice

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,

 Preparatory Room
    Small and comfortable after the audience hall, a retreat for whoever
 once presided to the west.  A coatrack, chair, and desk, lit by the

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

 Balance Room
    A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you.  The north

 just visible next to the stairs on the south wall.  In the northwest
 corner is a tiny drain; in the southeast corner are two large wheels,
 one on the east wall and one on the south wall.  A pile of spheres has
 claimed part of the east wall beneath the wheel.  The floor slopes
 noticeably towards the south.
    In the middle of the south wall is a heater.
    Sitting on the tables are five balances.

 A quiet sound catches your attention.  Black sludge has begun welling
 up through the drain, covering it and starting to fill the northwest
 corner.

 Frankie glances down, then swears quietly.  "Sam, you son-of-a-bitch,"
 he mutters, scribbling furiously in his notebook.  Bubbles barks at the
 sludge, then begins whining softly.

 You give the wheel a counterclockwise spin.  As you do, a groaning,
 shuddering sound emanates from beneath your feet.  The floor tilts
 alarmingly, sending the balances to chattering.  The pyramid of spheres
 shakes but stays together.  Frankie spares you a glance; Bubbles looks
 surprised.  When you are done the south side of the room is higher than
 it was, the north side lower.  The flow of sludge alters course, until
 it is collecting near the middle of the room.

 "Come on!"  Frankie shouts in horror, abandoning his task.  He grabs
 your arm and drags you up the stairs, pulling the trapdoor shut behind
 him.

 Utility Room
    The room is hot and stifling; cobwebs drip from every surface.  A
 hot-water tank crouches in one corner.  A trapdoor in the floor marks
 where the stairs used to be.  To the east is an open door.

    Frankie is here.

>ask frankie about sludge
 Frankie says, "This isn't a good time for repeat questions."

 Bubbles wanders away.

 Frankie looks at his hands, surprised to find he is still carrying a
 sphere.  He holds it up to the light; it has turned black as pitch.
 "The sludge must've hit it," he says.  Then he smiles at you, sadly.
 "It would have been nice to be able to finish."  He shrugs resignedly,
 dropping the sphere.  "Ah, well.  See you round."  He turns and walks
 into the hallway, but as he does, he separates into thousands of
 grains, a painting by Seurat.  The grains separate, caught in a sudden
 zephyr, and are gone.

>examine sphere
 Which sphere do you mean, the light sphere, or the dark sphere?

>dark
 Unlike its mates, this smooth sphere glows blackly.  It feels oddly
 wrong, almost evil.

 You bend down and pick it up.  A sudden tremor seizes your arm muscles,
 then stops.

 Filing Office
    Rows of filing cabinets divide the room into sections.  Metal rises
 from floor to ceiling.  Drawer after drawer stare at you, none of them
 labelled, one of them open.  The exit to the east is barely visible due
 to the metal sentinel partially blocking it.  The clock above the exit,
 however, is plainly visible from anywhere in the room, a feat which is
 nothing short of miraculous.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

>put dark in hands
 You place the dark sphere in the sentinel's hands.  A shudder wracks
 the sentinel.  Its hands lower, dropping the sphere onto the floor.

 With a modicum of effort you are able to push the sentinel's arms back
 down by its sides.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

 Bubbles begins barking at your rucksack, leaping off the ground in an
 effort to grab hold of it before you leave.  Your momentum, however,
 carries you out the door before Bubbles is successful.

 Front of Building
    The building to the north is now covered with snow.  Under your feet
 it squeaks with the sound of deep-seated ice.  To the northeast and
 northwest the snow is somewhat thinner, due to the building's
 protection.  Pressed down in the ice and snow are tracks of footprints.

 To the south you see a man striding through the snow.  He is completely
 grey, as if all color had been leeched from him long ago, a black and
 white image in a world of technicolor.  He pauses, stares at you, then
 continues on until he is lost in the distance.  You feel a sudden
 chill.

 The wind beats futilely against your coat.

>examine man
 I don't see any man here.

>go south
 The snow is impassable in that direction.

 You hear a faint rumbling begin.

 The air above you shimmers for a brief moment, during which a metal
 sphere falls from the disturbance to the ground below.

>examine metal sphere
 A shiny metal sphere, dotted all over with tiny holes.

>touch it
 It feels just like a metal sphere.

>get it
 You reach down and take the sphere.  As you straighten up, tiny needles
 spring from the thousands of holes which dot it.  The needles jab
 through your gloves; with a curse you throw the sphere, now smeared red
 with your blood, away from you.  As it falls it bursts into flame, oily
 smoke curling from it.  From the center of the flame you hear an eerily
 familiar voice say, "Well.  Interesting stunt you've pulled, coming to
 where I now live.  I trust you'll stay for my avalanche."  Then the
 sphere vanishes in a final burst of fire.

>examine blood
 I don't see any blood here.

>go northeast
 East of Building
    The building looms to the west, shadowing the path which leads north
 and south.  Pressed down in the snow are tracks of footprints.
    On the side of the building is a grey box.

>go north
 Hillside
    To the north, the ground suddenly rises into tree-speckled heights.
 From those heights you see snow gracefully piling towards you.  To the
 south, the building's shape breaks the smooth white carpet of the
 ground.  Partially buried in the snow is a large post.  Pressed down in
 the snow are many footprints.

>examine cable
 Which cable do you mean, the lower cable, or the upper cable?

>lower
 It runs from somewhere near the bottom of the fence to about thirty
 centimeters above the snow.  Its end is frayed, showing bare wire.

>touch it
 It feels just like the lower cable.

>hold it
 You reach down and grab hold of the bare end of the cable.  The wire
 rasps against your gloves.

 The rumbling you heard earlier has grown in volume.  It sounds very
 close.

>hold upper
 You reach up and grab hold of the bare end of the cable.  The wire
 writhes in your grasp as a surge of electricity passes through you and
 into the ground and the cable in your other hand.  Through a blue haze
 you see snow fly as the fence raises up, forming a caret on the
 hillside above the building.

 The avalanche bears down upon it, then is shunted to either side of the
 building.  A sense of peace fills you even as you jerk in a Saint
 Vitus' dance.

 Interlude


 Operating Theatre
    Your eyes open reluctantly under the glare of light above you.
 Memory comes flooding back: the clinic, Dr. Boozer, the experimental
 drug to wean you from nicotine.

 They'll take away the drug.  Part of you pronounces this a wonderful
 idea.  Another, louder, part of you disagrees, thinks that something
 _important_ is happening in your head, something you shouldn't
 interrupt.

 The theatre is reassuringly familiar, distracting you from your
 thoughts.  You are reclining on a padded chair, much like those
 dentists use.  To your left, monitors softly wheep in response to
 signals from the leads attached to you.  The north wall boasts an open
 door, while the west wall is mostly mirror.
    Standing next to the padded chair is an IV stand, its needle
 dangling from it.

 Round, cold; used for monitoring heartbeat and other vital functions.
 The leads are attached by wires to the monitors on one end and you on
 the other.

>examine me
 What you can see of yourself is familiar.

>examine monitors
 The monitors are stacked next to the chair, facing it.  Lights play
 across their surfaces, and a bright spot traces a jagged heartbeat
 across a square screen.  Running from one of the monitors are several
 wires, leads attached to their other ends.

 You feel hot, then cold several times in succession.

>examine door
 The door has a knob with which it can be locked or unlocked.  It is
 currently open.

>examine iv
 Hanging from the stand is a bag filled with a clear liquid--the
 nicotine antiaddiction drug.  A needle hangs from the bag.

 Pointed, sharp.  Liquid glistens from its tip.

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer in the padded chair.

>out
 Not while you are attached to the monitors.

>remove leads
 With a slight sucking sound the leads come free from your temples and
 from your wrists.  The monitors immediately begin shrilling loudly, the
 screen tracing out a flat line.  Startled, you drop the leads.

>go west
 You can't go that way.

 You hear footsteps outside the theatre, followed by Dr. Boozer's
 entrance.  His eyes, crinkled with concern, relax when he sees you
 awake.  "Thank God," he says.  "I thought I'd heard you flatline."  You
 begin to crumple but Dr. Boozer moves to support you, surreptitiously
 taking your pulse.  "Are you recovered?" he asks worriedly.

 You glance down, staring past your trembling hands.  You find you don't
 know how to answer.

 a light just above it.  On the north wall, just to the left of the
 door, is a bank of monitors.  The west wall is mostly mirror.
    Standing next to the padded chair is an IV stand, its needle
 dangling from it.

>SAVE
>cf18
 Saved.

>examine me
 What you can see of yourself is familiar.

 You feel hot, then cold several times in succession.

>inventory
 You have medical leads (being worn).

>examine leads
 Round, cold; used for monitoring heartbeat and other vital functions.
 The leads are attached by wires to the monitors on one end and you on
 the other.

>examine monitors
 The monitors are stacked next to the chair, facing it.  Lights play
 across their surfaces, and a bright spot traces a jagged heartbeat
 across a square screen.  Running from one of the monitors are several
 wires, leads attached to their other ends.

>examine heartbeat
 I don't know the word "heartbeat".

>examine mirror
 The west wall is mostly mirror, reflecting the chair and the bright
 light over it.

>look in mirror
 You can't reach that from the padded chair.

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer in the padded chair.

>look in mirror
 You spend several moments gazing at your reflection and its haggard,
 sunken eyes.

>remove leads
 With a slight sucking sound the leads come free from your temples and
 from your wrists.  The monitors immediately begin shrilling loudly, the
 screen tracing out a flat line.  Startled, you drop the leads.

 Your hands begin twitching uncontrollably.  You fight to keep them
 still.

>remove leads
 Taken.

 You hear footsteps outside the theatre, followed by Dr. Boozer's
 entrance.  His eyes, crinkled with concern, relax when he sees you
 awake.  "Thank God," he says.  "I thought I'd heard you flatline."  You
 begin to crumple but Dr. Boozer moves to support you, surreptitiously
 taking your pulse.  "Are you recovered?" he asks worriedly.

 You glance down, staring past your trembling hands.  You find you don't
 know how to answer.

    Standing next to the padded chair is an IV stand, its needle

 Hanging from the stand is a bag filled with a clear liquid--the
 nicotine antiaddiction drug.  A needle hangs from the bag.

 Your hands begin twitching uncontrollably.  You fight to keep them
 still.

>examine needle
 Pointed, sharp.  Liquid glistens from its tip.

>put needle in arm
 Wincing slightly in anticipation, you jab the needle into a prominent
 vein.  Your summer job in the hospital pays off: the needle slides home
 on the first try.

 Ice cold, the drug races up your arm and through your chest, numbing
 you.  Fire hot, the next wave of the drug invades your system.  The
 walls around you blur, fade away as the world runs in technicolor
 streaks...

 With a snap, the vision ends.  You are lying prostrate on the ground,
 the ceiling whirling above you.  Next to you, you hear Dr. Boozer's
 voice.  "Thank God we found you in time," he says.

 "Must be deranged," he whispers to the nurse who is with him.  Even in
 your fevered state, you hear every word.  "Poor kid put the IV back
 in."  Then you drift away, the rest of Dr. Boozer's words lost.

 The crates are stacked almost to the ceiling by the northeast corner,
 leaving a small cubby behind them.

 A particularly violent spasm throws you to the floor.  You stand again
 with some effort.

>enter cubby
 You hunker down behind the crates.  They are just tall enough to hide
 you.

    Hanging from the monitors are several medical leads.

 All of your symptoms attack at once: fever, chills, cramps, pain.  Your
 vision dims as you slump to the floor.  Time passes without you
 noticing.

 The feel of cool air brings you back around.  Above you, blue sky
 streaks by.  A face intrudes, looking down at you and mouthing words
 you cannot hear.  A glance down shows you strapped to a gurney.  When
 you look up again, the sky has been cut off by the roof of an
 ambulance.  You close your eyes, succumbing to a dark tide.

 "play of light/a photograph/the way I used to be
  some half-forgotten stranger/doesn't mean that much to me"
                             -- Rush


 Green Four
    A familiar green hallway embraces you.  As the world ceases its
 unnatural spin, you find you recognize the east-west hall.  You're in
 Green area of the hospital where you volunteered for three months one
 summer.

 No, not volunteered.  It was coercion.  You were going to be a doctor,
 just like father wanted, so you had to help out at a local hospital.
 "Looks good on your resume," everyone told you.

 Three months of hell.  This place cemented your desire to avoid med
 school.

    Seated in a wheelchair is an old woman.

>examine woman
 The woman in the wheelchair is ancient, her parchment skin deeply
 wrinkled and folded.  Alert eyes peer from behind large octagonal
 glasses, eyes which follow every movement in the room.

>examine me
 What you can see of yourself is familiar.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>talk to woman
 I don't know the word "talk".

>hello, woman
 Nice weather we've been having.

 There's no verb in that sentence!

>examine wheelchair
 The woman in the wheelchair is ancient, her parchment skin deeply
 wrinkled and folded.  Alert eyes peer from behind large octagonal
 glasses, eyes which follow every movement in the room.

 A group of doctors and interns appears in the hall, headed towards you.
 You are fixated by the sight of their faces, or rather by their lack of
 ones.  Their heads nearly touch; they are obviously in conference,
 though you can hear nothing.  They pass you and are gone.

>woman, hello
 "Oh, hello!" she says excitedly.  Then a look of puzzled concentration
 crosses her face.  "Have we met before?" she asks.

>tell woman about me
 The woman says, "Oh, dear, I really can't help you with that."

>examine me
 What you can see of yourself is familiar.

>ask woman about herself
 The old woman says, "Me?  Oh, my, no sense in boring you to tears!"

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>push wheelchair
 How rude!

>go east
 As you walk east, the hall lengthens.  With each step everything blurs,
 vanishing into a grey mist.  Your sense of balance is lost; you stumble
 back the way you came.

 A group of doctors and interns appears in the hall, headed towards you.
 They, too, are faceless.  Their heads nearly touch; they are obviously
 in conference, though you can hear nothing.  They pass you and are
 gone.

>go west
 Green Three
    The hall enters from the east and bends to the southwest.  A small
 door leads north and an open doorway graces the south wall.

>examine door
 The open door leads north.  A plastic plaque mounted on it reads "G7."

>look

    The hall enters from the east and bends to the southwest.  A small
 door leads north and an open doorway graces the south wall.

>go north
 Hospital Room
    A dim room filled with arcane medical equipment and dominated by a
 bed in its center.  There is a window, its curtains closed, on the
 north wall.  A door leads south.

 Movement at the edge of your vision causes you to whirl around.  Before
 you complete the motion grey hands have grabbed you and dragged you
 backwards.  You have time to register the sight of a white-haired
 head--familiar, but from where?--next to the bed before you are pulled
 from the room.

 Green Three
    The hall enters from the east and bends to the southwest.  A small
 door leads north and an open doorway graces the south wall.
    A grey man stands over you, grinning.

 "You've been very busy," the grey man says.  "Very, very busy."  His
 voice is like a stick of butter squeezed through a fist.  "Don't you
 even know why you're here?"

>no
 The grey man laughs at you, a horrible sound.

 "No guesses?" Eyebrows lift in mock surprise.  He points down the hall
 at the old woman in the wheelchair.  "To help idiots like her, perhaps?
 You weren't successful the first time."

 You turn away, your cheeks glowing.  The time you spent volunteering at
 the hospital was far from enjoyable.  When you look back, the grey man
 has vanished.

>go north
 You'll have to open the small door first.

>open door
 It's locked.

>exits
 You can go north, south, east, and southwest.

>go south
 Operating Room
    The operating room is dim and smoky, lit by kerosene lamps and
 candles.  Through the haze you make out exits to the north, south, and
 west.
    A group of doctors fills the room, milling about a patient.

>examine patient
 The poor man is enduring what passes for medical care in this room.

 One of the doctors takes a glass cup from its stand over a candle and
 applies it to the patient's skin, making the man writhe.

>examine cup
 Various pieces of medical equipment lie scattered about the room and
 held in doctors' hands.

>examine patient
 The poor man is enduring what passes for medical care in this room.

>go south
 Green One
    A nondescript hall leading east to northwest.  To the north is an
 open doorway.  The ever-present stripe changes color to the east, just
 beyond a sign.

>examine sign
 The sign hangs from the ceiling to the west.  It reads, "Leave
 Green/Enter Purple" in the appropriate colors.

>leave green
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

 From further down the hall you hear the familiar squeak of a gurney.  A
 faceless man in blue scrubs is pushing it.  A shape on the gurney is
 completely covered by the white sheet draped over it.  The shape
 occasionally writhes, as if in terrible pain.  You watch until you can
 no longer see them.

>go south
 You can't go that way.

>exits
 You can go north, east, and northwest.

>go east
 Purple Three
    The hall jogs west to north, interrupted by several stairs to the
 north.  A sign hangs from the ceiling to the west, delineating where
 the stripe of color changes from purple to green.  A set of doors leads
 east.

>exits
 You can go north, east, and west.

    The corridors of the hospital join in a T-junction.  The arms of the
 T lie east and west, while the base runs south.  A pair of swinging
 doors crowns the top of the T, to the north.  Over the east corridor is
 a sign.

>go south
 Admitting
    The first line of defense between the hospital and the outside
 world.  Chairs are strewn about at random; on several there are
 magazines.  A counter guards the hall leading north.  Above it is a
 speaker.  To the west are a set of wide double doors labeled
 "Deliveries."  South is the hospital exit.
    An attendant is here, sitting behind the counter.
    Bubbles is lying on the ground, waiting for you.

 Bubbles, upon seeing you, cocks its head at you as it stands.  The dog
 is quite a bit larger than it was before.

>examine dog
 Bubbles resembles a corgi.  In fact, it looks like the corgi you begged
 your father for when you were eight.  It has recently grown out of
 early puppyhood.

>pet dog
 You pet Bubbles, whose tail wags mightily in response.

>examine attendent
 I don't know the word "attendent".

>examine attendant
 Glancing at her, you feel a shock of recognition.  It's Linda, the
 woman you disliked most while working here.  With her flaming red hair
 and her patronizing attitude towards anyone younger than she, she was
 hated by many in the hospital.

 Bubbles growls softly, baring teeth at Linda.  Linda glares back at the
 dog.  "Don't you let that mutt bite me," she tells you.

>examine linda
 Linda has fiery red hair and long black fingernails.  She has made a
 career of being angry.

>examine bubbles
 Bubbles resembles a corgi.  In fact, it looks like the corgi you begged
 your father for when you were eight.  It has recently grown out of
 early puppyhood.

>bubbles, bite
 I don't know the word "bite".

>take bubbles
 Bubbles gives you a sidelong look.  As your hands close around the dog,
 it swirls like smoke, solidifying just out of your reach.

>bubbles, attack
 What do you want Bubbles to attack?

>bubbles, attack me
 Bubbles stares at you for a second, then snorts.

>bubbles, attack linda
 Bubbles stares at you for a second, then snorts.

>ask linda about g
 I don't understand that sentence.

>ask linda about g7

    There is a nurse here, talking with a patient.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

 A faceless man in blue scrubs appears from further down the hall.  He
 starts to walk past, then pulls up short next to Bubbles.  He turns his
 head towards you, then ushers Bubbles to the south.

 The nurse, satisfied, wheels the gurney through the swinging doors to

 As your hands close around the globe, you feel a tingling in your
 fingers.  The tingling quickly grows, becomes horrendous pain.  You
 jerk back your hands; the feeling of having dipped them in lava fades.

 The shape under the bed sits up, startling you.  A withered hand grabs
 you, leaving streaks of blood on your arm.  The man is trying to say
 something, a violent exercise which makes his head shake with effort.
 He finally points to the globe on the shelf, making a horrible keening
 noise, before collapsing back under the sheets.

>examine man
 The shape underneath the covers is barely recognizable as a man.  Tubes
 snake around and through his body; what skin he still owns he wears
 poorly.  The rise and fall of his chest are uneven.

>examine globe
 Its borders are nebulous; it gives off a faint glow.

 East of Building
    The building looms to the west, shadowing the path which leads north
 and south.
    On the side of the building is a grey box.

>examine box
 The gunmetal-grey box is attached to the side of the building, marring
 its otherwise smooth surface.  Its cover is open, revealing a row of
 breakers inside and a list taped to the box door.

 Balance Room
    A cramped square room, barely lit by windows above you.  The north
 and west walls are taken up by tables.  A clock and a light switch are
 just visible next to the stairs on the south wall.  In the northwest
 corner a river of black sludge is continuously flowing into the room
 and towards the southwest corner by the stairs; in the southeast corner
 are two large wheels, one on the east wall and one on the south wall.
 A pile of spheres has claimed part of the east wall beneath the wheel.
 The floor slopes noticeably towards the south.
    In the middle of the south wall is a heater.
    Sitting on the tables are five balances.
    Frankie is here, sorting and cataloging like mad.
    Bubbles is wandering around, sniffing at things.

 You have a thin coat (being worn), a pair of gloves (being worn), a

 Operating Theatre, in the padded chair
    The operating theatre is dominated by a padded chair in its center,
 a light just above it.  On the north wall, just to the left of the

    Standing next to the padded chair is an IV stand, its needle

 You place the rucksack on the ground next to Bubbles.  The dog proceeds
 to wriggle under the rucksack, then stand.

>turn east wheel clockwise
 The wheel refuses to turn further in that direction.

>turn east wheel ccw
 You give the wheel a counterclockwise spin.  As you do, a groaning,
 shuddering sound emanates from beneath your feet.  The floor tilts
 alarmingly, sending the balances to chattering.  The pyramid of spheres
 shakes but stays together.  Frankie spares you a glance; Bubbles looks
 surprised.  When you are done the south side of the room is higher than
 it was, the north side lower.

 With a loud blorp, the flow of sludge increases.  Noticeably.

 was that it was highly toxic and flammable."

 The flow of sludge triples, then triples again.  There is a loud sizzle
 as it engulfs the heater, extinguishing it.  The flow reaches the pile
 of spheres, turning them all black, then dissolving them.

 "Come on!"  Frankie shouts in horror, abandoning his task.  He grabs
 your arm and drags you up the stairs, pulling the trapdoor shut behind
 him.

 Utility Room
    The room is hot and stifling; cobwebs drip from every surface.  A
 hot-water tank crouches in one corner.  A trapdoor in the floor marks
 where the stairs used to be.  To the east is an open door.
    Bubbles is wandering around, sniffing at things.
    Frankie is here.

>wait
 Time passes...

 Frankie looks at his hands, surprised to find he is still carrying a
 sphere.  He holds it up to the light; it has turned black as pitch.
 "The sludge must've hit it," he says.  Then he smiles at you, sadly.
 "It would have been nice to be able to finish."  He shrugs resignedly,
 dropping the sphere.  "Ah, well.  See you round."  He turns and walks
 into the hallway, but as he does, he separates into thousands of
 grains, a painting by Seurat.  The grains separate, caught in a sudden
 zephyr, and are gone.

>examine sphere
 Which sphere do you mean, the dark sphere, or the light sphere?

>dark
 Unlike its mates, this smooth sphere glows blackly.  It feels oddly
 wrong, almost evil.

 however, is plainly visible from anywhere in the room, a feat which is

 Front of Building
    You can see little through the glare of sun on snow.  The building
 to the north is just visible, but everything else is a wash of bright
 white.

 Through the glare you can make out a man striding through the snow to
 the south.  He is completely grey, as if all color had been leeched
 from him long ago, a black and white image in a world of technicolor.
 He pauses, stares at you, then continues on until he is lost in the
 distance.  You feel a sudden chill.

 You begin to feel the cold seep into you, chilling you.

>go south
 The snow is impassable in that direction.

 You hear a faint rumbling begin.

 The air above you shimmers for a brief moment, during which a metal
 sphere falls from the disturbance to the ground below.

    Bubbles is lying on the ground, waiting for you.

 Bubbles sees you and jumps up, barking loudly at your return.

 Your hands are working again, albeit a little stiffly.

 The metal sphere rolls towards you.  When it is less than a meter away
 it stops, waiting.

>take metal sphere
 You reach down and take the sphere.  As you straighten up, tiny needles
 spring from the thousands of holes which dot it.  With a curse you
 throw the sphere, now smeared red with your blood, away from you.  As
 it falls it bursts into flame, oily smoke curling from it.  From the
 center of the flame you hear an eerily familiar voice say, "Well.
 Interesting stunt you've pulled, coming to where I now live.  I trust
 you'll stay for my avalanche."  Then the sphere vanishes in a final
 burst of fire.

 Front of Building
    The building to the north is now covered with snow.  Under your feet
 it squeaks with the sound of deep-seated ice.  To the northeast and
 northwest the snow is somewhat thinner, due to the building's
 protection.  Pressed down in the ice and snow are tracks of footprints.

 To the south you see a man striding through the snow.  He is completely

 chill.

 You begin to feel the cold seep into you, chilling you.

>go northeast
 East of Building
    The building looms to the west, shadowing the path which leads north
 and south.  Pressed down in the snow are tracks of footprints.
    On the side of the building is a grey box.

 You hear a faint rumbling begin.

 The air above you shimmers for a brief moment, during which a metal
 sphere falls from the disturbance to the ground below.

>take metal sphere
 You reach down and take the sphere.  As you straighten up, tiny needles
 spring from the thousands of holes which dot it.  With a curse you
 throw the sphere, now smeared red with your blood, away from you.  As
 it falls it bursts into flame, oily smoke curling from it.  From the
 center of the flame you hear an eerily familiar voice say, "Well.
 Interesting stunt you've pulled, coming to where I now live.  I trust
 you'll stay for my avalanche."  Then the sphere vanishes in a final
 burst of fire.

>go north
 Hillside
    To the north, the ground suddenly rises into tree-speckled heights.
 From those heights you see snow gracefully piling towards you.  To the
 south, the building's shape breaks the smooth white carpet of the
 ground.  Partially buried in the snow is a large post.  Pressed down in
 the snow are many footprints.

 The cold is becoming worse, making your fingers slow to work.

>take cord
 I don't see any cord here.

>examine post
 Its square outline thrusts skywards from the snow.  A dark line in the
 snow runs beside it, northwest to southeast.  From the line a cable
 issues.  The cable's twin dangles from the post, then scurries down its
 length and into the snow on the side of the post opposite the line.

>take cable
 Which cable do you mean, the lower cable, or the upper cable?

>take upper cable
 You reach up and grab hold of the bare end of the cable.  The wire
 writhes in your grasp as a surge of electricity passes through you and
 into the ground.  Sparks leap gleefully between your rigid fingers,
 between you and the post, between you and the lower cable.  For a
 moment, improbably, you are a living Jacob's ladder.  You begin to lose
 consciousness as your clothes smoulder, then burst into flames.

 The pain is mercifully brief.

 you see snow fly as the fence raises up, forming a caret on the
 hillside above the building.

 The avalanche bears down upon it, then is shunted to either side of the
 building.  A sense of peace fills you even as you jerk in a Saint
 Vitus' dance.

 Interlude


 Operating Theatre
    Your eyes open reluctantly under the glare of light above you.
 Memory comes flooding back: the clinic, Dr. Boozer, the experimental
 drug to wean you from nicotine.

 They'll take away the drug.  Part of you pronounces this a wonderful
 idea.  Another, louder, part of you disagrees, thinks that something
 _important_ is happening in your head, something you shouldn't
 interrupt.

 The theatre is reassuringly familiar, distracting you from your
 thoughts.  You are reclining on a padded chair, much like those
 dentists use.  To your left, monitors softly wheep in response to
 signals from the leads attached to you.  The north wall boasts an open
 door, while the west wall is mostly mirror.
    Standing next to the padded chair is an IV stand, its needle
 dangling from it.

>save

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer in the padded chair.

>turn off monitors
 You turn off the monitors.

>remove leads
 With a slight sucking sound the leads come free from your temples and
 from your wrists.  You drop them, leaving them dangling from the
 monitors.

>take iv
 Taken.

>go north
 Hallway
    The hallway runs west to east; the east end of the hall curves south
 towards reception.  An open door lies to the south, a closed door to
 the north.

 You feel hot, then cold several times in succession.

    The hallway bends here, running north and east.  To the south is a

 Supplies Room
    The walls of the room are lined with shelves, all of which are
 neatly stocked with supplies.  An open door is set in the west wall.

>close door
 Closed.

>enter cubby
 You hunker down behind the crates.  They are just tall enough to hide
 you and the IV stand.

>put needle in arm
 Wincing slightly in anticipation, you jab the needle into a prominent
 vein.  Your summer job in the hospital pays off: the needle slides home
 on the first try.

 Ice cold, the drug races up your arm and through your chest, numbing
 you.  Fire hot, the next wave of the drug invades your system.  The
 walls around you blur, fade away as the world runs in technicolor
 streaks...

 Green Four
    A familiar green hallway embraces you.  As the world ceases its
 unnatural spin, you find you recognize the east-west hall.  You're in
 Green area of the hospital where you volunteered for three months one
 summer.

 No, not volunteered.  It was coercion.  You were going to be a doctor,
 just like father wanted, so you had to help out at a local hospital.
 "Looks good on your resume," everyone told you.

 Three months of hell.  This place cemented your desire to avoid med
 school.

 Hospital Room
    A dim room filled with arcane medical equipment and dominated by a
 bed in its center.  There is a window, its curtains closed, on the
 north wall.  A door leads south.

 Movement at the edge of your vision causes you to whirl around.  Before
 you complete the motion grey hands have grabbed you and dragged you
 backwards.  You have time to register the sight of a white-haired
 head--familiar, but from where?--next to the bed before you are pulled
 from the room.

    The hall enters from the east and bends to the southwest.  A small

    A grey man stands over you, grinning.

 The nurse moves to the patient at the head of the line and begins

 out of sight.

>go south
 Hospital Room
    In the center of the room, a bed.  In the bed, a huddled shape.
 Beside the bed, murmuring equipment.  To the north is a door.
    Lying on a shelf is a strangely-glowing globe.

>examine globe
 Its borders are nebulous; it gives off a faint glow.

 The shape under the bed sits up, startling you.  A withered hand grabs
 you, leaving streaks of blood on your arm.  The man is trying to say
 something, a violent exercise which makes his head shake with effort.
 He finally points to the globe on the shelf, making a horrible keening
 noise, before collapsing back under the sheets.

>wear gloves
 You aren't carrying the heavy gloves.

>take gloves
 Taken.

>wear gloves
 Okay, you're now wearing the heavy gloves.

>take globe
 As your hands close around the globe, you feel a tingling in your
 fingers even through the gloves.  The tingling quickly grows, becomes
 horrendous pain.  You jerk back your hands; the feeling of having
 dipped them in lava fades.

>remove gloves
 Okay, you're no longer wearing the gloves.

>put gloves in sack
 Done.

>wear sack
 Okay, you're now wearing the rucksack.

 The man's eyes pop open, fever bright.  His lips move soundlessly;
 exhausted from the effort, he sinks further into his bed.

 The vial turns out to be wet; it slips between your fingers and hits

    Bubbles is lying on the ground, staring at you with soulful eyes.

 Glancing at her, you feel a shock of recognition.  It's Linda, the
 woman you disliked most while working here.  With her flaming red hair
 and her patronizing attitude towards anyone younger than she, she was

    There is a nurse here.

 A sudden scream from further down the line.  Both you and the nurse
 jump; she runs to the patient, then returns, wheeling him at high
 speed.  She holds out a horrible-smelling sac filled with a black
 substance.  "Here!" she snaps.  "Colostomy bag.  Take it, quick!"  You
 remember why you chose not to go to med school.

>take bag
 It slithers warmly in your grasp.

 The nurse looks at you gratefully as she wheels the patient north.  As
 she and the patient pass through the doors, one of the blank-faced men
 slips past her and into the hall.  He takes the colostomy bag from you
 and reenters the north doors.  It takes a moment for you to realize the
 bag is really gone, another to realize that you are now covered in a
 light sheen of sweat.

 something.  She turns and sees you.  She beams.  "Terry, glad you're
 still here.  I'm missing my BP cuff--must've dropped it somewhere in
 Green.  Go get it for me, will you?"  She hands you a hall pass.  "In

 Shortly after the chin has completed its journey, soft snores begin

 You are blocked in that direction.

 Down the hall, a shapeless, faceless patient in a white gown shuffles
 towards you.  You cannot guess the sex of wraith-like person, even when
 he (she?) is merely feet away.  You watch the patient until you can no

>bubbles, follow me
 Bubbles gets up and trots over to you.

 Bubbles growls softly, baring teeth at Linda.  Linda glares back at the
 dog.  "Don't you let that mutt bite me," she tells you.

>tell linda about guide dog
 I don't know the word "guide".

>ask linda about guide dog
 There is no reply.

>go north
 Purple One
    The corridors of the hospital join in a T-junction.  The arms of the
 T lie east and west, while the base runs south.  A pair of swinging
 doors crowns the top of the T, to the north.  Over the east corridor is
 a sign.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

 A faceless man in blue scrubs appears from further down the hall.  He
 starts to walk past, then pulls up short next to Bubbles.  He turns his
 head towards you, then ushers Bubbles to the south.

 A woman passes by, dressed in a white coat.  Where her face should be
 there is nothing.  She is soon out of sight, hidden by a turn in the
 hall.

 "Deliveries."  South is the hospital exit.
    Linda is here, sitting behind the counter.
    Bubbles is lying on the ground, staring at you with soulful eyes.

 "I don't have time for stupid questions."  She rolls her eyes in
 exasperation.

 The cane is white with a red tip.  Its grip is worn with use.

>show linda hall pass
 Linda grimaces.  "Okay, so you can come and go as you please.  Big
 deal."  But she looks distinctly unhappy.  You hear what sounds
 remarkably like snickering coming from Bubbles.

>give hall pass to bubbles
 Bubbles has no real way of taking that.

>examine woman
 The woman is ancient, her waxy skin draped loosely about her.

 A doctor, notable for his unmissing face, walks by the door.  He is
 back in seconds, striding into the room.  Leaning over the old woman,
 he shakes her.  "I'm Doctor John; can you hear me?  Ma'am?"  Her lack
 of response prompts him to lean out into the hall and shout:  "Woman
 down, unresponsive; crash cart to Orange 7."  He returns to the woman,
 placing two fingers to her throat and a palm to her forehead.  He tilts
 her head back, extending her neck, and huffs twice into her mouth.  He
 then motions.  "You."  He nods at the woman's chest.  "Begin
 compressions."

>compress chest

>compress woman
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>push chest

 You are already performing CPR on the woman.

 You have slipped into a once-familiar rhythm: five compressions, then
 the doctor breathes, then five compressions.

>examine woman
 The woman is ancient, her waxy skin draped loosely about her.

 A gang of white-garbed doctors, all of whom lack faces, pour into the
 room.  Several of them slide away from the door, revealing the gurney
 and crash cart they have brought with them.

 Dr. John nods at them and their cargo.  He waves you away from the old
 woman and motions the others closer.  "On my mark: one, two, three,"
 and they have lifted the woman up and onto the gurney.

>examine john
 His face is scrunched in concentration, his thin glasses dangling from
 his ears.

 Dr. John nods at the ECG readout.  "She's in VFib."  He snatches up the
 defibrillator paddles and says to you, "Charge to 200."

>charge to 200
 I don't know the word "charge".

>examine defibrillator
 You always found it ironic that shocking someone violently, normally a
 prescription for stopping the heart, is the only way known to restart
 the heart.  Its dial, marked from 200 J to 400 J, currently points at
 320.

>set paddles to 200
 I don't know the word "paddles".

>set dial to 200
 The dial clicks as you turn it to 200.

 "Clear!"  A push of buttons; the woman's body arcs and recollapses.
 Dr. John rubs the paddles together, smearing paste, while he glances at
 the ECG.  "Give me 260."

>set dial to 200
 The dial is already set to 200.

>set dial to 260
 The dial clicks as you turn it to 260.

 Again Dr. John says, "Clear!"  Again the woman's body leaps into the
 air.  Dr. John takes another look at the ECG, saying, "Give me 360."

>set dial to 360
 The dial clicks as you turn it to 360.

 The woman's body jumps once more as Dr. John discharges his paddles.
 When he looks at the ECG this time, his brow furrows.  "PEA," he
 mutters.  "Intubate; give me a 1 mg epinephrine push."  He resumes
 breathing for the woman while one of his faceless helpers performs
 chest compressions.

>intubate
 I don't know the word "intubate".

>give epinephrine to doctor
 Which doctor do you mean, Doctor John, or the faceless doctors?

>give epinephrine to doctor john
 I don't know the word "epinephrine".

>examine cart
 The crash cart appears only when someone is in great distress.  It
 contains plenty of medication, an ECG machine, a syringe, and a
 defibrillator.

 Dr. John notices you during a pause between breaths.  "Thanks," he
 says.  "We have it under control."  Breath.  "You can go."  Then his
 attention is focussed on the woman.  "Pulse back, breathing again.  60
 mg lidocaine."  Two of the faceless doctors usher you, not unkindly,
 through the door.  As you leave, the door closes behind you, snicking
 shut.

 Fit the Third: Renascence


 "When I was a child/I caught a fleeting glimpse
  Out of the corner of my eye"
                             -- Pink Floyd


 Your Bedroom
    You are lying on your bed, staring up at the ceiling.  The sun
 streams through the window blinds and falls in stripes across your
 face.

 But it's not the bed in your apartment.  It's your childhood bedroom,
 upstairs in the house you lived in until shortly after your Mom died.

 Judging from the room's neatness, your Mom must have died not too long
 ago; you remember cleaning your room compulsively after she died in the
 hopes that it would bring her back.  You also remember being sent to
 your room this day for some unexplained infraction of your father's
 rules.

 Your dresser leans against the north wall and a closed door leads east.
 There is a window in the west wall.
    Sitting on the dresser you see a book of mythology and a book of
 faeries.

>examine me
 What you can see of yourself is familiar.

>inventory
 You are empty-handed.

>examine mythology
 In the third grade you became enamored with Greek mythology, scouring
 the 000-010 section of your school library.  This book by Edith
 Hamilton is a remnant of that time.

>examine faeries
 Shortly after your interest in mythology waned, you became interested
 in faeries.  At this age your nascent research had not yet taken over
 the top of your dresser, as this lone oversized book can attest.

>read mythology
 You can't reach the book of mythology from your bed.

>stand
 Okay, you're no longer on your bed.

>read mythology
 You flip through the book, remembering different stories which caught
 your attention: Perseus and Medusa, the rivers lethe and mnemosyne,
 Zeus visiting Leda in the guise of a swan.

>read faeries
 As you skim through the book, several facts jump out: how faeries are
 driven away by church bells, how they change homes on Quarter Days, how
 you shouldn't eat faerie food, how a four-leaf clover will let you see
 them.

>look up lethe in mythology
 I don't know the word "lethe".

>open dresser
 You pull open a few drawers and look at the rows of neatly-folded
 clothes before closing the drawers once more.

>look under bed
 There's nothing under your bed.

>examine curtains
 I don't see any curtains here.

>examine blinds
 I don't know the word "blinds".

>examine window
 The window is closed and looks out on the rolling hills behind your
 house; without looking directly through the window, the details are
 hard to make out.  You can just see your backyard one story beneath
 you.

>look in window
 It's closed.

>take books
 book of mythology:  Taken.
 book of faeries:  Taken.

>open window
 Opened.

>look in window
 There's nothing in the bedroom window.

>look through window
 You see the hills behind your house and your backyard.  Your father
 called that region "Big Country," and he used to tell you stories of
 heroes who walked Big Country in search of adventures.  Though he
 stopped telling you those stories after your mom died, the dreams stay
 with you.

>go west
 The fall would kill you.

>take sheet
 You pull the bedsheet free, unmaking the bed in the process.

>rip sheet
 The bedsheet can't be torn.

>examine bed
 The bed was large enough for you through your tenth birthday.  It has
 been unmade and its bedsheet removed.

>look under bed
 There's nothing under your bed.

>tie sheet to window
 You can't tie anything to the bedroom window.

>tie sheet to bed
 You loop the sheet around your bed and tie it.

>put sheet in window
 If you wish to climb down the sheet, you need only hold it while you
 climb out the window.

>examine door
 It is closed.

>open door
 Your father would see you come out of your room if you left via this
 door, and the punishment to follow would be painful.

>climb out window
 You realize that it is impossible to hold onto the bedsheet and
 anything as large as the oversized books at the same time if you intend
 to reach the ground safely.

>drop books
 book of mythology:  Dropped.
 book of faeries:  Dropped.

>take mythology
 Taken.

>throw it out window
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>throw it through window
 You throw the book of mythology through the window.  It vanishes to the
 ground below.

>take book
 Taken.

>throw it through window
 You throw the book of faeries through the window.  It vanishes to the
 ground below.

>climb out window
 You grab hold of the bedsheet tightly and lower yourself out the open
 window.  You shimmy down the sheet, old skills returning.  A few feet
 above the ground your sheet runs out, but the shock of the drop is
 easily absorbed by your young legs.

 South Part of Backyard
    The backyard ends to the south and west in a chain-link fence which
 fetches up against your house.  Grass covers the ground in a remarkably
 even carpet.
    You see a book of mythology and a book of faeries here.

>take books
 book of mythology:  Taken.
 book of faeries:  Taken.

>exits
 You can go north.

>search grass
 There is too much of it for you to search indiscriminately.

>look for four-leaf clover
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine grass
 It thickly covers the ground.  A rogue patch of clover has established
 a beachhead in the sea of grass.  Your father will no doubt rip it out
 at the first opportunity, restoring the backyard to its former glory.

>search grass for clover
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine clover
 The patch of clover huddles together in solidarity against the
 encroaching grass.

>search clover
 You get on hands and knees and begin carefully examining each clover
 individually.  After a moment you are rewarded with a pristine
 four-leaf clover, which you take.

>examine faeries
 Shortly after your interest in mythology waned, you became interested
 in faeries.  At this age your nascent research had not yet taken over
 the top of your dresser, as this lone oversized book can attest.

    The fence paces you to the west, then angles north to block further

 thick mat of grass leads back south.

 From somewhere around your feet you hear a tiny voice pipe up: "Top o'
 the mornin' to ya!"  You look down and see a small faerie just on this
 side of the fence.  He is joined by two others, though you can't see
 where they came from.

 One of the others replies, "And the rest of the day to yerself!"

    Three faeries are conversing near your feet.

 One of the faeries says to the other two, "Shall we be returnin'?  The
 king wanted us back quick as possible."

 "Aye."

 "But we're without a padfoot.  How to get back?"

 "I've a way," responds the third faerie.  "'Tis in the shed."  The
 faeries move to the east.

 Tool Shed
    Light filters through chinks in the roof, dimly illuminating empty
 shelves and forgotten tools.  The structure smells of mildew and rot.
    Seated on a shelf is a metal box.
    A yellowed flyer is curled on the floor.

 One of the faeries pulls several over-sized white hats from under a
 pile of dirt.  Despite their earthy storage they are pristine white.
 He hands them to the others.  Then he wears his hat, saying, "I'm off!"
 In a flash, he zips out the door and into the air.

 The two remaining faeries don their hats.  "I'm after!"  "I'm after!"
 Both are caught up in the air and are gone.

 In their wake, a lone white hat drifts to the floor of the shed,
 forgotten.

 The flyer extols the virtues of the SchimTek Sonic Cavity Analyzer.
 The picture on the flyer shows a rectangular box with a large grip
 handle on one end, reminiscent of an old geiger counter.  Your father
 was eternally collecting gadgets like the Sonic Cavity Analyzer.

 Your father comes into the tool shed, looking around.  He is in his
 late thirties, a vigorous man who shows no sign of the cancer which
 will steal his life in thirteen years.  His face darkens when he sees
 you, and he walks stiffly towards you.  "_There_ you are," he says,
 grabbing your ear and pulling firmly.  You skip after him, pain
 burgeoning across your head.

 Your father punctuates each phrase with a twist of your ear, causing
 sparks to burst across your vision.  "You were supposed"--twist--"to
 stay"--twist--"in your room"--twist.

 The final twist overcomes you; your vision dims.  The throbbing in your
 head worsens as you fall back.

 A hospital bed catches you, supporting you.  A quick glance shows you a
 sterile hospital room.  No one else is here; the room is yours alone.
 Then a black tide washes over you, carrying you away....

 Hall of Stolen Light
    Everywhere you look in this hall you find another source of light.
 They come in all shapes and forms: candles, lamps, crystals.  The light
 bounces about the room, illuminating the throne at the north end of the
 hall.  A thick carpet runs from the throne to the south exit, passing
 by a banquet table.
    Sitting on the throne you see a faerie king.
    To either side of you stands a faerie guard.
    Off to one side of the throne, True Thomas idly sits.
    Beside the king stands his queen.
    Faeries stand all around you, watching you with a disturbing
 intensity.

 The king looks at you, his eyes glinting strangely.  "A human child?
 It's been an age since one visited."  While he speaks, the other
 faeries slowly circle you.  A sibilant whisper rises from the
 gathering.  "Guards, retake what is ours."  One of the guards reaches
 over and plucks the white hat from you.

>exits
 You can go south.

>examine true thomas
 He is an old man, with snow-white hair and a creased face.  He holds a
 stringed instrument which he absentmindedly strums from time to time.

 "We've naught to offer to incipient royalty such as yourself," the king
 continues mockingly.  He pauses for a moment, stroking his beard.  His
 queen leans over and whispers to him, causing him to grin.  There is
 nothing human in his expression.  "Perhaps there is something you can
 offer us instead," he says.

>inventory
 You have a book of mythology, a book of faeries, a four-leaf clover, a
 metal box, and a flyer.

 The other faeries stop circling and point at you.  You feel a tingle
 running up and down your spine.  "We'd have from you a story, but one
 already fills that role."  The king gestures at True Thomas, who
 glances uncomfortably at you.  "No, for you I think harvesting would
 suit."  The faeries begin running, flying, hopping around you, a
 writhing mass of flesh.  The guards to either side of you take one step
 back.

>turn handle
 Turning the metal box doesn't have any effect.

 "Hold!" shouts Thomas.  The assemblage halts, many in mid-air.  As one
 they turn and focus unnaturally-bright eyes on Thomas, who blanches.
 Nevertheless, he continues.  "King, could this child not fetch for you
 some new light?"  As Thomas finishes, the silence deepens.  Sweat
 begins to run down his face.

>examine table
 The sturdy table has seen much use in its time.  It is covered with
 heavy scars.  On its surface you see some food.

 "A fine suggestion!" the king finally says.  Thomas sways somewhat, as
 if released from a painful grip.  From the horde of faeries an excited
 buzz arises.

>examine king
 He is one of the tallest faeries you have yet met.  His beard is red
 and reaches to his waist.  Other than his clothes of rough cloth, he
 wears a gold circlet around his head, sign of his kingship.

 "My hall is lit by light stolen from many a source," the king explains.
 At the snap of a finger, one of the faeries brings forward a bright
 glint cupped in his hands.  "Taken from one of Judas' silver pieces,
 that was," says the king.  Another faerie brings forward a dancing
 flame.  The flame radiates cold you can feel from feet away.  "At the
 heart of every pawnbroker's diamond is a flame like this," says the
 king.  "And you'll be fetching me the light of a dragon's flame."

>say "yes"
 You sound rather positive.

 A tiny faerie approaches bearing a mason jar, which he places in your
 hands.  "Capture the light of a dragon's flame in that jar," says the
 king, "but let not the flame touch the jar, for it will melt."

>examine jar
 The mason jar is made of thick glass.

 "Return with the dragon fire and we will reward you."  As the king
 finishes speaking, the two guards lead you back out of the hall.

 Cave

 Top of Hill
    The hill curves away from this spot, crowned on top by a gnarled
 thorn tree. Paths curve down the hill to the west and south.  Far to
 the north is a small white church.
    Bubbles is lying on the ground, waiting for you.

 Bubbles, upon seeing you, cocks its head at you and stands.  The dog

 Bluff
    The hill drops off sharply to the west, overlooking a rocky tumble

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,
 however, Bubbles calms down and trots nonchalantly up to you.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

>examine boy
 He lived (lives?) somewhere around here.  You can remember the delight

 difference was enough to give him the edge.

 Wielding his knife like a cleaver, the boy manages to carve an 'N' in
 the oak tree.

>examine oak
 The oak tree towers above you, its bole wider than your arms can span.
 You spent a long time one summer trying to climb it, only to break your
 arm in the process.  Since then, someone has hacked 'BRAN' in its
 trunk.

 Shavings fall from the oak tree as the boy carves a 'D' into its trunk.

>examine ash
 Thinner than its neighboring oak tree, the trunk of the ash gracefully
 sways in a gentle breeze.

 Bubbles wanders away.

 With a flourish, the boy finishes carving an 'N' in the oak tree.  He
 steps back to admire his handiwork.

 then carve another 'B' in the oak tree just below the first letters.

 Forest
    The forest growth pauses here, leaving room for a ring of mushrooms
 and toadstools.  Due to the spacious arrangement of trees, paths exist
 north and west.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

>examine mushrooms
 The ring of mushrooms and toadstools is ragged in places, as if no
 longer cared for.  One toadstool in particular stands out from its
 brethren.

 Bubbles comes over, sniffs at your legs, then wanders off again.

 mushrooms?

>examine solitary toadstool
 It is the tallest of the fungi gathered here.  Set in its side is a
 small door.

>examine small door
 The small door is painted a bright green and is closed.  You are
 surprised that you never saw it before.

>knock on door
 The door swings open, revealing a tiny pixie.  He looks at your knees,
 then up, then further up.  His eyes widen.  "You see me?" he asks
 unnecessarily.  He steps out, closing the door.  "A visitor!  Well, an
 you can see me, let us visit whilst I clean my yard," he says, bustling
 about.  "Have you questions on the forest?  I have been here for many
 whiles."  Before you can answer, he begins scuffing dirt.

>ask pixie about pixie

 The pixie swirls one of his hands, and a tiny cyclone carries away some
 leaves.

 great boots."

 The pixie wipes dirt from his door.

 Bubbles takes a running fit, tearing around as fast as possible on

 The pixie rearranges some of the dirt in the middle of the faerie ring.

>ask pixie about light
 The pixie asks, "Which light do you mean, the light sphere, or the
 sources of light?"

>sources
 The pixie grins sardonically.  "So you have seen our vaunted king's
 collection, have you?"  He lowers his voice.  "Yet it cannot be
 complete 'til someone captures the dragon's fire for him.  Thank your
 luck you have not been chosen to bear the king's jar to the dragon's
 lair."

>show jar to pixie
 The pixie says, "So...the king has at last found someone to fetch for
 him the light of the dragon."  He cocks his head and peers up at you.
 "And he did mention the precautions?"

 When you shake your head, he leaps into the air, hovering for a second.
 "No word of the wards?"  He mutters, then runs into his home.  There is
 the sound of rummaging, things being thrown about, before he emerges
 holding a pair of boots.

 "You must have wards, lest the dragon sense you.  You must be silent,
 you must be invisible, you must be without scent."  He squints at you,
 then adds as an afterthought, "Also fireproof.

 "A laurel of ash dipped in the blood of another will make you invisible
 to animals.  These boots," he hands the boots to you, "are elfin and
 will muffle your steps.  An oak staff will protect you from the
 dragon's flame."

 The pixie walks to his toadstool and opens the door.  "I needs must
 work indoors for a time," he says by way of explanation before going
 inside.

    Your home once held nothing but good memories; it was a place where
 you were happy, where you felt safe.  But after Mom died you felt your
 life escaping your control.  Now the very sight of the first floor
 entrance, its walls and stairs, the table by the entrance, gives you
 pause.  Leaning against the bottom stair is a briefcase and coat.
    Sitting on the small table you see a bottle of Karo syrup.

 You hear heavy footsteps on the stairs and look up to see your father
 descending, an avatar of righteous wrath.  "Terry!" he shouts.  "You
 stay right there!"

 Then he is beside the stair, shaking you.  "I told you to stay in your
 room!"  He stops, looks you over.  "I see you hiding something!  What
 have you got in your hands?"  He stretches his hand out and waits.

 hospital bed.  Then sleep claims you, a deep, dreamless sleep.

    The cave flares open into a large space.  Most of the space is

 The dragon's head turns towards you.  Its tiny eyes focus on you,
 narrowing.  The dragon's snout opens, gases curling from it.  You have
 a momentary glimpse of the back of the dragon's throat before all is
 erased in a roiling mass of fire.  You fall back, landing hard on the
 cave floor, but feel nothing other than the agony of flame.

 Then you are wrapped in coolness.  You blink, discovering that you are
 lying in a hospital bed.  No one else is in the room; only the sound of
 monitors keeps you company.  An overwhelming tiredness swamps you then,
 and you fall into a dreamless sleep.

    There is an older boy here, carving his name in the oak tree.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.


>examine oak
 The oak tree towers above you, its bole wider than your arms can span.
 You spent a long time one summer trying to climb it, only to break your
 arm in the process.  Since then, someone has hacked 'BRANDN' in its
 trunk, tried to scratch out the letters (with little success), then
 carved 'BRANDON' just below the first letters.

 Bubbles wanders away.

 The cane is white with a red tip.  Its grip is worn with use.

 Thinner than its neighboring oak tree, the trunk of the ash gracefully
 sways in a gentle breeze.

 It is no more climbable for you at age nine than it was at age seven.

 Bubbles comes running toward you, barking loudly.  Upon seeing you,

 "Want this?" You step back; he laughs before turning again to the tree.

 Bubbles takes a running fit, tearing around as fast as possible on
 short legs.

 Your kick catches him by surprise.  He slips and nicks his finger with
 his knife.

 "Stupid kid!" he shouts, whirling around.  A struggle ensues, with you
 taking the worse of it.  At some point, as he is banging your head
 against the ground, his knife slides into your chest.  Your vision,
 none too good after the beating you've endured, dims further.  You feel
 the boy's knee lift from your stomach, then hear him running away.

 You turn your head, numbness spreading through your chest.  The rough
 ground beneath your cheek smooths, becomes a pillow.  You feel the
 sheets of a hospital bed enfold you before the numbness reaches your
 head.

 Bubbles looks at you, then at the boy carving his initials in the tree.
 Lips pull back from teeth, a growl begins deep in the throat; Bubbles
 leaps at the boy.

 Surprised, the boy turns just enough for Bubbles to bury teeth in his
 arm.  "AaaaaAAAA!" he shrieks, dropping his knife.  He shakes his arm,
 but Bubbles hangs on tenaciously.

 Finally, the dog lets go and drops to the forest floor.  The boy grabs
 his arm, blood dripping around his hand.  He stares at you, white
 rimming the pupils of his eyes.  "You!" he says.  He staggers back.
 "You!" he repeats, before turning and running through the forest.

 Bubbles turns to you and grins, tongue hanging from its mouth.

 It is a thin knife with only one blade, currently open.  The blade has
 held its edge, despite its assault on the oak tree.

 "Oww!  Woo!  Whoo!"  The voice is deep and booming, coming from
 somewhere above your head.  You look around, but see no one.  "That
 smarts!"

 You suddenly notice the oak tree wiggling in time to the voice.  You
 peer at the tree, then jump back as some of its branches bend towards
 you.  "Oh, MAN, that's gonna be tender."  One branch tenderly traces
 the carvings in the tree, then jerks away.  "Wooh.  Thanks for the
 help, Terry."

 The tree must see the puzzled look on your face, because he begins
 laughing.  "Surprised, huh?  I bet.  We don't talk to many people these
 days, do we, Phil?"

 You get another shock when the ash tree next to the oak waves its
 branches.  "Wmmf fmm," the ash tree says.

 "Anyway, lissen.  You ever need anything, you let me know.  Okay?"

 "Pffth yrmm," agrees the ash tree.

>take knife

>ask oak about phil
 The oak tree replies, "Oh, me and Phil have been around a while, right,

 "Gbbbz," the ash tree agrees.

 Bubbles wanders away.

>ask oak for staff
 "Oh?" the tree asks.  Then, "oh," he says knowingly.  "Well, I did say
 anything."  There is the sound of rustling branches, then a
 particularly large one comes hurtling to the ground in front of you.
 "I hope you're not plannin' on going after that dragon, though."

>ask oak about dragon

 and deposits a circle of ash branches at your feet.  "Blggg," he says.

 your sight from beasts."

 The pixie polishes one of the toadstools, removing stray debris.

>show staff to pixie
 The pixie says, "No fire will harm you while you hold an oak staff."

>ask pixie about scent
 The pixie claps a hand to his mouth, then grimaces.  "Smell!  I forgot
 to tell how to mask your smell!"  A red flush creeps up his
 green-tinged face.  "Apologies.  Find a stone rubbed smooth by a
 stream.  When rubbed enough, the stone will release scent to mask
 your," he sniffs mightily, "noticeable odor."

 second slap.  Your head slams into the door jamb.

 You fall down, tumbling head-first into a hospital bed.  You gaze

 preventing you from seeing far.  You can, however, see a hill rising to
 the west.  You can walk through the trees and underbrush to the east
 and south.

>go west
 Bottom of Hill
    The south side of a gently-sloping hill.  Scrub grass clings
 tenaciously to its side.  A path from the east divides here and crawls
 up the hill to the north and northwest.

 Top of Hill
    The hill curves away from this spot, crowned on top by a gnarled
 thorn tree. Paths curve down the hill to the west and south.  A passage
 gapes in the side of the hill, leading down.  Far to the north is a
 small white church.

 Cave
    The cave encloses you, reflecting the sound of your breathing.  It

 Rough stairs are cut into one part of the cave, leading to a thin exit

>examine box
 The box is made of seamless metal, marred only by a large handle and a

 thorn tree. Paths curve down the hill to the west and south.  A passage
 gapes in the side of the hill, leading down.  Far to the north is a
 small white church.
    A grey man stands over you, grinning.

 The grey man reaches out and grabs you before you can run.

 Bubbles comes trotting after you.

>examine man
 There is no color to him, an Edward Gorey sketch come to life.  His
 jet-black eyes glitter to either side of an aquiline nose and above an
 outthrust chin.

 Bubbles takes a running fit, tearing around as fast as possible on
 short legs.

 "Why, Terry, what a pleasant surprise!"  The arm gripping you twists
 slightly, pinning you against the grey man.  He squints down at you,
 blinks several times, discomforted by the mild sunlight.  He lashes out
 smoothly with one foot, catching Bubbles by surprise.  Bubbles yipes
 and runs.  "You've been oh so naughty, and your father has sent me to
 punish you."

 You suddenly realize where you had heard the voice from the needled
 sphere.  Your father's voice, nearly choked by his cancer.

>ask man about father
 The grey man tightens his grip on you, preventing you from moving or
 drawing much breath.

 The grey man tightens his arm across your chest.  "Come along, come
 along, I have something special planned!"  He drags you down the hill.

 Bluff
    The hill drops off sharply to the west, overlooking a rocky tumble
 to a kill below.  A worn path leads up to the east and down to the
 southeast.
    The grey man holds you tightly with one arm.

>wait
 Time passes...

 The grey man nods towards the sharp drop-off.  "My, that water looks
 mighty cold," he says, not noticing that his hold on you has loosened.

>push man
 The grey man tightens his grip on you, preventing you from moving or
 drawing much breath.

 "No use waiting any longer," the grey man says.  "Time for you to join
 your faerie friends."  Then the grey man lifts you effortlessly and
 heaves you over the bluff.  The sound of the kill grows louder as it
 rushes up to meet you.

 You jolt upright with the shock of landing.  Instead of water you are
 surrounded by a hospital bed.  The room is empty of people; only
 monitors keep watch over you.  Lassitude overtakes you, and you drop
 into a dreamless sleep....

    The cave encloses you, reflecting the sound of your breathing.  It

>wait

 The grey man nods towards the sharp drop-off.  "My, that water looks

>attack man with knife
 With all your strength you drive the blade of the pocketknife deep into
 the grey man's thigh.  He screams, a high-pitched, reedy sound.  In
 pain, the grey man stumbles over the edge of the bluff.  With one hand
 he claws at the ground; with the other he drags you with him.  In
 desperation you pry his hand free, but not before you have slid after
 him.

 Side of the Bluff
    You are clinging to the side of the bluff almost by your
 fingernails.  Your wild descent has been arrested by an iron cage which
 is caught in some roots.  The grey man has not been so lucky: his body
 lies folded in the kill below.  The top of the bluff is a good ten feet
 above you.

 [Your score has increased by 5 points.]

>SAVE
>cf37
 Saved.

>examine cage
 The iron cage is nearly two meters square.  A cloth has been placed on
 the bottom of the cage.  Faeries are crammed into it, trying
 desperately to avoid the sides of the cage.

 Below you, you glimpse faeries fluttering about the confines of their
 cage.  One notices you.  "Please!" he pleads.  "Help us!"

>open cage
 You lean over the cage and pull open its door.  In an instant, a rush
 of faeries flies past you.  The sudden shift of weight inside the cage
 dislodges it from its perch, sending it tumbling.  You find your hands
 slipping from the tree roots until you fall after the cage, ignored by
 all the faeries.

 All but one.  She glances down, then pauses her upward flight.  She
 gestures and your fall slows.  A bright glow surrounds you, cushioning
 you.  You feel your head strike a rock sharply, laying bare your skull.
 Pain and muzziness vie for control of your attention.  The faerie
 frowns in concentration.  She gestures again, and the glow brightens,
 blinding you.

 Interlude


 White surrounds you, envelops you.  In front of you your father, now an
 old man, sits before a chess board.  He looks up from contemplating his
 next move and glances at you.  He looks back to the board and tips a
 pawn over with deliberation.  Then you are falling, the white closing
 in.

 Interlude, Again


 Hospital Room
    The white ceiling slowly recedes, eventually settling down to a
 reasonable distance.  Mindful of a disorienting dizziness, you turn
 your head slowly from side to side, taking in the sight of a hospital
 room.  The room is dim, its only light the sunlight leaking through the
 window whose curtains are thrown wide.  Equipment surrounds your bed in
 the center of the room.
