  The Price
  You are a merchant. You have plied your wares from the desert to the
  sea; from the grasslands to the mountains, and have made a comfortable
  living for yourself.

  You've just set off in a caravan returning with many trade goods from
  the East, after a very profitable excursion.

  Before we get started, what is your name?
  What would you say has contributed most to your success?

  I take great care in my business dealings. No one gets one over on me.

  The loyalty of my personal guards. They are carefully selected and
  well-paid for their services.

  My skill with a sword. I protect my own goods.

  Words. I have a way of easily swaying others.

  Single-minded dedication. Once I have set my mind to accomplish
  something, I cannot rest until I succeed.
  And you have another aptitude, as well.

  1) A particular shrewdness in the buying and selling of wares.

  2) A larger-than-average contingent of guards.

  3) Significant martial training.

  4) Any task that I begin, I am dedicated to see it through to
  completion.
  But you have a failing...
  1) ...I admit some naivete in arranging business deals with others.
  2) ...I tend to overlook the training and upkeep of my personal guard.
  3) ...I always get distracted, and can never seem to finish things.
  Nobody's perfect.
  ...
  You made arrangements to form a caravan heading back to the familiar
  lands of the west. Before you set off, you took stock of your
  travelling companions:

  Ephraim is familiar; you've traveled with him before. He has made
  this journey to the East in the past, making him unique among your
  group. His skin may be wrinkled and weatherbeaten, but his eyes are
  as sharp as ever. He never misses a deal, or a danger.

  Alexander, son of Asa, is an unfamiliar face, but you've heard of
  him in the few weeks you've spent in this place. Tales of his exploits
  and outburts in local gambling dens and seedier locales quickly made
  him notorious among your small group of outsider mechants, not to
  mention the natives. He looks very young, and seems to wear a
  perpetual scowl.

  Yishai is another matter. Yes, he adorns himself with clothes of many
  different colors; you might even call it ostentatious. But he hides
  his face behind another cloth, and rarely speaks. You spent weeks in
  the city, but until he joined your caravan that morning, you never
  even knew he was in the area.
  ...
  Besides arranging the purchase of your trade goods, how did you spend
  the remainder of your money during your time in the East?

  1) Employing the services of a few extra guards, and obtaining
  higher-quality arms for them.

  2) Entertainment. I may never have a chance to return here; why not
  enjoy my time while I can?

  3) Purchasing additional supplies, and replacing my beasts of burden
  with fresh stock.

  4)  Actually, I saved it. It's important to keep a certain amount of
  wealth in reserve, to always be prepared for future opportunities.

  5) "Remainder?" No, I came here to engage in profitable enterprise,
  and all my funds were devoted to that end.
  After a great deal of haggling, you arrange the following prices:

  Spices and incense for 45 per parcel.

  Cakes of dye and rolls of cloth for 74 each.

  Blocks of valuable metals, jewelry, and other worked goods for 183
  each.

  Precious gems for 308 per stone.
  ...
  At this point, you had 1500 funds available to purchase goods.
  What exactly did you buy?
  1) Spices and incense.

  2) Cloth and dyes.

  3) Metals and jewelry.

  4) Precious gems.
  Exotic dyes and cloths will sell quite well back home. The indigo
  especially will be very valuable.

  And how many of these dyes did you purchase?
  ...
  1) All that I could.

  2) I spent the majority of my funds.

  3) I spent a portion of my funds.

  4) Only one.

  5) Nevermind.
  You spent 370 buying 5 of the dyes.
  Was that your last purchase? Y or N
  Spices and incense for 45 per parcel.

  Cakes of dye and rolls of cloth for 74 each.

  Blocks of valuable metals, jewelry, and other worked goods for 183
  each.

  Precious gems for 308 per stone.
  ...
  At this point, you had 1130 funds available to purchase goods.
  What exactly did you buy?
  1) Spices and incense.

  2) Cloth and dyes.

  3) Metals and jewelry.

  4) Precious gems.
  Gems are a riskier proposition. Their value can fluctuate greatly
  with the fashion of the day, but this can make them much more
  lucrative. However, they're also quite resilient and easy to protect.

  And how many of these gems did you purchase?

  1) All that I could.

  2) I spent the majority of my funds.

  3) I spent a portion of my funds.

  4) Only one.

  5) Nevermind.
  You spent 616 buying 2 of the gems.
  Was that your last purchase?
  Y or N
  Spices and incense for 45 per parcel.

  Cakes of dye and rolls of cloth for 74 each.

  Blocks of valuable metals, jewelry, and other worked goods for 183 each.

  Precious gems for 308 per stone.

  At this point, you had 514 funds available to purchase goods.
  What exactly did you buy?
  There is always demand for spices and incense. You can never seem to
  find enough of it.

  And how many of these spices did you purchase?

  1) All that I could.

  2) I spent the majority of my funds.

  3) I spent a portion of my funds.

  4) Only one.

  5) Nevermind.
  You spent 315 buying 7 of the spices.
  Was that your last purchase?
  And so the caravan set off.
  ...
  You have come to a major crossroads. The southern route winds around
  mountains and along uninhabited sea cliffs, heading nearly backwards
  at several points. The other routes are more direct, especially the
  western one, but the western route cuts through a much more dangerous
  region, while passing through the multiple kingdoms to the north means
  paying many more tolls.
  ...
  1) Take northerly toll road.

  2) Take southerly route along the mountains.

  3) Take western route through the flatlands.

  4) Ask for advice from another merchant.
  Who will you ask?  Ephraim, Alexander, or Yishai?
  "Hmm." He's impossible to read, with his face behind that covering of
  his. "I really can't say."
  ...
  1) Take northerly toll road.

  2) Take southerly route along the mountains.

  3) Take western route through the flatlands.

  4) Ask for advice from another merchant.
  "I recommend the path along the mountains. I took that the last time
  I came through here. Going that way may be slow, but it's safe and
  there are few tolls."

  1) Take northerly toll road.

  2) Take southerly route along the mountains.

  3) Take western route through the flatlands.

  4) Ask for advice from another merchant.
  He looks at you with eyes narrowed as you approach, but says,
  "I'd take the west route. It's the most direct and fastest way
  through."
  1) Take northerly toll road.

  2) Take southerly route along the mountains.

  3) Take western route through the flatlands.
  It's slow going, but your caravan begins winding its way along the
  base of the mountains.
  ...
  Some days later, while traveling during the day, some raised voices
  catch your attention. You make your way out to the center of the group
  to find Alexander arguing with old man Ephraim, something about money.
  Guards from each wagon look on nervously.
  ...
  1) Side with Alexander.

  2) Side with Ephraim.

  3) Do nothing.

  4) Ask "What happened?"
  Yoshai speaks beside you -- you hadn't even noticed he was there.
  "These two were playing a game of chance. Ephraim was about to win,
  and that's when Alexander accused him of cheating."
  ...
  1) Side with Alexander.

  2) Side with Ephraim.

  3) Do nothing.
  He looks at you, exasperated. "I don't understand him!" he says,
  throwing up his hands. "I won fairly!"

  "I don't know the details; I wasn't watching your game. But we have a
  long way to go before our journey is over. I would like to reach home
  before the height of summer. Alexander, will you put this issue aside
  in the name of peace between travellers?"

  His eyes burn with anger, but he says nothing and walks away. Ephraim
  thanks you for your help.
  ...
  The wagons move on.
  ...
  You're awoken from a sound sleep early one midwinter morning by shouts
  from your guards.

  "Flash flood!"
  ...
  You rush outside your wagon to find utter chaos. Whole parcels are
  floating away in the quick-flowing waters, already halfway at the
  bottom of your cart. You've hardly seen any rain so far in your
  journey, but it seems that's not been the case upriver.

  1) Send for help.

  2) Seal the wagons, climb onto them, and wait for the water to
  subside.

  3) Move the caravan to higher ground.
  "It's hopeless, boss." You look at your guards; they're a ragged pair,
  and they seem completely resigned that this attempt will fail.
  ...
  1) Maybe they're right.

  2) Warn them to do this or I'll get my sword.

  3) Convince them.
  "Men, you're our only hope. We might die here, on this day, if we
  don't climb to safety. These animals and supplies offer our only
  chance of surviving the trip back to civilization."

  Something in your impromptu speech seems to have lit a spark.

  You're frankly undermanned for stuch an untertaking. You still order
  your men to help push and move the carts when they get stuck, but you
  can't shake the feeling that it's hopeless. You hardly seem to be
  moving at all.

  In fact, you don't even seem to be climbing higher faster than the
  water is.

  Alexander is clearly upset at the lack of progress.

  1) Send for help.

  2) Seal the wagons, climb onto them, and wait for the water to
  subside.
  You decide to seal up the carts as well as possible, and hope for the
  best. You make do with what you have.
  ...
  It's a terrible scene for the next few hours, and more than once you
  worry that the seal might not hold. But it does, and at last the water
  calms and subsides. Your animals are dead or gone, and some of the
  more delicate goods and supplies are lost or ruined. Yishai seems the
  most upset at his loss. But you're all alive.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 Memories, that fuzzy affair. You're never certain enough how true they
 are to reality. I can?t clearly remember, just an example, what rumours
 said about the McDaniel Mansion. There was something about a stranger
 who came to visit on a cold Autum day many years ago, just before the
 house got abandoned for decades. And then there was the wild
 speculation about monsters in the basement... But the thing I really
 remember from that summer holidays is our  improbable and quite not
 balanced friendship trio.
 There was Doc. Brown, thin, handsome, annoyingly arrogant every now and
 then, always the charismatic. Then there was Rose, shy, with the soft,
 delicate look under her golden hair. The three of us united by the bare
 fact that we were the only people of our age in that too quiet, too
 boring, village, wasting the best of our late teens during the early
 eighties.
 "Now, Mike, I entitle you as Carrier of the Torch" solemny joked Rose
 when giving me the thing that dry, hot late summer evening when, just
 out of having nothing else to do, we decided to play kids and go to
 explore the ruined McDaniel site, as isolated from the rest of the
 village as the village was from the rest of the world...

 Haunted House
 An Interactive Fiction by rockersuke
 Release 1 / Serial number 110507 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Outside of the house
 So there we stood, at the entrance of the old mansion, just the three
 of us and a former elegant door which was as rusty as firmly closed.

 I could see Rose and Doc there.

>examine rose
 I stared at Rose.
 She stared at me.
 After a few awkard seconds she shrugged and said with a soft, shy tone
 "So...?"

 Rose and Doc looked to each other and then at me, as if expecting my
 decission to move on... just I hadn?t a clue what to do next!

>examine doc
 I looked at Doc.
 He looked back at me.
 After a few awkard seconds he abruptely asked with an impatient voice
 "What...?"

 Rose tried in vain to open the door one more time. "So frustrating..."
 she said, "There must be a way..."

>examine self
 As good-looking as ever.


>examine door
 On a closer look, there was a crumpled piece of paper showing under the
 door. I wondered how much time it had been there and why no one had
 taken it before...

 Doc asked "Where did that piece of paper come from?"

 Doc bumped strongly into the door... didn?t work. "Oh boy!" He
 exclaimed, "They did make it to stand against intruders!"
>inventory
 I was carrying:
   a torch

 Rose looked puzzled at the paper...

 Rose tried in vain to open the door one more time. "So frustrating..."
 she said, "There must be a way..."

>read paper
 Doc said "Cm'on Mike, don't be afraid to take it... I bet it won't bite
 you!"

 Doc asked "Where did that piece of paper come from?"

 Rose and Doc looked to each other and then at me, as if expecting my
 decission to move on... just I hadn?t a clue what to do next!

>take paper
 Taken.



>read paper
 There was some handwritten text in the old paper. "Magic word, say:
 PL..." no... "PLE"... wait, "PLO"...
  Damn, I couldn't understand that. Paper was so crumbled and the
 handwritting was so old-fashioned and weird...
 Suddenly Doc took the paper off from my hands with a mocking remark
 "You! silly mikie, didn't they teach you to read properly? Lemme see
 "Magic word: say PL..."
 I wouldn't allow that. I was used to his disdainful jokes in front of
 Rose, but enough was enough. I removed the paper from him with an
 abrupt gest, and then...
 ... then, showing a side of herself neither Doc nor me had ever seen
 before, Rose took it away from me with an exhasperated look "Cm'on
 kids! Will you at least try to fake some mature behaviour in the
 presence of a lady! Let's see, Magic word: say... PLUGH"
 ...and then... PLOF!
 ...she just dissapeared in a cloud of smoke. Before we could react, her
 scream could be heard from somewhere inside the house. Doc just kicked
 the door, which opened with a suspicious ease now, and hurried into the
 mansion, so worried to show he was in charge that he forgot I was
 carrying the torch. I followed, but could only be aware, to my regret,
 that the door violently had slammed itself just as we entered, and
 then... no Doc, no Rose, just me and the dark...

 Darkness

 It was pitch dark, and I couldn't see a thing.

>inventory
 I was carrying:
   a torch

>examine torch
 It was pitch dark, and I couldn't see a thing.

>turn on torch
 I switched the torch on.

 Foyer
 Under the dim torch light, the house seemed to scream its whole
 desolation all of a sudden. Everywhere I turned it was just an
 unrecognisable, deformed, amount of dust and spider webs with some
 unidentifiable pieces of furniture beneath. I guessed I was in the
 foyer, and there seemed to be some kind of ways south, east and west.

>go east
 I began to move on... but I started to see all kind of blurry images.
 Iridiscent snaps of Doc and Rose going frantically from one place to
 another. Fuzzy, nervous, fragmented shots of an unordered story I was
 witnessing as in a sci-fi movie hologram. I tried to call them, but
 they wouldn?t listen. I moved to reach them, but their images just
 would go through things, through walls, through me... As soon as they
 appeared they would vanish. Perhaps those were images of events that
 took place there, but not then, or they might had been happening then,
 but not there...

>examine images
 I couldn't see any such thing.

>yell
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>look
 Foyer
 I was in the foyer.
 I could go south, east and west from here.


>go west

 East end of hall
 I was in a hall. It was huge, and it seemed I was in its east end. I
 coud go north, east, to the foyer, and west.


>SAVE

>go north

 Green bedroom
 Green walls, green bed, everything green, as if someone had put a green
 ribbon before my eyes.That was the green bedroom.
 I could go south, to the east end of the hall, and west.


>examine bed
 It was green.

>look under bed
 I found nothing of interest.

>search bed
 I found nothing of interest.

>go south

 I was in the east end of a hall.I coud go north, to the green bedroom,

>go west

 West end of hall
 That was the other end of the huge hall.  Exits were north, south,to a
 door, and east, to the east end of the hall.


>go north

 Blue bedroom
 Blue walls, blue bed, blue everything, as if someone had tinted the
 world in blue. I was in a blue bedroom.
 I could go south, to the west end of the hall, and east.


>examine bed
 It was blue.

>examine blue
 It was blue.

>go east

 Secret passage
 I entered a claustrophobic narrow corridor which seemed to have acted
 as some kind of secret connection long ago. Suddenly, I saw Doc's image
 coming to me from the opposite end. He stopped in the middle and took a
 rope that, I noticed then, was lying forgotten on the floor. He
 cheerfully shouted "Ha! just what I needed!" and the vision just ended
 there...
 The corridor leaded east, to the green bedroom, and west, to the blue
 bedroom.


>look

 I was in a secret passage.
 The corridor leaded east, to the green bedroom, and west, to the blue

 I could go south, to the west end of the hall, and east, into the

 I was in the west end of a hall. Exits were north, to the blue bedroom,
 south,to a door, and east, to the east end of the hall.


>examine door
 It was closed.

>open door
 It seemed to be locked.

>go east

 I was in the east end of a hall.I coud go north, to the green bedroom,

 .


>go east

 Foyer
 I was in the foyer.
 I could go south, east and west, to the east end of hall, from here.


>go east

 Living room
 I could figure out that was the living room. Right after entering there
 I had one of those strange visions again. That one was such a nonsense
 it could easily had been ripped off from a cartoon. It was Doc running
 while beeing chased by a levitating knife. Even in an eerie environment
 like that I could laugh at it, but then, I was so scared...
 There seemed to be exits east and west, to the foyer.

>pray
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>sing
 No, no,  I didn?t do that... did I? Well, I can imagine I did anyway...
 So I sung. Felt silly. Didn?t help at all.

>go east

 Dining room
 That had to be the dining room. I was surprised by a quick vision of
 Rose, like a flash, writting something with her finger on the dust that
 layed over a big old wodden table.
 Exits leaded south and west, to the living room.


>examine table
 Written in the layer of dust I could read the word "UPSTAIRS"... Was
 Rose trying to send me a message?

>clean table
 I achieved nothing by this.

>look under table
 I found nothing of interest.

>go south
 The layout of the place clearly resembled a kitchen. As soon as I
 entered Rose's mirage was walking to the middle of the room. There lied
 a bucket of water. In an instant, just like in a nightmare where you
 feel something horrible is about to happen for no reason, I knew she
 was going to drink from it. In an instant I knew, as if I had seen the
 whole scene before, it was deadly poisonous. I yelled at her:

 "No! Don't do that!"

 ...and she stoped her arm, as if she had heard me. She looked
 everywhere, as if searching the source of the warning. Soon the whole
 image dissapeared as before.

 Kitchen
 I was in the kitchen.
 There were exits north, to the dining room, south, and west.


>examine kitchen sink
 I couldn't see any such thing.

>examine bucket
 I couldn't see any such thing.

>look
 Kitchen
 I was in the kitchen.
 There were exits north, to the dining room, south, and west.


>go west

 Den
 Somehow I knew I was in the den, and then I retraced my steps when I
 saw Doc's image gangway through it... chased by a suit of armour. That
 was so crazy I thought I felt better when the vision just dissapeared.
 I could go north, to the foyer, and east, to the kitchen.


>go east

 Kitchen
 I was in the kitchen.
 There were exits north, to the dining room, south, and west, to the
 den.


>go south

 Breakfast room
 I thought I got it then... Rooms were actually undistinguishable from
 each other in that overwhelming dust and web mess, but somehow I
 clearly knew where I was, just like if... I really had that crazy
 feeling, the house itself was showing me around its well guarded
 secrets. I was in a breakfast room at that moment. Exits were north, to
 the kitchen and east.


>go east

 Servant's quarters
 I was in the servant's quarters. There was a closed cabinet in one
 wall. I could go west, to the breakfast room.

>open cabinet
 I opened the cabinet... I saw a key inside... and then I almost had a
 heart attack!
 I suddenly saw a shiny female hand just erupting from my own chest. It
 was Rose's image going through my flesh as if I wasn't there at all.
 She grabbed the key. I could see her curious gesture while examining
 it. She went away with it, her ghostly vision vanishing as fast as she
 appeared. Even when I was shocked to death, I couldn?t help some warm
 feeling. Somehow she had just been inside me... so close...

>look in cabinet
 The cabinet was empty.

>look
 Servant's quarters
 I was in the servant's quarters. There was  an open cabinet in one
 wall. I could go west, to the breakfast room.

>go west

 Breakfast room
 I was in the breakfast room. Exits were north, to the kitchen and east,
 to the servant's quarters.


>go north
 I could see the bucket of water again on the kitchen's floor. Behind,
 Rose's dissolved image was coming from the opposite side. She looked so
 different this time... decades older. Her golden hair turned into a
 silver untidy mane. She kneeled before the bucket and aimed her arm to
 pick it. I screamed again:

 "No, Rose! Don't drink from it!"

 ...and, for a few seconds, she looked directly to where I was, her eyes
 loaded with such vast, infinite sadness, as if she had been roaming the
 house for an eternity trying in vain to find an escape... all hope
 lost. She stared at me so firmly I hadn?t a chance to notice she had
 grabbed the bucket and moved it to her mouth. She drunk the liquid
 inside it without hesitation. In a moment, her body softly fell without
 a sound, without a sign of pain. When I reacted, she was lying as a
 broken doll. When I reached her, she was no longer there...

 Was that our true destiny? Had I foreseen the way it all would
 definitivey end for us... for her?

 Kitchen
 I was in the kitchen.
 There were exits north, to the dining room, south, to the breakfast
 room, and west, to the den.


 I could see a crumbled piece of paper there.

>get paper

 It suddenly became pitch dark.

 Time passed.

 Darkness

 It was pitch dark, and I couldn't see a thing.

>go north
 I had an urge to search for my friends, but was also so scared that my
 legs wouldn?t move if I couldn?t see where I was heading to.

>turn on torch
 I switched the torch on.

 West end of hall
 I was in the west end of a hall. Exits were north, to the blue bedroom,
 south,to a door, and east, to the east end of the hall.


>open door
 I felt that warm feeling again. A light flowing out from myself as I
 saw Rose's ghostly hand unlocking the door with the key she took from
 the cabinet. Somehow I knew then that our fate was not sealed to stay
 in the house forever. It didn't matter how much we were apart in space
 or time, we were working it out all together. We would find a way...

>go south
 (first opening the door)
 Master bedroom
 The master bedroom... I could see a bed. Exits were north, to the hall,
 and east.


>examine bed
 I wasn't sure what could have happened to it, light was so dim and
 there was that continous dust and cobweb mess... but it looked like it
 had been burnt a long time ago.

>look under bed
 I found nothing of interest.

>search bed
 I found nothing of interest.

>enter bed
 That was not something I could enter.

>get on bed
 That was not something I could enter.

>go east
 OH MY GOD, IT BURNS!!!

 I got paralysed when I heard Rose desperate cry. Then I saw her
 brilliant image coming from the east, her clothes in flames! She ran
 blindly into the bed and then I saw the bed engulfed in a giant ball of
 consuming fire. Soon there was nothng but the darkness and the burnt
 rests of the bed.

>look
 Master bedroom
 I was in the master bedroom. Exits were north, to the hall, and east.


>go east

 Library
 Deformed shelves suggested that was once a library. Leaned against a
 wall a wodden ladder reached into a gap in the ceiling which once
 belonged to a working trapdoor.

>go up
 I carefully began to step into the ladder when Doc's vision entered the
 library. He dropped the rope I saw before right under the hole. It
 magically raised itself to the ceiling while he cheerfully exclaimed
 "TA-DAA, beat that, silly Mikie!" and quickly began to make a skillfull
 rope climbing exhibition.
 I knew he wasn't actually there, but couldn't help answering "Now, Mr.
 know-it-all, what's so wrong with using a ladder to go upstairs?"
 He was talking to himself, but  the timing was so surprisingly precise
 that I could swear he was adressing me while both of us were reaching
 upside "Yeah, yeah... I wonder who the hell was the moron who screwed
 the ladder..."
 ...
 ...Oops! I realized then that the wodden ladder was so rotten that it
 was on the verge of collapsing under my weight. I desperately jumped
 towards the ceiling hole, miraculously reaching upstairs in the last
 moment before the ladder turned into a pile of shreds on the lower
 floor... That was close...!

 Dimly lit room
 I was in a dimly lit room upstairs. Some light entered from the
 corridor to the west, but it wasn't still enough to move without the
 torch.
 Exits leaded east, to a door, west, to a corridor, and down.

>examine door
 I saw nothing special about the door.

>open door
 It seemed to be locked.

>go west
 I entered a corridor... and then hell broke loose. It all seemed a
 scene from a medieval fantasy film. I saw... that was it... an army of
 ghosts. They were just an undescriptible legion of formless shadows I
 could just refer as ghosts. At the other end of the corridor Doc stood
 defiantly carrying a shining sword "Now, minions of hell, you're going
 to taste my ghost slayer blade" and with a barbarian-like howl he
 charged against them all... smashing them apart while he kept running.
 "Wait..." I thought. Perhaps he got too carried away, as he didnt stop
 in the corridor and entered the room in an unstoppable rush which lead
 him directly to the trapdoor hole...
 "Yiaaaahhh...!! CRASH!!
 "Ouch... That must have hurt!!" I thought, and looked into the hole to
 see Doc's shiny vision lying on the floor below... in time to see
 Rose's fuzzy image running towards him...
 "It's okay, it's okay" he said "It's been just some scrapes... You're
 not to worr..." But she wouldn't let him finish. Giving away a side of
 herself I would never wanted to see, she embraced him tenderly until
 they both merged in a long, passionate kiss.

 And I knew then, beeing the unsuspected witness of their privacy, that
 as certain as there was a real world outside of the house, any wish,
 any hope I had concerning Rose would never, ever, fit in it.

 Their images vanished again as I realized they were stuck downstairs,
 and if there were an exit to the house it was on my side, so it was up
 to me to find it and eventually come back to their rescue.

>look
 Dimly lit room
 I was in a dimly lit room.
 Exits leaded east, to a door, west, to a corridor, and down.

>go west

 I was in a corridor. Light entered from a near balcony.
 I could see a bedroom to the north, a dimly lit room to the east, and a
 balcony to the west

 Upstairs bedroom
 I was in a bedroom.
 I could go south, to the corridor.

 I could see a bed and a drawer (closed) there.

>open drawer
 I opened the drawer, revealing a pile of correspondence and a handful
 of press clippings.

>take all
 bed: Taken.
 drawer: Taken.
 pile of correspondence: Taken.
 handful of press clippings: Taken.

>read correspondence
 Lots of invoices and receipts dated up to the mid fifties addressed to
 some Shirley McDaniel. Latest envelope seems to be a handwritten
 letter.

>read letter
 A handwriten letter dated November 1956. It talks about not beeing
 afraid from scandals, about finding a way to live together, about pure
 love agony... the way just old styled love letters could do. I felt I
 got it then. Somehow I knew what was all about with that stranger who
 came to visit a cold Autum day many years ago, just before the house
 got abandoned... Somehow I just knew what was going on with all that
 madness... As in response, I could hear the door of the trapdoor room
 creaking open... as if the house was inviting me to a rendezvous with
 its final inner secret.

>lie on bed
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>inventory
 I was carrying:
   a handful of press clippings
   a pile of correspondence
   a drawer (open)
     a handwritten letter
   a bed
   a crumbled piece of paper
   a torch (providing light)

>read clippings
 Society news from the mid fifities regarding Shirley McDaniel, heiress
 of the McDaniel fortune.

>burn bed with torch
 I only understood you as far as wanting to burn the bed.

>put bed in drawer
 I put the bed into the drawer.

>go south

 corridor
 I was in a corridor. Light entered from a near balcony.
 I could see a bedroom to the north, a dimly lit room to the east, and a
 balcony to the west

>go west
 I was in a balcony Couldn't say wether it was day or night, as the
 cloudy sky colour was just... unnatural. I gazed down to see Rose's
 corpse impaled at the iron gate in the house entrance. In a horror
 reflect, I moved back to the corridor.
>go west
 I didn't want to see. But I had to be sure. I stepped into the balcony
 once again and... there were two corpses of Rose impaled at the iron
 gate. Two different dead bodys in different dead postures. I went back
 again.

>go west
 Then I saw 3 impaled Roses and one Doc hunging from a nearby tree. I
 blinked... and suddenly all surrounding trees were full of hunged Docs.
 Gruesome. I entered the house again.

>go west
 I was just loosing my mind, as I went into the balcony again and again
 untill a mountain of dead Roses and Docs filled the hrizon. Suddenly
 the horror was gone, as I had the strong feeling  that somehow the
 house, or whoever was inside, was just doing its best to suggest me
 that jumping from the balcony was not a safe way of leaving. Well,
 black humour was also to be considered.
>SAVE
>cf3
 Enter saved game to store: Ok.

>jum
 That's not a verb I recognise.

>jump
 No, no,  I didn?t do that... did I? Well, I can imagine I did anyway...
 So I jumped. Felt silly. Didn?t help at all.

>jump off balcony
 I only understood you as far as wanting to jump.

>jump off balcony

 Dimly lit room
 I was in a dimly lit room.
 Exits leaded east, to a door, west, to a corridor, and down.

>go east

 Attic
 Darkness returned, but somehow I could clearly see a window which I
 guessed showed the landscape of another world. I was afraid to look
 into it, thinking that just gazing there would get me lost forever. A
 pale blue presence was floating all over the room. So overwhelming
 itself I think I lost my consciousness for a while. When I came back I
 was greeted by a female voice...

 "Hello there... you're an unwellcome guest, and my name is Indy".

 I was so shaken and exhausted after all the previous sequence of
 surrealist nightmares that I just wasn't aware, or couldn't care less,
 if I sounded too casual given the circumstances.

 "Indy for Indiana? Indy for independent? Indy as in...

 "...Indigo"

 And I was still surrounded by the dark, but was just like her voice
 made the whole room change its colour.

 I could see a window and Indigo there.

>examine indigo
 I looked at her, and just like she could read my mind she answered to
 what I was thinking...
 "No, I don't know what happened to Shirley McDaniel. I just came here
 after she and her lover flew away. As far as I know, their love story
 could have ended tragically, or perhaps they are now a happy couple
 spending the best of their old age at a hippie farm in Ibiza island.
 Dunno. You know, we just search for empty houses.
 "We?" I was surprised...
 "No, no, it's just me here" I thought she was smiling "I meant my
 people tend to settle in abandoned places "cause they are the best to
 give time a chance, to forget, maybe forgive, whichever happened,
 whatever they did to us...
 And I didn't see it, but I could sense her finger pointing close to my
 nose while she firmly stated
 "And-don't-even-think-of-asking-me-what-it-was.

>examine window
 No, I dared not...

>inventory
 I was so mesmerized under Indigo's presence that I could only exmine
 her intensely.

>examine indigo
 She was a formless blue shadow, but I felt I could reimaginate her the
 way I wanted. I thought I could think of her as an atractive woman. At
 that point, I realized that what I saw between Rose and Doc had stroke
 me harder than what I would like to recognize. I felt miserable. She
 noticed.
 "Your friends have suffered no harm at all. We use to play tricks with
 unwanted visitor's imagination to make sure they don't even consider
 coming back. Other than that, everything was real...
 ...
 "Ow, sorry..." She added on realizing I didn't want to hear that last
 one.

>ask her what it was
 I didn't understand that sentence.

>give correspondence to indigo
 I was so mesmerized under Indigo's presence that I could only exmine
 her intensely.

>examine indigo
 I tried to discern a form in her formless shadowy blue image. I
 advanced towards her, and then, even as she was just like a cloud, I
 could hear her nervous step back on the floor. I had the craziest of
 all ideas. I extended my arm, and I could sense the anxiety, the
 loneliness... and then the cold, the death...

 ...and for the very first time in my life, I was slapped by a ghost.

 Not only slapped as beeing hit in your cheek, but also as beeing
 grabbed in the air, literally kicked in the ass, and thrown away by a
 closed window.
 First I panicked, about the other world sighting and that stuff. I
 closed my eyes, but soon I couldn't help opening them again and I saw I
 was landing into the entrance of the house, where Rose and Doc were
 just dumbstruck watching my freefall from the first floor.
 ...CRASH!
 "..Ouch! That must have hurt!" Rose's comforting voice received me
 before Doc's strident comment ruined it all "Oh! you silly Mikie, I
 thought you would throw yourself through a window just if someone
 suggested you to do, now I know you would do it even if no one told you
 so!

 And that was all about the house mystery; there was no mystery at all,
 at least not the way I thought about mysteries since then. The mansion
 was abandoned when rich heiress powerful dumb airhead Shirley McDaniel
 fell in love with a married man. There were no monsters in the
 basement, but I met a ghost in the attic. She happened to be just a
 random squatter called Indigo, and was there for the same reason ghosts
 like to roam quiet isolated places. They are empty, giving them time to
 heal whatever wounds tie them to the wrong side of the after-life...
 alone...
 Rose and Doc helped me to stand, each to one side of me, while my leg
 hurted like hell, just a bad sprain. I enjoyed that brief moment in the
 centre of our improbable friendship trio, whose balance, I knew then,
 was as close to an irreversible end as summer itself... The following
 days we had trouble discerning real events from ghost pranks. Now I'm
 not sure which part of it all is a real memory and which my own
 recreation. I like it that way.



     *** END ***



 Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last
 command?

  I'm falling down. Not very far from the "ground", fortunately for me.
  Some thick, heavy ropes are softening my falling. I've probably missed
  my step, because I'm absent-minded most of the time now.

  Choice: Stand up.
  I've felt depressed so many years that I can't stand it any longer.
  Besides, my current residence and occupation is endangering my sanity
  and health more and more...

  The blue ocean, spreading endlessly toward the north, the east, the
  south and the west, is reflecting the sun like a glittering chainmail.

  "Hey Francimi bastard! Come here!", they shout.

  Surrounded by those Scottani and Iricimi strangers, I don't feel at
  ease in this place. Their green and dark-orange helmets make me
  nervous. I don't really need to obey, they're just basic sailors like
  me. But could I bear the insults?

  * Rebel: 3

  * Wait: 13

  * Jump into the sea

  * or look around on the ship, fleeing cowardly to the 5
  They are a bunch of six mariners. They're just having fun after all.

  * But I can give them a fair correction: 23

  * Or I can crawl back to the safety of the upper deck: 5
  Some trained, numerous sailors are certainly stronger than a poor
  wanderer who has always lived on the ground, between the local library
  and the university.

  * They throw me off-board to the 17
  I dive into the dark water. Soon I feel so alone that I stop
  breathing.

  * Drown deeper to the 14

  Death can be sweet, when it's so blue!

  The captain, arriving a moment later, feels sorry for his men's rude
  behavior. Bowing deeply, he requests my opinion on the route to take.
  Am I dreaming? Is he insane? Or maybe it's just a sick pity.

  Should we head:

  * North, to our original the destination, the New Continent: 11

  * South, to reach a little island he's just discovered with his
  telescope: 30

  * West, to explore more the vast blue Ocean: 43

  * East, back to our land of departure: 24
  We head toward a strange island, a lone trail of yellow, backgrounded
  by green cliffs high above the beach. Once I arrive on the sand, I
  find a closed bottle on the ground. There is an old parchment inside.

  * Examine the bottle and its content: 26

  * Explore the island: 15

  * Go back to the boat: 11
  "Dear traveler,
  thank you for being in my game. I hope you don't feel too restricted
  there, and your freedom of thoughts is not challenged. This short
  story may really begin when you'll arrived back into civilisation.
  Don't expect to discover much in those deserted islands. And if by
  chance you meet Jacqueline, say Hello to her."

  * With some peace of mind and forgetting the luring greenness of the
  mountain, I row back to the boat: 11
  Impassive to the human's emotions, the ship is reaching the morning
  mists of the other continent. Setting my foot on the pier for the
  first time after three weeks of spiritual torture, I feel deezy and
  completely at loss. There is a big poster on the grey wall, and an
  exit to the rest of the town.

  * Read the poster: 27

  * Exit: 25
  The most notable thing in this place is a poster printed on an indigo
  background. Some big, pink letters are saying:

  "JOIN THE ARMY OF LOVE(TM)!

  The Indigo Love Syndicate(tm) needs you. Thank you for your
  attention."

  There is no clear way to contact them. Probably they became so
  powerful recently that it's easy to find them. We'll see!

  * Tear the poster apart: 8

  * Pray in front of this colorful and appeasing poster: 36

  * Exit immediately: 25
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
  minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
  aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
  reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
  pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in
  culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

  I pray in collusion with all the followers of the Indigo Love
  Syndicate.
  I fell that my soul is somehow tainted now.

  * I continue nevertheless into the town: 22
  This city is bigger than the standard we can expect on the Old
  Continent. Huge, pompous, airships are crossing the airs, but also a
  few aeroplanes, more than in Euralinia.

  The houses there are wealthier, with influences from the far eastern
  cities of Asinalia, denoting a strong taste for delicate yet powerful
  ornaments. I don't really like this at all.

  What can I do now?

  * Meet the local authorities, to announce myself and be registered: 44

  * Learn more about the customs and traditions: 33
  After a few researchs in the libraries and museum, I discover this
  society was founded one thousand years ago, after its physical
  separation from the Old Continent. It grew at a normal pace, without
  any noticeable events. More worrying is the fact that 10 years ago, a
  new sect, called the Indigo Love Syndicate, spread quickly across the
  continent, both among the populace and the elite. Discrete at the
  beginning, the sect is now one of the major political power in place.

  * I can join the opposition, to discover if they are better than what
  they pretend to fight: 9

  * I can forget about all those conspiracy stuffs, and lead a normal
  life, searching for a normal job: 52
  The opposition is full of nice persons, however, I can't garantee the
  leaders are politically clean. Some people claims they're even
  infiltrated by the Indigo Love Syndicate.

  Am I lucky today? When I get a die out of my pocket, I can be
  considered lucky when I cast a 5 or 6.

  Cast a die (in the case I don't have one in my pocket at the moment)

  * If I'm lucky: 32

  * If I'm not lucky: 49
  Someone sold me, while doing an important mission: I was supposed to
  meet an Indigo Love Syndicate leader, and capture him, but it was
  probably a trap, and I was captured instead.

  * Go to jail: 48

  After a few years as a prisoner, I am more reasonnable, and seek
  redemption when I'm free again. Probably the best for me is to travel
  back home, and begin a new life there. Will I be librarian, or
  adventurer there? I still can't decide.

  THE END
  I'm falling down. Not very far from the "ground", fortunately for me.

 Ms. Henderson's Third-grade Classroom

 The large classroom is open and airy.  On one wall is the chalkboard
 with the remnants of today's math lesson (fractions...yuck!).  Just to
 the side of the chalkboard is Ms. Henderson's desk.  Much of the space
 is taken up with the desks that face the front.  In the back are the
 closet and the art area.

 On the big wooden easel are a green paint, an orange paint, a yellow
 paint, a red paint, a blue paint, and a paint box.  The tommy's box
 contains an indigo paint.

 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.

 Years ago, a witch placed you in this tower and arranged for your
 upkeep, paying certain villagers well to keep you supplied with the
 most basic necessities, and no more.

 Your years in the tower have changed you.  You are more or less a grown
 woman now, with hair nearly to the floor.  Your skills have developed
 as far as solitude and tedium can take them.  You are ready to leave.

 Take your time.

 (New players may wish to type ABOUT.)

 Kitchen
 A fire burns in the fireplace and a few basic kitchen things are still
 lying around.  The plank staircase spirals up to the room above, while
 a much older, darker, stone staircase descends to the storeroom below.

 You see a withered apple and a cauldron here.

>examine apple
 The skin has drawn in close and wrinkled; the flesh has turned to meal.
 A month of age clings to it, making it ugly and useless.

>about
 This game was created for Speed-IF Indigo, which challenged authors to
 create a piece somehow loosely related to the idea of indigo while
 using a programming language they haven't published in before.

 I only had a couple of afternoons to give this project, and there's
 lots I would like to have done better.  As with all speed-IF, this is
 an unfinished design with minimal implementation.

 Still, it was a fun time, and I owe a lot to Eric Eve's manuals and
 tour guide for making it possible to implement even as much as I was
 able to here, given that I was coming to the language as an almost
 complete novice.

 It is possible to make the game unfinishable, but typically only by
 destroying an object.  It should be immediately obvious when an object
 is destroyed.  Hints are available, though like everything else, they
 may be flawed.

 Finally: if in doubt about removing one object from another, try TAKE.
 Other variations ('get foo from bar', 'remove foo from bar', etc.) are
 not necessarily as well accounted-for as they should be.

>examine cauldron
 A heavy iron cauldron, with a lid.  It's closed.

>examine me
 You have fifteen years, two months, twelve days, five hours, and one
 minute.  You can spare none of this.

 Besides this, your most notable endowment is your hair.

>examine hair
 Your hair grows down to your feet.  Its natural color is blonde, nearly
 white, but you have dyed it a deep rippling blue.

>examine apple
 The skin has drawn in close and wrinkled; the flesh has turned to meal.
 A month of age clings to it, making it ugly and useless.

>open cauldron
 Opening the cauldron reveals an unfinished potion.

 There's a strong smell of rotten eggs.

>examine potion
 A potion with weeks of age on it.  It is not done yet, however.
 Another month should finish it: its purpose is to fortify the hair,
 make it strong and glossy and unbreakable.

>eat potion
 The thought of tasting it in its current form makes you gag.  It's
 astonishing how much age can convert the texture and scent of such a
 brew.

>wait one month
 The story doesn't understand that command.

>put one minute in cauldron
 The word "minute" is not necessary in this story.

 (If this was an accidental misspelling, you can correct it by typing
 OOPS followed by the corrected word now.  Any time the story points out
 an unknown word, you can correct a misspelling using OOPS as your next
 command.)

>go up
 You clatter up the stairs.

 Blue Tower
 This compact turret has been your home for the last ten years, and the
 walls are covered and re-covered in the images you've painted there.

 There is a window in the curving south wall, and stone stairs spiral
 down into the body of the tower.

 Under the low bed are a small wooden box and a chamber pot.

 The rotten-egg smell diminishes.

>examine images
 The pictures show a sky in transition from day to night: on one side,
 puffy clouds and birds are visible, while the sky opposite is dark and
 starry.

 It's all taken a very large amount of blue dye.  What lies there now is
 a decade of work.

>paint rainbow
 The word "rainbow" is not necessary in this story.

>sing
 The word "sing" is not necessary in this story.

>examine box
 A rough box, somewhat the worse for wear.  It's closed.

>examine pot
 It's a cheap clay pot with the most humble of purposes.  You empty it
 yourself, except when saving the contents to make dye.  The ground
 outside under the window is well fertilized.

>open box
 Opening the small wooden box reveals a stub of candle, a comb, some
 shears, and a stained paintbrush.

>look out window
 (first trying to open the window)
 The single pane opens and shuts, to be sure, but that does you little
 good at the moment.  If you're leaving, you'll need to get the whole
 thing open.

>throw pot at window

 The chamber pot hits the window without any obvious effect, and falls
 to the floor.

 they travel among crisp autumnal skies.  That way you hint at seasons
 as well as day/night, in your little composition.

>use pot
 The word "use" is not necessary in this story.

>examine clouds
 The sky as seen from your window is rarely so idyllic, but those
 occasional fall days are worth commemorating.

 paintbrush).

>examine shears
 Cold iron shears, still sharp enough to do their business.

>take shears

>examine paintbrush
 A makeshift construct of hair (your own) and string and stick.  These
 never last long.  This is your most recent brush, the bristles stained
 deep blue and never washed clean.

>examine candle
 The remains of a cheap candle.  You rarely use such indulgences.  It
 has burned down almost to nothing, however: an hour's use is enough to
 exhaust one of these things.

 You can't go that way.  Obvious exits lead south; and down, back to the
 kitchen.

 This thing is far past its prime.  A month ago it would have been good

>go down
 You descend the familiar stairs, keeping one hand on the wall for

 It takes several attempts, but in the end you manage to take the hour
 between your fingernails and tease it away from the candle with no
 tearing or disruption.

 What remains behind is a whole candle, unburnt.

 There's a strong smell of rotten eggs.

 Store Room
 The clammy uncomfortable space under the stairs is not pleasant enough
 to live in, but it does keep roots and stores cool.

 Under the stone stairs are some indigo cuttings.

 The rotten-egg smell diminishes.

>take cuttings
 Taken.

>examine cuttings
 It grows by your tower, and you've convinced a few of your suppliers to
 bring you quantities of the stuff.

 To make dye of this stuff requires another supply you have in plenty:
 stale piss.  No need to make another batch today, but you have used up
 many days with the occupation.

 You stroke your fingers lightly over the wall, seeking purchase.
 Pinch.  Pull.

 The decade pulls away, the mural rapidly cycling backward, showing
 again the layers in which it was painted: the sky overlies a forest,
 the forest is painted over a garden, the garden you drew when you first
 moved here in childish strokes of charcoal on the wall.

 Then it's all gone.  The wall is whitewashed and pristine, and the
 decade hangs in your hands.

>get decade from  panes
 The decade isn't in that.

 You lower the decade - carefully, carefully! - into your hair, touching
 nothing else.  Your scalp crawls as though infested and there is a

 this when the seeds work their way up in the spring?)  But your hair
 grows and grows and grows, pooling around your feet in astounding

 It's a perilous climb, but worthwhile.

 Once, long ago, you went the opposite way by ladder; then the good
 townsfolk took the ladder away and left you behind.  And they kept your
 secret for you well, saying nothing to the lord seeking you.

 (He had desired to take his wife to bed a virgin every night.)

 Folded on a nearby rock, neat as an old garment returned by the
 washerwoman, are the seventy years you put aside when you entered this
 tower.

 You take a moment to trap several woodland creatures and cover yourself
 with their carcasses, patchwork-Tauntaun style. Comfortable inside
 their warmth, you wait several long minutes in thoughtful silence until
 the drizzle finally abates. Hooray.

 You jump up and fling off your beastly blanket, ready to explore this
 wondrously damp new world. The first thing you do is to climb up a
 nearby mountain to take a good look around.

 Beautiful Vista
 Wow, what a view! I guess it took a bit longer to climb that mountain
 than you had thought, as you are now overlooking a beautiful, lush
 valley. How green is your valley? Pretty damn.

>go down
 Having had your fill of beauty for the day, you jump off the nearest
 ledge. Some time later, it occurs to you that may have not been the
 brightest idea.

 Falling Like A Rock
 You are falling through the air. Far (but increasingly less far) below
 you is a curious thing you'd wager is the ground. It is fast
 approaching, but at least you're sure to make a good impression.

>inventory
 You take stock of your inventory and are reminded once again of your
 great stores of ingenuity and tenacity, making you feel much better
 about the situation at hand. Lest we forget, though, you also have a
 jetpack.

 Anyhoo, you deploy the jetpack's thrusters and float yourself over to
 a...

 Triple Rainbow
 You are flying up in the sky next to a triple rainbow. You'd
 acknowledge the impossibility of the situation if you didn't find it
 just so profoundly moving. All of its colors dance before you, but you
 find the shimmering spectral indigo particularly enticing.

>eat rainbow
 I can't see any Rainbow here.

>go
 I don't understand.

>go soul
 You enter the indigo light. Almost immediately, you gain total serenity
 and vast amounts of wisdom, completely understanding mankind's
 struggles and our place in the grand scheme of things. You find
 yourself so enlightened that you never go back to civilization.

 You have won the game!

 THE SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF THE INDIGO VIOLET
 From the reminiscences of John H. Watson
    adapted by David Fletcher

 "I do not think, Watson," said my friend, "that you have ever placed
 before the
 public the facts of the case we investigated in the year 18--, in which
 the
 indigo violet was so deeply concerned."

 "Indeed not," I replied.

 "The case was a simple one, of course, but --"

 "Simple, Holmes!" I expostulated. "Really I do not see how it could be
 called
 simple."

 "Exceptionally so in one respect, Watson: that only the killer was
 discovered
 to have been lying. The other witnesses recounted the facts with a
 pleasing
 exactitude and honesty."

 I recalled that Holmes, after a brief examination of the scene, had
 asked the
 persons concerned only about each other and about those few rooms and
 items
 that were involved, and yet by the application of his remarkable
 deductive
 faculty had soon been able to accuse the guilty person.

 THE SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF THE INDIGO VIOLET
 From the reminiscences of John H. Watson
    adapted by David Fletcher

 "I do not think, Watson," said my friend, "that you have ever placed
 before the
 public the facts of the case we investigated in the year 18--, in which
 the
 indigo violet was so deeply concerned."

 "Indeed not," I replied.

 "The case was a simple one, of course, but --"

 "Simple, Holmes!" I expostulated. "Really I do not see how it could be
 called
 simple."

 "Exceptionally so in one respect, Watson: that only the killer was
 discovered
 to have been lying. The other witnesses recounted the facts with a
 pleasing
 exactitude and honesty."

 I recalled that Holmes, after a brief examination of the scene, had
 asked the
 persons concerned only about each other and about those few rooms and
 items
 that were involved, and yet by the application of his remarkable
 deductive
 faculty had soon been able to accuse the guilty person.

  The Matter of the Monster

  You stagger up to itsthe gourd'sthe magpie'sthe squid's lair. Blue
  sand drags at your feet.
  Your hands don't tremble - well, much - as you ready your new weapon.
  the axe you borrowed from the woodshed. your new sword. your new spear
  and sword. Your voice doesn't quaver (hardly at all) as you shout out
  the words you were taught. the words every child knows: "Ready or not,
  here I come!" the words of protection. the words of valor and
  protection.

  One, two! Dive and roll! Jump! Attack!

  ...That wasn't so hard, was it? You defeated the monster, and it's not even bedtime yet.

  * Haul the creature's body back to feed the starving city.

  * Plunder the hoard of treasure to restore your family's fortune.

  * Rescue the captive chained to the rocks below.

  * Rescue the captive chained to the rocks below.
  You scurry down to the tide-line, leaving the squid-monster sprawled
  among the dunes. Really, nothing should ever have that many tentacles.
  You unchain the prisoner, who is duly grateful; but you are more
  excited by the prospect of the anatomical paper you're going to write
  when you both get home.

  * Your older brother set out before you.

  * Your older sister set out before you.
  Your older brother set out before you.

  * He marched blithely into the forest.

  * He traipsed carelessly along the river.
>river
  Your older brother did not know where the squid-beast lived, so he
  traipsed carelessly along the river.

  He didn't find the fiend's cephalopoddiere. Instead, he discovered a
  frail old woman on a pebbly curve of riverbank.  She was standing with
  her hands on her hips, a frown on her face, and her legs caught knee-
  deep in a pool of peanut butter.

  "Well?" she asked snippily. "A little help for a frail old woman?"

  Your brother looked puzzled. "How did you--"

  "Let bygones by bygones!" snapped the old woman. "The situation is
  under control. Investigations are in process. Personnel have been let
  go and the case," she added pointedly, "has been closed. Be a dear,
  though, would you, and give me a hand?"

  * He snickered and continued on his way.

  * He started gathering branches to help the woman.
  "I wouldn't want to spoil your fun," he replied. "Besides, chunky
  peanut butter? Revolting."

  "Shame on you, young man," said the woman. "Well then, I won't spoil
  your fun either. What was it, a giant octopus? Squid?"

  "Yes -- wait. How did you know that?" But the old woman refused to say
  another word.

  * Sadly, no amount of peanut butter can appease an angry -

  You fling yourself into the giant magpie's nest, and come up laden
  with glittering necklaces, shining ropes of jewels, and the occasional
  highly polished armoire. (It was a really *big* giant magpie.) You'll
  need a yard-sale the size of your entire manor to sell this lot, but
  it was worth it.

  * She started gathering branches to help the woman.
  Your sister gathered dead branches to brace across the peanut butter
  pool. In a few minutes, and with a most astonishing sucking sound, the
  woman had pulled herself free.

  "There go a couple of good walking shoes I won't see again," she
  muttered, glaring irately at the pool. It burbled back in evident
  satisfaction. "I don't suppose you--"

  "No, no, I have a bird-monster to find," your sister said hastily.

  "Really? They never bother me. Do you know the words for 'em?"

  Your sister did not, and listened attentively as the old woman
  pronounced the words. "Just shout 'em out -- should give the old
  critter a nasty turn. Then get in quick with the sword. You do have a
  sword, don't you?"

  * "As it happens, no."

 In Memory








 That which creates night within us might also leave stars.

 ~ Victor Hugo








 Darkness.  A shadowy void.

 Are your eyes closed?  You test the theory by trying to open them, and
 find that you can't sense your eyelids anymore.  You can't sense
 anything physical at all, really.

 Just the darkness, the occasional indigo light in your peripheral
 vision.


 Unconsciousness
 Images and thoughts come and go.  Snatches of memory, fragments of
 hopes, bits of dreams.  And always that lingering sense of the indigo
 haze at the edge of your perception.

 [ Unconsciousness  | Score: 0 ]
>examine indigo
 Yes, it's there.  Just at the edge of your awareness.  Perhaps if you
 could bring yourself to focus on it -- or at least ignore it -- having
 it linger there wouldn't bother you quite so much.

>focus on indigo
 You turn your attention to the indigo haze.  It's almost like looking
 indirectly at a very dim star in the night sky: rather than coming into
 focus, it actually grows more elusive, and threatens to disappear from
 your sight entirely.

 You don't know why, but you don't want it to vanish.  Yet the harder
 you concentrate on it, the harder it is to see, so you avert your eyes.

 And there it remains, agonizingly close and yet just barely in sight.

>touch indigo
 You reach out, if only with your mind, for the indigo light, but you
 can't connect with it directly.

>ignore indigo
 You long for that faint glimmer of blue that lies on the edge of your
 perception.  Why?  Because it's there, that's why.  Because you know
 that every time you turn your attention to it, time and again, it will
 fade.

 But that's just you, isn't it?  The way you always are.  Always wanting
 what you can't have. It's typical, really.

 The wanting, and the punishing yourself for wanting... it's too much.
 And so you let go... not merely in the sense of not actively focusing
 on the haze: you ignore it entirely.  Completely and whole heartedly.

>wait
 ...and it would seem that in your letting it go, the indigo light
 finally responds.  It blossoms.  It grows to fill your vision, the
 whole of it...








 Floating in the blue, the indigo, the indigo blue.  Finally some sense
 of stability, some serenity.

 The frenetic pace of the swirling thoughts has diminished.  Indeed -
 now that they've ceased their whirling, now that you can examine them,
 you know them to be memories from the life you've lived.

 Unconsciousness
 You are ensconced in the soothing indigo light.

 In the light, you can see the tiny stuffed rabbit, the child-sized
 desk, your Homecoming outfit, Sam's incredible smile, the set of
 favorite over-sized headphones, a hardcover book and the vista from
 back home.



 In Memory by Jacqueline A. Lott - May 2011
 Released as part of the Indigo New Language Speed IF


 Yes, this.  This is what you were really wanting, to be wrapped in the
 soothing embrace of the indigo light.  To let it flow over you, and
 into you, and through you, and to show you how your struggles and
 desires have brought you to where you are now.

>scream at indigo
 Unable to sense your lips or tongue, you find it impossible to form
 words.

>contemplate indigo
 I don't understand what you want me to do with the indigo light.

>examine rabbit
 You recognize the rabbit from your earliest childhood memories.  As you
 focus on it, the other images around you fade and all that you can see
 is that small, soft bunny.

 Holding onto the Bunny
 It seems impossible that you could remember something that happened so
 very long ago, but it feels very, very real... You are an infant, not
 yet able to speak, and you're clutching the tiny rabbit in your small
 arms.  You're able to clearly make out the shine of your old friend's
 button eyes and the tight stitching of its seams.  Somehow in the
 richness of your dream the rabbit appears simultaneously faded and
 vibrant: well-loved, yet the corduroy is a very rich, earthy brown.  No
 doubt your affection for it colors the memory.

 for much of your childhood, and now that you think about it, it set the
 tone for much of your life as well.  Not to say that there were never
 difficult times, but you managed to smile through much of the adversity
 and keep an optimistic outlook most of the time.

 Unfortunately, the image fades all too soon, and the pleasant feelings
 dissipate with it...

 You think back to the best of days when Sam was seemingly always there

 fade and you remember what it was like...

 Loving Sam
 The world was kind of a scary place for you back then, fresh out of
 school.  Frightened to death of what lay ahead, unable to let go of the
 decisions you'd made that got you there.  But throughout it all was
 Sam, and why Sam was always there for you you'll never know.  Anyone
 would have been lucky to have so much of Sam's time.

 In the light, you can see Sam's incredible smile.

 You always found it difficult to believe that many people thought Sam
 was just so-so, because to you Sam was pretty much perfection.  So many
 small details that added up to something so much more... not just the
 smile, no -- everything.  Sam's bright eyes, cute little nose, full
 lips that felt so right brushing against your own.

 You remember how that book used to feel in your hands.  As you recall
 the sunny afternoons with it under the tree, the rainy evenings with it
 curled up near the fire, the other images around you fade and you are
 carried into...

 Imagined Realities
 Escapism's not such a bad thing, right?  All good things in moderation,
 they say.  Though, hm.  Perhaps you did overdo it a bit from time to
 time.  You loved to get you lost in a well-crafted world, to find
 yourself wondering about what the characters were up to when you were
 supposed to be focused on real life obligations.  Sometimes on the way
 home from work, looking forward to later in the evening when you could
 pick back up where you left off, you'd imagine the questions you wanted
 to ask the characters.  Imagined dialogues that played out countless
 ways.

 In the light, you can see a hardcover book.


 It took a certain kind of book to get you so engrosssed, though.  Your
 favorite genre by far was...

 Yes, fantasy novels make it particularly easy to escape, don't they?
 Hard to say which variety makes it easiest, though... The ones where
 things seem really close to the world you actually live in, except for
 the fact that some people have powers you'd never suspect they have by
 looking at them?  Or the books set long ago in the forests of Europe
 where people and elves speak made-up languages and act like modern day
 wanna-be people?  On the whole, the subtle ones are better, even if you
 can't sometimes help going for the authors that lay it on thick.

 School Days
 How old were you when you spent your days seated here, listening to Mrs
 Bright as she tried her best to make you into something?  It was that
 awkward, in between time of your life.  You weren't really a child, not
 really... but not yet a teen.

 Part of you hated being here -- so much more to do outside! -- but a
 part of you loved being in this desk, too.  Even if you wouldn't ever
 admit it, because that wouldn't have been cool.  But deep down you were
 actually fond of school.

 What will Chris think of this outfit?  You're still not sure.  Oddly,
 though a part of you is sure that the dance, like this memory, has

 God yes, those headphones!  How they let you shut out the rest of the
 world, how they filled your head with music.  As you focus on them, the

 Lost in Sound
 Being a grown up is sometime pretty difficult.  Decisions to make,
 burdens to carry.  Most of the time you like to think you did okay, but
 you have to admit there were nights -- hell, sometimes whole weekends
 where all you could do was put on the headphones, pull the curtains,
 and lie back on the couch listening to your favorite music.

 Also here are the set of favorite over-sized headphones.


 Yes, this headset blocked out everything: not just the noise of the
 world, as it was designed to do.  No.  When the volume was up high
 enough, it blocked out the worries and concerns, too.  The music that

 Sam?  It... can't be.  But it sure sounds like --

 "All those years we've spent apart, Chris."  Chris?   Damn.  Surely not
 Chris from school... "I loved Alex the whole time, every minute, but
 never picked up the goddamn phone.  I wonder what I missed, y'know?
 And now... now it's kind of looking like Alex isn't going to wake up.
 No chance for a reunion... and no chance for me to say I'm sorry."

 "Now wait.  First off, we don't know that Alex isn't going to wake up.
 Second, you can't blame yourself, Sam.  I think deep down you both
 still loved each other for a really long time.  I mean, not that I know
 much -- Alex and I drifted apart as well -- but we did go out for a
 beer after the twenty-five year reunion, and Alex mentioned you that
 night.  Circumstance is a bitch sometimes, y'know?  I don't think the
 two of you had much control over what happened."

 Damn, please, why can't I wake up?  Why can't I tell them that I'm
 here?  And that beeping... I guess it's the heart monitor, so I'm glad
 it's making that sound, but god it's also kind of annoying because I
 want to hear their voices and they're speaking so softly now.

 "Alex mentioned me?  After all those year?"

 I can hear Chris laugh a little bit.  Not in a harsh way, just a small,
 under-the-breath laugh.  "Yeah.  Specifically, I recall Alex
 reminiscing about your face.  Getting lost in your eyes and feeling the
 warmth of your smile and -- and it was pretty sappy like that for quite
 a few minutes, as I recall.  I think it was all Alex could do that
 night to not tear up, even though you two had been apart a really long
 time."

 Now it's Sam's gentle laugh.  A little worn, like some of the spark is
 gone, but I guess after all these years we've all lost a little of our
 spark.  "I have honestly missed Alex.  You hear that, Alex?  We
 shouldn't talk over you like you're not here, because you are.  I've
 missed you, and I'm sorry, and --"

 beep, beep, beep had ceased to beep.

 Floating in the blue, the indigo, the indigo blue.  Finally some sense

 In Memory by Jacqueline A. Lott - May 2011
 Released as part of the Indigo New Language Speed IF


 Yes, this.  This is what you were really wanting, to be wrapped in the
 soothing embrace of the indigo light.  To let it flow over you, and
 into you, and through you, and to show you how your struggles and
 desires have brought you to where you are now.

>about
 In Memory was written by Jacqueline A Lott for the 2011 Indigo New
 Language Speed IF.  This was a "speed IF" where you were given about
 three weeks to write a game in an interactive fiction language you'd
 never used before.  I did spend a fair amount of the allotted time
 working on In Memory, though not nearly as much as I could have (my
 real life was also fairly busy those three weeks).  It received some
 light testing from Sam Kabo Ashwell (thanks, maga!).

 My thanks to Duncan Bowsman for making me think about ADRIFT.  Without
 Bowsman, I probably wouldn't have sprung the ADRIFT Generator or been
 curious about how to create games with it.  Thanks also to Campbell
 Wild for the system itself, the stellar documentation he's written for
 it,  and his really great customer service.  I'm glad I chose ADRIFT
 for this speed-IF -- much as I'm a fan of I7, this might not be my last
 foray into ADRIFTland.

 As for the game itself, this is actually a game I'd been thinking about
 for some time, but which I thought would be too overambitious.  Then I
 went and crammed the whole thing into two weeks of work.  Sensible,
 right?  It was, unshockingly, too much to do for a SpeedIF.  I'm
 pleased enough with it, though, and I am not opposed to doing a second
 release of this, so if you encounter things you think should be added,
 please send a note to my gmail account: jacqueline.a.lott

 Oh, and if you're curious about some of the stats about the game, you
 full time before you check those out.

 Thanks for playing.

>bargain
 I've no idea what you mean... everything is so confusing here.

>stats
 For the curious and terminally geeky, the game lets you associate well
 over two thousand words with the various memories you encounter.  The
 actual number is unknown, given that the game (for obvious reasons)
 makes heavy, heavy use of wildcards in text input.

 Holding onto the Bunny allows over 170 word associations, grouped into
 10 categories.

 School Days allows over 225 word associations, grouped into 12
 categories.

 Homecoming Night allows over 130 word associations, grouped into 8
 categories.

 Loving Sam allows over 400 word associations, grouped into 21
 categories.

 Lost in Sound allows over 150 word associations, grouped into 14
 categories.

 Imagined Realities allows over 50 word associations, grouped into 15
 categories.

 The Vista Back Home allows over 80 word associations, grouped into 13
 categories.

 For the Indigo New Language Speed IF release of In Memory (i.e. the
 first (and possibly only (we'll see))) release, the only category of
 these that can change the end cut scene are the words you associate
 with your old lover, Sam.  While there are 21 categories, there are
 fewer endings than that because many of the categores -- particularly
 the, shall we say, more primal categories -- closely overlap.

 As for the other memories and all of their categories, this version of
 the game does keep track of which category of word associations you
 chose, but doesn't integrate them into the end game.  Such is the way
 of the Speed IF: I ran out of time.

 On a final note, a feelie of sorts.  If you want to see the horribly
 messy (and terribly spoilery) design document, there's a photo of it at

 is that small, soft bunny.

 Holding onto the Bunny
 It seems impossible that you could remember something that happened so
 very long ago, but it feels very, very real... You are an infant, not
 yet able to speak, and you're clutching the tiny rabbit in your small
 arms.  You're able to clearly make out the shine of your old friend's
 button eyes and the tight stitching of its seams.  Somehow in the
 richness of your dream the rabbit appears simultaneously faded and
 vibrant: well-loved, yet the corduroy is a very rich, earthy brown.  No
 doubt your affection for it colors the memory.

 Imagined Realities
 Escapism's not such a bad thing, right?  All good things in moderation,
 they say.  Though, hm.  Perhaps you did overdo it a bit from time to
 time.  You loved to get you lost in a well-crafted world, to find
 yourself wondering about what the characters were up to when you were
 supposed to be focused on real life obligations.  Sometimes on the way
 home from work, looking forward to later in the evening when you could
 pick back up where you left off, you'd imagine the questions you wanted
 to ask the characters.  Imagined dialogues that played out countless
 ways.

 What will Chris think of this outfit?  You're still not sure.  Oddly,
 though a part of you is sure that the dance, like this memory, has
 already happened, you can't recall the rest of the evening or what
 Chris thought of your attire.  Not that it matters, really -- Chris is
 going with you to the dance tonight because of you, not your style.

 Bright as she tried her best to make you into something?  It was that
 awkward, in between time of your life.  You weren't really a child, not

 Part of you hated being here -- so much more to do outside! -- but a

 admit it, because that wouldn't have been cool.  But deep down you were

 You long for that faint glimmer of blue that lies on the edge of your
 perception.  Why?  Because it's there, that's why.  Because you know
 that every time you turn your attention to it, time and again, it will
 fade.

 But that's just you, isn't it?  The way you always are.  Always wanting
 what you can't have. It's typical, really.

 The wanting, and the punishing yourself for wanting... it's too much.
 And so you let go... not merely in the sense of not actively focusing
 on the haze: you ignore it entirely.  Completely and whole heartedly.

 ...and it would seem that in your letting it go, the indigo light
 finally responds.  It blossoms.  It grows to fill your vision, the
 whole of it...








 Floating in the blue, the indigo, the indigo blue.  Finally some sense
 of stability, some serenity.

 The frenetic pace of the swirling thoughts has diminished.  Indeed -
 now that they've ceased their whirling, now that you can examine them,
 you know them to be memories from the life you've lived.

 Unconsciousness
 You are ensconced in the soothing indigo light.

 In the light, you can see the tiny stuffed rabbit, the child-sized

 In Memory by Jacqueline A. Lott - May 2011
 Released as part of the Indigo New Language Speed IF


 Yes, this.  This is what you were really wanting, to be wrapped in the
 soothing embrace of the indigo light.  To let it flow over you, and
 into you, and through you, and to show you how your struggles and
 desires have brought you to where you are now.

>examine rabbit
 You recognize the rabbit from your earliest childhood memories.  As you
 focus on it, the other images around you fade and all that you can see
 is that small, soft bunny.

 Holding onto the Bunny
 It seems impossible that you could remember something that happened so
 very long ago, but it feels very, very real... You are an infant, not
 yet able to speak, and you're clutching the tiny rabbit in your small
 arms.  You're able to clearly make out the shine of your old friend's
 button eyes and the tight stitching of its seams.  Somehow in the
 richness of your dream the rabbit appears simultaneously faded and
 vibrant: well-loved, yet the corduroy is a very rich, earthy brown.  No
 doubt your affection for it colors the memory.

 In the light, you can see the tiny stuffed rabbit.


 As you hold the small rabbit close to your heart, emotions flood

 School Days
 How old were you when you spent your days seated here, listening to Mrs
 Bright as she tried her best to make you into something?  It was that
 awkward, in between time of your life.  You weren't really a child, not
 really... but not yet a teen.

 Part of you hated being here -- so much more to do outside! -- but a
 part of you loved being in this desk, too.  Even if you wouldn't ever
 admit it, because that wouldn't have been cool.  But deep down you were
 actually fond of school.

 What will Chris think of this outfit?  You're still not sure.  Oddly,

 Loving Sam
 The world was kind of a scary place for you back then, fresh out of
 school.  Frightened to death of what lay ahead, unable to let go of the
 decisions you'd made that got you there.  But throughout it all was
 Sam, and why Sam was always there for you you'll never know.  Anyone
 would have been lucky to have so much of Sam's time.

 Lost in Sound
 Being a grown up is sometime pretty difficult.  Decisions to make,
 burdens to carry.  Most of the time you like to think you did okay, but
 you have to admit there were nights -- hell, sometimes whole weekends
 where all you could do was put on the headphones, pull the curtains,
 and lie back on the couch listening to your favorite music.

 Also here are the set of favorite over-sized headphones.


 Yes, this headset blocked out everything: not just the noise of the

 Escapism's not such a bad thing, right?  All good things in moderation,

 yourself wondering about what the characters were up to when you were
 supposed to be focused on real life obligations.  Sometimes on the way

 Sam?  It... can't be.  But it sure sounds like --

 "All those years we've spent apart, Chris."  Chris?   Damn.  Surely not
 Chris from school... "I loved Alex the whole time, every minute, but
 never picked up the goddamn phone.  I wonder what I missed, y'know?
 And now... now it's kind of looking like Alex isn't going to wake up.
 No chance for a reunion... and no chance for me to say I'm sorry."

 "Now wait.  First off, we don't know that Alex isn't going to wake up.
 Second, you can't blame yourself, Sam.  I think deep down you both
 still loved each other for a really long time.  I mean, not that I know
 much -- Alex and I drifted apart as well -- but we did go out for a
 beer after the twenty-five year reunion, and Alex mentioned you that
 night.  Circumstance is a bitch sometimes, y'know?  I don't think the
 two of you had much control over what happened."

 Damn, please, why can't I wake up?  Why can't I tell them that I'm
 here?  And that beeping... I guess it's the heart monitor, so I'm glad
 it's making that sound, but god it's also kind of annoying because I
 want to hear their voices and they're speaking so softly now.

 "Alex mentioned me?  After all those year?"

 I can hear Chris laugh a little bit.  Not in a harsh way, just a small,
 under-the-breath laugh.  "Yeah.  Specifically, I recall Alex
 reminiscing about your ... man, I can't believe I'm saying this to you,
 but it was classic Alex, so I'll just say it: Alex talked about the sex
 the two of you had.  Amazing and incredible and mind-blowing and ...
 and roughly fifty million other superlatives."

 "Seriously?  All that time together, then all those years apart, and
 all Alex went on about what a good lay I was?"

 "Sam, look.  I know this is going to sound like I'm covering, but that
 was always Alex, y'know?  Always focused on the physical stuff.  I
 could tell, though, that underneath it all Alex loved the whole
 package, Sam.  The whole you.  I think it was all Alex could do that
 night to not tear up, even though you two had been apart a really long
 time."

 Now it's Sam's gentle laugh.  A little worn, like some of the spark is
 gone, but I guess after all these years we've all lost a little of our
 spark.  "I have honestly missed Alex.  You hear that, Alex?  We
 shouldn't talk over you like you're not here, because you are.  I've
 missed you, and I'm sorry, and --"

 -- and that's the last thing I heard: Sam's voice.  Because the steady
 beep, beep, beep had ceased to beep.

  The Cavity of Time
  with apologies to more or less everyone

  Superfluous Warning
  usual way, imagining that you are a mop-haired, somewhat androgynous
  tween in the early 80s. Even if doing so is legal in your area.

  The incredible erotic adventures you will shortly undergo are, in some
  trivial sense, the result of your choices. You are monumentally
  irresponsible because you choose. Most often, because you choose to
  hit UNDO. (You see that button in the upper left? Regard it as your
  closest companion. Not one of the platonic ones, either.) So at least
  pretend to be deep in thought before you click anything. It may lead
  to your ruin, or... okay, let's be honest, ruin's the main contender
  here.

  In your travels you may hear of the mystical Harem Ending Cave. In
  idle moments, you may fantasise about whether your aimless staggering
  will ever take you there. Sadly, many never find it, because you
  cannot get to the Harem Ending by making choices or following
  instructions!

  Sufficiently inspired? Full sail for adventure!

  The SS Turgidity

  Frankly, your recent voyages have been a stream of utter bullshit. A
  Starfleet management review eliminated the post of Miniskirt Officer
  from all Penetrator-class ships. Phobos was distinctly less rewarding
  than suggested, and you'll be having stern words with your
  Precognitive Officer about the whole business with Titan; breaking
  mimesis may be forgiven, but not when it kills your boner.

  To top things off, you dozed off at the helm. The SS Turgidity's
  autopilot turns out to be programmed to seek out the deepest hole in a
  given body, so you are now stuck somewhere near the centre of a Swiss-
  cheese planet. Your attempts to remedy the situation through manual
  control have left your spaceship battered, crumpled and upside-down.

  You could disembark and try to escape through the tunnels on foot,
  head down to the engine-room to supervise repairs, or give up hope.
  ...
  (You see that, Montgomery? Straight-up three choices on the first
  page, none of your back-and-forth cocktease shit. That is how a pro
  gets down.)
  You resolutely give up hope. Somehow, no authorial device punishes you
  for your lack of sticktoitiveness, and you are left in precisely the
  same total shambles as before.
  Engine Room

  Lieutenant Bundt, your Alchemy Officer, is frantically trying to
  repair the impulse engines. An incredible variety of mystic whatsits
  are scattered across his workbench, and a despairing expression clouds
  his face.

  "We're so dead, Captain. The Pneumatic Cockatrice has broken the Seal
  of Temurah, and I think some phlogiston went up my nose. I've
  collected all the components and recalled all the formulae I can, but
  the abulafia's broken and I can't reliably interpret the logosbooks
  without it. And I think I'm missing a Vital Principle."

  You suppress a weary sigh. This would never have happened if you'd
  stuck with a rational, scientific technology like dilithium crystals.

  * Make your excuses and quietly abandon ship.
  * "It's probably semen, you know. Usually is."
  * "The abulawhatnow?"
  "It's probably semen, you know. Usually is."

  "Of course I've tried semen! I've tried everything! I think we're in a
  ley-line dead zone, Captain."

  "Mmm, but your chowder's probably not of the purest, what with all
  those mercury fumes, and those aether bottles that keep going astray,
  plus you still drink out of a Nalgene, man. My body, on the other
  hand, is a temple." You don't specify which kind.

  "I really think, sir... it's probably just the dead zone." But there's
  a sparkle in his eyes.

  * Press the issue.
  ...
  "Indeed. Dead zone. Desperate times, desparate measures. You may have
  to awaken the serpent of Kundalini."

  Rimjobs are half the reason that anybody goes through alchemical
  school, and Bundt proves to be thoroughly capable, tonguing you
  briskly while leaving one hand free for the reach-around. The
  spectacular effect is a little spoiled when he gets off his knees and
  stuffs his chubby up you (is that the scent of tarragon oil?) but he's
  professional enough to keep tugging, at least. Just before you do your
  duty, he shoves your dick into what is presumably the appropriate
  glassware. The globby chemical soup that results is triumphantly
  conveyed to the primary power crucible.

  * Well, that wasn't so difficult.
  Three minutes later, the Turgidity is lost with all hands. Luckily,
  you'd stepped outside to take a post-coital whizz. Alone, shipwrecked,
  and unable to shake the feeling that you may be partially responsible,
  you comfort yourself with the thought that the survivor's guilt will
  doubtless be every bit as agonising as the fate that consumed your
  entire crew. Well, that's settled. Off to the caves!

  * Continue into... THE CAVITY OF TIME.
  Plumbing the Deeps

  The tunnels twist and bifurcate like the wedding-tackle of a nine-
  dimensional Shgresh brood-king. Your officer training included an
  intensive course on orienteering under stress, so in short order you
  are hopelessly lost.

  Okay. Try again. Let's break this up into small, easy tasks. Big
  strategic decision coming up. One of the classics. The tunnel forks
  here. Left or right?

  * Left.
  * Right.
  You wander down the left-hand passage. After walking for a few
  minutes, you notice some figures approaching out of the darkness.
  They're... kind of poorly conceived, rather as if someone drew an
  arbitrary shape and then threw in arms, legs and a face to justify
  calling it a monster, rather than a malformed dumpling. This is an
  excellent sign that you'll never encounter their species again, and
  can dispense with subtle diplomacy; still, they look hostile, and
  they're approaching fast.

  You could go with the time-honoured options of fight or flight. Or you
  could employ your modern advantages, and use your tricorder to analyse
  the creatures for sexual compatability.
  In one practised motion, you unholster your tricorder and wave it at
  the creatures. Ah, the age we live in! Not so long ago, the only known
  method to test for sexual compatability was to stick your penis in.
  Advanced modern thought has replaced the serviceable but risky Penis
  Test with an array of scientific and sociological metrics; thankfully,
  Kirk had someone condense this into a two-button app, and you managed
  to snaffle a spare copy.

  Aww, 12%? You promised yourself you'd never go below twenty again
  unless it was a real emergency, but anything below fifteen is
  virtually guaranteed to cause lasting genital injury unless there's a
  manual to consult.

  Down towards the bottom of the detailed analysis, though, there's a
  note that they're sentient, speak English and are not normally
  aggressive. Armed with this knowledge, you strike up a conversation.
  They explain that you have entered the Cavity of Time, a poorly-
  organised gateway that allows highly unreliable travel across time and
  space. To demonstrate the point, they drag you off to an Traveller
  bar. The tricorder does considerably better here; most of the patrons
  are human, in fact. But the drinks are a lot stronger than you
  realise, and after an hour or so your short-term memory decides to cut
  you off. The last thing you remember is attempting to seduce the 1966
  Australian Federation Cup team through the power of solo barbershop. Floyd |

  A woman? ...well, okay, whatever you and the other person agree on, I
  suppose. And apparently there is another person; you're sleepily
  entangled. They don't smell like anyone you've fucked lately, though.
  Okay, okay, would you prefer them to be a man or a woman?

  * Damn the oppressive gender-binary! I want one of those dickgirls
  with enormous tits.
  Uh, okay. Keep your eyes shut and your hands in strategic areas and
  let the power of your imagination do the rest. Just so long as we
  don't start on the lactation stuff, all right?

  At any rate, zie's beginning to shift about, there's some warm semi-
  conscious hip-grinding and fumbling going on. But other urges call to
  you. Do you want to make love or make it nasty?
  You start off with a little biting and clawing, and find it
  enthusiastically returned. This isn't exactly your normal speed, but
  sometimes the situation demands it. After that things escalate rather
  swiftly; hands are clamped over mouths, a three-quarter-nelson is
  applied, and the bed sustains major structural damage.

  Though bruised, you retain enough presence of mind to sneak out in the
  immediate aftermath. Albeit by a rather unorthodox route.

  The Island

  You stroll along the beach, bare-footed in the cool surf. At the head
  of the bay you discover a weather-battered information board:

  Due to the irresponsible overpopulation of narrative space, the number
  of remote islands is exceeded several times over by the discrete
  stories that require them. Given the relatively small area of an
  island actually used by the average story (outside establishing shots
  and other broad functions not entailing use conflicts), a partitioning
  system is in effect on both beachfront and interior land. To
  facilitate access by independent visitors, a map is provided detailing
  current narrative assignments.

  The map below is rather heavily water-damaged, and none of its text is
  legible; but you can make out that the island is divided into three
  areas: one consisting mostly of high crags, narrow valleys and small,
  hidden harbours; a second covered in forest, and a third dominated by
  meadows and rolling hills.

  * Mountains!
  * Forests!
  * Grassland!
  * A vertex between all three!
  If that's your game, we all know what your role is, Stiffy, and it's
  not one that's placed along the edges. Shall we try that again?

  * Mountains!
  * Forests!
  * Grassland!
  Possibly out of sheer bloody-mindedness, you head into the forest. It
  turns out to be less impenetrable than it looks: it's more a series of
  Arcadian glades, with the occasional bubbling stream or picturesque
  ruined temple. Birds sing, deer frolic. Nymph types in translucent...
  well hello there.

  On closer inspection, there seems to be just the one: broad shoulders,
  solid contrapposto hips, Pre-Raphaelite pout. Barefoot. Tresses. She's
  standing by a table in an ivy-choked ruin, pouring wine from an
  amphora.

  * Get out of this forest as quickly as possible.
  * Introduce yourself.
  You stroll in her direction with a cheery wave; she glances up at you
  with big dark eyes. "Greetings, sailor. You must have travelled far;
  may I offer some..."

  "Don't mind if I do. Very good of you," you say, throwing back a
  cupful of the wine. "My, but that's... is that retsina or mulled or
  something? Very good either way. Congratulations on your cellar."

  She sets her cup aside as she slides up against you, running her
  fingers up the inside of your forearm and toying with the brooch that
  holds all that drapery together. You perk up even further. "Mmm. So
  how about it?"

  Her eyes shoot over to an ornamental sundial, and then she breathes
  "Give me seven and a half minutes." and sidles off into a scenic
  grotto.

  You help yourself to some more wine, twiddle your thumbs a little,
  then go to check your teeth in the reflection of a limpid pool. Your
  teeth are spinach-free, but the tusks come as something of a surprise.
  You appear to be a good-sized wild boar, albeit as good-looking as
  ever. Well, that was almost unexpected.

  * Get out of here before she comes back.
  * Charge into the grotto.
  * Hang around.
  With an intemperate snort you charge into the grotto. After several
  minutes of subterranean charging, Circe is still not in evidence, and
  you have the sinking feeling that you're not going to be able to find
  your way back. And she was probably the only person who could change
  you back. You feel a little downcast as you continue through the
  Cavity.
  ...
  You pass through a maze of dark tunnels, through which blows a cold
  and gusty wind. Eventually you emerge into light once again.

  Brightly-coloured murals cover the walls of this room; surverying them
  is a vast hulk of a man, quite naked and a little on the green side.
  On seeing you, he approaches, making cooing noises and holding out a
  chunk of processed fruit-cake.

  * Eh, you've had worse. Let's get this over with.
  * Flee back down the passageway.
  * Dash between his legs and into one of the tunnels beyond.
  The green fellow turns out to be slow and clumsy, and you dash past
  him before he has time to even attempt a grab. Hot-footing it down the
  tunnels,

  Fortunately, your next troglodytic encounter is with a gathering of
  Isis-worshippers engaged in a secret ritual. You bowl over the ankh-
  bearers, stick your snout into the crotch of the High Priestess,
  frolic gaily across the Sealed Circle, knock over the ritual wine,
  chase a blushing sistrum-boy around a pillar, and finally make off
  with a garland of delicious roses. Munching contentedly, you continue
  on your way. The roses become rather less appetising as time passes,
  but and you bump your head on the ceiling a few times, but it's very
  nice to have hands again.
  ...
  You clamber through what seems like miles of indistinguishable
  tunnels, hoping that you're not circling back on yourself. At last you
  come to a place that you certainly haven't seen before: a high-vaulted
  cavern with three exits at its further end. Which do you choose?

  * A tunnel of rough yellow masonry.
  * A dimly lit passageway, adorned with trash and pipework.
  * An underdescribed tunnel.
  You select one of many tunnels and follow it, but the passageway does
  not rise. Instead, it opens onto a chamber in which a beard sits
  enthroned. Within the beard is a wizened old man, who nods politely as
  you enter.

  "I suppose you want me to tell you how to get home."

  "Not really. I'm really more of a picaresque, you know? It'd be better
  if you could help me understand how these caves work."

  The old man leers at you. "I might be able to manage that. But tell
  me, first: why do you want control over time?"

  * "The same reason that I signed up for the Turgidity: to explore new
  worlds and bang everyone."
  * "To avoid becoming trapped in unwinnable situations."
  * "I just want to get to the most awesome time ever."
  * "Look, how about I give you a blowjob, we skip over the
  gatekeeper's-riddle bit and you just tell me the right answer?"
  "Look, how about I give you a blowjob, we skip over the gatekeeper's-
  riddle bit and you just tell me the right answer?"

  "As you will," says the sage, sticking his helmet out through the
  middle of his beard. "Whoa hey, did anybody ever tell you that you're
  really damn good at that?"

  He strings it out for rather longer than necessary, but what the hell,
  he probably doesn't get too many visitors. At length you swallow.
  "Very well, then. Here, (whew!) here's the map," he says, gesturing up
  and behind you. "No, you have to move over here to see it properly;
  let me just move out of your way..."

  At which point, you find yourself seated in his throne, while he skips
  away down a tunnel, cackling. Oh dear.

  With any luck, someone stupider will happen along eventually. Until
  then:

  The End
  * "The same reason that I signed up for the Turgidity: to explore new
  worlds and bang everyone."
  * "To avoid becoming trapped in unwinnable situations."
  * "I just want to get to the most awesome time ever."
  * "Look, how about I give you a blowjob, we skip over the
  gatekeeper's-riddle bit and you just tell me the right answer?"
  "The same reason that I signed up for the Turgidity: to explore new
  worlds and bang everyone."

  The little old beard cocks his head sideways like a demented owl. "All
  say that they seek the best ending," he muses, while you long for a
  rock to lob at him, "yet what does it bring us but finality, and
  oblivion?"

  "Yeah, tell me about it. I wanted the full-blown razmatazz with full
  body part implementation and four-part harmony, but the author keeps
  eliding all the sex-scenes like a total priss."

  "Then you, Stiffy, have already won. For where you go they cannot
  follow, and that is the true Undiscovered Country."

  The End
  * "The same reason that I signed up for the Turgidity: to explore new
  worlds and bang everyone."
  * "To avoid becoming trapped in unwinnable situations."
  * "I just want to get to the most awesome time ever."

  gatekeeper's-riddle bit and you just tell me the right answer?"
  "To avoid becoming trapped in unwinnable situations."

  "Then you have already won," intones the old beard, "for the only
  unwinnable state is when one is unwilling to begin anew."

  "Christ, if you're going to be like that, just point me towards the
  next place where I can get a quick lay, OK?"

  "QED," says the old man. And he shows you the way.

  The End
  "I just want to get to the most awesome time ever."

  "Awesomeness is a subjective value, my friend," muses the old man,
  growing more insufferable by the second. I mean, duh. "But since you
  insist, I will approximate an answer by sending you to the time that
  received the highest mean approval ratings from the core adventure-
  liking demographic."

  "No, no, wait..." you cry, but you are cut off as the caves shift
  their form around you, with a deep, irrevocable rumble.
  ...

  The Land Before Making Time

  You emerge from a crack in the side of a high mountain. Thick black
  smoke billows from the peak, and lava is pouring steadily down the
  slope towards you. Another rumble shakes the ground. You decide to get
  far away as quickly as possible.
  As you hurry downslope through a forest of ginkgo and pine, you are
  suddenly confronted with a herd of friendly apatosaurs! DINOSAURS!
  Totally frackin' awesome!

  Approximately thirty seconds later, your enthusiasm cools somewhat as
  you realise that a) the way back into the Cavity of Time is now
  permanently sealed, and b) no body part more enticing than a cloaca is
  going to evolve for several million years.

  The End
