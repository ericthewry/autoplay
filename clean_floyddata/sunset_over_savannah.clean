 Sunset Over Savannah
 by Ivan Cockrum
 Contest Release 1.0, 9/30/97.

 You follow the sand-strewn brick beach path for the last time, your
 thoughts a jumble of pleasant memories and angst-filled anticipation.

 The past week has been a formless, blissful oasis of peace in your
 otherwise hectic, demanding life.  You spent it alternately exploring
 the cool shade of historic downtown Savannah and basking in the warm
 southern sun.  Today is the last day of your vacation and the sun is
 setting fast, painting the sky with a breathtaking palette of pastel
 colors.  Tomorrow you'll be back in the office:  answering phones,
 writing memos, and painfully plotting every moment of your waking life
 for the next month.

 This short liberty has given you an unexpected sense of perspective on
 your life.  You've decided that you hate your job.  Though the
 realization came as no surprise, you were slightly shocked to discover
 exactly how much you hate your job.  It's not so much the work itself,
 as the way it's slowly, subtly insinuated itself into your soul.  It
 fills your thoughts and subverts your energies.  You feel you haven't
 created anything decent in months, possibly even years.

 In fact, you're of half a mind to quit.  You've got enough cash in the
 bank for an extended vacation, and with your skills, finding work will
 never be an issue.  You could even dedicate some time to pursuing your
 creative interests.  The only real obstacles are your own inertia and
 an overblown sense of loyalty that goes unreciprocated anyway.  It
 feels like all you'd need is a little more convincing that there's
 something more to life than constant, mind-numbing labor.

 Caught as you are between reverie and dread, you barely notice as your
 freshly callused feet carry you to the foot of the boardwalk...

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    You see a clam shell here.

 Your stomach grumbles at the sight of the boiled peanut sign.  You
 realize that, in your agitated state, you've completely forgotten to
 eat dinner.

>take shell
 Taken.

>examine it
 It's a lovely clam shell.  The outer surface is almost pure white,
 while the inner is lined with bright, silvery mother of pearl.

>listen to it
 The clam shell isn't substantial enough to make much noise.

>inventory
 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn),
 and a clam shell.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
 wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.

 The snack bar must be what the sign on the stairs was pointing to.
 Your stomach rumbles again at the thought of food.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>go south
 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.

 Behind the counter, a vendor is busily locking things away for the
 night.

 The vendor sees you approaching and throws a welcoming nod in your
 direction, followed by a rhetorical sounding "Hey, how's it going?"

>ask vendor about peanuts
 He looks up from his work.  "They're definitely an acquired taste.  I
 still prefer to peel the husks."

 The vendor sweeps the patch of floor behind the counter.

>buy peanuts
 You clear your throat to get the vendor's attention before asking,
 "Pardon, could I have some peanuts?"  "Oh, sure," says the vendor.  "I
 think I've got a few left...  yup, you're in luck.  I'm closing up for
 the night.  Another few minutes and I woulda tossed 'em."  He takes a
 pot holder from beneath the counter and uses it to grab a wireframe
 sieve resting in the boiler.  He bends over the boiler, and as he
 does, a small steel key slides out of his shirt pocket and falls into
 the bubbling water.  Using the sieve, he scoops up the bobbing
 peanuts.  He waits a moment while the sieve drains, and then dumps the
 peanuts into a brown paper sack.  You dig a dollar out of your pocket
 and hand it over, and he in turn hands you the sack of peanuts.
 Apparently, he hasn't noticed his missing key.

 The vendor sings a few lines of "Yellow Submarine" as he wipes down
 the counter.

>sing along
 I don't know the word "sing".

>tell man about key
 I don't see any man here.

>tell vendor about key
 It occurs to you that you ought to keep that bit of information to
 yourself.  If the vendor recovers the key, you may not get another
 chance to acquire it.

 The vendor jerks his head sharply right, then left, issuing an
 uncomfortably loud crack each time.

>eat peanuts
 This southern delicacy is still something of an oddity to you.  Some
 locals actually eat the entire peanut, husk and all.  Never one to
 pass up a new experience, you pluck a peanut from the sack and pop it
 into your mouth.  The husk crunches soggily between your teeth,
 revealing the pulpy fruit inside.  You queazily suspect that a large
 bug would share the same texture.  But despite that...  it doesn't
 taste bad.  In fact, boiled, the peanuts taste a lot like black eyed
 peas.  You try another, this time removing the husk.  Yes, it's quite
 tasty, so you eat a few more.  They're so rich though, that it doesn't
 take many at all to quell your hunger.  Thankfully, your stomach has
 stopped its rumbling, and there are still plenty of peanuts left in
 the sack.

 The vendor bends down and slams a cupboard somewhere behind the
 counter.

 Suddenly, the vendor pulls a white plastic bucket from beneath the
 counter.  To your surprise, he spills it out over the railing before
 locking it away again.  "Ah, just about done," he says to no one in
 particular.  "Just have to dump the peanut water and I'm outta here."
 He grabs the sieve from the boiler and sets it on the counter.  "Hey,
 would you lend me a hand here?  I'd really appreciate it."

>yes

 "Thanks!"  With your help, the vendor lifts the boiler pan off its
 foundation and muscles it to the railing.  He calls out, "Anybody down
 there?"  In an aside to you he says "Don't worry, we only toss out
 stuff that's edible.  It all gets eaten by the birds and the crabs.
 Everything else goes to the dump or gets recycled."  He turns back to
 the railing and, having received no response from below, yells "Ok,
 boiling water coming down!"  and leads you in tipping out the boiler.
 The boiling water cascades down into the sand, filling the air with
 billowing clouds of steam.  Then, the vendor sets the empty boiling
 pan back on its base and folds down the lid.  He reaches beneath the
 counter and withdraws a sturdy looking clamp, which he uses to fix the
 lid in place.  "Welp, that's it for me.  Thanks much for the help.
 See ya!"

 With that, the vendor steps out from behind the counter and sets his
 feet toward the center of the pavilion to the north.

>look
 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.
    Sitting on the snack bar is a sieve.

 The boiled peanut vendor is here, apparently on his way home for the
 night.

 The vendor exits the area and saunters north into the pavilion.

>get sieve
 Taken.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the
 setting sun streaks through them at just the right angle.

>look in boiler
 It's closed.

>open boiler
 You try to pull the clamp off with your bare hands, but it's anchored
 too securely.  There must be some trick to getting it off.

>examine clamp
 It's a thin, sturdy, triangle of steel.  The open end of the triangle
 holds the boiler's lid tightly in place by pinching it against the
 thin bar that runs around the lip of the boiler.

 An elderly couple strolls past you, hand in hand, clearly enjoying the
 sunset.

>move bar
 Which bar do you mean, the snack bar, or the boiler?

>boiler
 You can't move the boiler.

>pull bar
 Which bar do you mean, the snack bar, or the boiler?

>boiler
 It seems to be firmly attached.  There must be some special trick to
 removing it.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>pull clamp
 Pulling the clamp doesn't have any effect.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>push clamp
 Pushing the clamp doesn't do anything.

 A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
 horizon.

>turn clamp
 Turning the clamp doesn't have any effect.

 An elderly couple strolls past you, hand in hand, clearly enjoying the
 sunset.

 A young boy wearing a bright blue bathing suit and matching flip-flops
 runs by.

>examine enclosure
 It's a red brick enclosure that houses the pavilion's rest rooms.
 It's only about twice your height, and it looks like there's plenty of
 space between the top of the enclosure and the pavilion's canopy.  Two
 matching doors in the nearest wall are shut.  Hung between them is a
 bronze plaque.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>examine plaque
 The plaque commemorates Tybrisa Pavilion II.  You learn that the
 original Tybrisa Pavilion, built in 1891, played the role of dance
 hall, bandstand, and general tourist attraction, and at one time was a
 popular stop on the Big Band circuit.  It served the local community
 for over three quarters of a century before burning down in 1967.
 Curiously, Tybrisa Pavlion II wasn't built until 1996, nearly 30 years
 after the original's destruction.

 there is no way down.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point

>jump out of the pavilion
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>out
 You can't go that way.

 A young boy wearing a bright blue bathing suit and matching flip-flops
 runs by.

>examine me
 You pause for a moment to take stock of your physical condition.
 You're feeling quite fit and healthy after your week of relaxation and
 exercise.

 A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby
 railing, and then launches itself back into the air.

 sunset.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the
 setting sun streaks through them at just the right angle.

>examine sand
 The beach stretches quite a ways north and south of you, before
 curving out of sight around the contours of Tybee Island.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>go south
 The railing prevents you from walking off the pier.

 A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby
 railing, and then launches itself back into the air.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man jerks and then begins reeling in line furiously.
 Apparently he's had a bite.  The battle between man and nature begins!
 He lets out a bit of line, giving his catch some play, and then
 resumes reeling.  The struggle continues until, at last, the line goes
 slack.  The old man reels and reels, peering over the railing with
 anticipation until his catch is revealed to be... a shrimp.  He glares
 with disgust at it for a moment before removing it from his line and
 tossing it over his shoulder, where it lands at your feet.  He then
 expertly ties a new lure and recasts.

>take shrimp
 Taken.

 The old man draws a cigarette from his breast pocket, rolls it
 meditatively between thumb and forefingers, and then puts it away.

>examine fountain
 It's a waist high silver cabinet with a metal basin on top, just like
 all the other fountains you've ever seen.

 A small child bobbles into the area and tries to sneak up behind the
 old man, only to break out laughing.  The old man jerks in surprise
 and throws the child a long, harsh glare.

>examine shrimo
 I don't know the word "shrimo".

>eat shrimp
 You look with trepidation at the live, wriggling shrimp.  Well, if
 it's good enough for sushi eaters...  You pop the shrimp into your
 mouth and crunch down on it, shell, legs and all.  You're struck with
 a brief sense of nausea that passes as quickly as it came.  The
 shrimp's juices roll over your tongue and trickle down your throat, at
 the same both time sharply salty and subtly sweet. In the end, you
 decide it's not that bad.  Not that bad at all.

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

 The ocean water is too far away.

 The old man pulls back hard on his rod, pulling the line taut.

 The shrimp wriggles in your grasp.

>turn on fountain
 You turn the handle, but nothing happens.  Perhaps the water main has
 been shut off for the night.

 The old man plays out a few lengths of line.

>drop shrimp
 You toss the shrimp to the ground.

 The old man pulls a flask from his pocket and takes a hearty swig.

>ask man about flask

 The slight breeze carries the sound of the old man grumbling to
 himself.

>ask man about shrimp
 He grunts in disgust.  "Danged shrimp keep catching up my line.
 They'll get tied up in anything given half the chance."

 The old man reels in a tiny fish, grunts in disgust, and tosses it
 back.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

>examine gulls
 I don't see any gulls here.

>go north
 Among the Benches
 This patch of the broad pavilion floor seems to be set aside for
 spectators, as there are numerous wooden benches here.  They're neatly
 arranged in two orderly rows.  What with all these benches, you half
 expect to see picnic tables, but there are none.  The main part of the
 pavilion floor sprawls largely to the south.  Beyond that, against the
 southern railing, you can see the brick faced enclosure and the tiny
 snack bar.

 An early evening breeze fills your nose with the tangy scent of brine.

>examine benches
 The benches are made of weathered gray wood.  Each one is about knee
 high and as long as you are tall.  They're neatly arranged in two
 orderly rows.

 There's nothing under the benches.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the

>examine railing
 It looks like many railings you've seen.  A long wooden handrail lies
 at waist height.  Below it at knee height lies a second rail.  Both
 are supported by vertical braces placed every body length or so.  The
 railing surrounds the pavilion on every side, broken only by exits to
 the east and west.  You're currently standing near the southernmost
 section of rail.

 A young, auburn haired woman wearing nothing more than sneakers and an
 incredibly revealing thong bikini jogs past.  Jogging alongside her is
 a darkly-tanned, slim-hipped young man, similarly dressed.

 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.

 A slight gust of wind sends eddies of sand swirling over the brick
 path.

>se
 You skip along the wooden boardwalk to the beach, evoking a strong
 memory of the carefree summer days of your childhood.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.
    You see a mussel shell, lying in the sand.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 A toddler of about four, gurgling excitedly, barrels into the flock of
 gulls.  A flurry of white and grey feathers explodes into the air,
 only to flap back to earth a few feet away.

>take mussel
 Taken.

 From somewhere among the flock you hear a raucous cry that sounds
 suspiciously like "Big Water!"

>examine it
 It's a small shell about the size of your thumb.  The outer surface is
 a mottled black, while the inner is lined with dark, silvery mother of
 pearl.

 From somewhere among the flock you hear a raucous cry that sounds
 suspiciously like "Big Water!"

>examine message
 In letters a hand high, someone has written "Here There Be Dragons."
 Beneath that, they've drawn a simple compass rose with an arrow
 pointing to the northeast.

 A particularly bold or greedy gull waddles right up to your feet to
 seek a handout.  It stares at you with one beady eye for a long,
 uncomfortable moment before returning to the flock.

>examine gulls
 They're a dismaying sight, like an overblown pillow fight with beaks
 and claws. The flock must contain a full hundred birds, and every one
 of them fighting over the same pile of refuse.  In their ongoing
 battle, they peck at both their food and each other.  Occasionally one
 or a few take wing, leapfrogging over the others for dominance.  You'd
 hate to have all those gulls pecking around you.

 The entire flock suddenly erupts in a bout of frenzied screeching for
 no apparent reason.  After a moment or two, they revert to their
 original decibel level.

>examine trash
 You try to wade through the flapping hoard of birds to get at the
 trash, but their greed is greater than their fear of you, and they
 refuse to back down.

 A snowy white gull apparently materializes right in the middle of the
 flock, cranes its neck as if searching for someone, and then
 dematerializes.

>Throw shrimp at gulls
 I don't see any shrimp here.

 You toss the mussel shell among the squabbling hoard.  Several of the
 gulls dash toward it, but quickly find it to be inedible.

 The gulls battle among themselves for dominance over the temporary
 food supply.

 takes notice of your offering and waddles over to investigate.  It
 spots the peanuts, snatches one up, and devours it in a single gulp.

 The entire flock suddenly erupts in a bout of frenzied screeching for
 no apparent reason.  After a moment or two, they revert to their
 original decibel level.

>examine garbage
 You try to wade through the flapping hoard of birds to get at the
 trash, but their greed is greater than their fear of you, and they
 refuse to back down.

 A particularly bold or greedy gull waddles right up to your feet to
 seek a handout.  It stares at you with one beady eye for a long,
 uncomfortable moment before returning to the flock.

 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 clam shell, a sack of peanuts, a sieve, and a mussel shell.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.

 From somewhere among the flock you hear a raucous cry that sounds
 suspiciously like "Big Water!"

 I don't know how to open the mussel shell.

 A new gull, apparently a stranger to the flock, flies low over the
 feeding grounds and sends the other gulls into a screaming rage.

>throw sack at gulls
 You toss a few more peanuts towards the flock of gulls.  The first
 gull pecks hungrily at the peanuts, drawing the attention of some of
 the others.  They flap over to see what the first gull is eating, and
 become embroiled in a minor squabble over the peanuts.

 A toddler of about four, gurgling excitedly, barrels into the flock of
 gulls.  A flurry of white and grey feathers explodes into the air,
 only to flap back to earth a few feet away.

>throw toddler at gulls
 I don't know the word "toddler".

 Two gulls break off from the main flock to fight over a choice morsel.
 A third flies over to investigate, and soon all three fly squawking
 away over the beach.

>empty bag
 Better just leave them in the sack.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

>throw sack at gulls
 Finally, you toss the entire bag of peanuts toward the hungry flock.
 The trickle of curious gulls turns into a flood.  Soon, the entire
 hoard comes flapping and squawking to join the fight over your
 peanuts, abandoning the trash heap in the process.  You couldn't say
 how long the peanuts will keep them busy, but chances are it won't be
 for long.

 Two gulls break off from the main flock to fight over a choice morsel.
 A third flies over to investigate, and soon all three fly squawking

>search trash
 You paw through the trash with your bare hands, but it's been
 scattered and mixed into the powdery sand.  If there's anything useful
 in the pile, it may have been covered with sand.

 A new gull, apparently a stranger to the flock, flies low over the
 feeding grounds and sends the other gulls into a screaming rage.

>dig
 Scooping sand away in great handfuls, you quickly excavate an area
 approximately a yard across and a couple of hand spans deep.  Gravity
 and the slight wind join forces to send the surrounding sand sliding
 into the hole.  You try to dig deeper, but the deeper you go, the more
 sand slides in.  You are reminded unpleasantly of your efforts at
 work.

 The peanuts must be running out.  You can see a few gulls beginning to
 trickle back towards the mound.  The trickle grows to a flood and soon
 the entire flock is in motion, returning to the mound en masse.  No
 trace remains of the peanuts you threw down.  Even the brown paper
 sack is gone.

 I don't know the word "hide".

>go west
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 As you step across the brick path, you stumble lightly on the rough
 bricks.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.

>examine bricks
 Though the pavilion to the east and the row of hotels to the west are
 all recent structures, the rough brick path between them shows great
 age.  These may be some of the very bricks you learned about on your
 riverboat tour of the Savannah River.  According to the tour guide,
 English sailing ships in the 18th and 19th centuries loaded their
 holds with stones to serve as ballast on the long trip across the
 Atlantic.  The stones were unloaded on the shores of Savannah, where
 the ships picked up cotton and other commodities.  Since the stones
 were freely available, many Savannahians began using them as building
 material.  These particular stones, as regular as they are, probably
 came over in a military ship, which would have required precisely
 weighted ballast in its hold.

 You notice that one brick in particular is quite loose.

>move brick
 Which brick do you mean, the path, or the loose brick?

>loose
 Moving the loose brick doesn't reveal anything.

 A slight gust of wind sends eddies of sand swirling over the brick
 path.

>take it
 You're going to need both hands free to carry that sucker.  You'll
 have to drop anything else you're carrying.

 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 clam shell, a sieve, and a mussel shell.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money, your
 passcard, and a steel key.

 The clam shell:  The pair of shorts is not a container.
 The sieve:  The pair of shorts is not a container.

>put shells in pocket
 The clam shell:  You can't fit that in the pocket of your shorts.
 The mussel shell:  You can't fit that in the pocket of your shorts.

 You can't wear the sieve.

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
 wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.

>unlock door with key
 You can't open the rest room doors with the steel key.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.
    You see a shrimp here.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man draws a cigarette from his breast pocket, rolls it
 meditatively between thumb and forefingers, and then puts it away.

 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.  The vendor has gone
 home for the night.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.

 An elderly couple strolls past you, hand in hand, clearly enjoying the
 sunset.

>unlock boiler with key
 I don't know how to unlock the boiler.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the
 setting sun streaks through them at just the right angle.

>open boiler with key
 You can't get the clamp off with the steel key.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>pry clamp with key
 You can't get the clamp off with the steel key.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

 It's a thin, sturdy, triangle of steel.  The open end of the triangle
 holds the boiler's lid tightly in place by pinching it against the
 thin bar that runs around the lip of the boiler.

 You pause for a moment to take stock of your physical condition.
 You're feeling quite fit and healthy after your week of relaxation and
 exercise.

>examine shower
 It's really just a tall water pipe with a shower head on top of it.
 Not much in the way of privacy, but it does help people rinse the sand
 from themselves.

>examine bell
 The bell looks like half of a big white medicine capsule, just a bit
 taller than you, though quite a bit wider.  The open end of the
 capsule stands at about chest height and faces down, so that you could
 enter the bell if you ducked down a bit.  The capsule stands on four
 thick metal struts, which are in turn welded to a heavy, square, metal
 baseplate.  The whole thing looks imposingly heavy.  Deeply set in the
 white metal capsule are several thick, round, glass portholes.

>go west
 You set your feet back on the path to the hotel, but...  you're
 extremely conflicted over this whole idea of quitting.  If only
 someone or something would present you with some convincing arguments
 to get you off the fence.

>enter bell
 You duck your head and shoulders, and crab-walk under the lip of the
 bell.

 In the Diving Bell
 It surrounds you like a sturdy white shell.  The ceiling is only a few
 fingers above your head, causing you to hunch over a bit for fear of
 bashing your skull.  Protruding from the ceiling is a thin pipe that
 ends in an air valve.  Several thick, round portholes look on the
 outside world.

 The bell effectively muffles any outside sound, but an ominous low
 moan fills your ears.

>examine pipe
 Divers used this valve to pressurize the bell's chamber, as well as
 refill their own tanks.  The valve is connected to a pipe that passes
 through the bell's hull.  Presumably there's a similar valve on the
 outside, to allow divers to attach an air hose from a surface ship.

>listen
 The bell is filled with a constant low moan as the light breeze
 reverberates through the hollow chamber.  It's like standing in a
 giant sea shell.

>yell
 You let out a scream that reverberates through the hollow chamber and
 sets your ears ringing.

>exit bell
 You duck your head and crab walk out of the bell.

>go northeast
 You skip along the wooden boardwalk to the beach, evoking a strong
 memory of the carefree summer days of your childhood.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

>look in barrel
 The can must have been emptied recently.  Just a few pieces of sticky
 rubbish, consisting largely of ice cream wrappers and soda cups, lie
 at the bottom of the can.

>search rubbish
 You root through the trash, tossing aside ice cream wrappers and soft
 drink cups.  You find an empty glass soda bottle, which you take.

>search rubbish
 You root through the trash, tossing aside ice cream wrappers and soft

>examine barrel
 It actually consists of two concentric cylinders.  The outer cylinder
 is made of rough wooden staves bound by three rusty metal hoops.  The
 inner cylinder is a single piece of textured beige plastic.  A strong
 steel chain passes through the topmost of the metal hoops, attaching
 the barrel to the end of the boardwalk.  A few pieces of trash lie at
 the bottom of the barrel.

 You'd just be making a mess of the beach.  Better leave the trash in
 the barrel.

>examine hoops
 Three rusty hoops bind the outer, wooden ring of the barrel together.
 The topmost hoop is bent slightly out of shape to accommodate the
 heavy steel chain that passes through it.  In fact, it seems to be a
 bit loose.

>get top hoop
 You manage to jam your finger tips beneath the topmost hoop.  It
 wiggles a bit, but it's still too tight for you to remove with your
 bare hands.

 A slight gust raises a thin skein of sand and whips it across your
 ankles.

>examine goggles
 It's a cheap pair of plastic swim goggles, held together by a thin,
 white rubber strap.

>examine strap
 It's a strap made of thin, white rubber.  If it were removed from the
 goggles, it looks as if it would measure about the length of your arm.

 You grab hold of the chain and give it a solid tug.  Oof!  It's not
 going anywhere.  Maybe if you had a hacksaw, or some bolt cutters.

>examine sculpture
 It's some sort of big reptile, longer than you are tall.  You can't
 tell much more from here, as it lies in the wet sand to the east.

>go east
 The warm dry sand gives way to cool wet sand as you move closer to the
 shoreline.

 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass
 through the pylons supporting the long pier that stretches east from
 the pavilion.
    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be
 some sort of reptile.

>examine sculpture
 The enormous sand sculpture is almost twice as long as you are tall,
 and stands nearly to your shoulder.  It's some sort of huge, scaly
 reptile, basking on its swollen belly in the evening light.  Lying
 flat against its sides are a pair of batlike wings that sprout from a
 ridged, bony spine.  The spine curves down and around, ending in a
 massive, coiled tail.  Two plump hind legs sprawl out in back, while a
 pair of short, stubby arms lies crossed beneath an angular head full
 of sharp looking teeth.

 You note that certain parts of the creature, including its spine,
 claws, eyes, and teeth consist of carefully placed sea shells.  The
 shells give the creature an illusory realism.  Curiously, there is an
 empty cavity in the creature's beak that looks as if it might once
 have held a shell.

 All in all, the dragon seems surprisingly realistic, as if it had
 recently clawed its way out of the sand to warm itself beneath the
 bright sun.

 You move towards the dragon...  but halt with a sudden flash of
 insight.  In your mind, you picture someone spending hours digging up
 and piling the sand, pushing it into rough form, carefully smoothing
 the curves and contours, detailing the fingers and face, collecting
 shells for the dorsal ridge...  You carefully back away, and as you
 do, it almost seems that one of the dragon's heavy lidded eyes opens,
 and favors you with a long, lazy wink.

 A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes
 before gently receding.

 Which shell do you mean, the clam shell, or the mussel shell?

 The dragon sculpture is not a container.

 You try setting the clam shell into the cavity.  Nothing happens, and
 somehow, it just doesn't feel right.  Disappointed, you reclaim the
 clam shell.

 You try setting the mussel shell into the cavity.  Nothing happens,
 and somehow, it just doesn't feel right.  Disappointed, you reclaim
 the mussel shell.

 It's a shallow cavity about the size of your two cupped palms, in both
 depth and circumference.  There's nothing in it.

>examine head
 Which head do you mean, your head, or the dragon's head?

>examine dragon's head
 The dragon's angular head rests limply on the dragon's crossed arms.
 Its mouth is full of sharp-looking teeth, while its beak is home to a
 curiously empty cavity.

>examine my head
 It's your head.  You've had it for years.

>put my head in cavity
 You try setting your head into the cavity.  Nothing happens, and
 somehow, it just doesn't feel right.  Disappointed, you reclaim your
 head.

>examine dragon's teeth
 It's an angular slit bissecting the long birdlike beak.  A mouthful of
 shells gives the dragon a cartoonish, picket fence grin.

>examine dragon's scales
 I don't know the word "scales".

>examine dragon's tale
 I don't know the word "tale".

>oops til
 I don't know the word "til".

>examine dragon's tail.
 The tail is long and fat, and coils dramatically around the dragon's
 body.

>examine wings
 The dragon's wings are ribbed like a bats, and lie folded up against
 the dragon's swollen belly.  Even though they're made of sand, they
 someone manage to look tough and leathery.

>sit on dragon
 I don't know how to sit on the dragon sculpture.

>go north
 You strike off up the beach, but don't want to wander too far from
 your hotel, so after a while you head back.

>go south
 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    You see a crab shell, lying in the sand.

 A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from
 the pipes running overhead.

>examine crab shell
 It's the carapace of some sort of crab.  The edges of the shell come
 to sharp points, almost like a serrated blade, while the surface is
 mottled with deep shades of red and blue.

 A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes
 before gently receding.

>get it
 You've already got your hands full.

>put shells in seive

 The mussel shell:  You can't fit that in the sieve.
 The crab shell:  You can't fit that in the sieve.

>go west
 Under Pavilion
 You're in a low space beneath the pavilion, which is supported by
 massive cement pylons.  Two metal pipes extrude from the cement above
 you and bend east to follow the pier.  The beach lies east through an
 opening in the dunes, and a closed wire mesh gate leads to a small
 storage area to the west.

>examine gate
 It's an ordinary wire mesh gate that seals off the storage area.  A
 smooth steel plate set in the gate houses a simple lock.  Currently,
 the gate is closed and locked.

 Storage Area
 You're in a small, cement walled room.  But for the open gate in the
 east face, it would be one big cement cube.  Apparently it's used as a
 storage area for recyclable trash, as there are two big blue recycling
 canisters here, one containing glass bottles, the other aluminum cans.
 Against the rear wall is a large bin full of used paper products.
 Next to that is a plain looking utility table over which is hung a peg
 board.

 You toss the steel key to the ground.

>examine board
 It's a square piece of perforated cork board, hung with a variety of
 unrecognizable tools and useless spare parts.  In fact, the only item
 that looks to be of any use at all is a thin, tapered strip of metal
 resembling a crowbar.

>get crowbar
 You've already got your hands full.

>inventory
 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 sieve, a mussel shell, a single glass bottle, and a pair of goggles.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.

 You slide the cheap white strap over your head and slide the goggles
 down over your eyes.  They make an adequate, if uninspiring, seal.

>take crowbar
 Taken.

>go east
 Under Pavilion
 You're in a low space beneath the pavilion, which is supported by
 massive cement pylons.  Two metal pipes extrude from the cement above
 you and bend east to follow the pier.  The beach lies east through an
 opening in the dunes, and an open wire mesh gate leads to a small
 storage area to the west.

>go south
 Great dunes of sand, piled up against the pillars supporting the
 pavilion, block your exit in that direction.

>go east
 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    You see a crab shell, lying in the sand.

 A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from
 the pipes running overhead.

>go south
 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.
    Someone has built an odd little castle just above the tide line.

>examine castle
 It's very unusual.  You've never seen a sand castle like this one.
 Instead of the usual overturned-pail-full-of-sand method, this castle
 seems to have been made of little beaded droplets of wet sand, stacked
 capriciously atop each other into miniature spires and minnarets.
 Several thin spires climb skyward, rising to about knee height, and a
 narrow band spirals around the whole construction from base to top.
 It almost looks like the whole thing was grown, rather than built,
 like the crystals that sprout from the "Grow Your Own Crystals!"  kits
 that are so popular at boardwalk novelty shops.  Now that you've
 noticed it, the castle even seems to have a certain glassy sheen.

 The castle is inhabited by some sort of insects, or tiny crustaceans,
 that crawl all over and through it.

 A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes

 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass

 the pavilion.
    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be
 some sort of reptile.

 You strike off up the beach, but don't want to wander too far from

>go west
 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

 A slight gust raises a thin skein of sand and whips it across your
 ankles.

>go west
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There seems to be a loose brick in the path.

 A slight gust of wind sends eddies of sand swirling over the brick

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
 wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the
 setting sun streaks through them at just the right angle.

    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

>pry hoop
 You set down the other stuff you were carrying to free your hands.
 Then you slide the crowbar beneath the deformed hoop where it meets
 the steel chain, and ratchet it back and forth, trying to loosen the
 hoop.  The hoop slides up a hair's breadth, then catches on a link of
 the chain.  You remove the crowbar and shift your point of attack to
 the chain.  As you apply pressure to the recalcitrant link, it bites
 into the soft wooden stave beneath it.  You keep pushing, and...
 crack!  The force applied to the link splits the stave lengthwise,
 dividing a thin slice from the trunk of the stave.  The thin slice now
 bears the brunt of the metal hoop's tension, while the main part of
 the stave is free of it.

>take stave
 You set down the crowbar and then seize the top end of the stave with
 both hands.  Though it's no longer bound by the top hoop, the two
 lower hoops still put a lot of tension on it.  Nevertheless, you grit
 your teeth and rock the stave back and forth, until it finally scrapes
 free of the barrel.

>examine stave
 It's a long, heavy, slightly curved piece of wood.

>take hoop
 Which hoop do you mean, the two bottom hoops, or the third hoop?

 You manage to jam your finger tips beneath the topmost hoop.  It

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of

 The castle is inhabited by some sort of insects, or tiny crustaceans,

 You lean in to take a close look.  They're too tiny to see much
 detail, but there are hundreds of them zipping around the tall spires.
 They seem to be crustaceans.  Or maybe some kind of insect.  In any
 case, they have six legs.  Or maybe eight.  Call yourself crazy, but
 it looks like some of them are carrying grains of sand.  You lean in
 further, and on closer inspection are able to confirm your theory.
 Then, right before your eyes, a small cluster of mites carries a bit
 of shiny something, perhaps a speck of broken glass, into the castle.
 They bring it to the very top of the tallest spire.  Somehow, they
 melt down the shiny fragment and assimilate into the castle.  Perhaps
 it's just your imagination, but you'd swear there was a miniscule
 plume of smoke curling about the spire.

 I don't know the word "call".

 You're in a small, cement walled room.  But for the open gate in the
 east face, it would be one big cement cube.  Apparently it's used as a
 storage area for recyclable trash, as there are two big blue recycling
 canisters here, one containing glass bottles, the other aluminum cans.
 Against the rear wall is a large bin full of used paper products.
 Next to that is a plain looking utility table over which is hung a peg
 board.

 with your wounded hand, but the creature has already been dislodged.
 You look at the tiny red welt already swelling on the heel of your
 palm.  Is it...  smoking?  No, it must be just an illusion caused by
 your sudden state of distress.  But you'd swear you saw a tiny plume
 of smoke rising from your palm.

>put insect in bottle
 It's difficult, because they're so small...  but you lean in close,

 the mouth of the bottle.  Just as you're beginning to enjoy your
 mighty triumph, you detect a sudden whiff of burning glass.  You peer
 into the bottle to discover that the mite is burning a tiny hole
 straight through the bottom!  The mite leaps out and disappears into
 the beach sand, leaving behind only a tiny drop of molten glass which
 cools instantly, resealing the hole.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles
 away, quickly disappearing into another, equally invisible hole.

 You toss the bottle among the castle's spires.  It lies for a moment,
 unnoticed.  Then, a lone crustacean investigates.  You see a single,
 tiny plume of smoke.  Suddenly, as if on a prearranged signal, the
 mighty miniature hoards descend.  More swiftly than you can follow,
 the tiny mites somehow disassemble the glass bottle and assimilate its
 mass into the castle.  As the bottle disappears, the castle grows.  By
 the time the bottle is completely gone, the castle has grown a new
 spire.

 Far overhead, a pair of thick metal pipes run the length of the pier,
 suspended a few fingers beneath the pier's concrete underbelly.
 Presumably, they carry water to and from the pavilion's rest rooms and

 object, perhaps a glass lens, caught in the space between the pipe and
 the cement ceiling.

 two above the ground and slide it out into the sand beneath the

 the ocean.  You chase after it, but it's picking up speed.  You
 redouble your efforts to catch it, and it looks like you just...
 might...  make it...  Splash!  The canister goes into the water and
 starts drifting out to sea.  It shrinks into the distance between the
 long row of pylons, becoming smaller and smaller.  Soon, the canister
 has drifted out of sight.

 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    You see a crab shell, lying in the sand.

 A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from
 the pipes running overhead.

>undo
 (Undoing one command)

 Under Pavilion
 You're in a low space beneath the pavilion, which is supported by
 massive cement pylons.  Two metal pipes extrude from the cement above
 you and bend east to follow the pier.  The beach lies east through an
 opening in the dunes, and an open wire mesh gate leads to a small
 storage area to the west.
    You see an aluminum recycling canister here.

>go west
 Storage Area
 You're in a small, cement walled room.  But for the open gate in the
 east face, it would be one big cement cube.  Apparently it's used as a
 storage area for recyclable trash, as there's a big blue recycling
 canister here, containing glass bottles.  Against the rear wall is a
 large bin full of used paper products.  Next to that is a plain
 looking utility table over which is hung a peg board.
    You see a steel key here.

>go west
 The solid cement wall prevents you from exiting in that direction.

>push glass canister east
 You give the glass recycling canister a tentative shove.  It proves to
 be surprisingly heavy.  You bend at the knees and put your shoulder to
 it.  Pushing against the hard cement floor, you manage to slide the
 canister out into the sand beneath the pavilion.

>again
 You put your shoulder to the canister again and try to move it further
 east, fighting the friction of the sandy floor.  Sand piles up against
 the leading edge of the canister, but still you struggle onward,
 making slow progress.  You make it almost to the far end of the
 pavilion, where the canister freezes in the sand.  You brace yourself
 and try to force it with a good, strong shove...  until crash!  the
 canister goes over on its side, and you with it.  You look up to find
 that the canister has begun rolling down the slope towards the ocean.
 You chase after it, but it's picking up speed.  It continues its
 descent, heading towards one of the pier's cement pylons.  You
 redouble your efforts to catch it, and it looks like you just...
 might...  make it...  Crash!  The canister rebounds off the pylon and
 shatters with a hideous cacophony, spewing bottles and chunks of thin
 blue plastic in a rain of broken glass.

 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass
 through the pylons supporting the long pier that stretches east from
 the pavilion.
    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be
 some sort of reptile.

 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There seems to be a loose brick in the path.
    You see a crowbar, a broken stave, a pair of goggles (being worn),
 a sieve, and a mussel shell here.

>drop crab shell
 You toss the crab shell to the ground.

 A slight gust of wind sends eddies of sand swirling over the brick
 path.

 You rock the brick back and forth a bit, and manage to pry it from its
 berth.  Oof!  It's heavy!  It takes both hands to carry it, and the
 muscles in your lower back protest as you straighten up.  You'd better
 decide where you want to go now, because you won't be able to carry it
 for too long.

>drop brick
 Relieved of the brick's weight, you quickly straighten up.  All your
 aching body parts cry out in relief.  You flex your hands to loosen
 them up, then plant them at your sides and bend backwards until you
 feel your spine crack.  Ahh!

>go northeast
 You skip along the wooden boardwalk to the beach, evoking a strong
 memory of the carefree summer days of your childhood.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but

>go north
 You strike off up the beach, but you don't want to wander too far from
 your hotel, so after a while you head back.

>examine dunes
 Tall, wind swept dunes stand between you and the hotels to the west,
 and also flank the base of the pavilion.  The dunes are dotted with
 tall, scraggly sea-oats.

 I don't know the word "sow".

>xyzzy
 The word escapes your mouth like a gentle zephyr and swirls in the air
 around you.  You can feel powerful forces gathering, like a static
 charge before a storm.  You glance around in anticipation.  A long
 moment passes, but nothing happens.  Then, a distant bass rumble
 begins, somewhere far, far away.  You can feel the distant vibrations
 in the soles of your feet, and the rumbling grows steadily louder and
 louder until you fear an earthquake must be approaching.  The surf
 becomes violently choppy, throwing up pounding waves that come
 crashing onto shore.  Then, in the eastern distance, an incredible
 sight.  Some...  thing, some enormous, unimaginably big thing as big
 as an island rises from the sea, rivulets of water streaming down its
 back and sides.  Even from here you can see that its rugged, craggy
 flesh is cut through with channels like ancient ravines, from which
 sprout entire forests of flora.  A mouth wide enough to swallow your
 entire hotel is lined with jagged, discolored teeth at least as big as
 you are, and one cold, round eye the size of a wading pool penetrates
 the distance to stare right at you.  You can actually feel the
 impossible beast considering you, as if judging the worth of your very
 soul, and you shrivel beneath the intense scrutiny of that piercing
 eye.  The examination seems to drag on forever, until at last, the eye
 turns away.  The incredible mouth slowly draws open in a terrifying
 grimace that seems to drain half the ocean, and a sound like all the
 trumpets of heaven proclaiming judgment day thunders across the beach,
 rattling every stick and bone in its path.  The echoes are still
 reverberating up and down the beach moments later, when the beast
 heaves its massive, ponderous bulk back beneath the waves.  As it
 disappears once more into the sea, a name from the old testament
 suddenly pops into your head.  Leviathan.  And as the crashing surf
 slowly returns to its once gentle nature, you realize that whatever
 verdict was decided here today will remain forever hidden from you
 beneath the implacable depths.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles

>examine dragon
 The enormous sand sculpture is almost twice as long as you are tall,
 and stands nearly to your shoulder.  It's some sort of huge, scaly
 reptile, basking on its swollen belly in the evening light.  Lying
 flat against its sides are a pair of batlike wings that sprout from a
 ridged, bony spine.  The spine curves down and around, ending in a
 massive, coiled tail.  Two plump hind legs sprawl out in back, while a
 pair of short, stubby arms lies crossed beneath an angular head full
 of sharp looking teeth.

 You note that certain parts of the creature, including its spine,
 claws, eyes, and teeth consist of carefully placed sea shells.  The
 shells give the creature an illusory realism.  Curiously, there is an
 empty cavity in the creature's beak that looks as if it might once
 have held a shell.

 All in all, the dragon seems surprisingly realistic, as if it had
 recently clawed its way out of the sand to warm itself beneath the
 bright sun.

 The surf glides up to meet you as you approach the water, a cool shock

 Shallow Water, North of Pier
 The surf swells around your knees, occasionally surging up to your
 waist.  You can crawl up onto the beach to the west, where someone has
 built a large sand sculpture above the ebbing surf, or swim into
 deeper water to the east.  To the south, you can pass through the
 cement pylons supporting the pier.

 The long pier finally comes to an end, the last of its supporting
 pylons disappearing into the murky depths below.  To the east lies
 nothing but endless ocean.  The welcoming sands of the beach lie back
 to the west.  Or you can strike off north or south, parallel to the
 shoreline.

>examine pylons
 Twin rows of cement pylons support the long pier.  Each pair of pylons
 is a single unit resembling a truncated letter 'A'.  Here in deeper
 water, the pylons rise an unknown height from the murky depths.

>climb pylons
 You paddle up to a promising looking pylon, receiving a few minor
 bruises as the tide pushes you against the rough cement.
 Nevertheless, you cling to the inclined outside face and reach for the
 opposite side...  but no matter how hard you stretch, it's just too
 wide for you to get your arms around.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The sandy ocean floor lies about ten feet below the surface, layered
 with silt and dotted with climbing green fingers of sea grass.  The
 angled cement pillars that support the pier end here.  Just beyond the
 final pair of pillars is a sudden drop off, a steep slope that leads
 down and down, far beyond your limited visibility.

>examine pillars
 The pylons supporting the pier come to an end here, mere feet from the
 sudden steep dropoff in the ocean floor.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

>go up
 Lungs burning, you kick and claw your way toward the glittering
 sunlight above you.  Gasping, you break the surface and fill your
 lungs with the salty ocean air.

>go south
 You glide to the south with a smooth breast stroke.

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)
 There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters
 beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to
 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

 A gentle wave laps by, setting you bobbing in the current.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The gradually sloping ocean floor is only about ten feet below the
 surface here.  The sandy bottom is layered with a suspension of mud
 and fine silt.  Here and there, thin leaved plants claw through the
 mud like grasping fingers.  Dominating the entire area is an enormous
 slab of barnacle encrusted rock.
    Resting on the rock is a great conch shell.

>get shell
 As you reach for the attractive looking shell, it suddenly sprouts
 legs and scuttles into a deep fissure that bisects the rock!
 Apparently, the shell is home to some sort of crab.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

 The crab, which had resumed its perch on top of the rock, scuttles
 back into the fissure on your approach.

>examine rock
 It's a huge slab of porous, white rock, longer than you are tall and
 rising half your height from the muck of the ocean floor.  Its
 scabrous surface has been eroded cruelly by time and tide, and a deep
 fissure cuts through it, nearly cleaving it in two.  Tiny creatures
 crawl through the barnacles encrusting its gnarled surface, and small,
 broad leaved plants cling tenaciously to it.

 A few small bubbles escape your lips, glittering in the light as they
 rise towards the surface.

 The crab sends forth one probing eye stalk, then hastily withdraws it.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

 A rather large wave surges over your head, leaving you momentarily
 sputtering.

>go west
 You kick back towards shore, skimming along for a few yards before
 coming to rest in shallower water.

 Shallow Water, South of Pier
 You're up to your knees in the gently surging tide.  It flows up onto
 the beach to the west and grows deeper to the east.  To the north, you
 can pass among the pylons supporting the pier.

>go north
 Shallow Water, Beneath Pier
 The knee-deep water here is cooled by the shadow of the pier, which
 here rises to almost three times your height.  A pair of metal pipes
 run the length of it, presumably a part of the pavilion's plumbing.
 The avenue of supporting pylons leads west, on to the sand, and also
 continued into deeper water to the east.  You can escape the pier's
 chilly shadow to the north or south.

>go west
 You splash merrily out of the shallow water, on to the hard packed
 sand.

 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    The beach is littered with broken bottles and blue plastic shards.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles
 away, quickly disappearing into another, equally invisible hole.

 A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from
 the pipes running overhead.

>examine broken bottles
 The bottles litter the beach, many of them shattered into sharp,
 dangerous fragments.  Spread among the broken glass are numerous thin,
 blue, plastic shards, the only remainders of the recycling canister.

>get broken bottles
 You've already got one.  If you want to take another, perhaps you
 should dispose of that one first.

>inventory
 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 pair of goggles (being worn), and a single glass bottle (containing
 salt water).
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.

>go south
 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.
    Someone has built an odd little castle just above the tide line.

>pour water on castle

 The salt water spills out of the glass bottle and rejoins the
 elements.

>put insect in bottle
 It's difficult, because they're so small...  but you lean in close,
 follow one likely specimen, and...  got it!  You cram the mite through
 the mouth of the water filled the bottle.  It worked!  You've got it!
 The tiny mite is floating around on the surface of the water.  Uh oh.
 You watch as the mite begins to paddle its six (or eight) legs
 furiously, headed for the bottom of the bottle.  Whatever you're going
 to do with the mite, you'd better do it soon.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles

 The mite continues its furious paddling.  It's almost to the bottom of
 the bottle.

 A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from
 the pipes running overhead.

>pour salt water on broken bottles
 You toss the bottle containing the mite onto the pile, where it
 shatters on impact.  For a moment, nothing happens.  Then you detect a
 tiny whiff of smoke. Other than that, still nothing.  You're just
 about ready to give up on your plan when you spot a writhing black
 line in the sand.  Holy cow!  It's a living stream made up of the tiny
 crustaceans.  Seconds later they swarm over the pile of broken glass.
 Before your astonished eyes they start dissolving the bottles and
 shards into tiny molten beads.  They carry the fiery glass to the
 middle of the pile.  Then come the towers, sprouting like overgrown
 stacks of soap bubbles.  The bulbous, head-sized building blocks
 budding before you are actually rough spheres of sand-filled glass.
 Apparently, with such an abundance of material to work with, the mites
 are building on a much larger scale.  Higher and higher climb the
 towers, until they nearly brush the bottom of the pier.  An abrupt
 flash of color catches your eye.  A sheet of thin blue plastic, once
 part of the glass recycling canister, is floating across the floor.
 Now that you've noticed it, there are pieces of plastic in motion all
 around you, each levitating a fraction of an inch above the ground.
 Instead of melting the plastic down, the mites carry the sheets to the
 perimeters of the tower and begin incorporating them into a spiraling
 ramp.  Step by step, the ramp corkscrews up and around until it wraps
 the pinnacle of the tallest tower. Finally, all growth ceases.  The
 finished structure looms over twice your height.

 Somehow this amazing spectacle has cut through your ingrained layers
 of cynicism to revitalize your waning belief in a world full of
 wondrous novelty.  It's enough to get you thinking about work again,
 in particular the way the same backdrop day after day has dulled your
 expectation for novelty.

 You're feeling confused.  "I didn't realize how serious I was about
 quitting," is what you're now thinking.  The truth is, you didn't
 really believe you were going to find the motivation to quit here on
 the beach.  But it's hard to ignore the wonder of what you've seen.
 Maybe you really could quit.  Still, you're going to need a lot more
 convincing.

 Looking around, you spot one ancient, discolored bottle that was
 passed up by the mites.

 I don't know the word "ssos2".

>examine bottle
 It's an ancient rum bottle, aged to the color of dull copper, and
 sealed with a thick sheath of blood red wax.  Much of its surface has
 been tinged an opaque sea green by the elements.  Ribbons of oily
 color twist through the splotchy patches of copper and green.

 A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from
 the pipes running overhead.

 Age and the elements have frosted the bottle nearly opaque, so you
 hold it up to the light of the setting sun.  The orange rays flash
 through the bottle's glossy patina, casting a dazzling kaleidoscope
 into your eyes.  The burst of light reveals what seems to be a rolled
 up sheet of parchment.  You start peeling the aged wax from the
 bottle.  It's so desiccated that it crumbles into flakes which float
 away on the light evening breeze.  The cork pulls loose from the
 bottle with a small pop.  You insert a finger into the bottle and
 slide out a rolled up parchment.  Unrolling it reveals...  a treasure
 map!  It must be at least a hundred years old.  Clearly, it was
 fashioned in another time.  Thick black strokes grace the rich
 parchment, drawn in a purposeful hand.  Fanciful trace works embellish
 the borders, and a spidery compass rose resides in one corner.  The
 black strokes describe the chain of islands dominating the Savannah
 coast.  One island in particular bears a bold red X.  You examine the
 marker closer.  Why, that's right here on Tybee Island!

>read map

 A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes
 before gently receding.

>examine structure
 I don't know the word "structure".

>examine ramp
 You feel as though you're looking at the original castle through a
 microscope.  Everything looks quite similar, from the beaded droplets
 to the climbing towers, but oh, so much larger.  The rounded building
 blocks of this castle are nearly the size of your head, and the
 tallest spires stand well over twice your height, climbing nearly to
 the underside of the pier.  The ramp that spirals up and around the
 tower's circumference is paved with sheets of blue plastic and seems
 wide enough to stand on.  Swarming over and through the castle's
 glossy crystalline surface are hoards of the tiny crustacean castle
 builders.

>look
 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting

 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    A great crystalline castle dominates the area, rising nearly to the
 underside of the pier.

>go up
 Decided to grow wings, have you?

 A flash of light catches your eyes.  It seems to have originated from
 the pipes running overhead.

>climb ramp
 With great trepidation, you set one foot on the lowest part of the
 spiral ramp. It supports your weight.  You try the other foot.  When
 the ramp fails to collapse, you start climbing, slowly, carefully,
 leaning on the nearby towers for support.  Thank goodness for the blue
 plastic sheets inlaid in the ramp.  Without them, the glassy surface
 would be far too slick to climb.  You circle the castle once, twice,
 three times, four, all the while looking nervously up at the needle
 sharp spires.  Eventually, the ramp becomes too narrow for you to
 continue any further.  But, by bracing one foot against the topmost
 spire and standing on the toes of the other, you can just reach the
 pipes above.  You reach for the shining object and...  Ahh!  Your foot
 glides off the glossy spire and you fall to your behind on the ramp.
 Gravity takes over and sends you sliding down the ramp, rear end
 scraping blue plastic through turn after turn.  Finally, you slide
 into the sand at the base of the castle, unharmed.  Wow!  What a trip!
 Only then do you discover that you succeeded in pulling down the
 reflective object, because you've still got it clenched tightly in
 your white knuckled fist.

 You examine the object to discover that you've retrieved a black
 banded scuba mask.

>examine mask
 It's an expensive looking scuba mask.  The lens is a single large
 piece of glass, sides angled back to offer a wider field of vision.
 The lens is sealed on all sides with thick, black rubber, and held
 together by an equally tough neoprene strap.

>examine neoprene strap
 The strap is made of thick, black neoprene, the same stuff wetsuits
 are made of.  It's only about as broad as your thumb where it meets
 the mask, but it fans out nearly to the breadth of your hand where it
 presses against the back of your head.

>wear mask
 You try to put the mask on over the goggles, but it doesn't fit.

>remove goggles
 You strip the goggles off of your head.

>wear mask
 You pull back the tough strap and slide the mask over your head.  It

    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be

    You see a mussel shell, a crab shell, a clam shell, and a snail
 shell, lying in the sand.

 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

 A slight gust raises a thin skein of sand and whips it across your
 ankles.

>go southwest
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a crowbar, a broken stave, a sieve, and a loose brick here.

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
 wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.
    You see a shrimp here.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

>take shrimp
 Taken.

 The old man stares grimly at the sun, as if daring it to sink any
 lower.

>dive off pier
 The old man watches with flinty eyes as you climb over the railing and
 maneuver yourself so that you're standing on your heels facing out
 with your toes hanging out over empty space.  You steel yourself, take
 a deep breath, and...  jump!  You ready yourself for a neat
 cannonball, but the water rushes up faster than you anticipated.
 You're still trying to bend your legs into position when splash!  You
 hit the water with a stinging impact that burns your buttocks and the
 backs of your thighs.  The water you displaced now comes rushing back
 in to slap painfully at your ears.  Your momentum carries you several
 feet underwater, but you quickly rise, sputtering, to the surface.
 You seem to have lost several of your posessions in the fall.

 Deep Water, Beneath Pier, (treading water)
 The long pier finally comes to an end, the last of its supporting
 pylons disappearing into the murky depths below.  To the east lies

 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The sandy ocean floor lies about ten feet below the surface, layered
 with silt and dotted with climbing green fingers of sea grass.  The
 angled cement pillars that support the pier end here.  Just beyond the
 final pair of pillars is a sudden drop off, a steep slope that leads
 down and down, far beyond your limited visibility.

>go down
 With a strong kick, you propel yourself towards the depths beyond the
 slope.  Visibility dims slightly as you move away from the warming
 light of the sun, and the pillars fall away behind you.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope continues its sharp descent, inclining almost vertically.
 Though the level of ambient light has diminished, the sun still shines
 down strongly, fluttering on the surface above you.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

>go down
 You continue your drop down the face of the slope.  The temperature
 drops severely as you pass through a thermocline, and the mounting
 pressure makes your ears ache.  You pinch your nose shut with thumb
 and forefinger, and exhale gently to clear the pressure.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope just keeps on descending.  The amount of sunlight that
 reaches you has diminished quite a bit and the water has become quite
 cold.  Below you all is dark, but for a small glint of light hinting
 through the darkness.
    Half buried in the mud of the steep slope is some sort of wire
 frame construction.

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

>take wire
 You give the trap a tentative yank, but it's buried too deeply in the
 face of the slope to come free.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first
 feelings of panic and setting your heart racing.

>go up
 Lungs burning, you kick and claw your way toward the glittering
 sunlight above you.  You rise and rise and can't climb fast enough and
 finally, just when you don't think you're going to make it, you break
 the surface.  Gasping, you break the surface and fill your lungs with
 the salty ocean air.

 Tall, sea-oat-covered dunes block your way.

>go southwest
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a crowbar, a broken stave, a sieve, and a loose brick here.

 A slight gust of wind sends eddies of sand swirling over the brick
 path.

>e.e.e.
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
 wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.

 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
 horizon.

 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.
    You see a strapless pair of goggles, an antique bottle, a cork, a
 treasure map, a white rubber strap, and a shrimp here.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man reels in a tiny fish, grunts in disgust, and tosses it
 back.

>dive off of pier
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>dive off pier
 The old man watches with flinty eyes as you climb over the railing and
 maneuver yourself so that you're standing on your heels facing out
 with your toes hanging out over empty space.  You steel yourself, take
 a deep breath, and...  jump!  You ready yourself for a neat
 cannonball, but the water rushes up faster than you anticipated.
 You're still trying to bend your legs into position when splash!  You
 hit the water with a stinging impact that burns your buttocks and the
 backs of your thighs.  The water you displaced now comes rushing back
 in to slap painfully at your ears.  Your momentum carries you several
 feet underwater, but you quickly rise, sputtering, to the surface.
 You seem to have lost one of your posessions in the fall.

 Deep Water, Beneath Pier, (treading water)
 The long pier finally comes to an end, the last of its supporting
 pylons disappearing into the murky depths below.  To the east lies
 nothing but endless ocean.  The welcoming sands of the beach lie back
 to the west.  Or you can strike off north or south, parallel to the
 shoreline.
    You see a broken stave, bobbing on the waves.

>take stave
 Taken.

>d.d.d.
 You try to dive below the surface, but the buoyancy of the stave
 prevents you from going under.

>go west
 You kick back towards shore, skimming along for a few yards before
 coming to rest in shallower water.

 Shallow Water, Beneath Pier
 The knee-deep water here is cooled by the shadow of the pier, which
 here rises to almost three times your height.  A pair of metal pipes
 run the length of it, presumably a part of the pavilion's plumbing.
 The avenue of supporting pylons leads west, on to the sand, and also
 continued into deeper water to the east.  You can escape the pier's
 chilly shadow to the north or south.

>go west
 You splash merrily out of the shallow water, on to the hard packed
 sand.

 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    A great crystalline castle dominates the area, rising nearly to the
 underside of the pier.

>drop stave
 You toss the broken stave to the ground.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles
 away, quickly disappearing into another, equally invisible hole.

>go east
 The surf glides up to meet you as you approach the water, a cool shock
 against your warm skin.

 nothing but endless ocean.  The welcoming sands of the beach lie back

 A rather large wave surges over your head, leaving you momentarily
 sputtering.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The sandy ocean floor lies about ten feet below the surface, layered
 with silt and dotted with climbing green fingers of sea grass.  The
 angled cement pillars that support the pier end here.  Just beyond the
 final pair of pillars is a sudden drop off, a steep slope that leads
 down and down, far beyond your limited visibility.

>go down
 With a strong kick, you propel yourself towards the depths beyond the
 slope.  Visibility dims slightly as you move away from the warming
 light of the sun, and the pillars fall away behind you.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope continues its sharp descent, inclining almost vertically.
 Though the level of ambient light has diminished, the sun still shines
 down strongly, fluttering on the surface above you.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

>go down
 You continue your drop down the face of the slope.  The temperature
 drops severely as you pass through a thermocline, and the mounting
 pressure makes your ears ache.  You pinch your nose shut with thumb
 and forefinger, and exhale gently to clear the pressure.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope just keeps on descending.  The amount of sunlight that
 reaches you has diminished quite a bit and the water has become quite
 cold.  Below you all is dark, but for a small glint of light hinting
 through the darkness.
    Half buried in the mud of the steep slope is some sort of wire
 frame construction.

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

>examine wire
 The construction's function isn't immediately obvious, so you clear
 away some of the mud surrounding it.  It turns out to be a rough box
 made of wooden slats and chicken wire.  There's a gaping hole in one
 face, where something has punched through the wire and splintered the
 surrounding slats.  Apparently, it's a busted up lobster trap.
 Needless to say, the trap is empty.  In the process of uncovering the
 trap, you've also revealed a short length of thick rope that's tied to
 it.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first
 feelings of panic and setting your heart racing.

>take rope
 You'll have to untie the length of rope from the busted trap first.

 Your lungs are on fire and blue blood pounds in your veins, setting
 off waves of panic.  You can control yourself no longer!  Instinct
 takes over and sends you kicking and clawing your way to the surface.
 You rise and rise and can't climb fast enough and finally, just when
 you don't think you're going to make it, you break the surface.  You
 sputter and gasp, inhaling deeply of the fresh salty air.  After a few
 moments, the fire in your lungs subsides and calm is restored to your
 pounding veins.

    The length of rope waves in the current, anchored to the busted

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

>untie rope
 You detach the length of rope from the busted trap.

 A few small bubbles escape your lips, glittering in the light as they
 rise towards the surface.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first
 feelings of panic and setting your heart racing.

>go up
 Lungs burning, you kick and claw your way toward the glittering
 sunlight above you.  You rise and rise and can't climb fast enough and
 finally, just when you don't think you're going to make it, you break

 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the

 that this is the spot indicated on the map.  As you continue to dig,
 gravity and the slight wind join forces to send the surrounding sand
 sliding into the hole.  You can see that you're going to need a better

    You see a mussel shell, a crab shell, and a snail shell, lying in
 the sand.

 A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes
 before gently receding.

 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

 A slight gust raises a thin skein of sand and whips it across your
 ankles.

 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a crowbar, a sieve, a loose brick, a length of rope, a
 strapless pair of goggles, an antique bottle, a cork, a white rubber
 strap, and a shrimp here.

>take crowbar and rope
 The crowbar:  You've already got your hands full.
 The length of rope:  You've already got your hands full.

>inventory
 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 scuba mask (being worn), a treasure map, a broken stave, and a clam
 shell.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.

 The clam shell can't be attached to the broken stave.

>tie stave to crowbar
 The broken stave can't be attached to the crowbar.

 The sieve can't be attached to the broken stave.

 You need to be holding the length of rope before you can attach it to
 anything.

>examine shingle
 I don't see any shingle here.

>examine askjhsd
 I don't know the word "askjhsd".

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
 wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>stand on bench
 The benches are too far away.

>climb enclosure
 You look longingly up at the red brick wall, but the roof of the
 enclosure is clearly out of reach.

>go north
 Among the Benches
 This patch of the broad pavilion floor seems to be set aside for
 spectators, as there are numerous wooden benches here.  They're neatly
 arranged in two orderly rows.  What with all these benches, you half
 expect to see picnic tables, but there are none.  The main part of the
 pavilion floor sprawls largely to the south.  Beyond that, against the
 southern railing, you can see the brick faced enclosure and the tiny
 snack bar.

 An early evening breeze fills your nose with the tangy scent of brine.

>stand on bench
 You choose a stable looking bench and clamber on to it.

>climb onto roof
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>go up
 You can't get any higher.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

>go down
 The bench scrapes against the concrete floor as you leave it.

>push benches s
 I don't understand that sentence.

>move benches
 You push the benches around into an untidy mess.

>push bench s
 I don't understand that sentence.

>take bench
 Choosing a bench at random, you grab hold of one end and raise it
 about a foot in the air.  The other end scrapes loudly against the
 concrete floor.  The bench is light enough to move around, but too
 bulky to carry, so you set it back down.

>push bench south
 You choose a bench at random, lift one end, and drag it noisily across
 the concrete floor.  You set it down by the brick restroom enclosure
 and go back for another.  Slowly, laboriously, you drag each bench in
 turn to the enclosure.  A bead of sweat trickles down your brow.
 Finally, your task is complete.  Out of a twisted sense of order, you
 set them up as you originally found them, in two neat rows.  Whew!
 You would hate to have to do all that again.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the

>stand on bench
 You choose a stable looking bench and clamber on to it.

>get on enclosure
 You decide that you should probably get off of the benches first.

>stack benches
 I don't see how you're going to do that while you're standing on one
 of them.

>go down
 The bench scrapes against the concrete floor as you leave it.

>stack benches
 You pile the benches up against the brick wall of the restroom
 enclosure, one on top of another, into a tower twice your height.
 They don't look very sturdy, but the wall does seem to add some
 support.

 You'd better do something with the stuff you're carrying first.
 You'll need both hands free to climb.

 at you and giggle.

>drop all
 The treasure map:  You toss the treasure map to the ground.
 The broken stave:  You toss the broken stave to the ground.
 The clam shell:  You toss the clam shell to the ground.

>climb benches
 You nudge one of the benches in the tower to test for stability.  The
 tower shivers, but remains firm.  It seems to be shored up by the wall
 of the enclosure.  Carefully, slowly, you climb to the top.

 On the Enclosure
 You're standing on the enclosure that houses the restrooms.  The
 cement floor spreads all around you to the north, and the snack bar
 lies just below you to the east.  If it weren't for the pavilion's
 canopy, you might have a nice view of the sunset.  Unfortunately, all
 you can see is the canopy's shadowy underside.

>examine canopy
 The enormous canopy hangs directly overhead.  From down here, you can
 see into the darkened rafters, and detect the pattern of wooden slats
 that make up the underside of the canopy.  In fact, now that your eyes
 have adjusted to the relatively dim light, you can see a thin seam of
 light outlining a rectangular shape in the canopy.

>examine shape
 The thin seam of light appears to outline a maintenance hatch hidden
 in the canopy above you.

>open hatch
 You scramble up into the rafters, grab hold of a nearby beam, and lean
 out over empty space.  You can just about reach the maintenance hatch.
 Unfortunately it's quite heavy, and at this angle you have no leverage
 with which to open it. Disappointed, you jump back down to the
 enclosure roof.  If only you had a long pole to push it back with.

>go down
 You test the top bench yet again.  It's still not as sturdy as you'd
 like it to be, but it'll have to do.  You set to climbing down the
 stack of benches.

 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.
    You see a treasure map, a broken stave, and a clam shell here.

>take stave
 Taken.

 A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
 horizon.

>throw stave onto enclosure
 You toss the broken stave.  It bounces off the enclosure and falls to
 the ground.

 An elderly couple strolls past you, hand in hand, clearly enjoying the
 sunset.

>take stave
 Taken.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

 You choose a bench at random and set the broken stave on it.  (If you
 meant to set the broken stave on top of the stack, you can't do it
 without actually climbing it.)

>open hatch with stave
 You extend the wooden stave and give the maintenance hatch a good,
 stiff jab.  It rises up, swings on its hinges, and slams down on the
 roof.  A shower of sand and a broad angular shaft of orange light fall
 into your eyes.

>go up
 You scramble up into the rafters, grab hold of a nearby beam, and lean
 out over empty space.  You can just reach the opening in the pavilion.
 Your grip is tenuous, but you manage to pull yourself up and heave
 yourself through the trap door.

 As you climb to your feet, a loose shingle rocks beneath your knee and
 nearly sends you falling back through the hatch.

 On the Canopy
 The view from the shingled canopy is quite lovely.  A deeply orange
 sun is setting beyond your hotel, while the beach stretches like a
 golden ribbon to north and south.  To the east, the long pier
 stretches out towards the sprawling blue sea.  Perhaps it's your
 imagination, but the sunset seems curiously enhanced from up here -
 more so than can be accounted for by the height of the canopy.
    The maintenance hatch through which you climbed lies open against
 the canopy.

>examine sunset
 As you gaze into the distant sky, you feel an incredible sensation, as
 if your body were a balloon in the process of being inflated.  You
 rise, the canopy dropping away behind you.  Your mind and vision
 expand as you ascend high into the atmosphere, above even the towering
 hotels.  The world contracts beneath you.  It's as if you've become
 some huge bubble, and your entire surface acts like a lens,
 magnifying, intensifying.  Everything seems almost surreally
 beautiful.  The sun wavers a hair's breadth above the horizon like a
 fat, ripe, blood orange.  Its rays speed diagonally towards you
 through streamers of cloud turned to pink cotton candy.  The sweeping
 rays hazily rake the fertile wetlands that lie beyond the shore.
 Broad swathes of grassy emerald are bordered by wheat colored marshes.
 Green and gold are divided by snake-like ribbons of shadow and light,
 where twisting streams alternately capture and reflect the light.  The
 rays fade lazily to the east, smudging the sky with shades of peach
 and rose and lilac and cool, steely blue.  A pale moon hangs like a
 plump sand dollar in the milky blue eastern sky.  And beyond, the
 stars...

 Suddenly, the vision recedes as quickly as it came upon you, sending
 you plummeting like a falling star to the earth's welcoming grace.
 You find yourself in yourself again, standing on the wood shingled
 canopy in the cool air of the early evening light.

 You stand and consider the experience for a while.  You'd nearly
 forgotten how to appreciate the beauty of everyday life.  It's enough
 to get you to thinking about your job again, and how it consumes so
 much time that you can't even enjoy common miracles such as this.

 You're wavering.  "Maybe I'm being hasty," is what you're now
 thinking.  Sure, a couple of fancy displays now and then make life
 more interesting, but is that enough reason to quit your job?  And
 what about your employers?  What'll they do without you?  You're still
 going to need a few more convincing arguments.

 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.
    You see a clam shell, a treasure map, and a shingle here.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the
 setting sun streaks through them at just the right angle.

>take map, shingle
 The treasure map:  Taken.
 The shingle:  Taken.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>go south
 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.  The vendor has gone
 home for the night.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.

>jump over railing
 You climb over the railing and maneuver yourself so that you're
 standing on your heels facing out with your toes hanging out over
 empty space.  You steel yourself, take a deep breath, and...  jump!
 The ground rushes up faster than you could have imagined.  It seems
 you've only just jumped when wham!  Your feet hit the ground with a
 stinging impact that sends you sprawling forwards into the sand.  You
 lie, stunned, for several moments.  After a time the stinging fades
 from your feet, if not from your memory, and you climb back to a
 vertical position.  You seem to have lost several of your posessions
 in the fall.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.
    You see a treasure map and a shingle, lying in the sand.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 Two gulls break off from the main flock to fight over a choice morsel.
 A third flies over to investigate, and soon all three fly squawking
 away over the beach.

>take all
 The treasure map:  Taken.
 The shingle:  Taken.

 Two strutting male gulls face off, puffing out their breast feathers
 and bobbing their heads in each other's direction.  A noise
 suspiciously like laughter emanates from several female gulls, and the
 two males hurriedly stand down.

>go east
 The warm dry sand gives way to cool wet sand as you move closer to the
 shoreline.

 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier
 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into
 the larger castle.

>go north
 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    A great crystalline castle dominates the area, rising nearly to the
 underside of the pier.

>go west
 Under Pavilion
 You're in a low space beneath the pavilion, which is supported by
 massive cement pylons.  Two metal pipes extrude from the cement above
 you and bend east to follow the pier.  The beach lies east through an
 opening in the dunes, and an open wire mesh gate leads to a small
 storage area to the west.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is
 still visible.
    You see an aluminum recycling canister here.

>read map
 The black strokes describe the chain of islands dominating the
 Savannah coast.  One island in particular bears a bold red X.  You
 examine the marker closer.  It's right underfoot!

>dig with shingle
 Sand continues to slide in from the hole's rim, but you're able to
 keep abreast of it through vigorous use of the shingle.  You keep on
 digging, making the hole deeper and wider.  You climb into the hole to
 facilitate the excavation, and soon you're knee deep in it.

>again
 You continue digging industriously.  You're forced to stop for a
 moment to wipe the sweat from your brow, but you shortly resume your
 labor.  When you next look up, you discover that you're waist deep in
 the hole.

>again
 Your back aches from stooping and lifting, and you're covered with
 sweat, but you keep on digging.  That treasure must be here somewhere,
 you're just sure of it!  Though if you don't find something soon, you
 may be out of luck.  You're standing in the hole up to your chest, and
 the sand sliding in from the rim is starting to make you nervous.

>again
 You pause for a moment to contemplate the fruits of your labors.  The
 hole rises nearly over your head.  You shudder with a quick chill as
 the early evening breeze strokes your sweat coated skin.  Or perhaps
 it's the sight of all the sand spilling down the rim of the hole.
 Then, with a dedication born of pure greed, you set the shingle to the
 bottom of the hole and continue digging.  Hardly a moment has passed
 when, chunk, you strike something!  You bend down to see what you've
 found, and...

 ...  fall into black.

 You come awake groggily, with pounding head.  You seem to be lying on
 your side in the cold and damp.  You try to sit up, but your arms are
 somehow pinned behind you.  In fact, it feels like they're tied down.
 You can even feel a coarse rope tied roughly around you.  Your eyes
 are gummed shut, but you force them open and take in your surroundings
 with blurred vision.

 You can't even begin to imagine how, but you've come to be lying in
 some sort of underground grotto.  The walls and ceiling are of rough
 stone, and water drips from the ceiling and puddles around you on the
 stony floor.  A cool breeze on your back suggests that the cavern
 extends to some distance behind you.  Nearby, a thin, sandy shore
 descends towards a sheltered inlet.  The inlet follows the cove as it
 bends out of sight towards the sea, while pink tongues of sunset reach
 back around the bend to lick the dark walls of the cave.

>untie rope
 You rock back and forth on the stony ground, struggling to break free
 of the rope that binds you.  The motion sets your head to throbbing
 and the coarse rope tears into your flesh, but you're unable to free
 yourself.

>inventory
 It's hard to tell with your hands tied behind you, but you don't seem
 to be carrying anything.

 The gentle surf laps against the thin shore.

 You can hear new sounds coming from around the bend.  The protesting
 creak of old wood is accompanied by soft, irregular splashes, and
 punctuated by the base tones of a grumbled conversation.

>examine me
 Ugh.  Your whole body throbs painfully with the blood pulsing dully
 through your veins.

 The gentle surf laps against the thin shore.

>go east
 The back of your head throbs, and coarse rope binds your arms.  You
 can't sit up or even focus your eyes well enough to do that.

 A drop of water falls from the stony ceiling and lands with a plip on
 the puddled ground.

 A boat rows into sight from around the bend.  It's a small, wooden
 dinghy, rowed by two scruffy looking individuals.  With your vision
 blurred, you can't tell much more about them from here.  You can hear
 small snippets of their grumbled conversation, but not enough to make
 sense of it.

>listen
 The two men's coarse voices carry over the placid waters of the inlet.

 The wooden dinghy scrapes up onto the thin shore, and the two men
 slowly clamber out.  Though they're quite close, their conversation is
 still garbled.  Their voices are deep and slurred, with a grating
 timbre that sends a chill crawling across your aching scalp.  They
 seem to be discussing the previous night's debaucheries.
    The heavier of the pair rubs a meaty hand through his matted hair
 and says, "Gar, oy still don't see why oy have to come collect t' new
 recruit.  T'ain't enough I been t' cudgel man?"
    "Oh, shut yer stinkin' hole, McGintie.  I be just as smashed as
 you.  Cab'in says do, ye do.  Unless ye want yer throat cut here to
 ear."  The second speaker draws one hand across his throat in a quick
 slashing motion.

>untie rope
 You rock back and forth on the stony ground, struggling to break free
 of the rope that binds you.  The motion sets your head to throbbing
 and the coarse rope tears into your flesh, but you're unable to free
 yourself.

 The gentle surf laps against the thin shore.

 The foul reek of boozy breath chokes you as the pair scuffle your way.
 They're close enough now that you can make them out in better detail.
 It's ludicrous, but they seem to be dressed as...  pirates.  Though
 groggy and filled with fear, you're struck by the sheer lunacy of the
 situation.  It nevertheless seems frighteningly real when the pair
 come to stand over you and look down with vile, appraising eyes.
    "Gar, it's awake, it is.  Feisty one, this," says the heavier man.
    The slender man nods agreement.  "Aye, and let's get it back quick,
 'fore my noggin explodes."

>ask pirates about treasure
 The heavier of the two men bends ponderously at the knees and looks
 into your face with a crooked grin.  "Gar, ain't you t' lucky one.
 We're takin' you on a free 'round 't world trip!  Har, har!"  His
 belly shakes with laughter at his wry pronouncement.

 A drop of water falls from the stony ceiling and lands with a plip on
 the puddled ground.

 The second speaker grabs you by the hair and starts dragging you over
 the rough ground towards the dinghy.  The cloud of alcoholic fumes
 surrounding the brigands brings a gorge to your throat.  You sputter
 and choke and fight to breathe, but the rope still binds your arms
 tightly behind you, restricting the passage of air to your lungs.
 Just when you've decided you must vomit or die, your abductors heave
 you up, over the lip of the dinghy, and in.  You fall...

 ...  and wake, back on the beach, coughing up sand as someone pounds
 forcefully on your back.  After a moment, your fit subsides and your
 throat seems to be clear, though your mouth is still full of grit.
    The pounding stops, and a kindly male voice speaks.  "You alright?
 Can you breathe?"

 You look around to find the elderly couple you've seen strolling the
 beach, looking down at you concernedly.
    "We heard you shout," says the woman.  Seeing the look of confusion
 on your face, she says "When the sand fell in on you."
    "We pulled you out," says the man.  "What were you doing, digging
 so deeply, anyway?"
    "Oh, it doesn't matter," says she.  "What's important is that
 you're all right."  She looks into your eyes for any sign of lasting
 damage.  "You are all right, my dear?"
    You nod your head, yes.  "Thank you."  The words burn in your
 throat, but your breath is returning to normal.
    "Would you like us to help you home, or call anyone for you?"
    You shake your head in the negative.  "Thanks, I'll be fine."
    "Well, all right, dear.  But do try to be more careful!"  And with
 that, the elderly couple strolls away to the east, throwing an
 occasional concerned glance back your way.

 Thank goodness, all the pain and grogginess you felt lying in the
 grotto has disappeared as if it never was.  Nevertheless, all the
 digging and the subsequent near burial has left you winded.  You rest
 for a moment, taking stock of...  what?  Was it a vision?  Past life
 experience?  Suddenly, the word 'shanghaied' pops into your head.
 You're reminded of your visit to Savannah's famed Pirate House.
 According to city history, honest-to-goodness pirates frequented the
 place in the buccaneering days of Savannah's past, largely for
 convenient access to the caves beneath the tavern.  These underground
 caverns connected the Pirate House to nearby River Street.  The
 brigands frequently took advantage of these caverns in order to
 discreetly carry drunken 'new recruits' out to their ships.  The
 hapless abductees would later wake to find themselves miles from
 shore, with no recourse but to join the ship's crew.

 Of course, that still doesn't begin to explain your strange
 experience.  It's reminded you that the true "treasures" are life and
 freedom.  But suddenly, you recall frighteningly similar nightmares
 where you were locked into eternal servitude by your slavish job.  The
 realization jolts you back to your ongoing internal debate.

 You're feeling hesitant.  "Well now, wait a minute," is what you're
 now thinking.  What's life about if not living?  And much as you hate
 to admit it, your employers can probably replace you easily.  You're
 still not quite decided, but it would only take several more arguments
 to set your mind.

    You see an aluminum recycling canister, a scuba mask, a treasure
 map, a shingle, a crowbar, and a white rubber strap here.
    The white rubber strap dangles limply from the crowbar.

>drop map, shingle
 Great dunes of sand, piled up against the pillars supporting the
 pavilion, block your exit in that direction.

 Storage Area
 You're in a small, cement walled room.  But for the open gate in the
 east face, it would be one big cement cube.  Against the rear wall is
 a large bin full of used paper products.  Next to that is a plain
 looking utility table over which is hung a peg board.
    You see a steel key here.

 The treasure map:  You toss the treasure map to the ground.
 The shingle:  You toss the shingle to the ground.

>go east
 Under Pavilion
 You're in a low space beneath the pavilion, which is supported by
 massive cement pylons.  Two metal pipes extrude from the cement above
 you and bend east to follow the pier.  The beach lies east through an
 opening in the dunes, and an open wire mesh gate leads to a small
 storage area to the west.
    You see an aluminum recycling canister here.

 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting

 the north or south.
    A great crystalline castle dominates the area, rising nearly to the
 underside of the pier.

 A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes
 before gently receding.

>go north
 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass
 through the pylons supporting the long pier that stretches east from
 the pavilion.
    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be
 some sort of reptile.
    You see a mussel shell, a crab shell, and a snail shell, lying in
 the sand.

>go west
 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

>go southwest
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a sieve, a loose brick, a length of rope, a strapless pair
 of goggles, an antique bottle, a cork, a shrimp, and a broken stave
 here.

>inventory
 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 scuba mask, a crowbar, and a white rubber strap.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.
    The white rubber strap dangles limply from the crowbar.

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.
    You see a clam shell here.

 A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby
 railing, and then launches itself back into the air.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man stares grimly at the sun, as if daring it to sink any
 lower.

>ask man about man
 His steely grey eyes hardly flicker.  "I am what I am, youngster."

 The old man doggedly reels in a few lengths of line.

>ask man about sun
 The old man's eyes never stray from the sea.  "Aye, 'tis a beaut."

 The old man pulls back on his rod with all his might, struggling to
 reel in whatever he's hooked.  Incredibly, an enormous marlin breaks
 the surface!  But victory is short lived.  The line snaps and the old
 man staggers nearly off his feet.

>examine sack
 It's a heavy, brown, burlap sack.

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

>look in sack
 It seems to be empty.

 The old man reels in a whopper of a fish, which he tosses into the
 bucket by his feet.

>ask man about sack
 Apparently the old man isn't interested in talking about that.

 The old man pulls back on his rod with all his might, struggling to
 reel in whatever he's hooked.  Incredibly, an enormous marlin breaks

>examine bucket
 It's an ordinary, if somewhat corroded, metal pail, full of fish
 caught by the old man.

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

>search fish
 The old man spots you reaching for his fish and fires off a
 smouldering glower that burns straight through the center of your
 forehead.

 The old man reels in a tiny fish, grunts in disgust, and tosses it
 back.

>ask man about fish
 He glances down at the fish in the pail.  "That's today's catch.
 'Relda'll cook 'em up nice."

 The old man pulls back hard on his rod, pulling the line taut.

>ask man about fishing
 He beams uncharacteristically.  "'Relda and the kids picked it out for
 my birthday."

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

>ask man about relda
 He gazes wryly out to sea.  "My one true lady love.  After the sea,
 that is.  Couldn't live without either of 'em."

 The old man doggedly reels in a few lengths of line.

>ask man about sea
 You don't know of any such thing.

 The old man draws a cigarette from his breast pocket, rolls it
 meditatively between thumb and forefingers, and then puts it away.

>ask man about island
 The old man just grips his rod more tightly.

 The old man doggedly reels in a few lengths of line.

>ask man about crab
 The old man just grips his rod more tightly.

 A small child bobbles into the area and tries to sneak up behind the
 old man, only to break out laughing.  The old man jerks in surprise
 and throws the child a long, harsh glare.

>ask man about his rod
 I don't know the word "his".

>ask man about rod
 He beams uncharacteristically.  "'Relda and the kids picked it out for

 The old man consults his bait box, and reties his line with a new
 lure.

>ask man about marlin

 You tie the other end of the white rubber strap to the shrimp, joining
 the crowbar to the shrimp.

>se
 You skip along the wooden boardwalk to the beach, evoking a strong
 memory of the carefree summer days of your childhood.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 A snowy white gull apparently materializes right in the middle of the
 flock, cranes its neck as if searching for someone, and then
 dematerializes.

>go east
 The warm dry sand gives way to cool wet sand as you move closer to the
 shoreline.

 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier
 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into
 the larger castle.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles
 away, quickly disappearing into another, equally invisible hole.

>go east
 The surf glides up to meet you as you approach the water, a cool shock
 against your warm skin.

 Shallow Water, South of Pier
 You're up to your knees in the gently surging tide.  It flows up onto
 the beach to the west and grows deeper to the east.  To the north, you
 can pass among the pylons supporting the pier.

>go east
 You'd better do something with one of the items you're carrying first.
 You'll need at least one hand free to swim.

>inventory
 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a

    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your

    The crowbar is joined to the shrimp by the white rubber strap.

>wear mask
 You pull back the tough strap and slide the mask over your head.  It
 fits snugly, creating a tight seal.

 A rather large wave surges past, wetting you up to the waist and
 nearly toppling you from your feet.

>go east
 You launch yourself towards deeper water, skimming along for a few
 yards before coming to a stop.

 The shrimp shows renewed life as it makes contact with the salt water.

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)
 There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters
 beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to
 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The gradually sloping ocean floor is only about ten feet below the
 surface here.  The sandy bottom is layered with a suspension of mud
 and fine silt.  Here and there, thin leaved plants claw through the
 mud like grasping fingers.  Dominating the entire area is an enormous
 slab of barnacle encrusted rock.

 The crab, which had resumed its perch on top of the rock, scuttles
 back into the fissure on your approach.

 A few small bubbles escape your lips, glittering in the light as they
 rise towards the surface.

 The crab extends its eye stalks and peers tentatively from the
 fissure, as if sensing the shrimp's presence.  Unfortunately, it soon
 spots you and retreats back into its hole.

>give shrimp to crab
 "Hmm..."  you think to yourself, "...maybe I can lure the crab out
 with a tasty treat."  You give yourself a little pat on the back for
 your cleverness.

 You lower the shrimp toward the fissure, but a nagging voice in the
 back of your mind suggests that you might never see the white rubber
 strap or the crowbar again.

 The crab extends its eye stalks and peers tentatively from the
 fissure, as if sensing the shrimp's presence.  Unfortunately, it soon

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

 Lungs burning, you kick and claw your way toward the glittering
 sunlight above you.  Gasping, you break the surface and fill your
 lungs with the salty ocean air.

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)

 You kick back towards shore, skimming along for a few yards before
 coming to rest in shallower water.

 Shallow Water, South of Pier
 You're up to your knees in the gently surging tide.  It flows up onto
 the beach to the west and grows deeper to the east.  To the north, you
 can pass among the pylons supporting the pier.

>untie shrimp
 You detach the white rubber strap from the shrimp, separating it from
 the crowbar.

>drop crowbar
 You let go of the white rubber strap and the crowbar.  The strap sinks
 beneath the surface and disappears into the murky water along with the
 crowbar.

>go down
 You plop down into the shallow water and let the gentle waves knock
 against your shoulders.  The shrimp shows renewed life as it makes
 contact with the salt water.

 A gentle wave rides up the slope of your back as you sit in the
 shallow water.

>go west
 (Getting off of the ground first.)

 You splash merrily out of the shallow water, on to the hard packed
 sand.

 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier
 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into
 the larger castle.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles
 away, quickly disappearing into another, equally invisible hole.

>drop crowbar
 You toss the crowbar and the white rubber strap to the ground.

>go east
 The surf glides up to meet you as you approach the water, a cool shock
 against your warm skin.

>go east
 You launch yourself towards deeper water, skimming along for a few
 yards before coming to a stop.

 The shrimp shows renewed life as it makes contact with the salt water.

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)
 There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters
 beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to
 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The gradually sloping ocean floor is only about ten feet below the
 surface here.  The sandy bottom is layered with a suspension of mud
 and fine silt.  Here and there, thin leaved plants claw through the
 mud like grasping fingers.  Dominating the entire area is an enormous
 slab of barnacle encrusted rock.

 The crab, which had resumed its perch on top of the rock, scuttles
 back into the fissure on your approach.

 The crab extends its eye stalks and peers tentatively from the
 fissure, as if sensing the shrimp's presence.  Unfortunately, it soon
 spots you and retreats back into its hole.

>give shrimp to crab
 You release the shrimp.  Free of your grip, it darts immediately
 toward the dark fissure in the rock.  With surprising speed, the crab
 comes to life and goes after it.  The chase is brief, and shortly the
 crab retreats to the depths of the fissure, shrimp in claw.  Hmm.  If

>take shell
 You thrust your hand boldly into the fissure and probe the darkness,
 trying to grab the conch shell.  Ouch!  Something bit you!  Or maybe
 pinched you.  Either way, you jerk your hand free and examine it.
 Fortunately, whatever it was didn't break the skin.  It occurs to you
 to find some way to lure the crab out.

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

>go up
 Lungs burning, you kick and claw your way toward the glittering
 sunlight above you.  Gasping, you break the surface and fill your
 lungs with the salty ocean air.

    The white rubber strap dangles limply from the crowbar.

 You take the white rubber strap and the crowbar.

>go west
 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 A snowy white gull apparently materializes right in the middle of the
 flock, cranes its neck as if searching for someone, and then
 dematerializes.

>go west
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a sieve, a loose brick, a length of rope, a strapless pair
 of goggles, an antique bottle, a cork, and a broken stave here.

>drop crowbar
 You toss the crowbar and the white rubber strap to the ground.

>take rope
 Taken.

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.
    You see a clam shell here.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.
    You see a shrimp here.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man stares grimly at the sun, as if daring it to sink any
 lower.

>take shrimp
 Taken.

 The old man plays out a few lengths of line.

>tie rope to shrimp
 You try, but the coarse rope is too thick to be knotted around the
 shrimp.

 The old man's mind must have been wandering.  He jerks suddenly back
 to attention, evidently the result of a tug on his line.

>examine line
 It looks like 40lb test.

 The old man pulls back hard on his rod, pulling the line taut.

>ask man about line
 He shrugs his cast iron shoulders.  "Not much to say about it,
 youngster."

 The old man reels in a whopper of a fish, which he tosses into the
 bucket by his feet.

>ask man for line
 He twangs the active line to check for tautness.  "Sorry youngster,
 can't spare any line today."

 The old man pulls a flask from his pocket and takes a hearty swig.

>take money
 You'd better just leave it in your pocket.

 The old man consults his bait box, and reties his line with a new
 lure.

>ask man about flask
 I don't know the word "flask".

>buy line from man

 and then begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Two gulls break off from the main flock to fight over a choice morsel.
 A third flies over to investigate, and soon all three fly squawking
 away over the beach.

 The warm dry sand gives way to cool wet sand as you move closer to the
 shoreline.

 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that

 You launch yourself towards deeper water, skimming along for a few
 yards before coming to a stop.

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)
 There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters
 beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to
 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

 Something unseen brushes by your waist.

 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 scuba mask (being worn), and a length of rope.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.

>go north
 You launch yourself north with a heart pumping butterfly stroke.

 Deep Water, Beneath Pier, (treading water)
 The long pier finally comes to an end, the last of its supporting
 pylons disappearing into the murky depths below.  To the east lies
 nothing but endless ocean.  The welcoming sands of the beach lie back
 to the west.  Or you can strike off north or south, parallel to the
 shoreline.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The sandy ocean floor lies about ten feet below the surface, layered
 with silt and dotted with climbing green fingers of sea grass.  The
 angled cement pillars that support the pier end here.  Just beyond the
 final pair of pillars is a sudden drop off, a steep slope that leads
 down and down, far beyond your limited visibility.

>go down
 With a strong kick, you propel yourself towards the depths beyond the
 slope.  Visibility dims slightly as you move away from the warming
 light of the sun, and the pillars fall away behind you.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope continues its sharp descent, inclining almost vertically.
 Though the level of ambient light has diminished, the sun still shines
 down strongly, fluttering on the surface above you.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

>go down
 You continue your drop down the face of the slope.  The temperature
 drops severely as you pass through a thermocline, and the mounting
 pressure makes your ears ache.  You pinch your nose shut with thumb
 and forefinger, and exhale gently to clear the pressure.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope just keeps on descending.  The amount of sunlight that
 reaches you has diminished quite a bit and the water has become quite
 cold.  Below you all is dark, but for a small glint of light hinting
 through the darkness.
    A busted lobster trap lies half buried in the mud of the steep
 slope.

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

>tie rope to trap
 You try to tie the length of rope to the busted trap, but find it
 difficult to summon enough coordination while bobbing in the currents.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first
 feelings of panic and setting your heart racing.

>pull trap
 Pulling the busted trap doesn't have any effect.

 A large red fish darts by, just barely out of reach.

 Your lungs are on fire and blue blood pounds in your veins, setting
 off waves of panic.  You can control yourself no longer!  Instinct
 takes over and sends you kicking and clawing your way to the surface.
 You rise and rise and can't climb fast enough and finally, just when
 you don't think you're going to make it, you break the surface.  You
 sputter and gasp, inhaling deeply of the fresh salty air.  After a few
 moments, the fire in your lungs subsides and calm is restored to your
 pounding veins.

 It's a rough box made of wooden slats and chicken wire.  There's a
 gaping hole in one face, where something has punched through the wire

 Shallow Water, Beneath Pier
 The knee-deep water here is cooled by the shadow of the pier, which
 here rises to almost three times your height.  A pair of metal pipes
 run the length of it, presumably a part of the pavilion's plumbing.
 The avenue of supporting pylons leads west, on to the sand, and also
 continued into deeper water to the east.  You can escape the pier's
 chilly shadow to the north or south.

>go southwest
 You splash merrily out of the shallow water, on to the hard packed
 sand.

 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet

    The white rubber strap dangles limply from the crowbar.

>drop rope

>take brick
 You rock the brick back and forth and manage to get your fingers under
 it.  Oof!  It's heavy!  It takes both hands to carry it, and the
 muscles in your lower back protest as you straighten up.  You'd better
 decide where you want to go now, because you won't be able to carry it
 for too long.

>go east
 Brick in hands, you stagger up the concrete ramp.  It's a good thing
 the ramp was there, as you doubt you could have carried the brick up
 all those stairs.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.
    You see a clam shell here.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

 Your arms and shoulders feel a bit sore from carrying the weight of
 the brick.

>go east
 You stagger out of the shady pavilion and onto the long pier.  The
 weight of the brick makes the lengthy pier look even longer than
 usual.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point

 slack.

 You stagger into the shade of the small shelter, brick still in hands.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 Your hands are starting to cramp from clutching the brick, and your
 lower back is in agony, forcing you to bend over almost double.

 The old man consults his bait box, and reties his line with a new
 lure.

>jump
 Not while you're carrying that brick.

 Finally, you can carry the brick no more.  It bangs to the ground with
 a loud, scraping thud that you feel in the soles of your feet, and
 narrowly misses your toes.  Relieved of the brick's weight, you
 quickly straighten up.  All your aching body parts cry out in relief.
 You flex your hands to loosen them up, then plant them at your sides
 and bend backwards until you feel your spine crack.  Ahh!

 The old man doggedly reels in a few lengths of line.

>take brick
 You rock the brick back and forth and manage to get your fingers under
 it.  Oof!  It's heavy!  It takes both hands to carry it, and the

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

>dive
 You try to dig a hole to China, but don't get very far.

 Your arms and shoulders feel a bit sore from carrying the weight of
 the brick.

 A small child bobbles into the area and tries to sneak up behind the
 old man, only to break out laughing.  The old man jerks in surprise
 and throws the child a long, harsh glare.

>go down
 If you want to jump off the pier, you should say so.  Otherwise, there
 is no way down.

 You let the brick hang lower, and it relieves the soreness in your
 arms a bit, but your lower back strains as it's forced to pick up the
 slack.

 The old man pulls a flask from his pocket and takes a hearty swig.

>jump off pier
 The old man watches with flinty eyes as you set the brick on the
 railing and then climb over, coming to rest on the outside of the
 railing with your heels hanging over open air.  Suddenly, you realize
 you won't be able to turn around while carrying the brick.  You
 swallow and resign yourself to going off backwards.  A trembling spasm
 flits through your calves as you raise the brick. You count three,
 take a deep breath, and...  jump!  You fall fast and hit the water,
 hard, with your face, throwing spray everywhere.  The weight of the
 brick drags you down fast, faster.  You fall down and down alongside
 an enormous dropping slope, and the water turns cold around you while
 the pressure pierces your ears with shards of glass.  You throw back
 your head and howl in pain, losing most of your air in a glittering
 swarm of bubbles, and still you fall into darkness.  But below you is
 a speck of light, and even as you fall from the sunlight, this new
 light gives you hope.  It grows as the sun diminishes, and though it
 gives off no warmth, it cheers you slightly.  The barbed pain in your
 ears subsides.  You fall further and further, and finally, you hit
 bottom with a dull thud that raises a cloud of mud.  When the mud
 clears you find you've somehow lost track of the brick.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 You're at the bottom of a long, precipitous slope.  The cold and
 pressure are intense.  Judging by the dim light, you must be many
 fathoms below the surface. It's astonishing that you made it this deep
 without any diving equipment.  An enticing beam of light in these
 frigid, sub-arctic depths has resolved into...  the huge staring eye
 of an enormous octopus!

 Your lungs are almost empty of air after your long descent.  You can
 already feel burning tendrils of pain spreading through your chest.

 I don't know the word "pinch".

>examine octopus
 You examine the 'octopus' more closely.  You can see now that it's
 nothing more than a rusty old diving bell.  But it really does look
 like an enormous octopus stretching up from the ocean floor.  Its
 rusting, barnacle encrusted head is supported by four thin, stilted
 tentacles which disappear into the swirling sands.  Completing the
 illusion are a pair of plate sized eyes, which stare at you with
 shining intensity while producing the light that lured you so deep.

 A few small bubbles escape your lips, glittering in the light as they
 rise towards the surface.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first
 feelings of panic and setting your heart racing.

>enter bell
 You swim between the four thin legs and rise up into a hollow, air
 filled chamber.

 Inside the 'Octopus'
 As you suspected, the 'octopus' is in fact a rusted old diving bell.
 Suspended from the ceiling of the bell is a useless hunk of flaking
 metal that must once have been an air valve.  By some miracle of good
 fortune, the chamber is still full of air.  Several thick round
 portholes look out on the frigid depths.  A surprising amount of light
 passes through them from the outside.

 The bell reverberates with peculiar undersea noises.

>look through porthole
 You glance out the porthole expecting to see little more than muck and
 murk.  Instead, you're confronted with a breathtaking vision.  The
 stygian depths have parted to permit a single powerful beam of
 sunlight, which illuminates a scene of startling beauty.  The ocean
 floor beyond the portholes is grown over with a coral reef that swarms
 with a kaleidoscopic variety of life.  Brain coral sprout like fungi,
 their convoluted folds home to tiny, salmon colored shrimp.  Larger
 crustaceans are visible here and there, hiding in shadow as they wait
 for their unwary prey.  Schools of fish swarm in great prismatic
 clouds, their pale bellies reflecting tiny bursts of light as they
 wheel and twirl.  Fluted ivory branches climb surface ward, reaching
 like grasping fingers for the silver fish that dart among them.  And
 presiding over all like the kings of yore are great purple sea fans,
 which wave majestically in the currents as if bestowing grace upon
 their radiant subjects.

 Discovering all this at such great depth and so far north is nothing
 short of miraculous.  You'd almost forgotten the pleasant thrill of
 finding beauty in unexpected places.  It starts you thinking about
 work again, in particular the way it dulls your interest in searching
 for wonder.

 You're feeling skittish.  "Could I really do this?"  is what you're
 asking yourself.  You've unconsciously begun tallying your savings.
 You've even got the beginnings of a resignation letter going in the
 back of your mind.  If only you had a couple more arguments to put
 your mind at rest.

 You notice that the mud beneath the coral seems oddly level.  In fact,
 one patch in particular doesn't look like mud at all.

>search patch
 The patch of level surface is too far away.

>examine patch
 You pier out through the scratched glass straining for more detail.
 Eyes squinting, tongue poking through teeth in concentration, you can
 just make out some sort of pattern hidden beneath the mud...

 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 You have no way to secure yourself, which makes moving the mud a

 but the pattern becomes slightly clearer.  You can just make out a

>go up
 Deep Water, Beneath Pier, (treading water)
 The long pier finally comes to an end, the last of its supporting
 pylons disappearing into the murky depths below.  To the east lies
 nothing but endless ocean.  The welcoming sands of the beach lie back
 to the west.  Or you can strike off north or south, parallel to the
 shoreline.

>examine bends
 I don't know the word "bends".

>go west
 You kick back towards shore, skimming along for a few yards before
 coming to rest in shallower water.

 Shallow Water, Beneath Pier
 The knee-deep water here is cooled by the shadow of the pier, which
 here rises to almost three times your height.  A pair of metal pipes
 run the length of it, presumably a part of the pavilion's plumbing.
 The avenue of supporting pylons leads west, on to the sand, and also
 continued into deeper water to the east.  You can escape the pier's
 chilly shadow to the north or south.

>go west
 You splash merrily out of the shallow water, on to the hard packed
 sand.

 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    A great crystalline castle dominates the area, rising nearly to the
 underside of the pier.

>go south
 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier
 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into
 the larger castle.

>go west
 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 From somewhere among the flock you hear a raucous cry that sounds
 suspiciously like "Big Water!"

>go west
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a sieve, a strapless pair of goggles, an antique bottle, a
 cork, a broken stave, a crowbar, a white rubber strap, a shrimp, and a
 length of rope here.
    The white rubber strap dangles limply from the crowbar.

 A slight gust of wind sends eddies of sand swirling over the brick
 path.

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.
    You see a clam shell here.

 A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby
 railing, and then launches itself back into the air.

>dance
 You set your feet to the dance hall floor and follow the steps you
 learned from the old, sunken diagram.  You begin with clumsy feet, but
 become more proficient as you rehearse.  As you dance around the
 pavilion, a strange thing happens.  Ghostly figures begin to join you
 - a small few at first, but growing in number.  You can see them
 becoming more substantial as they spin and whirl in their gossamer
 wing tips and slippers.  Petticoats twirl about you as the ladies
 wearing them prance and pirouette, lead by gentlemen in high collared,
 pin striped suits.  You glance around at the revelers surrounding you,
 only to notice that the pavilion has undergone a transformation of its
 own.  Where once everything was dull grey cement, you now find rough
 wooden planks painted with a variety of dance step diagrams.  The
 pavilion has also shrunken considerably. Colorful banners light up the
 otherwise gloomy rafters.  Your examination is interrupted when
 someone taps your shoulder.  You whirl to find a partner inviting you
 to join in the revelry.  Following your new partner's lead, you swing
 and sway to the spirited notes of a lively jazz band.  The music plays
 on for what seems like hours, but you never tire, even when the sun
 descends in the west.  As the sky grows dark, attendants set out paper
 lanterns which bring a fiery glow to the festivities.  You continue to
 dance through song after song, frequently trading partners until
 you're giddy and slicked with sweat.  Eventually, though, the ball
 begins to wind down.  The musicians belt out one final, powerful
 number.  Afterwards, they pack away their instruments.  The lights dim
 as the attendants blow out the paper lanterns one by one and the
 dancers slowly crowd toward the exit.  As they leave the pavilion, the
 ethereal dancers fade back into the past.  The musicians go too, soon
 followed by the attendants with their paper lanterns.

 In a few bare moments everyone is gone, and you notice that the
 pavilion has reverted back to grey cement.  Though hours seemed to
 have passed while you danced, the sun is still just where you recall
 seeing it prior to this latest vision.

 You feel like beating your chest in wild excitement.  Ahh!  What an
 incredible reminder of the joy of expression!  In fact, it gets you to
 thinking about work again, particularly the way it crushes all your
 creative output and turns it into predigested pap for unintelligent
 clients.

 You're feeling excited.  "Yes, I could really do this!"  you exclaim.
 You've got plenty of money in the bank.  And to heck with your
 employers!  What have they ever really done for you?  You're teetering
 right on the brink of decision.  If only you had one more argument to
 set your resolve.

 A young, auburn haired woman wearing nothing more than sneakers and an
 incredibly revealing thong bikini jogs past.  Jogging alongside her is
 a darkly-tanned, slim-hipped young man, similarly dressed.

>score
 Not exactly a score as such, but...

 -  The castle builders have revitalized your waning belief in a world
 full of wondrous novelty.
 -  Your sunset vision has reawakened your appreciation for the beauty
 of the mundane.
 -  Your strange kidnapping experience has rewarded you with the
 treasures of life and freedom.
 -  The coral reef has shown you that beauty may be found in unexpected
 places.
 -  The ghostly dancers have reminded you of the ineluctable joy of
 creative expression.

 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man reels in a tiny fish, grunts in disgust, and tosses it
 back.

>examine fountain
 It's a waist high silver cabinet with a metal basin on top, just like
 all the other fountains you've ever seen.

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

>look in basin
 There's nothing in the drinking fountain.

 The old man pulls back hard on his rod, pulling the line taut.

>turn on fountain
 You turn the handle, but nothing happens.  Perhaps the water main has
 been shut off for the night.

 A small child bobbles into the area and tries to sneak up behind the
 old man, only to break out laughing.  The old man jerks in surprise
 and throws the child a long, harsh glare.

>go west

 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.  The vendor has gone
 home for the night.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.

 Grains of sand on the concrete floor twinkle as the light of the
 setting sun streaks through them at just the right angle.

>examine boiler
 The metal appliance is an industrial sized boiler, which looks rather
 similar to a deep fryer.  Basically, it consists of a deep metal pan
 resting on a foundation of electric heating coils.  Handles on either
 side of the pan suggest that it can be detached from the base.  A thin
 metal bar girdles the lip of the tray, reinforcing the frame, and a
 hinged lid lies flat on top, anchored to the metal bar with a sturdy
 clamp which the vendor attached before leaving for the night.

>examine counter
 The snack bar carries the usual variety of foods and beverages, though
 none of these are in evidence.  Apparently, the vendor has locked up
 for the night.  Empty shelves line the wall behind the counter, and
 presumably there are more shelves beneath the counter.  A prominently
 placed sign advertises boiled peanuts, something you've come to think
 of as a particularly southern delicacy. Just behind the counter is a
 closed metal boiler, its metal lid held firmly in place by a strong
 metal clamp.

>look under counter
 The narrow space beneath the counter is deep in shadow.  You can't
 make out anything of interest, and it's unlikely that you could
 retrieve anything anyway.

 A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
 horizon.

>search counter
 You find nothing of interest.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>look behind counter
 The only thing of obvious interest is the industrial boiler.

 A young boy wearing a bright blue bathing suit and matching flip-flops
 runs by.

>open boiler
 You try to pull the clamp off with your bare hands, but it's anchored
 too securely.  There must be some trick to getting it off.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

>pry clamp with crowbar
 You put the other stuff you were carrying on the counter to free your
 hands.  Then you slide the metal bar beneath the clamp and apply
 pressure.  Getting no immediate results, you push harder on the bar.
 It bites into the soft flesh of your palms as you strain to force the
 clamp.  Suddenly, instead of the clamp giving way, the lid's hinges
 shear off with a violent wrenching sound.  Free of the lid's
 resistance, you go lunging forward and almost fall from your feet.
 The clamp pops off with a metallic twang and clatters to the floor
 where it disappears beneath the counter.  Simultaneously, the lid
 flies off and goes sailing away over the railing like a big, square,
 metallic frisbee.

 It appears to be empty.

 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 Two gulls break off from the main flock to fight over a choice morsel.
 A third flies over to investigate, and soon all three fly squawking
 away over the beach.

 extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier
 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into
 the larger castle.

 Under Pavilion
 You're in a low space beneath the pavilion, which is supported by
 massive cement pylons.  Two metal pipes extrude from the cement above

 storage area to the west.
    You see an aluminum recycling canister here.

 Storage Area
 You're in a small, cement walled room.  But for the open gate in the

 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The gradually sloping ocean floor is only about ten feet below the
 surface here.  The sandy bottom is layered with a suspension of mud
 and fine silt.  Here and there, thin leaved plants claw through the
 mud like grasping fingers.  Dominating the entire area is an enormous
 slab of barnacle encrusted rock.

 The crab, which had resumed its perch on top of the rock, scuttles
 back into the fissure on your approach.

 The crab extends its eye stalks and peers tentatively from the
 fissure, as if sensing the shrimp's presence.  Unfortunately, it soon
 spots you and retreats back into its hole.

 sputtering.

 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The sandy ocean floor lies about ten feet below the surface, layered
 with silt and dotted with climbing green fingers of sea grass.  The
 angled cement pillars that support the pier end here.  Just beyond the
 final pair of pillars is a sudden drop off, a steep slope that leads
 down and down, far beyond your limited visibility.

>go down
 With a strong kick, you propel yourself towards the depths beyond the
 slope.  Visibility dims slightly as you move away from the warming
 light of the sun, and the pillars fall away behind you.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope continues its sharp descent, inclining almost vertically.
 Though the level of ambient light has diminished, the sun still shines
 down strongly, fluttering on the surface above you.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

>go down
 You continue your drop down the face of the slope.  The temperature
 drops severely as you pass through a thermocline, and the mounting
 pressure makes your ears ache.  You pinch your nose shut with thumb
 and forefinger, and exhale gently to clear the pressure.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope just keeps on descending.  The amount of sunlight that
 reaches you has diminished quite a bit and the water has become quite
 cold.  Below you all is dark, but for a small glint of light hinting
 through the darkness.
    A busted lobster trap lies half buried in the mud of the steep
 slope.

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

 You realize the futility of trying to pry open the busted trap with
 the crowbar.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first
 feelings of panic and setting your heart racing.

>go up
 Lungs burning, you kick and claw your way toward the glittering
 sunlight above you.  You rise and rise and can't climb fast enough and

 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The sandy ocean floor lies about ten feet below the surface, layered
 with silt and dotted with climbing green fingers of sea grass.  The
 angled cement pillars that support the pier end here.  Just beyond the
 final pair of pillars is a sudden drop off, a steep slope that leads
 down and down, far beyond your limited visibility.

 A large red fish darts by, just barely out of reach.

>go south
 The dim light and pulsing waves both serve to confound your sense of
 direction. Nevertheless, you kick off in what you believe to be the
 right direction.

 Deep Water, Beneath Pier, (treading water)
 The long pier finally comes to an end, the last of its supporting
 pylons disappearing into the murky depths below.  To the east lies
 nothing but endless ocean.  The welcoming sands of the beach lie back
 to the west.  Or you can strike off north or south, parallel to the
 shoreline.

 A rather large wave surges over your head, leaving you momentarily
 sputtering.

>go south
 You glide to the south with a smooth breast stroke.

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)
 There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters
 beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to
 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

>go west
 You kick back towards shore, skimming along for a few yards before
 coming to rest in shallower water.

 Shallow Water, South of Pier
 You're up to your knees in the gently surging tide.  It flows up onto
 the beach to the west and grows deeper to the east.  To the north, you
 can pass among the pylons supporting the pier.

>go down
 You plop down into the shallow water and let the gentle waves knock
 against your shoulders.  The shrimp shows renewed life as it makes
 contact with the salt water.

 A gentle wave rides up the slope of your back as you sit in the

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The gradually sloping ocean floor is only about ten feet below the
 surface here.  The sandy bottom is layered with a suspension of mud
 and fine silt.  Here and there, thin leaved plants claw through the
 mud like grasping fingers.  Dominating the entire area is an enormous
 slab of barnacle encrusted rock.

 The crab, which had resumed its perch on top of the rock, scuttles
 back into the fissure on your approach.

 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that

 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into

>go west
 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 The gulls battle among themselves for dominance over the temporary
 food supply.

>go northwest
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a strapless pair of goggles, a cork, and a broken stave
 here.

>find rope
 I don't know the word "find".

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.
    You see a clam shell here.

>take shell
 Taken.

 A young boy wearing a bright blue bathing suit and matching flip-flops
 runs by.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby
 railing, and then launches itself back into the air.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man reels in a tiny fish, grunts in disgust, and tosses it
 back.

>ask man about crabs
 I don't know the word "crabs".

>ask man about crab
 The old man scuffs his heavy shoes against the cement floor, but makes
 no reply.

 The old man stares grimly at the sun, as if daring it to sink any
 lower.

>examine tackle box
 The tackle box is a grownup's toychest full of colorful lures, shiny
 bobs, and dull metal weights.

 A small child bobbles into the area and tries to sneak up behind the
 old man, only to break out laughing.  The old man jerks in surprise
 and throws the child a long, harsh glare.

>ask man about fishing.
 He beams uncharacteristically.  "'Relda and the kids picked it out for
 my birthday."

 The old man pulls back hard on his rod, pulling the line taut.

>ask man about tackle box
 He glances at the box and beams uncharacteristically.  "My grandkids
 got it for me last Christmas."

 The old man draws a cigarette from his breast pocket, rolls it
 meditatively between thumb and forefingers, and then puts it away.

>ask man about lures
 He glances at the box and beams uncharacteristically.  "My grandkids
 got it for me last Christmas."

 The slight breeze carries the sound of the old man grumbling to
 himself.

>ask man about cigarette
 I don't know the word "cigarette".

>ask man about why is worthless and not helping us in our crazy quests
 I don't know the word "why".

>sneak up on man
 I don't know the word "sneak".

>kick bucket
 The old man spots you reaching for his pail and fires off a
 smouldering glower that burns straight through the center of your
 forehead.

 The old man plays out a few lengths of line.

>go west
 The light of the setting sun stabs into your eyes as you exit the
 shade of the small shelter.  You wait a moment for your eyes to adjust
 and then begin the long stroll down the pier.

 A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
 horizon.

>go south
 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.  The vendor has gone
 home for the night.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.
    Sitting on the snack bar is a length of rope.

 An early evening breeze fills your nose with the tangy scent of brine.

>take rope
 Taken.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

 It's a short, stout section of rope, about half as long as you are

 no purpose, so you untie them.

>remove shrimp from strap
 Which strap do you mean, the white rubber strap, or the black neoprene
 strap?

>white
 You detach the white rubber strap from the shrimp.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>tie shrimp to rope
 You try, but the coarse rope is too thick to be knotted around the
 shrimp.

 A young, auburn haired woman wearing nothing more than sneakers and an
 incredibly revealing thong bikini jogs past.  Jogging alongside her is

 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.
    You see a shrimp here.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting
 on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
 a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

 The old man draws a cigarette from his breast pocket, rolls it
 meditatively between thumb and forefingers, and then puts it away.

>examine fish
 A couple of flounder and some grouper, but mostly a bunch of red
 herring.

 The old man stares out to sea, and solemnly salutes a far away tanker.

>watch man
 I don't know the word "watch".

>examine man
 He looks like he just stepped out of a Hemingway novel.  He stares out
 to sea, lantern jaw thrust defiantly forward, stony countenance
 unbroken by any hint of emotion, while the evening breeze tousles his
 iron gray hair.  He wears a rumpled blue shirt, brown canvas slacks,
 and heavy boots.  The cuffs of his shirt are rolled up to the elbows,
 revealing forearms of corded steel.  Powerful hands, scarred times
 beyond measure, anchor a rod no more rigid than themselves.

 The old man pulls back on his rod with all his might, struggling to
 reel in whatever he's hooked.  Incredibly, an enormous marlin breaks
 the surface!  But victory is short lived.  The line snaps and the old
 man staggers nearly off his feet.

>take shrimp
 Taken.

 The slight breeze carries the sound of the old man grumbling to
 himself.

>give shrimp to man
 The old man's head turns towards you as if driven by archaic
 machinery.  You can almost hear the gears groaning.  He stares at you
 expressionlessly for a long, embarrassing moment that drags on
 interminably.  Finally, his eyes dismiss you with a nearly
 imperceptible flicker before beginning the long return voyage out to
 sea.

 The slight breeze carries the sound of the old man grumbling to
 himself.

>ask man about job
 You don't know of any such thing.

 The old man consults his bait box, and reties his line with a new
 lure.

>give rope to man
 I don't see any rope here.

>take tackle
 The old man spots you reaching for his tackle box and fires off a
 smouldering glower that burns straight through the center of your
 forehead.

 The old man draws a cigarette from his breast pocket, rolls it
 meditatively between thumb and forefingers, and then puts it away.

>ask man about lobster trap
 The old man frowns, but says nothing.

 The old man doggedly reels in a few lengths of line.

>look
 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

 An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting

>go west
 The light of the setting sun stabs into your eyes as you exit the
 shade of the small shelter.  You wait a moment for your eyes to adjust
 and then begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

>go south
 The railing prevents you from walking off the pier.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>jump off south railing
 I don't understand that sentence.

>go down
 If you want to jump off the pier, just say so.  Otherwise, there is no
 way down.

 A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
 horizon.

>jump off pier
 You climb over the railing and maneuver yourself so that you're
 standing on your heels facing out with your toes hanging out over
 empty space.  You steel yourself, take a deep breath, and...  jump!
 The ground rushes up faster than you could have imagined.  It seems
 you've only just jumped when wham!  Your feet hit the ground with a
 stinging impact that sends you sprawling forwards into the sand.  You
 lie, stunned, for several moments.  After a time the stinging fades
 from your feet, if not from your memory, and you climb back to a
 vertical position.  You seem to have lost one of your posessions in
 the fall.

 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass
 through the pylons supporting the long pier that stretches east from
 the pavilion.
    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be
 some sort of reptile.
    You see a mussel shell, a crab shell, a snail shell, and a shrimp,
 lying in the sand.

>take shrimp
 Taken.

>inventory
 You have a pair of shorts (being worn), a bathing suit (being worn), a
 scuba mask (being worn), and a shrimp.
    The pocket of your shorts seems to contain some money and your
 passcard.

>se
 The surf glides up to meet you as you approach the water, a cool shock
 against your warm skin.

 Shallow Water, Beneath Pier
 The knee-deep water here is cooled by the shadow of the pier, which
 here rises to almost three times your height.  A pair of metal pipes
 run the length of it, presumably a part of the pavilion's plumbing.
 The avenue of supporting pylons leads west, on to the sand, and also
 continued into deeper water to the east.  You can escape the pier's
 chilly shadow to the north or south.

>se
 You launch yourself towards deeper water, skimming along for a few
 yards before coming to a stop.

 The shrimp shows renewed life as it makes contact with the salt water.

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)
 There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters
 beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to
 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The gradually sloping ocean floor is only about ten feet below the
 surface here.  The sandy bottom is layered with a suspension of mud
 and fine silt.  Here and there, thin leaved plants claw through the
 mud like grasping fingers.  Dominating the entire area is an enormous
 slab of barnacle encrusted rock.

 The crab, which had resumed its perch on top of the rock, scuttles
 back into the fissure on your approach.

 The crab extends its eye stalks and peers tentatively from the
 fissure, as if sensing the shrimp's presence.  Unfortunately, it soon
 spots you and retreats back into its hole.

>stir mud
 I don't know the word "stir".

>examine mud
 The mud covers all of the ocean floor.

 The crab extends its eye stalks and peers tentatively from the
 fissure, as if sensing the shrimp's presence.  Unfortunately, it soon

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

>move mud
 You can't move the mud.

 The crab extends its eye stalks and peers tentatively from the
 fissure, as if sensing the shrimp's presence.  Unfortunately, it soon

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

 Lungs burning, you kick and claw your way toward the glittering
 sunlight above you.  Gasping, you break the surface and fill your
 lungs with the salty ocean air.

 Damp Sand, Beneath Pier
 You stand in the cool shadow of the long pier, among its supporting
 pylons.  The pylons lead east like a subterranean avenue.  A pair of
 pipes runs the length of the pier, presumably a part of the pavilion's
 plumbing.  To the west, the dunes that surround the pavilion part to
 allow passage beneath it.  You can escape the pier's chilly shadow to
 the north or south.
    A great crystalline castle dominates the area, rising nearly to the
 underside of the pier.
    You see an antique bottle, lying in the sand.

>climb ramp
 With great trepidation, you set one foot on the lowest part of the
 spiral ramp. It supports your weight.  You try the other foot.  When
 the ramp fails to collapse, you start climbing, slowly, carefully,
 leaning on the nearby towers for support.  Thank goodness for the blue
 plastic sheets inlaid in the ramp.  Without them, the glassy surface
 would be far too slick to climb.  You circle the castle once, twice,
 three times, four, all the while looking nervously up at the needle
 sharp spires.  Eventually, the ramp becomes too narrow for you to
 continue any further.  But, by bracing one foot against the topmost
 spire and standing on the toes of the other, you can just reach the
 pipes above.  You reach for the shining object and...  Ahh!  Your foot
 glides off the glossy spire and you fall to your behind on the ramp.
 Gravity takes over and sends you sliding down the ramp, rear end
 scraping blue plastic through turn after turn.  Finally, you slide
 into the sand at the base of the castle, unharmed.  Wow!  What a trip!
 Only then do you discover that you succeeded in pulling down the
 reflective object, because you've still got it clenched tightly in
 your white knuckled fist.

 You examine the object to discover that you've retrieved a black
 banded scuba mask.

>remove goggle
 You strip the goggles off of your head.

>wear mask
 You pull back the tough strap and slide the mask over your head.  It
 fits snugly, creating a tight seal.

 A tiny crab rushes from an invisible hole by your feet and scuttles
 away, quickly disappearing into another, equally invisible hole.

>e.e

 You launch yourself towards deeper water, skimming along for a few
 yards before coming to a stop.

 Deep Water, Beneath Pier, (treading water)
 The long pier finally comes to an end, the last of its supporting
 pylons disappearing into the murky depths below.  To the east lies
 nothing but endless ocean.  The welcoming sands of the beach lie back
 to the west.  Or you can strike off north or south, parallel to the
 shoreline.

>go down
 You fill your lungs to capacity and dive into the water.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The sandy ocean floor lies about ten feet below the surface, layered
 with silt and dotted with climbing green fingers of sea grass.  The
 angled cement pillars that support the pier end here.  Just beyond the
 final pair of pillars is a sudden drop off, a steep slope that leads
 down and down, far beyond your limited visibility.

>go down
 With a strong kick, you propel yourself towards the depths beyond the
 slope.  Visibility dims slightly as you move away from the warming
 light of the sun, and the pillars fall away behind you.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope continues its sharp descent, inclining almost vertically.
 Though the level of ambient light has diminished, the sun still shines
 down strongly, fluttering on the surface above you.

 Pressure starts to build in your lungs.

>go down
 You continue your drop down the face of the slope.  The temperature
 drops severely as you pass through a thermocline, and the mounting
 pressure makes your ears ache.  You pinch your nose shut with thumb
 and forefinger, and exhale gently to clear the pressure.

 Underwater, (drifting)
 The slope just keeps on descending.  The amount of sunlight that
 reaches you has diminished quite a bit and the water has become quite
 cold.  Below you all is dark, but for a small glint of light hinting
 through the darkness.
    Half buried in the mud of the steep slope is some sort of wire
 frame construction.

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

>examine wire
 The construction's function isn't immediately obvious, so you clear
 away some of the mud surrounding it.  It turns out to be a rough box
 made of wooden slats and chicken wire.  There's a gaping hole in one
 face, where something has punched through the wire and splintered the
 surrounding slats.  Apparently, it's a busted up lobster trap.
 Needless to say, the trap is empty.  In the process of uncovering the
 trap, you've also revealed a short length of thick rope that's tied to
 it.

 A few small bubbles escape your lips, glittering in the light as they
 rise towards the surface.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first
 feelings of panic and setting your heart racing.

>pull rope
 You tug on the length of rope, but nothing happens.

 Your lungs are on fire and blue blood pounds in your veins, setting
 off waves of panic.  You can control yourself no longer!  Instinct
 takes over and sends you kicking and clawing your way to the surface.
 You rise and rise and can't climb fast enough and finally, just when
 you don't think you're going to make it, you break the surface.  You
 sputter and gasp, inhaling deeply of the fresh salty air.  After a few
 moments, the fire in your lungs subsides and calm is restored to your
 pounding veins.

    You see a length of rope, drifting in the mud.
    The length of rope waves in the current, anchored to the busted
 trap.

 The pressure turns into an itch, which quickly becomes a burning heat.

 The length of rope isn't long enough to join the busted trap to you.

 The burning pain in your lungs grows stronger, triggering the first

 Deep Water, South of Pier, (treading water)
 There's nothing but endless ocean to the east.  Shallower waters
 beckon to the west.  The long cement pier finally comes to an end to
 the north of you, its supporting pylons disappearing into the murky
 depths.

>go west
 You kick back towards shore, skimming along for a few yards before
 coming to rest in shallower water.

 Shallow Water, South of Pier
 You're up to your knees in the gently surging tide.  It flows up onto
 the beach to the west and grows deeper to the east.  To the north, you
 can pass among the pylons supporting the pier.

>go west
 You splash merrily out of the shallow water, on to the hard packed
 sand.

 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier
 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into
 the larger castle.

>go west
 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 Two strutting male gulls face off, puffing out their breast feathers
 and bobbing their heads in each other's direction.  A noise
 suspiciously like laughter emanates from several female gulls, and the
 two males hurriedly stand down.

>examine message
 In letters a hand high, someone has written "Here There Be Dragons."
 Beneath that, they've drawn a simple compass rose with an arrow
 pointing to the northeast.

 Something brushes your shoulder.  You pivot, instinctively, just in
 time to see a gull sweep past your head.

>go northwest
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a strapless pair of goggles, a cork, a broken stave, an
 antique bottle, a clam shell, a length of rope, and a white rubber
 strap here.

>examine cork
 It's stained a dark mahogany color.

>take cork
 Taken.

 the broken stave to the shrimp.

>go northeast
 You skip along the wooden boardwalk to the beach, evoking a strong
 memory of the carefree summer days of your childhood.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

>search barrel
 You root through the trash, tossing aside ice cream wrappers and soft
 drink cups.  You don't find anything else of interest.

>go east
 The warm dry sand gives way to cool wet sand as you move closer to the
 shoreline.

 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass

 You harvest the shell from your simple trap.  It proves to be quite

 You're still admiring your shiny new prize when your eye is caught by
 a tiny motion from above.  Your eyes are drawn to the very tip of the
 pier, where the old man is just visible as a small blob of shadow
 against the pale sky.  It's hard to tell from here, but he seems to be
 putting his pole away.

>examine shell
 It's a beautiful conch shell, half the size of your head.  Nature has
 painted its whorls a luscious, glossy pink, and dotted them with
 subtly toned spots of brown and white.  A crab is packed tightly
 inside it, entirely hidden but for one bony claw.

 You splash merrily out of the shallow water, on to the hard packed
 sand.

 Damp Sand, South of Pier
 To the east, the shallow surf ebbs and flows up onto the cold, wet
 sand.  The sand turns into powdery gold back to the west.  To the
 north, you can pass among the pylons supporting the long pier that
 extends from the pavilion.  The small castle you found here earlier
 has disappeared.  The mites must have integrated its materials into
 the larger castle.

>go west
 Cool wet sand gives way to warm dry sand as you climb up the beach.

 Dry Sand, South of Pier
 The cool early evening has left the beach nearly deserted but for a
 few joggers and unsupervised children.  To the east, the dry, powdery
 sand goes hard as it rolls down toward the swelling tide.  The
 boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the north, tall dunes flank the
 base of the pavilion, blocking your way.
    Someone has scrawled a message and a simple diagram in the powdery
 sand.
    A heap of trash has been scattered into the sand by the squabbling
 flock of gulls.  The shallow hole you dug here earlier is still
 visible.

 Hundreds of gulls are engaged in a fierce battle over the pile of
 refuse, squabbling and squawking at each other and filling the air
 with hungry shrieks.

 A toddler of about four, gurgling excitedly, barrels into the flock of
 gulls.  A flurry of white and grey feathers explodes into the air,
 only to flap back to earth a few feet away.

>go west
 You skip across the wooden boardwalk, passing over the scrub covered
 dunes.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a strapless pair of goggles, an antique bottle, a clam
 shell, a length of rope, and a cork here.

>go east
 You skip lightly up the concrete stairs to the pavilion.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.

 An early evening breeze fills your nose with the tangy scent of brine.

>go east
 The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of
 the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 A young boy wearing a bright blue bathing suit and matching flip-flops
 runs by.

 The conch shell rocks in your grasp.

>go east
 It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the
 small shelter.

 End of Pier
 The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
 roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
 pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds
 you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
 towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.

 The old man is here, apparently packing up for the night.

 The old man seems reluctantly to be packing his gear away.  He's
 already reeled in his line, and his rod lies beside him.  He stows the
 flies, lures and weights into the tackle box and folds it up.  Then,
 he draws a large folding blade from his hip pocket and proceeds to gut
 his catch.  He takes each fish in turn from the pail and deftly
 decapitates it, slits it lengthwise, strips out the viscera, and
 sweeps the offal into the sea.  Once done, he wraps each fish in
 newspaper and tosses them into a burlap sack at his feet.  Once the
 pail is empty, he swings the sack over his shoulder, collects his rod
 and tackle, and turns his feet to the west.

>examine pail
 It's a large metal pail, left behind by the old man.

 The old man hikes off toward the setting sun, hauling away the day's
 catch in the burlap sack slung over his shoulder.  Whether by chance
 or intent, he seems to have left the pail behind.

>take pail
 You've already got your hands full.

 An elderly couple strolls past you, hand in hand, clearly enjoying the
 sunset.

>drop stave
 You toss the broken stave and the white rubber strap to the ground.

>take pail
 Taken.

 A bunch of young children run past, slowing only long enough to point
 at you and giggle.

>go west
 The light of the setting sun stabs into your eyes as you exit the
 shade of the small shelter.  You wait a moment for your eyes to adjust
 and then begin the long stroll down the pier.

 Middle of Pier
 The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
 great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
 small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the
 fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.

 sunset.

 The conch shell rocks in your grasp.

>jump off pier
 You climb over the railing and maneuver yourself so that you're
 standing on your heels facing out with your toes hanging out over
 empty space.  You steel yourself, take a deep breath, and...  jump!
 The ground rushes up faster than you could have imagined.  It seems
 you've only just jumped when wham!  Your feet hit the ground with a
 stinging impact that sends you sprawling forwards into the sand.  You
 lie, stunned, for several moments.  After a time the stinging fades
 from your feet, if not from your memory, and you climb back to a
 vertical position.  You seem to have lost several of your posessions
 in the fall.

 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass
 through the pylons supporting the long pier that stretches east from
 the pavilion.
    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be
 some sort of reptile.
    You see a mussel shell, a crab shell, a snail shell, a conch shell,
 and a pail, lying in the sand.

>take conch
 Taken.

>put conch in cavity
 You set the conch shell in the cavity.  It's a perfect fit, and
 somehow you can feel the...  rightness...  of it.  A shiver seems to
 ripple over the dragon's spine, as if presaging some magical
 awakening.  Uh oh.  Sensing the lack of any restraint, the crab has
 also begun to stir.  It probes the sculpted sand beneath it and,
 finding no resistance, extends its claws and scuttles out of the
 cavity.  It falls from the dragon's face, then retreats hastily back
 into its shell on impact with the wet sandy floor.

>take conch, pail
 The conch shell:  Taken.
 The pail:  Taken.

>go east
 The surf glides up to meet you as you approach the water, a cool shock
 against your warm skin.

 Shallow Water, North of Pier
 The surf swells around your knees, occasionally surging up to your
 waist.  You can crawl up onto the beach to the west, where someone has
 built a large sand sculpture above the ebbing surf, or swim into
 deeper water to the east.  To the south, you can pass through the
 cement pylons supporting the pier.

>fill pail with water
 You dip the bucket into the ocean, where it fills up immediately.  The
 added weight of the water in the bucket staggers you, forcing you to
 hold it with both hands.  You set the conch in the pail to keep from
 losing it in the surf.

>go west
 Splashing and struggling under the weight of the pail full of water,
 you stagger out of the shallow surf.

 Damp Sand, North of Pier
 The damp, hard packed sand is darkened almost to bronze by the
 relentless tide to the east, while to the west it lightens to a
 powdery gold before ending in tall dunes.  To the south, you can pass
 through the pylons supporting the long pier that stretches east from
 the pavilion.
    Someone has built an enormous sand sculpture here.  It seems to be
 some sort of reptile.
    You see a mussel shell, a crab shell, and a snail shell, lying in
 the sand.

>go west
 Hard packed wet sand gives way to loose dry sand as you struggle up
 the beach under the weight of the pail full of water.

 Dry Sand, North of Pier
 The season is early and the day late, leaving the beach deserted but
 for a few strollers.  The golden sand turns dark as it leads east
 toward the tide line , where someone has built a large sand sculpture.
 The boardwalk lies back to the west.  To the south, tall dunes flank
 the base of the Tybrisa Pavilion, blocking your way.
    Chained to the end of the boardwalk is a trash barrel.

 A slight gust raises a thin skein of sand and whips it across your
 ankles.

>go west
 You stagger west over the boardwalk under the weight of the pail full
 of water, thankful to have solid ground under your feet.

 Beach Path
 The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads
 east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
 boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
 boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
 near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
 towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.
    There's an ugly gap in the path.
    You see a strapless pair of goggles, an antique bottle, a clam
 shell, a length of rope, and a cork here.

>go east
 Bucket in hands, you stagger up the concrete ramp.  It's a good thing
 the ramp was there, as you doubt you could have carried the water
 filled bucket up all those stairs.

 Pavilion
 You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
 for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
 unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
 Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
 your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
 a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
 the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.
    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
 stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice
 your height.

 A young, auburn haired woman wearing nothing more than sneakers and an
 incredibly revealing thong bikini jogs past.  Jogging alongside her is
 a darkly-tanned, slim-hipped young man, similarly dressed.

>go south
 You stagger south under the bucket's weight.

 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.  The vendor has gone
 home for the night.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.

 A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby
 railing, and then launches itself back into the air.

>pour water into boiler
 Which water do you mean, the salt water, or the ocean water?

>salt
 You heave the heavy pail full of water up to your chest and set it on
 the counter.  Before tipping the pail out, you remove the item from it
 and set it on the counter.  Then, you pour the contents of the pail
 into the boiler in a quick, heavy stream.  The water from the pail
 fills the boiler about three quarters of the way to the top.  You
 figure that should be sufficient.

 The shell rocks as the crab inside considers its surroundings.

 Taken.

 The conch shell rocks in your grasp.

>examine sieve
 It's an open-topped wireframe box with a metal handle, used to extract
 and drain peanuts from the boiler.  It's currently submerged in
 boiling water.

 The conch shell rocks in your grasp.

>put conch in sieve
 You toss the conch shell in the sieve.

 A young, auburn haired woman wearing nothing more than sneakers and an
 incredibly revealing thong bikini jogs past.  Jogging alongside her is
 a darkly-tanned, slim-hipped young man, similarly dressed.  The crab
 crawls out of the sieve and falls into the boiler.

 The crab scuttles about in the boiler, revived by the cool salt water.

>turn on boiler
 You turn the knob to the 'On' position.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

 The crab darts back and forth in the boiler, agitated by the water's
 warmth.

 The crab scuttles along the walls of the boiler, searching frenziedly
 for any escape from the searing heat.  Finally, it gets one claw over
 the lip of the boiler and pulls itself out and onto the counter.

>turn off boiler
 You turn the knob back to the 'Off' position.

 An early evening breeze fills your nose with the tangy scent of brine.

>take sieve
 You consider the near boiling water, and decide otherwise.

 The shell rocks as the crab inside considers its surroundings.

 Steam ceases to rise from the water in the boiler.

 By the Snack Bar
 A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while
 the rest of the pavilion sprawls out to the north.  A hand-painted
 sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.  The vendor has gone
 home for the night.
    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.
    Sitting on the snack bar is a conch shell.

>listen to shell
 It occurs to you that you'd need to be holding it in order to put it
 against your ear.

 The water in the boiler stops simmering and comes to rest.

>examine crab
 It's a beautiful conch shell, half the size of your head.  Nature has
 painted its whorls a luscious, glossy pink, and dotted them with
 subtly toned spots of brown and white.  A crab is packed tightly
 inside it, entirely hidden but for one bony claw.

 Several gulls land nearby, briefly tussle over some invisible morsel,
 and fly off shrieking.

>turn on boiler
 You turn the knob to the 'On' position.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.

>salt
 It's ordinary salt water from the ocean.

 An early evening breeze fills your nose with the tangy scent of brine.

 The water in the boiler reaches full boil.

>put conch in sieve
 You toss the conch shell in the sieve.

 The breeze carries the sound of a calypso drum from somewhere far down
 the beach.  The crab crawls out of the sieve and falls into the
 boiler.

 A high, piercing shriek - a horrible sound that you wouldn't imagine a
 crustacean capable of - emanates from the crab as it, quite literally,
 dies a screaming death in the boiling salt water.  The crab shoots
 from its overheated shell in a vain, frenzied attempt at escape.  A
 bare moment later, the doomed creature floats to the top of the water,
 while its former home drops like a stone to the bottom of the boiler.

>turn off boiler
 You turn the knob back to the 'Off' position.

 You consider the boiling water, and decide otherwise.

 A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
 horizon.

>examine crab
 It looks like an ordinary boiled crab to me.

>eat crab
 You crack the shell open without hesitation.  The crab's juices
 dribble out over your chin as you suck out the sweet meat.  Mmm!  You
 couldn't have gotten better at Savannah's finest restaurant.  Oh, if
 only you had some butter and a bit of lemon juice!  Once you finish,
 you discard the broken bits of shell and wipe your greasy hands off on
 your damp shorts.

 A fat, grey gull swoops past you, lands momentarily on the nearby
 railing, and then launches itself back into the air.

 You skip along the wooden boardwalk to the beach, evoking a strong
 memory of the carefree summer days of your childhood.

 You set the conch shell in the cavity.  It's a perfect fit, and
 somehow you can feel the...  rightness...  of it.  A shiver seems to
 ripple down the dragon's spine, as if presaging some magical
 awakening.  The ripple rebounds from the tail and shudders back up the
 spine, growing in force and velocity until it disappears into the base
 of the creature's skull.  Then, slowly, lazily, the eyes open as if
 from a long, restful sleep.  Suddenly the head darts forward, causing
 you to leap back, fearful of an attack.  But the creature is merely
 stretching its long, sinuous neck.  Its angular head splits open in a
 great, toothy yawn that sends you peddling still further back.  Then,
 it rises up on its plump forelegs and shakes from side to side like a
 dog throwing off droplets of water.  Stretched and shaken, the
 creature throws its head skyward and trumpets forth with an
 elephantine roar that rattles your bones and sends every gull in the
 vicinity flapping away down the beach.  The creature's wings snap open
 with a loud crack that echoes out over the water like gunshot.
 Finally, the great, sandy beast glances around the beach, tightens the
 muscles of its powerful hind legs, and launches itself into the air.
 In an instant, it is airborne, beating the air with mighty strokes of
 its wings.  Its tail whips from side to side as it claws at the air,
 climbing higher and higher.  It turns to the west, toward the setting
 sun and the great marshy wetlands.  Soon, it's just a speck against
 the pastel smudged sky.  Then, gone.

 Incredible.  You've never believed that there was any real magic in
 the world, though your heart has always wished otherwise.  Here it is
 not only proven, but shown to be the result of singular personal
 vision.  What else but the sculptor's purity of belief in his creation
 could have brought it to life?  It gets you to thinking about work
 again, and how infrequently it lets you pursue your own vision.

 You're feeling resolute.  "That's it.  I'm quitting."  You've made up
 your mind and thrown caution to the winds.  First thing on Monday,
 you're going to write your letter of resignation.  You feel
 exhilaratingly light, as if some constant pressure had been removed.
 You're sure that this is the right decision.

 A thin crest of white foam glides up the beach and covers your toes
 before gently receding.

>score
 Not exactly a score as such, but...

 -  The castle builders have revitalized your waning belief in a world
 full of wondrous novelty.
 -  Your sunset vision has reawakened your appreciation for the beauty
 of the mundane.
 -  Your strange kidnapping experience has rewarded you with the
 treasures of life and freedom.
 -  The coral reef has shown you that beauty may be found in unexpected
 places.
 -  The ghostly dancers have reminded you of the ineluctable joy of
 creative expression.
 -  The sand dragon's flight has proven the power and the magic of
 personal vision.

 As the last rays of the sun dip below the horizon, a scrap of verse
 runs through your mind.  It's something you read on a tombstone in
 Savannah's colonial cemetery.

 "My life is like the Summer Rose,
    "That opens to the morning sky;
 "But ere the shades of evening close
    "Is scattered on the ground - to die."

 You recall that it was penned by Richard Henry Wilde.  It was inspired
 by brother James' descriptions of Florida, where he campaigned against
 the Seminoles.  Richard left his epic poem unfinished after James was
 shot through the heart in a duel with a fellow officer.

 You reflect on all the things you've seen and done here today.
 Somehow, life seems more precious now.  With life so short, why spend
 so much time and energy on a job you hate?  Especially at the expense
 of the creative pursuits that make life worth living.

 Yes, you think, it's definitely time for some change...
