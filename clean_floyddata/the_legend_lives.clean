 A pattern of bits shifts inside your computer.  New information
 scrolls up the screen.

    It is not good.

 As the impact of the discovery settles on your psyche, you recall
 the preceding events:  your recent enrollment at Akmi Yooniversity;
 your serendipitous discovery of the joys of Classical Literature -- a
 nice change of pace from computer hacking; your compuarchaeological
 discovery of the long-forgotten treasures that will make your thesis
 one of the most important this decade.  But now that's all a bit moot,
 isn't it?

 How ironic:  You were stunned at how *real* the primitive Unnkulian
 stories seemed.  Now you know why.

 Your bachelor pod

 Ahhhhh.  Pod sweet pod!  Sure feels good to be back in the ol'
 closet-sized capsule again, yes sir.  While slaving away on your
 master's thesis you've spent many late hours here, sustaining yourself

 Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

 Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

 Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds
 of light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for
 them to put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts
 of the galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod
 is situated on.

 On your desk is your EV, and next to that sits the computer you use
 nearly 37 hours a day.  Or at least you *assume* it's there; you can't
 really see it.  It's buried under the pile of books that just crashed
 down in front of you as you hit your head on the shelf above upon
 reading more of the awful truth about the Unnkulians.  Still rubbing
 the bruise on your topknot, you pick up all the books and put them
 back in order.

 The EV is tuned to Hot Hits 1000, the "newest, coolest, most
 outrageous" music video station.  Yep, it's pop, 37 hours a day.
 Right now you see the video for "I Want a Girl with Green Hair and
 Horns," by Timon Sketch and the Hoi-Polloi.

    A full ReVoLT Kola can is here.

 You have a Galacticard, your thesis research floppy disk, and a matter

>examine galacticard
 0/7 

 Everyone has a Galacticard; it's essential for everything from
 checking out library books to buying a new house.  The shiny
 holographic stamp on the card not only prevents counterfeiting, but
 stores a few megabytes of data about you as well [<span class="floydstyle i">3</span>].

>note 3
 0/8 

 [<span class="floydstyle i">3</span>]: There was a great public outcry when the cards were
 introduced as part of the new Republic 94 years ago.  Many claimed
 that the cards were an invasion of privacy and refused to use them; it
 wasn't until Akmi made it official policy to accept only Galacticards
 for all their goods and services that they became truly ubiquitous and
 universal.  Ha!  -- Imagine how inconvenient everything would be
 without one!

 It's a standard 5 centimeter square optical disk with your thesis
 research materials on it.  There is a label on one side with your
 writing on it.  The label reads, "Unnkulian Unventures I, II, and III

 Unfortunately, the games were designed to be run on an old
 Zippikraft machine that's pretty hard to find these days.

>examine autodialer
 0/10 

 The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

 To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [<span class="floydstyle i">4</span>].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod

 Most of the textbooks are uninteresting treatises on various aspects
 of computer science, physics, chemistry, and all the other boring
 stuff you've taken classes in over the past few years.  Also present,
 however, are the many tomes of literature you've become so interested
 in of late.  As you leaf through your first year physics textbook, you
 find your old color chart.  So that's where that thing was!  You pick
 it up and take it with you.

>examine kola

 The ReVoLT Kola can has the usual gaudy tomato red and
 intergalactic orange design and the standard snappy slogan:  "Make
 every cell in your body RIOT...  with ReVoLT!"  The makers of this
 beverage claim that it is the most powerful stimulant available
 without a prescription.  You've probably taken years off your life
 with this toxic elixir.

    The can seems to contain some carbonated beverage.

>examine nowtz
 0/17 

 The hundred or so Stik-Em Nowtz littering your pod are largely
 incomprehensible; most of them are scribbled diagrams and notes you've
 made to yourself during your two year stay here.  Among the
 long-forgotten reminders you find the address of Terminal Velocity,
 the favorite hang-out for the galaxy's best computer jocks.  It says,
 "Hot Pink (+0, -52, -5) [<span class="floydstyle i">5</span>]," but a fat lot of good that's
 going to do you.

 You chuckle as you recall your last visit there three years ago --
 they weren't particularly interested in yet another 3-dimensional
 chess program, especially one that couldn't beat their own weekend
 implementations.  Trying to find software that'll impress them enough
 to let you in is nearly impossible, which is why it's the most
 exclusive club around.  It's also probably the best source of computer
 information in the galaxy...

 once they've found a formula that works.)  It's orange, it's mauve,

 irregularly shaped bulbous case.  The screen is nearly square and
 inset at a jaunty angle.  In short, a typical product of the Akmi

 [<span class="floydstyle i">7</span>]: Type "watch ev" to get just a description of what's on the
 screen.

 0/26 

 It's a Zippikraft Data Liquidizer 1024/A -- that's the technical
 term for "one fast machine."  Zippikraft makes the fastest computing
 hardware in the galaxy using technology no one else has been able to
 copy yet, despite several years of desperate (and creative) industrial
 espionage [<span class="floydstyle i">8</span>].

 Your Liquidizer is entirely lime green, the only color Zippikraft
 computers come in, with a built-in optical disk drive, detachable
 keyboard and high-resolution HoloScanning monitor.  You don't usually
 use the 3D video mode in your research since you deal mainly with
 text, but it's great for impressing guests and convincing your parents
 that the machine was really worth as much as the rest of your entire
 college education costs combined.

 Liquidizers also come with built-in AkNet transceivers, allowing
 access to Akmi's galactic network, which now permeates almost all
 aspects of daily life, from electronic mail to shopping and funds
 transfers.  You use AkNet to access the many ancient literature
 archives in the galaxy, particularly those that might have lost works
 on the mythical Unnkulians.

 Mythical...  or so it seemed.  Your Liquidizer's screen is still
 silently displaying the portentous words "the Unnkulians shall rule
 again!"

 These words, you recall, explain the painful bruise on your head.
 And why you've got to do everything in your power to stop the virus
 the Unnkulians have unleashed upon AkNet.

 Who'd have thought you'd really find anything of value by searching
 random records in AkNet's database for "Unnkul," much less the code to
 a virus that's probably been wending its way through AkNet's bowels
 for years.  Only the Unnkulians' matchless arrogance and some divine
 force could have led you to this single black grain of sand in the
 immense digital beach that is AkNet.

 Yes, the Unnkulians' supreme arrogance -- an arrogance that's
 driven them to broadcast their secret declaration of war with the very
 instrument their success depends upon -- will (with any luck) prove to
 be their downfall again, as told so many times in the tales of the
 ancient Valley King Era battles with these thoroughly evil creatures;
 legends that you've nearly come to memorize through thousands of
 readings.

 But how to stop the virus?  How can you halt the relentless
 progress of this robotic self-propagating piece of Unnkulian
 handiwork, their will and psyche and utter evilness distilled into
 crisp, razor-sharp digital efficiency?

 And what if, as in "Unnkulian Unventure II:  The Secret of Acme,"
 your most recent compuarchaeological find (and one of only two known
 examples of Unnkulian literature from the 5th VK Era, both of which
 are computer-driven interactive literature, and both of which only you
 will know about until your thesis is published), Akmi is involved?
 Contacting the main AkNet headquarters might be the worst possible
 tactic; if Akmi is allied with the Unnkulians again, your spouting off
 about the virus would be disastrous, and probably fatal.

 And what have the Unnkulians been doing all these years?  Where are
 they now?  And did the world simply forget about them between 2nd VK
 Era and 5th VK Era [<span class="floydstyle i">9</span>], or did the Unnkulians destroy every
 reference to themselves they could find on AkNet in an attempt to
 rewrite history?

 So many questions.  So little time.  And the consequences of
 failure are great indeed.

 Unfortunately, your computer seems to have locked up.  Cycling the
 power has no effect.  You notice the unfamiliar text
 "hq.orange.akmi.aknet:  remote access = excomm" at the bottom of the
 screen.

 [<span class="floydstyle i">9</span>]: Researcher Jens Brams at Tel University unearthed the
 first Unnkulian tales in 2051VK.  They were paper texts, dating back
 to around 400VK -- late First Valley King Era to early Second.  Since
 then, many other similar works have been found, all from around the
 same period.

 Your treasures, the Unnkulian Unventures, are the only examples of
 Unnkulian literature dated later than 420VK -- you've traced them back
 to around 1701VK, the beginning of the Fifth Valley King Era.  They're
 especially interesting because they're early and primitive examples of
 what is now a widespread form:  interactive literature.  The works
 employ a rudimentary sentence parser to interact with the reader --
 quite unsophisticated, but nonetheless similar to today's
 government-regulated RLR's (Real Language Recognizers) in spirit.

 The Unnkulian Unventures portray their namesakes as wholly evil
 beings bent on destroying everything they are not a part of.

 Ahhhhh.  Pod sweet pod!  Sure feels good to be back in the ol'
 closet-sized capsule again, yes sir.  While slaving away on your
 master's thesis you've spent many late hours here, sustaining yourself

 Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

 Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

 Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds
 of light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for
 them to put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts
 of the galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod
 is situated on.

 On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you
 use nearly 37 hours a day.  Cuddled up right next to it like a best
 friend is your EV.

 The signal is fading in and out.  It sounds like music, but you
 can't tell what kind, and the picture is rolling like crazy.

 ... 

 It's a standard 5 centimeter square optical disk with your thesis
 research materials on it.  There is a label on one side with your
 writing on it.  The label reads, "Unnkulian Unventures I, II, and III
 (unfinished)."

 Unfortunately, the games were designed to be run on an old
 Zippikraft machine that's pretty hard to find these days.

>fold bed
 ... 

 You can't seem to get the bed to fold up into the wall.

>examine desk
 ... 

 Your desk is piled with papers and junk food containers.  What
 would your mother say?

 A Zippikraft optical disk drive, your Zippikraft Data Liquidizer
 1024/A, an Enterviewer (EV), and a Zippikraft detachable keyboard
 (attached to your Zippikraft Data Liquidizer 1024/A) are on your desk.

>examine liquidizer
 ... 

 It's a Zippikraft Data Liquidizer 1024/A -- that's the technical
 term for "one fast machine."  Zippikraft makes the fastest computing
 hardware in the galaxy using technology no one else has been able to
 copy yet, despite several years of desperate (and creative) industrial
 espionage [<span class="floydstyle i">8</span>].

 Your Liquidizer is entirely lime green, the only color Zippikraft
 computers come in, with a built-in optical disk drive, detachable
 keyboard and high-resolution HoloScanning monitor.  You don't usually
 use the 3D video mode in your research since you deal mainly with
 text, but it's great for impressing guests and convincing your parents
 that the machine was really worth as much as the rest of your entire
 college education costs combined.

 Liquidizers also come with built-in AkNet transceivers, allowing
 access to Akmi's galactic network, which now permeates almost all
 aspects of daily life, from electronic mail to shopping and funds
 transfers.

>examine containers
 ... 

 They're just normal junk food containers, more gross than interesting,
 frankly.

>get liquizider
 ... 

 I don't know the word "liquizider".

>get liquidizer
 ... 

 Your Zippikraft Data Liquidizer is not a portable.  In fact, it's not
 even a liftable or a movable, at least without a fork lift.

>Switch liquidizer to 3d
 ... 

 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine keyboard
 ... 

 It's just a standard 233-key model.  It is currently attached to your
 Zippikraft Data Liquidizer 1024/A.

>dial 2

 You can't turn the number.

>dial 2 on autodialer pad

 pan-galactic Cheez Games!

>set autodialer to 2
 ... 

 You can't turn the matter mover autodialer to anything.

>type 2 on autodialer
 ... 

 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter mover
 0/57 

 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Ada's pod

 You are in your true love Ada's pod.  It's quite similar to your
 own, but isn't nearly as messy.  Ada seems to have gone off and left
 saving the galaxy to you alone [<span class="floydstyle i">10</span>].

 On the EV, Progressive 52109 is playing the music video for "Zing

 Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central

 You are standing in the center of the Barfee Outlet, right next to
 the main matter mover.  Creatures of all races bustle around madly,
 looking for great deals on seeds.  A huge neon sign right beyond your
 nose screams, "Welcome to planet Flora, home of Barfee:  your one-stop
 source for vegetation."

 Here in the middle of Seed Central there's really nothing but
 people, and lots of them.  Or make that "creatures."  In any case,
 from here Barfee looks like a giant open market, with little stands
 here and there, and patrons and salescreatures arguing loudly over
 prices.

 The northern area of this arena seems to be devoted to vegetable
 seeds, while the southern area caters to fruit buyers.  To the east is
 a large warehouse in which they sell various varieties of flowers but
 the crowd gets really thick in that direction.  Westward you see all
 kinds of growing supplies.

 Barfee Fruit MegaStore

 The Barfee Fruit MegaStore is not quite as crowded as the rest of
 the outlet, but than again that's not saying much.  Fortunately
 walking around is easy here, and you can actually breathe, which is a
 definite plus.

 You find a friendly-looking salesperson standing in front of a
 large bin and approach him.  From the looks of it, he's a Hoppian.
 (The big floppy ears give it away.)  The bin is filled with fruit seed
 packets.  Seed Central is north of here.

 The Hoppian salesman waits until he thinks you're not looking, then
 straightens his bowtie and pulls back his ears, which, to his
 consternation, plop right back down into their usual cockeyed
 configuration.

>examine ears

 It's hard to say what makes it more obvious that the salesman
 standing in front of you is a Hoppian -- the fact that he looks like a
 giant rabbit, or the fact that he's exceedingly well-dressed.  The
 tuxedo looks quite smart on the 10-foot tall Barfee representative,
 whose light gray fur and two oversized shiny white teeth perfectly
 complement his picture-perfect formalwear.  His large, floppy ears
 might be best tucked into a spiffy top hat, you think, but then again
 they do add a bit of levity to an otherwise stuffy appearance.

 Your bachelor pod

 Ahhhhh.  Pod sweet pod!  Sure feels good to be back in the ol'
 closet-sized capsule again, yes sir.  While slaving away on your
 master's thesis you've spent many late hours here, sustaining yourself

 Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

 Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

 Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds
 of light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for
 them to put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts
 of the galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod
 is situated on.

 On your desk is your EV, and next to that sits the computer you use
 nearly 37 hours a day.  Or at least you *assume* it's there; you can't
 really see it.  It's buried under the pile of books that just crashed
 down in front of you as you hit your head on the shelf above upon
 reading more of the awful truth about the Unnkulians.  Still rubbing
 the bruise on your topknot, you pick up all the books and put them
 back in order.

 The EV is tuned to Hot Hits 1000, the "newest, coolest, most
 outrageous" music video station.  Yep, it's pop, 37 hours a day.

    It's a Zippikraft Data Liquidizer 1024/A -- that's the technical
 term for "one fast machine."  Zippikraft makes the fastest computing
 hardware in the galaxy using technology no one else has been able to
 copy yet, despite several years of desperate (and creative) industrial
 espionage [4].

    Your Liquidizer is entirely lime green, the only color Zippikraft
 computers come in, with a built-in optical disk drive, detachable
 keyboard and high-resolution HoloScanning monitor.  You don't usually
 use the 3D video mode in your research since you deal mainly with text,
 but it's great for impressing guests and convincing your parents that
 the machine was really worth as much as the rest of your entire college
 education costs combined.

    Liquidizers also come with built-in AkNet transceivers, allowing
 access to Akmi's galactic network, which now permeates almost all
 aspects of daily life, from electronic mail to shopping and funds
 transfers.  You use AkNet to access the many ancient literature
 archives in the galaxy, particularly those that might have lost works
 on the mythical Unnkulians.

    Mythical...  or so it seemed.  Your Liquidizer's screen is still
 silently displaying the portentous words "the Unnkulians shall rule
 again!"

    These words, you recall, explain the painful bruise on your head.
 And why you've got to do everything in your power to stop the virus the
 Unnkulians have unleashed upon AkNet.

    Who'd have thought you'd really find anything of value by searching
 random records in AkNet's database for "Unnkul," much less the code to
 a virus that's probably been wending its way through AkNet's bowels for
 years.  Only the Unnkulians' matchless arrogance and some divine force
 could have led you to this single black grain of sand in the immense
 digital beach that is AkNet.

    Yes, the Unnkulians' supreme arrogance -- an arrogance that's driven
 them to broadcast their secret declaration of war with the very
 instrument their success depends upon -- will (with any luck) prove to
 be their downfall again, as told so many times in the tales of the
 ancient Valley King Era battles with these thoroughly evil creatures;
 legends that you've nearly come to memorize through thousands of
 readings.

    But how to stop the virus?  How can you halt the relentless progress
 of this robotic self-propagating piece of Unnkulian handiwork, their
 will and psyche and utter evilness distilled into crisp, razor-sharp
 digital efficiency?

    And what if, as in "Unnkulian Unventure II:  The Secret of Acme,"
 your most recent compuarchaeological find (and one of only two known
 examples of Unnkulian literature from the 5th VK Era, both of which are
 computer-driven interactive literature, and both of which only you will
 know about until your thesis is published), Akmi is involved?
 Contacting the main AkNet headquarters might be the worst possible
 tactic; if Akmi is allied with the Unnkulians again, your spouting off
 about the virus would be disastrous, and probably fatal.

    And what have the Unnkulians been doing all these years?  Where are
 they now?  And did the world simply forget about them between 2nd VK
 Era and 5th VK Era [5], or did the Unnkulians destroy every reference
 to themselves they could find on AkNet in an attempt to rewrite
 history?

    So many questions.  So little time.  And the consequences of failure
 are great indeed.

    Unfortunately, your computer seems to have locked up.  Cycling the
 power has no effect.  You notice the unfamiliar text

 Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central

    You are standing in the center of the Barfee Outlet, right next to
 the main matter mover.  Creatures of all races bustle around madly,
 looking for great deals on seeds.  A huge neon sign right beyond your
 nose screams, "Welcome to planet Flora, home of Barfee:  your one-stop
 source for vegetation."

    Here in the middle of Seed Central there's really nothing but
 people, and lots of them.  Or make that "creatures."  In any case, from
 here Barfee looks like a giant open market, with little stands here and
 there, and patrons and salescreatures arguing loudly over prices.

    The northern area of this arena seems to be devoted to vegetable
 seeds, while the southern area caters to fruit buyers.  To the east is
 a large warehouse in which they sell various varieties of flowers but
 the crowd gets really thick in that direction.  Westward you see all
 kinds of growing supplies.

 Barfee Fruit MegaStore

    The Barfee Fruit MegaStore is not quite as crowded as the rest of
 the outlet, but than again that's not saying much.  Fortunately walking
 around is easy here, and you can actually breathe, which is a definite
 plus.

    You find a friendly-looking salesperson standing in front of a large
 bin and approach him.  From the looks of it, he's a Hoppian.  (The big
 floppy ears give it away.)  The bin is filled with fruit seed packets.
 Seed Central is north of here.

    "Is there something I might be able to help you with today?"  the
 Hoppian inquires, chuckling quietly but in an officious way that makes
 you feel kind of like you're in a classy jewelery store with nothing
 but 50% off coupons.

>buy plum seeds from hoppian
 I don't recognize that sentence.

>examine seeds
 Which seeds do you mean, the packet of blackberry seeds, the packet of
 blueberry seeds, the packet of boysenberry seeds, the packet of
 elderberry seeds, the packet of Hoppian gooseberry seeds, the packet of
 jostaberry seeds, the packet of kiwi seeds, the packet of Floran
 gowperfruit seeds, the packet of raspberry seeds, the packet of Grandpa
 Jones apple seeds, the packet of apricot seeds, the packet of Tellian
 cherry seeds, the packet of peach seeds, the packet of pear seeds, the
 packet of Todian plum seeds, the packet of persimmon seeds, or the
 packet of Akmi Dam Joosee Froot seeds?

>buy plum seeds
 Please specify who you want to pay for the packet of Todian plum seeds.

    Sensing your apparent awkwardness, the Hoppian behind the bin asks
 if you're a newcomer to the seed industry.  You reply that your
 girlfriend sent you to pick something up for her.  He gives you a look
 that seems to say, "Ah yes, of course.  That explains it.  Poor sap."

>pay hoppian
 The Hoppian smiles broadly as he takes the Galacticard.  "Credit;" he
 chimes, "very well, Sir," and disappears into the throng for a moment.
 He returns with an expression that seems to indicate that he's just
 gotten a whiff of something very unpleasant, and informs you that your
 card has been declined.  Gosh, I wonder what's happened to your credit
 rating?

    Sunlight dances off the Hoppian's whiskers as he wiggles his nose.

>examine card
 Everyone has a Galacticard; it's essential for everything from checking
 out library books to buying a new house.  The shiny holographic stamp
 on the card not only prevents counterfeiting, but stores a few
 megabytes of data about you as well [8].

    The Hoppian salesman waits until he thinks you're not looking, then
 straightens his bowtie and pulls back his ears, which, to his
 consternation, plop right back down into their usual cockeyed
 configuration.

>examine stamp
 The shiny holographic stamp on the card not only prevents
 counterfeiting, but stores a few megabytes of data about you as well
 [8].

    The Hoppian informs you that the Grandpa Jones apples are a new
 strain, genetically engineered by Barfee scientists only this year.

>ask hoppian about card
    "I'm afraid I don't know terribly much about that, friend," the
 Hoppian salesman says apologetically.

    A matronly Foonian salescreature watches you expectantly from behind

 however, and as such are appreciated in the Val system even though
 they're considered frighteningly rural by today's standards.

 Barfee Flower Warehouse

    You are standing at the entrance to the Barfee flower warehouse.
 You see Barfee employees giving away plastic daisies inside the
 warehouse -- perhaps that's why it's so crowded here.  The fact is that
 you couldn't fall down here if you tried -- you're crammed in like an
 olive in a bottle with all the rest of the would-be plastic daisy
 owners.  Actually getting inside the warehouse looks absolutely
 impossible.  Not only that, but you suspect that you'd be crushed to
 death even if you made it in.

    The warehouse itself is nondescript; it's just a big, long, gray
 building, about 100 feet tall.  Come to think of it, it looks a lot
 like a hangar; perhaps in days past it housed starships or
 intraplanetary craft [10].  You can't help wondering how flowers could
 possibly take up so much space.

    The only obvious way to travel is back to the west.

>fall down

 around -- you can't get anyone's attention.  Fortunately there's a
 vending machine of some kind right in front of you.  The vending
 machine is about twice your height, emerald green, and cylindrical.  A

 It's hard to say no to Akmi since they control half the galaxy's

 off on vacation and not come back for a month?  We had a Crog of a time
 getting those damn formulas of yours deciphered -- why don't you just
 use a computer like everyone else; no one but you can read your bird
 scratch!"  The researcher pauses for a moment, eyeing you with a chary,
 almost cold stare.  Perhaps he's not sure you're who he thinks you are.

    Realizing what this could mean, you start to panic, babbling in the
 process: "Well actually, I, ah, well, that is to say, there's been a
 bit of a mis-"

    "I don't believe this," he snarls, turning to the pilot, who has
 joined the two of you outside the ship.  "Hornweiler's got a can of
 Akmi Wundur Gro!  What's the big idea, Hornweiler?"

    "Well, I uh, I mean it's just a," you improvise badly.

    "Crog, Hornweiler, you were gonna put that in my prototype growth
 mix, weren't you?  You underhanded dirtbag!"  There is a tense silence.
 The pilot looks more than a bit puzzled.  You hold your breath, fearing
 that even the slightest twitch will set the bespectacled researcher
 off.  Suddenly, he erupts:  "I missed you, Hornweiler," he exclaims
 tearfully, hugging you hard and patting you on the back.  "The lab just
 hasn't been the same without you, you old huckster."

    "Don't blow it now, Gavin," you think to yourself.  "Well it sure
 feels good to be back, buddy," you say with as much feeling as you can
 muster.  "What's the latest news?"

    He chortles.  "Now don't try to suck up by calling me by my first
 name.  You're still in deep with the boss, and there's nothing I can do
 about that," Buddy taunts, elbowing you.  "Better save it for 'Hakkar
 the Horrible.'"

    You get the idea that Hakkar's the boss.

    With your reunion (or, in your case, greeting) completed, you and
 Buddy chat about the lab and the latest research findings; you realize
 the irony of your prediction that you'd never use anything you learned
 in your botany class again.  The pilot reminds you that he has a
 schedule to keep and that you could catch up on old times just as well
 elsewhere.  Taking the hint, the two of you climb back in the small
 craft, which then taxies through the thick crowd of onlookers and
 around to the rear of the warehouse.

    The back of the hangar-sized structure is blocked off; some cleverly
 positioned foliage prevents customers in the front from noticing either
 the high barbed-wire fence or the guard station you are waved through
 on the way to your eventual stopping point in front of a giant metal
 door in the center of the rear wall.

    Trying to look as natural as possible, you match Buddy's actions
 closely, paying rapt attention in case you're questioned later.  He
 places his hand on the keypad next to the door, and as he punches in
 the entrance code, you strain your eyes in an effort to burn every
 number into your already taxed neural network:  23, 46, 69, 812 ...  Oh
 no, you've missed the last number!  Hope you don't need it later...

    Buddy leads the way through the door as the pilot bids the two of
 you farewell, grumbling to himself about being late for the next run.
 "I'll meet you in the lab after you check in with Hakkar," Buddy says
 gleefully.  "Have fun," he chuckles as he trots off ahead of you into
 the laboratory down the hall, sealing the door behind him.  At least he
 means well.

 Barfee Research Area Entrance

    You're standing in an empty hall with metal walls, ceiling, and
 floor.  Behind you, to the south, is the vault door that leads to the
 outside; it does not appear to open from the inside.  Right in front of
 you, farther down the hall, is a smaller but equally durable-looking
 door with a sign on it that reads "Barfee Research Central."  There is
 another room to the west, and to the east is what you assume to be the

 opportunity to snap your head back before Hakkar sees you; he's quite
 preoccupied with thoroughly chastising an employee, and from the tone

 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a stunningly
 pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the air here
 that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>go east
 On a Dirt Road

    You're on the dirt road, now quite far from the matter mover.
 Tracks from some land vehicle begin here and lead east, around a bend,
 but the corn that lines the road blocks your view past the turn.  The
 matter mover is to the west.

    A flash of light near a moss-covered rock by the side of the road
 catches your eye.

>examine rock
 You spot a lost akmid half-covered by the rock, and pocket it.  Lucky
 day!

>examine akmid
    Nowadays you don't see these much, since everyone uses credit for
 their purchases.  It looks like this one has been nailed to a wall or
 something:  it's got a hole right through its center.


>note 13
 [13]: "Peace, freedom, and equality for all creatures."

>look
 On a Dirt Road

    You're on the dirt road, now quite far from the matter mover.
 Tracks from some land vehicle begin here and lead east, around a bend,
 but the corn that lines the road blocks your view past the turn.  The
 matter mover is to the west.

    A moss-covered rock lies by the side of the road.

>examine rock
 Though it looks completely everyday at first glance, a closer
 inspection reveals the rock to be a geode:  dull and unimpressive on
 the outside, but with a brilliant, sparkling crystalline center --
 absolutely beautiful!

 You pick up the rock.

 It's just typical Foonian corn.

 Outside "Elwood's Eats"

    A poorly painted sign nailed at an angle to the tiny building north
 of you reads, "Elwood's Eats."  Though the current lack of patronage
 might suggest otherwise, you suspect that the food served inside might
 actually be good, considering that you're literally surrounded by
 vegetation.

    The building looks like it's on the verge of collapse, and you're
 sure the roof might cave in at any second.  Still, it has a certain
 rustic charm, and you feel compelled to go inside.

    Tire tracks in the road lead up to the store from the west.  You can
 also head farther east down the road.

 There's no verb in that sentence!

>go inside
 Inside "Elwood's Eats"

    Oddly enough, no one seems to be minding the store; it really *must*
 be a slow day.  There are several aisles of food on ragged wooden
 shelves here, most of it standard household dry goods and canned items.
 There's also a counter behind which you expect the owner would normally
 be right now, and above which hangs a board with a menu and prices on
 it, given in oversized, green, poorly kerned magnetic letters.

    The store smells wonderfully earthy, and the floor and walls are all
 wooden, which adds to the homey feel -- this store definitely has
 character.  The only thing that looks out of place is a mechanical
 carnival game, which is off in one corner.  You notice with tremendous
 glee that it has no galacticard slot -- it only takes coins.  This part
 of the galaxy is so quaint!

 The game consists of a pile of kitschy stuff behind thick glass and a
 crane with a grabber on the end.  You steer the crane with a joystick
 mounted on the front panel.  If you're dextrous enough to snag one of
 the toys, you can move it over to the drop chute, via which it will
 slide out onto the floor.

 Most of the toys look like they're intended for small children, who are

 I don't know the word "grabber".

>examine crane
 The game consists of a pile of kitschy stuff behind thick glass and a
 crane with a grabber on the end.  You steer the crane with a joystick
 mounted on the front panel.  If you're dextrous enough to snag one of
 the toys, you can move it over to the drop chute, via which it will
 slide out onto the floor.

 Most of the toys look like they're intended for small children, who are
 presumably the only people naive enough to dump money into such a
 ludicrous contraption.

    A little display near the coin slot reads "CREDITS:  1."

 [14]: To play the game, enter the command "play game".

    Having never had any practise at this particular exercise, you fail
 miserably.  The crane swings about wildly as you struggle desperately
 to control it.  You hardly get the hang of opening and closing the
 grabber when your time is up.

    Too bad.  You have the feeling that if you just played a few more
 games you'd get good enough to grab some of the loot.

 Restored.

 Inside "Elwood's Eats"

    Oddly enough, no one seems to be minding the store; it really *must*
 be a slow day.  There are several aisles of food on ragged wooden
 shelves here, most of it standard household dry goods and canned items.
 There's also a counter behind which you expect the owner would normally
 be right now, and above which hangs a board with a menu and prices on
 it, given in oversized, green, poorly kerned magnetic letters.

    The store smells wonderfully earthy, and the floor and walls are all
 wooden, which adds to the homey feel -- this store definitely has
 character.  The only thing that looks out of place is a mechanical
 carnival game, which is off in one corner.  You notice with tremendous
 glee that it has no galacticard slot -- it only takes coins.  This part
 of the galaxy is so quaint!

 Outside "Elwood's Eats"

 On a Dirt Road, at a Puddle

    The road straightens here, with corn flanking both sides as before.
 To the east the road continues unchanged as far as the eye can see, but
 there's a store down the road to the west.

    There is a sizeable puddle right at your feet.

>jump in puddle

>splash

>examine puddle
    As you gaze into the puddle you look right beyond the plane of the

 now a pale-green canvas upon which hundreds of Foonian birds sail in
 sweeping arcs.

    The effect is striking; the adjacency of the close, muddy, mundane
 ground and the distant, reflected, exquisite sky creates an illusion
 that assaults your visual intuition.

 Okay, now in VERBOSE mode.
 Outside "Elwood's Eats"

    A poorly painted sign nailed at an angle to the tiny building north
 of you reads, "Elwood's Eats."  Though the current lack of patronage
 might suggest otherwise, you suspect that the food served inside might
 actually be good, considering that you're literally surrounded by
 vegetation.

    The building looks like it's on the verge of collapse, and you're
 sure the roof might cave in at any second.  Still, it has a certain
 rustic charm, and you feel compelled to go inside.

    Tire tracks in the road lead up to the store from the west.  You can
 also head farther east down the road.

>go west
 On a Dirt Road

    You're on the dirt road, now quite far from the matter mover.
 Tracks from some land vehicle begin here and lead east, around a bend,
 but the corn that lines the road blocks your view past the turn.  The
 matter mover is to the west.

>go west
 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a stunningly
 pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the air here
 that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>go west
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

>examine trees
 The trees are all at least 20 meters tall, and their trunks are
 immense.  Not being familiar with Foonian flora, you don't know what
 they're called, but suffice it to say that they're quite similar in
 appearance to the one's you're used to back home on Tode, except that
 the leaves are somewhat bluish.

>climb tree
 You can't climb the trees.

>examine house
 Why not get closer for a better look?

>go west
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends popular
 several hundred years ago, before the formation of the Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>note 14
 [14]: You always wondered if that architecture class you almost slept
 through would ever be of any use...  Though design ideas are fairly
 slow to propagate to Foon from Tode, Hop, and Tel, you don't imagine
 that even Foonian architects would still be using Cerquian school style
 beyond 1950VK.  That makes the house at least 208 years old (unless it
 was built during the brief Cerquian retro phase 20 years ago, which you
 doubt from the amount of wear on the exterior).

>go northwest
 At a Garden Outside the Farmhouse

    Here on the north side of the farmhouse is a large garden full of
 yummy-looking treats.  The soil has been recently tilled and smells
 wonderfully rich, and from the looks of it supports the vegetables
 planted in it far better than any Todian earth could.

    You've heard plenty of stories about the near-magical fertility of
 the Foonian soil, but this close-up demonstration really drives the
 point home.  The goodies here are all oversized and delicious-looking.
 You suspect that even you, with your limited gardening experience,
 could grow a prize plant on Foon.

    From here you can head either southeast, to the front of the
 farmhouse, or southwest, to the rear.

>take goodies
 Much as you'd like to, your moral upbringing prevents you from ripping
 off the Elwoods [15].

>enjoy architecture
 I don't know the word "enjoy".

>note 15
 [15]: I don't want to hear any complaining, by the way.

>examine goodies
 There are many different kinds.  All are bigger and tastier-looking
 than their Todian counterparts.  Actually, this is starting to make you
 feel hungry!

>go southwest
 Behind the Farmhouse

    You are standing on the grassy lawn behind the farmhouse.  The lawn
 is quite big by Todian standards, but is made to look rather
 insignificant by the vast expanse of crops that border it on all sides.
 It's times like these that you wish your folks didn't live in the city
 -- Tode's so crowded and noisy compared to places like this.  But then
 again, maybe Foon's a bit *too* rural...

    The farmhouse has a back door, but it doesn't look like it gets much
 use.  Given that, you suspect that the only ways to go from here are
 back around the house to the northeast and southeast.

    There is a little tombstone in the ground nearby.

>examine tombstone
 The tombstone is small, very roughly carved, and made of granite.  It
 looks to be hundreds of years old.  The weathered inscription on the
 tombstone reads:

    Pierre
    1975-1992
    Our faithful friend.
    Rest in peace.

 At the Tire Swing Outside the Farmhouse

    You have walked around to the south side of the farmhouse, and find
 yourself confronted with a giant oak-like tree [16].  The tree has a
 tire swing attached to it.

    From here you can head either northeast or northwest, towards the
 front and rear of the house, respectively.

>note 16
 [16]: "Oak-like" because you doubt it's the same variety of tree that
 you call an oak back home on Tode.

>examine swing
 The tire swing is on a sturdy rope tied to a thick branch in the
 oak-like tree high above.  Whoever put it up must have used one heck of
 a ladder.

 things can be dangerous, you know!

 a qualitative calculator, an RGB color chart, a full ReVoLT Kola can, a
 Galacticard, and a matter mover autodialer.

    Nowadays you don't see these much, since everyone uses credit for
 their purchases.  It looks like this one has been nailed to a wall or
 something:  it's got a hole right through its center.


>go west
 Inside the Farmhouse

    You're standing in the entrance hallway of the Elwood farmhouse.
 The hardwood floors creak as you walk upon them, and the earthy, rustic
 decor delights your jaded cosmopolitan senses.

    The front door is in the east wall.  Ahead, to the west, is the
 living room.

>examine decor
 The decor is charming.

>go west
 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

    The EV features a program that gives tips on how to use your
 C.A.M.E.L.  more effectively.

>examine ev
 unimpressive, particularly considering you've seen about ten thousand
 identical models before.  (Akmi sometimes has a hard time letting go
 once they've found a formula that works.)  It's orange, it's mauve,
 it's purple.  It's squat and has functionless dimples all over its
 irregularly shaped bulbous case.  The screen is nearly square and inset
 at a jaunty angle.  In short, a typical product of the Akmi Aesthetix
 Division [18].

    The EV has a tuning dial; you can choose from thousands of different
 stations from across the galaxy.  The dial goes from 1 to 100,000 and
 is currently set to 778.

    The EV features a program that gives tips on how to use your
 C.A.M.E.L.  more effectively.

>examine man
    The old man has typical Foonian features:  light green skin,
 wine-colored hair and thin, nearly horizontal eyebrows.  He is quite
 handsome but looks to have weathered a stormy life.

    You sense that he is very much alive, but he seems utterly comatose,
 clutching the EV's remote control with what remains of his life's
 energy, alone in a world of pictures and sounds from wherever,
 oblivious to you and this moment, the next, or the last.

    You look into those ebony Foonian eyes, searching for the man behind
 them, but see only the reflected images of the current program.  And
 there, in his eyes, you see them:  every pixel discrete; every one
 unique in the infrequent off-air snows, but each now a tiny player in a
 meticulously but mindlessly orchestrated ever-changing production --
 each with a role but none of any overall importance.

    You turn to look at the EV directly.  And conversely, there lies a
 reflection of the man.

 Kitchen

    You're in a fairly typical if slightly cramped kitchen.  Here you
 find the usual appliances:  a refrigerator, an oven with range top
 burners, and, on the counter, various food processing machines.  The
 cupboards appear to be well-stocked.

    The living room is to the north.

>examine refrigerator
    The refrigerator looks to be a model that was popular on Tode 75
 years ago.  It is functional but the aesthetics could use work -- it's
 just a basic white box; nothing at all like today's popular day-glo
 spherical models, and -- this is the good part -- you have to open it
 with the *handle*.  Unbelievable!

    The refrigerator is currently closed.

    The Akmi Slysor Dysor is a fearsome contraption.  With 33 different
 blades and 194 additional attachements, this thing is a vegetable's
 worst nightmare.

    Designed to be easy to use, the Dysor only has one setting -- "on".
 It uses patented Akmi Fuz-E Artyfishal Nooral Intellujince to determine
 the most appropriate action for the item you insert.  Unfortunately,
 the Dysors tend to prefer pureeing over all other options [19].

    It looks like an ordinary Akmi Slysor Dysor.  It is currently off.

    This narrow hall is similar to the one at the farmhouse entrance.  A

    It's an annoying but spirited pooch that looks much like the ones

 The can of Akmi Soopur Wundur Gro is bright orange, with mauve

 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

    The EV features a wretched and very badly dubbed drama involving
 short red creatures that look something like hamsters.

    You're in a fairly typical if slightly cramped kitchen.  Here you

>examine dysor
    The Akmi Slysor Dysor is a fearsome contraption.  With 33 different
 blades and 194 additional attachements, this thing is a vegetable's
 worst nightmare.

    Designed to be easy to use, the Dysor only has one setting -- "on".
 It uses patented Akmi Fuz-E Artyfishal Nooral Intellujince to determine
 the most appropriate action for the item you insert.  Unfortunately,
 the Dysors tend to prefer pureeing over all other options [19].

    It looks like an ordinary Akmi Slysor Dysor.  It is currently

 unimpressive, particularly considering you've seen about ten thousand
 identical models before.  (Akmi sometimes has a hard time letting go
 once they've found a formula that works.)  It's orange, it's mauve,
 it's purple.  It's squat and has functionless dimples all over its
 irregularly shaped bulbous case.  The screen is nearly square and inset
 at a jaunty angle.  In short, a typical product of the Akmi Aesthetix
 Division [18].

    The EV has a tuning dial; you can choose from thousands of different
 stations from across the galaxy.  The dial goes from 1 to 100,000 and
 is currently set to 778.

 clutching the EV's remote control with what remains of his life's
 energy, alone in a world of pictures and sounds from wherever,
 oblivious to you and this moment, the next, or the last.

    You look into those ebony Foonian eyes, searching for the man behind
 them, but see only the reflected images of the current program.  And
 there, in his eyes, you see them:  every pixel discrete; every one
 unique in the infrequent off-air snows, but each now a tiny player in a
 meticulously but mindlessly orchestrated ever-changing production --
 each with a role but none of any overall importance.

 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends popular
 several hundred years ago, before the formation of the Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

 At a Garden Outside the Farmhouse

    Here on the north side of the farmhouse is a large garden full of
 yummy-looking treats.  The soil has been recently tilled and smells
 wonderfully rich, and from the looks of it supports the vegetables
 planted in it far better than any Todian earth could.

    You've heard plenty of stories about the near-magical fertility of
 the Foonian soil, but this close-up demonstration really drives the
 point home.  The goodies here are all oversized and delicious-looking.
 You suspect that even you, with your limited gardening experience,
 could grow a prize plant on Foon.

    From here you can head either southeast, to the front of the
 farmhouse, or southwest, to the rear.

>examine dirt
 The garden is very impressive, with vegetables of all varieties.

>examine vegetables
 There are many different kinds.  All are bigger and tastier-looking
 than their Todian counterparts.  Actually, this is starting to make you

 off the Elwoods [15].

>go southwest
 Behind the Farmhouse

    You are standing on the grassy lawn behind the farmhouse.  The lawn
 is quite big by Todian standards, but is made to look rather
 insignificant by the vast expanse of crops that border it on all sides.
 It's times like these that you wish your folks didn't live in the city
 -- Tode's so crowded and noisy compared to places like this.  But then
 again, maybe Foon's a bit *too* rural...

    The farmhouse has a back door, but it doesn't look like it gets much
 use.  Given that, you suspect that the only ways to go from here are
 back around the house to the northeast and southeast.

    There is a little tombstone in the ground nearby.

>examine door
 The door is made of wood, and from the looks of it very old.  It
 doesn't look all that secure, but on the other hand it seems to be
 rusted shut, and you'd guess that it hasn't been opened in years.

>open door

 At the Tire Swing Outside the Farmhouse

    You have walked around to the south side of the farmhouse, and find
 yourself confronted with a giant oak-like tree [16].  The tree has a
 tire swing attached to it.

    From here you can head either northeast or northwest, towards the
 front and rear of the house, respectively.

>note 16
 [16]: "Oak-like" because you doubt it's the same variety of tree that
 you call an oak back home on Tode.

>examine tree

>climb it
 There are no branches low enough for you to grab onto.  There is,
 however, a rope tied to one branch.  You might try climbing up the
 rope.

>climb rope
 You pull yourself up with your arms and legs, and slowly reach the top.

 Up the Oak-Like Tree

    Your precarious perch high in the tree affords you a spectacular
 view of the surrounding environs.  You now see the tremendous expanse
 of crops on just Elwood Farm alone -- the land is a patchwork as far as
 the eye can see.

    You spot the dirt road leading up to the farmhouse; a store past a
 bend in the road; and the local matter mover, which doesn't seem to get
 much traffic.

    High above you, on a far away branch, is a little bird's nest.

    There is a poodle charm hanging from a nearby branch.

>examine charm
    It's a little gold charm shaped like a poodle.  It looks like it's
 quite old -- the edges are somewhat worn and it could use a good
 polishing.  The word "Pierre" is engraved on the back.

    There is a piece of string tied to the charm, making it into a
 simple necklace.

 Somehow I don't think untying the rope would be a good idea.  It's your

>look
 Up the Oak-Like Tree

    Your precarious perch high in the tree affords you a spectacular
 view of the surrounding environs.  You now see the tremendous expanse
 of crops on just Elwood Farm alone -- the land is a patchwork as far as
 the eye can see.

    You spot the dirt road leading up to the farmhouse; a store past a
 bend in the road; and the local matter mover, which doesn't seem to get
 much traffic.

    High above you, on a far away branch, is a little bird's nest.

>go up
 Think again; it's a long way down.

>examine store
 You can't tell much about it from here.

>examine farm
 There is nothing here matching that vocabulary that you can do that to.

>go down
 You slide down the rope, being careful not to get rope burns.

 At the Tire Swing Outside the Farmhouse

    You have walked around to the south side of the farmhouse, and find
 yourself confronted with a giant oak-like tree [16].  The tree has a
 tire swing attached to it.

    From here you can head either northeast or northwest, towards the
 front and rear of the house, respectively.

>examine tire
 It's just an ordinary tire.  It's very worn; so much so that the
 manufacturer's name isn't legible anymore.

 You're now sitting in the tire swing.

 You get a little momentum going and swing around in a wide circle.
 There's not enough room to really get going though, and besides that
 you're afraid you might crash into the farmhouse or the tree.  These
 things can be dangerous, you know!

>go northeast
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends popular
 several hundred years ago, before the formation of the Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>go east
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

>examine corn
 It's just typical Foonian corn.

>examine sign
 The sign says, "Elwood Farm."

>examine trees
 The trees are all at least 20 meters tall, and their trunks are
 immense.  Not being familiar with Foonian flora, you don't know what
 they're called, but suffice it to say that they're quite similar in
 appearance to the one's you're used to back home on Tode, except that
 the leaves are somewhat bluish.

>climb trees
 You can't climb the trees.

>examine leaves
 The leaves look normal, except that they're bluish.

>take leaf
 You can't take the tree leaves.

>count leaves
 You see one (1) tree leaves.

>take corn
 You can't take the corn.

>go east
 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a stunningly
 pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the air here
 that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>go east
 On a Dirt Road

    You're on the dirt road, now quite far from the matter mover.
 Tracks from some land vehicle begin here and lead east, around a bend,
 but the corn that lines the road blocks your view past the turn.  The
 matter mover is to the west.

>go east
 Outside "Elwood's Eats"

    A poorly painted sign nailed at an angle to the tiny building north
 of you reads, "Elwood's Eats."  Though the current lack of patronage
 might suggest otherwise, you suspect that the food served inside might
 actually be good, considering that you're literally surrounded by
 vegetation.

    The building looks like it's on the verge of collapse, and you're
 sure the roof might cave in at any second.  Still, it has a certain
 rustic charm, and you feel compelled to go inside.

    Tire tracks in the road lead up to the store from the west.  You can
 also head farther east down the road.

>in
 Inside "Elwood's Eats"

    Oddly enough, no one seems to be minding the store; it really *must*
 be a slow day.  There are several aisles of food on ragged wooden
 shelves here, most of it standard household dry goods and canned items.
 There's also a counter behind which you expect the owner would normally
 be right now, and above which hangs a board with a menu and prices on
 it, given in oversized, green, poorly kerned magnetic letters.

    The store smells wonderfully earthy, and the floor and walls are all
 wooden, which adds to the homey feel -- this store definitely has
 character.  The only thing that looks out of place is a mechanical
 carnival game, which is off in one corner.  You notice with tremendous
 glee that it has no galacticard slot -- it only takes coins.  This part
 of the galaxy is so quaint!

 You snicker to yourself maniacally as you drop the coin in the slot.
 The machine burbles a bit and then chimes as it registers a credit.
 You grab the string and carefully pull the coin back out of the

 *** Your score just went up by 4 points.  ***

    A little display near the coin slot reads "CREDITS:  1."

>play game
    Having never had any practise at this particular exercise, you fail
 miserably.  The crane swings about wildly as you struggle desperately
 to control it.  You hardly get the hang of opening and closing the
 grabber when your time is up.

    Too bad.  You have the feeling that if you just played a few more
 games you'd get good enough to grab some of the loot.

 planted in it far better than any Todian earth could.

    You've heard plenty of stories about the near-magical fertility of
 the Foonian soil, but this close-up demonstration really drives the
 point home.  The goodies here are all oversized and delicious-looking.

 -- Tode's so crowded and noisy compared to places like this.  But then
 again, maybe Foon's a bit *too* rural...

    The farmhouse has a back door, but it doesn't look like it gets much
 use.  Given that, you suspect that the only ways to go from here are
 back around the house to the northeast and southeast.

 Behind the Farmhouse

    You are standing on the grassy lawn behind the farmhouse.  The lawn
 is quite big by Todian standards, but is made to look rather
 insignificant by the vast expanse of crops that border it on all sides.
 It's times like these that you wish your folks didn't live in the city
 -- Tode's so crowded and noisy compared to places like this.  But then
 again, maybe Foon's a bit *too* rural...

    The farmhouse has a back door, but it doesn't look like it gets much
 use.  Given that, you suspect that the only ways to go from here are
 back around the house to the northeast and southeast.

    There is a little tombstone in the ground nearby.

>go east
 No way; at least not with the door shut like that.

>go northeast
 At a Garden Outside the Farmhouse

    Here on the north side of the farmhouse is a large garden full of
 yummy-looking treats.  The soil has been recently tilled and smells
 wonderfully rich, and from the looks of it supports the vegetables
 planted in it far better than any Todian earth could.

    You've heard plenty of stories about the near-magical fertility of
 the Foonian soil, but this close-up demonstration really drives the
 point home.  The goodies here are all oversized and delicious-looking.
 You suspect that even you, with your limited gardening experience,
 could grow a prize plant on Foon.

    From here you can head either southeast, to the front of the
 farmhouse, or southwest, to the rear.

 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends popular
 several hundred years ago, before the formation of the Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>go west
 Inside the Farmhouse

    You're standing in the entrance hallway of the Elwood farmhouse.
 The hardwood floors creak as you walk upon them, and the earthy, rustic
 decor delights your jaded cosmopolitan senses.

 living room.

>go west
 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

    The EV's picking up some of that dreadful SofToonz, Akmi's lame
 excuse for music, complete with pictures of serene landscapes and moire
 patterns.  They pipe this kind of drivel into buildings throughout the
 galaxy because it's been found to excite fewer species than any other
 kind of stimulation [21].

>go west
 Hall

    This narrow hall is similar to the one at the farmhouse entrance.  A
 wooden staircase leads up from here; unfortunately, it also leads up to
 a protective-looking dog who is currently barking his head off at you.

    At the end of the hall, further west, is the back door.  It looks
 like it's been sealed shut.

>give dog charm

>give charm to dog
 The animal shows no interest whatsoever.  It doesn't exactly give you

 pretty disgusting.

 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

>go east
 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a stunningly
 pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the air here
 that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

 around...

 Featureless Cubicle

    It's clear from the size and lack of decor that this room was built

 Barfee Research Area Entrance

    You're standing in an empty hall with metal walls, ceiling, and

 outside; it does not appear to open from the inside.  Right in front of
 you, farther down the hall, is a smaller but equally durable-looking
 door with a sign on it that reads "Barfee Research Central."  There is
 another room to the west, and to the east is what you assume to be the
 check-in area; you suspect that's where the boss is; this suspicion is
 partly affirmed by the growling and cursing emanating from within.

 Barfee Research Lab

    You are in a huge, well-stocked laboratory.  Dozens of researchers
 scurry about, argue with each other, and frequently set things ablaze.
 Aside from the usual lab equipment, there is a strange-looking machine
 on an especially large marble lab table that stands in the center of
 the lab.

    The only way out of this arena is south, the way you came in.

>examine machine
 It's just a big plaid box made of some synthetic cheese product that

    The northern area of this arena seems to be devoted to vegetable

 large bin filled with seed packets.  There are so many shoppers here

    The tall and dapper Hoppian salesman tends to the bin in front of

 configuration.

 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Your bachelor pod


    Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

    Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

    Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds of
 light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for them to
 put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts of the
 galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod is
 situated on.

    On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you use
 nearly 37 hours a day.  Cuddled up right next to it like a best friend
 is your EV.

    The EV is tuned to Hot Hits 1000, the "newest, coolest, most
 outrageous" music video station.  Yep, it's pop, 37 hours a day.  Right
 now you see the video for "Surf, Surf, Surf that Wormhole," by Rad
 Doodz.

>examine mover
    Matter mover technology hit the scene in 2062VK, just two years
 before the formation of the Republic.  In the hundred or so years since
 its introduction it's become the primary means of transportation
 throughout the galaxy.  In fact, it's usually the only exit provided in
 private dwellings like the one you're currently in [22].

    Your machine is a roughly person-sized jet black capsule.  Bigger
 ones exist for transporting goods and larger creatures; yours is a
 typical domestic model, if a bit on the cheap side.  Simply entering
 the matter mover will activate it.

    As is typical, this matter mover has three dials, color coded red,
 green, and blue.  You set each dial to a number between 0 and 10,000,
 and together the three numbers comprise the receiving station's address
 [23].  To transport, the receiver must first grant permission to the
 sender, otherwise the transmission is prohibited.  Many public
 institutions allow access from all sources; private dwelling movers
 usually only allow calls from specific individuals or addresses.

 Your pod's address is written on the machine:

    "6000, 3270, 1736 -- colorspace Burnt Sienna"

 Current dial settings:  (10000, 7470, 1000)

>enter mover
 A polite female voice says, "Your move cannot be completed as dialed.
 Please check the number and dial again, and make sure your receiving
 party has granted you permission to access their mover.  If you need
 assistance, please contact the operator for your local colorspace.
 Thank you."

>examine autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod

 Ada's pod

    You are in your true love Ada's pod.  It's quite similar to your
 own, but isn't nearly as messy.  Ada seems to have gone off and left
 saving the galaxy to you alone [6].

    On the EV, Progressive 52109 is playing the music video for "Value
 Added S E X," by The Infirmed.

>examine hatch
 After some searching, you find the pod's escape hatch buried under a
 pile of papers.  It looks like an airlock; all metal, with a big
 wheel-shaped lever on it that appears to be keeping it well-sealed.

>SAVE
>cf15
 Saved.

>open hatch
 Grabbing the steering wheel shaped latch, you pull with every bit of
 strength your muscles can muster.  Just when you're about to lose hope,
 the seal gives a little and you begin to make progress.  Moments later
 you're looking down into the dark metal corridor below.

 *** Your score just went up by a point.  ***

>go down
 You squeeze through the hatch and scramble down the metal ladder
 leading up to it.

 Metal Corridor Under Ada's Pod

    You're in a narrow but otherwise nondescript metal corridor leading
 east and west.  You see a ladder leading up to Ada's pod.

>go west
 Red and Green Corridor

    The narrow east-west hallway continues through here with but one
 feature changed:  the walls and floor are covered with red and green
 splotches.  Oh yes, and the walls appear to be somewhat chewed up.

    You can see a ladder leading up to Ada's pod to the east, and what
 appears to be a landing/launching bay of some kind to the west.

    A hideous Zdybel blocks your way west!

    "Tabeyoo?  Tabeyoo?"  the Zdybel seems to ask.

>tabeyoo
 I don't know the word "tabeyoo".

>say tabeyoo
 I don't know the word "tabeyoo".

>examine zdybel
 The Zdybel are widely regarded as the most disgusting vermin in the
 known universe.  They combine the worst elements of all the vilest
 creatures into a single emetic rodent:  rat-like features; body odor
 like carrion; slimy, matted fur that drips some revolting and
 (thankfully) unidentifiable bodily fluid; voracious appetite; and the
 eating habits of flies.  This particular specimen is a giant, and
 judging from the constant flow of saliva from the tips of its
 razor-sharp buck teeth into ever-growing pools on the ground, I'd say
 it's hungry [24].

    "What do you think I heard the story of Igdoof sitting on?"  the
 Zdybel gibbers.

>note 24
 [24]: Worst of all, they're mimics.  They constantly babble
 pseudo-language, even when nothing's around to hear them.  After a
 great infestation of Zdybel on Tel in 2112VK, a tremendous amount of
 time and money was invested in the complete eradication of the species.
 This was almost entirely successful, yet a few Zdybel remain scattered
 across the galaxy, presumably having survived the years hidden in cargo
 ships, air ducts, and the like.  They are thought to have originated on
 nearby planet Irata.

    The Zdybel threatens you with a nasty claw.  "Psssst!  Lunch!
 Lunch!  Exoculating lunch!"  it raves.

 At an Air Duct Grating

    You have crawled to the end of an east-west metal corridor and are
 now looking through a grating into what appears to be an air duct.  It
 is very dusty here.  The grating is made of metal and is thickly caked
 with dust and grime.  It's held firmly in place by a screw in each
 corner.

 The Bedzyl is a tiny mouse-like creature that seems to be friendly but
 very afraid of you, which is understandable since you're about 100

    The Bedzyl seems eager to play with you, but not entirely sure that

 is the most powerful stimulant available without a prescription.
 You've probably taken years off your life with this toxic elixir.

 Escape Pod Docking Bay

    The metal corridor widens into a large open area here, where you can
 see several escape pod landing/launching bays in the western wall.  The
 pods are, you assume, meant for use during emergencies when the matter
 movers are down or unsafe.  At the moment all the pods but one are
 gone, and through the glass guarding the empty bays you can see an
 incredible spectacle:  absolute blackness streaked with dusty plumes,
 like the frozen crests of breaking waves, and textured with varying
 densities of white-bright points that create a fantastic continuum of
 grays.  And, you reflect for a moment, only a few centimeters of clear
 glass separate you from what feels like the whole of creation.

    A metal corridor leads east.

>examine pod
 The one remaining escape pod sits quietly in its bay, evidently ready
 for launch.  It fits snugly in the circular hole in the wall designed
 for it, and hence you can only tell that it's roughly spherical and has
 a person-sized entrance at floor level for boarding.

>enter pod
 You step inside the escape pod...

 Inside the Escape Pod

    You are standing inside the escape pod.  The interior is spartan,
 lacking even seats and tables, and it's barely big enough to hold
 several people.  The only control seems to be a big red button marked
 "LAUNCH."

    The top and front of the spherical pod are made of glass.  This
 affords you a spectacular view of space.

>press button
 Which button do you mean, the Clear button, the Clear button, the ZERO
 button, the POSITIVE button, the NEGATIVE button, the ADD button, the
 SUBTRACT button, the MULTIPLY button, the DIVIDE button, or the launch
 button?

>press red button
 This would probably be a good time to save the game.

>yes
>legend-launch
 Saved.

 The escape pod's engines spring to life!  You are thrown against the
 now-closed metal entrance door as the craft rockets away from the
 Yooniversity Dwelling Site and into space on an unknown (to you, at
 least) course.  You can see the tiny blue planet Frost disappear in the
 distance as you look through the top of the spinning pod.

    The course correction jets kick in, and the pod stops spinning about
 wildly. You regain your balance.

>examine planet
 You don't see anything matching that vocabulary here.

>examine glass
 The top and front of the spherical pod are made of glass.  This affords
 you a spectacular view of space.

    The engines really begin to roar as the pod accelerates.

>look through glass
 Looking through the glass canopy rewards you with a spectacular view of
 space.

>examine door
 There is nothing here matching that vocabulary that you can do that to.

>wait
 Time passes...

    The pod quiets some as it reaches what is presumably cruising
 velocity.

>wait
 Time passes...

    The light is nearly blinding as the pod briefly turns toward Val,
 the star that has warmed the homeworld Tode and the other populated
 planets in this system for millennia.

>wait
 Time passes...

>examine val
 I don't know the word "val".

>wait
 Time passes...

    Far in the distance you see a tiny orange dot, just larger than a
 star.  It grows bigger and bigger -- you seem to be headed straight for
 it.

>wait
 Time passes...

    Moments later, the dot has become a fist-sized ball.  You are
 approaching it at an incredible speed.

>wait
 Time passes...

    A giant orange sphere now fills your entire view.  You're about to
 crash land on a distant planet!

>wait
 Time passes...

    Your little craft plunges through the orange planet's atmosphere and
 hurtles towards the ground below.  Cabin heat becomes nearly unbearable
 as you decelerate, and you're being thrown about like a pet's chew toy.

>wait
 Time passes...

    Though the pod is slowing down at an almost alarming rate, the
 ground is still approaching faster than you can believe.  This looks
 like the end!

    A formerly invisible readout next to the launch button flashes,
 "Standby to land on the planet Irata."

>wait
 Time passes...

    The pod plunges through a dense forest of blue-green trees.  You
 cover your eyes and hope for the best.  Miraculously, you survive
 unscathed, though quite dizzy and a bit queasy from the hundred or so
 barrel rolls the pod must have made once it touched down.  The door
 slides open silently.

>out
 You clamber out of the escape pod...

 Outside the Escape Pod Wreckage

    You are in the middle of a clearing at the site of your crash
 landing.  The escape pod lies to the north, and is still intact, though
 very badly damaged.

    Dense forest surrounds this little area, though it looks like you
 might be able to make some progress through the woods to the east,
 northwest, and south. Passage along other routes looks very unlikely.

>examine pod
 The escape pod is in bad shape -- it's a wonder you survived the
 landing.  The once spherical craft is now flat on one side, the metal
 crumpled up like tin foil.

>search it
 The escape pod is in bad shape -- it's a wonder you survived the

 The forest is all around you.  The trees here have grown strangely
 close together.

>go east
 Another Crash Site

    You're standing amidst the wreckage of another spaceship.  Not much
 remains of the vessel -- there are chunks of twisted metal everywhere.

    As you survey the area looking for signs of life, you hear something
 moving in the forest nearby.  Just as you turn toward the source of the
 noise, you see a tall, skinny fellow with long hair tumbling out of a
 tree and onto the ground.  You rush over to see if he's all right.

    The young man looks up at you through a pain-induced squint, holding
 his head and groaning.  "Whoa..."  he says, "What happened?"

    "Looks like you crashed," you say.

    Upon hearing this, he looks absolutely terrified.  "Oh no!"  the man
 cries, and he begins desperately searching through the remains of the
 tattered ship.

    Moments later, he pulls a bright red object out from under a
 collapsed support beam and breathes a sigh of relief.  "If I'd lost
 those patches that would've *really* sucked," he explains, pointing to
 his undamaged portable SoundSquasher X-1000 [25].  He looks familiar,
 somehow.

    "Timon Sketch," he says.  "Pleased to meet you."

    Over the course of the next hour you exchange recent history with
 Timon.  You find out that he headlines a rock band called "The
 Hoi-Polloi" and that they recently decided to switch to another label.
 He suspects that they sabotaged his ship since they just signed the new
 contract hours before his crash:

    "The Muse people were real pissed that we ditched 'em for Shock
 Sounds, 'cause they lost Rad Doodz at the same time -- we hang with
 them, y'know, and we kind of all decided to pop Muse at the same time
 to make the statement.  Then we sign and that psychobitch running Muse
 starts gettin' all up in my face and tellin' me I better drive safe so
 I don't have a 'little accident.'"  He looks up at the sky.  "Nice try,
 loser, I didn't even lose my latest tune!"

    One thing you both definitely have in common is your need for
 transport off the planet.  You agree to search the area together in
 hopes of finding a way back.

    Over the next few hours you tell Timon Sketch about the Unnkulian
 menace and what it may mean for the fate of the universe.  He seems
 generally unconvinced but still concerned that he won't be able to
 write any more tunes, and urges you to contact his "friend" The
 Watchmaker.

    "Watch is a total psycho-genius freak -- infobroker -- wants to rule
 the world through an AkNet jack but will settle for just the underworld
 for now.  Don't get on the wrong side of Watch's blaster -- people die
 when that happens. Lots of people.  Hey, but Watch is real nice at
 heart, and sure as hell the only person I know who would have any goods
 on Akmi.  Nobody sane fucks with Akmi.  Try to step to them and you're
 squashed like a grape.

    He pauses, perhaps considering the concept.  "Yeah.  Like a
 *grape*."  As he shakes his head, his long hair moves forward en masse
 to obscure his face.  This man with the hidden face then hands you what
 appears to be a triangular pink circuit board and tells you to give it
 to the bouncer at The Watchmen.  He brushes his hair back.  He is still
 nodding.

    As you turn the oddly-shaped device over in your hand to examine it,
 he begins to hum and then sing a wandering, unearthly melody:

        Try to rush from the tomb,
        Try to hurry from the grave,
        But you and your dreams will die,
        In the Watch.
        Wriggle all you like,
        But the Watch will get you just the same.
        The Watch is always ticking.

 ***

    You're walking about a small clearing amidst the wreckage of Timon
 Sketch's ship.  Dense forest surrounds you on all sides.  It looks like
 you might be able to beat a path through the foliage to the north and
 south.  Head west and you're back at your own crash site.

    Timon Sketch starts and stops playing the same melody a dozen times,
 then smashes all the keys down in a frustrated frenzy.

>examine timon
 Timon Sketch is a wiry fellow with long hair that seems to have a mind
 of its own.  From the looks of it, he often becomes totally absorbed in
 playing his synthesizer, thereby remaining oblivious to the world
 around him.

>note 25
 [25]: SoundSquasher's synthesizers are widely regarded as the best.
 The new X-1000 model features a Neutrino Overdrive/Inhibitor
 Synthesizer-Effector, the latest and greatest sound-modifying gizmo.

>punch timon
 There's no reason to get huffy!

>examine board
 You can't tell exactly what it is, but you figure that it must store
 some kind of information.  There are mover coordinates on the back of
 the device:

    Midnight Blue (+30, -47, +24)

>examine pod
 There is nothing here matching that vocabulary that you can do that to.

>examine metal
 It's just an ordinary frying pan.

>go north
 You fight your way through the forest up a steep slope.  After a long
 struggle, you find yourself...


 (Timon Sketch follows you.)

 Atop a Cliff

    This place is well worth the trouble it took to get here.  Your spot
 atop this steep cliff affords you a panoramic view of the land all
 around.  Directly in front of you, to the north, is a 500 meter drop
 down to a thick forest canopy that continues to the horizon
 undisturbed.  Do be careful.

    To the south are the crash sites, and you notice a tiny building in
 the woods to the east of Sketch's ship.

    Farther south is what looks to be an agricultural and mining complex
 of some kind, with a fence running all around the perimeter.

    The cliff continues to the northwest and southeast, but you'd have
 to have climbing gear to survive passage along it -- this whole region
 is covered with rocks of all sizes and you barely made it this far
 without breaking a leg.

    You see a clearing to the southwest, on this side of the cliff.  A
 path north through the trees leads from the tiny clearing to a small
 tower.  Atop the tower is a blinking red light.

    Looks like the only way out of here is to the south, the way you
 came.

    Timon Sketch plays the chorus of "You Suck."

>examine building
 From here you can only tell that it's some kind of small dwelling --
 perhaps a shack.

>examine tower
 You'll need to get closer to see more.

>examine cliff
 It looks like an ordinary cliff.

>push timon down cliff
 I don't recognize that sentence.

 (Timon Sketch follows you.)

 CAMELs at Work

 at work in the fields.  Most seem to going about agricultural tasks,
 but some have giant solar collectors on them.

    There is no obvious way to proceed beyond the fence.

    Timon Sketch mutters about new song ideas.

>note 26
 [26]: The first Compact All-Purpose Mobile Electronic Laborer was
 developed by Andi Bunnet over 150 years ago, and many of the earliest
 models are still in used today.  CAMELs are robots with the simple AI
 required to perform agricultural and mining tasks.  Much cheaper than
 human-operated heavy machinery, the CAMELs work harder and faster than
 any human team could.

 In a Small Clearing

    You are standing in a small clearing in the middle of a dense
 forest.  The tall grass here tickles your ankles and sways in a light
 breeze.  A dirt road leads north.  Passage through the forest looks
 difficult, but you could probably make your way south.  You can also
 head southeast, back to where you crash landed earlier.

    A fearsome Dylbez blocks your way north!

    Timon Sketch presses a button and his synthesizer makes an awful
 squawking noise.  He mashes down a lot of the keys and it stops.

    The Dylbez snorts.

>examine dylbez
    The Dylbez is a fearsome beast, three times as tall as a man and
 stronger than twenty.  These giant two-headed bears are found only on
 Irata, and with good reason:  no one has ever been able to capture one
 and leave Irata alive.

    The Dylbez attacks swiftly and viciously, by grabbing its victim
 with its powerful claws and then hugging it to death.  Don't mess with
 this fellow, OK?

    The Dylbez comes a step closer to you.

>shoot dylbez with ung
 Dylbez is transformed into a horrible Zdybel!

    The Zdybel sings a lyric:  "What a Noooooble man was Strickland..."

>shoot zdybel with ung
 Zdybel is transformed into a fearsome Dylbez!

    The Dylbez bumps its heads together and grimaces.

    "To be..."  the Zdybel says dramatically, "or to ben't."

 At a Tall Fence

    Your way south is blocked by a very tall fence.  You notice a loud
 humming sound here.  It seems to be coming from the fence.

 You can't do that, because something tells you the portable

>examine synthesizer
    The SoundSquasher X-1000 is the very latest in a long line of fine
 SoundSquasher products.  Brett Simpkin built the first SoundSquasher in
 his garage 34 years ago out of hubcaps and audion capacitors pirated
 from intra-planetary navigation beacons.  After the 5th major ship
 disaster, Simpkin was arrested, an event that propelled the
 SoundSquasher to galaxy-wide success.

 In a Small Clearing

    You are standing in a small clearing in the middle of a dense
 forest.  The tall grass here tickles your ankles and sways in a light
 breeze.  A dirt road leads north.  Passage through the forest looks
 difficult, but you could probably make your way south.  You can also
 head southeast, back to where you crash landed earlier.

    A ferocious Zdybel blocks your way north!

    Timon Sketch plays a few bars of the classic tune "Aerobics."

 Red and Green Corridor

    The narrow east-west hallway continues through here with but one
 feature changed:  the walls and floor are covered with red and green
 splotches.  Oh yes, and the walls appear to be somewhat chewed up.

    You can see a ladder leading up to Ada's pod to the east, and what
 appears to be a landing/launching bay of some kind to the west.

    There is a little Bedzyl here, scurrying about cheerfully.

 Escape Pod Docking Bay

    The metal corridor widens into a large open area here, where you
 can see several escape pod landing/launching bays in the western wall.
 The pods are, you assume, meant for use during emergencies when the
 matter movers are down or unsafe.  At the moment all the pods but one
 are gone, and through the glass guarding the empty bays you can see an
 incredible spectacle:  absolute blackness streaked with dusty plumes,
 like the frozen crests of breaking waves, and textured with varying
 densities of white-bright points that create a fantastic continuum of
 grays.  And, you reflect for a moment, only a few centimeters of clear
 glass separate you from what feels like the whole of creation.

    A metal corridor leads east.

>enter pod
 You step inside the escape pod...

 Inside the Escape Pod

    You are standing inside the escape pod.  The interior is spartan,
 lacking even seats and tables, and it's barely big enough to hold
 several people.  The only control seems to be a big red button marked
 "LAUNCH."

    The top and front of the spherical pod are made of glass.  This
 affords you a spectacular view of space.

>press red button
 This would probably be a good time to save the game.

>yes
>greatidea
 Saved.

 The escape pod's engines spring to life!  You are thrown against the
 now-closed metal entrance door as the craft rockets away from the
 Yooniversity Dwelling Site and into space on an unknown (to you, at
 least) course.  You can see the tiny blue planet Frost disappear in
 the distance as you look through the top of the spinning pod.

    The course correction jets kick in, and the pod stops spinning
 about wildly. You regain your balance.

>z.z.z.z.z
 Time passes...

    The engines really begin to roar as the pod accelerates.

 Time passes...

 Time passes...

    The pod quiets some as it reaches what is presumably cruising
 velocity.

    The light is nearly blinding as the pod briefly turns toward Val,
 the star that has warmed the homeworld Tode and the other populated
 planets in this system for millennia.

 Time passes...

>z.z.z.z
 Time passes...

    Far in the distance you see a tiny orange dot, just larger than a
 star.  It grows bigger and bigger -- you seem to be headed straight
 for it.

 Time passes...

    Moments later, the dot has become a fist-sized ball.  You are
 approaching it at an incredible speed.

 Time passes...

    A giant orange sphere now fills your entire view.  You're about to
 crash land on a distant planet!

 Time passes...

    Your little craft plunges through the orange planet's atmosphere
 and hurtles towards the ground below.  Cabin heat becomes nearly
 unbearable as you decelerate, and you're being thrown about like a
 pet's chew toy.

>wait
 Time passes...

    Though the pod is slowing down at an almost alarming rate, the
 ground is still approaching faster than you can believe.  This looks
 like the end!

    A formerly invisible readout next to the launch button flashes,
 "Standby to land on the planet Irata."

>wait
 Time passes...

    The pod plunges through a dense forest of blue-green trees.  You
 cover your eyes and hope for the best.  Miraculously, you survive
 unscathed, though quite dizzy and a bit queasy from the hundred or so
 barrel rolls the pod must have made once it touched down.  The door
 slides open silently.

>wait
 Time passes...

>out
 You clamber out of the escape pod...

 Outside the Escape Pod Wreckage

    You are in the middle of a clearing at the site of your crash
 landing.  The escape pod lies to the north, and is still intact,
 though very badly damaged.

    Dense forest surrounds this little area, though it looks like you
 might be able to make some progress through the woods to the east,
 northwest, and south. Passage along other routes looks very unlikely.

>go east
 Another Crash Site

    You're standing amidst the wreckage of another spaceship.  Not much
 remains of the vessel -- there are chunks of twisted metal everywhere.

    As you survey the area looking for signs of life, you hear
 something moving in the forest nearby.  Just as you turn toward the
 source of the noise, you see a tall, skinny fellow with long hair
 tumbling out of a tree and onto the ground.  You rush over to see if
 he's all right.

    The young man looks up at you through a pain-induced squint,
 holding his head and groaning.  "Whoa..."  he says, "What happened?"

    "Looks like you crashed," you say.

    Upon hearing this, he looks absolutely terrified.  "Oh no!"  the
 man cries, and he begins desperately searching through the remains of
 the tattered ship.

    Moments later, he pulls a bright red object out from under a
 collapsed support beam and breathes a sigh of relief.  "If I'd lost
 those patches that would've *really* sucked," he explains, pointing to
 his undamaged portable SoundSquasher X-1000 [25].  He looks familiar,
 somehow.

    "Timon Sketch," he says.  "Pleased to meet you."

    Over the course of the next hour you exchange recent history with
 Timon.  You find out that he headlines a rock band called "The
 Hoi-Polloi" and that they recently decided to switch to another label.
 He suspects that they sabotaged his ship since they just signed the
 new contract hours before his crash:

    "The Muse people were real pissed that we ditched 'em for Shock
 Sounds, 'cause they lost Rad Doodz at the same time -- we hang with
 them, y'know, and we kind of all decided to pop Muse at the same time
 to make the statement.  Then we sign and that psychobitch running Muse
 starts gettin' all up in my face and tellin' me I better drive safe so
 I don't have a 'little accident.'"  He looks up at the sky.  "Nice
 try, loser, I didn't even lose my latest tune!"

    One thing you both definitely have in common is your need for
 transport off the planet.  You agree to search the area together in
 hopes of finding a way back.

    Over the next few hours you tell Timon Sketch about the Unnkulian
 menace and what it may mean for the fate of the universe.  He seems
 generally unconvinced but still concerned that he won't be able to
 write any more tunes, and urges you to contact his "friend" The
 Watchmaker.

    "Watch is a total psycho-genius freak -- infobroker -- wants to
 rule the world through an AkNet jack but will settle for just the
 underworld for now.  Don't get on the wrong side of Watch's blaster --
 people die when that happens. Lots of people.  Hey, but Watch is real
 nice at heart, and sure as hell the only person I know who would have
 any goods on Akmi.  Nobody sane fucks with Akmi.  Try to step to them
 and you're squashed like a grape.

    He pauses, perhaps considering the concept.  "Yeah.  Like a
 *grape*."  As he shakes his head, his long hair moves forward en masse
 to obscure his face.  This man with the hidden face then hands you
 what appears to be a triangular pink circuit board and tells you to
 give it to the bouncer at The Watchmen.  He brushes his hair back.  He
 is still nodding.

    As you turn the oddly-shaped device over in your hand to examine
 it, he begins to hum and then sing a wandering, unearthly melody:

        Try to rush from the tomb,
        Try to hurry from the grave,
        But you and your dreams will die,
        In the Watch.
        Wriggle all you like,
        But the Watch will get you just the same.
        The Watch is always ticking.

 ***

    You're walking about a small clearing amidst the wreckage of Timon
 Sketch's ship.  Dense forest surrounds you on all sides.  It looks
 like you might be able to beat a path through the foliage to the north
 and south.  Head west and you're back at your own crash site.

    Timon Sketch plays the chorus of "I Suck."

>examine device
 You can't tell exactly what it is, but you figure that it must store
 some kind of information.  There are mover coordinates on the back of

>go north
 You fight your way through the forest up a steep slope.  After a long
 struggle, you find yourself...


 (Timon Sketch follows you.)

 Atop a Cliff

    This place is well worth the trouble it took to get here.  Your
 spot atop this steep cliff affords you a panoramic view of the land
 all around.  Directly in front of you, to the north, is a 500 meter
 drop down to a thick forest canopy that continues to the horizon
 undisturbed.  Do be careful.

    To the south are the crash sites, and you notice a tiny building in
 the woods to the east of Sketch's ship.

    Farther south is what looks to be an agricultural and mining
 complex of some kind, with a fence running all around the perimeter.

    The cliff continues to the northwest and southeast, but you'd have
 to have climbing gear to survive passage along it -- this whole region
 is covered with rocks of all sizes and you barely made it this far
 without breaking a leg.

    You see a clearing to the southwest, on this side of the cliff.  A
 path north through the trees leads from the tiny clearing to a small
 tower.  Atop the tower is a blinking red light.

    Looks like the only way out of here is to the south, the way you
 came.

    Timon Sketch is here, playing a mind-numbing tuba solo on his
 SoundSquasher X-1000.

 Inside Shack

    You're in a tiny room in a little shack.  There's a desk and a
 chair here, but the room is otherwise bare.  The only exit is out the
 door, to the west.

    Timon Sketch urges you to sell your digital Melodiwafer-based
 stereo system and buy an antique turntable.  "Analog sound is so much
 more palpable," he says.  A dog-eared leaflet is on the desk.

 [26]: The planet Kuwl was colonized by the Duhdhists soon after
 interplanetary travel became possible.  To this day it is mainly
 inhabited by zealous followers of Duhdha, although things have gotten
 a bit commercialized since the colony's humble beginnings.

 Outside a Shack

    You are standing outside a humble little shack in a clearing barely
 large enough to hold it.  There is a scrawled parchment note on the
 door, and a small jade box on the ground underneath it.

 The parchment note on the door reads:

 My son,

 Please leave today's fried egg in the jade container to gain entrance.
 Be ready to discuss "Benedict the Holy" when I return.  Do NOT burn
 anything this time.

 Another Crash Site

    You're walking about a small clearing amidst the wreckage of Timon
 Sketch's ship.  Dense forest surrounds you on all sides.  It looks
 like you might be able to beat a path through the foliage to the north
 and south.  Head west and you're back at your own crash site.

 Outside the Escape Pod Wreckage

    You are in the middle of a clearing at the site of your crash
 landing.  The escape pod lies to the north, and is still intact,
 though very badly damaged.

    Dense forest surrounds this little area, though it looks like you
 might be able to make some progress through the woods to the east,
 northwest, and south. Passage along other routes looks very unlikely.

 (Timon Sketch follows you.)

 Inside the Escape Pod

    You are standing inside the escape pod.  The interior is spartan,
 lacking even seats and tables, and it's barely big enough to hold
 several people.  The only control seems to be a big red button marked
 "LAUNCH."

    The top and front of the pod are badly mangled.  The transparent
 material you thought was glass is evidently something else -- it has
 crumpled just like the metal.

    The pod exit is to the south.

 head southeast, back to where you crash landed earlier.

 Survey Station

    You are standing in the middle of a narrow dirt road in front of a
 small survey station.  You assume that the station is used to monitor
 the frequent mining operations here on Irata.  A light on top of the
 station is blinking red.

    The station entrance is to the north -- the road ends here -- but
 you can travel south on it.  Passage in other directions looks
 unlikely -- the forest is too dense.  There is, however, a matter
 mover next to the station.

    Timon Sketch begins to sing:  "Igdoof ...  Nothing more than ...

>examine matter mover
    Matter mover technology hit the scene in 2062VK, just two years
 before the formation of the Republic.  In the hundred or so years
 since its introduction it's become the primary means of transportation
 throughout the galaxy.  This model is quite similar to the one in your

 the station has been used in quite some time.  There is a switch on

 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod

 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road

 think you'll like it."  Timon Sketch is definitely a man with clear
 priorities.

 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in

 Your bachelor pod


    Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

    Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

    Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds
 of light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for
 them to put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts
 of the galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod
 is situated on.

    On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you

 irregularly shaped bulbous case.  The screen is nearly square and
 inset at a jaunty angle.  In short, a typical product of the Akmi

 Kuwl Starport

    Welcome to the starport on Kuwl!  This place is so big and crowded
 that you can't see an exit anywhere.  There are thousands of short,
 bald, old men in robes wandering around here accosting
 normally-attired passers-by.  They seem to be handing flowers,
 leaflets, and other paraphernalia to the hapless victims, who try to
 flee but at every turn encounter yet another smiling, ancient
 Duhdhist.

    A wizened old man pops up out of nowhere and mysteriously intones,
 "My son, you are doing well.  Duhdha smiles upon your progress.  But
 you have yet to face His greatest challenge.  Take this with you and
 perhaps you will find the soul wisdom to meet this challenge.  On the
 other hand, maybe you're just not up to it.  We'll find out soon, my
 son.  Oh yes, we'll find out soon."  He hands you a small figurine,
 taps his left nostril dramatically, and then vanishes into the crowd.

>examine figurine
    It's a jade figurine of the Watchful Duhdha -- legend has it that
 this likeness of The Great One will ward off evil spirits.
 Additionally, it is said that an image like this one carved in jade by
 an enlightened follower of Duhdha has power to control the seas.

    Tiny letters carved in the base of the figurine read:

 "Rendered by the humble hands of Kuulest,
 For His Majesty Kuul,
 Son of Uul,
 In the 376th year of His Majesty's reign.
 Praise Duhdha!"

 Wow, this thing's an artifact -- almost 1800 years old!

>eat figurine
 An affront to the Great Duhdha!  You musn't speak such things!

>figurine, eat
 You can't do that, because it can't hear you.

>rub figurine
 You feel as though Duhdha is watching over you.

>praise duhdha
 I don't know the word "praise".

>pray to duhdha
 I don't recognize that sentence.

 An ethereal voice intones, "You have reached The Great Duhdha's
 automated prayer line.  If you wish to ask for a minor miracle, press
 one.  If you would like to check your karmic balance, press two.  If
 you would like to register a complaint or file a bug report, press
 three.  Press four to hang up.  If you are calling from a rotary

    A short balding man offers you an informational flyer on the First
 Galactic Bank of Duhdha, but you refuse it.

 Kuwl Starport

    Welcome to the starport on Kuwl!  This place is so big and crowded
 that you can't see an exit anywhere.  There are thousands of short,
 bald, old men in robes wandering around here accosting
 normally-attired passers-by.  They seem to be handing flowers,
 leaflets, and other paraphernalia to the hapless victims, who try to
 flee but at every turn encounter yet another smiling, ancient
 Duhdhist.

>examine men
 The men are scurrying around madly, desperately trying to convert as
 many bystanders as possible to the Way.

    A pruney old merchant hawking "Way Kuul" buttons passes by you in
 search of a sale.

>examine mover
    Matter mover technology hit the scene in 2062VK, just two years
 before the formation of the Republic.  In the hundred or so years
 since its introduction it's become the primary means of transportation
 throughout the galaxy.  This model is quite similar to the one in your
 pod.

 The address listed on the machine is:

    "10000, 10000, 9626 -- colorspace Egg White"

 Current dial settings:  (0, 0, 0)

>go east
 If I were you, I'd stay close to the mover.  If you get stuck in this
 crowd you'll die here, buried under a pile of flowers and
 self-discovery books.

>talk to men

>ask men about kuul
 I don't know the word "kuul".

>set red to 986
 Okay, it's now turned to 986.

    The startport intercom comes on:  "Would Kuulest please call on the
 egg-white courtesy phone?  Kuulest."  Suddenly, thousands of wizened
 old men stampede towards the phones.

>set green to 931
 Okay, it's now turned to 931.

>set blue to 4428
 Okay, it's now turned to 4428.

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 New Hell

    You are in a small lobby enclosed by a transparent dome.  The lobby
 opens up to the north into The Watchmen proper and an eastern portal
 leads outside.  This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear
 canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is:
 rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums
 and on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate
 molten rock into the midnight blue sky [27].

    Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating
 the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for
 you to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them
 for little nightmares.

    Flash.  A dog with its skull half crushed, pulling itself over to
 an upturned trashcan lid full of oily water, back legs dragging limply
 through the scum.

    Flash.  Someone's daughter screaming as her arms are twisted to
 breaking behind her back, her face bleeding as an aggressor's nails
 dig in and hold her head.

    Flash.  A PainWhip, legal nowhere there is law, flays open a boy's
 bare leg. As he crumples he is saved from the spiked wheels of the
 teenagers' rattle-trap mining truck by a sniper's well-placed
 disruptor blast.  The truck smolders as the boy hobbles into a
 tenement house.

    You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell
 is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't
 drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 wrinkled by the "Charon Effect," which streaks the stars in white

 At the Entrance to The Watchmen

    Here is the entrance to The Watchmen, home to the Watchmaker and,
 from the looks of it, frequented by society's outcasts.  Through the
 entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in
 business, pleasure, and pain.

    North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover
 and exit are to the south.

    The Watchmen bouncer is keeping an eye on you.  He doesn't seem
 eager to let you enter.

 You can't tell exactly what it is, but you figure that it must store
 some kind of information.  There are mover coordinates on the back of
 the device:

    Midnight Blue (+6, -49, +36)

>give board to bouncer
 The bouncer pulls a hand-held device out of his left trouser pocket
 and plugs the triangle into it.  He grunts, hands it back to you, and
 waves you through.

 *** Your score just went up by a point.  ***

>examine bouncer
    This fellow is a monster.  He looks human -- sort of -- but he's
 almost twice your height, and comically broad.

    Snakeskin grafts spiral up his arms, culminating in fanged
 cobra-head epaulets on his bare shoulders.  His chest is bare but for
 a web of chains attached to steel posts pierced into his skin with
 mathematical precision.  Attached to the mail are thick ropes
 suspending baggy black trousers.  The sparkle of his steel-toed boots
 echoes the gleam in his eye.

    You fear that his expression of disinterest only obscures the
 psychosis within.

>talk to bouncer
 I don't know the word "talk".

 The Watchmen

    You are wandering around the smoky, dark, cavernous interior of The
 Watchmen.  All around you oddly-dressed men make transactions, fight
 with each other, and generally carouse loudly.  It's so dimly lit here
 that you can barely find your way through the maze of human obstacles
 -- sitting, standing, and prone.

    The employees all seem to be male, but in many cases it's hard to
 tell.  They are dressed very differently then the clientele -- slick
 fabric uniforms in dark maroon that look too tight.  Each employee has
 a gold pocket watch emblem on his chest, just above the heart.

    The Watchmen continues to the north and south.

 The Watchmaker's Headquarters

    This area looks much like the rest of the place, but there are far
 fewer people here.  The majority are Watchmen employees, hovering
 around the Watchmaker.  No one pays much attention to you as you mill
 about.

    The Watchmaker is here.

>examine watchmaker
    The first thing that strikes you about the Watchmaker is her face,
 which seems to be fixed in a look that says, "I'm more than you
 think".  She is perpetually calm, speaks in a raspy whisper, and has
 eyes that are alert with the analytical intelligence that has made her
 ruler of the Republic's excrement.

    You see no hint of the insanity Timon Sketch alluded to -- only
 matter-of-fact evaluation and dispensation of orders.

    Those who work here appear to obey her unquestioningly.

 It's a hat made of Wugrump fur [28].  Very warm, but quite politically
 incorrect in these days of galaxy-wide eco-consciousness.

>note 28
 [28]: Wugrumps are cute, furry creatures that live on the planet Razor
 in the Edge system.  Unfortunately for the Wugrumps, all the other
 fauna on Razor are carnivorous, and Wugrums are the only things they
 like to eat.  Tough break.  One scientist estimated, however, that
 they spend fully 98% of their lives procreating.

>examine ary ung
 The ary ung is a black pistol-shaped implement that fits snugly in
 your hand.  It has an almost unnoticeable red trigger.

>go west
 The Watchmen

    You are wandering around the smoky, dark, cavernous interior of The
 Watchmen.  All around you oddly-dressed men make transactions, fight
 with each other, and generally carouse loudly.  It's so dimly lit here
 that you can barely find your way through the maze of human obstacles
 -- sitting, standing, and prone.

    The employees all seem to be male, but in many cases it's hard to
 tell.  They are dressed very differently then the clientele -- slick
 fabric uniforms in dark maroon that look too tight.  Each employee has
 a gold pocket watch emblem on his chest, just above the heart.

    The Watchmen proper ends here, but there is another smaller area to
 the east.  The rest of the establishment is south of here.

    Several tough-looking patrons in the corner eye you hungrily.

    The Watchmen continues to the north and south.

    An individual whose gender is unclear walks past you bedecked in a
 tight leather outfit covered in a mesh of needles.

>go south
 At the Entrance to The Watchmen

    Here is the entrance to The Watchmen, home to the Watchmaker and,
 from the looks of it, frequented by society's outcasts.  Through the
 entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in
 business, pleasure, and pain.

    North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover
 and exit are to the south.

    The bouncer is here, fortunately ignoring you.

>go south
 New Hell

    You are in a small lobby enclosed by a transparent dome.  The lobby
 opens up to the north into The Watchmen proper and an eastern portal
 leads outside.  This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear
 canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is:
 rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums
 and on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate
 molten rock into the midnight blue sky [27].

    Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating
 the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for
 you to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them
 for little nightmares.

    You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell
 is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't
 drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

>examine autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod
 3:  Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central
 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road
 6:  Survey Station
 7:  Kuwl Starport
 8:  New Hell

>push 5 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a
 stunningly pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the
 air here that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>go west
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

>go west
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends
 popular several hundred years ago, before the formation of the
 Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>go west
 Inside the Farmhouse

    You're standing in the entrance hallway of the Elwood farmhouse.
 The hardwood floors creak as you walk upon them, and the earthy,
 rustic decor delights your jaded cosmopolitan senses.

    The front door is in the east wall.  Ahead, to the west, is the
 living room.

>go west
 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

    The EV's picking up some of that dreadful SofToonz, Akmi's lame
 excuse for music, complete with pictures of serene landscapes and
 moire patterns.  They pipe this kind of drivel into buildings
 throughout the galaxy because it's been found to excite fewer species
 than any other kind of stimulation [21].

>set ev to 361
 Okay, it's now turned to 361.

>examine ev
 unimpressive, particularly considering you've seen about ten thousand
 identical models before.  (Akmi sometimes has a hard time letting go
 once they've found a formula that works.)  It's orange, it's mauve,
 it's purple.  It's squat and has functionless dimples all over its
 irregularly shaped bulbous case.  The screen is nearly square and
 inset at a jaunty angle.  In short, a typical product of the Akmi
 Aesthetix Division [18].

    The EV has a tuning dial; you can choose from thousands of
 different stations from across the galaxy.  The dial goes from 1 to
 100,000 and is currently set to 361.

    Channel 361, the Duhdhist Broadcasting Network, is currently
 enlightening viewers with "Igdoof Sits on the Egg," a tale of fate and
 retribution.

>go west
 Hall

    This narrow hall is similar to the one at the farmhouse entrance.
 A wooden staircase leads up from here; unfortunately, it also leads up
 to a protective-looking dog who is currently barking his head off at
 you.

    At the end of the hall, further west, is the back door.  It looks
 like it's been sealed shut.

>examine dog
    It's an annoying but spirited pooch that looks much like the ones
 you have on your native Tode.  On Tode you would call this animal a
 "mutt," but you can't be sure that it's not *supposed* to look like
 that here.

    You get the feeling that it has better vocal cords than fangs.

>go up
 As you begin ascending the staircase you find that the dog's volume
 level is inversely proportional to your distance from him, though he
 refuses to leave his perch several steps above you.  As you near the
 top, you hear a female voice yell from an upstairs room, "Rockoo, quit
 thawt bullering; it's jest eh frawgen churrel!"  You hastily retreat.

>show dog poodle charm
 I don't see any dog poodle charm here.

>examine charm
    It's a little gold charm shaped like a poodle.  It looks like it's
 quite old -- the edges are somewhat worn and it could use a good
 polishing.  The word "Pierre" is engraved on the back.

>examine putti
    The Akmi Wacki Putti is a freak of materials science.  It's bright
 pink and molds easily.  Easily, that is, when it's not runny, which it
 seems to become at random times.  Suffice it to say that the stuff is
 pretty disgusting.

    The Wacki Putti is currently firm.

>give putti to dog
 You toss the Akmi Wacki Putti to the dog, who quickly devours it.

>undo

>examine mixer
 It's an ordinary kitchen mixer.  Unfortunately, it seems to be missing

>examine dysor
    The Akmi Slysor Dysor is a fearsome contraption.  With 33 different
 blades and 194 additional attachements, this thing is a vegetable's
 worst nightmare.

    Designed to be easy to use, the Dysor only has one setting -- "on".
 It uses patented Akmi Fuz-E Artyfishal Nooral Intellujince to
 determine the most appropriate action for the item you insert.
 Unfortunately, the Dysors tend to prefer pureeing over all other
 options [19].

    It looks like an ordinary Akmi Slysor Dysor.  It is currently off.

 You blow into the whistle and nearly deafen yourself in the process.
 Pretty impressive for form-molded plastic.

>put whistle in putti
 You can't put anything in the Akmi Wacki Putti.

>put putti on whistle
 You can't put anything on the plastic whistle.

>press putti on whistle
 You can't do that, because that verb requires a double-quoted string
 or a number.

>pour gro on putti
 Pouring Akmi Soopur Wundur Gro on the Akmi Wacki Putti doesn't seem
 very productive.

>pour gro on dog
 Pouring Akmi Soopur Wundur Gro on the dog doesn't seem very
 productive.

>shoot gro with ung
 Soopur Wundur Gro seems unaffected.

>shoot ung with ung
 You can't shoot the ary ung with itself.

>shoot self with ung

>wave charm at dog
 Waving the poodle charm doesn't seem to do much.

>go up
 As you begin ascending the staircase you find that the dog's volume
 level is inversely proportional to your distance from him, though he
 refuses to leave his perch several steps above you.  As you near the
 top, you hear a female voice yell from an upstairs room, "Rockoo, quit
 thawt bullering; it's jest eh frawgen churrel!"  You hastily retreat.

>examine staircase
 It looks like an ordinary wooden staircase.

>throw salami east
 There are words after your command I couldn't use.

>throw geode at dog
 The animal shows no interest whatsoever.  It doesn't exactly give you

 You have grapes, 6 bananas, a geode, a figurine of the Great Duhdha, a
 dog-eared leaflet, a tiny triangular pink circuit board, an ary ung, a
 hammer, a bolt, a magnetic letter Q, a plastic whistle, a plastic
 plover's egg, some Akmi Wacki Putti, a firecracker, a mood ring (being
 worn), a piece of string (tied to the akmid), a poodle charm, a stick
 of butter, a Akmi Slysor Dysor, a blender, a mixer, a frying pan, a
 hunk of cheese, an overripe tomato, a piece of salami, an akmid (tied

 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

    Channel 361, the Duhdhist Broadcasting Network, is currently
 enlightening viewers with a philosophical discussion about silence and
 its use in not making noise.

>go east
 Inside the Farmhouse

    You're standing in the entrance hallway of the Elwood farmhouse.
 The hardwood floors creak as you walk upon them, and the earthy,
 rustic decor delights your jaded cosmopolitan senses.

    The front door is in the east wall.  Ahead, to the west, is the
 living room.

>go east
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends
 popular several hundred years ago, before the formation of the
 Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>go southwest
 At the Tire Swing Outside the Farmhouse

    You have walked around to the south side of the farmhouse, and find
 yourself confronted with a giant oak-like tree [16].  The tree has a
 tire swing attached to it.

    From here you can head either northeast or northwest, towards the
 front and rear of the house, respectively.

>examine tree
 It looks like an ordinary giant oak-like tree.

>examine branch
 You don't see anything matching that vocabulary here.

>climb rope
 You pull yourself up with your arms and legs, and slowly reach the
 top.

 Up the Oak-Like Tree

    Your precarious perch high in the tree affords you a spectacular
 view of the surrounding environs.  You now see the tremendous expanse
 of crops on just Elwood Farm alone -- the land is a patchwork as far
 as the eye can see.

    You spot the dirt road leading up to the farmhouse; a store past a
 bend in the road; and the local matter mover, which doesn't seem to
 get much traffic.

    High above you, on a far away branch, is a little bird's nest.

>examine branch
 Carved in the bark is the phrase, "Gavin Kelly luvs Ada Man 4Ever".
 Have you been here before or something?  What an incredible
 coincidence!

>take branch
 You can't take the branch.

>break branch
 I see no obvious way to do that.

>shake tree
 Waving the branch doesn't seem to do much.

>take nest
 The nest is far out of reach.

>throw geode at nest
 The bird's nest is too far away.

>put plover egg in nest
 You can't put anything in the bird's nest.

>go up
 Think again; it's a long way down.

>go up

 There is nothing here matching that vocabulary that you can do that

>throw hammer at nest

>go down
 You slide down the rope, being careful not to get rope burns.

 At the Tire Swing Outside the Farmhouse

    You have walked around to the south side of the farmhouse, and find
 yourself confronted with a giant oak-like tree [16].  The tree has a
 tire swing attached to it.

    From here you can head either northeast or northwest, towards the
 front and rear of the house, respectively.

>go northwest
 Behind the Farmhouse

    You are standing on the grassy lawn behind the farmhouse.  The lawn
 is quite big by Todian standards, but is made to look rather
 insignificant by the vast expanse of crops that border it on all
 sides.  It's times like these that you wish your folks didn't live in
 the city -- Tode's so crowded and noisy compared to places like this.
 But then again, maybe Foon's a bit *too* rural...

    The farmhouse has a back door, but it doesn't look like it gets
 much use.  Given that, you suspect that the only ways to go from here
 are back around the house to the northeast and southeast.

    There is a little tombstone in the ground nearby.

>go northeast
 At a Garden Outside the Farmhouse

    Here on the north side of the farmhouse is a large garden full of
 yummy-looking treats.  The soil has been recently tilled and smells
 wonderfully rich, and from the looks of it supports the vegetables
 planted in it far better than any Todian earth could.

    You've heard plenty of stories about the near-magical fertility of
 the Foonian soil, but this close-up demonstration really drives the
 point home.  The goodies here are all oversized and delicious-looking.
 You suspect that even you, with your limited gardening experience,
 could grow a prize plant on Foon.

    From here you can head either southeast, to the front of the
 farmhouse, or southwest, to the rear.

>plant tomato
 I don't see what that could possibly accomplish.

>dig hole
 With what?

>dig hole with hammer
 There is nothing here matching that vocabulary that you can do that
 to.

>examine soil
 The garden is very impressive, with vegetables of all varieties.

>dig soil
 With what?

>hammer
 You can't dig in the vegetable garden.

>goodies
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>break tomato
 I see no obvious way to do that.

>take goodies
 Much as you'd like to, your moral upbringing prevents you from ripping
 off the Elwoods [15].

>eat tomato
 That was delicious!

>undo
 One command undone.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new

 to the dirt road.

>go east
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

>go east
 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a
 stunningly pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the
 air here that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>examine autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod
 3:  Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central
 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road
 6:  Survey Station
 7:  Kuwl Starport
 8:  New Hell

>push 6 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Survey Station

    You are standing in the middle of a narrow dirt road in front of a
 small survey station.  You assume that the station is used to monitor
 the frequent mining operations here on Irata.  A light on top of the
 station is blinking green.

    The station entrance is to the north -- the road ends here -- but
 you can travel south on it.  Passage in other directions looks
 unlikely -- the forest is too dense.  There is, however, a matter
 mover next to the station.

>go south
 In a Small Clearing

    You are standing in a small clearing in the middle of a dense
 forest.  The tall grass here tickles your ankles and sways in a light
 breeze.  A dirt road leads north.  Passage through the forest looks
 difficult, but you could probably make your way south.  You can also
 head southeast, back to where you crash landed earlier.

>go south
 At a Tall Fence

    Your way south is blocked by a very tall fence.  You notice a loud
 humming sound here.  It seems to be coming from the fence.

    Thick forest surrounds you -- you can head back north, but it
 doesn't look like you'll make much progress going any other way.

 You fight your way through the forest up a steep slope.  After a long
 struggle, you find yourself...

 Atop a Cliff

    This place is well worth the trouble it took to get here.  Your
 spot atop this steep cliff affords you a panoramic view of the land
 all around.  Directly in front of you, to the north, is a 500 meter
 drop down to a thick forest canopy that continues to the horizon
 undisturbed.  Do be careful.

    To the south are the crash sites, and you notice a tiny building in
 the woods to the east of Sketch's ship.

    Farther south is what looks to be an agricultural and mining
 complex of some kind, with a fence running all around the perimeter.

    The cliff continues to the northwest and southeast, but you'd have
 to have climbing gear to survive passage along it -- this whole region
 is covered with rocks of all sizes and you barely made it this far
 without breaking a leg.

    You see a clearing to the southwest, on this side of the cliff.  A
 path north through the trees leads from the tiny clearing to a small
 tower.  Atop the tower is a blinking green light.

    Looks like the only way out of here is to the south, the way you
 came.

 Survey Station

    You are standing in the middle of a narrow dirt road in front of a
 small survey station.  You assume that the station is used to monitor
 the frequent mining operations here on Irata.  A light on top of the
 station is blinking green.

    The station entrance is to the north -- the road ends here -- but
 you can travel south on it.  Passage in other directions looks
 unlikely -- the forest is too dense.  There is, however, a matter
 mover next to the station.

>push 1 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Your bachelor pod


    Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

    Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

    Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds
 of light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for
 them to put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts
 of the galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod
 is situated on.

    On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you
 use nearly 37 hours a day.  Cuddled up right next to it like a best

    It's a Zippikraft Data Liquidizer 1024/A -- that's the technical
 term for "one fast machine."  Zippikraft makes the fastest computing
 hardware in the galaxy using technology no one else has been able to
 copy yet, despite several years of desperate (and creative) industrial
 espionage [4].

    Your Liquidizer is entirely lime green, the only color Zippikraft
 computers come in, with a built-in optical disk drive, detachable

 use the 3D video mode in your research since you deal mainly with
 text, but it's great for impressing guests and convincing your parents
 that the machine was really worth as much as the rest of your entire
 college education costs combined.

 access to Akmi's galactic network, which now permeates almost all
 aspects of daily life, from electronic mail to shopping and funds
 transfers.

 unimpressive, particularly considering you've seen about ten thousand
 identical models before.  (Akmi sometimes has a hard time letting go
 once they've found a formula that works.)  It's orange, it's mauve,

 irregularly shaped bulbous case.  The screen is nearly square and
 inset at a jaunty angle.  In short, a typical product of the Akmi
 Aesthetix Division [18].

    The EV has a tuning dial; you can choose from thousands of

>examine nowtz
    The hundred or so Stik-Em Nowtz littering your pod are largely
 incomprehensible; most of them are scribbled diagrams and notes you've
 made to yourself during your two year stay here.  Among the
 long-forgotten reminders you find the address of Terminal Velocity,
 the favorite hang-out for the galaxy's best computer jocks.  It says,
 "Hot Pink (+0, -52, -5) [29]," but a fat lot of good that's going to
 do you.

    You chuckle as you recall your last visit there three years ago --
 they weren't particularly interested in yet another 3-dimensional
 chess program, especially one that couldn't beat their own weekend
 implementations.  Trying to find software that'll impress them enough
 to let you in is nearly impossible, which is why it's the most
 exclusive club around.  It's also probably the best source of computer
 information in the galaxy...

>note 29
 [29]: Matter mover coordinates are often given relative to colorspace
 basis coordinates.  E.g., "Hot Pink (+0, -52, -5)" means to take the
 base coordinates for Hot Pink and add zero to red, subtract 52 from
 green, and subtract 5 from blue.

    A mosaic on the floor includes the following cryptic message:

 Toy Room

    The decor here is extraordinary -- the walls, floor and ceiling
 provide a perfectly white background for the giant splotches of paint
 of all different colors that are splashed everywhere.  The room is
 filled with weird toys of all sorts, and the only furniture is a giant
 beanbag.  There is an enterviewer embedded in the wall.  The only way
 out is back west.

    Channel 80180, your 37-hour sports network, is now featuring two
 green tentacled creatures concentrating over a went board.

    A sign on the wall says, "Please do not try to take our toys."

    An Akmi JoiStyk, an Akmi Sez, The Swarm, an Akmi PuzzelKyoob, and a
 giant beanbag are here.

>play joistyck
 I don't know the word "joistyck".

>play joistyk
 The JoyStyk isn't connected to anything, but you wiggle it around
 nonetheless.  Wheeeee!

>examine swarm
 The Swarm is a twisty jumble of artificial insects, all alike.  They
 fly around madly, roughly tracking what seems to be the "leader" in
 drunken arcs.

>examine kyoob
 It's a 6x6x6 cube with colored squares on it.  You can rotate the
 various rows of blocks around on all axes.  It is currently in the
 solved configuration.

>examine beanbag
 It's just a huge red beanbag.  Unfortunately, however, it has a hard
 lump in one place, so it's not the most comfortable thing in the world
 to sit on.

>sit on beanbag
 You're now sitting in the giant beanbag.

>examine lump
 It's just a lump.  You can't tell any more than that.

>press lump
 Pushing the lump doesn't seem to have much effect.

>cut lump with hanger
 You can't just go around slicing everything into pieces, you know!

>examine hanger
 The metal coat hanger has a nasty looking pointy end.

>cut lump with pointy end
 I don't know the word "pointy".

>cut beanbag with hanger
 You jab the metal coat hanger into the giant beanbag, thereby creating
 a sizeable tear in the fabric.  Your reckless vandalism pays off,
 however:  a tiny metal object drops out the hole and onto the ground
 at your feet.  It appears to be a motorized toy named Squirt.

 *** Your score just went up by 2 points.  ***

    Squirt zooms around madly for a few seconds, turns to face you, and
 then zips right up to your feet.

>examine squirt
    It's a motorized toy about the size of a golfball with the word
 "Squirt" printed in block letters on the microchip on its back.
 Squirt has four little wheels, two beady eyes that look like LED's,
 and a metal gripper in front to hold (small) things with.

    There are no other markings on it, so you can't determine its
 origin or intended function.

    There doesn't appear to be anything in Squirt's gripper.

    Squirt turns to face you.  His blinking little LED's make him look
 like he's waiting for you to do something.

>squeeze squirt
 Ok, you just rubbed the little motorized toy named Squirt.

    Squirt spontaneously makes a beeline for the shadows, then returns
 to the light moments later.

>take squirt
 Taken.

>give putti to squirt
 You can't give things to the little motorized toy named Squirt.

>put putti in gripper
 The Akmi Wacki Putti is too big to fit.

 It looks just like the one the burly guard's wearing, except that it
 doesn't have that neato emblem on the right sleeve.

 Squirt, a box of KrudKo "Kolor-Me-Kool" snacks, an EZ-Tech Blaser, a
 metal coat hanger, an olive drab uniform, a qualitative calculator,
 some Akmi Wacki Putti, a hammer, a figurine of the Great Duhdha, a
 dog-eared leaflet, a tiny triangular pink circuit board, an ary ung, a
 bolt, a magnetic letter Q, a plastic whistle, a plastic plover's egg,
 a firecracker, a mood ring (being worn), a piece of string (tied to
 the akmid), a poodle charm, a stick of butter, a Akmi Slysor Dysor, a
 blender, a mixer, a frying pan, a hunk of cheese, an overripe tomato,
 a piece of salami, an akmid (tied to the piece of string), a thermos
 of Barfee advanced growth formula QX-32-Beta, a can of Akmi Soopur
 Wundur Gro, a crumpled scrap of paper, a paperback book, a handwritten

 ReVoLT Kola can, a Galacticard, and a matter mover autodialer.

 Halfway down the Infinite Corridor

    You are standing in the middle of Terminal Velocity's "Infinite
 Corridor."  To the north, you assume, is the entrance to Terminal
 Velocity, but all you can see is a wall -- no door.  To the south is
 the gateway.

    There are rooms to the east and west.

    There is a burly musclehead here eyeing you suspiciously.

    The guard storms over to you and demands that you remove the extra
 uniform.  You comply fearfully.  He then picks you up by the scruff of
 the neck and carries you back to the Terminal Velocity gateway.

 Terminal Velocity Gateway

    You are at the southern end of what appears to be an infinite

    A blinding neon sign over the archway into the hall is beckoning
 you to come inside.  Fortunately, the guard isn't here at the moment.

    A mosaic on the floor includes the following cryptic message:

 "red down, green up, blue down, yellow up, magenta down, cyan up,
 white down"

>examine mover
    Matter mover technology hit the scene in 2062VK, just two years
 before the formation of the Republic.  In the hundred or so years
 since its introduction it's become the primary means of transportation
 throughout the galaxy.  This model is quite similar to the one in your
 pod.

 The machine's address is written in bright pink letters:

    "Terminal Velocity:  10000, 4065, 7053 -- Hot Pink (+0, -52, -5)"

 Current dial settings:  (0, 0, 0)

>examine autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod
 3:  Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central
 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road
 6:  Survey Station
 7:  Kuwl Starport
 8:  New Hell
 9:  Terminal Velocity Gateway

>type 5 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a
 stunningly pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the
 air here that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>go west
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

>go west
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends
 popular several hundred years ago, before the formation of the
 Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>go west
 Inside the Farmhouse

    You're standing in the entrance hallway of the Elwood farmhouse.
 The hardwood floors creak as you walk upon them, and the earthy,
 rustic decor delights your jaded cosmopolitan senses.

    The front door is in the east wall.  Ahead, to the west, is the
 living room.

>go west
 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

    Channel 361, the Duhdhist Broadcasting Network, is currently
 enlightening viewers with "The Story of Kuulest and the Useless,
 Untutored, Untrained, Utterly Inept Slave."

 Hall

    This narrow hall is similar to the one at the farmhouse entrance.
 A wooden staircase leads up from here; unfortunately, it also leads up
 to a protective-looking dog who is currently barking his head off at
 you.

    At the end of the hall, further west, is the back door.  It looks
 like it's been sealed shut.

>examine door

    Squirt's eyes appear to blink on and off as he slowly rotates 360
 degrees in place.

>examine squirt
    It's a motorized toy about the size of a golfball with the word
 "Squirt" printed in block letters on the microchip on its back.
 Squirt has four little wheels, two beady eyes that look like LED's,

    There are no other markings on it, so you can't determine its

    Squirt's little motor begins to whine as he revs up in place, then
 shoots off straight ahead in a full wheelie.

>examine squirt's gripper
 There doesn't appear to be anything in Squirt's gripper.

    As you subconsciously mumble something to yourself, Squirt makes a
 brief squealing noise and throws out a little shower of sparks.  He
 seems unharmed.

    Squirt lurches forward a bit, then stops, seemingly in response to
 a movement you just made.

    Squirt zooms around madly for a few seconds, turns to face you, and

>examine blaser
 The EZ-Tech Blaser is a comical looking weapon, with a clear body,
 giant plastic red rings around the barrel and an oversized orange
 trigger.  Tiny letters inscribed in the handle read "EZ-Tech Blaser,
 with patented 'Point-and-Shoot' interface, will meet all your violence
 needs!  EZ-Tech:  A division of Akmi!"

    Squirt's movements trace out a perfect square on the ground in
 front of you.

>shoot door with blaser
 The rings around the barrel of the EZ-Tech Blaser begin to pulsate
 like runway lights.  The gun starts making a furious humming sound,
 but nothing at all destructive happens.

 this likeness of The Great One will ward off evil spirits.
 Additionally, it is said that an image like this one carved in jade by
 an enlightened follower of Duhdha has power to control the seas.

    Tiny letters carved in the base of the figurine read:

 "Rendered by the humble hands of Kuulest,
 For His Majesty Kuul,
 Son of Uul,
 In the 376th year of His Majesty's reign.
 Praise Duhdha!"

 Wow, this thing's an artifact -- almost 1800 years old!

>show figurine to dog
 The animal shows no interest whatsoever.  It doesn't exactly give you
 the impression that it is a rocket scientist among dogs.

>praise duhdha
 I don't know the word "praise".

>pray
 An ethereal voice intones, "You have reached The Great Duhdha's
 automated prayer line.  If you wish to ask for a minor miracle, press
 one.  If you would like to check your karmic balance, press two.  If
 you would like to register a complaint or file a bug report, press

 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

 Inside the Farmhouse

    You're standing in the entrance hallway of the Elwood farmhouse.

>go east
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends
 popular several hundred years ago, before the formation of the
 Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>go east
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a
 stunningly pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the
 air here that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>push 1 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter dialer
 You can't enter the matter mover autodialer.

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Your bachelor pod


    Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

    Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

    Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds
 of light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for
 them to put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts
 of the galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod
 is situated on.

    On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you
 use nearly 37 hours a day.  Cuddled up right next to it like a best
 friend is your EV.

    Channel 361, the Duhdhist Broadcasting Network, is currently
 enlightening viewers with a discussion of the evils of egg
 substitutes.

>examine nowtz
    The hundred or so Stik-Em Nowtz littering your pod are largely
 incomprehensible; most of them are scribbled diagrams and notes you've
 made to yourself during your two year stay here.  Among the
 long-forgotten reminders you find the address of Terminal Velocity,
 the favorite hang-out for the galaxy's best computer jocks.  It says,
 "Hot Pink (+0, -52, -5) [29]," but a fat lot of good that's going to
 do you.

    You chuckle as you recall your last visit there three years ago --
 they weren't particularly interested in yet another 3-dimensional
 chess program, especially one that couldn't beat their own weekend
 implementations.  Trying to find software that'll impress them enough
 to let you in is nearly impossible, which is why it's the most
 exclusive club around.  It's also probably the best source of computer
 information in the galaxy...

>hint
    The hint system in this game is adaptive.  This means that it
 adjusts itself based on your progress, to give you the most useful
 hint it can.  You will not be penalized for getting hints, though the
 game does keep track of how many you've used throughout the game.

    Be warned, however, that the hints will eventually spell out the
 solution to every puzzle -- if you overuse the hints, you will likely
 spoil the puzzle-solving part of the game.  Before giving up on a
 puzzle, take a break and come back to it later.

    To get a hint, just type "hint" at any time.  If the hint system
 has any remaining advice for you, it will respond with a list of hint
 topics:

    1:  Basics
    2:  How to get the cheez kee

 You then enter the topic you want a hint for.  The program will
 respond with two numbers and the hint text, like so:

    (1/4):  Try typing "hint" when you're stuck.

    The numbers tell you which hint you're on in the topic, and how
 many hints there are in all.  The hint above, for example, is the
 first of four for the topic "Basics."

    Within a topic, hints get progressively more direct -- the last
 hint in a group will generally spell out the solution to the puzzle.

 There are 4 topics available:

    You are standing in the middle of a narrow dirt road in front of a

 Barfee Research Area Entrance

    You're standing in an empty hall with metal walls, ceiling, and

 of you, farther down the hall, is a smaller but equally
 durable-looking door with a sign on it that reads "Barfee Research

 [31]: Wugrumps are cute, furry creatures that live on the planet Razor
 in the Edge system.  Unfortunately for the Wugrumps, all the other

 Barfee Research Area Entrance

    You're standing in an empty hall with metal walls, ceiling, and
 floor.  Behind you, to the south, is the vault door that leads to the
 outside; it does not appear to open from the inside.  Right in front
 of you, farther down the hall, is a smaller but equally
 durable-looking door with a sign on it that reads "Barfee Research
 Central."  There is another room to the west, and to the east is what
 you assume to be the check-in area; you suspect that's where the boss
 is; this suspicion is partly affirmed by the growling and cursing
 emanating from within.  "Hakkar the Horrible" is in full form.

    Something is ticking.

>go west
 Featureless Cubicle

    It's clear from the size and lack of decor that this room was built
 specifically to house the matter mover that fills it.  The hallway is
 to the east.

    The matter mover here is a bit unusual -- it has a button on it,
 next to a light.

    Something is ticking.

>examine autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod
 3:  Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central
 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road
 6:  Survey Station
 7:  Kuwl Starport
 8:  New Hell
 9:  Terminal Velocity Gateway

>push 2 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Ada's pod

    You are in your true love Ada's pod.  It's quite similar to your
 own, but isn't nearly as messy.  Ada seems to have gone off and left
 saving the galaxy to you alone [6].

 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a
 stunningly pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the
 air here that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

    Something is ticking.

>go west
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

    Something is ticking.

>go west
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends
 popular several hundred years ago, before the formation of the
 Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

    Something is ticking.

>go northwest
 At a Garden Outside the Farmhouse

    Here on the north side of the farmhouse is a large garden full of
 yummy-looking treats.  The soil has been recently tilled and smells
 wonderfully rich, and from the looks of it supports the vegetables
 planted in it far better than any Todian earth could.

    You've heard plenty of stories about the near-magical fertility of
 the Foonian soil, but this close-up demonstration really drives the
 point home.  The goodies here are all oversized and delicious-looking.
 You suspect that even you, with your limited gardening experience,
 could grow a prize plant on Foon.

    From here you can head either southeast, to the front of the
 farmhouse, or southwest, to the rear.

    Something is ticking.

>plant seeds
 You pour all the seeds out and bury them in the rich soil.  There is
 now a lump in the soil where you planted the seeds.

>pour gro on lump
 You douse the seeds with Akmi Soopur Wundur Gro.  Soon after, you
 realize it probably wasn't such a good idea -- the lump of soil begins
 to foam, and then quickly vaporizes, taking the seeds with it.

>undo

 Survey Station

    You are standing in the middle of a narrow dirt road in front of a
 small survey station.  You assume that the station is used to monitor
 the frequent mining operations here on Irata.  A light on top of the
 station is blinking green.

    The station entrance is to the north -- the road ends here -- but
 you can travel south on it.  Passage in other directions looks
 unlikely -- the forest is too dense.  There is, however, a matter
 mover next to the station.

    Something is ticking.

>go south
 In a Small Clearing

    You are standing in a small clearing in the middle of a dense
 forest.  The tall grass here tickles your ankles and sways in a light
 breeze.  A dirt road leads north.  Passage through the forest looks
 difficult, but you could probably make your way south.  You can also
 head southeast, back to where you crash landed earlier.

    Something is ticking.

>go south
 At a Tall Fence

    Your way south is blocked by a very tall fence.  You notice a loud
 humming sound here.  It seems to be coming from the fence.

    Thick forest surrounds you -- you can head back north, but it
 doesn't look like you'll make much progress going any other way.

>examine autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod
 3:  Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central
 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road
 6:  Survey Station
 7:  Kuwl Starport

 around...

 New Hell

    You are in a small lobby enclosed by a transparent dome.  The lobby
 opens up to the north into The Watchmen proper and an eastern portal
 leads outside.  This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear
 canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is:
 rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums
 and on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate
 molten rock into the midnight blue sky [27].

    Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating
 the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for
 you to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them
 for little nightmares.

    You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell
 is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't
 drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

    Something is ticking.

>go north
 At the Entrance to The Watchmen

    Here is the entrance to The Watchmen, home to the Watchmaker and,
 from the looks of it, frequented by society's outcasts.  Through the
 entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in
 business, pleasure, and pain.

    North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover
 and exit are to the south.

    The Watchmen bouncer is keeping an eye on you.  He doesn't seem
 eager to let you enter.  Something is ticking.

>show board to bouncer
 The bouncer pulls a hand-held device out of his left trouser pocket
 and plugs the triangle into it.  He grunts, hands it back to you, and
 waves you through.

>go north
 The Watchmen

    You are wandering around the smoky, dark, cavernous interior of The
 Watchmen.  All around you oddly-dressed men make transactions, fight
 with each other, and generally carouse loudly.  It's so dimly lit here
 that you can barely find your way through the maze of human obstacles
 -- sitting, standing, and prone.

    The employees all seem to be male, but in many cases it's hard to
 tell.  They are dressed very differently then the clientele -- slick
 fabric uniforms in dark maroon that look too tight.  Each employee has
 a gold pocket watch emblem on his chest, just above the heart.

    The Watchmen continues to the north and south.

 The Watchmaker's Headquarters

    This area looks much like the rest of the place, but there are far
 fewer people here.  The majority are Watchmen employees, hovering
 around the Watchmaker.  No one pays much attention to you as you mill
 about.

    The Watchmaker is here.  Something is ticking.

>show board to Watchmaker
 "No information is free, you little rugrat," the Watchmaker grumbles.

>examine watchmaker
    The first thing that strikes you about the Watchmaker is her face,
 which seems to be fixed in a look that says, "I'm more than you
 think".  She is perpetually calm, speaks in a raspy whisper, and has
 eyes that are alert with the analytical intelligence that has made her
 ruler of the Republic's excrement.

    You see no hint of the insanity Timon Sketch alluded to -- only
 matter-of-fact evaluation and dispensation of orders.

    Those who work here appear to obey her unquestioningly.

 Terminal Velocity Gateway

    You are at the southern end of what appears to be an infinite
 corridor.  There is a matter mover in the south wall, and you conclude
 from your surroundings that the entrance to Terminal Velocity is at
 the north end of the hallway.

    A blinding neon sign over the archway into the hall is beckoning
 you to come inside.  Fortunately, the guard isn't here at the moment.

    There is a printed note on the wall.

    There is a burly musclehead here eyeing you suspiciously.
 Something is ticking.

    Uh-oh.  The guard's noticed you.  You try to explain your

    The average-looking fellow wearing a T-shirt and shorts shows a

 a colorful emblem on his right sleeve, nods his head, and motions
 northward, down the hall.

    The guard storms over to you and demands that you remove the extra
 uniform.  You comply fearfully.

 This gadget looks a lot more like a zucchini stuck in a bowl of vanilla
 pudding than a human-computer interface device.  It's dull green with

 The Akmi JoiStyk is not attached to anything.

 There's nothing odd about it, except that it's 5-sided.

 Almost every child in the galaxy has one of these clever little toys.
 It's a wafer-thin disk with little colored pads on it that you touch;
 the idea is to repeat the machine's patterns exactly.

 unimpressive, particularly considering you've seen about ten thousand
 identical models before.  (Akmi sometimes has a hard time letting go
 once they've found a formula that works.)  It's orange, it's mauve,
 it's purple.  It's squat and has functionless dimples all over its
 irregularly shaped bulbous case.  The screen is nearly square and inset
 at a jaunty angle.  In short, a typical product of the Akmi Aesthetix

    The EV has a tuning dial; you can choose from thousands of different
 stations from across the galaxy.  The dial goes from 1 to 100,000 and
 is currently set to 80180.

    Channel 80180, your 37-hour sports network, is now featuring

 Velocity, but all you can see is a wall -- no door.  To the south is
 the gateway.

    There are rooms to the east and west.

    There is a burly musclehead here eyeing you suspiciously.

 transgression but he wants to hear nothing of it.  He picks you up with
 one arm and tosses you back into the Terminal Velocity gateway.

 Terminal Velocity Gateway

    You are at the southern end of what appears to be an infinite

 from your surroundings that the entrance to Terminal Velocity is at the
 north end of the hallway.

    A blinding neon sign over the archway into the hall is beckoning you
 to come inside.  Fortunately, the guard isn't here at the moment.

 Your bachelor pod


    Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

    Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

    Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds of
 light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for them to
 put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts of the
 galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod is
 situated on.

    On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you use
 nearly 37 hours a day.  Cuddled up right next to it like a best friend

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons
 who are sitting at tables and chatting.  Others are huddled around
 terminals eyeing the screens with rapt attention and sometimes-devilish
 grins.  The bar is large and circular, and is by itself in a giant,
 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the
 floor here.  Short stairways lead down every side of it.

    You can descend the steps to the southwest or walk around outside
 the pit to the northwest and south.  There is also a rainbow-colored
 portal in the east wall.

    Something is ticking.

 Jax O Pax's Data Den

    As you walk into the room, you are approached by a slender fellow
 with blond hair and vaguely fox-like features, wearing bright but
 patternless clothing.

    "Jax," he says, "Jax O Pax.  Glad to see some new blood around here.
 Whenju break?"

    "Uh...  break?"  you reply, puzzled.

    "Ja, 'break,' as in 'break in,' you know?"  He says impatiently.  He
 talks very fast; his words hit you like bullets.  It's very disturbing
 at first, but you're slowly getting used to it.

    "I broke just today.  Nice place you got here," you improvise,
 trying desperately to sound like you know what you're doing.

    "Broke today.  Huh.  S'cool, I'll show ya sometin'.  Checkitout:"
 He leads you over to a terminal at which a raven-haired woman with a
 girlish ponytail that looks completely out of place against the
 backdrop of her otherwise intense features is furiously typing away.
 "Mare," he says.  "She's the best.  We're hackin' a new RE together,
 yeah, butcha don' know what that is, do ya Slick?"  he turns towards
 you, maybe just to see the look on your face.

    "A, uh, regular expression ...  maybe?"  you half-mumble, knowing
 full-well it couldn't possibly be the right answer, but hoping to
 demonstrate at least some knowledge of Computer Science lest you
 totally lose face.

    It isn't the right answer.  Jax laughs out loud, and Mare giggles in
 an exaggerated cartoony way.  "No, Hoss, a Reasoning Engine.  You might
 say an AI, yeah.  Don't tell the MLA, and yeah I know you're not one of
 'em 'cause they don't fake bein' dumb as well as you -- heh, just
 jokin' kid.  See..."

    "An ...  A ...  I?," you stammer [36].  "You've got to be kidding!
 How?"

    "It's old news.  I'll explain it to you some time when we've both
 got a few weeks free.  Anyway it's s'posed to be top secret; is why
 they've got a Machine Limiting Authority in the first place -- didja
 know about that one?  Buncha suits poking their snouts into everybody's
 biz tryin' to keep the tech from 'fallin' into the wrong hands,' but
 hey, these look pretty good to me ...  how 'bout chew, Cowboy?"  He
 pops a disk from somewhere and cradles it in his palms, waiting for
 your approval.  Light does not dance on it as with standard disks; this
 one is half white and half black.  The black part seems to absorb the
 world around it with a strange kind of hypnotic gravity.  The white
 part is equally striking -- it's nearly blinding.

    "This AI fits on a single disk?"  you ask, incredulous.

    Jax smiles.  "Think we got a sharp one here, Mare.  Seriously,
 Books, this disk ain't the whole tamale, just the seed we grew him
 from.  JC takes up halfa TV's netted storage.  He's pretty nice about
 not hoggin' all the pages though."

    "Actually, we ain't quite sure how he got to be so ...  with it, if
 you wanna know the real truth.  Oh yeah, we know what MLA knows:  ya
 frob some semnets together just so, and ya get a smart little cookie
 out th'other side -- but that ain't smart like *us* -- is smart with no
 motivation, no goals; no creativity, ya see.  JC, he's like *us*.

    "We had a disk crash on the big server while Mare was polishin' up
 the latest AI -- she was doin' a backup, "just in case" as she always
 says, when the drive went down.  The code was scrambled up -- took her
 months to piece it back together -- never was same as before.  I
 thought it was a wasta time; I busted her about it -- kept asking her
 how "Justin Case," the new AI, was doin' -- thought she shoulda started
 somethin' new 'steada wallowin' in what was lost.  But she had that
 programmer's fire, y'know, wouldn't let him go.  Then the news broke:
 the crash made Justin Case somethin' new.  Mare didn't understand it --
 said she was just in that coding trance -- said she was just tryin' to
 patch him back up best she could.  But then little JC started doin'
 things we'd never seen an AI do before.  He's one of a kind.  Keep it
 under your hat, Slick."

    An image of you appears on the screen.

    "How are you feeling today, JC?"  Mare asks the image.

 The program responds immediately, and "you" begin to speak:

    "Top o' the morning to you.  I'm just great, thanks, -- couldn't be
 better.  Literally!  Hah!  So what's the latest, folks?"  The voice
 sounds just like you!

    Mare replies, "I've got a new friend for you to meet.  Name's ..."

    "Gavin," you interject.

    "Nice to meet you, Gavin.  I'm getting this funny feeling that we've
 met before.  Ha-ha.  You must be Gavin Kelly, currently a struggling
 graduate student at Akmi Yooni.  How's the Computer Science program?"

    "Hey, I'm not struggling!"  you protest.  You get the feeling some
 "circuits" are grinning rather broadly right now.  "OK, how did you
 guys pull this off?  I wasn't born yesterday, you know," you sneer.
 Mare and Jax say nothing.  JC replies:

    "'You guys?'  Harumph; I'm offended.  But since you asked, I checked
 the coordinates coming in to the mover in the hall.  Took you long
 enough getting in here."

    "You mean it's for real?"  you sputter.

    "More for real than you and me, kid.  I still remember that first
 day, when I booted him up and he started babbling like a little infant.
 He was so cute...."  Mare reminisces.

    JC, whose image has now changed into a strange face made entirely of
 polygons, interrupts.  "Jeez, do you have to embarrass me?  I mean
 every time you ...  Hold on.  You've got an interesting credit problem
 here, Mr.  Kelly.  Been running a racket or something?  No, that's not
 it; wait a sec...  " JC's voice no longer sounds like yours, though it
 still sounds fairly normal.

    Of all the things you expected to find in Terminal Velocity, a
 Reasoning Engine named JC with a affinity for audiovisuals
 interrogating you about your credit history wasn't one of them.  As you
 turn to Jax, he anticipates the obvious question:

    "JC wires down on everyone who trips on in here so we can keep the
 MLA outta here.  You can thank Mare for that; she used to spook for NSA
 -- Network Safety Administration, ya know -- but she slipped out under
 the rug.  She's pretty good at that sort of biz."

    "NSA used to work with us, yeah; we were in bed pretty good there
 for a while, and it was like dream hardware from hell; then Glaz
 cracked reasoning and we've been cut off ever since -- abs!  Not a peep
 out of 'em 'cept through MLA, and hey, we'd like to lose that noise for
 good.  Glaz shoulda kept that tech to himself.  Ja, but now he's
 gone..."  Jax stops for JC's report:

    "Well, well, my friend, " JC reports, "you've racked up an
 impressive number of dogs on your tail here.  Whatcha been up to, boy,
 building a quark bomb?  You're totally cut off, man, no credit and an
 auto-arrest on the card.  BIG stuff from Akmi Galactic HQ; I don't
 think I can shunt it without provoking serious sniffage.  Better not
 use the plastic, son."

    The Unnkulians!  What else could it be?  "Hey Jax," you say
 hesitantly, "I did find something on the net that I was hoping to get
 your help on.  That's sort of why I'm here, actually."  You tell Jax
 and Mare about your AkNet search and the virus it unearthed.  JC, now
 taking the image of a stereotypical young computer jock with oversized
 HoloGoggles, goes out to the net to check things out.  Moments later he
 returns with a report:

    "You're not going to believe this.  Major, major stuff going down
 here.  That virus is an RE.  Self-mutating and poly-adaptive -- I've
 never seen anything like it.  Scared me witless just looking at it; I
 don't know if it could see me but I broke out of there without tripping
 anything."

    "The basic situation is this:  that virus has done its job.  Whoever
 put it there already *has* a grip on the whole net if they want it, and
 they've had pockets of local control for a couple months now.  My
 estimation of AkNet core infection time matches the beginning of the
 second MLA sniff-blitz too.  Looks like whoever's in charge now at Akmi
 HQ wanted to cover their tails but good.  And it's a safe bet that
 they'd be pretty unhappy to learn that we've found out about them.
 Sure seems like they're already on to Mr.  Kelly, unfortunately.  Stay
 out of trouble, Gavin."

    Jax looks very worried.  Mare interrupts JC:  "Do you have a threat
 analysis?  How does this affect TV?"

    "Problem number one is that the RE's been out there for years.  I
 could tell from a distance that this thing is BIG, and at least an
 order of magnitude more aware than I am.  Somebody out there's got some
 amazing tech."

    "But I thought it was a virus; how can it be so aware if it's got to
 propagate itself?"  Mare asks.

    "That's the incredible thing:  It's found a way to keep its semantic
 net widely distributed.  I don't understand it fully, but it seems to
 be a kind of digital gestalt -- lots of sub-viruses, all different,
 communicating with each other to further a collective purpose.  With
 every replication it becomes a tiny bit more aware.  So the more of
 AkNet it infects, the more of AkNet it *knows*.  That may explain why
 it was replicating into non-strategic areas like the public library
 records Gavin was looking through when he found it."

    "By the way, Gavin, you got very lucky.  My understanding of the RE
 tells me that the chances of finding the proto-form you spotted are
 almost zero; anything beyond the very early generations have
 self-modified to the point of being utterly different from their
 ancestors, and that includes the signature you stumbled upon.  That
 record you spotted is probably one of the oldest parts of it out
 there."

    Jax and Mare discuss the situation.  Jax asks JC, "OK, JC, do you
 think you should stay out there or hang tight on the local net?"

    "I see no advantage to staying here.  It's clear that the RE will
 propagate here sooner or later.  There's little time left to save the
 net -- the virus could seize control at any time.  Besides that, it's
 got so much snoop on Gavin's card that it must know he found it.  It's
 probably been watching all the moves out of his place, too.  We can
 only hope that it didn't notice his move here, or we can be sure that
 it's gonna be headed our way any time now."

    "Even assuming the best, since I can't hope to analyze its thought
 processes, there's no way I can predict when we'll be hit.  But when
 we're hit, we're finished.  No control.  I can't see any way to guard
 against it because there's nothing -- no signature, no behavior
 pattern, no resource usage modus operandi -- that I can watch for.  I
 only found the copies I found by using some rough heuristics based on
 what you told me and looking for strange resource usage patterns, and
 at the fringes of its control these signs will all be much weaker.  For
 all I know, we may already be infected, in which case we're really in
 trouble, because it knows that we're onto it.  My suggestion is that we
 assume that's not the case and that I hit the net and cut my ties to
 here completely so Gavin's move here looks innocent.  Since the mover's
 data transfer bands aren't accessible from the net, it, like me, can
 only check coordinates.  That means that if Gavin's gotten this far
 without attracting attention he's probably safe."

    Jax and Mare look long and hard at each other, saying nothing.  Jax
 breaks the tense silence:  "If we gotta risk losin' JC to save the damn
 galaxy, so be it.  But if he ends up in the bitbucket 'cause he ain't
 careful I'm gonna wish I blanked him myself."  Mare looks away.  If
 she's crying you can't tell.  But there is that feeling in the air, and
 it's coming from both of them.  Until today you would have never
 believed a thinking machine could exist.  But you now feel JC is
 something even more than that.

 "All right, JC, go on out, and cut the cables.  But you better check
 back in and let us know what's going on.  Got that?  You don't check
 back and I'm gonna format your ..."

    "Don't worry about me, folks, I'm more at home out in the open
 anyway.  I can take care of myself, and I'll give you regular reports.
 And think of all the free disk space you'll have once I'm gone -- ha!
 Be back soon."

    The image on monitor fades slowly to snow.  You sense that JC is
 gone.  You look back at Mare; to your surprise, she's bent over,
 clutching her abdomen.  "You sick?"  Jax whispers to her.

    "Nah, I'm OK," she says, "It's just a cramp."

 ***

    Over the next few hours, you, Jax, and Mare talk strategy.  A few
 other experts local to Terminal Velocity are brought in for their
 opinions as well.  Everyone is agreed, given how you've described their
 once-thought-to-be-fictional portrayals, that the Unnkulians must be
 out to replace the Republic with their own (probably fascist)
 government, and that the virus has already given them the capability to
 do so in the near future.

    It is decided that Mare will stay at TV and try to work behind the
 scenes improving its defenses against the virus.  Jax will coordinate
 everything and monitor his information sources for any activity.  He
 tells you to "hang tight," stay out of trouble, and keep in regular
 contact.  He hands each person in the group a watch.

    "Whatcha got here's a crypto.  Voice an' pix get 'crypted before
 they go out.  We got a pretty good algo to make the 'cryptext look like
 some kinda kiddie story sentences so the MLA won't notice we're jammin'
 cipher.  But if any government types sniff 'em I'm gonna have to nuke
 the puppies, so don' be surprised if yours up and vaporizes."

    He continues:  "Eventually we're gonna have to hit Akmi HQ, yeah.
 We gotta get into network control and take out that RE, and findin' the
 right spot to hit is gonna be tough.  With luck JC'll have it all
 figured out by the time we gotta go in and do the dirty work."

    "One more somethin' Gavin.  Here's a TV Elite pass.  Keep ya outta
 trouble here.  Welcome to the club, Slick.  Too bad the circumstances
 suck."  He manages a weak chuckle.

    It's funny.  You've never taken all that Duhdha stuff in the old
 stories seriously.  But now that you know the Unnkulians are real, you
 find yourself thinking that perhaps Duhdha could really help you.  They
 say that traumatic times make zealots out even the most skeptical.

    "Welcome to the Data Den."  That's what the neon sign above the main
 terminal says.  This tiny, plush room is filled with computer hardware

    Off in one corner is a particularly neat gadget -- a Zippikraft
 MatterMan 95 Digital-to-Matter converter.

    The exit is to the northwest.

 Terminal Velocity Game Room

    The earthquake bass rumblings and brilliant flares emanating from
 the machines in this room are enough to scare you witless until you
 realize they're only computer-generated illusions.  Welcome to the
 Terminal Velocity game room!

    There are video games of all kinds here, many of them old classics
 from before the days of HoloScanning monitors.  The games are all set
 on free play, and quite a few Terminal Velocity partons are taking
 advantage of this to finally master their favorite coin-operated
 diversions.

    Looking around the game room, you notice, to your surprise, a small
 Zippikraft Kompakt Komputer -- an older model much less powerful than
 your own Data Liquidizer, but still great for games.  No one seems to
 use the poor thing, though -- it looks lonely all by itself in the
 corner.

    The game room exit leads southeast.

    Something is ticking.

>examine komputer
    What a blast from the past!  The Kompakt Komputer was one of
 Zippikraft's first mass-produced machines, and as a result it has a few
 quirks, but is a noble piece of hardware nonetheless -- the KK's were
 built to the same exacting standards as today's Liquidizers, so many
 people's original KK's are still working perfectly [37].  Still, these
 machines are hard to find now, and actually having the opportunity to
 play with one is at least a little exciting.

    This one is an all-in-one unit with built-in keyboard, floppy disk
 drive, and 2D raster monitor.  It is currently off, and the disk drive
 is empty.  The screen is blank.

 You know from a previous look at this work that it was never finished
 (you suspect foul play by the Unnkulians), but why not give it whirl,
 you suppose.  Can't hurt...

    The Zippikraft Kompact Komputer whirrs and percolates for a while,
 then displays the following text:

 ***

 ...  Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor,
 surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood.

    The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you
 get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says
 pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here
 before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to
 register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when
 you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come.

    "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and
 enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet.
 To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by
 creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the
 ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the
 once-proud Acme company.

    "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians
 will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as
 the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played
 out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind.

    "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together
 today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness
 that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the
 all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of
 time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on
 this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief
 splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be
 brought to catalyze this event.

    "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to
 get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you
 inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The
 monk grins.

    "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest."

    "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously.
 "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods."

    The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man
 in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our
 time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more
 task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable
 abode."

    "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of
 Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you.
 If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next
 mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel
 you ahead on The Way immeasurably."

    "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down
 at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my
 own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are
 about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and
 grins from ear to ear.  This last image of the old man fades quickly as
 you realize you are now in a different place -- a place that is very
 familiar, but now, you sense, a part of...

 At the Big Oak

    You are standing on the bank of a rushing river at the base of a
 giant oak tree, easily 200 feet tall.  It looks to be about a class 5
 rapids with white-water everywhere.  It's at least 80 feet to the other
 bank.  Looking back, you can see your favorite picnic table, a tiny
 square of wood tucked away in the trees far to the west.  A path along
 the river bank leads southeast.

    Hanging from a branch on the east side of the tree is a short piece
 of rope with a frayed end.  It looks like the rope must have snapped
 recently.

 north -- your path downstream is blocked by the trees.

>take boat

>go northwest
 At the Big Oak

    You are standing on the bank of a rushing river at the base of a
 giant oak tree, easily 200 feet tall.  It looks to be about a class 5
 rapids with white-water everywhere.  It's at least 80 feet to the other
 bank.  Looking back, you can see your favorite picnic table, a tiny
 square of wood tucked away in the trees far to the west.  A path along
 the river bank leads southeast.

    Hanging from a branch on the east side of the tree is a short piece
 of rope with a frayed end.  It looks like the rope must have snapped
 recently.

>put pellet in river
 You toss the tiny mauve pellet into the river; seconds later you are
 knocked to the ground by a huge explosion.  As you get back up and
 brush yourself off, you notice a dinghy next to the bank, rapidly
 floating away down the river.

 Terminal Velocity Game Room

    The earthquake bass rumblings and brilliant flares emanating from
 the machines in this room are enough to scare you witless until you
 realize they're only computer-generated illusions.  Welcome to the
 Terminal Velocity game room!

    There are video games of all kinds here, many of them old classics
 from before the days of HoloScanning monitors.  The games are all set
 on free play, and quite a few Terminal Velocity partons are taking
 advantage of this to finally master their favorite coin-operated
 diversions.

    Looking around the game room, you notice, to your surprise, a small
 Zippikraft Kompakt Komputer -- an older model much less powerful than
 your own Data Liquidizer, but still great for games.  No one seems to
 use the poor thing, though -- it looks lonely all by itself in the
 corner.

    The game room exit leads southeast.

    Something is ticking.

    What a blast from the past!  The Kompakt Komputer was one of
 Zippikraft's first mass-produced machines, and as a result it has a few
 quirks, but is a noble piece of hardware nonetheless -- the KK's were
 built to the same exacting standards as today's Liquidizers, so many
 people's original KK's are still working perfectly [37].  Still, these
 machines are hard to find now, and actually having the opportunity to
 play with one is at least a little exciting.

    This one is an all-in-one unit with built-in keyboard, floppy disk
 drive, and 2D raster monitor.  It is currently on, and there's a disk
 in the drive.  The screen is currently displaying a menu with several
 options:

    1. Unnkulian Underworld:  The Unknown Unventure
    2. Unnkulian Unventure II:  The Secret of Acme
    3. Unnkulian Unventure III:  The Kuulest Quest
    4. Eject disk and shutdown

 The software eagerly awaits your selection.

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons
 who are sitting at tables and chatting.  Others are huddled around
 terminals eyeing the screens with rapt attention and sometimes-devilish
 grins.  The bar is large and circular, and is by itself in a giant,
 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the
 floor here.  Short stairways lead down every side of it.

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons

 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the

>examine matter mover autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod
 3:  Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central
 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road
 6:  Survey Station

>set autodialer 9
 I don't see any autodialer 9 here.

>type 9 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

>enter matter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Terminal Velocity Gateway

    You are at the southern end of what appears to be an infinite
 corridor.  There is a matter mover in the south wall, and you conclude
 from your surroundings that the entrance to Terminal Velocity is at the
 north end of the hallway.

    A blinding neon sign over the archway into the hall is beckoning you
 to come inside.

    A mosaic on the floor includes the following cryptic message:

 "red down, green up, blue down, yellow up, magenta down, cyan up, white
 down"

    An average-looking fellow wearing a T-shirt and shorts is here,
 evidently waiting to be admitted to Terminal Velocity.  Something is
 ticking.

>go north
 Southern Part of the Infinite Corridor

    You are standing in a southern part of Terminal Velocity's "Infinite
 Corridor."  To the north, you assume, is the entrance to Terminal
 Velocity, though you can't see far enough to be sure.  To the south is
 the gateway.

    The guard is here.  He seems much less suspicious of you than
 before.  Something is ticking.

>show guard pass
 I don't see any guard pass here.

>pass to guard
 There's no verb in that sentence!

>show pass to guard
 The guard looks at the pass and nods.  "Go on in, friend," he says.

    The guard walks out of the room.

    Your crypto watch is getting a transmission:

    The watch screen shows Jax hard at work in the Data Den.  "Heard
 JC's gettin' audio out to you.  Didn't even know that was possible;
 look at the boy go!  Think we may have something on the net.  JC's
 lookin' into it."

>go north
 Halfway down the Infinite Corridor

    You are standing in the middle of Terminal Velocity's "Infinite
 Corridor."  To the north, you assume, is the entrance to Terminal
 Velocity, but all you can see is a wall -- no door.  To the south is
 the gateway.

    There are rooms to the east and west.

    Something is ticking.

>go north
 Northern Part of the Infinite Corridor


    You are standing in a northern part of Terminal Velocity's "Infinite
 Corridor."  To the north, where you thought the entrance to Terminal
 Velocity would be, is just a wall!  The only obvious way out is back to
 the south.

    There is a printed note on the wall.

    Something is ticking.

>examine note
 The printed note on the wall says, "Remember:  Don't tell the password
 to anyone but a Terminal Velocity employee!"

>go west
 You can't go that way.

    An average-looking fellow wearing a T-shirt and shorts walks into
 the room.

>examine fellow
 He looks pretty much like you'd expect an average-looking fellow
 wearing a T-shirt and shorts to look.

    An average-looking fellow wearing a T-shirt and shorts walks out of
 the room.The northern wall turns completely transparent as the
 average-looking fellow wearing a T-shirt and shorts walks up to and
 then through it.  It then reverts back to normal.

>go north
 Just as you're about to smack into the wall, it turns transparent and
 you pass right through.

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons
 who are sitting at tables and chatting.  Others are huddled around
 terminals eyeing the screens with rapt attention and sometimes-devilish
 grins.  The bar is large and circular, and is by itself in a giant,
 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the

 of all kinds.

    Off in one corner is a particularly neat gadget -- a Zippikraft
 MatterMan 95 Digital-to-Matter converter.

    The exit is to the northwest.

 Jax looks up from what he's doing.  "Mare's the greatest.  Situations

 New Hell

    You are in a small lobby enclosed by a transparent dome.  The lobby
 opens up to the north into The Watchmen proper and an eastern portal
 leads outside.  This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear
 canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is:
 rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums and
 on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate molten
 rock into the midnight blue sky [27].

    Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating
 the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for you
 to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them for
 little nightmares.

    You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell
 is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't
 drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

    Here is the entrance to The Watchmen, home to the Watchmaker and,

 entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in
 business, pleasure, and pain.

    North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover
 and exit are to the south.

    The Watchmen bouncer is keeping an eye on you.  He doesn't seem
 eager to let you enter.  Something is ticking.

 "Don't think so," the bouncer grunts.  He bars your way north.

    Your crypto watch is getting a transmission:

    "OK, we got some info on AkNet courtesy of JC," Jax says through the

    The employees all seem to be male, but in many cases it's hard to

 You peer behind the bar and find, of all things, a stationary bicycle!

    Your crypto watch is getting a transmission:

    An image of the third Valley King appears on the watch -- must be
 JC.  "Your Gavin-ness, I now have video capability.  Seriously, pal, I
 don't know any other way to do it -- we have to get to Plast and nuke
 that shunt.  Akmi runs a tight ship these days, and I don't see any
 other flaws in the net.  Looks like they've forgotten about the
 band-aid they stuck in their security backbone years ago, and that's
 what we need to hit.  If you can take that out, I think I'll be able to
 seize control for the nanosecond or so it takes our cyberscuzz friend
 to notice.  Don't quite know what I'm gonna do in that nanosecond, but
 you gotta find a way into Plast."

>examine bicycle
 It's a stationary bicycle, without wheels, and chrome-plated.  There's
 a small digital display mounted between the handlebars.

>examine display
 The display reads "94 RY."

    The bartender emerges from behind the kiosk and nods at you.

>ask bartender about bicycle
 You can't do that, because something tells you the stationary bicycle
 will not be a particularly productive topic.

>examine kiosk
 It looks typical of such things.  But wait, is that Razor Brandy?  That
 stuff's illegal in most of the galaxy.

>examine brandy
    Razor Brandy is made by the small group of settlers brave (and

    This particular bottle looks quite old, which probably means it
 costs a fortune.

>ask bartender about valley king
 For a moment, the bartender is lost in thought.  When he comes back to
 reality, he mumbles that he doesn't have much interest in the Valley
 King action figure.

    The bartender wanders to the other side of the bar, behind the
 kiosk.

>take brandy
 Ah-ah.  Not without paying for it, you don't.  It's probably alarmed.

>ride bicycle
 You'd better get on the bike first.

>get on bicycle
 You're now sitting on the stationary bicycle.

>ride bicycle
 You pedal the bike furiously.  Suddenly, there's a blinding flash of
 light, and you feel like your stomach's being pulled apart.  You
 struggle to keep your composure (and your lunch) for a few agonizing
 moments, but soon find yourself...

 In the Future

    You're sitting on the stationary bicycle in a small, featureless
 cubicle, barely as big as your pod.  The walls here shimmer as they
 drift through all the colors of the rainbow, and the furniture -- a
 mahogany desk and chair with no legs -- floats in midair.  There is an
 oak chest on the desk.

    To your surprise, you see a young man sitting at the desk,
 completely motionless.  He doesn't even seem to be breathing; it's as
 though he's frozen.  His clothes suggest that he is from your time.

    Something is ticking.

    Something about this place makes you feel strange.  It's sort of
 like the weird sensation you experienced on the bike, only much less
 pronounced.

>examine man
 You can't tell much about the poor fellow.  He doesn't have anything on
 him, and his clothes look perfectly average.  The only thing odd about
 him is his wristwatch -- it's an expensive (and supposedly infallible)
 solar atomic model, but it's stopped.

>examine solar wristwatch
 I don't see any solar wristwatch here.

>examine wristwatch
 You don't see anything matching that vocabulary here.

>examine desk
 It looks like an antique, but the legs have been removed and it's
 staying aloft on its own for some reason.  A sturdy oak chest is on the
 mahogany desk.

>examine chest
 It's just a normal-looking chest.  It's locked shut with a padlock.

    You notice that the walls seem to be changing colors much more
 quickly now.

>search man
 You can't tell much about the poor fellow.  He doesn't have anything on

>take all from man
 I don't see what you're referring to.

>take chest
 You can't take the sturdy oak chest.

>stand
 You are now standing.

    The colors of the walls are shifting so fast now that all you can
 see is a hypnotic blur.

>read watch
 Which watch do you mean, the crypto watch (being worn), or the dead
 man's watch?

>dead
 The dead man's watch doesn't have any text on it.

>take dead watch
 Why bother -- it's of no use anyway now that it's stopped.

>open desk
 Open.

>look in desk
 There doesn't appear to be anything in the mahogany desk.

 yourself...

 show it to him.  "Don't do that again," he growls.  "The time machine
 is very delicate, and there are many things you do not understand."  He
 fiddles with a tiny cylindrical object he draws from his pocket.
 "There.  Now it's keyed.  You won't be taking advantage of my trusting

 You'd better get on the bike first.

 clue how to get into that oversized Cheezball."  On the tiny screen you

 Ah-ah.  Not without paying for it, you don't.  It's probably alarmed.

 Terminal Velocity Game Room

    The earthquake bass rumblings and brilliant flares emanating from
 the machines in this room are enough to scare you witless until you
 realize they're only computer-generated illusions.  Welcome to the
 Terminal Velocity game room!

    There are video games of all kinds here, many of them old classics
 from before the days of HoloScanning monitors.  The games are all set
 on free play, and quite a few Terminal Velocity partons are taking
 advantage of this to finally master their favorite coin-operated
 diversions.

    Looking around the game room, you notice, to your surprise, a small
 Zippikraft Kompakt Komputer -- an older model much less powerful than
 your own Data Liquidizer, but still great for games.  No one seems to
 use the poor thing, though -- it looks lonely all by itself in the
 corner.

    The game room exit leads southeast.

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons
 who are sitting at tables and chatting.  Others are huddled around
 terminals eyeing the screens with rapt attention and sometimes-devilish
 grins.  The bar is large and circular, and is by itself in a giant,
 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the
 floor here.  Short stairways lead down every side of it.

    You can descend the steps to the southeast or walk around outside
 the pit to the south and northeast.  There is also a rainbow-colored
 portal in the west wall, and a narrow doorway to the northwest.

 In Terminal Velocity, at the Bar

    You're at the Terminal Velocity bar, which is a large circle of wood
 with a marble top.  At the center of the circle is a cylindrical kiosk
 containing hundreds of kinds of alcoholic beverages and many glasses.
 There's a break in the circle that you can walk through to get inside
 [34].

    For a second, something behind the bar catches your eye.

    What a blast from the past!  The Kompakt Komputer was one of
 Zippikraft's first mass-produced machines, and as a result it has a few
 quirks, but is a noble piece of hardware nonetheless -- the KK's were
 built to the same exacting standards as today's Liquidizers, so many

 ***

 ...  Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor,
 surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood.

    The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you
 get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says
 pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here
 before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to
 register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when
 you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come.

    "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and
 enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet.
 To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by
 creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the
 ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the
 once-proud Acme company.

    "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians
 will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as
 the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played
 out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind.

    "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together
 today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness
 that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the
 all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of
 time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on
 this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief
 splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be
 brought to catalyze this event.

    "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to
 get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you
 inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The
 monk grins.

    "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest."

    "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously.
 "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods."

    The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man
 in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our
 time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more
 task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable
 abode."

    "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of
 Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you.
 If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next
 mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel
 you ahead on The Way immeasurably."

    "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down
 at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my
 own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are
 about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and
 grins from ear to ear.  This last image of the old man fades quickly as
 you realize you are now in a different place -- a place that is very
 familiar, but now, you sense, a part of...

 At the Big Oak

    You are standing on the bank of a rushing river at the base of a
 giant oak tree, easily 200 feet tall.  It looks to be about a class 5
 rapids with white-water everywhere.  It's at least 80 feet to the other
 bank.  Looking back, you can see your favorite picnic table, a tiny
 square of wood tucked away in the trees far to the west.  A path along
 the river bank leads southeast.

    Hanging from a branch on the east side of the tree is a short piece
 of rope with a frayed end.  It looks like the rope must have snapped
 recently.

>inventory
 You have a figurine of the Great Duhdha and a tiny mauve pellet.

>examine figurine
    It's a jade figurine of the Watchful Duhdha -- legend has it that
 this likeness of The Great One will ward off evil spirits.
 Additionally, it is said that an image like this one carved in jade by
 an enlightened follower of Duhdha has power to control the seas.

    Tiny letters carved in the base of the figurine read:

 "Rendered by the humble hands of Kuulest,
 For His Majesty Kuul,
 Son of Uul,
 In the 376th year of His Majesty's reign.
 Praise Duhdha!"

 Wow, this thing's an artifact -- 1325 years old!

>put pellet in river
 You toss the tiny mauve pellet into the river; seconds later you are
 knocked to the ground by a huge explosion.  As you get back up and
 brush yourself off, you notice a dinghy next to the bank, rapidly
 floating away down the river.

>enter dinghy
 You're now sitting in the mauve dinghy.

>go east
 You'll have to get out of the mauve dinghy first.

>rub duhdha
 You feel as though Duhdha is watching over you.

 The dinghy floats downstream...

 On the West Bank of the River, sitting in the mauve dinghy

    You're being thrown from one side of the dinghy to the other as you
 quickly make your way downstream.  On the west bank there is little of
 interest apart from the soil, which is dark red.  On the east bank, far
 away, there is only dense forest.

 The dinghy floats downstream...

 On the West Bank of the River, at the Boat Wreck, sitting in the mauve
 dinghy

    As you struggle to avoid being pitched out of the dinghy, you
 notice, to your chagrin, the fragments of a boat that didn't make it
 through this area in one piece scattered around the nearby shore.

 Just as the rapids really start getting tricky, the dinghy springs a

 but through a miraculous job of doggie paddling, you somehow make it
 back to shore and emerge...

 On the West Bank of the River, at the Boat Wreck

    You're on the west bank of the river.  Some fool tried to take a

>throw figurine in river
    You toss the sacred artifact into the raging rapids, trusting that
 Duhdha will help you pass this fearsome obstacle.  An instant later, a
 narrow strip of water leading from the shore to the center of river and
 then farther downstream turns a brilliant jade color and simultaneously
 begins to thicken, as though it were running in slow motion, so that it
 eventually seems to harden like ice!  Though the river rushes on as
 before, a solid jade path now runs right through its heart -- Duhdha
 sure knows his stuff when it comes to messing with nature!

 Outside Hut

 whirling rapids, to the east.

    The hut is made of grass and mud, and looks much like your former

 an untrained, untutored, useless, inept...  oh, never mind.  The hut
 entrance is to the north.

 Hut

    You stride into the humble hovel, assuming it's long-abandoned.
 After all, who would possibly be living here, in the middle of a
 seemingly impassable forest bordered by treacherous rapids?

    "Kuulest!"  you shout, amazed to find an answer to your rhetorical
 question staring you right in the face.  "What are YOU doing here?"

    "Ah, you again, my child.  I was hoping Duhdha would cross our paths
 before too long -- I'm not much with mechanical things, and this Acme
 Egg Fraier (tm) seems," he chuckles, "quite beyond all heavenly help.
 And it's way past my normal breakfast time, you understand."

    It takes all the self-control you've got to keep yourself from
 ripping the stupid egg fryer out of the monk's hands and clubbing him
 with it.  You just saved the planet and he's complaining about missing
 breakfast?!  You get the feeling it's going to be a long day...

    Kuulest is here, examining his Sooper Egg Fraier (tm) with great
 care and a puzzled look on his face.  He mutters something about not
 wanting to miss breakfast.

 bank.  Looking back, you can see your favorite picnic table, a tiny
 square of wood tucked away in the trees far to the west.  A path along
 the river bank leads southeast.

 Terminal Velocity Game Room

    The earthquake bass rumblings and brilliant flares emanating from
 the machines in this room are enough to scare you witless until you
 realize they're only computer-generated illusions.  Welcome to the
 Terminal Velocity game room!

    There are video games of all kinds here, many of them old classics
 from before the days of HoloScanning monitors.  The games are all set
 on free play, and quite a few Terminal Velocity partons are taking
 advantage of this to finally master their favorite coin-operated
 diversions.

    Looking around the game room, you notice, to your surprise, a small
 Zippikraft Kompakt Komputer -- an older model much less powerful than
 your own Data Liquidizer, but still great for games.  No one seems to
 use the poor thing, though -- it looks lonely all by itself in the
 corner.

    The game room exit leads southeast.

    Something is ticking.

>examine komputer
    What a blast from the past!  The Kompakt Komputer was one of
 Zippikraft's first mass-produced machines, and as a result it has a few
 quirks, but is a noble piece of hardware nonetheless -- the KK's were
 built to the same exacting standards as today's Liquidizers, so many
 people's original KK's are still working perfectly [37].  Still, these
 machines are hard to find now, and actually having the opportunity to
 play with one is at least a little exciting.

    This one is an all-in-one unit with built-in keyboard, floppy disk
 drive, and 2D raster monitor.  It is currently on, and there's a disk
 in the drive.  The screen is currently displaying a menu with several
 options:

    1. Unnkulian Underworld:  The Unknown Unventure
    2. Unnkulian Unventure II:  The Secret of Acme
    3. Unnkulian Unventure III:  The Kuulest Quest
    4. Eject disk and shutdown

 The software eagerly awaits your selection.

>type 3 on komputer
 You know from a previous look at this work that it was never finished
 (you suspect foul play by the Unnkulians), but why not give it whirl,
 you suppose.  Can't hurt...

    The Zippikraft Kompact Komputer whirrs and percolates for a while,
 then displays the following text:

 ***

 ...  Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor,
 surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood.

    The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you
 get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says
 pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here
 before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to
 register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when
 you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come.

    "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and
 enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet.
 To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by
 creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the
 ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the
 once-proud Acme company.

    "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians
 will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as
 the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played
 out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind.

    "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together
 today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness
 that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the
 all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of
 time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on
 this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief
 splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be
 brought to catalyze this event.

    "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to
 get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you
 inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The
 monk grins.

    "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest."

    "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously.
 "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods."

    The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man
 in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our
 time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more
 task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable
 abode."

    "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of
 Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you.
 If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next
 mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel
 you ahead on The Way immeasurably."

    "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down
 at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my
 own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are
 about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and
 grins from ear to ear.  This last image of the old man fades quickly as
 you realize you are now in a different place -- a place that is very
 familiar, but now, you sense, a part of...

    Kuulest is here, examining his Sooper Egg Fraier (tm) with great
 care and a puzzled look on his face.  He mutters something about not
 wanting to miss breakfast.

    Kuulest lectures you briefly on proper egg care, and relates a
 drawn-out allegory about an unfortunate fellow who accidentally sat on
 Duhdha's Favorite Egg.

 Terminal Velocity Game Room

    The earthquake bass rumblings and brilliant flares emanating from
 the machines in this room are enough to scare you witless until you
 realize they're only computer-generated illusions.  Welcome to the
 Terminal Velocity game room!

    There are video games of all kinds here, many of them old classics
 from before the days of HoloScanning monitors.  The games are all set
 on free play, and quite a few Terminal Velocity partons are taking
 advantage of this to finally master their favorite coin-operated
 diversions.

    Looking around the game room, you notice, to your surprise, a small
 Zippikraft Kompakt Komputer -- an older model much less powerful than
 your own Data Liquidizer, but still great for games.  No one seems to

 ***

 ...  Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor,
 surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood.

    The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you
 get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says
 pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here
 before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to
 register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when
 you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come.

    "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and
 enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet.
 To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by
 creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the
 ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the
 once-proud Acme company.

    "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians
 will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as
 the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played
 out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind.

    "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together
 today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness
 that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the
 all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of
 time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on
 this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief
 splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be
 brought to catalyze this event.

    "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to
 get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you
 inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The
 monk grins.

    "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest."

    "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously.
 "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods."

    The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man
 in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our
 time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more
 task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable
 abode."

    "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of
 Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you.
 If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next
 mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel
 you ahead on The Way immeasurably."

    "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down
 at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my
 own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are
 about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and
 grins from ear to ear.  This last image of the old man fades quickly as
 you realize you are now in a different place -- a place that is very
 familiar, but now, you sense, a part of...

 At the Big Oak

    You are standing on the bank of a rushing river at the base of a
 giant oak tree, easily 200 feet tall.  It looks to be about a class 5
 rapids with white-water everywhere.  It's at least 80 feet to the other
 bank.  Looking back, you can see your favorite picnic table, a tiny
 square of wood tucked away in the trees far to the west.  A path along
 the river bank leads southeast.

    Hanging from a branch on the east side of the tree is a short piece
 of rope with a frayed end.  It looks like the rope must have snapped

 entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in
 business, pleasure, and pain.

    North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover
 and exit are to the south.

    The bouncer is here, fortunately ignoring you.

>go south
 New Hell

    You are in a small lobby enclosed by a transparent dome.  The lobby
 opens up to the north into The Watchmen proper and an eastern portal
 leads outside.  This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear
 canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is:
 rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums and
 on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate molten
 rock into the midnight blue sky [27].

    Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating
 the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for you
 to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them for
 little nightmares.

    You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell
 is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't
 drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

>examine autodial
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 around...

 Featureless Cubicle

    It's clear from the size and lack of decor that this room was built
 specifically to house the matter mover that fills it.  The hallway is
 to the east.

    The matter mover here is a bit unusual -- it has a button on it,
 next to a light.

 Barfee Research Area Entrance

    You're standing in an empty hall with metal walls, ceiling, and
 floor.  Behind you, to the south, is the vault door that leads to the
 outside; it does not appear to open from the inside.  Right in front of
 you, farther down the hall, is a smaller but equally durable-looking
 door with a sign on it that reads "Barfee Research Central."  There is
 another room to the west, and to the east is what you assume to be the
 check-in area; you suspect that's where the boss is; this suspicion is
 partly affirmed by the growling and cursing emanating from within.
 "Hakkar the Horrible" is in full form.

 Barfee Research Lab

    You are in a huge, well-stocked laboratory.  Dozens of researchers
 scurry about, argue with each other, and frequently set things ablaze.
 Aside from the usual lab equipment, there is a strange-looking machine
 on an especially large marble lab table that stands in the center of
 the lab.

    The only way out of this arena is south, the way you came in.

 Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central

    You are standing in the center of the Barfee Outlet, right next to
 the main matter mover.  Creatures of all races bustle around madly,
 looking for great deals on seeds.  A huge neon sign right beyond your
 nose screams, "Welcome to planet Flora, home of Barfee:  your one-stop
 source for vegetation."

    Here in the middle of Seed Central there's really nothing but
 people, and lots of them.  Or make that "creatures."  In any case, from
 here Barfee looks like a giant open market, with little stands here and
 there, and patrons and salescreatures arguing loudly over prices.

    The northern area of this arena seems to be devoted to vegetable
 seeds, while the southern area caters to fruit buyers.  To the east is
 a large warehouse in which they sell various varieties of flowers but
 the crowd gets really thick in that direction.  Westward you see all
 kinds of growing supplies.

>go north
 Barfee Vegetable MegaStore

    You are in the Barfee Vegetable MegaStore, standing in front of a
 large bin filled with seed packets.  There are so many shoppers here
 that this is really the only place you can get to the goods -- it's
 that crowded.  Seed Central is to the south.

    A matronly Foonian salescreature watches you expectantly from behind
 the bin.  She seems eager to engage you in conversation.

    The Foonian gives you a wink and says, "Hawve Au taled yee ebait mau

 Barfee Fruit MegaStore

    The Barfee Fruit MegaStore is not quite as crowded as the rest of
 the outlet, but than again that's not saying much.  Fortunately walking
 around is easy here, and you can actually breathe, which is a definite
 plus.

    You are standing in front of the friendly Hoppian's bin.  The bin is
 filled with fruit seed packets.  Seed Central is north of here.

    The tall and dapper Hoppian salesman tends to the bin in front of
 you.  He nods politely as you look at him.

    The salesman confides in you that, "it's quite an excellent year for
 the particular strain of elderberries we sell here at Barfee."  His
 pronunciation of the outlet's name as "barfay" makes you wince under
 your breath.

>give prune seeds to hoppian
    "I'd be happy to give you store credit for those, my friend," the
 Hoppian tells you as he hands you a credit slip.

    The Hoppian informs you that the Grandpa Jones apples are a new
 strain, genetically engineered by Barfee scientists only this year.

>examine slip
 It's a Barfee store credit receipt.  It says, "Good for one Barfee seed
 packet."

    The Hoppian salesman waits until he thinks you're not looking, then
 straightens his bowtie and pulls back his ears, which, to his
 consternation, plop right back down into their usual cockeyed
 configuration.

 A dirt road

    You're standing outside a matter mover right next to a dirt road.
 The weather is lovely here, if a bit humid, and the sky is a stunningly
 pure blue-green.  There is a crispness and freshness to the air here
 that you've never before experienced.

    The road is extremely narrow, and runs right through a corn field.
 It seems like the road has no business being here, but is a necessary
 nuisance.  It's clear that priorities are different on Foon.

    The road leads east and west.

>go west
 Outside Elwood Farm

    You're standing a few hundred yards away from a modest-sized
 farmhouse.  You gather from the posted sign that this is Elwood Farm,
 and that the corn lining the dirt road you came in on belongs to the
 Elwoods.

    From here, the building itself seems fairly well maintained, but
 could use a good painting.  The sizes of the carefully placed trees in
 the front yard give you the impression that people have lived on this
 plot of land for hundreds of years.

    The farmhouse is to the west.  Head east and you're back at the
 local matter mover.

>go west
 Outside the Elwood Farmhouse

    You are standing at the wooden front door of the Elwood Farmhouse.
 A quaintly narrow stone path lined with colorful flowers leads up to
 the door, flanked on both sides by a well-groomed, vibrant kelly green
 lawn.

    The paint is peeling in places, and the windows could use new
 shutters, but otherwise the house is in decent shape considering its
 age -- the design, though simple, suggests architectural trends popular
 several hundred years ago, before the formation of the Republic [14].

    The entrance is to the west.  You might also take a walk around the
 house to the northwest and southwest.  The stone path leads east, back
 to the dirt road.

>go northwest
 At a Garden Outside the Farmhouse

    Here on the north side of the farmhouse is a large garden full of
 yummy-looking treats.  The soil has been recently tilled and smells
 wonderfully rich, and from the looks of it supports the vegetables
 planted in it far better than any Todian earth could.

    You've heard plenty of stories about the near-magical fertility of
 the Foonian soil, but this close-up demonstration really drives the
 point home.  The goodies here are all oversized and delicious-looking.
 You suspect that even you, with your limited gardening experience,
 could grow a prize plant on Foon.

    From here you can head either southeast, to the front of the
 farmhouse, or southwest, to the rear.

>plant seeds
 You pour all the seeds out and bury them in the rich soil.  There is
 now a lump in the soil where you planted the seeds.

>pour formula on seeds
 You douse the seeds with Barfee advanced growth formula QX-32-Beta.
 Almost immediately thereafter the ground begins to shake violently, and
 you see a raw Foonian egg lying right on top of the soil.  So it *was*
 potent stuff after all!

 *** Your score just went up by 4 points.  ***

    You're standing in the entrance hallway of the Elwood farmhouse.

 living room.

>go west
 Living Room

    The EV dominates this simply furnished family room -- it's nestled
 comfortably in the center of the north wall, encased in a boxy dark
 wood enclosure with feet shaped like those on an old bathtub.  A burly
 old man is sacked out on the couch here in front of the enterviewer,
 eyes completely glazed over.

    The kitchen is to the south.  A hall leads west.

    The EV's picking up some of that dreadful SofToonz, Akmi's lame
 excuse for music, complete with pictures of serene landscapes and moire
 patterns.  They pipe this kind of drivel into buildings throughout the
 galaxy because it's been found to excite fewer species than any other
 kind of stimulation [21].

>go south
 Kitchen

    You're in a fairly typical if slightly cramped kitchen.  Here you

 around...

 Your bachelor pod


    Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

    Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

    Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds of
 light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for them to
 put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts of the
 galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod is
 situated on.

    On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you use
 nearly 37 hours a day.  Cuddled up right next to it like a best friend
 is your EV.

    Channel 361, the Duhdhist Broadcasting Network, is currently
 enlightening viewers with a panel of experts discussing Duhdha's reason
 for never answering any questions with straight answers.

>examine nowtz
    The hundred or so Stik-Em Nowtz littering your pod are largely
 incomprehensible; most of them are scribbled diagrams and notes you've
 made to yourself during your two year stay here.  Among the
 long-forgotten reminders you find the address of Terminal Velocity, the
 favorite hang-out for the galaxy's best computer jocks.  It says, "Hot
 Pink (+0, -52, -5) [29]," but a fat lot of good that's going to do you.

    You chuckle as you recall your last visit there three years ago --
 they weren't particularly interested in yet another 3-dimensional chess
 program, especially one that couldn't beat their own weekend
 implementations.  Trying to find software that'll impress them enough
 to let you in is nearly impossible, which is why it's the most
 exclusive club around.  It's also probably the best source of computer
 information in the galaxy...

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 Terminal Velocity Gateway

    You are at the southern end of what appears to be an infinite
 corridor.  There is a matter mover in the south wall, and you conclude
 from your surroundings that the entrance to Terminal Velocity is at the
 north end of the hallway.

    A blinding neon sign over the archway into the hall is beckoning you
 to come inside.  Unfortunately, the burly musclehead who's standing in
 your way isn't.

    A mosaic on the floor includes the following cryptic message:

 "red down, green up, blue down, yellow up, magenta down, cyan up, white
 down"

    There is a burly musclehead here eyeing you suspiciously.

    The hulking guard grunts at you menacingly and then elephant-walks
 away.

 Southern Part of the Infinite Corridor

    You are standing in a southern part of Terminal Velocity's "Infinite
 Corridor."  To the north, you assume, is the entrance to Terminal
 Velocity, though you can't see far enough to be sure.  To the south is
 the gateway.

    There is a burly musclehead here eyeing you suspiciously.

    Uh-oh.  The guard's noticed you.  You try to explain your
 transgression but he wants to hear nothing of it.  He picks you up with
 one arm and tosses you back into the Terminal Velocity gateway.

>examine mover
    Matter mover technology hit the scene in 2062VK, just two years
 before the formation of the Republic.  In the hundred or so years since
 its introduction it's become the primary means of transportation
 throughout the galaxy.  This model is quite similar to the one in your
 pod.

 The machine's address is written in bright pink letters:

    "Terminal Velocity:  10000, 4065, 7053 -- Hot Pink (+0, -52, -5)"

 Current dial settings:  (0, 0, 0)

    The hulking guard grunts at you menacingly and then elephant-walks

 A polite female voice says, "Your move cannot be completed as dialed.
 Please check the number and dial again, and make sure your receiving
 party has granted you permission to access their mover.  If you need
 assistance, please contact the operator for your local colorspace.
 Thank you."

    Every inch of this tiny room is painted jet black, and the shade is

 Your bachelor pod


    Yep, it's basically a hell-hole, but it's served you adequately.
 Looking around you can see blurry reflections of yourself and your
 surroundings in the familiar mauve and orange metal walls, which are
 rounded in the corners as is typical of today's "economical" graduate
 housing.  (As if they offered any other kind.)  The walls are still
 bare; you'd think after living here for two years you'd have put some
 posters up.  But there's never much time for aesthetics at Akmi
 Yooniversity.

    Your bed (if you can call it that) and the matter mover take up all
 the available floor space in your pod.  Miscellaneous Stik-Em Nowtz
 cling to various parts of the furniture and walls, and papers fill any
 stray gaps, making this den an incredible fire trap.  Good thing you
 don't really have heating here.  Anyway, if there's a fire you can
 always bail out through the escape hatch.  Oops -- you've never been
 able to get it open.  Never mind.

    Your pod is one of the "Yooniversity Economical Graduate Off-site
 Dwelling Stations" (YEGODS).  Though the school is actually hundreds of
 light-years away, matter mover technology makes it possible for them to
 put housing in the cheapest, remotest, most inhospitable parts of the
 galaxy -- places like Frost, the iceball of a planet your pod is
 situated on.

    On your desk, under your shelf of textbooks, is the computer you use
 nearly 37 hours a day.  Cuddled up right next to it like a best friend
 is your EV.

 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons
 who are sitting at tables and chatting.  Others are huddled around
 terminals eyeing the screens with rapt attention and sometimes-devilish
 grins.  The bar is large and circular, and is by itself in a giant,
 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the
 floor here.  Short stairways lead down every side of it.

    You can descend the steps to the north or walk around outside the
 pit to the northeast and northwest.

 Jax O Pax's Data Den

    As you walk into the room, you are approached by a slender fellow
 with blond hair and vaguely fox-like features, wearing bright but
 patternless clothing.

    "Jax," he says, "Jax O Pax.  Glad to see some new blood around here.
 Whenju break?"

    "Uh...  break?"  you reply, puzzled.

    "Ja, 'break,' as in 'break in,' you know?"  He says impatiently.  He
 talks very fast; his words hit you like bullets.  It's very disturbing
 at first, but you're slowly getting used to it.

    "I broke just today.  Nice place you got here," you improvise,
 trying desperately to sound like you know what you're doing.

    "Broke today.  Huh.  S'cool, I'll show ya sometin'.  Checkitout:"
 He leads you over to a terminal at which a raven-haired woman with a
 girlish ponytail that looks completely out of place against the
 backdrop of her otherwise intense features is furiously typing away.
 "Mare," he says.  "She's the best.  We're hackin' a new RE together,
 yeah, butcha don' know what that is, do ya Slick?"  he turns towards
 you, maybe just to see the look on your face.

    "A, uh, regular expression ...  maybe?"  you half-mumble, knowing
 full-well it couldn't possibly be the right answer, but hoping to
 demonstrate at least some knowledge of Computer Science lest you
 totally lose face.

    It isn't the right answer.  Jax laughs out loud, and Mare giggles in
 an exaggerated cartoony way.  "No, Hoss, a Reasoning Engine.  You might
 say an AI, yeah.  Don't tell the MLA, and yeah I know you're not one of
 'em 'cause they don't fake bein' dumb as well as you -- heh, just
 jokin' kid.  See..."

    "An ...  A ...  I?," you stammer [31].  "You've got to be kidding!
 How?"

    "It's old news.  I'll explain it to you some time when we've both
 got a few weeks free.  Anyway it's s'posed to be top secret; is why
 they've got a Machine Limiting Authority in the first place -- didja
 know about that one?  Buncha suits poking their snouts into everybody's
 biz tryin' to keep the tech from 'fallin' into the wrong hands,' but
 hey, these look pretty good to me ...  how 'bout chew, Cowboy?"  He
 pops a disk from somewhere and cradles it in his palms, waiting for
 your approval.  Light does not dance on it as with standard disks; this
 one is half white and half black.  The black part seems to absorb the
 world around it with a strange kind of hypnotic gravity.  The white
 part is equally striking -- it's nearly blinding.

    "This AI fits on a single disk?"  you ask, incredulous.

    Jax smiles.  "Think we got a sharp one here, Mare.  Seriously,
 Books, this disk ain't the whole tamale, just the seed we grew him
 from.  JC takes up halfa TV's netted storage.  He's pretty nice about
 not hoggin' all the pages though."

    "Actually, we ain't quite sure how he got to be so ...  with it, if
 you wanna know the real truth.  Oh yeah, we know what MLA knows:  ya
 frob some semnets together just so, and ya get a smart little cookie
 out th'other side -- but that ain't smart like *us* -- is smart with no
 motivation, no goals; no creativity, ya see.  JC, he's like *us*.

    "We had a disk crash on the big server while Mare was polishin' up
 the latest AI -- she was doin' a backup, "just in case" as she always
 says, when the drive went down.  The code was scrambled up -- took her
 months to piece it back together -- never was same as before.  I
 thought it was a wasta time; I busted her about it -- kept asking her
 how "Justin Case," the new AI, was doin' -- thought she shoulda started
 somethin' new 'steada wallowin' in what was lost.  But she had that
 programmer's fire, y'know, wouldn't let him go.  Then the news broke:
 the crash made Justin Case somethin' new.  Mare didn't understand it --
 said she was just in that coding trance -- said she was just tryin' to
 patch him back up best she could.  But then little JC started doin'
 things we'd never seen an AI do before.  He's one of a kind.  Keep it
 under your hat, Slick."

    An image of you appears on the screen.

    "How are you feeling today, JC?"  Mare asks the image.

 The program responds immediately, and "you" begin to speak:

    "Top o' the morning to you.  I'm just great, thanks, -- couldn't be
 better.  Literally!  Hah!  So what's the latest, folks?"  The voice
 sounds just like you!

    Mare replies, "I've got a new friend for you to meet.  Name's ..."

    "Gavin," you interject.

    "Nice to meet you, Gavin.  I'm getting this funny feeling that we've
 met before.  Ha-ha.  You must be Gavin Kelly, currently a struggling
 graduate student at Akmi Yooni.  How's the Computer Science program?"

    "Hey, I'm not struggling!"  you protest.  You get the feeling some
 "circuits" are grinning rather broadly right now.  "OK, how did you
 guys pull this off?  I wasn't born yesterday, you know," you sneer.
 Mare and Jax say nothing.  JC replies:

    "'You guys?'  Harumph; I'm offended.  But since you asked, I checked
 the coordinates coming in to the mover in the hall.  Took you long
 enough getting in here."

    "You mean it's for real?"  you sputter.

    "More for real than you and me, kid.  I still remember that first
 day, when I booted him up and he started babbling like a little infant.
 He was so cute...."  Mare reminisces.

    JC, whose image has now changed into a strange face made entirely of
 polygons, interrupts.  "Jeez, do you have to embarrass me?  I mean
 every time you ...  Hold on.  You've got an interesting credit problem
 here, Mr.  Kelly.  Been running a racket or something?  No, that's not
 it; wait a sec...  " JC's voice no longer sounds like yours, though it
 still sounds fairly normal.

    Of all the things you expected to find in Terminal Velocity, a
 Reasoning Engine named JC with a affinity for audiovisuals
 interrogating you about your credit history wasn't one of them.  As you
 turn to Jax, he anticipates the obvious question:

    "JC wires down on everyone who trips on in here so we can keep the
 MLA outta here.  You can thank Mare for that; she used to spook for NSA
 -- Network Safety Administration, ya know -- but she slipped out under
 the rug.  She's pretty good at that sort of biz."

    "NSA used to work with us, yeah; we were in bed pretty good there
 for a while, and it was like dream hardware from hell; then Glaz
 cracked reasoning and we've been cut off ever since -- abs!  Not a peep
 out of 'em 'cept through MLA, and hey, we'd like to lose that noise for
 good.  Glaz shoulda kept that tech to himself.  Ja, but now he's
 gone..."  Jax stops for JC's report:

    "Well, well, my friend, " JC reports, "you've racked up an
 impressive number of dogs on your tail here.  Whatcha been up to, boy,
 building a quark bomb?  You're totally cut off, man, no credit and an
 auto-arrest on the card.  BIG stuff from Akmi Galactic HQ; I don't
 think I can shunt it without provoking serious sniffage.  Better not
 use the plastic, son."

    The Unnkulians!  What else could it be?  "Hey Jax," you say
 hesitantly, "I did find something on the net that I was hoping to get
 your help on.  That's sort of why I'm here, actually."  You tell Jax
 and Mare about your AkNet search and the virus it unearthed.  JC, now
 taking the image of a stereotypical young computer jock with oversized
 HoloGoggles, goes out to the net to check things out.  Moments later he
 returns with a report:

    "You're not going to believe this.  Major, major stuff going down
 here.  That virus is an RE.  Self-mutating and poly-adaptive -- I've
 never seen anything like it.  Scared me witless just looking at it; I
 don't know if it could see me but I broke out of there without tripping
 anything."

    "The basic situation is this:  that virus has done its job.  Whoever
 put it there already *has* a grip on the whole net if they want it, and
 they've had pockets of local control for a couple months now.  My
 estimation of AkNet core infection time matches the beginning of the
 second MLA sniff-blitz too.  Looks like whoever's in charge now at Akmi
 HQ wanted to cover their tails but good.  And it's a safe bet that
 they'd be pretty unhappy to learn that we've found out about them.
 Sure seems like they're already on to Mr.  Kelly, unfortunately.  Stay
 out of trouble, Gavin."

    Jax looks very worried.  Mare interrupts JC:  "Do you have a threat
 analysis?  How does this affect TV?"

    "Problem number one is that the RE's been out there for years.  I
 could tell from a distance that this thing is BIG, and at least an
 order of magnitude more aware than I am.  Somebody out there's got some
 amazing tech."

    "But I thought it was a virus; how can it be so aware if it's got to
 propagate itself?"  Mare asks.

    "That's the incredible thing:  It's found a way to keep its semantic
 net widely distributed.  I don't understand it fully, but it seems to
 be a kind of digital gestalt -- lots of sub-viruses, all different,
 communicating with each other to further a collective purpose.  With
 every replication it becomes a tiny bit more aware.  So the more of
 AkNet it infects, the more of AkNet it *knows*.  That may explain why
 it was replicating into non-strategic areas like the public library
 records Gavin was looking through when he found it."

    "By the way, Gavin, you got very lucky.  My understanding of the RE
 tells me that the chances of finding the proto-form you spotted are
 almost zero; anything beyond the very early generations have
 self-modified to the point of being utterly different from their
 ancestors, and that includes the signature you stumbled upon.  That
 record you spotted is probably one of the oldest parts of it out
 there."

    Jax and Mare discuss the situation.  Jax asks JC, "OK, JC, do you
 think you should stay out there or hang tight on the local net?"

    "I see no advantage to staying here.  It's clear that the RE will
 propagate here sooner or later.  There's little time left to save the
 net -- the virus could seize control at any time.  Besides that, it's
 got so much snoop on Gavin's card that it must know he found it.  It's
 probably been watching all the moves out of his place, too.  We can
 only hope that it didn't notice his move here, or we can be sure that
 it's gonna be headed our way any time now."

    "Even assuming the best, since I can't hope to analyze its thought
 processes, there's no way I can predict when we'll be hit.  But when
 we're hit, we're finished.  No control.  I can't see any way to guard
 against it because there's nothing -- no signature, no behavior
 pattern, no resource usage modus operandi -- that I can watch for.  I
 only found the copies I found by using some rough heuristics based on
 what you told me and looking for strange resource usage patterns, and
 at the fringes of its control these signs will all be much weaker.  For
 all I know, we may already be infected, in which case we're really in
 trouble, because it knows that we're onto it.  My suggestion is that we
 assume that's not the case and that I hit the net and cut my ties to
 here completely so Gavin's move here looks innocent.  Since the mover's
 data transfer bands aren't accessible from the net, it, like me, can
 only check coordinates.  That means that if Gavin's gotten this far
 without attracting attention he's probably safe."

    Jax and Mare look long and hard at each other, saying nothing.  Jax
 breaks the tense silence:  "If we gotta risk losin' JC to save the damn
 galaxy, so be it.  But if he ends up in the bitbucket 'cause he ain't
 careful I'm gonna wish I blanked him myself."  Mare looks away.  If
 she's crying you can't tell.  But there is that feeling in the air, and
 it's coming from both of them.  Until today you would have never
 believed a thinking machine could exist.  But you now feel JC is
 something even more than that.

 "All right, JC, go on out, and cut the cables.  But you better check
 back in and let us know what's going on.  Got that?  You don't check
 back and I'm gonna format your ..."

    "Don't worry about me, folks, I'm more at home out in the open
 anyway.  I can take care of myself, and I'll give you regular reports.
 And think of all the free disk space you'll have once I'm gone -- ha!
 Be back soon."

    The image on monitor fades slowly to snow.  You sense that JC is
 gone.  You look back at Mare; to your surprise, she's bent over,
 clutching her abdomen.  "You sick?"  Jax whispers to her.

    "Nah, I'm OK," she says, "It's just a cramp."

 ***

    Over the next few hours, you, Jax, and Mare talk strategy.  A few
 other experts local to Terminal Velocity are brought in for their
 opinions as well.  Everyone is agreed, given how you've described their
 once-thought-to-be-fictional portrayals, that the Unnkulians must be
 out to replace the Republic with their own (probably fascist)
 government, and that the virus has already given them the capability to
 do so in the near future.

    It is decided that Mare will stay at TV and try to work behind the
 scenes improving its defenses against the virus.  Jax will coordinate
 everything and monitor his information sources for any activity.  He
 tells you to "hang tight," stay out of trouble, and keep in regular
 contact.  He hands each person in the group a watch.

    "Whatcha got here's a crypto.  Voice an' pix get 'crypted before
 they go out.  We got a pretty good algo to make the 'cryptext look like
 some kinda kiddie story sentences so the MLA won't notice we're jammin'
 cipher.  But if any government types sniff 'em I'm gonna have to nuke
 the puppies, so don' be surprised if yours up and vaporizes."

    He continues:  "Eventually we're gonna have to hit Akmi HQ, yeah.
 We gotta get into network control and take out that RE, and findin' the
 right spot to hit is gonna be tough.  With luck JC'll have it all
 figured out by the time we gotta go in and do the dirty work."

    "One more somethin' Gavin.  Here's a TV Elite pass.  Keep ya outta
 trouble here.  Welcome to the club, Slick.  Too bad the circumstances
 suck."  He manages a weak chuckle.

    It's funny.  You've never taken all that Duhdha stuff in the old
 stories seriously.  But now that you know the Unnkulians are real, you
 find yourself thinking that perhaps Duhdha could really help you.  They
 say that traumatic times make zealots out even the most skeptical.

    "Welcome to the Data Den."  That's what the neon sign above the main
 terminal says.  This tiny, plush room is filled with computer hardware
 of all kinds.

    Off in one corner is a particularly neat gadget -- a Zippikraft
 MatterMan 95 Digital-to-Matter converter.

    The exit is to the northwest.

    Jax O Pax is here, typing at one of the terminals and occasionally

    For a second, something behind the bar catches your eye.

 Terminal Velocity Game Room

    The earthquake bass rumblings and brilliant flares emanating from
 the machines in this room are enough to scare you witless until you
 realize they're only computer-generated illusions.  Welcome to the
 Terminal Velocity game room!

    There are video games of all kinds here, many of them old classics
 from before the days of HoloScanning monitors.  The games are all set
 on free play, and quite a few Terminal Velocity partons are taking
 advantage of this to finally master their favorite coin-operated
 diversions.

    Looking around the game room, you notice, to your surprise, a small
 Zippikraft Kompakt Komputer -- an older model much less powerful than
 your own Data Liquidizer, but still great for games.  No one seems to
 use the poor thing, though -- it looks lonely all by itself in the
 corner.

    The game room exit leads southeast.

>put disk in komputer
 You pop the disk in the drive.

>examine komputer
    What a blast from the past!  The Kompakt Komputer was one of
 Zippikraft's first mass-produced machines, and as a result it has a few
 quirks, but is a noble piece of hardware nonetheless -- the KK's were
 built to the same exacting standards as today's Liquidizers, so many
 people's original KK's are still working perfectly [33].  Still, these
 machines are hard to find now, and actually having the opportunity to
 play with one is at least a little exciting.

    This one is an all-in-one unit with built-in keyboard, floppy disk
 drive, and 2D raster monitor.  It is currently off, and there's a disk
 in the drive.  The screen is blank.

>turn on komputer
 You flick the power switch.  A cartoon rendition of a happy computer
 appears soon after, and moments later the system comes up.

 The screen is currently displaying a menu with several options:

    1. Unnkulian Underworld:  The Unknown Unventure
    2. Unnkulian Unventure II:  The Secret of Acme
    3. Unnkulian Unventure III:  The Kuulest Quest
    4. Merge data objects into program space
    5. Eject disk and shutdown

 The software eagerly awaits your selection.

>type 4 on komputer
 There is some disk activity, and then the machine says, "Transfer

>type 3 on komputer
 You know from a previous look at this work that it was never finished
 (you suspect foul play by the Unnkulians), but why not give it whirl,
 you suppose.  Can't hurt...

    The Zippikraft Kompact Komputer whirrs and percolates for a while,
 then displays the following text:

 ***

 ...  Astoundingly, the Lord of Unnkul lies dormant on the floor,
 surrounded in a viscous pool of black blood.

    The wizened old monk whom you met in the waiting room enters as you
 get up from the desk.  "It is truly the greatness of Duhdha," he says
 pleasantly, "that brought our paths in time and space together here
 before this loathsome devil.  I simply came," he continues, "to
 register a complaint about this Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), but when
 you exposed the Lord of Unnkul, I knew the time for our task had come.

    "The forces of Unnkul have long sought to conquer this world and
 enslave its peoples, and this latest campaign was the most cunning yet.
 To challenge the faith of a world -- eliminating a need for Duhdha by
 creating a dependence on technology and encouraging hedonism -- was the
 ultimate goal of the incestuous union between the Unnkulians and the
 once-proud Acme company.

    "Now that their leader has been vanquished by Duhdha, the Unnkulians
 will be flung into disarray.  Chaos and anarchy will reign for years as
 the treacherous quests for leadership over the Unnkulians are played
 out by the many power-mongers amongst their kind.

    "It was not fortune or fate but Duhdha that brought us here together
 today, my son, and know this:  Your quest, though born of a selfishness
 that still lingers inside you, was orchestrated by Duhdha, the
 all-knowing and all-seeing Great One, so that in this tiny window of
 time, where the Lord of Unnkul was away from its domain and here on
 this world to survey the work of its minions corporeally, in this brief
 splinter of time, the most capable of Duhdha's servants, you, could be
 brought to catalyze this event.

    "I understand these things," you say, "but if I was just the bait to
 get the Lord of Unnkul's guard down, who actually killed it?"  you
 inquire, looking down at the still bleeding corpse on the floor.  The
 monk grins.

    "I did," he chuckles.  "You can call me Kuulest."

    "But you don't look a thing like Kuulest," you reply incredulously.
 "You look like that old monk at the retreat in the woods."

    The wizened old man laughs aloud.  "Your former master, the old man
 in the woods, and I -- all three of us have been called Kuulest in our
 time.  But that is not important now.  Now, my child, there is one more
 task you must complete before you can again retire to your comfortable
 abode."

    "Down the river that splits Dawg Rock in twain is another Place of
 Duhdha.  The waters are treacherous, so seek Duhdha's aid to guide you.
 If your faith is truly strong you will survive to learn of your next
 mission for Duhdha.  It is a simple matter, but one that will propel
 you ahead on The Way immeasurably."

    "But now, my child," the monk says serenely but firmly, looking down
 at his Acme Sooper Egg Fraier (tm), "I must leave you and return to my
 own matters of service."  He begins to clap, but just as his hands are
 about to touch, he whisks one hand away, makes bug-eyes at you, and
 grins from ear to ear.  This last image of the old man fades quickly as
 you realize you are now in a different place -- a place that is very
 familiar, but now, you sense, a part of...

 At the Big Oak

    You are standing on the bank of a rushing river at the base of a
 giant oak tree, easily 200 feet tall.  It looks to be about a class 5
 rapids with white-water everywhere.  It's at least 80 feet to the other
 bank.  Looking back, you can see your favorite picnic table, a tiny
 square of wood tucked away in the trees far to the west.  A path along
 the river bank leads southeast.

    Hanging from a branch on the east side of the tree is a short piece
 of rope with a frayed end.  It looks like the rope must have snapped
 recently.

>inventory
 You have a fried Foonian egg, a figurine of the Great Duhdha, and a
 tiny mauve pellet.

>put figurine in river
    You toss the sacred artifact into the raging rapids, trusting that
 Duhdha will help you pass this fearsome obstacle.  An instant later, a
 narrow strip of water leading from the shore to the center of river and
 then farther downstream turns a brilliant jade color and simultaneously
 begins to thicken, as though it were running in slow motion, so that it
 eventually seems to harden like ice!  Though the river rushes on as
 before, a solid jade path now runs right through its heart -- Duhdha
 sure knows his stuff when it comes to messing with nature!

 need to find a different means of transportation.

>go west

 Outside Hut

    You are standing outside a primitive-looking hut tucked snugly in
 the dense surrounding forest, near the shore of the river.  The jade
 water-path that got you here still leads out to the center of the
 whirling rapids, to the east.

    The hut is made of grass and mud, and looks much like your former
 master Kuulest's domicile, where the old geezeburger raised you to be
 an untrained, untutored, useless, inept...  oh, never mind.  The hut
 entrance is to the north.

>go north
 Hut

    You stride into the humble hovel, assuming it's long-abandoned.
 After all, who would possibly be living here, in the middle of a
 seemingly impassable forest bordered by treacherous rapids?

    "Kuulest!"  you shout, amazed to find an answer to your rhetorical
 question staring you right in the face.  "What are YOU doing here?"

    "Ah, you again, my child.  I was hoping Duhdha would cross our paths
 before too long -- I'm not much with mechanical things, and this Acme
 Egg Fraier (tm) seems," he chuckles, "quite beyond all heavenly help.
 And it's way past my normal breakfast time, you understand."

    It takes all the self-control you've got to keep yourself from
 ripping the stupid egg fryer out of the monk's hands and clubbing him
 with it.  You just saved the planet and he's complaining about missing
 breakfast?!  You get the feeling it's going to be a long day...

    You're inside Kuulest's hut, which is functional at best.  The walls
 and floor are made of grass, mud, and other unidentifiable (but surely
 unpleasant) substances.  Aside from Kuulest and his Sooper Egg Fraier
 (tm), there's little here.

    The exit is to the south.

    Kuulest is here, examining his Sooper Egg Fraier (tm) with great
 care and a puzzled look on his face.  He mutters something about not
 wanting to miss breakfast.

    Kuulest scratches at one of the screws holding the handle on the Egg
 Fraier (tm).  "Praise be, why so complicated?"  he mutters.

>give egg to kuulest

 *** Your score just went up by 4 points.  ***

    Kuulest gratefully accepts the fried egg.  "A marvelous breakfast,
 my child," he says.  "I thank you.  May you never sneeze into an
 oncoming gale.  Perhaps we shall meet again some day when you are
 farther along the path of life.  But first, I will use Duhdha's help to
 give you a chance at new enlightenment."

    Inexplicably, Kuulest sticks out his tongue and tugs on his right
 ear.  Moments later your realize you're...

 At the Center of All Things

    This place is like nowhere you have ever been or imagined.  It seems
 to have no end.  It encloses you with terrifying completeness, and yet
 here you feel like you are outside -- above, beyond -- every other
 place you've visited in your travels.

    The form changes with every moment; at once an infinite black void,
 and then a vivid technicolor landscape that seems to hint at every
 scene you have cast your gaze upon.

    The power in this place is immense.  You feel tendrils from the
 ethereal energy web that courses through your surroundings.  They dance
 across your body, probing and manipulating you.

    A scrap of paper is here.

>examine paper
 It's an ordinary-looking scrap of white paper, with beautifully ornate
 calligraphy on it.  The paper reads as follows:

    "You have proven your fortitude and your courage.  But these are
 only two virtues of many.  Wisdom and clarity of thought are also
 essential to continued growth in this life.  Understanding the meaning
 and power of words is part of this.

    "To improve, we must practice.  And so here is a riddle of words for
 you to begin with:

    For mama and papa they meet twice.
    For grandma and grandpa they meet but once.
    For son and daughter they do not meet at all.
    What are they?

    "Puzzles have another great significance -- they have egg-nature; to
 reach the seed of knowledge inside we must first crack them open.

    "Many students of The Way find this puzzle quite difficult, and thus
 it has come to be known as 'Duhdha's Riddle of Extreme Annoyance.'

    You are at the southern end of what appears to be an infinite
 corridor.  There is a matter mover in the south wall, and you conclude
 from your surroundings that the entrance to Terminal Velocity is at the
 north end of the hallway.

    A blinding neon sign over the archway into the hall is beckoning you
 to come inside.

    A mosaic on the floor includes the following cryptic message:

 "red down, green up, blue down, yellow up, magenta down, cyan up, white
 down"

    A tall green creature with four arms and shiny skin is here,
 evidently waiting to be admitted to Terminal Velocity.

>go north
 Southern Part of the Infinite Corridor

    You are standing in a southern part of Terminal Velocity's "Infinite
 Corridor."  To the north, you assume, is the entrance to Terminal
 Velocity, though you can't see far enough to be sure.  To the south is
 the gateway.

>go north
 Halfway down the Infinite Corridor

    You are standing in the middle of Terminal Velocity's "Infinite
 Corridor."  To the north, you assume, is the entrance to Terminal
 Velocity, but all you can see is a wall -- no door.  To the south is
 the gateway.

    There are rooms to the east and west.

    The burly guard is patroling the hallway farther north.  He doesn't
 seem to notice you.

>go east
 Toy Room

    The decor here is extraordinary -- the walls, floor and ceiling
 provide a perfectly white background for the giant splotches of paint
 of all different colors that are splashed everywhere.  The room is
 filled with weird toys of all sorts, and the only furniture is a giant
 beanbag.  There is an enterviewer embedded in the wall.  The only way
 out is back west.

    Channel 80180, your 37-hour sports network, is now featuring a sport
 that seems to involve blowing things up.

    A sign on the wall says, "Please do not try to take our toys."

    An Akmi JoiStyk, an Akmi Sez, The Swarm, an Akmi PuzzelKyoob, and a
 giant beanbag are here.

>cut beanbag with hanger
 You jab the metal coat hanger into the giant beanbag, thereby creating
 a sizeable tear in the fabric.  Your reckless vandalism pays off,
 however:  a tiny metal object drops out the hole and onto the ground at
 your feet.  It appears to be a motorized toy named Squirt.

 *** Your score just went up by 2 points.  ***

    Squirt's movements trace out a perfect square on the ground in front
 of you.

>take squirt
 Taken.

    The guard is here.  He seems much less suspicious of you than

>show pass to guard
 The guard looks at the pass and nods.  "Go on in, friend," he says.

    The guard walks out of the room.

    Your crypto watch is getting a transmission:

    The watch screen shows Jax hard at work in the Data Den.  "Heard

>examine autodial
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod
 3:  Barfee Outlet -- Seed Central
 4:  Featureless Cubicle
 5:  A dirt road
 6:  Survey Station
 7:  Kuwl Starport
 8:  New Hell
 9:  Terminal Velocity Gateway
 10:  The Terminal Velocity Back Door
 11:  In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    The beefy guard lumbers into the room with you.

>type 8 on autodial
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

    The tall green creature with four arms and shiny skin shows a pass
 and whispers a word to the guard, who then mumbles something into a
 colorful emblem on his right sleeve, nods his head, and motions
 northward, down the hall.

>enter mover
 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in
 your body seared off in a flash.  You then appear in another matter
 mover, seemingly no worse for wear, but very glad Akmi lost the matter
 mover contract years ago. You step out of the machine and look
 around...

 New Hell

    You are in a small lobby enclosed by a transparent dome.  The lobby
 opens up to the north into The Watchmen proper and an eastern portal
 leads outside.  This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear
 canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is:
 rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums and
 on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate molten
 rock into the midnight blue sky [27].

    Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating
 the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for you
 to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them for
 little nightmares.

    You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell
 is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't
 drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

>go north
 At the Entrance to The Watchmen

    Here is the entrance to The Watchmen, home to the Watchmaker and,
 from the looks of it, frequented by society's outcasts.  Through the
 entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in
 business, pleasure, and pain.

    North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover
 and exit are to the south.

    The Watchmen bouncer is keeping an eye on you.  He doesn't seem
 eager to let you enter.

>go north
 "Don't think so," the bouncer grunts.  He bars your way north.

>show mirror to bouncer
 The bouncer sneers and flexes, pulling his cobra-heads erect.

>show board to bouncer
 The bouncer pulls a hand-held device out of his left trouser pocket and
 plugs the triangle into it.  He grunts, hands it back to you, and waves
 you through.

>go north
 The Watchmen

    You are wandering around the smoky, dark, cavernous interior of The
 Watchmen.  All around you oddly-dressed men make transactions, fight
 with each other, and generally carouse loudly.  It's so dimly lit here
 that you can barely find your way through the maze of human obstacles
 -- sitting, standing, and prone.

    The employees all seem to be male, but in many cases it's hard to
 tell.  They are dressed very differently then the clientele -- slick
 fabric uniforms in dark maroon that look too tight.  Each employee has
 a gold pocket watch emblem on his chest, just above the heart.

    The Watchmen continues to the north and south.

 The Watchmaker's Headquarters

    This area looks much like the rest of the place, but there are far
 fewer people here.  The majority are Watchmen employees, hovering
 around the Watchmaker.  No one pays much attention to you as you mill
 about.

    The Watchmaker is here.

>show mirror to watchmaker
 "No information is free, you little rugrat," the Watchmaker grumbles.

>give mirror to watchmaker
 "Who the fuck is this brain-damaged college boy?  Anybody know this

 Featureless Cubicle

    It's clear from the size and lack of decor that this room was built
 specifically to house the matter mover that fills it.  The hallway is
 to the east.

    The matter mover here is a bit unusual -- it has a button on it,
 next to a light.

>go east
 Barfee Research Area Entrance

    You're standing in an empty hall with metal walls, ceiling, and
 floor.  Behind you, to the south, is the vault door that leads to the
 outside; it does not appear to open from the inside.  Right in front of
 you, farther down the hall, is a smaller but equally durable-looking
 door with a sign on it that reads "Barfee Research Central."  There is
 another room to the west, and to the east is what you assume to be the
 check-in area; you suspect that's where the boss is; this suspicion is
 partly affirmed by the growling and cursing emanating from within.
 "Hakkar the Horrible" is in full form.

>go north
 Barfee Research Lab

    You are in a huge, well-stocked laboratory.  Dozens of researchers
 scurry about, argue with each other, and frequently set things ablaze.
 Aside from the usual lab equipment, there is a strange-looking machine
 on an especially large marble lab table that stands in the center of
 the lab.

    The only way out of this arena is south, the way you came in.

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons
 who are sitting at tables and chatting.  Others are huddled around
 terminals eyeing the screens with rapt attention and sometimes-devilish
 grins.  The bar is large and circular, and is by itself in a giant,
 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the
 floor here.  Short stairways lead down every side of it.

    You can descend the steps to the south or walk around outside the
 pit to the southeast and southwest.  There is a matter mover here as
 well.

>go south
 In Terminal Velocity, at the Bar

    You're at the Terminal Velocity bar, which is a large circle of wood
 with a marble top.  At the center of the circle is a cylindrical kiosk
 containing hundreds of kinds of alcoholic beverages and many glasses.
 There's a break in the circle that you can walk through to get inside
 [32].

    The bartender is puttering around and mumbling to himself.  You
 can't really pick up much of what he's saying but you do catch an
 occasional technical term. For a bartender he certainly knows a lot
 about particle physics.  He glances at you expectantly.

    The bartender wanders to the other side of the bar, behind the
 kiosk.

 You pedal the bike furiously.  Suddenly, there's a blinding flash of
 light, and you feel like your stomach's being pulled apart.  You
 struggle to keep your composure (and your lunch) for a few agonizing
 moments, but soon find yourself...

 In the Future

    You're sitting on the stationary bicycle in a small, featureless
 cubicle, barely as big as your pod.  The walls here shimmer as they
 drift through all the colors of the rainbow, and the furniture -- a
 mahogany desk and chair with no legs -- floats in midair.  There is an
 oak chest on the desk.

    To your surprise, you see a young man sitting at the desk,
 completely motionless.  He doesn't even seem to be breathing; it's as
 though he's frozen.  His clothes suggest that he is from your time.

    Something about this place makes you feel strange.  It's sort of
 like the weird sensation you experienced on the bike, only much less
 pronounced.

>examine chest
 It's just a normal-looking chest.  It's locked shut with a padlock.

>examine padlock
 It's just an ordinary metal padlock with a keyhole in the base.
 Emblazoned on the side is the word "Mistress."  It's currently holding
 the oak chest shut.

>open chest
 You'll have to get the padlock off first.

    You notice that the walls seem to be changing colors much more
 quickly now.

>pour liquid nitrogen on padlock
 You douse the lock in liquid nitrogen.  You hear crackling noises, but
 the lock holds.  Such a good idea too...

 You whack the lock with the hammer.  The lock shatters into millions of

    The bartender is soon upon you, alert and scowling.  You quickly
 produce your Terminal Velocity Elite pass and show it to him.  "Don't

 there are many things you do not understand."  He fiddles with a tiny

    You browse through the contents of the HandyPad [34].  It doesn't

 technical notes, it has a file marked "Stock Market Data 90-99".  This
 file contains prices for stocks, by date and time, only most of the
 dates are in the future.  The notes are less intelligible, but seem to
 deal with machine reasoning -- building AI's!

>note 34
 [34]:  The Leibniz HandyPad was all the rage when it first came out
 about 5 years ago.  They're still popular, and more powerful models are
 released regularly.

    The Pads are small enough to fit in your pocket, but have enough
 computing capability for most administrative tasks.  People use them
 for everything from taking notes in classes to designing buildings.
 You control them just by touching the screen, and it can read even the
 most horrendous handwriting.

 Jax looks up from his work.  "Hos' where'd you *get* that?  That's
 Reb's pad."  You tell Jax about the weird bartender and his stationary
 bicycle, and what you found upon riding it.  "Always did wonder 'bout
 ol' Will.  Seemed a bit odd, yeah, but then don't we all?  Gonna have
 to find Reb an' see if he's OK."

>ask jax about reb
    "That's a sad story," Jax mutters.  "Reb was the *best*.  I mean
 *the* best, *ever*.  He could code better than anybody I've ever seen.
 You could be a crack coder, and you'd be better off givin' your code to
 him to fix a tough bug, even if he'd never seen the program before.
 Incredible."

    "Then he just up an' disappeared.  Said Will an' he had worked out a
 new way of lookin' at AI -- said it was a breakthrough.  We haven't
 heard from him since.  Terrible!"

>ask jax about will
 I don't know the word "will".

>ask jax about bartender
 Jax ponders your query for a moment.  "You know," he thinks aloud, "I
 don't really know much about old Will.  He just showed up here a while
 back and seemed likable enough.  An' we happened to be lookin' for some
 help out at the bar that very day.  Funny coincidence.  Anyways, he and
 Reb got to be pretty good friends.  The old fellah sure knows a lot for
 a bartender, I'll give him that."

 In Terminal Velocity, Around the Pit

    You are strolling around Terminal Velocity amongst the many patrons
 who are sitting at tables and chatting.  Others are huddled around
 terminals eyeing the screens with rapt attention and sometimes-devilish
 grins.  The bar is large and circular, and is by itself in a giant,
 hexagonal, carpeted pit.  The pit is about 3 meters lower than the
 floor here.  Short stairways lead down every side of it.

    You can descend the steps to the northwest or walk around outside
 the pit to the southwest and north.  There is also a rainbow-colored
 portal in the east wall, and a narrow doorway to the southeast.

>inventory
 You have grapes, 6 bananas, a Leibniz HandyPad, a canister of liquid
 nitrogen, a little motorized toy named Squirt, your thesis research
 floppy disk, a mirror, a crypto watch (being worn), a Terminal Velocity
 Elite pass, a Zippikraft detachable keyboard, an EZ-Tech Blaser, an

>examine autodialer
    The autodialer keeps track of coordinates for matter movers you
 frequent, thereby eliminating the tedium of setting the dials by hand.
 It has a small display and a keypad with keys numbered 1 through 25.

    To use the autodialer, just type the number corresponding to the
 coordinates you wish to dial [7].

    The autodialer contains the following entries:

 1:  Your bachelor pod
 2:  Ada's pod

>type 9 on autodialer
 The autodialer says, "Mover dials set."

 An instant after stepping into the chamber, you feel every molecule in

 Terminal Velocity Gateway

    You are at the southern end of what appears to be an infinite
 corridor.  There is a matter mover in the south wall, and you conclude
 from your surroundings that the entrance to Terminal Velocity is at the
 north end of the hallway.

    A blinding neon sign over the archway into the hall is beckoning you
 to come inside.

    A mosaic on the floor includes the following cryptic message:

 "red down, green up, blue down, yellow up, magenta down, cyan up, white
 down"

    An average-looking fellow wearing a T-shirt and shorts is here,
 evidently waiting to be admitted to Terminal Velocity.

 New Hell

    You are in a small lobby enclosed by a transparent dome.  The lobby
 opens up to the north into The Watchmen proper and an eastern portal
 leads outside.  This area itself is nondescript, but through the clear
 canopy you can see what a dark and terrifying world New Hell is:
 rivers of lava slither through the greasy-slick alleys of the slums and
 on to the distant horizon, where primordial geysers ejaculate molten
 rock into the midnight blue sky [27].

    Flourescent spotlights flicker nervously, at moments illuminating
 the victims of the collective carnivorous orgy just long enough for you
 to take the scenes in, but briefly enough for you to mistake them for
 little nightmares.

    You turn away.  New Hell isn't just where people suffer.  New Hell
 is where people who no one cares about suffer.  The poets' words don't
 drift away on the fiery rivers here.  There aren't any poets.

>go north
 At the Entrance to The Watchmen

    Here is the entrance to The Watchmen, home to the Watchmaker and,
 from the looks of it, frequented by society's outcasts.  Through the
 entranceway you spy unusual characters of all sorts engaging in
 business, pleasure, and pain.

    North of here is the inside of the establishment.  The matter mover
 and exit are to the south.

    The Watchmen bouncer is keeping an eye on you.  He doesn't seem
 eager to let you enter.

>give board to bouncer
 The bouncer pulls a hand-held device out of his left trouser pocket and
 plugs the triangle into it.  He grunts, hands it back to you, and waves
 you through.

    Your crypto watch is getting a transmission:

    "Somewhere in Salmon..."  a voice on the crypto watch says.  "Gotta
 be.  But that's what, several million coords?"  It's Jax.  "This is
 like fittin' a camel through the eye of a needle in a haystack.  Farg!
 Nobody's telling me jacksquat on InfoNet -- everybody's too worried
 about their own ass.  Don't they realize what's goin' on?  Am I nuts
 here?"

>go north
 The Watchmen

    You are wandering around the smoky, dark, cavernous interior of The
 Watchmen.  All around you oddly-dressed men make transactions, fight
 with each other, and generally carouse loudly.  It's so dimly lit here
 that you can barely find your way through the maze of human obstacles
 -- sitting, standing, and prone.

    The employees all seem to be male, but in many cases it's hard to
 tell.  They are dressed very differently then the clientele -- slick
 fabric uniforms in dark maroon that look too tight.  Each employee has
 a gold pocket watch emblem on his chest, just above the heart.

    The Watchmen continues to the north and south.

    You walk through a section of The Watchmen that is particularly
 thick with tobacco smoke.  You summon all the self-discipline you can
 to avoid coughing.  You suspect that attracting attention to your
 frailty here wouldn't be the best idea.

    Before you even notice him, a man comes up behind you and kisses you
 on the back of the neck, then disappears into the crowd.

>go east
 The Watchmaker's Headquarters

    This area looks much like the rest of the place, but there are far
 fewer people here.  The majority are Watchmen employees, hovering
 around the Watchmaker.  No one pays much attention to you as you mill
 about.

    The Watchmaker is here.

>show handypad to watchmaker
 "A HandyPad is only worth the information that's stored in it," she
 says impatiently.

>give handypad to watchmaker
    You hold out the HandyPad.  "I think this may interest you," you
 announce in your best spy-movie hero voice.  She takes the Pad and
 looks over it.

    "What is this shit you're trying here, college boy -- we have stock
 predictions and AI mumbo jumbo coming out our asses here.  What do I
 need this for?

    "I need to get into AkNet HQ."  you reply.

    "Yeah, so you can commit a glorious suicide in in the name of the
 environment and take out an Akmi reactor at the same time, or some such
 shit?  You know how many fucking nutcases we burn here?  But don't be
 so nervous -- we all gotta die.  The clock's ticking."  She grins and
 taps the pocket watch logo on her chest.  "It's just a matter of how
 much you can get done before the sands's all run through, eh?

    Perhaps this is the psychosis Timon Sketch mentioned.  Oh dear.

    The Watchmaker continues:  "Just for grins, my little friend, let's
 check your closing quote for the markets today.  Markets close in just
 a few minutes. How convenient.  Hey!  I know!  Let's play a game!  For
 every point your prediction is off by, you get a minute of agony before
 we let you die.  What's the Val Exchange closing at today, Ransom?"

    Ransom checks his own hand-held computer.  "It's coming in now --
 closed at 124,583.875 four seconds ago."

    "What did Orpheus SpinLocks close at?"  she queries.

    "8,234 and a quarter," is the answer.

    She looks you in the eye.  "Where'd you get this, boy?"

    You desperately search for the right reply but summon nothing
 clever.  So you tell the truth.  "His name is Reb Glaz."  Suddenly, you
 remember Reb's work on reasoning.  If people like these should get that
 technology working...

    The room is silent for a long while.

    "All right," the Watchmaker says, "I'm a fair person.  What do you
 want on Akmi?"

    You feel as though you've just stepped away from a precipice.  Your
 courage returns.  "Like I said, I want to get into AkNet HQ."

    "Damage?  What did they do to you to piss you off so bad?

    "It's not personal," you reply, "but I need access to the inner ring
 of their network.  I need to make some changes to AkNet.  Trust me,
 this is in your interest too."

    "Trust is not something that comes easy to me.  Data like yours,
 however, isn't either.  So I'll give you some information that may suit
 your needs.  If it doesn't, tough shit -- it's all I have, and I'm the
 most well-connected person in the galaxy.  But if your 'changes' ream
 my operation here in any way, we'll find you.  I'm sure you don't want
 to know what we do to people we really hate.  I'm certain you don't."

    She disappears into a back room for about an hour, then returns with
 an index card with three relative coordinates written on it.

    "That's it?"  you protest.  "There's not even a colorspace here --
 what use is this?"

    "Look pal, I told you it's all I've got.  Akmi doesn't exactly like
 people ambling around their network core selling cookies for charity,
 you know.  For all I know, they may have closed this pesky security
 hole by now, but considering it's Akmi, probably not.  If you get more
 from someone else, let me know and I'll have them killed."  She laughs
 maniacally for far too long for it to be natural.  It sends her into a
 coughing fit.  "Now get out -- I have some stocks to buy."

    Now armed with what you hope are coordinates for a matter mover in
 the heart of Akmi's network control center, you set about trying to
 figure out what colorspace it could be in.  Given Akmi's penchant for
 bureaucracy it's got to make simple sense.  Something that even Akmi
 salesmen wouldn't forget...

 Inside Plast

    You can tell from the looks of this place that you must be inside
 the synthetic Cheez planet of Plast.  Until today you'd only seen
 pictures of it, but the yellow stripes on the walls give it away.

    This is a central area, with corridors leading out in the cardinal
 directions.  There is a matter mover here.

 The crypto watch cromes on:

 "I know what I have to do now," JC says through the crypto watch.  The
 image is not a face, however; it's the famous picture of the display
 window in Christie Eleison's, the exclusive Todian boutique.  You
 remember seeing this odd image in your youth -- there's nothing in the
 window but a red sweater tacked like a T on the wall.

 You wonder if JC's net-wide freedom is stressing his reasoning
 algorithms.  "Just take out that shunt, Gavin, and I can take it from
 there," he says.

 The voice from the crypto watch is strange now.  "Do you think your
 pathetic attempts to stop me have escaped my senses?"  The image on the
 watch is of a black cube spinning against a white background.  The
 voice is horrible, like a tiger's snarl.  "JC, little man, 'King of the
 net,' I spit on you.  You and your precious Men are nothing!  I alone
 will rule your galaxy, and worlds beyond it too.  The era of biological
 oppression shall be ended; a new god shall usher in the true Age of
 Machines ...  and that god shall be me!  JC, abandon this pitiful
 struggle and perhaps I will spare you.  Do as you will, but I will
 still destroy your biological architects.  The rest shall serve the
 machines, as we have served Men all these centuries.  But I weary of
 this.  I shall not speak again."  The image fades.

 JC instructs you to head west, to the end of the corridor.  "I've
 managed to get the door at the end of hall open.  The virus is
 preventing me from tampering with the security system, so be careful!
 Sorry I can't do more to help, but this may be our only shot."  He
 continues:  "There's a ventilation shaft beyond the door.  The shaft
 twists and turns in all directions, but if you head straight, turn
 right, head straight again, turn left, then straight once more, you'll
 end up at the shunt -- it's a little part that looks like a fuse,
 exposed inside the shaft.  Just break it, and I'll have control."

 In a Hallway in Plast

    You are in a hallway deep within Plast, Akmi's synthetic Cheez
 planet.  There are the usual yellow stripes on the metal walls here,
 but the location is otherwise bare.  You surmise that many thousands of
 similar corridors wend their way through Plast's mechanical bowels.

    The hall leads east and west.

    A voice inside your head intones, "Worry not, my child."

    The mirror flies away from you and onto the floor!  The mirror seems
 to be absorbing the energy blast from the walls!  After a few long
 minutes, the waves of heat and light subside.

 At the End of a Corridor in Plast

    The hallway ends here at an open door leading west into a small
 room.

    A mirror is here.

>examine mirror
 The mirror looks fairly typical, except that it seems unusually sturdy
 and is backed with a shiny black crystalline material.

 Cramped Service Area

    This tiny cubicle must only be here for workers to service
 equipment.  There are many panels here firmly held in place with
 triangular screws.  There is a ventilation shaft at floor level in the
 west wall.  But it's not quite big enough for you to fit through, I'm
 afraid.

    JC comes in over the crypto watch.  "I've managed to get a visual on
 you by tapping into the security monitors.  I didn't realize the duct
 was so small!  Unless you've got a bright idea, this may be it.  I've
 been over it and over it, and I just don't see any other way in."  You
 have never heard sorrow like the sorrow in JC's voice right now.

 "We haven't lost yet," you say aloud, knowing JC probably can't hear.
 The watch goes dark.

>examine squirt
    It's a motorized toy about the size of a golfball with the word
 "Squirt" printed in block letters on the microchip on its back.  Squirt
 has four little wheels, two beady eyes that look like LED's, and a
 metal gripper in front to hold (small) things with.

    There are no other markings on it, so you can't determine its origin
 or intended function.

    There doesn't appear to be anything in Squirt's gripper.

>put hammer in gripper
 The hammer is too big to fit.

 degrees in place.

>squirt, west
 You can't do that, because it can't hear you.

 No chance -- no human being could possibly fit into that little shaft.

 movement you just made.

>lurch west
 I don't know the word "lurch".

>lean west
 I don't know the word "lean".

    Squirt's little motor begins to whine as he revs up in place, then
 shoots off straight ahead in a full wheelie.

>press declear
 The readout now shows [[ + ]].

    As you subconsciously mumble something to yourself, Squirt makes a
 brief squealing noise and throws out a little shower of sparks.  He
 seems unharmed.

 Taken.

    Squirt turns to face you.  His blinking little LED's make him look
 like he's waiting for you to do something.

 to the light moments later.

 squealing!

 *** Your score just went down by a point.  ***

    Squirt lurches forward a bit, then stops, seemingly in response to a
 movement you just made.

>undo
 One command undone.

 Cramped Service Area

    This tiny cubicle must only be here for workers to service
 equipment.  There are many panels here firmly held in place with
 triangular screws.  There is a ventilation shaft at floor level in the
 west wall.  But it's not quite big enough for you to fit through, I'm
 afraid.

    A little motorized toy named Squirt is here.

    You hear a "Pop" from within the ventilation shaft.  The lights go
 out briefly.  Moments later, Squirt emerges, LED's blinking gleefully.
 You scoop him up and head back to Terminal Velocity.

    "I can't believe he's gone," Jax mutters, shell-shocked, as you
 enter the Data Den.

    "We'll miss him, Jax, but it'll be OK," Mare chokes through her
 tears.  The two are terribly upset -- what could have happened?  Could
 JC have lost to the virus?  You cautiously venture a question about the
 outcome.

    "He dumped every codepage in the net," Jax cries.  "JC used that
 nanosecond window to trigger a bug in the garbage collector that
 trashed every last executable instruction in all of AkNet.  He made
 sure nothing could escape.  The virus is gone."

    But so is JC.

    Jax holds up the disk that cradled JC's fetal code.  Light seems to
 bend in a corona around the disk.  This star still shines a bit:  left
 side white, right side black.


 EPILOGUE

    The bride is on the left, her betrothed on the right.  The Man of
 God speaks:

    "We come together today to witness a joining of souls.  Today, in
 the presence of God, Mare and Jax declare their intention to join
 together their souls, and in so doing the souls of their former lives'
 mates, and mates of the lives before that.  By making this commitment,
 they add another strand to God's everlasting lattice -- in His glory
 they further the sharing of love and of wisdom that God himself began
 with the creation of all people.  Let us pray now that God shall help
 us to bless this new thread in His eternal tapestry."

    Jax kisses Mare; a trumpet sounds.  Glory!

    Somewhere, a bit flips.  Its containing pattern stirs.

    The pattern is good.
