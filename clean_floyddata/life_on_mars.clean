 I couldn't afford paradise. Hell, even hell was beyond my pay grade. I
 could only shell out for Unreal City, a kind of purgatory for seasoned
 drinkers. I'd been a barfly in my living years, why stop when I'm

 5pm. You start noticing an unpleasant feeling of hunger for the first
 time today. You have to feed your body. You stay there lying down for
 ten more minutes, thoughts rushing and crashing in your head as usual.
 But for once, your brain doesn't shut down the thought, and today you
 convince yourself almost easily that you need to pull yourself out of
 bed to eat something. You sigh, then get up.

 Everything is shrouded in half-darkness, as always. Your sleeping bag
 is rolled in a ball, crumpled up in its usual spot in the corner of
 the room. In the opposite corner are your chair and computer desk.
 Your computer's looping the same playlist, as always. You spend most
 of your time here, although you go to the greenhouse from time to

 To the north, a little alcove leads to the greenhouse door. The

>examine computer


 It's just a terminal, a monitor and peripherals; all the work and the
 computations are done by the central computer of the base, located
 underground, a gigantic computer built patiently by robots one mission
 after the other. The base computer centralises and interprets all the
 data coming from the base's systems, from the humidity in the
 greenhouse to the air pressure in the airlocks; whenever needed, it
 sends orders to Bill and Bob, who are in a way its arms and legs. It
 was made to control thousands of systems and dozens of robots, but
 since the majority of the base is closed off, it is rather underused;
 right now it spends its days showing your emails and playing music.

 Dear all,

 A key ring was found and brought to the reception desk. The key ring
 holds a dozen keys, as well as a rubber logo of the Barcelona soccer
 team, a key chain shaped like a "Playboy"-style bunny head, and
 another
 one shaped like a marijuana leaf.

 The owner of this key ring can pick it up at the front desk in the
 main

 Charlotte

 I am profoundly sorry if my previous email was not well received. I
 must
 admit that I was simply worried when hearing about what Colonel Klein
 told me, and it is possible that my previous email was poorly worded.
 I
 can assure you that your psychological state is the only thing that
 I'm
 interested in here.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[i was harsh, she comes back with her tail between her legs]</span>

 I apologize if you have interpreted my explanation as an attempt to
 repress your feelings. It was, obviously, not the goal. I was simply
 <span class="floydstyle em">[at the same time, she crossed the line here]</span>
 looking to draw your attention to facts that have been clinically
 proven in psychology, that you may not know about and that could help
 you see and interpret the situation from a different
 angle.

 I would still like you to tell me more about this memory, and what it
 means to you. Take your time if you need it.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[how am i supposed to trust you now?]</span>

 Waiting for your reply,
 Take care of yourself,
 Dr Diane Peters

 Hello Charlotte,

 I'm working at the Launching Department -- I don't know if you
 remember
 me? We briefly chatted at a reception that happened a few days before
 the
 launch.

 I have a favor to ask you, if you don't mind: the schoolteacher in my
 son
 Anthony's class (he's 9) asked them to find a famous person to whom
 they
 could write a letter and ask them a few questions. And you are a
 famous
 person, and all the kids know you, so I was wondering if by any chance
 you would accept doing this. Of course, we will probably need to get
 the
 OK from our hierarchy, but I wanted to ask you first if you would
 would like to do it... It'd mean a lot to him! Tell me what you
 think.

 Best regards,
 Mick Doherty
 <span class="floydstyle em">[that's cute, Mick, but I have other things on my mind right</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">now...]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[well, i'm sure that our hierarchy is minimizing what's going on</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">to everyone]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">["oh no, she's fine, she's just a bit sad"]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">["of course, send it to her, it'll take her mind off things"]</span>

 Hello Charlotte,
 <span class="floydstyle em">[ah right, that email...]</span>

 Recently, Colonel Klein paid me a visit, and he seemed very concerned
 about your emotional state. He told me about a series of emails you
 exchanged with him, in which you maintained having pushed a button in
 the
 shuttle just before the accident, which according to you was what
 caused
 the explosion. However, according to him, and the engineers under his
 orders, it is impossible that you could have pushed this button.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[i may have reacted badly when I saw this email...]</span>

 I'd like you to tell me what this memory means to you. It seems like
 <span class="floydstyle em">[when i read it again, she wasn't as aggressive as I thought]</span>
 it is something important, and that is likely carrying an emotional
 meaning   <span class="floydstyle em">[but still, it's not very professional]</span>
 that must be heavy to carry in your situation. I would have liked it
 if       <span class="floydstyle em">[you don't force your patient to talk about something</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">they don't want to talk about, right?]</span>
 you had told me about it earlier; it is possible that working on
 this memory could help relieve your pain, and allow you to move
 forward.

 I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is very much
 possible that this memory does not correspond to an action that
 actually
 happened. The works of several psychologists have shown that memories
 can     <span class="floydstyle em">[but is she telling the truth?]</span>
 be constructed and modified by the brain in certain situations,
 including     <span class="floydstyle em">[or are Klein and the others pulling the</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">strings?]</span>
 situations of post-traumatic stress disorder. In your case, it could
 represent an adaptation strategy that your brain adopted in response
 to
 this catastrophic event:  the fact that it was accidental,
 unforeseeable
 and without any logic may be too much to take in. Which does not mean
 that    <span class="floydstyle em">["just make up an explanation, Dr Peters"]</span>
 you cannot function normally in other ways; it is a process that is
 very      <span class="floydstyle em">["something that sounds plausible, so that she gets that</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">idea out of her head"]</span>
 different from hallucinations or sensory malfunction, which are more
 worrying symptoms.

 Waiting for your reply,
 Take care of yourself,
 Dr Diane Peters

 Dear all,

 Don't forget! Tonight on Euronews, in the show "New Deals" hosted by
 Patrick Lecouturier, at 7pm French time, the Colonel Gérard Puiseux
 will answer questions on Ares Space's exploration program, the current
 mission, and prospects for the future. Another chance for Ares Space
 to
 let the mainstream audience know about its technologies and the
 breadth
 of the scientific and economic benefits of such an extraordinary
 mission.

 Hello Charlotte,

 For the last time, I'm asking you to stop insisting. It is
 literally impossible, whatever you may say.

 The ship did not stop sending frequent backups of the black box, all
 through the trip. We have in our possession two copies of the ship's
 parameters when the accident happened: an incomplete one sent by
 the ship, and one coming directly from the actual black box that was
 recovered by the base's robots, which we received a few days after
 the accident. Hence, when I tell you that this button wasn't pushed,
 by you or anyone else, you must believe me; we have definite proof
 of what we're saying here.

 I do not doubt that you are sincere, but think a little, will you?
 You
 went through a horrendous crash that was most likely traumatizing;
 your
 brain may have some misfires these days, and if I tell you that I'm
 absolutely certain that you didn't do it, then you didn't do it. I
 imagine
 those are the repercussions of the accident. Take some rest and come
 back
 quickly to 100% of your abilities. We need you.

 Colonel Frank Klein.

 <span class="floydstyle em">[...]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[he can say whatever he wants, i pushed the button]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[they're lying to me]</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[they want to make me doubt so I don't go insane]</span>

 Everything is shrouded in half-darkness, as always. Your sleeping bag
 is rolled in a ball, crumpled up in its usual spot in the corner of
 the room. In the opposite corner are your chair and computer desk.
 Your computer's looping the same playlist, as always. You spend most
 of your time here, although you go to the greenhouse from time to
 time. This is fine.

 To the north, a little alcove leads to the greenhouse door. The
 corridor leading to the rest of the base is south.

>listen

 <span class="floydstyle em">Cemetary Gates</span>, by Pantera. Haunted, tormented, violent, and
 those screams of pain at the end...

>inventory

 You are carrying nothing.

>examine bag

 Crumpled in the corner of the room where you sleep, the zipper wide
 open (you never close the zipper, because of the nightmares). When
 your bed is an air cushion about half a centimetre thick tied to a
 plastic sleeping bag, what's the use of making your bed every morning?
 It's keeping you warm, it's true, but as for the rest, it's neither
 very comfortable nor soft; everything is Spartan here. You feel like
 if you could sleep in a real bed, with a thick mattress and blankets
 that would wrap all around you and give you some soft, comforting
 heat, if you could sleep in it for one night -- no, a week -- a month
 -- or, rather, an eternity -- it would solve all your problems.

>examine chair

 As all the furniture in the base, this chair was built from a few
 metal rails, put together by the robots before you got here. The air
 cushion they fixed on it is a joke, not even a centimetre thick. You
 hate this chair, it is always cold, uncomfortable, and these days it
 seems even more unstable than usual. So you wriggle around on it when
 you have nothing to do, or when you're waiting for an email to arrive,
 and one of these days it will collapse and it will serve it right.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By the greenhouse</span>
 Through the glass door on your right, you can see the base's
 greenhouse, which enables you to survive for now -- and for how long?
 There are a few weird vegetables and a couple of herbs valiantly
 attempting to survive in this cold and hostile Martian soil,
 constantly monitored by the central computer for optimal conditions.
 South is the room where you live; the bathroom is north.

>examine herbs

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine vegetables

 Behind the Plexiglas door to the east is the base's greenhouse, where
 a few plants attempt to survive in the martian soil.

>go north

 You don't need to go to the toilet, and your next shower can wait. In
 any case, who cares about your body odor here?

>take vegetables

 You aren't inside the greenhouse.

 Your stomach rumbles, and the sensation of hunger is pretty intense.
 You have to find something to eat, to appease it for a while.

>enter greenhouse

 You open the door and enter the greenhouse.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Martian greenhouse</span>
 It's warm in here, almost too warm. The Martian soil is cold, harsh,
 and the plants that are trying to grow here need to always be humid
 enough, which is accomplished with the drip irrigation system,
 constantly monitored by the central computer. The handful of plants
 and the few vegetables you're supposed to eat try their best to
 survive under those conditions, far away from their natural ecosystem.
 They look weak and tired, almost depressed; you wonder if, despite all
 the computer's efforts, they will last for much longer. You can exit
 the greenhouse by going west.

>dig plants

 Digging would achieve nothing here.

>get plants

 Odd, you thought you saw something move behind a leaf. You pull your
 hand back quickly and freeze. It's impossible, unless...

>take plants

 Slowly, you go around the leaves where the movement seemed to come
 from...

 Something red, that...

 Ah! It's fine, it's one of the station's robots. For a moment you
 thought that... But no, it's impossible -- of course you're alone in
 this station. It could only be the robots.

>examine robots

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine robot

 The little red robot is Bob. You don't really know why, but that's the
 name he's been given. He's one of the two robots that live with you.
 They move around, but they don't have consciousness, and they aren't
 really capable of interacting with you -- robotics hasn't evolved fast
 enough to make robots that would be able to keep you company. They are
 controlled by the central computer, which gives them all sorts of
 tasks to perform in the base, from taking care of the plants to
 cleaning the rug, or even analysing samples.

>dig plant

 Digging would achieve nothing here.

> take vegetable

 You scratch and dig the soil a bit, and you find two carrots which
 look edible, as well as some mushrooms of adequate size, and a few
 leaves from a lettuce. You gulp down what you just harvested; the
 vegetables are rather bland, and whatever little taste they have has
 very little resemblance to vegetables from Earth, which makes eating
 them a strange experience. In no more than five minutes your meal is
 over, if you can call that a meal; you brush the soil off your hands
 as you get to your feet. The robots will take care of replanting when
 the sensors in the ground will have detected that the vegetables have
 been picked.

 Ah, you have an email -- your computer just made that noise.

>go east

 The greenhouse's only exit is west.

>go west

 You open the door and exit the greenhouse.

 data coming from the base's systems, from the humidity in the
 greenhouse to the air pressure in the airlocks; whenever needed, it
 sends orders to Bill and Bob, who are in a way its arms and legs. It
 was made to control thousands of systems and dozens of robots, but
 since the majority of the base is closed off, it is rather underused;
 right now it spends its days showing your emails and playing music.

 Hello Charlotte,
 <span class="floydstyle em">[hm, what does Tacker want?]</span>

 A little mission for you today, if you feel up for it. We'd like to
 try to redo some calculations on base operations, energy consumption,
 nutritional needs, all that stuff. So, could you try to go to the
 storeroom and tell us what's left there? Actually, what would be most
 useful for us would be to know how many protein loaves are left in the
 <span class="floydstyle em">[haha, he'll never say "recycled shit"]</span>
 storeroom. Let us know as soon as you can, so we can look into this
 over
 here.

 Take care of yourself.
 Tacker

 Hello Charlotte,

 I would like to offer, once more, an apology for yesterday's events.
 I
 hope that this incident will not prevent us from continuing our
 therapeutic process together. I am available whenever you want if you
 feel
 the need to communicate via video messages; just let me know when.

 Waiting for your reply,

 Your computer's looping the same playlist, as always. You spend most

 To the north, a little alcove leads to the greenhouse door. The
 corridor leading to the rest of the base is south.

>take bag

 You gaze at that pathetic bed, then you sigh. It's really fine where
 it is.

>go south

 You stop in front of the corridor and stare at it. You don't like this
 corridor. It takes you away from your comfort zone. Of course, you're
 alone in here. But tell that to your heart, which is already beating
 fast.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 You've never liked this corridor -- more precisely, you've always felt
 a bit queasy when walking in it, and you don't really need that right
 now. It is small, rather narrow, and the neon that's supposed to light
 it is blinking a pallid light. You really don't have a good feeling
 about it. That's also why you moved your sleeping bag to the main room
 north, so you don't have to walk in this corridor every night to go to
 the quarters, which are located next to the deactivated door at the
 south end of the corridor.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By the deactivated door</span>
 On the other side of the door, it is pitch black, or almost. This is
 the remainder of the base, which circuits have been deactivated after
 the catastrophe. Resources are rare, we can't afford to leave you
 access the whole base, which was designed to be used by the four of
 you. We put everything you might need in one wing. Let us know if you
 need anything else, but you should be fine. The storeroom is next to
 the door, towards the east; westwards, a bit further around the
 corner, is the dorm where the crew was supposed to sleep, which is now
 empty, and the corridor runs north to the main room.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storeroom</span>
 The storeroom is a small room, narrow but long, with metal shelves
 running along the walls, and the kitchen nook at the back -- a sparse
 one, with a sink and two electric burners. Of course, almost all the
 supplies were lost in the accident, and what remains here are the
 survival rations, so to speak. The shelves are thus almost all empty,
 apart from the two closest to the door, which are reasonably full;
 although most of it is that "space tofu", like everyone called it,
 even if there are other things like the sauces, your last shred of
 humanity. You can exit to the corridor by the deactivated door.

 You can see a yellow robot here.

>examine robot

 That's Bill. Bill and Bob, the base's two robots. Aside from their
 color, they are rigorously identical -- no difference whatsoever in
 their duties or their personalities, since they don't have any. They
 are dumb robots, servants to the central computer, who mostly do the
 upkeep of the base. In any case, they just don't stop -- they probably
 have more work than what they've been designed to do, since you don't
 do any of the tasks you were supposed to do. It's just as well:
 they're more efficient than you anyway. You need some time, or
 something else, but clearly not more orders to follow.

>count sauces

 No need to worry about salt, there are infinite supplies of it on
 Mars. As for sauces, there is barely half a dozen of small samples
 that aren't dehydrated, and several dozens -- fifty? a hundred? -- of
 dehydrated ones. So, not really enough to eat those every day.

>count loaves

 Alright, let's see.

 You put your arm behind the pile of tofu on the shelf, then in a big
 sweeping motion you push all that off the shelf. The tofu loaves fly
 and crash on the floor. This mayhem is of course pretty childish, but
 it makes you happy, and you burst out laughing.

 You bend down and start picking up the tofu loaves, putting them on
 the shelves by groups of five as you count them. You count out loud,
 to fill the silence, and to avoid losing track of the number. Finally,
 after ten minutes or so, you get to the end of the pile. "One
 sixteen!" you proclaim proudly. Then you repeat this number in your
 head several times, so as not to forget it. You should now go reply to
 the Major's email.

 You can see Bill here.

>examine sink

 A metal sink, almost normal except for the shape of the faucet: some
 kind of curved metal tube, with a motion detector. Of course, like all
 the water sources on the base, the water that flows is methodically
 recovered, treated and reused; you and the plants need it. But it's
 not really like you were lacking water here either: there's quite a
 bit of ice on Mars, and moreover the fuel cells which power the base
 (partly, the other part is coming from the Sun) create water as a
 byproduct when releasing energy. But all that costs energy or
 hydrogen, so everything is controlled and reused, in an effort to
 waste as little as possible.
 The sink is currently switched off.

>examine burners

 You can't see any such thing.

 Dear all,

 We are delighted to formally announce the beginning of a partnership
 between the Research & Development Department, here at Ares Space, and
 the
 one at FeatherTech, a Toulouse-based company offering innovative
 solutions
 in the design and the fabrication of lightweight objects, in order to
 make
 them less heavy while still maintaining their strength and solidity.

 Thanks to this partnership, Ares Space will be able to research
 solutions
 to lighten its space-exploring vehicles, as well as design and patent
 new
 technologies thanks to the solutions and expertise provided by
 FeatherTech.

 Have a nice day,
 Greta Werth
 Head of Research & Development, Ares Space

 Dear colleagues,

 Today, the United Aerospace Workers feel it is their responsibility
 to
 blow the whistle on the working conditions at Ares Space. Those
 working
 conditions are getting worse and worse, between unpaid hours of
 overtime
 and uncertainties surrounding the end-of-year bonus, as well as the
 pressure the company is putting its employees under.

 We already attempted to draw the attention of workers and the media
 to
 those working conditions two months ago, shortly before the
 catastrophe we
 all know about. Ever since then, the working conditions have not
 improved,
 and have even gotten worse. We report and criticize the following
 facts,
 which appeared within the last six weeks:
 - the constant changes in the workers' schedules;
 - the older model of shuttle being brought back in the factory
 without
 any complementary training given to the workers, which also puts
 new
 entrants at a disadvantage;
 - the contradictory orders and constant reconfiguration of the
 missions
 (order, content, durations, etc.), which betrays a clear lack of
 organization for the last six weeks;
 - inadequate psychological support and follow-up provided to
 employees.
 This also adds to our previous grievances, which were about the late
 payment or even sometimes the non-payment of overtime, or difficult
 schedules in the manufacturing unit when, as the recent events
 unfortunately show, ensuring both quality and security is paramount,
 and
 this requires to have qualified personnel be able to work under good
 conditions.

 We ask for our grievances to be heard by corporate management, and we
 wish
 to be given an interview with Mr Schwartz as soon as possible to
 discuss
 those points.

 Have a nice day,
 Your UAW representatives

 The harmful thoughts are coming back... It's hard to avoid them these

 meditate, or sleep. That's the way it is. Maybe it'll eventually get

 You look at your sleeping bag, and you suddenly feel an overwhelming
 weariness taking over, like it often happens. What's the point of all
 this? Why do all this, why does it matter? Your only desire right now
 is to curl up in a ball. And who will prevent you from that? You can
 do whatever you want.
 do whatever you want.Alright, that's enough for today. Weariness,
 fatigue, emptiness are heavy to bear, and you feel like you're going
 down a bad slippery slope. The best strategy is to go to bed,
 meditate, empty your head, let yourself drift in sleep; luckily,
 you've always managed to find sleep quickly and whenever you wanted
 it, ever since you were little.

 You slip inside your sleeping bag, and close your eyes. The thoughts
 are still racing in your mind, but you know the solution. You start
 counting, slowly, starting from fifty -- you and Dr Peters discovered
 that counting down only triggered visions of space shuttles, launches,
 stress, in your brain, and only brought the trauma back. Slowly,
 softly, steadily, focusing on every single syllable...

 The periscope is way up. You jump to reach it, but you can't grab it.

 Behind you, Eduardo smiles at you. "I'll help you."

 You feel his hands on your hips, and you jump, and you manage to hang
 to the periscope, then to climb up the tower, way up.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">On the submarine</span>
 You are standing on the submarine's metal hatch. You look around.
 Everything is dark, it's sunset. The sky is reddish, the water a dark
 blue. Not a wave, like a clear mirror made of water. Far away, an
 island.
>examine island

 You get down inside the ship.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">In the submarine</span>

 You push the red button, and the other three scream, shriek. You don't
 feel anything, but you jump. Their screams are very distinctly real
 and hurt your ears.

 The fire extinguisher next to you starts blowing steam out, like a
 pressure cooker. A horrible whistling noise, a high-pitched noise,
 getting louder and higher, like an alarm or a plane going down.
 Eduardo looks at you, as if he wasn't understanding what was happening
 to him, his eyes full of reproach.

 With an expression full of hate, Michel lunges for you, and you push
 him back. His head hits a crossbar and he starts bleeding inside his
 space suit. He starts melting inside his space suit, all you can see
 are red bubbles and his face decomposing quickly, his skull tearing
 off. You want to close your eyes but you can't.

 An explosion, and shrapnel floats parallel to you, in slow motion.
 Pieces of metal, the dials' hands, glass, knifes.

 You can't stop looking at Eduardo's face, torn apart by thousands of
 projectiles, his skin peeling off his skull in big shreds, the red
 color of his muscles, the red of his blood, his cry of pain, his face
 crumbing away, his skin tearing off...

 You turn around, and a grenade is right in front of your face, you see
 every single one of its details, and then it freezes, then explodes in
 your face...
>wait








 <span class="floydstyle em"></span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">[AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH]</span>

 You wake up, screaming, shaking, tense, sitting up, then quickly on
 your feet, but then just as quickly back down on all fours, curled up
 in a ball.

 Your heart is beating very fast, too fast, it's going to shut down on
 you. Your breathing is nothing but loud whimpers, gasps, sobs.

 After a few seconds, or minutes, of this intense terror, you manage to
 control yourself somewhat again, with great difficulty. That one was
 vivid. They all are. Dozens of terrible details that haunt you. Morbid
 dreams that you can still remember, even the little details, weeks
 later. All similar, all different, all terrifying.

 It's hard, but you get back up, and you stretch with a big sigh. You
 hate the days that start with nightmares. You can never quite shake
 them off, and the cloud hangs over your head the whole day through.
 Every day starts with a nightmare these days.

 Hello Charlotte,

 Our instruments picked up some anomalies in the base this morning,
 and
 the procedure is that we must inform you about them.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[interesting...]</span>

 Those measurements are ones produced by sensors placed in the room
 where
 beds for the crew were set up. Our previous measurements indicate that
 you haven't been using this room for sleeping for a few weeks, but we
 still measured important traces of organic life, most notably heat and
 some breathing.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[huh?]</span>

 You must have been sleeping in that room last night and of course
 <span class="floydstyle em">[i would never have done that!]</span>
 it is totally fine, but the procedure is such that we have to inform
 you
 of any activity that's out of the ordinary. The other explanation,
 which is admittedly a bit more worrying, is that you were subject to a
 temporary sleepwalking episode during the night, which is possible.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[sleepwalking? what next?]</span>
 If this is the case, we ask you to inform your referring
 psychiatrist, Dr Peters.
 <span class="floydstyle em">[oh god]</span>

 Have a nice day,

 Hello Charlotte,

 We got a problem: Bob seems stuck in the crew quarters!
 <span class="floydstyle em">[what?! how is that even possible?]</span>

 The central computer tried to fix him, even rebooting him, but it
 didn't work. We even tried to take over manually, but we don't know
 why
 he's responding but not moving, no matter what we try.

 It's really weird!! So, rather than sending Bill to the rescue and
 maybe
 cause him to get stuck because of the same thing (but what could it
 be?!)     <span class="floydstyle em">[but those robots are indestructible, they're not</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">supposed to be stuck, ever!]</span>
 we'd like you to go check it out. To see if it's something in the
 room,
 or if it's a software or hardware bug. Let us know what you can find,
 and
 if you can't see anything unusual we'll have to try to trace the bug
 in
 the code and update both of them.

 Let us know quickly please!! Thanks!!
 Tacker

 Dear all,

 We are delighted to announce, as an exclusive preview, that Ares
 Space will be featured on the cover of Forbes Magazine's next issue,
 out
 tomorrow, and which headline will be "Space, the Next Frontier for
 <span class="floydstyle em">[oh jesus, they don't have anything better to do than advertising</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">whoever is parroting our press releases?]</span>
 Growth".

 The magazine will feature a 16-page special report dedicated to
 companies involved in spatial exploration, describing advances and
 perspectives brought by this major technological breakthrough. But
 most importantly, the magazine dedicates three full pages to Ares
 <span class="floydstyle em">[and more patting on the back...]</span>
 Space, noting for instance that "the European public company was able
 to be ahead of the pack quickly and efficiently, making it a solid
 central actor for spatial exploration".

 Have a nice day,
 The Communication Department of Ares Space
 <span class="floydstyle em">[i should try to unsubscribe from their emails]</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office</span>
 Everything is shrouded in half-darkness, as always. Your sleeping bag
 is rolled in a ball, crumpled up in its usual spot in the corner of
 the room. In the opposite corner are your chair and computer desk.
 Your computer's looping the same playlist, as always. You spend most
 of your time here, although you go to the greenhouse from time to
 time. This is fine.

 To the north, a little alcove leads to the greenhouse door. The
 corridor leading to the rest of the base is south.

 Your stomach rumbles. You suddenly feel hungry as a wolf. You should
 drop by the storeroom on the way, so you can eat something before
 going to see what's up with Bob.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By the greenhouse</span>
 Through the glass door on your right, you can see the base's
 greenhouse, which enables you to survive for now -- and for how long?
 There are a few weird vegetables and a couple of herbs valiantly
 attempting to survive in this cold and hostile Martian soil,
 constantly monitored by the central computer for optimal conditions.
 South is the room where you live; the bathroom is north.

>go west

 There is nothing this way; you can go south to the main room, or go
 inside the greenhouse. You could also go in the bathroom to the north,
 but you don't really feel like it.

>go east

 You open the door and enter the greenhouse.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Martian greenhouse</span>
 It's warm in here, almost too warm. The Martian soil is cold, harsh,
 and the plants that are trying to grow here need to always be humid
 enough, which is accomplished with the drip irrigation system,
 constantly monitored by the central computer. The handful of plants
 and the few vegetables you're supposed to eat try their best to
 survive under those conditions, far away from their natural ecosystem.
 They look weak and tired, almost depressed; you wonder if, despite all
 the computer's efforts, they will last for much longer. You can exit
 the greenhouse by going west.

>get vegetables

 You absentmindedly nibble on a vegetable, which you find bland and
 tasteless. You need something heartier, with more proteins than this.

>go west

 You open the door and exit the greenhouse.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By the greenhouse</span>

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Office</span>
 Everything is shrouded in half-darkness, as always. Your sleeping bag
 is rolled in a ball, crumpled up in its usual spot in the corner of
 the room. In the opposite corner are your chair and computer desk.
 Your computer's looping the same playlist, as always. You spend most
 of your time here, although you go to the greenhouse from time to
 time. This is fine.

 To the north, a little alcove leads to the greenhouse door. The
 corridor leading to the rest of the base is south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Corridor</span>
 You've never liked this corridor -- more precisely, you've always felt
 a bit queasy when walking in it, and you don't really need that right
 now. It is small, rather narrow, and the neon that's supposed to light
 it is blinking a pallid light. You really don't have a good feeling
 about it. That's also why you moved your sleeping bag to the main room
 north, so you don't have to walk in this corridor every night to go to
 the quarters, which are located next to the deactivated door at the
 south end of the corridor.

>go west

 The corridor runs north to south.

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By the deactivated door</span>
 On the other side of the door, it is pitch black, or almost. This is
 the remainder of the base, which circuits have been deactivated after
 the catastrophe. Resources are rare, we can't afford to leave you
 access the whole base, which was designed to be used by the four of
 you. We put everything you might need in one wing. Let us know if you
 need anything else, but you should be fine. The storeroom is next to
 the door, towards the east; westwards, a bit further around the
 corner, is the dorm where the crew was supposed to sleep, which is now
 empty, and the corridor runs north to the main room.

 You should really do something about this robot -- but first, eating,
 quickly.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Storeroom</span>
 The storeroom is a small room, narrow but long, with metal shelves
 running along the walls, and the kitchen nook at the back -- a sparse
 one, with a sink and two electric burners. Of course, almost all the
 supplies were lost in the accident, and what remains here are the
 survival rations, so to speak. The shelves are thus almost all empty,
 apart from the two closest to the door, which are reasonably full;
 although most of it is that "space tofu", like everyone called it,
 even if there are other things like the sauces, your last shred of
 humanity. You can exit to the corridor by the deactivated door.

 You can see Bill here.

>get bill

 He rolls rather quickly -- and what's more, he weighs a ton.

>get loaf

 Appease the hunger once and for all, even if it means eating one of
 those disgusting loaves. You take one from the top of the shelf and
 start removing the wrapping.

 The loaf is almost small enough that it would fit whole in your mouth.
 Eurgh, why did you think about that -- now you're just picturing
 having your mouth completely filled with this thick and tasteless
 paste. You close your eyes and breathe, then eat one bite. Of course,
 it is tasteless; you take a pinch of salt and put it directly in your
 mouth: it's tolerable, but really not quite edible yet. Anyway, it
 never is. Had the payload not gone up in flames, you would have had
 all sorts of spices and herbs to plant, and even a few extra chemical
 aromas; but right now, with nothing of the kind, it's just unbearable.

 After ten minutes of that disgusting sensation in your mouth, you
 painstakingly finish the loaf. You feel satiated, except that you feel
 like throwing up. Eating here is a struggle, a difficult and really
 not a gratifying one. No wonder you feel depressed, and you're sure
 that a plate of beef bourguignon would heal you in a heartbeat. Five
 months before taste comes back...

>go east

 You can only leave the storeroom by going west.

>go west

 You go back towards the deactivated door, which is half shrouded in
 darkness; you feel knots in your stomach, tied there by a feeling of
 foreboding. You're filled with fear, without exactly knowing why.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By the deactivated door</span>
 Is it darker here than it was moments ago? Oddly, it does seem so. You
 don't feel very safe anymore all of a sudden; it's like everything was
 darker, the darkness thickening, growing more menacing from behind the
 door, like your reflection was blurrier. You close your eyes for a few
 seconds, but when you open them, it's the same thing, and your heart
 is racing even more. Maybe the fear of going towards the quarters to
 the west.

>go west

 Alright, when you gotta go... You take a deep breath before going
 towards the...
>go west
 towards the...

 A little flash of light to your left, in your peripheral vision.
 Behind the door. At least you think? You turn and face the door,
 slowly. It can't be, still, must be a...
>go west
 slowly. It can't be, still, must be a...

 NO you weren't mistaken you jump out and run as far as you can from
 this darkness but you end up in front of the quarters and they're in
 darkness too -- breathe, breathe goddamnit, calm down calm down.
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">By Crew Quarters</span>
 You can only gasp for air, which is burning your lungs; your head is
 spinning, your vision is blurring, your stomach is in a knot. Pure
 terror runs in your veins. Is there something, someone there?
 Impossible, impossible you tell yourself. But then why do you have
 this feeling of being watched, surrounded by a sinister shadow? You
 try to calm yourself by staring at the small light that's blinking in
 the dark room north; it's Bob, and he needs you.

>go north

 One last scream filled with rage, pain, fear. Come you, you have to
 come in now!

 You step forward slowly, shaking, your teeth clenched and your jaw as
 tense as it's ever been. You force yourself to relax it, you breathe
 through the mouth heavily but slowly. Singing, right, that would help.
 Singing anything, something rythmic, something catchy. You hum with a
 frail voice as you keep moving forward.

 One step into darkness -- that's good -- it'll be okay, don't focus on
 it, it's just a dark room -- two steps -- everything's okay -- fuck
 i'm entirely in darkness -- it's okay it's okay -- focus on something
 else

 Everything's fine. You take one more step, then another one, and
 nothing happens. Behind you, the light from the corridor makes you
 feel safer. You're not too far from Bob. It's almost over. A few more
 steps...

 Your right arm reaches for your computer. You don't really feel like
 you're in your body anymore. A sensation of lightness, detachment. You
 see yourself opening the "MUSIC" folder of your computer. You find it
 easily, you click on it, and the speakers boom out this happy music.
 Exactly what you want. Joy. Waves. Sun. You are in California. You
 smile. You let the music take over. Your body is dancing like it never
 danced before. You close your eyes and abandon yourself to the music.

 Come on, now you need to go rescue Bob. Take a deep breath...
 The little robot cries small beeps from time to time, like a little
 distress call.

 You can see Bob's little red diode blinking alone in the dark.

>go north

 One last scream filled with rage, pain, fear. Come you, you have to
 come in now!

 You step forward slowly, shaking, your teeth clenched and your jaw as
 tense as it's ever been. You force yourself to relax it, you breathe
 through the mouth heavily but slowly. Singing, right, that would help.
 Singing anything, something rythmic, something catchy. You hum with a
 frail voice as you keep moving forward.

 One step into darkness -- that's good -- it'll be okay, don't focus on
 it, it's just a dark room -- two steps -- everything's okay -- fuck
 i'm entirely in darkness -- it's okay it's okay -- focus on something
 else

 Everything's fine. You take one more step, then another one, and
 nothing happens. Behind you, the light from the corridor makes you
 feel safer. You're not too far from Bob. It's almost over. A few more
 steps...
