 Music:  Off Descriptions:  Verbose








  The robbery was bold, to say the least.  Eight diamonds, stolen from
 secure displays in the Kimberly Diamond Mining Company exhibit.  Four
 of the diamonds were rough and uncut, three beautifully finished.  The
 last diamond was the prize of the collection:  one of the largest
 diamonds in the world, presented to Queen Victoria by the company and
 on loan from her for this special exhibit.  All of them taken at once,
 quietly, under the noses of four well-trained guards.








 You knew there was going to be trouble.  The World's Fair was a place
 for fortunes to be made--legally or illegally, it mattered not to
 some.  Outside the fairgrounds, jobs were becoming harder to come by,
 and it was becoming increasingly evident to what lengths some men
 would go to earn what they considered rightfully theirs.  And so
 Chicago's grand Exposition has become not only a place of
 entertainment and education, but of profit, for those who are clever
 enough to take advantage.  Dreamers and schemers, fools and sharks,
 simple farmers and cynical cityfolk mingle together on the grounds.
 The Columbian Guards keep the peace and provide order as best they
 can, with your old friend, the most competent Carl Masters, in charge.
 But although he is well equipped to handle the minor crimes, he never
 had the best head for the more complex and devious.  And so he called
 you.

 Already, you have suspects; descriptions neatly typed up and pushed
 into your case dossier.  Greenback Bob was rumored to be working the
 Fair.  So was his sometime partner, Delbras; a dangerously clever
 foreigner who remains largely a mystery.  Perhaps you will learn more
 as soon as you get to your office in the Administration Building.
 Your job:  Find the precious stones, and capture those responsible.
 And while you're at it, you promise yourself to take the time to enjoy
 the sights and sounds of the one and only Columbian Exposition of
 Chicago, one of the most amazing spectacles in the World...

    You step off the train into a huge crowd of fairgoers, who jostle
 one another as they make their way along the platform.  You push your
 way through the throng, and finally make it out onto the fairgrounds,
 where you are momentarily stunned by the sheer size, the monumental
 beauty of the new city standing before you...



 Court of Honor, In Front of Terminal Station
    You are in a large courtyard, surrounded by buildings the style and
 grandeur of which you have never seen before.  This is the Court of
 Honor, by all accounts already considered one of the architectural
 wonders of the modern world.  To the west stands Terminal Station,
 your arrival and eventual departure point, from which thousands of
 visitors pour into the Exposition each day.  To the east is the
 Administration Building, its golden dome towering above the grounds in
 grand style.  The plaza extends to the north and south, toward more
 monumental buildings.

>inventory
 You have a case dossier.

 Although still early in the day, it's getting hot.


>examine dossier
 It's a packet of papers that pertain to the case at hand.  The case
 dossier is closed.

>open dossier
 Opening the case dossier reveals a crime scene note, a description of
 Greenback Bob, a description of Delbras, a list of stolen diamonds,
 and a detailed crime report.

>examine list
 The Kimberly Diamond Mining Company compiled a list of the missing
 items:

            4 rough, unfinished diamonds
            3 cut and polished diamonds
            1 crown diamond

 The jewels were from the private collection of one of the board
 members of the Company.  If any are found, they may be taken to a Mr.
 Wentworth, an expert in the matter of precious stones, who will verify
 if the stone in question is indeed from the collection.  Mr. Wentworth
 can be found at his company's exhibit in the Mines and Mining
 Building.

 Verified stones should then be held in evidence in the safe in your
 office at the Administration building.

>examine note
 The note is written in a cribbed, narrow hand.  It reads:

            Four brothers, rough and ready,
            Three sisters, kind and fair,
            They left their home so eagerly,
            They left to see the Fair!

            Young Dennis likes spelunking,
            In darkness feared and great;
            Fair Ida likes to swim,
            And tempt the hands of fate.

            Bullish Adam stays outdoors,
            Free and strong and wild;
            Mary studies Egyptian script,
            And writes her name in style.

            Little Owen lobbied hard
            And entered government,
            Elder Neal rides the rails
            With an artistic temperament.

            Dolores spends her time
            In the cabin of Uncle Tom,
            And Mother...where is mother?
            She watches over them all.

>examine description of bob
 Before boarding the train to the fair, you carefully typed out a
 detailed description of Greenback Bob, should you find that he is
 indeed involved and need to share the information quickly.

 Greenback Bob is a counterfeiter, or at least so it is believed; no
 one has been able to catch him at it, yet.  He is known to be a
 reckless gambler.

 The Police reports describe him as follows:

 Nationality:  American

 Age:  twenty-eight to thirty years

 Height:  five feet four inches, approximately

 Weight:  one hundred eighty pounds, approximate

 General remarks:  figure heavy but muscular; somewhat slovenly
 appearance; broad, flat nose and squinty brown eyes; hair brown; He
 typically wears a long, unkempt beard, dark brown in color.  Quick to
 anger but faster still to escape.

>examine description of delbras
 Before boarding the train to the fair, you carefully typed out a
 detailed description of Delbras, should you find that he is indeed
 involved and need to share the information quickly.

 Of Delbras, you know very little.  You know, first, that he has
 recently fled Paris, which had become too hot for him, and that he was
 headed to the Fair, for what purpose it can only be guessed.  From
 Paris, a dispatch had been received describing him as handsome,
 educated, and familiar with the ways of good society.  Although still
 unproven, he is suspected in a string of diamond robberies in Paris.

 Further, the French report describes him as follows:

 Nationality:  French

 Age:  probably about thirty to thirty-three years

 Height:  six feet

 Weight:  one hundred seventy-five pounds, approximate

 General remarks:  figure good; square shoulders, military air;
 features, regular; thin-lipped; chin sharply pointed; wears at times a
 heavy beard, at others moustache and goatee; eyes dark, called black;
 hair same, heavy, and sometimes worn quite long; hands well kept, with
 long slender fingers; speaks English perfectly; a small triangular
 scar upon temple close to roots of hair.

>examine me
 You look about the same as always.

>xyzzy
 You practice your alphabet again, but stumble at the point where you
 reach the end and try going backwards.

>sing
 I don't know the word "sing".

>look

 Standing in a commanding position in the room is a tall,
 broad-shouldered man wearing a brown overcoat and smoking a thick
 cigar.  You recognize him instantly-- Carl Masters, one of the most
 highly regarded detectives in Chicago.  You heard that he had been
 hired for the Fair, to oversee all the detective work, and to do a
 little himself, when the case warranted it.  He had his hands full,
 you knew, and it was at his suggestion that Fair Management contacted
 your offices.  He sees you as you enter.

 "Well, well, well!"  he shouts, smiling.  "It's good to see you made
 it.  What do you think of this White City of ours?"

 You are about to respond, but quickly realize your old friend is not
 interested in wasting time with idle pleasantries just now.  He
 continues:

 "And yet surrounded by beauty such dastardly deeds occur."  He shakes
 his head. "I don't need to tell you, but I'm very glad you have
 finally arrived.  We're in the thick of it now.  This diamond
 heist--I'm counting on you for it.  We have no one to spare.  As for
 myself, I have a vexing and rather unpleasant affair--you can read
 today's paper about it if you like; a kidnapping, for ransom, no less;
 a young, moneyed gent from Boston took a wrong turn late at night.
 The family wired yesterday--they've been asked for a ransom but they
 seem unwilling to pay it.  No leads yet."  He takes another puff on
 his cigar.  "I'm trying to convince the family to come down and have a
 go at it; we might yet be able to nab the culprits during the
 exchange.  It's a delicate business."

 Masters turns his full attention on you.  "I'm sorry, best forget
 about my case and concentrate on yours.  Now listen carefully.  Your
 office is all set up; there's a safe inside in which you can deposit
 any of the stolen gems you recover.  There's also a bill of draft on
 the desk, you can use it to withdraw a daily spending allowance from
 the bank in this building.  Sorry for the trouble, but as I say, we
 really have no one to spare.  They will write you up new drafts daily,
 so you can just head over to the bank when it opens first thing each
 morning to withdraw your stipend."

 "I'll try to be here, in the office, every morning until around nine.
 If you like, we can compare notes and discuss the case.  If you have
 any questions, just ask.  And if you find anything out, tell me as
 soon as you can.  I've got to leave soon, but..."  He pauses for a
 moment.  "I almost forgot.  I'm afraid they haven't given you carte
 blanche.  You're here as a detective in an unofficial capacity.  So
 don't expect vendors and customers to part the red sea for you.  I've
 distributed your picture among the guards, they know who you are and
 should be able to provide assistance.  If they see trouble, they will
 come get me.  I should be able to take care of any bureaucratic messes
 you get into, but just be careful."

 "I'm sure you'll want to get familiar with the fairgrounds.  They're
 quite expansive, but essential to know if you want to get any proper
 detective work done, at least in my experience.  I left a guidebook in
 your desk.  There's also a tour that leaves at eleven-thirty every day
 from just outside the east entrance to this building which you may
 want to take as well."

 You shake hands.  "Welcome to Chicago," he says, smiling.

>go north
 Office
    Your office is small but comfortable.  An old, oak desk occupies
 most of the room.  Beside the desk, on the floor, squats a very
 solid-looking metal safe.  Against the far wall is an army cot.  You
 specially requested the cot--it's far easier to sleep in the office
 when the crime is as complicated as this one.
    Sitting on the desk is a bill of draft.

 Office.

 Detective Masters calls out to you.  "I've got to do some footwork.
 We'll meet again, tomorrow morning at the latest."  He walks out of
 the station, and into the fair.

 The Northern Trust Bank
    This branch of the Northern Trust Bank is the official bank of the
 Exhibition, offering terrible exchange rates for all the major
 currencies.  A row of tellers stand behind windows mounted on a long,
 thin counter, and process exhibition-goers transactions with
 indifference.  The rotunda is back to the southeast.

 The only teller you can see in the crowded bank is the one nearest the
 door.  She processes customers with a grim efficiency, the line in
 front of her window stretching nearly to the entrance of the bank.

 It's the Official Guide to the World's Columbian Exposition that was
 sent ahead to you to familiarize yourself with the fairgrounds.  You
 can look up buildings and monuments for more detailed information
 about them, if you like.

>so this is the in-game version of that guide.
 I don't know the word "so".

>look up midway in guide
 You flip open the guidebook and read.

 Midway Plaisance extends from the grounds of the World's Columbian
 Exposition to Washington Park, and covers an area of 80 acres.  The
 exhibits on Midway Plaisance are made by concessionaires, although
 some of them are endorsed and even owned by foreign governments.
 Admission fees are charged to many of them. They have no connection
 with the Exposition proper except as side attractions.  Near the
 western approach is the great Ferris Wheel, from which bird's eye
 views may be had of the entire Exposition.  This to some extent, takes
 the place of an Eiffel tower.  Visitors are hurled 250 feet into the
 air, in cars similar to coaches in construction.

 The tellers are all very busy.  They do work very fast, however.


>look up washington park in guide
 I don't know the word "park".

>look up rotunda in guide
 You flip open the guidebook and read.  After browsing for a few

 front of you and slaps down her money.


>elbow lady
 I don't know the word "elbow".

>wait
 Time passes...

 "Ah'd like to break this hunnert," she says, and the young teller
 mechanically smiles and does so, hardly noticing the old woman is
 there at all.


>wait
 Time passes...

 The old lady hobbles off.  The teller looks through you.  "May I help
 you?"


>give draft to teller

 The teller mechanically takes your bill of draft, and hands you an
 envelope containing your spending stipend for the day.  "Thank you
 sir, and have a nice day," she says listlessly.

 (Your score has just gone up by 2 points.)

 The Court of Honor
    You are in the Court of Honor, on a grand plaza which surrounds the
 Administration Building, which here opens up to a glorious vista the
 likes of which you have never seen nor imagined before.  It is a great
 city which stands before you, each building of monolithic size and
 classical design.  The buildings of this great city surround a
 man-made basin to rival the size of some lakes.  This is the fabled
 'White City,' built a mere twenty years after the tragic Chicago Fire
 left the city in ruins.

 The Administration Building takes a commanding position at the western
 end of the Grand Basin.  Standing directly in front of the eastern
 entrance to the building is a statue of Columbus, in whose honor the
 fair has been dedicated.  Directly across from him, an elaborate
 fountain rises from the basin waters, dozens of figures standing,
 sitting, and rowing in a boat the discoverer himself would have been
 proud to command.  At the other end of the basin the emblem of the
 fair stands:  a gilt sculpture of a woman, fair Columbia, climbing
 magnificently to a height of sixty-five feet above the basin waters.
 The plaza continues to the north and south, toward more monumental
 buildings.

 The Court of Honor
    You are in the Court of Honor, on a grand plaza which surrounds the
 Administration Building, which here opens up to a glorious vista the
 likes of which you have never seen nor imagined before.  It is a great
 city which stands before you, each building of monolithic size and
 classical design.  The buildings of this great city surround a
 man-made basin to rival the size of some lakes.  This is the fabled
 'White City,' built a mere twenty years after the tragic Chicago Fire
 left the city in ruins.

 The Administration Building takes a commanding position at the western
 end of the Grand Basin.  Standing directly in front of the eastern
 entrance to the building is a statue of Columbus, in whose honor the
 fair has been dedicated.  Directly across from him, an elaborate
 fountain rises from the basin waters, dozens of figures standing,
 sitting, and rowing in a boat the discoverer himself would have been
 proud to command.  At the other end of the basin the emblem of the
 fair stands:  a gilt sculpture of a woman, fair Columbia, climbing
 magnificently to a height of sixty-five feet above the basin waters.
 The plaza continues to the north and south, toward more monumental
 buildings.

 The Corinthian colonnade which makes up the northern facade of
 Machinery Hall continues here, unbroken.  Further east, you see one of
 the building's corner pavilions.  To the west is the northern entrance
 to the hall, a semi-circular portico with Corinthian columns, with
 towers on either side.

 The guide continues.  "Tall spires rise in the center of the
 structure, to the west, and graceful domes cap the two extremities,
 one of which rises before us here.  Long rows of graceful pillars lend
 lightness and harmony to the two facades, and form a fitting
 background for the beauties of the Court of Honor.  You can't see them
 well from here, but atop the towers on either side of each entrance
 are winged victories, huge draped figures, yet of such nice harmony
 that they seem to spring out into the air in very abandon of joy."

 "The idea of the Columbian Fountain is as felicitous as its execution.
 High on a barge of state, Columbia sits enthroned.  The barge is rowed
 by eight young goddesses, who typify the arts and sciences.  They seem
 instinct with life.  Surely not mortal blood but the ichor of the gods
 must animate these lissome, glowing limbs!"  the guide gets louder and
 more animated as he continues.  "Gracefully they bend to their work,
 each head turned in a natural position, and showing a face full of
 delicate charm.  They handle the long oars with the ease of practiced
 rowers, and one looks to see the barge glide over the crystal waters
 like a thing of life and beauty."

>wait

 "And look!"  the guide suddenly shouts, pointing at the fountain.
 "Old Father Time is at the helm.  His long beard sweeps like foam
 across his muscular breast.  As he leans backward, bearing on the
 tiller, the splendid muscles of his arms and limbs are revealed.
 There is no sign of decrepitude here, but an aspect of sustained vigor
 that seems to defy the ravages of eras and aeons."

 "And look again!"  the guide shouts, the crowd murmuring in
 excitement.  "A winged trumpeterstands at the prow with one foot

 "High up in the center, on a chair of state, Columbia sits, calm,

 quieting a bit, still staring at the Columbian Fountain in reverence.
 Then he picks up again.  "Mighty tritons upon massive steeds rise from
 the water as though to pay homage to the glorious galley and its
 god-like crew.  The men and steeds are full of the very passion of
 life; the mere sight of them makes the blood tingle in the veins."  He
 turns back to the tour group.  "The MacMonnies fountain is an
 inspiration; it is one of those perfect things that hold their place
 in the mind, and exercise a gentle tyranny over it.  We feel like
 judging all other objects in sculpture by this perfect standard, and
 almost envy the sculptor his success.  Come -- we have much more to
 see."  And with that, he heads east.

 South Canal Bridge
    This magnificent bridge is guarded on either side by bold
 sculptures of animals native to North America; on the west side of the
 bridge are two bison, on the east; a pair of moose.  The canal empties
 into the basin to the north; you can see that it ends a short distance
 to the south, where an imposing obelisk juts out from the waters.

 gestures south.

>examine canal
 The canal waters flow into the Columbian Basin.

 "The canal in the center reflects like a mirror the statuary and the
 beautiful buildings on either side.  There is hardly a prettier bit of
 scenery on the grounds than this; all that art could do to make it
 beautiful has been accomplished.  Directly at the southern end of the
 canal, facing the central arch of the Colonnade, a reproduction of
 Cleopatra's Needle towers to a great height.  The arch of the
 Colonnade, directly beyond, forms the grand entrance to a station of
 the Intramural Railway.  The live-stock pavilion is immediately in the
 rear.  The whole forms a very tasteful piece of architecture, and
 makes a beautiful background for the Canal and the many statues that
 adorn its borders."  He turns to the group.  "Follow me, please," he
 says, and heads east.

 The large, gilded dome of the Administration Building is a proud
 monument of the Fair, towering over the other buildings in the Court
 of Honor and visible from most anywhere on the grounds.  The building
 itself is constructed in three stages, each stacked upon the other
 like a cake.  The bottom stage consists of four large pavilions, one
 at each corner, with entryways between.  The second stage of the
 building is ringed with an open Ionic colonnade, the white columns
 contrasting vividly with the red walls behind them.  The third stage
 is the golden dome, which rises over 250 feet above the ground.

 The guide quietly admires the Administration Building for a moment.
 "Words would be inadequate, we must make do with our eyes alone."

 The column is decorated with representations of boats, sticking out of
 it like spikes, each prow and stern masterfully carved.  At the top of
 the column, far over the heads of the crowd, stands Neptune, clutching
 his trident.

 The tour guide turns away from the group to face the Agriculture
 Building.  "Some of you may be reminded, when looking at the
 Agriculture Building, of the Duomo of Milan with its profusion of
 statuary, though of course the architecture is completely different.
 It's front stretches for 800 feet along the Grand Basin; presenting a
 forest of pillars, looking as though it has been carved out of a
 mountain of snow."

>examine agricultural building
 The stately and Roman-style Agricultural Building is a powerful
 presence on the southern side of the Basin.  You stand near one of the
 great corner pavilions of the structure, the symmetric facades of the
 building, comprised of Ionic columns within arched recesses, extend
 both east and south from here toward grand entrances.  The corner
 pavilion is topped by a sculpture group of four women, supporting a
 hollow globe ringed with signs of the zodiac.

 "Directly in front of us is one of the four corner pavilions of the
 building, the domes of which rise to a height of some ninety-six feet.
 The tops of the domes are surmounted by statuary, in this case 'The
 Races of Man' by Martini."  the guide gestures toward the top of the
 corner pavilion.

>examine globe

 'The Races of Man' by Philip Martini.
 ______________________________________________________________________

 The sculpture depicts four women, of seemingly identical features,
 with their arms stretched out above their heads, their garments
 loosely wrapped around them, their upper bodies mostly exposed.  They
 stand in a circle, facing outwards, and in the middle, as if supported
 on their backs, is a hollow globe ringed by signs of the zodiac.

 "Martini's group may remind us of the group in the center of the
 Monumental Fountain in the Luxembourg Gardens by Carpeaux, but it is
 by no means an imitation, on the contrary, it has many original
 features.  Martini's work has much more airy lightness than
 Carpeaux's.  The figures in Martini's sculpture represent the four
 races, or in other words, the four principal families of the human
 race, inhabiting Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.  The globe implies
 that the figures beneath it stand for all the races of the world.  The
 bodies are all young and lithe, the draperies winding about them in a
 singular graceful fashion.  As an interesting side note, Martini only
 used one figure for the group and added different heads as his time
 was too short to allow work on other models."

>wait
 Time passes...

 The guide turns back to the assembled group.  "Martini has
 accomplished an enormous amount of work in addition to these
 sculptures, and has done a great deal toward rendering the Agriculture
 Building one of the finest of the Fair.  He has shown an extraordinary
 and fertile imagination, directed by excellent good sense and
 disciplined taste.  Such masterly productions in every instance speak
 well for the future decoration of American cities and public
 buildings.  Let's move on, shall we?"  he finishes, and heads to the
 east, tour group in tow.

>go east
 Court of Honor, North Side of Agriculture Building
    The Romanesque-style Agriculture Building stands immediately to the
 south, its central dome reaching 130 feet from the ground.  Its
 entrance is framed by Corinthian columns, and decorated by allegorical
 figures, surrounded by grain and fruit, and rising above them the
 branching horns of an oxen.  A large sculpture of Diana tops the
 building's central dome.  Directly to the north, a boat landing
 extends out into the basin, between two life-sized statues of oxen
 facing out toward Manufactures and Liberal Arts on the opposite side.

 The guide pauses for a moment while the group collects around him.
 "I'm feeling a bit hungry, aren't you?"  he says, to murmurs of
 approval.  "Well, this is the Agriculture building, is it not?  Inside
 its walls are displayed all of the myriad ways mankind has learned to
 bring food from the earth.  It's a bit too crowded to go in at the
 moment, but I've planned ahead and arranged a bit of a sampler for
 everyone."  He gestures to a couple boys waiting in the vestibule.
 They come out, with trays filled with a variety of food samples.  They
 hand out the food to each member of the tour.  One of them hands you a
 warm waffle, folded in half, and filled with sweet jam.  It looks
 delicious.

>examine waffle
 It's a large waffle, folded over and filled with jam.

 "While everyone is eating," the guide says, "I direct your attention
 to the two cow statues standing in front of the building, looking out
 over the basin."

>eat waffle
 It's quite sweet and delicious.  You devour it all too quickly.

 "The statue is titled 'Plenty.'  Look at the woman in this sculpture,
 she how she appears in perfect harmony with the noble animal she leans
 against; she is not of the goddess type; no serene mystery envelops
 her; there is no atmosphere of majesty about her; this is a simple
 countrywoman, such as one might see any day in the year in rural
 regions," the guide explains, reaching out and touching the statue,
 briefly.  "How strong, yet proportionate, the arms!  How large and
 flexible the hands!  In her face we see that dreamy look, common to
 those who are much alone in the fields.  In ancient times the
 daughters of kings and princes attended cattle, so that this figure is
 quite in keeping with history."

 You take a moment to examine one of the sculptures.  This one
 represents a simple countrywoman, leaning against a great and sturdy
 cow.  The cow gazes serenely into the distance.  The woman wears a
 rough hide, fashioned into a primitive dress, and has a dreamy,
 relaxed expression.

 "The cow against which the woman leans," the guide continues, "is
 perhaps a little too modern for the figure; it is of the Holstein
 breed, chosen probably on account of its massive proportions; it is
 full-fed, sleek and beautiful, with a grand head and great, mild eyes.
 The olden Greeks showed an excellent appreciation of beauty when they
 called the Queen of Olympus, 'The Ox-eyed Juno,' for nothing can equal
 the expressive mildness of the eye of a cow or an ox.  And now, if
 everyone has finished eating...?"  he pauses.  "Good.  Please follow
 me."  He walks off to the east.

>go east
 Northeast Corner of Agriculture Building
    You are at the northeast corner of the Agriculture Building.  In
 the basin directly to the north, you see the proud profile of the
 Statue of the Republic. The plaza continues east toward the Peristyle

 Directly east is the great Peristyle, which closes off the Court of
 Honor from Lake Michigan just beyond.  Before we go further towards
 the Peristyle, however, I would like to direct your attention to the
 giant statue your eye has no doubt already drifted to many times
 before on our tour:  The Statue of the Republic, rising out of the
 Grand Basin just to the north and east of our current position."

 gilded a brilliant gold.

 "The 'Republic' is by sculptor Daniel Chester French, who won the
 medal in last year's Paris Salon for his splendid work, 'Death and the

 The tour guide opens his arms wide, as if he would embrace the Statue
 of the Republic, if only it were close enough.  "Sheer out of the
 water, the statue rises to a height of sixty-five feet.  It is a
 majestic figure of a woman so admirably proportioned that the mere
 size counts for little in the observer's mind.  Her face is full of
 power and repose.  Not such repose as one sees in the awful visage of
 the Sphynx, its calm eyes looking out upon the Libyan sands, but the
 repose of certain force inherent in the nature of the god-like woman.
 No nobler idea could be conceived in the conscious yet gracious power
 of a great nation whose majesty the statue so well represents."

 "Even Greece, with her beautiful violet sky and exquisite color tone,"
 the guide says, "could not furnish a better surrounding for such a
 statue than the present site affords.  With the lovely arch of the
 peristyle, crowned with the quadriga in the background, it is a sight
 for the gods.  Come, lets get a closer look at that peristyle, now."
 He waves everyone forward, to the east.

 East End of the Court of Honor
    The East End of the Court of Honor is closed by the Peristyle
 complex:  A long, double colonnade with a statue-lined roof, flanked
 by identical pavilions.  In the center of the Peristyle is a large
 triumphal arch, called the Water Gate, under which basin waters flow
 into Lake Michigan.  You are standing in an open plaza, just next to
 the Peristyle.  To the north is the Water Gate, and to the south
 stands the southern pavilion, which has been dubbed "The Casino."  The
 Casino is simply a pre-boarding waiting area for those leaving the

 ancient Greece and Rome, and while the American genius is said to be
 purely practical, it proves that the esthetic sense is by no means

 stands the southern pavilion, which has been dubbed "The Casino."  The
 Casino is simply a pre-boarding waiting area for those leaving the
 fairgrounds by steamer.  The Court of Honor extends back toward the
 west.
    A guide is here, leading a tour group through the grounds.

 The guide continues to rhapsodize about the Peristyle.  "So perfect is
 its workmanship; and so harmonious the setting, that it seems as
 though the Exposition was made for it, and not that it was made for
 the Exposition.  In the pellucid floor of the Grand Basin it
 duplicates itself, and each pillar seems to tremble with joy at the
 contemplation of its own reflection; viewed in any light, it
 fascinates the gaze.  How sweet it is to think that great things and
 great thoughts cannot die; that out of the raw young life of the
 prairies should spring this lovely bit of Grecian genius!  And mounted
 on top, ladies and gentlemen -- the Columbus Quadriga."

 "The Columbian Quadriga is the joint work of Messrs.  French and
 Potter, the figures being by the former and the horses by the latter.
 In the chariot, Columbus stands looking out into the far distance.
 His face bears traces of anxiety curbed by indomitable will.  There is
 withal a certain dreaminess in the face, well-befitting a man who has
 pondered so long in solitude the great projects he afterwards
 developed."

 The guide continues to describe the Columbus Quadriga.  "Four noble
 war-horses are harnessed to the chariot.  Every point of the finest
 blood is admirably brought out by Mr.  Potter.  Massive as they are,
 the small heads and ears betoken the Andalusian blood, which is hardly
 removed from the best Arab stock. They are led by female grooms, who
 look fully as spirited as the animals they restrain.  They may be said
 to be perfect models of Grecian beauty, quite different from the
 'Republic,' which has more of the Roman caste of beauty.  Their
 beautifully moulded arms show to great advantage in the pose they
 assume, which throws out their finely modelled busts.  There is an air
 of nobility about the whole group, and along with the 'Republic' and
 the Columbian Fountain, ranks as the very best sculpture this
 Exposition has to offer."

 Building towards the White Horse Inn, and east, over the inlet on a
 narrow bridge.  On the other side of the bridge, on a small peninsula
 of land, stands a replica of La Rabida convent, where Columbus
 gathered his strength before making his first transatlantic journey.

 Looking across South Pond, other points of interest take shape.  On
 the west side of the pond, a vast tangle of windmills spin in the lake

 You take a moment to examine one of the sculptures.  The sculpture
 consists of a gigantic horse, a work horse, and a young man, who holds
 in one hand a great shovel and the other leans against the horse's
 side.  The man is certainly a farmer, and the horse used for pulling
 his plow.

 "The group consists of a sturdy son of toil, one hand clasping the
 long handle of an old-fashioned Celtic spade, the other resting on the
 collar of a gigantic horse, against which he leans," the guide
 explains.  "The sculptor has been careful not to idealize his subject
 too highly.  The impression the group leaves upon the mind is that of
 splendid reserved power.  The horse is of the sturdy Flanders breed,
 noted for endurance.  Every muscle is clearly brought out.  The
 massive hoofs rest upon the pedestal as though conscious of the
 immense weight of the animal they support.  The head shows a slight
 mixture of blood somewhat resembling those of the horses seen in the
 French Provinces.  The harness is of the simple kind used by
 ploughmen, and the idea of a plough-horse is carried out by the
 skillful bobbing of the tail."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "The man leaning against the horse is a splendid specimen of the
 agricultural laborer," the guide continues, "long-limbed and stalwart;
 his bare arms show the corded muscles of practiced strength, and his
 long, powerful limbs seem well fitted to carry him over the rich
 furrows of the well-ploughed field.  But it is the face that holds
 one's attention.  This is no stolid boor, no slave of some callow
 lordling or country squire, but a man every inch of him, and an
 intelligent man at that.  Full of independence, his eye looks out from
 beneath his broad-brimmed hat as though challenging equality with the
 countless thousands who come to gaze on him.  Such a look must have
 been in the eyes of the men whom Wat Tyler led eighty thousand strong
 to the capture of London when Richard the Second was king.  As they
 moved along they sang the quaint doggerel:

    "When Adam delved and Eve span
    Where was then the gentleman?

 "They could all understand that it had in it the germs of modern

 "Here we have another of the Electric Fountains, quiet by day, but at
 night, bursting forth into myriad jets of jewelled water, shot through
 with all the colors of the rainbow, now green as any emerald, now red
 as the burning heart of a ruby, then a delicate sapphire, changing to
 the liquid yellow of the topaz, and again glistening like molten
 silver to change, as with the touch of a magician, into the varied
 hues of the diamond."

 Which fountain do you mean, the MacMonnies Fountain, or the electric
 fountain?

>examine electric fountain
 The electric fountain is a tangle of unsightly pipes.  It doesn't run
 during the day.

 Building, and marvel."  the guide continues to the west.

    You are in a grand plaza.  Directly to the north stands the
 Electricity Building, its portico and entryway illustrated with

 The guide pauses.  He clears his throat.  "The great Electricity
 Building is before us, its numerous towers rising above the corner
 pavilions and the entrances.  Forty years ago such a building would
 not have been necessary.  Then the telegraph was still young, a giant
 at play, hardly yet harnessed to the chariot of progress.  The
 electric pulse did not yet beat beneath the broad bosom of the
 Atlantic, and men would have laughed at the idea that the time would
 ever come when the submarine cable would divide the world thrice, and
 leave something over for a good start on the fourth.  Then cities were
 lighted with oil-lamps, or gas of hardly greater brilliancy, and men
 never dreamed that streets, churches, theaters, offices, hotels, and
 private houses would be brilliantly lighted by touching a button.  A
 man would have been called crazy who asserted that human speech could
 be carried 1000 miles on a wire, and messages in plain tones delivered
 hundreds of miles."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "That old world seems very far away now," the guide continues.  "How
 bewildered our grandfathers would be if they could rise from their
 graves and see how business is now done; how cars run without horses,
 turning as by magic and stopping instantly as at a word of command;
 how rooms are kept cool by electric fans, and servants called by
 electric bells; how diseases are cured by electricity, and how it is
 made to do the will of man in thousands of ways!  Our poor ancestors
 would wish to retire hastily from a world that has gone so far beyond
 them.  Edison, whom we revere as the modern wizard, would not receive
 from them the golden medal of well-earned fame, but rather the chill
 dungeon, or even the fate of the martyr."

>wait
 Time passes...

 "So many thoughts surge into our minds as we gaze on the wonderful
 building before us.  What mysteries it contains, what wonders are yet
 in store for us!  Once the lives of men were flat and tame as the
 prairies we saw from the roof of Manufactures, now through this great
 agent, as the building has sprung up from the level plain, our hopes
 for humanity are constantly up-springing, for we feel that God would
 never have given us this great power in charge if He did not love His
 people."  The tour guide takes off his hat, and pauses in reflection,
 looking onto the Electricity Building.

 Then -- "And now if you will follow me, ladies and gentlemen--" he
 says, and heads off to the south.

>go south
 The Court of Honor
    You are in the Court of Honor, on a grand plaza which surrounds the
 Administration Building, which here opens up to a glorious vista the
 likes of which you have never seen nor imagined before.  It is a great
 city which stands before you, each building of monolithic size and
 classical design.  The buildings of this great city surround a
 man-made basin to rival the size of some lakes.  This is the fabled
 'White City,' built a mere twenty years after the tragic Chicago Fire
 left the city in ruins.

 The Administration Building takes a commanding position at the western
 end of the Grand Basin.  Standing directly in front of the eastern
 entrance to the building is a statue of Columbus, in whose honor the
 fair has been dedicated.  Directly across from him, an elaborate
 fountain rises from the basin waters, dozens of figures standing,
 sitting, and rowing in a boat the discoverer himself would have been
 proud to command.  At the other end of the basin the emblem of the
 fair stands:  a gilt sculpture of a woman, fair Columbia, climbing
 magnificently to a height of sixty-five feet above the basin waters.
 The plaza continues to the north and south, toward more monumental
 buildings.
    A guide is here, leading a tour group through the grounds.

 "One last sight is worthy of mention before we conclude the tour, and
 that is not another building, monument, nor sculpture, but the people
 who walk among this new city."  The guide smiles as he continues, "We
 are a motley crew, surely, who wander through this Elysium; the sturdy
 cowboy jostles the Russian nobleman; the sallow Turk shoulders the
 fair-haired Swede; the lithe American damsel walks side by side with
 the burly English soldier, and the soft-treading son of Japan finds
 himself pushed by the impatient Westerner.  The French have often been
 called the most polite nation in the world, but France must surrender
 the palm to America.  There is no quarreling here, no loud talking, no
 profanity nor rowdiness; all is peace, good-will, and kindliness.  No
 multitude on earth could be assembled elsewhere with so little
 friction as here."

>examine crowd
 You scan the crowd for suspicious characters.

 "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our tour of the Court of Honor.
 I hope you found it an hour well spent.  There is far more to see --
 the interiors of the buildings we looked upon, for starters.  Then, to
 the south, past Agriculture, another group of buildings where you can
 find Ethnographic exhibits, the largest cannon ever made, from the
 Krupp family business of Germany, and a replica of the convent where
 Columbus first contemplated taking his historic voyage.  To the north,
 wonder upon wonder awaits, with grand exposition buildings dedicated
 to Transportation, Horticulture, Fine Arts, and more.  Far to the
 north you should find and visit the building erected by your home
 state.  And to the northwest, be sure to walk the Midway Plaisance,
 which has not inaptly been called a great kindergarten for grown-up
 people, and where many side-shows of the Exposition may be seen, some
 of them more than common excellence, and all of them of refreshing
 interest as well as instructive to the curious who take delight in
 strange people and their odd manners and customs."

>time
 The time is now 12:28 p.m. on Monday.

>go northwest
 You can enter the Administration Building to the west, or head north
 or south toward more monumental buildings.

 "Be sure to tell your friends -- the tour takes place every day right
 at eleven-thirty sharp.  For a short time our lives have been bound
 together by one great interest, by one grand experience; now we fall
 apart again; each becomes an atom in the great world of life.  When
 shall we meet again?  Truly, as the Hindoo proverb says, 'Like
 driftwood on a river, we meet, we greet, we sever.'  I bid you,
 Adieu."  The tour group applauds, and a few cluster around the guide
 to ask more questions, but he deftly slips away and is gone in an
 instant.

 believe that this may be the truth.  The Midway is a hive of activity.
 Among great crowds of fairgoers are merchants, hawkers, musicians,
 barkers, and palanquin bearers; some shouting, some singing, some
 lounging in indifference.  The midway continues to the west, toward

  The robbery was bold, to say the least.  Eight diamonds, stolen from
 secure displays in the Kimberly Diamond Mining Company exhibit.  Four
 of the diamonds were rough and uncut, three beautifully finished.  The
 last diamond was the prize of the collection:  one of the largest
 diamonds in the world, presented to Queen Victoria by the company and
 on loan from her for this special exhibit.  All of them taken at once,
 quietly, under the noses of four well-trained guards.








 You knew there was going to be trouble.  The World's Fair was a place
 for fortunes to be made--legally or illegally, it mattered not to
 some.  Outside the fairgrounds, jobs were becoming harder to come by,
 and it was becoming increasingly evident to what lengths some men
 would go to earn what they considered rightfully theirs.  And so
 Chicago's grand Exposition has become not only a place of
 entertainment and education, but of profit, for those who are clever
 enough to take advantage.  Dreamers and schemers, fools and sharks,
 simple farmers and cynical cityfolk mingle together on the grounds.
 The Columbian Guards keep the peace and provide order as best they
 can, with your old friend, the most competent Carl Masters, in charge.
 But although he is well equipped to handle the minor crimes, he never
 had the best head for the more complex and devious.  And so he called
 you.








 Already, you have suspects; descriptions neatly typed up and pushed
 into your case dossier.  Greenback Bob was rumored to be working the
 Fair.  So was his sometime partner, Delbras; a dangerously clever
 foreigner who remains largely a mystery.  Perhaps you will learn more
 as soon as you get to your office in the Administration Building.
 Your job:  Find the precious stones, and capture those responsible.
 And while you're at it, you promise yourself to take the time to enjoy
 the sights and sounds of the one and only Columbian Exposition of
 Chicago, one of the most amazing spectacles in the World...








    You step off the train into a huge crowd of fairgoers, who jostle
 one another as they make their way along the platform.  You push your
 way through the throng, and finally make it out onto the fairgrounds,
 where you are momentarily stunned by the sheer size, the monumental
 beauty of the new city standing before you...



 Court of Honor, In Front of Terminal Station
    You are in a large courtyard, surrounded by buildings the style and
 grandeur of which you have never seen before.  This is the Court of

 monumental buildings.

 The ourang-outang tries to carefully peel one of the umbrellas in its

 A well dressed young salesman says something jokingly to his

 with his umbrella.  The ourang-outang immediately snatches the
 umbrella from him and beats him about the face and neck with it.  The
 young man, more subdued now, slinks away, to the general amusement of
 the Javanese guards.

 The ourang-outang is a fantastic looking creature transported here
 from the Dutch East Indes.  He is a short, thick-legged ape with
 great, long, grasping arms, covered in bright orange fur.  He doesn't
 look particularly happy to be here, at the fair, seeming to be in a
 mostly irritable disposition.  However, as this is in actuality the

 Although the mural is high above your head and somewhat difficult to
 see, it nevertheless is an interesting composition by the American
 painter Mary Cassat. A very thick, elaborate border of blue, green,
 and orange surrounds the three panels of the mural.  In the first
 panel are three women, in pursuit of a flying figure.  In the second,
 women dressed in modern fashion and children are gathered in an
 orchard, where they pick and eat bright red and gold fruit.  In the
 last panel one woman dances in a flowing skirt, watched by two others.
 The bright blues, greens, and purples of this composition make it
 stand out quite dramatically from the other artwork in the building.

 the room, as if the waters of Lake Michigan had somehow flowed into
 the library and left its very nature.  Thousands of books line the
 walls in dozens of bookcases.  In the middle of the room is a display
 case featuring the works of Harriet Beecher Stowe, a bust of whom sits
 atop the case.  Tables and chairs are scattered throughout the library

 thinks better of it.

 "You are so kind," she says, "that I wonder if I could impose upon
 your good nature and ask you to complete a task which, because I must
 remain here, I cannot."

 You pause, considering your reply, which she somehow takes as an
 affirmative response.  She smiles warmly and says, "Oh, Thank you ever
 so much for your kindness.  That claim check that you have found.
 Could you go and turn it in for me at the Children's Building?  They

    The Children's Building foyer is wide and spacious, but also more
 spartan than the interiors of many of the other Fair buildings.  The
 main attraction in the building stands directly west, a large
 playground for older kids:  complete with trapezes, parallel bars,
 vaulting horses, rings, wands, and more.  You can see kids playing in
 the exhibit, and many more lined up around the outside.  To the south
 a door leads to the Day Nursery, while to the north the exhibits of
 the Children's Building stack one upon the other:  a model
 kindergarten, a young homemakers exhibit, and more.
    A kindly matron is here, assisting parents and keeping a watchful

 walls in dozens of bookcases.  In the middle of the room is a display
 case featuring the works of Harriet Beecher Stowe, a bust of whom sits
 atop the case.  Tables and chairs are scattered throughout the library
 so patrons can stop to read some of the materials.  The grand

 the rattle.  "Oh!"  she exclaims suddenly, dropping the rattle.  "What
 have you done?  This isn't my baby!"  She slumps back into her chair,
 sobbing.

 Just then a gentleman enters the library.  "Edith, what's wrong?"  he
 goes to the librarian, who tells him her troubles.  He pats her gently
 on the shoulders, then turns to you.  "Look, I don't know who you are,
 but I think you've caused poor Mrs.  Clark quite enough trouble
 already.  I expect you to make things right.  Take that baby back, and
 get the right one.  Can't you do anything?  And if you don't get her
 baby back within the hour, I'll call the police!"  He storms out,
 leaving you with the very upset and distraught librarian.

 smoke billowing out of its nostrils.

>examine dragon
 I don't know the word "dragon".

>hit gong
 (with the pickaxe)
 The gong makes a deep, resonate sound.  Immediately a man appears and

 you.  My visitor struck the gong."  The man leaves.

 the floor.  The walls are made of wood and paper.  A large gong,
 hanging on a laquer stand, stands prominently against the east wall.
 The west side of the room is open to the outside, while sliding paper
 doors are on both the north and south sides of the room.

 The Japanese woman stops you.  "The master does not wish to be
 disturbed.  He is very ill."

>ask woman about master
 "He is master of Cha-no-yu:  Japanese Tea Ceremony.  But right now, he
 is very ill."

>ask woman about illness
 "Master has been sick for many days.  He will not take your Western
 medicines.  He is waiting for a Japanese doctor to bring a herbal
 remedy, but I fear it will be too late."

>ask woman about remedy
 "Master believes that he can only be cured by Japanese herbal remedy.
 The remedy consists of ginseng, lotus root, and bear's paw.  If the
 doctor would come back in time, I am sure he would recover," she
 lowers her head, and looks at the floor.  "But I am afraid the doctor
 will not return in time."

>ask woman about ginseng
 "A very powerful medicine.  I believe the doctor had heard the Corean
 exhibit in the Manufactures building contained some, I hope he was
 able to obtain a specimen for us."

>ask woman about lotus root
 "It is said that the Buddha sits on the leaf of the great lotus.  A
 very powerful plant.  Very common in Japan, but not here.  I am afraid
 the doctor will never find it."

>ask woman about bear's paw
 "It is said that the thick pad of the bear's paw gives strength to one
 who is ill.  The bear's paw comes commonly from China, but I do not
 know if this land has any bears."

>ask woman about prince
 "It is a great honor to have him come here and stay with us.  We are
 overjoyed."

 Temple Grounds
    The trees thin out and open up around a beautiful Japanese temple
 and teahouse.  The temple, to the east, is based on a famous temple in
 Japan called the Ho-o-den, or Phoenix Temple, so named because the two
 wings of the temple resemble birds wings.  The teahouse is a separate,
 simple structure to the north.  In front of the teahouse is a simple
 sign.  Paths wind into the woods to the southeast and southwest, and a
 bridge extends northeast over the lagoon towards the Fisheries
 Building.

 In Front of the Illinois Building
    The largest of the State Buildings is of course the Illinois
 Building, in honor of the state which is holding the Fair.  The
 building occupies a commanding site at the head of the Lagoon, from
 which you have an uninterrupted view through the waterways to the
 southern portion of the Fair.  A broad road cuts across its well
 manicured lawn, heading east across a small bridge, and west toward
 the Midway, where you can see the great Ferris Wheel spinning slowly
 in the distance.  The Lagoon is directly south, and surrounding it you
 can clearly see The Women's Building, Horticulture, and Transportation
 on the right, Fisheries, The U.S.  Government Building, and
 Manufactures and Liberal Arts on the left.  Far to the south, you can
 just make out the dome of the Administration Building.

 On the walk leading to the Illinois Building is a sculpture entitled,
 "Hide and Seek."

 wheel slowly spinning.  Another road leads east, towards the
 golden-dome of the Illinois building.  To the north, you can see what
 looks like a Spanish mission, and numerous smaller buildings after
 that.  Southward lies the Women's Building, then Horticulture, and so
 on, all the way back to the Administration Building.
