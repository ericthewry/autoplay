 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 The sand stretches around you in all directions.

 There is a grassy countryside. Rocks are scattered about.

 You are in a room. The room has walls and a ceiling.

 You blink. It seems as though you've been standing here forever. You
 feel suddenly stressed; There is something you have to do.

 Kitchen
 The stench of offal hangs in the air.The walls drip with fresh blood.
 An ugly table supports plates and a massive assortment of cutlery. This
 is not an environment that encourages rational thought. Empty
 doorframes lead north, east, south and west.

 You neither look, or feel, as if you are "all here".

>inventory
 You are carrying nothing.

>think
 For a moment, you picture an underground room.

>examine blood
 Bright red. You can't tell where it's coming from. It seems to emerge
 from the wall itself.

>examine table
 It is made of an unidentifiable wood, and heavily stained with blood.
 The surface is deeply wounded with ugly scars. On the ugly table there
 is some cutlery and some plates.

>drink blood
 It tastes metally. And foul.

>examine cutlery
 As well as variations on knives, forks and spoons, there are many more
 esoteric tools, most of which you don't recognise.

 Fractal patterns spin across your vision briefly, and you feel hollow.

>plover
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 That's not a verb I recognise.

 You lack an appropriate tool, and you aren't very good at accurate
 tearing.

>cry
 That's not a verb I recognise.

 remember all its lyrics perfectly.

 When you strain your ears, you can hear a faint breathing.

 A ghostly figure floats up through the floor, and coalesces into Mr
 Green.

 Mr Green hands you a note.

 A small piece of notepaper, torn at the top. It reads, "You're
 dreaming, fool."

 He wears a green mask, a green suit, and a green hat.

 Mr Green adjusts his mask.

>pinch me
 The pain feels strangely distant, and your surroundings distort for a
 second.

>take mask
 I don't suppose Mr Green would care for that.

>pinch mr green
 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>wake up
 You drift away...


 Bedroom
 Your bedroom is fairly barren. You have a bed and a window. The floor
 is bare of carpet. You have put up a poster to hide some dents on one
 wall. A door leads north.

 On the bed is a blanket.

 You can see a wallet (empty) and a badge here.

 You feel a presence in the room.

>punch mr green
 You can't see any such thing.

>take wallet
 Taken.

 "Stay calm." suggests the poster.

>take badge
 Taken.

 "The plan is a good plan." says the poster.

>take poster
 So fond are you of this poster, you superglued it to the wall. That's
 probably against residential regulations, but you were feeling
 rebellious at the time.

 "Are you okay?" asks the poster.

>examine poster
 It depicts a rock singer of bygone years.

 "I may be paper, but you can talk to me." says the poster.

>talk to poster
>poster, what is the meaning of life
 Try ASK someone ABOUT something.

 "I'm sorry if I'm hard to understand" apologises the poster.

 You can't talk to the poster.

>ask poster about life
 You open your mouth, then stop. Why are you trying to talk to an
 inanimate object? Because that is what it is. An inanimate  object.
 Completely. Totally. No life here. Nothing out of the ordinary or
 suspicious. Certainly not. Nope.

 "You need to proceed with your mission." says the poster.

 I only understood you as far as wanting to wish.

 You open the bedroom door.

 The poster watches you leave.

 Work Room
 This could also be described as a study, but that doesn't quite fit the
 uses to which you put it. Nevertheless, you have a desk, and a phone.
 Doors lead south, west and east.

 On the workdesk are a crowbar, a hammer and a work folder (closed).

 You can see a workbag (closed) here.

 You are carrying:
   a crowbar

 Real Kitchen
 Your kitchen is relatively clean. A pile of pizza boxes sits on a
 table, adjacent to your microwave. Your television sits on a shelf. A
 door leads west.

 A face grins on the television.

>examine face
 You can't see any such thing.

>examine television
 You brought it in here so you can watch as you eat. Unfortunately, it
 stopped working recently, and you're not sure why.

 part of me."

 You find nothing.

 "I see you, and I know who you are." states the face.

>ask face about tv

 Empty, tragically.

 The phone number "06634734521" is shown on the boxes.

 "I wouldn't just stand there." says the face.

 No, you might break it.

 Sharp knives float across the face.

>turn tv off
 That's not something you can switch.

 "I know what you're doing, and I will pass judgement." intones the
 face.

 You can't see any such thing.

 The face watches you.

 ""Do you think this is a game?" asks the face.

 It doesn't work like that.

 You open the apartment door.

 Hallway
 This dim passage runs north and south past a row of rooms. You've never
 been in any of them other than your own. Your apartment is to the east.

 Some sort of lizard bauble hangs from a light bulb.

 The lizard hisses in a friendly manner.

>examine lizard
 A small bauble in the shape of a lizard, hanging from a dim light-bulb.

 "You don't know who's moving the pieces. But consider: They must be
 powerful. They must be worth befriending." The lizard makes a clicking
 noise.

 That's hardly portable.

 "You don't have to live in squalor you know." suggests the lizard.

 Garden
 You stand upon a small stone patio, surrounded by plants. Ripe fruit
 dip from vines, tempting you with their colours. An ornamental fountain
 gurgles to your left. Daylight peeks through the heavy layer of
 greenery above. A dense perfume almost overwhelms you. You can go
 deeper, to the north. The kitchen is to the south. Stone walls bar all
 other directions.

 A man glares at you from a pedestal against the north wall. His body is
 wood, his face is formed from paint. You feel guilty. A flaming bowl
 sits in front of the pedestal. A doorframe leads east.

 Mr Blue arrives from the east.

>examine idol
 You find it difficult to meet his gaze. He is dressed in priestly
 robes, adorned with strange patterns. For a moment, you think you see a
 hat of some kind..

>get hat
 I don't suppose Mr Blue would care for that.

>take idol's hat
 You can't see any such thing.

 There is no visible fuel within the bowl, and the flames are too strong
 for you to risk looking closer. The bowl itself is made of silvery
 metal.

 You are surrounded by crates, beyond which are walls. There doesn't
 appear to be any way out. A hammock hangs between two hooks hammered
 into crate struts.

 You can see a chest (closed) and a gadget blueprint here.

 It's made of some sort of metal. There is a square depression set into
 the top.

 Most of the crates are made of sealed metal. They don't look as if they

 being made of battered wood.

 A man glares at you from a pedestal against the north wall. His body is

 Study
 A fine wooden desk stands in front of you. A chair, placed before it,
 seems to beckon. The surroundings are decorated, carpet and wallpaper
 hiding the plain floor and walls. One of the walls has a framed picture
 attached to it. A fine wooden door stands to the east, a dark wooden
 door to the north, a pale wooden door to the south, and an empty frame
 to the west.

 On the wooden desk is a notepad.

 a corridor to the south.

 A set of mailboxes wait on one wall. The floor hasn't been cleaned for

>examine mailbox
 The keys are long lost, and the boxes hang open. There are still a few
 bits and pieces inside them.

 Most of the stuff in the boxes is useless, but you do manage to find a
 leaflet for a taxi firm that might be handy.

 You open the entrance doors.

 Street
 The street is deserted. Your apartment building is to the north. A tree
 casts a shadow over you. A cardboard cutout leans against a wall, an
 abandoned piece of marketing.

 You notice some graffiti adorning a wall, sprayed in red.

 Abruptly, a car comes tearing down the street towards you. You are
 frozen with terror, but without a conscious effort, you move sideways
 and the car speeds out of sight without touching you. What's wrong with
 the world today?

 The cutout eyes you.

>examine cutout
 A happy cowboy, inanimate.

 "Are you afraid?" asks the cutout.

>examine graffiti
 HELP.

 "Is this what you call productivity?" asks the cutout.

 "You look helpless." jeers the cutout.

>examine tree
 You don't know enough about trees to identify it as being anything but
 dark, and daunting. A nest is perched high on one branch.

 The cutout laughs.

>climb tree
 Unfortunately, there aren't any branches within reach that will support
 your weight.

 Froth drips from the cutout's mouth.

>examine nest
 Filthy, but functional. There is a feather stuck in it. In the high
 nest there is nothing.

 "Why do you just stand there?" asks the cutout.

>help
 Much of this may be familar to you already, but some won't, so here
 goes...

 To move around, use the commands GO NORTH, GO EAST, GO WEST, GO SOUTH,
 GO UP and GO DOWN, or simply N, E, W, S, U and D.
 To view your inventory use the command INVENTORY, or simply I.
 To perform an action, use a verb, such as JUMP.
 To perform an action with an object, use a verb, the object and the
 appropriate prepositions.
 Examples:  TAKE FISH.  OPEN BOX.  TURN ON TV.  SCREAM AT SHADOWS.  WAVE
 AT PRINCE OF WALES.  VANDALISE ARTWORK.  READ NECRONOMICON.
 Note that you can abbreviate the object names slightly, but the
 adjectives are used to make distinctions between objects with similar
 names.
 To perform an action involving direct and indirect objects, both
 objects are required in the appropriate order with a preposition
 linking them.
 Examples:  GIVE BOX TO MAN.  THROW STONE AT PLATE.  EAT SPAGHETTI WITH
 FORK.  CUT RUG WITH SWORD.  BEHEAD TRAITOR WITH RAZOR-SHARP POSTCARD.
 BURN TAPESTRY WITH BLOWTORCH.
 Another useful command is UNDO, which will move the game back one turn,
 like a pre-release time warp device.
 The OOPS command has a similar effect, replacing an incorrect word in a
 previous command with the word following it.
 Examples:  PICK UP KINFE.  OOPS KNIFE.  FIRE BAZOKA.  OOPS BAZOOKA.
 QUIT allows to to leave the game, SAVE and RESTORE can be used to save
 and restore games, and RESTART will allow you to start over.

 This game includes a "PUT ALL IN (CONTAINER)" command, which you may
 find useful.

 You will have to deal some eccentric situations in this game. Eccentric
 thoughts may be required.

 Study
 A fine wooden desk stands in front of you. A chair, placed before it,
 seems to beckon. The surroundings are decorated, carpet and wallpaper
 hiding the plain floor and walls. One of the walls has a framed picture
 attached to it. A fine wooden door stands to the east, a dark wooden
 door to the north, a pale wooden door to the south, and an empty frame
 to the west.

 On the wooden desk is a notepad.

 You can see a suitcase (closed) here.

 wall. A door leads north.

 You feel a presence in the room.

 You raise the phone, but something is wrong. A strange feeling is
 coming over you. You abruptly slam the phone down, and you recover.

 A strange echoing noise sounds in your ears. After a moment you hear
 something else;  A shuffling far away.

 Hallway
 This dim passage runs north and south past a row of rooms. You've never

 Some sort of lizard bauble hangs from a light bulb.

 The lizard hisses in a friendly manner.

 You can go upwards, or downwards. Upwards fills you with dread,
 downwards with anticipation. You are unsure why. Your apartment is down
 a corridor to the south.

 Entrance Room
 A set of mailboxes wait on one wall. The floor hasn't been cleaned for
 some time. A couple of entrance doors lead south. Stairs lead upwards.

>go south

 Street
 The street is deserted. Your apartment building is to the north. A tree
 casts a shadow over you. A cardboard cutout leans against a wall, an
 abandoned piece of marketing.

 You notice some graffiti adorning a wall, sprayed in red.

 The cutout eyes you.

 The cutout sneers at you.

 You can hear voices from somewhere.

 "Perhaps you should be considering self-improvement?" asks the lizard.

>ask lizard about lizard
 You open your mouth, then stop. Why are you trying to talk to an
 inanimate object? Because that is what it is. An inanimate  object.
 Completely. Totally. No life here. Nothing out of the ordinary or
 suspicious. Certainly not. Nope.

 The lizard's tongue flickers.

>take lizard
 That's hardly portable.

 "You don't know who's moving the pieces. But consider: They must be
 powerful. They must be worth befriending." The lizard makes a clicking
 noise.

 remember all its lyrics perfectly.

 "Are you okay?" asks the poster.

 "The plan is a good plan." says the poster.

 Whatever work is being done here, it looks important. Complex
