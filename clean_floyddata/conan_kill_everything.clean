 In April, three months after you bought the house, the snow finally
 melts and for the first time you see how your new garden really looks
 like. It's not that bad, actually; you probably don't need to do much
 to make it look really nice. Armed with a to-do list and an upbeat
 attitude you go to work.

 The garden is such a nice little patch of green for a novice gardener
 like yourself. There's even a small fish pond. Flowers are already in
 full bloom in the flower bed and there's an empty patch ready for
 vegetables. The grass looks a bit dry.

 There's also an old garden shed with a yard hydrant installed next to
 it.

>examine attitude


 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory


 You're carrying a to-do list, a gold fish in a plastic bag, and some
 tomato seeds.

>examine list


 It's a list of things that are easy to do to get you started:

  - Remove weeds from the flower bed
  - Plant the tomatoes
  - Put the fish in the pond
  - Water the lawn

>examine hydrant


 It's basically a pipe with a valve on it. The mouth part has a
 connection where a hose can be attached.

>examine me


 As good-looking as ever.

>examine shed


 It's a delightfully retro little garden shed.

>enter shed


 You go inside the garden shed.

 It's a delightful little shed even though it has seen better days.
 Wear and tear just adds to the charm. The walls have been plastered
 with newspapers and there are several boxes full of miscellaneous
 junk.

 An orange garden hose is hanging from a holder in the wall.

>examine fish


 The fish is quite large for a goldfish. The saleswoman at the pet
 store said it would do well in an outdoor pond. It's swimming around
 in its temporary plastic home.

>examine junk


 The boxes are full of various junk, some related to gardening and some
 not. None of them are originally yours, the previous owner left them
 here for you to take care of.

>examine pond


 You can't see any such thing.

>search junk


 It's just junk you don't need, at least not at this very moment.

>examine newspapers


 On closer inspection it's not newspaper after all but pages torn from
 books. From <span class="floydstyle em">Jack Mills</span> pocket books, to be precise.

>examine hose


 It's quite long and... orange.

>take hose


 Taken.

>read newspapers


 You can't see any such thing.

>tie knot into hose


 You can't see any such thing.

>read pages


 <span class="floydstyle em">"The slammer was a depressing mixture of displeasing white and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">uncaring gray. I walked past the empty cells listening to the steady</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">click-clack of my steps echoing from the walls. In the last cell I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">found Professor Humphrey..."</span>

 No wonder someone wanted to plaster it on the walls.

>examine seeds


 The tomato seeds are in a small bag. They are supposedly super easy -
 just throw them in the soil and let them grow.

>take junk


 It's just junk you don't need, at least not at this very moment.

>read list


 It's a list of things that are easy to do to get you started:

>exit shed


 I only understood you as far as wanting to exit.

>exit


 You return to the garden.

 The garden is such a nice little patch of green for a novice gardener
 like yourself. There's even a small fish pond. Flowers are already in
 full bloom in the flower bed and there's an empty patch ready for
 vegetables. The grass looks a bit dry.

 There's also an old garden shed with a yard hydrant installed next to
 it.

>examine pond


 The pond is small but very beautiful..

>examine patch


 The vegetable patch is just waiting for seeds.

>put hose on hydrant


 Putting things on the yard hydrant would achieve nothing.

>attach hose to hydrant


 With some effort you screw the other end of the hose to the hydrant.

>examine flowers


 The flowers are petunias and poppies, you guess. At the moment there
 seem to be much more weeds than flowers in the flower bed.

>take weeds


 You get on your knees and pull each weed carefully out around the
 flowers. It takes a good thirty minutes, but the result looks really
 nice. Never mind the aching fingers.

>examine weeds


 You can't see any such thing.

>score


 [There is no numerical score.]

>read list


 It's a list of things that are easy to do to get you started:

  - Remove weeds from the flower bed (done!)
  - Plant the tomatoes
  - Put the fish in the pond
  - Water the lawn

>plant seeds


 You throw the tomato seeds evenly on the vegetable patch and spread
 some soil over them. That <span class="floydstyle em">was</span> easy.

>eat fish


 It's a decorative kind of fish, not the eating kind.

>put fish in the pond


 The fish leaps from the plastic bag into the pond and starts to swim
 around in circles. In the spur of the moment you decide to name it
 "Wensleydale".

>water lawn


 You carefully hose the entire lawn and turn the water off when you're
 done. In your eyes the grass is already looking much greener!

 Well, that was the last chore and everything is now done! Looks like
 you are better at this than you even imagined!

 No, wait, what's that mound right in the middle of the garden? Ugh,
 it's a molehill. Better hose the bugger out while you're at it before
 the entire garden gets full of those.

>examine molehill


 It's a small pile of dirt.

>examine mountain


 You can't see any such thing.

>inventory


 You're carrying a to-do list.

>examine list


 It's a list of things that are easy to do to get you started:

  - Remove weeds from the flower bed (done!)
  - Plant the tomatoes (done!)
  - Put the fish in the pond (done!)
  - Water the lawn (done!)

>hose molehill


 It wouldn't help just to wash the mound away. You need to flood the
 tunnels.

>enter shed


 You go inside the garden shed again.

 It's a delightful little shed even though it has seen better days.
 Wear and tear just adds to the charm. The walls have been plastered
 with pages from books and there are several boxes full of
 miscellaneous junk.

>search junk


 It's just junk you don't need, at least not at this very moment.

>take pages


 No time to redecorate now.

>inventory


 You're carrying a to-do list.

>out


 You return to the garden.

 The garden is a tiny patch of green where Wensleydale is splashing
 around in the pond and the flowers are in full bloom in the flower
 bed. The tomato seeds have been planted in the vegetable patch.

 The old garden shed has a yard hydrant installed next to it. The
 garden hose is attached to the hydrant.

>put hose in molehill


 You tuck the end of the hose inside the mole hill.

>turn on water


 (the yard hydrant)
 You approach the hydrant and see a little cuddly bunny by the shed.
 "Oh, how delightful!" you exclaim. The bunny scurries away.

 You turn the valve and a spray of water from the hose soaks you
 through. You cut the water quickly. The bunny must've had a taste of
 the hose.

 Bother.

>examine hose


 It's quite long and... orange.

>turn on water


 (the yard hydrant)
 Not before you've found a way to mend the hose!

>examine hose


 It's quite long and... orange.

>examine hose


 It's quite long and... orange.

>take hose


 It should stay until the mole is thoroughly hosed out.

>enter shed


 You go inside the garden shed again.

 The shed is in poor shape, but it's your own little shed. The walls
 have been plastered with pages from books and there are several boxes
 full of miscellaneous junk.

 Now let's see... There, right on top of a box, is a roll of silvery
 duct tape.

>examine duct tape


 It's silvery and it can repair anything.

>take duct tape


 Taken.

>out


 You return to the garden.

 The garden is a tiny patch of green where Wensleydale is splashing
 around in the pond and the flowers are in full bloom in the flower
 bed. The tomato seeds have been planted in the vegetable patch.

 The old garden shed has a yard hydrant installed next to it. The
 garden hose is attached to the hydrant and the other end is tucked
 inside the molehill.

 A lonely crow lands on the vegetable patch. It pecks around the soil
 for a bit, then two others arrive. They start digging and eating the
 tomato seeds.

 "Hey! Get out of there, you little pests!" you scream but the birds
 ignore you.

 Bother.

>examine crows


 The crows are black and extremely annoying.

>caw


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>inventory


 You're carrying a roll of duct tape and a to-do list.

>mend hose


 You roll a few layers of tape arond the leaking spot. It looks like it
 could hold now.

>scare crows


 You approach the vegetable patch and the crows fly off. They return
 right after you've moved two paces away.

>turn on hose


 You turn the valve and water starts to flow underground. You decide to
 leave it on for a while, just to be sure.

>spray crows


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take off clothes


 You can't see any such thing.

>enter shed


 You go inside the garden shed again.

 The shed is in poor shape, but it's your own little shed. The walls
 have been plastered with pages from books and there are several boxes
 full of miscellaneous junk.

 Let's see... Yes, there should be something useful here for this
 situation.

 You can see a coverall and a rake here.

>take coverall


 Taken.

>take rake


 Taken.

>examine coverall


 It's a smallish dark green coverall. It has seen a lot of use.

>take pages


 No time to redecorate now.

>examine rake


 It's a rusty rake that's missing few teeth.

>put coverall on rake


 You put the rake inside the coverall to support it and you have
 yourself a makeshift scarecrow. Hopefully it works.

>out


 You return to the garden.

 around in the pond and the flowers are in full bloom in the flower
 bed. The tomato seeds have been planted in the vegetable patch.

 garden hose is attached to the hydrant and the other end is tucked
 inside the molehill.

 Some crows are eating away the tomato seeds you just planted.

>put scarecrow in garden


 Which do you mean, the garden hose, or the lawn?

>put scarecrow in vegetable patch


 You stick the scarecrow in the middle of the vegetable patch. The
 crows fly away and - they aren't returning! Hooray!

>examine fish


 Wensleydale makes cheerful little circles in its new home.

>pet fish


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>take fish


 I don't suppose Wensleydale would care for that.

>fish, hello


 You must supply a noun.

>talk to fish


 Wensleydale doesn't respond.

>examine grass


 The grass is looking good.

>examine seeds


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine molehill


 It's a small pile of dirt. The other end of the hose is tucked inside.

 You hear Wensleydale splash about in the pond.

>pour herbicide on weeds


 You pop the cap from the weedkiller which greets you with a gust of
 poisonous fumes. "Ha! Ha! HA! HAHA! HA!" you scream as you pour the
 stuff on those demonic parasites. Let's see them come back to life
 now!

 The weeds die spectacularly, whithering as soon as the herbicide hits
 them. War is not without casualities, as you soon find out - the
 flowers can't take the heat and they turn into shriveled mounds of
 organic mass.

 You look at the flower bed and muse your Pyrrhic victory.

>examine fish


 Hngaah! It's not Wensleydale that's splashing but the neighbour's cat
 who's trying to catch him! Shoo, cat, shoo!

 F%#&!

>take cat


 "Here, pus pus pus..."

 You approach the cat, trying to grab it to carry it away from the
 pond. She sees you approaching, hisses, and makes a daring leap
 towards you.

 She lands straight on your face and takes hold with all four legs. The
 beast drives its claws in the neck and the back of your head. "Mmmph
 hmmh mph!" you swear.

>remove cat


 "Meow," the cat says as you struggle to get free.

>examine cat


 It's the neighbour's cat. You used to like it, before it started to
 prey on your fish.

 You take a good grip of the little bastard and yank her out of your
 face. Her final loot is a bunch of hair and a good amount of freshly
 scraped skin. The cat jumps on the ground and runs off.

 You glance at the vegetable patch where the crows are back, with a
 couple of friends of theirs. It looks as if some of them are actually
 laughing at the scarecrow. Laughing. At the scarecrow. Laughing.

 You don't say anything. Your left eye twitches.

 The crows are back and extremely annoying.

>examine flowers


 The flowers were petunias and poppies, you guess.

>enter shed


 You go inside the garden shed again.

 The dark and rotting shed is just about as awful as you can imagine.
 The walls have been plastered with newspapers and there are several
 boxes full of miscellaneous junk.

 There has to be something here yet that will save the day! Has to be
 something!

>search junk


 You rummage through the boxes, trying to find some magic tool that
 will make all go better. There is nothing there.

>examine pages


 You can't see any such thing.

>examine newspapers


 On closer inspection it's not newspaper after all but pages torn from
 books. From <span class="floydstyle em">Jack Mills</span> pocket books, to be precise.

>search junk


 There is nothing there.

>read papers


 <span class="floydstyle em">"The slammer was a depressing mixture of displeasing white and</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">uncaring gray. I walked past the empty cells listening to the steady</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">click-clack of my steps echoing from the walls. In the last cell I</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">found Professor Humphrey..."</span>

 No wonder someone wanted to plaster it on the walls.

>inventory


 You're carrying a to-do list.

>examine list


 It's a list of things that are easy to do to get you started:

  - Remove weeds from the flower bed (done!)
  - Plant the tomatoes (done!)
  - Put the fish in the pond (done!)
  - Water the lawn (done!)

 You should also  - get rid of the crows

>fold list


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>make origami knife


 That's not a verb I recognize.

>inventory


 You're carrying a to-do list.

>take junk


 It's just junk you don't need, at least not at this very moment.

>take papers


 No time to redecorate now.

>out


 You sigh and return to the garden.

 It's the garden of pain. The fish is hopefully still alive, the
 flowers most certainly are not. It's doubtful if there are any seeds
 left in the vegetable patch.

 The old garden shed has a yard hydrant installed next to it. The
 garden hose is attached to the hydrant and it runs inside the
 molehill.

 Some crows are eating away the tomato seeds you just planted.

 The ground erupts into four or five geysirs, spraying water from the
 underground mole tunnels.

 The bunny returns and chews on the remaining flora.

 The cat is back prowling about for Wensleydale by the pond.

      ***

 You close your eyes.

>close eyes


 They are already closed.

>open eyes


 You open your eyes and behold! A paradise unfolds in front of your
 eyes! The flowers are blooming, the grass is a gleaming green carpet
 where butterflies chase each other and stop only to rest in sparkling
 waters of a beautiful yard pond. It is the perfect embodiment of a
 spring garden.

 "You have a very beautiful garden, Mrs. Salines," you tell your next
 door neighbour who is watering her petunias on the other side of the
 fence. "WHY DOES MINE LOOK LIKE THE AFTERMATH OF A CARPET BOMBING?"
 You can feel your blood pressure throbbing a vein in your forehead.

 Mrs. Salines laughs jovially. "My dear, you just need a bit of
 patience! You can't expect perfect results right away," she tells you.
 "Come, I'll make us some tea and then we'll go have a look at your
 garden."

 You feel a bit better.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Conan Kill Everything</span>
 An interactive massacre, by Ian Haberkorn
 Release 2 / Serial number 050428 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11 S

 Type ABOUT for more information, FORUM for r.g.i.f. comments on the
 game, and MEAN to turn off unwinnable protection.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Weazle, the evil wizard has destroyed all that Conan loved. Now,</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">after years of searching, Conan has finally found him. </span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">Conan is ready for revenge - he will KILL EVERYTHING!</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dungeon</span>
 Conan is in a damp dungeon, furnished only with an oaken table. The
 walls consist of yellowish clay. High up on the wall is a single,
 burning torch. A door, leading north, is closed.

 Weazle, the evil wizard spins around as Conan enters the room.

 "Ha!", he cries, "here comes stupid Conan whose parents I killed,
 whose sister I sold to the orks and whose dumbbells I stole! You want
 revenge! But you will perish!"

 He taps his pointed hat, and a growling wildcat appears out of thin
 air!

>kill wildcat


 Alertly, Conan draws his sword and, with one quick blow, strikes the
 wildcat dead. It vanishes in a puff of brown smoke.

 "Oh", snickers the wizard, "it seems that you have grown stronger
 since I burnt your home village! Well, try this!"

 He taps his pointed hat again, and a mighty golem made of wood appears
 out of thin air!

 [Conan's score has just gone up by one point.]

>kill golem


 Conan raises his sword again and fells the golem with a single blow.
 It shatters into a million leaves that dissolve in a puff of green
 smoke. A red apple falls to the floor.

 The wizard is impressed.
 "You are good!", he cries, "Better than when I bewitched your hairdo!
 But my best creation is yet to come! A giant tarantula!"

 He taps his hat again, and out of thin air, a little spider appears!
 The wizard looks a bit puzzled.

 [Conan's score has just gone up by one point.]

>examine spider


 It is a little spider with a furry body.

 The little spider moves around hesitantly!

 Weazle takes off his hat and examines it, muttering about something
 like 'energy plane dysfunction'.

>kill wizard


 Finally Conan can attack Weazle. With a mighty blow he slices the
 wizard in half. He vanishes in a puff of golden, glittering smoke.
 Only his pointed hat falls to the floor.

 Suddenly the little spider freezes in its movements, as if
 concentrating.

 [Conan's score has just gone up by one point.]

>take hat


 Taken.

 With a mighty leap, the spider lands on Conan's back. Quickly it bites
 into his neck, injecting its venom. Conan falls to the floor.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">He looks at you.</span>

 button.

>about



 <span class="floydstyle subheader">About Conan Kill Everything:</span>
 This game began as just a title entry into the "Stupid Title
 Competition". This mock comp was done by Greg Boettcher to test his
 Spring Thing 2005 web voting system. (www.springthing.net/stc.htm)

 It ranked a fabulous second dumbest. When Ãyvind Thorsby posted "I
 want to play Conan Kill Everything!" on the rec.games.int.fiction
 newsgroup, I somehow felt compelled to produce this, maybe because -
 if it's too stupid - I can always pretend that it's dumb on purpose...

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Thanks to:</span>
 Ãyvind for his request and testing,
 Thomas Wollersheim, Poster (Mike) and Eric Eve for more testing and
 suggestions,
 Alessandro Schillaci for JIF, a great Java Inform
 Editor-Compiler-Z-machine-Shell (www.slade.altervista.org/JIF/),
 Roger Firth and Stefano Gaburri for scenic.h,
 and, of course,
 Graham Nelson, for creating Inform in the first place.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">About the author:</span>
 Old enough to have played the original Scott Adams games on a
 Commodore VIC 20, I was delighted to find the genre surviving and even
 flourishing noncommercially today. This is my first attempt at writing
 IF. By the way, I never watched a Conan movie. It probably shows.

 even worthier of its stupid title, please email to:
