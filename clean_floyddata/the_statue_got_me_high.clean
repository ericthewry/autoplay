 Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.








 You are a lowly human slave, suffering beneath the squamous toes of
 your new lizard overlords. Patrisnake Kssshsss has charged you with
 getting rid of all trace of mammals in the back rooms of the Don
 Quixote Memorial Museum.

 Mammal
 An Interactive Song Tribute by Joey Jones
 Release 1 / Serial number 120324 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 Atrium
 You stand in a vast glass-ceilinged atrium. The main doors stand behind
 you to the south, in front is the rest of the museum. The part that you
 actually need to clear is through the little door to the back rooms,
 behind the information desk to the east. The portrait gallery opens off
 to the west.

 In the centre of the atrium is a huge skip, (or garbage dumpster, if
 you're so inclined), into which you are to place all objects tainted
 with mammalian DNA, or direct organic bi-products of mammals. Your
 co-slaves have already gone through most of museum, including
 thankfully, the toilets. When the job is done, you need only blow the
 whistle you've been given, and Kssshsss will come and assess your
 execution of the task.

 John was already on his phone by the time you glanced over your
 shoulder. He had forgotten the whole joke; he wouldn't have noticed if
 you just turned around and walked back. Which you really wanted to do,
 for some reason.

 It felt like a pretty stupid thing to be afraid of.

 You got up the nerve to walk past the last few headstones, but you kept
 your head down. You didn't even want to look at the feet. You just kept
 your eyes on the pedestal, on the exact spot where you finally set down
 the envelope, and then you turned around.

 John was still talking to his phone, oblivious. You could feel it,
 though, like a finger lightly scraping up the back of your neck.

 And then jabbing into your spine so you had to turn back around and
 look up at its face. And you thought (right away you told yourself the
 idea was ridiculous) that it nodded.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Statue Got Me High</span>
 A disaster simulator by Ryan Veeder (with apologies to Johns L & F)
 Release 1 / Serial number 120316 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen, with all its drawers, its cupboards, its sinks and ovens,
 constitutes Chucky's domain, and he guards it jealously. Usually you
 use it only as a conduit between the dining room (south) and the tunnel
 to the cellar (down the stairs).

 Of course, working in here is part of your job, so you and Chucky have
 a deal worked out. The deal is: You do not touch <span class="floydstyle em">anything</span>.

 Right now is an exception, apparently.

 "John wants you to take care of these," he squawks, thrusting a stack
 of cards toward you.

>examine cards

 As you lean in for a closer look, Chucky draws back, repulsed by your
 intrusion of his personal space.

 "Just take 'em, will ya?" he growls. He shoves the stack into your
 hands and then turns to his cooking.

 The papers are place cards, which are to be set out at the dinner table
 so everyone knows where to sit. The forms of the names are
 inconsistent: The men are "John," "Miles," "Ivan," and "Garry," but the
 women are "Miss Idie" and "Miss O."

 But that's not your problem. Your job is figuring out where to put
 these.

>examine chucky

 Chucky's teeth look like a cemetery built on some old marshland, his
 glass eye is not the same color as his real eye, and he smells like a
 butchery, but he is a phenomenal cook. Supposedly he used to be a chef
 in the White House.

 You'd like to find out more about that, but Chucky isn't the kind of
 guy who likes to talk. To you.

>examine me

 You look extremely presentable in your "B" tuxedo: classy, but not too
 flashy; easy to ignore. Tuxedo B is the most appropriate for these
 intimate get-togethers with John's close friends. ("Intimate" is the
 word John uses for mixed groups; the parties to which only women are
 invited he calls "friendly," and they require a different tuxedo.)

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a stack of place cards

>read cards

 The papers are place cards, which are to be set out at the dinner table
 so everyone knows where to sit. The forms of the names are
 inconsistent: The men are "John," "Miles," "Ivan," and "Garry," but the
 women are "Miss Idie" and "Miss O."

 But that's not your problem. Your job is figuring out where to put
 these.

>eat cards

 That's plainly inedible.

>examine table

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine drawers

 If you just stand around looking, Chucky will start getting surly.

>punch chucky

 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>get surly

 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to chucky

 Chucky isn't big on conversation, even with his friends (you assume).

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The sun is going down outside the western window, and the huge table,
 set for six, is aflame in the orange glow. An old portrait hangs on one
 wall, watching the proceedings with creepy indifference.

 The kitchen is back north, the den is east from here, and a narrow door
 leads south to the foyer.

 Somebody jumps as you walk in. It's John's friend Garry, apparently
 startled by your entrance.

>examine portrait

 The frame on the north wall is too big to ignore, and the eyes of the
 portrait seem to follow you around.

 This is supposed to be John's ancestor, an Old World nobleman, also
 named John. John has offered numerous anecdotes about the subject of
 the painting, many of them outlandish and contradictory, and you would
 be inclined to believe that really has no idea who this man is, if the
 family resemblence weren't so unnervingly clear.

>ask garry about john

 You open your mouth to speak to Garry at just the moment that he
 apparently gathers the courage to talk to you.

 "Do you see that painting up there?" he rasps, indicating the portrait
 on the north wall. "Don't you think there's something messed up with
 that guy? He looks really judgmental, right? Like he's judging me. Or
 you."

 You take a moment to formulate a diplomatic answer, but other thoughts
 distract you. Why, Garry, are you standing in here, away from the rest
 of the party, if you hate that painting so much? What is going on in
 your life that makes you worried that a <span class="floydstyle em">painting</span> is judging
 you?

 Garry goes on without you. "I don't like him. I feel like he's looking
 at me. You know what? When we sit down for dinner, try and make sure
 I'm sitting somewhere where I don't have to look at him. One of these
 two seats," he says. He points with a shaking hand at the two chairs on
 the north side of the table.

 You nod.

>examine north seat

 I only understood you as far as wanting to examine north.

>examine table

 At other parties this table has comfortably seated more, but currently
 there are six high-backed chairs and six table settings: Two each on
 the north and south sides, one on the west end, and one at the east.
 This last one, on account of its facing the west wall, has the sunset
 shining straight at it.

>examine garry

 Although lacking your boss's level of animal magnetism, Garry Horrible
 has charm and wit enough to make up for his unfortunate name. Most of
 the time.

 Tonight, he looks like a nervous wreck. There are dark circles under
 his eyes; his breathing is too loud. His is not a demeanour appropriate
 to a dinner party.

>get portrait

>look

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The sun is going down outside the western window, and the huge table,
 set for six, is aflame in the orange glow. An old portrait hangs on one
 wall, watching the proceedings with creepy indifference.

 The kitchen is back north, the den is east from here, and a narrow door
 leads south to the foyer.

 Garry leans forward with both hands on the table, staring into the
 grain of the wood.

>go east


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Den</span>
 This room is well-loved by many of John's friends: from those he's
 brought home for the first time (because it is cozy and dimly lit) to
 frequent visitors (because they know there's booze in the credenza).
 The dining room is west; the parlor is south.

 Captain Miles is here, lining up a shot at the pool table.

 Ivan leans on his cue and regards the table with something like
 suspicion.

 Across the room, fidgiting on a bar stool, is Miss Idie.

>talk to miles

 "Listen, I don't know if you've decided who's sitting where for dinner.
 But I've been getting these real bad migraines lately."

 Ivan looks up from the pool table. "No kidding? I can give you
 something for that." He pulls a pad of paper from inside his jacket.

 Miles turns away from you and back toward Ivan. "Well, I don't know for
 sure if they're migraines. I know that I'm really sensitive to light."

 Ivan is already writing. "Doesn't matter. How about codeine? You seem
 to me like a codeine kind of guy." He looks slantways at Miles for a
 moment, then goes back to scribbling. "Yeah. Here you go. You can get
 this filled wherever."

 He rips off the sheet and pushes it into Miles's hand. "Thanks," Miles
 stutters, before he turns back to you.

 "In the meantime I guess, I'm just saying, I'd rather not sit in that
 chair that's facing the window while the sun's going down."

>talk to ivan

 takes you aside.

 "Hey. So. I figure those cards you're carrying are for deciding the
 seating arrangement? For dinner? Pretty fancy." It is apparent from his
 breath that he has figured out the secret of the credenza.

 "The thing is. There's two things. First thing is, that lady friend of
 John's. I don't want to sit next to her. She creeps me out. Second
 thing is, please don't put me next to..." He's started whispering, and
 now he cranes his head around the room.

 "You know who I'm talking about. She's a downer. I don't wanna sit next
 to her either. I don't know what Miles sees in her." He must mean Miss
 Idie.

 "I mean, I know what he sees in her. Her mother has that publishing
 company. And both she and her mother have mitochondrial
 encephalomyopathy. I mean, look at her. She's like a stick. But with
 the publishing company, and she's gonna die young. So I can see why
 Miles would want to get in on that. But that's not really an option for
 me. So.

 "Just, don't put me next to either of those women." And with that, he
 finally lets go of you.

>talk to idie

 there's one thing you should know. I am left-handed."

 She raises her left hand, by way of evidence.

 "If you lack experience with left-handed people, of whom there are
 relatively few, you may not know about the problems that arise when a
 left-handed person sits to the right of a right-handed person at a
 meal. Their elbows often bump against each other. It can be very
 uncomfortable. If two left-handed people sit next to each other, of
 course, there is no problem. However, I am the only left-handed person
 here this evening. I have made sure to check. So please make sure that
 you do not place me with anyone sitting to my left. I would prefer to
 have someone sitting immediately to my right. If I am made to sit
 neighborless at the end of a table, I feel like a pariah, excluded from
 the group because of my unique needs.

 "John, your employer, claims to be ambidextrous. However, ambidexterity
 is a myth. I am sure he has only really managed to use his left hand
 for specific tasks, and only with a great deal of training."

 She pauses momentarily--not to let you get a word in edgewise, but to
 furrow her brow. "I thought it was unusual that he would say that about
 himself. I find that most frivolous claims to ambidexterity are made by
 Orientals."

 Well, that certainly took a turn.

>kiss idie


>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parlor</span>
 This is your favorite room in the house. The dÃ©cor is classy enough
 for guests to understand that they should avoid making a mess out of
 everything.

 This is due in large part to the magnificent oriental rug, covering
 most of the floor, and the delicate sabicu coffee table. Both are in an
 impossibly pristine condition, capable of inspiring respect from the
 most boorish of John's associates.

 John is sitting in his favorite easy chair, smiling absentmindedly.

 Across from him is Miss O, lounging on the couch as if it were a day
 bed.

>talk to john

 John looks up at you and switches to a different, broader smile. "Hey,
 everything going smoothly? Oh, you got the place cards. You know it
 doesn't matter to me, but you should probably go around and see if
 anyone has any weird preference about how they sit down. It doesn't
 matter to me, though, like I said.

 "But, you know, Ondine here is the guest of honor, right?" (Miss O
 touches her collarbone: <span class="floydstyle em">Who, me?</span>) "So, I suppose she would
 like to be seated to the right of the host. She's a classy lady; she
 notices that kind of thing."

 You nod dutifully.

>talk to ondine

 you can start talking.

 "Just a moment, John," she says. "Your associate needs for me to cut
 off our conversation for a moment. I assume it's something important."

 She turns to you. "Is this about the seating arrangement of the meal? I
 hadn't bothered to give it any thought. Hmm."

 She licks her lips.

 "I suppose I don't have any strong preferences. I'd hate for any of my
 silly whims to contradict those of the other guests. But don't you
 think John should sit at the head of the table? I suppose that goes
 without saying. After all, you're our gracious host, aren't you?"

 Miss O has directed this last sentence at John, apparently having
 decided she's wasted enough attention on you. You quietly step
 backward.

>examine john


 TYou've worked for John for so long that you can't decide what you
 think of him. Is his sarcasm grating, or is it charming? Is he really
 charming, or just handsome? Does he treat women like bite-sized
 Snickers because he loves them, or because he hates them?

 Then when he tilts his head, you realize: It's all confidence. He
 doesn't need to be handsome or charming. He's just confident.

>examine cards

 The papers are place cards, which are to be set out at the dinner table
 so everyone knows where to sit. The forms of the names are
 inconsistent: The men are "John," "Miles," "Ivan," and "Garry," but the
 women are "Miss Idie" and "Miss O."

 But that's not your problem. Your job is figuring out where to put
 these.

>go north


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Den</span>

>go west

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 The sun is going down outside the western window, and the huge table,
 set for six, is aflame in the orange glow. An old portrait hangs on one
 wall, watching the proceedings with creepy indifference.

 The kitchen is back north, the den is east from here, and a narrow door
 leads south to the foyer.

 Garry leans forward with both hands on the table, staring into the
 grain of the wood.

 Suddenly you hear someone pounding on the front door, with the force
 and frequency of a lumberjack chopping at a tree trunk. Garry almost
 jumps out of his skin. "They're coming after me!" he squeaks.

 You turn to answer the visitor, but through the narrow door you see
 John jumping up to beat you to it. You listen carefully for who it
 might be, but you can only barely hear John:

 "Well, hello! Whoa, that's a cold handshake. I didn't expect you! I
 mean, I didn't expect you this late. Everyone else is already here. But
 I should have forseen you'd have trouble with transportation. Whatever.
 Come on in."

 You hear a crunching sound.
>turn table
 It walks in through the narrow door, stooping its head, sending
 splinters flying from the frame. It lifts its head (it looks at you)
 and almost touches the ceiling. It looks at Garry. Garry falls to his
 knees.

 John grins. "Let me introduce you. Peter, this is my friend Garry.
 Garry, this is Peter. You remember Peter? Peter whose daughter I
 boned?"

 Garry whimpers. John laughs.

 "Anyway, he died, and this is a statue of him. He got up and walked
 here! Tell him why you're here, Pete."

 The statue rumbles: ## Because you invited me.

 "Yeah! I invited the statue to dinner! And he showed up!" John raises
 his hands in the air and smirks triumphantly. He is not nearly as
 bothered by this situation as he should be.

>examine statue

 It's the statue of Peter Ng, from the cemetery. It is cut from granite;
 it is larger than life. It has no joints, but it moves; its eyes are
 smooth, without irises, but it blinks.

 Technically, John wasn't the one who invited it to the party. You were.

 John's eyes dart around the room.

 "Oh, oh. Look, the table is only set for six. And the place cards
 haven't been set. This is a disaster. This is inexcusable."

 He walks over to you and takes the stack of cards from out of your
 hands. He turns toward "Peter" and grins.

 "These are pointless," he announces, and he starts ripping apart the
 cards. "People can sit where they want. I'll have Chucky put out a new
 setting. Yes. But for now..."

 He turns to you and pulls a key from out of his pocket. "There is a
 case of wine downstairs which I have been saving for just this kind of
 occasion. You like wine, right, Pete?"

 The statue seems to be trying to furrow its brow. ## I am no longer one
 of...

 "Nonsense! You trying to insult my hospitality?" He turns back and
 stares at you for a second, wiggling his eyebrows, before pressing the
 key into your hand.

>go south

 into the kitchen.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Kitchen</span>
 The kitchen, with all its drawers, its cupboards, its sinks and ovens,
 constitutes Chucky's domain, and he guards it jealously. Usually you
 use it only as a conduit between the dining room (south) and the tunnel
 to the cellar (down the stairs).

 Of course, working in here is part of your job, so you and Chucky have
 a deal worked out. The deal is: You do not touch <span class="floydstyle em">anything</span>.

 Chucky busies himself with some arcane cooking implements.

>examine key

 This "key" is supposed to "unlock" the wine cellar. It is useless. The
 fiddly piece at the end is too big to fit in any keyhole; the flat
 piece at the other end is engraved with three symbols: A "female" sign
 (a circle with a cross sticking out of it), a curvy number 4, and a
 little devil's trident. They are the astronomical symbols for Venus,
 Jupiter, and Neptune. In that order. Venus Jupiter Neptune.

>go down

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
 Technically this is more like an antechamber for the main cellar, but
 the room is longer than it is wide, and the ceiling is pretty low.
 Besides a boarded-up rathole, there's nothing to look at in here but
 the stairs up and the (infuriating) door in the south.

>examine rathole

 Those pests probably could chew through these boards if they really
 wanted, but they seem to have gotten the message and found someone else
 to harass.

>unboard rathole

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>go south

 (first opening the cellar door)
 The door does not budge. You must not have the right combination.

>examine door

 This thing is ridiculous.

 The corny combination lock on this door is supposed to keep intruders
 out of the cellar, protecting the most expensive wines and liquors. It
 cost thousands of dollars to commission and install. It is a stupid,
 gaudy piece of junk.

 There are three dials. You just turn a dial, and it slides over to the
 next setting. Each dial has three settings. There are only twenty-seven
 combinations. Any thief could go through all of them in just a few
 minutes.

 The left dial is marked with the astronomical symbols for Mercury,
 Venus, and Earth. It is currently pointing at Mercury.

 The center dial has the symbols for Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. It is
 pointing at Mars.

 The right dial has settings for Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. The symbol
 for Pluto is the stupidest; it's just a combination of the letters P
 and L. The dial is currently set to Uranus.

 A simple padlock would be so much more effective. So much simpler.

>turn left dial to venus



 Venus.

>turn middle dial to jupiter

 You turn the center dial until it points at the symbol for Jupiter.

>turn right dial to neptune

 You turn the right dial until it points at the symbol for Neptune.

 You hear a scream upstairs. Someone must have just been introduced to
 Peter.

>go south

 (first opening the cellar door)
 The door swings open.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Wine Cellar</span>
 John only buys the most expensive wines and spirits he can find. In the
 eyes of his friends, anyway, that makes him a conoisseur. This room
 isn't packed to the brim, but what it does contain is worth defending.

 A sickly red and yellow bottle lying on its side in the corner would
 seem to be the exception.

 Nearby is a crate of a particular wine which John apparently thinks is
 worth saving for a special occasion.

 A crowbar leans against the wall.

>get crowbar

 It's a crowbar, but you take it.

>smash all

 You can't use multiple objects with that verb.

>examine bottle

 security system? It probably belongs to Chucky.

>take bottle

 You drop the crowbar so that you can carry the repellent bottle.

>take crowbar

 You probably shouldn't leave the bottle lying around.
 You happily discard your bottle, so as to carry the crowbar with both
 hands.

>open crate with crowbar

 You stick the end of the crowbar under the lip of the crate and begin
 redistributing some force.

 You hear a crunching sound. The dining room is right above you; that
 must be the statue moving around. The back of your neck tingles: it
 <span class="floydstyle em">did</span> nod at you, back in the cemetery. How long has it been
 alive? Is it alive?

 Your leveraging efforts are rewarded: The nail in one corner of the lid
 pops up. Three to go.

>again

 You reposition yourself and stick the crowbar under the lid again.

 From upstairs: a shriek so shrill it could be steel rasping against
 glass, or a scream, or you don't know what. You should go up and make
 sure nobody's hurt.

 But then you hear laughter. They're fine.

 A little more force, and the second nail comes out.

>again


 Now you hear a low scraping, a scraping that can only be someone
 dragging those heavy dining room chairs over those gorgeous hardwood
 floors. Your lips twist in rage; you look at the nail and imagine it is
 Ivan's head.

 It slides out of the crate with a pop. Just one more.

>again

 The last one should be easy. You slide in the crowbar...

 Suddenly the party upstairs is silent. No. Suddenly? It had been silent
 for a few seconds before you noticed anything. Or maybe it's not
 silent. You can hear something rustling. Or is that just people
 talking?

 You strain to listen, but then all you can hear is your own heartbeat.

 The last nail slides out, and the whole lid slides away. You drop your
 crowbar and pull out a bottle.

>examine bottle

 Which do you mean, the bottle of PrÃ©venge or the bottle of
 Thunderbird?

>examine revenge

 You can't see any such thing.

>examine thunderbird

 You regard the bottle with disgust. You couldn't possibly serve it to
 the guests. Maybe you could use it to kill a houseplant.

>examine provenge


>examine prevenge

 (the bottle of PrÃ©venge)
 You had the pleasure of experiencing PrÃ©venge at the same tasting
 where John decided he had to buy several crates. It's nothing special.

>drink thunderbird

 You don't have a corkscrew handy, which is just as well. Just the fumes
 off of this stuff could be hazardous to your health.

>inventory

 You are carrying:
   a bottle of PrÃ©venge
   a bottle of Thunderbird
   an ornate key

>take prevenge

 (the crate of PrÃ©venge)
 Taking the entire crate upstairs would be too much--no matter
 <span class="floydstyle em">who</span> is visiting.

>take bottle of prevenge

 You'd better not leave the bottle here; John is expecting you to come
 back with some liquid.
 You cannot gracefully carry two wine bottles at once. You drop the
 other bottle in favor of the PrÃ©venge.

 There seems to be something happening down in the dining room.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 Everything is on fire. The floor is burning and the walls are burning
 and the table looks like a big bonfire; all the settings are twinkling
 in the light of the flames. The room is rapidly filling with smoke.

 Captain Miles seems to be nursing one of his migraines.

 Miss Idie is sitting on the floor, staring into the blaze of the table.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Would you stop that? There are people watching.</span>

>For the l?ve of G?d, floyd
>examine smoke

 Smoke is rapidly filling the room, but for now you seem to be able to

 <span class="floydstyle em">Would you stop that? There are people watching.</span>

>ask idie about fire

 Hope looks up at you and begins pulling off one of her legs.

 "I've been informed that I should feel some remorse over my opinions on
 the Asian race," she says. She throws her leg onto the burning table
 and begins removing one of her arms.

 "If all I have to do is apologize, then I apologize. There." She tosses
 the arm into the flames and gets to work pulling off the other arm.

 Her expression changes: she glares at you as if in warning. "I am being
 compelled to apologize against my will. None of this is sincere; I'm
 just acting this out to make him happy." She jerks her head backward,
 toward the narrow door. "I don't know how he's doing it. They're crafty
 that way. But why am I going on like this?"

 She throws her other arm and leg onto the fire glumly. "There's not
 much I can do about it now."

 She throws the rest of herself onto the fire, and in an instant the
 heat shrivels her like a plastic bag.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Have you been paying any attention? At all?</span>

>inhale smoke


>talk to miles

 Miles looks at you through his fingers, still rubbing his head. "Oh,
 there you are," he says.

 His fingers are skeleton bones instead of fingers. "I'm supposed to say
 something, so I'll say it to you. The thing I'm supposed to say is, I'm
 sorry."

 Now the skin and muscle is gone from his face. "Not sure what I'm
 supposed to be sorry about. It's really hot in here, and it's hard to
 think. Maybe I'm supposed to be sorry about Hope, you know."

 His face comes back for a second so he can squint in frustration.
 "That's a complicated thing to be sorry for. But the other stuff I did,
 I don't want to admit to doing. So I'll go with that."

 He nods his skull a couple times, then his skeleton falls apart and
 burns up.

 <span class="floydstyle em">No. I don't care anymore. Do what you want.</span>

 Which do you mean, the bottle of PrÃ©venge or the bottle of

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Dining Room</span>
 Everything is on fire. The floor is burning and the walls are burning

 in the light of the flames. The room is rapidly filling with smoke.

 The fire has already spread through here; it's climbing up the sides of
 the pool table and the credenza.

 The elephant foot umbrella stand is here.

 Across from him is Miss O, lounging on the couch as if it were a day
 bed.

 Ivan is leaning on a bar stool, apparently standing only with great
 effort.

 <span class="floydstyle em">You wanna let me finish?</span>

 It must have walked here by itself; it's too heavy to be carried.

 <span class="floydstyle em">I've had enough of this attitude.</span>

>talk to odine

 You can't see any such thing.

>talk to miss o

 Miss O hobbles over to you as fast as she can.

 "I'm sorry," she gasps. "I'm sorry." She reaches to touch your face,
 but her arm suddenly swings wildly.

 It is made of wood. You can see the veins of the grain working their
 way up to her head.

 "I think this might be ironic," she rasps. But now her head is made of
 wood, and now she's on fire, and now she is a pile of ashes.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Do you really need me to tell you this?</span>

>talk to ivan


 The doctor wobbles, then topples; he manages to save himself by falling
 backward on the pool table.

 "I am having an epiphany. Right now I am realizing that I am basically
 a drug dealer," he says. "Because I never stop hooking these people up
 with their pills. I mean addicts. They're not people, they're addicts."

 His spine falls out of his back, and he flops to the floor.

 His eyes widen: he has had another epiphany. "That was a terrible thing
 to say," he gurgles. "I'm sorry."

 He tries to curl up in a fetal position against a leg of the table, but
 the table rears back in disgust and stomps him out like an insect.

 <span class="floydstyle em">I'm done with this.</span>

>go south


 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Parlor</span>
 The couch and chair are being rapidly consumed by flames; the rug is
 almost completely gone.

 You can hear people yelling in the foyer to the west.

 Garry lies on the coffee table, his eyes closed, his feet hanging off
 the end awkwardly.

 <span class="floydstyle em">I'm done with this.</span>

>talk to gerry


>talk to garry

 "I did something bad," he mumurs, without opening his eyes. "I took
 something that didn't belong to me."

 He grimaces. "I stole from my office. I stole a chair."

 You roll your eyes.

 "But I don't deserve a chair. Even the electric chair is too good for
 me. The statue has come to punish me, and I'll wait here for him to do
 what he will. After he gets done with John." He takes a deep breath.

 "Message repeats. I did something bad. I took something that didn't
 belong to me." Oh, for Pete's sake.

 <span class="floydstyle em">I've had enough of this attitude.</span>

>examine garry

 He's holding your lilies over his chest. He's sweating all over, but
 there's a smile on his face.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Don't think for a minute you're getting away with anything.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Foyer</span>
 You've almost escaped. The front door is to the south.

 John is sitting in one of the high-backed chairs. The one next to him
 is empty.

 The statue is here.

 The wall clock is on the floor, shattered.

 The statue rumbles: ## Repent.

 John sighs in exasperation. "I already told you, man. I'm sorry for
 murdering you. I mean, killing you. In self-defense. It was a wrong
 place, wrong time kind of thing."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Repent. roars the statue, and a wave of heat rolls out of it like a</span>
 sonic boom.

 "No! I said already! Already I told you this! I cannot apologize for
 screwing your daughter. I have to be true to myself, man."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">But you must-- the statue attempts, but John is on a roll.</span>

 "And what myself is, is, a lover. Of ladies. You can't take that away
 from me. And I can't apologize for that. I mean, I can, but I'm not
 gonna."

 The statue creaks. It turns toward you.

>hit john
 <span class="floydstyle subheader">You.</span>

 It points at the chair next to John. ## It is your turn. Sit. Join your
 master.

 "Oh, hey!" Now John notices you. "Look, this guy wants us to apologize
 for all the terrible stuff we did. I don't know if it's a religious
 thing, or if he's just angsty about being dead, or what. Either way,
 we're gonna burn to death, so..."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sit, insists the statue.</span>

 <span class="floydstyle em">You're not listening. You're not listening.</span>

>dazzle statue with parlor tricks

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>talk to john

 "Nothing right now, thanks," John says, keeping his eyes on Miss O.
 "Remember, though, about the guest of honor, on the host's right."

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sit, and repent. The statue seems to want to throw you bodily into</span>
 the chair.

 "Come on!" cries John. "Let's get this over with!"

 <span class="floydstyle em">Have you been paying any attention? At all?</span>

>sit

 What do you want to sit on?

>sit on chair

 You sit down next to John. The statue looks at you. The flames rise.

 John leans back and smiles: his body turns into a pile of ashes. Then
 yours does too; then the chairs, and then the rest of the house.
 Everything is gone, except the statue.

 Math camp's been cool so far, and not because it's far away from your
 parents. A grant from some governmental symposium for the math and the

 them seem to have had more cool experiences.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Quad</span>
 You are in the center of the Main Quad at Hicksville Tech. Paths lead
 in all directions. You've been here a few days, but you still haven't
 really explored west and northwest.

 Afternoon classes for Math Camp are over, and you just feel like
 wandering around a bit.

>examine me

 Shorts and a plain gray t-shirt. You've come under a bit of fire for
 having no T-shirts with clever writing.

 This after hearing it for having too many back at high school.

 It really could have been worse. It will make a decent souvenir of

 It hasn't changed since last you looked. It's like laminated or
 something.

>go west

 That way look promising enough to get sort-of lost in, but it's not
 really a forest. You see the Admissions Office just past. It ruins the
 feeling of exploration completely. You return to the Quad.

 You're only lost enough to feel a little adventurous. You think. One

 You wander around for a bit. It's a fun experience, being a bit lost.
 It reminds you of Boy Scout camp, back when you were still a
 Tenderfoot, and you didn't know a thing about tracking. Of course
 you'll find your way out of here, though.

>about

 This game was written for the intfiction.org TMBG Apollo 18 20th
 anniversary tribute. It's a silly little physics puzzle, with some
 various attempts at humor and also some small memories of a nice time I
 spent at the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics. Where
 people let me fit in right away.

 People who helped me with beta testing are listed in the CREDITS. They
 helped make this game better.

>spin me

 That's not a verb I recognise.

>get lost

 You can't see any such thing.

>credits

 First, I would like to thank my beta-testers. So might you--any bugs
 and nuisances and parser stupidity you find would've been worse (e.g.
 unwinnable) without them. They (the testers, not the bugs) are, in
 random order: Melvin Rangamasy and Ed Blair. I hope you enjoy their
 games in this collection too.

 However, this game would not have been conceived without Kevin
 Jackson-Mead organizing the entire album tribute.

 I would also like to thank Ryan Veeder for creating a document of ideas
 for each song/game, and all the people on IFMud and intfiction.org who
 helped with coding and implementation details that often led to bigger
 realizations. There are too many people to name.

 Of course, general thanks go to Graham Nelson for creating Inform 7,
 David Kinder for creating the Windows front-end, and Aaron Reed for his
 wonderful book Programming in Inform 7. If you'd like to try your hand
 at writing, check the IDE out on inform7.com, or Sand-Dancer, Aaron's
 excellent sample game from the book at [<a href=".">LINK</A>]

 Hey, kind of odd to see a limousine parked here. It's not an
 obnoxiously rich limousine, more the forbiddingly secret type.


 You can't see any such thing.

 It's dark all over, of course.

>open limo

 You approach the limousine. A man in a black suit jumps out of the
 limousine and grabs you. "You're with that math program, right?" You
 suspect he knows the answer, so you nod. "We need you for something,"
 he says, as he flashes some sort of governmental badge. "Just to check.
 You do have ID?"

 Well, at least these questions are easier than the ones you get in
 class or at the daily theorem presentation.

>show id to man

 "Good. Will you come with us, please?"

 No choice, really. You climb in the back seat, and the FBI agent joins
 a CIA agent in the front, who drives off.

 Tinted soundproof glass divides you from the agents in the front. You
 probably can't do much except wait.

 You can see a FBI agent and a CIA agent here.

 Apparently, you spent more time figuring out what to do than you
 thought. The limousine takes a turn off to a side road and enters some
 sort of garage. You can feel it going down a hill, and then it comes to
 a halt. The agents beckon for you to get out, and you do. What have you
 gotten yourself in for?


 Please press SPACE to continue.

 "Okay, here's the deal," says the FBI man. "We had this problem in this
 one weapons facility. The laser guns worked ok but the mutant robot
 spiders...not so much. We need to wipe all traces of 'em from this here
 research facility. Then we need to sort of destroy the facility. But we
 can't just bomb it. Too suspicious. We need someone to go in there,
 clear the spiders, and get out."

 You know who that someone is.

 "Oh, if you're wondering what you get out of it, the budget for your
 precious camp doesn't get cut. This year. We've done statistical
 studies, and Hicksville's program provides the worst return on
 investment for--well--people who go out in the world and do something
 constructive. How bout it?"

 You have no choice. The FBI agent disappears after handing you a bag
 labeled SPIDER COMBATING KIT.

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Spiderbrain Center</span>
 You are in the center of the structure. You can go pretty much any way
 except south. The exit from all this appears to be to the north, where
 you can see a very, very big laser gun in the distance.

 There's an important looking panel by the north wall. It's got a bunch
 of buttons on it, with a bunch of pictures to the side.

 A large mirror (facing sort of between north and northeast--we'll call
 it NNE, NEN or even ENN) is at the edge of the platform.

>examine kit

 It sort of reminds you of what you guess Douglas Adams was thinking
 about when he came up with the Thing Your Aunt Gave You Which You Don't
 Know What It Is. It's bulky and maybe a bit spiky and can be zipped
 open or closed. It's maybe twice the size of a school backpack and
 probably more than twice as fun.

>open kit

 Man! There's all kinds of weird stuff in here! Stuff so weird you just
 have to examine it for yourself!

>examine kit

 It's cool enough you'd like one, but the government types will probably
 confiscate it if you figure out how to leave anyway.

 In the Spider combating Kit are a recursive data chip, a pack of 104
 cards, a leg steroid pill, a juicy gourmet fly casserole, an In-a-Pinch
 Infrasound Generator, a mini-vacuum, Packet of instant lemonade and a
 spray bottle.

>examine chip

 You see nothing special about the recursive data chip.

>examine cards

 Strange. They're all the same suit.

>examine buttons

 There's a big button at the top, then six more in a sort of hexagon.
 Hm, seven buttons, seven guns, seven exits.

    ## 7
   ## 1 ## 2
  ## 3   ## 4
   ## 5 ## 6

 [BOLD buttons are still active, and * means the button's gun is
 destroyed. To see an individual button, X BUTTON (1-7).]

>examine pill

 Probably small enough to sneak into something. It's one of those hard
 capsules, not easily dissolvable gel.

>examine casserole

 It looks worse than the stuff in the cafeteria. Well, to you.

>examine generator

 It has writing saying ONE USE ONLY on it.

 The In-a-Pinch Infrasound Generator is currently switched off.

 It's got a bag about the size of a basketball. You probably won't be
 using it to clean dust.

 The mini-vacuum is currently switched off.

 Taken.

 The spider probably won't notice it there. Good thinking.

 You are carrying:
   a Spider combating Kit (open)
     a recursive data chip
     a pack of 104 cards
     a juicy gourmet fly casserole
     an In-a-Pinch Infrasound Generator
     a mini-vacuum
     a spray bottle
   your summer program ID

>turn on generator

 It's broken.

>give cards to spider

 (the wheezing metallic spider)
 (first taking the pack of 104 cards)
 The spider grabs the pack. It schleps them into eight piles and then
 starts laying them down suit by suit. Then it starts trying to put them
 in K-Q-J-10 order. It doesn't seem to be having any fun, but it can't
 stop doing it. There's also some deal where it splatters eight cards at
 a time. The spider becomes increasingly agitated until it explodes.

 You aren't sure what the hell happened, but--man--that looked even less
 fun than solitaire. Oh, you can probably futz with that mirror now.

 You are in the center of the structure. You can go pretty much any way
 except south. The exit from all this appears to be to the north, where
 you can see a very, very big laser gun in the distance.

 There's an important looking panel by the north wall. It's got a bunch
 of buttons on it, with a bunch of pictures to the side.

 A large mirror (facing NNE) is at the edge of the platform.

 There's a big tall shiny wall that way. But you can go pretty much any

 You're not sure which noses share which nostril, or what. You picture
 the spider wearing a fake glasses-and-moustache, for no particular
 reason.

>give casserole to spider


 (first taking the juicy gourmet fly casserole)
 The spider eats the casserole, and then its legs swell. It falls over,
 unable to guard you from the mirror any more. You kick it off to the

 You can also see a confusingly mustachioed spider here.

>examine spider

 (the confusingly mustachioed spider)
 The mustache seems asymmetrical, a cross between a standard brush
 mustache and a handlebar. You wonder if people did this, or the spider
 groomed itself. It's disturbing either way.

>give chip to spider

 (first taking the recursive data chip)
 The spider latches onto it and begins to crawl all over it and process
 it. But because the chip is recursive, the spider can't stop. It tries
 to calculate faster and faster but winds up blowing itself out, and the
 chip with it.

 The Deva Loka is locked in a fierce battle with the mind-controlling
 Sirens.

 You are Lieutenant Commander Gruntik Hauror, though everyone just calls
 you "The Lion."  The captain and first mate are largely to blame: they
 never refer to you as anything but "The Lion," even when giving orders
 to others.  It's not an inaccurate nickname, as you are the only
 leonoid in a crew otherwise made entirely of canoids (and what a bunch
 of dogs they are).  Your nickname isn't even disrespectful--a massive
 lion a full head taller than anyone else aboard the ship commands
 respect regardless of rank.  Even so, you would appreciate hearing your
 rank once in a while.

 Now, though, was not the time.

 A roughly humanoid, oxygen-breathing, carbon-based life form

>l up siren biology in database

 Measures between 218 to 270 centimeters in height and weighs between 70
 and 90 kilos. Locomotes and manipulates tools with four arrays of
 prehensile tentacles. Possesses thick, rubbery dermal substrates
 ranging from gray-green to blue-purple, covered in a fine layer of pale
 vibriassae extremely sensitive to changes in air pressure. Rudimentary
 eyespots permit awareness of light levels, and it has been proposed
 that their primary means of navigation is echolocation. At least four
 distinct auditory reception orifices have been identified, distributed
 in a radially symmetrical fashion. Eyewitness reports have compared the
 appearance of these sunken cavities to suppurating wounds as observed
 in Terran mammals. Respiratory anatomy appears to permit simultaneous
 intermission of gases from multiple orifices into multiple lung or
 lunglike structures, thus preventing these life forms from ever running
 out of breath. It has been proposed that a large portion of their
 muscular weight is devoted to their laryngeal anatomy, as they are
 capable of producing acoustic pressures in excess of 140 dB in a range
 from 16 to 16745 Hz. It has been proposed that they may possess a
 thoracic sac which allows them to generate such notably low
 frequencies, but although there are no external morphological
 indications to the contrary, this theory is unlikely to be proven by
 any means other than dissection.

 This is the bridge of the Alliance starship Deva Loka, in orbit around
 Earth.

 You can see a Command Station, Flight Control, Operations Management,
 Tactical Control, Mission Operations, Lieutenant Rynin, and Lieutenant
 Jeldysh here.

 The Sirens have boarded, and they are making their way through the
 ship.  Deafening the crew with earplugs, loud noises, and anything else
 the medical team could think of didn't work: something in the Sirens'
 song can be heard and understood where the panicked barking of orders
 and warnings cannot.

 What's worse, however, is that the captain and first officer left the
 bridge to serenade the Sirens with their abysmal musical skills.  Your
 console showed the Sirens visibly wincing their crooning, but their
 song quickly overpowered your superiors.

 The mangy dogs of this ship are in a panic.  You should be in command,
 but the dogs can't hear you over their own howling and attempts at
 deafness.  You do not bark orders: you are the Lion, and a lion can
 always manage to be heard...

>ROAR

 <span class="floydstyle em">"In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the Lion takes</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">control."</span>

 You let out a tremendous roar, silencing all of the subordinates around
 you.  Clearly, the Lion is now the Captain.

 Now what to do?  Rynin reports that the sirens are encroaching coming
 closer to the bridge.  It appears that the mind-controlled Bok is with
 them, singing beautifully.  You wince, fighting the urge to panic.
 Jeldysh brings you back to reality by reporting the ship is taking
 heavy fire and you need to find a solution now.  You turn your
 attention to the planet below.  Maybe a solution can be found there.

 The ship rocks ominously from side to side.

>look up Earth in database

 Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the
 solar nebula, and life appeared on its surface within one billion
 years. The planet is home to millions of species, including humans.
 Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other
 abiotic conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic
 organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which, together
 with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful solar radiation, permitting
 life on land.

 There is silence.  In space.

>sit at tactical

 You hurry over to Tactical Control.

 There is silence.  In space.

>examine tactical

 Tactical thinks tactically.  Also, tactical takes care of communication
 both inside and outside the ship.

 You and Lieutenant Rynin is stationed here.

 Perhaps you should order someone to scan for bad music? Need "help"
 with giving orders?

 You note that this is not one of those missions that end with everyone
 admiring the scenery out the window.

>rynin, scan for bad music

 I could easily scan to find the least harmonious music on earth. Then
 we would need to contact them - I could patch you through to their
 comm.

 That's it!  That's the band you need.

 <span class="floydstyle em">Hey!  Who's that playing the guitar?</span>

 "Well, I guess that explains it," you say, feeling a bit glum.  "Maybe
 we'll be better now, but we could really use some inspiration."  As if
 on cue, your phone begins to ring.  Now whom have you lent it to?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Garage (in the band)</span>
 You're in the detached garage of your friend's small Cambridge home.
 It's a warm, sunny, clear day and the quiet makes it an ideal day for
 some practice.  Around the garage is a garage door.

 In the band you can see an amp, a mixer, a drum machine, Karl, Abby,
 and Pamela.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

>listen

 You hear nothing unexpected.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

>examine karl

 Karl is thoroughly unremarkable.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

>phone, hello

 You can't talk to the violet phone.

>examine abby

 Abby is rebelling against corporate life in the most conservative way
 possible. Her long hair is carefully groomed to look like it wasn't.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

>examine pamela

 Pamela has been in many bands before and is the most experienced of the
 bunch.  She happily goes along with all your great ideas, cringing only
 once.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

>pick up phone

 Which do you mean, the white phone, the red phone, the blue phone, or
 the violet phone?

>examine white phone

 Upon inspecting the phone, you determine that it's actually Pamela's.
 It is not ringing.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

 Upon inspecting the phone, you determine that it's actually Karl's.

 That seems to belong to Pamela.

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

>ask pamela for blue phone

 You hear your phone ringing insistently.

>answer blue phone

 You answer the blue phone.

 "Well, who is it?" asks Abby, annoyed.

   "Um guys..." you stammer.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"The Lion's on the phone."</span>



 Please press SPACE to continue.

 As soon as you answer the phone, the world seemed to dissolve around
 you, and suddenly you, your friends, and all your equipment is standing
 in what looks to be the set of the worst science fiction television
 show ever.  Standing by the Captain's chair is a giant, humanoid lion.
 Not only that, he is talking.  Not only is he talking, he is insulting
 you.  "Quazar Beam", he bellows. "I have found one of the most
 cacophonous sounds on earth.  To save the world, I need you to play as
 badly as possible."  You stare. "Time is short", says the Lion.  "You
 must hurry." Well, what else are you going to do?

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bridge (in the band)</span>
 This is the bridge of the Alliance starship Deva Loka, in orbit around
 Earth.

 You can see a Command Station, Flight Control, Operations Management,
 Tactical Control, Mission Operations, Captain Hauror, Lieutenant Rynin,
 and Lieutenant Jeldysh here.

 In the band you can see an amp, a mixer, a drum machine, Karl, Abby,
 and Pamela.

 On the monitor, sparks can be seen in some far-away compartment

>turn on amp

 You switch the amp on.

 There is silence.  In space.

>play guitar

 You hear your guitar.  Its notes echo loudly through Bridge producing a
 sounds just like your standard screaming rock guitar.  But it sounded
 awful when played with the others in the band just then.

 Somewhere in the background an alarm begins to honk.

>play

 You begin to play your music, and it sounds horrible.  The Sirens,
 leading a mindless horde of singing crew members, have entered the
 bridge in their terrifying chorus.

   You and your band find yourselves swept into their song.

  You burst into the eerie chant that is the Sirens' song, and you feel
 your fear melt away.  Your garage, the ship, and the Lion are all but
 distant memories.  The notes and rhythm rise and fall in what feels
 like inexorable harmony: like a song you can't get out of your head.
 The song is your world, and your world is this song.  You sing it, and
 you sing with the thralls.

  The Sirens, however, do not share your musical rapture.  They writhe
 in pain, fighting to sing, until at last one collapses onto the ground
 and starts to scream.  The scream jolts you back to your senses as the
 other Sirens fall to the ground in cacophonous wails.  The noise is so
 awful, you hope you never remember them.

  Suddenly the Sirens are gone.  Everyone slowly and cautiously takes
 their fingers out of their ears.  "Thank you." says the Lion.

 <span class="floydstyle em">"In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the Lion waves</span>
 <span class="floydstyle em">goodbye."</span>

 "Wait!", you say. "What's going on?  Are we safe now? What were those
 things? How does space travel work? And are our cats and dogs...
 well... "  Before you can finish the bridge dissolves...

 Boston, four months later: In the center of the city, a new band is
 playing at the music festival.  The sound is distinctly different: a
 prog rock for the modern era.  The crowd, enraptured by the anthem-like
 melody of worry-free joy, joins in on the top song of the festival: The
 Sirens' Song.  Passersby turn to look at the band they've never heard
 before.
