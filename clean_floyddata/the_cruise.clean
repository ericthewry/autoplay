 You'd never won any sweepstakes before, but last Tuesday was your
 lucky day.  You opened your bottle of soda at lunchtime, and to your
 absolute amazement found "YOU WIN" printed on the inside of the cap.
 Upon further investigation, you found that you'd won a free 3-day
 Caribbean cruise on The Rhinoceros.  You had no idea how the cruise
 ship ended up with a name like that, but that didn't dissuade you from
 taking advantage of your prize.  So you packed your bags and came here
 to Miami for your free vacation.  Now The Rhinoceros towers above you
 to the east.  A boarding platform extends invitingly from her hull.

 you.

 Currently, the suitcase is closed.

 Video Arcade
    Colors blare forth from screens all over the room.  The games range
 from the newest technicolor 3-D creations to old classics.  To the
 east, more money-wasting machines blare out noises in the casino.  The
 comparatively serene lobby lies to the west, and the grand hall is off
 to the south.

>xyzzy
    A hollow voice whispers, "I saw a 't' on top of a castle!"

 A goat runs through the lounge.  A llama chases after it.  The glue is
 dripping down the side of the bottle.

 I doubt that made any sense to you, since it's an inside joke.  Well,
 when you type something out-of-context like xyzzy you should expect an
 out-of-context response.  If you expected to be teleported, too bad
 for you.  This isn't Zork.     Friday Afternoon

 It's time for lunch.  You should go to the dining room soon.

 Casino
    This is the ship's casino, where dozens of vacationers go every day
 to get rid of their excess money.  The casino's designers apparently
 didn't care much for variety.  No blackjack, poker, or craps tables
 are here.  There isn't a roulette wheel either.  There are, however,
 slot machines, and lots of them.  However, only one of them is
 currently open.  Due to the huge crowd of people in the casino, you
 can't even get close enough to the other machines to get a good look
 at them.  The arcade is to the west, the bar is to the south, and the
 grand hall is to the southwest.

>examine people
 The gamblers are mindlessly plunking money into the slot machines,
 hoping to win the jackpot.

 The Bar
    A man dressed in an odd-looking black hooded robe sits on one of
 the barstools, drinking a foamy beer.  Besides him, no one else is in
 the bar.  Behind the bar, the bartender is nowhere to be seen.
 Perhaps he is taking a break.  Perhaps, that is why the bar is so
 empty.  To the north, vacationers gamble away their money in the
 casino.  A corridor to the west leads to the grand hall.
    The old man extends a single hairy finger outside of his robe and
 beckons to you.  "You!", he calls in a low, raspy voice.  "Come have a
 seat.  I must tell you something important."


 The old man snakes a strong, thin, gnarly arm out of his cloak and
 takes a long drink of his ale.  Then the arm disappears back into his
 cloak.  But although you could have sworn you saw the frothy amber
 liquid emptying into his mouth, you notice the mug is still full to
 the brim.

>examine man
 The old man sits at the bar.  His robe shimmers strangely.  Although
 he is obviously very old, his posture is straight, and he appears
 strong and healthy.
    His face is wrinkled and is shrouded in the shadow of his hood.
 His eyes are deepset but stare penetratingly out from between his
 wrinkles.  Great wisdom seems to emanate from them.  His nose is thin
 and bends slightly to the left.  His lips are almost hidden within the
 shadows of his cloak.  You can just barely make out the top of a long,
 thick, grey beard that extends from just below his lower lip down into
 his robe.

>examine mug
 The ale is a dark amber and is very frothy.  It is contained in a
 heavy glass mug.  The foam bubbles and churns.

 "Did you not hear me?"  asks the old man.  Come have a seat.  I must
 tell you something."

>sit
 (the barstool)

    "Listen to my words!"
    "I am a powerful wizard.  I am aligned with the forces of good.
 Another powerful wizard is trapped in a magical location on this ship.
 He is aligned with the forces of evil.  The island to which ship
 travels has come into alignment with a place of great evil magical
 power located in another universe. When the ship reaches the island,
 the evil wizard will slowly accrue power from the power source in the
 other universe.  If the ship stays at the island long enough, he will
 accrue enough power to break free from the magical forces that hold
 him prisoner.  Then he will conquer the entire earth and enslave the
 entire human race.
    "There is only one way that this can be prevented.  Three power
 crystals are located on this ship, all on different decks from each
 other.  You must find them.  In order to invoke their power, you must
 hold them in your hands; you cannot put them in any sort of container.
 After you have found them, taking them to the location of the portal
 to the evil wizard's prison will cause the area to be illuminated in a
 bright pink aura.  You must go up from that location several times to
 reach the evil wizard's prison.  You must bring the three power
 crystals to the place where the evil wizard is before he accrues
 enough power to break free.  The crystals will cause him to be
 destroyed.
    "You are probably wondering why I don't gather these crystals
 myself since I am such a powerful wizard.  The problem is that this is
 something only you can do.  You have a special aura about you.
 Because of this aura, you can gather the crystals.  Because of this
 aura, you can use them to defeat the evil wizard.  I cannot cast any
 spells to assist you; if I do, the crystals will be destroyed.
    "I can, however, help you by giving you two magical items:  an evil
 detector and some magic eyedrops.  The evil detector will tell you how
 much evil power the evil wizard has absorbed from the evil power
 source.  If it reads 275 or higher, he will have enough power to
 escape from his confines.  The magic eyedrops will allow you to see
 the power crystals, which are normally invisible to ordinary people."
    The wizard pulls something out of the depths of his cloak that
 looks very similar to a digital wristwatch and puts it around your
 wrist.  "This is the evil detector", he says.
    The wizard takes a spray bottle out of the depths of his robe and
 sprays a liquid from it into your eyes.  It stings for a while, but
 after the stinging goes away, you feel as if your vision is somehow
 more acute.  "Those were the magic eyedrops," he says.
    "Before you go, I must warn you of one thing," says the wizard.
 "The special aura that surrounds you is a mixed blessing.  It does
 allow you to collect the crystals and defeat the evil wizard.  Its
 drawback, however, is that if you come in complete alignment with an
 evil power source in another universe, you will die.  This means that
 you must not go out onto the island.
    "Oh, one more thing:  You're probably thinking that this is a
 ridiculous scenario, that surely since I am such a powerful wizard I
 can do this myself.  To help you understand the situation better, I
 will remind you of a story you have probably heard before, that of
 Aladdin.  In that story, a powerful sorcerer wanted to get a magical
 lamp out of a cave.  However, only Aladdin could enter the cave.  It
 didn't matter that the sorcerer was a powerful sorcerer.  Only Aladdin
 could enter the cave.
    "If you want to hear all this again, ask me about the evil wizard."

 Your score just went up 5 points!

 Okay, you're now sitting on the barstool.

>examine detector
 The evil detector looks similar to a digital wristwatch.  However,
 instead of telling you the time, it tells you how much evil power the
 evil wizard has absorbed.  If it gets up to 275, the evil wizard can
 break free and take over the world.  Currently, it reads 0.

 If you don't hurry up and go to the dining room you'll be late for
 lunch!

>examine ship information pamphlet
    *The Rhinoceros is so named because the designer's favorite animal
 was the rhino.  He wanted to have pictures of rhinos painted all over
 the ship, but the cruise line refused.  The designer reluctantly
 agreed, but only under the condition that the ship be named in honor
 of his favorite animal.

    *The Rhinoceros is 327 feet long and comes 22 feet above the water
 at its highest point.  Its cruising speed is 23 knots.

    *Believe it or not, large, powerful magnets occupy the bow and
 stern of The Rhinoceros.  Their orientation is such that any compass
 on the ship will always tell you that the bow is to the north and the
 stern to the south Therefore, the lobby, for instance, is always to
 the "north" of the boarding area no matter which direction the ship is
 travelling.  These magnets are in all of this cruise line's ships
 because our eccentric CEO insists that the magnetic fields will have
 positive effect on the health of the passengers and crew.  The magnets
 do not affect the ship's navigation because the captain uses GPS
 (global positioning system) to determine which direction it is
 travelling.

 The clerk puts her right index finger inside of her right cheek and
 then pulls it out, making a loud popping noise.

 Outside of the Theater
    This is the hallway just outside the theater.  A door to the north
 leads into to the theater.  The suites are to the southwest, and the

 You have a pair of goggles (being worn), an evil detector (being

 purple power crystal, a wallet, and a room key.

>examine evil detector
 The evil detector looks similar to a digital wristwatch.  However,
 instead of telling you the time, it tells you how much evil power the
 evil wizard has absorbed.  If it gets up to 275, the evil wizard can
 break free and take over the world.  Currently, it reads 0.
