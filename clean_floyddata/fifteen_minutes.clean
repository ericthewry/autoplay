 You're in trouble. Professor Hildebrand has not taken kindly to that F
 on your latest Science test.

 And now here you are in the science lab, facing a small angry
 professor, his beard literally bristling as he berates you in that
 faint German accent you've come to know so well.

 "You do not listen," he shouts, flinging his arms into the air in
 frustration, "it is as though you do not care at all about science!"

 He's right, of course. You don't. In fact, you're not really listening
 even now. Up to the point he says "fail" and "expel". That's not good.
 You probably should do something about that.

 "Gaah," says the professor, "I waste my time." He glances at his
 watch, "I will be back in 15 minutes. Please do not leave the room
 until I return. Then we shall see the principal together, yes?"
 Waggling his finger, he leaves the Laboratory and closes the door
 behind him.

 An Interactive Tight Spot by Ade McT
 Release 1 / Serial number 140929 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
 6/12N)

 <span class="floydstyle subheader">Laboratory</span>
 The room is full of all sorts of equipment which might make sense if
 you had read your textbooks. Or paid attention in class. Or turned up.
 A closed door to the south leads into the main hallway.


 A clock on the wall reads 2:13 pm.

 A complicated machine is bolted to the floor in the centre of the
 room.




 Rather like a deconstructed telephone booth. A complicated thing,
 indeed. On the side is written, in stencilled letters - Time machine:
 Prototype v1.01.

 On the front of the machine are: four switches in a line: (from left
 to right) a grey switch, a black switch a red switch and a green
 switch; a silver toggle; an array of dip-switches; a set of dials; and
 a go button. A sturdy handle sticks out of the side. Pasted to the
 sides are a page of intructions and a hazard warning sheet.

 The grey switch is set to nucleus. The black switch is set to
 harmonic. The red switch is set to ambivalent. The green switch is set
 to inflate. The silver toggle is set to off. The array of dip-switches
 is set to 0000.
 The minute dial is set to 0. The hour dial is set to 0.


>set hour dial to 1000


 You set the hour dial to 8.



 A piece of paper roughly stuck to the side of the machine, written in
 the Professor's scrawling handwriting:

 Rules for Time Travel.

 1. DO NOT try and communicate with yourself. It only leads (has led)
 (will have lead (?tense??check?)) to trouble.
 2. Once SEEN a thing CANNOT (has not) (will not) be (have (been))
 unseen!
  3. Once DONE a thing MUST ALWAYS have been (will be) done!
  4. The Universe is self consistent. There is only one of it.
 6. Attempting to corrupt the timeline will (have) lead (led) to
 paradox paralysis.
  7. Bootstrapping appears possible. Both information and things.
 8. There is only one time stream. If time is a river, then IT WILL
 NOT be diverted.
 9. Warning! The future is not yet created. More research needed here,
 I think.
  10. The past is created in the now, and is immutable.

 A note scribbled underneath the list reads: "More? Which of these, if
 broken, will destroy (has already destroyed?) the universe? Must
 check."

>inventory


 You are carrying:
   a ruined test paper
   a watch (being worn)
   a science textbook

>examine test paper


 A big red F glares at you from the front page. The rest of it is so
 covered in angry red scribbles and almost illegible remarks that it is
 unreadable.

>examine textbook


 "Adventures in Science" by Armen T. Woolpak. Four chapters of dense,
 turgid prose. You could read it chapter by chapter. Or perhaps you
 could consult it about things.

 According to the Table of Contents:

 Chapter 1 - So you thought you knew science!
 Chapter 2 - Physics, it's not just for Christmas!
 Chapter 3 - Fun things to do with chemicals!
 Chapter 4 - Setting up your very own science lab!




 That's not a verb I recognise.

 You can't see any such thing.

>read chapter 1


 Well that's a small piece of your life you won't get back. Dr. Woolpak
 seems extremely passionate about science. You don't, however, feel
 particularly enlightened.

 In the few minutes it takes you to skim the chapter, all kinds of
 interesting stuff is going on in the room!


 At 2:13 pm:
 To your consternation, a Second You appears with a waft of displaced
 air.

 At 2:14 pm:
 To your surprise, a Third You appears, in a slight wash of distended
 space.
 Second You undertakes several actions.

 At 2:15 pm:
 In what is becoming a little commonplace, a Fourth You appears, with a
 slight ripple in space/time.
 With a creak, a compartment hidden in the lab equipment opens. There
 seems to be a Fifth You in there!
 Second You dabbles about.

 At 2:16 pm:
 Third you looks round.
 Fifth You gets out of the secret compartment with some difficulty.
 Second You dabbles about in the immediate vicinity.
 Fourth You commits various feats.

 [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>read instructions


 A badly typed sheet pasted to the side of the machine. It appears to
 contain instructions on the various switches and dials. Perhaps you
 could consult it about them.

>consult instructions about grey


 You scan the the page of instructions, but find no reference to grey.

 Second You conducts certain acts.
 Third You potters round nearby.
 Fifth You gives something to Fourth You.
 Unsurprisingly, a Sixth You materialises in the room in a squeak of
 colliding particles.

>consult instructions about grey switch


 "It frustrates me that the minute dial still has quantum imprecision!
 Bah. I must refine the number of minutes with hard-coded switches. To
 represent a number to 60 minutes, I imagine a ternary system with four
 switches is required."

 Third you dawdles around the room.
 Second You, as if somewhat lost, commits particular exploits.
 Fourth You, seemingly a bit dazed, conducts different feats.
 Fifth You grabs the handle of the machine, furiously changes all the
 switches and with a soundless yawn of a collapsed space, disappears.
 He seems to be good at this. The machine resets itself with a whir of
 well-oiled gears.

>examine secret compartment


 The secret compartment is empty.

>consult instructions about black switch


 "It frustrates me that the minute dial still has quantum imprecision!
 Bah. I must refine the number of minutes with hard-coded switches. To
 represent a number to 60 minutes, I imagine a ternary system with four
 switches is required."

 Third you mooches about the place.
 Second You commits various deeds.
 Fourth You undertakes certain feats.

>mooch


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>mooch about


 That's not a verb I recognise.

>examine fourth you


 You've always wanted a twin. He is wearing a fourth watch.

 Fourth You is carrying an unspoilt test paper, a fourth science
 textbook and a first pen.

>consult instructions about toggle


 "A time direction must be selected. Warning! Read the hazard sheet."

 Second You, apparently somewhat bemused, conducts different exploits.
 Fourth You dawdles around, seemingly a bit out of sorts.

>consult instructions about dip-switches


 "It appears that an individual must have a unique code each time they
 travel in order that the crossing time-lines do not confuse the simple
 logic unit. Simple is required. I think a binary array that can be set
 to the next time stream number."

 Second You commits certain feats.
 Fourth You undertakes particular exploits.



 (Glancing surreptitiously at Fourth You's wrist) Your grandfather's.
 Very accurate. It reads 3:19 pm.

>consult instructions about dials


 "Select the amount of time to travel. Seconds is not possible. The
 level of quantum imprecision is too imprecise."

 Third You meanders to the time machine and, with a practiced swagger,
 does something complicated to the controls before vanishing in a
 whoosh of disturbed molecules.

 Just before the machine resets itself, you have time to notice that
 the black, red and green switches were set to harmonic, negatron, and
 quantum respectively.
 Second You looks about the room.
 Sixth You commits some actions.
 Fourth You conducts certain activities.

>consult instructions about button


 "When all is ready! Checklist: You have given a time. You have
 selected the direction of travel. You have corrected the minute dial
 bug with the switches. You are holding the handle. You have given a
 unique code to the array. You will not cause a paradox that will cause
 paralysis and may destroy the universe!"

 Sixth You undertakes particular deeds.
 OK. So this is getting complicated now. A Seventh You materialises
 with a faint clap of thunderous backfilling.

>examine watch


 Your grandfather's. Very accurate. The time is 2:24 pm.


>kill fourth me


 Violence isn't the answer to this one.

 Sixth You commits different actions.
 Second You wanders over to the machine, clumsily and slowly sets the
 minute dial to 10, flicks the black switch to oscillate, switches the
 red switch to ambivalent, sets the green switch to string, changes the
 silver toggle to backwards, sets the array of dip-switches to 0010,
 grabs the handle, presses the go button and disappears with the slight
 pop of an imploding vacuum.

 The machine, with a whir and a click, resets itself.
 Seventh You gives something to Sixth You.

>consult instructions about handle


 "Physical contact is a must! The world revolves around the sun, the
 sun about the galaxy, the galaxy about the universe. The universe
 expands! Space moves on through time. The machine must take you with
 it."

 With practiced brilliance, Sixth You fiddles with the controls of the
 time machine and vanishes unexpectedly with a crack of inward rushing
 atoms. You just notice that the array of dip-switches was set to 0100
 before the machine, with a hum and a cough, resets itself.

 With easy nonchalance, Fourth You grabs the handle of the machine,
 fiddles with the controls and, with a faint zephyr of emptiness
 disappearing, disappears. You notice that the silver toggle was set to
 backwards before, with a splutter, the machine resets itself.



 You set the silver toggle to backward.

 Nothing super obvious happens. Perhaps the machine hums a little
 louder. You can't be sure.

 Seventh You is stretched out on the floor, his face a rictus grimace,
 every muscle tense and trembling.

>take seventh watch


 That seems to belong to Seventh You.

 The door is flung open, and in marches the Professor, followed closely
 by the Principal.

 The Professor glances around the laboratory and his eyes alight on the
 paralysed Seventh You. "Aha," he exclaims, "see here. This is what I
 was speaking about. He cannot keep his fingers out of my equipment and
 so a paradox is created that might destroy the Universe!"

 The principal nods somberly, and before you know it, you are being
 frogmarched out of the college and into the cold unforgiving real
 world.

 Perhaps a career flipping burgers is more suited to your talents.

 Something's wrong. This isn't how you remember it. Not at all.

 The universe quakes on its axis, and your brain ties itself in knots
 trying to reconcile two entirely different realities. In fact, as
 there's no processing power left in your head for them to function
 anymore, your limbs stiffen and you fall to the floor, a crumpled,
 immoveable heap.

 As your eyesight gradually begins to fade, you see the vague outline
 of the professor appear in front of you, "Oh dear," he says, his voice
 echoing from what seems like a million miles away "a classic case of
 paradox paralysis. Still, no great loss, eh?"
